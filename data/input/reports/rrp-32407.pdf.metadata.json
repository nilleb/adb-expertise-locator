An \nundertaken and the summary is a core appendix. \n \nInfrastructure and equipment to upgrade the Tuvalu Maritime \nTraining Institute (TMTI) \n \nThe  social  and  economic  welfare  of  the  outer  islands  of \nTuvalu is critically dependent on the overseas remittances of \nTuvaluan  seafarers,  who  are  trained  by  TMTI.  Upgrading  of \nTMTI  is  essential  to  meet  the  current  International  Maritime \nOrganization  (IMO) \ntherefore \nensure the continued employment of Tuvaluan seafarers. \n \nThe  objective  is  to  upgrade  the  structures  and  training \nfacilities  of  TMTI,  to  meet  IMO  training  requirements  and \nthereby remain on the IMO White List, ensuring that Tuvaluan \nseafarers  will  continue  to  be  employed  overseas.  This \nobjective  will  contribute  significantly  to  the  goal  of  poverty \nreduction  in  the  outer  islands  of  Tuvalu  and  improve  the \neducation and skills of Tuvaluan seafarers. The scope of the \nProject includes rehabilitating and extending training facilities \nat  TMTI;  upgrading  the  wharf  facilities;  improving  and \nincreasing staff accommodation; improving water, power, and \ncommunication  services;  procuring  specialized \ntraining \nequipment; and extending shipping service offices. \n \nThe  total  project  base  cost  is  estimated  at  US$2.04  million. \nThe total estimated project cost, including physical and price \ncontingencies and interest, is US$2.30 million. \n \nAsian Development Bank: US$1,845,000  \nGovernment direct financial contribution: US$319,000 \nGovernment in-kind contribution: US$139,000 \n \nThe  loan  amount  will  be  equivalent  to  SDR  1,394,000  from \nthe  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  to  fund  approximately \n80% of the cost of the Project, covering approximately 88% of \nthe  foreign  exchange  costs.  The  loan  will  have  a  maturity of \n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest \ncharge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% \nper annum thereafter. The borrower will be Tuvalu.  \n \nUntil 31 August 2005. \n\n\fiv \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nEstimated Project Completion \nDate \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n28 February 2005 \n\nMinistry of Education and Sports \n \nA  project  steering  committee  will  comprise \nrelevant \ngovernment  agencies,  including  the  Ministry  of  Works, \nCommunication,  and  Transport  for  technical  advice.  An \nindependent  project  management  unit  will  receive  specific \nassistance from the loan to provide advice on tendering and \ncontract  supervision.  TMTI  will  manage  the  assets  on \nAmatuku  Island,  and  the  Shipping  Services  will  manage  the \noffices on Fongafale. \n \nThe main contract package, valued at approximately US$1.7 \nmillion, will be offered under international competitive bidding \nprocedures.  Materials  and  equipment  valued  below \nUS$50,000  will  be  procured  under  direct  purchase \nprocedures. \n \nApproximately  7  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices will be required for the project management unit and \nare estimated at US$157,000. \n \nUpgrading  of  the  TMTI  facilities  will  ensure  that  future \nmaritime  training  meets  IMO  guidelines  and  that  Tuvaluan \nseafarers  will  therefore  still  have  fair  access  to  overseas \nemployment.  This  will  allow  the  continued  flow  of  overseas \nremittances, upon which the social and economic welfare of \nthe outer islands of Tuvalu depends. Specific beneficiaries of \nthe  Project  include  TMTI  staff,  trainees,  Tuvaluan  seafarers, \nshipping  service  staff,  and  outer  island  communities.  More \nthan  60%  of  the  population  of  Tuvalu,  many  of  whom  are \neconomically  disadvantaged,  are  expected  to  receive  some \nbenefit from the Project. \n \nThe  main  risk  associated  with  the  Project  concerns  human \nimmunodeficiency \ndeficiency \nsyndrome, which is spreading rapidly in the Pacific. However, \nseveral development organizations in Tuvalu already address \nthis issue adequately. The Project's main assumption is that \nthe Government will ensure competent management  of TMTI \nat all times. \n \nOrganizational  Strengthening  and  Curriculum  and  Program \nDevelopment  at  TMTI;  total  project  cost  of  US$343,000,  of \nwhich US$291,000 is financed from the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan. \n\nvirus/acquired \n\nimmune \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\fv \n\n  \n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  Tuvalu  for  the  Maritime  Training  Project.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical \nassistance (TA) for  organizational  strengthening,  and  curriculum  and  program  development  at \nTuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI), and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. (The project framework \nis in Appendix 1). \n\n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nTuvalu is composed of nine low-lying coral atolls scattered in the Central Pacific Ocean. \nIt  has  a  land  area  of  26  square  kilometers  (km2) and an exclusive economic zone of 900,000 \nkm2 of ocean. The total resident population is about 10,340. The capital island, Fongafale in the \nFunafuti atoll, has an area of only 2.8 km2, but accounts for more than half of the population and \ntwo-thirds of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country. \n \n3. \nSeafarers  trained  at  TMTI  are  by  far  the  most  important  source  of  remittances  to  the \nouter islands. These remittances comprise the major part of household income, financing house \nconstruction,  school  fees,  business  investment,  and  consumption.  They  are  also  a  valuable \nsource  of  foreign  exchange.  About  1,000  TMTI  graduates  are  registered  for  employment  as \nseafarers, of which 470 currently are working overseas. Annual overseas earnings of seafarers \nin the last 2 years are in the range A$5 million-8 million. Most of this is remitted directly to bank \naccounts in Tuvalu, while some of it is spent overseas or used to pay directly for imports. The \nremittances  and  imports  to  Tuvalu  by  seafarers  are  significant  compared  with  annual  GDP  of \nabout  A$18  million.  Moreover,  seafarer  income  is  distributed  to  all  the  outer  islands.  In  some \nislands, overseas remittances comprise as much as 50\u201360% of the family income, especially in \nareas dominated by subsistence activity. \n \n4. \nTMTI was established in 1979 as the Tuvalu Maritime School, situated on Amatuku islet, \na  self-contained  islet  immediately  northwest  of  Fongafale.  The  institute  provides  training  for \nyoung  Tuvaluan  men \nforeign  vessels. \nApproximately 43% of the male population of working age in Tuvalu are employed as seafarers \n(the  extremely  limited  resource  base  of  Tuvalu  means  that  job  and  business  opportunities  are \nminimal).  TMTI  offers  three  12-month  pre-sea  and  shipboard  programs  yearly,  each  taking  20 \nnew entrants. For trainees to continue to be qualified to work on international ships, the institute \nmust  conform  to  the  standards  as  defined  by  the  International  Maritime  Organization  (IMO), \nspecifically  the  requirements  stipulated  by  the  International  Convention  on  Standards  of \nTraining, Certification, and Watchkeeping as amended in 1995 (STCW 95). These requirements \nalso  apply  to  the  free  refresher  and  upgrade  training  offered  by  TMTI  to  the  1,000  registered \nworking  seafarers,  who  must  complete  specific  safety  training  in  order  to  continue  their \nemployment on foreign vessels. \n \n5. \nTMTI is at a critical juncture ?  it does not have the requisite training facilities to meet all \ncurrent IMO training requirements, and the existing infrastructure and supply of basic services to \nresidents on Amatuku are inadequate. Tuvalu must demonstrate to IMO and overseas crewing \nagencies  that  TMTI  is  addressing  the  infrastructure  and  training  deficiencies.  The  planned \nupgrading  and  infrastructure  investment  must  also  be  implemented  as  soon  as  possible, to \navoid  jeopardizing  the  future  employment  of  Tuvaluan  seafarers.    If  TMTI  cannot  meet  IMO \n\nto  seek  employment  aboard \n\nto  enable \n\nthem \n\n\ftraining  requirements,  then  Tuvaluan  seafarers  cannot  work,  and  the  significant  revenue  flows \nto the outer islands would terminate. Recruitment of the current chief executive officer of TMTI \nand the corporatization of TMTI in July 2000 were major steps toward professional management \nof the institute using sound business principles. These steps were prerequisites for the physical \nupgrading of TMTI and the associated TA in capacity building. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nProblems and Opportunities \n\n6. \nSTCW 95 stipulates the standards that every country must ensure its training institutions \nand maritime administration meet, in order that its nationals may work on foreign-going vessels \nand that vessels sailing international waters under its flag may continue to operate. The purpose \nof the convention is to ensure that all seafarers are educated and trained to at least a minimum \nstandard and have sufficient experience to perform their duties competently, and thus minimize \nrisk to life, property, and the marine environment.  \n \n7. \nTuvalu gained White List status in November 2000 after compilation of a submission that \ndocumented  the  policies  and  procedures  established  to  ensure  that  required  standards  as \noutlined were met. This initial assessment by IMO was largely based on information supplied by \nTuvalu itself, and was essentially a desktop audit exercise. However, attaining White List status \nwas  just  the  beginning  of  the  work  necessary  to  ensure  the  continued  employment  of  Tuvalu \nseafarers.  These  standards  and  procedures  specified  in  the  original  White  List  submission  to \nIMO  must  be  adhered  to,  and  the  Marine  Department  (MD)  must  be  able  to  demonstrate that \nworking  systems  are  in  place  to  ensure  compliance.  MD,  as  the  maritime  administration  of \nTuvalu, is responsible for compliance. \n \nTo  maintain  White  List  status,  Tuvalu  must  submit  to  an  external  audit  process  at \n8. \nintervals  no  longer  than  5  years.  This  external  audit  is  intended  to  identify  the  extent  of \ncompliance,  determine  the  effectiveness  of  quality  systems,  provide  opportunities  to  improve \nquality  control,  and  establish  an  effective  and  efficient  audit  system.  The  performance  and \nquality systems of MD in roles other than ensuring the quality and conduct of training at TMTI is \nalso  subject  to  this  external  audit  process,  including  search  and  rescue,  port  state  control \ninspections, flag state control inspections, and the certification of seafarers.  \n \nHowever, gaining the initial place on the White List may well prove to be the easiest part \n9. \nof the process for many of the 72 nations currently holding that status. The Regional Maritime \nProgramme of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), is of the opinion that, of the 10 \nPacific Island nations currently on the White List, 5 would be at risk of losing their status in the \nevent  of  external  audit  by  an  IMO  approved  agent? among them Tuvalu. The common issue \nappears \nthe  certification \nprocedures? databases,  establishment  of  audit  procedures  and  audit  history,  and  general \ndocumentation of processes. Informal comment indicates that a commonality among states at \nrisk is lack of separation of the maritime administration function from that of a larger and more \ndiverse government department. In those Pacific island countries where a separate entity is able \nto  focus  clearly  on  the  roles  and  functions  required  by  STCW  95  (such  as  Tonga), authorities \nappear better equipped to meet the obligations imposed.  \n \n10. \nAs of 30 September 2001, 1,036 seafarers retained active membership with the Tuvalu \nOverseas Seamen\u2019s Union (TOSU). On that date, 470 individuals were at sea according to the \n\nto  be  development  of \n\nrequired  systems \n\nto  assure \n\nthe \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f3 \n\nemployment records of the recruiting agencies based in Tuvalu. These agencies estimate that \nthe seafarers spend approximately 60% of their working life on the vessels, indicating that the \ncurrent  employment  pool  on  that  date  should  be  estimated  at  783  to  allow  for  those  resting \nbetween  contracts  and  in  transit  to  join  vessels.  This  leaves  a  total  of  253  absent  from \ntheoretical  employment  status,  a  figure  that  approximately  corresponds  with  the  total  of  those \nseafarers  who  have  been  subject  to  suspension  from  employment  for  alcohol  or  disciplinary \nreasons.  Seafarer employment varies from year to year, reflected in the remittances to Tuvalu. \n  \nThe global market for employment at sea presently favors the employment of deck and \n11. \nengineering officers, as opposed to those seafarers with basic qualifications as deck or engine \nroom ratings1 currently graduating from TMTI, and the employment outlook for the years through \nto 2010 presents no predicted change in outlook within an increasingly competitive  market. The \ntypical classifications of Tuvaluan seafarers include able seaman, ordinary seaman, motorman \n(the latter three comprising the majority), pumpman, bosun, deck fitter, engine fitter, wiper, cook, \nsteward, and messman. \n   \nThe historical employment link for Tuvalu seafarers is with German shipping companies,  \n12. \nand this link has been consistent from the inception of the Tuvalu Maritime School in 1979 until \ntoday. The strength, stamina, and natural ability of seafarers from Tuvalu have greatly assisted \ntheir  employment  opportunities  in  the  past.  In  the  competitive  market  that  prevails  now,  less \nvalue  is  placed  on  these  characteristics,  and  factors  such  as  the  ability  to  conclude  amicable \ncollective employment agreements with TOSU are viewed favorably.  \n \n13. \nTwo main factors present a risk to the continuation of current employment figures, and \nas  barriers  to  employment  growth:  (i)  a  growing  propensity  for  incidents  of  alcohol  abuse  and \nconsequent violence; and (ii) a marked drop in the standard of oral and written English, noted \nanecdotally by employers, agents, and TMTI staff. Problems with English and alcohol will pose \na  significant  barrier  to  widening  the  pool  of  potential  employers,  in  particular  the  operators  of \npassenger  cruise  vessels,  which  have  been  identified  as  having  future  employment  potential. \nOne  of  the  German  employers  has  already  taken  the  step  of  declaring  their  vessels  free  of \nalcohol  in  an  effort  to  address  the  problem.  However,  the  employment  agents  all  noted  the \npositive  changes  related  to  these  problems  achieved  in  recent  times.  If  the  problems  can  be \nkept  under  control,  the  present  agents  see  a  good  future  for  the  continued  employment  of \nTuvaluan seafarers. \n \n14. \nThe  weak  organizational  setup  of  MD,  with  its cramped office space and poor staffing, \nprevents efficient administration of cargo and domestic passenger services. Similarly affected is \nMD\u2019s involvement in training of TMTI students onboard the  Nivaga II, one of the vessels under \nMD\u2019s  responsibility.  Deficiencies  in  MD  functions  could  result  in  Tuvalu  being  struck  from  the \nWhite List, which would prevent Tuvaluan seafarers from working overseas; the same effect as \nnoted  for  TMTI.  Tuvalu  Shipping  Services,  a  unit  under  MD,  therefore  also  needs  attention  in \nthe near term, to ensure that weaknesses in this area do not compromise the efforts at TMTI. \nAssistance  to  MD  within  both  the  Project  and  the  associated  TA  is  therefore  incorporated. \nDetails on Tuvalu Shipping Services are provided in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n15. \nIn  discussions  with  the  Government,  there  is  general  agreement  that  cost  recovery  for \nTMTI\u2019s  training  services  should,  to  the  extent  possible,  be  recovered  from  users.  It  will  be \nimportant for the Government to explore alternative mechanisms for accomplishing this.  \n\n                                                 \n1   Rating is essentially a naval term referring to noncommissioned sailors; in general usage it refers to the crew of a \n\nvessel, other than officers . \n\n  \n \n\n\f \n16. \nInfections  with  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)  and  acquired  immune  deficiency \nsyndrome  (AIDS)  are  increasing  rapidly  in  the  Pacific.  High-risk groups include seafarers and, \nfor a country like Tuvalu with such a small population, the consequences can be dire. However, \nSPC  and  TOSU  have  comprehensive  HIV/AIDS  awareness  programs  under  implementation, \nand  other  development  agencies  are  considering  additional  assistance.  With  this  level  of \nsupport,  the  HIV/AIDS  issue  is  being  appropriately  addressed  and  any  additional  assistance \nwould probably exceed the absorptive capacity of the targeted audience. \n \n\n2. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nThere  has  been  no  formal  evaluation  of  projects  to  strengthen  training  institutes  for \n17. \nseafarers  in  the  Pacific  region.  The  Pacific  region  has  7  maritime  training  institutes;  their \ncurricula  and  specialization  are  guided  by  the  Regional  Maritime  Programme  of  SPC.  The \nprinciples  in  the  SPC  strategy  have  been  to  avoid  competition  between  the  countries  and \ninstead  focus  on  comparative  advantages.  Tuvalu,  being  by  far  the  smallest  country  with \nrespect  to  population,  has  taken  advantage  of  the  positive  attributes  of  its  seafarers,  such  as \ngeneral  fluency  in  English,  pleasant  personalities,  strong  physiques,  and,  lately,  the  collective \nemployment agreement with TOSU. However, SPC has repeatedly warned against broadening \nits curriculum to include officer training, as the costs would be too high and, the human resource \nbase, too small. \n  \n18. \nThe  Project  has  taken  the  SPC  strategy  into  consideration.  The  proposed  upgrade  of \nTMTI  and  the  associated  TA  in  curriculum  development,  therefore,  focus  only  on  training  of \nratings.  The  competition  from  other  countries  is  growing,  but  the  strong  and  long-standing \nrelationship with the German shipping agencies is likely to continue if the standards are kept up \nto IMO requirements. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives  \n\n19. \nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  ensure  that  TMTI  can  continue  to  provide  basic \ntraining  and  more  specialized  refresher  and  upgrade  training  to  prospective  and  current \nTuvaluan seafarers, in a manner that meets IMO training standards. This will be achieved by (i) \nupgrading the infrastructure at TMTI and MD, (ii) providing training equipment, and (iii) providing \ninstitutional support to TMTI and MD under the associated TA. By addressing education needs \nand  access  to  international  job  opportunities,  the  Project  contributes  directly  to  the  goals  of \nmore equitable income distribution and poverty reduction, particularly in the outer islands.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs  \n\n20. \nThe infrastructure upgrade includes (i) a wharf extension and installation of specialized \nsafety-at-sea training equipment, (ii) installation of a fire fighting facility, (iii) increase in the water \ncatchment  and  storage  capacity,  (iv)  construction  of  new  staff  housing,  (v)  rehabilitation  and \nextension  of  trainee  quarters  and  training  facilities,  (vi)  installation  of  a  backup  solar  power \nsystem, (vii) renovation of existing staff houses, (viii) installation of improved telecommunication \nsystems, (ix) procurement of specialized training and operational equipment, and (x) extension \nand improvement of MD offices on Fongafale. \n \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f5 \n\nThe  number  of  qualified  seafarers  graduating  from  an  increasing  number  of  maritime \n21. \nschools around the world, and the subsequent tightening of IMO standards, highlight the need \nfor  TMTI  to  maintain  its  comparative  advantage.  The  specialized  training  equipment  proposed \nand the general upgrade of all facilities on Amatuku are the minimum requirements for a training \ninstitute to carry out professional training to IMO standards. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nTwo  important  requirements  must  be  considered  with  respect  to  the  infrastructure \n22. \nupgrade  at  Amatuku.  All  buildings  should  be  made  to  standards  that  require  minimum \nmaintenance  and,  at  the  same  time,  can  withstand  the  harsh  environment  of  tropical  sun, \nseawater  spray,  and  occasional  typhoons.  Because  Amatuku  has  no  groundwater,  the  water \ncatchment  from  all  buildings  should  feed  into  a  larger  water  storage  tank  system.  Both  issues \nwill be addressed under the Project. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n23. \nThe total project base cost is estimated at US$2.04 million. The total estimated project \ncost,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction,  is  US$2.3 \nmillion.

The  proposed  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  32  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 8 years, and interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter. The Borrower will be Tuvalu. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n26. \nThe Ministry of Education and Sports (MES) will be the Executing Agency. MES has not \nbeen involved with ADB loan projects previously, but TMTI has been the recipient of various aid \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f7 \n\nprojects  over  the  last  3\u20134  years.  Staff  at  TMTI  will  be  directly  involved  in  planning  and \nimplementing the Project, since the construction on Amatuku will require close coordination with \nTMTI\u2019s  routine  training  and  educational  activities.  Similarly,  staff  at  MD  will  be  involved  in  the \nplanning  and  coordination  of  office  extension  activities  proposed  for  the  Project.  The \norganizational  structure  of  TMTI  and  educational  issues  are  described  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \n27. \nTMTI  staff  are  fully  capable  of  coordinating  the  construction  activities  on  Amatuku; \nhowever,  the  actual  project  implementation  will  involve  construction  by  professional  builders \nexperienced  in  modular  construction  in  tropical  areas.  An  international  consultant  will  be \nengaged to assist with construction supervision and all tender procedures. \n \nA project management unit (PMU) will be set up within MES. The PMU will be headed by \n28. \nthe assistant secretary of MES and assisted by the superintendent of TMTI, the director of MD, \nand  a  qualified  engineer  from  the  Public  Works  Department.  The  supervisory  consulting \nengineer will work within the PMU. The PMU will manage and oversee Project implementation \naccording to the implementation schedule, including recruitment and supervision of consultants, \nprocurement  of  goods  and  services,  contract  management,  project  planning,  disbursement, \nrecords, and reporting. TMTI will manage the assets on Amatuku as they come on stream, and \nthe  Shipping  Services  and  MD  will  manage  the  offices  on  Fongafale.  Indicative  maintenance \ncosts, under various scenarios, are provided in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n29. \nA  project  steering  committee,  compris ing  involved  government  agencies  with  relevant \ntechnical expertise, including the Public Works Department and MD, will be established and will \nmeet quarterly to discuss and guide project implementation and review the planning process. \n \n\n2. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 28 months from November 2002 to February 2005, \n30. \nwith tendering and review of proposals occurring on or about December 2002 (detailed designs \nin  Supplementary  Appendix  D).  The  supervisory  engineer  is  expected  to  assure  a  phased \nconstruction process, with the most critical training facilities completed first, while reducing the \npressure  of  construction  crews  on  island  resources  and  potential  disruption  to  routine \neducational activities on Amatuku. The implementation schedule in Appendix 3. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n31. \nAll  procurement  financed  by  the  loan  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Civil works comprise most of the loan and will be tendered in one package under \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Equipment and material valued below US$50,000 \nwill be procured under direct purchase procedures. The contract packages are in Appendix 4. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nAn  individual  consultant  will  be  engaged  for  approximately  7  person-months.  The \n32. \nconsulting  engineer  will  be  responsible  for  prequalification  and  evaluation  of  tenders,  and  in \nparticular, assist with the tendering process and construction supervision. The consultant will be \npart of the PMU. The consultant will be  recruited by TMTI in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. The terms of reference are in Appendix 5. \n\n  \n \n\n\f5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n33.  MES  will  establish  an  imprest  account  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \nimprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, as amended. The ceiling of the imprest account will not \nexceed the equivalent of US$50,000. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure may be used \nfor  reimbursement  of  expenditures  less  than  US$50,000  equivalent  and  for  liquidation  of \nadvances made from the imprest account.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAccount, Audit, and Report \n\n34.  MES  will  maintain  consistent  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  goods  and \nservices financed from the proceeds of the loan. MES will (i) maintain separate accounts for the \nProject;  (ii)  ensure  that  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  are  audited  annually  in \naccordance  with  sound  auditing  principles  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB;  and \n(iii) submit to ADB, not later than 6 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified copies of \nthe  audited  accounts  and  the  report  of  the  auditor.  Quarterly  reports,  detailing  implementation \nprogress,  achievements \nframework, \ndisbursement, consulting input, as well as issues pertaining to disbursement projections for the \nfollowing quarter and any delay in implementation schedule, will be prepared by the PMU and \nsubmitted to MES with copies made available to ADB. MES will be the administrative focal point \nfor the loan and will submit brief monthly project progress reports to ADB via fax or E-mail. MES \nwill submit a project completion report to ADB within 3 months after physical completion of the \nProject. \n \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nthe  project \n\nindicators \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nBenefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  assessed  through  the  project  benefit  and \n35. \nmonitoring  evaluation  function  of  the  Island  Development  Program,2  which  already  collects \ninformation on seafarer remittances to the outer islands.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Reviews \n\n36. \nAn  inception  mission  will  be  fielded  1  month  after  the  supervisory  engineer  consultant \nhas  invited  tenders,  and  a  midterm  review  will  be  undertaken  at  the  end  of  the  first  year of \nimplementation. A final review will be undertaken at Project completion. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nteaching  resources  and \n\nThe objective of the TA is to complement the physical infrastructure upgrade of TMTI by \n37. \naugmenting  TMTI\u2019s  technical  capability  so  that  it  can  meet  the  training  standards  and \nrequirements  of  STCW  95.  The  TA  will  provide  advice  and  assistance  on  the  continuous \nimprovement  of \nlearning  resources,  and \nenhancement  of  employment  outcomes  from  existing  programs;  maximize  the  training \nopportunities  available  through  the  Nivaga  II  and  other  vessels;  as  well  as  develop  new \nprograms or integrate existing programs, as necessary. It is also directed at implementation of \ninternational  ship  management  and  planned  maintenance  procedures  of  the  vessels  of  the \nShipping Services, along with a focus on competency-based assessment training with TMTI. \n                                                 \n2   ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Tuvalu \n\ntechniques,  student \n\nfor the Island Development Program. Manila. \n\n8 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f9 \n\nAn  international  consulting  firm,  maritime  institute,  or  individual  consultants  will  be \n38. \ncontracted to provide approximately 11 person-months of international consulting services, on a \nstaggered basis over 2 years, in the following fields (i) management and organization (3 person-\nmonths),  (ii)  maritime  education  (3  person-months),  (iii)  technical  subject  matter  (2  person-\nmonths), and (iv) maritime engineering (3 person-months). Consulting services will be recruited \nunder the quality and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. The simplified technical proposal procedure will apply. \n \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at US$343,000 equivalent, of which US$291,000 is \n39. \nthe  foreign  exchange  cost  and  US$52,000  equivalent  is  the  local  currency  cost.  The \nGovernment has requested ADB to finance, on a grant basis, a total of US$291,000 to cover the \nentire  foreign  exchange  cost.  The  foreign  exchange  costs  of  the  TA  cover  consultants\u2019 \nremuneration,  per  diem,  international  and  local  travel,  report  production,  training  materials, \ncommunication,  and  contingencies.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  US$52,000 \nequivalent in local currency by providing counterpart staff, office facilities, and local counterpart \ntravel.  ADB  will  finance  the  TA  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan. The TA cost estimates are in Appendix 6. \n \n40.  While  MES  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  TA,  the  day-to-day  implementation \nresponsibilities  will  be  vested  with  the  superintendent  of  TMTI.  TMTI  will  also  provide \ncounterpart  staff  to  the  consultants.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  2  years \ncommencing November 2002, and with a closing date of December 2005. The TA will provide a \nfront-loaded  input  of  targeted  assistance  in  the  first  year  to  ensure  effective  and  compliant \ndelivery of STCW 95 survival and fire-fighting training by TMTI, implementation of international \nship  management,  planned  maintenance  procedures  of  the  vessels  of  the  Shipping  Services, \ncompetency-based  assessment  training  with  TMTI  staff,  and  maximization  of  training \nopportunities  presented  by  the  availability  of  the  Nivaga  II.  Each  of  the  annual  inputs  will \ncommence  with  a  meeting  of  the  consultants  and  the  TMTI  board  validating  an  annual \nimplementation plan formulated on a current needs assessment for TMTI against the scope and \nobjectives of the TA. \n \n41. \nThe  consultants  will  be  required  to  submit  assessment  reports  following  each  input,  as \nwell  as  a  brief  outline  of  the  possible  needs  to  be  addressed  during  their  assignments.  Upon \ncompletion  of  the  consultancy  for  each  specific  subject  area,  the  consultant  concerned  will \nproduce  a  final  report  with  clear  recommendations  on  how  to  ensure  sustainability  and \ncontinued accreditation to the IMO White List. \n \n42. \nThe  superintendent  of  TMTI  will  provide  ADB  with quarterly assessments, reporting on \nimplementation progress, issues that will require any variation from the specified inputs, as well \nas validation of the indicators specified in the project framework. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\n43. \nThe  main  benefit  from  the  Project  is  that  it  will  allow  TMTI  to  continue  to  be  an \naccredited maritime training institution maintaining its White List status. Other benefits from the \nProject  are  increased  earnings  from  Tuvaluan  international  seafarers  that  will  flow  into  the \ncountry.  In  this  case,  the  with-project  situation  is  the  continuing  operation  of  TMTI,  with  an \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n1. \n\nGeneral \n\n  \n \n\n\fincrease in the number of trainees that graduate each year and the provision of upgrading and \nrevalidation courses to the pool  of active seafarers. The without-project situation assumes that \nTMTI loses its White List status, is no longer an accredited maritime training institute, and has to \nclose  down.  The  Government  would  then  be  faced  with  having  to  send  its  young  men  to  a \ncomparable  training  institute  overseas.  Upgrading  and  revalidation  short  courses  would  also \nhave  to  be  conducted  overseas.  Lack  of  English  proficiency  would  likely  reduce  the  intake  of \nTuvaluans at an overseas training institute and the pool of trained seafarers would continue to \ndecrease  over  time  as  individuals  retire,  with  a  consequent  reduction  in  the  amount  of  their \nearnings remitted back to Tuvalu. \n \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional \n\nCurrently, TMTI conducts three classes of maritime training: \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n1-year  residential  basic  training  course  for  new  entrants  before  employment  at \nsea (TMTI takes in 60 trainees per year in three intakes of 20 and, normally, 50 \ncomplete the course and graduate; 4 months of the time is spent undergoing sea \ntraining on the Nivaga II); \n\nupgrade  courses  of  3  weeks  duration  for  basic  fire-fighting,  safety,  and  sea \nsurvival  training  (this  course  is  normally  provided  once  during  the  career  of  a \nseafarer, usually within the first 2\u20133 years of employment; the upgrade allows the \nseafarers to move up the pay scale and receive an immediate increase in pay); \nand \n\nrevalidation and refresher course for seafarers (each seafarer must revalidate the \ncertificate every 5 years to maintain his employment status under STCW 95; the \ncourse  normally  lasts  1  week  and  involves  fire-fighting,  sea  safety,  and  tanker \nskills, with the objective of refreshing the seafarers' skills, allowing for changes in \ntechnology  and  competency  requirements.  On  average,  around  150\u2013200 \nseafarers require revalidation per year). \n\na. \n\nThe With-Project Situation \n\n45. \nTMTI  is  upgraded  and  maintains  its  White  List  status.  The  improved  facilities  allow  an \nincrease in the number of new entrants to a level where 70 graduate each year from an intake \nof up to 90 trainees, compared with the present situation where 50 graduate each year from an \nintake  of  60.  Upgrading  and  revalidation  courses  are  conducted  as  required  and  the  existing \npool of active seafarers have the opportunity to attend the upgrading and revalidating courses at \nTMTI. \n \n46. \nThe  average  working  life  for  a  Tuvaluan  seafarer  is  assumed  to  be  15  years,  which \nrepresents a loss from the pool of seafarers of 7% per year. The output of 70 new seafarers per \nyear is sufficient to maintain the pool of trained and active seafarers at around the current level \nof 1,000. \n \n47. \nexisting and new infrastructure, with replacement of capital items and equipment as needed. \n \n\nThe  operating  costs  of  TMTI  are  increased  to  reflect  the  required  maintenance  of  the \n\n10 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n44. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f11 \n\nb. \n\nThe Without-Project Situation \n\n48. \nTMTI  loses  its  White  List  status  within  2  years  and  is  forced  to  close  down.  The \nGovernment, recognizing the importance of the seafarers\u2019 employment to the country, continues \nto fund a reduced number of new trainees to receive their training overseas at an institute that \nhas  the  capacity  to  undertake  such  training.  Some  trainees  may  also  fund  themselves. \nHowever,  because  of  the  more  difficult  logistics  in  organizing  the  overseas  training,  and  the \nstricter entrance requirements for the overseas institutions (such as the level of English ability), \nthe  number  of  trainees  who  successfully  complete  the  training  is  reduced  to  only  half  of  the \ncurrent  output  and  only  25  new  seafarers  graduate  each  year.  This  results  in  a  gradual \nreduction in the pool of trained and active seafarers, based on the same attrition rate of 7% per \nyear.  Consequently,  the  number  of  employed  seafarers  is  reduced  and  remittance  income \ndiminishes accordingly over time. \n \n49. \nAll  upgrading  and  revalidation  courses  would  have  to  be conducted overseas as well, \npossibly contributing to a greater attrition rate, as seafarers decide that continuing employment \nas  a  seafarer  is  too  difficult.  Some  trainees  who  go  overseas  may  lose  their  links  with  Tuvalu \nand  emigrate  permanently,  reducing  the  amount  of  income  remitted  home  to  Tuvalu.  The  net \nresult is that the level of income that Tuvalu receives from its seafarers is severely reduced as \nthe pool of active workers decreases over time. \n \nB. \n\nSocial and Environmental Impacts \n\n1. \n\nSocial Issues \n\n50. \nThe social context on Amatuku is quite straightforward, comprising 12 TMTI professional \nand  support  staff  (25  individuals,  when  family  members  are  included),  and  no  more  than  40 \ntrainees at any one time. The island is about 1 kilometer long by 200 meters wide (at the widest \npoint).  Conditions  are  probably  more  favorable  than  most  other  locations  throughout  Tuvalu, \nwith  independent  (although  sometimes  unreliable)  power  supply,  telephone  communication, \ndaily  access  to  the  facilities  on  Fongafale,  and  a  pleasant  well-vegetated  setting.  Water  is \nlimited  at  times.  The  maximum  population  is  65  and  maximum  population  density  is  about \n430/km2,  slightly  higher  than  the  population  density  in  the  more  populated  outer  islands,  but \nmuch less than Fongafale. Five TMT I staff members commute by boat from Fongafale. Women \nare in the minority on Amatuku, given that this is a training facility for men. Only a few women \nmembers of TMTI staff families live on the island. \n \n51. \nThe  land  occupied  by  TMTI  is  on  a  long-term  government  lease  from  private \nlandowners. No apparent issues are related to the lease. The southern end of Amatuku (about \n100  meters  long)  is  still  privately  held  and  the  small  islet  immediately  to  the  north  is  also  in \nprivate hands. Housing is provided to some TMTI staff and the dormitory is used to house the \ntrainees.  Staff  housing  is  located  toward  the  northern  end  of  the  island,  whereas  the  trainees \nare  housed  in  the  southern  section  of  the  property.  Segregation  of  residential  areas  from \ntraining and service areas is quite good and dense vegetation screens in most residential areas \nto provide some privacy. Housing is provided essentially free, with a nominal rent paid to TMTI. \n \n52. \nThe  construction  activities  required  to  upgrade  TMTI  can  be  managed  with  minimal \nsocial impacts, especially as the construction can be phased over 2 years to reduce pressure on \narea  and  services.  The  proposed  upgrading  of  the  facilities  on  Amatuku  will  bring  significant \nbenefits:  improved  provision  of  basic  services,  better  training  facilities,  and  more  comfortable \nhousing. The social impacts and benefits of the construction project itself are considered in the \n\n  \n \n\n\fSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy in Appendix 7 and detailed in Supplementary \nAppendix E. \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Impact \n\n53. \nAs a result of the Project, the pool of seafarers actively involved in overseas employment \nwill  be  maintained  at  the  present  level  of  1,000,  with  around  45%,  or  450,  actually  working \noverseas at any one time. Without the Project, the  pool of seafarers will likely decline over time \nthrough  attrition,  due  to  retirement  and  other  factors,  with  the  number  of  new  seafarers  being \ntrained  not  sufficient  to  maintain  the  numbers.  After  25  years,  the  total  active  pool  will  have \nreduced from 1,000 to only 470. \n \n54. \nAbout half of the males of working age are trained as seafarers. An estimated 60% of all \nhouseholds,  or  around  6,000  people,  receive  benefits  directly  from  the  remittance  income \nearned  by  the  seafarers.  In  the  absence  of  the  Project,  this  will  reduce  over  time  by  at  least \n50%; thus about 30% of the households in Tuvalu stand to benefit directly from the Project. \n \n55. \nThe net increase in the level of remittance income due to the Project is estimated to total \nA$3  million  by  the  end  of  the  Project's  life.  This  is  equivalent  to  A$1,000  per  person.  No \ninformation on the distribution of poor households is available for Tuvalu, but the impact of this \ndistribution  can  be  expected  to  be  pro-poor.  Any  increase  in  the  pool  of  seafarers  (or \nmaintaining the present number) has a proportionally bigger impact on the poorer members of \nthe community.  \n \n56.  While  most  of  the  obvious  benefits  from  the  Project  are  in  a  monetary  form,  several \nnonmonetary benefits are apparent. The improvement in the standard of living or quality of life in \nthe  outer  islands  is  expected  to  counteract  the  pressure  to  migrate  to  Fongafale.  Employment \nas a seafarer provides a combination of a tax-free income-earning opportunity that far exceeds \nthe remuneration from other work in Tuvalu, and the opportunity for relaxation time in their home \ncommunities between jobs. While employed, the seafarers are provided with full food, benefits, \nand lodgings. This represents a saving in consumption costs that they would  otherwise incur if \nthey were not at sea. \n \n57. \nThe  use  of  remittance  income  to  purchase  construction  materials  for  building  better \nquality  housing  and  water  collection  and  storage  facilities  in  the  outer  islands  has  a  positive \nimpact on the quality  of  life  and  health.  The  use  of  the  money  to  pay  for  family  members  to \nattend school in the Fiji Islands allows the children of seafarers to receive a higher standard of \neducation than they would expect to receive in Tuvalu, increasing their prospects for personal \nadvancement and employment, while, at the same time, relieving the Government of some of its \nresponsibilities to provide social services. \n \n58. \nAccording  to  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  Tuvalu  has  the  lowest  per \ncapita  GDP  of  US$1,157  and  the  lowest  human  development  index  among  the  Polynesian \ncountries. Fifty percent of the population has less than US$1 cash income per day. Using this \nmeasure  of  poverty  (which  is  not  strictly  correct,  since  most  families  in  Tuvalu  have  land  and \naccess  to  fish),  the  level  of  poverty  in  the  outer  islands  is  three  times  higher  than  in  Funafuti. \nThe disparity in net cash income between Funafuti and the outer islands reflects the relatively \nhigh incidence of government jobs in Funafuti, whereas job and business opportunities on the \nouter islands are much more limited. The more disadvantaged groups (the old, the very young, \nand women) are concentrated on the outer islands, reflecting emigration of younger workers to \n\n12 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f13 \n\nFunafuti and the overseas employment of almost half the men from the outer islands. Given this \nsituation, seafarer remittances clearly have a role to play in supporting the social and economic \nwelfare of the outer islands, where most of the seafarers come from. \n \nThe  remittances  are  extremely  important,  but  subject  to  global  forces  of  supply  and \n59. \ndemand  for  seafarers.  Fluctuations  in  the  total  annual  seafarer  remittances  in  the  last  5  years \nhave  been  considerable.  Despite  some  dips  in  employment  in  the  late  1990s,  an  increasing \ntrend is evident. In early 2000, a high of 514 seafarers were at sea (on 79 vessels). The current \nlevel is 470 (September 2001). The main threats to stable or growing overseas employment for \nTuvaluan  seafarers  include  (i)  competition  from  other  countries,  especially  if  maritime  training \nquality  in  Tuvalu  were  to  decline;  and  (ii)  increasing  incidence  of  seafarer  alcohol  abuse  (and \nassociated dismissals). The Project is aimed directly at this vulnerability of Tuvaluan seafarers, \nby  providing  the  facilities  and  capacity  for  better  training,  and  ensuring  that  they  have  a \ncompetitive advantage for international job opportunities. \n \n60. \nSeafarer  remittances  received  in  Tuvalu  in  2000  totaled  around  A$4.7  million.  Current \nindications are that this total will be  higher in 2001 (at about A$6.3 million), reflecting the recent \nincrease in seafarer wages, the decreased value of the Australian dollar against the US dollar, \nand  a  relatively  high  level  of  employment.  Analysis  of  the  prorated  distribution  of  seafarer \nremittances  on  an  island  basis  (reflecting  the  home  islands  of  Tuvaluan  seafarers)  was \nundertaken. The largest absolute amounts of seafarer remittance are earned by Nanumea-and \nFunafuti-based  men,  but,  on  a  per  capita  basis,  the  greatest  potential  economic  benefits of \nseafarer remittances will accrue to families based in Nanumea, Nui, Nukufetau, and Nukulaelae. \nThe  potential  per  capita  distribution  of  seafarer  remittances  to  Nanumea  over  the  next  year  is \nA$1,573,  more  than  five  times  the  per  capita  benefit  to  families  with  Funafuti  listed  as  their \nhome island. Clearly, the outer islands have a dependence on the seafarer remittances and a \nhigher  potential  of  economic  benefit  from  them,  compared  with  Funafuti.  The  Project  is \nattempting, through the upgrading of TMTI, to secure these potential economic benefits to the \nouter islands. \n \n\n3. \n\nSexually Transmitted Diseases \n\nHIV/AIDS is spreading fast in the Pacific region. In a country as dependent on overseas \n61. \nseafarers  as  Tuvalu,  the  consequences  of  even  small  numbers  of  HIV/AIDS  positive  cases \ncould be devastating in such a small population. Tuvalu diagnosed the first HIV positive case in \n1995  and  2  more  cases  up  to  2001.  However,  in  the  month  of  January  2002,  6  cases  were \ndiagnosed,  and  the  trend  is  obviously  on  the rise. Seafarers make up 7 of the reported cases \nand  this  has  caused  great  concern,  not  only  in  the  Government,  but  also  among  the  shipping \nagents. \n \n62.  Much  stricter  guidelines  have  now  been  introduced  before  individuals  are  approved  for \noverseas  seafarer  employment  with  the  German  shipping  agencies.  The  seafarers\u2019  medical \nfitness  certificate  now \nthe  medical  officer\u2019s \nincludes  psychological  assessment, \nrecommendation,  and  HIV/AIDS  tests.  While  the  HIV/AIDS  test  is  not  mandatory,  strong \nsuspicion  will  be  raised  if  potential  seafarers  decline  the  test.  The  Government  applies  these \ntests to seafarers, scholarship students, and government and nongovernment workers.  \n \n63. \nTOSU has received funding from the International Transport Workers Federation for its \nawareness  program  on  drugs  and  alcohol  abuse  as  well  as  HIV/AIDS.  The  program  trains \ntrainers and the target is to have an HIV/AIDS mentor onboard each ship. In addition, SPC, with \nfunding  from  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development, World Health Organization, \n\n  \n \n\n\fand  Unites  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  established  its  HIV/AIDS  project  in \nlate 1990. The overall aim of this project is to strengthen the capacity of Pacific island countries \nand  territories  to  minimize  the  impact  of  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually  transmitted  diseases  by \nproviding support and TA to national programs. \n \n64. \nBoth  programs  are  ongoing  and  other  assistance  agencies  in  Tuvalu  have  expressed \ninterest in participating in additional programs in the fight against the spread of HIV/AIDS. The \nlevel  of  awareness  training,  publication  material,  and  special  programs  being  implemented  is \nquite  intense  and  the  absorptive  capacity  for  this  level  of  assistance  is  probably  at  its  limit. \nTherefore, incorporation of HIV/AIDS activities in the Project is not warranted. \n \n\n4. \n\nEnvironment \n\n65. \nThe environment classification of the Project is category B\u2014a project with environmental \nimpacts that are easily mitigated using established technologies and mitigating measures. The \ninitial environmental examination (IEE) was completed in September 2001 as part of the project \npreparatory  TA.  The  IEE  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental Assessment \nRequirements.  The  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  IEE  are  integrated  in  the  engineering \ndesign  and  contract  document.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Guidelines for Infrastructure Projects. The summary IEE is provided in Appendix \n8  and  the  complete  IEE  is  part  of  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  Several  factors  preclude  any \nsignificant negative environmental impacts associated with the Project: (i) the small scale of the \nProject;  (ii)  absence  of  any  significant  sensitive  terrestrial,  coastal,  and  marine  habitats  in  the \nproject  area;  and  (iii)  the  fact  that  the  Project  essentially  involves  upgrading  of  facilities  at  an \nexisting site (the increase in land area of the structures on Amatuku is only 8%). \n \n66. \nThe project design incorporates sound environmental management principles, including \nminimal disturbance of the seabed or terrestrial overburden, minimal cutting of trees, minimizing \nthe  land  area  of  the  Project  by  building  up  (rather  than  out),  use  of  modular  construction  to \nminimize construction wastage, and use of solar power. The design features and specified good \nconstruction practices will be covenants of the contracts and will be monitored for compliance by \nthe PMU.  \n \nC. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analysis \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n67. \nThe economic analysis of the Project for rehabilitating and upgrading TMTI was carried \nout following the normal benefit-cost analysis methodology based on the future with the Project \nminus  the  future  without  the  Project,  to  indicate  the  net  economic  benefits  to  the  Tuvalu \neconomy.  Economic  performance  is  measured  by  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR) \nand  the  economic  net  present  value  (ENPV)  at  the  chosen  discount  rate  of  12%.  A  sensitivity \nanalysis  was  then  applied,  testing  the  robustness  of  the  results  to  changes  in  the  basic \nassumptions. \n \n68. \nThe results of the base case, using the assumptions noted (para. 72), return an EIRR of \n18.15%. The ENPV at a discount rate of 12% is A$3.25 million. This indicates that the Project is \na worthwhile investment for Tuvalu from an economic perspective, as it comfortably exceeds the \nEIRR discount rate of 12%. \n \n\n14 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f15 \n\nThe  New  Zealand  Maritime  School  is  the  most  realistic  overseas  training  institute  to \n69. \ncompare with as it can accommodate the extra intake of trainees, no extra investment is needed \nby the school, its curriculum is similar to TMTI, it is not subject to political unacceptance, and its \nstanding with IMO is not in jeopardy. The analysis is based on a 50 week course, including 16 \nweeks  in  Tuvalu  for  sea  training  on  the  Nivaga  II.  The  annual  fee  per  trainee,  including \naccommodation  and  2  round-trip  airfares  is  about  A$20,000  at  the  current  exchange  rate.  On \nthis basis, the total cost for 90 trainees per year is A$1.8 million. \n \nThe annual cost is just a little less than the cost of sending the trainees to New Zealand. \n70. \nHowever,  this  calculation  does  not  take  the  cultural  and  linguistic  aspects  into  consideration. \nSending  young  people  with  only  moderate  English  command  and  from  isolated  Pacific  atolls \noverseas could be problematic. \n \n71. \nThe  capital  investment  costs  of  the  Project  have  been  converted  to  their  economic \nequivalent allowing for any transfer payments, taxes and duties, and the effects of inflation. The \nincidence of taxes and duties is very low for the project capital costs, as most construction items \nare imported duty free. The only significant tax is the 2.5% sales tax, which is assumed to apply \nto most capital costs. The economic costs of the Project indicate an overall conversion factor of \n0.968  for  the  project  base  costs  of  US$2.04  million.  A  constant  exchange  rate  of \nUS$1.0=A$1.76 has been used. \n \n72. \n \n\nSome assumptions are common to the with-project and without-project situations: \n\naverage working life of approximately 15 years represented by an annual attrition \nrate  of  7%  of  the  pool  of  seafarers  per  year  with  loss  due  to  retirement, \nsuspension, and ill health; \n\nat any one time, 45% of the available pool of qualified and active seafarers are \nemployed; \n\nthe 470 seafarers employed in 2001 averaged monthly earnings of US$762 per \nmonth; and \n\nan average of 75% of total earnings is remitted back to Tuvalu. \n\n \n(iv) \n \n73. \nCash flows over a project life of 25 years were analyzed for the two scenarios. The net \nannual  benefits  increase  over  time,  reaching  over  A$3.84  million  per  year  as  the  divergence \nbetween  the  size  of  the  pool  of  available  seafarers  increases  with  time.  In  the  with-project \nsituation,  the  available  pool  of  seafarers  is  stable  at  around  1,000  (similar  to  the  present \nnumbers),  while,  in  the  without-project  situation,  the  pool  of  seafarers  reduces  by  half  over  a \nperiod of 20 years as a result of the lower number of new seafarers trained each year. \n \n\n2. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\nThe sensitivity analysis shows that the Project is robust to changes in the capital costs \n74. \nand  to  the  ongoing  operation  and  maintenance  costs  for  TMTI,  but  that  it  is  sensitive  to  the \npercentage of seafarer earnings that are remitted back to Tuvalu. It will be important for TMTI to \nensure  that  full  use  is  made  of  the  upgraded  facilities  and  that  an  increased  number  of  new \nentrants are trained each year. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n  \n \n\n\f16 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nFinancial  and  economic  analyses  are  provided  in  Appendix  9  and  detailed  in \n\n75. \nSupplementary Appendix C. Only specific aspects of the analyses are presented here. \n \n76. \nThe basic annual costs of operating TMTI in the present state are estimated to be in the \norder  of  A$630,000  per  year.  This  is  for  a  total  of  60  trainees  and  12  staff.  Training  is  also \nprovided  for  a  number  of  seamen  for  refresher and upgrading courses, which is estimated to \nmake up 15% of the training activity. Funding of the direct operating costs is fully supported by \nthe  Government,  through  scholarships  provided  to  the  60  new  trainees  per  year,  plus  an \nadditional  subsidy  to  make  up  any  shortfall  in  meeting  operating  costs.  In  the  Government\u2019s \n2001  budget  allocation,  TMTI  was  allocated  A$400,000  as  scholarships  for  60  new  trainees \n(A$6,666 per head) and an additional A$232,000 as a subsidy from the European Union funds, \nmaking a total allocation of A$632,000. \n \nThe new capital expenditure proposed for upgrading TMTI has implications for the level \n77. \nof operating expenditure and increased maintenance requirements. Without the upgrading of its \nfacilities,  TMTI  will  be  unlikely  to  maintain  its  White  List  status,  jeopardizing  the  continuing \nemployment  of  Tuvaluan  seafarers,  so  capital  expenditure  must  be  incurred  to  upgrade  the \nfacilities. In the future, the objective will be to provide adequate funding for maintenance to keep \nthe  infrastructure  in  good  condition  and  to  avoid  the  need  for  periodic  injections  of  capital  to \ncatch up with deferred maintenance.  \n \n78.  With the new infrastructure,  total annual maintenance is estimated to cost A$83,450 per \nyear  (this  includes  maintenance  for  the  extension  of  the  office  for  MD  at  the  main  wharf  on \nFongafale). This amount is considerably more than TMTI has allocated for maintenance in the \npast, and highlights the importance of adequate maintenance to ensure that the assets are kept \nin  good  condition  over  their  full  economic  life.  If  well  maintained,  the  buildings  and  houses \nshould  last  for  25  years  or  more.  The  design  of  the  new  facilities  and  buildings  incorporates \ndurable  and  noncorrosive  materials,  such  as  wood,  aluminum,  and  treated  steel,  which  are \nresistant to deterioration and corrosion\u2014a problem in the salty atmosphere at Amatuku. While \nthe cost of more durable materials adds to the overall initial capital costs, it will reduce the future \nongoing  maintenance  requirements  and  ensure  that  the  facilities  function  for  their  full  planned \neconomic life. \n \nIn  addition,  costs  for  debt  servicing  will  increase  for  TMTI  because  of  the  ADB  loan. \n79. \nAlthough TMTI may not be required to service the debt directly, it can be factored into the costs \nof running the institution to indicate the total cost and the change from the present situation. For \nexample,  the  debt  repayment  obligation  for  the  ADB  loan,  repayable  over  24  years  with  a \nnominal interest rate of 1.5%, would involve an annual debt-servicing cost of around A$183,000 \nper  year,  following  the  end  of  the  8-year  grace  period.  The  interest  of  1%  during  the  grace \nperiod would cost A$33,000 per year during the first 8 years. MES has given assurance that the \nGovernment  has  agreed  to  the  concept  of  user  fees.  Under  the  associated  TA,  options  for \nrecovering the costs of TMTI will be identified and evaluated. \n \nD. \n\nRisks \n\nProject  implementation  has  few  direct  risks,  although  some  risks  pertain  to  the  sector \n\n80. \nconcerned. These, and suggested strategies to manage risk, include the following: \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f17 \n\nFrequent turnover of Government staff or people serving in temporary positions, \nwhile  others  are  away  on  regional  travel,  presents  a  challenge  to  continuity  in \ndialogue as the Project develops.  \n\nAlthough  TMTI  is  well  on  the  way  to  full  corporatization  and  greater  autonomy, \nthe process with Shipping Services may be slower. The integrity of the  Nivaga II \nand its availability for training TMTI trainees would benefit from the  separation of  \nShipping Services from MD, and the increased efficiency of these services. \n\nStaff currently employed by TMTI may change. However, the upgrading of TMTI \nand  improvement  in  living  conditions  on  the  island  will  probably  be  a  significant \nincentive for all current staff to remain. \n\nPoor  weather  may  interfere  with  the  construction  schedule.  This  risk  will  be \nassumed by the contractors. \n\nThe Australian dollar may strengthen against the US dollar, which would reduce \nthe purchasing power of the loan. \n\nThe Nivaga II may not be available for training (if it is out of commission or not \ncertified for passenger service). This is being addressed in the associated TA. \n\n \n(vii)  Global demand for deck and engine room ratings may decline over the next few \nyears,  which  would  reduce  employment  opportunities  for  Tuvaluan  seafarers. \nThe  increase  in  alcohol-related  dismissals  exacerbates  this  potential  problem. \nUpgrading  TMTI  and  the  quality  of  Tuvaluan  seafarers  will  be  positive  steps  in \naddressing  this  risk.  TOSU  is  providing  awareness  sessions  for  Tuvaluan \nseafarers to address the alcohol problem. \n\n \n(viii)  The incidence of HIV/AIDS in Tuvalu is increasing. Tuvaluan seafarers, like those \nelsewhere,  are  at  high  risk  of  HIV  infection;  the  issue  is  more  of  a  concern  in \nTuvalu  than  elsewhere,  since  about  half  the  male  population  of  Tuvalu  works \noverseas at some point.  \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n81. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal document: \n \n\nCounterpart  funds.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  accorded \nhigh  priority  and  that  adequate  funds  are  allocated  for  disbursement  for  project \nactivities beginning in 2002 and for subsequent years, and that procedures are in \nplace  for  timely  releases  of  funds  for  project  activities  throughout  Project \nimplementation. \n\nTMTI  management.

The  Government  will  ensure \nthat \nimplementation  of  the  Project,  and  the  overall  benefits  derived  therefrom,  are \nmonitored  and  evaluated  on  an  annual  basis  in  accordance  with  a  program \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n\nEnvironment. With  respect  to  the  infrastructure  components  of  the  Project,  the \nGovernment will comply with all applicable national and local environmental laws, \ncomply  with  all  applicable  ADB  environmental  guidelines,  and  ensure  that  any \nadverse  environmental  impacts  related  to  the  construction  and  operation  of  the \nfacilities  under  the  Project  are  minimized  through  appropriate  mitigation \nmeasures.  \n\nLand.

The  following  details \nprovide  evidence  of  the  social  importance  of  TMTI  and  the  Tuvaluan  seafarers  to  provide a \ncontext for the proposed loan and to inform the poverty impact analysis. \n\n3. \nAn  abundance  of  data  is  now  available  on  the  overall  economic  situation  in  Tuvalu, \nprovided  in  the  1997  Economic  Report  for  Tuvalu  (Asian  Development  Bank  [ADB]),  the  ADB \nCountry Assistance Plan (for 2001\u20132003), and the recent results of the Project Monitoring and \nEvaluation  exercise  (the  ADB-supported  Island  Development  Program).  Relevant  data  from \nthese  reports  have  been  reworked  and  interpreted  to  highlight  the  link  between  TMTI,  the \nseafarer remittances, and the economies of the outer islands\u2014the specific focus of this social \nanalysis. \n\nB. \n\nTuvaluan Seafarers and Their Potential Contribution to the Outer Islands \n\nMost Tuvaluan seafarers come from the outer islands (almost 60%,  with only 10% from \n4. \nFunafuti;  30%  of  Tuvaluan  seafarers  were  born  outside  Tuvalu.  Nanumea,  Nukufetau, \nNukulaelae,  and  Niutao  especially  have  a  very  strong  reliance  on  remittances  for  income. \nIncome from wages, salaries, and business (combined) does not equal the income provided by \nremittances.  Clearly,  the  level  of  government  service  (and  related  job  opportunities)  and  the \nextent of business opportunities are both limited on these outer islands. \n\n5. \nLess than 15% of the income on any of the outer islands can be tied directly to resource-\nbased activity, such as fishing, farming, or production of handicrafts. With such limited scope for \nbusiness  income,  limited  opportunities  for  wages  and  salaries,  and  an  increasing  demand  for \nproducts  that  require  cash  (moving  away  from  a  subsistence  economy),  the  seafarer \nremittances  are  relied  on  to  provide  the  products  and  commodities  that  must  be  purchased \nabroad,  and  to  fund  increasingly  expensive  services,  such  as  electricity  and  good  quality \neducation (usually outside Tuvalu). Remittances are allocated in 3 basic categories (i) food and \nother  such  consumables,  (ii)  support  to  social  services  (church  and  education),  and  (iii)  what \ncan  be  considered  luxury  goods  (high  technology,  energy  consumptive  goods,  compared  with \ntraditional  materials  and  goods).  With  the  exception  of  support  to  the  church,  most  financial \nsupport  provided  by  seafarers  is  directed  at  their  specific  families.  Without  tax  revenue  from \nseafarer remittances, the poorer groups in Tuvaluan society cannot be immediate beneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n35\n\nof  seafaring  activity,  even  though  the  Government  subsidizes  the  training  of  seafarers,  which \ncan be viewed as reinforcement of a preferential, or even elitist, benefit  \n\n6. \nThe data for shipment of cargo and movement of passengers between Funafuti and the \nouter islands suggest that the island groups are very similar. The central islands (Vaitupu, Nui, \nand  Nukufetau)  consistently  show  slightly  higher  volumes  per  capita  of  cargo  and  fuel \nshipments  compared  with  the  other  island  groups,  but  the  overall  range  of  cargo  shipped  per \ncapita for all the islands is only 0.04 to 0.08 cubic meters (m3) per month. The least amount of \ncargo shipped from Funafuti (on a per capita basis) is to Nukulaelae and Nuilakita. The amount \nof fuel shipped shows a similar small range per capita: 0.004-0.007 tons per capita per month, \nwith the highest volumes going to the Central Group. Both outgoing cargo and fuel shipments \nshowed  slight  increases  in  2000  compared  with  1999.  This  may  reflect,  to  some  extent,  the \nincreased level of remittances in 2000, but this cannot be ascertained for sure. The highest level \nof  interisland  travel  per  capita  occurs  between  the  Southern  Group  of  islands  (mostly \nNukulaelae)  and  Funafuti.  The  least  amount  of  travel  per  capita  is  evident  in  the  Northern \nGroup,  probably  reflecting  the  more  remote  location  of  these  islands  and  atolls.  Overall, \napproximately  one  in  two  people  from  the  outer  islands  travel  at  least  once  per  year  between \ntheir home island and Funafuti. \n\n7. \nAccording to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  Pacific Development \nReport (1999), Tuvalu has the lowest per capita gross domestic product (GDP) (US$1,157) and \nthe  lowest  human  development  index  among  the  Polynesian  countries.  Fifty  percent  of  the \npopulation has less than $I cash income per day.  Using this measure of poverty (which is not \nstrictly correct, since most families in Tuvalu have land and access to fish), the level of poverty \nin  the  outer  islands  is  three  times  higher  than  in  Funafuti.  The  disparity  in  net  cash income \nbetween Funafuti and the outer islands reflects the relatively high incidence of government jobs \non  Funafuti,  whereas  job  and  business  opportunities  on  the  outer  islands  are  much  more \nlimited. The more disadvantaged groups (the old, the very young, and women) are concentrated \non  the  outer  islands,  reflecting  emigration  of  younger  workers  to  Funafuti  and  the  overseas \nemployment of almost half the men from the outer islands. \n\n8. \nLand is at a premium throughout Tuvalu, with about 90% held by private landowners, so \narea  for  investment  and  expansion  of  services  is  limited.  In  1996,  the  population  density  on \nFunafuti  was  1,756  people  per  square  kilometers,  reflecting  emigration  from  the  outer  islands, \nfurther  splitting  of  family  land  area  in  Funafuti,  and  increase  in  household  size.  Population \ndensity  in  the  outer  islands  is  about  one  fifth  to  one  quarter  what  it  is  in  Funafuti.  One  of  the \nmain concerns of the Government is to increase the welfare and level of economic activity in the \nouter islands, and at the same time reduce the pressures on land and services in Funafuti. \n\n9. \nSeveral recent initiatives are addressing the disparities between Funafuti and the outer \nislands. In the first instance, the Falekaupule Trust Fund (FTF) has been set up, owned by the \neight  island  communities.  The  FTF  is  supported  by  the  Island  Development  Program  (IDP), \nwhich is funded by ADB. In the second instance, electricity is now available on all the islands, \nprovided by the Tuvalu Electricity Corporation, and backed up with solar power units and private \ngenerators. Community fisheries centers have been set up on three of the islands. In a recent \nsurvey  (IDP,  2000),  most  outer  islands  noted  an  adequate  level  of  water  storage  and  supply \n(under most conditions), availability of flush and water seal toilets, and access to electricity. \n\nNevertheless,  survey  respondents  noted  many  areas  for  improvement.  The  required \n10. \nimprovements,  as  seen  by  outer  islanders,  fall  into  the  categories  of  public  services  and \ninfrastructure,  environment,  and  private  infrastructure.  Health,  education,  and  shipping \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\ndeficiencies in the outer islands might best be handled by FTF projects, or government-funded \ninitiatives, where these require government policy support and strategic interventions that have \nthe  most  benefit  per  capita.  The  suggested  improvements  that  might  be  funded  by  seafarers \nand their families include \n\n(i) \n\nimprove  water  supplies  at  the  individual  level,  or  supported  as  a  community \ninitiative; \n\n(ii) \n\nimprove housing, which can be considered a private investment; \n\nincrease  investment  in  business,  assuming  that  demand  is  adequate  for  certain \ncommodities and services and competition can be ensured; \n\nimprove agriculture (perhaps improve technology or plant and animal husbandry \napproaches,  given  the  limited  land),  reducing  the  demand  for  imported, \nprocessed foods; \n\nimprove  environmental  quality,  not  necessarily  with  cash,  but  could  be  seed-\nfunded as community-based initiatives; and \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nprovide  playgrounds,  sports  facilities,  and  markets:  these  could  be  funded  or \nsupported by seafarers, and operated as community or private sector initiatives. \n\n11. \nAlthough  seafarer  remittances  play  an  important  role  in  supporting  outer  island \ncommunities, and will continue to do so, the benefits provided by remittances, which are heavily \nsubsidized by government (with free basic training initially and no tax collected on subsequent \nincome),  are  not  equitably  distributed  throughout  the  outer  islands.    To  pursue  the  policy  of \nouter  island  improvements,  the  Government  needs  to  consider  how  to  capture  some  of the \nrevenue from seafaring and use it to address the needs of marginalized members of Tuvaluan \nsociety. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty Impact \n\n12. \ndistribution of the net benefits.  This has been carried out following ADB guidelines.1  \n\nThis  section  identifies  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  main  stakeholders  and  the \n\n13. \nThe  main  benefit  from  the  Project  is  that  it  will  maintain  the  pool  of  international \nseafarers  and  ensure  that  the  earnings  and  level  of  remittance  income  from  this  group  are  at \nleast maintained at the current level. The without-project situation with the assumed closure of \nTMTI  would  result  in  a  decline  in  the  number  of  active  seafarers  and  a  reduction  in  overseas \nremittances over time. \n   \n\n1. \n\nDistributional Effects \n\n14. \nTable  A7  summarizes  the  distribution  of  net  economic  benefits  of  the  Project.    The \nfinancial project statement is from the point of view of TMTI.  As no fees are charged or costs \nrecovered  from  the  trainees  and  seafarers,  the  training  institute  has  no  revenue  and  is  totally \nsupported by the Government. The main economic benefit is the remittance income generated \nby the seafarers, which is used by the families and beneficiaries in the seafarers\u2019 communities. \nThe Project will result in the distribution of benefits to the communities, particularly in the outer \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2001.

Therefore,  the  beneficiaries  and  their  families  stand  to  make  a  substantial  gain  from  the \nProject  at  no  financial  cost.    In  effect,  the  Project  will  result  in  a  large  transfer  payment  to  the \nseafarers  and  their  families.    While  this  is  a  fundamental  and  accepted  aspect  of  the  Tuvalu \neconomy,  not  all  households  receive  benefit  from  remittance  income,  and  households  that  do \nnot have a family member working as a seafarer will not be as well off.  Although some informal \nmechanisms  will  be  used    to  redistribute  wealth  in  the  outer  island  communities,  through  the \nchurch  and  social  conventions  for  example,  nevertheless  the  benefits  will  not  be  shared \nequitably  by  households.    The  recovery  of  some  of  TMTI\u2019s  training  costs  through  a  user  pay \nsystem,  the  introduction  of  tax  on  overseas  earnings,  or  a  value-added tax on consumption, \nwould  allow  the  Government  to  receive  more  revenue,  which  could  be  used  to  provide  social \nservices to the portion of the community that would not share directly in the project benefits. \n \n\n8,189 \n\n100 \n\n \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Poverty Line   \n\n \n16. \nAccording  to  UNDP  Pacific  Development  Report  1999,  Tuvalu  shows  the  lowest  per \ncapita  GDP  (US$1,157)  and  the  lowest  human  development  index  (0.583)  among  the \nPolynesian  countries.    In  addition,  the  income  distribution  is  uneven,  with  the  main  atoll, \nFunafuti, receiving a greater share.  Tuvalu has no specific poverty line, but overall 50% of the \npopulation  have  less  that  US$1.0  cash  income  per  capita  per  day  and  most  families  rely  on \nsubsistence  activities  from  their  land  to  support  their  households.    The  1994  household  and \nincome expenditure survey recorded an average daily per capita income of US$2.4 per day on \nFunafuti  and  US$1.0  in  the  outer  islands.    Furthermore,  the  percentage  of  the  population  with \nless  than  US$1.0  per  day  was  higher  in  the  outer  islands  (66.5%)  than  in  Funafuti  (21.6%), \nwhile  goods  are  more  expensive  in  the  outer  islands  due  to  their  remoteness  and  transport \ncosts.  Moreover the outer islands are where the most vulnerable groups are concentrated\u2014the \nold, the very young, and women. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n3. \n\nNumber of Beneficiaries/Stakeholders \n\n17. \nAs a result of the Project, the pool of seafarers actively involved in overseas employment \nwill  be  maintained  at  the  present  level  of  1,000,  with  around  45%,  or  450,  actually  working \noverseas at any one time.  Without the Project, the pool of seafarers is expected to decline over \ntime,  through  attrition  due  to  retirement  and  other  factors,  with  the  number  of  new  seafarers \nbeing trained not sufficient to maintain the numbers.  After 25 years, the pool would be reduced \nto only 470.  \n \n18. \nThe pool of 1,000 seafarers represents about 43% of all Tuvalu males aged between 20 \nand  60  years;  an  estimated  60%  of  all  households,  or  around  6,000  people,  receive  benefits \ndirectly from the remittance income earned by the seafarers.  In the absence of the Project, this \nwill reduce over time by at least 50%, thus about 30% of the households stand to benefit directly \nfrom the Project. \n \n\n4. \n\nImpact of Benefits \n\n19. \nThe net increase in the level of remittance income due to the Project is estimated to total \nA$3  million  by  the  end  of  the  project  life.    This  is  equivalent  to  A$1,000  per  person.  No \ninformation on the distribution of poor households is available for Tuvalu, but the impact of this \ndistribution is expected to be pro-poor, as households without the benefit of seafarer remittance \nincome  will  be  worse  off,  so  any  increase  in  the  pool  of  seafarers  (or  maintaining  the  present \nnumber) must have a proportionally bigger impact on the poorer members of the community. \n \n20.  While  most  of  the  obvious  benefits  from  the  Project  are  in  a  monetary  form,  several \nnonmonetary  benefits  are  apparent.  The  improvement  in  the  standard  of  living  in  the  outer \nislands or quality of life must counteract the pressure to migrate to Funafuti and further afield. \nEmployment as a seafarer provides a combination of a tax-free, income-earning opportunity that \nfar  exceeds  the  remuneration  from  working  in  Tuvalu,  while  at  the  same  time  providing \nrelaxation  time  in  their  home  communities  between  jobs.    While  employed,  the  seafarers  are \nprovided  with  full  food  and  lodgings  that  represent  a  saving  in  consumption  costs  that  they \nwould otherwise incur if they were not at sea.   \n \n21. \nThe  use  of  remittance  income  to  purchase  construction  materials  for  building  better \nquality  housing  and  water  collection  and  storage  facilities  in  the  outer  islands  has  a  positive \nimpact on the quality of life and health.  The use of the money to pay for school fees for family \nmembers to attend school in the Fiji Islands allows their children to receive a higher standard of \neducation than they would expect to receive in Tuvalu, increasing their prospects for personal \nadvancement  and  employment,  while  at  the  same  time  relieving  government  of  some  of  its \nresponsibilities  to  provide  social  services.  More  information  about  the  use  and  impact  of \nseafarer remittances is provided in Supplementary Appendix F. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n39\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe  proposed  Project  has  undergone  a  fairly  exhaustive  environmental  screening \n1. \nprocess,  which  involved  site  visits;  consultations  with  project  stakeholders  and  beneficiaries; \nreview of documentation, charts, and photographs; and collaborative environmental design with \nthe  project  engineer.  The  process  has  been  sufficient  to  determine  all  possible  interactions \nbetween the Project and the environment at the site.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nreport. \n \nC. \n \n\nDetailed  description  of  the  Project  is  given  in  paras  20  to  23  of  the  main  text  of  this \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nProject Description \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Resources \n\n \n3. \nThere  project  has  two  locations:  TMTI  on  Amatuku  Island,  where  90%  of  the  project \nactivity  will  be  located,  and  the  existing  Marine  Department  offices  at  the  main  wharf  on \nFongafale.  Amatuku  Island  is  located  in  the  northeast  section  of  Funafuti  Atoll,  about  800 \nmeters northwest of the tip of Fongafale, the largest island in Funafuti Atoll. The island is about \n1  kilometer  long  by  200  meters  (m)  wide  (at  the  widest  point)  and  only  0.1  square  kilometers \n(km2) in area. Most of the island is only about 100 m wide and only about 1.5\u20132 m above sea \nlevel.  The  highest  point  is  only  3  m  above  sea  level.  The  lowest  point  of  the  island  is  in  the \ncenter;  this  area  occasionally  floods  during  spring  tides  and  after  a  storm  surge,  which  forces \nseawater  to  percolate  through  the  coral  rubble  fringes  around  the  island.  The  island  is \ncomposed  of  a  hard  accreted  coral  pavement  or  platform,  with  coral  rubble  and  sand \noverburden.  The  ocean  side  of  the  island  is  marked  by  a  steep  storm  berm  (about  3  m  high) \nalong a coral boulder and rubble beach, whereas the lagoon side is a more stable coral rubble \nbeach, with a few sandy pocket beaches, most notably at the southwest tip of the island. \n \n4. \nThe freshwater aquifer on Amatuku is negligible and all freshwater requirements must be \nmet by rainwater collection. The persistent winds at Amatuku Island and the sea spray from the \nocean side create a corrosive environment on the island. \n \nThe blasting and excavation of about 10,000 square meters (m2) of coral reef and flat by \n5. \nthe  Americans  during  the  war  has  resulted  in  some  erosion  of  the  rubble  beach  about  50  m \nnorth  of  the  existing  wharf  and  about  100  m  of  shore  south  of  the  wharf.  The  latter  area  has \nbeen  protected  with  gabion.  With  the  exception  of  the  erosion  on  the  lagoon  side,  induced  by \nthe reef blasting, most of the observed erosion at the tips and on the ocean side is part of the \nnormal dynamic process of a small coral island (motu). \n \nAmatuku Island is completely surrounded by fringing reef, with the exception of the area \n6. \ncleared off the wharf. This area is characterized by predominantly sand, some coral rubble, and \na few coral patches. Beyond the fringing reef on the lagoon side, water depths are typically 20\u2013\n30 m within 1\u20132 km of shore. On the ocean side, water depths drop off very suddenly. Maximum \ntidal range in Funafuti is about 2 m. Water quality at Amatuku Island is very good, as the water \nexchange over the reef rim north and south of the island is considerable during high tide. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f40 \n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nEcological Resources \n\nHuman and Economic Development and Quality of Life Issues \n\nThe  location  for  the  shipping  service  office  extension  is  the  wharf  area  on  Fongafale. \n\nAmatuku Island is quite heavily vegetated compared with other islands in Funafuti Atoll. \n\n7. \nThis area has no distinctive physical features, having been built up over the last 20 years. \n \n \n \n8. \nForest cover is estimated at 80%. Amatuku Island has no mangrove trees. \n \nThe only birds which might nest on Amatuku are the white tern and the black-naped tern. \n9. \nThe only terrestrial animals that are known to live on Amatuku Island are lizards. Pigs are kept \nin pens at the northern tip of the island. \n \nThe island is surrounded by a fringing reef, except in the area near the wharf. Live coral \n10. \ncover  in  the  rubble  areas  near  the  wharf  is  only  about  5%.  The  reef  flat  on  the  lagoon  side  is \nabout 100 m wide and defined by a narrow reef slope at about 5 m water depth. On the ocean \nside, the reef, being much more exposed, is characterized by a spur-and-groove formation. The \nreef flat on the lagoon side is not that productive, with only a few small coral patches. \n \n \n \nThe situation on Amatuku Island, being dedicated to specialized postsecondary training, \n11. \nis  artificial,  compared  with  all  the  other  islands  in  Tuvalu,  and  standard  descriptions  of  human \nand economic development do not apply. All residents are either salaried and provided for, or \nfully subsidized by the Government as trainees, and also provided for. \n \n12. \nThe land occupied by TMTI is on long-term government lease from private landowners. \nNo apparent issues are  related to the lease. The southern end of Amatuku Island (about 100 m \nlong) is still privately held and the motu immediately to the north is also in private hands. \n \n13. \nAt  the  other  project  location,  the  Marine  Department  located  at  the  main  wharf,  office \nconditions  can  be  described  as  cramped,  dark,  hot,  and  not  at  all  suited  to  effective  and \nproductive  work.  Despite  these  conditions,  the  port  and  shipping  services  for  Tuvalu  are \ndelivered. The proposed upgrading of these offices will greatly enhance working conditions for \nshipping service staff. \n \nD.        Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n14. \nThe  Project  will  only  increase  the  building  footprints  (land  area  occupied  by  the \nbuildings)  of  the  residential  and  training  areas  by  8%.  The  buildings  will  be  built  within  the \nexisting compound of the training center. No additional land lease will be required. Four coconut \npalm trees will be cut down. The office extension of the Marine Department will use the present \nlocation  and  will  involved  refurbishment  of  the  existing  office  space  and  addition  of  a  second \nstory extension. The wharf will be built in a sandy area at least 40 m from the nearest reef flat. \n \nDuring construction the residents and students will be inconvenienced by the noise from \n15. \nthe construction activities and may have to move around the existing and completed facilities for \nsafety reasons especially when the additional storys are built. To minimize the inconvenience, \nthe  construction  activities  are  staged  over  a  2-year  period  allowing  completion  and  use  of  a \nbuilding prior to renovation of the next building.  This problem is short term and temporary. Once \nthe rehabilitation is completed, the residents and students will have better training facilities, and \nutilities  such  as  water  supply,  toilets,  electricity,  and  communications.  The  existing  septic \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n41\n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\nsystems will be expanded. Part of the electricity supply will use solar cells. With the additional \nboarding  facilities,  trainees  and  staff  will  no  longer  have  to  commute  between  Amatuku  and \nFongafale.  During  reconstruction  of  the  wharf  facilities,  temporary  boat  loading  and  unloading \nfacilities will be established. The temporary facilities are expected to be in use for 3 to 4 months. \nConstruction  crew  and  laborers  will  be  recruited  from  the  local  population.  The  construction \ncrew is estimated to range from 20 to 30 persons. Waste materials from the construction site as \nwell as demolition debris will be disposed of at the landfill site in Fongafale. \n \nThe  environmental  impacts  during  operation  of  the  facilities  are  mostly  positive, \n16. \nspecifically  on  improved  safety  and  health  conditions  in  the  houses,  dormitories,  and  training \nfacilities.  \n \nE. \n \n17. \nNo specific environmental monitoring program has been designed, since the engineering \ndesign  and  the  proposed  construction  techniques  and  implementation  schedule  will  be \ncontractual  requirements  of  the  successful  contract  bidder.  The  independent  consulting \nengineer  will  ensure,  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  that  all  environmental  management \ncovenants are adhered to. Upon completion of the construction activities, TMTI will assume full \nresponsibility for operation of the facilities on Amatuku Island, and will adhere to the proposed \nenvironmental management practices noted in this document (Supplementary Appendix E). \n \nF. \n \nThis  initial  environmental  examination  has  determined  that  the  proposed  upgrading  of \n18. \nTMTI,  and  extension  of  shipping  services  offices,  can  be  constructed  and  operated  with  no \nsignificant  negative  environmental  and  social  impacts,  and  that  environmental  and  social \nbenefits  should  result  from  proper  operation  of  the  facilities.  This  Project  can  be  classified  as \nCategory B (relatively small scale), not requiring an environmental impact assessment. Subject \nto the implementation of specified mitigation measures, the Project should be able to proceed \nwithout any significant negative effects. \n \n \n\nConclusions \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 9 \n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES \n\nGeneral Assumptions  \n\n \nA. \n \nProject  costs  are  estimated  based  on  the  prices  current  in  October  2001  and  are \n1. \nexpressed in A$, the currency used in Tuvalu, but have been adjusted to the most updated US$ \nexchange rate of US$1.0 = A$1.76. The appreciation of the Australian dollar  over the American \ndollar  during  the  first  half  of  2002  naturally  has  implications  for  the  project  costs,  but  the \nsufficient contingencies should counter any shortfall. The total project baseline cost is estimated \nat about US$2.1 million. The allowance for  price contingencies over the 3-year implementation \nperiod is 2.4% for foreign costs and 2.5% for local costs per year. Physical contingencies vary \nfrom  5.0%  to  27.5%  for  the  various  items  of  infrastructure  and  equipment  according  to  the \ndegree of uncertainty in estimating their costs. Total estimated Project cost, including physical \nand  price  contingencies  and  interest  and  commitment  charges,  is  US$2.3  million.  The  Project \nwill be implemented over 24 months.   \n \n2. \ntraining; this is expected to continue in the future. \n \n(i) \n\nCurrently, Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI) conducts three classes of maritime \n\nA  1-year  residential  basic  training  course  is  available  for  new  entrants  before \nemployment at sea.  Currently TMTI takes in 60 trainees per year in three intakes of 20; \nnormally  50  complete  the  course  and  graduate.    Four  months  is  spent  undergoing  sea \ntraining on the Nivaga II. \n\nUpgrade courses of 3 weeks duration are provided for basic fire fighting, safety, and sea \nsurvival training.  This course is normally provided once during the career of a seafarer \nwithin the first 2 to 3 years of employment. The upgrade allows the seafarers to move up \nthe pay scale and receive an immediate increase in pay.   \n\nRevalidation and refresher course are available for seafarers. Each seafarer is required \nto  revalidate  his  certificate  every  5  years  to  maintain  his  employment  status  under  the \nConvention  on  Standards  of  Training,  Certification,  and  Watchkeeping  of  1995  (STCW \n95). The course normally lasts 1 week and involves fire fighting, sea safety and tanker \nskills, with the objective to refresh the seafarers skills allowing for changes in technology \nand  competency  requirements.  On  average,  around  150\u2013200  seafarers  require \nrevalidation per year. \n\n \n3. \nThe  main  benefit  from  the  Project  is  that  it  will  allow  TMTI  to  continue  to  be  an \naccredited maritime training institution maintaining its White List status. Sometime before 2005, \nthe  International  Maritime  Organization  (IMO)  will  conduct  its  external  audit  of  all  maritime \nschools around the world. TMTI's accreditation to the White List was primarily based on a desk \nappraisal conducted by TMTI. A regional inspection by the maritime division of the Secretariat of \nthe Pacific Community (SPC) was carried out in May 2002. TMTI must be seen as addressing \nits teaching and training deficiencies right now to show IMO that its external inspection should \nbe conducted at the appropriate time. The economic benefits from the Project can be expressed \nas  the  difference  in  remittances  from  a  constant  pool  of  1,000  seafarers,  of  which  45%  are \nactive, over a declining number in the pool because fewer Tuvaluans can be trained overseas. \nIn this case, the with-project situation is the continuing operation of TMTI with an increase in the \nnumber  of  trainees  that  graduate  each  year  and  the  provision  of  upgrading  and  revalidation \ncourse to the pool of 1,000 active seafarers. The without-project situation is that TMTI loses its \nWhite List status, is no longer an accredited maritime training institute and  has to close down. \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n43\n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nThe Government would then be faced with having to send its young men to a suitable training \ninstitution overseas. Upgrade and revalidation short courses would also have to be conducted \noverseas. The result would be that a reduced number  of Tuvaluans would be trained and that \nthe pool of trained seafarers would reduce over time, as they retire or give up employment as \nseafarers, with a consequent reduction in the amount of their earnings remitted back to Tuvalu. \n \nB. \n \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  for  the  rehabilitation  and  upgrade  of  TMTI  has \n4. \nbeen  carried  out  following  the  normal  benefit-cost  analysis  methodology  based  on  the  with-\nproject  minus  without-project  scenario  to  indicate  the  net  economic  benefits  to  the  Tuvalu \neconomy  over  the  life-span  of  the  Project,  which  is  assumed  to  be  25  years.  Economic \nperformance is measured by the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and the economic net \npresent  value  at  the  chosen  discount  rate  of  12%.  A  sensitivity  analysis is applied to test the \nrobustness of the results to changes in the basic assumptions. \n \nThe capital investment costs are converted to their economic equivalent allowing for any \n5. \ntransfer  payments,  taxes  and  duties,  and  the  effects  of  inflation.  The  incidence  of  taxes  and \nduties is very low for the project capital costs, as most construction items are imported duty free. \nThe only significant tax is the 2.5% sales tax, which is assumed to apply to most capital costs. \nThe  economic  costs  of  the  Project,  produced  as  an  output  from  COSTAB,  indicate  an  overall \nconversion factor of 0.968 for the project baseline costs of US$2.04 million.  \n \n6. \nA  least-cost  analysis  was  carried  out  to  compare  the  costs  with  a  realistic  overseas \ntraining institution. In this analysis, only New Zealand has been compared as the only realistic \nalternative. The training school in Kiribati is political unacceptable to the Government of Tuvalu. \nThe  maritime  training  college  in  The  Fiji  Islands  has  also  been  left  out  of  the  analysis,  as  it \nwould  require  considerable  investment  to  accept  additional  seafarers.  The  maritime  training \nschool  in  Madang,  Papua  New  Guinea,  only  caters  for  education  at  officer  level.  The \nPhilippines, with the most maritime training institutes in the region, has also been discounted as \nan  option,  as  the  number  of  training  schools  not  meeting,  or  will  not  be  able  to  meet  the  IMO \nstandards, are expected to be considerable and hence the country have much less capacity to \naccept  trainees  from  abroad.  The  opportunity  cost  of  the  trainees  time  while  receiving  their \ntraining is assumed to be zero as employment opportunities for young men in Tuvalu are very \nlimited. \n  \n7. \n \n \n\nThe result of the least cost analysis is shown in Table A9.1 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 9 \n\n      Govt. contribution \n      15% \n          Subtotal \n    Operating Costs \n     Salaries, Admin. & \n         Management \n     Maintenance \n     Equipment \n\nReplacement \n\n               Total (A) \n \nNet Present Value @ \n12% =9,470.57 \n \nB.

In  the \nwith-project  situation,  the  available  pool  of  seafarers  is  stable  at  around  1,000,  similar  to  the \npresent numbers, while in the without-project situation the pool of seafarers reduces by half over \n20 years as a result of the lower number of new seafarers trained each year. Consequently, net \neconomic benefits will increase over time to reach A$3.8 million per year after 25 years, as the \ndivergence between the size of the pool of available seafarers increases with time. An average \nmonthly wage of US$762 for a Tuvaluan seafarer has been used based on the records from the \nGerman  shipping  agents  based  in Tuvalu. These same records show that on average 75% of \nthese wages are remitted back to Tuvalu. \n \nThe  results  of  the  base  case,  using  the  assumptions  noted  above  returns  an  EIRR  of \n9. \n18.15%.

This \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n45\n\nindicates that the Project is a worthwhile investment for Tuvalu from an economic perspective, \nas it exceeds the EIRR hurdle of 12%.

The percentage of seafarer earnings that are remitted back to Tuvalu \nis  an  important  variable.  It  will  be  important  for  TMTI  to  ensure  that  full  use  is  made  of  the \nupgraded facilities and that the expected number of new entrants are trained each year. \n \nC. \n \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nC. \n\nImpact of Increased Trainee Numbers \n\n12. \nIn  assessing  the  impact  of  the  proposed  upgrading  program  on  the  annual  operating \nexpenditure, two situations were investigated. The first is the continuation of the same number \nof new entrants as at present (60 trainees full time per year for their pre-sea training), plus 150 \ntrained seafarers for short-term refresher courses. The second situation or scenario investigated \nis an increase in new entrants by 50% to a total of 90 trainees per year, plus the same quota of \n150  seafarers  attending  refresher  courses  (demand-supply  analysis  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix D). \n \n\nD. \n\nMaintenance at Present Levels of Trainee Numbers \n\n13. \nThe  main  impact  on  the  operating  budget  will  be  the  implication  of  increased \nmaintenance arising from the capital expenditure for rehabilitation and upgrading to ensure that \nthe new infrastructure and equipment is kept in good condition. It can also be assumed that the \nstaffing levels will be maintained at the required level to meet the training needs, which implies \nthat  any  current  vacancies  are  filled,  such  as  the  position  for  a  remedial  English  teacher,  and \nthat consumable materials for teaching are kept up to date and replenished as needed.  For this \nscenario,  the  proposed  budget  for  2001  that  was  prepared  by  TMTI  indicates  the  likely \nexpenditure  and  funding  required,  with  the  addition  of  increased  maintenance.  Under  this \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n47\n\nscenario  the  annual  budget  for  TMTI  will  be  about  A$450,000,  plus  whatever  extra  salary \npackage top-ups are required for the contracted expatriate staff. \n \n\nE. \n\nIncreased Number of Trainees \n\n14. \nIncreasing  the  number  of  new  trainees  by  50%  from  the  present  60  per  year  to  90  will \nincrease the operating costs of TMTI, through the increase in teaching resources and staff and \nthe direct cost of the residential trainees\u2014food, uniforms, and allowances.  An analysis of the \ncurrent  operating  expenses  for  TMTI  and  the  projected  budget  for  2002  indicates  that  the  full \ncomplement of teaching staff costs (with no vacant positions) would cost A$107,000 per year, \nwhile  the  other  training  expenses  cost  a  total  of  A$102,000,  allowing  for  food,  clothing, \nallowances, and materials, making a total of A$209,000.  \n \n15. \nThe average cost per trainee (the direct training costs that are related to the number of \ntrainees) is A$3,483 per trainee per year. The present staff complement at full strength, with the \naddition  of  one  more  marine  instructor,  is  considered  to  be  an  adequate  teaching  resource  to \ntrain  the  increased  number  of  90  trainees.  Adding  one  more  instructor  would  increase  the \nteaching  staff  costs  to  an  estimated  A$117,000  per  year.  The  other  costs  (rations,  uniforms, \nmaterials, etc.) could be expected to increase in direct proportion to the current costs by 50%. \nConsequently,  direct  training  costs  would  increase  to  A$270,000  per  year. Combined with the \nother  cost  items,  the  overall  budget  for  TMTI  with  the  increased  number  of  trainees  would \nincrease to A$499,200. \n \n16. \nThe increased number of trainees would increase the basic operating costs of TMTI to \nalmost A$500,000 per year, compared with the comparable cost of around A$400,000 per year \nin the present situation. \n \n17. \nIn  addition,  costs  for  debt  servicing  will  increase  for  TMTI  because  of  the  ADB  loan. \nAlthough TMTI may not be required to service the debt directly, it can be factored  into the costs \nof running the institution to indicate the total cost and the change from the present situation. For \nexample,  the  debt  repayment  obligation  for  the  ADB  US$1.85  million  loan  (A$3.3  million) \nrepayable  over  24  years  with  a  nominal  interest  rate  of  1.5%,  would  involve  an  annual  debt-\nservicing  cost  of  A$175,000  per  year  following  the  end  of  the  8-year  grace  period.  The \ncommitment fee of 1% during the grace period would cost around A$33,000 per year during the \nfirst 8 years. \n \nThe  other  important  issue  is  the  support  for  the  top-up of the employment package for \n18. \nthe expatriate staff, particularly for the Captain Superintendent position, which is currently being \nfunded  by  the  New  Zealand  Overseas  Development  Assistance  program.  New  Zealand  is  not \ncommitted  to  continue  to  fund  this  position  indefinitely,  and  alternative  sources  of  finding  will \nprobably  be  required  to  continue  to  fund  this  position  at  the  present  level  of  support.  The \nsituation  with  the  other  two  positions,  which  are  staffed  by  expatriates, is more secure as the \nchief  officer  position  is  filled  by  the  employment  agencies  and  the  chief  engineer  position  is \nsupported internally by TMTI. Ideally, TMTI should be able to fund its staff complement without \nhaving to rely on external assistance. \n \n\nF. \n\nMaintenance Costs \n\nThe new capital expenditure proposed for upgrading TMTI has implications for the level \n19. \nof operating expenditure and increased maintenance requirements. Without the upgrading of its \nfacilities,  TMTI  will  be  unlikely  to  be  able  to  maintain  its  White  List  status,  jeopardizing  the \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 9 \n\nis  estimated \n\nTotal  annual  maintenance \n\nto  be  US$80,000  per  year, \n\ncontinuing  employment  of  Tuvaluan  seafarers;  so,  the  only  option  is  to  incur  the  capital \nexpenditure  for  upgrading  the  facilities.  In  the  future,  the  objective  will  be  to  allocate  sufficient \nfunds  to  maintenance  to  keep  the  infrastructure  in  good  condition  and  avoid  the  need  for \nperiodic  injections  of  capital  to  catch  up  with  deferred  maintenance.  The  proposed  capital \nexpenditure  budget  of  US$2.3  million  (A$4  million),  which  will  be  mostly  made  up  of  buildings \nand housing, will require TMTI to commit to a more realistic maintenance program to maintain \nthe new infrastructure.  \n \nincluding \n20. \nmaintenance for the extension of the office for the marine department at the main wharf. This is \nconsiderably  more  than  TMTI  has  allocated  for  maintenance  in  the  past,  and  highlights  the \nimportance of adequate maintenance to ensure that the assets are maintained in good condition \nover their full economic life. If well maintained, the buildings and houses should last for 25 years \nor  more.  The  order  of  maintenance  expenditure  indicated  in  the  table  will  probably  not  be \nrequired  every  year,  especially  while  the  facilities  are  new,  but  an  important  issue  for  the \noperation  of  the  institute  is  that  sufficient  funds  should  be  available  for  maintenance  when \nneeded.  The  design  of  the  new  facilities  and  buildings  incorporates  durable  and  noncorrosive \nmaterials  such  as  wood,  aluminium,  and  treated  steel  that  is  resistant  to  deterioration through \nexposure to salt air in the very corrosive environment of Amatuku where TMTI is situated. While \nthe  cost  of  more  durable  materials  adds  to  the  initial  capital  costs,  it  will  reduce  the  future \nongoing maintenance requirements, and ensure that the facilities function for their full planned \neconomic life. \n  \n21. \nTMTI  has  recently  proposed  the  introduction  of  a  user-pay  system  for  its  training  and \nespecially for its revalidation courses. The Government has in principle agreed to such a system \nbeing introduced. TMTI is expected to be the first institution to introduce the user-pay system in \n2003.  \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 August 2002) \n", "                  Currency Unit \n                             A$1.00 \n                          US$1.00 \n", "Australian dollar (A$) \nUS$0.5636 \nA$1.774 \n", " \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "ADB \nEIRR \nFTF \nGDP \nHIV/AIDS \n \nIEE \nIMO \nMD \nMES \nPMU \nSPC \nSTCW 95 \n \nTA \nTMTI \nTOSU \n \n", "Falekaupule \nRatings \n", "White List \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \neconomic internal rate of return \nFalekaupule Trust Fund \ngross domestic product \nhuman  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immune  deficiency \nsyndrome \ninitial environmental examination \nInternational Maritime Organization \nMarine Department \nMinistry of Education and Sports \nproject management unit \nSecretariat of the Pacific Community \nConvention on Standards of Training, Certification, and \nWatchkeeping of 1995 \ntechnical assistance \nTuvalu Maritime Training Institute \nTuvalu Overseas Seamen\u2019s Union \n", "is  essentially  a  naval \n", "GLOSSARY \n \nLocal government, district \nto \nRating \nnoncommissioned sailors; in general usage it refers to the \ncrew of a vessel, other than officers. \nA  term  of  no  legal  standing  that  indicates  if  a  nation  is \ndeemed  to  be  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of \nSTCW 95. \n", "referring \n", "term \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \nThe fiscal year of the Government of Tuvalu and its agencies ends on 31 December.   \n \n", "NOTE \n", "This  Report  was  prepared  by  a  team  consisting  of:  T.
