THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Financial Markets Development Program, and (ii) a proposed \npolicy-based loan (PBL) to the Republic of Uzbekistan for subprogram 1 of the Financial Markets \nDevelopment  Program.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nSupporting the Financial Markets Development Program, and if the Board approves the proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed program will support demand and supply measures to broaden and deepen \nthe financial system in Uzbekistan to facilitate effective intermediation. It will support policy, \nregulatory, and institutional (including market infrastructure) reforms necessary to create an \nenabling environment for competitive financial markets in line with the government\u2019s Strategy on \nActions for Further Development of Uzbekistan (2017\u20132021) and follow-on Roadmap of Reforms \n(2019\u20132021),1 Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy (CPS) for Uzbekistan, \n2019\u20132023,2 and the ADB country operations business plan for Uzbekistan, 2021\u20132023.3 The \nprogrammatic approach, comprising two subprograms, will help sequence reforms over a 4-year \ntimeframe (2019\u20132023) and provide flexibility to incorporate changes if warranted (para. 19). TA \nattached with the program\u2019s concept paper approval in 2019 supported reform measures from \n2019 to 2021.4 With its emphasis on creating an enabling environment for financial market \ndevelopment, the program design is robust and fits well with the country\u2019s needs as a growing \nand economically diversifying economy. The attached TA will assist in implementing the program. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n3.  The Government of Uzbekistan has accelerated its transition toward a market economy \nwith the adoption of the Strategy on Actions for Further Development of Uzbekistan (2017\u20132021) \nand follow-on Roadmap of Reforms (2019\u20132021) (footnote 1). Both the strategy and the road map \nrecognize the central role played by the banking sector and financial markets in fostering this \ntransition. The Roadmap of Reforms tasks the government with modernizing and developing \nfinancial markets to better address the financing needs of the real economy, which is moving \naway from a state-led and state-dominated economy towards a market-oriented, private sector-\nled model.5 Underdeveloped financial markets have contributed to the ineffective mobilization of \nsavings with gross domestic savings at 31% of gross domestic product (GDP), which is lower \nthan regional peers such as Kazakhstan (42% of GDP). The introduction of market-based \ninstruments, backed by a sound enabling environment for competitive financial markets, will \nmobilize private sector financing and help the private sector become the driver of sustainable \neconomic growth. \n \n \n1  Government of Uzbekistan. 2017.

Manila. \n5  The Government of Uzbekistan\u2019s issuance of $1 billion of Eurobonds on 13 February 2019 on the London Stock \nExchange  reflects  the  confidence  exhibited  by  investors  in  the  country\u2019s  economic  fundamentals,  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s political will to carry out its reform program. It was preceded by the country\u2019s first sovereign credit rating \nby S&P Global Ratings, Fitch Ratings (BB-), and Moody\u2019s Investors Service (B1) in December 2018\u2013February 2019. \n \n ", "2 \n4.  Uzbekistan  maintained  a  record  of  sound  macroeconomic  management,  achieving \naverage GDP growth of 6.8% during 2010\u20132019, driven by growth in industry and services, the \nprivate sector, commodity exports, and foreign investment. A conservative fiscal and debt policy \nhas led to a low risk of debt stress, even with the impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \n(para. 22). With the global economic recession brought on by COVID-19, Uzbekistan\u2019s GDP \ngrowth for 2020 declined to 1.6% in 2020,6 from a pre\u2013COVID-19 forecast of 6%, but growth is \nprojected to rebound to 5% in 2021. Uzbekistan\u2019s merchandise exports, which grew at 20.2% in \n2019, contracted by 15.4% in 2020, but are projected to grow at 19.8% in 2021.7 The fiscal deficit \nwidened to 4.4% in 2020 from 3.9% in 2019 with lower revenues and increasing expenditures, \nincluding countercyclical spending, and is projected to reach 5.5% in 2021. Global risk aversion \nincreased the cost to Uzbekistan of accessing global financial markets. The yield to maturity on \nUzbekistan\u2019s sovereign bond increased by 160 basis points from May 2019 to March 2020.8 \nAlthough the yield to maturity declined by almost 3% from March 2020 to April 2021, it is evident \nthat volatility pervades in global financial markets. As a result, development of robust and \ncompetitive domestic financial markets is even more critical as an indispensable tool for mobilizing \nprivate investment and minimizing the impact of such external shocks. The program will aid in the \nCOVID-19 recovery phase through subprogram 1 reforms that facilitate mobilization of savings \nsuch as on-boarding of new retail investors through simplified \u201cknow your customer\u201d (KYC) \nprocedures with biometric verification. The government is aware of the need to implement crucial \nreforms so that domestic financial markets can better intermediate savings and investments to \ndrive sustainable economic growth, and help mitigate impact of exogenous shocks. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 prioritizes the development of the finance sector and financial \nmarkets  in  order  to  support  sustainable  economic  development  by  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment for private investment.9 Private investment is also identified as a key driver of \neconomic  growth  and  a  source  of  employment  generation  during  Uzbekistan\u2019s  economic \ntransition, and a strategic area for ADB\u2019s support in the CPS (footnote 2). The program will not \nonly support private sector expansion but also contribute to the operational priorities of (i) \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity through specific institutional strengthening \nreforms, and (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality through reforms that enhance female \nparticipation in the governance of financial markets. \n \n6.  Bank-dominated finance sector with ineffective intermediation. Uzbekistan\u2019s finance \nsector, dominated by banks, does not effectively play its intermediation role due to constrained \nmobilization of long-term financial resources. The economy is overly reliant on bank financing, \nwith banking sector assets accounting for 63.1% of GDP as of January 2021.10  Until 2019, the \nstate-owned  banks  pursued  government-directed  lending  programs  at  below-market  rates, \ncrowding out market pricing, and primarily lending to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The \ncountry has 32 commercial banks; 13 of which are state-owned banks, and account for more than \n \n6  International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2021.

Underdeveloped money and capital markets. The interbank money market is small and \ninactive. State-owned banks receive subsidized funds from the state, while the 19 private banks \nrely mostly on deposit funding. Money market liquidity is not managed effectively in the absence \nof  open  market  operations  and  the  lack  of  appropriate  instruments  (such  as  repurchase \nagreements and currency swaps), transactions, and pricing mechanisms.14 In the absence of \nmarket-based benchmarks, the refinancing rate of the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) is \nregarded as the sole money market price indicator, although there are practically no transactions \nwith the CBU at this rate (14% as of 15 September 2021). A well-functioning money market is the \ncornerstone of resilient financial markets and forms the basis for enhanced liquidity, pricing, and \ntenor extension of financial market instruments. \n \n8.  Uzbekistan\u2019s  domestic  capital  markets  do  not  play  a  significant  role  in  financial \nintermediation  and  resource  mobilization.  The  existing  capital  market  legal  framework  is \nfragmented, limited in scope, and does not align with international standards.15 The Securities \nMarket Law is frequently supplemented by presidential and/or ministerial decrees to cover gaps \nin market regulation. The Department of Capital Markets Development at the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) is the state regulator for the nonbank financial markets. The Uzbekistan Republican Stock \nExchange (UZRSE) lacks depth, both in the number of investors and the number of companies \nraising capital. Market capitalization of the UZRSE ($5.23 billion) accounted for only about 9.4% \nof the country\u2019s GDP in January 2021; it has 145 listed companies, and daily trading volume of \nabout $200,000, reflecting both its small-scale and low-trading liquidity.16 The UZRSE\u2019s market \ncapitalization as a percentage of GDP is below its regional peers (Kazakhstan 21%, Poland 27%, \nand the Russian Federation 39%). Fewer than 200,000 individual investors (less than 0.6% of the \npopulation) have a stock investing account. The absence of a centralized KYC procedure and \ncumbersome customer onboarding requirements impede participation of new retail investors in \nthe financial markets. Taxation of dividends also discourages investor participation because it \nreduces the return available to investors. The state owns about 86% of the shares of listed \ncompanies. The absence of women on company boards reduces investment efficiency, earnings \n \n11 More than half of total loans are shared by three state-owned banks. i.e., the National Bank of Uzbekistan (28.5%), \nUzpromstroybank (14.8%), and Ipoteka Bank (10.2%).

Largely inactive and illiquid debt market. Uzbekistan\u2019s government bond market is \nprimarily short-dated. As of June 2021, outstanding treasury bills and bonds totaled SUM3,227 \nbillion ($320 million). Volume and liquidity in longer-term government bonds is restricted with only \nthree issuances at a maximum of 3 years maturity. The government bond market does not fulfill \nits role in setting benchmark pricing because of irregular government debt management practices \narising from a debt management office (DMO) that does not yet function as a properly empowered \ntreasury operation for government bond market development. The DMO is responsible for debt \nmanagement at MOF; it has insufficient structural capacity in terms of staffing and does not \npossess a centralized database for effective cash management and planning.  The current \noperating framework of the government bond market system does not promote competitive \nbidding. Auctions of government bonds are not conducted based on a pre-announced auction \ncalendar, which prevents investors from effectively preparing for each new issue. The auction \ncutoff yields follow the policy rate (14% as of 15 September 2021), suggesting that bidding is not \nmarket-based, and hindering formulation of a credible government bond yield curve and liquid \nbond market. The absence of an effective government bond yield curve impedes the appropriate \npricing of corporate bonds, reducing their attractiveness to both issuers and investors. The \ncorporate bond market is subsequently small and narrow, constituting less than 1% of GDP, with \nonly seven corporate bonds outstanding for an aggregate nominal value of SUM190 billion ($20 \nmillion) as of January 2021. Most of these bonds were placed privately and are therefore not listed. \n \n10.  Constrained  institutional  investor  participation.  On  the  demand  side,  major \ninstitutional investors (such as insurance companies and pension funds) have a limited role in \nfinancing government and corporate bonds because of a lack of investible funds. Insurance \ncompanies prefer deposits and real estate because their investment horizon is limited to the \naverage duration of their liabilities (i.e., insurance products and policies), which averages 12 \nmonths, even for life insurance products. The national pension fund is off-balance sheet and a \npay-as-you-go defined benefit pension system operated by MOF. The pension fund has limited \ninvestment capability with only about SUM6 trillion ($563 million) of \u201cfree funds\u201d. The major \ninvestment destination is nine state-owned commercial banks, with investment in the form of \nshort-term,  6-month  bank  deposits,  thereby  limiting  the  contribution  to  financial  market \ndevelopment. Institutional investors promote the growth of market capitalization in the equity \nmarket, and their participation across the maturity spectrum of the government bond market yield \ncurve is critical to support market development. A diverse investor base also lowers debt cost and \nvolatility in market yields. \n \n11.  Fragmented financial market infrastructure. The fragmented market infrastructure \nresults in high transaction costs for investors because infrastructure for trading of listed equities \nand corporate bonds, government bonds and foreign currencies, and unlisted securities is not \nharmonized, with each having its own regulator and technology platform. Listed equities and \ncorporate bonds trade on the UZRSE, which is regulated by MOF. For the UZRSE, trades are \nsettled on the Uzbekistan Central Securities Depository (UCSD), while the National Bank for \nForeign Economic Activity of Uzbekistan acts as the settlement bank. Government bonds and \n \n17 Female board representation has shown to improve performance (e.g., return on assets, return on equity, and \nearnings per share), while reducing volatility. D. A.

Asian Business & Management.19, 438\u2013478.   \n ", "5 \nforeign currencies trade on the Uzbekistan Republican Currency Exchange, which is regulated \nby the CBU, with the CBU acting as the settlement bank. Unlisted securities trade on the Elsis \nSavdo, an over-the-counter trading platform. The post-trading market infrastructure does not \ncomply with International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) risk management \nprinciples because transactions at the UZRSE are settled at a commercial bank (i.e., the National \nBank for Foreign Economic Activity of Uzbekistan) instead of the CBU. Post-trade settlement \nthrough direct use of the CBU real-time gross settlement system for all securities enables delivery \nversus payment, which is critical to address system incongruencies and shift the market\u2019s post-\ntrading infrastructure towards international risk management standards as prescribed by the Bank \nfor  International  Settlements\u2013IOSCO  principles  for  financial  market  infrastructures.  The \nreorganization of pre-trade and post-trade infrastructure into consolidated, shared or linked \nplatforms lower transactions costs for participants and investors through economies of scale. \n \nB.  Policy Reform, ADB\u2019s Value Addition, and Sustainability \n12.  The  program  proposes  to  introduce  reform  measures  that  deepen  and  broaden \nUzbekistan\u2019s financial markets by (i) developing the public debt management framework to \npromote a more liquid government bond market; (ii) enhancing institutional investor demand by \nbroadening, deepening, and diversifying the investor base; (iii) supporting the money markets; \n(iv) developing critical market infrastructure including surveillance systems, consolidating trading \nsystems, and enhancing post-trading systems; and (v) enhancing the supply of alternative \nfinancial  instruments  such  as  exchange-traded  funds.  Consultations  with  the  government \nidentified the following reform areas. \n \n13.  Market facilitation enhanced. Reforms in this area support more efficient mobilization \nand allocation of resources in the economy by defragmenting and streamlining for efficient market \ninfrastructure, as well as strengthening the capital market legal framework. Subprogram 1 actions \ninclude (i) an approved capital market development strategy that is funded by the government to \nguide direction and implementation of capital market reforms by MOF, CBU, UCSD, the State \nAssets  Management  Agency  (SAMA),  UZRSE,  and  the  Uzbekistan  Republican  Currency \nExchange under the leadership of the advisor to the President of Uzbekistan, which ensures the \nprogram is an integral part of a government-owned long-term development strategy; (ii) adoption \nof a time-bound road map for integration of trading platforms and reorganization of UCSD \nincluding consolidation of all capital market assets (shares, government and corporate bonds, \nequities, and other financial instruments) to streamline efficient market infrastructure through \nreorganization of pre-trade and post-trade infrastructure into consolidated, shared, or linked \nplatforms to lower transactions costs for participants and investors through economies of scale; \n(iii) adoption of gender mainstreaming policies for SAMA to enhance female board representation \nby ensuring a minimum of one female director on the supervisory board of at least 10 publicly \nlisted SOEs; and (iv) adoption of an approved gender policy by UZRSE that includes minimum \nrequirements for female representation in management as well as equal remuneration and \ntraining across the organization. Subprogram 2 will include (i) preparation and endorsement of a \ndraft Capital Markets Law to the Parliament to consolidate fragmented capital markets-related \nlaws and regulations; (ii) implementation of the road map for integration of trading platforms and \nreorganization of UCSD by critically providing UCSD access to the real-time gross settlement \nsystem at the CBU, thereby making CBU the settlement bank for corporate securities; (iii) \napplication of delivery versus payment for settling trades and processing corporate transactions \nat the UCSD to streamline efficient post-trading market infrastructure; and (iv) installation of \nelectronic market surveillance system at UZRSE to prevent manipulative and illegal trading \npractices in the financial markets, thereby ensuring market integrity. \n \n \n ", "6 \n14.  Demand measures enhanced. Subprogram 1 supported the development of the demand \nside of the market as follows: (i) a draft public debt law was prepared and endorsed to the Cabinet \nof Ministers by MOF, and will serve as the legislative foundation to facilitate government bond \nmarket development through an effective public debt management framework; (ii) an e-KYC \nlegislative framework was established (a Presidential Resolution for the introduction of a digital \neconomy and e-government, and a Presidential Decree on Digital Uzbekistan 203018 were \napproved by the office of the President) to facilitate onboarding of new retail investors and \nenhance retail investor demand through a digital identification verification system for remote \naccount  opening;  (iii)  a  revised  staffing  plan  was  approved  to  strengthen  DMO\u2019s  debt \nmanagement expertise and capacity, which is critical to effectively implement the public debt \nmanagement framework and promote government bond market development; (iv) the dividend \ntax rate was reduced to encourage investor participation and enhance investor demand for \ncorporate securities, because the tax measure increases the return available to investors; and (v) \na draft law on insurance activity was submitted to Parliament to facilitate insurance market \ndevelopment  through  effective  regulatory  mechanisms  and  prudential  supervision.

Supply measures enhanced. To strengthen the supply side of the market, subprogram \n1 (i) introduced money market instruments (such as repurchase agreements and currency swaps) \nto develop a foundation for resilient financial markets by ensuring well-functioning money markets \nwith enhanced liquidity, pricing, and tenor of financial market instruments; and (ii) issued revised \nequity and corporate bond market listing and delisting rules to facilitate and increase the number \nof listings to broaden the financial markets. The listing rules comprise various criteria and \nminimum standards established by the UZRSE (such as disclosure requirements, minimum \nstockholder's equity, and a minimum share price) to allow membership and trading of listed shares \nof a company at the UZRSE. Subprogram 2 will (i) complete the initial public offerings on the \nUZRSE of at least three SOEs through synergies achieved with the e-KYC process to broaden \nand deepen the capital markets by increasing the number of listings; and (ii) introduce alternative \nasset classes, such as exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts, to build upon \nthe foundation of market development and expand the investor base. \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s value addition. The value addition of ADB stems from its extensive experience in \nassisting  in  designing  and  implementing  reforms  to  facilitate  financial  market  development \nreforms across developing member countries. The program has utilized this experience in \nUzbekistan and (i) facilitated the identification of key reforms based on international best practices \n \n18 Government of Uzbekistan. 2020.

Lessons.  The  program  also  incorporates  lessons  from  the  Independent  Evaluation \nDepartment\u2019s special evaluation study to ensure it is implemented effectively.20 The program has \n(i) focused on a limited number of impactful policy actions; (ii) ensured ownership of the reforms \nby relevant key stakeholders thorough comprehensive consultations (involving intensive one-on-\none meetings and joint stakeholder wrap-up meetings) to diagnose issues;21 (iii) helped facilitate, \njointly with all stakeholders, formulation of the government\u2019s capital market development strategy \nto ensure reform sustainability is anchored to the government\u2019s capital market development \nstrategy; and (iv) pursued a holistic approach to ensure inclusion of insurance and pension areas \nand their links to financial market development. The approval of the government\u2019s capital market \ndevelopment strategy was done at the Presidential level to transcend different levels of vested \ninterests and strengthen government ownership as well as commitment. The advisor to the \nPresident of Uzbekistan has been appointed to lead the strategy implementation and coordination \namongst the key agencies. The government\u2019s capital market development strategy therefore \neffectively institutionalizes coordination amongst all key stakeholders and represents the key for \nreform sustainability. \n \n18.  Coordination among development partners. ADB is closely coordinating with other \ndevelopment partners to ensure synergies and complementarity. The World Bank\u2019s $500 million \nSustaining Market Reforms development policy operation (approved in June 2019), and $200 \nmillion  supplementary  development  policy  financing  (approved  in  April  2020)  support \nUzbekistan's economic reforms and transition to a market economy by increasing the role of \nmarkets and the private sector in the economy. The World Bank programs support a new Banking \nLaw that gives sufficient powers to the CBU to conduct effective oversight and enforcement, \nestablish  a  comprehensive  and  transparent  licensing  framework,  and  strengthen  corporate \ngovernance and transparency requirements for commercial banks. In 2019, the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) conducted a situational analysis of Uzbekistan\u2019s financial \nmarkets that revealed a weak legal and regulatory framework, low market liquidity, and absence \nof major financing tools.22 The UNDP study served as the basis for development of the capital \nmarket development strategy that was prepared with support from the European Bank for \nReconstruction and Development (EBRD) (the equity market portion) and ADB (the bond market \nportion). In 2021\u20132022, EBRD is providing dedicated resident professional experts to support \nimplementation of the capital market development strategy in collaboration with ADB. In 2019, \nthe United States Treasury approved a $1 million grant for developing budget planning and \nimproving public debt management practices at MOF that will facilitate government bond market \ndevelopment. The program builds on this foundation of solid debt management by developing the \ngovernment bond market through support for realization of a market-based government bond \nmarket yield curve. ADB is also collaborating with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF \nis  expected  to  design and  approve  a  public debt  management  TA  in  early  2022  in  close \n \n19 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Independent Evaluation Department. 2008.

Expected Outcome of the Reforms \n19.  The program is aligned with the following overarching development objective: a well-\nfunctioning financial system that supports basic capital and investment needs and the country\u2019s \nlong-term  economic  objectives.23 Development  of  financial  markets  will  contribute  towards \nachieving  this  objective  by  creating  efficiencies  and  innovations  to  ensure  the  balanced \ndevelopment of the finance sector through diversification of a predominantly bank-based system \nof financial intermediation, expansion of the sources of financial intermediation, reduction of \nfinancing costs by stimulating competition, and enhancement of the financial market\u2019s contribution \nto meeting the financing requirements of a growing economy. The expected outcome of the \nreforms will be: capacity and size of the financial markets augmented. The outcome is supported \nby three reform areas: (i) market facilitation enhanced, (ii) demand measures enhanced, and (iii) \nsupply measures enhanced. The reforms under subprogram 1 establish a solid foundation for \nfinancial market development featuring critical changes in legal, institutional, and human resource \nstructures by focusing on supporting the money market, strengthening DMO\u2019s debt management \nexpertise and capacity, developing the public debt management framework, and enhancing retail \ninvestor demand through tax incentives as well as simplified KYC. Subprogram 2 builds on this \nfinancial  market  development  foundation  by  catalyzing  institutional  investor  (insurance  and \npension sector) demand to support development of the government bond market yield curve and \nincreasing the supply of alternative financial instruments such as exchange-traded funds to \ndiversify the financial markets; this can only take place if the critical prerequisites under the \nprevious subprogram are in place. A programmatic approach is needed because the structural \nreforms require a long-term horizon to be implemented effectively.  Understanding capacity \nconstraints while designing the reforms is also important, which makes sequencing of reforms \ncritical. For example, streamlined efficient market infrastructure (such as the integration of the \ntrading platforms) in the program requires sufficient preparatory and implementation time. It is \ntherefore critical that the reforms are properly identified and sequenced over two subprograms as \ndescribed in this paragraph. A programmatic approach is ideal for chronologically sequencing the \nreforms in a multiyear framework. The proposed reforms of standards and procedures conform \nto best practices, including those promulgated by the IOSCO.24 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n20.  Based on the development financing requirements of the program, ADB proposes to \nprovide a $200 million policy-based loan to finance two subprograms through the programmatic \napproach. For subprogram 1, the government has requested a concessional loan of $100 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 25-year \nterm, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2% during the grace period and \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The draft \ndevelopment policy letter is in Appendix 3. \n \n21.  Uzbekistan\u2019s  development  financing  needs.  According  to  the  macroeconomic \nprojections from IMF\u2019s 2021 Article IV report,25 the government\u2019s financing requirement (overall \nfiscal deficit) is projected at $3,359 million (5.5% of GDP) in 2021. As detailed in Table 1, this will \n \n23 Government of Uzbekistan. 2019. Roadmap of Reforms of Uzbekistan, 2019\u20132021.

Debt  sustainability.  ADB\u2019s  March  2021  public  debt  sustainability  analysis  (DSA) \nindicates sustainable public debt and a low risk of debt stress, even under the post-COVID-19 \nscenario.26 The IMF\u2019s DSA under the April 2021 Article IV report (footnote 26) supports this \nconclusion: the debt-to-GDP ratio (based on total public and publicly guaranteed debt, comprising \npublic domestic and external debt and public guarantees) increased from 29.3% in 2019 to 37.8% \nin 2020, and is projected by the IMF to reach 42.1% in 2021 and nearly 44% by 2023. ADB\u2019s DSA \nshows  that  proposed  ADB  loans  of  $200  million  represent  less  than  1%  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s \noutstanding external debt stock of $20.6 billion at end of 2020. Additional lending of $650 million \nby the World Bank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency would add another 3% to the \npublic debt stock. According to ADB\u2019s DSA, the public debt\u2013GDP ratio (comprising public external \nand domestic debt and public guarantees) is projected to increase from 29.3% in 2019 to 36.4% \nin 2020 and 42.9% in 2021, but then steadily decline from 42.6% in 2022 to 41.0% by 2024. This \nanalysis substantiates that Uzbekistan has low risk of debt distress and debt sustainability will not \nbe impaired, because total public debt, including guarantees, remains moderately low. Public debt \nmainly consists of long-term loans from international financial institutions, which keeps borrowing \ncosts low. Uzbekistan\u2019s foreign exchange reserve position, including gold, is also strong. The \ngovernment continues to pursue a prudent debt management policy and established a 60% \nexternal  debt-to-GDP  ceiling.  The  annual  borrowing  limit  for  2021  on  state  external  loan \nagreements is $5 billion, and on government securities is SUM5 trillion ($469 million).27 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The MOF is the executing agency for the program. The implementing agencies are the \nCBU, MOF, SAMA, UZRSE, and UCSD. MOF will coordinate program implementation among the \nimplementing agencies. The policy-based loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). The program will be implemented \n \n26 Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Government of Uzbekistan, Ministry of Finance. 2020.

The indicative implementation period for subprogram 1 \nis June 2019\u2013September 2021, and for subprogram 2 is October 2021\u2013June 2023. \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n24.  The  TA  will  support  implementation  of  key  reform  actions  under the program.  It  is \nestimated to cost $500,000, to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund (TASF 7). The major outputs and activities of the TA include (i) developing a \ncoherent policy on a universal pension; (ii) developing legislation related to off-balance sheet \npension fund and other government provided pensions; (iii) determining approaches to implement \ndefined contribution and employer sponsored pension plans for the government, its agencies, and \nstate owned-enterprises; (iv) formulating a coherent policy for development of the insurance \nindustry in line with international standards; (v) drafting regulations and rules for the insurance \nindustry; and (vi) facilitating the enhancement of market infrastructure to cater to new linkages, \nsectors, and products. The alignment of the pension and insurance regulations with those of \nbanking and securities will be ensured to promote capital market development. The TA will be \nadministered by ADB. MOF will be the executing agency and implementing agency. The TA will \nbe implemented over 2 years, starting in October 2021. ADB will engage consultants through a \nconsulting firm in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to \ntime). Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, office supplies, secretarial \nassistance, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n25.  Economic and financial. The program will facilitate mobilization of financial resources \nfor  productive  investment  and  employment  generation  by  supporting  the  development  of \ncompetitive financial markets. The program will help ensure balanced development of the finance \nsector, which will reduce systemic vulnerabilities in the bank-dominated financial system. By \npromoting development of the corporate securities market and institutional investors (such as \ninsurance companies and pension funds), the program will diversify the financial instruments \navailable and broaden the investor base. This will reduce market volatility and improve the \nresilience of the finance sector to external shocks. By strengthening governance of the capital \nmarkets,  the  program  will  enhance  market  efficiency  and  improve  investor  protection. \nUzbekistan\u2019s rankings from the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index and the \nWorld Justice Project Rule of Law Index have improved, and the country\u2019s Doing Business ranking \nreached 69th (out of 190 countries) in 2020, from 76th in 2018.28 The World Bank Doing Business \n2020 report highlights that Uzbekistan earned a spot among the world\u2019s top 20 most-improved \neconomies for ease of doing business because of key reforms that included strengthening \nminority investor protection by increasing the rights of shareholders and their role in major \ncorporate decisions, clarifying ownership structures, and requiring greater corporate transparency. \n \n26.  Governance.  ADB  staff  conducted  a  governance  risk  assessment  in  line  with  the \nGuidelines for Implementing ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.29 The \nassessment identified risks that could affect the programmatic approach, including (i) prolonged \n \n28 Transparency International. 2020.

The  Uzbekistan  CPS \n(footnote 2) indicates public financial management (PFM) is deemed reliable in budget credibility, \ndebt management, and treasury functions, but weaknesses exist when it comes to transparency, \npublic participation, off-budget funding, internal audit, and external audit. The insufficient capacity \nof  public  institutions  is  another  significant  risk.  The  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial \nAccountability report identifies similar risks and calls a number of actions (some of which are \nalready incorporated in the government\u2019s PFM reform strategy): multi-year budget programming, \nimplementation of a risk analysis and audit approach, provision of performance information on \nservice delivery, capture and publication of all assets bought with public funds, issuance of more \ndetailed budget execution reports, and increased financial independence of the Chamber of \nAccounts and scrutiny by Parliament of budget proposals and executions.30 The government\u2019s \nPFM reforms aim to improve tax administration, introduce a medium-term budget framework, \nestablish international public sector accounting and audit standards, and strengthen external audit. \nThe government is committed to reforms and in 2017 launched an anticorruption campaign that \nincludes  legislative,  regulatory,  and  institutional  initiatives. 31  While  no  major  risks  of \nmismanagement of resources at the implementation level could be discerned, areas relating to \ninstitutional capacity have been targeted for capacity development under the TA and reforms \nunder the program. \n \n27.  Poverty and social. Financial market reforms under the program will play an important \nrole in raising funds cost-effectively and in enabling investors to gain access to alternative \ninvestment opportunities, while mitigating the negative impact that financial market instability has \non  the  poor.  Diversification  away  from  a  predominantly  bank-based  system  of  financial \nintermediation expands alternative sources of credit, thereby helping to limit systemic impacts of \neconomic shocks. Financial markets can stimulate healthy competition with the banking sector \nthat lowers financing costs for all borrowers. The program therefore emphasizes specific financial \nmarket reforms to help Uzbekistan diversify its financial system so that the country can realize its \nbroad-based economic growth and socioeconomic development objectives, including poverty \nreduction. The program is categorized some gender elements. The program seeks to address \ngender disparities, namely women\u2019s limited access to financial markets\u2014only 36% of women in \nUzbekistan have access to financial inclusion services, out of the total female population of more \nthan 50%.32 The program promotes approval of key gender policy actions at SAMA, UZRSE, and \nMOF that will improve women\u2019s representation in SOEs in both managerial and working staff \nlevels, guarantee women\u2019s equal access to training, and institute a consistent rewards and \nremuneration package between women and men. The MOF will also issue a policy on pensions \nthat includes an approach to addressing any gender disparities within the pensions regime. \n \n28.  Safeguards.  Reforms  under  the  program  do  not  anticipate  any  direct  or  indirect \nenvironmental impacts, will not cause involuntary resettlement, and will have no impacts on \nindigenous  peoples.  The  program  is  classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \n30 World Bank. 2019.
