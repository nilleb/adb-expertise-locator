An  initial  environmental  examination  was \nAssessment  undertaken, and its summary is a core appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The Project supports implementation of a sector reform program \nand  establishment  of  a  National  Maritime  Safety  Authority \n(NMSA). It also establishes a trust fund that provides a source of \nfinancing for a subsidy required for provision of water transport to \nremote and disadvantaged communities, restores water transport \ninfrastructure, improves small-craft safety, and induces the ability \nof  the  affected  communities  to  maximize  the  benefits  of  the \ntransport provided. \n   \nRationale  The living standards of Papua New Guinea\u2019s remote maritime and \nriver-based communities are  deteriorating and the incidence of \npoverty is increasing. These communities experience extremely \nconstrained  transport  conditions.  They  consequently  lack \nadequate supplies, staple foods, and access to educational and \nhealth services. They only occasionally trade in primary goods in \nsmall quantities due to the unaffordable transport prices. The \nGovernment, the private sector, and civil society as a whole have \nrecognized  the  need  to  improve  maritime  and  river-route \ntransport.  \n \nPapua New Guinea is implementing a maritime sector reform \nprogram  that  focuses  on  improving  sector  effectiveness, \nefficiency, safety, and delivery of services to rural communities. \nThe  sector  reforms  will  establish  appropriate and sustainable \nmaritime safety functions within a statutory NMSA, a self-funding \nand  performance-based  organization  with  sustainable  cost \nrecovery and effective systems to support development of the \nmaritime sector and its contribution to poverty reduction. \n   \nObjectives   The Project will (i) directly reduce poverty of the marginalized and \nremote  maritime  and  river-based  communities  by  financing  a \ncatalytic, temporary subsidy where cash incomes do not support a \nregular  transport  service,  and  (ii) promote  effective  sector \ngovernance  through  establishment  of  the  NMSA. The project \nscope  includes  (i) establishing  a  Community  Water  Transport \nTrust Fund (CWTF) that finances the required water transport \nsubsidy, (ii) restoring water transport infrastructure, (iii) improving \nsmall-craft  safety,  (iv) maximizing  utilization  of  water  transport \nthrough community support services, (v) implementing maritime \nsector  reforms  and  establishing  the  NMSA,  and  (vi) providing \nproject management services. ", "  i ii \nproject management services. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project base cost is estimated at $25.7 million. The total \ncost of the proposed Project, including taxes, duties, and interest \nduring construction (IDC), is estimated at $28.1 million, of which \nthe foreign exchange cost, including IDC, is about $18.5 million \n(66%) and the local currency cost (including taxes and duties) is \nabout $9.6 million (34%). \n   \nFinancing Plan  Asian Development Bank (ADB): $19.0 million. OPEC Fund for \nInternational  Development:  $4.0 million.  Government  direct \nfinancial resources: $5.1 million equivalent. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan will be in an amount equivalent to SDR12.83 million, from \nADB's Special Funds resources, to finance approximately 67% of \nthe cost of the Project. The loan will have a maturity of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% \nduring the grace period and 1.5% during the amortization period. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2012. \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2011. \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The  Department  of  Transport  (DOT)  will  establish  a  project \nArrangements  management unit to handle daily activities of the Project and a \nsteering committee with stakeholder representation to monitor the \nProject.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  DOT will be the executing agency. \n   \nProcurement  Three  procurement  contract  packages  have  been  identified: \n(i) facilities for the  NMSA including computers, printers, copiers, \nfax  machines,  telephones,  software,  vehicles,  and  furniture; \n(ii) civil works for small infrastructure; and (iii) radio equipment. \nThese will be awarded through international competitive bidding \nor  local  competitive  bidding,  and  international  shopping  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n \nConsulting Services  The  Project  requires  international  and  domestic  consulting \nservices for (i) project administration, (ii) community development, \n(iii) small-craft safety, and (iv) civil engineering and supervision. \nAdvance  procurement  action  for  the  selection  of  the  project \nmanagement  consultants  has  been  approved  to  enable \nimplementation of the project activities in accordance with the \nimplementation schedule. Consulting services will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother procedures acceptable to ADB for the selection of domestic \nconsultants. \n ", "iv     \nProject Benefits and  The Project will result in direct and indirect social and economic \nBeneficiaries  impacts  on  remote  maritime  and  river  communities  through \nprovision of improved access to services and markets. It will also \nimprove seafaring safety for coastal vessels including small craft \nthrough establishment of an accountable sector agency, sector \nmanagement  capability,  and  improved  and  safer  landing \ninfrastructure. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  living  standards  of  Papua  New \nGuinea\u2019s remote maritime and river-based communities that are \ncurrently  nearing  absolute  poverty.  The  sector  restructuring \nprogram  initiated  by  the  Government  will  enhance  sector \ngovernance and enable  effective and transparent management \nof water transport franchise schemes and delivery of maritime \nsafety services. The Project will enable the provision of private \nsector transport services to remote and poor communities and \nwill  reduce  the  transport  constraint  experienced  by  the \ncommunities. This will lead to reduced cost of transport and \nincreased  local  income  from  trade  in  primary  goods  in  the \nmainstream  markets.  Reduced  transport  prices,  in  turn,  will \nimprove the communities\u2019 access to supplies, staple foods, and \neducational and health services, directly reducing poverty. The \nProject supports the restoration of safe and efficient small water \ntransport  infrastructure  and  establishes  a  framework  for  a \nfocused and time-bound maritime safety improvement program \nthat  will  both  reduce  frequent  loss  of  life  and  goods  in  sea \naccidents and improve passenger safety. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The main risks associated with the Project relate to timely and \nadequate  counterpart  funding,  and  to  outstanding  land \ncompensation  claims  that  need  to  be  resolved  quickly  and \namicably. \n \nThe major assumptions under the Project are (i) that the return \non  the  trust  fund  is  adequate  to  fund  the  subsidies  for  the \nfranchise routes, and (ii) that rapid economic development will \ntake  place  once  remote  locations  are  serviced  by  regular \ntransport. \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " \n   \nM\nA\nP\n \n \nv ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to Papua New Guinea (PNG) for the Community Water Transport Project (the Project); and \n(ii) the proposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a loan for the Project \nto be provided by the OPEC Fund for International Development (OPEC Fund). \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  The Government\u2019s macroeconomic and sector policies are established in its Medium \nTerm Development Strategy 1997\u20132002 (MTDS), draft poverty reduction strategy, and the \nNational Transport Development Plan (NTDP) 2001\u20132010. The proposed Project implements \nthe  Government\u2019s  strategic  plan  to  provide  viable  and  effective  maritime  transport  sector \nservices to remote and disadvantaged communities. To improve women\u2019s and children\u2019s health, \nthe Government\u2019s National Health Plan also emphasizes the need to improve access to health \ncenters  by  providing  public  transportation  in  remote  areas.  The  project  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1.  \n \n3.  With the support of the ADB-funded Functional Expenditure Review,1 the Government \nexamined the weaknesses in delivery of public maritime safety services. The Government \nadopted the recommendations of the review and recognized the need for maritime sector \nrestructuring. In the Papua New Guinea country program for 2000, ADB agreed to provide \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  a  sector  restructuring  action  plan.2  Subsequently,  a  sector \nreorganization  program  was  implemented.  This  program  aims  to  separate  the  operational \nresponsibilities for maritime services from the Department of Transport (DOT),3 and to establish \nan  autonomous  and  efficient  National  Maritime  Safety  Authority  (NMSA). This institutional \nframework will enable Papua New Guinea to provide effective maritime safety services for \ninternational and local coastal vessels and support community water transport. The Project \nsupports implementation of the sector restructuring by financing the associated facilities and \nstaff retrenchment, and by providing a time-bound framework for accomplishing the reforms. In \naddition to the Project, the sector reform program relies on continued implementation of the \nGovernment\u2019s program to rehabilitate the  navigation aids on critical routes and establish a \nhydrographic  capability  with  the  support  of  Loan  1754-PNG:  Rehabilitation  of  Maritime \nNavigation Aids System Project.4  \n \n4.  The  2001  country  program  included  a  feasibility  study  for  the  Project.5 This  study \nidentified water transport routes along which communities are subjected to limited, infrequent \nand expensive transport services. Consequently, these communities experience  difficulty in \nobtaining  sustained  access  to  basic  necessities.  The  Project  provides  resources  for  the \nGovernment  to  facilitate  provision  of  private  transport  on  these  routes.  This  involves  a \ntransparent legal framework for a Community Water Transport  Trust Fund (CWTF)  that will \nfinance a catalytic subsidy. An initial subsidy is required for the provision of transport services to \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999.

", "2  \nremote communities, as they do not currently have adequate cash incomes to support fares for \ntransport at the level of full operating cost recovery. However, catalyzed by the transport \nprovided  with  the  support  of  the  CWTF  and  the  initial  subsidies,  these  communities  are \nexpected to be able to improve their standard of living, earnings, and will eventually be able to \nafford transport at break-even fares. Accordingly, the Project will have a direct poverty reducing \nbenefit. The Project will, concurrently, support establishment of transparent and effective sector \nmanagement through the NMSA.  \n \n5.  A fact-finding mission visited Papua New Guinea in March 2002. A preappraisal mission, \napproved by the management review meeting on 16 May 2002, was conducted in July 2002 and \nwas subsequently upgraded to an appraisal mission on 5 August 2002. A staff review meeting \non 24 October 2002 authorized loan negotiations. Counterpart funding constraints in that year \nresulted in the deferment of further loan processing until 2003.  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n6.  Sector and subsector analyses are given in Appendix 2. \n \n1.  Current Maritime Sector Governance and Reform Program \n7.  DOT,  among  its  functions,  is  responsible  for  maritime  safety  services  upon  which \nvessels  depend  in  their  daily  movements.  Its  Maritime Transport Division (MTD) has not, \nhowever,  been  able  to  deliver  these  services.  Maritime  navigational  safety  has  seriously \ndeteriorated to the point where about 70% of the navigation aids in PNG operated by MTD are \nnonoperational. The industry no longer receives public sector support or safety services, and \nconsequently faces increased costs  with the private sector  providing navigation safety aids \n(e.g., markers and buoys) on its own. As a result, the private sector is increasingly reluctant to \npay maritime services fees, which, in turn, impacts on the Government\u2019s ability to finance the \nsector. Alongside the shortcomings in the maritime safety services, maritime transport services \nhave seriously deteriorated, with vessel operators having to limit voyage routes and schedules. \nAdditionally, MTD is not able to support the development of safe and efficient water transport \nservices. Increasing costs, depreciating local currency, subsequent declining incomes, and, in \nremote areas, increasing poverty have led to a reduction in coverage of private shipping \noperations.  \n \n2.  Remote Water Transport \n \n8.  The  availability,  frequency,  and  quality  of  water  transport  services  in  PNG  vary \nsignificantly, and many rural areas lack economical transport systems for the movement of \ngoods and people. Marine infrastructure is deficient in many coastal and river areas, with \nwharves and jetties nonexistent or in poor condition, resulting in further reduction of economical \nand  safe  water  transport.  Currently,  the  services  in  most  areas  are  unaffordable for the \ninhabitants of the remote communities and inaccessible without long travel times by foot or \nother modes. Much of the existing water transport service is provided by small craft with high \noperating costs and significant safety risks. Water transport safety has become compromised \nalso as a result of overloading, long-distance travel, travel at night and during bad weather, \nunavailability of markers, lack of safety equipment and communications, and inadequate search \nand rescue capacity. Lack of safe seafaring among users and operators of water transport has, \nin particular, resulted in frequent loss of life at sea, as well as material losses.  \n \n ", "   3\n9.  A direct correlation exists between lack of access to affordable and reliable water \ntransport  and  the  level  of  poverty  in  isolated  and  water  transport-dependent  communities \nthroughout  PNG.  Access to transport services and ease in  transferring from one mode of \ntransport to another has a significant impact on production and income levels, social and \neconomic  indicators,  and  the  overall  quality  and  desirability  of  rural  life.  Inaccessible, \nunaffordable, and unreliable water transport in remote coastal and river areas has led to a \nmarginalization of the rural communities. They are unable to reap benefits from development as \nthey are left without the necessary access to essential services (e.g., immunization, aid-posts, \nand primary schooling) and markets. Uneconomical movement of village products serves to \nundermine local production, self-initiative, livelihood, and survival.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Maritime Sector Governance  \n10.  The Government is committed to a far-reaching sector reform program. These reforms \nwill establish maritime safety services according to international standards by installing an \nappropriate  management  structure  that  will  enable  effective  client  consultations,  strategic \nplanning and service provision, and adequate and sustainable funding of maritime safety. Under \nthe reform program, the Government has introduced higher user charges and their sole use for \nthe purposes of maritime safety. It is preparing to establish an NMSA that has its own funding \nand  staff  to  replace  an  ineffective  MTD.  The  establishment  of  the  NMSA  is  expected  to \nsignificantly improve delivery of  maritime services under the prospect of adequately funded \noperation and maintenance, skilled and motivated staff, and improved productivity and service \norientation.  \n \n2.  Community Water Transport \n11.  The maritime and river-based communities suffer from extremely constrained transport \nconditions,  where  living  standards  are  nearing  absolute  poverty.  In  many  cases,  these \ncommunities lack sufficient soap, salt, and staple foods, and do not have adequate access to \neducational or health services. Very poor health indicators characterize these communities, with \nmaternal health the lowest in the region and tuberculosis incidence rising. These communities \nonly occasionally trade in the cash economy, and only in small quantities, due to unaffordable \ntransport  prices.  The  Government,  the  private  sector,  and  civil  society  as  a  whole  have \nrecognized the need to improve maritime and river-route transport to these communities.  \n \n12.  The Project offers an opportunity to directly and indirectly impact  the quality of life, \nparticularly  for  women  and  children,  in  the  marginalized  coastal  and  river  communities. \nImproved  water  transport  will  increase  (i) access  to  markets,  leading  to  higher  household \nincomes needed to meet basic family welfare needs; (ii) capacity to produce and purchase \nnutritional food supplies, leading to reduced nutritional deficiencies, particularly among children; \n(iii) efficiency of boat services, leading to reduced workload burdens for women, reduced time in \ntransit, increased personal safety, and greater mobility; (iv) access to educational services, \nresulting  in  reduced  geographical  and  gender  disparity  in  enrollment,  performance,  and \ncompletion  rates;  and  (v) access  to  preventive  and  curative  medical  services,  resulting  in \nreduced maternal mortality ratios, improved family planning, increased childhood immunization \nrates, and reduced preventable disease. Poverty incidence in, and socioeconomic profiles of, \nthe affected communities are in Supplementary Appendix A with a summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy and summary initial poverty and social assessment in Appendix 3. \n \n ", "4  \n  3.  Sector Restructuring: An Opportunity to Support Poverty Reduction \n \n13.  With the support of the Project, a comprehensive transport system can be set up \nprovided that (i) an accountable  institution  (NMSA) governs the sector, and (ii) a financing \nmechanism (CWTF) is established to provide the initial subsidies required to facilitate transport \nto remote communities. The Project supports implementation of a tightly connected strategic \nrestructuring program that steers the institutional reforms and leads to a reduction in the cost \nstructure of shipping services. The institutional reforms will make it possible for the Government \nto  reach  the  most  marginalized  communities  in  PNG  with  water  transport.  The  sector \nrestructuring plan in  Appendix 4  provides an overall framework and a time frame for sector \nreorganization. \n \n4.  Asian Development Bank Strategy and the Project \n14.  While no other external assistance is available to the sector, with the exception of \ncofinancing by the Australian Agency for International Development for the maritime sector \nrestructuring project (footnote 2), complementarity exists between external agency-supported \nrural development programs and the Project. Complementary external assistance projects are \nlisted in Appendix 5. These programs, in addition to the Government\u2019s initiative to implement a \nfood  security  policy,  include  agricultural  and  health  extension  services,  and  HIV/AIDS \nawareness and prevention programs. The synergies between these programs and the Project \nwill  be  systematically  harnessed  by  the  Project  to  maximize  the  related  benefits  to  the \ncommunities involved in the new transport services.  \n \n15.  The Project is designed ni  accordance with ADB\u2019s overarching objective to reduce \npoverty  in  the  Asian and Pacific region by 50% by 2015. ADB\u2019s  PNG country assistance \nstrategy centers on service delivery improvement, particularly in rural areas and through public \nsector reform processes. The Project addresses ADB's poverty reduction objective in PNG by \nimproving access of remote communities to markets and services, and thus induces increased \ncash incomes as a result of reduced expenditure on transport and  increased earnings as a \nresult of increased marketing of local products. The Project permits enhanced standards of \nliving through an increase in spending of the additional disposable income on improved diet, \npreventive health care, and uninterrupted primary education. In line with ADB\u2019s strategy, the \nProject also supports the Government\u2019s public sector reform program by providing a structured \nframework for improving management of the maritime sector through establishment of an \nautonomous and self-funding NMSA. \n \n5.  Lessons Learned \n16.  The current portfolio of PNG projects consists of 12 loans, 3 of which have been rated \n\u201cat risk\u201d. The Government and ADB are working to improve this implementation record. Delays \nin starting projects have hindered successful implementation of many projects. Time has been \nneeded for the establishment of project management arrangements, issuance of legal opinions, \nand ensuring an understanding of the negative pledge clause. Inadequate counterpart funds \nhave also been a recurrent problem in project implementation in PNG and have led to weak \ndisbursement performance.  \n \n17.  The Project brings together the concept of  a minimum subsidy tender for a water \ntransport franchise and a special purpose trust fund. This combination is necessary to enable \ndelivery of services in the remote rural sector of PNG in light of  a highly constrained fiscal \nsituation. Subsidized transport services with the objective of  involving rural populations in \n ", "   5\nmainstream economic and social activities are common throughout the world. The economic \nbenefits to civil society of minimum subsidy transport schemes exceed their financial costs to \nthe governments. Minimum subsidy shipping franchise schemes have been implemented with \nADB assistance in other Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs), including the Fiji \nIslands  and  Marshall  Islands.6  This  experience  has  demonstrated  that  the  proposed \narrangement (i) is able to deliver transport services at a lower cost than a government-owned \nand operated service, and (ii) can induce a semi-commercial and potentially commercial service \nwhere none would otherwise exist.  \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  trust  funds  has  been  positive  and  includes  several  special \npurpose  funds.  Examples  include  the  Falekaupule  Trust  Fund  in  Tuvalu7  to  fund island \ndevelopment projects, and the Bhutan Health Trust Fund8 for funding primary health care, \nsupply of drugs, and immunization programs. Trust funds have been successfully used as a \nfunding  mechanism  by  many  other  government  and  international  agencies,  e.g.,  local \nenvironmental trusts and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Other types of dedicated funds \nin the transport sector are road funds that operate in many developed and developing countries. \nAlbeit contrary to conventional treasury policy, dedicated special purpose funds have preserved \nessential services that could have otherwise been starved of funding, and, because of their \ncrucial role in poverty alleviation have consequently become increasingly accepted. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n19.  The  objectives  of  the  proposed  Project  are  (i) to  directly  reduce  poverty  in  the \nmarginalized maritime and river-based communities by inducing water transport to remote \nareas,  and  by  providing  safer  transport  services  and  infrastructure;  and  (ii) to  support \nimplementation of the maritime sector reorganization and reform program, particularly through \nthe establishment of NMSA. \n \n20.  Specifically, the proposed Project will (i) provide community water transport services, \n(ii) restore maritime and river transport infrastructure, (iii) improve community transport safety, \n(iv) optimize access of disadvantaged communities to development opportunities, (v) enable the \nplanned NMSA to fulfill its mandate to improve maritime safety, (vi) increase efficiency in \nmaritime transport, and (vii) promote community engagement. \n \nB.

There are four main reasons for setting up a dedicated CWTF: (i) additional resources \nare needed beyond the available fiscal resources to provide water transport for PNG\u2019s remote \ncommunities, (ii) sustainable and reliable financing of the community water transport subsidy is \nrequired  to  implement  the  private  sector  services,  (iii) transparency  and  accountability  are \nrequired in management of the subsidy, and (iv) investments in international capital markets will \nprovide a natural hedge against the foreign currency exchange risk.  \n \n24.  The  deed  of  the  CWTF  identifies  the  mechanisms  under  which  the  fund  will  be \nmanaged. Details of the CWTF are in  Appendix 6 and the deed of trust of the CWTF are \nsummarized in Supplementary Appendix B. Investment income of the CWTF will be tax exempt \nby the Government of PNG. The Government will not make amendments to the CWTF deed, to \nthe status of the CWTF, or to the legislation making financial provision of the dividend revenues \nto financing the community water transport subsidy, without prior consent of ADB.  \n \n25.  The investment income of the CWTF will finance the subsidy payments of the water \ntransport services. The magnitude of the revenues dictates the amount of subsidies that the \nGovernment can commit to pay per annum, and thus the size of the water transport franchise \nscheme. This provides an effective ceiling to the extent to which the Government will participate \nin supporting water transport services to remote communities. The investment income has been \ncalculated, in light of the current investment climate, at 3% per annum. The CWTF will be \nestablished 18 months prior to the award of the first water transport franchise contracts enabling \naccumulation of adequate reserves of investment income providing financial contract cover for \nthe Government. The actual subsidy requirement will become known once the tenders for the \nwater  transport  services  have  been  concluded  and  the  minimum-subsidy  bids  have  been \nidentified.  \n \n26.  Route Franchise Schemes. The identified route franchise schemes will be tendered \nunder a staged program commencing with remote community water transport routes in the \n                                                 \n9  Trustees include (1) Secretary of the Department of Treasury, (2) Secretary of National Planning and Rural \nDevelopment, and (3) Secretary of the Department of Transport. \n ", "   7\nSouth Fly District of Western Province, Coast of Oro Province, Coast of Morobe  in Madang \nProvinces, Ramu River in Madang Province, Sepik River in Sandaun Province, South Coast of \nWest and East New Britain Provinces, and Southeast Coast of New Ireland Province. These \nroutes have been identified as priority routes based on the expected poverty reduction impact, \npotential for inducing local economic activity, and likelihood of reducing or eliminating the \nsubsidy over a period of time.  Further areas will be identified and routes detailed under the \nsubsequent phases of the Project. The detailed preparation of the water transport franchise \nschemes and the corresponding tender documents for the route franchise tenders will be \naccomplished during the detailed design phase of the Project. This will identify the minimum \nservice level including frequency, capacity, and safety standards, and the maximum cargo and \npassenger tariffs affordable to the client communities. The tender documents will specify a \nceiling tariff that corresponds to an affordable tariff for passenger transport for each specific \nscheme.10 A ceiling tariff for cargo transport will correspond to less than or equal to the current \nregulated rates provided under the Papua New Guinea Coastal Freight Rates.11  \n \n27.  It is expected that about 90% of the first phase franchise routes will reach break-even by \ntheir fourth tender, leaving 10% (or $33,000 per annum [pa]) of the subsidy as a permanent \nfinancing requirement for the Government. The second phase franchise scheme expands the \nwater  transport  program  outwards  and  to  more  remote  routes.  About  70%  of  these are \nestimated to reach break-even status by their fourth tender, leaving 30% (or $99,000 pa) of the \nsubsidy as a permanent financing requirement for the Government. Similarly, the third phase \nscheme is estimated to leave about 50% (or $156,000 pa) of  its subsidy requirement for the \nGovernment to finance. These permanent subsidy requirements resulting from the structural \ncharacteristics of the routes for long-distance and low-volume traffic are estimated to amount to \n$297,000 pa by the end of the Project. These costs will be reviewed by the technical reviews of \nthe Project. The Government will finance these subsidies on a recurring basis from its fiscal \nresources and thus implement its policy to deliver essential services in the remote areas. Details \nof the franchise scheme are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n2.  Component 2: Remote Water Transport Infrastructure Restoration \n28.  The Project will restore 40 selected maritime transport infrastructure elements, including \npiers, pontoons, jetties, landing ramps, and small wharves, to develop robust facilities that \nreduce the need for the unsafe cargo lightering off the side of the vessel. The facilities to be \nrestored are listed in Supplementary Appendix C. These support the first phase water transport \nfranchise services by making vessel operations more economical and safe. Least-cost technical \nsolutions have been selected. The engineering and supervision component under the Project \nwill be tasked to ensure that appropriate environmental mitigation and maintenance plans and \nschedules developed. \n \n29.  Maintenance of the restored small water transport infrastructure has been estimated to \ncost K200,000 ($60,000) annually. This will be funded by the planned NMSA and will be \nabsorbed in its cost structure. Maintenance of the structures will be carried out by suitably \nqualified local contractors. These contractors, engaged under local competitive bidding, will be \nencouraged to organize and employ local village labor for the routine maintenance tasks, while \ncarrying out specific repairs and maintenance with its own resources. Both maintenance and \n                                                 \n10 Estimated to correspond to the tariff (K0.15 per passenger-kilometer [km]) required for a workboat operating at a \nbreak-even rate versus the current (and unaffordable) tariff of the banana-boat (open bull 19-23 foot boats with no \nseating or safety facilities, rated for 6-8 persons with a speed of 20 knots)  charter rate (K0.4 per passenger-km) \nfaced by the remote river and water-based communities.  \n11 Section 240 of the Merchant Shipping Act (Chapter 22), 1995. \n ", "8  \nconstruction  contractors  will  actively  participate  in  the  HIV/AIDS  awareness  campaigns \ndeveloped under Component 4. \n \n3.  Component 3: Small-Craft Safety \n30.  The Project targets development of a safety orientation among small-craft operators and \nusers. The component on small-craft safety will (i) introduce formal marine accident reporting \nand investigation by the planned NMSA; (ii) prepare pro-forma small-craft safety guidelines with \na focus on establishing minimum safety standards; (iii) develop a boat registration system for \ncurrently unregulated  motorized boats (below 10-meters in length); (iv) develop a system for \nlicensing boat operators; (v) determine and mandate essential safety equipment for new and \nexisting  boats;  (vi) establish  a  country-wide  marine  radio  network  to  ensure  minimum \ncommunications standards for all coastal areas and river communities,12 including the extension \nof radio coverage by fitting the existing radio towers with the necessary repeaters and automatic \nmessage  forwarding  to  the  main  stations;  (vii) develop  a  public  information  dissemination \ncampaign on small-craft safety using, among other things, wooden boards, notices, media, and \ntraining with nationally prominent and respected members of society delivering the necessary \nmessages; (viii) revise, republish, and disseminate the \u201cBasic Boating Safety in Papua New \nGuinea Waters\u201d in English, Motu,13 and Pidgin, and develop curricula for introduction of a \nmaritime safety subject in elementary schools; (ix) design and support awareness seminars on \nmaintenance, operation, and safety of small craft, and training of appropriate local government \nand community officials to carry out inspections of boats at traditional landing sites; and (x) carry \nout  community-wide  safety  training  on  small-craft  safety  precaution,  vessel  inspection \nchecklists, procedures for distress at sea, and other safety measures.  \n \n31.  The Project will also support development of the skills and coordination mechanisms to \nenhance existing search and rescue operations and assets. In particular the Project will assist \nthe planned NMSA to develop a formal search and rescue action plan through the conduct of \nconsultation seminars and workshops covering relevant public and private sector stakeholders. \n \n4.  Component 4: Community Development to Optimize Use of Transport \n32.  To maximize the use of the water transport provided under the Project, community \nextension services are provided to develop capacity of the remote communities to benefit from \nthe rural development opportunities. The component will (i) identify and generate local-level \nawareness  of  new  social  and  economic  development  opportunities  available  to  very  poor \ncommunities in light of improved transport services or reduced transport costs; (ii) build capacity \nfor community-level participation in cross-sector planning activities; (iii) identify mechanisms to \nencourage  communities  to  take  up  new  economic  opportunities;  (iv) support  communities' \nefforts  to  maximize  local  production  opportunities;  (v) support  improved  access  to,  and \nawareness of, preventive health care, including HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness programs; \nand (vi) identify and support communities in development and implementation of micro-scale \nprojects that directly reduce poverty and that are directly linked to the new transport services. \nWomen\u2019s participation will be actively encouraged under the community development programs.  \n \n                                                 \n12 In accordance with the recommendation of the Papua New Guinea National Master Plan for the Maritime Radio \nCommunications Sector. \n13 Motu is an indigenous language widely spoken, particularly in the coastal areas, alongside English and Pidgin. \n ", "   9\n5.  Component 5: Establishment of the National Maritime Safety Authority \n33.  The Government is implementing a maritime sector restructuring plan and has already \naccomplished critical steps. These included separation of sector cost recovery revenues (e.g., \nnavigation lights dues) from the Government\u2019s consolidated revenues for the use of the sector \nto an interim trust account until the autonomous NMSA takes control of this revenue collection. \nIt has also sold its navigation aids vessel that required significant budgetary resources, but did \nnot provide services to the sector, and it has increased navigation aids tariffs. The next steps \nunder the program depend heavily on the timely establishment of the  NMSA. The NMSA Act \nwas passed in Parliament on 24 September 2003  and the authority is expected to be fully \nfunctioning in 2004. \n \n34.  The NMSA needs to be equipped with facilities, instruments, and systems that will allow \nit to operate effectively and to be free of land claims arrears. It also needs to have staff capable \nof carrying out its functions effectively under rigorous performance monitoring. The Project will \nfinance  (i) establishment  costs  of  NMSA,  including  offices,  communications  facilities,  and \nmanagement  information  systems;  (ii) staff  retrenchment14,  recruitment,  and  training;  and \n(iii) clearance of accumulated land claims.  \n \n6.  Component 6: Project Management \n35.  The Water Transport Franchise Unit will be the project management unit (PMU) under \nthe auspices of NMSA, once this is established. The PMU will manage the water transport route \nfranchise  contracts,  small-craft  safety  activities,  and  small  water  transport  infrastructure \nmaintenance. Upon completion of the project, these activities will continue as routine functions \nof NMSA. The Executing Agency (EA) has nominated the PMU and its project manager for Loan \n1754-PNG: Rehabilitation of the Maritime Navigation Aids (footnote 3) as the interim project \nmanagement to carry out the upfront activities of the proposed Project until the Project is \napproved by ADB.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n36.  The Project establishes an investment fund of $11 million equivalent \u2013 comprising $10 \nmillion from the loan proceeds and $1 million equivalent from the counterpart funds \u2013 that is \nexpected to yield an annual investment income of $330,000. The trustees will  (i) select, in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, one or more reputable fund \nmanagers to invest the principal capital from the loan proceeds in international markets and the \nprincipal capital from the counterpart contribution in the domestic market; or (ii) decide to invest \nthe funds from the loan proceeds directly in international investment funds and the counterpart \ncontribution directly in the domestic investment funds. A conservative investment strategy will \nbe applied similar to investments of pension funds. The PMU will request the trustees for \nrepatriation of specific sums of the investment income on a quarterly basis to a dedicated Kina \naccount with the Bank of Papua New Guinea, as the subsidy payments to the transport \nproviders under the water transport franchise schemes fall due. These subsidy payments will be \nmade by the trustees  from this CWTF account on a quarterly basis, triggered by payment \ninstructions of the PMU. Establishment of the dedicated account for depositing the repatriated \nCWTF investment income with the Bank of Papua New Guinea is a condition for withdrawal of \nthe loan proceeds for this component. \n \n                                                 \n14 This refers to retrenchment of redundant staff in the Department of Transport. \n ", "10  \n37.  The CWTF will be  a terminating fund. Its principal capital will be gradually reduced \nthrough withdrawals to finance the small water transport infrastructure associated with the \nsubsequent phases of water transport services. These withdrawals will reduce the principal \ninvestment of the CWTF by estimated amounts of $3.0 million in the 5th year of the CWTF for \nthe infrastructure required by the second phase franchise scheme; and by $2 million in the 8th \nyear of the CWTF for the infrastructure required by the third phase franchise scheme. At its \nlower level, the investment income will be supplemented by the use of the principal of the CWTF \nfor the payment of the community water transport subsidy. The future life, magnitude, and \nsources  of  potential  replenishment  of  CWTF  will  be  reviewed  5  years  after  it  has  been \nestablished, corresponding to the implementation of the second phase of the water transport \nroute franchise and the first withdrawal from the principal investment.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n38.  The total cost of the proposed Project, including taxes, duties, and interest during \nconstruction (IDC), is estimated at $28.14 million, of which the foreign exchange cost, including \nIDC, is about $18.53 million (66%) and the local currency cost (including taxes and duties) is \nabout  $9.61  million  (33%).

Papua New Guinea will be the Borrower. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% during the grace period and 1.5% during \nthe amortization period. The Government has confirmed availability of counterpart funding from \nits own resources in a total amount of about $5.1 million \u2013 in the amounts of $1.0 million in 2004 \nand $0.6 million each subsequent year for the purposes of the Project.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n \n41.  DOT will be the EA for the technical activities of the proposed Project until such time \nwhen the PMU will be transferred to the fully functioning NMSA, which will then become the new \nEA. The Secretary of DOT will be the Project Director with the Deputy Secretary for Technical \nServices operating as  the direct supervisor of project activities. The PMU will  (i) program, \nadminister,  and  coordinate  daily  project  activities,  manage  contracts  including  those  for \nconsultants and contractors, convene the steering committee, and liaise with other government \nand  outside  agencies;  (ii) develop  and  manage  the  community  water  transport  shipping \nfranchise routes; and (iii) support establishment and operation of the CWTF and issue payment \ninstructions for the water transport franchise subsidy from the investment income of the CWTF. \nThe PMU will be headed by  a project manager and  supported by a financial administrative \nofficer, community  liaison  officer(s),  and  an  engineer,  all  of  whom  would be competitively \nselected, and subject to ADB's approval.  \n \n2.  Steering Committee  \n42.  A  steering  committee  for  the  Project  will  comprise  industry  and  community \nrepresentatives as well as representatives of the Department of National Planning and Rural \nDevelopment,  the  Department  of  Treasury,  the  Department  of  Finance,  Department  of \nTransport, Department of Provincial and Local Level Governments, Department of Health, \nDepartment of Education, Department of Agriculture and Livestock, and external agencies \nsupporting rural development. The steering committee will actively monitor, guide, and facilitate \nthe Project\u2019s timely implementation and access to officials and data. The Project Manager will \ncoordinate convening of the steering committee on a quarterly basis. The steering committee \nwill comment on the PMU\u2019s quarterly reports on the Project.  \n                                                 \n15 The terms of the OPEC Fund loan would be 20-year maturity with a 5-year grace period, 2.5% annual interest, and \n1% service charge. \n ", "12  \n3.  Implementation Period \n43.  The project implementation period starts in May 2004 and ending in December 2011. \nThe Project implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 8. In 2004, the implementation \nactivities include placement of the CWTF in the capital markets, detailed specification of the \ncommunity water transport routes, community development survey work, detailed design and \nprocurement of the civil works, development of the small-craft safety programs, and the service \nfranchise tenders. Service franchise tenders will be awarded in 2006. Similar activities will be \ncompleted in 2007 for the second phase routes. ADB and the Government will jointly carry out a \nfundamental technical review of the Project in 2007. Second phase routes will be operational \nfrom 2007 to 2011.  \n \n4.  Procurement \n44.  Procurement under the Project, including that funded by the OPEC Fund, will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. All contracts for civil works exceeding \n$1 million will be awarded following international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Civil \nwork contracts below $1 million can be awarded following local competitive bidding procedures. \nContracts  for  equipment  below  $500,000  will  follow  the  international  shopping  procedure. \nPrequalification of contractors for ICB will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. ADB approval prior to the award of contract will be required for all contracts. \nADB will not be committed to financing contracts awarded without prior ADB approval. Tentative \ncontract packages are in Appendix 9. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n45.  International  and  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  required  for  (i) project \nadministration, (ii) community development, (iii) small-craft safety, and (iv) civil engineering and \nsupervision. The Government\u2019s request for advance recruitment action for the selection of these \nservices has been approved. These consulting services will be financed under the loan funds of \nthe Project. DOT will select appropriately qualified counterparts for each consultant for Project \nimplementation. DOT will select and engage the consultants as a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants,  using the quality and cost-based selection (QCBS) \nmethod, except for the  domestic project administration consultants who will be selected and \nengaged as individuals on a competitive basis in accordance with arrangements acceptable to \nADB. Outline terms of reference of the consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \na.  Project Administration \n46.  Project administration will be supported by consulting expertise in the fields of project \nmanagement, administration, procurement,  contract management, shipping and franchising, \nengineering supervision of marine structures, maritime safety, search and rescue operations, \nfinancial market operations, and training. Project administration is estimated to require a total of \nabout 312 domestic and 113 international consultant person-months. Special provisions in the \nloan have been earmarked for yearly financial auditing of the Project accounts. \n \nb.  Community Development \n47.  Community development will require international and domestic consulting expertise in \nthe fields of (i) community development and entrepreneurial training, (ii) community health and \ndistance  education,  (iii) rural  income  generation,  and  (iv)  community  awareness  and \n ", "  1 3\ncommunication strategies. These consultants will launch innovative community schemes in the \nmarginalized and vulnerable communities targeted by the proposed Project, covering activities \nin  micro-business,  health,  and  capacity  building.  Community  development  is  estimated  to \nrequire a total of about 108 domestic and 40 international consultant person-months.  \n \n     c.  Small-Craft Safety \n \n48.  The small-craft safety component  will require international and domestic consulting \nexpertise in the fields of public administration of small craft, small-craft safety equipment and \npolicing, radio networks, public information dissemination, and development of school curricula \non sea safety. This component is estimated to require a total of about 100 domestic and 50 \ninternational consultant person-months.  \n \nd.  Civil Engineering \n49.  The preconstruction activities for the small water transport infrastructure restoration \ncomponent require consulting expertise in the fields of  contract management,  marine civil \nengineering,  and  supervision.  These  consultants  will  support  the  preparation  of  detailed \nspecifications for the civil works contracts, contract documents, baseline benefit monitoring \nindicators, and tender processes. Civil engineering is estimated to require a total of about 40 \ndomestic and 20 international consultant person-months.  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n50.  Under the proposed implementation arrangements, the Government will allocate annual \ncounterpart funds for expenditures for 7 consecutive years. The loan proceeds will be disbursed \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, dated January 2001. All applications \nfor withdrawal for the disbursement of the loan funds for eligible expenditures will be carried out \n(i) by direct payment, (ii) by reimbursement procedures, and (iii) through an imprest account. \nThe initial amount of the imprest account will be $200,000 with a maximum payment of $50,000 \nfor any single item. The statement of expenditure procedure will be available for the proposed \nProject. Loan funds will also be disbursed for the CWTF subject to fulfillment of the conditions in \npara. 75.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n51.  The PMU will provide ADB and the Government with inception, quarterly progress, \nmidterm, and annual reports concerning the Project's plans, progress, outputs, and impact, \nincluding those related to sector policy reforms, CWTF management, franchise schemes, civil \nworks, and consulting services. These reports will provide concise and clear information on \nfinancial aspects, implementation progress and constraints, and recommendations for resolving \nproblems.  To  facilitate  postevaluation  of  the  Project,  the  PMU  will  provide  ADB  and  the \nGovernment, within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, with a completion report that \nwill cover comprehensively details of project implementation, benefits and costs, and any other \ninformation that may be requested by ADB concerning the Project.  \n \n52.  The Government, with the support of the PMU, will establish and maintain separate \naccounts for all expenditures under the proposed Project, including its individual components. It \nwill  furnish  ADB  with  financial  statements  reflecting  the  accounts  for  each  project-related \ncontract. These financial statements will be audited using appropriate auditing standards  by \nauditors acceptable to ADB. The audited financial statements, together with the auditor\u2019s report, \n ", "14  \nwill be forwarded to ADB within 9 months of the end of each related fiscal year. Auditing \ncharges are eligible for funding from the loan proceeds. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n53.  The PMU will compile and analyze data to facilitate project performance monitoring and \nevaluation. It will forward this information to ADB and the Government in accordance with the \nschedule  of  performance  measurement  indicators  agreed  in  the  project  framework.  This \nexercise aims to assess the macroeconomic impact and sector development goals of the \nProject. It includes three major activities: (i) benchmarking, to provide DOT management with \nobjective  reference  points  for  impact  evaluation  that  correspond  with  the  needs  of  the \nstakeholders and consumers; (ii) benefit monitoring, to ensure that the project benefits actually \naccrue to the target beneficiaries and that the poverty rate and indicators are reduced for \nremote coastal and inland communities; and (iii) post-project performance evaluation, to assess \nthe overall effectiveness of the Project. \n \n9.  Technical Review \n54.  In addition to twice yearly review meetings to monitor the progress of the Project, a \ntechnical review of the Project will be carried out jointly by the Government and ADB in years \n2006, 2008, and 2010, corresponding to the planned withdrawals from the CWTF. The focus of \nthe technical  review  will  be  to  (i) determine the functionality of the CWTF and its capital \nadequacy, and sources of replenishment, if warranted; (ii) determine if any deviations from the \nproject design or implementation are required; (iii) respond to assumptions and risks that might \nconstrain  the  satisfactory  implementation  of  the  Project  and  achievement  of  development \nobjectives; and (iv) review the amount required for subsidizing the structurally nonviable routes \non an ongoing basis. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Aspects  \n \n1.  Economic Analysis \n \n55.  The  detailed  economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  proposed  Project  with  the \nrespective sensitivity analyses are in Appendix 10 with details in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n56.  The  economic  benefits  resulting  from  the  Project  are  estimated  by  comparing  the \nsituations  with  and  without  the  Project.  The  economic  costs  of  the  community  transport \ncomponent include vessel acquisition and operational costs. These also include the funds \nplaced in the CWTF to finance the subsidy for the transport services. The costs of the small \nwater transport infrastructure component include the incremental costs associated with the \nimplementation  of  the  infrastructure  restoration,  such  as  detailed  engineering,  civil  works, \noperation, and maintenance. For community water transport, the benefits stem from enhanced \nmobility, increased affordability of inward transport of village supplies, and increased community \nincome levels as a result of enhanced export of village products. The small water transport \ninfrastructure restoration will lead to improved cargo handling efficiency, enhanced safety of \nlightering, and reduced cargo damage. The Project will also yield the following additional, \nnonquantified benefits: \n \n ", "  1 5\n(i)  Improvements  in  maritime  safety  will  evolve  from  the  education  and  public \nawareness  campaign,  the  introduction  of  small-craft  regulations,  and \nimprovements in small-craft equipment, marine communications, and search and \nrescue capability. This will, in turn, lead to reduction in loss of life and goods \nduring transit; and \n \n(ii)  Improvements in social services will result from better access to services at the \nlocal level and increased mobility of villagers to district and provincial centers. \n \n57.  Community Water Transport. Over the last 20 years, the availability, frequency, and \nquality of vessel services to rural coastal and river communities have declined as commercial \nvessel operators have withdrawn services and the Government has disposed of its trawler fleet \nof 51 vessels that served many rural areas of the country. Much travel and carriage of goods at \nthe village level now involve the use of small craft (banana boats) that are inefficient and unsafe. \nThe rising cost of gasoline in kina terms, largely due to the devaluation of the currency against \nthe  US  dollar,  has  exacerbated  the  effects  of  high  fuel  consumption.  More  economical \nalternatives, particularly boats with diesel-fueled engines, have improved vessel economics and \noffer more affordable transport to the remote and disadvantaged communities. The economic \nevaluation of the community transport component of the Project involved examination of seven \nroutes in PNG judged to be significantly deficient in community water transport. The benefits of \nwater  transport  were  considered  using  resource  cost  savings  from  the  existing  vessel \noperations and the consumer surplus from the induced traffic. The sum of these forms the gross \nbenefits of this component of the Project. The benefits were estimated from the willingness of \nusers to pay for vessel services on the basis of market observations.  \n \n58.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) equalizes the present values of economic \ncosts and benefits that accrue to the national economy. An economic net present value of the \nProject reflects a return in excess of the discount rate of 12%. Economic values for costs and \nbenefits are obtained by extracting taxes and duties, and by applying a conversion factor to \nexternal prices to reflect their value in local terms. External components are adjusted to their \nlocal values using a shadow exchange rate of 1.1. The EIRRs of the seven cases ranged from \n13% to 38% with the economic net present values ranging from K0.2 million to K5 million.  \n \n59.  Community Water Transport Subsidy. The financial evaluations of the seven vessel \nservices indicate that most of the community vessel services required in PNG are unlikely to be \nfinancially viable at the outset without a subsidy. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \ncalculations of the financial analysis do not address all the conditions that a private sector \noperator faces in the development of private vessel services in PNG, including the cost of \ncapital for asset procurement. To examine the impact of these conditions, the evaluation model \nfor the case was expanded into a financial model that contains an income statement, cash-flow \nstatement, balance sheet, a table of financial ratios (including the FIRR on total and equity \ncapital in real and nominal terms), and cost input tables, including one that includes the cost of \nfinancing, taxation, and typical private sector returns on equity capital. \n \n60.  The subsidy for the Rai Coast case was calculated as the amount of additional revenue \nthat is necessary to provide a 15% real, after-tax FIRR on equity capital. Only under these \nconditions will the community transport franchise scheme be able to apply the private-public \npartnership model proposed under the Project. The subsidy was structured over three time \nperiods with annual subsidies within each period: an initial 3 years, a second 3 years at a \nsubsidy level of two thirds that of the first period, and a final 4 years at a subsidy level of one \nthird that of the first period. Beyond the 10th year, the subsidy is zero. The base case subsidy for \n ", "16  \nthe Rai Coast case is estimated at K0.17 million for each year of the first 3-year period. The \nsensitivity evaluations show that the subsidy is most sensitive to variations in the tariff level, \noperating costs, and the FIRR on equity that the private investor requires. All seven evaluations \nwere conducted in nominal terms (i.e., they included inflation applied to capital items, operating \ncosts, and revenue), and the requirement for subsidies was calculated as the required return on \ncapital minus net income (revenue minus expenses). The resulting average subsidy for these \nseven vessel services is estimated in 2001 kina at K280,000 a year per service for the first 3-\nyear period, K100,000 a year for the second 3-year period, and K50,000 a year for the final 4-\nyear period.  \n \n61.  Small  Water  Transport  Infrastructure  Restoration.  The  evaluation  of  the \ninfrastructure restoration component involves tradeoffs between cargo handling efficiency with \nand without the Project, the cost of lightering, cargo damage with lightering, and the costs of the \nProject. In the case of cargo damage due to lightering, a unit cargo value of K3,000 per ton was \nestimated from surveys of inbound village goods, which are the dominant category of products, \nand K500 per ton for outbound produce. It was assumed that the damage factor for lightered \ncargo is 2% of its value. \n \n62.  All 63 infrastructure subprojects considered in this study were screened for economic \nfeasibility. The screening process drew on a general evaluation of lightering versus fixed \ninfrastructure investment. A total of 40 sites passed the screening process at a financial cost of \nabout K16 million. The overall infrastructure restoration component generates an EIRR of about \n17% and a net present value of about K4.4 million. As the sensitivity analyses show, the overall \ninfrastructure restoration component is much less sensitive to changes in external parameters \nthan the individual sites.  \n \nB.  Social Considerations \n \n63.  The Project will target communities and waterway networks where the residents are \neconomically and socially marginalized due to deficient marine transport services. Communities \ndependent on water transport in the selected areas are characterized as the poorest in the \ncountry with more than half of the population living in poverty on less than $1 a day. They have \naccess to very limited transport and declining (in many cases, nonexistent) social services. \nCommerce in these areas is severely curtailed by uneconomical movement of village products, \ndeclining production and income levels, and increased cost of basic goods. Health conditions \nare also negatively affected due to restricted access to public health services, medication, and \nimmunization; most families in these areas suffer from poor nutrition, for many consisting of a \ntwo-product daily diet, constrained access to clean water, and limited access to education. The \nhouseholds  in  the  affected  areas  are  growing  increasingly  marginalized,  isolated  from \nknowledge and service networks, and with rapidly diminishing social capital. \n \n64.  The  Project  will  employ  a  systematic  approach  to  poverty  reduction,  using  four \ncomplementary  strategies:  (i) establishment  of  water  transport  services,  (ii) development  of \nsupporting infrastructure, (iii) promotion of maritime safety, and (iv) development of community \ncapacity. These strategies involve a range of national, provincial, district, and community-based \nactivities.  To  optimize  benefits  of  water  transport  services,  small-scale  projects  will  be \ndeveloped in collaboration with community stakeholders and village councils. These activities \nwill empower local communities to critically assess their own needs and capabilities and to be \nactively involved in identifying solutions. These programs will be based on local knowledge and \ndesigned in collaboration with community stakeholders. The Project will also play a critical role \nin ensuring access of the disadvantaged and remote communities to complementary poverty \n ", "  1 7\nreduction projects in marginalized areas, funded by the Government or by other external \nassistance programs. These will include enhancement of village agricultural production and new \nincome-generating  schemes;  building  capacity  and  skills  for  small  business  management; \nincreasing awareness of family health and education needs; and enhancing participation in civic \naffairs. \n \n65.  The Project will reduce poverty in disadvantaged areas and provide direct and indirect \nbenefits for marginalized groups, including women and children. Inhabitants of the affected \nareas are indigenous to these areas and include no other minorities. Thus, indigenous people \nare not negatively affected as a result of the Project, but constitute the project beneficiaries. The \nProject will help generate higher household incomes to meet basic family welfare needs; \nincrease personal safety and greater mobility; reduce geographical and gender disparity in \nenrollment rates at both primary and secondary school; lower rates of preventable disease, \nmorbidity, and mortality; and improve family planning, HIV/AIDS awareness, and childhood \nimmunization rates. Both children and women are major beneficiaries of the Project. \n \nC.  Environmental Aspects  \n \n66.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared for 21 identified  sub-project \nsites.  The  IEEs  of  the  21  subprojects  are  in  a  supplementary  appendix  (Supplementary \nAppendix F). For evaluation purposes, the summary initial environment examination (SIEE) for \nthe replacement of the provincial wharf in Kandarian, West New Britain with the most extensive \npotential negative environmental impact is shown in Appendix 11. A detailed environmental \nimpact assessment is unnecessary. For subprojects in component 3 that do not have an IEE \nand will involve primarily repair, upgrade, and maintenance works costing less than $250,000, \napproval by the relevant government agency of the safety and environmental aspects will be \nsufficient;  for  subprojects  above  $250,000  but  less  than  $1.0 million,  the  EA  will  prepare  \nsummary initial environment examination in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines for ADB to \nevaluate on a \u201cno-objection\u201d basis. For subprojects exceeding $1.0 million, the EA will furnish an \nIEE to ADB for its approval prior to award of contract. The Project supports the establishment of \na Protection of the Sea Levy that will enable capability within the NMSA to reduce any potential \noil spill impacts in PNG waters. In this regard, the Project will have a potential beneficial impact \non the environment. \n \nD.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n67.  Under the Project\u2019s first phase component for small water transport infrastructure, 40 \nsites have been selected for restoration works. The sites are small and over water or the \nintertidal zone with more than 95% of sites currently being used for similar purposes\u2014landing \nsmall craft, and for loading and unloading goods and passengers. Where structures are to be \nmoved, they will be repositioned within the existing land agreement made during the original \nconstruction of the facility. The Project involves no relocation. \n \nE.  Project Risks and Safeguards \n \n68.  The primary risks to the Project stem from potential decline in the political will to \nestablish  the  proposed  NMSA,  inadequate  implementation  safeguards  for  the  use  of  the \ninvestment income for the predetermined purpose, and unavailability of counterpart funds.\n ", "18  \n \n  1.  Promulgation of National Maritime Safety Authority \n \n69.  The  Government\u2019s  political  commitment  could  weaken,  resulting  in  a  delayed \nestablishment of a fully functioning NMSA and implementation of the sector reform program. \nThe complexity of the political processes in PNG may result in unsatisfactory performance on \nthe sector reform agenda, including implementation of the staff retrenchment program.  \n \n70.  The maritime sector reform process was initiated prior to the current Government\u2019s \ntenure. The maritime sector reform program has not been opposed in the political discussions \nand has received broad-based support from the political parties, public administration, industry, \nand civil society. The draft legislation for the establishment of the NMSA was completed with the \nsupport of ADB-administered TA. The current Government approved the NMSA proposal and \nthe legislation of the Act was approved on 24 September 2003. Elements of the maritime sector \nreform program have been confirmed in the loan covenants of Loan 1754-PNG: Rehabilitation \nof the Maritime Navigation Aids (footnote 3).  \n \n  2.  Safeguards on Use of Trust Dividend \n \n71.  The CWTF will be established as a trust under PNG laws with clear management, and \ninvestment and distribution policy. Changes to the deed of trust will require unanimous approval \nof the trustees and the endorsement of ADB. The capital investment fund will be invested in \nconservative and long-term investment portfolios in domestic and international capital markets, \nand, thus, the principal amount of the CWTF cannot be drawn down without prior consultation \nwith  the  trustees,  and/or  the  fund  managers.  The  generated  income  from  international \ninvestments will be repatriated only when needed and in the amount needed, and be deposited \ninto a single account with the Bank of Papua New Guinea. Payments to finance the subsidy will \nbe made directly to commercial bank accounts of the transport operators on a quarterly basis by \nthe Bank of Papua New Guinea from the CWTF dedicated Kina account for investment income, \nbased on the payment instructions signed by at least two trustees. \n \n  3.  Availability of Counterpart Funds  \n \n72.  As the Government\u2019s resources for counterpart funds have recently become increasingly \nlimited, the Project accommodates an increase in the project cost-sharing ratio, with ADB\u2019s loan \nfinancing all foreign costs (less IDC for the cofinanced loan), and the OPEC Fund cofinancing \nlocal costs associated with infrastructure and equipment. The counterpart cost share was thus \nreduced from 25% to 18%. The Government\u2019s strategy is to improve services in rural areas and \nit has underscored its commitment to allocate the indicated amounts.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n73.  The  Government  and  EA  have  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the \nstandard assurances, which are incorporated in the Loan Agreement: \n \n(i)  The  Government  will  maintain  dialogue  with  ADB  on  the  status  of  relevant \ntransport issues, including maritime safety and rescue operations and plans, oil \nspill prevention, tariffs for user charges, sector funding, institutional organization, \nand external assistance. \n ", "  1 9\n \n(ii)  The  Government  will  budget  adequate  counterpart  funding  in  the  minimum \namount  of  $1.0 million  equivalent  in  2004  and  $0.6 million  annually  in  the \nsubsequent 7 years for the purposes of project implementation in accordance \nwith the financing plan. \n \n(iii)  Small maritime transport infrastructure restoration proposed to be funded under \nthe Project will meet agreed eligibility criteria as described in Supplementary \nAppendix D. \n \n(iv)  For  the  first  phase  of  the  small  water  transport  infrastructure  restoration \ncomponent, the Government will cause (a) the EA to screen all proposed sites \nbefore  the  award  of  civil  works  contacts  to  ensure  that  there  are  no  land \nacquisition  or  resettlement  effects;  (b)  the  EA  will  not  undertake  any  site \ndevelopment that requires land acquisition or generates resettlement effects, \nwhich include loss of housing, other assets, resources and/or income for both \ntitled and nontitled people.  \n \n(v)  For  the  second,  third,  and  fourth  phases  of  the  small  water  transport \ninfrastructure restoration component, in the event of involuntary resettlement \narising out of land acquisition required for the Project, the Government will \nensure (a) that such resettlement is carried out in accordance with the relevant \ngovernment  guidelines  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and \nHandbook on Resettlement and in case of discrepancies between the Borrower\u2019s \nprocedures and ADB\u2019s requirements, ADB\u2019s requirements shall apply; and (b) \nthat all required land is acquired and compensation and other assistance are \nprovided  to  people  affected  as  required  by  ADB's  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement prior to approval of tender for the respective construction contracts. \n \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that all civil works under the Project are carried out \nin accordance with Environmental Assessment Requirements and Environmental \nReview  Procedures  of  ADB,  and  other  applicable  ADB  guidelines,  that \nenvironmental impact mitigation plans are prepared for all civil works, and that \nmitigation is carried out by the contractors and monitored by the construction \nsupervisors in accordance with the prepared mitigation plans.  \n \n(vii)  Within 12 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will establish a project \nperformance evaluation system and will carry out project performance evaluation \nin accordance with the performance measurement indicators and implementation \nschedules agreed between DOT and ADB.  \n \n(viii)  The CWTF will be exempt from any tax or duty in PNG and will be authorized to \ninvest funds in the international capital markets without restriction. \n \n(ix)  The Government will obtain the approval of ADB prior to any amendment of the \ndeed of trust establishing the CWTF. \n   \n74.  The Government and EA have agreed to the following conditions to effectiveness of the \nProject, which are incorporated in the Loan Agreement: \n \n ", "20  \n(i)  Establishment of a legally valid and binding trust fund (CWTF) to finance the \nsubsidy associated with the community water transport services, and civil works \nand engineering of the small water transport infrastructure restoration associated \nwith the second, third, and fourth phases of the community water transport \nservices through the execution of a deed of trust substantially in the form as \ndescribed in Supplementary Appendix B; and  \n \n(ii)  The Government will make available to the CWTF the counterpart funding in the \namount of at least $1.0 million equivalent. \n \nB.  Conditions for Disbursement \n \n75.  The Government and EA have agreed to the following conditions for withdrawal of loan \nproceeds  of  the  CWTF  component  of  the  Project,  which  are  incorporated  in  the  Loan \nAgreement:  \n \n(i)  The CWTF shall have entered into an investment management agreement with \none or more fund managers, acceptable to the Bank, to manage its funds and/or \nthe CWTF shall have provided the Bank with a letter specifying the investment \nfunds, acceptable to the Bank, it will be investing in and the respective amounts \nof investment for each investment; and \n \n(ii)  The CWTF shall have opened a bank account in Kina with the Bank of Papua \nNew Guinea and a bank account in convertible foreign currency with a bank \nacceptable to the Bank. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n76.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve: (i) the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 12,830,000 to Papua New Guinea for the Community Water Transport \nProject from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the  Board;  and  (ii) the \nadministration by ADB of the loan in an amount not exceeding $4,000,000 to Papua New \nGuinea for the Community Water Transport Project to be provided by the OPEC Fund for \nInternational Development. \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                        Tadao Chino \nPresident \n \n \n25 February 2004 \n ", " \n                                     Appendix 1    21\n \n \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Project Monitoring  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nSector Goal       \nReduction of poverty  Reduce by 50% the share of  Baseline and Benefits  National income data \namong the  people whose income is less  Monitoring Evaluation (BME)  and detailed human \nmarginalized maritime  than one dollar a day.

The  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Strategy  1997\u20132002  (MTDS)  places \nimportance on providing services to rural communities. The National Transport Development \nPlan (NTDP) 2001\u20132010 confirmed these objectives and mandated the Department of Works \nand Transport (DOWT)1 to participate in establishing rural infrastructure and transport services. \nNTDP also consolidates the Government\u2019s sector reform program within the context of its \noverall  public  sector  reform.  The  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy\u2014a  basis  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s subsequent MTDS\u2014defines in its third pillar a pronounced need for rural and \ncommunity focus in the provision of transport services and infrastructure as a critical foundation \nfor enabling access of the rural poor to social services and economic opportunities. \n \n1.  Current Maritime Sector Governance  \n2.  The principal legislation for the regulation of merchant shipping and the maritime sector \nis  the  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  Merchant  Shipping  Act  1975,  Chapter  No.  242,  and  its \nsubsidiary regulations as amended from time to time, and the National Seas Act, Chapter 361 \n(enacted 1978). This allocates to the Department of Transport (DOT), among its other functions, \na responsibility for the maritime safety services. Its current structure is divided into three main \nareas of responsibility: transport policy and planning; the administration of transport services; \nand internal administration, each supervised by a deputy secretary. The Maritime Transport \nDivision (MTD) is responsible for maintaining and developing safe and efficient water transport \nservices in the country. The larger of MTD\u2019s two branches is the Marine Safety Branch, with the \nprincipal  functions  to  manage  (i) navigation  aids,  (ii) search  and  rescue,  (iii) oil  spills  and \ndisaster  prevention,  (iv) ship  surveys,  (v) port  state  control  and  small  boat  safety,  and \n(vi) liabilities under international conventions. The Shipping Administration Branch is responsible \nfor shipping and seafarers\u2019 registration, licensing, certification, and related monitoring activities, \nand for the administration of aspects of PNG\u2019s inland water transport system. \n \n 3.  At present, however, MTD is not appropriately resourced to provide these services \nwhich, as a consequence, have seriously deteriorated to the point where half of the navigation \naids are nonoperational. Additionally, MTD is unable to support the development of safe and \nefficient water transport. As the industry no longer receives these public sector services, it faces \nincreased expense from having to provide maritime safety on its own, and therefore lands \ngoods and persons at more marginal revenues. It is increasingly reluctant to pay maritime \nservice fees, which in turn impacts on the Government\u2019s ability to finance the sector. As a result, \nthe shippers are making expensive adjustments to voyage routes and schedules to overcome \nthe shortcomings and the users of shipping services face expensive transport costs, as well as \nunreliable, infrequent, and in many cases nonexistent water transport services.  \n \n4.  The Government has, with the support of a Functional Expenditure Review carried out in \n2001, examined the weaknesses in this arrangement and concludes that the Department and \nparticularly  its  MTD  is  unable  to  effectively  discharge  its  responsibilities.  This  examination \ndisclosed, among others, the following concerns:  \n \n                                                           \n1  Since preparation of the NTDP, DOWT has been divided into a Department of Works and Department of Transport  \n(DOT),  with  the  latter  assuming  responsibilities  for  the  maritime  transport  subsector.  No  changes  were \nimplemented in DOT\u2019s structure or functions as a result of the organizational split. ", "26  Appendix 2 \n \n(i)  unsafe boating practices are common and small craft are frequently lost at sea \nwith  the  number  of  accidents  and  deaths  at  unacceptably  high  levels  with \nparticularly high casualty rates for women and children; \n(ii)  there  is  inadequate  provision  of  shipping  services  to  maritime  communities \nthroughout PNG, especially to remote islands, and inadequate maintenance of \nwharves and jetties;  \n(iii)  a high proportion of the country's maritime navigational aids are not maintained \nand have deteriorated to the point at which only one third of the navigation aids \nare in service; \n(iv)  MTD\u2019s capacity to license seafarers is weak, preventing the country from meeting \ninternational convention obligations;2 \n(v)  MTD has only limited capability to eliminate substandard foreign vessels and it is \nunable to fulfill its responsibilities for conducting ship surveys and inspections of \nPNG-registered vessels;  \n(vi)  the Government's fleet of vessels, which has been phased out, has not been \nreplaced by private shipping services to the communities, resulting in under-\nservicing, which has adversely affected the delivery of health and education \nservices, as well as relief supplies; \n(vii)  the financial costs of search and rescue are increasing; and \n(viii)  MTD has experienced constraints in raising revenue due to (i) limited collection \ncapability, (ii) funding is not disbursed from fiscal sources as required for the \nDepartment to undertake its activities, and (iii) the budget that is received has not \nalways been used productively.  \n \n5.  The Government is implementing a navigation rehabilitation program with the support of \na loan funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).3 In restoring the maritime sector services, \nthe Government fully recognizes that the necessary physical reconstruction of the navigational \nfacilities and small wharves is only a partial response to the problem. This program recognizes, \nhowever, that the root causes of the deterioration of the maritime safety services are largely \ninstitutional and include (i) insufficient resources allocated for maintenance of navigation aids, \n(ii) lack  of  capacity  to  collect  sufficient  funds  for  operation  and  maintenance,  (iii) lack  of \ncustomer focus by management and consequent lack of targeted planning, (iv) lack of financial \nmanagement and inventory control, (v) lack of clear objectives in provision of maritime safety \nservices and navigation aids, and (vi) lack of effective community outreach and liaison with \naffected landowners with consequent problematic land claims and grievances and widespread \nvandalism of navigation aid structures. \n \n6.  The Government is, therefore, committed to a sector reform program that will establish \nthe  maritime  services  to  international  standards  and  install  an  appropriate  management \nstructure  and  adequate  and  sustainable  funding.  The  reforms  aim  to  improve  sector \nmanagement and performance, maritime asset management, and service provision, including \nthat to remote maritime and river-based communities. Within the NTDP, the Government has \nalready  set  up  the  Civil  Aviation  Authority,  separating  aviation  and  airport  management \noperations to an autonomous statutory authority. It has furthermore prepared a submission to \nthe National Executive Council (NEC) for the establishment of an Interim Road Authority that \nwould be responsible for the road functions of DOWT. In the same vein, NTDP mandates the \nGovernment to undertake maritime sector reorganization and has established the National \n                                                           \n2  Particularly the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch Keeping for Seafarers, \n1978. \n3  ADB. 2000.

As a result \nit  will  separate  the  maritime  safety  functions  to  the  planned  NMSA.  DOT  is  subsequently \nenvisaged to develop capability to operate as a sector regulator and an intermodal transport \nplanner.  \n \n7.  A timely implementation of the sector reform plan is crucial for enabling PNG to facilitate \nsafe and efficient marine services. The Government has embarked on the maritime sector \nrestructuring plan and has (i) implemented increased navigation lights dues, (ii) established a \ntrust account as an interim financial depository of the user revenues, (iii) disengaged from the \nSepura navigation aids vessel\u2014an inappropriate vessel for servicing the current navigation \naids, and (iv) has received approval of the NEC for the preparation of oil pollution legislation for \nfinancing management of the national oil spill contingency plan and hydrographic function within \nthe planned NMSA.  \n \n8.  In establishing the NMSA, it is essential for the Government to dissolve the defunct MTD \nthat is unable to operate under the central budget and personnel management system. The \nGovernment  is  currently  preparing,  with  support  of  technical  assistance,4  a  Parliamentary \nsubmission for establishment of the NMSA. This is seen as an opportunity to resolve the \nsector\u2019s long-standing problems. The sector has suffered from an underfunded and ineffective \ngovernment agency, without the appropriate human resources or financial, information, and \npersonnel management systems. The objective of establishing the autonomous NMSA is to \nendow  it  with  a  sustained  and  efficient  capability  to  manage,  operate,  and  maintain  the \nrehabilitated navigation aids and provide maritime safety services at international standards \nboth to international and local shipping services. The reform program will improve the cost-\neffectiveness of the sector, reduce shipping overheads, and help reduce the cost of transport of \ngoods and persons to, from, and within PNG. Upon implementation of the NMSA, the balance of \nthe reform program includes (i) establishing domestic vessel survey and search and rescue \ncapabilities,  (ii) establishing  effective  arrangements  for  collecting  navigation  aids  dues, \n(iii) establishing  appropriate  land-lease  arrangements  for  aids  to  navigation,  (iv) community \nservice contracts for their routine maintenance, and (v) providing adequate shipping services to \nremote communities. \n \n9.  The establishment of NMSA will enable the sector to operate more effectively as it can \nassume institutional accountability for the sector services as a result of (i) restoration of the \nnavigation aids with ADB\u2019s loan funds and the Government\u2019s own contributions; (ii) increases in \nnavigation  aids  tariff,  and  establishment  of  the  oil  pollution  levy  and,  later,  the  regulatory \nservices levy on account of the improved service levels as a result of the physical navigation \naids  rehabilitation  and  establishment  of  hydrographic  services;  (iii) implementation  of \nmanagement and financial management systems institutionalizing accountability; (iv) improved \nremuneration schemes implementing merit-based staff performance monitoring; (v) reduction in \ntensions between landowners and the sector services through a systematic 4-year program for \npayment  of  land-claim  arrears;  (vi) private  sector  and  community  involvement  in  the \nmaintenance of physical assets through the improved financial position of the sector under an \nautonomous and self-funding institution; (vii) clarity established for sector responsibility through \nengagement  of  an  NMSA  chief  executive  officer  and  the  identified  relationship  with  the \nGovernment; and (viii) a transparent and viable mechanism for enabling services to the remote \nand water-transport-reliant communities. Under such governance conditions, the Government is \nconfident that it can also transparently and effectively facilitate temporary subsidization of rural \nand  remote  water-transport  services  to  communities  where  such  minimal  services  are  a \n                                                           \n4  ADB. 2000.

The \nreform agenda requires one-off capitalization of the NMSA to finance its establishment costs \nincluding facilities and personnel, and funding of payments to landowners for the accumulated \narrears of land claims, so as to set it on a successful path from the start.  \n \n2.   Community Water Transport \n \n10.  A  direct  inverse  correlation  exists  between  access  to  affordable  and  reliable  water \ntransport  and  the  escalating  level  of  poverty  in  isolated  and  water-transport-dependent \ncommunities in PNG. Access to transport services and ease in intermodal transition have a \nsignificant impact on production and income levels, social and economic indicators, and the \noverall quality and desirability of rural life. In general, the communities with access to public \nservices and markets have also a satisfactory access to marine transportation. Deficiency in \ncommunity water transport has resulted from (i) the cessation of the government-operated cargo \nand passenger services; (ii) inability of the private sector to service these uneconomic, low-\ntraffic, and long routes; (iii) escalating cost of operating small outboard-motor-powered craft \n(\u201cbanana  boats\u201d)  due  to  unaffordable  fuel  prices  subsequent  to  the  depreciating  kina  and \nescalating  cost  of  fuel;  (iv) inefficient  utilization  of  small  craft;  (v) lack  of  credit  and \nentrepreneurial capacity at the local level for community-owned transport services; and (vi) lack \nof a regulatory framework and mechanisms to ensure maritime safety. \n \n11.  The levels of water transport services in PNG vary significantly, and many rural areas \nsuffer from a dependency on deficient water transport services and lack economical transport \nsystems for the movement of goods and persons. Marine infrastructure is absent in many \ncoastal and river areas with wharves and jetties nonexistent or in poor condition resulting in \nfurther reduction of economic and safe water transport. Currently, the services are unaffordable \nfor the inhabitants of most of the remote communities and inaccessible without exhausting travel \nby foot or other modes. Much of the existing water transport service is provided using banana \nboats with high operating costs and significant safety risks. Water transport safety has also \nbecome compromised by: overloading; long-distance travel; travel at night and during bad \nweather; unavailability of markers; lack of safety equipment; and inadequate search and rescue \nprocedures. Lack of a safety-oriented mentality among users and operators of water transport \nhas, in particular, resulted in loss of life at sea and in loss of goods.  \n \n12.  As the poorest of the water-transport-dependent communities primarily use chartered \nbanana boats for travel, they are subject to about 75% of the maritime accidents and casualties \nthat are reported in PNG waters. While reporting is extremely sketchy, an annual average of \n185 lives are lost per annum; most of these are related to small boats.5 Communities living in \nmaritime and river-route areas have indicated that 88%6 have lost a community member over \nthe last 5 years due to a boating accident; citing higher rates of women and children lost. The \nreasons for the accidents are (i) overcrowding of small boats, (ii) poor knowledge of motor \nmaintenance,  (iii) lack  of  route  planning  and  inappropriate  vessel  choice  for  the  maritime \nconditions, and (iv) poor piloting practices. In extreme instances of overloading, a boat operator \nin distress puts people in the water for later pick up, while unloading the boat nearby or \npassengers are forced to accept a passage regardless of the maritime or piloting conditions as \nthe fare has been paid upfront. In these communities, there was limited choice of transport and \n                                                           \n5  Analysis of the maritime accident and incident statistics reveals significant deficiencies and are not, consequently, \nexpected to reflect the actual magnitude of the problem.  \n6 During February and March 2002, 25 communities in five different provinces were visited and 22 communities \nreported loss of life and drownings during the last 5 years. ", "Appendix 2  29\n \n \nsmall boats were the only source of water transport. The communities further revealed that they \nhad not seen a life jacket and that boats did not have safety equipment. \n \n13.  Extensive multifaceted community impacts arise from deficient water transport services. \nInaccessible, unaffordable, and unreliable water transport in remote coastal and river areas has \nled  to  an  increasing  number  of  communities  becoming  marginalized  from  mainstream \ndevelopment efforts without satisfactory access to essential services and markets necessary for \nlivelihood and survival. Although variable, the following poverty indicators and trends are evident \nin these marginalized areas: \n \n(i)  income of less than one dollar per day;  \n(ii)  poor diet with two staple food items and high rates of nutritional deficiency; \n(iii)  lack of clean water supply; \n(iv)  inadequate immunization rates and rise in the rates of preventable illnesses, \nespecially malaria and gastroenteric diseases; \n(v)  low educational attainment, especially grade 6 graduates; \n(vi)  systematic nonavailability of a full course of primary education; and \n(vii)  low attendance at secondary school, as only around one in 30 primary school \nstudents goes on to secondary school. \n \n14.  In PNG, water transport is central to poverty reduction and economic growth. In the \nenvironment of the long- and low-traffic routes, however, many of the necessary water transport \nservices are not financially viable and do not attract private sector operators. Nevertheless, the \ncommunities countrywide need to be served by a minimal access to district centers, regional \nmarkets for basic goods and income generation, and social services, including health and \neducation. For the remote island- and river-based communities, water transport serves an \nimportant role in the development process, and is crucial to delivery of essential life-sustaining \nservices  such  as  health,  education,  and  extension  services.  Transport  provides  access  to \nmarkets  and  employment,  and  contributes  to  security  and  strengthening  of  nationhood  by \nallowing the administration to reach its population. The disadvantaged communities in PNG see \ntransport infrastructure and services as a key factor in their life and crucial to reducing the \nconditions that prevent them from leaving poverty behind.  \n  \n15.  Many  of  the  potential  users  of  community  water  transport  service  live  in  noncash \ncommunities or have a limited ability to pay for the service. The Government has committed to \nproviding an enabling environment to reduce the scarcity of access that currently challenges the \nremote and rural maritime and river-based communities. Establishment of these services at a \nminimum  and  safe  level  and  cost-effectively  calls  for  a  hybrid  private-public  partnership. \nProvision of water transport most efficiently to remote communities involves technically qualified \nprivate sector transport operators. However, these operators cannot supply remote transport \nservices at an affordable tariff for the disadvantaged communities. The Government recognizes \nthis in light of its past efforts to provide transport services through a government-owned vessel \nfleet that could not operate viably. A subsidy must be made available to enable the private \nsector to provide a minimum service level. As the linkages between the water transport services \nand poverty reduction through access to markets lead to improvement of income conditions in \nthe rural communities, the level of the subsidy will fall. Reinforced with the planned extension \nservices  to  improve  the  communities\u2019  awareness  of  the  opening  opportunities  through  the \nimproved transport services, the generated additional need for travel and increase in income \nlevels  allows  for  the  implementation  of  a  break-even  tariff  and  an  exit  strategy  from  the \nsubsidized services. The Government can, subsequently, provide a continuing phased program, ", "30  Appendix 2 \n \nprogressively  identifying  the  minimum  necessary  water  transport  services  and  targeting \ncountrywide access coverage gradually to all remote communities.  \n \n16.  The Government plans to establish a community water transport trust fund (CWTF) \nunder a deed with a board of trustees under the purview of the Bank of PNG to finance the \nsubsidy  associated  with  the  water  transport  franchise  scheme.  The  franchise  scheme  will \neffectively enable private operators to provide transport services on nonviable routes facilitating \nminimal access of remote and poor communities of the country. These route franchise schemes \nwill  be  tendered  based  on  minimum-subsidy  tender  processes,  in  which  the  subsidy  is \ntransparent  and  quantifiable.  The  tenders  will  be  repeated  every  3  years  to  capture  the \ncommunities\u2019 increased demand and ability to pay for the transport services. Each separate \nroute is foreseen to become increasingly self-funding, with most reaching commercial viability in \n10 years. The principal amount of the CWTF would be financed by loans provided by ADB and \nthe Government\u2019s counterpart funds, and thus relies on ADB\u2019s support of the Government\u2019s \nprogram. The principal from the ADB loan proceeds will be invested in the international capital \nmarkets and the principal from the counterpart funds will be invested in the domestic capital \nmarket using the appropriate safeguards, controls, and monitoring mechanisms, together with a \nwell-defined dividend policy to channel the generated revenues to finance the water transport \nroute franchise subsidy. The generated revenues will be paid into an account opened with the \nBank of PNG and the payments to the transport services providers will be paid by the Bank of \nPNG  upon  authorization  of  the  board  of  trustees,  triggered  by  requests  of  the  project \nmanagement unit. The Government has prepared a legal submission for the establishment of \nCWTF, and presented this to the Cabinet in June 2003. \n \n17.  The  contribution  that  transport  services  and  infrastructure  make  toward  poverty \nreduction in the remote island and river communities, human development, and life-sustaining \nactivities is uncontested in PNG. Linkages\u2014between transport services and infrastructure and \nthe potential of rural development activities for reducing poverty and raising income levels\u2014are \nalso recognized under the Government\u2019s poverty reduction policy. Direct linkages between \ncommunity water transport and improvement in social and economic conditions, women\u2019s and \nchildren\u2019s health, educational attainment, and employment require the Government\u2019s active role \nin the provision of community water transport.  \n \n ", "                            Appendix 3  31\n       \n \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT \n \nA.    Introduction  \n \n1.  The objective of the Project is to reduce poverty in coastal and river communities with \ndeficient water transportation through improved maritime services. Examination of the poverty \nincidence and characteristics of poverty in Papua New Guinea (PNG) revealed a strong inverse \ncorrelation  between  accessibility  of  affordable  and  reliable  water  transport  services  and \nescalating  levels  of  poverty  in  isolated,  water-transport-dependent  areas.  The  research \nconcluded that ease of access to transport services, marine and otherwise, has an increasingly \nsignificant impact on production and income levels, social and economic indicators of well-\nbeing, and the overall quality and desirability of rural life. \n \nB.  Socioeconomic Conditions \n \n2.   With a population of 5,130,365 in 2000,1 and an average growth of 2.7% from 1994 to \n2000, PNG has shown only moderate population growth in comparison to other Pacific island \neconomies, where population growth rates of 3\u20134% are normal. PNG has especially low social \nindicators when compared with its neighbors in the South Pacific. In the 2002, United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) Human Development Report, PNG ranked 133 out of 173 \nnations with only 57% of women over the age of 15 literate; the fertility rate in 1995\u20132000 was \nhigh at 4.6; life expectancy at birth is only 56.7 years; and 35% of all children in PNG are \nunderweight. The Government is aware of these issues and has agreed to focus on improving \nthe situation of its population. Improved maritime transportation, especially to rural and remote \nareas, will go a long way to supporting and improving social indicators and the quality of life for \nmen, women, and children. \n \n3.  The Project will employ a systematic community outreach approach to poverty reduction \nby  (i) enabling  a  water  transport  service  to  the  remote  and  disadvantaged  communities, \n(ii) restoring small water transport infrastructure, (iii) developing a small-craft safety mentality, \n(iv) developing communities\u2019 capacity to benefit from their economic potential and to maximize \nthe  use  of  water  transport,  and  (v) establishing  an  effective  sector  agency  through  the \nautonomous National Maritime Safety Authority (NMSA). \n \nC.    Government National Poverty Reduction Strategy  \n \n4.  The Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS) (2003\u20132007) is the main planning \ndocument  of  the  Government.  It  has  adopted  a  theme  to  reduce  poverty  through  rural \ndevelopment. The objectives of the MTDS are specified in the PNG National Poverty Reduction \nStrategy (NPRS). However, whereas the MTDS is a five-year strategy, the NPRS has been \ndesigned as a long-term strategy to be continued until all its goals and objectives are obtained. \nThe NPRS complements the MTDS in the short and medium terms, but to carries forward into \nthe next MTDS (2008\u20132013) for the long term. Participatory poverty assessments to determine \nappropriate  poverty  reducing  strategies  and  delivery  mechanisms2  concluded  that  poverty \nresults  from  weak  governance,  weak  social  support  systems,  inefficient  use  of  natural \nresources,  lack  of  economic  and  financial  growth  opportunities,  a  poorly  maintained \ninfrastructure network, and the inefficient delivery of, and lack of access to, basic services.  \n                                                           \n1  National Statistical Office of Papua New Guinea.

", "32  Appendix 3 \n7.   Poverty is widespread and growing, particularly among the rural coastal and river-based \ncommunities.  In  the  rural  areas,  poverty  is  especially  bad  due  to  sustained  low  levels  of \ninvestment, particularly in transportation infrastructure and services, agriculture productivity, \neducation, and health. Government outreach services are generally weak and ineffective, and in \nmany places nonexistent. About 2,000 coastal and river village communities in PNG comprise a \npopulation of over 500,000 people\u2014many of whom are among the country\u2019s most marginalized. \nThese communities report that the prohibitive cost of small vessel transport has decreased \naccess  to  local  markets\u2014consequently,  cash  incomes  have  progressively  diminished  and \nbecome unreliable. High transportation costs have also served to heighten vulnerability, restrict \nmovement, and limit access to basic services. Vulnerability has increased among economically \ndisadvantaged subgroups, such as women and children, as they are being excluded from \ntransportation services. \n \nD.    Government Policy for Poverty Reduction \n \n5.  The framework of the Government\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy involves five pillars that \nare  linked  to  expenditure  priorities  in  the  MTDS:  (i) basic  education,  (ii) primary  health, \n(iii) transport  infrastructure  and  maintenance,  (iv) law  and  order,  and  (v) income-generating \nopportunities  (especially  in  rural  areas).  The  third  pillar  of  the  poverty  reduction  strategy \naddresses the need to improve and maintain physical infrastructure with a goal to expand and \nimprove the maritime infrastructure and air services. The Government is determined to resolve \nthe current constraints to access of the rural population as the first priority. Rural and remote \ncommunities see improved marine transport services as their highest priority. The strategy \nrecognizes that the lack of transport impedes access to the essential marketing of community \nproducts and has led to a growing withdrawal of essential social service support, particularly \nteachers and health workers.  \n \n6.  The Project directly supports the Government\u2019s poverty strategy by supplying water \ntransport services where no or unaffordable services exist. These services are expected to lead \nto both direct and indirect poverty-reducing impacts, including reduction in transport costs and \nsubsequent  improvement  of  rural  cash  incomes;  improved  access  to  markets  leading  to \nincreased production and improved income generation; improved access to health services \nleading  to  increase  in  use  of  preventive  versus  curative  care;  improved  access  of  heath \nextension programs leading to greater vaccination rates and reduction in curable disease; and \nimproved access, so attracting educators to remote areas currently suffering from widespread \nand acute shortages of teachers\u2014this should have far-reaching implications through reduction \nin poor educational attainment levels. The compounding impact of these benefits of the Project \nwill result in increased cash incomes that enable the communities to improve living conditions \nthrough  small  self-help  projects,  such  as  construction  of  water  collection  tanks,  and \nimprovement of the daily diet. The poor quality of drinking water and diet deficiencies are the \nparamount reasons for the prevalence of anemia among remote rural communities. Better diets \nand clean water will improve tolerance of and recovery from the widely experienced and chronic \nmalaria and diarrhea generally contracted in early childhood.  \n \n7.  The third pillar of the poverty strategy also points to the need to strengthen sector \ngovernance  for  water  transport.  Through  its  Transport  Sector  Plan,  the  Government  has \nconfirmed  its  intention  to  reform  sector  management.  This  is  further  concretized  in  the \ngovernment policy letter, which highlights the intention to establish a National Maritime Safety \nAuthority (NMSA)\u2014an autonomous body with its own human resources policies, management, \nand focus on delivery of sector services. Legislative enactment for the NMSA is a condition of \neffectiveness under the proposed Project and its establishment is supported by the Project. The ", "                            Appendix 3  33\n       \n \nstructure and mandate of the planned NMSA facilitate rural services delivery and participation of \nthe  communities  in  maintenance  activities  of  the  small  water  transport  infrastructure  and \nnavigation aids. The Water Transport Franchise Unit with NMSA promotes community-based \napproaches that are expected to increase the level of outreach activities, including the new \ninvolvement  of  communities  in  the  maintenance  of  maritime  infrastructure.  Community \nengagement will ensure increased income generation sources in the remote areas and will \nfundamentally  improve  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  reach  marginalized  segments  of  the \npopulation, essential for the successful operation of NMSA. The poverty reduction impacts are \ndetailed in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nE.  Indigenous Peoples  \n \n8.  The majority of both the rural and urban population in PNG is indigenous with over 800 \nlanguages spoken. There is a traditional kinship (wantok) system that permeates most aspects \nof society with reference to people speaking the same language. Wantok kinship links the \ninformal social systems of the clans. The three common languages are English, Tok Pisin, and \nMotu,  used  particularly  in  the  coastal  areas.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  using  the \ntraditional  organizational  systems  engaging  the  clans  and  village  councils  headed  by  clan \nleaders  for  the  delivery  of  its  community  development  component,  small-craft  safety,  and \ninfrastructure maintenance, and will not adversely impact these systems nor the indigenous \npeoples. \n \n9.  In  the  urban  towns,  however,  small  minority  groups  exist  of  Southeast  Asian  and \nChinese descent. These minorities represent less than 1% of the population, do not inhabit the \nremote and disadvantaged areas, and are not located in the Project\u2019s transport routes.  \n \n10.   The community development component of the Project reflects the need to respect the \ntraditional values, systems, and beliefs and to ensure that that they are not degenerated through \nthe project activities. In the case of boating safety, the traditional methods, such as dug-out \ncanoes that did not permit overcrowding, are considered far safer than the modern fiber-glass \nbanana boats. The small-craft safety component of the Project aims to return to the traditional \nsafety practices and values, reinforcing kinship and a sense of responsibility for others.

The shipping franchise scheme, and the marine infrastructure to support the second to \nfourth phases of the scheme, will be financed by means of a dedicated fund, the Community \nWater Transport Trust Fund (CWTF). The CWTF will be an investment fund established under a \ntrust deed and hosted by the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG). It will be established as a \ntrust, with the initial capital supplied by the Government counterpart funding ($1 million), and \nloan funds of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) ($10 million). The CWTF will be (i) placed \nunder management by one or more reputable fund managers, selected through competitive \ntender, or (ii) invested directly in investment funds. The counterpart contribution of $1 million \nequivalent will be invested in the domestic capital market and the capital of the loan proceeds \ninvested  in  the  international  investment  funds,  taking  a  conservative  investment  approach \n(similar to that for pension funds). \n2.  The shipping franchise scheme will be introduced in phases, the first phase at one-and-\na-half years after project commencement, and the second, third, and fourth phases at 3-year \nintervals thereafter. Technical reviews will be carried out at the end of each phase, with a major \nsuch  review  at  the  start  of  the  second  phase  (5  years  after  the  franchise  scheme \ncommencement).  Shipping  franchise  contracts  will  be  awarded  to  the  private sector,  on a \nminimum payment (subsidy) basis to operate services to specified points of call, to an agreed \nfrequency and technical specification. Details of the shipping service franchise are given in \nSupplementary Appendix B.   \n3.   A dedicated operating account for the CWTF will be opened and held at BPNG. On a \nquarterly basis, drawings will be repatriated from the invested funds, sufficient to meet the \nquarterly funding requirements of the shipping franchise scheme together with drawings to \nfinance the infrastructure development component of the Project in later years. The quarterly \ndrawings will be paid into the BPNG account, where they will be held temporarily, pending \ndisbursement against certified invoices for services performed. The account will maintain only \nsufficient funds to meet the immediate payment commitments and the administrative costs of \noperating the CWTF. \n4.  The trustees of the CWTF will be the Governor of BPNG, the Secretary to the Treasury, \nthe Secretary of Planning and Rural Development, and the Secretary of Transport. The project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will act as a secretariat to the trustees. The powers and responsibilities \nof the trustees, the trust secretariat, and the legal framework for establishing the CWTF are \noutlined in section C of this Appendix and detailed in the draft deed given in Supplementary \nAppendix B.  \n5.  PMU will authorize invoices from the shipping franchise operators for payment by BPNG, \nsubject to any deductions for underperformance. The quarterly meetings of the trustees will \nauthorize BPNG to subsequently effect payment through the commercial banking system. \n6.  The CWTF will have a life of 20 years, at the end of which all of the capital and interest \nearned by the CWTF will have been drawn down, in payments to the shipping operators and to \nfund supporting marine infrastructure (such as small wharves, jetties, landing ramps, moorings, \ncargo sheds). ", "40  Appendix 6 \n \nB.  Financial Costs of the Shipping Franchise Scheme \n7.  Each phase of the franchise scheme comprises a number of service routes. The first \nphase routes are identified and comprise: (i) Upper and Lower Sepik, (ii) Ramu River Coast, \n(iii) Morobe Coast, (iv) Oro Coast, (v) South coast of East and West New Britain, (vi) South \ncoast of New Ireland, and (vii) South Fly River and southern coast of Western Province. \n8.  The number of service routes that can be included in the first phase will be limited by \n(i) the tender prices submitted by shipping operators and (ii) the earnings from the CWTF. \nUnder conservative assumptions, the $11 million is expected to generate an annual income of \nat least $330,000, corresponding to a 3% real rate of return, which would be available for \nfinancing the first phase franchise scheme.  \n9.  The  introduction  of  affordable  shipping  services  to  communities  that  are  either  not \nserved at all or only at a very high cost is forecast to release latent demand to participate in \ncash-income-producing  activities  such  as  smallholder  cash  crops  (copra,  cocoa,  rubber), \nfishing,  vegetables  and  spices,  livestock,  and  handicrafts.  There  will  be  a  corresponding \nincreased demand for imported store goods. The shipping service will also provide opportunities \nto access social services, in particular health and education, and for the Government to more \neconomically  and  effectively  deliver  extension  programs  for  these  services  as  well  as  for \nagriculture and small business. \n10.  The improved income, health, and education status of villages served by the shipping \nservices  will  make  shipping  services  gradually  more  affordable  as  demand  increases, \ngenerating economies of scale, and the ability of the target population to afford nearer to \ncommercially  viable  tariff  increases.  It  is  estimated  that  for  most  of  the  areas served,  full \ncommercial sustainability can be reached in a period of 9 years, after three rounds of service \ntendering.  Accordingly,  the  subsidies  would  progressively  fall,  by  one  third  of  the  original \namount at each subsequent re-tender, falling to zero by year 9. Subsequent phases of the \nsubsidy scheme would similarly achieve increasing commercial viability over time although, as \nthe  scheme  is  extended  to  more  remote  areas  with  thinner  transport  demand,  a  larger \nproportion would remain reliant on subsidies. These residual subsidized routes are estimated to \naccount for 10% of the first phase scheme, 20% of the second phase scheme, 30% of the third \nphase scheme, and 40% of the fourth phase scheme. \n11.  Infrastructure to support the later phases of the scheme is estimated to cost $3 million \nfor the second phase, $2 million for the third phase, and $1 million for the fourth phase. This \nwould require drawings of these capital sums in years 6, 9, and 12 of the Project. The franchise \nscheme subsidy would be met out of interest from the invested capital up to the end of the first \ncontract period (year 4.5). In later years, a progressively increasing proportion of the subsidy \npayments will be met from capital, as the CWTF is drawn down, until year 20 when the CWTF is \nexhausted. At that point all residual franchise routes that have not achieved commercial viability \nwill either require continuing direct budget support or an alternative funding mechanism, or will \nbe abandoned. The technical review at the start of the second phase of the scheme (year 5), \nwill consider the need or desirability of supplementing the CWTF with additional capital. The \nprojected CWTF balance and subsidy payments are shown in Figure A6. \n \n ", "Appendix 6  41\n \n  \n \nFigure A6: Community Water Transport Fund \n2nd   3rd  4th \nInfrastructure Infrastructure Infrastructure\nWithdrawal  Withdrawal  Withdrawal \n$3M  $2M $1M\n  0.60  12\nn\nm\n$\ne  0.50  10\nm\n \no n\nc m\nn 0.40  8 $\nt I e \nn c\ne n\ntm 0.30  6 ala\ns B\ne\nnv 0.20  4 nd \n& I Fu\ny \nd 0.10  2\nsi\nb\nu\nS 0.00  0\n                                         \n4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nYear\nShipping Franchise Subsidy Fund Balance Investment Income\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC.  General Legal Framework \n \n12.  The establishment of a trust for the CWTF specifically dedicated to the financing of \n(i) the subsidies for the water transport services and (ii) small water transport infrastructure civil \nworks after the first phase of the Project, is considered as an appropriate legal tool to ensure \nthat the funds allocated for these specific purposes are actually used only for these purposes \nand separated from other funds of the Government. \n \n13.  It  is  not  deemed  necessary  to  establish  the  CWTF  under  separate  and  specific \nlegislation as the concept of trust is familiar and part of the laws of PNG. The Office of the \nSolicitor General has confirmed that the trust fund could appropriately be established as a trust \ncreated under the trustees and Executors Act, Chapter No. 289 rather than as a trust account \nunder the Public Finance (Management) Act 1995. \n \n14.  The Loan Agreement between PNG and ADB will include a clause specifying that the \nCWTF is exempt from any tax or duty in PNG in order to ensure that the CWTF benefits from \nsuch  exemption  in  accordance  with  Part  IV(8)  of  the  Loans  and  Assistance  (International \nAgencies) Act, Chapter No. 132.  \n \n15.  The actual establishment of the CWTF as a trust fund will require the Government of \nPNG to enter into a deed of trust with trustees whereby the Government of PNG will settle an \namount equivalent to $11 million on the trustees who will have the obligation to use and \nadminister these funds in accordance with the terms of the deed of trust. \n ", "42  Appendix 6 \n \n1.  Major Terms of the Community Water Transport Trust Fund \n   \na.  The Trustees   \n \n16.  There  will  be  four  trustees  of  the  CWTF,  including  the  [Governor  of  BPNG,]  the \nSecretary of the Treasury Department, the Secretary of the Department of Planning and Rural \nDevelopment,  and  the  Secretary  of  the  Department  of  Transport.  Decision  making  by  the \ntrustees will require unanimous approval of the four trustees. \n \nb.  Use of the Funds Held in Trust \n \n17.  The trustees can use the funds only for three purposes: (i) investment through fund \nmanagers,  or  direct  investment  in  investment  funds,  (ii) distribution  to  the  water  transport \noperators that are awarded one or more franchise transport route by the PMU, and to pay for \nsmall water infrastructure civil works contracts under phases 2, 3 and 4, and (iii) expenses \nrelating to the administration of the trust (audit expenses, fund managers, etc.).  \n \nc.  Investment Policy of the Community Water Transport Trust Fund \n \n18.  The trustees will (i) appoint one or more fund managers,1 acceptable to ADB, which will \nmanage the investment of the funds of the CWTF, or (ii) invest funds directly in investment \nfunds. The capital of $1 million equivalent provided from the counterpart funds will be invested \nin the domestic capital market and the capital from the loan proceeds of $10 million will be \ninvested in the international capital market. The trustees will approve the investment policy of \nthe CWTF; however, the deed of trust will provide that the investment must be made on a \nconservative basis. \n \nd.  Distribution Policy of the Community Water Transport Trust Fund \n \n19.  The income from the investment of the funds or the principal amount of the fund will only \nbe repatriated as and when needed to make payments relating to the water transport contracts, \nsmall water infrastructure contracts, or administrative expenses. \n \ne.  Disbursements \n \n20.  The CWTF will open a kina account with BPNG where the income and principal of the \ninvestments will be repatriated from time to time (see para. (d) above). All expenditures of the \nCWTF will be debited from this account. Withdrawals from this account will only be effected by \ncheck or wire transfer. Members of the PMU shall perform the function of a secretariat to \nmanage the day to day non-financial administration of the CWTF. The secretariat shall be \naccountable to the Trustees and support the Trustees. The checks or wire transfer instructions \nwill need to be signed by at least two trustees. \n \nf.  Termination \n \n21.  The CWTF will not be established on a perpetual basis and will terminate 20 years after \nthe date of its creation. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Fund managers will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. ", "Appendix 6  43\n \n  2.  Control by Asian Development Bank \n \n22.  The deed of trust will include a provision whereby it cannot be amended without the prior \nconsent of ADB. Noncompliance with this provision will allow ADB to suspend or terminate the \nADB loan. \n ", "4\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES 4\n \nCoFsot rEesigtinmates Local GoFvoerFreniingmanen ncting (P$l'a0n00) OpeFco Freuingdn Local ADFBoreign  A            \np\nDescription Costs Costs Total Costs Local Costs Total Costs Costs Total Costs Local Costs Total Total p\ne\nn\nd\nA.

", "48  Appendix 10 \n \n \nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The Project focuses on delivery of water transport, improvement in marine infrastructure \nand  safety  services,  and  community  services  to  maximize  use  of  the  transport  provided. \nAdditionally,  the  Project  supports  maritime  sector  reforms  and  institutional  transformation. \nEconomic analysis is prepared for the delivery of the water transport services and infrastructure \nimprovements.  \n \nB.  Economic Evaluation of the Community Water Transport  \n \n2.  The rural areas of Papua New Guinea (PNG) have access to few or no commercial \nvessel services. These have declined particularly over the last 20 years as commercial vessel \noperators have withdrawn services and the PNG Government disposed of its fleet of 51 vessels \nthat served many areas of rural PNG. Much travel and carriage of goods at the village level now \ninvolves the use of banana boats. The banana boat\u2019s outboard motor also typically consumes \n30 liters/hour (l/h) at a cruising speed of 20 knots, and the unit cost (in kina per passenger-\nkilometer (km) or ton-km) is, consequently, very high. The cost of fuel dominates the costs of \nrunning banana boats; in financial terms, fuel comprises over 90% of total ownership and \noperating costs for voyages in excess of 100 km and reaches 70% for short voyages. In many \ncases, the cost of banana boat travel has become the cost of fuel. There are about 10,000 \nbanana boats in PNG, with about half of them operational. \n \n3.  The rising cost of gasoline in kina terms, largely because of the currency depreciation, \nhas exacerbated the effects of the high fuel consumption of outboard motors. A majority of \nvillagers have reduced travel because of the high cost of banana boats. A more economical \noption is the workboat, an enclosed vessel with cargo holds and deck of 10 meters in length and \npowered by a diesel engine. These carry 10\u201320 tons of cargo and 15\u201325 passengers, and \nconsume 10\u201315 l/h of diesel fuel. \n \n4.  Economic values in the analysis of costs and benefits were obtained by extracting taxes \nand duties adjusted to their local values using a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.1. The seven \nindividual vessel service cases evaluated as part of the study are presented below. These \ncases are the South Fly District of Western Province, the Oro Coast of Oro Province, the Huon \nCoast of Morobe Province, the Rai Coast of Madang Province, the Sepik River in East Sepik \nProvince, the south coast of New Britain, and the southeast coast of New Ireland.  \n \n5.  The  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  case  in  these  evaluations  involves  continuation  of  present \ncommunity water transport services, primarily by banana boats. The \u201cwithout project\u201d and \u201cwith \nproject\u201d situations differ in terms of demand for passenger and cargo transport and charges for \npassenger and cargo transport services.  \n \n6.  Each service includes initial capital costs for workboats and fast passenger vessels, and \nfor lighters. The costs every 5 years reflect replacements or major rebuilds of engines in the \nboats.  The  principal  capital  costs  of  providing  transport  services  to  the  remote  and \ndisadvantaged communities relate to vessel acquisition. Estimation of these was based on \nprices prevailing in PNG in 2001. In the place of new infrastructure in the vessel evaluations, ", "Appendix 10  49\n \n \ncosts were estimated for lightering1 cargo in ports without existing fixed infrastructure. Banana \nboat lighters were assumed to be dedicated to lightering services and otherwise idle. The capital \ncosts of four such vessels were allocated to the vessel service for each village port requiring \nlightering, and operating costs were estimated for the times in which the boats are providing \nlightering services. This assumption is conservative in that banana boats have alternative uses \nsuch as local transport, and they are likely to provide functions other than lightering. Although \nthe capital costs of these lighters are part of the economic evaluation, the lighters do not form \npart  of  the  community  transport  Project.  Customers  of  the  vessel  services,  villages, \ncommunities, trade store owners, individuals, etc. would provide the lightering arrangement and \nthis would come from the existing fleet of some 10,000 banana boats in PNG. \n \n7.  A trust fund of $11 million will be established to provide subsidies to the vessel services \nthat evolve as a consequence of the Community Water Transport Project. As this fund is a \nnecessary part of the vessel service project\u2014without it and the subsidies it provides there would \nbe no vessel services\u2014it is an economic cost of the project. The trust fund was added as an \ninitial expenditure and as a residual at the end of the project evaluation period. It is assumed \nthat the investments in the fund allow it to retain its initial value in constant-dollar terms. The \nvalue of the fund in 2001 kina is estimated at K55 million including the shadow exchange rate \nfactor. On this basis, the present value of the residual value of the fund over 20 years at a 12% \ndiscount rate is about K6 million. If the seven individual vessel service cases examined in this \nstudy are about one quarter of all vessel services, the allocation of the trust fund to each \nindividual service is about K2.0 million. The value of the trust fund (K2.0 million in economic \nterms) is added as an initial cost and as a residual at the end of the project evaluation period. It \nis assumed that the investments in the fund allow it to retain its initial value in constant terms. \nOperating costs comprise vessel costs of crew, maintenance, and fuel at sea and in port. Direct \noverhead costs of operating the fleet were estimated at 25% of vessel operating costs. \n \n8.  Benefits were considered to have three transport components: \n \n(i)  Enhanced mobility. Villagers are currently constrained from traveling from their \nhomes to district and provincial centers due to the lack and unaffordable cost of \nwater transport. \n \n(ii)  Inward  transport  of  village  supplies.  The  lack  and  unaffordable  cost  of \neffective water transport constrain currently the ability of village residents to bring \ngoods  into  their  communities,  either  through  direct  purchase  or  through \ncommercial routes such as trade stores. \n \n(iii)  Outward  transport  of  village  products.  These  include  export  of  produce, \nseafood, crafts, and products of tree crops such as copra and cocoa from the \ncommunities to the district and provincial markets. The provision of economical \nand regular vessel services will enhance the ability of villages to produce goods \nto sell for cash, which in turn will generate other development benefits and \nincrease incomes at the community level. \n                                                 \n1   Banana boats (open-bull 19\u201323 foot boats with no seating or safety facilities, rated for 6\u20138 persons with a speed of \n20 knots) and dug-out wooden non-motorized canoes are traditionally used for transferring of cargo or passengers \n(lightering) to and from shore as an alternative to fixed marine infrastructure such as a jetty. Consideration was \ngiven to the productivity of the two options with the lightering productivity estimated to be 0.5 tons an hour in good \nsea conditions (calm, sheltered water), and as low as 0.1 tonnes an hour in rough weather before operations \ncease, in the examination of the transfer of cargo between an 18-ton workboat and shore by banana boat lighters \nin comparison with the use of a jetty.  ", "50  Appendix 10 \n \n \n9.  Benefits were measured by estimates of willingness to pay for cargo and passenger \ntransport services from the evaluations for varying voyage lengths. The EIRRs2 of the seven \ncases ranged from 13% to 38% with the economic net present values (NPVs) ranging from \nK0.2 million to K5 million.  \n \n1.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n10.  The  financial  evaluation  incorporated  revenues  instead  of  benefits.  All  costs  in  the \nfinancial model were in financial terms. Each service includes initial capital costs for workboats \nand fast passenger vessels, and for lighters. The costs every 5 years reflect replacements or \nmajor rebuilds of engines in the boats. Operating costs comprise costs of crew, maintenance, \nand fuel at sea and in port. Direct overhead costs of operating the fleet were estimated at 25% \nof vessel operating costs. Operating costs include an allowance for the general overhead costs \nof  the  companies  that  will  likely  operate  the  vessel  services.  Revenue  was  measured  by \nestimates of willingness to pay for cargo and passenger transport services from the evaluations \nfor varying voyage lengths. The FIRRs3 for the individual services range from a negative value \nto 17% and average 7%. The cost of borrowing in kina in PNG is typically 20% in nominal terms \n(10%-15% in real terms) and loan terms are typically 5 years. Because virtually all of the FIRRs \nare lower than the real cost of borrowing, the vessel services will require subsidies.  \n \n2.  Subsidization of Community Water Transport \n11.  The  financial  evaluations  of  the  seven  vessel  services  indicate  that  most  of  the \ncommunity vessel services are unlikely to be financially viable without a subsidy. Additionally, \nthe FIRR calculations of the financial analysis do not address all the conditions that a private \nsector operator faces in the development of private vessel services in PNG. The subsidy for the \nvessel operations was calculated as the amount of additional revenue that is necessary to \nprovide a 15% real, after-tax FIRR on equity capital. Only under these conditions will the \ncommunity transport franchise scheme be able to apply the private-public partnership model \nproposed under the Project. The subsidy was structured over three time periods with level \nannual subsidies within each period: an initial 3 years, a second 3 years at a subsidy level of 2/3 \nthat of the first period, and a final 4 years at a subsidy level of 1/3 that of the first period. Beyond \nthe 10th year, the subsidy is zero. All seven-vessel services are assumed to be bid for an initial 3 \nyears and then re-bid for one subsequent 3-year period and for a final 4-year period. This \napproach captures traffic growth and related improvements in operational efficiency over the \nperiod. The capital charge components of the operators' costs were estimated at 25% of the \nreplacement cost of the vessels required for the services. This is a conservative assumption \nbecause after a few bidding periods, there will be a supply of vessels that already have been \npartially depreciated and operators may accept a lower level of capital charges that reflect these \ndepreciated values. The resulting average subsidy for these seven vessel services is estimated \nin 2001 kina at K280,000 a year per service for the first 3-year period, K100,000 a year for the \nsecond 3-year period, and K50,000 a year for the final 4-year period. The actual subsidies in \naggregate will depend greatly on the nature of the vessels that operators propose, the timing of \nthe introduction of the vessel services, and business conditions in PNG.  \n                                                 \n2  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) equalizes the present values of economic costs and benefits that \naccrue to the national economy. An economic net present value of the Project reflects returns in excess of the \ndiscount rate of 12%. \n \n3  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) equalizes the present values of financial costs and benefits that accrue \nto the national economy. A financial net present value of the Project reflects return in excess of the discount rate of \n12%. ", "Appendix 10  51\n \n \n3.  Distribution of Project Effects \n \n12.  The  project  effects  are  divided  between  the  vessel  operators  (corporate), \ngovernment/economy, and consumer sectors\u2014the vessel users. The main benefit is to the \ngovernment/economy through resource cost savings, net of the cost of the trust fund. Vessel \nusers also receive reductions in their costs of vessel transport.  \n \nC.  Evaluation of Maritime Infrastructure \n13.  Most of the maritime and water-transport infrastructure installations in PNG including \njetties, wharves, and pontoons are in poor condition. A number of them are unusable in their \npresent condition. While in many cases, the water transport services can operate without fixed \ninfrastructure, significant penalties in efficiency and safety apply in such conditions. In some \ncases, however, infrastructure investments are a necessary part of new vessel services. \n \n14.  The  infrastructure  restoration  under  the  Project  involves  tradeoffs  between  cargo \nhandling efficiency with and without the Project, and the cost of lightering, cargo damage with \nlightering, and the costs of the project. In the case of cargo damage due to lightering, a unit \ncargo value of K3,000 per ton was estimated from surveys of inbound village goods, which are \nthe dominant category of products, and K500 per ton for outbound produce. It was assumed \nthat the damage factor for lightered cargo is 2% of its value. \n \n15.  The capital costs of infrastructure works were estimated from site inspections, general \nengineering evaluations of needed improvements, and contractor prices prevailing in the PNG \nmarket. The financial costs were adjusted to economic costs by applying a shadow exchange \nrate factor to the foreign component of costs and by removing taxes. The annual costs of \nmaintenance were estimated from the nature of each facility and periodic maintenance adjusted \nto a level annual cost. The financial costs were adjusted to economic costs by removing taxes.  \n \n16.  Of 63 infrastructure projects, a total of 40 sites passed the screening process at a \nfinancial cost of about K16 million. The calculated EIRRs of the 40 range from 12% to 38%. \nSome of the projects are sensitive to a small variation in capital costs and benefits. A 10% \nincrease in capital costs results in 11 projects with an EIRR of less than 12%, and a 10% \ndecrease in benefits results in 17 projects with an EIRR of less than 12%. The overall average \nsensitivity indicator for benefits is 4.32 and for capital costs minus 3.05. Switching values \nprovide the percentage change in a variable tested in the sensitivity analysis that brings the \nEIRR to 12%, the cut-off rate for small water transport infrastructure to be eligible for funding \nunder the Project. For the individual projects, the switching value for benefits ranges between \n37% and 102% of the base values of benefits, and the switching value for capital costs is \nbetween 97% and 285% of the base values of capital costs. For all projects together, the \nswitching value for benefits is 77% of the base value of benefits and for capital costs it is 133%. \nThe overall infrastructure project generates an EIRR of about 17% and a net present value of \nabout K4.4 million. \n \n17.  The economic and financial evaluation models were used to estimate the distribution of \nproject effects in terms of net present values. The project effects are divided between the vessel \noperator (corporate), government/economy, and consumer sectors (in this case passengers and \ncargo owners). The corporate sector (vessel operators) benefits in a minor way because of \nsavings in ship time due to higher cargo handling productivity with the infrastructure. Vessel \nusers (passengers and cargo owners) benefit from avoidance of lightering costs and cargo ", "52  Appendix 10 \n \n \ndamage. The burden of the costs falls on the government or the economy in general because of \nthe minor revenues from infrastructure operations and the relatively large capital expenditures. \n \nD.  Conclusion: Evaluation of Overall Project \n \n18.  The  overall  project  comprises  the  vessel  services  and  infrastructure  improvements \ndiscussed above. It also includes a major focus on maritime safety such as vessel legislation \nand regulation, marine communication systems (VHF facilities), and enhancement of search \nand rescue.  \n \n19.  The quantifiable benefits of the Project are discussed above. The water community \ntransport franchise scheme benefits comprise resource cost savings to the economy and the \nconsumers' surpluses accruing to induced traffic. The benefits from marine infrastructure include \nimproved cargo handling productivity, and avoided costs and cargo damage associated with \nlightering. \n \n20.  The overall project will generate a number of benefits that have not been quantified in \nthe evaluation. These include:  \n \n(i)  Improvements  in  maritime  safety.  These  would  evolve  from  direct  efforts \naimed at education of vessel operators and users, modifications to legislation \nand regulations, and improvements in marine communications and search and \nrescue. They would also result from the introduction of safer vessels as part of \nthe project. \n \n(ii)  Improvements in social services. These would result from better services at \nthe  local  level  and  increased  mobility  of  villagers  to  regional  and  provincial \ncenters. \n \n(iii)  Reduction of the maritime transport constraint on rural development. The \nexistence of a vessel service would allow further development of cash crops and \nother village products. ", " \nAppendix 11  53\n \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \nA.  Introduction \n1.  This summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) report summarizes the results of \nan  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  of  a  proposal  to  replace  the  provincial  jetty  at \nKandrian, West New Britain Province, Papua New Guinea (PNG). This environmental study was \ncarried out on 7 November 2001 according to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Guidelines \nfor  Environmental  Assessments  and  for  Selected  Infrastructure  Projects  (Ports  &  Harbors) \n(ADB, 1993, 1998). \n2.  This IEE study for Kandrian forms part of a larger investigation of a subset of sites drawn \nfrom 170 infrastructure developments proposed at locations spread throughout the riverine and \nmaritime provinces of PNG. Twenty-one of the sites were examined by IEEs, and a further 14 \nexamined more informally. These were used to develop generalized guidelines that could be \napplied at sites not specifically covered by the IEEs. \nB.  Description of the Project \n3.  It is proposed that the jetty at Kandrian be reconstructed as a development under \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  3615-PNG:  Community  Water  Transport  Project.1  This  project \npreparation TA was carried out through the PNG Department of Works and Transport (DOWT) \nand  sought  to  examine  mechanisms  for  improving  water  transport  for  coastal  and  river \ncommunities  throughout  the  country.  The  focus  of  the  study  was  on  maritime  safety  and \nimproving shipping services and infrastructure. \n4.  The project site is located in a protected harbor, northwest of Cape Anukur on the south \ncoast of West New Britain, PNG. The location of the existing jetty is at 06 12.682\u2019 South and \n149 32.846\u2019 East and faces out to the harbor at a bearing of 92. \n5.  The project concerns the rehabilitation of part of the existing jetty structure at Kandrian, \nand the construction of a new jetty head. The existing jetty consists of a short filled causeway \nleading out to a concrete platform constructed on gabions. The existing causeway seawalls are \nin poor condition despite the sheltered wave environment, and it is expected that the jetty will \ndeteriorate further and collapse within the next 10 years. A copra storage shed of 15 x 10 \nmeters (m) currently exists adjacent to the jetty, is in reasonable condition and could be retained \nin any upgrade of the jetty. \n6.  The works proposed in this project are to (i) demolish the existing jetty head, (ii) repair \nthe existing causeway seawalls and pavement as required, (iii) construct a new angled jetty with \nan approach structure of sufficient length to bring the berthing face to a depth of 3.5 m at lowest \nastronomical tides, and (iv) create a jetty head with a 15 m long berthing face and 5 m width. \nThe jetty would be constructed from concrete encased steel piles supporting reinforced concrete \nheadstocks and a reinforced concrete deck using precast concrete wherever possible. Bollards \nand rubber fenders would be supplied along the berthing face of the jetty to protect the structure \nand vessels using it. It is also proposed under this project that requirements be investigated \nduring the design phase for navigation aids. It is also proposed that dredging or new seawalls \nare required for the project. Water, electricity and sewerage for the jetty are not included in the \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for Community Water Transport. Manila.  ", "54  Appendix 11 \n \ndesign. The facility at Kandrian is currently used monthly by Lutheran Shipping for the import of \nstore goods for the community and the export of locally produced copra. Any upgraded facility \nshould be designed to accommodate the berthing of vessels up to approximately 45 m in length \non an infrequent basis, with the most common berthing vessels being those of less than 20 m in \nlength. \nC.  Description of the Environment \n7.  The Kandrian township is located in a well-protected deepwater natural harbor that has a \nfjord-like structure. The entrance to the harbor is protected by three large, flat-topped volcanic \nislands, including Ganglo and Bugi islands, which shelter the entrance from the southeast winds \nand seas. Coastal sediment movements appear to be negligible and are unlikely to cause \nproblems at future facilities located at the site. The jetty itself is located on a small peninsula \nthat juts in a southerly direction within the harbor, dividing it further into inner and outer harbor \nsections. \n8.  The land area on and surrounding the Kandrian harbor and peninsula has been modified \nby conversion to urban uses including housing and gardening, but the area of influence is small \nand natural wet tropical forest may be found within a kilometer of the village. The land around \nthe existing jetty is dominated by maintained grass areas and, offices, storage facilities and \nhouses. There are domestic trees present and some coastal vegetation has been retained. \n9.  The subtidal area around the existing jetty comprises an unconsolidated volcanic rock \nslope that steeply drops off to deep water. The slope supports a relatively low diversity, but \nrelatively high abundance of fishes, small corals, sponges and other invertebrates. The reef \narea is typically present only as a narrow fringe that follows the line of the harbor shore, except \non  the  tip of  the  Peninsula  where  a  backreef  and  mangrove  area  has  formed.  The  most \ncommon corals include Porites, Faviids, Montipora, and Fungiid species. The algae Padina and \nDictyota and several species of sponges are common. The backreef area consists of rock and \nrubble and is dominated by mudskippers, ophiuroids, the seagrass Thalassia, and a range of \nsmall invertebrates. The mangrove area on the southern tip of the peninsula consists almost \nexclusively of a small stand of Sonneratia alba. \n10.  The harbor and particularly the area around the existing jetty are in excellent ecological \ncondition, with clear deep waters and corals showing no signs of stress. There is no evidence of \nsewage overload or the presence of liquid pollution that has accumulated beyond the capacity \nof the environment to attenuate it. There is, however, a large problem of accumulating solid \nwastes in the area, particularly around the jetty and the mangrove area nearby, despite the light \nshipping traffic. Plastics, steel banding, bits of machinery, masonry, and household garbage \nhave  been  dumped  into  the  shallow  water  areas  around  the  jetty  and  other  parts  of  the \npeninsula. The mangrove area at the tip of the peninsula has a large amount of plastic wrapped \naround tree bases, pneumatophores (aerial roots), and rocks that are physically disturbing the \ncommunities there. \n11.  The most important resources occurring around the Kandrian area are timber, land for \nsubsistence  uses,  fishing  and  a  potential  for  tourism.  Most  activities  are  currently  being \nundertaken on a subsistence or cash sale basis, though there is also a logging company \noperating some distance to the south of the township. The site of the Kandrian jetty is not an \nimportant source of any of the locally utilized resources. ", "Appendix 11  55\n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n12.  Impacts  associated  with  the  construction  phase  of  this  project  are  expected  to  be \ninsignificant and short-term. There is likely to be an increase in water turbidity in the vicinity of \nthe jetty during demolition of the existing jetty, repair of the existing approach causeway, and \nconstruction of a new jetty head that will require the driving of new piles. The organisms living \nwith the footprint of the works are expected to be lost, but are also expected to recolonize \nrapidly. There may also be increased turbidity in the water associated with the stockpiling of \nmaterials and the mixing of concrete on the land adjacent to the jetty. These impacts could be \nminimized by working only during the dry season so that carriage by rainwater is minimized. In \ngeneral, however, the corals, sponges and other organisms living around the jetty are to some \nextent tolerant of sedimentation and turbidity and are expected to be able to tolerate the levels \nof turbidity expected with this project. The back reef and mangrove areas on the tip of the \npeninsula are also unlikely to suffer negative impacts from the works proposed. \n13.  The  long-term  and  permanent  impacts  of  this  project  are  mostly  limited  to  minor \nredistribution of building materials to the site and increased human traffic and use of the new \nfacilities. Physical impacts of the new jetty will be minimal. The causeway approach structure to \nbe retained has not in the past resulted in any problems with erosion or accretion. The new jetty \nhead  will  be  a  piled  structure  and  therefore  largely  transparent  to  water  movements,  an \nimprovement of the conditions imposed by the existing structure. \n14.  Impacts of operation may include increased pollution from boats (sewage, oils, fuel, \nbilge, etc.) and an expected increase in solid garbage pollution by people and boats using the \narea. There is an existing issue of inappropriate garbage disposal at the site, which is expected \nto worsen if appropriate measures are not taken. \n15.  The project is located in a previously disturbed area and will involve little or no long-term \nnew damage to existing ecosystems during the demolition or construction phases. Impacts of \noperation  can  be  reduced  through  observing  good  practices  during  use  of  the  facilities. \nMeasures  for  mitigating  the  expected  temporary  and  permanent  impacts  of  this  project  at \nKandrian are to: \n(i)  limit the area of disturbance, storage of machinery and stockpiling of materials to \nthe smallest area possible, preferably well back from the shoreline; \n(ii)  carry out the construction works during the drier season to limit mobilization of \nsediments by runoff from the land during rain;  \n(iii)  realign the seafloor as close as possible to original conditions after construction \n(this would include recreating the rocky substratum if necessary); \n(iv)  dispose of materials from demolition of the old jetty in an appropriate location on \nland (this could include stockpiling for other uses); and \n(v)  clean up the existing garbage in the vicinity of the jetty, including in subtidal, reef, \nmangrove and backreef areas. \n16.  Additional measures that should be considered by the local level government (LLG) and \nwhich have a broader context than this project are to: \n(i)  establish a small-scale garbage service to collect and dispose of solid wastes \nfrom boats using the facility if solid wastes begin to build up in the area. This task \ncould be carried out by the LLG; and \n(ii)  establish  good  practices  for  users  of  the  new  facilities  to  ensure  that  liquid \nwastes  and  pollution  from  vessels  (sewage,  oil,  bilge,  etc.)  are  kept  to  a ", "56  Appendix 11 \n \nminimum. This task could be carried out by the LLG. Vessels using the facility \nshould discharge liquid wastes out of port, at least 0.5 kilometer away from the \nmouth of Kandrian harbor. \nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n17.  There is no institutional or monitoring requirement for this project. The site is located in \nan  area  already  disturbed  by  previous  developments  of  this  type.  Although  sensitive \necosystems are nearby, they are unlikely to be significantly affected by the scale of works \nproposed.  Impacts  of  demolition  and  construction  are  expected  to  be  insignificant  and \nmonitoring of construction effects unnecessary. \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n18.  It is recommended that this SIEE/IEE be considered sufficient environmental screening \nfor the project and that a follow-up environmental impact assessment is not required. The \nproposed developments are not likely to significantly extend any existing damage outside of \npreviously impacted areas and are not expected to intensify effects within it providing that the \nmitigation measures (para. 15) given in this SIEE/IEE are followed. \n19.  The ecosystems at the site of the existing jetty at Kandrian have suffered damage from \nan accumulation of solid wastes such as plastics, steel banding, and other non-biodegradable \nitems. Effects were noted in the surrounding coral reef, mangrove, and backreef areas. There is \na need for the LLG to address these existing environmental issues in the vicinity of the Kandrian \njetty using mitigation measures (para. 16), above. This work is not considered part of the project \nbecause it concerns existing conditions that are of a broader significance in the area and should \nbe addressed regardless of whether the project proceeds. \nG.  Conclusions \n20.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not  needed  for  this  project.  No  further \nenvironmental investigations are required in connection with the demolition of the existing jetty \nhead, repair of the causeway approach or the construction of a new jetty head at Kandrian. The \nmitigation measures and recommendations provided in this SIEE/IEE are expected to provide \nsufficient guidance to keep impacts to an acceptable minimum for the project.
