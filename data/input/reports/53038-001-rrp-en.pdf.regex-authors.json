THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nMongolia for the Climate-Resilient and Sustainable Livestock Development Project. The report \nalso describes the proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Capacity Building for Food Safety and Traceability, and if \nthe Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the administration of the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed project will support the improvement of livestock production systems in 20 \nsoums (districts) of four aimags (provinces) in Central Mongolia.1 The project will promote pasture \nrehabilitation and carbon sequestration while increasing the incomes of herder households \nthrough  the  formation  and  institutionalization  of  pasture  user  groups  (PUGs)  and  the \nimplementation of rangeland user agreements (RUAs).2 This will promote a reduction in livestock \nnumbers and increase in the quality of livestock products. The project will also build the capacity \nof the public institutions of the Government of Mongolia to better assist the sector. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Mongolia has witnessed a gradual decline in poverty levels since the early 1990s, when \nan estimated 40.0% of the total population was found to be poor.3 While the incidence of poverty \nfell significantly from 38.8% in 2010 to 21.6% in 2014, recent estimates indicate that it has climbed \nback to 29.6%.4 Moreover, according to the available statistics for 2018, the poverty rate was \nhigher in rural areas (30.8%) than in urban areas (27.2%).5 In addition, only 35.3% of households \nwere food secure in 2016, while half the population experienced moderate to severe food \ninsecurity. The high incidence of poverty and food insecurity is particularly alarming in rural areas, \nwhere a majority of the poor depend on agriculture and extensive livestock production to sustain \ntheir livelihoods. \n \n4.  The agriculture sector remains a key pillar of the economy. In 2019, agriculture contributed \n10.8%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic  product,  with  the  sector  growing  at  a  similar  rate \n(compounded annually) from 2007 to 2019. Livestock accounts for 84.2% of agricultural outputs \nand about 25% of Mongolia\u2019s total employment. The primary products of the livestock subsector \nare currently meat and milk, amounting to 61.0% of livestock output and 7.0% of gross domestic \nproduct. In contrast, the mining sector provides 5.1% of total employment in the country. As such, \nthe agriculture sector translates far more directly into improved lives for vulnerable Mongolians \nthan mining; and has the potential to reduce rural poverty, boost incomes, and diversify economic \ngrowth through food production and exports of high-quality meat and wool products. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) supports Mongolia\u2019s economic diversification with several projects \nencouraging labor-intensive growth through utilizing and preserving Mongolia\u2019s natural capital \n \n1  The project will implement activities in 4 aimags and 20 soums, which are specified in the project administration \nmanual. \n2  The key organizational unit is the traditional Neg Nutag Alliance, which is equivalent to a PUG and makes the RUA \nwith the soum governments. The Neg Nutag Alliance comprises the herders in the same ecological environment, \nwhere herders together possess the same pasture or water resources, and salt marshes. \n3  World Bank. 1996.

Despite the sizable importance of agriculture (the livestock subsector in particular), several \nconstraints and risks threaten the sector\u2019s sustainability and competitiveness. The lack of a \nregulatory framework, enforcement capacity, and coordinated policies on the part of central and \nlocal administrations to control livestock numbers within the carrying capacity of grasslands has \ncreated an alarming situation where livestock numbers (in sheep equivalents7) have increased by \n71%, from 69.5 million in 2009 to 119.0 million in 2019;8 and 70.0% of Mongolia\u2019s pastureland is \nnow degraded. These negative developments are exacerbated by extreme climatic events such \nas droughts and dzuds (episodes of extreme winter weather), which have resulted in significant \nlivestock deaths and increased the risk of rural\u2013urban migration. The government has adopted \npolicy actions to adjust the livestock herd and flock structure and grassland use rights to reduce \npasture deterioration.9 These have been included in recently developed projects and are expected \nto play a major role in the current project. \n \n6.  Climate-vulnerable livestock production systems. The livestock subsector is dominated \nby an extensive production system that depends on access to pasturelands. A lack of appropriate \nwater points, animal shelters, and feeding throughout the winter leads to the concentrated use of \nsurrounding pasture and undermines pasture management during winter. This remains a key \nconcern for herders given the increased frequency of climate change-induced severe weather \nevents. The absence of coordinated grazing management among herders has impaired the \ndevelopment of more climate-resilient and profitable livestock production and marketing systems. \nRUAs are the key legal instrument for pastureland management by PUG. Only 12%\u201339% of the \npasture in each project aimag is used by herder groups, few of which have formalized this use \nthrough RUAs. The fact that the current land law allows open access to summer and autumn \npastures  is  regarded  as  the  fundamental  cause  of  pasture  degradation.  Although  local \ngovernments have the authority to manage winter and spring pasture through agreements with \nherders in the soum, few soum governors exercise this authority. Major hindrances include the \ngovernors\u2019 limited knowledge of how to exercise their authority, the difficulty of coordinating with \nthe  widely  scattered  herders,  and  the  herders\u2019  limited  awareness  of  sustainable  pasture \nmanagement. \n \n7.  Poorly developed meat value chain. Mongolia also faces challenges throughout the meat \nvalue chain, limiting access to export markets that are vital for lifting incomes and overall sector \ngrowth. First, transboundary animal diseases are prevalent, and the veterinary system has been \nunable  to manage  outbreaks  effectively.  These  outbreaks  have  periodically  led  Mongolia\u2019s \nneighbors to ban Mongolian meat exports.10 Second, some meat, especially beef, is unable to \ncompete in export markets on quality because of livestock producers\u2019 limited nutrition and \n \n6  ADB. 2015.

Washington, DC (19 May). \n ", "3 \nbreeding  practices.11  Third,  food  hygiene  practices  and  sanitary  standards  fall  short  of \ninternational standards; only 10% of the national meat supply in 2017 was met by livestock \nslaughtered and processed at abattoirs, with the remainder processed informally.12 Mongolia\u2019s \nveterinary, breeding, and agriculture extension services and livestock production systems require \nsignificant  investment  and  improvement  to  meet  international  standards.  Further,  while \nMongolia\u2019s new Animal Health Law came into effect in June 2018, secondary legislation is still \nunderway, and the national veterinary structure needs to be enhanced for effective surveillance \nand animal disease control. Although the establishment of the General Authority of Veterinary \nServices is an important step in instituting a national veterinary service, substantial assistance is \nneeded to enable it to function effectively. As a result of these constraints, Mongolia exported only \n70,400 tons of meat in 2018, despite producing 448,000 tons.13 Since domestic production of \nmeat far exceeds consumption, simply increasing productivity along the value chain without \naccessing new markets could lower prices and potentially hurt herder incomes. The current \ndemand\u2013supply configuration, combined with Mongolia\u2019s proximity to major markets in Northeast \nand Central Asia, and reputation for pastoralist traditions suggests that there is potential to boost \nexports and increase income generation significantly if the key binding constraints are addressed \nin a sustainable manner. \n \n8.  Inadequate  technical  and  institutional  management  capacity.  Given  the \npredominantly  small  size  of  individual  herders\u2019  livestock  herds,  there  is  limited  scope  for \nproductivity-  and  quality-enhancing  interventions  without  government  regulation  for  better \ncoordination on pasture use. However, the limited capacity and policies of the Ministry of Food, \nAgriculture and Light Industry (MOFALI) and local governments to enforce sustainable pasture \nmanagement and provide extension services severely impact their capacity to deliver the required \nguidance. The lack of regulations and guidelines for good livestock husbandry practice further \nlimit the options that can be offered to herders. This is complicated further by the limited capacity \nof public and private veterinary services to ensure livestock health and meat safety inspections \nwith traceability. In the absence of an information system on livestock and pasture conditions \nbased on a geographic information system, governments lack the necessary information to design \nevidence-based policy reforms for pasture rehabilitation and improvement of livestock quality. \n \n9.  Government policy. The action plan for the Mongolian Agenda for Sustainable Livestock \nfocuses  on  the  principles  of  (i)  implementing  sustainable  pastureland  management  and \nadaptation to climate change; (ii) improving the economic efficiency of the livestock sector; (iii) \nenhancing livestock health, food security, and safety; (iv) improving social inclusiveness in rural \nareas: and (v) strengthening partnership and participation.14 Despite extensive policy, institutional, \nlegal, and regulatory frameworks, the capacity of the agencies concerned is limited by the lack of \navailable staff and operational funds, together with frequent changes to the available staff at the \ncentral and local levels. Substantial assistance is required to help the institutions strengthen their \ncapacity to fulfill their mandate. \n \n10.  Coronavirus disease pandemic.

Herders have suffered particularly from \nreduced prices for cashmere because of restrictions on international trade and tourism. Although \nCOVID-19 has been largely contained in both rural and urban areas, it remains a risk. \n \n11.  Strategic fit. The project aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 by tackling climate change, \nbuilding climate and disaster resilience, enhancing environmental sustainability, and promoting \nrural  development  and  food  security.15  Fostering  economic  growth  through  strengthening \nvertically integrated value chains and enhancing environmental sustainability, particularly through \nimproved natural resource management, are key strategic priorities for ADB in its country \npartnership  strategy  for  Mongolia,  2017\u20132020.16  The  draft  country  partnership  strategy  for \nMongolia, 2021\u20132024 maintains a focus on improved natural resources management. The project \nsupports improving livestock production through the establishment of PUGs and RUAs with the \nobjective  of  reducing  livestock  numbers,  increasing  output  quality,  and  reducing  pasture \ndegradation as a result. \n \n12.  Lessons. The project design incorporates lessons from previous and ongoing projects \nfinanced by ADB and others in Mongolia, as well as from project preparation. These include the \nneed to (i) support government executing and implementing agencies to develop their project \nimplementation capacity; (ii) focus on the formation and strengthening of herder groups, including \nensuring that they understand the need for, and benefits from, pasture protection and reduced \nlivestock  numbers;  and  (iii)  improve  livestock  production  support  facilities  for  feed  supply, \nveterinary services, livestock breeding, and output processing. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n13.  The project is aligned with the following impact: competitiveness and sustainability of \nMongolia\u2019s livestock sector improved (Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030).17 The \nproject will have the following outcome: efficiency and sustainability of climate-resilient livestock \nproduction in the project areas increased.18 \n \n14.  Output 1: Climate resilience of livestock, pasture, and water management improved. \nThis output will build the climate resilience of herders against the increased frequency of severe \nweather events. Grassland management is the main driver of soil carbon sequestration and will \nresult in reduced greenhouse gas emissions for the overall project.19 Compliance with pasture\u2019s \nlivestock carrying capacity limits will be achieved through (i) improving grazing management and \nreducing stocking rates through the establishment of 466 PUGs and 466 RUAs covering 11,660 \nherders; (ii) improving 14,000 livestock shelters for herders; (iii) improving livestock drinking water \naccess by constructing or rehabilitating 382 wells and developing 466 water use agreements; (iv) \nimproving livestock feeding through the establishment of 14,000 hayfields and hay storage for \n466 herder groups; and (v) establishing 20 soum pasture reserve areas. \n \n15.  Output 2: Livestock value chains strengthened. This output will improve the quality and \nhealth standard of livestock herds and products though better integration and coordination of the \nrespective livestock value chain participants. Project-supported herders can obtain higher outputs \n \n15 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n16 ADB. 2017.

This will also reduce stress \nand impact on pasturelands and allow Mongolia to pivot toward a more sustainable livestock \ndevelopment model. This can be achieved through strengthened livestock value chains by \nimproving (i) livestock marketing by establishing linkages between 2,915 herder households and \nprocessors to meet processing and market standards for health and carcass quality, and provide \nfeedback  to  herders;  (ii)  livestock  feeding  for  466  herder  groups  through  support  for  hay \nproduction and fodder storage; (iii) animal health for 11,660 herders through support for 54 private \nveterinary units; (iv) animal breeding through the establishment of 20 nucleus flocks for sheep \nand goats; (v) livestock turnoff through lamb fattening in 20 small-scale lamb fattening farms; and \n(vi)  cashmere  marketing  through  establishing  20  soum-level  cashmere-sorting  facilities. \nSupported livestock value chain investments will be demand-driven. Herders are eligible to submit \nbusiness proposals outlining investment costs, operation and maintenance (O&M), technical \nsupport, and income beyond the project implementation period. \n \n16.  Output 3: Livestock sector regulatory framework and capacity enhanced. This output \nwill strengthen the livestock regulatory framework and institutional capacity by (i) developing \nimplementing regulations, awareness raising, and promotion activities for improved pasture \nmanagement; (ii) establishing a geographic information system-based livestock management \ninformation  system  (LMIS)  and  Rangeland  and  Fodder  Division  within  the  MOFALI;  (iii) \ndeveloping systems for carcass traceability and feedback to meet international market standards; \n(iv)  expanding the Mongolian  animal  health  information  system  (MAHIS)  in  20  soums;  (v) \nimproving extension and training capacity within the MOFALI\u2019s Research and Development \nCenter; and (vi) developing three inter-aimag pasture reserve areas. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n17.  The  project\u2019s  organization  of  pasture  management  will  showcase  value  added \ninterventions that preserve the natural capital of rangelands. The following lessons from projects \ntargeted at supporting collaborative pasture management have informed the project design:20 (i) \nadopt a demand-driven approach to providing project investments, (ii) link reductions in livestock \nnumbers to reduced pasture degradation through RUAs, and (iii) develop the proposed LMIS to \nimprove the government\u2019s capacity for livestock management and policy development. The \nproject is compatible with another proposed ADB project that will provide financing for agri-\nprocessing enterprises to link PUGs with high-value markets.21 During implementation, the project \nteam  will  liaise  with  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  Program,  World \nOrganisation for Animal Health, and other development partners to disseminate best practices, \nprepare technical guidelines, and encourage knowledge-sharing by participating in regional \nevents. The project design ensures that these collaborations are promoted, and value added is \nmaximized. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n18.

The government will finance counterpart contributions of 6.0% through exemptions from \nvalue added tax. \n \n \n22 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)  23.00  66.66 \nOrdinary capital resources (concessional loan)  7.00  20.29 \nGovernment of Mongolia  2.08  6.03 \nBeneficiaries  2.42  7.02 \nTotal  34.50  100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n22.  Food security investments are estimated to cost $34.50 million, comprising $30.00 million \nin regular and concessional loans. The project invests in pasture rehabilitation, strengthening \nherder resilience to extreme weather events, and building livestock value chain linkage. This is \nexpected to stimulate agribusiness capacity building in the agriculture, natural resources, and \nrural development sector. \n \n23.  Climate change mitigation is estimated to cost $16.80 million, and adaptation is estimated \nto cost $5.21 million. ADB will finance 100% of mitigation and 100% of adaptation costs.23 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  Implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the \nPAM (footnote 22). \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2021\u2013June 2027 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2027 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 December 2027 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  A multisector project steering committee, chaired by the MOFALI and with \nrepresentatives from other central agencies and participating aimags and \nprofessional associations, will provide guidance to the project and the TA. \nThe steering committee will include members from the MOF; Livestock \nPolicy Implementation Coordination Department; Monitoring, Evaluation, \nand Internal Audit Department; Food Production Development Policy \nImplementation  Coordination  Department;  and  General  Authority  for \nVeterinary Services. \n(ii)  Executing agency  MOFALI \n(iii) Key implementing  Livestock Policy Implementation Coordination Department of the MOFALI \nagency \n(iv) Implementation units  A  project  management  unit  will  be  established  in  the  MOFALI  to \ncoordinate and oversee project implementation. \nStaff:  The  project  management  unit  will  be  staffed  by  11  individual \nconsultants hired under the project loans. \nFour project implementation units will be established at aimag agriculture \ndepartments to implement project- and TA-related activities in target project \naimags and soums. \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding  21 contracts  $13.905 million \n(nationally advertised)  \nRequest for quotations   Five contracts  $0.258 million \nCommunity participation in  Multiple contracts  $4.913 million \nProcurement \n \n23 Details are in the Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nAspects  Arrangements \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based  One contract  $2.603 million \nselection \nConsultant\u2019s qualification  Three contracts  $0.540 million \nselection \nDirect contracting  One contract  $0.027 million \nAdvance contracting  Four consulting services contracts with a value of $0.418 million will be \nawarded through advance contracting. \nDisbursement   Disbursement of the loan proceeds will follow ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed \narrangements agreed between the Government of Mongolia and ADB. \nFront-loading of the concessional loan will be applied for financing eligible \ngoods, works, services, and recurrent cost expenditures. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; MOF = Ministry of Finance; MOFALI = Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry; \nTA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n25.  The attached TA is an integral part of the project. It will strengthen Mongolia\u2019s food safety \nand traceability system by building the MOFALI\u2019s capacity at central and local levels to implement \nthe MAHIS and LMIS. The TA will support output 3 of the project to enhance livestock sector \nregulatory framework and capacity. The TA will include three activities: (i) strengthening the \ncapacity of the General Authority for Veterinary Services to trace livestock and livestock products \nthrough the establishment of the MAHIS in the project area; (ii) establishing a pilot LMIS in the \nproject area, and organizing workshops at the national and aimag levels to inform systems \ndevelopment and roll out use of the LMIS; and (iii) helping the MOFALI establish a system of \ncarcass quality, traceability, and feedback to suppliers, including animal identification systems \nand animal health compliance. The MOFALI will be the executing agency and its Livestock Policy \nImplementation Coordination Department will be the implementing agency. The PMU established \nfor the overall project will be responsible for coordination and overseeing the implementation. \n \n26.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.00 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions.24 \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n27.  The project design is technically sound and compatible with local conditions. Technical \nsolutions for improving livestock production consist of adopting practices and processes that have \nbeen successful in improving grazing management and reducing livestock numbers. Previous \nwork in the areas of livestock identification and carcass traceback and feedback systems has \nbeen incorporated. Capacity building of participating agencies comprises technically appropriate \npractices and technology packages together with training and workshops, as well as consultant \nsupport to ensure they make optimal use of the investments. Measures to address climate change \ninclude reducing pasture degradation to increase carbon sequestration, particularly through \nfocusing  on  decreasing  livestock  numbers  while  increasing  output  quality  and  reducing \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions.  Climate  resilience  measures  include  improving  livestock  water \nsupply, feed, and shelter so that they can better withstand the impact of dzuds and improving \noverall ground cover and soil organic matter content over time. The project supports a demand-\n \n24 Details are in the Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \ndriven approach with investments based on approved business plans at the production level, to \nraise downstream livestock and cashmere marketing and processing to a level acceptable to the \ndomestic and international markets. Environmental sustainability will be enhanced by developing \naccess to sustainable water sources, protecting land and surface waters from erosion and \ncontamination,  and  protecting  the  biotic  environment,  including  areas  of  conservation \nsignificance, from significant impacts from the project investments. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n28.  The economic analysis indicated that the overall project is economically viable, with an \neconomic internal rate of return of 14.8% and a total project net economic benefit of MNT111.1 \nbillion. Quantifiable economic benefits result from increased meat output because of increased \noutputs from improved production practices and livestock culling to reduce herd sizes, together \nwith increased carcass weights. The analysis also confirmed the economic viability of the four \naimag subprojects. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the project is robust to the negative \nscenarios  examined, such  as  increased  investment  costs, reduced  benefits reduction,  and \nincreased O&M costs.25 The financial analysis included (i) a fiscal sustainability analysis to assess \nthe capacity of the final borrower, the Government of Mongolia, to provide sufficient funds for all \nincremental recurrent costs incurred by the project;26 and (ii) a financial statement analysis of the \nfour project aimags. It is concluded that the fiscal impacts are well within the government\u2019s \nprojected revenue capacities. Implementing agencies depend on central government funding. \nThis poses a moderate risk to the financial sustainability of the project.27 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n29.   The sustainability of the project outcomes and outputs will be maintained over the project\u2019s \neconomic life through a combination of public institutional support and private investment. This \nwill be achieved by ensuring that project investments support the implementation of business \nplans developed through a demand-driven process as being technically and financially feasible. \nThe  approved  business  plans  that  attract  project  investments  will  incorporate  agreements \nbetween the soum government and herder groups on pasture management. Proper O&M and \nreplacement of equipment will also be stipulated in approved business plans. As part of the \ncapacity building, the requirement to provide training was included in the consultant contracts, \nand manuals on O&M for the facilities in particular were developed. \n \n30.  Mitigation measures relating to the project\u2019s institutional, environmental, social, economic, \nand financial risks have been incorporated into project implementation to minimize the likely \nmedium- to long-term effects on natural resources, pollution, biodiversity, and financial and \neconomic factors. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n31.  A financial management capacity assessment was conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nFinancial Management Technical Guidance Note: Financial Management Assessment (2015). \nThe  financial  management  capacity  of  the  MOFALI,  the  Livestock  Policy  Implementation \nCoordination Department, and the four subproject aimags was assessed and the pre-mitigation \nfinancial management risk is moderate. The MOFALI has experience implementing foreign-\n \n25 Details are in the Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 While the aimag and soum governments will be responsible for financing and implementing O&M of project \ninvestments, they are expected to have to rely on financing from the central government. \n27 Details are in the Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nfunded projects, including ADB projects. Although it has highly qualified financial and accounting \nstaff, they are not involved in project management and cannot be assigned to the PMU. Therefore, \na  long-term  financial consultant  will  be  recruited  on  an  individual  basis for the  PMU.  The \nmonitoring and internal auditing system of the executing agency and aimag governments is weak \nbecause of a staff shortage to audit and monitor project progress during each fiscal year. This \nweakness will be mitigated by the MOFALI collaborating with project aimag governments to \nimprove continuous, on-site, and on-time monitoring and internal auditing of the project. \n \n32.  A project procurement risk assessment (PPRA) was conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidance Notes on Procurement Risk Framework (2018) and Strategic Procurement Planning \n(2018). The project procurement risk was rated medium. The PPRA confirmed that MOFALI has \nsufficient  experience  in  implementing  ADB-funded  projects.  However,  MOFALI  lacks  the \npersonnel needed to fully implement the project. Therefore, a procurement specialist and a \ncontract management specialist will be recruited to ensure that (i) the project procurements are \ncarried out in compliance with the ADB Procurement Policy and Regulations; and (ii) all parties \nmeet their contractual obligations after contract award and during contract implementation. The \nnational e-procurement system is recommended to be used on a pilot basis for contracts following \nopen competitive bidding (OCB) (with national advertisement) and request for quotations (RFQ). \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOFALI. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 22). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  Poverty  and  social.  The  project  is categorized  as  general  intervention  for  poverty \nreduction. The project will support poverty reduction and development by improving rangeland \nconditions and ensuring better quality livestock products to meet international standards, leading \nto increased production and income for herders. The herders will be organized in PUGs and will \nreceive project support based on their needs. The total number of beneficiaries in the 20 soums \nis estimated at 38,587 persons in 11,661 herder households, including 7,709 poor and vulnerable \npersons in 2,332 households. The poverty and social analysis was undertaken based on available \ndata, surveys, and consultations. Because of the COVID-19 outbreak, meetings were held in \nsmaller groups, and household survey interviews were done remotely. \n \n35.  A social development action plan has been prepared based on the poverty and social \nanalysis. The social development action plan comprises measurable actions and indicators under \neach output to ensure benefits for herders, including the poor. Consultations were undertaken \nwith herders and stakeholders during the project preparation, and a consultation and participation \nplan for the project implementation stage has been included in the PAM (footnote 22). \n \n36.  Gender action plan. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming, following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects (2012). Women are \ninvolved in the livestock value chain in all project soums. Women are already active members of \nexisting PUGs and cooperatives but are not as actively engaged in decision-making as are men. \nWomen are also under-represented in management positions in the veterinary sector. \n \n37.  A gender action plan has been prepared based on the gender analysis to ensure that the \nproject contributes to gender equity empowerment. The gender action plan includes the following \nkey measures and targets for women: (i) there is a gender-targeted information campaign; (ii) \n40% of PUG members are women and 30% of PUGs have female leaders; (iii) 40% of jobs are \n ", "11 \nfilled by women during construction and operation; (iv) 30%\u201350% of participants in consultations, \nworkshops, and awareness raising and training activities are women; (v) specific training is \nprovided to women beneficiaries on leadership, income generation activities, and marketing \ntechniques; and (vi) 30% of private veterinary units and state veterinary units are led by women. \nKey gender targets have also been included in the design and monitoring framework. \n \n38.  Capacity for implementation and monitoring social and gender measures. The \nMOFALI has experience implementing ADB projects. To implement social and gender measures \nproperly, the PMU will include a social and gender specialist, and the MOFALI and each \nparticipating aimag will appoint a social and gender focal point from within their own staff for the \nimplementation, monitoring, and reporting of social and gender measures. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n39.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.28 \n \n40.  Environment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination,  including  an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) has been prepared and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The \nproject design adopts a demand-driven approach wherein the maximum extent of project support \nper soum is fixed. The initial environmental examination has assumed a maximum design impact \nper soum and is based on domestic feasibility studies and environmental assessments, site visits, \nand stakeholder consultations. The MOFALI, through the PMU, will be responsible for  the \nimplementation of and compliance with the EMP. A qualified environment safeguard specialist will \nform part of the PMU, and a training program has been included in the EMP. The project will \ncontribute to environmental benefits through pasture rehabilitation with considerable carbon \nsequestration.  Risks  include  inappropriate  siting  of  the  project  facilities,  unsustainable \ngroundwater  extraction,  inadequate  waste  management,  and  the  complexity  of  managing \nsafeguards across many locations. Measures to address these risks include site selection criteria \nto exclude sites of ecological or heritage value, the requirement for detailed monitoring of water \nbalance assessments during implementation, and appropriate waste management procedures. \n \n41.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project will adopt a community demand-\ndriven approach, and civil works will be based on proposals submitted by PUGs during project \nimplementation. All civil works are expected to be located on state-owned land or existing rights-\nof-way without the acquisition of private or community-owned lands. However, the PUGs will \ndecide specific civil works locations during implementation, and there may be some unavoidable \nminor involuntary resettlement impacts, such as temporary land use and damage to structures \nduring construction. A resettlement framework has been prepared since the project has adopted \na  demand-driven  approach  and  the  civil  works  footprint  will  not  be  known  until  project \nimplementation. The resettlement framework describes key principles for civil work site selection, \nscreening processes, situations where a due diligence report or resettlement plan may be \nrequired, and the allocation of counterpart funds and implementation in case of resettlement \nimpacts. The project\u2019s executing and implementing agencies have experience with ADB projects, \nbut no specific experience with ADB social safeguards. The project design includes measures for \ncapacity building of the project executing and implementing agencies and inputs of support from \na social consultant for implementation of the resettlement framework. \n \n \n28 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "12 \n42.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project is not expected to impact distinct and \nvulnerable communities of indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities, triggering ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement requirements on indigenous peoples. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n43.
