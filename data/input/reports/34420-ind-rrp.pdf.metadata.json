The  Project  has  experienced  substantial  cost  overrun  in \ncivil works, mainly because of (i) price underestimation of noncore \nsubprojects  at  the  period  of  processing  of  the  original  loan,  and \n(ii) price  escalation  of  construction  labor  and  materials  during \nconstruction.  Local  currency  appreciation  during  construction \nfurther  increased  the  financing  gap.  The  total  additional  cost \nrequired under the public sector portion of the Project is estimated \nat $307 million. \n \nThe supplementary loan is proposed to ensure completion of the \nProject  by  addressing  remedial  measures  to  the  implementation \ndelay as well as the issue of the cost overrun in civil works. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will finance $100 million to cover \npart  of  (i)  the  price  escalation  during  construction,  and  (ii)  the \nfinancing  gap  caused  by \nlocal  currency  appreciation.  The \nGovernment of India will finance the remaining $207 million.  \n \nThe  risk  of  further  cost  overrun  is  low  because  (i)  all  subproject \napproval  and  civil  works  contract  awards  have  been  completed, \n(ii) the overall physical progress of civil works has exceeded 80%, \nand \nincludes  sufficient \nthe \n(iii) \ncontingencies.  \n \nWhile nine civil works contracts in the states of Madhya Pradesh \nand  Rajasthan  are  well  under  way,  the  progress  of  three  civil \nworks contracts in Uttar Pradesh is behind schedule. By extending \nthe supplementary loan, the Government and ADB will be able to \nthe  required \nensure \nstandards.  \n \nThe  National  Highways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI),  the  Executing \nto  ensure  smooth \nAgency,  has  undertaken  measures \nimplementation.  High-level  coordination  meetings  between  NHAI \nand the state government of Uttar Pradesh have been instituted to \n\nrevised  cost  estimate \n\nimplementation  of \n\nthese  contracts \n\nto \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nRevised Cost Estimates \n\n \nRevised Financing Plan \n\n \nSupplementary Financial \nAssistance Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \n\nthe  proposed  supplementary \n\nexpedite  site  clearance.  NHAI  management  has  been  meeting \nwith  the  contractors  at management  level  on  a quarterly  basis  to \ndiscuss  and  resolve  issues  smoothly  and  substantively.  With  the \nother  nine  contracts  well  under  way,  both  the  supervision \nconsultants and the project implementation unit of NHAI are now \nfocused on the three contracts in Uttar Pradesh. Project progress \nwill  also  be  monitored  at  the  tripartite  portfolio  review  meetings \n(TPRMs).  TPRMs  are  periodical  meetings  held  among  the \nMinistry of Finance, executing agencies for ADB-assisted projects, \nand  ADB  to  review  the  India  portfolio.  Since  2005,  TPRMs  have \nproven to be effective in ensuring smooth project implementation.  \n \nRevised costs for the Project, including those to be financed under \nthe proposed supplementary loan, are estimated at $1,099 million \nincluding  taxes  and  duties,  contingencies,  and  financing  charges \nduring implementation.  \n \nUnder the revised financing arrangements, the two ADB loans will \ncover  45.5%  of  the  total  investment  costs.  The  Government  will \nfinance  45.1%,  and  the  private  sector  will  finance  9.4%.  The \nloan \nGovernment  will  make \nproceeds available to NHAI promptly. \n \nA  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources \n(OCR) will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The supplementary OCR loan will \nhave  a  term  of  19  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  2  years,  an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum  and \nsuch  other \nthe  draft \nsupplementary loan agreement. \n \n31 December 2011 \n \nImplementation  arrangements  for  the  proposed  supplementary \nloan will remain the same as for the original loan, except for (i) a \nrevised  implementation  period,  (ii)  continuous  engagement  of \ncontractors  and  consultants,  (iii)  procurement  of  equipment,  and \n(iv) the use of retroactive financing. \n \nEnvironmental  and  social  safeguards  assessments  were \nconducted  prior  to  approval  of  the  original  loan  and  subprojects. \nSince there is no physical change within the original scope and/or \ndesign,  or  modified  or  incremental  activities  or  components,  no \nadditional  environmental  and  social  safeguards  assessments  are \nnecessary. \n\nterms  and  conditions  set \n\nforth \n\nin \n\n\fNational Capital\n\nState or Union Territory Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nGolden Quadrilateral\n\nNorth\u2013South Corridor\n\nEast\u2013West Corridor\n\nProject Road\n\nNational Road\n\nState Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\no\n28  00'N\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nN\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n200\n\nKilometers\n\no\n72  00'E\n\no\n80  00'E\n\nI N D I A\nNATIONAL HIGHWAY CORRIDOR (SECTOR) I PROJECT\n\nGanganagar\n\nU T T A R A K H A N D\n\nSirsa\n\nH A R Y A N A\n\nHisar\n\nMuzaffarnagar\n\nChuru\n\nGhaziabad\n\nDELHI\n\nBulandshahr\n\nBareiliy\n\nAligarh\n\nN E P A L\n\no\n28  00'N\n\nP A K I S T A N\n\nBikaner\n\nNagaur\n\nJaisalmer\n\nJaipur\n\nAgra\n\nR A J A S T H A N\nJodhpur\n\nAjmer\n\nU T T A R  P R A D E S H\n\nLucknow\n\nn\n\no rtio\n\ne ct o r  P\n\nP riv ate  S\n\nOrai\n\nKanpur\n\nBarah\n\nPati\n\nPali\n\nSirohi\n\nPublic Sector Portion\n\nKota\n\nShivpuri\n\nJhansi\n\nChhatarpur\n\nChittaurgarh\n\nBaran\n\nJhalawar\n\nUdaipur\n\nBasti\n\nMirzapur\n\no\n23  30'N\n\nG u l f  o f\nK a c h c h h\n\no\n23  30'N\n\nRadhanpur\n\nG U J A R A T\n\nAhmadabad\n\nGandhinagar\n\nRatlam\n\nRajgarh\n\nKatril\n\nJhabua\n\nIndore\n\nNarsimhapur\n\nBhopal\n\nM A D H Y A  P R A D E S H\n\nShahdol\n\nMandvi\n\nPorbandar\n\nRajkot\n\nA r a b i a n  S e a\n\nBhavnagar\n\nJunagadh\n\nBharuch\n\nBetul\n\nBilaspur\n\nC H H A T T I S G A R H\n\nNagpur\n\nRaipur\n\nDhule\n\nAkola\n\nNasik\n\nM A H A R A S H T R A\n\nAurangabad\n\no\n72  00'E\n\no\n80  00'E\n\n0\n9\n-\n1\n0\n2\n3\n \nH\nR\n\n\f\f \n\n1\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \n\n1. \nsupplementary loan to India for the National Highway Corridor (Sector) I Project.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Rationale \n\n2. \nIndia\u2019s economy had long suffered from the national highway system\u2019s chronic capacity \nshortage. In August 2001, of the national highway network of 58,112 kilometers (km), 40% were \nstill single lane and 57% were two lanes. Four-lane highways, a desirable standard for arterial \nnational  corridors,  accounted  for  only  3%.  The  Tenth  Five  Year  Plan  (2002\u20132007)  of  the \nGovernment  of  India  (the  Government)  thus  set  forth  several  investment  programs  to  improve \nthe  national  highway  system  by  (i)  widening  22,000  km  of  two-lane  roads  to  four  lanes; \n(ii) constructing  2,000 km  of  expressways;  (iii)  widening  22,500  km  of  single-lane  roads  to \ntwo lanes;  and  (iv) strengthening  19,300  km  of  pavement.  The  total  investment  required  to \nimplement these programs was estimated at $37 billion.  \n \n3. \nBecause  of  the  magnitude  of  investments  required,  the  Government  placed  highest \npriority  on  the  National  Highway  Development  Program  (NHDP)  to  upgrade  three  key  arterial \ncorridors:  (i)  Golden  Quadrilateral\u20146,000  km;  (ii)  North\u2013South  Corridor\u20144,000  km;  and \n(iii) East\u2013West  Corridor\u20143,300  km.  In  2003,  the  total  program  cost  was  estimated  at \n$13 billion\u2013$15 billion, to which the Government decided to allocate the central road funds on a \npriority  basis.  The  NHDP  was  expected  to  help  contribute  to  the  increased  integration  of  the \ncountry by connecting the entire eastern and western and also northern and southern ends of \nthe country. \n \nSince 2000, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) had supported NHDP with three loans \n4. \nand  provided  another  two  in  2003  and  2004,  totaling  $1.54  billion  (12%  of  the  total  program \ncost).2  \n \nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n5. \nIn support of the NHDP, ADB approved the National Highway Corridor (Sector) I Project, \nthe  fourth  in  the  series,  for  $400  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  in \nDecember  2003.  The  overall  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  establish  a  policy  and  institutional \nframework  for  the  efficient  delivery  of  highway  development  and  operation  and  maintenance \n\n                                                 \n1   A design and monitoring framework was revised based on the program and project framework for the original loan \nin ADB. 2003.

Under  this  framework,  the  Project  focuses  on  the  East\u2013West  Corridor  to \nachieve the following:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nupgrading  key  national  arterial  corridors  connecting  the  eastern  and  western \nends of the country, \nfacilitating public sector participation (PSP) in highway development,  \ncontributing  to  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  prevent  the  spread  of  human \nimmunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)  and  increase  awareness  of  the  possible  risk  of \nwomen and children trafficking,  and \nenhancing road safety through pilot introduction of a safety zone concept for part \nof the national highway under the East\u2013West Corridor.  \n\n \nIn line with the objectives and scope, the Project includes the following components:  \n\n(i) \n\nPart A: Highway investment component. This component is to widen stretches \nbetween  Chittorgarh  in  the  state  of  Rajasthan  and  Orai  in  the  state  of  Uttar \nPradesh into four-lane roads.  \n\n(ii)  Part  B:  Private  sector  participation  component.  This component  is to  widen \nthe stretch between Orai and Barah in Uttar Pradesh into four-lane roads through \nPSP scheme. \n\n(iii)  Part  C:  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  component.  This  component  is  to \nconduct campaigns to help prevent the spread of HIV and increase awareness of \nthe risk of trafficking in women and children. \n\n(iv)  Part  D:  Road  safety  component. This component is to develop a safety zone \nconcept and carry out pilot testing of the concept in a selected section between \nthe cities of Jhansi and Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh.  \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n7. \nThe  total  project  cost  was  estimated  at  $760  million.

After  the  initial  1-year  delay  in  procurement  and  subproject  approval,  the \nNational  Highways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI),  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  Project,  made \nsubstantial  progress  in  project  implementation.  All  12  civil  works  contracts  under  the  ADB-\nfinanced  highway  investment  component  were  awarded  in  2005.  Out  of  the  12  civil  works \ncontracts, 6 contracts were substantially completed in 2008, and 3 contracts will be substantially \ncompleted by the middle of 2009. The performance of the remaining 3 contracts, which are all in \nUttar Pradesh, is at a low level\u2014about 50%. Substantial completion of the remaining contracts \nis  anticipated  by  June  2010.  The  overall  physical  progress  of  all  12  civil  works  contracts, \nhowever, has exceeded 80% on a weighted average basis. With respect to the PSP component, \nNHAI engaged a financial adviser to support development of part of the project corridor through \nPSP. After competitive bidding, a build-operate-transfer (BOT) annuity concession was awarded \nin  April  2006,  and  construction  works  commenced  in  October  2006.  Completion  of  the \nconstruction works is currently anticipated by the end of 2009. With respect to the HIV/AIDS and \nthrough \nanti-trafficking  component,  NHAI  has  conducted \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  For  the  road  safety  component,  NHAI  identified  the \nJhansi\u2013Orai  section  as  a  pilot  section  for  implementation  of  a  safety  zone.  Consultant \nrecruitment is currently in process. Appendix 2 details the project implementation status.  \n \n11. \nCost  Overrun.  The  Project  has  experienced  a  substantial  cost  overrun  in  civil  works. \nThe total civil works cost under the ADB-financed component was estimated at Rs24,633 million \n(or  $547  million) 3  at  the  time  of  processing  the  Project.  However,  the  total  contract  price \nawarded in 2005 amounted to Rs34,354 million (or $763 million), i.e., cost overrun of 39%. In \naddition,  during  the  construction  period  after  the  contract  awards,  all  major  construction  input \nitems  experienced  price  escalation.  The  total  final  contract  price  of  the  12  ADB-financed  civil \nworks contracts is now expected to be Rs39,170 million (or $870 million), 14% above the total \nawarded  price  and  59%  above  the  original  estimates.  When  ADB  approved  subprojects  and \ncontract  awards  in  2005,  substantial  cost  overrun  was  observed.  NHAI  opted  to  keep  ADB \n                                                 \n3 In this paragraph, $1 = Rs45 is used\u2014averaging the whole project period. \n\nthe  awareness  campaign \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nfinancing  to  all  subprojects  by  lowering  the  ADB  financing  percentage,  so  that  all  subprojects \ncould be implemented to the required standards set out in the loan agreement. This matter was \ndiscussed  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  NHAI,  and  ADB  agreed  that  counterpart  funds \nwould be used to finance the balance. However, as construction prices have further escalated \nand  NHDP  has  been  substantially  enlarged  since  commencement  of  the  Project, 4  the \nGovernment requested a supplementary loan from ADB to secure long-term loan funds for the \nProject. With respect to the original loan proceeds, as ADB has kept financing 67% of the civil \nworks  expenditures  in  accordance  with  the  original  loan  agreement,  cumulative  disbursement \nunder the loan has exceeded 97% of the net loan amount of $400 million. The loan proceeds for \ncivil works have been depleted.  \n \n12. \nStrength of the Project. The effectiveness of the project management arrangements for \nthe  major  part  of  the  Project  has  been  proven.  Particularly,  the  project  team  at  NHAI \nheadquarters  and  three  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  located  in  Madhya  Pradesh  and \nRajasthan demonstrated the capacity to implement the Project successfully. This is shown as (i) \nall  12  civil  works  contracts  under  the  ADB-financed  highway  investment  component  were \nawarded in 2005; and (ii) out of 9 contracts in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, 6 contracts were \nsubstantially  completed in  2008,  and  the  remaining  3 contracts  will  be substantially  completed \nby  the  middle  of  2009.  The  progress  in  these  contracts  contributed  to  the  achievements  in \ndisbursement since 2006 ($101 million in 2006, $152 million in 2007, and $131 million in 2008). \nThe  overall  physical  progress  of  the  highway  investment  component  has  already  exceeded \n80%. \n \n13.  Weakness  of  the  Project.  There  are  three  main  areas  experiencing  delays  in  project \nimplementation.  First,  at  the  initial  stage,  the  Project  experienced  a  delay  of  about  1  year \nbecause of (i) a longer procurement period mainly caused by implementation of prequalification \nfor  civil  works  contracts,  and  (ii)  prolonged  process  for  subproject  approval.  Second,  the \nprogress  of  the  three  civil  works  contracts  in  Uttar  Pradesh  has  been  slow.  The  delay  is  the \nresult  of  (i)  an  initial  delay  in  site  clearance,  (ii)  slow  mobilization  of  contractors,  and \n(iii) insufficient staffing at the construction supervision side. Third, the road safety component is \nyet to be implemented. As NHAI realized the implications of the cost increase in civil works for \nthe  Project,  NHAI  made  a  policy  decision  that  the  utilization  of  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  be \nprioritized  for  completion  of  the  civil  works  and  the  road  safety  component  be  financed  from \nNHAI\u2019s own resources.5 NHAI did not receive any response from its invitation for proposals from \nconsulting firms.   \n \nThe supplementary loan is proposed to ensure completion of the Project by addressing \n14. \nremedial  measures  to  the  implementation  delays  as  well  as  the  cost  overrun  in  civil  works \n(paras. 27\u201331).  \n \n\n                                                 \n4  The  Project  is  in  NHDP  phase  II.  The  NHDP  has  been  substantially  enlarged  from  Rs646,390  million  (up  to \nphase II)  to  Rs2,198,350  million  (up  to  phase  VII  excluding  phase  IV  which  is  under  consideration)  since \ncommencement of the Project. \n\n5  $12.3 million ($11.8 million for equipment and $0.5 million for consulting services)  was originally envisaged to be \nfinanced  from  ADB\u2019s  loan  proceeds.  However,  experiencing  a  substantial  cost  overrun  in  civil  works,  NHAI \nprioritized utilization of the ADB loan proceeds for civil works.  \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nCost Overrun \n\nThe reason for the cost overrun is an increase in civil works cost, caused mainly by two \n15. \nfactors:  (i)  price  underestimation  of  noncore  subprojects  at  the  period  of  processing  of  the \noriginal  loan,  and  (ii)  price  escalation  of  construction  labor  and  materials  during  construction. \nThe  original  price  underestimation  is  Rs9,721 million  or  $216  million  (footnote  3)  (67%)  of  the \ntotal civil works cost overrun and the construction price escalation amounts to Rs4,816 million or \n$107  million  (33%)  of  the  total  civil  works  cost  overrun.  The  slow  startup  of  project \nimplementation  also  had  an  adverse  effect  on  these  factors.  Appendix  3  analyzes  the  cost \noverrun in civil works. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nUnderestimation  at  the  period  of  processing  of  the  original  loan.  During \nprocessing of the original loan, a cost estimate of $0.90 million per kilometer was \nused  for  noncore  subprojects.  This  was  based  on  prices  of  upgrading  artery \ncorridors  to  four  lanes  in  previous  similar  projects  because  detailed  estimates \nwere  not  ready.  The  actual  price  during  the  noncore  subproject  approval  and \ncontract  award  period  was  $1.35 million  per  kilometer.  MOF,  NHAI,  and  ADB \nagreed that counterpart funds would be used to finance this financing gap (para. \n11).   \n\nPrice  escalation  during  construction.  Contracts  for  the  highway  construction \nprovide for price adjustment for the increase (or decrease) in rates and prices of \nlabor, cement, steel, plant, machinery and spares, fuel and lubricants, and other \nlocal materials in accordance with the contracts. During the construction period, \nall  these  items  experienced  price  escalation.  Price  escalations  accounted  for \n100%  of  the  cost  increase  during  the  construction  period  after  the  contract \nawards. The financing gap has been greater than would have been because the \noriginal  cost  estimates  at  the  time  of  processing  of  the  original  loan  did  not \ninclude contingencies. \n\n \nIn  addition  to  the  cost  overrun,  local  currency  appreciation  contributed  to  the  financing \n16. \ngap of $21 million under the ADB loan. At the time of loan appraisal of the Project in 2003, the \nexchange  rate  was  Rs45  per  $1.  However,  ADB  utilized  most  of  the  original  loan  proceeds \nwhen  the  local  currency  appreciated  against  the  US  dollar.  $373  million  (93%  of  the  original \nloan) has been utilized to date at an average rate of Rs42.5 per $1 for civil works, leading to the \n$21 million financing gap because of currency fluctuation.   \n \nB. \n\nImpact on the Project  \n\n17. \nThe  Government  needs  to  bear  all  additional  costs  required  under  the  public  sector \nportion  of  the  Project,  estimated  at  $307  million,6 to  complete  the  Project  if  no  supplementary \nloan is provided. In addition, the following risks are envisaged relating to the achievement of the \noriginal project objective if the supplementary loan is not provided: (i) further delay in completion \nof  the  ADB-financed  highway  investment  component,  which  will  decrease  economic  and \nfinancial  benefits  to  the  country  and  NHAI;  and  (ii)  further  delay  in implementation  of  the  road \nsafety  component.  With  respect  to  the  highway  investment  component,  although  NHAI  has \n                                                 \n6  The cost overrun of civil works is estimated at $323 million. As there are some savings of the costs in right-of-way, \nrelocation  of  utilities,  and  consulting  services,  the  additional  cost  required  under  the  public  sector  portion  of  the \nProject is estimated at $307 million.   \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\ndemonstrated  its  capacity  to  implement  the  Project  satisfactorily  in  Madhya  Pradesh  and \nRajasthan,  the  progress  of  three  contracts  in  Uttar  Pradesh  has  been  slow.  Currently,  it  is \nexpected  that  these  three  contracts  will  be  substantially  completed  in  2010.  By  extending  the \nsupplementary  loan,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  be  able  to  monitor  the  progress  of  these \ncontracts continuously and address implementation issues. If this leverage is lost, completion of \nthese contracts, i.e., completion of the entire highway investment component, may be delayed \nfurther.  Delay  in  completion  of  the  remaining  section  also  means  delay  in  commencement  of \ngeneration  of  the  Project\u2019s  full  economic  and  financial  benefits  to  the  country  and  NHAI.  It  is \nestimated that $14 million of economic benefit to the country and $10 million of toll revenue to \nNHAI  will  not  be  captured  if  completion  of  the  remaining  section  is  delayed  by  1  year.  In \naddition,  NHAI  is  yet  to  implement  the  road  safety  component.  With  the  supplementary  loan, \nADB can extend implementation support for the component. If ADB\u2019s involvement in the Project \nis not continued, this component may suffer further delay.  \n \nC. \n\nRationale \n\nCompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Supplementary  Financing.  The  Project  is  under \n18. \nthe  NHDP,  which  is  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  Eleventh  Five  Year  Plan  (2007\u20132012),  so  the \nProject  continues  to  be  a  priority  in  the  Government\u2019s  development  strategy.  The  objective  of \nthe  supplementary  loan  is  to  ensure  completion  of  the  Project  as  originally  envisaged  by \naddressing  remedial  measures  to  the  implementation  delays  as  well  as  the  issue  of  the  cost \noverrun in civil works (paras. 27\u201331). The overall physical progress of ADB-financed civil works \ncontracts  under  the  Project  has  exceeded  80%,  and  physical  completion  of  the  Project  is \nexpected  by  June  2011,  including  the  road  safety  component  and  the  defect  liability  period  of \nthe  last  civil  works  contract  under  the  highway  investment  component.  The  Project  is  in  an \nadvanced stage of implementation and can be completed within a relatively short time.  \n \n19. \nThe  increase  in  the  original  cost  estimates  in  the  Project  was  caused  by  price \nunderestimation  of  noncore  subprojects  at  the  original  loan  processing  period  and  price \nescalation  of  labor  and  materials  during  the  construction  period.  Therefore,  there  is  (i)  no \nphysical change within the original scope and/or design, or modified or incremental activities or \ncomponents; and (ii) no change in environment and social safeguards requirements. \n \n20. \nEconomic  and  Financial  Viability  and  Financial  Sustainability.  Revised  economic \nand  financial  analyses  have  been  conducted  for  the  whole  stretch  of  the  project  corridor, \nincluding core and noncore subprojects, to provide the complete economic and financial status \nof the Project.7 The revised total costs and benefits have been used for evaluating the Project. \nThe  revised  study  on  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  confirms  the  Project  is \neconomically viable; the EIRR is 15.2%. The analysis also shows that the quantified economic \nbenefits  are  robust  to  various  sensitivity  tests.  In  the  worst-case  scenario\u2014overall  benefits \nreduced by 20%\u2014the EIRR remains at 13.4%. In the revised financial assessment, the financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  analysis  is  5.8%,  which  is  above  NHAI\u2019s  marginal  weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC) in real terms, estimated at 2.5%. In the sensitivity tests, FIRR is \nmost  adversely  affected  by  the  increase  in  O&M  cost  and  decrease  in  revenue.  Under  this \nscenario,  the  FIRR  of  4.0%  is  still  above  NHAI's  marginal  WACC,  so  the  Project  remains \nfinancially  viable.  With  respect  to  the  sustainability  of  the  Project,  NHAI  has  the  capacity  to \noperate  and  maintain  the  project  roads.  NHAI  collects  tolls,  part  of  which  is  utilized  for  O&M \n\n                                                 \n7   The  original  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  (RRP)  provided  only  the  EIRR  and  FIRR  for  the  core \n\nsubprojects because of the sector loan modality.  \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nactivities.8 A  designated  corridor  management  unit  has  been  established  in  NHAI  to  oversee \nO&M activities of highways. For the project roads, operate-maintain-transfer concessions are to \nbe awarded (except the section where a BOT annuity concession has been awarded) to parties \nthat  will  offer  the  highest  periodical  payments  to  NHAI.  Therefore,  the  Project  remains \neconomically viable and financially sustainable.   \n \nD. \n\nRevised Cost Estimates  \n\nRevised  costs  for  the  Project,  including  those  to  be  financed  under  the  proposed \n21. \nsupplementary loan, are estimated at $1,099 million including taxes and duties, contingencies, \nand  financing  charges  during  implementation.

The Government \nwill close the remaining financing gap of $207 million.  \n \n23. \nThe  original  loan  of  $400  million  was  allocated  from  ADB\u2019s  OCR.  With  an  additional \n$100  million  proposed  under  the  supplementary  loan  from  OCR,  the  total  available  ADB  loan \namount  will  be  $500  million.  The  supplementary  OCR  loan  will  have  a  term  of  19  years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  2  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms \nand  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  supplementary  loan  agreement.  The  Government  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \n\n                                                 \n8  According to NHAI\u2019s financial statement for FY2008, NHAI collected Rs45.7 billion in tolls and spent Rs23.8 billion \n\non maintenance of highways during FY2008. \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nfacility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices \nwere the Government\u2019s own independent decision and not in reliance on any communication or \nadvice from ADB.  \n \nUnder  the  revised  financing  arrangements,  the  two  ADB  loans  will  cover  45.5% \n24. \n($500 million) of the total investment costs of $1,099 million. The proposed supplementary loan \nwill cover 29.5% ($100 million) of the total additional financing requirement of $339 million.9 The \nsupplementary  loan  will  finance  a  portion  of  civil  works  under  the  highway  investment \ncomponent  ($97.2  million)  and  consulting  services  ($2.0  million  for  the  highway  investment \ncomponent  and  $0.8  million  for  the  road  safety  component).  The  loan  proceeds  under  the \noriginal loan have been disbursed on the basis of 67% of civil works expenditures, and 100% of \nconsulting services expenditures excluding taxes and duties. However, the loan proceeds under \nthe supplementary loan will be disbursed on the basis of 90%10 of civil works expenditures, and \n100% of consulting services expenditures excluding taxes and duties.  \n \n25. \nThe financing charges during implementation will not be capitalized in the ADB loans. Of \nthe  total  investment  costs,  the  Government  will  finance  45.1%,  which  will  include  taxes  and \nduties, a portion of civil works, right-of-way, relocation of utilities, a portion of consulting services, \nequipment,  project  management,  and  financial  charges.  The  construction  cost  of  the  Orai\u2013\nBarah section ($103 million) being developed under a PSP scheme will be covered by a private \nconcessionaire. The revised financing plan (showing both the public and private sector portions) \nis summarized in Table 4. Details of the revised financing plan are in Appendix 4. \n \n26. \nThe  Government  will  make  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  proceeds  available  to \nNHAI promptly. The Government\u2019s policy of assistance to NHAI for the East\u2013West Corridor is a \nloan-grant ratio of 20:80. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk of the loan.  \n \n\nTable 4: Revised Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nOrdinary Capital Resources: Original Allocation \nOrdinary Capital Resources: Supplementary Allocation \n\nSources \nAsian Development Bank \n\nGovernment \n\nOriginal Allocation \nSupplementary Allocation \n\nPrivate Sector \n\nOriginal Allocation \nSupplementary Allocation \n\n$ Million \n \n\n     400.0 \n     100.0 \n\n \n\n     291.6 \n     204.1a \n \n       68.6 \n       34.7 \n   1,099.0 \n\nPercent \n\n \n36.4 \n9.1 \n \n26.5 \n18.6 \n \n6.2 \n3.2 \n100.0 \n\nTotal \n\n          a   The additional cost required under the public sector portion of the Project is $307.3 million. ADB \nwill  finance  $100.0  million,  and  the  Government  will  finance  $207.3  million.  Because  there  is \nsaving  of  $3.2  million  in  the  Government  expenditures  under  the  private  sector  portion  of  the \nProject, the net supplementary loan allocation of the Government will be $204.1 million. \n\n         Sources: Asian Development Bank and National Highways Authority of India. \n \n\n                                                 \n9 The amount of $339 million includes cost overrun in the private sector portion. \n10 90% is proposed because now civil works expenditures are being borne solely by the Government as the original \nADB loan proceeds for civil works have been depleted. By the time the supplementary loan becomes effective, the \nGovernment will have financed most of the $207 million, i.e., the Government\u2019s financing part of the additional cost \nunder  the  public  sector  portion.  Therefore,  for  ADB  to  fully  finance  $100  million  under  the  constraint  of  the \nretroactive  financing  ceiling  of  20%,  ADB\u2019s  disbursement  percentage  for  the  supplementary  loan  needs  to  be \nincreased.  However,  this  arrangement  will  not  increase  ADB\u2019s  overall  financing  share  for  the  Project  from  that  in \nthe  original  financing  plan.  ADB\u2019s  overall  financing  share  in  the  original  financing  plan  is  52.6%  and  that  in  the \nrevised financing plan is 45.5%. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nF. \n\nRemedial Steps \n\n27. \nCost Overrun. The risk of further cost overrun is low because (i) all subproject approval \nand civil works contract awards have been completed, (ii) the overall physical progress of civil \nworks has already exceeded 80%, and (iii) the revised cost estimate for the supplementary loan \nincludes contingencies while the original cost estimate did not include contingencies because of \nthe sector loan modality.  \n \nPerformance  of  Remaining  Civil  Works  Contracts  in  Uttar  Pradesh.  Civil  works \n28. \nprocurement and subproject approval, which caused initial delay in project implementation, have \nbeen  completed.  The  remaining  risks  of  the  Project  are  (i)  delays  in  the  three  civil  works \ncontracts  in  Uttar  Pradesh,  and  (ii)  further  delay  in  implementation  of  the  road  safety \ncomponent.  \n \n29. \nThe  delays  in  civil  works  in  Uttar  Pradesh  are  attributed  to  (i)  initial  delays  in  site \nclearance,  (ii)  contractors\u2019  slow  mobilization,  and  (iii)  insufficient  staffing  at  the  construction \nsupervision  side.  NHAI  has  undertaken  measures  to  resolve  these  issues.  High-level \ncoordination meetings between NHAI and the state government of Uttar Pradesh to resolve the \nsite  clearance  matter  have  been  conducted  since  2007. 11  NHAI  management  has  been \nconducting  regular  meetings  with  management  of  the  contractors  to  discuss  and  resolve \ncontract  issues  smoothly  and  substantively.  Both  the  supervision  consultants  and  the  PIU \nJhansi  can  better  focus  on  the  three  contracts,  and  the  capacity  of  the  PIU  is  no  longer  an \nissue.12  \n \nTo address the implementation issues for the three remaining contracts in Uttar Pradesh \n30. \ncontinuously, NHAI has assured that it will continue meetings with the three contractors in Uttar \nPradesh at management level on a quarterly basis. NHAI will also enable ADB to be present at \nsuch meetings upon ADB\u2019s request. By such arrangement, ADB will also be able to review any \ncontract management issues such as contractor performance, construction safety, and contract \nvariation, if required.  \n \n31. \nImplementation of Road Safety Component. Unsuccessful recruitment of a consulting \nfirm  to  date  is  mainly  attributed  to  two  factors.  First,  the  original  costing  of  the  consulting \nservices  ($0.5  million)  was  an  underestimation  of  the  input  costs.  Second,  NHAI  had  tried  to \nrecruit  consultants  using  its  own  funds  and  procedures,  which  lessened  the  opportunity  to \nadvertise widely the business opportunity to international firms, so no bids were received. With \nrespect  to  the  first  factor,  sufficient  costing  for  the  assignment  is  proposed,  estimated  at \n$0.9 million.  With  respect  to  the  second  factor,  NHAI  has  resumed  the  recruitment  process \nusing  ADB\u2019s  procedures  and  loan  proceeds.  ADB  is  also  extending  the  necessary  support  to \nexpedite  the  process.  NHAI  has  assured  that  it  will  carry  out  pilot  testing  of  a  safety  zone \n\n                                                 \n11 The  chairman  and/or  member  from  NHAI  and  the  chief  secretary  and/or  principal  secretary  of  the  Public  Works \nDepartment from the state government of Uttar Pradesh usually participate in these meetings, which have helped \nexpedite site clearance. \n\n12 The supervision consultants for the three Uttar Pradesh contracts cover a total of six contracts (three in Madhya \nPradesh). As the contracts in Madhya Pradesh have been substantially completed, the supervision consultants can \nshift personnel from Madhya Pradesh to Uttar Pradesh. In addition, the PIU Jhansi used to cover four contracts of \nthe  Project,  including  a  BOT  contract  under  the  PSP  component.  However,  because  the  BOT  contract  was \ntransferred  from  the  PIU  Jhansi  to  another  PIU  in  2008,  the  PIU  Jhansi  now  has  only  three  project  contracts  to \noversee. The other three PIUs under the ADB-financed component (PIUs Chittorgarh, Baran and Shivpuri), which \nare satisfactorily implementing the Project, also cover three project contracts per PIU. The PIU Jhansi is headed by \na  project  director  supported  by  three  technical  managers.  This  is  a  standard  setup  to  manage  three  project \ncontracts.  \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nIn  addition \n\nto  project-specific  measures, \n\nconcept  in  a  timely  manner.  Consultants  to  be  recruited  will  assist  NHAI  in  implementing  the \ncomponent. \n \n32.  Measures  for  Future  Projects. \nthe \nGovernment and ADB have been exerting intensive efforts in countrywide portfolio management \nin recent years. The tripartite portfolio review meeting (TPRM) has been held 2\u20133 times a year \nsince  2005  among  MOF,  executing  agencies,  and  ADB,  which  significantly  improved  India\u2019s \nportfolio  performance.  During  TPRMs,  impediments  to  project  implementation  for  each  project \nare identified and solutions to overcome them are agreed, covering procurement, accurate cost \nestimation, cost overrun, realistic scheduling, safeguards, and other matters. Time-bound action \nplans  are  developed  for  ongoing  and  upcoming  projects  to  improve  overall  portfolio \nperformance. 13 In  2008,  TPRM  was  geared  up  to  monitor  project  outcomes  and  outputs  to \ndemonstrate ADB\u2019s development effectiveness.  \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nImplementation  arrangements  for  the  Project  under  the  proposed  supplementary  loan, \n33. \nincluding project management; procurement (a procurement plan is in Appendix 5); consulting \nto  date); 14 disbursement \nservices;  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \narrangements;  accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting;  project  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation; and project review remain the same as those in the original loan, except four specific \naspects: \n \n(i) \n\n(1998,  as  amended \n\nRevised  implementation  period.  The  original  closing  date  of  31  December \n2007  has  been  extended  to  31  December  2009  because  of  implementation \ndelays.  Substantial  completion  of  civil  works  is  expected  in  June  2010. \nCompletion  of  the  road  safety  component  is  expected  in  June  2011.  Under  the \ncircumstances,  the  completion  date  of  the  Project  needs  to  be  extended  until \n30 June 2011 and the closing date of the original loan needs to be extended until \n31 December 2011. A revised implementation schedule is in Appendix 6.  \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nContinuous  engagement  of  contractors  and  consultants. Under the original \nloan  for  the  Project,  12  civil  works  contractors  and  3  international  construction \nsupervision  consulting  firms  under  the  highway  investment  component  were \nengaged in accordance with the original loan agreement. In addition, a consulting \nfirm  for  the  road  safety  component  is  under  recruitment  in  accordance  with  the \noriginal  loan  agreement.  When  the  loan  proceeds  under  the  original  loan  are \n\n                                                 \n13 Major  actions  identified  in  the  TPRM  and  being  implemented  include  (i)  the  project  readiness  checklist  that  has \nbeen institutionalized by the Government since July 2008, which aims at improving the project quality at entry and \ndisbursement soon after loan signing; (ii) the business opportunity seminar that has been strengthened since 2007 \nto  attract  more  qualified  contractors,  suppliers,  and  consultants  to  ADB\u2019s  projects  and  make  procurement \nsuccessful;  and  (iii)  the  capacity  building  programs  that  have  also  been  intensified,  targeting  staff  of  executing \nagencies  to  familiarize  themselves  for  various  project  activities,  which  helps  avoid  price  escalation  caused  by \ndelays in project implementation. \n\n14 ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and  NHAI.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly \nor  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall \ninclude  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing \nAgency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nexhausted,  the  loan  proceeds  under  the  supplementary  loan  will  continue  to \nfinance the existing contracts until the end of project implementation.  \n\nProcurement  of  equipment.  Safety  equipment  originally  planned  for  ADB \nfinancing will be procured by a concessionaire through operate-maintain-transfer \narrangements. This approach is practical to make the safety zone operational as \nan operator is required for its implementation. Consultants being recruited under \nthe  road  safety  component  using  ADB\u2019s  loan  proceeds  will  assist  NHAI  in  the \nprocurement of equipment. \n\nRetroactive  financing.  To  ensure  continuity  of  the  works  under  ongoing \ncontracts, the Government has requested ADB\u2019s approval of retroactive financing \nof  up  to  20%  of  the  proposed  supplementary  financing  amount  for  eligible \nexpenditures in civil works incurred prior to loan effectiveness, but no earlier than \n12 months before the signing of the Loan Agreement. The Government has been \nadvised  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  retroactive  financing  does  not  constitute  a \ncommitment to finance the supplementary financing. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  increase  in  the  original  cost  estimates  was  caused  by  price  underestimation  of \n34. \nnoncore  subprojects  at  the  period  of  processing  of  the  original  loan  and  price  escalation  of \nconstruction labor and materials during construction. There is (i) no physical change within the \noriginal  scope  and/or  design,  or  modified  or  incremental  activities  or  components;  and  (ii) no \nchange  in  environment  and  social  safeguards  requirements.  Therefore,  the  project  benefits, \nimpacts,  assumptions,  and  risks  will  remain  the  same  as  for  the  original  loan,  except  for  the \nproject impacts on economic and financial viability. \n   \nEconomic  Viability.  The  Project  is  economically  viable;  the  estimated  EIRR  value  is \n35. \n15.2%.  Sensitivity  analysis  has  been  carried  out  for  (i)  generated  traffic  reduced  by  50%, \n(ii) benefits from time savings reduced by 50%, (iii) overall benefits reduced by 20%, and (iv) the \nscenario  in  which  construction  was  completed  in  2008  on  schedule  in  accordance  with  the \noriginal contracts. The results show that the quantified economic benefits are robust to various \nsensitivity  tests.  The  project  roads  according  to  the  original  schedule  in  the  contracts  should \nhave  been  completed  in  2008,  but  the  delay  has  only  an  insignificant  impact  on  the  overall \neconomic analysis results. Economic analysis is in Appendix 7.   \n \n36. \nFinancial  Viability  and  Sustainability.  Toll  revenues  are  estimated  based  on  the \nprojected traffic levels and applicable toll rates for national highways.15 The FIRR for the 30-year \noperation period is 5.8%. This is well below the level to attract PSP with full cost recovery from \ntoll revenue. Therefore, the validity of the decision to award the BOT component on an annuity \nbasis is confirmed. NHAI\u2019s marginal WACC in real terms is estimated at about 2.5%. The FIRR \nindicates a rate of return higher than the WACC, so the project is financially viable. Sensitivity \nanalysis  has  been  carried  out  on  the  following  scenarios:  (i)  O&M  cost  increased  by  20%, \n(ii) revenue  reduced  by  20%,  (iii)  O&M  cost  increased  by  20%  and  revenue  reduced  by  20%, \nand (iv) completion in 2008 on schedule in accordance with the original contracts. The results of \nthe sensitivity analysis on various cost and revenue assumptions confirm that NHAI can recover \nthe  project  investment  through  tolls.  Financial  analysis  is  in  Appendix  7.

NHAI  will  inform  ADB  in  advance  of  such \nmeetings  and  upon  ADB\u2019s  request,  ADB  may  be  present  at  the  meeting  as \nobserver. \n\n(ii)  Within 3 months after the effective date, NHAI will have recruited consultants for \nthe road safety component. Furthermore, the Government will ensure that NHAI \nimplements  pilot  testing  of  the  safety  zone  concept  within  21  months  after  the \nrecruitment of the consultants.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  NHAI  provides  the  required  counterpart  funds \nfor project implementation on time, to cover the required remaining funds needed \nto cover the cost overrun. NHAI will ensure prompt disbursement of appropriated \nfunds to ensure the successful completion of the Project implementation. \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n38. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nsupplementary  loan  of  $100,000,000  to  India  for  the  National  Highway  Corridor  (Sector)  I \nProject from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  19  years, \nincluding a grace period of 2 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n5 June 2009 \n \n\n\fAppendix 1     13 \n\nDesign Summary \n\nImpact \nImproved mobility of \npeople and goods to \ncontribute to the \neconomic growth of the \nstates connected by the \nproject corridor  \n \n\nOutcome \nImproved road transport \nservices and safety \nalong the project \ncorridor \n\nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\nPerformance Targets and/or \nIndicators \n\nData Sources and/or \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\n \nAverage annual growth rates of \npassenger vehicles in the project \ncorridor achieve 7% and goods vehicles \nachieve 5% from 2003 to 2015   \n \nDirect contribution by road transport \nsector to gross state domestic product \nincreases by 1% by 2015 (in FY2006 at \ncurrent prices: 3% in Rajasthan, 3% in \nMadhya Pradesh, 4% in Uttar Pradesh) \n\n \nTravel time decreases (average running \nspeed increases) upon completion of \nproject roads: cars 80 kph (51.5 kph in \n2002) and trucks 60 kph (40 kph in \n2002) \n \nNumber of traffic fatalities of project \ncorridor in 2012 does not exceed pre-\nproject level (308 fatalities in 2001)  \n\n \nPost-implementation \nmeasurement \n\n \n\nState government\u2019s \nsocioeconomic statistics \n\n \n\nAssumptions \nDelivery of the Project is \ntimely. \n \n\nEconomy remains stable. \n \nMarket mechanism functions \nwell. \n \n\n \nPost-implementation \nmeasurement \n \nState government\u2019s data and \nstatistics \n \n\nAssumptions \nDelivery of the Project is \ntimely. \n \n\nEnforcement and education \nof road safety function over \ntime \n \n\nOutputs \n1.

The  Project  has  the  following  components:  (i)  highway  investment \ncomponent  to  widen  stretches  between  Chittorgarh  and  Orai  into  four-lane  roads,  (ii)  private \nsector  participation  (PSP)  component  to  include  10%  of  project  highways  to  be  developed \nthrough  PSP  scheme,  (iii)  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  component  to  conduct  awareness \nprogram,  and  (iv)  road  safety  component  to  implement  a  pilot  road  safety  zone.  The  National \nHighways Authority of India (NHAI), the Executing Agency of the Project, has made substantial \nprogress in project implementation. All civil works contracts have been awarded, and the overall \nphysical progress of civil works under the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed component \nhas exceeded 80%. Cumulative disbursement under the loan has exceeded 97% of the net loan \namount.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \n\nThe project management arrangements under the Project are as follows: \n(i) \n\nProject Management \n\nHighway  investment  component  and  PSP  component.  The  project  team  of \nNHAI  and  project  implementation  units  currently  located  at  Chittorgarh,  Baran, \nShivpuri, Jhansi, and Kanpur are implementing the components. \nHIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  component.  The  Environmental  and  Social \nDevelopment Unit of NHAI is implementing the component. \nRoad  safety  component.  The  Corridor  Management  Unit  of  NHAI \nimplementing the component. \n\nis \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nHighway Investment Component \n\n \nC. \n \n3.  \nAfter an initial 1-year delay in procurement and subproject approval, all 12 ADB-financed \ncontract  packages  were  awarded  for  595  kilometer  (km)  stretches  of  part  of  the  East\u2013West \nCorridor  in  2005.  The  overall  physical  progress  has  exceeded  80%  on  a  weighted  average \nbasis.

The performance \nof  packages  in  Rajasthan  and  Madhya  Pradesh  has  been  generally  satisfactory,  but  the \n\n \n\n\f16     Appendix 2 \n\nPrivate Sector Participation Component \n\nHIV/AIDS and Anti-Trafficking Component \n\nprogress of three packages in Uttar Pradesh is still at a low level. NHAI has undertaken several \nmeasures to resolve this issue, including meetings with the three contractors in Uttar Pradesh at \nmanagement  level.  Through  such  efforts,  the  contractors  have  mobilized  to  speed  up  the \nprogress  of  work  recently.  In  addition,  the  least  performing  contractor  has  recently  increased \nlabor  forces  further  to  expedite  the  works.  Substantial  completion  of  the  remaining  three \npackages is anticipated by the middle of 2010.  \n \nD. \n \n5.  \nThe  Orai\u2013Bara  section  (62  km)  in  Uttar  Pradesh  was  selected  as  a  section  to  be \ndeveloped under PSP. NHAI engaged a financial adviser to support development of part of the \nproject  corridor  through  PSP.  Competitive  bidding  was  conducted  and a  build-operate-transfer \n(BOT)  annuity  concession  was  awarded  in  April  2006.  Construction  works  commenced  in \nOctober  2006.  Physical  progress  of  civil  works  as  of  the  end  of  March  2009  was  66%.  The \ncompletion of civil works is anticipated by December 2009.   \n \nE. \n \n6.  \nNHAI engaged nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to conduct a HIV/AlDS and human \ntrafficking awareness program. All the activities were conducted by the NGOs at worksites and \nin  project-influenced  areas.  The  activities  included  (i)  awareness-raising  among  construction \nworkers, (ii) public awareness raising and a change behavior campaign among high-risk groups, \n(iii)  strengthening  the  referral  systems  for  sexually  transmitted  infection  and  HIV  for  early \ndiagnosis  along  priority  highways,  (iv)  condom  promotion  and  distribution,  and  (v)  capacity \nbuilding of service providers and decision makers. In addition, civil works contracts incorporated \na provision requiring contractors to carry out HIV/AlDS awareness and prevention programs for \nits  laborers.  Contractors  conducted  HIV/AIDS  awareness  campaigns  at  project  sites.  No  child \nlabor was employed, and women were engaged on the principle of equal pay for equal work at \nthe  worksites.  Monitoring  has  been  conducted  periodically  by  NGOs  and  supervision \nconsultants. \n \nF. \n \nNHAI identified the Jhansi\u2013Orai section (120 km) in Uttar Pradesh as the pilot section of \n7.  \nthe  road  safety  zone.  Subsequently,  ADB  approved  a  short  list  and  request  for  proposals  for \nconsulting  services.  However,  as  the  selected  section  was  unlikely  to  be  ready  for  the  road \nsafety zone in a timely manner because of the delay in the section\u2019s civil works, NHAI selected \na road section of about 150 km from the RJ-11, MP-1 and MP-2 packages as the pilot section. \nNHAI intended to include installation of road safety equipment in the operate-maintain-transfer \nconcession  for  the  alternative  section.  To  award  this  concession  in  a  timely  manner,  NHAI \nneeded  to  expedite  recruitment  of  a  consulting  firm  that  would  prepare  specifications  of  road \nsafety  equipment.  Thus,  NHAI  used  its  own  consultant  recruitment  procedures,  which  are \nusually  much  shorter  than  ADB\u2019s  procedures.  However,  NHAI  did  not  receive  any  proposals \nfrom  consulting  firms.  The  consultant  recruitment  process  has  been  resumed  using  ADB\u2019s \nprocedures  for  the  originally  selected  pilot  section,  i.e.,  the  Jhansi\u2013Orai  section.  ADB  is  also \nextending  the  necessary  support  to  expedite  the  process.  A  consulting  firm  is  expected  to  be \nrecruited by September 2009, and completion of the component is expected by June 2011.  \n \nG. \n \n8. \nThe  Project  is  in  substantial  compliance  with  the  covenants  in  the  Loan  Agreement. \nAlmost  all  of  the  loan  covenants  have  been  either  complied  with  or  are  being  complied  with. \n\nRoad Safety Component \n\nLoan Covenants \n\n\fAppendix 2     17 \n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards \n\nWith respect to audit project accounts, auditors did not raise any significant points of concern. \nThe covenant that requires NHAI to carry out a road safety audit for subproject highways during \nthe  construction  and  operation  stages  and  to  develop  recommendations  to  be  used  on  other \nparts  of  the  national  highway  system  is  yet  to  be  complied  with.  Consultants  being  recruited \nunder the road safety component will carry out a road safety audit, and develop and implement \na pilot road safety zone in the project corridor, which will create a model for replication on other \nsections of the national highway system.  \n \nH. \n \n9.  \nResettlement.  Under the Project, efforts have been made to minimize land acquisition \nand reduce resettlement impacts as much as possible by (i) keeping rights-of-way to 45 meters \nwide  in  built-up  areas  and  reserve  forest  areas,  (ii)  adopting  concentric  symmetrical  widening, \n(iii) raising carriageways over congested segments, and (iv) using bypasses to avoid congested \nurban settlements. Resettlement plans were prepared as part of the report and recommendation \nof  the  President 1  and  subproject  appraisal  reports.  Key  measures  to  mitigate  resettlement \nimpacts include compensation at full replacement cost for all lost assets to the affected persons. \nIn  addition,  the  affected  persons  are  receiving  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  assistance  such \nas  shifting  allowance  for  shifting  the  affected  assets,  transitional  allowance  for  loss  of \nworkdays/income  because  of  dislocation,  and  an  economic  rehabilitation  grant  for  livelihood \nrestoration.  NHAI  engaged  six  NGOs  for  implementing  the  resettlement  plans  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). Significant progress has been achieved for \nboth land acquisition and resettlement and rehabilitation activities. Out of 657 km, 635 km (97%) \nof  the  land  was  acquired  and  handed  over  to  the  contractors,  and  compensation  paid  to \ntitleholders. For disbursement of resettlement and rehabilitation assistance, non-titleholders had \nbeen fully paid. For titleholders, resettlement and rehabilitation assistance has been completed \nin  the  RJ-6,  RJ-7,  RJ-8,  RJ-11,  MP-1,  and  MP-2  packages.  Delivery  of  all  the  remaining \ncompensation and/or resettlement and rehabilitation assistance payments to titleholders for all \npackages is expected to be completed in a timely manner.  \n \n10.  \nIndigenous  Peoples.  During appraisal of the Project, it was confirmed that the Project \nwould  not  adversely  affect  indigenous  peoples  or  ethnic  minorities  since  (i)  scheduled  tribes \ndirectly  affected  by  the  Project  are  shop  owners  and  business  people;  (ii)  their  economic \nactivities are strongly tied to mainstream economic activities and are unlikely to be affected any \ndifferently than non-tribal people; and (iii) resettlement plans paid special attention to scheduled \ntribes and other vulnerable groups within the resettlement processes\u2014particularly livelihood and \nincome  restoration,  including  a  separate  income  restoration  program  for  them  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  As  such,  a  separate  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment  plan  for  scheduled  tribes  was  not  needed.  During  project  implementation,  the \nProject has not adversely affected indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities. \n \n11.   Environmental Aspects. An initial environmental examination was carried out for each \nsubproject. During project implementation, (i) the Project is in full compliance with Government\u2019s \nenvironmental  safeguard  requirements;  (ii)  necessary  clearances  and  permits  have  been \nobtained for all the contract packages, the conditions laid in these clearances/permits are being \ncomplied  with,  and  the  status  of  compliance  is  being  reported  to  concerned  authorities  on  a \nregular basis; and (iii) the mitigation measures proposed in the environmental management plan \nare  being  implemented  by  contractors,  and  the  environmental  quality  performance  is  being \nmonitored and reports are submitted to statutory agencies. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

There  is  a  cost  overrun  of  Rs14,537  million  in  civil  works  for  the  Project,  a \n59%  increase  from  the  original  cost  estimate.  The  reasons  are  (i)  price  underestimation  of \nnoncore  subprojects  during  processing  of  the  original  loan;  and  (ii)  price  escalation  of \nconstruction \nthe  construction  period.  The  original  price \nunderestimation  amounts  to  Rs9,721  (67%)  of  the  total  civil  works  cost  overrun  and  the \nconstruction cost escalation amounts to Rs4,816 (33%). In addition, disbursement made during \nthe  strong  Indian  rupee  period  created  a  financing  gap  of  $21  million  in  the  loan  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). Table A3.1 provides the timing and scope of the cost overrun. \n \n\nTable A3.1: Summary Table of Cost Increase in Civil Works \n(Rs million) \n\nSubproject \n\nA. RRP Cost\u00aa \n\nB.

A cost overrun of Rs9,579 million occurred in \nnoncore subprojects from the time of processing of the original cost estimates to the period of \ncontract awards in 2005; this amounts to 99% of the total cost overrun in that period. The cost \noverrun  is  because  a  cost  estimate  of  $0.90  million  per  kilometer  was  used  for  noncore \nsubprojects during processing of the original loan. There were no detailed estimates because of \nits sector loan modality\u2014only core projects were appraised in detail at the time of processing. \nThe estimation of $0.90 million per kilometer1 was based on prices of previous similar projects \non  upgrading  artery  corridors  to  four  lanes.  The  actual  cost  during  the  awards  period  was \n$1.35 million per kilometer for the noncore subprojects.  \n \n3. \nWhen  ADB  approved  noncore  subprojects  as  well  as  contract  awards  in  2005,  this \nsubstantial  cost  difference  was  observed.  However,  because  all  subprojects  were  included  in \nthe original scope, the National Highways Authority of India did not want to leave out any of the \ncivil  works  contracts  from  the  ADB-financed  component.  This  issue  was  discussed  during \nsubsequent tripartite portfolio review meetings and the Ministry of Finance, National Highways \nAuthority of India, and ADB agreed that counterpart funds would be used to finance the balance. \nTherefore,  the  substantial  cost  overrun  upon  the  approval  of  noncore  subprojects  as  well  as \ncontract awards was not an issue.    \n \n4. \nCost  Increase  during  Construction  after  Contract  Awards.  The  contract  prices  for \nthe highway construction need to be adjusted for the increase (or decrease) in rates and prices \n                                                 \n1   For  example,  the  cost  estimates  for  the  section  from  Porbandar  to  Deesa  (468.3  km)  were  $0.89  million  per \nkilometer at the time of the approval of Loan 1944-IND (ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President \nto the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India for the East\u2013West Corridor Project.

During the construction period, all these input items \nexperienced price escalation as shown in Table A3.2. Price escalations account for 100% of the \ncost  increase  during  the  construction  period. 2  Comparing  the  2008  average  with  the  2005 \naverage, the consumer price index for industrial workers had increased 22%. Some construction \nmaterials  costs  had  increased  even  more,  such  as  iron  and  steel  (34%),  cement  (37%),  and \nbitumen (150%). In addition, the original cost estimates at the time of processing of the original \nloan did not include contingencies because of the sector loan modality, which also contributes to \nthe widening of the financing gap.  \n\n \nTable A3.2: Index Price of Input Items for Highway Construction in 2005 and 2008 \n \n\nB/A\u00aa \n\n1.34 \n\n1.37 \n\n1.22 \n\n197.8 \n\n338.4 \n\n253.5 \n\n162.5 \n\n222.7 \n\n536.0 \n\n655.9 \n\nA. 2005 Average  B. 2008 Average \n\nItem \nConsumer Price Index for Industrial Worker \n(Base 1982 = 100) \n \nWholesale Price Index (WPI) for Cement \n(Base 1993\u20131994 = 100) \n \nWPI for Iron and Steel \n(Base 1993\u20131994 = 100) \n \nWPI for Heavy Machinery and Parts \n(Base 1993\u20131994 = 100) \n \nWPI for Bitumen \n(Base 1993\u20131994 = 100) \n \nWPI for High Speed Diesel \n(Base 1993\u20131994 = 100) \na  2008 Average over 2005 Average. \nSources: Labour Bureau, Ministry of Labour and Employment, India; and Office of the Economic Advisor, Ministry of \nCommerce and Industry, India. \n \nEffect of Currency Fluctuation. At the time of the loan appraisal of the Project in 2003, \n5.  \nthe  exchange  rate  was  Rs45  per  $1.  However,  the  Indian  rupee  has  fluctuated  considerably \nfrom 2003 to 2009\u2014dropping close to Rs39 per $1 in July 2007 and peaking at Rs51 per $1 in \nMarch 2009. Despite this fluctuation, ADB disbursed a major part of the original loan proceeds \nduring the strong Indian rupee period between April 2007 and August 2008 (Figure A3.1)\u2014$373 \nmillion (93% of the original loan) has been disbursed to date at an average rate of Rs42.5 per \n$1 rate for civil works, creating a $21 million financing gap because of currency fluctuation. \n \n\n414.9 \n\n272.1 \n\n219.3 \n\n678.8 \n\n487.9 \n\n1.18 \n\n2.50 \n\n1.11 \n\n                                                 \n2 There is no cost increase in the total cost of 12 civil works contracts relating to change in work volume. \n\n \n\n\f20     Appendix 3 \n\n \n\nFigure A3: Monthly Average Rupee and United States Dollar Exchange Rate \n\n52.0 \n\n50.0 \n\n48.0 \n\n46.0 \n\n44.0 \n\n42.0 \n\n40.0 \n\n38.0 \n\n36.0 \n\n \n1\n$\n\n \n\n \nr\ne\np\ne\ne\np\nu\nR\nn\na\nd\nn\n\ni\n\n \n\nI\n \n:\ns\ne\nt\na\nR\n \ne\ng\nn\na\nh\nc\nx\nE\n\n \ng\nu\nA\n\n \np\ne\nS\n\n \nt\nc\nO\n\n \nv\no\nN\n\n \nc\ne\nD\n\n \nn\na\nJ\n\n \nb\ne\nF\n\n \nr\na\nM\n\n \nr\np\nA\n\n \ny\na\nM\n\n \nn\nu\nJ\n\n \nl\nu\nJ\n\n \ng\nu\nA\n\n \np\ne\nS\n\n \nt\nc\nO\n\n \nv\no\nN\n\n \nc\ne\nD\n\n \nn\na\nJ\n\n \nb\ne\nF\n\n \nr\na\nM\n\n \nr\np\nA\n\n \ny\na\nM\n\n \nn\nu\nJ\n\n \nl\nu\nJ\n\n \ng\nu\nA\n\n \np\ne\nS\n\n \nt\nc\nO\n\n \nv\no\nN\n\n \nc\ne\nD\n\n \nn\na\nJ\n\n \nb\ne\nF\n\n \nr\na\nM\n\n \nr\np\nA\n\n \ny\na\nM\n\n \nn\nu\nJ\n\n \nl\nu\nJ\n\n \ng\nu\nA\n\n \np\ne\nS\n\n \nt\nc\nO\n\n \nv\no\nN\n\n \nc\ne\nD\n\n \nn\na\nJ\n\n \nb\ne\nF\n\n \nr\na\nM\n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007\n\n2008 \n\n2009\n\nSource: Reserve Bank of India \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n24.7 \n5.0 \n2.3 \n0.0 \n0.7 \n32.8 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n32.8 \n0.3 \n4.0 \n0.2 \n37.2 \n \n \n \n0.2 \n0.7 \n0.3 \n0.0 \n1.1 \n \n38.4 \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($ million) \nOriginal Cost and Financing Plan \n\n \n\nADB \n\n \n$ \n \n\n \n% \n \n\nGovernment \nof India \n \n$ \n \n\n \n% \n \n\nPrivate \nSector \n \n \n$ \n% \n \n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nRevised Cost and Financing Plan \n\nADB \n\nGovernment \nof India \n\nPrivate \nSector \n\nItem \n\nAdvance Traffic Management System \n\nCivil Worksb \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n \n\n    Subtotal (a) \n\n     Subtotal (b) \n\nConsulting Services \n \n\na.

A  financial  and  economic \nevaluation  of  the  Project  was  undertaken  to  reassess  the  economic  viability  of  the  Project  in \nlight  of  the  cost  increase,  comparing  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios  as  well  as  the \nimpact  of  delays  in  project  completion.  The  analysis  follows  the  same  approach  used  for \nappraisal  of  the  original  loan1 for  the  Project,  with  updates  and  additional  considerations.

Completion  was  scheduled  for  the  first  half  of  2008  for \nsections A\u2013D and in 2009 for section E. Implementation of sections A\u2013D is funded by the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  and  the  National  Highways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI).  Section  E  is  being \nimplemented  with  private  sector  participation  as  a  build-operate-transfer  project,  with  the \nconcessionaire paid through annuity payments over the concession period. The Project is being \nimplemented  in  13  contract  packages\u20146  contract  packages  were  substantially  completed  by \nthe  end  of  2008,  4  packages  are  expected  to  be  substantially  completed  by  2009,  and  the \nremaining 3 in 2010.  \n \nB.  \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n4. \nTraffic volume and growth rates adopted in the previous  analysis have been reviewed. \nPassenger  vehicles  traffic  observed  ranges  from  2,000  to  2,500  in  sections  A\u2013D  and  about \n3,300  in  section  E.  Goods  vehicles  traffic  observed  was  very  low  in  sections  A  and  B  (below \n1,000) and fairly high in sections C, D, and E (over 3,000). Sections A and B are to the west of \nnational highway (NH)3; and sections C, D, and E are to the east of NH3, a major north\u2013south \nroute  linking  Mumbai  and  Delhi.  The  sections  west  and  east  of  NH3  show  distinct  traffic \n\n                                                 \n1  Asian  Development  Bank.  2003.

The observed growth \nrate  is  much  higher  than  the  projected  rate  in  section  B  while  the  observed  growth  rate  in \nsection  D  is  lower  than  the  projected  rate.  Section  B  was  in  very  poor  condition  as  well  as \nhaving bad geometry and an intermediate lane. The survey was conducted about 39 kilometers \n(km) from Kota in contract package RJ-11, which was substantially completed in October 2008. \nA  substantial  increase  in  traffic  was  observed  because  such  a  section  was  substantially \nimproved to a four-lane road, coupled with the robust economic growth in India in that period. \nTherefore,  the  additional  traffic  can  be  attributed  to  generated  traffic.  The  generated  traffic \ncontribution is estimated to be about 25%\u201330%, which is normal with upgrading of a single or \nintermediate lane carriageway in poor condition to a dual two-lane carriageway.  \n \n6.  \nIn  section  D,  the  generated  traffic  contribution  expected  is  negligible,  based  on  the \nassessment  of  travel  conditions.  The  traffic  count  was  carried  out  about  30  km  from  Jhansi \ntoward Orai in contract package UP-4. Construction in this section is considerably delayed and \nprogress  so  far  is  about  50%.  This  may  have  affected  traffic  growth  in  this  section.  Another \nmajor contributory factor to a lower growth rate could be the effect of the economic slowdown on \nrecent  counts.  The  economic  slowdown  is  reported  to  have  reduced  traffic,  especially  long-\ndistance traffic, which is reflected in the current counts in section D. The observed total traffic of \n6,725 vehicles in section D is about 8% lower than the projected traffic level for 2008 using 2003 \ntraffic  and  projected  growth  rates.  The  reduction  in  traffic  level  because  of  the  economic \nslowdown is likely to be more than this, based on the general assessment of the situation. This \nindicates that projected traffic growth rates could have been achieved in section D if not for the \nrecent economic situation.  \n \nTruck traffic volume in 2003 in section B was very low and the origin\u2013destination survey \n7. \nindicates only very local traffic using the road because of its poor condition. On the other hand, \nsection D had a high truck traffic volume (above 3,000). A large portion of this was long-distance \ntraffic, which has been affected by the economic slowdown.   \n \n8. \nThe current economic slowdown is expected to continue through 2010 or even 2011 and \nthen  recover.  Therefore,  traffic  growth  rates  adopted  in  the  earlier  analysis  are  slightly \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7     27 \n\n \n\nmoderated (Table A7.3) and used in the current analysis along with the base year traffic of 2003 \nprojected for all sections to arrive at the normal traffic for the analysis. The growth rates were \nmoderated  based  on  the  observed  trend  for  the  2003\u20132008  period  and  the  growth  trends  of \ndifferent vehicle types in the recent past. It is observed that the growth rate of two wheelers and \nthree wheelers is slowing down, and the growth rate of cars is rising. In goods traffic, the growth \nrate of larger vehicles is rising on national highways.  \n\n \nTable A7.3: Annual Traffic Growth Rates (%) Adopted for Present Analysis \n\nTime \nPeriod \n\nCar/ \nJeep/Van \n\nThree \nWheeler \n\nTwo \nWheeler \n\nBus \n\nLight \nCommercial \nVehicles \n\nTrucks \n(2 and 3 \naxle) \n\nArticulated \nTrucks \n\nTractor \n\n2004\u2013\n2010 \n2011\u2013\n2020 \n2021\u2013\n2030 \n2031\u2013\n2040 \n\n7.0 \n\n8.0 \n\n7.0 \n\n6.0 \n\n6.5 \n\n6.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n4.0 \n\n7.0 \n\n7.0 \n\n6.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n5.5 \n\n6.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n4.0 \n\n6.0 \n\n6.5 \n\n6.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n5.5 \n\n6.5 \n\n6.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n5.5 \n\n6.5 \n\n6.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n4.0 \n\n4.0 \n\n3.0 \n\n3.0 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n9. \nThe  review  of  project  reports  prepared  in  2003  has  indicated  the  potential  for  traffic \ndiversion  when  the  corridor  is  fully  built,  especially  to  sections  A  and  B.  The  project  corridor \nprovides a much shorter route for traffic between Gujarat (western part) and the project corridor \narea in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh and beyond. Because of the narrow roads and poor \ncondition  along  the  project  corridor,  this  traffic is  currently using  NH8 and  NH2  or  NH59,  NH3 \nand  NH25.  The  distance  saving  by  diverting  to  the  project  corridor  for  traffic  between  Gujarat \nand Uttar Pradesh is about 200 km.  \n \n10. \nIn  the  absence  of  a  detailed  origin\u2013destination  survey  on  these  alternate  routes, \navailable  origin\u2013destination  survey  data  on  potential  alternate  routes  have  been  studied  to \nassess  the  potential.  The  origin\u2013destination  survey  results  from  NH79  near  Bhilwara  and  on \nNH76 between Udaipur and Chittorgargh give a good indication of the traffic diversion potential. \nAnalysis of origin\u2013destination data2 shows that about 398 goods vehicles on this alternate route \nare potential candidate traffic to divert to the project corridor.  \n \n11. \nPotential divertible traffic using the NH59 and NH3 route go through the NH25, which is \npart of the project corridor beyond Shivpuri toward Jhansi and Orai. The magnitude of this traffic \ncould be 10% of the traffic observed on the project corridor.   \n \n12. \nTraffic levels along the project corridor indicate lower traffic levels in sections A and B, \nand higher traffic levels in sections C, D, and E. The overall traffic level and traffic distribution \nare also similar in these two groups. Sections A and B had mostly a single to intermediate lane \ncarriageway and very poor road surface and geometry. Sections C, D, and E mostly had a two-\nlane  carriageway.  Upgrading  of  the  roadway  will  improve  traffic  flow  conditions  drastically  and \nthis is likely to induce additional traffic. Considering the very poor condition of sections A and B, \ngenerated  traffic  is  considered  in  addition  to  normal  and  diverted  traffic.  Generated  traffic \nestimates  are  normally  assessed  based  on  elasticity  of  travel  demand  to  transport  cost.  The \nupgrading  is  estimated  to  reduce  the  vehicle  operating  cost  by  an  average  of  34%  for  cars \n(including time savings) and 23% for trucks. With travel demand elasticity of 1.0, this will result \n\n                                                 \n2  The Louise Berger Group, Inc. 2008.

The \nobserved change in traffic growth in sections A and B also indicates a similar generated traffic \ncontribution.  Based  on  both  these  assessments,  generated  traffic  is  assumed  to  be  30%  for \npassenger  traffic  and  25%  for  goods  traffic  for  sections  A  and  B.  No  generated  traffic  is \nconsidered  for  sections  C,  D,  and  E\u2014to  be  on  the  conservative  side\u2014as  the  existing  project \nroad sections are well utilized. \n \nC.  \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n13. \nThe economic analysis was conducted for the project corridor to reassess the economic \nviability  of  the  Project  in  light  of  the  construction  delays  and  cost  increase.  The  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) of the project corridor as a whole was calculated on the basis of \nincremental economic costs and benefits resulting from the Project over an assumed period of \n30  years  of  operation.  In  addition  to  the  benefit  to  normal  traffic,  benefits  to  the  estimated \ngenerated traffic have been included in the analysis. Additional benefits to diverted traffic from \ndistance saving, if any, have not been included\u2014on the conservative side.  \n \n14. \nConstruction  and  Maintenance  Costs.  The construction costs have been calculated \nbased  on  the  costs  already  incurred  and  projected  to  complete  the  construction.  Estimated \nfinancial  construction  costs  for  completion  of  the  Project,  as  reported  by  the  NHAI  project \nimplementation units, were used for each of the years since 2005 when the subprojects began. \nThe  costs  considered  do  not  include  the  price  escalation  and  all  costs  are  valued  at  2005 \nprices. \n \nThe  economic  costs  of  implementing  the  Project  are  based  on  the  financial  cost \n15. \nestimates  as  stated  above,  and  include  civil  works,  environmental  improvement  works,  land \nacquisition,  relocation  of  utilities,  resettlement  costs,  and  construction  supervision.  A  standard \nconversion factor of 0.90 was applied to the financial construction cost to arrive at the economic \nconstruction cost.  \n \n16. \nThe  routine maintenance  cost  was assumed  to  be  the same  in  both  without-  and with-\nproject  cases  as  in  the  earlier  analysis.  Periodic  maintenance  costs  were  considered  every \n5 years for a renewal course for both with- and without-project cases, and a structural overlay in \n20 years in the with-project case.  \n \n17.   Benefits.  Upgrading  of  the  project  corridor  to  a  four-lane  highway  will  provide  a \ndesirable level of service for the project analysis period of 30 years; and will provide improved \ntraffic  flow,  higher  vehicle  speeds,  and  shorter  travel  time\u2014all  resulting  in  lower  vehicle \noperating costs. Economic benefits estimated include vehicle operating cost savings (as a result \nof better roads and increased vehicle operating speeds) for all vehicles (normal and generated \ntraffic), and time savings for cargo traffic. The value of passenger time was not considered\u2014on \nthe  conservative  side.  The  upgrading  is  expected  to  reduce  traffic  accidents.  However,  higher \nspeed may increase traffic accidents in some cases. This has not been included in the analysis \nbecause of the difficulty in estimating the net effect.  \n \n18. \nThe  vehicle  operating  and  time  cost  savings  to  traffic  have  been  estimated  using  the \nhighway design and maintenance 4 model, with vehicle operating cost input data valued in 2005 \nprices to be compatible with the construction cost data. The fuel cost as obtained for 2005\u20132006 \nwas  used. Where  such  cost  data were  not  available  for  2005,  they  were  estimated  from  2008 \nprices assuming 5% inflation during the period. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7     29 \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return. Economic evaluation was carried out for the whole \n19. \nProject.  Sections  A  and  C  were  assumed  to  be  substantially  completed  by  the  end  of  2008. \nSection B is expected to be substantially completed by mid-2009, section D by mid-2010, and \nsection E by the end of December 2009.

Sensitivity \n20. \nanalysis  has  been  carried  out  to  test  the  sensitivity  of  the  EIRR,  with  adverse  changes  in  the \nassumptions used for estimating costs and benefits. The cost estimate used is the incurred cost. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nSince  the  Project  as  a  whole  is  over  80%  complete,  very  little  variation  in  cost  estimate  is \nanticipated. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out for (i) generated traffic reduced by 50%, (ii) \nbenefits  from  time  savings  reduced  by  50%,  (iii)  overall  benefits  reduced  by  20%,  and  (iv)  a \nhypothetical  scenario  of  completion  as  scheduled  in  the  original  contracts.

Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  overall  Project  is  justifiable  in \nsocial cost benefit terms. The Project as a whole is almost 80% complete, so no further change \nin  projected  time  or  cost  of  completion  is  anticipated.  The  projects  should  have  completed  in \n2008 in accordance with the original contract schedule, but the delay only has an insignificant \nimpact on the overall economic analysis results.  \n \n22. \nFinancial  Analysis.  Financial  analysis  was  carried  out  for  all  the  sections  using  the \nfinancial  model  developed  as  part  of  the  National  Highways  public-private  partnership  (PPP) \nproject.  Financial  analysis  considered  the  financial  construction  cost,  costs  associated  with \nimplementation  as  a  PPP  project,  toll  collection  and  operating  expenses,  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance expenses on the cost side, and toll revenue on the benefit side. The net of costs \nand benefits are used to calculate the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the total Project.  \n \nThe  FIRR  for  the  entire  corridor  was  calculated  on  the  basis  of  incremental  financial \n23. \ncosts and benefits resulting from the Project over an assumed period of 30 years of operation, \nwith a residual value proportional to the estimated remaining economic life. Financial costs are \npresented  in  2005  constant  prices.  Project  costs  comprise  capital  costs  and  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs.  Capital  costs  include  civil  works;  environmental  improvement  works;  land \nacquisition,  relocation  of  utilities,  and  resettlement  costs;  construction  supervision;  and  taxes \nand  duties.  Capital  costs  are  taken  based  on  actual  disbursement  starting  in  2005.  Operation \nand  maintenance  costs  include  annual  routine  maintenance  cost  (estimated  at  Rs180,000  per \nkm), annual operation cost (estimated at Rs8.0 million per toll plaza) and periodic maintenance \nundertaken  every  5  years  (estimated  at  Rs5.4  million  per  km)  and  20  years  (estimated  at \nRs16 million per km and implemented over 2 years).  \n \nToll revenues are based on the base traffic levels and traffic growth rates in Table A7.3 \n24. \nand have been estimated using 2008\u20132009 toll levels for national highways3\u2014Rs0.65 per km for \ncars;  Rs1.05  for  light  commercial  vehicles  and  minibuses;  Rs2.20  for  2-axle  trucks  and  large \nbuses; and Rs3.45 for trucks with more than three axles, assuming a capture ratio of 80%.  \n\n                                                 \n3  Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways. 2008. National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and \n\nCollection) Rules.  New Delhi. \n\n \n\n\f32     Appendix 7 \n \n\n \n25. \nThe results of the financial analysis are in Table A7.7. The FIRR is estimated at 5.8%. \nTo  assess  whether  the  investment  can  be  financially  sustainable  for  NHAI,  through  toll \ncollection, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for NHAI has been assessed. NHAI\u2019s \nWACC  was  assessed  at  about  6% 4  (assuming  85%  government  funding  through  taxation \nrevenue,  loans,  and  grants;  and  15%  through  issue  of  capital  gains  tax-free  bonds).  Further, \nassuming  a  domestic  long-term  inflation  rate  of  5%  and  a  long-term  debt  rate  of  9%,5 NHAI\u2019s \nmarginal  WACC  in  real  terms  is  estimated  at  about  2.5%.  The  financial  analysis  indicates  a \nFIRR higher than this rate for the project corridor with a 30-year operation period, so the Project \nis financially sustainable.  \n \n26. \nThe  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  on  various  cost  and  revenue  assumptions  are  in \nTable A7.8. These confirm that, for NHAI, the Project can recover the investment through tolls \nwith a FIRR well above its average cost of capital in real terms. Section E is being implemented \nas a build-operate-transfer project with annuity payment, in which the concessionaire is paid a \nfixed amount over the concession period. Based on the analysis, NHAI will be able to recover \nthe cost of implementing the Project if NHAI decides to recover the investment through tolls with \na FIRR well above its marginal WACC.  \n\n                                                 \n4  Approximately equal to 10-year Treasury bond rate and coupon rate for tax-free bonds. \n5  Based on the publicly traded triple-A corporate bond rate as of January 2009. \n\n \n\n\fYear \n\n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n2030 \n2031 \n2032 \n2033 \n2034 \n2035 \n2036 \n2037 \n2038 \n2039 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nTable A7.7: Financial Analysis\u2014Annual Cost and Benefit Streams for the Whole Project \n(all amounts in Rs million) \n\nInvestment \nCost \n\nPeriodic \nMaintenance \n\nToll Revenue \n\nNet Revenue \n\nAppendix 7     33 \n\nRoutine \nMaintenance  \nand Operation \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n79.3 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n158.6 \n\n2,058.0 \n6,175.0 \n10,291.0 \n11,761.0 \n8,880.0 \n2,000.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n(24,699.0) \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n3,429.5 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n3,429.5 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n3,429.5 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n5,144.3 \n5,144.3 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n3,429.5 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n3,429.5 \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n387.0 \n1,547.8 \n1,903.6 \n2,029.1 \n2,163.0 \n2,305.7 \n2,457.9 \n2,620.1 \n2,793.2 \n2,977.7 \n3,174.4 \n3,384.3 \n3,588.9 \n3,806.0 \n4,036.3 \n4,280.6 \n4,539.7 \n4,814.6 \n5,106.1 \n5,415.4 \n5,743.6 \n6,091.6 \n6,400.0 \n6,724.0 \n\n7.064.6 \n\n7,422.5 \n7,798.6 \n8,193.9 \n8,193.9 \n8,193.9 \n8,193.9 \n\n(2,058.3) \n(6,174.8) \n(10,291.3) \n(11,761.2) \n(8,572.0) \n(610.8) \n1,745.0 \n1,870.6 \n2,004.4 \n(1,282.4) \n2,299.3 \n2,461.5 \n2,634.6 \n2,819.1 \n(413.7) \n3,225.7 \n3,430.4 \n3,647.5 \n3,877.7 \n692.5 \n4,381.1 \n4,656.0 \n4,947.6 \n112.6 \n440.7 \n5,933.1 \n6,241.4 \n6,565.4 \n6,906.0 \n3,834.3 \n7,640.0 \n8,035.3 \n8,035.3 \n8,035.3 \n29,304.9 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFIRR \n\n5.8% \n\n( ) = negative.
