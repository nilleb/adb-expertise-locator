The  report  also  describes  the  proposed \nadministration  of  an  equity  investment  of  up  to  $25,000,000  in  Indian  rupee  equivalent  to  be \nprovided by Leading Asia's Private Infrastructure Fund (LEAP)1, and if the Board approves the \nproposed equity investment, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe administration of the equity investment by LEAP. \n \n2. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  invest  in  AEPL  along  with  two  European \ndevelopment finance institutions, which will invest up to $25 million each, on the same terms and \nconditions.  The  proposed  investment  will  enable  AEPL  to  expand  its  solar  photovoltaic  (PV) \noperating and under construction generation capacity from 593 megawatts (MW) as of December \n2018 to 1,991 MW operating capacity by March 2023. The project will help the Government of \nIndia to meet the targets for non-fossil-fuel-based electric power generation and reduce India\u2019s \nemission intensity. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProject identification. AEPL, sponsored by Vineet Mittal through his investment vehicle \nAvaada  Power  Private  Limited  (APPL,  or  the  Sponsor),  is  one  of  India\u2019s  fastest-growing \nindependent  power  producers  (IPPs)  in  solar  power  generation.  ADB  has  prior  experience  of \nworking with Vineet Mittal. It invested $39 million in June 2014 and $11 million in March 2016 in \nWelspun  Renewables  Energy  Private  Limited  (WREPL),  a  company  controlled  by  Welspun \nEnergy Limited (WEL), which was co-sponsored by Vineet Mittal and B. K. Goenka. WREPL grew \nto  be  India\u2019s  largest  solar  power  company,  with  1,140  MW  of  capacity,  within  2  years  of  ADB \ninvestment. In 2016, the two partners decided to part ways and sold WREPL to Tata Power. ADB \nsuccessfully exited the investment with satisfactory returns. The proceeds realized by WEL were \ndivided between the two partners by demerging WEL. The demerger resulted in the formation of \nAEPL, with Vineet Mittal getting its full ownership. Mittal\u2019s vision for AEPL is to make it one of the \nleading solar companies in India by leveraging his strong industry experience. \n \n4. \nAEPL  has  secured  power  purchase  agreements  (PPAs)  for  1,199  MW  of  solar  PV \nprojects: 335 MW operating, 258 MW under construction, and 606 MW under development, as of \nDecember 2018. It has approached ADB for an aggregate equity investment of $50.0 million to \nmeet the equity requirements as per its business plan.  \n \nThe project provides ADB with an opportunity to further its commitment to scale up clean \n5. \nenergy financing.2 ADB\u2019s initiative will actively support the Government of India\u2019s target to achieve \n175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy generation capacity by 2022, of which 100 GW shall be \nfrom solar power. As of December 2018, operational solar generation capacity in India was about \n27.6 GW. The government expects the private sector to lead the capacity addition. The unique \nreverse auction structure, favorable movements in solar panel prices, creation of credible offtake \nintermediaries such as the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and enabling of infrastructure \nin the form of solar parks has resulted in solar power tariffs coming down rapidly to the current \n\n                                                \n1  Financing Partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n2  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\flow of \u20b92.44 per kilowatt-hour ($0.03), leading to improved affordability of solar power in India. In \naddition to PPAs with government agencies, there is approximately 5 GW of near-term potential \nfor direct power sales to industrial customers under the open access policy of state governments, \nwhich is more profitable. AEPL is looking to build a portfolio of open-access and auction-based \nprojects to balance risks and returns. \n \n6. \nProject design. AEPL has secured 1,199 MW of solar PV generation PPAs. Of the 593 \nMW  operational  or  under  construction  projects,  PPAs  for  443  MW  are  for  terms  of  25  years. \nBalance  150  MW  PPAs  are  with  industrial  customers  with  strong  credit  ratings  in  the  state  of \nKarnataka and are of varying tenors (5\u201325 years), with options to renew on mutually agreeable \nterms.  All  projects  with  long-term  PPAs  have  been  acquired  based  on  a  competitive  bidding \nprocess with the lowest power tariff being the key winning criteria. For new project bids after ADB \ninvestment,  rigorous  project  selection  criteria  have  been  agreed  upon  between  investors  and \nAEPL. \n  \n7. \nThrough  Vineet  Mittal\u2019s  earlier  leadership  of  WEL,  which  was  the  sole  in-house \nengineering,  procurement,  and  construction  (EPC)  provider  to  WREPL,  he  has  built  strong \nexecution capabilities. This provides AEPL with a unique edge in bidding, as it undertakes all EPC \nwork related to its underlying projects, allowing it to control project costs and timelines and retain \nthe  EPC  margin.  AEPL  is  the  sole  entity  through  which  the  Sponsor  will  own  and  operate  all \nrenewable energy projects undertaken by it. \n \n8. \nInvestee and sponsor. AEPL (project details as provided in Table 1) is owned entirely by \nAPPL, which in turn, is owned by Vineet Mittal and his spouse, Sindoor Mittal. Vineet Mittal has \nan established track record of implementing 1,140 MW of renewable energy projects capacity in \nfour  years  at  WREPL.  Prior  to  establishing  WREPL,  Vineet  Mittal  established  an  outsourcing \ncompany in India, Infowavz (now called Stream, a business process outsourcing firm). He is the \nchairman of the Solar Energy Task Force and a Co-Chair of the Renewable Energy Committee \nat The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM). He was twice \nrecognized as the \u2018Solar Man of the Year\u2019 in 2012 and 2014. \n \n9. \n \n10. \nAs part of the demerger process, the team from WEL, comprising about 167 professionals, \nhas  moved  to  AEPL  and  at  APPL.  Vineet  Mittal  spearheads  overall  strategy  including  project \nselection, procurement, and liaison with government agencies. Sindoor Mittal is responsible for \nleadership development and capital raising. Kishor Nair, who has more than 30 years of business \nexperience, leads project execution and implementation. Sudhir Sehgal, who has more than 35 \nyears of industry experience, leads project development, design, and engineering. The finance \nteam has strong relationships with large domestic financial institutions, having raised more than \n$1 billion of project financing. A separate team for land acquisition, with extensive experience in \npurchasing and leasing land, has already identified a land bank for significant expansion through \nfuture projects.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nTable 1: Avaada Energy Private Limited\u2019s Existing Projects \n\n \n\n \n\nPPA \n\nCOD \n\nState \n\nBid Tariff \n(\u20b9/kWh) \n\nTenor \n(Years) \n\nSECI \nCorporate \nCorporate \nCorporate \nSECI \nCentral \n\nMaharashtra \nKarnataka \nKarnataka \nKarnataka \nRajasthan \nUttar Pradesh \n\nLocation \nOperational \nChalisgaon \nBanavikal, Ilkal (OA) \nHanegal (OA) \nKanahosahalli (OA) \nBhadla \nKanpur \nConstruction \nPavagada \nIREL \nHAL \nSatara \nDevelopment \nGujarat \nPavagada 2 \nBadaun \nTBD \nDistributed \nTotal \nCOD  =  commercial  operations  date,  HAL  =  Hindustan  Aeronautics  Limited,  IREL  =  Indian  Rare  Earths  Limited,       \nkWh = kilowatt-hour, MW = megawatt, OA = open access, PPA = power purchase agreement, SECI = Solar Energy \nCorporation of India, TBD = To be decided. \na  States of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. \nSources: Avaada Energy Private Limited and Asian Development Bank. \n\n \nJun 2018 \nMar 2018 \nMar 2018 \nMar 2018 \nOct 2018 \nOct 2018 \n \nMar 2019 \nSep 2019 \nSep 2019 \nSep 2019 \n \nSep 2020 \nMar 2020 \nSep 2020 \nNov 2020 \nMay 2019 \n\nKarnataka \nOrissa \nTelangana \nMaharashtra \n \nGujarat \nKarnataka \nUttar Pradesh \nUttar Pradesh \nMultiplea \n\n25 \n10\u221225 \n5\u221225 \n25 \n25 \n25 \n \n25 \n25 \n25 \n25 \n \n25 \n25 \n25 \n25 \n25 \n\nCapacity \n(MW) \n335  \n80  \n90  \n30  \n30  \n100  \n5  \n258 \n150  \n5  \n3  \n100  \n606 \n300  \n150  \n50  \n100  \n6  \n1,199  \n\n4.43 \n4.46 \n4.79 \n4.30 \n2.62 \n4.18 \n \n2.92 \n3.90 \n3.12 \n4.43 \n \n2.44 \n2.92 \n3.23 \n3.07 \n3.23 \n\nState \nCentral \nCentral \nSECI \n \nState \nState \nState \nState \nState \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n (Confidential information redacted).  \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \n11. \n \nIntegrity  due  diligence  was  conducted.3 No  significant  or  potentially  significant  integrity \n12. \nrisks were identified.

The project is fully aligned with \nADB's Energy Policy, which prioritizes support for renewable energy development (footnote 2). \nThe project is consistent with ADB's Strategy 2030.6 It contributes to ADB\u2019s goal to provide climate \nfinance  of  $80  billion  cumulatively  from  2019  to  2030.  It  relates  to  two  of  the  five  core \nspecializations of ADB: infrastructure, and environment. The project will also contribute to ADB\u2019s \noperational  goal  of  scaling  up  private  sector  development  and  private  sector  operations.  The \nproject is aligned with the country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 for India, which calls for higher \nefficiency and carbon mitigation through power generation from renewable sources.7  \n \n17. \nLessons  from  previous  operations.  The  extended  annual  reviews  of  wind  and  solar \nprojects previously financed by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department in India highlighted \nthree key lessons: (i) the importance of resource assessment, (ii) the risks associated with land \nacquisition,  and  (iii)  the  need  for  adequate  power  evacuation  facilities.  These  have  been \nincorporated as part of implementation arrangement of the project and will be closely monitored \nby ADB as a key shareholder. \n \nD. \n \n18. \n \n19. \n \n20. \n \nE. \n \n21. \n \nF. \n \n22. \n \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n23. \nADB and LEAP will invest up to $25 million each in Indian rupee equivalent by subscribing \nto  compulsory  convertible  debentures  (CCDs)  issued  by  AEPL.

Upon \nADB\u2019s  intervention,  AEPL  will  strengthen  and  update  its  existing  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system (ESMS) to achieve its growth in an environmentally and socially responsible \nmanner by adopting higher and internationally recognized environmental and social standards. \nSimilarly, ADB\u2019s recommendations and requirements will lead to an improved gender policy within \nthe company. \n \nC. \n \n25. \n \n26. \n \n27. \n \n28. \n \n29. \n  \n30. \n \n31. \n \n32. \n \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n33. \nThe investment is a general corporate finance transaction under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement  (2009)  (SPS).  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  its  SPS  as \nfollows: environment (category B), involuntary resettlement (category B), and indigenous peoples \n(category B).8 This categorization is based on the potential environmental and social impacts of \nthe AEPL\u2019s existing and future projects. AEPL will use ADB\u2019s equity investment for developing \nrenewable  power  projects,  primarily  solar  PV  plants.  ADB  has  undertaken  due  diligence  and \nreviewed the potential environmental and social impacts of the project and the measures to avoid, \nminimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans. \nThe environmental and social measures and the institutional capacity and commitment of AEPL \nto manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \nAn  external  third  party  conducted  a  corporate  audit  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  SPS \n34. \nrequirements. 9  The  corporate  audit  assessed  that  the  operations  of  the  company  were  in \ncompliance  with  the  statutory  requirements.  The  current  environmental  and  social  systems, \nprocesses, and practices of the company were also commensurate with the risks and impacts \nassociated with its business and operation. The corporate audit findings indicated that  AEPL\u2019s \nESMS is broadly aligned with ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. However, some of the processes \nand  procedures  (like  early  stage  screening  of  risks,  construction  phase  labor,  and  safety \n\n                                                \n8   ADB. 2009.

The  audit  also  indicated  that \nenvironmental  and  social  resources  and  capacity  at  the  corporate  and  project  level  must  be \nstrengthened  and  regular  training  on  ESMSs  and  environmental  and  social  issues  should  be \nperformed to ensure adequate implementation.10 \n \n35. \nA corrective action plan has been developed incorporating these and other audit findings \nand  recommendations  based  on  which  AEPL  will  strengthen  and  update  its  existing  ESMS  to \ncomply  with  ADB  requirements.  AEPL  will  also  strengthen  its  environmental  and  social  team \nresources and capacity and provide regular ESMS and environmental and social training at the \ncorporate  and  project  level.  AEPL  will  also  report  on  an  annual  basis  to  ADB  on  ongoing \ncompliance with ESMS and ADB\u2019s SPS requirements. \n \nAEPL will comply with the national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \n36. \nStrategy  (2001),  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards. AEPL will report on an annual basis to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws, and \n(ii) the measures taken. ADB will seek information and conduct consultation with affected people \nin accordance with ADB requirements.11 \n \n37. \nAEPL  is  committed  to  implement  measures  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s \nempowerment  in its  business  activities  following ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and Development. 12 \nTherefore, the project is classified as \u201cSome Gender Elements\u201d. AEPL has agreed to undertake \nthe following key measures: (i) increase employment of women in the company (from the current \nbaseline of 12% to 24%), (ii) support skills development of women, (iii) support education of girls, \nand (iv) provide sanitation facilities for women. The project team supported AEPL in development \nof  a  gender  action  plan.
