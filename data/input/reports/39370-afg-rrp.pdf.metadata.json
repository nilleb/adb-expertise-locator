It accounts for \n50%  of  the  gross  domestic  product  and  is  the  major  source  of \nemployment  and \nfor  most  Afghans.  Livestock  and \nhorticulture are the dominant commercial agricultural areas. While \nAfghanistan  has  a  comparative  advantage  in  these  commodities, \ncurrent sector performance is poor. \n \nDuring  the  long  period of  conflict  and  recent  droughts,  production \nfell  dramatically.  Productivity  and  quality  standards  declined,  and \nhigh  postharvest  losses  of  30%\u201340%  occurred  because  of  lost \nmarket  infrastructure,  damage  to  irrigation  systems,  and  limited \naccess  to  technical  and  market  services.  Lower  production  and \nproduct quality has reduced export and domestic returns. \n \n\nincome \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nProject Investment Plan  \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nExecuting Agency \n\nProcurement \n\nThe  destruction  of  livestock  slaughterhouses  has  meant  that \nanimal  slaughter  is  undertaken  under  unhygienic  conditions,  with \nresultant  poor  quality  standards  and  product  losses.  There  are \nserious  risks  to  public  health  and  adverse  environmental  impacts \nfrom untreated waste.  \n \nInvestments  since  2001  have  allowed  horticultural  production  to \nincrease, and livestock numbers have risen. While these gains are \nconsiderable  under  the  circumstances,  the  potential  for  growth  in \nthese  industries  will  be  lost  without  investment  in  basic  market \nfacilities  and  reform  of  the  institutional  regulatory  environment. \nSuch investments need to be undertaken relatively quickly.  \n \nThe  project  impact  will  be  increased  growth  in  agriculture.  The \noutcome  will  be  more  efficient \nlivestock  and  horticulture \nagribusiness industries. \n \nThe investment cost is $31 million equivalent, including taxes and \nduties.  \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Afghanistan \n\nTotal \n\n          30.0 \n            1.0 \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n     31.0 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n% \n96.8 \n3.2 \n\n100.0 \n\n \n\n \n \nUntil 30 June 2014 \n \n31 December 2013 \n\nMAIL  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency,  and  laboratory  equipment \nwill be channeled through the Ministry of Commerce and Industries \n(MOCI).

The \nrecruitment  of  a  consultant  firm  will  be  based  on  a  full  technical \nproposal.  The  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be \nused,  weighted  90%  technical  and  10%  price.  Consultant  inputs \nare  outlined  in  Appendix  10.  The  selection  and  engagement  of \nconsultants  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  better  market  facilities  and  management. \nThis will cut product losses, raise product standards, and increase \nproduct  competitiveness  in  domestic  and  international  markets. \nThe  improved  productivity  will  increase  returns  to  producers  and \ntraders,  provide  opportunities  for  developing  value  addition  to \nproducts  in  Afghanistan,  and  create  employment.  These  facilities \nwill  have  significant  public  health  benefits  and  reduce  health  and \nenvironmental risks.  \n \nSecurity  remains  the  single  most  important  risk.  Institutional \ncapacity is a constraint, as is the geographic spread of horticulture \ninfrastructure  activities  across  several  areas.  Should  the  security \nenvironment change, project locations could be adjusted. \n \nThe  Government  of  Afghanistan  is  committed  to  the  Project. \nImproved  market  infrastructure  will  make  a  big  difference  to \nproducers  and  businesses.  But  a  risk  is  their  maintenance  and \nrepair,  particularly  in  the  case  of  horticulture  facilities.  Careful \nmanagement and supervision by the private companies operating \nthe  slaughterhouses  and \nfarmers\u2019  associations  and \nthe \ncooperatives  operating  the  small-scale  horticulture  facilities  will \nreduce  some  of  these  risks.  While  management  support  will  be \nprovided  by  the  Project  to  build  organizational  capacity,  the \nmagnitude of the risk should not be underestimated.  \n\n\f64 00'Eo\n\n72 00'Eo\n\nAFGHANISTAN\nAGRICULTURE MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE\nIMPROVEMENT PROJECT\n\nTAJIKISTAN\n\nIslam Qala\n\nHerat\n\nHERAT\n\nI R A N\n\nShindand\n\nTURKMENISTAN\n\nAndkhoi\n\nSheberghan\n\nSar-e-Pol\n\nMaimana\nFARYAB\n\nSAR-E-POL\n\nBADGHIS\n\nQala-i-Naw\n\nChaghcharan\n\nGHOR\n\nKhadir\n\nDAIKONDI\n\nUZBEKISTAN\n\nKeleft\nJOWZJAN\n\nHairatan\n\nBalkh\n\nKholm\n\nMazar-e-Sharif\n\nBALKH\n\nFaizabad\n\nBADAKHSHAN\n\nKONDOZ\n\nTAKHAR\n\nKondoz\n\nTaloqan\n\nEshkashem\n\nSamangan\nSAMANGAN\n\nBaghlan\nPul-e Khomri\n\nBAGHLAN\n\nBAMYAN\nBamyan\n\nDoshi\n\nCharikar\n\nPARWAN\n\nKABUL\n\nPANJSHIR\nBazarak\nMahmood-e-Raqi\nKAPISA\n\nLAGHMAN\nMehtar Lam\n\nNURISTAN\n\nKamdish\n\nKONAR\n\nJalalabad\n\nAsadabad\n\nWARDAK\nMaidanshahr\n\nKABUL\n\nPol-e' Alam\n\nNANGARHAR\n\nTorkham\n\nGhazni\n\nGHAZNI\n\nLOGAR\n\nPAKTIA\nGardez\n\nKHOST\n\nKhost\n\nSharan\n\nPAKTIKA\n\nFarah\n\nFARAH\n\nDelaram\n\nLashkar Gah\n\nORUZGAN\n\nTarin Kot\n\nMukur\n\nZABOL\n\nQalat\n\nKandahar\n\nZaranj\n\nNIMRUZ\n\nKudbar\n\nHELMAND\n\nKANDAHAR\n\nLanday\n\nPAKISTAN\n\nPEOPLE'S\nREPUBLIC\nOF\nCHINA\n\n36 00'No\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n32 00'No\n\nN\n\nKilometers\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nAirport\n\nNational Road\n\nNational Road (unpaved)\n\nOther Road\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n64 00'Eo\n\n72 00'Eo\n\n36 00'No\n\n32 00'No\n\n0\n8\n-\n3\n5\n1\n8\nE\nG\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Agriculture  Market  Infrastructure  Project  (the \nProject). \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nAt  the  request  of  the  Government  of  Afghanistan  (the  Government),  ADB  approved \n2. \ntechnical  assistance  in  late  2006  to  prepare  the  Project.1 The  project  design  and  monitoring \nframework is included in Appendix 1. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nAgriculture accounts for half of Afghanistan\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). It is the key \ndriver of sustainable economic growth and employment generation.2 Commercial agriculture3 in \nAfghanistan  is  dominated  by  horticulture  and  livestock,  with  product  sales  in  domestic  and \nexport  markets.  Afghanistan  has  enjoyed  a  comparative  advantage  in  these  commodities, \nsupplying 20% of the global market for raisins in the late 1970s, dominating the world pistachio \nmarket, and supplying livestock and wool products regionally. During the long period of conflict \nand  severe  droughts  of  the  late  1990s,  the  production  of  all  commodities  fell  drastically. \nProductivity and product quality standards declined, and high postharvest losses of 30%\u201340% \noccurred because of lost market infrastructure, damaged irrigation systems, and limited access \nto  technical  and  market  support.  While  considerable  investment  has  been  made  in  production \nsince 2001, agricultural growth potential will not be achieved without investment in basic market \ninfrastructure and reform of the institutional regulatory environment.  \n \nLivestock.  This  is  integral  to  all  farming  systems  in  Afghanistan. 4  After  falling \n4. \ndramatically  in  the  late  1990s,  livestock  numbers  have  increased  since  early  2001. 5 While \nproduction  is  increasing,  Afghanistan  still  imports  live  animals  for  meat,  frozen  meat  including \nchicken,  eggs,  and  wool.  The  meat  industry  is  large,  with  the  indicative  value  of  meat \nconsumption  in  Afghanistan  per  year  at  $800  million  and  with  the  capital  value  of  livestock \nassets  estimated  at  $3  billion.  Most  inedible  products  of  animal  origin  are  exported  after  first-\nstage  processing  (salting  and  washing  skin,  hides,  and  intestines  [casings];  dehairing  for \ncashmere; and washing and cutting carpets) or without any processing at all (wool for spinning). \nCarpets  are  an  important  export  that  accounted  in  2006  for  an  estimated  $180  million  of \nexports.6  \n \n5. \nHorticulture.  Dried  fruits  and  nuts  and  fresh  fruits  and  vegetables  have  played  a \ndominant role in Afghanistan exports. The horticulture area has expanded since 2001, totaling in \n2005 approximately 122,000 hectares (ha), with perennial nut crops totaling 12,000 ha and fruit \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for Preparing the Commercial Agriculture Development Project. Manila (approved \n\nfor $995,000 on 23 November).  \n\n2 The  rural  economy  is  the  major  source  of  employment  and  income  for  most  Afghans,  as  nearly  80%  of  the \n\npopulation, or 19 million people, live in impoverished rural areas. \n\n3  While wheat accounts for over two-thirds of cultivated area, it is typically a subsistence crop.  \n4  Agricultural and pasture areas account for 45% of land area. \n5  The Food and Agriculture Organization 2003 census estimates cattle at 4 million, sheep 9 million (still far below the \ncensus  number  in  the  1980s  to  early  1990s  of  19  million),  goats  7.3  million,  and  poultry  12  million.  These  are \nunderestimates,  especially  for  sheep  and  goats,  as  the  livestock  of  nomadic  kuchis,  which  accounts  for \napproximately 30% of total sheep and goat numbers, was not included. \n\n6  The Government estimate is conservative, as industry estimates are significantly higher.  \n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ntrees 106,000 ha, of which grapes occupied 58,000 ha, apricots 8,000 ha, berries 9,000 ha, and \nfigs 7,000 ha. Nurseries\u2019 current sales of nut and fruit seedlings indicate an expansion of area \nby 12,000 ha per year. Domestic demand for fresh fruits and vegetables is strong, as is export \ndemand for key commodities. In 2006, the value of exports was $70 million for fresh fruits and \n$111 million for dried fruits and nuts. Experts have estimated that, if productivity and quality can \nbe  improved,  the  sector  can  contribute  $1.5  billion  in  exports  in  10  years.7 The  Government\u2019s \nlower target is $250 million by 2015.  \n \nOpium Economy. Illegal opium production has expanded since 2001. While accounting \n6. \nfor only 3% of the total cultivated area, opium has become a major cash crop for a significant \nnumber of households. In 2006, it was valued at $3 billion, equivalent to 46% of the country\u2019s \nlegal  GDP.  Opium  is  a  labor-intensive  crop,  with  an  estimated  2  million  people  involved  in  its \nproduction.  The  expanding  opium  economy  has  harmed  the  Government\u2019s  state-building  and \nsecurity  efforts,  and  it  finances  corrupt  practices  in  key  production  areas.  While  the  existing \ngovernment  counter-narcotics  strategy  and  alternative  livelihood  programs  may  require \nmodification to be more effective in controlling opium production, a key element of any program \nis  producers\u2019  access  to  alternative  cash  crops  and  markets  in  a  secure  environment  with \neffective enforcement.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nMarket Infrastructure and Regulatory Environment \n\n \n7. \nEconomic  growth  and  market  development  in  commercial  livestock  and  horticulture  is \nlimited by inefficient commodity market chains that cause heavy product loss and poor product \nquality  and  lacks  the  product  certification  necessary  for  access  to  export  markets.  The  key \nconstraints  are  poor  and  fragmented  market  infrastructure  for  livestock  and  horticulture \nproducts,  with  limited  and  inadequate  commodity  collection,  storage,  packing,  and  processing \nfacilities; inadequate access to improved postharvest and processing technologies; and the lack \nof  product  standards.  Private  sector  investment  is  low  because  of  risk  in  the  current  business \nand  security  environment  and  limited  access  to  finance  for  infrastructure  investments,  in \nparticular for agribusinesses. A regulatory environment is slowly developing for meat inspection, \nincluding trained inspectors, and for public hygiene and animal health. Nonetheless, regulation \nis  lacking  in  terms  of  recognized  product  quality  and  certification  processes  for  the  export  of \nhorticultural  products  and  of  legislation  to  secure  transactions  and  leasing  for  financial  sector \ndevelopment. The project problem tree is in Appendix 2. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nLivestock and Horticulture Productivity and Product Quality \n\n \n8. \nLivestock.  Improving  the  livestock  value  chain  will  have  positive  economic  and  public \nhealth  benefits.  Currently  the  main  livestock  products  (meat,  hides,  skins,  casings,  and  wool) \nsuffer  low  productivity  and  quality,  with  limited  value  addition.  While  livestock  production  is \nexpanding,  dairy  production  is  rising  from  a  low  base,  and  the  established  carpet  industry \nundertakes the  key  value-adding  stages  of  cutting  and  washing  carpets  and  wool  in  Pakistan. \nAddressing  constraints  will  require  (i)  establishing  market  infrastructure  for  livestock  products \n(slaughterhouses; facilities for such by-products as hides, skins, and casings; dairy plants; and \nlivestock markets); (ii) improving the quality of livestock products through compliance with food \nsafety  requirements;  and  (iii)  developing  further  value  addition  to  local  products  and \nstrengthening animal production and animal health technical services.  \n\n                                                 \n7  The OTF Group. 2006. Strategy and Action Plan for Afghanistan\u2019s Dried Fruit and Nuts Cluster. USAID.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\nThe  meat  industry  in  Afghanistan  is  large.  An  estimated  1  million  cattle  and  buffaloes \n9. \nand 5 million sheep and goats are slaughtered in the country per year, with Kabul accounting for \n24%  of  the  former  and  20%  of  the  latter.  With  slaughterhouses  destroyed  in  the  conflict, \nbutchers have no option but to slaughter livestock in makeshift areas such as urban backyards. \nKabul  and  major  provincial  cities  have  no  slaughtering  facilities  or  very  basic  ones,  such  as \ncement slabs.8   \n \n10. \nThe  Government  has  prioritized  establishing  hygienic  slaughter  facilities  to  reduce \nwaste, mitigate public health risks, and improve the hygienic quality of the meat. Retail butchers \ncurrently get meat by slaughtering their own animals or from wholesalers who supply a number \nof  retailers.  While  the  standard  of  the  retail  outlets  varies,  there  is  demand  for  improving  the \nquality  of  meat  from  consumers  with  rising  incomes,  and  some  butchers  have  established \nimproved  retail  outlets  with  cool  storage  to  try  to  meet  this  demand.  Supermarkets  are  also \nselling better quality fresh and frozen meat.  \n \n11. \nThe  construction  of  slaughterhouses  and  ancillary  facilities  would  provide  (i)  critical \ninfrastructure  for  developing  professional  meat  production  and  processing  systems  and  (ii)  a \nfocus  for  increasingly  adding  value  to  meat  and  livestock  by-products.  Chilling  facilities  would \nimprove meat storage, enable the development of meat deboning and packaging systems, and \nprovide opportunities for the expanded marketing of high-quality meat  products in the growing \nurban  supermarket  trade.  The  increased  volume  of  hides,  skins,  and  intestines\u2014in  better \ncondition  than  under  the  existing  traditional  slaughter  system\u2014and  the  by-product  processing \nfacilities  operating  on  the  same  site  would  ensure  quicker  processing  and  higher-value  by-\nproducts for export. Existing hide and skin associations and traders could potentially undertake \nfurther processing of these products in Afghanistan before exporting them to Pakistan and other \nregional  markets.  Utilizing  waste  materials  as  commercial  products  will  be  possible  with  the \ncollection of blood for processing into blood meal for use in the emerging poultry feed industry. \nSlaughterhouses\u2019 carcass delivery system to butchers could be combined with a bone-collecting \nservice so that a bone meal facility on site would have raw material. \n \n12. \nAs the Government progressively reestablishes a functioning regulatory environment for \nanimal health and meat quality, there will be increased incentive for slaughterhouse killing. The \nGovernment  is  already  developing  a  regulatory  environment  for  public  hygiene,  environmental \nmitigation  measures,  and  animal  health.  This  indicates  that,  in  the  short  to  medium  term, \nbutchers will incrementally have to shift to slaughtering under controlled, hygienic conditions. \n \nHorticulture.    Afghanistan  has  a  significant  global  comparative  advantage  in  raisins, \n13. \nother dried fruit and vegetables, fresh fruits, and nuts. (An analysis of the commodity market is \nprovided  in  Appendix  3.)  However,  horticultural  products  are  currently  produced  in  low-\nproductivity  systems  with  poor  product  quality  and  grading  and  high  postharvest  losses. \nAddressing  these  constraints  will  require  improved  harvest  and  postharvest  practices; \ninvestment  in  infrastructure  for  storage,  packing  and  cold  storage,  processing,  and  product \nquality;  improved  planting  material;  and  access  to  technology  and  management  services.  The \nsmall-scale  farmers  who  dominate  production  will  benefit  from  establishing  and  strengthening \nfarmers\u2019 associations, which will improve market opportunities. \n \n14.  While producers invest in the production base, the incentives to develop market facilities \nand  improve  the  quality  of  export  products  is  constrained  by  traders\u2019,  processors\u2019,  and \nexporters\u2019 following a low-risk investment approach. This results in high postharvest losses and \n\n                                                 \n8 The only proper slaughterhouse in Kabul is in the Ministry of Defense and was constructed in the early 1940s. \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nthe sale of products based on industry standards rather than certified. Both the Government and \nthe  private  sector  recognize  the  urgent  need  to  improve  the  regulatory  environment  and \ncertification systems. This would bring higher economic returns and enable the private sector to \nexpand  directly  into  higher-value  markets,  rather  than  indirectly  through  using  an  intermediary \ncountry as the country of origin. The incentive for implementing such a change is the financial \nbenefit  for  private  businesses  to  collectively  improve  product  standards  and  certification.  It \nwould be an incremental process.  \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Sector \n\n \n15. \nFinancial  sector  operations  in  Afghanistan  are  relatively  new,  and  financial  institutions \nhave  yet  to  reestablish  a  strong  investment  lending  product  range  or  portfolio.  The  banking \nsector has focused on trade and short-term interest financing, though in late 2007 some small \nand medium-sized enterprise lending began. Currently, the geographic network of coverage is \nlimited.  Additional  financial  sector  constraints  include  the  lack  of  access  to  funds  and  an \nincreasing  risk  premium  for  private  sector  investments  in  the  current  environment.  Secure \ntransaction  and  leasing  legislation  is  being  prepared  and,  once  approved,  will  remove  a \nregulatory constraint and facilitate growth in leasing.  \n \n16. \nGiven  the  constraints  and  the  failure  of  financial  institutions  to  provide  investment \nproducts,  other  options  to  support  market  infrastructure  investments  are  required,  as  these \ninvestments  will  bring  significant  economic  benefits  and  growth.  Investments  using  public-\nprivate partnerships are assessed as commercially viable and provide a feasible alternative.  \n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n \n17. \nExisting  development  partners\u2019  projects  have  focused  on  developing  and  expanding \nhorticultural and livestock production in targeted areas. ADB, the European Commission (EC), \nand the World Bank are undertaking a number of irrigation and water resource projects that are \nexpanding  the  production  base  for  horticultural  enterprises  and,  to  a  more  limited  extent,  the \nopportunity  to  expand  livestock  production.  Currently,  few  development  partners  support \nagribusiness  market  development.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development \n(USAID) has engaged in market development projects with the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, \nand  Livestock  (MAIL),  with  pilot  activities  and  infrastructure  such  as  farmer  association  cold \nstores, storage, and export marketing to facilitate exports and market growth. A key priority is to \ncomplement these activities with support for further market-based development. A summary list \nof development partners\u2019 projects is provided in Appendix 4. \n \n18. \nThe World Bank is undertaking a horticulture and livestock project to improve production \nquality  with  technical  services  in  the  central  and  northern  regions,  and  a  dairy  is  to  be \nestablished  in  the  Kabul  region.  The  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United \nKingdom (DFID) and USAID projects work in the eastern and southern regions with a range of \nprojects, some of which include alternative livelihoods and livestock products, including carpets \nand fresh horticultural exports. The Rural Business Support Project of ADB and the Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction started in late 2007 with the plan to strengthen the commodity value chain \nfor  wool  and  carpets,  including  cutting  and  washing  facilities,  and  for  vegetable  oil  processing \nand potato storage in selected districts of three provinces. The EC has an animal health project \nwith MAIL to develop capacity and laboratories for animal health testing, setting regulations, and \ninspection  services,  and  to  establish  veterinary  field  clinics  for  the  delivery  of  services.  The \nAfghanistan  Rural  Enterprise  Development  Program,  piloted  by  the  Ministry  of  Rural \nReconstruction  and  Development,  will  focus  on  establishing  and  strengthening  industry  and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\nproducers\u2019 associations and enterprise groups, as well as savings and credit groups to support \nrural enterprise development.  \n \n19. \nHigh  postharvest  losses,  poor  quality,  and  the  lack  of  product  certification  result  in  low \nproductivity  and  returns  for  livestock  and  horticultural  products.  These  problems  would  be \nresolved  with  strategic  market  investments,  an  improved  regulatory  environment,  and  easier \naccess  to  markets.  This  is  particularly  important  given  the  growth  in  livestock  numbers  and \nexpansion  in  horticultural  production.  Further,  linking  these  developments  with  some  existing \nprojects would be possible, as would working with producers and agribusinesses in the project \nareas  to  develop  infrastructure  as  the  next  step  in  improving  commodity  productivity,  quality, \nand value addition. \n \n\n5. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n \n20. \nThe  Government\u2019s  agriculture  sector  master  plan  and  the  Afghanistan  National \nDevelopment  Strategy  (ANDS,  2008)  detail  opportunities  for  growth  and  value  adding  in  core \nagricultural  commodities  in  the  horticulture  and  livestock  subsector,  including  the  need  to \ndevelop  a  market-based  regulatory  environment  with  access  to  inputs,  services,  and  markets. \nMAIL is establishing the regulatory environment and building capacity to undertake the required \ncertification  and  product  quality  assessment,  and  it  has  removed  previous  barriers  to  private \nsector  enterprise.  In  its  1387  (2008/2009)9 development  budget  submission  to  the  Ministry  of \nFinance  (MOF),  MAIL  identified  establishing  and  operating  slaughterhouses  as  a  priority  to \nimprove livestock enterprise returns from meat and such animal products as hides and casings \nand to reduce problems regarding urban environmental waste and public health risks associated \nwith existing slaughter systems.  \n \n\n6. \n\nADB Strategy \n\n \nThe  ADB  draft  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  Afghanistan  (2009\u20132012) 10  is \n21. \naligned  with  the  ADB  long-term  strategic  framework  (Strategy  2020) 11  and  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s ANDS priorities. The draft CPS continues the ADB focus on three priority sectors, \nwith  infrastructure  investment  and  reforms  planned  in  (i)  irrigation  and  water  resource \nmanagement  and  agricultural  market  infrastructure;  (ii)  power  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution; and (iii) transport and communications, with national road and communication links \nto  neighboring  countries.  ADB  support  will  improve  agricultural  growth  and  productivity  by  (i) \nrehabilitating  and  developing  new  irrigation  and  water  resource  infrastructure,  with  the \nassociated  expansion  and  improvement  in  enterprise  returns;  (ii)  developing  market-based \nagriculture  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  creating  an  enabling  regulatory  environment  to  facilitate \ngrowth in the sector.  \n \nThe  proposed  Project  will  undertake  agricultural  market  infrastructure  investments, \n22. \nwhich will generate inclusive economic growth. It supports the implementation of ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2020.  The  investments  will  improve  environmental  management  and  the  mitigation  of  adverse \nimpacts from the lack of infrastructure in cities. The effectiveness of these interventions will be \nsupported  by  other  ADB  infrastructure  activities  that  provide  improved  access  to  irrigation, \npower, and road transport. The proposed Project is included in the CPS for 2008. \n \n\n                                                 \n9  Financial year 1387 is from 21 March 2008 to 20 March 2009. \n10 To be submitted to ADB Board of Directors for approval in early 2009. \n11 ADB.  2008.  Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n7. \n\nLessons  \n\n \n23. \nAfghanistan\u2019s  agriculture  sector  and  rural  economy  are  characterized  by  weak \ninstitutions;  large  numbers  of  poor,  small  producers;  production  and  marketing  through \ntraditional, largely informal systems with little value added; and lightly mechanized, family-based \nbusinesses.  Given  the  wider  security  issues  and  limited  access  to  finance,  interventions  must \ntarget  priority  commodities;  support  critical  gaps  in  the  value  chain;  and  demonstrate  that \nproducers,  traders,  and  processors  can  effectively  respond  to  demands  in  the  domestic, \nregional, and wider export markets.  \n \n24. \nExperience  garnered  from  interventions  in  the  sector  and  the  region  indicates  that,  in \nemerging  and  post-conflict  economies,  where  institutional,  technical,  policy,  and  financial \nconstraints exist, a comprehensive approach is required. Government can play a key role as a \nfacilitator  for  market  development,  with  the  direct  provision  of  services  undertaken  by  the \nemerging  private  sector.  Regulatory  support  and  stimulation  of  business  services  in  such  an \nenvironment  is  effective  and  generates  economic  growth.  Improving  the  provision  of  business \nservices in such environments often requires time-bound, cost-sharing grant arrangements that \nassist  enterprise  development  and  improve  the  quality  of  agribusiness  service  provision. \nPositive  outcomes  are  achieved  by  helping  to  remove  barriers  to  establishing  enterprises  and \nadopting  new  technologies  and  practices.  Interventions  must  be  targeted  and  implemented \neffectively, with defined timelines for achieving cost recovery.  \n \n25. \nTo  address  current  capacity  constraints  and  the  limited  availability  of  professional  and \ntechnical  expertise,  project  interventions  will  need  to  use  an  incremental  approach  toward \ndeveloping  stronger  supply  chains  and  market  systems  and  assisting  in  strengthening \nproducers\u2019  and  traders\u2019  associations  and  institutions  that  will  be  able  to  facilitate  service \ndelivery.  Developing  the  capacity  of  private  sector  providers  and  establishing  a  functioning \nregulatory  capacity  will  be  critical.  The  steps  involved  will  be  incremental,  building  on  existing \nstructures  where  feasible,  strengthening  and  using  local  associations  and  institutions,  and \nkeeping activities targeted by commodity and area. For effective implementation, projects need \nstraightforward administrative arrangements. In the light of capacity constraints, the number of \nprocurement packages should be kept to a minimum.    \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  increased  agricultural  growth.  The  outcome  is  the \n\n26. \ndevelopment of more efficient livestock and horticulture agribusinesses.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n27. \nThe proposed Project will achieve the following outputs: improved agricultural marketing \ninfrastructure  with  investment  in  slaughterhouses,  small-scale  horticulture  market  facilities, \nlaboratories  to  certify  products,  and  improved  standards  for  horticultural  products  and  product \nmanagement systems.  \n \n\n1. \n\nImproved Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure  \n\n \nThe  proposed  Project  will  undertake  livestock  and  horticulture  market  infrastructure \n28. \ninvestments and provide support to improve the commercial operation of facilities, including the \nadoption  of  improved  postharvest  technologies  and  marketing  practices.  Slaughterhouses  will \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\nbe  constructed  in  Kabul  and  three  provincial  centers.  Small-scale  horticulture  collection  and \nstorage  facilities  will  be  established  in  production  areas  in  each  of  the  seven  regions  of  the \ncountry.  Commodity  certification \nimproved.  These \ninvestments will address critical gaps affecting productivity, product quality, market access, and \ndemand in domestic and regional markets.  \n \n\nlaboratories  will  be  developed  and \n\na. \n\nSlaughterhouses \n\n \nThe  proposed  Project  will  establish  five  slaughterhouses  with  supporting  facilities  for \n29. \nholding  livestock  and  managing  such  by-products  as  hides,  skins  and  casings12 and  wastes. \nTwo  will  be  in  Kabul  and  the  other  three  in  the  provincial  cities  of  Herat,  Kundus,  and  Mazar. \nMarket analysis of the livestock industry indicates demand for slaughterhouses in a number of \nmajor regional centers. Locations were selected based on criteria including livestock production \nand market demand, technical factors including environmental parameters and site availability, \nfinancial  and  economic  viability,  and  institutional  and  operational  sustainability.  Appendix  5 \nprovides details on the selection criteria. \n \n30. \nThe slaughterhouses will be constructed using a modular design on MAIL-owned land, \nwith long-term management and operation to be undertaken by the private entities. Each facility \nwill  require  a  site  of  approximately  2.5  ha  and  will  provide  space  for  livestock  holding, \ninspection,  and  slaughter;  the  initial  treatment  of  hides,  skins,  and  casings;  the  storage  and \ndisposal of solid organic waste; and the treatment and disposal of wastewater.  \n \n31. \nThe  slaughterhouse  design  is  for  a  facility  with  the  capacity  to  process  100  large \nruminants and 500 small ruminants per single shift, operating for 30 days per month. This will \nproduce 900 million kilograms of red meat per month, or 10,800 million kilograms per year. The \nexpected  throughput  of  one  slaughterhouse  equals  15%  of  the  large  ruminant  slaughter,  and \n18% of the small ruminant slaughter, in Kabul per year. The facilities will have the potential to \nincrease throughput with additional shifts. Using a modern facility that centralizes slaughter will \nfacilitate pre- and postmortem inspection; add value by saving blood; and produce higher-quality \nhides, skins, and intestines for further processing.  \n \nThe  slaughterhouse  preliminary  designs\u2014including  site  preparation,  water  treatment, \n32. \nwaste management, and utilities; their costing; and their private management structures\u2014have \nbeen  prepared.  The  final  design  and  preparation  of  tender  documents  will  be  completed  by \nDecember  2008.  This  will  enable  the  tender  process  to  be  undertaken  at  the  start  of  2009.  A \nturnkey  contract  is  proposed  for  the  facilities,  which  will  be  tendered  as  a  single  contract.  A \n1-year  support  component  for  management  will  be  included  in  the  contract  for  the \nslaughterhouses to ensure their adoption of modern hygienic practices and standards.  \n \nThe  slaughterhouses  will  operate  as  public-private  partnerships.  The  initial  investment \n33. \nwill be with public funds, but the management and operation of the structures will be contracted \nout to the private sector, with the Government\u2019s expectation that ownership of the facilities will \neventually  be  transferred  to  the  private  entities.  The  investment  model  is  infrastructure \ninvestment  by  Government,  with  the  assets  transferred,  operated,  and  managed  under  long-\nterm arrangements by private entities.  \n \n34. \nIt is proposed that a tender be undertaken for selecting the private entity to manage and \noperate  each  facility  prior  to  construction.  The  contract  for  management  and  operation  will  be \noffered  with  two  options:  (i)  a  long-term  lease-to-purchase  contract  or  a  long-term  lease  for \n                                                 \n12 Intestines used as meat casings for sausages and other processed meat products. \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nb. \n\nFarm-Level Collection and Marketing Facilities \n\nmanagement. The lease term is expected to be 15 years, with options for renewal after 5 years. \nThe criteria for selecting private entities will include previous business experience, especially in \nmeat  and  livestock  or  related  sectors;  company  equity  and  financial  management  capacity \nconfirmed with due diligence; management skills and the proposed business plan for managing \nand operating the facility, including provisions for undertaking the contract slaughter of livestock; \nand  the  type  of  lease  contract  requested.  Discussions  with  private  entities  in  the  proposed \nlocations  have  indicated  that  a  number  of  established  companies  with  relevant  experience \nwould be interested in tendering for operating, managing, and eventually owning such facilities. \nThe  contract  lease  payments  will  be  paid  into  the  MOF  single  treasury  account  and  used  for \ninvestment in agriculture. \n \n35. \nThe  slaughterhouse  investment  will  improve  the  quality  of  meat  and  by-products, \nincrease  product  returns,  and  provide  a  framework  for  developing  enterprises  to  add  value  to \nproducts.  There  will  be  significant  public  health  and  environmental  benefits,  as  the  current \npractice of slaughtering livestock on city lots and streets poses a major public health risk. \n \n \n \n36. \nThe  proposed  Project  will  establish  small-scale  horticulture  infrastructure  investments \nthat will include commodity collecting, sorting, and grading centers; drying facilities; and packing \nhouses  and  small  cold  storage  facilities  in  production  areas.  These  investments  will  be \nundertaken with farmers\u2019 organizations and agricultural cooperatives. They will have a catalytic \nrole,  demonstrating  the  incremental  returns  to  be  achieved  through  improved  postharvest \nhandling  and  marketing  and  the  benefits  of  strengthening  linkages  between  producer  groups \nand traders. The project-financed infrastructure investments are expected to range in cost from \napproximately $20,000 to $75,000 equivalent. The facilities will be constructed on MAIL-owned \nland and managed and operated by farmers\u2019 organizations and agricultural cooperatives.  \n \nThis  investment  will  support  sector  growth,  as  private  sector  and  financial  institution \n37. \nengagement  in  agribusiness  infrastructure,  especially  in  those  investments  that  involve  farmer \norganizations,  is  currently  very  limited.  Given  the  expanding  production  base  and  large \ninvestments in irrigation infrastructure underway, demand for such facilities is increasing. \n  \n38. \nThe investments will be selected based on (i) prioritized commodities in key production \nareas;  (ii)  technical  and  financial  viability;  (iii)  the  institutional  and  operational  sustainability  of \nthe  facility,  including  the  capacity  of  the  farmers\u2019  organizations;  and  (iv)  integration  with  other \nproject activities. Appendix 5 provides details on the selection criteria. Approximately 200 small-\nscale  market  investments  are  included.  The  investment  model  is  infrastructure  investment  by \nGovernment, with the assets operated and managed under long-term arrangements by farmers\u2019 \nand producers\u2019 groups and cooperatives. The Government expects ownership of the facilities to \nbe transferred to these producers\u2019 groups. Standard designs will be developed for the different \ntypes of small-scale infrastructure. Project support will be provided to facilitate their adoption of \nimproved postharvest technologies and marketing practices and for strengthening management \nand operation. \n  \n39. \nThe  commodity  market  chain  assessment  undertaken  during  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance will be reviewed in the first year of the Project. The outcome will be used to \nconfirm  the  priority  areas  for  supporting  value  chains  and  the  geographic  areas  within  each \nproduction  region  to  be  targeted,  to  develop  a  critical  mass  or  cluster  of  participating  farmers\u2019 \nassociations  and  strengthen  linkages  with  traders  and  processors.  The  reassessment  will \nenable  further  specification  of  the  small-scale  infrastructure  investment  requirements  and  the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\nassociated postharvest technology, management, and operational support required, as well as \ntraining needs. The project consultants and staff undertaking the review in the seven regions will \nlink  closely  with  the  provincial  MAIL,  farmers  and  associations,  the  Afghanistan  Chamber  of \nCommerce  and  Industry,  and  agribusinesses.  A  single  contract  will  be  tendered  for  the \nconstruction of all the small-scale facilities. \n \n40. \nThe collection and market facilities will, at minimum, add further value to dried fruits and \nnuts by improving product quality, processing, packaging, and marketing and increase the value \nof fresh fruits and vegetables by improving storage, handling, and marketing.  \n   \n\nc. \n\nProduct Standards Laboratories \n\n \nThe Project will assist the Government in strengthening institutions\u2019 capacity to develop \n41. \nstandards  and  regulations  for  improved  product  quality,  which  will  support  sector  growth  and \nagricultural  trade.  This  will  involve  establishing  certified  laboratories;  strengthening  MAIL\u2019s \ncapacity  regarding  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  policy  and  regulatory  issues;  and  establishing \nproduct standards, particularly as part of MAIL\u2019s role as a member of Codex Alimentarius and in \nvarious agricultural policy aspects of Afghanistan\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization \n(WTO). The specialist technical input required for these activities is included under the project \nmanagement and capacity-support component. \n \n42. \nFresh and dried fruits and nuts for export must be certified by the Raisin and Other Dried \nFruit  Export  Institute  under  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  and  Industries  (MOCI).  This  institute \noperates  three  laboratories,  two  of  which\u2014in  Kabul  and  Kandahar\u2014have  received  equipment \nand some training from development partners. To make these laboratories fully operational, the \nProject will provide targeted support for laboratory system management and technical training, \nas well as equipment for the third laboratory, in Mazar. A key additional piece of equipment, a \nhigh-performance liquid chromatograph, will be supplied to the Kabul laboratory. Support will be \nprovided for international accreditation.  \n \n43.  While regional markets accept these Afghan products according on industry standards, \nthe  current  certificate  is  not  recognized  by  importing  countries,  as  the  laboratories  lack \ninternational  accreditation.  Obtaining  such  accreditation  requires  3  years  of  quality  control  by \nthe  laboratories.  Developing  cost-recovery  systems  will  be  an  important  element  of  laboratory \nsystem  management.  Adopting  improved  product  quality  standards  will  require  raising  the \nawareness of farmers\u2019 groups and trade and industry associations, training them, and providing \nlinkages to the export promotion authority to ensure that they receive the financial benefits that \naccrue from these changes.  \n \n44. \nProject  outcomes  will  be  a  strengthened  regulatory  environment  and  improved  and \neffective sanitary and phytosanitary policies that safeguard the consumer while promoting high-\nquality  products.  Adopting  grades  and  standards,  upgrading  laboratories  that  test  dried  fruits \nand nuts, and generally improving industrial food safety practices will open to dried fruit and nut \nprocessors and exporters more lucrative markets for their certified products.  \n \n\n2.  \n\nEffective Project Management and Capacity Support \n\n \n45. \nA  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  be  established  in  MAIL  in  Kabul,  which  will \nmanage project activities; liaise and coordinate project organization and consultant inputs; and \nundertake  reporting,  procurement,  contract  supervision  and  oversight,  project  monitoring,  and \nimpact  assessment  and  evaluation.  The  PMO  will  be  provided  with  vehicles  and  equipment, \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nstaff,  and  consultants\u2019  inputs  in  contract  technical  oversight,  procurement,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  \n \n46. \nTechnical support for market infrastructure  design; commodity market training linked to \nthe  farm  market  infrastructure  facilities;  and  the  development  of  product  standards,  laboratory \nsystems, and certification is included in this component. It includes the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nFarmer  Market  Infrastructure.  Project  consultants  and  PMO  staff  undertaking \nthe commodity assessment in the seven regions will identify and provide further \nspecification of small-scale infrastructure investment requirements, as well as the \nassociated  postharvest  technology  and  management  and  operational  support \nrequired. They will identify opportunities for cluster approaches. A small training \nfund  will  provide  targeted  skills  enhancement  to  agribusinesses,  traders, \nmarketers, and MAIL staff in the project areas to support the stronger integration, \ndevelopment,  and  adoption  of  improved  market  and  product  management  and \nwaste mitigation and management.  \n\nProduct  Standards  Development.  Technical  consulting  will  be  provided  to \nassist MAIL in establishing product grades and standards in priority commodities. \nMAIL  will  work  with  the  Afghanistan  National  Standards  Authority  to  establish \nnational product standards in line with regional and international standards. The \nProject will support MAIL in designing the proposed laboratories for testing plant \nand animal products. The Project will provide targeted support to MOCI\u2019s Raisin \nand Other Dried Fruit Institute for laboratory system management and technical \ntraining. The consultants will help MAIL to raise awareness and establish working \ngroups with farmers\u2019 groups and trade and industry associations on the improved \nproduct  quality  standards  and  certification  processes.  Support  will  be  provided \nregarding agricultural policy aspects to Afghanistan\u2019s accession to WTO. \n\n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n47. \nThe Project will address key market infrastructure and product regulatory constraints in \ntwo  key  commercial  agriculture  industries:  livestock  and  horticulture. This  will  improve  product \nquality,  productivity,  and  certification  for  export.  The  market  infrastructure  investments  will  be \nundertaken through public-private partnerships involving private entities, farmers\u2019 associations, \nand agricultural cooperatives.  \n \nD. \n\n  \nIndicative Project Investment Plan \n\n48. \nThe indicative project investment cost is $31.0 million, including taxes and duties of $1.9 \nmillion  and  physical  and  price  contingencies  of  $4.4  million.  The  costs  are  summarized  in \nTable 1.

MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  Project  and  responsible  for  overall  project \nmanagement  and  coordination.  MAIL  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  all  project  activities \nexcept  for  the  laboratory  and  training  support  provided  to  the  MOCI\u2019s  Raisin  and  Other  Dried \nFruit Export Institute. A project steering committee (PSC), chaired by the minister of MAIL or his \ndesignate, will be established and provide guidance on policy and strategic issues. It will meet \nquarterly. A special committee will be established by the PSC to be responsible for selecting the \nsmall-scale market subprojects according to agreed criteria. The Project organization chart and \nimplementation structure is in Appendix 7. \n \n51. \nThe  PMO  will  be  based  in  the  private  sector  department  in  MAIL  and  manage  and \ncoordinate  project  activities.  MAIL  will  nominate  a  PMO  project  director  with  the  appropriate \nqualifications and experience, whose appointment will be endorsed by ADB. The project director \nwill be assisted by contracted staff. The PSC will establish a three-person selection panel, which \nmay  include  a  consultant  team  member,  for  recruiting  key  PMO  staff.  Recruitment  will  be \ncompetitive,  through  a  public  advertisement  detailing  the  contracted  staff  positions.  During \nproject  preparation,  a  financial  management  assessment  indicated  that  MOF  and  MAIL  have \nsatisfactory  management  capacity  and  systems  for  financial  and  accounting  management, \nreporting, auditing, and internal controls. While MAIL systems are adequate, the ministry lacks \nexperience  in  implementing  projects  financed  by  international  institutions.  This  shortcoming  of \nMAIL  is  being  addressed  with  technical  capacity  and  consultant  inputs  to  the  PMO  and  the \nprivate sector department of MAIL. \n \n52. \nThe PMO will be responsible for implementing the project in accordance with its design; \neffectively  coordinating  all  activities  and  agencies  involved;  ensuring  project  compliance  with \nenvironmental  requirements  and  other  safeguards;  maintaining  all  appropriate  accounts, \nincluding  reports  on  withdrawal  applications  and  disbursements;  managing  procurement  in \naccordance with  ADB  guidelines; preparing  progress  and  other  reports  in  formats  agreed  with \nADB;  monitoring  all  contracts;  working  closely  with  selected  contracted  service  providers  to \nensure that methodologies, approaches, and management systems are appropriate and deliver \nthe  expected  results;  developing  and  implementing  an  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem; and undertaking necessary public awareness procedures. \n \nThe PMO, with support from the consultants, will prepare and manage the contracts of \n53. \nproject  suppliers.  These  will  include  the  contracts  for  slaughterhouses  and  small-scale \ninfrastructure, consultants, and associated activities to be undertaken with training.  \n \nA MAIL tender committee will be established to review and evaluate project procurement \n54. \nproposals.  The  PMO  will  assist  this  committee  in  preparing  bid  tender  documents  and  be \nresponsible for the bidding process and contract award through international competitive bidding \n(ICB). The bid evaluation will be undertaken by the MAIL tender committee.  \n \n55.  MOCI will designate a staff member in the Raisin and Other Dried Fruit Export Institute \nas the project coordinator for the small MOCI component under the Project. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13 \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n56. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  from  January  2009  to  December  2013. \nThe first year will involve setting up the project management and implementation framework and \nvarious  other  preparatory  tasks,  including  (i)  preparing  work  and  financial  plans;  (ii)  procuring \ngoods  and  services  (consultants  and  other  service  contractors);  (iii)  designing  and  installing  a \nproject  monitoring  and  evaluation  system;  and  (iv)  contracting  for  civil  works  based  on  the \npreparation  of  tender  documents  prior  to  project  effectiveness.  The  project  implementation \nschedule is outlined in Appendix 8. \n \n\n3. \n\nFlow of Funds \n\nThe PMO will be responsible for all project grant funds except those provided by MOF to \n\n57. \nMOCI for laboratory equipment, laboratory technical consulting inputs, and laboratory training.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\nGoods, services, and civil works will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \n58. \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  will  finance  civil  works,  vehicles, \nmaterials,  equipment,  and  training  as  described  in  the  procurement  plan  (Appendix  9).  The \nprocurement  plan  will  be  updated  at  least  annually,  covering  the  next  18  months  of \nprocurement.  Civil  works  costing  over  $1  million  equivalent  will  be  procured  using  ICB.  Civil \nworks  packages  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $1  million  equivalent  will  follow  the  national \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB)  annex  of  the  procurement  plan  (Appendix  9,  Section  3),  which \nsummarizes the necessary modifications or clarifications to the Borrower\u2019s procedures to carry \nout NCB under ADB finance. Contracts for goods and services valued in excess of $0.5 million \nequivalent will be procured through ICB. Contracts for goods and services and training valued at \nless  than  $500,000  equivalent  may  follow  NCB.  Contracts  valued  at  less  than  $100,000 \nequivalent  may  follow  the  shopping  procedure.  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all documents during bidding and project \nimplementation. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n59. \nAdvance  action  is  required  to  establish  the  PMO,  including  the  hiring  of  a  project \ndirector, deputy director for finance, and senior accountant. The Government was informed that \nADB approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to financing the Project. Advance \naction  would  enable  the  early  preparation  of  draft  documents  for  the  contracting  of  services \nrequired under the Project and would require the Government to agree to finance the PMO and \nstaff  before  project  effectiveness.  Once  the  grant  becomes  effective,  up  to  20%  of  grant \nproceeds  may  be  used  to  retroactively  finance  eligible  expenditures  incurred,  pursuant  to \nadvance  contracting,  during  the  period  not  exceeding  12  months  prior  to  the  signing  of  the \nfinancing agreement. \n \n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n60. \nThe  selection  and  engagement  of  consultants  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  Project  will \nprovide  81  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  186  person-months  of \nnational. Consultant firm recruitment will be based on a full technical proposal and quality- and \ncost-based selection weighted 90% technical and 10% price. Consultant inputs are outlined in \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nAppendix  10.  The  main  consultant  firm  contract  will  be  for  technical  and  management \nconsultants.  \n \n61. \nThe Project will engage contract employees to manage and implement the Project. This \nwill  cover  all  PMO  professional  and support  staff.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  provide  strategic \nbusiness process and capacity development for the counterpart department of MAIL, the private \nsector  department,  to  facilitate  implementation  and  skills  transfer  and  enhance  its  capacity  to \ndeliver  services  after  project  completion.  For  these  capacity-development  inputs,  MAIL  will \nengage consultants, as required, to support project-related activities under individual contracts. \nThe PMO will prepare the terms of reference for the proposed input and submit them to ADB for \napproval before starting selection and recruitment. For training, a number of small contracts will \nbe undertaken under shopping and NCB.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n62. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  Executing  Agency.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  grant  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  implementing  agencies  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The \nfinancial  management  capacity  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  Implementing  Agency  has  been \nassessed  as  satisfactory.  MAIL  will  establish  eligibility  criteria  for  people  serving  on  bid \nevaluation committees and require their disclosure of any conflicts of interest. The Government \nwill  undertake  necessary  measures  to  publicly  disclose  project-related  procurement  actions \nsuch  as  information  on  adopted  bidding  procedures;  specification  of  goods,  works,  and \nconsulting services; participating bidders; and contract awards. \n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n63. \nThe  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite  implementation  of  the  Project \nthrough the timely release of funds, an imprest account will be established at a commercial bank \nacceptable  to  ADB  for  exclusive  use  by  the  PMO.  The  imprest  account  will  be  managed, \nreplenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \ndetailed arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited \nin the imprest account will be the estimated expenditure to be funded from it in the first 6 months \nor 10% of the grant amount, whichever is less. ADB statement of expenditure procedures will be \nused  for  contracts  valued  at  $100,000  or  less.  For  consulting  services,  equipment,  and  civil \nworks following ICB procedures, funds will be disbursed using the direct payment method. For \ncontracts  following  NCB  procedures  and  small  expenditures  related  to  PMO  reimbursement, \nimprest fund procedures will be applied. \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n64.  MAIL,  through  the  PMO  and  MOCI\u2018s  Raisin  and  Other  Dried  Fruit  Export  Institute,  will \nprepare and maintain separate accounts for project-related disbursements that are acceptable \nto ADB and in accordance with the provisions of the financing agreement, the recommendations \nof the financial management assessment, and the Guidelines for the Financial Governance and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15 \n\nManagement  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB. 13  The  PMO  will  consolidate  these \naccounts  and  submit  them  to  MAIL,  which  will  review  the  consolidated  accounts  and,  after \nauditing,  submit  them  to  MOF  and  ADB.  MAIL  will  establish  an  audit-review  process  and \ncommission  financial  and  performance  audits  of  the  PMO  by  an  audit  agency  in  accordance \nwith auditing standards acceptable to ADB. The audit report will include a separate opinion on \nthe proper use of the imprest account and the statement of expenditure procedures. MAIL and \nMOCI  project  accounts,  together  with  disbursement  documents,  will  be  audited  annually  by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB and submitted to ADB in English within 6 months of the \nend of each fiscal year. MAIL and MOCI have been advised of ADB\u2019s requirement for the timely \nsubmission  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements  and  the  suspension  of \ndisbursements of the ADB loan in case of noncompliance. \n \n65.  MAIL,  through  the  PMO,  will  submit  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports  to  ADB \nindicating  progress  made,  problems  encountered,  steps  taken  to  remedy  the  problems,  and  a \nprogram of activities, along with expected progress during the remainder of the implementation \nperiod. The MOCI project coordinator will submit a quarterly report on MOCI project activities in \nan agreed format to the PMO. The reports will incorporate project performance monitoring data \nand all relevant financial data and may include such other reports and information relating to the \nProject as ADB may reasonably request. The reports are to be submitted within 1 month after \nthe end of the quarter to which they relate. The annual progress report is to include an annual \nbenefit  monitoring  report.  Within  3  months  of  project  completion,  MAIL  will  submit  a  project \ncompletion  report  to  ADB,  providing  a  detailed  evaluation  of  project  implementation  and \nachievements,  consultants\u2019  performance,  social  and  economic  impacts,  and  other  details  as \nrequested  by  ADB.  The  responsibility  for  preparing  these  reports,  accounts,  and  statements, \nand for ensuring that they are submitted in accordance with the agreed time frame, rests with \nthe project director. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n66. \nTo  monitor  the  Project\u2019s  progress  in  achieving  the  planned  outputs  and  outcome,  the \nPMO will establish within 6 months of loan effectiveness a comprehensive system for monitoring \nand evaluating project performance. A monitoring and evaluation unit will be established in the \nPMO  to  monitor  project  performance,  including  environmental,  poverty,  gender,  and  social \nimpacts,  as  specified  in  the  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  the  poverty, \nsocial, and gender assessment. The monitoring indicators in the project design and monitoring \nframework  (Appendix  1)  will  form  the  core  of  the  data  required  for  assessment.  For  periodic \nmonitoring,  the  PMO  will  confirm  key  indicators  at  project  inception.  The  project  performance \nmonitoring  system  will  be  presented  to  the  PSC  for  verification.  Baseline  data  for  the  agreed \nindicators will be updated every 6 months. Within 12 months of loan effectiveness, the PMO will \nundertake  implementation  of  the  project  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  and  ensure  that  it  is \ncompleted  in  a  timely  manner  over  the  project  period.  The  plan  will  enable  the  effective \ninvolvement of women in implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the Project. Gender-related \nindicators will be included in the system of monitoring and evaluating project performance and \nreported to ADB. \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n67. \nIn the first 3 years of the Project, ADB will carry out semiannual reviews to determine if \nall proposed implementation arrangements\u2014in particular the contractual agreements for market \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2002. Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. \n\nManila. \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\ninfrastructure\u2014are  appropriate  and  in  place  and  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  the  monitoring \nsystems. During the third year of the Project, the Government and ADB will jointly undertake a \ncomprehensive  midterm  review  to  assess  performance;  identify  problems  and  constraints \naffecting  project  implementation,  including changes  in  the  policy  and  institutional  environment; \nassess options; and reach agreement on required changes to address any shortcomings. The \nproject  midterm  review  will  incorporate  any  required  changes  in  scope,  activities,  and \nassociated financial reallocation. The Government will submit a project completion report within \n3 months of the Project\u2019s closing.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nThe \n\ninterventions \n\ninfrastructure \n\nProject Benefits \n\nA. \n \n68. \nThe project impact will be faster agricultural growth, thereby increasing the contribution \nof  the  sector  to  GDP  growth  and  stimulating  the  rural  economy.  The  project  investments  will \nreduce  livestock  and  horticulture  product-processing  and  postharvest  losses,  improve  product \nquality and productivity, and increase returns and sales in export markets. Project investments \nwill increase domestic consumption of selected horticulture and meat products. The major civil \nworks  investment  is  for  the  construction  of  two  slaughterhouses  in  Kabul  and  three  provincial \nones, which will add value to the retail butcher value chain, improve the quality of meat products \nand hide and casing by-products, and have significant community public health benefits.  \n \n69. \nto  address  horticulture  product  quality;  reduce \npostharvest  losses;  and  improve  the  grading,  storage,  and  drying  of  products  will  involve \nstrategic  support  through  small-scale  infrastructure  investments  in  farmers\u2019  associations  and \nother farmers\u2019 groups, which will boost the quality and volume for marketing. These facilities will \nbe the focal point for improved postharvest technology and market support. It is anticipated that \napproximately 200 small-scale interventions will be supported across the seven regional project \nareas. This will mean that at least 8,000 producers will directly participate. This number is very \nconservative, given the larger number of producers linked to such facilities, replication effects, \nand  the  adoption  of  improved  postharvest  practices.  Traders  and  processors  will  benefit  from \naccess  to  larger  quantities  of  better-quality  products,  which  will  enable  improved  grading  and \nproduct marketing to higher-value markets and value-adding activities.   \n \n70. \nImproved  product  quality  and  standards\u2014and  the  strengthening  of  the  enabling \nenvironment  toward  ensuring  that  Afghan  products  can  be  exported  with  valid,  recognized \nproduct  certification  and  standards\u2014will  help  these  products  get  improved  grading  and  prices \nbased on quality and will facilitate access to new, higher-value markets for exports. \n \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nin  Market \n\nInvestment \n\n \n71. \nInfrastructure  Facilities.  The  financial  analysis  of  the \nslaughterhouses is based on a representative modular unit, as a standard size is planned in the \ndifferent  locations.  For  the  farm-level  marketing  facilities,  representative  market  infrastructure \ninvestments  have  been  prepared  for  four  of  the  small-scale  facilities  (commodity  collection, \nsorting,  and  grading  centers;  treatment  facilities;  packinghouses;  and  small  cold  storage  \nfacilities)  to  indicate  the  type  of  investment  and  the  potential  returns  involved.  In  the  models, \nlease  payments  are  made  by  the  enterprises  undertaking  long-term  management,  and  all \nworking  capital  is  sourced  from  the  enterprise.  Based  on  commercial  industry  practice, \nenterprises  would  structure  operations  to  keep  working  capital  needs  feasible,  and  pre-selling \noutput and forward contracting with agents would offer potential to reduce them. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17 \n\nThe slaughterhouse investments are financially viable, offering over 15 years a financial \n72. \ninternal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  before  financing  of  20%  and  a  financial  net  present  value  of \n$520,000  when  discounted  at  the  indicative  commercial  cost  of  capital  of  15%.  The  results  of \nthe financial analysis for the four small-scale market facilities yield FIRRs ranging from 41% to \n68%,  which  indicates  financial  viability.  The  enterprises  with  export  potential  have  the \nopportunity  for  further  increase  returns  over  the  base  case  FIRR,  should  the  traders  increase \nexport  sales  of  improved  products  or  sales  into  new  markets  for  a  portion  of  the  annual \nthroughput  above  the  estimated  level.  The  enterprises  will  generate  other  unquantifiable \nbenefits  in  terms  of  improved  hygiene,  food  safety,  and  environmental  management.  More \ndetails are provided on the financial and economic analysis in Appendix 11 and Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n73. \nThe  economic  analysis  is  based  on  prices  converted  to  their  border  equivalents  by \napplying  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.97  and,  for  consulting  services,  of  0.80.  A  shadow \nwage rate factor of 0.75 has been used in calculating the economic cost of civil works and the \ndirect labor costs in slaughterhouses, reflecting demand for labor in the project area. \n \n74. \nThe  project  economic  return  is  based  on  the  with-project  incremental  economic  return \nfrom  improved  slaughterhouses  in  terms  of  meat  and  by-product  quality,  and  on  commodity \nmarket facilities with reduced commodity losses and improved prices partly reflecting commodity \nquality improvements through better postharvest handling. The economic return is conservative, \nas  it  does  not  include  the  significant  public  health  benefits  from  the  hygienic  slaughter  of \nlivestock in urban areas or the likely incremental returns from agribusiness market investments. \nThe Project is economically viable with an economic internal rate of return of 29.5%.  \n\nB. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\nAn IEE conducted during project preparation confirms that the Project will have positive \n75. \nenvironmental  impacts.  A  summary  of  the  IEE  is  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  The \nproposed Project is classified as category B. In the slaughterhouses, wastewater management \nsystems  will  be  established  as  an  integral  aspect  of  their  design  and  operation,  with  waste \nproducts to meet national and international standards, in line with ADB policy. Such regulations \nhave yet to be established in Afghanistan. \n   \nC. \n\nImpact on Living Standards \n\nliving  standards  by \n\nincreasing  employment  opportunities \n\nSocioeconomic  analysis  based  on  a  social  assessment  indicates  that  the  Project  will \n76. \nimprove  rural \nin  expanding \nagribusinesses  for  semiskilled  and  skilled  workers,  as  well  as  by  providing  benefits  at  the \nproduction  level  through  the  adoption  of  improved  harvest  and  postharvest  practices  and \ntechnologies that will improve productivity, quality, and market returns. These interventions will \nhave a major social impact and reduce poverty.   \n \nIn the targeted commodity chains of the Project, the interventions will improve marketing \n77. \ninfrastructure  and  the  operation  of  these  facilities  by  farmers\u2019  and  industry  associations. \nStrengthened  supply  lines  will  facilitate  expansion  and  the  establishment  of  new  trading  and \nprocessing  businesses.  The  proposed  project  interventions  will  help  existing  small-scale  and \ncottage  enterprises  through  replication  and  the  adoption  of  improved  practices.  The  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n1. \n\nGender and Development  \n\n78.  Women are already heavily involved in agricultural production and processing and, to a \nlesser  extent,  in  trading  agricultural  produce.  The  Project\u2019s  strengthening  of  commodity  value \nchains  from  the  postharvest  stage  will  create  an  opportunity  to  support  women\u2019s  producer \nassociations interested in improving the quality of their produce, thereby enabling rural women \nto benefit. Women will benefit as employees in agribusinesses, entrepreneurs, and members of \nwomen\u2019s groups involved in production or supply. \n \n79. \nAlthough reliable gender-disaggregated data is lacking, Afghanistan\u2019s gender indicators \nare  very  poor,  as  indicated  by  gender  gaps  in  health,  education,  access  to  and  control  over \nresources,  economic  opportunities,  justice,  and  political  participation.  Women  are  important \neconomic  actors,  but  there  is  limited  data  on  their  contribution  and  the  role  they  play.  While \nAfghanistan\u2019s constitution enshrines women\u2019s equality, progress toward this ideal will take time, \ngiven prevailing cultural, social, and religious sensitivities.  \n \nA  project-specific  GAP  has  been  developed  and  will  be  revised  during  project \n80. \nimplementation.  A  summarized  version  is  in  Appendix  13.  The  project  GAP  will  ensure  that  a \ncertain percentage of the stakeholders participating in project planning are women, as will be a \ncertain  percentage  of  the  management  staff  of  the  Project  and  supporting  institutions \nresponsible  for  implementing  the  Project,  and  that  women-headed  households,  associations, \nand businesses participate. The different groups will require different strategies and activities to \nget their involvement. A gender assessment will be conducted during monitoring and evaluation.  \n\n2. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n81. \nProject  and  construction  activities  will  be  undertaken  on  existing  Government  land  in \nKabul and the provinces. No land acquisition or resettlement will be necessary for the planned \nphysical infrastructure under the Project, as slaughterhouses and small buildings will be built on \nGovernment land. \n\n3. \n\nProject Impact on Indigenous Peoples \n\nAfghanistan  has  several  ethnic  groups,  but  they  participate  equally  in  national \n82. \nsocioeconomic  processes.  No  vulnerable  groups  identifiable  under  the  indigenous  people \ndefinition of ADB\u2019s indigenous people\u2019s policy will be affected by the Project. \n\nD. \n\nRisk Assessment \n\n83. \nSecurity  remains  the  single  greatest  risk  affecting  private  business  investment  and \nproject  implementation.  Changes  in  the  security  environment  may  affect  proposed  project \nactivities  in  certain  regions,  implementation  duration,  and  the  ability  of  project  staff  and \nconsultants to effectively undertake planned interventions. If increased security is required, it will \nhave  cost  implications  and  affect  the  quality  of  the  consultants  prepared  to  participate  in  the \nProject. The Project will be flexible regarding geographic areas in case the security environment \nwill  not  allow  implementation.  The  Government  will  assist  with  any  required  security  support. \nProducer  and  business  investment  and  financial  sector  activity  will  be  affected  by  these \nchanges.  \n  \nThe Government is committed to the Project and to key policy reforms. This is required \n84. \nby the Project to improve product standards and product certification. Institutional capacity is a \nconstraint,  and  the  Project  will  provide  strategic  capacity  building  in  the  private  sector \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19 \n\ndepartment of MAIL and consultant support to MAIL for project management and procurement. \nThe  Government\u2019s  adoption  of  the  planned  public  administration  reforms  is  required.  Project \ninvestments  will  support  business  development  and  result  in  a  stronger  private  agribusiness \nsector. These networks and marketing channels have the ability to operate should the security \nenvironment change.  \n\n \n85. \nThe  project  market  infrastructure  will  make  a  big  difference  to  producers  and \nbusinesses.  It  will  facilitate  business  development  and  the  building  of  a  stronger  private \nagribusiness  sector.  One  risk  is  the  maintenance  and  repair  of  the  facilities,  particularly  the \nhorticulture facilities. Careful management and supervision by the private companies operating \nthe slaughterhouses, and their eventual ownership of the assets, will mitigate most of the risk. \nFor  the  farmer  associations  and  cooperatives  operating  the  small-scale  horticulture  facilities, \ncareful management and supervision will mitigate some of this risk. While management support \nwill  be  provided  by  the  Project  to  build  their  capacity,  the  magnitude  of  the  risk  should  not  be \nunderestimated. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nThe  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  have  been  agreed \n\n86. \nwith the Government and will be incorporated in the legal documents:  \n\n (i)  Within  6  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  MAIL  will  put  in  place  appropriate  and \nadequate  financial  control  and  accounting  systems,  so  that  PMO  can  apply \ninternational accounting standards during project implementation. \n\n(ii)  With respect to the slaughterhouses and the market infrastructure facilities, MAIL \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nwill follow the selection criteria and approval procedures set forth. \nMAIL will ensure that the terms and conditions for the transfer of ownership of the \nslaughterhouse facilities to the relevant private sector entities are agreed upon in \nadvance with ADB, and that such transfer takes place in a timely manner on such \nterms and conditions. \nPrior  to  commencement  of  any  evaluation  of  bids  and  within  1  month  of  grant \neffectiveness, MAIL will have established eligibility criteria acceptable to ADB for \npersons  serving  on  the  bid  tender  committee,  including  but  not  limited  to \ndisclosure  by  such  persons  of  any  conflicts  of  interest.

With agriculture accounting for half of the \ncountry\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), developing commercial agriculture and building on the \ntraditional  commodity  value  chains  in  which  Afghanistan  has  a  comparative  advantage  will \nsupport  economic  growth  and  provide  legal  alternatives  to  opium  poppy  production.  The  rural \neconomy  is  the  major  source  of  employment  and  income  for  most  Afghans,  as  nearly  80%  of \nthe population, or 19 million people, live in impoverished rural areas. Rural economic growth\u2014in \nagricultural  production,  diversification,  and  value  addition\u2014is  essential  for  any  sustained \nimprovement  in  livelihoods.  In  2005/2006,  a  year  affected  by  drought,  agriculture\u2014including \ncereal  crops,  horticulture,  and  livestock  but  excluding  opium\u2014was  the  largest  legal  domestic \nsource of income, accounting for approximately 37% of the GDP.  \n \n2. \nWhile  wheat  is  the  major  agriculture  output,  accounting  for  over  two  thirds  of  the \ncultivated area and for 80% of the cereal area, it is typically a subsistence crop. About 40% of \ncereal  area  is  rain  fed,  and  60%  receives  some  irrigation.  Afghan  commercial  agriculture  has \ntraditionally  produced  significantly  high-value  horticultural  and  livestock  products  for  domestic \nand  export  markets.  It  had  a  comparative  advantage  in  these  commodities.  In  the  late  1970s, \nAfghanistan  supplied  20%  of  the  global  market  for  raisins,  dominated  the  world  pistachio \nmarket, and regionally exported livestock and wool products. During the long period of conflict \nand severe drought in the late 1990s, the production base for these commodities was severely \ndamaged. Combined with the loss of irrigation infrastructure and technical and market support, \nthis  reduced  the  productivity  of  most  agricultural  commodities  and  created  high  postharvest \nlosses of 30%\u201340%.  \n \n3. \nSince  2001,  a  number  of  projects  have  supported  reestablishing  the  horticulture  and \nlivestock  subsector  with  large  investments  in  irrigation  rehabilitation  and  technical,  production, \nand  some  market  support.  Livestock  numbers  have  increased,  and  horticulture  area  and \nproduction is expanding, with new plantings estimated at 12,000 hectares (ha) per year. These \ncommercial  agricultural  activities  will  further  grow  with  improved  access  to  irrigation  following \nrecent investments in irrigation projects. In 2006, exports of fruit were $70 million and of dried \nfruits  and  nuts  $110  million.  Livestock  product  exports  are  also  expanding.  In  2007,  the \nestimated value added by small and mechanized agribusinesses was over $500 million. \n \n4. \nlivestock \nslaughtering is now undertaken in urban backyards and streets and in rural areas, which harms \nproduct  quality  and  endangers  public  health.  Approximately  240,000  cattle  and  buffalo  are \nslaughtered per year in Kabul, out of the total 1 million slaughtered in the country, and 1 million \nsheep and goats are slaughtered annually in Kabul, out of the country kill of 5 million. \n \nThe  potential  to  expand  commercial  agriculture  in  terms  of  volume,  quality,  and  value \n5. \nadded,  starting  at  the  production  base,  exists  in  the  markets  in  which  Afghanistan  has  a \ncomparative  advantage  for  domestic  production  and  import  substitution,  as  well  as  in  the \nexpansion  of  exports.  While  existing  projects  have  focused  on  the  production  base  in \nhorticulture and livestock in some regional areas, a key priority is to complement these activities \nwith a focus on strengthening postharvest standards and commercial agriculture development. \n \n\nSlaughterhouses  were  destroyed  during \n\nthe  conflict,  and  almost  all \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\nThe  informal  sector  dominates  in  agriculture,  as  in  the  broader  economy.  Addressing \n6. \nconstraints  that  limit  movement  from  the  informal  to  the  formal  economy  is  critical  in  an \nenvironment  of  weak  regulatory  processes,  poor  infrastructure,  limited  access  to  finance,  and \nsecurity  issues.  This  shift  will  be  essential  if  the  economy  is  to  generate  sustainable  medium-\nterm growth and increase employment, productivity, and government revenue.  \n \n7. \nAfghan  agribusinesses  and  enterprises\u2014covering  production,  processing,  distribution, \nmarketing,  manufacturing,  and  services\u2014provide  some  level  of  mechanization  and  scale  in \nprocessing raisins, nut shelling, sorting and packing, drying vegetables, ginning cotton, cleaning \ngrain seed, and milling wheat. For the remaining commodities, agribusiness enterprises in fresh \nfruit  sorting  and  packing;  dried  fruit  processing;  dairy;  wool  spinning;  carpet  weaving,  cutting, \nand  washing;  butchering;  and  hide  and  skin  tanning  have  tended  to  operate  as  cottage \nindustries  using  traditional  technologies  and  producing  products  of  lower  quality  and  price.  In \nterms of export commodities, quality and traceability issues constrain access and growth.    \n \n8. \nWhile there has been the establishment and growth of agribusinesses, the existing ones \ngenerally use low technology and add little value. There is significant potential for existing small \nagribusinesses to expand to meet growing domestic demand for value-added products and into \nexport markets. Such development and expansion is constrained by limited market access, poor \nquality  and  volume  of  production,  high  investment  risk,  a  weak  enabling  environment,  limited \naccess  to  finance  for  lack  of  financial  sector  coverage  and  capacity  to  invest,  ineffectual \ntechnical  and  management  support  services,  and  limited  access  to  market  information  and \npublic\u2013private  support  services.  Interventions  to  mitigate  these  constraints  will  bring  higher \nprices and returns for agribusinesses and the rural economy. \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe  Government  agricultural  sector  master  plan  details  opportunities  for  growth  and \nvalue addition in the core horticulture and livestock subsector and the need to develop a market-\nbased regulatory environment with access to inputs, services, and markets. MAIL is establishing \nthe regulatory environment and building its capacity to undertake the required certification and \nproduct  quality  assessment.  It  has  removed  previous  barriers  to  private  enterprise.  The  ADB \ncountry strategy and program1 sector road map supports the Government agenda. \n \n10. \nThe weak institutional and enabling regulatory environment, which lacks legislation in the \nform of a leasing and secure transactions law, regulations, product standards, quality assurance \nsystems, or a trade policy, is an issue. The provision of public and private support services from \nthe relevant government ministries, chambers of commerce and industry, business development \nand \nlimits \nagribusinesses\u2019 access to improved technologies and vital business planning and management \nskills and their ability to improve product quality and organize themselves in more competitive, \nintegrated industries.   \n \nC. \n \n11. \nTraditional horticulture crops of dried fruits and nuts and fresh fruits and vegetables have \nplayed  a  dominant  role  in  Afghanistan\u2019s  exports,  accounting  in  1979  for  approximately  $230 \nmillion  in  exports.  The  horticulture  area  has  expanded  since  2001  and,  in  2005,  totaled \napproximately 122,000 ha.

This,  combined  with  improved  irrigation,  will  bring  rapid  expansion  in  production  volume \nand  of  the  opportunity  and  need  to  support  commercial  market  development  and  quality \nproduction.   \n \n12. \nDomestic  demand  for  fresh  fruits  and  vegetables  and  key  commodities  is  strong,  as  is \nexport demand. In 2006, the value of exports was $70 million for fresh fruits and $111 million for \ndried fruits and nuts. Experts have estimated that, if productivity and quality can be improved, \nthe sector can contribute $1.5 billion in exports in 10 years.2 The Government\u2019s lower target is \n$250 million by 2015. Achieving these outcomes will require improved harvest and postharvest \npractices;  infrastructure  investment  in  storage,  packing  and  cold  storage,  processing,  and \nproduct quality; improved planting material; and better access to technology and management \nservices.  The  small-scale  farmers  that  dominate  production  will  benefit  from  establishing  and \nstrengthening farmers\u2019 groups which will improve market opportunities. \n \nAlmond  Value  Chain.  Exports  of  almonds  in  2005  were  11,000  tons,  out  of  total \n13. \nproduction of 39,000 tons from an area of 12,000 ha. Market demand is increasing domestically, \nin  traditional  importing  countries  such  as  India  and  Pakistan,  and  in  new  markets.  India  is  the \nkey buyer of soft-shelled almonds and the highest-quality kernels. Pakistani demand is more for \nthe  second-quality  kernels  for  their  confectionary  industry.  Smaller  markets  are  in  the  Middle \nEast.  Traders  indicate  that  2%  of  almonds  of  the  hard-shelled  varieties  are  bitter,  which  is  an \nissue in international markets but to date has not affected the Indian market. \n \nAlmond  trading  centers  in  Kabul,  Kandahar,  Kunduz,  and  Mazar  are  also  used  for \n14. \ntrading  other  types  of  nuts  and  dried  fruit,  as  well  as  for  export.  Kabul  is  the  major  trading \nmarketplace, and traders indicate that they export almonds in a ratio of two to one in shells and \nas kernels. Farmers sell through traditional market systems to local markets and field agents for \ntraders  without  doing  much  if  any  grading  and  sorting.  Key  issues  are  bitter  taste,  immature \nkernels,  and  high  moisture  content.  Generally,  traders  are  interested  in  buying  almonds  from \ndistrict traders or farmers, repackaging, and shipping. By so doing, they add little value.   \n \nLimited  processing  is  currently  undertaken.  Three  almond-cracking  plants  have  been \n15. \nacquired but are not operational or are being modified for local conditions such as variable size \nbefore coming into production. As their stated capacity is 600 tons per year, even when these \nthree plants are in operation, there will still be a lot of unmet demand. It would take a further 16 \nsuch  plants  to  shell  30%  of  production.  The  Dried  Fruit  Processing  Association  in  Mazar  has \ntaken delivery of a processing plant to add value by mechanically shelling and manually sorting \nthe  nuts.  The  association  intends  to  hire  in  management  and  marketing  expertise  to  run  the \nbusiness in their new factory. A plant has also been acquired in Kandahar. \n \n16. \nThe lack of grading and sorting machinery constrains the industry from achieving better \nefficiency,  maintaining  hygienic  standards,  or  reaching  the  product  quality  required  in  export \nmarkets  where  product  certification  is  necessary.  Links  between  producer  associations  and \ntrader  associations  needs  to  be  strengthened  so  that  traders  can  provide  better  market \nfeedback  to  growers  in  terms  of  quality.  Growers  also  need  quality  inputs  and  improved \ntechnology.  Packing  systems  need  to  be  improved,  to  reduce  damage  during  transport  to \nmarket. Existing testing laboratories are limited, and the certification they provide does not carry \ninternational credibility. Forming and strengthening producer associations would be one way for \n\n                                                 \n2  The OTF Group. 2006.

USAID.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nproducers  to  improve  product  volume  and  quality  and  provide  direct  market  opportunities  with \ntraders.  \n \n17. \nPistachio Value Chain. Until the 1980s, wild pistachios were a major agricultural export. \nPistachios  were  harvested  from  natural  pistachio  forests  located  mostly  in  the  Herat  region, \nwhich operated under government- and community-based management systems. These forests \nwere damaged during the conflict, with more than half of the trees estimated to have been lost. \nIn 2005, the harvest was estimated at 23,000 tons, which had an in-shell value of $12 million. \n \n18. \nAfghanistan  has  comparative  advantages  in  pistachio  production  and  a  product \npreferred in India. The potential for pistachio production in Afghanistan is enormous, with world \ndemand increasing faster than supply. Iran alone supplies more than 66% of world demand, but \nproduction  conditions  are  declining  due  to  salinity  and  irrigation  problems.  The  current  lack  of \nmanagement of these forests is resulting in early harvesting of pistachios by households, which \nreduces yield, and the product is sold as a whole nut to traders, wholesalers, or directly to large \ntrading houses in Herat. The traders have the nuts shelled by households, sorted, graded, and \npacked  for  export  to  India,  Pakistan,  and  the  Middle  East.  Scope  exists  to  mechanize \nprocessing similar to that for almonds. \n \n19. \nRaisin Value Chain. Raisins are one the largest and most important horticultural crop in \nAfghanistan, where they are a by-product of fresh grape production. This is in contrast to raisin \nproduction  in  developed  countries,  especially  in  dominant  California,  where  fresh  grapes  and \nraisins  are  two  different  crops  with  very  different  production  and  marketing  strategies.  While \ngrapes  are  grown  in  almost  all  regions  of  Afghanistan,  certain  areas  such  as  the  southern \nprovinces  and  Ghazni  have  reputations  for  producing  better-quality  products,  and  the  regional \nvarieties shindukhani, geerduk, and taifee are in demand in certain export markets. During the \n1960s and 1970s, raisin exports from Afghanistan supplied 60% of the world market.  \n \nDomestic  and  export  demand  has  increased,  and  the  various  raisin  products  have \n20. \ndifferent destinations. Kishmish, the green raisin dried in the shade, is a more valuable product \nthan aftabi, which is the sun-dried black or red raisin. Kishmish is sold almost entirely in India \nand  Pakistan.  Aftabi  is  also  sold  in  South  Asia,  but  its  main  markets  are  in  Europe  and  the \nformer Soviet Union. The harvest and sale of the fresh grapes removes about 30%\u201340% of the \ncrop from the orchard, and the harvest and hanging of the other grapes for kishmish production \nremoves a similar portion. Thus about 20%\u201330% of the crop remains\u2014the poorest quality\u2014and \nthis is the fruit from which the sun-dried aftabi raisin is prepared. These grapes are dried on any \navailable  surface  with  minimum  inputs  and  are  not  generally  of  good  quality.  The  drying \ntechnique  almost  guarantees  that  they  will  not  compete  with  the  higher-quality  Californian  or \ncomparable sun-dried raisins. They require double washing and careful hand sorting to render \nthem acceptable for a discriminating developed market. \n \n21. \nRaisin  producers  either  sell  at  harvest  at  low  prices  or  store  the  crop  for  later  sale. \nProducers most commonly sell at local markets in 50\u2013100 kilogram consignments to traders, but \nsome  sell  to  field  agents  at  the  farm  gate  or  to  wholesale  markets,  if  such  outlets  are  close. \nLocal markets operate with small consignments, but when purchasers want large volumes the \nprice can be volatile. As selling is done by individual producers, their bargaining power is low, \nand  the  industry  fails  to  expand  as  it  is  difficult  for  traders  to  acquire  large  volumes. \nStrengthening farmers\u2019 associations would enable producers to improve postharvest practices, \ncollect larger volumes, and negotiate contracts with buyers that would lower marketing costs. \n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nFresh  Grape  Value  Chain.  Grape  area  is  expanding.  In  2005,  an  area  of  58,000  ha \n\nTraders and exporters undertake limited grading, sorting, packing, and processing prior \n22. \nto  sale.  There  is  relatively  little  processing  of  green  kishmish,  which  cannot  easily  be  washed \nwithout  damaging  the  quality.  In  the  wholesale  markets,  the  product  is  usually  sorted  into \ndifferent  quality  grades  based  on  shape,  size,  and  color.  Aftabi  for  export  undergo  factory \nprocessing, but only for certain markets. Raisins that are exported to Dubai or Pakistan often do \nnot undergo factory processing in Afghanistan, as they are often double washed in factories at \ntheir destination. While there used to be at least 31 raisin-processing factories in Afghanistan, \nfew of these survived the conflict. Approximately 13 processing plants currently operate, using \nAmerican processing lines that are over 30 years old. After the mechanical processing, manual \nsorting occurs. The raisins are then boxed for export. The quality of the processing and packing \nis  generally  poor.  Consignments  for  European  and  increasingly  Russian  markets  are  often \ndouble  washed,  processed,  and  manually  sorted  to  make  sure  all  capstems  are  removed. \nLengthy  transit  times  from  Afghanistan  to  the  port  of  Karachi  and  delays  damage  the  product \nand worsen losses. \n \n23. \nproduced 400,000 tons, making grape the largest horticultural product in Afghanistan. \n \n24. \nLocal  Marketing  of  Fresh  Grapes.  The  producer  decides  the  allocation  of  the  crop \nbetween fresh grape and shade-dried kishmish based on price differentials, provided that he or \nshe  owns  a  kishmish  khana  in  which  grapes  can  be  shade-dried.  The  remainder  will  be  sun-\ndried raisins. Most grape growers currently use contractors to harvest fresh grapes, though they \nthemselves harvest and process the grapes they keep for raisin production. Fresh fruit demands \nimmediate  marketing  within  a  week  of  harvesting,  and  farmers  currently  rely  on  traders  for \npacking  and  market  connections.  The  farmer  will  agree  to  sell  about  30%\u201340%  of  his  or  her \ncrop  fresh  to  the  harvesting  contractor.  Payment  to  the  producer  is  split,  with  30%  of  the \nestimated value of the crop paid at the time of the deal, another 30% paid halfway through the \nharvest,  and  the  final  40%  paid  at  the  end  of  the  harvest.  It  is  common  for  the  contractor  to \ndelay  payment;  misrepresent  the  weight  of  the  grapes  harvested;  attempt  to  renegotiate  the \ndeal  halfway  through,  claiming  bad  market  conditions;  or  simply  not  pay  for  a  portion  of  the \ngrapes harvested. Few growers see these arrangements as ideal, but options are limited unless \nfarmers\u2019 groups develop to strengthen their marketing position.  \n \n25. \nExports to Pakistan are mostly through wholesale market auctions, but some negotiated \nsales  go  directly  through  commission  agents  to  retailers.  In  India,  traders  and  exporters  seek \npriced  contracts,  including  cost  insurance  and  freight,  with  importers  or,  as  currently  is  being \npiloted, contract sale to supermarket chains in India. With few cold chains in operation, the sale \nneeds  to  occur  quickly.  Small  volumes  are  currently  exported  using  cold  chains.  A  limited \nnumber  of  farmer  marketing  associations  and  cooperatives  exist,  and  growers  need  a  real \nincentive in the form of increased returns to use value-increasing horticultural techniques, such \nas girdling, bunch-thinning, or crop thinning, to improve quality.  \n \n26. \nKey issues affecting value chain performance stem from production, with producers not \ndifferentiating between fresh grapes and raisins; producers generally having limited knowledge \nof  the  quality  requirements  of  the  market,  which  affects  picking,  sorting,  and  packing;  water \nscarcities  affecting  production;  access  to  and  the  adoption  of  new  technologies  and  improved \nvarieties constrained; and postharvest handling poor, with very limited access to cold storage or \nshipping freshly harvested grapes. \n \n27. \nPomegranate Value Chain. Afghanistan is a traditional cultivator of pomegranates and \nis known for the excellent quality of its native varieties, in particular in Balkh, Kandahar, Kapisa, \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\nand Samangan provinces. Estimates in 2007 indicated the area under pomegranate orchards at \n5,700  ha,  producing  99,000  tons  of  fruit.  The  value  of  the  output  of  these  orchards  was  $30 \nmillion,  equal  to  that  of  apricots.  Iran  is  currently  the  leading  world  producer,  at  670,000  tons. \nWith  regional  and  international  demand  increasing,  prices  have  risen.  There  is  scope  for \nsignificant  expansion  in  domestic  consumption,  exports,  and  returns  once  constraints  are \novercome.  Improved  technology  and  postharvest  handling  and  the  use  of  refrigeration  for \ntransport  on  the  ground  and  by  air  will  improve  quality  and  returns  and  enable  expansion \nbeyond existing markets. \n \n28. \nApricot  Value  Chain.  Afghanistan  has  a  long  history  of  producing  and  exporting \napricots,  both  fresh  and  dried.  In  2005,  the  production  of  fresh  apricots  was  estimated  at \n100,000  tons,  and  of  dried  apricots  66,000  tons.  Since  2001,  area  and  production  have \nincreased,  and  domestic  consumption  and  exports  are  again  expanding.  Pakistan  is  the  main \ntrading  partner  for  stone  fruits  (including  apricots  in  the  Peshawar  market),  watermelons,  and \napples. Afghanistan exports dried fruits through the Central Asian republics, Iran, and Pakistan \nto  markets in  India,  the Middle  East,  and  the  Russian  Federation.  Limited  access  to  improved \ntechnology and inputs, low productivity, poor harvest and postharvest management, the lack of \ncertification, and limited refrigerated transport by road or air depress product quality and price \nand market expansion. Market channels are similar to those of other horticultural commodities.  \n \nApple  Value  Chain.  Apple  production  is  expanding.  In  2005  it  was  approximately \n29. \n570,000  tons,  focused  on  meeting  domestic  demand.  Competition  in  the  market  from  fruits \nimported from Iran and Pakistan provides an opportunity for import substitution. Estimates are \nthat  10,000  tons  were  exported  to  Pakistan.  The  challenges  for  the  value  chain  are  similar  to \nthose  for  apricots,  except  that  the  target  market  is  domestic.  Key  issues  are  low  productivity, \nhigh  harvest  and  postharvest  losses  of  40%,  poor  packing  and  grading,  and  the  lack  of  cold \nstorage. \n \nD. \n \n30. \nLivestock  plays  a  part  in  all  farming  systems  of  Afghanistan,  where  agricultural  and \npasture  areas  account for  45%  of  land  area.  Livestock  numbers  fell  dramatically  from  the  late \n1970s to the late 1990s because of war, prolonged drought, and the collapse of veterinary care \nand  services.  This  decline  in  livestock  numbers  has  left  Afghanistan  short  of  milk,  red  meat, \nchicken  meat,  eggs,  and  wool,  fueling  the  substantial  import  of  live  animals  and  products  of \nanimal origin. Most inedible products are exported after first-stage processing\u2014such as salting \nand washing skins, hides and intestines and dehairing for cashmere\u2014or without any processing \nat all. Current agribusiness added value to Afghan livestock products is very limited. There are a \nfew  wool-spinning  factories,  but  most  processing  of  products  of  animal  origin  is  still  a  cottage \nindustry.  \n \n31. \nOfficial  livestock  numbers  are  indicative  only  (FAO  2003  census),  with  estimates  for \ncattle at 4 million, sheep 9 million (half of the census number in the 1980s to early 1990s, which \nwas 19 million), goats 7.3 million, and poultry 12 million.3 These are considered underestimates, \nas  the  livestock  of  nomadic  kuchis  was  largely  not  included.  Over  time,  with  improved  rainfall \nand fodder production, and with further development in animal production and veterinary service \ndelivery  systems,  the  livestock  population  is  expected  to  rise.  It  is  estimated  that  this \ndevelopment will take 10 years for small ruminants and 20 years for large ones.

Afghanistan National Livestock Census. Rome. \n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nborder, veterinary, and sanitary inspection services are not able to keep track of the movement \nof livestock imports or of their quality or health status.  \n \n32. \nInterventions  to  address  constraints  in  the  livestock  value  chain  should  (i)  increase \nlivestock  production  that  is  competitive  with  imports  and  improve  the  quality  of  livestock \nproducts  through  compliance  with  food  safety  requirements;  (ii)  remove  bottlenecks  for \ndeveloping  livestock  agribusiness  so  that  livestock  agribusinesses  in  Pakistan  return  to \nAfghanistan  and  add  more  value  to  products  locally;  (iii)  build  up  supply  channels  and/or  a \nproduction  base  for  such  necessary  inputs  as  stock  feeds,  parent  stock,  hatchlings,  and \nvaccines; and (iv) set up milk-collection centers, dairy plants for processing local milk, improved \nlivestock  markets,  slaughterhouses,  tanneries,  and  casing-preparation  plants  with  European \nUnion licenses for aggregation and processing.  \n \n33. \nRed Meat Value Chain. The red meat value chain includes cattle, buffaloes, goats, and \nsheep.  All  major  cities  are  supplied  with  live  animals  from  the  rural  areas  and  imports  from \nPakistan. Estimates are that at least 90,000 buffaloes are slaughtered per year in Kabul (based \non  averaging  butchers\u2019  association  and  skin  and  hides\u2019  association  estimates)  and  180,000 \nbuffaloes  are  slaughtered  in  the  whole  country.  The  total  number  of  cattle  slaughtered  is \nestimated  at  800,000  for  the  whole  country  (approximately  40%  local)  and  150,000  for  Kabul \ncity.  About  1  million  small  ruminants  are  slaughtered  in  the  Kabul  market,  and  5  million  are \nslaughtered in the whole country. \n \n34. \nLivestock  Marketing.    Basic livestock markets exist in all major towns. In Kabul there \nare four markets, two large ones for butchers and other wholesalers and two smaller markets for \nretail to consumers. Livestock traders are organized in associations and have committees with a \ndirector working as a broker between butchers and traders. The common practice is that most \ntraders take the animals from the villages with payment made after the sale of the livestock. Of \nthe total number of animals sold on the market, at least 60% are sold on credit to butchers, with \nthe butcher having a maximum of 7 days to pay. \n \n35. \nSlaughterhouses. The only proper slaughterhouse in Kabul is owned by the Ministry of \nDefense, with small-scale and basic slabs-type slaughtering facilities being built or considered in \nGhazni,  Jalalabad,  and  Kunduz.  The  situation  in  respect  to  slaughtering  in  Kabul  and  other \ncities  is  poor  for  the  quality  of  the  meat  and  the  by-products  and  for  protecting  public  health. \nAnimals are slaughtered near livestock markets in backyards, and carcasses are transported in \nand the open, exposed to the elements. As there is no provision for hanging carcasses, often \nrequiring  that  skinning  take  place  on  the  ground,  skins  often  suffer  more  damage  than  they \nwould if they were hung.  \n \n36. \nHides,  Skins,  and  Casings.  Hides  and  skins  have  always  been  important  exports  for \nAfghanistan.  Most  hides  and  skins  are  collected,  salted,  and  exported  to  Pakistan  for  further \nprocessing. However, there has been little or no investment in maintaining the hides and skins \nin  the  process,  and  only  a  few  companies  with  limited  capacity  add  value  to  them.  The  four \nmajor hide and skin collection centers in Kabul are situated in the center of town, posing health \nand environmental threats. Casings, or intestines, from sheep and goats are collected by trader \nassociations and exported to Pakistan, where they are further cleaned, graded, processed, and \nexported. The Western European market is particularly important for casings, which must meet \nstringent European Union standards.  \n \n37.  Wool and Carpet Value Chain. Ghazni wool, from white, fat-tail sheep around Ghazni, \nis important for the carpet industry. The wool fetches a premium price because of its excellence \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n33 \n\nas  carpet  wool.  Wool  traders  situated  in  different  towns  are  usually  small-scale  entrepreneurs \nusing  limited  working  capital  to  purchase  and  store  wool.  They  typically  purchase  between  5 \nand  10  tons  of  wool,  which  is  contracted  to  local  women  to  spin.  Pakistani  and  Afghan  wool \ntraders  in  Pakistan  compete  for  this  wool,  which  is  spun  in  Pakistan.  Afghanistan\u2019s  wool \nrequirements can be only partly satisfied with local wool. Wool traders estimate that only 40% of \nall wool used is local, with the rest imported from Iran, Iraq, New Zealand, and Saudi Arabia.  \n \n38. \nCarpets.  While  Afghan  carpets  are  the  largest  export  product  from  Afghanistan,  it  is \ndifficult to get an accurate estimate of the scale of carpet production in Afghanistan. The Export \nPromotion Agency of Afghanistan estimates production to be about 2 million carpets annually. \nAs the average carpet measures 3.2 square meters, this equates to 6.4 million square meters of \ncarpet. Industry estimates indicate that this would be a conservative figure. Afghan carpets are \nin demand internationally, and the industry needs to maintain and improve quality and promote \nthem  in  export  markets  to  strengthen  Afghan  branding.  Currently  80%  to  95%  of  carpets  are \nfinished  in  Pakistan  and  re-exported  as  Pakistani  carpets.  Official  estimates  are  that  $176 \nmillion  worth  of  carpets  were  exported  through  formal  channels  in  2006.  Considering  industry \nestimates  of  production  and  informal  trade,  the  value  of  exported  carpets  is  likely  double  the \nofficial figure. \n \n39. \nThe carpet value chain is based around four main centers: Andkhoy, Herat, Kabul, and \nMazar.  The  carpet  companies  and  associations  of  which  they  are  members  operate  by \nproviding  such  inputs  as  wool,  designs,  advance  payment,  and  looms  for  rent  and  sale  to \nhousehold  weavers.  Or,  in  some  cases,  the  companies  provide  only  the  design,  and  the \nweavers  provide  other  inputs.  When  carpets  are  finished  and  graded,  payment  is  made.  The \nindustry is based on weavers, mostly women, working at home. Clusters of production exist in \nmany parts of the country. Pakistan is closely involved in the production of carpets, including the \nprovision of capital and designs and washing and cutting before export to Europe or the United \nStates. Opportunities exist to add more value in Afghanistan, but this will require access to such \ninputs as wool, finance, quality chemicals, and cutting and washing facilities. A new cutting and \nwashing  facility  is  currently  planned  in  Jalalabad.  Facilitating  this  value  addition  will  require \nimproved  raw  material  and  wool  treatment;  training  for  weavers;  more  secure  transport;  and \naccess to international markets, finance, and other inputs.  \n \n40. \nCashmere.  As  Afghanistan  has  8  million  goats,  cashmere  is  a  resource  to  be \ndeveloped.  Traditional  cashmere  collection  and  processing  was  and  still  is  common  in \nBadakhshan  and  Hazarajat,  though  producers  operated  during  the  conflict  with  a  domestic \nfocus. Improved harvesting and processing techniques need to be adopted. The main center for \nthe cashmere trade in Afghanistan is Herat, with export via Iran to either the People\u2019s Republic \nof China or Europe.  \n \nDairy.  Afghanistan  is  a  large  net  importer  of  milk  powder  and  other dairy  products.  As \n41. \nthere are an estimated 4 million local cows, milk is already used as feed for calves, for family \nconsumption, and, to a limited extent, for sale in processed form. A significant increase in milk \nproduction through increased productivity and increased numbers of cows would be required for \na milk surplus to be generated that could be used for processing and thereby substituting for the \nlarge quantity of imported dairy products. Dairy projects are being developed and considered in \ndifferent parts of the country.  \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nSector Potential \n\nE. \n \n42. \nAcross  the  seven  agro-ecological  zones  represented  by  the  major  regional  centers  of \nGardez, Herat, Jalalabad, Kabul, Kandahar, Kunduz, and Mazar, the opportunity exists for some \nregional specialization. Such pilot innovations as farmers\u2019 association cold stores, storage, and \nexport  marketing  in  some  development  partners\u2019  projects  indicate  that  opportunities  exist  for \nfurther market development. It is essential to use an approach focusing on the critical gaps from \nproduction  to  market,  developing  distribution  infrastructure.  This  will  require  both  small  and \nlarger-scale infrastructure. The type of infrastructure is expected to range from producers\u2019 and \nfarmers\u2019  associations\u2019  collection  and  packing  houses,  drying  facilities,  small  cold  storage \nfacilities,  and  logistical  support  to  larger  market  infrastructure  such  as  slaughterhouses  and \nwholesale markets. Feasibility assessment and strategic public\u2013private partnerships will need to \nbe undertaken to address these gaps that affect efficiency, transaction costs, and returns.  \n \n43. \nThe level of agribusiness expansion in each of the agro-ecological regions will depend \nupon existing enterprise scale and market potential for growth. For the raisin industry, it could \nentail  a  focus  on  Kandahar,  the  Shomali  Plains,  and  Mazar,  where  the  majority  of  the  grapes \nare  produced  and  where  the  13  existing  raisin-processing  plants  are  located.  For  the  nut \nindustry,  focus  could  fall  on  the  main  production  regions  including  Kabul-Parwan,  Balkh-\nSamangan,  and  Kandahar-Zabul  and  across  regions  in  targeted  small-scale  infrastructure \ninvestment,  technology  transfer,  and  improved  practices  to  improve  harvest  and  postharvest \nhandling and storage to reduce losses and increase sales of fresh fruits, dried fruits, and nuts. \nThe  installation  of  slaughterhouses  in  Kabul  and  regional  centers  would  centralize  livestock \nslaughtering  and  improve  the  efficiency  and  cost  effectiveness  of  meat  and  by-product \nprocessing and marketing. Profits from carpets could follow increased Afghan trader purchases \nof Ghazni wool, with processing and the expansion of the carpet industry in the key production \ncenters  of  Faryab,  Kabul,  Kunduz,  Herat,  and  Mazar,  as  well  as  clearer  Afghan  branding  of \ncarpets in international markets.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \nProject Title \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n\nDuration \n\nImplementing \nAgency \n\nDevelopment \nPartners \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n35 \n\nApproximate\nAmount  \n($ million) \n55.0 \n\nEC \n\nEC \n\nEC \n\n8.0 \n\n18.0 \n\n12.8 \n\n11.1 \n\n16.0 \n\n60.0 \n\nADB \n\nADB \n\nDFID \n\nDFID \n\nMAIL \n\nMAIL \n\nMAIL \n\nMAIL \n\nMAIL \n\nWorks \n\nMRRD \n\n2007\u20132010 \n\n2004\u20132014 \n\n2006\u20132009 \n\n2006\u20132011 \n\n2006\u20132010 \n\n2006\u20132010 \n\n2003\u20132009  MAIL and MRRD\n\n2008\u20132011  Ministry of Public \n\nAgriculture Sector Program \nLoan \nRural Business Support \nProject \nSupport to Strategic \nPlanning for Sustainable \nRural Livelihoods \nHelmand Agriculture and \nRural Development \nProgram \nPerennial Horticulture \nDevelopment Project \nAfghanistan Seed Industry \nDevelopment Project \nAnimal Health Development \nProject \nNorthern Economic \nInfrastructure Development \nProgram \nAccelerating Sustainable \nAgriculture Program \nAlternative Livelihoods \nProject \nAfghanistan Small and \nMedium Enterprise \nDevelopment \nAfghanistan Rural \nInvestment and Enterprise \nDevelopment \nEconomic Governance and \nPrivate Sector \nStrengthening \nAfghan\u2019s Building Capacity \nProgram \nHorticulture and Livestock \nProductivity Project \nPrivate Sector Development \nSupport Project \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  DFID  =  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  EC  = \nEuropean Commission, MAIL = Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock, MOCI = Ministry of Commerce and \nIndustries, MOPW = Ministry of Public Works, MRRD = Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, USAID = \nUnited States Agency for International Development. \nSource: ADB staff. \n\nGerman \nFinancial \nCooperation \nUSAID \n\nBusiness \nenterprises \n\nFinancial \ninstitutions \n\nMulti-ministry \n\nWorld Bank \n\nWorld Bank \n\n2006\u20132009 \n\n2006\u20132009 \n\n2007\u20132011 \n\n2006\u20132009 \n\n2004\u20132009 \n\n2007\u20132012 \n\n2006\u20132009 \n\n2005\u20132010 \n\nUSAID \n\nUSAID \n\nUSAID \n\nUSAID \n\nUSAID \n\nMOCI \n\nMOCI \n\n475.0 \n\n125.0 \n\n105.0 \n\nMAIL \n\nMAIL \n\n25.0 \n\n30.0 \n\n70.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36          Appendix 5 \n \n\nMARKET INFRASTRUCTURE SUBPROJECT SELECTION CRITERIA \n\nimproved  postharvest \n\nInfrastructure  Project  will  undertake  market \n\n \n1. \nThe priority commodity value chains identified for support are (i) dried fruit and nuts; (ii) \nfresh  fruits  and  vegetables;  and  (iii)  livestock  (red  meat),  hides,  skins,  and  casings.  The \ninfrastructure \nproposed  Agriculture  Market \ninvestments and provide support to improve the commercial operation of facilities, including the \nadoption  of \nInfrastructure \ninvestments  will  be  in  slaughterhouses  in  Kabul  and  in  three  provincial  centers;  small-scale \ninfrastructure  investment  in  horticultural  market  distribution  systems  to  address  critical  gaps \naffecting  productivity,  product  quality,  market  access,  and  demand  in  domestic  and  regional \nmarkets;  and  the  development  of  improved  laboratories  for  commodity  certification.  The \nproposed Project will target a limited number of commodities and industries in selected areas in \neach of the seven regions that have been identified as production centers.   \n \n\ntechnologies  and  marketing  practices. \n\n1. \n\nSlaughterhouses \n\n \nThe  proposed  Project  will  establish  slaughterhouses  with  support  facilities  for  holding \n2. \nlivestock;  handling  such  by-products  as  hides,  skins,  and  casings;  and  waste  management  in \nKabul  and  three  provincial  cities.  The  criteria  for  selecting  locations  is  based  on  livestock \nproduction and market demand, technical factors including the environment and site availability, \nfinancial and economic viability, and institutional and operational sustainability.  \n \n3. \nThe  preliminary  selection  is  Kabul  for  two  slaughterhouses  and  three  provincial  cities, \nHerat,  Kundus,  and  Mazar  for  one  each.  Suitable  sites  are  currently  being  identified  in  some \nlocations, but the construction of the facilities will start with prepared sites. The slaughterhouses \nwill  be  constructed  using  a  modular  unit  on  land  belonging  to  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture, \nIrrigation, and Livestock (MAIL), with long-term management and operation to be undertaken by \nprivate  entities.  Livestock  market  analysis  undertaken  as  part  of  the  financial  and  economic \nanalysis in Supplementary Appendix B indicates that a number of major regional centers have \ndemand for a slaughterhouse and that the facilities would be financially viable. A detailed outline \nof  slaughterhouse  structure,  waste  management  systems,  costs,  and  management  and \noperation plan is provided in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \n\n2. \n\nFarm-Level Collection and Marketing Facilities \n\n \nThe  proposed  Project  will  establish  small-scale  horticulture  infrastructure  investments \n4. \nthat  will \nfacilities; \ninclude  commodity  collection,  sorting,  and  grading  centers;  drying \npackinghouses and small cold storage facilities in production areas to address key constraints \non  efficient  postharvest  handling  and  marketing  that  impede  market  expansion.  These \ninvestments will be undertaken with farmers\u2019 organizations and agricultural cooperatives. They \nwill  have  a  catalytic  role,  demonstrating  the  incremental  returns  to  be  achieved  through \nimproved  postharvest  handling  and  marketing  and  strengthened  linkages  between  producers\u2019 \ngroups  and  traders.  This  investment  by  the  Government  of  Afghanistan  is  required  to  support \nsector growth, as private sector and financial institutional engagement in long-term agribusiness \ninfrastructure \ninvolve  producers\u2019 \norganizations.  \n \n5. \nInfrastructure investments are expected to range in cost from $20,000 to $75,000. The \nGovernment will fund these investments through the Project, with facilities constructed on MAIL-\nowned  land.  The  facilities  will  be  managed  and  operated  by  the  farmers\u2019  associations.  An \nindicative 200 small-scale market investments are included. Standard designs will be developed \nfor  the  different  types  of  small-scale  infrastructure.  Included  in  the  contract  package  for \n\nlimited,  especially \n\ninvestments \n\nis  very \n\nthose \n\nthat \n\nin \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n37 \n\nconstructing these small-scale facilities will be a small component to facilitate their adoption of \nimproved postharvest technologies and marketing practices and for strengthening management \nand operation systems.  \n \nThe selection criteria will be based on (i) prioritized commodities under the Project (dried \n6. \nfruits  and  nuts,  fresh  fruits  and  vegetables,  red  meat,  hides,  skins,  and  casings)  in  key \nproduction  areas,  (ii)  technical  and  financial  viability,  (iii)  institutional  and  operational \nsustainability of the facility, and (iv) integration with other project activities.  \n \n\n3. \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria \n\nThe  criteria  for  selecting  subproject  locations  are  based  on  the  indicators  outlined  in \n\n \n\n \n\n \n7. \nTable A5. \n \n\nTable A5: Subproject Selection Criteria \n\nCriteria \nFinancial \nThe subproject enterprise is financially viable, with a financial internal rate of return of at least \n12%. Operations and maintenance and financial sustainability established. \nTechnical \nSuitable  site  (topography,  land  use,  drainage)  is  available  on  Government  land  for  the \nslaughterhouse or small-scale market facility.  \nLocations of facilities to have a regional spread, especially for the small-scale infrastructure, to \nreflect  the  concentration  in  production  areas;  are  identified  project  priority  commodities  with \nopportunities  for  growth  and  value  added;  and  may  enable  integration  with  other  agricultural \nand agribusiness projects. \nEnterprise Institution and Operation \nThat  private  companies,  including  farmers\u2019  associations  and  agricultural  cooperatives  for  the \nsmall-scale  market  infrastructure,  have  the  capacity  to  manage  and  operate  the  market \nfacilities.  Expression  of  interest  sought  from  private  entities  for  long-term  slaughterhouse \nmanagement and operation contracts prior to construction.   \nEnvironment \nThe  subprojects  will  have  environmental  management  systems  that  meet  environmental \nprotection agency standards. In the slaughterhouses, wastewater management systems will be \nestablished  as  a  integral  aspect  of  design  and  operation  to  meet  national  and  international \nstandards,  in  line  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  policy  (such  regulations  have  yet  to  be \nestablished in Afghanistan). The subprojects will not harm existing or proposed protected areas \nor historical, cultural, or religious sites. \nSocial  \nSmall-scale facilities: \nFarmers\u2019 associations and agricultural cooperatives have expressed interest and demonstrated \ncapacity to participate. They stand to benefit from improved postharvest returns and managing \na small-scale facility. Organization willingness to operate and manage the facility equitably.   \nThe facility will benefit farmers. \nThe slaughterhouse will increase employment and opportunities for value addition. \nSecurity \nThe  security  environment  in  the  location  will  enable  the  construction,  establishment,  and \noperation of the slaughterhouse or small-scale facility.  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank staff. \n\n \n\n\f38 \n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \nTable A6.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n($ million) \n\n \n \n\nTotal\n\nBase\nCosts (%)\n\nItem\n I.

The  financial  analysis  is  based  on  returns  on  the \nindividual investments, and the economic analysis is based on the efficiency improvements that \nthese investments will provide and the increased sector returns to the economy. The economic \nanalysis of the slaughterhouses and small-scale market infrastructure is carried out as a single \nunit and then for each subcomponent, including the project management and capacity support \ncosts of delivering the subcomponent, before integration into a single overall project economic \nrate  of  return.  The  costs  of  product  standards  development  and  the  laboratory  investment  for \ncertified products are included in the small-scale market infrastructure subcomponent costs. \n \n2. \nThe overall project economic analysis is based on the with-project incremental economic \nreturn from the improved slaughterhouses in terms of meat and by-product quality and from the \ncommodity market facilities with reduced commodity losses and the improved prices that partly \nreflect commodity quality improvements through postharvest handling in the marketing facilities. \nThe economic return is conservative and it does not include the significant public health benefits \nfrom  the  hygienic  slaughter  of  livestock  in  urban  areas  or  from  improved  food  safety.  The  full \nfinancial and economic analysis is provided in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis  \n\n1. \n\nSlaughterhouses \n\n \n3. \nGeneral  Description.  Under  the  Project,  five  modular  slaughterhouses  will  be \nconstructed  in  the  priority  sites  identified,  two  in  Kabul  and  three  in  provincial  cities,  under  a \nturnkey  contract.  In  addition,  the  contractor  will  provide  management  supervision  and \noperational  support  during  the  first  year  following  the  commissioning  of  the  slaughterhouses. \nThe proposed modular slaughterhouse is designed to have a slaughtering capacity of 100 large \nruminants and 500 small ruminants per 8-hour shift operating 30 days per month, or a 10-hour \nshift  operating  25  days  per  month.  This  amounts  to  handling  a  minimum  of  3,000  large \nruminants  (with  200 kilograms  [kg]  of  red  meat  per  animal)  and  15,000  small  ruminants  (with \n20 kg of red meat per animal), equivalent to 900 tons of red meat per month or 10,800 tons per \nyear. The expected throughput is equivalent to 15% of the large ruminant slaughter and 18% of \nsmall ruminant slaughter in Kabul per year. The facility will reach full capacity on a single shift \nafter 3 years. The potential exists to increase throughput with additional shifts. Using a modern \nfacility  that  centralizes  the  slaughter  will  assist  pre-  and  postmortem  inspection;  add  value  by \nrecovering blood; and provide higher-quality hides, skins, and intestines for further processing. \nThe  capital costs  of  the  proposed  Kabul  site  in  district  18,  inclusive  of  physical  contingencies, \nare estimated at $2.9 million and, with inclusion of site infrastructure costs, $3.3 million.   \n \nEnterprise  Management  and  Operation.  The  facility  will  be  established  as  a  public\u2013\n4. \nprivate  partnership,  with  the  investment  undertaken  by  the  Government  and  enterprise \nmanagement contracted by tender to a private entity with one of the two following options: (i) a \nlong-term  management  contract  with  an  annual  service  fee  estimated  at  about  $139,000  per \nyear  or  (ii)  a  lease-to-purchase  management  contract  with  a  lease  service  charge  of \napproximately  $267,800  per  year.  The  final  fee  paid  will  be  determined  by  the  private \ncompanies as part of the bid process.   \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n51 \n\nFinancial  Analysis.  Analysis  indicates  that  the  facility  is  financially  viable.  Income  is \n5. \nestimated based on the daily throughput of 100 large ruminants and 500 small ruminants at a \nper-unit slaughter fee of $12.00 and $2.40, respectively. This charge is assessed as competitive \nwhen  compared  with  existing  slaughter  fees  charged  by  small,  private  slab  slaughtering \nfacilities, which charge between $7.00 and $10.00 per large ruminant.1 The modern facilities will \nmaintain the casing and hide by-products at improved quality for better returns and will produce \nmore  hygienic  meat  products.  At  full  development,  the  annual  cash  net  margin  before \nlease/repayment  fee  is  $562,200,  or  59%  of  turnover.  After  including  the  proposed  lease \nmanagement  fee  of  $139,000,  the  net  margin  is  $423,200,  representing  45%  of  turnover.  For \nthe  lease-to-purchase  option,  the  annual  net  margin  is  $294,000,  or  31%  of  turnover.  The  net \ncash  margin  indicates  that  the  investment  as  structured  would  be  financially  attractive  to  an \ninvestor  and  that  the  private  entity  tendering  for  the  facility  would  have  the  potential  to  lower \nslaughter fees or meet a higher lease payment and still have a viable enterprise.  \n \n6. \nThe  base  case  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  of  20%  before  financing  for  the \nslaughterhouse  investment  indicates  that  the  facility  is  financially  viable.  The  financial  net \npresent  value  is  $520,400  for  15  years,  discounted  at  the  indicative  opportunity  cost  of \ncommercial finance of 15%. The analysis indicates that the FIRR is reasonably robust.  \n \n\n2. \n\nFarm Collection and Market Facilities \n\n \nThe  proposed  Project  will  establish  small-scale  horticulture  infrastructure  investments \n7. \nthat  will \nfacilities; \ninclude  commodity  collection,  sorting,  and  grading  centers;  drying \npackinghouses; and small cold storage facilities in production areas to address key constraints \nin  postharvest  and  marketing  practices  that  impede  market  expansion.  These  investments  will \nbe  undertaken  with  producers\u2019  associations, \nfarmers\u2019  organizations,  and  agricultural \ncooperatives.  They  will  have  a  catalytic  role,  demonstrating  the  incremental  returns  to  be \nachieved  through  improved  postharvest  handling  and  marketing  and  strengthened  linkages \nbetween  producers\u2019  groups  and  traders.  The  incremental  benefit  translates  into  reduced \npostharvest and processing losses of approximately 20% and the export of approximately 25% \nof the throughput to higher-value markets at prices 10% to 50% higher than the domestic Kabul \nwholesale price. \n \n8. \nthe  small-scale  marketing \ninfrastructure  facilities  (commodity  collection,  sorting,  and  grading  centers;  treatment  facilities; \npackinghouses;  and  small  cold  storage  facilities)  have  been  prepared  for  analysis.  It  is \nanticipated that a wide range of agribusiness investments will be undertaken, and the examples \nused are to indicate the type of investment in priority areas and the potential returns involved. \nDuring project implementation, selection criteria, as detailed in Appendix 5, will be applied.2  A \nfinancial analysis has been prepared. The working capital needs will be sourced from enterprise \nequity,  presale  of  output,  forward  contracting  with  agents,  and,  if  possible,  from  borrowings. \nBased  on  commercial  practice,  the  enterprises  would  structure  operations  to  keep  working \ncapital needs at feasible levels.  \n \n9. \nanalysis before financing charges are as follows:  \n\nThe indicative types of  market infrastructure anticipated and the results of the financial \n\nRepresentative  market \n\ninfrastructure \n\ninvestments \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n1  If the butchers pass on the cost of the slaughter fee on to the consumer, the incremental cost of the meat from the \nslaughterhouse is estimated at approximately 1.5%, or AF3 per kg of beef, and 2.5%, or AF6, per kg of mutton. \n\n2 One criterion is on the financial viability and sustainability of the subproject. \n\n \n\n\f52          Appendix 11 \n \n\n(i)  Packing, grading, and cold storage facilities for apples, grapes, and other fruit. \nThe two examples provided are for apples and grapes and involve slightly different \nlevels of investment of $60,000 to $75,000, which covers buildings and equipment. In \nadditional,  smaller-scale  cold-storage  modules  for  $25,000  to  $30,000  are  feasible \noptions  for  horticulture.  The  enterprises  operated  by  farmers\u2019  or  producers\u2019 \nassociations  or  agricultural  cooperatives  are  financially  viable.  FIRRs  before \nfinancing are 31% and 68%, respectively.       \n\n(ii)  Raisins.  Sorting,  grading,  and  packing  aftabi  raisins  will  involve  investments  in \nprocessing equipment and building. The model is for processing 1,250 tons per year, \nwith a total investment of $35,000. The enterprise will be managed and operated by \na farmers\u2019 association and is financially viable with an FIRR before financing of 48%. \n(iii) Almonds.  Sorting,  grading,  and  packing  almonds  will  involve  investment  in \nmechanical  deshelling  equipment  and  buildings,  with  an  indicative  investment  of \n$20,000. The enterprise will be managed and operated by a farmers\u2019 association and \nis financially viable with an FIRR before financing of 42%. \n\n \nThe results of the financial analysis show FIRRs of 31% to 68%, which indicate that the \n10. \nhorticulture enterprise opportunities are financially viable. The enterprises with export potential \nmay improve upon the base case FIRR if traders increase export sales of improved products or \nsales  into  new  markets  for  a  portion  of  the  annual  throughput.  The  enterprises  will  generate \nother,  unquantifiable  benefits  in  terms  of  improved  hygiene,  food  safety,  and  environmental \nmanagement. The sensitivity analysis based on switching values indicates that the enterprises \nare  sensitive  to  export  price  variations  and  for  two  of  the  enterprise  models  also  sensitive  to \nchanges in quantity throughput. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis  \n\n1. \n\nSlaughterhouses \n\n \n11. \nAssumptions.  The  economic  analysis  uses  constant  mid-2008  prices.  The  project  life \nbase  case  is  assumed  to  be  15  years,  with  sensitivity  analyses  for  10  and  20  years.  The \nfinancial  costs  have  been  converted  to  economic  costs  using  a  standard  conversion  factor  of \n0.97 to exclude taxes and duties estimated at 3% and a standard conversion factor of 0.80 for \nconsulting  services.  Unit  rates  for  civil  works  include  materials  (30%),  equipment  and  fuel \n(30%), and unskilled labor (40%). In view of the significant levels of seasonal underemployment \nin urban areas, a shadow wage rate factor of 0.75 has been used in calculating the economic \ncost  of  civil  works  and  the  direct  labor  costs  of  operating  the  slaughterhouse.  As  is  standard \npractice,  the  derived  economic  analysis  includes  physical  contingencies  but  excludes  price \ncontingencies. The value of Government land in the Kabul area and the provinces is difficult to \nestimate  with  certainty,  as  it  is  recognized  that  distortions  to  values  occur  because  of  the \ndifficulties in establishing clear title and ownership and the inflationary impact of cash generated \nin  the  opium  economy,  particularly  in  Kabul.  For  the  economic  analysis,  it  has  been  assumed \nthat land is valued at $100,000 per hectare in Kabul and $10,000 per hectare in the provinces. \nThe  residual  value  of  the  slaughterhouse  and  equipment  by  year  10  is  estimated  at  10%.  No \nreduction in the value of the land has been incorporated. \n \n12.  With- and Without-Project Situation. The without-project situation is the existing state, \nwhereby  live  cattle,  buffaloes,  goats,  and  sheep  are  sold  by  livestock  traders  to  butchers  and \nslaughtered in backyards, on improvised private slaughter slabs, or on the street. Provision for \nhanging  carcasses  is  absent  or  very  limited,  and  the  skin  is  often  damaged  during  skinning  a \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n53 \n\ncarcass  on  the  ground  more  than  it  would  be  if  it  were  hung.  It  is  also  far  more  likely  for  a \ncarcass to be contaminated when slaughtered on the ground and in the skin.  \n \n13. \nThe with-project situation is with the slaughter facilities and incremental improvements in \nthe  regulatory  environment  and  assumes  an  environment  with  improved  power  supplies  and \nincreased  opportunities  for  butchers  to  improve  the  cool  storage  capacity  of  their  outlets.  The \nquantifiable  economic  benefits  derived  from  the  slaughterhouse  subcomponent  have  been \nidentified as the (i) incremental value of improved quality and more hygienically prepared meat \nthat is produced through the slaughter facility (the assumption is that consumers are willing to \npay for higher-quality and hygienic meat, and the proxy for this value is the cost of the animal \nslaughter, which is passed on to the consumer in the meat price at approximately 1.5%, or AF3 \nper  kg);  (ii)  opportunity  cost  of  the  time  saved  by  butchers  by  using  the  slaughterhouse;  (iii) \nincreased  value  associated  with  reduced  damage  to  skins,  hides,  and  casings;  and  (iv)  total \nvalue  of  blood  collected,  which,  once  treated  and  dried,  can  be  used  for  chicken  feed.  Other \nbenefits  that  have  not  been  included  in  the  economic  analysis  model  include  the  (i)  reduced \nwaste  products  in  streets  and  public  areas  and  the  resulting  savings  in  the  municipal  costs  of \nremoving it; (ii) improved ability of the municipality to enforce legislation requiring the slaughter \nof  animals  in  licensed  premises;  (iii)  increased  ability  of  butchers  to  comply  with  public  health \nand  hygiene  regulations;  (iv) \njobs  created  during \nslaughterhouse  construction  and  subsequent  operation,  each  requiring  up  to  20  slaughterers \nper  shift;  and  (vi)  increased  potential  for  further  value-adding  enterprises  that  utilize  the  by-\nproducts or provide inputs to the facilities.  \n \n14. \nof return (EIRR) for the slaughterhouse subcomponent over 15 years is estimated at 21%.   \n \n15. \nSensitivity analysis shows that the EIRR is very responsive to the incremental value of \nthe meat from the slaughterhouse, which is used as the indicator for consumers\u2019 willingness to \nmeet  the  full  incremental  cost.  A  20%  decrease  in  the  economic  value  of  meat  (i.e.,  a  price \nincrement  of  AF2.6  per  kg  beef,  or  1.2%,  and  of  AF4.8  per  kg  lamb,  or  a  2%  increase)  will \nreduce  the  EIRR  to  17%.  An  EIRR  at  this  level  allows  the  investment  to  remain  economically \nviable. For this variable, the EIRR has a high sensitivity indicator and a low switching value. A \n20% increase in the economic value of the meat indicates an EIRR of 30%. The corresponding \nlow  sensitivity  indicator  and  relatively  high  switching  value  for  the  other  variables  indicate  that \nthe EIRR is considerably less sensitive to changes in these when deriving incremental benefits. \n \n\nResults  of Economic  Analysis  and  Sensitivity  Analysis. The economic internal rate \n\nin  public  health;  (v) \n\nimprovement \n\n2. \n\nFarm Collection and Market Facilities \n\n \n16. \nAssumptions.  The  standard  conversion  factors  used  to  derive  economic  prices  from \nfinancial  prices  are  as  per  those  estimated  for  slaughterhouses.  The  economic  analysis \nassumes  the  same  provincial  land  value  of  $10,000  per  hectare.  The  four  types  of  indicative \nenterprise investment to be undertaken are between $22,400 and $70,250, including land cost. \nBased  on  the  four  indicative  enterprises  that  have  been  used  in  this  analysis,  the  following \nallocation  has  been  used  for  the  distribution  of  the  small-scale  infrastructure  investments: \napples (5%), table grapes (15%), raisins (30%), and almonds (50%). Based on the investment \ncost and this distribution, there would be 160 small market facilities. The phasing in of the small-\nscale infrastructure investments will be from year 2 through year 5 of the Project. \n \n17.  With-  and  Without-Project  Situation.  The  without-project  situation  is  based  on  the \nexisting  situation,  with  farmers  selling  in  local  markets  to  traders.  It  further  assumes  that \nindividual  small-scale  farmers  will  not  be  able  to  reduce  harvest  and  postharvest  losses  or \n\n \n\n\f54          Appendix 11 \n \n\nimprove  product  quality  without  collection  centers  or  packing  sorting  and  grading  facilities,  as \nwell  as  the  absence  of  improved  postharvest  technologies  to  support  value  addition.  And  it \nassumes  that  the  existing  regulatory  environment  remains,  with  regional  sales  based  on \nindustry  standards  in  the  absence  of  international  certification  or  sanitary  and  phytosanitary \nstandards.  \n \n18. \nThe with-project incremental returns are the quantifiable economic benefits generated by \nthe  improved  market  facilities  that  add  more  value,  by  decreased  losses  of  product  to \npostharvest  mishandling  and  limited  sorting  and  packing,  and  the  improved  return  from  better \nproduct  quality.  Markets  exist  for  the  export  and  domestic  consumption  of  the  incremental \nvolume  and  improved  quality  product.  The  project  investment  is  expected  to  have  a \ndemonstration  effect,  showing  that  small,  strategic  investments  in  similar  civil  works  and \nequipment can add value and return to farmers\u2019 associations and agricultural cooperatives, as \nindicated in the financial enterprise models. Further, traders and exporters with access to larger \nquantities of commodities will have incentives to undertake further value addition.  \n \nUsing the four representative models as the basis for the analysis, and given the level of \n19. \ninvestment planned, the market facilities will have the capacity to improve the sorting, packing, \ngrading,  and  storage  of  approximately  3.5%  of  the  total  national  throughput  of  fresh  grapes, \n10% of raisins, 12% of almonds, and 1% of apples. The apples will be consumed mainly in the \ndomestic  market,  though  there  is  opportunity  for  directly  marketing  higher-quality  apples  in \nPeshawar.  The  other  three  products\u2014grapes,  raisins,  and  almonds\u2014have  established  export \nopportunities,  but  traders  have  been  constrained  in  developing  some  export  markets  by  their \ninability to gain guaranteed access to reliable quantities of a certain quality. And they have been \nconstrained  from  further  developing  regional  and  international  markets  by  the  lack  of \ncertification of product quality or sanitary and phytosanitary compliance.  \n \n20. \nThe  with-project  situation  includes  an  investment  to  upgrade  laboratories  under  the \nMinistry of Commerce and Industries with the target of achieving international certification. This \nis  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  on  national  standards  and  will  help  strengthen  the \nhorticulture subsector as a whole. \n \nEconomic  Analysis  and  Sensitivity  Analysis.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n21. \n(EIRR)  at  the  subcomponent  level  is  indicative,  as  returns  on  these  small  market  facility \ninvestments  are  driven  by  demand.  The  final  mix  of  investments  will  be  determined  by  the \nselection  process  in  year  1  of  the  Project  and  will  be  based  on  selection  criteria  including \nfinancial  and  economic  returns.  The  EIRR  for  the  subcomponent,  including  the  project-related \ncosts of product standard development and certification and project management and capacity \nsupport,  is  48%  over  10  years.  This  indicates  that  the  subcomponent  investments  are \neconomically viable. Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken to identify the effect of changes \non the EIRR and on the economic net present value of the investment. The sensitivity analysis \nconfirms  that  the  EIRR  is  not  significantly  affected  by  assumptions  regarding  initial  project \nmanagement  costs  or  by  lags  in  implementation.  The  high  FIRR  for  the  representative \nenterprises  studied  and  the  high  subcomponent-wide  EIRR  indicate  that  the  subcomponent  is \neconomically viable as designed. \n \n\n3. \n\nOverall Project Economic Analysis  \n\n \nThe project EIRR is 29.5% over 10 years, which indicates that the investment package is \n22. \neconomically viable and provides a sound return to the sector and the economy. A lag of 1 year \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n55 \n\nin all planned investment activities reduces the EIRR to 16.7%, which indicates that the Project \nwould remain economically viable.  \n \nD. \n\nOverall Project Distribution Analysis \n\n23. \nSlaughterhouses.  Key  stakeholders  that  will  be  directly  affected  by  the  project \ninvestment  in  slaughterhouses  are the  municipalities  and  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Irrigation, \nand  Livestock,  which  will  be  better  able  to  regulate  slaughter  in  cities;  new  slaughterhouse \noperators, either private or butchers\u2019 associations; current slaughter operators that, for example, \noperate  slaughter  facilities  adjacent  to  livestock  markets;  by-product  traders  for  casings  and \nhides;  butchers  and  retailers;  and  consumers.  Indirect  stakeholders  are  livestock  farmers  and \npastoralists who will see changes in livestock marketing and purchase patterns; consumers of \nthe improved meat; and urban residents that will enjoy public health benefits. \n \n24. \nFarm  Collection  and  Market  Facilities. Direct beneficiaries include farmers producing \nproducts in the targeted commodities, who will benefit from the proposed farmers\u2019 associations \nand  agricultural  cooperative  market  infrastructure  investments;  traders;  marketers;  and \nexporters. The agribusiness subsector is relatively labor intensive and provides employment for \nsignificant numbers of skilled and unskilled workers. Expansion in the subsector is expected to \ngenerate  labor  demand  in  the  facilities  and  additional  employment  for  service  providers.  The \nadoption of good practices related to product quality and grade standards and compliance with \nfood  safety  standards  will  have  indirect  beneficiaries,  particularly  domestic  consumers.  The \nProject  will  provide  technical  support  to  the  market  facilities  on  postharvest  technologies  and \npractices, management, and operation. The main indirect beneficiaries will be consumers, who \nwill  benefit  from  improved  access  to  quality  and  hygienic  horticultural  and  livestock  products. \nService  providers,  including  transporters,  packing  material  suppliers,  and  processing  input \nsuppliers, will benefit from increased demand for their products and services. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f56         Appendix 12 \n\n \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\n \n\nProject \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: Afghanistan: Agriculture Market Infrastructure Project \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\n \n\nCWRD/CWAE \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  employment  generation  is  the  key  to  poverty  reduction.a  According  to  the  Afghanistan \nNational Development Strategy (ANDS), there is a need to sustain high growth rates in the medium term, and such growth will \nreduce  poverty  and  generate  employment.b  As  indicated  by  the  ANDS,  more  private  investment  is  needed  to  generate \nemployment.  In  turn,  access  to  markets,  infrastructure,  and  security,  and  better  protection  of  property  rights  are  critical \npreconditions for private investment. The rural economy is the major source of employment and income for most Afghans, as \nnearly  80%  of  the  population,  or  19  million  people,  live  in  impoverished  rural  areas.  Rural  economic  growth\u2014agricultural \ngrowth, diversification, and value addition\u2014is essential for any sustained improvement in livelihoods. In Afghanistan, informal \nenterprises, mostly agriculture based, are responsible for most private investment and employment and will play the key role \nin economic growth and generating employment. The current shortage of skilled labor harms the competitiveness of domestic \nindustry in comparison with neighboring economies.    \n \nAccording  to  2005  National  Risk  and  Vulnerability  Assessment  data,  about  45%  of  rural  and  nomadic  kuchi  populations \nappear  to  be  poor,  as  opposed  to  27%  of  those  who  live  in  urban  areas.c  Rural  populations  have  the  highest  rates  of  food \ninsecurity, with 45% not meeting minimum food requirements. In addition to facing high food insecurity, rural households have \nless  access  to  infrastructure  and  basic  public  services.  Their  level  of  education  is  low  and  rates  of  illiteracy  high.  Rural \nhouseholds depend heavily on agriculture, though off-farm activity has started to play a bigger role in the coping strategy of \nthe rural poor. \n \nFurther agricultural growth and poverty reduction will depend on agricultural expansion and diversification, which will require \nimprovements  in  the  agriculture  value  chain  from  production  through  processing,  packaging,  and  transport  to  marketing.  In \naddition,  higher  rural  non-farm  incomes  will  help  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  the  poor  to  the  risks  inherent  in  agriculture  and \nensure more equitable economic development. \n \nCommercial agriculture priority value chains that have been identified include, but will not necessarily be limited to, dried fruits \nand nuts; fresh fruits and vegetables; wool and carpets; and livestock red meat, hides, skins, and casings. In these prioritized \ncommodity value chains, project support will improve efficiency through improved infrastructure and the adoption of improved \npostharvest technology and management practices and processes. The proposed activities with agribusinesses and farmers\u2019 \nassociations  will  facilitate  growth  in  production;  improve  commodity  quality;  expand  capacity  to  meet  demand  in  export  and \ndomestic  markets;  and  improve  returns  for  farmers,  traders,  and  processors.  Targeting  a  limited  number  of  commodities  in \nselected  areas  in  each  region,  and  focusing  on  priority  gaps  in  those  value  chains,  the  Project  will  facilitate  and  support \ncommercial agricultural development by agribusinesses. \n \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n\n1.  Key Issues  \n \nAfghanistan\u2019s  human  development  indicators  are  among  the  lowest  in  the  world,  comparable  to  those  of  the  poorest \nlandlocked  or  war-torn  countries  of  sub-Saharan  Africa.d  Although  poverty  measurement  in  Afghanistan  is  severely \nconstrained  by  the  lack  of  quality  data,  available  figures  paint  a  dire  picture.  Some  12  million  Afghans,  or  42%  of  the \npopulation, live below the poverty line, with incomes of about $14 per month per capita. Those unable to purchase sufficient \nfood  to  guarantee  the  world  standard  minimum  food  intake  of  2,100  calories  per  day  are  estimated  at  around  45%  of  the \npopulation.e  In  addition,  life  expectancy  in  Afghanistan  is  under  45  years,  at  least  10  years  below  that  of  any  other  Asian \ncountry. Over 20% of all Afghan children die before the age of 5, half of Afghanistan\u2019s school-age children are not in school, \nand 57% of the population is under 18 years of age, with little hope of full-time employment. In much of the country, over 80% \nof the people are illiterate, and gender inequality  is rife across all sectors, resulting  in  particularly difficult circumstances for \nwomen.f   \n \nThe ANDS strategic vision for agriculture and rural development is to ensure the social, economic, and political well-being of \nrural  communities,  especially  poor  and  vulnerable  people,  while  stimulating  the  integration  of  rural  communities  into  the \n\n\f \n\n Appendix 12           57 \n\nnational  economy.  This  will  require  transforming  agriculture  so  that  it  is  more  productive  and  increasingly  commercially \noriented and expanding off-farm employment opportunities, thereby increasing rural incomes.g  \n \nSocioeconomic analysis based on social assessment indicates that the Project  will improve the living standards of the rural \npopulation  by  increasing  employment  opportunities  in  expanding  agribusinesses  for  semi-skilled  and  skilled  workers,  and \nthrough the benefits at the production stage from the adoption of improved postharvest practices and technologies, which will \nimprove productivity, quality, and market returns. These interventions will have a major social impact and reduce poverty.  \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nAgribusiness\u2019s  value  addition  is  estimated  at  $540  million,  largely  through  small-scale  and  cottage  industries.  These \nenterprises  are  family-  or  village-based  and  operate  with  family  and  local  labor,  generally  with  little  mechanization.  Quality \ncontrol  and  value  added  is  low.  Given  the  large  number  of  such  enterprises,  this  subsector  is  a  major  employer.  Although \nmechanized  agribusinesses  are  few,  their  number  is  expected  to  increase.  The  proposed  project  interventions  will  have  a \nsignificant  impact  on  small-scale  and  cottage  enterprises,  and  those  participating  and  adopting  improved  practices  will \ngenerate increased returns. \n \nIn  the  commodity  chains  that  the  Project  is  proposing  to  support,  the  interventions  will  improve  growth,  the  performance  of \nfarmer  and  agribusiness  activities,  and  the  operation  of  farmers\u2019  associations.  These  market  infrastructure  investments  will \nadopt improved postharvest technologies and practices that will facilitate expansion and the establishment of new trading and \nprocessing businesses and develop stronger supply lines.   \n \nConstraints  on  the  participation  of  the  poor  are  likely  to  be  from  limited  social  and  political  networks,  the  lack  of  skills  and \nexperience, and limited access to capital for lack of collateral. To address some of these constraints and increase the impact \nof the project on potential beneficiaries, project interventions will enable participation through farmer associations, small-scale \ninfrastructure interventions, and targeted training.  \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nA  stakeholder  analysis  was  undertaken  as  part  of  the  project  design.  Stakeholders  have  been  involved  in  project  design \nthrough stakeholder workshops in Herat, Kabul, and Mazar, and through numerous meetings held with individuals and groups \nfrom a large range of government and private sector agencies, which has continued during processing. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?  \n \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nDuring project implementation, project  working groups and representatives of associations and private enterprises  will have \nopportunities to raise concerns, propose and prioritize project activities, and comment on measures required to enhance the \nbusiness environment. These groups need to include women and men, as well as representatives from different stakeholder \ngroups and wealth categories. \n \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues  \n \nWomen are already heavily involved in agricultural production and processing and, to a lesser extent, in trading agricultural \nproduce.  Under  the  Project\u2019s  strengthening  of  commodity  value  chains  from  harvest  and  postharvest,  there  will  be \nopportunities to support women\u2019s producer associations interested in improving the quality of their produce, thereby enabling \nrural women to benefit. Women will benefit as employees of agribusinesses, entrepreneurs, and members of women\u2019s groups \ninvolved in production or supply. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f58         Appendix 12 \n\nAlthough reliable gender-disaggregated data is lacking, Afghanistan\u2019s gender indicators are very poor, as indicated by gender \ngaps  in  health,  education,  access  to  and  control  over  resources,  economic  opportunity,  justice,  and  political  participation. \nWomen  are  important  economic  actors,  but  data  is  limited  as  to  their  contribution  and  economic  role.  While  Afghanistan\u2019s \nconstitution  enshrines  women\u2019s  equality,  progress  toward  this  ideal  will  take  time,  given  prevailing  cultural,  social,  and \nreligious sensitivities.  \n \n2.  Key  Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n \n\n \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \nA  project-specific  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  has  been  developed  and  will  be  updated  during  project  processing  and \nimplementation. The GAP will ensure that a certain percentage of stakeholders participating in the project planning process \nwill be women; that a certain percentage of the staff of the Project and supporting institutions responsible for implementation \nwill also be female; and that women-headed households, associations, and entrepreneurs will be active participants. Women \nwill participate in project activities. The different groups will require different strategies and activities to get their involvement.

The  full  GAP  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D. \nWomen\u2019s  participation  in  the  Project  is  expected  to  contribute  to  their  social  and  economic \ndevelopment through training and capacity development, support to women\u2019s entrepreneurship \nand  leadership,  and  employment.  This  is  in  line  with  the  Government  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  three-\npronged  goals  on  gender:  (i)  eliminate  discrimination  against  women,  (ii)  develop  women\u2019s \nhuman capital, and (iii) ensure women\u2019s leadership to guarantee their full and equal participation \nin all aspects of life. \n \nSupporting these goals will result directly and indirectly in reduced income poverty and \n2. \nfood  poverty  among  rural  and  urban  households.  Participation  in  income-generating  and \nentrepreneurial activities will raise women\u2019s confidence, enhance their social status, and support \ntheir  empowerment  in  decision  making  in  households  and  villages,  regionally  and  nationally. \nRecent surveys in Afghanistan have confirmed that the poorest households are more likely to be \nthose headed by a single parent, often a woman, and that 67% of female-headed households \nare poor.1 Women-headed households are therefore particularly vulnerable.  \n \n3. \nWith  the  support  of  the  Project,  women  are  expected  to  benefit  in  several  ways  from \nagribusiness development, as employees of agribusinesses, entrepreneurs, leaders or partners \nin  agribusinesses,  and  members  of  women\u2019s  groups  or  associations  involved  in  agricultural \nmarketing. Women are already heavily involved in agricultural production and processing and, \nto a lesser extent, in trading agricultural produce. By starting value chains with the harvest and \npostharvest,  the  Project  has  the  opportunity  to  support  women\u2019s  producer  associations \ninterested  in  improving  the  quality  of  their  produce,  thus  enabling  rural  women  to  benefit  who \nmay  not  be  able  or  willing  to  invest  in  large,  urban  agribusiness  opportunities,  and  who  may, \nbecause of their geographical location, not benefit from wage work in urban agribusiness plants. \nThe table in Supplementary Appendix D provides indicative estimates. \n \n4. \nAt this stage in the development of the Afghan agribusiness subsector, it seems unlikely \nthat  project-supported  slaughterhouses  and  small-scale  marketing  infrastructure  facilities  will \nadversely affect women\u2019s employment in cottage industries and backyard processing. Further, \nmonitoring the impact of the new businesses on cottage industries will be undertaken to assess \nthe  livelihood  opportunities  that  Afghan  women  currently  derive  from  it.  There  is  a  risk  that \nwomen will be sidelined by agribusiness development, because currently there are few female \nagribusiness professionals in Afghanistan, and very little targeted support is available to women \nagribusiness entrepreneurs. In terms of employment in agribusinesses, it is likely that men will \nbe the main beneficiaries of the Project in terms of training and entrepreneurship, while the bulk \nof women employment generated will be through backward linkages to agricultural production. \nThe Project will therefore make a concerted effort to promote women producers and members \nof  farmers\u2019  associations  and  to  increase  the  benefits  that  women  obtain  from  employment  in \nagribusinesses.  The  project  management  office  will  need  to  adapt  gender-mainstreaming \napproaches  to  the  specific  requirements  of  each  region.  The  Project  acknowledges  that \nsupporting women\u2019s empowerment throughout the Project will require additional resources. \n\n                                                 \n1   National  Risk  and  Vulnerability  Assessment  2005,  cited  in  Government  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan. \n2006.
