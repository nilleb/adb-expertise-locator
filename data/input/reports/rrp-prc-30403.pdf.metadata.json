An Initial Environmental Examination was undertaken. \n\n \nThe Project will establish a coal mine methane development project \n(CMMDP)  at  Jincheng  in  the  southern  part  of  Shanxi  Province  with \nthe  following  components:  (i)  Part  A,  coalbed  methane  (CBM)  and \ncoal  mine  methane  (CMM)  production  for  a  power  plant  of  120 \nmegawatts  (MW);  (ii)  Part  B,  CMM  transmission  and  distribution  to \nconsumers  in  the  Jincheng  area;  and  (iii)  Part  C,  institutional \nstrengthening and capacity building.  \n \nIn 2003, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)  produced about 1.7 \nbillion  tons  of  coal.  Coal  mining  causes  the  release  of  methane,  a \ngreenhouse  gas  (GHG),  which  is  about  21  times  more  potent  than \ncarbon dioxide (CO2), into the atmosphere. PRC coal mines release \nmore  than  6  billion  cubic  meters  (m3)  of  methane  each  year.  With \nincreasing coal production and depth of coal mining, this amount will \nincrease.  Methane  is  highly  explosive  and  needs  to  be  removed \n(drained)  during  underground  coal  mining  operations  to  keep \nworking  conditions  safe.  Each  year  at  least  7,000  miners  die  from \nunderground  accidents,  mainly  caused  by  methane  explosions. \nTherefore,  increased  removal,  capture,  and  use  of  methane  will \n(i)  reduce  GHG  emissions,  (ii)  increase  clean  fuel  use  (methane  in \nplace  of  coal),  (iii)  improve  air  quality,  and  (iv)  improve  coal  mine \nsafety and efficiency. The increased production and use of CMM and \nCBM  require  new  technologies  that  are  not  yet  used  in  the  PRC. \nA project demonstrating that such new technologies can be applied \nin \nthe  PRC  would  catalyze  development  of  similar  projects \nelsewhere  in  the  country.  Southern  Shanxi  Province  has  highly \nmethane-rich coal mines. After careful study of potential coal mining \nareas  by  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-financed  consultants,  the \narea around Jincheng was selected as most suitable for establishing \na  demonstration  project.  Part  A  of  the  Project  will  demonstrate  the \nmore  efficient  production  of  CBM,  and  drainage  and  capture  of \nCMM, and their use for power generation as a least-cost alternative\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nObjective \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\ntransmission  and  distribution  of  CMM \n\nusing  new  technologies.  Part  B  will  demonstrate  the  efficient \ncommercial  use  of  CMM  for  transmission  and  distribution  to \nconsumers.  Part  C  will  institutionally  strengthen  the  companies \ninvolved in the CMMDP and promote similar projects in the PRC.  \n \nThe  main  objective  of  the  CMMDP  is  to  establish  a  CMM \ndevelopment project that covers all aspects of effective and efficient \nCMM  and  CBM  production,  capture,  and  utilization  by  applying  the \nlatest  technologies,  i.e.,  improved  CBM  production  from  vertical \nsurface  wells  and  directionally  drilled  wells  from  the  surface  into \nunderground coal seams, improved CMM drainage through the use \nof underground directional drilling and other modern equipment and \nmaterials,  CMM-based  power  generation  using  internal  combustion \ngas  engines,  and \nfor \nresidential,  commercial,  and  industrial  use.  In  this  manner  the \nCMMDP  will  improve  mine  safety,  reduce  GHG  emissions,  and \nimprove the environment. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $237  million  equivalent, \ncomprising a foreign exchange cost of $140 million (59%) and a local \ncurrency cost of $97 million equivalent (41%). \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $117.4  million  to  finance  part  of  the \nforeign  exchange  cost  of  the  CMMDP  and  part  of  its  consulting \nservices, while Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) will \nprovide a parallel loan of $20 million to finance the foreign exchange \ncost of CBM and CMM production under part A of the CMMDP. The \nUnited  States  Trade  and  Development  Agency  (USTDA)  has \nprovided  a  grant  of  $500,000  to  finance  international  and  domestic \nconsulting  services  for  construction  of  the  CMM-fired  power  plant. \nThe remaining foreign exchange cost of $2.6 million and local cost of \n$96.5 million equivalent will be financed through equity contributions \nof  $61.2  million  equivalent  from  Jincheng  Anthracite  Mining  Group \nCompany  Limited  (JMC),  Shanxi  Energy  Industries  Group  Limited \n(SEIG),  and  Jincheng  municipal  government  and  a  loan  of  $37.9 \nmillion equivalent from the Industrial Commercial Bank of China. \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $117.4 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a  24-year term including a grace \nperiod  of  4  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% \nper annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nLoan and Project Agreements. \n \nThe loan proceeds will be relent by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to \nthe  Shanxi  provincial  government  (SPG)  through  a  subsidiary  loan \nagreement  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions.  SPG  will  onlend  the \nloan  proceeds,  either  directly  or  through  the  Jincheng  municipal \ngovernment,  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  to  the  project \nimplementing agencies (PIAs). \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n\f \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements  \n\n \nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n\nv \n\n \nJanuary 2005\u2013June 2009 \n \n \n31 December 2008 \n \nSPG \n \nSPG,  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  CMMDP,  has  established  a \nproject  management  office  (PMO).  Parts  A  and  B  will  be \nimplemented by three PIAs: JMC for part A, and Shanxi Energy CBM \nCompany Limited (SECC) for the CMM transmission component and \nJincheng  CMM  Comprehensive  Utilization  Company  Limited \n(JCCUC) for the CMM distribution component under part B. SPG will \nimplement  part  C  in  consultation  with  the  PIAs.  JBIC  and  ADB  will \ncoordinate implementation of the various project components.  \n \nEquipment, materials, and civil works financed from the proceeds of \nthe ADB loan will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor  Procurement.  Equipment,  materials,  and  technical  services  for \nCBM  and  CMM  production  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nJBIC\u2019s  guidelines  for  procurement.  Items  financed  by  the  PIAs  with \nlocal  currency  funds  will  be  procured  following  bidding  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. ADB has agreed to advance procurement action \nfinancing.  Total \nand,  subject \nretroactive  financing  of  procured  goods  and  provided  consulting \nservices will be limited to $10 million.  \n \nUnder  part  A,  ADB  will  provide  18  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services  and  65  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices to help JMC supervise CMM drainage and CBM production. \nAt  the  same  time,  USTDA  will  provide  12  person-months  of \ninternational and 8 person-months of domestic consulting services to \nassist JMC (i) select the most efficient detailed design for the power \nplant, (ii) procure the required equipment and materials for the power \nplant,  and  (iii)  supervise  its  construction  and  commissioning.  Under \npart  B,  ADB  will  provide  6  person-months  of  international  and  28 \nperson-months of domestic consulting services to assist SECC and \nJCCUC with project management and implementation. Under part C, \nADB  will  provide  14  person-months  of  international  and  40  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services  to  assist  the  PMO,  SEIG, \nand  the  PIAs  with  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building. \nADB-financed  domestic  consultants  under  parts  A  and  B  will  help \nJMC,  SECC,  and  JCCUC  develop  indicators  and  benchmarks  to \nmeasure  the  long-term  economic,  social,  and  environmental  impact \nof the respective project components. ADB has agreed to retroactive \nfinancing  of  the  consulting  services.  Total  retroactive  financing  of \nprocured  goods  and  provided  consulting  services  will  be  limited  to \n$10 million. \n \n \n\nto  Board  approval, \n\nretroactive \n\n\fvi \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n \n\n \n\nthe \n\n \nThe  CMMDP  will  demonstrate \nfeasibility  of  using  new \ntechnologies  for  CBM  and  CMM  production,  capture,  and  use,  and \npromote  the  development  of  similar  projects  in  the  PRC.  In  the \nJincheng area, the CMMDP will improve mine safety and air quality \nby replacing polluting fuels such as coal, fuel wood, synthetic \u201cwaste\u201d \ngas, and petroleum-based fuels, with CBM and CMM, equivalent to \nabout  265  million  m3  of  methane  a  year.  The  CMMDP  will  save \n429,310  tons  of  coal  a  year  (approximately  two  thirds  from  clean \npower generation and one third from fuel switching by industrial and \nmunicipal supply customers). Annual emissions reductions are 7,866 \ntons  of  particulate  matter  (PM);  4,901  tons  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2); \n2,077  tons  of  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx);  and  612,058  tons  of  carbon \ndioxide  (CO2)  as  a  result  of  energy  efficiency  gains.  Reductions  in \nPM, SO2, and NOx will improve local air quality and reduce regional \nacid  precipitation.  Global  benefits  will  result  from  methane  capture \nand  CO2  reductions  generated  by  fuel  switching.  The  CMMDP  is \nestimated to reduce CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions by at least 4.4 \nmillion  tons  a  year.  The  CMMDP  therefore  has  good  potential  to \nattract funds under the clean development mechanism (CDM) under \nthe  Kyoto  Protocol  or  similar  arrangements  as  it  will  help  reduce \nGHG emissions. \n \nThe Prototype Carbon Fund has finalized an agreement with MOF to \npurchase  3  million  tons  of  CO2e  in  emission  reductions  from  the \nCMMDP, at a unit price of $4.25 per ton of CO2e, for a total contract \nvalue  of  about  $12.75  million.  However,  the  finalization  of  the \nagreement is subject to approval by the CDM executive board of the \nmethodology used to calculate the CO2e emission reductions. \n \nThe  economic  and  financial  internal  rates  of  return  for  the  whole \nCMMDP are satisfactory at 23.4% (with local environmental benefits) \nand  6.5%,  respectively.  The  CMMDP\u2019s  poverty  impact  ratio  is \nestimated at 16.7%.  \n \nThe CMMDP will provide social benefits for the poor by (i) providing \njobs, \nthem  with  clean  and  affordable  energy, \n(iii)  reducing  air  pollution  and  related  health  impacts,  (iv)  improving \nthe  socio-economic  environment,  (v)  improving  occupational  safety \nfor  miners,  and  (vi)  improving  their  quality  of  life.  The  CMMDP  will \ncreate  about  1,200  fulltime  jobs  during  construction  and  845  during \noperation.  During  construction,  the  poor  and  women  will  fill  780 \npositions and earn about CNY8.5 million a year. Of the 845 positions \ncreated  during  the  operations,  420  are  expected  to  go  to  the  poor \nand  women,  with  about  CNY4.6  million  in  wages  a  year.  To  further \nreduce poverty, JCCUC will connect poor households for free to the \nCMM  distribution  pipeline  system  and  will  apply  a  special  pro-poor \nCMM tariff, which will reduce the poor\u2019s normal monthly user fees by \nabout 50%. \n \n \n\n(ii)  creating \n\n\fvii \n\nIn \n\nthe  CMM \n\nThe  risks  associated  with  the  supply  of  the  sufficient  quantities  of \nCBM and CMM are minimal since the design of the CMM-fired power \nplant  and  the  CMM  transmission  and  distribution  system  are  based \non  a  detailed  assessment  of  the  quantities  that  can  be  made \navailable  under  the  CMMDP.  CBM  production  and  CMM  drainage \nare to be carried out with assistance from experienced international \nexperts.  In  case  of  any  shortfall  in  the  overall  supply  of  methane, \nSPG will allocate CMM from other mines in the vicinity of the power \ntransmission  and  distribution  component, \nplant. \navailable CMM supplies at various mines exceed the projected CMM \ndemand  under  the  pipeline  to  ensure  adequate  supplies.  The \ntechnical  and  completion  risks  associated  with  introducing  new \ntechnologies  for  CBM  production,  CMM  drainage,  and  CMM-based \npower  generation  have  been  adequately  addressed  by  (i)  including \nconsulting  services  for  project  implementation  (including  preparing \nthe detailed design of the power plant with assistance from USTDA-\nfinanced  consultants)  under  the  CMMDP,  and  (ii)  requiring  that  the \nsupplier  of  the  power  generation  equipment  be  responsible  for \nsupervision of the first year of operation and maintenance work after \nthe  commissioning  of  the  first  50%  of  power  generation  capacity. \nJMC has established a separate company unit to operate the power \nplant  while  SEIG  and  the  Jincheng  municipal  government  have \nestablished separate companies to construct and operate the CMM \ntransmission  and  distribution  systems, \nfinancial \nsustainability of their operations. \n\nthus  ensuring \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit to you for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nloan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Coal  Mine  Methane  Development  Project \n(CMMDP). The Project Framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nA. \n \n2. \nEconomic and social development in the PRC in the last two decades has been rapid. By \nthe  end  of  2003  the  PRC\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita  was  $1,000  equivalent,  life \nexpectancy  at  birth  71.4  years,  and  adult  literacy  83%.  Government  programs  have  resulted  in \npoverty reduction, particularly in rural areas. \n \n3. \nEconomic  growth  has  been  facilitated  by  infrastructure  development,  a  crucial  component \nbeing  energy  sector  development.  At  the  end  of  June  2004,  the  PRC\u2019s  total  installed  power  was \n400 gigawatts (GW), and in 2003, total electricity generated was 1,891 terawatt-hours, 15.4% more \nthan  in  2002.  Worldwide  the  PRC  ranked  second  in  installed  power  generation  capacity  and \nelectricity consumption. Based on higher-than-projected growth in electricity demand from 2001 to \n2003, the 4.5-5.0% annual increase in electricity consumption forecast in the 10th Five-Year Plan \n(FYP),  2001-2005,  has  proved  to  be  too  conservative  and  power  shortages  are  emerging  in \nvarious  regions.  Nearly  three  quarters  of  the  PRC's  electricity  is  generated  by  coal  and  a  little \nunder one quarter by hydroelectricity. Together, oil, gas, and nuclear power account for less than \n1%.  \n \n4. \nIn view of the PRC's continual power shortage the Government is taking action\u2015 including \nlegislation\u2015to promote the development of renewable energy. State entities are drafting a law to \ncompel power grid companies to buy electricity generated by renewable energy sources, such as \nwater, wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and marine-based power, and all end users will share the \ncosts. The PRC has been slow to develop renewable energies because they are more expensive \nthan conventional energy sources. However, sharp increases in energy demand leave the PRC no \nother choice than to accelerate the use of renewable energy. \n \n5. \nThe  PRC\u2019s  coal  production  in  2003  was  about  1.7  billion  tons,  22%  higher  than  in  2002. \nDuring 2004, coal production is expected to increase to about 1.9 billion tons, which will mainly be \nused  in  the  domestic  market,  with  only  about  80.0  million  tons  being  exported  and  stockpiles \ndwindling.1 Coal is expensive to transport and inefficient to use, but cheap to produce: about $12-\n13 equivalent per ton for the large mines (around $6 equivalent for small ones). The PRC\u2019s proven \nrecoverable  coal  reserves  are  estimated  at  114.5  billion  tons.2  On  this  basis  the  PRC  could \ncontinue the current level of coal production for 105 years. Despite the envisaged increase in use \nof natural gas following the ongoing and planned construction of the west-to- east gas transmission \npipeline and receiving terminals for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) along the east coast, coal \nwill remain the dominant fuel with a projected share of about 64% in primary energy consumption, \nand  75%  in  electricity  generation  by  2015.  Coal  consumption  could  increase  to  3.3  billion  tons  a \nyear by 2020 assuming a continuation of the present economic growth rate and the Government\u2019s \nenergy policies.3 Appendix 2 provides an analysis of the coal sector. \n\n                                                 \n1   Coal imports are expected to remain relatively insignificant, at less than 10 million tons.   \n2   Total coal resources are estimated to be much higher, at around 1 trillion tons. \n3   However,  doubling  of  present  coal  production  and  consumption  levels  would  require  large  investments  to  develop \n\nnew coal mines and coal transportation infrastructure.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n6. \nThe  heavy  dependence  on  coal  as  an  energy  source  has  resulted  in  substantial \nenvironmental damage due to pollution from particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen \noxides (NOx), and other trace elements occurring in coal. SO2 and NOX are the main causes of acid \nrain, one of the largest environmental problems in the PRC and East Asia.  Approximately 80% of \nSO2  originates  from  coal  combustion  in  the  power  and  industry  sectors,  which  according  to  the \nState Environmental Protection Administration, results in annual damage of $13.3 billion. A recent \nreport4  estimated  that  environmental  costs  of  urban  air  pollution  are  5%  of  GDP;  indoor  air \npollution,  2%;  and  acid  rain,  over  1%.  Carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  is  another  by-product  of  coal \ncombustion,  which  has  negative  global  impacts.  The  PRC  is  the  second  largest  CO2-producing \ncountry in the world, and if current trends continue, it will become the largest by 2020. About 63% \nof  the  major  PRC  cities  do  not  meet  grade  II  national  air  quality  standards.  The  poor  are  most \nvulnerable to environment-induced diseases and are least capable of paying for adequate medical \nattention  for  respiratory  illnesses  associated  with  breathing  polluted  air.  With  rapid  economic \ndevelopment  expected  to  continue,  emissions  per  unit  of  GDP  must  decline  significantly  to \nmaintain  the  present  level  of  polluting  emissions.  If  the  Government  does  not  provide  stronger \nincentives to abate polluting emissions, environmental damage will continue to increase. \n\nCoal  production  results  in  the  emission  of  methane,5  a  greenhouse  gas  (GHG).  When \n7. \nreleased  into  the  atmosphere,  GHGs  contribute  to  global  warming.  Methane  is  approximately  21 \ntimes  more  potent  than  CO2.  In  2002,  PRC  coal  mines  vented  about  10  billion-12  billion  cubic \nmeter  (m3)  of  methane  into  the  atmosphere.  As  coal  mining  operations  go  deeper  underground, \nthis volume is expected to increase.6 Methane produced by coal is called coalbed methane (CBM) \nwhen released through wells, which are drilled from the surface into underground coal seams, and \ncoal mine methane (CMM)7 when it is released through mine shafts.8 If captured, methane could \nbe a clean energy source. \n\n8. \nCBM is adsorbed onto the internal surface of the coal seam and is released as a result of \npressure changes when underground coal is mined or exposed to surface conditions. Underground \nCMM  is  highly  explosive  and  needs  to  be  removed  during,  and  sometimes  before,  actual  coal-\nmining operations to ensure that underground coal mines can be operated safely. Many coal mines \nhave  a  high  methane  content  and  inefficient  CMM  drainage  is  the  main  cause  of  frequent \nunderground  explosions,  which  resulted  in  the  death  of  more  than  7,000  miners  in  2003,  and  of \nover 4,100 during the first half of 2004.9 The PRC has many more coal mine related fatalities than \nother  coal  mining  countries,  mainly  due  to  differences  in  mine  operation  management,  safety \nstandards, and miners\u2019 working hours.10  In August 2003, the Government announced that in 2004 \nit would invest CNY2.2 billion (about $265 million equivalent) to improve workplace safety for coal \nminers, mainly by installing more efficient CMM drainage systems.  \n\nThe  Government  is  providing  preferential  policies  and  tax  incentives  to  private  sector \n9. \ninvestors  for  CBM  exploration  and  production  in  virgin  coal  areas.  In  1996,  the  China  United \nCoalbed Methane Corporation Limited was established to attract foreign investors and technology \nto  develop  the  PRC\u2019s  CBM  sector  and  to  act  as  joint  venture  partner  for  CBM  exploration  and \nproduction activities. However, a successful CBM development project using surface wells drilled \n                                                 \n4   ADB.  1998.

Manila (Subproject 1, Final Report, 15 October 2001). \n\n5   Methane is a non-toxic combustible gas and the primary constituent (about 98%) of natural gas.  \n6   The International Energy Agency projects that the PRC\u2019s increase in GHG emissions between 2000 and 2030  will \n\nnearly equal the increase of the entire industrialized world.  \n\n7    Since mainly CMM is produced in the PRC and will be under the CMMDP, all coal-associated methane will be called \n\nCMM unless the reference is specifically to CBM.  \nIn the PRC, coal is mainly produced underground, and only about 5% is produced through open cast mining.  \n\n8  \n9   Small-scale  coal  mines  that  produce  300,000  tons  or  less  a  year,  account  for  about  50%  of  total  annual  coal \nproduction  and  for  about  70%  of  the  accidents.  Underground  methane  gas  explosions  account  for  approximately \n80% of coal mine accidents. \n\n10   To  improve  safety  and  health  conditions  in  PRC  coal  mines  the  United  States  Labor  Department  is  providing \n\ntechnical assistance, which is financed by a grant of $2.3 million. \n\n \n\n\finto virgin coal seams has not yet been developed on a commercial scale in the PRC.11 Through \npreferential policies the Government is also encouraging coal mines to increase CMM capture and \nuse.  Some  coal  mines  use  the  produced  CMM  for  inefficient  small-scale  power  generation  or \ndistribution to households. However, CMM use is small, and less than 10% of the vented CMM has \nbeen  properly  drained.  Total  CBM  resources  up  to  a  depth  of  2,000  meters  are  estimated  at  30 \ntrillion-35 trillion m3. Based on experience in the United States, approximately 10% of these CBM \nresources  (3.0-3.5  trillion  m3)  could  be  developed  into  proven  reserves  that  can  be  produced \nthrough surface wells and used as fuel. This is equivalent to about 100 years of the PRC\u2019s current \nnatural gas production rate. \n\n10. \nIn  October  1996,  ADB  provided  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  explore  opportunities  and \nidentify priority areas for developing a CBM demonstration project.12 This was followed in October \n1998 by another ADB-financed TA for the preparation of a commercially viable CMM (production \nand  use)  demonstration  project.13  The  TA  confirmed  the  feasibility  of  establishing  a  CMM \ndemonstration project.14 However, the mining company chose to explore private sector investments \nfor converting the CMM into methanol. This did not constitute the most economic option, and the \nproject  could,  therefore,  no  longer  be  supported  by  the  Government.15    Subsequently,  in  early \n2002,  the  Government  requested  an  expansion  of  the  TA  by  including  the  coal-mining  area  in \nsouthern  Shanxi  Province,  which is operated  by  the  Jincheng  Anthracite  Mining  Group  Company \nLimited  (JMC).  ADB  provided  supplementary  TA  in  June  200216  to  study  this  proposal.  The \nfeasibility study was completed in July 2003. \n\n11.   Shanxi covers 156,000 square kilometers in the north-central PRC and has a population of \nmore than 32 million. The province has mountainous areas, rolling hills, and the loess plateau of \nthe Fen River valley. Major cities in valleys often experience thermal inversions that lead to severe \nair  pollution.  The  provincial  capital,  Taiyuan,  with  about  3  million  people,  is  the  industrial  center. \nShanxi is a poor inland province with a nominal GDP per capita of CNY6,146 in 2002, equivalent to \n75.1%  of  the  national  average  (CNY8,184),  ranking  21st  among  31  provinces.  In  terms  of  urban \nincome per capita, Shanxi ranks 22nd. It accounts for about one third of total coal production in the \nPRC and has many typical examples of the major pollution problems. \n\n12. \nThe air quality of Shanxi is among the worst of any region in the PRC. It includes 3 of the \nPRC\u2019s  10  most  polluted  cities.  The  environmental  problems  are  closely  related  to  the  use  and \ntransport  of  coal.  In  13  of  the  15  cities  reviewed  by  the  Shanxi  Environment  Protection \nAdministration  in  2002,17  annual  daily  average  PM  concentrations  exceeded  class-II  standards  for \nair quality in residential, general industrial, and agricultural areas.18 Based on 2000 data, the national \nclass-III standards for PM in designated industrial zones were exceeded in 10 of these cities, and \nSO2 levels exceeded class-II standards in 12 cities during the same period. Province-wide, 9-10% \n\n                                                 \n11   Foreign oil and gas companies are estimated to have invested more than $90 million in such CBM exploration and \n\n12   ADB.1996.

The  annual  economic  losses  caused  by  pollution  in  2002  exceeded  3%  of  the \nprovincial GDP. Nearly 42% of this loss was caused by air pollution, 36% by water pollution, and \n22% by solid wastes.19 \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n13. \nJincheng  municipality,  located  in  southern  Shanxi,  has  2.11  million  people.  Poverty  is \nwidespread:  about  221,500  are  rural  poor  and  about  97,000  urban  poor.20  The  municipality \nconsumes about 850,000 tons of coal annually, which causes annual emissions of SO2 and PM of \nabout 120,000 tons a year. Air quality is poor, with Class II standards for total PM achieved on only \n29  days  during  2001  and  on  only  59  days  in  2002.  During  the  10th  FYP  the  Jincheng  municipal \ngovernment  (JMG)  is  implementing  various  environmental  improvement  activities  to  receive  the \nGovernment\u2019s designation of \u201cenvironmental model city\u201d by 2005. The Blue Skies program of JMG \nis  a  key  initiative  that  includes  closure  and  relocation  of  heavily  polluting  enterprises;  stricter \nenforcement  of  pollution  control  standards;  establishment  of  district  heating  systems;  and \nintroduction of cleaner fuels, including CMM, which is produced and vented by the numerous coal \nmines around Jincheng. The use of CMM will avoid the coal\u2019s environmentally harmful emissions. \nCMM  and  CBM  are  not  yet  used  on  a  large  commercial  scale  in  the  PRC  and  would  require the \nintroduction  of  new,  proven  technologies  for  improving  the  drainage  and  capture  of  CMM  from \nunderground coal mines, producing CBM from surface wells in advance of mining, and use CMM \nas  a  fuel  for  power  generation.  Better  drainage  and  use  of  CMM  will  help  to  reduce  the  risk  of \nunderground gas (CMM) explosions and support the Government\u2019s program to increase workers\u2019 \nsafety in coal mines. \n\n14. \nThe Sihe mine, with estimated coal reserves of 3.5 billion tons, is owned and operated by \nJMC. This mine was selected as a demonstration project for the large commercial use of CMM and \nCBM,  following  a  detailed  assessment  of  the  CMM  and  CBM  that  could  be  made  available  with \nfurther development. The Sihe mine began operations in early 2002, when about 1.5 million tons of \ncoal (anthracite with a sulfur content of less than 1%) was produced. It produces about 435,000 m3 \nof CMM a day of which about 30% is captured and used and 70% is vented into the atmosphere. \nCoal  production  will  increase  to  8  million  tons  a  year  by  2008,  when  CMM  drainage  (captured \nCMM)  reaches  more  than  500,000  m3  of  CMM  a  day.  CMM  drainage  could  be  considerably \nimproved and expanded, which would reduce mine ventilation costs since less air will need to be \npumped  into  the  mine  to  achieve  an  acceptable  level  of  CMM  concentration  in  the  air \nunderground.21 Well drilling from the surface into the coal seams before underground coal mining \nwill  contribute  to  cost-efficient  capture  of  CMM  once  underground  coal  mining  in  the  area \ncommences. \n\n15. \nThe  Sihe  mine  requires  electricity  to  operate.  Because  the  mine\u2019s  captive  58  MW  coal-\nbased  power  generation  capacity  is  insufficient  to  meet  its  power  requirements,  electricity  is \npurchased  from  the  Shanxi  Electrical  Power  Company.  The  SO2  emissions  from  the  present \ncaptive power plants exceed national standards but are exempted from complying with them since \nthe plants provide heat and power and use low-grade waste coal\u2015a byproduct of coal production \nthat  has  no  market.22    Based  on  the  projected  production  of  CMM  and  CBM  at  the  Sihe  mine,  a  \n\n                                                 \n19   The production of each ton of coal causes a pollution-related economic loss of CNY15, and the generation of each \n\nkilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity causes a loss of CNY0.10. \n\n20   Based on local poverty lines; an annual per-capita net incomes of more than CNY1,000 (weighted average) for rural \n\nareas and CNY1,800 (weighted average) for urban areas.  \n\n21   Additional  efficiency  gains  will  be  achieved  in  terms  of  improved  methane  content  of  the  drained  CMM,  smaller \nrequired diameter of the pipes for draining the CMM, and lower vacuum pump operating costs as a result of the use \nof modern, properly sealed drainage pipes underground.  \n\n22   About 12 MW of this power generation capacity will be decommissioned in 2004, when two additional captive coal-\nbased  power  plants  with  a  combined  capacity  of  100  MW  will  become  operational.    These  plants  will  comply  with \nnational emission standards since they will be equipped with electrostatic precipitators and SO2 scrubbers. \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\n120  MW23  power  plant  using  the  CMM  and  CBM  as  fuel  is  the  least-cost  alternative  for  power \ngeneration  expansion  along  the  Shanxi  power  grid.  The  power  produced  from  the  plant  would \neventually meet about half of JMC\u2019s power requirements and make the construction of additional \npolluting captive coal-based power plants unnecessary. \n\n16.  Many other  underground coal mines around Jincheng produce coal and release a total of \nabout  400  million  m3  of  CMM24  a  year  into  the  atmosphere.  Such  CMM  can  be  used  for  heating \nand cooking use residential, commercial, and industrial consumers in Jincheng and adjacent towns \nand the use of CMM rather than coal will avoid harmful emissions. However, a transmission and \ndistribution  pipeline  system  is  needed  to  transport  CMM  from  the  mines  to  consumers.  Such  a \npipeline system will also promote additional CMM capture by mines since the pipeline system will \nenable them to sell the CMM to consumers.25  \n\n17.  \nThe  Air  Pollution  Control  Law  (amended  in  2000-2001)  provides  the  basis  for  a  rational \nregulatory  framework  to  promote  clean  energy  development  in  an  environment-friendly  manner. \nThe law provides for emission trading, which has been pilot-tested in Taiyuan with ADB support.26 \nEmissions  trading  has  begun  in  Taiyuan  and  the  Shanxi  provincial  government  (SPG)  plans  to \nexpand the trading mechanism to cover the entire province. On a smaller scale, the transmission \nand  distribution  of  CMM  has  been  demonstrated  as  viable  under  the  Shanxi  Environment \nImprovement Project.27  \n\n18. \nA CMM development project that captures CMM and CBM (produced in advance of mining) \nand  avoids  their  release  into  the  atmosphere  has  considerable  potential  to  apply  the  clean \ndevelopment  mechanism  (CDM)  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  (or  similar  mechanism).  External \nagencies  such  as  the  World  Bank,  the  United  Nations  Environmental  Programme,  and  several \nbilateral  agencies  are  actively  involved  in  CDM  related  activities  in  the  PRC.  ADB  is  assisting \nsmall-scale  CDM  development  in  the  PRC.28  Because  of  the  PRC\u2019s  high  potential  for  GHG \nreduction,  several  external  agencies  have  expressed  interest  in  providing  assistance  for  the \nbaseline study that would determine net GHG reductions and, in particular, the certified emission \nreductions (CERs) that  could be generated as a result of the CMMDP. Further assistance in this \nregard will also be provided under ADB\u2019s CDM Facility, which was established in 2003.29  \n\n19. \nThe  CMMDP  will  directly  benefit  about  410,000  people  in  the  urban  Jincheng,  including \nabout  53,700  persons  (about  13%)  who  live  under  the  local  urban  poverty  line.  Increased  use  of \nCMM will allow a gradual decrease in the use of raw coal and briquettes for cooking and heating, \nand  thus  reduce  in-  and  outdoor  air  pollution  (SO2,  CO2,  NOx,  and  PM),  which  causes  serious \nenvironmental and health impacts (respiratory diseases), particularly for the poor. \n\nC. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n20. \nADB\u2019s  overall  experience  in  PRC  energy  and  environment  sector  projects  has  been \npositive.30  Projects  are  generally  well  designed  and  efficiently  implemented,  although  some \ndifficulties have emerged in certain projects, usually from inappropriate policies on energy pricing, \n                                                 \n23   The net effective power generation capacity would be 105.6 MW.  \n24    With an average methane content of 50%. \n25   This opportunity would increase considerably if the CMM transmission pipeline were to be connected with the major \nwest-east  gas  transmission  pipeline,  which  runs  to  the  north  of  Jincheng  and  is  to  transport  natural  gas  from  the \nXinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to eastern PRC. \n\n26   ADB. 2000.

The PRC has ratified the Kyoto Protocol,  which on 16 February 2005 is \nexpected to become legally binding on the 128 countries that have ratified it. \nIts main objective is to bring together and facilitate agreements between sellers and buyers of carbon credits. \n\n29  \n30   Based  on  project  completion  reports  of  completed  ADB  projects  and  performance  of  ongoing  ADB  projects  in  the \nenergy and environment sectors of the PRC. ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department is preparing the first project \nperformance audit report for the Tangshan and Chengde Environmental Improvement Project in the PRC. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nincluding  electricity  and  coal  in  comparison  with  environment-friendly  fuels  such  as  natural  gas, \nrenewable  energy,  and  urban  heat  supply;  and  weak  enforcement  of  environmental  protection \nrequirements:  e.g.,  under  the  Xi\u2019an-Xianyang-Tongchuan  Environmental  Improvement  Project,31 \ntwo  cogeneration  subprojects  were  cancelled  due  to  fuel  price  considerations.  However,  the \ncompleted  Ping  Hu  Oil  and  Gas  Development  Project  has  been  highly  successful  in  substituting \nthe  distribution  and  use of  polluting coal  gas  with  natural  gas  in  Shanghai  and  has shown  that  a \nstrong  commitment  and  preparedness  by  project  components  as  well  as  the  involvement  of \nexperienced and well-trained project implementation staff and competent international consultants \nare important for projects that require the adoption of new technical designs and observance of the \napplicable safety and operating standards.32  Overall, the projects\u2019 general success is attributed to \n(i) extensive preparation before ADB intervention, (ii) high degree of local ownership, (iii) effective \nleadership in project management offices (PMOs), (iv) timely policy and enterprise reforms, and (v) \nfavorable market conditions. Although mobilizing of counterpart funds was sometimes delayed, in \nmost  cases  it  did  not  result  in  unsatisfactory  performance.  Ongoing  market  reforms  and \nrestructuring  of  the  power  sector  make  uncertain  the  continued  financial  viability  of  project \nenterprises,  particularly  those  state-owned,  which  are  in  the  early  stages  of  autonomous  and \ncommercial operations. \n\n21. \nThese  lessons  have  been  taken  into  account  in  project  design  and  preparation.  In \nparticular, the pricing of the electricity and CMM to be produced and consumed under the Project \nhas  been  set  at  appropriate  levels.  Staff  members  of  the  PMO  for  the  CMMDP  and  project \nfor  project \nimplementation  agencies  (PIAs)  have  already  participated \nimplementation and administration, and international consultants will help the PIAs during project \nimplementation.33  The  CMMDP  has  been  discussed  with  other  external  agencies34  involved  or \ninterested in CMM and CBM mitigation, and efficiency and safety improvement activities in the coal \nsector. The CMMDP has also been presented at various conferences and workshops where it was \ndiscussed with private sector parties involved in CBM exploration and development. All support the \nCMMDP and consider it a timely activity that will catalyze for development of the PRC\u2019s CMM and \nCBM  resources.  Appendix  3  summarizes  the  external  assistance  provided  to  improve  the  PRC \nenvironment and, in particular, to develop CBM resources, and improve coal mine safety. \n\nin  ADB \n\ntraining \n\nA.  \n\nObjectives \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nfrom  vertical  surface  wells  and  directionally  drilled  wells \n\n22. \nThe  CMMDP  will  cover  all  aspects  of  effective  and  efficient  CMM  and  CBM  production, \ncapture, and use by applying the latest technologies. The CMMDP will include (i) improved CBM \nproduction \nthe  surface;  \n(ii) improved CMM drainage through the use of underground directional drilling and other modern \nequipment  and  materials;  (iii)  CMM-based  power  generation  using  internal  combustion  gas \nengines;  and  (iv)  transmission  and  distribution  of  CMM  for  residential,  commercial,  and  industrial \nuse.  The  CMMDP  will  also  demonstrate  that  introducing  new  CMM  drainage  methods  and \ntechnology  increases  safety  of  underground  coal  mining  operations  and  provides  environmental \nand health benefits in terms of avoided emissions associated with alternatives if the CMMDP is not \nimplemented  (e.g.,  additional  coal-based  power  generation  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Sihe  mine  and \nrelease of substantial quantities of CMM and CBM into the atmosphere).

CMM  drainage  will  be  improved  through \ndirectional  drilling  of  long  inseam  boreholes  underground  and  installing  CMM  gathering  and \ndrainage  systems.  Degasification  will  take  place  as  result  of  CBM  production  from  surface  wells \ndrilled into coal seams to be developed. This will include (i) drilling of up to 20 vertical wells and 1 \ndirectional  well  from  the  surface  into  coal  seams,  (ii)  constructing  gas  gathering  and  pipeline \ntransportation  systems,  and  (iii)  installing  safety  and  monitoring  systems.    The  power  plant  will \nconsist of internal combustion gas engines with an individual capacity of 1.5-3.5 MW, waste heat \nboilers, and steam turbines for power generation and will be built in two phases of 60 MW each. \nThe  power  plant  will  use  about  182.4  million  m3  of  CMM  and  CBM36  a  year.  Training  will  be \nprovided in underground directional drilling and CMM collection, surface-well development for CBM \nproduction, and operation and maintenance of CMM-fired power plants. Consulting services will be \nprovided  for  project  implementation  and  on-site  training.  The  general  technical  design  of  the \nCMMDP is explained in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nPart B - CMM Transmission and Distribution \n\n25. \nThis component includes all necessary civil works, pipelines, storage tanks, compressors, \nand other equipment required to establish a CMM transmission and distribution pipeline system for \nsupply of CMM to Jincheng and Gaoping cities, and Yangcheng, Zezhou, Lingchuan, and Qinshui \ncounties. In Jincheng, an old pipeline network which distributed waste gas produced by a polluting \nfertilizer  plant37  to  about  7,000  households,  will  be  upgraded  and  expanded.  In  Gaoping  and  the \nother counties, new pipeline systems will be built. By 2008, a total of about 90,000 households38 \nand various industries and commercial establishments will be served with a minimum of`166 million \nm3 of CMM39 a year. \n\n3. \n\nPart C - Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building \n\nInstitutional strengthening  and  capacity  building  will  be  provided  to  JMC,  the  two  PIAs  for \n26. \npart B, the Shanxi Energy CBM Company Limited (SECC)  for the CMM transmission component \nand  the  Jincheng  CMM  Comprehensive  Utilization  Company  Limited  (JCCUC)  for  the  CMM \ndistribution  component,  and  the  Shanxi  Energy  Industries  Group  Limited  (SEIG),  the  parent \ncompany  of  SECC.  Consulting  services  and  training  will  be  provided  in  areas  such  as  financial \nmanagement,  enterprise  reforms  and  governance,  human  resources  development,  performance \nmanagement,  environmental  and  benefits  monitoring,  and  energy  improvement  activities.  In \nparticular, the consultants will help identify specific cost control measures for the PIAs and SEIG. \n \n27. \nShanxi has enormous potential to develop CBM and CMM projects. Consulting services will \nbe  provided  to  strengthen  the  regulatory  framework  for  investing  in  CMM-use  projects  and  the \n\n                                                 \n35   Such a power plant would be the largest in the world based on installed power generation capacity.  \n36   Based on a methane content of 100%. \n37   The fertilizer plant will be closed upon completion of the CMM distribution system. \n38  \n\nIt  is  also  envisaged  that  by  2008  an  additional  20,000  households  will  receive  CMM  that  has  been  transported  by \ntruck to local distribution networks; however, this activity is outside the project scope. \n\n39   Based on average methane content of 50%. \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ncapacity  of  institutions  and  organizations  in  Shanxi  to  appraise  and  evaluate  potential  CMM  and \nCBM  development  projects.  The  CMMDP\u2019s  results  should  be  disseminated  and  other  CMM  and \nCBM projects developed in Shanxi with private sector and other investors, whether from the PRC \nor abroad. The CMMDP will also provide training and consulting services in these areas. \n\nC.  \n\nSpecial Features \n\nPotential Benefits from the Clean Development Mechanism \n\n1. \nThe CMMDP has clear and appropriate CDM additionality,40 as it will (i) help remove policy \n28. \nbarriers to CMM and CBM development in the PRC, (ii) remove technological barriers to efficient \nextraction  and  production  of  CMM  and  CBM,  and  (iii)  remove  financial  barriers  for  financing \nmedium-  to  large-scale  CMM-based  power  generation.  Based  on  current  and  projected  gas \nproduction  and  use  rates,  a  minimum  of  4.4  million  tons  of  CO2  equivalent  (CO2e)  emission \nreductions a year will be achieved upon completion  of the CMMDP. The World Bank\u2019s Prototype \nCarbon Fund has agreed in principle with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to purchase 3 million tons \nCO2e in emission reductions from the CMM-fired power plant under the CMMDP, at $4.25 per ton \nof  CO2e,  for  a  total  contract  value  of  about  $12.75  million.  The  emission  reductions  would  be \npurchased  from  the  date  of  start  of  operations  of  the  power  plant,  which  is  scheduled  for  early \n2006,  until  2012,  and  would  initially  be  traded  as  verified  emission  reductions  (VERs).41  The \nPrototype Carbon Fund, with assistance from Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), has \nprepared a project design document for this purpose and submitted it to the CDM executive board \nfor  approval.  If  the  CMMDP  fulfills  all  requirements  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  and  clearance  of  such \nsale  is  obtained  from  the  CDM  executive  board,  additional  CERs  that  can  be  generated  by  the \nCMMDP  could  be  offered  to  other  potential  buyers.  ADB  is  planning  to  help  MOF  sell  additional \nCERs from part A, and develop the CDM potential of part B. The relationship between the CMMDP \nand CDM is presented in more detail in Appendix 4.  \n\n2. \n\nMaximizing the CMMDP\u2019s Impact on the Poor \n\n29. \nThe CMMDP will create about 1,200 full-time jobs during construction and 845 during the \noperation. During the construction, 780 positions, with an estimated CNY8.5 million in wages, will \nbe  filled  by  the  poor  and  women.  During  operations,  420  jobs  representing  CNY4.6  million  of \nwages per year will go to the poor and women. As a result of ADB policy dialogue, JMC and SECS \nare planning to undertake a number of poverty reduction projects for local communities, which in \nthe case of JMC will be financed from the income generated from the CMM-fired power plant (see \npara. 59). 42  \n\n3. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\nAfter the CMMDP has been completed and has demonstrated that a CMM-fired power plant \n30. \ncan  be  operated  successfully  in  conjunction  with  ongoing  coal  mining  activities,  the  potential  for \nprivate sector participation in plant operation will be considerable. There is considerable potential \nto increase the power plant\u2019s installed capacity as the demand for power is expected to increase in \nthe  coming  years.  The  Government  plans  to  amend  the  electricity  law  to  improve  the  regulatory \nframework  to  commercialize  power  generation  to  attract  more  private  investors.  Private  sector \nparticipation in the CMM-fired power plant would be realistic if sufficient progress were made in the \nongoing  restructuring  and  reorganization  of  major  coal  companies  into  9\u201310  large  national  ones, \nfollowed by their (partial) privatization; closure of small coal mines; and further deregulation of the \ncoal prices. Private sector participation in part B is not very attractive given the small scale of gas \n                                                 \n40   Reductions in emissions by sources of GHG that would occur in the absence of the proposed project activity. \n41   Prior to registration of the Project with the CDM Executive Board emission reductions generated by the Project are \nconsidered  VERs.  After  registration  the  Project  will  generate  emission  reductions  certified  by  the  CDM  Executive \nBoard, i.e., CERs.  \n\n42   Further,  ADB  is  processing  a  project  of  $500,000,  which  is  to  be  financed  by  the  Department  for  International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom, to provide assistance for the training of laid-off miners for other jobs and skills \ndevelopment of new miners to enable them to be employed in mechanized mines.  \n\n \n\n\ftransmission  and  distribution  and  the  expected  returns.  Options  for  private  sector  participation  in \nthe CMM-fired power plant will be identified by the consultants to be recruited under part C and an \naction  plan  for  attracting  such  participation  will  be  developed  by  2006.43  Similarly,  a  number  of \nsmaller  private  coal  mines  in  the  project  area  are  expected  to  opt  to  establish  CMM-fired  power \nplants with private sector investments after the CMMDP demonstrates the successful operation of \nthe power plant.  \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n31. \nProject  cost  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at \n$237 million equivalent including physical and price contingency allowances and interest and other \ncharges  during  construction.  Foreign  exchange  costs  are  estimated  at  $139.9  million  and  local \ncurrency  costs  at  $97.1  million  equivalent.

The  ADB  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term  including a  grace  period  of  4  years,  an interest \nrate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions as \nset forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these \nterms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision \nand not made relying on any communication or advice from ADB. JBIC will provide a parallel loan \nof $20 million to finance the foreign exchange cost of CMM and CBM production under part A. The \nJBIC loan is expected to have a 24-year repayment period, including a grace period of 4 years, an \ninterest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  JBIC\u2019s  LIBOR-based  basic  interest  rate \napplicable  for  untied  loans  to  the  PRC  denominated  in  USDollars,  no  front-end  fee,  and  a \ncommitment  fee  of  0.5%  per  annum,  and  such  terms  and  conditions  that  will  be  set  forth  in  the \nJBIC loan agreement. The United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) has provided a \ngrant of $500,000 to finance international and domestic consulting services for construction of the \nCMM-fired  power  plant.  The  remaining  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $2.6  million  and  local  cost  of \n$96.5 million equivalent will be financed through equity contributions from JMC, SEIG, and JMG in \nthe  total  amount  of  $61.2  million  equivalent,  and  a  loan  of  $37.9  million  equivalent  from  the \nIndustrial Commercial Bank of China. The Borrower will be the PRC, and loan proceeds will be re-\nlent through MOF to SPG, which in turn will on-lend part of these loan proceeds to JMC and SECC \nthrough  on-lending  agreements  with  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  loan.  For \nimplementation  of  the  CMM  distribution  component,  SPG  will  channel  another  part  of  the  loan \n                                                 \n43   The  action  plan  will  be  discussed  between  SPG  and  ADB  during  a  mid-term  review  of  the  Project,  scheduled  for \n\nearly 2007.  \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nproceeds  to  JMG  for  on-lending  to  JCCUC  under  a  third  onlending  agreement,  which  again  will \nincorporate  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  the  head  loan.  The  foreign  exchange  and  interest \nvariation  risks  of  the  loan  will  be  borne  by  the  PIAs.  The  signing  of  the  three  on-lending \nagreements  between  SPG  and  JMC,  SPG  and  SECC,  and  JMG  and  JCCUC,  in  form  and \nsubstance satisfactory  to  ADB,  will  be  a  condition  of  loan  effectiveness.

The CMMDP will be implemented by three PIAs. JMC \nwill implement Part A and has established an independent company unit (JMC-CU) to operate the \npower  plant.  SECC,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  SEIG,  will  implement  and  operate  the  CMM \ntransmission component, and JCCUC, wholly-owned by JMG, will implement and operate the CMM \ndistribution component under Part B. The PMO, in consultation with the PIAs, will implement part \nC. Each PIA will establish a project implementation office (PIO) headed by a director and staffed by \nadequate  personnel  to  supervise  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  subprojects.  The  PMO's \nresponsibilities  include  (i)  overall  coordination,  macro-level  project  management,  and  monitoring, \nincluding  implementation  of  policy  reforms  and  other  institutional  measures,44  (ii)  annual  budget \npreparation  and  monitoring  of  the  use  of  loan  proceeds;  (iii)  quality  assurance;  (iv)  progress \nreporting  to  SPG  and  ADB,  including  reports  on  cost  management,  project  impact,  and \nenvironmental  impact  assessment;  (v)  interagency  coordination  and  procurement  support;  (vi) \nfacilitation of training; (vii) ensuring of compliance with loan covenants, and (viii) development and \nmaintenance  of  a  project  Internet  site  to  provide  public  access  to  basic  information  about  project \nactivities, the status of the implementation schedule, procurement process, and resettlement plans. \nThe PMO is developing a Website that will provide information about all aspects of the CMMDP to \ninterested  parties,  including  its  general  design  and  objectives,  construction  and  progress \nschedules,  procurement  arrangements  and  packages,  required  consulting  services,  and  CDM \npotential. JBIC and ADB will coordinate implementation of the various project components. SPG, \nJBIC, and ADB are envisaged to conduct a midterm review of the CMMDP in early 2007.  \n                                                 \n44   A steering  committee  chaired  by  a  provincial  vice-governor  has  been  established  to  provide  guidance  and  policy \ndirection in the preparation and implementation of the Project. The steering committee comprises senior officials of \nthe concerned departments in Shanxi Province and Jincheng. \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\n \nThe  PIOs  are  responsible  for  administration,  financial,  and  technical  supervision  of  the \n34. \nsubprojects and their implementation. The PIOs will manage (i) day-to-day implementation of their \ncomponents;  (ii)  engagement  of  consultants;  (iii) coordination  with  the  concerned  domestic \nprocurement agency; (iv) submission of all procurement and related documents for ADB approval; \n(v) preparation and evaluation of bids and recommendations on award of contracts; (vi) preparation \nand submission of quarterly reports on the subprojects, and financial statements of the enterprises \nto  ADB;  (vii)  procurement  of  equipment  and  materials  financed  under  local  currency  funds;  (viii) \nmanagement  and  reporting  of  the  human  resource  development  and  training  programs;  (ix) \nsupervision of civil works, installation, and commissioning of the subproject facilities; and (x) liaison \nwith concerned government agencies as required.  \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nConstruction of project facilities is envisaged to take 4 years, from early 2005 to the end of \n35. \n2008. The site for the CMM-fired power plant has been prepared, and routing of CMM transmission \nand  distribution  pipelines  and  the  location  of  the  related  facilities  have  been  finalized.  A  Project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n36. \nADB-financed procurement will include the procurement  of equipment, materials, and civil \nworks. Under part A, ADB-financed procurement will include the supply of all internal combustion \ngas engines, including auxiliary equipment, that will be used for power generation and the supply \nof  power  transmission  lines.  JMC  will  undertake  the  procurement  of  all  other  required  equipment \nand goods for the power plant as well as the construction of all related civil works. JBIC-financed \nequipment,  materials,  and  technical  services  for  CMM  and  CBM  production  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with procurement procedures agreed between the Borrower and JBIC and acceptable \nto  ADB.45  Under  part  B,  ADB-financed  procurement  for  the  CMM  transmission  component  will \ninclude the procurement of pipes, equipment, and materials as well as the selection of civil works \ncontractors  for  construction  of  the  control  center  and  gas  gathering  stations  while  for  the  CMM \ndistribution  component  it  will  include  the  procurement  of  pipes,  valves,  regulators,  storage  tanks, \nand other related equipment. All goods and civil works to be procured under the CMMDP that are \nto be wholly or partly financed by ADB, will be procured in accordance with the ADB's Guidelines \nfor Procurement under Asian Development Bank Loans. Most items that will be financed by ADB \nwill  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  through \nseparate tenders using ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents. ICB bid packages have been identified \nfor  this  purpose.  Other  items  costing  less  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  ADB\u2019s \ninternational shopping (IS) procedures. The selection of the civil works contractors for construction \nof the control center and gas gathering stations for the CMM transmission component under part B \nwill be done on the basis of local competitive bidding (LCB) and the indirect foreign exchange cost \nof  the  contracts  will  be  financed  from  the  ADB  loan.46  All  other  civil  works  construction  activities \nunder the CMMDP will be financed from local currency funds. All procurement activities under the \nCMMDP  irrespective  of  the  source  of  financing  will  be  managed  by  domestic  procurement \nagencies selected by the PIAs. These are well qualified to perform these tasks and have previous \nexperience in other externally funded projects. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy \nwill be included in all documents and contracts during bidding and implementation of the CMMDP. \nItems financed by the PIAs with local currency funds will be procured following bidding procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB.    A  list  of  indicative  procurement  packages  to  be  financed  by  ADB  is  in \nAppendix 7. \n\n                                                 \n45  \n\nIncluding drilling machines, CMM drainage pumps, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes and fittings, HDPE pipe \nfusion machines, and services for vertical drilling of up to 20 CBM wells and directional drilling of 1 CBM well. \n\n46   Each contract is estimated at less than $1 million equivalent and the indirect foreign exchange costs are estimated at \n\n50% of the respective contract amounts. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n37. \nUnder part A, ADB will provide 18 person-months of international and 65 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services to assist JMC supervise CMM drainage and CBM production. At the \nsame time USTDA will provide a grant of about $500,000 to fund 12 person-months of international \nand  8  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  to  help  JMC  (i)  select  the  most  efficient \ndetailed design for the power plant, (ii) procure the required equipment and materials for the power \nplant, and (iii) supervise construction and commissioning of the first phase of 60 MW. Under part B, \nADB  will  provide  6  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  28  person-months  of \ndomestic  consulting  services47  to  assist  SECC  and  JCCUC  with  project  management  and \nimplementation. Under part C, ADB will provide 14 person-months of international and 40 person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services48  for  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  in \nJMC, SEIG, SECC, and JCCUC, and for promoting the development of additional CBM and CMM \nprojects  in Shanxi.  The  international  consultants  to  be  financed  by  ADB  under  parts  A,  B,  and  C \nwill  be  provided  through  three  separate  packages.  Their  services  will  be  provided  through  the \nselection  of  a  consulting  firm  for  each  package  following  the  submission  of  simplified  technical \nproposals (and financial proposals) and the use of the quality- and cost-based selection method in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Selection  and  engagement  of \ndomestic  consultants  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The \nproposed outline terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n38. \nSPG will adopt any of the following disbursement procedures for withdrawal of proceeds of \nthe loan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook: (i) a direct payment procedure, \nwherein ADB, at the request of the PMO, pays a designated beneficiary directly; (ii) a commitment \nprocedure,  wherein  ADB,  at  the  request  of  the  PMO,  provides  an  undertaking  to  reimburse  a \ncommercial bank for payments made or to be made to a supplier against a letter of credit financed \nfrom the loan account; or an imprest account procedure, wherein ADB, at the request of the PMO, \nadvances  funds  to  the  concerned  PIAs  for  payment  of  civil  works  contracts,  local  consultants,  or \ntraining. The initial amount to be deposited to the imprest account will be based on projected six-\nmonths expenditures or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The statement of expenditure \nprocedure may be used to liquidate or replenish advances to the imprest account or reimburse any \neligible  expenditures  for  any  individual  payment  not  to  exceed  $200,000.  The  reimbursement \nprocedure will be used for disbursements with regard to any eligible retroactive financing. \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n39. \nIn view of the advanced stage of project preparation, ADB has agreed to (i) advance action \nto procure internal combustion gas engines from 18 March 2004, and (ii) retroactive financing for \neligible  expenses  incurred  and  paid  for  with  regard  to  consulting  services  and  procurement  of \ninternal combustion gas engines up to $10 million from 18 March 2004.49 The Borrower and SPG \nhave  been  advised  that  the  advance  actions  and  retroactive  financing  do  not  commit  ADB  to \nfinancing the CMMDP. \n\n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n40. \nThe accounting, auditing, and reporting systems and procedures for the CMMDP will be in \naccordance  with  the  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment \nProjects Financed by ADB. Each PIA will maintain separate accounts of the operations of its part of \nthe CMMDP and submit through the PMO to ADB audited project accounts and agency financial \n                                                 \n47   The  domestic  consultants  engaged  under  Parts  A  and  B  will  each  include  10  person-months  to  develop   \nbenchmarks  and  indicators  for  measurement  of  the  economic,  social,  and  environmental  impact  of  the  respective \nparts of the Project. \n\n48   This component also includes a provision for procurement of computers and related equipment. \n49   The advance action was published in the electronic version of ADB Business Opportunities of 10 September 2004 \n\nand in its printed version of mid-October 2004.  \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nstatements, including a management letter, in English not later than 9 months after the end of each \nof  the  first  two  financial  years  and  not  later  than  6  months  after  the  end  of  subsequent  financial \nyears.  The  Government,  SPG,  and  the  PIAs  have  been  informed  about  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nsubmission  of  audited  financial  statements  and  possible  penalties  for  delays  in  submission.  The \nsubmitted  audited  project  accounts  and  agency  financial  statements  should  be  of  acceptable \nquality and should be prepared in accordance with internationally accepted accounting standards. \nFinancial  statements  with  adverse  opinions  or  disclaimers  from  auditors  are  considered \nunacceptable and cannot be submitted for this purpose. SPG and the PIAs through the PMO will \nalso  submit  to  ADB  reports  and  information  concerning  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds,  project \nimplementation,  and  the  performance  of  each  PIA.  The  reports  will  include  (i) quarterly  progress \nreports on project implementation, and (ii) a project completion report not later than 3 months after \ncompletion  of  the  project  facilities.  The  PIAs  will  finance  the  annual  audits  to  be  carried  out  by \nauditing firms with experience and qualifications acceptable to ADB. \n\n \n\n8. \n\nAnticorruption \n\n41. \nDuring project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to provincial and local \ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added to \nthe ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. ADB\u2019s program \nfor the PRC includes assistance that will improve governance and provide incentives to reduce the \nincidence  of  corruption  in  the  longer  term.  SPG  will  take  the  following  anticorruption  actions:  (i) \ninvolve full-time officials from SPG to periodically review, together with staff of the PMO, the PIAs, \nand  the  concerned  tendering  companies;  bidding  process;  delivery  of  equipment  and  materials; \nand  installation,  construction,  and  operation;  (ii)  introduce  a  dual-signing  system,  in  which  the \nwinning  bidder  for  a  civil  works  contract  also  signs  an  anticorruption  contract  with  the  employer; \nand  (iii)  periodically  inspect  of  civil  works  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and \nsettlements. \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nA Project Performance Management System (PPMS) was developed by SPG. The PPMS \n42. \nincludes a set of measurable indicators that were developed based on project design, impacts, and \nrisks. The macroeconomic and sector performance, institutional capacity, and reforms were taken \ninto  account  in  designing  the  monitoring  indicators.  These  indicators  are  presented  in  the  project \nframework  (Appendix  1)  They  cover  environmental  impacts  such  as  reduction in  GHG,  PM,  SO2, \nand  NOx  emissions,  and  improvement  of  air  quality;  institutional  indicators  such  as  operational, \nfinancial, and corporate performance of the PIAs; expansion of the CMMDP\u2019s scope, replication of \nthe  CMMDP  at  other  mines;  mobilization  of  private  sector  investments  in  similar  projects;  social \nand  poverty  impacts  focusing  on  new  job  creation,  number  of  poor  households  connected  to  the \nCMM  distribution  system;  CMM  consumption  by  poor  households;  and  tariffs  applied  to  CMM \nconsumption  by  such  households.  A  feedback  and  reporting  mechanism  for  effective  project \nimplementation  and  initial  startup  activities,  including  a  baseline  survey  based  on  a  random \nhousehold sample to be monitored with follow-up surveys, was included in the PPMS. Consultants \nto  be  recruited  under  part  C  of  the  CMMDP  will  help  monitor  and  evaluate  the  indicators  during \nproject  implementation.  They  will  also  help  develop  a  monitoring  plan  for  the  period  after  project \nimplementation. A copy of the PPMS is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\na. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n \n\ni. \n\nJincheng Anthracite Mining Group Company Limited  \n\n43. \nJMC is wholly owned by SPG and  the largest company involved in the CMMDP.  Its main \nactivities  are  coal  mining,  engineering  and  construction,  real  estate  development,  printing  and \npublishing,  production  of  chemicals,  and  power  generation.  JMC  has  assets  totaling  about \nCNY12.1  billion  as  of  the  end  of  2003  and  a  local  credit  rating  of  AAA,  based  on  past  financial \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nperformance and timely repayments of existing loans. JMC made significant investments of about \n$700 million during 2001-2003 that were largely financed through new equity injection (about 51%) \nand internal cash generation (about 19%). Over recent years, JMC has been moderately profitable, \nmainly as a result of an increase in the price of coal. With limited borrowing JMC\u2019s debt-to-equity \nratio  decreased  from  about  80%  in  2000  to  about  55%  in  2003.  The  debt  service  coverage  ratio \nimproved  from  a  low  of  0.8  times  in  2000,  to  about  1.7  times  in  2003.  In  2003  JMC  recorded  a \nprofit  of  about  CNY6.4  million  and,  with  increasing  demand  for  coal,  is  expected  to  remain \nprofitable.  \n\nii. \n\nShanxi  Energy  Industries  Group  Limited  and  Shanxi  Energy  CMM \nUtilization Company Limited  \n\n44. \nSEIG, the parent company of SECC, the PIA for the CMM transmission component under \npart B, is a holding company with its headquarters in Taiyuan. SEIG is wholly owned by SPG and \nhas assets totaling about CNY741.6 million as of the end of 2003, including 24 subsidiaries, most \nof which transport coal and engage in other coal-related business. SEIG made a profit in 2001 but \nin  2000,  2002,  and  2003,  it  incurred  losses,  based  on  net  results  from  the  operations  of  its \nsubsidiaries.  The  SARS50  epidemic,  which  banned  coal  transportation  for  3  months  in  2003,  and \naccidents in older coal mines, were two key reasons for the poor financial performance. SECC is \nexpected  to  generate  about  CNY110.2  million  in  revenues  by  2009,  representing  about  20%  of \nSEIG\u2019s overall revenues. A financial covenant requiring SECC to maintain a satisfactory operating \nratio  has  been  included  in  the  relevant  loan  documents.  This  will  enable  monitoring  of  SECC\u2019s \nprogress and capacity development for adequate cash generation. Support in this area will also be \nprovided under part C. \n \nAt present, SEIG has adequate resources that could be used for further investments and is, \n45. \ntherefore,  in  a  position  to  make  the  required  equity  contribution  to  SECC  to  ensure  its  sound \nfinancial  operations.  With  regard  to  SECC,  the  present  CMM  production  capacity  at  the  29  coal \nmines  around  Jincheng,  which  have  been  targeted  to  supply  CMM,  is  about  twice  the  projected \ndemand for CMM under part B. SECC\u2019s long term strategy is to be able to purify, concentrate, and \npressurize the excess CMM up to pipeline-quality standard to make it suitable for injection into the \nmajor west-to-east gas transmission pipeline.  \n\niii.  Jincheng CMM Comprehensive Utilization Company Limited \n\n46. \nJCCUC  has  been  established  as  a  new  company  that  is  wholly  owned  by  JMG.  During \nproject  implementation,  JMG  will  be  able  to  make  the  required  equity  contribution  to  JCCUC  to \nensure its sound financial operations. JCCUC will receive the assets, including an existing pipeline \nworth  CNY60  million,  from  the  Jincheng  Municipal  Gas  Company  Limited,  which  will  cease \noperations upon completion of the CMM distribution system.  \n \n47. \nA  summary  of  the  past  and  projected  financial  performance  of  JMC  and  the  financial \nprojections  of  the  JMC-CU,  SECC,  and  JCCUC  are  in  Appendix  8.  The  detailed  tables  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n\nb. \n\nEnvironmental Measures \n\nThe CMMDP is classified as environment category \u201cB\u201d. An initial environmental examination \n48. \nhas  been  prepared.  Anticipated  environmental  impacts  during  construction  are:  dust  generation, \nsoil  erosion,  disturbance  of  vegetation,  and  risk  of  gas  leaks  during  drilling.  Impacts  during \noperations  are:  emissions  from  the  proposed  power  plant,  and  potential  gas  leakage  from \ntransmission  and  distribution  pipelines.  The  anticipated  impacts  will  be  successfully  mitigated  in \naccordance with existing PRC environmental standards. The CMMDP will not impact any sensitive \nor  endangered  species:  two  nature  preserves  in  Jincheng  are  more  than  5  kilometers  from  the \n\n                                                 \n50   Severe acute respiratory syndrome. \n \n\n\f15 \n\nCMMDP facilities. The CMMDP will have net positive environmental benefits: improved indoor and \noutdoor air quality, reduced potential for acid precipitation, and reduction of GHG emissions. The \nEnvironmental  Impact  Assessment  reports  prepared  by  JMC  and  SEIG  for  the  CMM-fired  power \nplant  and  the  CMM \ntransmission  pipeline  system  have  been  approved  by  the  Shanxi \nEnvironmental  Protection  Administration  and  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration.  \nThe summary initial environmental examination is presented in Appendix 9. \n\nc. \n\nSocial Issues and Poverty Reduction \n\nThe construction of the CMMDP will affect 262 households51 or 999 persons, according to \n49. \nthe resettlement plans. In total, 29.49 hectares (ha) will be permanently acquired as a result of the \nCMMDP,  of  which  69.07%  or  20.37  ha  is  farmland.  The  CMMDP  will  also  require  the  temporary \nacquisition  of  308.69  ha  of  land  and  lease  of  9.36  ha.  About  6,135  m2  of  houses  will  be \ndemolished.  The  total  cost  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  estimated  at  $9.49  million \n(CNY78.77 million) in 2004 prices. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts have been identified \nand  separate  resettlement  plans  for  parts A  and  B  prepared,  addressing  major  issues  related  to \nentitlements,  compensation  and  rehabilitation  of  affected  people.  The  PIAs  have  submitted  the \nresettlement  plans  to  ADB  and  confirmed  that  the  resettlement  information  booklets  were \ndistributed  to  the  affected  people  in  September  2003. The  resettlement  plans  were  placed  in  the \noffices of the affected village committees in November 2003. The resettlement plans were posted \non  ADB's  resettlement  Website  in  September  2004.  The  summary  resettlement  plan  is  in  \nAppendix 10. \n\n50. \nThe Government, SPG, and PIAs will ensure that all affected people are compensated and \nresettled on time and adequately in accordance with the resettlement plan so that they will be at \nleast as well off as they would have been without the CMMDP. A mechanism has been established \nto consult with affected people throughout land acquisition and resettlement. The executing agency \nand  PIAs  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  progress  of  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan \nthrough  the  quarterly  progress  reports.  SPG  will  engage  an  independent  agency  to  monitor  and \nevaluate  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  implementation.  The  monitor  will  submit  a  monitoring \nand  evaluation  report  (for  each  component)  to  ADB  upon  completion  of  the  compensation  and \nresettlement activities, and 1 year thereafter to ensure that affected people have been adequately \nrehabilitated. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \n\nThe  CMMDP  includes  economic,  financial,  environmental,  and  social  assessments.  The \n\n51. \nintegrated benefits and impacts outweigh the associated costs. \n \nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability  \n\n1. \n\nLeast-Cost Assessment and Economic Viability \n\nConsultants  recruited  under  the  ADB-financed  TA  have  reviewed  the  CMMDP\u2019s  demand \n52. \nforecast  and  concluded  that  the  risk  associated  with  it  is  minimal  (Supplementary  Appendix  E). \nThey have also produced a demand forecast for electricity consumption in the Shanxi power grid \nfor  the  short  term  (3 years)  and  the long  term  (up  to  2020) on  a  sector basis. The demand-  side \nmanagement  measures,  including  implementation  of  time-of-day  tariffs  based  on  the  long-run \nmarginal  cost,  were  taken  into  account  in  the  short-  and  long-term  forecasts.  A  gas  demand \nforecast was also prepared by the executing agency and found acceptable by the consultants. \n \nBased  on  the  energy  demand  forecast,  the  consultants  carried  out  least-cost  generation \n53. \nexpansion planning. The analysis shows that the planned phased commissioning of the CMM-fired \n\n                                                 \n51  \n\nIncluding  two  minority  (Hui)  households who  will  be  affected  by  the  land  acquisition and  resettlement  due  to  the \nconstruction of CBM/CMM transmission and distribution pipeline system under Part B.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\npower  plant  under  the  CMMDP  is  supported  by  the  least-cost  generation  expansion  plan  for  the \nShanxi  power  grid.  The  analysis  used  constant  2003  prices  and  a  discount  rate  of  12%.  Tradable \ncommodities  were  valued  at  border  prices  at  the  prevailing  exchange  rate  (CNY8.3/$1.0).  Non-\ntradable commodities were valued at shadow prices, using a mix of standard and specific conversion \nfactors.52  Two  least-cost  generation  expansion  alternatives  for  the  Shanxi  power  grid  were \nconsidered.  The  results  indicate  that  the  least-cost  generation  expansion  scenario  including  the \nCMMDP compares favorably with the one without it. The result of the least-cost analysis is supported \nby equalizing discount rate analysis.53 The equalizing discount rate shows that the CMM-fired power \nplant is superior up to a discount rate of 18.0%, compared with the alternative of locating the coal-\nfired thermal plant in the load center. \n \n54. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for each project component and \nfor  the  CMMDP  as  a  whole.  As  in  the  least-cost  analysis,  the  economic  analysis  applied  the \nconversion  factors  to  costs  for  investment  in  land,54  equipment,  fuel,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance,55  where  applicable.  For  the  EIRR  calculations,  the  project  benefits  mainly  include:  \n(i)  incremental  electricity  and  gas  outputs  and  more  efficient  gas  supply,  (ii)  cost  savings  from \nmeeting existing demand, and (iii) local environmental benefits. \n \n55. \nThe  EIRR  calculation  takes  into  account  only  the  main  benefits  but  includes  all  project-\nrelated costs. Including the local environmental benefits, this approach yields an EIRR of 21.1% for \npart  A,  27.5%  for  part  B,  and  23.4%  for  the  whole  CMMDP  (Appendix  11).  Sensitivity  analyses \nwere  performed  for  the  above  EIRRs.  For  the  EIRR  of  the  whole  CMMDP,  sensitivity  analysis \nshowed the EIRR would decrease to (i) 19.3% if the CMMDP were to experience a cost overrun of \n20%; (ii) 15.3% if the benefits were reduced by 20%; (iii) 20.8% if the CMMDP were to experience \na commissioning delay of one year; and (iv) 10.6% if all scenarios occurred. \n \n56. \nAn economic evaluation of the environmental impacts of the CMMDP was carried out based \non  the  benefits-transfer  method.  The  evaluation  used  (i)  the  methodology  adopted  in  ADB\u2019s \nWorkbook  on  Economic  Evaluation  of  Environmental  Impacts  (1996)  to  determine  the  adjusted \nestimate  of  the  monetary  damages  caused  by  air  pollution  during  the  study  period,  taking  into \naccount  the  location  of  the  pollution  sources,  the  emission  level,  and  population  affected;  and  \n(ii)  estimates  of  average  annual  climate  change  for  carbon  emissions  to  evaluate  the  monetary \ndamage  caused  by  GHG  emissions  (Supplementary  Appendix  F).  If  the  global  environmental \nbenefits were added to the project benefits, the EIRR for CMM and CBM production and the CMM-\nfired power plant would increase to 30.9%, for CMM transmission and distribution pipeline systems \nto 42.1%, and for the CMMDP as a whole to 34.6%. \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\n57. \nFinancial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  calculated  separately  for  (i)  CMM  and  CBM \nproduction, and CMM-fired power plant components in part A; (ii) transmission component in part \nB, and (iii)  distribution component in part B.  As the CMM-fired power plant will obtain CMM from \nthe  underground  drainage  at  Sihe  mine  and  from  surface  wells,  a  single  FIRR  is  calculated  from \nthe combined cash flows of these three subcomponents and is estimated at 6.2%. FIRRs for the \ntransmission  and  distribution  components  are  7.2%  and  6.9%,  respectively.  The  FIRR  for  the \noverall  CMMDP  is  6.5%.  The  FIRRs  for  the  overall  CMMDP  and  each  component  are  above \n\n                                                 \n52    A  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.93  was  used.  Border  prices  were  used  for  all  imported  items.  Local  costs  were \nshadow  priced  using  group  and  specific  conversion  factors:  1.0  for  equipment,  1.67  for  steel,  0.76  for  cement, \n0.82 for timber, 2.0 for skilled labor, and 0.67 for unskilled labor. Taxes and duties were excluded. \n\n53    The  costs  of  environmental  mitigation  and  the  resettlement  program  have  been  included  in  the  project  cost \n\nestimates. \n\n54   Land is valued at the economic opportunity cost (the estimated value of the best alternative utilization). \n55   Line losses were based on the statistics of historical line loss rates in each city. \n   \n \n\n\f17 \n\nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  estimated  at  4.48%  for  the  overall  CMMDP,  indicating  that  all \ncomponents  are  financially  viable.  The  sensitivity  analysis  showed  that  the  FIRR  of  the  whole \nCMMDP would decrease to (i) 5.6% if the CMMDP were to experience a cost overrun of 10%, (ii) \n5.9%  if  the  benefits  of  all  components  were  reduced  by  10%,  (iii)  5.7%  if  CMMDP  were  to  be \ndelayed  by  1  year,  and  (iv)  3.6%  if  all  scenarios  occur.  Details  of  financial  analysis  and  price \nassumptions are in Appendix 12. \n\nB. \n\nEnvironmental Benefits \n\n58.  \nThe CMMDP will demonstrate the feasibility of using new technologies for commercial CBM \nand  CMM  production,  capture,  and  use,  and  promote  the  development  of  similar  projects  in  the \nPRC. The CMMDP will improve air quality by replacing coal, fuel wood, synthetic \u201cwaste\u201d gas, and \npetroleum-based fuels with CBM and CMM equivalent to about 265 million m3 of methane a year \nupon  completion  of  the  CMMDP  by  the  end  of  2008.  No  reasonable  alternatives  to  the  CMMDP \nwould  achieve  similar  objectives  and  benefits. Natural  gas  reserves  have  not  been  discovered  in \nthe project area, and there are no plans to deliver piped gas to the project area from external gas \nfields. The CMMDP will save about 429,310 tons of coal per year, approximately two thirds from \nclean  power  generation  and  one  third  from  fuel  switching  by  industrial  and  municipal  supply \ncustomers.  Estimated annual emissions reductions are 7,866 tons of PM, 4,901 tons of SO2, 2,077 \ntons of NOx, and 612,058 tons of CO2 due to energy efficiency gains.  Reductions in PM, SO2, and \nNOx emissions will generate local benefits (improved air quality) and regional ones (reduced acid \nprecipitation).  Global  benefits  will  result  from  methane  capture  and  CO2  reductions  generated  by \nfuel switching. Methane capture alone will result in a minimum of 4.4 million tons of CO2e emission \nreductions a year upon completion of the CMMDP. \n\nC. \n\nSocial Benefits \n\n59. \nThe CMMDP will provide social benefits for the poor in terms of (i) providing the poor with \nclean  energy  at  affordable  cost,  (ii)  job  creation,  (iii)  reducing  air  pollution  and  related  health \nimpacts,  (iv)  improving  their  socio-economic  environment,  (v)  improving  occupational  safety  for \nminers,  and  (vi)  improving  their  quality  of  life.  Under  part  A,  JMC  will  undertake  specific  poverty \nreduction  initiatives  such  as  expansion  of  the  Sihe  Mine  Hospital  with  additional  CNY1  million \ninvestment in Jiafeng county in 2004 to serve over 70,000 local community people, including about \n7,000 poor people;56 a provision to reduce medical costs by 15% per person-visit57 for those poor \nliving  under  minimum  living  guarantee;  and  construction  of  a  local  road  with  an  investment  of \nCNY1  million  between  2005  and  2006  to  serve  5,000  people,  including  500  poor  people  in  the \npoverty county where the CMM-fired power plant is located. Under part B, SECC will supply CMM \nto  an  industrial  zone  in  Yangcheng  county,  where  investments  of  about  CNY200  million  will  be \nmade within 5 years, which would provide 3,500 jobs for local poor and women. Following policy \ndialogue between JMC and ADB, it has been agreed that JCCUC will connect poor households for \nfree  to  the  CMM  gas  distribution  pipeline  system  and  will  apply  a  special  pro-poor  CMM  tariff \nscheme  that  reduces  normal  monthly  user  fees  by  about  50%.58  At  the  same  time  JCCUC  will \ncollect the connection fees for all other households, estimated at CNY1,732 per household, over 6 \nmonths. \n\n                                                 \n56   The expansion of the hospital will not only improve the quality and services for local community residents but also be \nable to save transportation costs of CNY26 for each return trip for medical treatment in hospitals of Jiancheng City  \n70 km away, or of Qinshui County 50 km away. \n\n57   This reduction will result in savings of about CNY8 in medical costs per person-visit. \n58   Such a scheme would result in savings of CNY3.124 million in terms of connection fees and CNY0.37 million for the \nfirst  year  in  terms  of  gas  tariffs  for  1,800  poor  households  registered  under  the  minimum  living  guarantee  (MLG) \nprogram of the Jincheng Civil Affairs Bureau. The respective municipal and county finance bureaus will finance the \ncost  of  the  scheme.  Subsequently,  the  connection  exemption  and  gas  tariff  reduction  for  poor  households  will  be \nrenewed on a yearly basis until all poor household in the Project area have been connected to the CMM distribution \nnetwork. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n18 \n\nD. \n\n \n\n60. \nA  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  13.  A  benefit  distribution \nand  poverty  impact  ratio  (PIR)  analysis  was  also  carried  out  to  compute  the  PIR  of  the  CMMDP \n(Supplementary  G).  The  share  of  net  project  economic  benefits  directly  accruing  to  the  poor  is \nestimated at 16.7%.  \n\nAssessment of Project Risks \n\n1. \n\nCMM and CBM Production for Power Generation \n\n61. \nThe CMMDP area is among the highest potential CMM- and CBM-producing areas in terms \nof  methane  in  place  (in  coal  seams).  The  design  of  the  CMM-fired  power  plant  is  based  on  a \ndetailed  and  conservative  assessment  of  the  CMM  and  CBM  quantities  that  can  reasonably  be \nexpected to be produced during the development of the Sihe mine and has sufficient flexibility to \naccommodate any variations in the supply of CMM and CBM if they occur. In case of shortfalls of \nCMM and CBM supplies to the power plant, JMG\u2019s mines,59 which are a few kilometers from the \npower  plant,  have  adequate  CMM  production capacity  and  could supply  additional CMM  to  meet \nshortfalls. The technical and completion risks associated with the introduction of new technologies \nfor CBM production,60 CMM drainage, and CMM-based power generation have been addressed by \nincluding consulting services for project implementation, including those financed by USTDA, and \nthe requirement that the supplier of the internal combustion gas engines under the CMMDP will be \nresponsible  for  supervision  of  the  first  year  of  their  operation  and  maintenance  following  the \ncommissioning of the first 50% of total power generation capacity. The power plant will be operated \non  a  captive  basis  to  reduce  sensitivity  to  electric  tariffs  and,  in  principle,  will  only  produce \nelectricity for the Sihe mine. However, the electricity tariff of the power plant of CNY0.234/kWh is \nlower  than  the  average  tariff  of  the  Shanxi  power  grid\u2019s  average  tariff  of  CNY0.29/kWh,  and  the \npower  plant  will  be  able  to  sell  electricity  to  the  grid  in  case  the  mine\u2019s  demand  for  power  is \nreduced. The establishment of JMC-CU as a separate company unit with an agreed purchase price \nfor the CMM and CBM and an agreed sales price to the Sihe mine for the power produced, thus \nensuring transparency and financial sustainability of its operations. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nCMM Transmission and Distribution \n\n62. \nThe construction and operation of the CMM transmission and distribution system is based \non  a  detailed  technical  design  and  known  technologies.  The  various  coal  mines  in  the  vicinity  of \nJincheng produce CMM in excess of what is required to meet the projected CMM demand under \nthe  CMMDP.  SECC  has  finalized  CMM  purchase  agreements  with  a  sufficient  number  of  coal \nmines  to  ensure  adequate  CMM  supplies  and  has  assigned  the  contracts  to  SECC,  while  SECC \nhas finalized a CMM sales contract with JCCUC. The establishment of SECC as a separate entity \nwill ensure financial sustainability of the operation of the pipelines. Obtaining right-of-way approval \nfor  construction  and  operation  of  the  transmission  pipelines  and  the  feeder  pipelines  from  the \nvarious  coal  lines  to  the  transmission  pipelines  is  not  expected  to  be  difficult  since  the  pipelines \nlargely  run  through  sparsely  populated  areas  and  sufficient  funds  for  compensation  have  been \nmade available in accordance with the resettlement plan. The tariffs for CMM consumption are in \nline with the present tariffs for the synthetic \u201cwaste\u201d gas, which is distributed in Jincheng, and the \nprojected demand for CMM is expected to exceed supplies. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nOverall Project \n\nTo fully assess the potential project risks, a probabilistic risk analysis was performed using \n63. \nthe Monte Carlo simulation technique based on 3,000 simulations for the EIRR and FIRR analyses. \nThe  risk  variables  were  selected  because  of  their  significant  impact  on  the  CMMDP\u2019s  economic \nand financial viability. The risk analysis for the EIRR selected five risk factors: outputs, capital cost, \n\n                                                 \n59  \n\nIncluding mines that are operated by Qin River Coal Industry Stock Company Limited, which at present vent about \n200,000 m3 of CMM a day. \n\n60   The  CBM  well  development  program  is  to  be  periodically  reviewed  to  ensure  that  the  CBM  wells  will  produce  as \n\nmuch gas as feasible.  \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\nimplementation delay, exchange rate, and local environmental benefits. The expected EIRR, based \non the weighted average of all simulated combinations, is 22.6%, about 0.8% lower than the base \ncase  value  without  consideration  of  project  risks.  The  results  indicate  that  the  expected  FIRR  is \n6.5%, about 0.4% lower than the base case value without consideration of project risks. \n  \nPoverty is associated with vulnerability. The dimension of risk in poverty assessment is of \n64. \nsignificance  since  the  poor  are  the  most  vulnerable  to  unexpected  unfavorable  outcomes.  Seven \nrisk  factors  in  the  PIR  analysis  have  been  selected  as  the  crucial  risk  variables  because  of  their \nsignificant  impact  on  the  PIR,  including  financial  and  economic  costs;  financial  benefits  and \neconomic  benefits;  and  the  shares  of  consumer  surplus,  government  net  benefits,  and  labor \nsurplus to the poor. The assumed probability distributions were discussed and carefully reviewed \nby the project preparation TA consultants. The expected PIR is 15.9%, 0.8% lower than the base-\ncase value without consideration of risks, and still higher than the share of the poor in the project \narea  (13.1%).  Even  with  pessimistic  assumptions,  the  probability  of  a  negative  outcome  for  the \npoor is insignificant (close to zero). The risk analysis on PIR calculation, together with the analysis \non the probability of overall project failure (risk analysis on the EIRRs and FIRRs), concludes that \nthe  probability  for  negative  outcomes  for  the  poor  is  also  minimal.

Since then, these production levels were maintained at slightly \nhigher  levels  in  2001  and  2002,  only  to  increase  sharply  to  about  1.6  billion  tons  in  2003.1  In \n1998 the demand for coal caused the Government to close about 75% of the small coal mines, \nincluding  the  township  and  village  coal  mines  (TVCMs)  and  reduce  their  coal  production  to \nabout 250 million tons a year. At the same time, coal stockpiles increased to about 200 million \ntons and exports increased to about 90 million tons a year while it was expected that given its \nrelatively  low  coal  prices  the  PRC  could  become  a  major  coal  exporter.  However,  since  then \ncoal exports have stalled at 80 million\u201390 million tons a year due increasing domestic demand. \nCoal is expected to continue to account for about 64% of the PRC\u2019s primary commercial energy \nconsumption  and  it  is  projected  that  to  meet  demand  coal  supplies  would  need  to  increase  to \nabout  3.2  billion  tons  a  year  by  2020  if  the  PRC\u2019s  present  growth  rates  and  energy  policies \ncontinue.  Although  the  PRC  has  the  third  largest  coal  reserves  in  the  world  and  such  coal \ndemand could be met from proven domestic coal reserves, many large- and small-scale mines \nare  reaching  the  end  of  their  lifetime  cycle  and  considerable  investments  are  required  to \nincrease domestic coal production. Taking into account the time required to develop new mines \nand  the  additional  investments  required  for  developing  the  required  additional  transportation \ninfrastructure (mainly railways) to transport the coal to consumers a domestic coal supply deficit \ncould occur in the future, which would need to be met from coal imports, in particular in coastal \nprovinces. \n \nB. \n \nTraditionally,  the  Ministry  of  Coal  Industry  was  responsible  for  the  PRC\u2019s  main  coal \n2. \nmines.  However,  this  ministry  was  abolished  in  1996  and  the  responsibility  for  coal  mining, \nincluding  the  large  state-owned  coal  mines,  was  delegated  to  the  concerned  provincial \ngovernments while the Government only maintained a central supervisory role through the State \nAdministration  for  Coal  Industry  (SACI).  Following  further  reorganization  of  the  coal  sector  in \n1998  SACI  was  also  abolished  while  the  Government  only  remained  involved  in  occupational \nsafety aspects of the coal sector through the State Administration of Work Safety. Coal mines in \nthe PRC comprise the following types: \n \n\nStructure of the Coal Sector \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nkey  state-owned  coal  mines  (KSOCMs),  administered  by  the  concerned \nprovincial government; \nlocal  state-owned  coal  mines  (SOCMs),  administered  by  provincial,  prefecture, \nand county governments; and \nTVCMs  (operated  by  private  individuals  or  local  governments  in  townships  and \nvillages).  \n\n \nThere  are  about  100  KSOCMs,  of  which  about  33  are  listed  as  key  state  enterprises. \n3. \nThese  mines  mainly  use  mechanized  mining  technologies  and  their  produced  coal  is  mainly \nused in power plants, blast furnaces, steel plants, and large state-owned enterprises. There are \nabout  2,000  SOCMs,  which  are  much  smaller  than  the  KSCOMs  and  are  only  partially \nmechanized.  It  is  estimated  that  there  are  around  23,000  TVCMs,  which  are  characterized  by \n\n                                                 \n1 About 90% of the produced coal is steaming coal and about 10% is coking coal. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nlow  production  levels  and  predominantly  manual  coal  production.  They  mainly  supply  coal  to \nlocal  communities  and  townships.  Before  1982,  domestic  coal  supply  was  mainly  provided  by \nKSCOMs.  It  is  estimated  that  in  2002  the  KSCOMs  employed  about  830,000  persons,  the \nSOCMs about 915,000 persons, and the TVCMs about 220,000 persons.  \n \n4. \nFrom 1983 until 1997, the Government promoted the development of TVCMs to promote \nrural development and meet coal demand in certain areas. The percentage of coal production \nfrom  TVCMs  increased  from  about  18%  in  1980  to  about  45%  of  total  production  in  1996, \nwhereas  during  the  same  period  the  share  of  KSCOMs  decreased  from  about  56%  to  about \n39%. Subsequently, there was a fall again in the relative share the TVCMs in coal production to \nabout  19%  in  2000  when  overall  demand  for  coal  decreased.  It  is  estimated  that  in  2002  with \nincreased coal demand the share of the KSOCMs in coal production was about 51%, the share \nof the SOCMs about 19% and that of the TVCMs about 30%. Over the past decade the TVCMs \ntherefore acted as \u201cswing\u201d coal producers to meet the domestic coal demand. \n \n5. \nThe considerable decreases in annual coal consumption between 1996 and 2001 have \nbeen  largely  the  result  of  the  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  economic  reform  policies \naimed at restructuring of the state owned enterprises and improving their operating and energy \nefficiency and financial status. In particular the Government\u2019s policy to close small enterprises in \nthe coal, power generation, petrochemicals, iron and steel, and construction materials industries \ncontributed  to  more  efficient  use  of  coal  and  hence  a  decrease  in  coal  consumption.  Also  the \nreplacement of certain state-owned enterprises by more efficient commercial enterprises played \na role. However, such efficiency gains in the use of coal have now ended and it is expected that \ncoal consumption will increase considerably in the coming years driven by the sharp increase in \ndemand for coal by power plants of which about 75% use coal as fuel.   \n \nC. \n \nThe cost of coal production varies considerably among various mines and types of coal. \n6. \nIn  general,  the  lowest  production  costs  occur  in  the  TVCMs  because  of  use  of  basic  mining \nmethods;  absence  of  proper  safety,  coal  mine  methane  (CMM)  drainage,  and  air  ventilation \nfacilities;  and  the  employment  of  low-wage  miners.  The  large  KSCOMs  have  considerable \neconomies  of  scale  in  comparison  with  the  small  TVCMs  but  also  higher  costs  because  of \nsafety,  environmental,  and  social  welfare  concerns,  which  they  need  to  address.  Overall,  it  is \nestimated that in the PRC the coal production cost range between $6\u201315 (equivalent) per ton of \ncoal produced.     \n \n7. \nThe coal and power industries are intimately entwined: some 50% of coal production is \nused for electricity generation and more than 75% of power is generated from coal-fired plants. \nHowever,  policies  governing  the  two  industries  have  not  developed  in  step.  Since  the  early \n1990s  coal  prices  for  other  sectors  than  the  power  sector  have  undergone  a  relatively  high \ndegree of liberalization and prices have risen substantially, with the exception of a dip in the late \n1990s. The quantities and price of coal that the key state mines and other large coal mines are \nto  supply  each  year  to  the  power  sector  are  negotiated  through  annual  national  trade  coal \nconferences  with  the  participation  of  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission \n(NDRC)  and  the  Ministry  of  Railways  with  the  aim  to  arrive  at  a  government  regulated  coal \nprice. During recent years with considerable economic growth demand for coal has increased in \nall  industrial  sectors  but  producer  and  consumer  prices  for  electricity  remain  tightly  controlled. \nEven at times of power shortages, as occurred in 2003, power companies are not permitted to \nraise prices. This has resulted in a serious and very public conflict between the coal and power \nindustries to which coal producers have responded by trying to make the power companies pay \n\nCoal Production Cost and Pricing \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nhigher prices. The Government is considering to liberalize the coal price for the power sector in \nthe  near  future,  also  because  considerable  expansion  of  existing  coal  mines,  where  possible, \nand  development  of  new  ones  will  be  required  to  meet  the  increasing  demand  for  coal  in  the \ncoming years. \n\n8. \nThe PRC\u2019s membership in the World Trade Organization imposes obligations relating to \ntariff  and  nontariff  barriers  and  to  subsidies.  However,  the  coal  industry  continues  to  receive \nsubstantial  subsidies  relating  to  extraction,  transportation  and  social  costs.  Such  assistance \nincludes  exemption  of  repayment  of  loans  from  state  owned  banks,  debt-to-equity  swaps  to \nreduce interest costs and debts, and provision of treasury bonds and low interest loans to state \nowned coal enterprises. It is difficult to accurately estimate the past and present value of direct \nand  indirect  financial  support  provided  by  the  Government  to  the  coal  sector.  However,  it  is \nestimated  that  such  support  has  been  declining  over  the  paste  decade.  This  could  become  a \nsource of contention in the near future. \n\nD.  \n\nCoal Transport \n\nRecent Developments  \n\n9. \nAlthough  coal  mining  is  profitable  at  present,  transporting  it  by  rail  to  large  consumers \nsuch as power plants remains unprofitable. At present the Government allocates rail transport \ncapacity  for  all  freight,  including  coal,  as  well  as  freight  rates.  After  incurring  losses  in  the \nprevious 3 years, it is estimated that the rail industry achieved marginal return on equity rates of \n0.27% to 1.13% from 1998 to 2002. However, about 50% of the freight capacity of the railways \nis already used for transporting coal and in 2004 hauling coal has become even less profitable \nfor  railway  companies  than  other  categories  of  freight,  which  has  caused  bottlenecks  in  the \nsupply of coal and has worsened coal shortages. Under these circumstances securing adequate \nrailway capacity for transporting coal in the future has become a major challenge. \n \nE.  \n \n10. \nAfter incurring losses during the previous 5 years, coal sector operations broke even in \n2002 and are estimated to have achieved a modest return on equity of 2\u20133% in 2003. Increased \ndemand for coal was largely responsible for higher prices and industry profitability, which could \nhave  been  even  higher  had  the  Government  not  capped  the  coal  prices.  With  regard  to  the \noperation  of  the  coal  mines  it  is  expected  that  the  central  Government  will  reinstate  some \ndegree of central control and supervision so as to be able to close down unauthorized, wasteful, \ndangerous, small coal mines and be able to regulate production and coal prices. As a first step \nthe Government has identified 19 new national coal zones in the provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, \nand  Inner  Mongolia.  All  coal  mines  in  these  areas  are  required  to  obtain  central  Government \napproval  for  their  operations.  Until  recently,  local  governments  had  sole  jurisdiction  about  the \noperation of small coal mines, which also constitute a significant source of tax revenue for local \ngovernments.  It is estimated that in 2003 there were still some 15,000 small coal mines in the \nPRC that produced less than 30,000 tons a year. Increased Central Government control is also \nexpected to facilitate merger of viable small coal mines with larger SOCMs and KSOCMs. \n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE  \n \n\n \n1. \nExternal  sources,  including  direct  foreign  investment,  are  increasingly  being  promoted \nand  now  finance  about  20%  of  total  annual  investments  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \n(PRC)  energy  sector,  mainly  in  the  power  sector.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has \napproved about $3.2 billion to the PRC energy sector to finance 25 projects in the public sector, \nand  2  private  sector  power  projects.  With  regard  to  power  projects,  thermal  power  projects \naccount for 41% in terms of loan amount, with hydropower projects accounting for about 36%, \nfollowed by transmission and distribution (about 17%), and renewable energy (about 6%). ADB \nhas  also  provided  67  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  for  the  energy  sector  for  about  $32 \nmillion  to  help  prepare  projects,  provide  policy  advice,  and  build  institutional  capabilities  of \npower utilities that are the executing agencies of ADB loans.  \n \n2. \nADB  has  extended  10  loans  amounting  to  $1.48  billion  for  urban  environmental \nimprovement projects in the PRC, including district heating distribution, natural gas distribution, \nand  combined  heat  and  power  plants.  Five  projects  have  been  completed  and  are  in \ncommercial  operation,  which  has  resulted  in  improvement  in  the  overall  ambient  air  quality  in \nthe  project  cities.  ADB  has  taken  a  leading  role  in  providing  support  for  (i) corporatizing  and \ncommercializing  power  utilities  and  state-owned  enterprises,  (ii) developing  the  policy  and \nregulatory  frameworks  for  encouraging  foreign  investment  in  the  power  sector,  (iii) introducing \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  for  power,  energy  efficiency,  and  clean  production  projects, \n(iv) strengthening  financial  management  of  project  enterprises,  (v) rationalizing  the  power  tariff \nstructure, and (vi) promoting market reforms to support energy efficiency and clean production.  \n \n3. \nThe World Bank is the largest official source of external funding for the power sector. As \nof April 2003, it had provided $5.8 billion to finance 25 power projects, most of which are large-\nscale thermal power or hydropower projects. A comparable amount has been invested in energy \nconservation  and  environmental  improvement  projects.  The  World  Bank's  2003  program  does \nnot include any power  projects. Its future program primarily targets renewable energy projects \nunder the World Bank-Global Environment Facility (GEF) Strategic Partnership for Renewables. \nRecent  World  Bank  TA  for  the  power  sector  has  been  supporting  the  Government's \nderegulation  efforts.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  and  the  United \nNations  Environment  Programme  are  providing  assistance  for  power  sector  restructuring, \nenergy efficiency, and industrial clean production. \n \nAmong  the  bilateral  sources,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  is  the \n4. \nlargest  source  of  external  assistance.  It  has  provided  concessional  loans  totaling  \u00a5438  billion \n($3.6 billion  at  the  current  exchange  rate)  for  14  power  sector  projects  through  its  official \ndevelopment  assistance  window,  excluding  those  assisted  through  export  credits  and  untied \nyen loans provided by the former Export-Import Bank of Japan. JBIC has also provided special \ncredits to major cities to improve their environment through the installation of emission control \ndevices  and  equipment  in  power  plants  and  factories,  and  through  building  water  treatment \nfacilities. JBIC is considering shifting its traditional focus of assistance to the power sector from \nhydro and thermal power generation to energy conservation and renewable energy, particularly \nin  the  western  region.  Germany,  through  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW),    has  provided \napproximately $400 million in mixed credits, mostly for power plants and turbine modernization \nprojects.  KfW  has  been  also  assisting  the  Government  in  energy  efficiency,  providing  credit \nlines,  and  renewable  energy  development.  Other  bilateral  sources,  providing  export  credits  or \nmixed credits and TA, include Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Spain, United \nKingdom, and United States. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n5. \nTo  promote  the  production  and  utilization  of  coalbed  methane  (CBM)  and  coal  mine \nmethane (CMM) in the PRC, various funding agencies have provided and are providing support. \nIn  1992,  UNDP  provided  a  GEF-financed  TA  project  of  $10  million  to  demonstrate  in  various \nparts  of  the  PRC  new  technologies  to  improve  CBM  and  CMM  production  and  to  establish  a \nnational database on CBM and CMM resources at PRC coal mines. Over the years, the United \nStates Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has been actively promoting the production \nand  utilization  of  CBM  and  CMM  in  the  PRC  through  its  support  for  the  establishment  and \nactivities  of  the  China  Coalbed  Methane  Clearinghouse  (CCMC)  under  the  China  Coal \nInformation  Institute.  USEPA\u2019s  main  activities  include  (i)  research  and  data  collection  on  the \nPRC\u2019s CMM production and emissions, (ii) dissemination of CBM- and CMM-related information \nand  data,  (iii)  identification  of  potential  projects  for  the  use  of  CMM,  and  (iv)  organizing \ninternational  conferences  and  workshops  to  promote  international  cooperation  for  CMM  and \nCBM development in the PRC. In 1996, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) began \na  project  at  the  Tiefa  coal  mine  in  Liaoning  Province  to  demonstrate  more  efficient  CMM \ndrainage  technologies.  In  1997,  the  project  was  taken  over  by  the  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency  (JICA)  as  a  Japan  \u201cGreen  Aid  Project,\u201d  and  it  was  completed  in  2002. \nUSEPA  continues  to  support  CCMC\u2019s  activities.  In  June  2002,  the  United  States  Labor \nDepartment  provided  a  grant  of  $2.3  million  for  TA  to  improve  safety  and  health  conditions  in \nPRC  coal  mines.  The  technical  assistance  will  be  implemented  in  cooperation  with  the  State \nAdministration  for  Work  Safety  of  the  PRC  and  will  focus  on  (i)  development  of  mine  rescue \ntechniques  and  institutionalizing  training  in  such  techniques,  (ii)  capacity  building  for \ngovernment personnel to promote workplace safety and health in PRC coal mines, (iii) training \nof  miners  and  operators  in  safe  operational  methods  and  practices,  (iv)  improving  the \nenforcement of relevant laws and regulations, and (v) developing pilot projects to demonstrate \nsafer  techniques  and  safety  supervision.  The  United  Kingdom,  under  its  Cleaner  Coal \nTechnology  Transfer  Programme  with  the  PRC,  is  supporting  projects  to  promote  enhanced \ncontrol and use of CMM, extraction and use of abandoned mine methane, and the development \nof  underground  coal  gasification.  All  agree  on  the  urgency  of  increasing  CMM  utilization \nschemes to mitigate the large greenhouse gas emissions associated with coal mining, improve \nthe environment, and increase miners\u2019 safety.  \n  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n  31 \n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PROJECT AND   \nTHE CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM \n\n \n \nThe Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a market-based financing instrument under \n1. \nthe  Kyoto  Protocol.  It  provides  project  developers  access  to  additional  financial  resources  for \ndeveloping  and  implementing  projects  that  provide  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  reduction  benefits \nover business-as-usual trends. The enforcement of the Kyoto Protocol is expected shortly with \nratification  by  Russia.  The  amount  of  $1.5  billion\u20132.5  billion  has  been  committed  in  the  GHG \nmarket,  which  is  expected  to  grow  as  the  Protocol\u2019s  first  commitment  period  (2008\u20132012) \napproaches, to $5 billion\u201310 billion annually. \n \nEmission  reductions  created  by  the  Coal  Mine  Methane  Development  Project  (CMMDP) \n2. \nmay  qualify  for  trading  under  the  CDM.  Under  the  CDM,  emission  reductions  in  a  developing \ncountry  can  be  traded  or  sold  to  developed  countries  subject  to  GHG  reduction  targets  under \nthe  Kyoto  Protocol.  The  CDM  process  has  five  steps:  (i)  identification  and  design,  including \npreparation of a project design document; (ii) validation and registration with the CDM executive \nboard;  (iii)  monitoring;  (iv)  verification  and  certification;  and  (v)  issuance  of  certified  emission \nreductions (CERs).   \n \nIn theory, a CDM project recognizes revenue only after operations begin, when emission \n3. \nreductions are generated and CERs can be issued. In practice, because registration procedures \nhave only recently become available, verifiable emission reductions (VERs) are being traded in \nthe emerging global carbon market. The global carbon market consists of buyers concentrated \nin Europe, Japan, and North America, including the Prototype Carbon Fund.1  The fund has an \nagreement with the Ministry of Finance of the PRC to purchase 3 million tons of carbon dioxide \nequivalent  (CO2e)  in  emission  reductions  from  CMMDP,  at  $4.25  per  ton  of  CO2e,  for  a  total \ncontract value of about $12.75 million.   \n \n4. \nThe  PRC  policy  and  institutional  context  for  CDM  projects  are  rapidly  evolving.  Several \nprojects  in  PRC  are  being  prepared  as  CDM  projects,  including  (i)  the  Gansu  Clean  Energy \nProject, supported by ADB,2  (ii) the proposed Liaoning environmental improvement project, and \n(iii) the CMMDP. A new baseline methodology and project design document for the CMMDP are \nexpected to be submitted shortly to the CDM executive board by the Prototype Carbon Fund.   \n \n5. \nThe  CMMDP  seems  to  have  clear  and  appropriate  CDM  additionality,3  as  it  will  (i)  help \nremove  policy  barriers  to  development  of  coal  mine  methane  (CMM)  and  coalbed  methane \n(CBM)  in  the  PRC;  (ii)  remove  technological  barriers  to  efficient  extraction  and  production  of \nCMM  and  CBM;  and  (iii)  remove  financial  barriers  for  financing  medium-  to  large-scale  CMM- \nand  CBM-fired  power  generation.  Based  on  current  and  projected  CMM  and  CBM  production \nand  utilization  rates,  an  estimated  minimum  of  23  million  tons  of  CO2e  reductions  will  be \nachieved during the first 10 years of operation of the CMM-fired power plant alone.   \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The ADB CDM facility, created in 2003, functions as a market facilitator rather than a buyer. \n2  ADB.  2003.

Ltd.  (JMC);  Shanxi  Energy  Industries  Group  Co.  Ltd.  (SEIG)  and  its  independent \nsubsidiary,  Shanxi  Energy  CBM  Co.  Ltd.  (SECC);  and  the  newly  established  entity  Jincheng  Coal \nMine  Methane  (CMM)  Comprehensive  Utilization  Company  (JCCUC).  The  historical  and  projected \nfinancial statements of the project enterprises are shown in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n2. \nJMC  and  JMC-  Company  Unit.  JMC  was  transformed  from  a  state-owned  enterprise  under \nthe Ministry of Coal to a corporate entity in 2002. JMC is a holding company, which is wholly owned \nby  the  Shanxi  provincial  government  (SPG)  with  total  assets  of  CNY12.1  billion  as  of  end  of  2003. \nJMC  is  involved  in  coal  production;  engineering  and  construction;  real  estate  development;  printing \nand  publishing;  production  of  chemicals;  and  power  generation.  The  company  was  awarded  a  local \ncredit  rating  of  AAA  by  the  Shanxi  Provincial  Bureau,  based  on  its  past  performance  and  timely \nrepayments of existing loans. It had cash and short term investments of CNY1.3 billion at the end of \n2003. For 2003, JMC\u2019s net after tax profit was about CNY6.4 million. \n \n3. \nJMC employs about 30,000 people and is one of the top 15 companies in Shanxi Province. JMC \nmade  significant  investments\u2014about  $700  million  equivalent\u2013during  2001-2003,  large  part  of  which \nwere  financed  by  new  equity  injection  (about  51%)  and  internal  cash  generation  (about  19%).  With \nlimited  borrowing,  JMC\u2019s  debt-to-equity  ratio  improved  over  the  same  period  (from  80%  to  55%).  The \ndebt-service-coverage  ratio  improved  from  the  low  level  of .0.8  in  2000,  to  about  1.7  in  2003  (see  \nTable A8.1). \n\nTable A8.1: Financial Performance and Projections \nJincheng Anthracite Mining Group Company Limited \n\n \n\nActual \n\nProjected \n\nYear ending December 31 \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2006 \n\n2008 \n\n2010 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n1,592.0 \n65.3 \n\nFinancial Accounts \n   Operating Revenues \n   Net Income \n   Total Assets \n   Capital Expenditures \nFinancial Ratios \n   Operating Ratio a (%) \n   Return on Net Fixed Assetsb (%) \n   Accounts Receivables c (months) \n   Debt/(Debt & Equity) Ratiod (%) \n   Debt Service Ratio e (times) \n\n1,331.3 \n14.7 \n7,014.6 \n(248.0) \n \n92.3 \n1.7 \n7.0 \n79.9 \n0.8 \nSource:  Company financial statements; company and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n2,494.6 \n(50.3) \n9,041.9  11,139.9 \n1,791.6 \n2,279.6 \n \n92.4 \n3.5 \n3.6 \n62.9 \n1.3 \n\n \n9,736.4  11,717.9 \n164.0 \n12,091.3  13,509.7  20,757.3  25,154.8  33,470.2 \n3,744.4 \n4,428.8 \n \n \n85.1 \n84.0 \n2.6 \n3.3 \n1.0 \n1.0 \n62.9 \n56.3 \n1.5 \n1.7 \n\n1,726.9 \n \n86.6 \n2.7 \n1.0 \n54.8 \n1.7 \n\n2,214.1 \n \n84.5 \n3.5 \n1.0 \n60.2 \n1.5 \n\n \n82.9 \n2.4 \n1.0 \n58.8 \n2.0 \n\n \n76.2 \n0.7 \n1.8 \n60.2 \n2.7 \n\n4,212.5 \n6.4 \n\n4,891.3 \n54.8 \n\n7,159.3 \n98.6 \n\n2,083.2 \n\n137.4 \n\n \n\n \n\n4. \nIn  1998,  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to  close  down  small-scale  coal  mines  increased  local  coal \nprices to international levels. Coal prices that averaged around CNY130-140 per ton in 1998 increased \nby about 200% to the current level of CNY420 per ton, which is in line with the international price of coal \nof about $50.8 per ton. This helped improve JMC\u2019s financial performance.  \n\n5. \nJMC  has  established  a  new  company  unit  (JMC-CU)  to  operate  the  CMM-fired  power  plant \nunder the CMM Development Project (CMMDP). The CMM-fired power plant will source the supply of \nCMM  from  the  Sihe  mine,  owned  by  JMC,  and  the  CBM  from  surface  wells,  which  are  to  be \ndeveloped in JMC\u2019s concession area under the CMMDP. The first 50% of the generation capacity will \nbecome available by January 2006, followed by the remaining 50% by January 2008. The operating \nrevenue of the CMM-fired power plant is projected to increase from CNY88.0 million in 2006 (at 50% \nof  capacity)  to  CNY184.9  million  in  2008  (at  full  capacity).1  Once  the  CMM-fired  power  plant  is \noperating  at  full  capacity,  its  return-on-net-fixed-assets  is  expected  to  be  in  a  satisfactory  range  of  \n6\u20139%  during  2010\u20132015.  The  CMM-fired  power  plant\u2019s  ability  to  generate  increasing  internal  cash \n\n                                                 \n1  Based  on  an  agreed  sales  price  of  the  power  generated  at  CNY0.234/kWh.  The  parent  company  will  be  the  sole \n  purchaser of the electricity.  \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n36 \n \nfrom its operations will contribute to a decrease in its debt-to-equity ratio over time from 72% in 2005 \nto 43% in 2015 while its debt-service-coverage ratio is projected to be in the range of 1.4 to 1.8 times \nduring 2009-2015. \n \n6. \nSEIG and SECC. SEIG was established in 1993 as a state-owned enterprise under the Shanxi \nProvincial  Government  and  was  corporatized  under  the  Corporation  Law  in  May  2001.  SEIG,  a \nholding  company  that  is  wholly  owned  by  SPG,  has  its  headquarters  in  Taiyuan.  Its  assets  total \nCNY741.6  million  as  of  end  of  2003,  including  24  subsidiaries  (10  coal-related  wholly  owned \nsubsidiaries,  8  subsidiaries  with  majority  shareholding,  and  6  subsidiaries  with  less  than  50% \nshareholding),  most  of  which  are  engaged  in  the  transport  of  coal  and  other  coal-related  business. \nWhile coal transportation is its core business, SEIG has other interests  such as power generation and \ntransportation  of  compressed  methane  gas  by  trucks.  Recently,  the  Government,  as  part  of  the \nongoing power sector restructuring, reduced SEIG\u2019s share in the Yangcheng Power Plant (2,100 MW) \nto 4%.    \n7. \nSEIG  incurred  losses,  based  on  net  results  from  the  operations  of a  range  of  subsidiaries  in \n2000, 2002, and 2003. It made a profit in 2001. In 2003, SEIG incurred a loss of CNY 10.1 million on \ntotal  revenues  of  CNY235.8  million.  The  SARS  epidemic,  which  banned  coal  transportation  for  3 \nmonths  in  2003,  and  accidents  in  older  coal  mines  were  two  key  reasons  for  the  poor  financial \nperformance.    SEIG\u2019s  projected  debt  level  is  about  26%\u201343%  during  2004\u20132010  and  its  overall \nbusiness growth forecast seems reasonable. However, SEIG has poor financial cost control with an \noperating ratio of about 105%, implying that its operations are not generating sufficient cash to meet \nits expenses and to replace its operational assets.  \n \n8. \nIn  2001,  SEIG  received  the  exclusive  franchise  from  SPG  for  transporting  CMM  and  CBM  in \nShanxi  Province,  and  established  the  SECC  for  this  purpose.  SECC  will  receive  CNY71.7 million  in \nequity contribution from SEIG. SEIG has the following sources of equity: CNY7.9 million available cash; \nCNY65.9  million  received  as  restitution  from  the  Shanxi  Finance  Bureau  in  September  2004 \n(accumulated  as  follows:  CNY19.2  million  in  2001,  CNY26.9  million  in  2002,  and  CNY19.8  million  in \n2003); additional expected dividend  of about  CNY7  million from  Yangcheng power  plant in 2003; and \nCNY12 million from subsidiary companies. This is more than is required for SEIG\u2019s equity contribution. \nThe  proposed  CMM  transmission  pipeline  will  also  reduce  the  number  of  accidents  in  coal  mines  by \npromoting the more efficient drainage of CMM by coal mine operators who are to supply CMM to SECC.  \n\nSECC is expected to generate about CNY110.2 million in revenues by 2009, representing about \n9. \n20%  of  the  SEIG\u2019s  overall  revenue.  Its  projected  debt  level  will  improve  to  70%  in  2009  from  82%  in \n2005.  Its  overall  business  growth  forecast  seems  reasonable.  A  financial  covenant  requiring  a \nsatisfactory operation ratio has been included in the relevant Project Agreement to monitor its progress \nwhile capacity building support in this area will also be provided under the Project. \n\n10. \n JCCUC.  The  Jingcheng  municipal  government  has  established  JCCUC  as  a  wholly  owned \nsubsidiary.  JCCUC  will  receive  the  assets,  including  existing  pipelines  worth  CNY60  million,  from  the \nJincheng  Municipal  Gas  Company  Limited,  which  will  be  closed  down  upon  completion  of  the  CMM \ndistribution  pipeline  system  under  the  CMMDP.  The  Jincheng  municipal  government  has  provided  a \nwritten guarantee for the equity amount of CNY81.2 million. JCCUC's projected revenue is expected to \ngrow from CNY132.5 million in 2006 (operating at 86% capacity) to CNY169.2 million in 2009 (operating \nat  full  capacity).  Based  on  preliminary  estimates,  the  net  income  is  projected  to  be  around  CNY10.0 \nmillion  in  2009  (representing  a  return-on-net-fixed  assets  of  about  5.6%).  There  are  no  plans  for  any \nmajor additional investments during this period and JCCUC\u2019s operating performance is expected to be \nstable with an operating ratio of around 87%. Its debt-to-equity ratio is estimated at about 74% at the \nbeginning of project implementation and is expected to decrease to around 60% by 2009. \n \n11. \ncompanies are in Table A8.2 below. \n\nA

INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nIntroduction \n\nProject Description \n\nthe  potential  environmental \n\nThis  document  summarizes \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nimpacts  and  mitigation \nmeasures  of  the  Coal  Mine  Methane  Development  Project  (CMMDP)  in  Shanxi  Province, \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). This document is based on environmental evaluations and \nassessments  prepared  for  individual  subproject  proponents,  which  include  field  sampling  and \nassessment, interviews, and analysis of secondary data. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe proposed CMMDP includes (i) improved and expanded coal mine methane (CMM) \nand  coalbed  methane  (CBM)1  production  at  the  Jincheng  Anthracite  Mining  Group  Company \nLimited  (JMC)  mining  areas,  totaling  approximately  182  million  cubic  meters  a  year  (m3/year), \nwhich will be used to fire a 120-megawatt (MW) power plant; 22 kilometers (km) of 110 kilovolt \npower transmission line and four transformer substations will be constructed to deliver power to \nthe grid; (ii) construction and operation of gas transmission and distribution networks to deliver \napproximately  166  million  m3/year  of  CMM,  with  an  average  methane  content  of  50%  to \nJincheng  City,  including  Yangcheng  county;  and  (iii)  institutional  strengthening  of  the  project \nimplementing  agencies  (PIAs).  CMM  will  be  produced  from  existing  mines,  and  CBM  will  be \nproduced from new surface wells; new mining is not required.  \n \nC. \n \nShanxi  is  on  the  middle  reaches  of  the  Yellow  River  in  north-central  PRC.  It  is  about \n3. \n156,300 square kilometers (km2) in area, with a population of 32.97 million in 2000. It has a dry \nand windy spring, a wet summer, and a cold winter. The wet season is from July to September, \nwhen flooding is prevalent in the low-lying areas, particularly in the Yellow River Basin. \n \n4. \nThe CMMDP is in Jincheng county in the mountainous region of southeast Shanxi, close \nto the border with Henan Province. The topography is dominated by limestone mountains and \nplateaus covered by loess. Jincheng is in the southeast of the Shanxi plateau, which is higher in \nthe east and lower in the central area. The urban center is in the catchment area of the Qin and \nDan  rivers,  characterized  by  medium-relief  rolling  hills  and  basins.  Mountains  and  rolling  hills \nover 800 meters above sea level occupy 87.1% of the total land. The Gaoping Basin, Jincheng \nBasin,  and  Qin  River  valley  are  Jincheng\u2019s  economic  and  political  centers.  Seismic  activity  is \nrare  and  of  low  intensity  (under  grade  IV).  All  facilities  will  be  designed  to  withstand  grade-VI \nincidents. \n \n5. \nThe  Qin  River  is  458  km  long,  and  flows  into  the  Yellow  River,  with  a  highly  variable \nseasonal  flow  of  2.5\u20133,050  cubic  meters  per  second  (m3/sec).  There  are  three  seasonal \ntributaries  within  5  km  of  the  site:  the  Mazhuang,  Pan,  and  Changzhuang  rivers.2  The  water \nquality  generally  falls  within  class-IV  standards.  During  the  rainy  season,  erosion  of  the \nsurrounding land can lead to very high concentrations of suspended solids in the rivers, which \ncan lead to restrictions in the flow and consequent flooding. \n \n6. \nMore  than  120  minerals  have  been  discovered,  including  coal,  bauxite,  pearlite, \nrefractory clay, gallium,  and zeolite. Shanxi is the largest coal-producing province in the PRC. \nThe  project  area  is  a  traditional  base  for  heavy  industries,  including  iron  and  steel,  glass  and \nceramics, and power generation. The main air pollution sources in Jincheng are industry, coal, \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   CMM is produced by in-mine drilling and drainage and CBM is produced from surface wells drilled into virgin coal \n\nseams. \n\n2   The Pan and Changzhuang rivers are seasonal. \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n39 \n\ndust,  and  vehicle  emissions  that  generate  smoke  and  dust  (PM),  nitrogen  oxides  (NOX),  and \nsulfur dioxide (SO2). On an annual daily average basis, air quality within Jincheng City exceeds \nclass-III  standards  of  the  State  Ambient  Air  Quality  Standards  (GB3095\u20131996),  which  is  poor \ncompared with the other 11 cities in Shanxi.  \n \nForestry  and  vegetation  in  the  area  are  declining  and  continuing  erosion  is  damaging \n7. \ngrassland. Endangered species have been reported in the area (including white-skin pine tree, \nleopard,  and  eagle)  but  are  declining.  According  to  the  Environmental  Pollution  Status  and \nControl  Measures  of  Jincheng  prepared  by  the  Jincheng  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  in \nApril  2003,  the  development  of  the  mines  and  the  associated  construction  activities  have \nsignificantly  damaged  the  ecological  environment.  There  are  two  natural  protection  areas: \nManghe in Yangcheng county, and Lishan in Qinshui county, both over 5 km from the proposed \npipeline route and other project facilities). \n \n8. \nSeveral  cultural  sites  are  located  within  Jincheng,  for  example,  Yuhuang  Temple  from \nthe  Yuan  Dynasty  and  Qinglian  Temple  from  the  Song  Dynasty.  There  are  four  protected \nstructures  within  Jincheng  City:  (i)  Jingde  Bridge,  provincial  level;  (ii)  Jingzhong  Bridge, \nprovincial  level;  (iii)  Jincheng  Committee  Center,  city  level;  and  (iv)  Zhang  Family  House,  city \nlevel. \n \nD. \n \n9. \nThe  CMMDP  is  designed  to  reduce  air  pollution  emissions,  regional  and  indoor,  by \nexpanding  clean  energy  supplies  and  improving  energy  efficiency.  Emission  reductions  are \nsummarized in Table A9.1. Except for short-term disruptions during construction, no irreversible \nnegative impacts directly due to project design, location, and operations have been identified.  \n \n10. \nAir pollution loads will decrease with the CMMDP via reduction in coal use, reduction in \npetroleum  fuels  use,  and  capture  of  vented  methane  gas.  Indoor  air  quality  will  improve, \nregional  SO2  loads  and  acid  precipitation  potential  will  decrease,  and  global  environmental \nbenefits  will  accrue  from  methane  capture.  Water  and  soil  pollution  will  be  indirectly  reduced \ndue to a lower rate of pollutant transfer from air to water and soil, with reduced stress on local \necosystems. Coal-derived waste will be reduced. \n\nAnticipated Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n \n \n \n \nProjectComponent \n\n \n \n \n\nPart A:  \nCMM and CBM  for \nPower Generation \nPart B:  \nCMM Distribution \n\nTable A9.1: Estimated Emissions Reduction  \n\nCalculated Emission Reduction \n(tons/year, except for CH4 ) \n\n \n \nNOx \n\n \n \nCO2 \n\nCH4 \n(million \nm3/year) \n\nCoal Saved \n(tons/year) \n\n \n \nPM \n\n \n \nSO2 \n\n3,909 \n \n\n291,270 \n\n4,910 \n\n1,276 \n\n410,901 \n\n182.4 \n\n138,040 \n\n2,956 \n\n992 \n\n   801 \n\n201,157 \n\n 83.0 \n\nTotal \n\n429,310 \n\n7,866 \n\n4,901 \n\n2,077 \n\n612,058 \n\n265.4 \n\nCBM = coalbed methane, CH4 = methane, CMM = coal mine methane, CO2 = carbon dioxide, m3 = cubic meter, NOx \n= nitrogen oxides, PM = particulate matter, SO2 = sulfur dioxide \nNotes:  CO2  equivalent  reductions  include  avoided,  reduced,  and  captured  CH4  emissions,  and  reduced  CO2 \n\nemissions through energy efficiency improvements.  \n\nSource:  Feasibility  studies,  environmental  assessment  reports  for  individual  project  components,  and  reports \n\nprepared by project preparatory  technical assistance consultants. \n\n \n\nCO2 \nequivalent \n(million \ntons/year) \n3.0 \n\n1.4 \n\n4.4 \n\n \n \n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n11. \nConstruction traffic, excavation and earthmoving, and aggregate processing facilities will \ngenerate  dust,  which  will  be  suppressed  with  routine  measures  (e.g.,  water  sprays  on \nconstruction sites and roads, tarps to cover trucks hauling raw materials). Construction vehicles \nand stationary equipment will meet existing PRC emissions and noise standards. Construction \nactivity  in  urban  areas  and  near  sensitive  receptors  (schools,  hospitals,  etc.)  will  be  limited  to \ndaylight  hours;  additional  noise  abatement  measures  such  as  temporary  barriers  will  be \nconstructed  as  necessary  to  meet  national  and  local  standards.  Traffic  and  communications \nmay be occasionally disrupted during construction of the pipelines and the CMM gathering and \ntransmission stations.  \n \n\n1. \n\nProject Alternatives \n\n \n12.  Without the CMMDP, the area will continue to rely on coal as the primary energy source \nfor commercial, industrial, and residential use. Other energy options have not been developed \non a commercial scale in the project area. Demand-side management measures will continue to \nbe driven by market forces, but will be insufficient in the near term to offset increasing energy \ndemands.  CMM  and  CBM  are  readily  available  alternatives,  the  supply  of  which  can  be \nexpanded through improved production methods.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCoal Mine and Methane Gas Safety \n\n \n The  safety  record  of  the  PRC  coal  industry  is  poor  and  considerable  efforts  are  being \n13. \nmade  to  improve  its  performance,  including  closure  of  small  mines  over  the  last  few  years.  In \n2002, 6121 deaths were reported, a rise of 8% over 2001. This is equivalent to 4.7 deaths per \nmillion tons of coal mined. Specific statistics for Shanxi are not available. The reported figures \nare believed to underestimate the extent of worker injuries and fatalities, as accidents in small \nand  illegal  mines  often  go  unreported.  Occupational  diseases  such  as  coal  worker's \npneumoconiosis  and  silicosis  are  likely  to  be  endemic  amongst  miners,  but  statistics  for  the \nproject area are not available. \n \n14. \nThe  risks  associated  with  CMM  and  CBM  extraction  are  low  compared  to  actual  coal \nmining.  The  explosion  hazards  associated  with  coal  mining  will  be  reduced.  Enhanced  CMM \nand CBM production will reduce mine explosion hazard by reducing the amount of methane gas \nin  the  mine  working  space.  Using  the  predicted  coal  savings  via  replacement  with  CMM  and \nCBM,  the  CMMDP  is  estimated  to  save  about  five  lives  per  year.  The  draining  of  CBM  from \nmines will make coal production safer. Injuries and occupational disease should be reduced with \nthe CMMDP, but statistics are not available to perform a valid evaluation. \n \n15. \nGas  leakage  from  pipeline  transmission  and  distribution  systems  will  be  minimized  by \ndesign,  following  best  engineering,  construction,  and  operating  practices.  Methane  and \nhydrogen sulfide (H2S) are monitored by automated systems that trigger alarms when methane \nconcentration  in  air  is  within  explosive  limits  and  when  H2S  is  above  designated  workplace \nsafety limits.  \n \nE. \n \n16. \nConstruction  contractors  will  be  required  to  provide  basic  sanitation  facilities,  domestic \nsewage  treatment,  solid  waste  management,  noise  and  dust  control,  and  personal  protective \nequipment  for  workers,  and  to  conduct  noise  and  dust  monitoring  at  construction  sites. \nConstruction  equipment  must  meet  relevant  PRC  emissions  and  noise  standards.  Local \nenvironmental  protection  bureaus  (EPBs)  will  be  responsible  for  routine  monitoring  of \nconstruction  activities,  as  well  as  conducting  routine  air  and  water  monitoring  at  designated \nmonitoring stations. The Jincheng EPB will be responsible for oversight of local EPBs and will \nreview  data  from  construction  contractors  and  local  EPBs  to  determine  if  environmental \nrequirements  are  being  met.  The  CMMDP  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  designate  at \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n41 \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nleast  one  suitably  qualified  professional  staff  member  to  serve  as  an  environmental  officer  for \nthe CMMDP. The PMO will be responsible for compiling progress reports for submission to ADB \ntwo times a year.  \n \nF. \n \n17. \nEnvironmental  evaluations  and  assessments  have  been  prepared  for  each  project \ncomponent, and have included at least one public consultation for each subproject, primarily via \nsurveys in affected areas. Survey results indicated strong local support for the CMMDP, based \non improved energy services, improved air quality and local ecological conditions, and expected \neconomic benefits.  \n \nG. \n \n18. \nThe  CMMDP  will  demonstrate  the  potential  for  CMM  and  CBM  as  a  reliable  and  safe \nclean energy supply, improve regional and indoor air quality, and reduce the explosion hazard \nassociated  with  methane  gas  production,  transmission,  and  distribution.  Global  environmental \nbenefits  will  be  realized  via  reduction  of  CO2.  The  anticipated  impacts  arise  primarily  from \nconstruction  activities,  and  can  be  readily  mitigated  with  good  engineering  practice  and  active \nenvironmental  management.  The  Jincheng  EPB  will  assume  a  lead  role  in  assuring  that  the \nenvironmental management program is fully implemented. Local EPBs, PIAs, and construction \ncontractors will be responsible for routine monitoring and oversight. Project impacts, mitigation \nmeasures, and monitoring requirements are summarized in Table A9.2.  \n \nH. \n \n19. \nThe  environmental  examinations  and  assessments  conducted  adequately  evaluate  the \npotential  impacts  of  the  CMMDP.  Further  project  processing  by  ADB  is  contingent  on \ncompletion of all environmental assessments as required by the PRC Government. A summary \ninitial  environmental  examination  has  been  prepared  pursuant  to  completion  of  all  required \nenvironmental  assessments.  The  environmental  impact  assessment  reports  prepared  by  the \nPIAs for the various components have been approved by the Shanxi Environmental Protection \nAdministration  and  the  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration.  Based  on  the  project \ndesign,  impacts,  mitigation  measures,  and  institutional  capacity,  environmental  category  B  is \nappropriate.  \n \n\nConclusions \n\n\f \n\n  \n\nTypes of \nPollution \nSources \n\n \ne\ns\ni\no\nN\n\n \nr\ne\nt\na\nw\ne\nt\ns\na\nW\n\n \n\nn\no\ni\nt\nc\nu\nr\nt\ns\nn\no\nC\n\n \nl\na\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nr\ne\np\nO\n\n \n\nd\no\ni\nr\ne\nP\n\n \n\nd\no\ni\nr\ne\nP\n\n \n\n \n\nd\no\ni\nr\ne\nP\nn\no\ni\nt\nc\nu\nr\nt\ns\nn\no\nC\n\n \nl\na\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nr\ne\np\nO\n\n \n\nd\no\ni\nr\ne\nP\n\n \n \nTable A9.2: Project Impacts, Mitigation Measures, and Monitoring Requirements \n\nPollution Sources \n\nTreatment Measures \n\nApplicable Standards \n\nPollutant or \nParameter \n\nHeavy equipment \noperations and \nmaintenance \n\n70\u2013100dBA (30m) \n\nPreconstruction equipment certification;

The land \nacquisition and resettlement (LAR) program is designed to ensure that the affected people will be \nbetter off or at least not worse off as a result of the CMMDP. \n \nThe impacts of the CMMDP are summarized in Table A10.1. In total, 29.49 hectares (ha) \n2. \nof land will be permanently acquired by the CMMDP, of which 69% or 20.37 ha is farmland. The \nCMMDP will require 308.69 ha of temporary land occupation and 9.36 ha of land lease. When \nconstruction is completed, the temporarily acquired land will be rehabilitated and returned to the \naffected people for their continued use. In addition, 6,135 m2 of brick houses and yards will be \ndemolished. Some auxiliaries, such as yards, toilets, trees, and tombs, will also be affected. A \ntotal of 262 households or 999 people will be affected, including 104 households or 386 persons \naffected  by  permanent  land  acquisition,  116  households  or  455  persons  by  temporary  land \nacquisition, 7 households or 18 persons by land lease, and 35 households or 140 persons by \nrelocation. \n \n\nTable A10.1: Summary of LAR Impacts of the Coal Mine Methane Development Project \n\nAffected Households \nand Population   \n(no.) \n\n \nHousehold \n \n\n \nPopulation \n \n\nPermanent Land \nAcquisition \n(ha) \n\nOf  which \nFarmland \n\nTemporary \nLand \nOccupation \n(ha) \n\nLand \nLease \n(ha) \n\nHouse \nDemolishment \n(m2) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nComponents \n \n120  MW  CMM-Fired \n\nPower Plant \n\nCBM Production from \nSurface Wells \nCMM Transmission \n\nPipelines \n\nCMM Distribution \n \n\nTotal \n\nTotal  Area\n  Affected \n \n5.32 \n\n \n\n14.10 \n\n10.07 \n \n\n4.30 \n\n \n\n7.17 \n\n8.90 \n \n\n23 \n\n7 \n\n186 \n\n46 \n \n\n262 \n\n85 \n\n18 \n\n723 \n\n173 \n \n\n999 \n\n \n\n \n \n111.26 \n\n197.43 \n \n\n9.36 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n6,135 \n\n29.49 \n\n20.37 \n\n308.69 \n\n9.36 \n\n6,135 \n\nCBM = coalbed methane, CMM = coal mine methane, ha = hectares, LAR = land acquisition and resettlement, m2 = square meters, \nno. = number \nSource: Project preparatory consultants and project implementing agencies.   \n \nFor the construction of the Sihe 120 megawatt (MW) CMM-fired power plant 5.32 ha of \n3. \nland will be permanently acquired and will affect 23 households comprising 85 persons. Coalbed \nmethane (CBM) production from surface wells will require 9.36 ha of land lease for 20 years and \naffect  7  households  comprising  18  persons.  The  coal  mine  methane  (CMM)  transmission \npipelines component will affect 14.1 ha of land permanently, 111.26 ha of land temporarily, and \ndemolish 6,135 m2 of houses. In total, 186 households comprising 723 people will be affected   \n(35  households  comprising  128  persons  by  permanent  land  acquisition,  116  households \ncomprising  455  persons  by  temporary  land  occupation,  and  35  households  comprising  140 \npersons by house demolishment. For the CMM distribution component, 10.07 ha of land will be \npermanently  acquired  and  46  households  comprising  173  people  will  be  affected.  In  addition, \n197.43  ha  of  road  will  be  occupied  temporarily.  To  avoid  LAR  impacts,  or  if  not  possible,  to \nminimize them, efforts were made in close consultation with local officials and village committees \nduring the project feasibility study and design stages. LAR issues are manageable if the affected \npeople are properly and fairly compensated and if their income and livelihood is improved or at \nleast restored after completion of the CMMDP. \n \n\n\fAppendix 10  45 \n\nthe  CMM \n\ntransmission  pipeline  component.  Relocation, \n\n \nThe compensation of the permanent land loss is based on the Land Administration Law \n4. \nof  the  PRC  of  1998  and  associated  Jincheng  municipal  laws  and  regulations,  as  well  as  the \nNotification for Strict Implementation of Commercialized Land Use Rights Transfer through Open \nBidding  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  State  Land  and  Resources  and  Ministry  of  Inspection  on \n26 August 2002. Two separate resettlement plans have been prepared for the CMMDP, which \nconform to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy on involuntary resettlement. \n \n5. \nFor permanent land acquisition for the 120 MW CMM-fired power plant component, the \ncompensation  rate  is  based  on  the  current  bidding  price  of  land  in  Jiafeng  township,  Quishui \ncounty,  which  is  about  CNY1.17  million  per  ha  for  agricultural  land.  The  compensation  rate  of \nland  lease  for  the  CBM  production  from  surface  wells  component  is  CNY140,055  per  ha  for \nfarmers and CNY4,170 per mu for collectives. For the CMM transmission pipelines component, \nthe compensation rate for permanent land acquisition adopts the current bidding price of land in \nJincheng,  which  is  about  CNY1.29  million  per  ha.  The  compensation  rate  for  temporary  land \nacquisition is CNY43,650 per ha and road rehabilitation CNY90.96 per square meter (m2). The \naverage  replacement  value  of  CNY600  per  m2  will  be  used  for  structures  lost  due  to  the \ntransfer,  and \nconstruction  of \ntransportation allowances will also be provided. The compensation rates for the CMM distribution \ncomponent  will  be  based  on  the  current  bidding  price  in  Jincheng  City,  which  is  about \nCNY206,910 per ha for permanent land acquisition, and CNY102 per m2 for road recovery cost. \n \n6. \n  Compensation for land acquisition will be paid to all users with or without legal papers, \nincluding  affected  people  settled  on  the  land  as  long  as  they  are  included  in  the  final  list  of \naffected people or are able to prove their occupation of affected plots before the cut-off date (31 \nDecember 2003). The payment will be made in cash according to the class and type of land and \ndwellings.  The  relocated  households  will  also  receive  a  transfer  and  transportation  allowance. \nAny income lost from temporary land occupation will be paid in cash to the affected people at a \nrate of 1.5 times the average annual output value. As soon as the construction is completed, the \nland will be returned to the users in its original form. Compensation for standing crops, auxiliaries \nand other assets (e.g., toilets, tombs, and trees) will also be paid directly to the affected people. \n \n7. \nThe  affected  people  have  been  notified  about  the  key  elements  of  the  LAR  plan  on \nvarious  occasions  during  meetings  and  interviews  and  have  participated  in  its  planning  and \ndesign.  For  example,  during  the  measurement  surveys  and  socioeconomic  survey  in  August \n2003, the distribution of the Resettlement Information Booklet for parts A and B of the CMMDP in \nSeptember 2003, and the redistribution of an updated Resettlement Information Booklet for part \nA in September 2004, extensive efforts were made to inform the affected people about the plan \nfor  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  and  to  integrate  the  needs  and  expectation  in  the \npreparation  of  the  resettlement  plans.  In  addition,  a  number  of  meetings  and  interviews  to \ndiscuss  key  elements  of  the  resettlement  strategy  have  been  convened  in  relocated  and  host \nvillages. Results of these meetings and concerns of the affected people were integrated into the \nresettlement plans. Further consultations will be carried out on the selection of housing sites and \ndistribution of housing plots. \n \nEconomic  rehabilitation  measures  will  include  (i)  provision  of  jobs  to  affected  people \n8. \nduring project construction and operation; (ii) employment of affected people in local enterprises \nwith the assistance of local government; (iii) land readjustment and programs taken by the local \ngovernments to intensify and diversify farm operations for affected people in order to raise the \nvalue  of  production  and  income  per  unit  of  land;  and  (iv)  training  in  scientific  and  diversified \nagricultural business to help affected people increase their income, such as courtyard economic \nactivities;  technology  for  animal  husbandry,  planting  of  crops  with  high  economic  value,  and \ngreenhouse winter fruits and vegetables; electronics; machinery and pipeline maintenance and \nrepair;  equipment  maintenance  and  repair  of  gas  compression  stations;  sales  methods  and \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nstrategy;  and  vehicle  maintenance  and  repair.  Vulnerable  households  will  enjoy  special \nprovisions,  including  CNY5,000  special  social  development  fund  assistance.  The  grievance \nredress  procedures  are  well  established  and  explanations  are  included  in  the  Resettlement \nInformation Booklet provided to all affected people and villages. \n \nThe  project  implementation  agencies  (PIAs)  are  responsible  for  implementation  of  all \n9. \nmeasures: Jincheng Anthracite Mining Group Company Limited (JMC) for part A of the Project; \nShanxi  Energy  CBM  Company  Limited  (SECC)  for  the  transmission  component  under  part  B; \nand  Jincheng  CMM  Comprehensive  Utilization  Company  Limited  (JCCUC)  for  the  CMM \ndistribution component under part B. The project resettlement office (PRO) within each PIA has \nthe lead responsibility for coordinating the planning, implementation, financing, and monitoring of \nland acquisition and resettlement. The PRO of JMC will have three full-time staff members; of \nSECC, five, and of JCCUC, five.   \n \n10. \nThey  will  work  closely  with  relevant  township  officials,  who  will  be  responsible  for \ndelivering entitlements, selecting new housing sites, and monitoring development of replacement \nland, and other economic measures among affected and host villages. In order to ensure that the \nstaff of PRO and township and village committees can properly and smoothly handle the land \nacquisition and resettlement, a training program will be organized for the PRO officers. \n \n11. \nThe  preliminary  cost  estimate  for  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  program  is \nCNY78.77  million  ($9.54  million)  in  2004  prices,  including  contingencies.  Resettlement \nimplementation  will  be  scheduled  in  stages  to  coincide  with  the  overall  project  construction \nschedule. However, before the affected people are moved and land is acquired, a final baseline \nsurvey  will  be  conducted  in  each  village,  and  the  household  contracts  will  be  negotiated  and \nsigned. \n \n12. \nThere will be internal and external monitoring of the implementation of the resettlement \nplans. Monitoring methodologies are specified in the resettlement plans. Internal supervision and \nmonitoring will be done by the PRO of each implementing agency to ensure compliance with the \nprovisions of the resettlement plans. The PRO has agreed to a set of supervision milestones with \nADB,  which  should  be  in  effect  to  ensure  timely  and  effective  implementation  of  resettlement \nactivities (Table A10.2). External monitoring will be carried out by an independent monitor under \ncontract to the PIAs. \n \n13. \nThere are about 900 minority persons, including Hui, Mongolian, Tibetan, Miao, Yi, Buyi, \nKorean, Manchurian, and Tujia, who will benefit from the improved CBM gas supply. About two \nHui  minority  households  in  the  project  area  will  be  affected  by  the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement.  Particular  attention  and  special  provisions  will  be  paid  to  them  to  ensure  their \ninterests and rights and socio-cultural customs will be protected. These provisions are presented \nin the resettlement plans and summary resettlement plan. \n \n\n\fNo. \n1. \n1.1 \n \n \n1.2 \n1.3 \n2. \n2.1 \n2.2 \n2.3 \n3. \n3.1 \n3.2 \n3.3 \n3.4 \n3.5 \n4. \n\n5. \n5.2 \n5.3 \n5.4 \n5.5 \n6. \n6.1 \n\n6.3 \n6.3 \n\n7. \n7.1 \n7.2 \n\n7.3 \n7.4 \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\nTable A10.2: Resettlement Supervision Milestones for CMM Development Project \n\nTarget \n\nResponsible Agency \n\nDeadline \n\nStatus \n\nResettlement Tasks \nDisclosure \n- RIB distribution \n \n- RIB redistribution (part A) \n- Resettlement plan \n- RP placed on ADB/PRC websites \nApproval of RP \n- Revised final draft RP \n- Approval of RP \n- Approval of RP budget \nAgreements \n- Compensation rates \n- Households-120 MW Power Plant \n- Households-CBM Production \n- Households-CMM Transmission \n- Households-CMM Distribution \nDetailed Measurement Survey \n\nDetailed LAR Plans \n- Village rehabilitation plans (rural) \n- Income restoration plans (urban) \n- Plan for vulnerable group \n- Training of APs \nImplementation Capacity \n- Set-up RLG \n\n6.2 \n\n- Set-up RCG \n\n6.3 \n\n- Staff resettlement offices \n\n- Staff township resettlement offices \n- Training of staff \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n- Baseline survey \n- Set-up internal supervision \n\n- Hiring external monitor \n- Internal monitoring reports \n\n \n54 AFs \nAs per RP \n\n \nQuarterly \n\n7.5 \n\n- External monitoring reports \n\nSemiannual \n\n7.6 \n\n- Evaluation/completion reports \n\nTwo \n\nDocumentation of Consultation \n\nAs per LARP \n\nDocumentation of Grievances \n\nAs required \n\n10. \n10.1 \n10.2 \n\nFlow of Funds/Compensation \n- To JCMRO/SECCRO/JCCUCRO \n- To affected villages \n\nAs per LARP \n  \u201c    \u201c    \u201c \n  \u201c    \u201c    \u201c \n\n \nJMC/SEIG/JMG \n\n \n246 AFs \n16 additional AFs  SECC/JCCUC \n23 AFs \n9 townships \n \n \nRevised RP \n \n$9.54 million \n \n33 villages \n23 AFs \n7 AFs \n186 AFs \n46 AFs \nRecheck \n\n \n33 villages \nNot required \nCNY 5,000 \n62 AFs \n \n1 RLG \n\n1 RCG \n\n3 JCM \n10 SECC/JCCUC \n18 staff \n31 staff \n\nJMC \nJMC/SECC/JCCUC \nJMC/SECC/JCCUC & ADB \n \nJMC/SECC/JCCUC \nJMG \nJMG \n \nJMC/SECC/JCCUC/RLG/RCG \nJMCRO \nJMCRO \nSECCRO \nJCCUCRO \nJMCRO/SECCRO/ \nJCCUCRO/JLAB \n \nJMC/SECC/JCCUC   \nJMC/SECC/JCCUC \nJMC/SECC/JCCUC \nJMC/SECC/JCCUC \n \nJMC/SECC/JCCUC/JMG/ \nSDRC/JPC \nJMC/SECC/JCCUC/SDRC/ \nJPC/RLAB/JHDAO/JWF/APs \nJMCRO/SECCRO/ \nJCCUCRO/ \nRTG \nJMCRO/SECCRO/ \nJCCUCRO/RTG \n \nJMC/SEIG/JMG \nJMCRO/SECCRO/ \nJCCUCRO \nJMC/SECC/JCCUC \nJMCRO/SECCRO/ \nJCCUCRO \nJCMRO/SECCRO/ \nJCCUCRO & IMA \nJMCRO/SECCRO/ \nJCCUCRO & IMA \nJMCRO/SECCRO/ \nJCCUCRO/RTG \nJMCRO/SECCRO/ \nJCCUCRO/RTG \n \nJMC/SECC/JCCUC \nJMCRO/SECCRO/ \nJCCUCRO/RTG \nJMCRO/SECCRO/ \nJCCUCRO/RTG \n\nAppendix 10  47 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n30 Sept 03  Completed \n31 Mar 04 \nCompleted \n30 Sept 04  Completed \nCompleted \n30 Nov 04 \nCompleted \n30 Nov 04 \n \n \n30 Sept 04  Completed \n30 Sept 04  Completed \n30 Sept 04  Completed \n \n30 Nov 04 \n30 Nov 03 \n30 Nov 04 \n30 Nov 04 \n30 Nov 04 \n31 Jan 05 \n\n \nPlanned \nCompleted \nPlanned \nPlanned \nPlanned \nPlanned \n\n \nIn process \n \n\n \n30 Nov 04 \n \n17 Sept 03  Completed \n28 Feb 05 \n \n30 Nov 04 \n\nPlanned \n \nIn process \n\n30 Nov 04 \n\nIn process \n\n30 Nov 04 \n\nIn process \n\n30 Nov 04 \n31 Jan 05 \n\nIn process \nPlanned \n\n \n31 Aug 03 \n30 Nov 04 \n\n \nCompleted \nPlanned \n\nPlanned \n1st  Report \ndue \n1st  Report \ndue \n \n\n30 Nov 04 \n31 Jan 05   \n\n30 Apr 05 \n\n& \n\n2005 \n2006 \nOngoing \n\nOngoing \n\n \nNov 04-06 \n \n\n \nPending \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n10.3 \n\n- To affected households \n\n  \u201c    \u201c    \u201c \n\n \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AF  =  affected  families,  APs  =  affected  persons,  IMA  =  independent  monitoring  agency,  JCCUC  =  Jincheng \nComprehensive CMM Utilization Company Limited, JCCUCRO = Jincheng Comprehensive CMM Utilization Company Limited, resettlement office, JHDAO \n= Jincheng Housing Demolishment Administration Office, JLAB = Jincheng Land Administration Bureau, JMC = Jincheng Anthracite Mining Group Co.

The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA) \nconsultants  produced  a  demand  forecast  for  electricity  consumption  in  the  Shanxi  power  grid. \nForecast  was  made  for  the  short  term  (3 years)  and  the  long  term  (up  to  2020)  on  a  sector \nbasis. The demand-side management measures, including implementation of time-of-day tariffs \nbased  on  the  long-run  marginal  cost,  were  taken  into  account  in  the  short-  and  long-term \nforecasts.  The  projected  growth  rates  of  electricity  demand  vary  for  different  consumer \ncategories, the highest being in construction and the lowest in agriculture. Electricity demand in \ngigawatt-hours  is  conservatively  forecast  to  grow  at  8.1%  for  2002\u20132005,  7.0%  for  2006\u20132010, \n6.9% for 2011\u20132015, and 6.8% for 2016\u20132020.  \n \n2. \nBased  on  the  energy  demand  forecast,  the  PPTA  consultants  carried  out  least-cost \ngeneration expansion planning using the generator of electric system planning model. The power \ngeneration options used in conjunction with plants under construction included 300 megawatts \n(MW) and 600 MW coal-fired power-generating units, gas turbine power plants, and combined-\ncycle  power  plants.  The  analysis  shows  that  the  planned  commissioning  of  the  coal  mine \nmethane (CMM)-fired power plant at the Sihe mine under the Coalmine Methane Development \nProject (CMMDP) in 2006 (60 MW) and 2008 (60 MW) is supported by the least-cost generation \nexpansion plan for the Shanxi power grid. The analysis used constant 2003 prices and a discount \nrate of 12%. Tradable commodities were valued at border prices at the prevailing exchange rate \n(CNY8.3=  $1.0).  Non-tradable  commodities  were  valued  at  shadow  prices,  using  a  mix  of \nstandard and specific conversion factors.1  \n \n3. \nTwo  least-cost  generation  expansion  alternatives  for  the  Shanxi  power  grid  were \nconsidered. Alternative I is the base case, which is to construct the CMM-fired power plant and \ntransmission lines to connect the plant to the Shanxi power grid. In alternative II, the CMM-fired \npower  plant  will  not  be  constructed;  instead,  120  MW  of  coal-fired  thermal  power  plant  in  the \nJMC operational areas is considered to meet the load requirement. The present values of cost \nflows  (discounted  to  2003  prices)  for  alternatives  I  and  II  are  CNY169.583  and  CNY169.655 \nbillion,  respectively.  The  results  indicate  that  the  least-cost  generation  expansion  scenario \nincluding the CMMDP compares favorably with the one without the CMMDP.  \n \nThe  result  of  the  least-cost  analysis  is  supported  by  equalizing  discount  rate  (EDR) \n4. \nanalysis.2 In  the  EDR  analysis  (Table  A11.1),  the  CMM-fired  power  plant  will  replace  coal-fired \nthermal  for  base  load  operation.  The  analysis  compares  the  investment  and  operation  cost  of \nthe  106  MW  CMM-fired  power  plant  with  that  of  120  MW  coal-fired  thermal  (the  capacity \ndifference is due to different plant consumption rate and forced outage rate (FOR) between the \nCMM-fired  power  plant  and  the  coal-fired  thermal  power  plant).  The main  assumptions  for the \ncandidates, including the fuel cost and capital cost, were found to be appropriate. The results of \nan environmental impact were also incorporated into the EDR analysis. The EDR shows that the \nCMM-fired power plant is superior up to a discount rate of 14.4%, compared with the alternative of \nlocating the coal-fired thermal power plant in the load center. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   A standard conversion factor of 0.93 was used. Border prices were used for all imported items. Local costs were \nshadow  priced  using  group  and  specific  conversion  factors:  1.0  for  equipment,  1.67  for  steel,  0.76  for  cement, \n0.82 for timber, 2.0 for skilled labor, and 0.67 for unskilled labor. Taxes and duties were excluded. \n\n2   The  costs  of  environmental  mitigation  and  the  resettlement  program  have  been  included  in  the  project  cost \n\nestimates. \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n49 \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\nB. \n \n5. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculations include (i) the CMM-fired power \nplant  and  production  of  CMM  and  coalbed  methane  (CBM),  (ii) CMM  transmission  and \ndistribution pipeline systems, and (iii) the whole CMMDP including all components. The benefits \nof the CMMDP mainly include (i) incremental electricity and gas outputs, and more efficient gas \nsupply;  (ii)  cost  savings  from  meeting  existing  demand;  and  (iii)  environmental  benefits.  As  in \nthe  least-cost  analysis,  the  economic  analysis  applied  the  conversion  factors  to  investment \ncosts  for  land, 3  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution;  fuel  costs;  and  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs,  where  applicable.  For  the  EIRR  calculations,  the  benefits  of  energy  output \nwere valued based on consumer's willingness to pay, economic prices of gas and end-consumer \ntariffs. \n \nAn  economic  evaluation  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  CMMDP  was  carried  out \n6. \nbased  on  the  benefits  transfer  method.  The  evaluation  used  (i)  methodology  adopted  in  the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s Workbook on Economic Evaluation of Environmental Impacts (1996) \nto determine the adjusted estimate of the monetary damages caused by air pollution during the \nstudy period, taking into account the location of the CMM-fired power plant, the emission level, \nand  the  population  affected;  and  (ii)  estimates  of  average  annual  climate  change  for  carbon \nemissions to evaluate the monetary damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions.  \n \nThe EIRR calculation is a conservative approach, as it takes into account only the main \n7. \nbenefits of different components but includes all CMMDP-related costs. As presented in Tables \nA11.2 to 4, taking the local environmental benefits into account, this approach yields an EIRR of \n21.1%  for  the  component  that  include  the  CMM-fired  power  plant  and  the  production  of  CMM \nand  CBM,  27.5%  for  the  component  that  includes  the  CMM  transmission  and  distribution \npipeline systems, and 23.4% for the whole CMMDP. Sensitivity analyses were performed for the \nabove  EIRRs.  For  the  EIRR  of  the  whole  CMMDP,  sensitivity  analysis  showed  that  the  EIRR \nwould decrease to (i) 19.3% if the CMMDP were to experience a cost overrun of 20%; (ii) 15.3% \nif  the  benefits  were  reduced  by  20%;  (iii)  20.8%  if  the  CMMDP  were  to  experience  a \ncommissioning delay of one year; and (iv) 10.6% if (i), (ii), and (iii) all occurred.  \n \n8. \nIf the global environmental benefits were added to the benefits of the CMMDP, the EIRR \nfor the CMM-fired power plant and the production of CMM and CBM would increase to 30.9%, \nthe EIRR for CMM transmission and distribution pipeline systems would increase to 42.1%, and \nthe EIRR for the whole CMMDP would increase to 34.6%. \n \n\n                                                 \n \n\n3  Land is valued at the economic opportunity cost (the estimated value of the best alternative utilization). \n\n\f5\n0\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n1\n\ni\n\nItem\n\n2002 2003 2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008 2009\n\n2010 2015\n\n2020 2026\n\nNPV\n\nTable A11.1:  Least-Cost and Economic EDR Analysis\n\nSihe CBM Power Plant\n\nInstalled Capacity(MW)\n\nElectricity Generation (GWh)\n\nElectricity Supply to Power System (GWh)\n\nInvestment Costs\n\nOperating Costs\n\nTotal Costs\n\nLevelized Cost (CNY/kWh)\n\nThe Alternative:  600MW Coal-Fired \n\nThermal in Load Center\n\nInvestment Costs\n\nOperating Costs\n\nEnvironmental Costs\n\nTotal Costs\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.207\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n77\n\n0\n\n0\n\n77\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n298\n\n298\n\n53\n\n324\n\n314\n\n397\n\n17\n\n414\n\n53\n\n392\n\n380\n\n199\n\n21\n\n220\n\n106\n\n818\n\n793\n\n99\n\n27\n\n127\n\n106\n\n815\n\n791\n\n27\n\n27\n\n106\n\n813\n\n788\n\n106\n\n800\n\n776\n\n106\n\n800\n\n776\n\n106\n\n800\n\n776\n\n     \n\n4,129\n\n27\n\n27\n\n27\n\n27\n\n27\n\n27\n\n27\n\n27\n\n        \n\n856\n\n77\n\n129\n\n129\n\n0\n\n0\n\n37\n\n5\n\n52\n\n43\n\n6\n\n52\n\n76\n\n13\n\n77\n\n129\n\n171\n\n101\n\n141\n\n0\n\n76\n\n14\n\n90\n\n76\n\n14\n\n90\n\n75\n\n16\n\n92\n\n75\n\n20\n\n95\n\n75\n\n20\n\n95\n\n        \n\n893\n\nLevelized Cost (CNY/kWh)\n\n0.216\n\nEconomic EDR (with Environmental Cost)\n\nCost Difference between the Project and the Alternative \n\n0\n\n77\n\n77\n\n  \n(169)\n\n  \n(244)\n\n  \n(119)\n\n15\n\n63\n\n63\n\n64\n\n68\n\n68\n\n          \n\n37\n\nEDR (%)\nCBM = coal bed methane, EDR = equalizing discount rate, GWh = gigawatt-hour, kWh = kilowatt-hour, MW = megawatt, NPV = net present value, O&M = operation and\nmaintenance, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching value.\nNotes:\n\n14.4\n\n(i)      Discount rate:   12%           \n(ii)   Standard conversion factor:  0.93                                                    \n(iii)    Coal Prices are border prices.          \n(iv)   All costs in CNY million\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\nSensitivity Analysis of EDR\n\nBase Case\n(i) Energy Sale\n(ii) Capital Cost Overrun\n(iii) Implementation Delay\n(iv) Combination of (i), (ii) and (iii)\n(v) Changes in Coal Prices\n\nChange in\nVariable\n\n(10%)\n10%\n1 year\n\n(10%)\n\n   SV\n    (%)\n\n9.08 11.0\n5.3\n\nNPV    EDR    SI\n  (%)\n14.4\n12.2\n10.4 18.95\n12.1\n7.0\n9.2 10.98\n\n37.1\n \n3.4\n   \n(33.2)\n   \n1.1\n(111)\n \n(44.4)\n\n9.1\n\n\fTable A11.2: Economic Rate of Return of Part A\u2014Production of CMM and CBM for a 120 MW Power Plant\n\n2003\n\n2004 2005\n\n2006 2007\n\n2008 2009\n\n2010\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2020 2025 2026 NPV 2003\n\nEconomic Rate of Return Calculation\n\nI.

Ltd. (JMC) will connect the \nnew 120 MW power station (fully owned by JMC) to the Shanxi power grid, which is owned by \nShanxi Electric Power Company (SEPC), to improve reliability of supply, even though the power \nstation could be operated as an isolated power station disconnected from the grid. Electricity will \npass through transmission lines\u2014mostly owned by JMC\u2014from the terminal station at the power \nplant  to  the  distribution  point  at  the  mining  site  and  therefore  will  not  require  to  pay  any \ntransmission charge. However, electricity is required to pass through Duanshi substation, which \nis owned by SEPC. JMC has confirmed that they will pay a use of system charge of CNY0.0025 \nper kilowatt-hour (kWh) for all electricity generated by the power station and supplied to the Sihe \nmine. This use of systems charge is about 1% of the agreed purchase price of CNY0.234/kWh. \n \n2. \nJMC  has  unconditionally  guaranteed  that  Sihe  mine  will  purchase  all  electricity \ngenerated by the 120 MW power plant at a price of CNY0.234/kWh, which will be increased in \nfuture in line with local inflation and other external factors. The tariff is approximately 20% lower \nthan the prevailing electricity tariffs in the Shanxi Province of CNY0.29/kWh. \n \n3. \nUnder  part  B,  the  proposed  retail  gas  prices  for  different  customer  categories  are \ncomparable  to  other  alternatives  available.  For  example,  the  fertilizer  plant  gas  (2900  kcal/m3 \nenergy content), was sold at the following prices (CNY per m3):  residential: 0.45; utilities: 0.5; \ncommercial:  0.6;  and  industrial:  0.55.  If  the  fertilizer  gas  prices  are  adjusted  to  energy \nrquivalent, price for residents (at 4500 kcal/m3, the energy content of CMM) is CNY0.7/m3; for \nindustrial is CNY 0.93/m3, which are comparable to the proposed prices. The proposed prices \nare shown in Table A12.1. \n \nIn  Shanghai  natural  gas  is  sold  to  consumers  at  CNY2.1/m3,  which  translates  into  a \n4. \nCMM equivalent price of about CNY1/m3. This confirms that the proposed consumer prices are \nin line with present consumer gas prices in the PRC. \n  \n\nTable A12.1: Summary Price Assumptions \n\nPurchase Price \n\nSale Price \n\n \nCMM and CBM: CNY0.2/m3 a \n\n \nElectricity: CNY0.234/kWh \n\n \n\nItem \n\nPart A \nCMM and CBM Production from \nSihe Mine and Surface Wells and \nCMM-Fired Power Plant \n\nPart B \n1.

The  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital  (WACC)  represents  a  weighted  average  of  the  different  returns  (interests)  paid  to  the \nvarious source of funds for the CMM Development Project (CMMDP). The calculation of WACC \nis  based  on  the  financing  plan  for  the  CMMDP  and  after  adjustment  for  the  corporate  rate  of \n33% for tax deductibility of interest payments and for local inflation projection of 2%, the post-tax \nreal WACC is calculated at 4.48% (Table A12.3). \n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n55 \n\nTable A12.2: Cost of Equity Calculation \n \n\nRisk-Free Rate (Nominal) \nRisk-Free Rate (Real) \nEquity Premium \nEquity Beta \nForecast Inflation \nTax Rate \nAfter-Tax Cost of Equity (Real) \nAfter-Tax Cost of Equity (Nominal) \nSource:  Jincheng  Anthracite  Mining  Group  Company  Limited, \nShanxi  Energy  CBM  Company  Limited,  and  Jincheng  CMM \nComprehensive Utilization Company Limited. \n \n\n4.62% \n2.57% \n3.50% \n0.95 \n2.00% \n33.00% \n5.88% \n8.00% \n\nTable A12.3: Calculation of WACC \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nTotal \n237.00\n100.00\n\nJBIC \nLoan \n20.00 \n8.44 \n4.30 \n0.00 \n33.00 \n2.88 \n2.00 \n0.86 \n4.00 \n0.34 \n\nADB \nLoan \n117.40 \n49.54 \n4.30 \n0.00 \n33.00 \n2.88 \n2.00 \n0.86 \n4.00 \n1.98 \n4.48%  \n\nLocal  Govt. \nLoan  Equity   Grant \n0.50 \n61.24 \n37.86 \n0.21 \n25.84 \n15.97 \n0.00 \n8.00 \n6.12 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n33.00 \n0.00 \n8.00 \n4.10 \n2.00 \n2.00 \n2.00 \n0.00 \n5.88 \n2.06 \n0.00 \n5.88 \n4.00 \n0.00 \n1.52 \n0.64 \n\n  \nProject Costs \nAmount ($ million) \nWeight Factor % \nNominal Cost % \nBusiness Tax % \nCorporate Income Tax % \nTax-Adjusted Nominal Cost % \nInflation Rate % \nReal Cost % \nMinimum Rate Test % \nWeighted Component of WACC % \nWeighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) \nADB = Asian Development Bank, Govt. = Government, JBIC = Japan Bank for International Cooperation, WACC = \nweighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nFinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) measures the financial viability of a project. Table \nA12.4  presents  each  component\u2019s  receipts,  payments  and  net  cash  flows  for  20  years  of \noperations  where  it  is  assumed  that  the  receipts  and  payments  will  remain  constant  in  real \nterms  once  a  steady  state  is  reached.  The  present  value  of  net  benefits  becomes  zero  at \ndiscount  rates  between  6.2%\u20137.2%.  This  represents  the  range  of  FIRRs  for  the  three  project \ncomponents while the FIRR for the overall Project is estimated at 6.5%. Since the cash flows in \nFIRR calculation are post-tax the FIRR is to be compared against the post tax WACC of 4.48%. \nSince the range of FIRRs is higher than WACC, all components are financially viable. Sensitivity \nanalysis  shows  that  subjected  to  adverse  conditions,  the  FIRR  remains  reasonably  robust, \nexcept if all adverse conditions occur simultaneously. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n2\n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\nTable A12.4:  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n(CNY million) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nTax \n\nTotal Cost \n\n \nYear \n\nO&M  Capital \n\nTotal \nIncome \n \n\nPart A:  CMM/CBM Production for Power Plant \nNet \n \nCash \nFlow \n(356.1) \n(410.1) \n(175.4) \n( 10.7) \n109.9 \n104.4 \n100.8 \n100.8 \n100.8 \n100.8 \n100.8 \n100.8 \n100.8 \n100.8 \n100.8 \n100.8 \n100.8 \n100.8 \n100.8 \n100.8 \n100.8 \n100.8 \n     875 \n     152 \n\n85.5 \n85.5 \n167.1 \n167.1 \n167.1 \n167.1 \n167.1 \n167.1 \n167.1 \n167.1 \n167.1 \n167.1 \n167.1 \n167.1 \n167.1 \n167.1 \n167.1 \n167.1 \n167.1 \n167.1 \n167.1 \n3,346 \n\n350.5 \n466.9 \n234.0 \n116.4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5.7 \n14.7 \n20.2 \n31.7 \n32.5 \n40.8 \n46.1 \n46.1 \n46.1 \n46.1 \n46.1 \n46.1 \n46.1 \n46.1 \n46.1 \n46.1 \n46.1 \n46.1 \n46.1 \n46.1 \n46.1 \n46.1 \n 883 \n\n14.1 \n6.6 \n29.7 \n24.7 \n22.0 \n20.2 \n20.2 \n20.2 \n20.2 \n20.2 \n20.2 \n20.2 \n20.2 \n20.2 \n20.2 \n20.2 \n20.2 \n20.2 \n20.2 \n20.2 \n20.2 \n420 \n\n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n\n1,066 \n\n1,911 \n\n1,168 \n\nTotal \n\n  244 \n\n 496 \n\nPV \n\n \nTotal \nIncome \n \n76.6 \n76.6 \n94.0 \n94.0 \n94.0 \n94.0 \n94.0 \n94.0 \n94.0 \n94.0 \n94.0 \n94.0 \n94.0 \n94.0 \n94.0 \n94.0 \n94.0 \n94.0 \n94.0 \n94.0 \n94.0 \n\n1,939 \n\n1,227 \n\nPart B:  CMM Transmission \n\nPart B:  CMM Distribution \n\n \nCMM \nPurchase \n \n25.8 \n25.8 \n31.6 \n31.6 \n31.6 \n31.6 \n31.6 \n31.6 \n31.6 \n31.6 \n31.6 \n31.6 \n31.6 \n31.6 \n31.6 \n31.6 \n31.6 \n31.6 \n31.6 \n31.6 \n31.6 \n    653 \n\n \n\n87.0 \n116.7 \n58.4 \n28.7 \n\n \n \nTotal Cost \nO&M  Capital  Tax \n \n \n \n26.0 \n3.4 \n25.9 \n6.3 \n28.6 \n6.3 \n28.6 \n5.8 \n30.1 \n5.8 \n30.1 \n5.8 \n30.1 \n5.8 \n30.1 \n5.8 \n30.1 \n4.9 \n33.0 \n33.0 \n4.9 \n33.0 \n4.9\n33.0 \n4.9\n33.0 \n4.9\n33.0 \n4.9\n33.0 \n4.9\n33.0 \n4.9\n33.0 \n4.9\n33.0 \n4.9\n33.0 \n4.9\n33.0 \n4.9\n 655 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n     291 \n\n  104 \n\nNet \nCash \nFlow \n(87.0) \n(91.9) \n(36.9) \n(1.3) \n27.4 \n26.4 \n26.4 \n26.4 \n26.4 \n26.4 \n24.5 \n24.5 \n24.5 \n24.5 \n24.5 \n24.5 \n24.5 \n24.5 \n24.5 \n24.5 \n24.5 \n24.5 \n  236 \n\n \nTotal \nIncome \n \n\n \n\nCMM \nPurchase \n \n\n122.8 \n130.9 \n130.9 \n143.5 \n143.5 \n143.5 \n143.5 \n143.5 \n143.5 \n143.5 \n143.5 \n143.5 \n143.5 \n143.5 \n143.5 \n143.5 \n143.5 \n143.5 \n143.5 \n143.5 \n143.5 \n 2,968 \n\n87.5 \n90.7 \n90.7 \n101.9 \n101.9 \n101.9 \n101.9 \n101.9 \n101.9 \n101.9 \n101.9 \n101.9 \n101.9 \n101.9 \n101.9 \n101.9 \n101.9 \n101.9 \n101.9 \n101.9 \n101.9 \n  2,104 \n\n \n \n\n \nTotal Cost \n\nO&M  Capital  Tax \n92.3 \n \n \n124.0 \n8.6 \n62.0 \n8.6 \n31.0 \n8.6 \n8.6 \n \n8.6 \n \n8.6 \n \n8.6 \n \n8.6 \n \n8.6 \n \n8.6 \n \n8.6 \n \n8.6 \n \n8.6 \n \n8.6 \n \n8.6 \n \n8.6 \n \n8.6 \n \n8.6 \n \n8.6 \n \n8.6 \n \n8.6 \n \n181 \n\n \n5.4 \n5.4 \n5.9 \n5.9 \n5.9 \n5.9 \n5.9 \n5.9 \n5.9 \n7.5 \n7.5 \n7.5 \n7.5 \n7.5 \n7.5 \n7.5 \n7.5 \n7.5 \n7.5 \n7.5 \n\n135 \n\n \n\nNet \nCash \nFlow \n(92.3) \n(97.3) \n(35.8) \n(  4.9) \n27.1 \n27.1 \n27.1 \n27.1 \n27.1 \n27.1 \n27.1 \n25.4 \n25.4 \n25.4 \n25.4 \n25.4 \n25.4 \n25.4 \n25.4 \n25.4 \n25.4 \n25.4 \n548.3 \n\n    413 \n\n 411 \n\n     265 \n\n    69 \n\n    55 \n\n 1,882 \n\n  1,333 \n\n115 \n\n   282 \n\n  85 \n\n      52 \n\nCBM = coalbed methane, CMM = coal mine methane, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, PV = present value, O&M = operation and maintenance \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n      6.2 \n\n \n\n   7.2 \n\n \n\nFIRR (%) \n\n \n\n     6.9 \n\n \n\nSensitivity Analysis  \n\nChange in \n\nFIRR (%) \n\nTable A12.5: Sensitivity Analysis   \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nVariable \n\nPart A \n\nPart B (i) \n\nPart B (ii) \n\nOverall Project \n\n  (i) Base Case \n (ii) Capital Cost Overrun \n(iii) Lower Benefits \n(iv) Implementation Delay \n (v) Combination of (ii), (iii), and (iv) \n\n \n\n     FIRR =  financial internal rate of return. \n     Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n10% \n10% \n1 year \n\n6.2 \n5.0 \n4.8 \n5.5 \n3.1 \n\n7.2 \n5.8 \n4.7 \n6.0 \n1.9 \n\n6.9 \n5.6 \n5.9 \n5.7 \n3.6 \n\n6.5 \n5.6 \n5.9 \n5.7 \n3.6 \n\n\f \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n57 \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nA. \n \nSector identified as a national priority in \ncountry poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\nYes \n\n \nSector identified as a national priority \nin country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n\nNo \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \n \nIn line  with the Government\u2019s energy sector strategy to  promote socioeconomic development and to  meet the  basic \nneeds  of  the  poor,  increased  clean  energy  supply  is  needed  to  support  the  national  poverty  reduction  program. \nAdequate  and  clean  energy  supply  is  seen  as  essential  to  human  well-being  and  a  crucial  enabler  of  economic \nactivities. The supply of coal mine methane (CMM) and coalbed methane (CBM) will decrease the coal burning that \ncauses  serious  environmental  and  air-related  diseases,  particularly  reduce  the  impacts  on  the  poor,  women  and \nchildren  who  suffer  most.  The  increased  gas  supply  to  local  industries  and  commercial  users  will  enable  many \nenterprises  to  expand  production  and  increase  the  quality  and  values  of  products,  which  in  turn  will  create  more \nemployment  and  income  opportunities  for  the  local  population  and  generate  more  tax  revenues  for  the  Shanxi \nprovincial government to enhance its poverty reduction efforts. The improved urban environment can improve the local \ninvestment climate to attract more investment to the region and promote the growth of industry and service sectors. \nThrough  careful  design  of  project  subcomponents  and  proactive  policy  dialogue,  the  CMM  Development    Project \n(CMMDP) provides free gas connection and tariff subsidy to the poor so that they can have access to the clean energy \nfor their daily life. Moreover, the CMMDP will improve the safety of coal miners, who are mostly the poor people and \nimprove the quality of life for the local people. Overall, the supply of clean CMM will complement the poverty reduction \nefforts in the Shanxi Province. \n \nB. \nPoverty  analysis  has  been  conducted  as  an  integral  part  of  project  planning  and  design  and  with  the  use  of \nquantitative and qualitative methodologies. Various poverty data have been used in the analysis at national, provincial, \nmunicipal,  and  subproject  levels  through  field  poverty  assessments,  questionnaire  surveys  and  stakeholder \nconsultations,  including  with  the  project  beneficiaries  and  affected  people,  and  secondary  data  collection.  Extensive \nparticipatory  methods  have  been  used  to  assess  the  local  poverty  situation  and  energy  needs  of  the  poor.  Policy \ndialogue  has  been  undertaken  to  form  a  comprehensive  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  for  the  CMMDP  that \nincludes the following key components: \n \n1.  Providing clean energy supply to the poor: The CMMDP will directly benefit a total urban population of about \n410,000  in  the  project  beneficiary  area  of  Jincheng.  Of  the  total  beneficiary  population,  about  53,670  people  or \nabout  13.1%  of  the  total  beneficiaries  belong  to  the  poor  measured  by  the  local  urban  poverty  lines.  The \nincreased use of CMM is expected to decrease the use of conventional fuels such as raw coal and coal briquettes \nthat cause serious environmental and health impacts, which will indirectly benefit the entire population (particular \nfor the poor) residing in the municipality of Jincheng, which is home to about 221,500 of rural poor based on the \npoverty line of CNY1,000 and about 97,000 urban poor  who have an annual per-capita net income of less than \nCNY1,800 (weighted average) for urban areas. \n\nPoverty Analysis                                     Targeting Classification: General intervention \n\n \n2.  Creating  jobs  for  the  poor:  The  construction  of  the  CMMDP  will  create  about  1,200  full-time  jobs  during \nconstruction  and  845  during  operation.  Of  these,  about  780  full-time  jobs  for  the  poor  and  women  with  an \nestimated CNY8.5 million wage payment will go to the poor and women during construction and 420 full-time jobs \nduring operations or CNY4.6 million of the wage payments per year are expected to go to the poor and women. In \naddition, local procurement of the materials required for the program is expected to create additional jobs. \n\n \n3.  Reducing  air  pollution  and  air-related  diseases  for  the  poor:  The  development  and  increase  of  CMM  and \nCBM supplies and use will reduce air pollution by replacing the energy supplies from the coal-fired thermal power \nplants and other plants using coal as fuel and household coal burning for cooking and heating in the beneficiary \nurban areas. The CMMDP will substantially reduce the consumption of coal by an estimated 429,000 tons a year \nand result in annual air emission reduction of 7,866 tons  of particulate matter (PM), 4,901 tons of sulfur dioxide \n(SO2 );  2,077  tons  of  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx);  and  612,058  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2). The  improvement  of  air \nquality  will  reduce  the  morbidity  and  mortality  rate  of  air-related  diseases  and  associated  medical  costs,  loss  of \nhealthy working days, as well as human suffering. The poor, elderly, children, and women, who have less coping \nresources  and  are  more  vulnerable,  will  benefit  disproportionately  from  the  replacement  of  coal  and  wood.  In \nparticular, women usually spend more time than men on cooking and the length of their exposure to indoor house \nair  pollution  from  cooking  and  heating  is  considerable  higher  than  men.  As  such,  the  CMMDP  would  bring  to \nwomen much greater benefits than to men. A recent medical study in the PRC indicates that the incidence rate of \nrespiratory  diseases  (such  as  asthma,  chronic  bronchitis,  throat  infection,  and  tonsillitis)  amounts  to  77.78%  on \naverage  for  communities  using  individual  coal  stoves  for  cooking  and  space  heating,  which  is  50%  higher  than \nthat for areas where centralized heating is provided. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n58 \n \n \n4. \n\nInduced  socioeconomic  benefits  to  the  poor:  By  increasing  CMM  supplies  to  local  residents,  industries, \ncommercial  users,  and  public  institutions,  the  CMMDP  is  expected  to  result  in  major  improvement  of \nsocioeconomic  infrastructure  for  the  project  areas  and  promote  regional  economic  development  by  accelerating \nthe growth of the region\u2019s gross domestic product and by changing production process from manual- or coal- and \ndiesel-operated into methane gas-operated to improve the efficiency and product quality and output values, which \nin  turn  could  facilitate  poverty  reduction  in  the  region.  The  improved  urban  environment  can  improve  the  local \ninvestment climate to attract more investment to the region, and act as a catalyst for future development. It can \nalso have provisions for the growth of other sectors in the region in addition to industry and business, such as real \nestate,  transportation,  service,  recreation  and  tourism,  and  in  turn  will  increase  employment  opportunities  and \nincome  for  the  local  population  and  the  poor.  Moreover,  the  greater  availability  of  methane  gas  would  generate \nincreased local government tax revenues. A proportion of total revenues could be spent on the poverty reduction \nprograms on health, education, water supply and sanitation, employment schemes and so on. \n\nImproving  occupational  safety  of  poor  miners:  The CMMDP would also help reduce the risk of underground \nmethane gas explosions during coal mining, which account for approximately 80% of the coal mine accidents. The \nofficial death rate in Shanxi Province is approximately 5\u20136 persons per million tons of coal mined. The supply of \nmethane  gas  will  replace  the  use  of  coal  which  would  translate  into  the  reduction  in  the  loss  of  up  to  5  human \nlives  a  year  from  mine  accidents.  It  would  also  set  an  example  for  other  coal  mines  as  how  to  improve  CMM \ndrainage. The CMMDP will increase the safety of coal miners. As most of the coal miners are the poor people, the \nsaved lives from the CBM and CMM development and use would therefore accrue to the poor.  \n\n \n6.  Enhancing quality of life for the poor: The socioeconomic survey results show that the vast majority of the local \nresidents (92%) consider that the CMMDP will improve the overall quality of life, 87% consider that the supply of \nCMM will reduce the housework for women, 75% believe that the CMMDP will reduce health problems, and 50% \nbelieve that the CMMDP will improve heating. \n\nImplementing  gas  supply  assistance  programs  to  the  poor:  To  make  the  CMMDP  more  effective  in \nencouraging  the  poor  to  use  more  clean  energy  and  ensure  that  the  poor  will  benefit  directly  from  the  CMMDP \nand facilitate the poverty reduction efforts in the project area, the following key poverty reduction programs have \nbeen  agreed  and  will  be  implemented  by  the  Shanxi  provincial  government  (SPG),  Jincheng  Anthracite  Mining \nGroup  Limited  (JMC),  Shanxi  Energy  CBM  Company  Limited  (SECC),  and  Jincheng  CMM  Comprehensive \nUtilization Company Limited (JCCUC) as a result of proactive policy dialogue: \n\n(i)  JMC will put additional CNY1 million investment in expansion of the Sihe Mine Hospital (currently only serves \nthe  employees  of    the  Sihe  mine)  in  Jiafeng  township  in  2004  to  serve  over  70,000  local  people,  including \nabout 7,000 poor people, who are facing difficulties of poor economic, transportation and medical conditions, \nand access to doctors. The expansion of the hospital  will improve the quality and services (in particular the \nprovision  of  better  surgery  equipment  and  the  medical  beds)  of  the  hospital  for  local  community  residents \nwho would benefit from the services of the hospital and be able save transportation costs of CNY26 for each \nreturn trip or annual CNY61,000 in total for medical treatment in hospitals of Jincheng City 70 kilometers (km) \naway, or of Qinshui county 50 km  away. Most important, JMC will provide 15% or about CNY8 reduction per \nperson-times of medical cost for the poor living under minimum living guarantee (MLG). In addition, JMC will \nalso  construction  of  a  3-km  rural  gravel  road  from  Xiahe  to  Panzhuang  to  Xuwa  villages  (Panzhuang \ntownship, Qingshui county) with an investment of CNY1 million between 2005 and 2006 to serve about 5,000 \nlocal population, including about 500 poor persons.  \n\n(ii)  SECC will supply CMM  to an industrial zone in Yangcheng county, which is expected to attract investments \nof  a  minimum  of  CNY200  million  within  five  years.  The  replacement  of  coal  with  CMM  will  also  make  the \nexisting production process (i.e., ceramic products manufacturing) more environment-friendly. The industrial \nzone  is  expected  to  provide  3,500  jobs  for  local  poor  and  women  and  generate  about  CNY33.60  million  in \nincome per year; and, \n\n(iii) JCCUC  will  provide  free  gas  connection  and  50%  tariff  reduction  for  the  poor  households  in  the  CMM \ndistribution areas. Such a scheme is consistent with the ADB policy that tariff subsidy should be transparent \nand  explicit;  this  would  result  in  CNY3.124  million  savings  in  the  project  areas  in  terms  of  connection  fees \nand CNY0.37 million for the first year in terms of gas tariffs for 1,800 poor households registered under the \nMLG  program  of  the  Jincheng  Civil  Affairs  Bureau.  The  financing  will  come  from  respective  municipal  and \ncounty  finance  bureaus.  The  connection  exemption  and  gas  tariff  reduction  will  be  extended  on  a  gradual \nbasis to the remaining poor households in the project area.  \n\n \n5. \n\n \n7. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n59 \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \n \nC. \nStakeholder analysis:                                                                                                                           Yes \n \nStakeholder analysis has been conducted during the project preparation, including the identification of stakeholders, \ntheir needs from the CMMDP, and their roles in the CMMDP. The public consultation and participation process is the \ncore  element  of  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  CMMDP  and  is  prepared  through  participatory  approaches \ninvolving  various  stakeholders,  including  the  beneficiaries  and  affected  population.  A  community  participation  and \nawareness  program  will  be  formulated  and  implemented  by  JMC,  SECC,  and  JCCUC  to  serve  as  an  ongoing \nconsultation mechanism for the involvement of all stakeholders. \n \nParticipation strategy:                                                                                                                             Yes \n \nThe  community  participation  has  been  undertaken  during  the  planning  and  design  of  the  CMMDP.  Ongoing \nconsultations  will  be  carried  out  by  SPG,  JMC,  SECC,  and  JCCUC  during  the  resettlement  process  to  properly \naddress the needs and problems of the affected people. Further consultations will also be undertaken to understand \nand meet their evolving needs and expectations of the CMM users as well as increase the awareness of the public, \nespecially  the  beneficiaries,  about  the  benefits  of  the  CMMDP  and  encourage  the  active  involvement  of  local \ncommunities to maximize their support to the CMMDP, promote CMM consumption and savings and raise the social \nacceptance of user fees. The consultations can take the forms of annual questionnaire surveys by consumer category, \ncombined with ad hoc community forums. Women\u2019s organizations and schools usually have extensive networks that \ncan be used for the distribution of information materials and survey questionnaires. \n \nD.            Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nIn order to maximize the project benefits to women, preferential policies  will be given to  women for the employment \nand  training  opportunities  generated  from  the  project  construction  and  operation  phases,  and  the  proposed  poverty \nreduction  programs  of  the  CMMDP.  Women\u2019s  needs  and  interests  will  be  fully  represented  in  the  implementation  of \nthe CMMDP. A proactive employment policy and targeted training programs for the women will be adopted by JMC, \nSECC, and JCCUC. It is expected that 40% of the employment opportunities will be filled by women and the poor with \nthe implementation of gender equity policies.

By \n2006, the consumers are expected to spend about 2.8% more \nof  household \nincome  on  gas.  These  percentages  are \nconsidered  to  be  at  an  affordable  level.  The  impact  of \nexpenditure  increase  for  energy  is  considered  to  be  minimal \ngiven that the total percent paid by each household is currently \na small percentage of their total income. Impact on households \nin the lowest income bracket can be potentially significant but \nwill be mitigated through the reduction of monthly user fees. \n\nNot Significant  The  construction  and  operation  of  the  CMMDP  will  generate \nabout  2,050  jobs  for  local  beneficiaries.  No  job  and  income \nlosses are expected to take place.  \n\nNot Significant  There  are  about  900  minority  persons, \n\nincluding  Hui, \nMongolian,  Tibetan,  Miao,  Yi,  Buyi,  Korean,  Manchurian,  and \nTujia, who will benefit from the improved CMM supply. About 2 \nHui minority households in the project area will be affected by \nthe land  acquisition  and resettlement. Particular  attention and \nspecial provisions will be paid to them to ensure their interests \nand rights and socio-cultural customs will be protected. These \nprovisions  are  presented  in  the  resettlement  plans  and \nsummary  resettlement plan. \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CBM  =  coalbed  methane,  CMM  =  coal  mine  methane,  CMMDP  =  CMM  Development  Project, \nJCCUC = Jincheng Comprehensive CMM Utilization Company Limited, JMC = Jincheng Anthracitel Mining Group Limited, MLG = \nminimum living guarantee, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, SPG = Shanxi  provincial government, km = kilometers \nSource: Project implementation agencies. \n \n1  IPSA/SPRSS criteria for assessing the significance of social issues available at the ADB Handbook for Poverty and \n\nSocial Analysis. \n\n2   If not known, a contingency should be included in the TA budget to predict the need of a plan.  \n3   A plan will be required at design stage if any of the potential issues are found significant. \n4  Significant involuntary resettlement requires a full resettlement plan; not significant requires a short resettlement plan. \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 November 2004) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "\u2013  Yuan (CNY) \n", " \n", "$0.1208 \n= \n=  CNY8.2768 \n \nThe exchange rate of the yuan is determined in relation to a weighted basket of currencies of the \ntrading partners of the People\u2019s Republic of China.
