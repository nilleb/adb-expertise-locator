        " \n \nLOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY \n \n \nBorrower  The People\u2019s Republic of China \n   \nClassification  Targeting: General intervention \nSector: Energy \nSubsector: Energy sector development \nTheme: Environmental sustainability \nSubthemes: Global and regional transboundary environmental \nconcerns and issues, cleaner production, and control of industrial \npollution \n   \nEnvironment  Category B. An Initial Environmental Examination was undertaken. \nAssessment \n   \nProject Description  The Project will establish a coal mine methane development project \n(CMMDP) at Jincheng in the southern part of Shanxi Province with \nthe following components: (i) Part A, coalbed methane (CBM) and \ncoal  mine  methane  (CMM)  production  for  a  power  plant  of  120 \nmegawatts (MW); (ii) Part B, CMM transmission and distribution to \nconsumers  in  the  Jincheng  area;  and  (iii)  Part  C,  institutional \nstrengthening and capacity building.  \n \nRationale  In 2003, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) produced about 1.7 \nbillion tons of coal. Coal mining causes the release of methane, a \ngreenhouse gas (GHG), which is about 21 times more potent than \ncarbon dioxide (CO ), into the atmosphere. PRC coal mines release \n2\nmore than 6 billion cubic meters (m3) of methane each year. With \nincreasing coal production and depth of coal mining, this amount will \nincrease. Methane is highly explosive and needs to be removed \n(drained)  during  underground  coal  mining  operations  to  keep \nworking conditions safe. Each year at least 7,000 miners die from \nunderground  accidents,  mainly  caused  by  methane  explosions. \nTherefore,  increased  removal,  capture,  and  use  of  methane  will \n(i) reduce GHG emissions, (ii) increase clean fuel use (methane in \nplace of coal), (iii) improve air quality, and (iv) improve coal mine \nsafety and efficiency. The increased production and use of CMM and \nCBM require new technologies that are not yet used in the PRC. \nA project demonstrating that such new technologies can be applied \nin  the  PRC  would  catalyze  development  of  similar  projects \nelsewhere  in  the  country.  Southern  Shanxi  Province  has  highly \nmethane-rich coal mines. After careful study of potential coal mining \nareas by Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed consultants, the \narea around Jincheng was selected as most suitable for establishing \na demonstration project. Part A of the Project will demonstrate the \nmore  efficient  production  of  CBM,  and  drainage  and  capture  of \nCMM, and their use for power generation as a least-cost alternative\n ",
        "iv \n  using  new  technologies.  Part  B  will  demonstrate  the  efficient \ncommercial  use  of  CMM  for  transmission  and  distribution  to \nconsumers.  Part  C  will  institutionally  strengthen  the  companies \ninvolved in the CMMDP and promote similar projects in the PRC.  \n   \nObjective  The  main  objective  of  the  CMMDP  is  to  establish  a  CMM \ndevelopment project that covers all aspects of effective and efficient \nCMM and CBM production, capture, and utilization by applying the \nlatest  technologies,  i.e.,  improved  CBM  production  from  vertical \nsurface wells and directionally drilled wells from the surface into \nunderground coal seams, improved CMM drainage through the use \nof underground directional drilling and other modern equipment and \nmaterials, CMM-based power generation using internal combustion \ngas  engines,  and  transmission  and  distribution  of  CMM  for \nresidential,  commercial,  and  industrial  use.  In  this  manner  the \nCMMDP  will  improve  mine  safety,  reduce  GHG  emissions,  and \nimprove the environment. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $237  million  equivalent, \ncomprising a foreign exchange cost of $140 million (59%) and a local \ncurrency cost of $97 million equivalent (41%). \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $117.4  million  to  finance  part  of  the \nforeign  exchange  cost  of  the  CMMDP  and  part  of  its  consulting \nservices, while Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) will \nprovide a parallel loan of $20 million to finance the foreign exchange \ncost of CBM and CMM production under part A of the CMMDP. The \nUnited  States  Trade  and  Development  Agency  (USTDA)  has \nprovided a grant of $500,000 to finance international and domestic \nconsulting services for construction of the CMM-fired power plant. \nThe remaining foreign exchange cost of $2.6 million and local cost of \n$96.5 million equivalent will be financed through equity contributions \nof $61.2 million equivalent from Jincheng Anthracite Mining Group \nCompany Limited (JMC), Shanxi Energy Industries Group Limited \n(SEIG), and Jincheng municipal government and a loan of $37.9 \nmillion equivalent from the Industrial Commercial Bank of China. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $117.4 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a 24-year term including a grace \nperiod of 4 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% \nper annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nLoan and Project Agreements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The loan proceeds will be relent by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to \nTerms  the Shanxi provincial government (SPG) through a subsidiary loan \nagreement on the same terms and conditions. SPG will onlend the \nloan  proceeds,  either  directly  or  through  the  Jincheng  municipal \ngovernment,  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  to  the  project \nimplementing agencies (PIAs).

        "v \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  January 2005\u2013June 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project   \nCompletion Date  31 December 2008 \n   \nExecuting Agency  SPG \n   \nImplementation  SPG,  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  CMMDP,  has  established  a \nArrangements   project  management  office  (PMO).  Parts  A  and  B  will  be \nimplemented by three PIAs: JMC for part A, and Shanxi Energy CBM \nCompany Limited (SECC) for the CMM transmission component and \nJincheng  CMM  Comprehensive  Utilization  Company  Limited \n(JCCUC) for the CMM distribution component under part B. SPG will \nimplement part C in consultation with the PIAs. JBIC and ADB will \ncoordinate implementation of the various project components.  \n   \nProcurement  Equipment, materials, and civil works financed from the proceeds of \nthe ADB loan will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. Equipment, materials, and technical services for \nCBM  and  CMM  production  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nJBIC\u2019s guidelines for procurement. Items financed by the PIAs with \nlocal currency funds will be procured following bidding procedures \nacceptable to ADB. ADB has agreed to advance procurement action \nand,  subject  to  Board  approval,  retroactive  financing.  Total \nretroactive  financing  of  procured  goods  and  provided  consulting \nservices will be limited to $10 million.  \n \nConsulting Services  Under part A, ADB will provide 18 person-months of international \nconsulting services and 65 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices to help JMC supervise CMM drainage and CBM production. \nAt  the  same  time,  USTDA  will  provide  12  person-months  of \ninternational and 8 person-months of domestic consulting services to \nassist JMC (i) select the most efficient detailed design for the power \nplant, (ii) procure the required equipment and materials for the power \nplant, and (iii) supervise its construction and commissioning. Under \npart B, ADB will provide 6 person-months of international and 28 \nperson-months of domestic consulting services to assist SECC and \nJCCUC with project management and implementation. Under part C, \nADB will provide 14 person-months of international and 40 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services to assist the PMO, SEIG, \nand the PIAs with institutional strengthening and capacity building. \nADB-financed domestic consultants under parts A and B will help \nJMC, SECC, and JCCUC develop indicators and benchmarks to \nmeasure the long-term economic, social, and environmental impact \nof the respective project components. ADB has agreed to retroactive \nfinancing of the consulting services. Total retroactive financing of \nprocured goods and provided consulting services will be limited to \n$10 million. \n \n   ",
        "vi \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  CMMDP  will  demonstrate  the  feasibility  of  using  new \nBeneficiaries  technologies for CBM and CMM production, capture, and use, and \n  promote  the  development  of  similar  projects  in  the  PRC.  In  the \nJincheng area, the CMMDP will improve mine safety and air quality \nby replacing polluting fuels such as coal, fuel wood, synthetic \u201cwaste\u201d \ngas, and petroleum-based fuels, with CBM and CMM, equivalent to \nabout 265 million m3 of methane a year. The CMMDP will save \n429,310 tons of coal a year (approximately two thirds from clean \npower generation and one third from fuel switching by industrial and \nmunicipal supply customers). Annual emissions reductions are 7,866 \ntons  of  particulate  matter  (PM);  4,901  tons  sulfur  dioxide  (SO ); \n2\n2,077 tons of nitrogen oxides (NO ); and 612,058 tons of carbon \nx\ndioxide (CO ) as a result of energy efficiency gains. Reductions in \n2\nPM, SO , and NO  will improve local air quality and reduce regional \n2 x\nacid precipitation. Global benefits will result from methane capture \nand CO  reductions generated by fuel switching. The CMMDP is \n2\nestimated to reduce CO  equivalent (CO e) emissions by at least 4.4 \n2 2\nmillion tons a year. The CMMDP therefore has good potential to \nattract funds under the clean development mechanism (CDM) under \nthe Kyoto Protocol or similar arrangements as it will help reduce \nGHG emissions. \n \nThe Prototype Carbon Fund has finalized an agreement with MOF to \npurchase 3 million tons of CO e in emission reductions from the \n2\nCMMDP, at a unit price of $4.25 per ton of CO e, for a total contract \n2\nvalue  of  about  $12.75  million.  However,  the  finalization  of  the \nagreement is subject to approval by the CDM executive board of the \nmethodology used to calculate the CO e emission reductions. \n2\n \nThe economic and financial internal rates of return for the whole \nCMMDP are satisfactory at 23.4% (with local environmental benefits) \nand  6.5%,  respectively.  The  CMMDP\u2019s  poverty  impact  ratio  is \nestimated at 16.7%.  \n \nThe CMMDP will provide social benefits for the poor by (i) providing \nthem  with  clean  and  affordable  energy,  (ii)  creating  jobs, \n(iii) reducing air pollution and related health impacts, (iv) improving \nthe socio-economic environment, (v) improving occupational safety \nfor miners, and (vi) improving their quality of life. The CMMDP will \ncreate about 1,200 fulltime jobs during construction and 845 during \noperation.  During  construction,  the  poor  and  women  will  fill  780 \npositions and earn about CNY8.5 million a year. Of the 845 positions \ncreated during the operations, 420 are expected to go to the poor \nand women, with about CNY4.6 million in wages a year. To further \nreduce poverty, JCCUC will connect poor households for free to the \nCMM distribution pipeline system and will apply a special pro-poor \nCMM tariff, which will reduce the poor\u2019s normal monthly user fees by \nabout 50%. \n \n   ",
        "vii \nRisks and Assumptions  The risks associated with the supply of the sufficient quantities of \n  CBM and CMM are minimal since the design of the CMM-fired power \nplant and the CMM transmission and distribution system are based \non  a  detailed  assessment  of  the  quantities  that  can  be  made \navailable under the CMMDP. CBM production and CMM drainage \nare to be carried out with assistance from experienced international \nexperts. In case of any shortfall in the overall supply of methane, \nSPG will allocate CMM from other mines in the vicinity of the power \nplant.  In  the  CMM  transmission  and  distribution  component, \navailable CMM supplies at various mines exceed the projected CMM \ndemand  under  the  pipeline  to  ensure  adequate  supplies.  The \ntechnical  and  completion  risks  associated  with  introducing  new \ntechnologies for CBM production, CMM drainage, and CMM-based \npower generation have been adequately addressed by (i) including \nconsulting services for project implementation (including preparing \nthe detailed design of the power plant with assistance from USTDA-\nfinanced consultants) under the CMMDP, and (ii) requiring that the \nsupplier  of  the  power  generation  equipment  be  responsible  for \nsupervision of the first year of operation and maintenance work after \nthe commissioning of the first 50% of power generation capacity. \nJMC has established a separate company unit to operate the power \nplant  while  SEIG  and  the  Jincheng  municipal  government  have \nestablished separate companies to construct and operate the CMM \ntransmission  and  distribution  systems,  thus  ensuring  financial \nsustainability of their operations. \n ",

        " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit to you for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nloan to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Coal Mine Methane Development Project \n(CMMDP). The Project Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Economic and social development in the PRC in the last two decades has been rapid. By \nthe end of 2003 the PRC\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was $1,000 equivalent, life \nexpectancy at birth 71.4 years, and adult literacy 83%. Government programs have resulted in \npoverty reduction, particularly in rural areas. \n \n3.  Economic growth has been facilitated by infrastructure development, a crucial component \nbeing energy sector development. At the end of June 2004, the PRC\u2019s total installed power was \n400 gigawatts (GW), and in 2003, total electricity generated was 1,891 terawatt-hours, 15.4% more \nthan in 2002. Worldwide the PRC ranked second in installed power generation capacity and \nelectricity consumption. Based on higher-than-projected growth in electricity demand from 2001 to \n2003, the 4.5-5.0% annual increase in electricity consumption forecast in the 10th Five-Year Plan \n(FYP), 2001-2005, has proved to  be too conservative and power shortages are emerging in \nvarious regions. Nearly three quarters of the PRC's electricity is generated by coal and a little \nunder one quarter by hydroelectricity. Together, oil, gas, and nuclear power account for less than \n1%.  \n \n4.  In view of the PRC's continual power shortage the Government is taking action\u2015 including \nlegislation\u2015to promote the development of renewable energy. State entities are drafting a law to \ncompel power grid companies to buy electricity generated by renewable energy sources, such as \nwater, wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and marine-based power, and all end users will share the \ncosts. The PRC has been slow to develop renewable energies because they are more expensive \nthan conventional energy sources. However, sharp increases in energy demand leave the PRC no \nother choice than to accelerate the use of renewable energy. \n \n5.  The PRC\u2019s coal production in 2003 was about 1.7 billion tons, 22% higher than in 2002. \nDuring 2004, coal production is expected to increase to about 1.9 billion tons, which will mainly be \nused in the domestic market, with only about 80.0 million tons being exported and stockpiles \ndwindling.1 Coal is expensive to transport and inefficient to use, but cheap to produce: about $12-\n13 equivalent per ton for the large mines (around $6 equivalent for small ones). The PRC\u2019s proven \nrecoverable coal reserves are estimated at 114.5 billion tons.2 On this basis the PRC could \ncontinue the current level of coal production for 105 years. Despite the envisaged increase in use \nof natural gas following the ongoing and planned construction of the west-to- east gas transmission \npipeline and receiving terminals for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) along the east coast, coal \nwill remain the dominant fuel with a projected share of about 64% in primary energy consumption, \nand 75% in electricity generation by 2015. Coal consumption could increase to 3.3 billion tons a \nyear by 2020 assuming a continuation of the present economic growth rate and the Government\u2019s \nenergy policies.3 Appendix 2 provides an analysis of the coal sector. \n                                                 \n1   Coal imports are expected to remain relatively insignificant, at less than 10 million tons.   \n2   Total coal resources are estimated to be much higher, at around 1 trillion tons. \n3   However, doubling of present coal production and consumption levels would require large investments to develop \nnew coal mines and coal transportation infrastructure.  ",
        "2   \n6.  The  heavy  dependence  on  coal  as  an  energy  source  has  resulted  in  substantial \nenvironmental damage due to pollution from particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO ), nitrogen \n2\noxides (NO ), and other trace elements occurring in coal. SO  and NO  are the main causes of acid \nx 2 X\nrain, one of the largest environmental problems in the PRC and East Asia.  Approximately 80% of \nSO  originates from coal combustion in the power and industry sectors, which according to the \n2\nState Environmental Protection Administration, results in annual damage of $13.3 billion. A recent \nreport4  estimated  that  environmental  costs  of  urban  air  pollution  are  5%  of  GDP;  indoor  air \npollution,  2%;  and  acid  rain,  over  1%.  Carbon  dioxide  (CO )  is  another  by-product  of  coal \n2\ncombustion, which has negative global impacts. The PRC is the second largest CO -producing \n2\ncountry in the world, and if current trends continue, it will become the largest by 2020. About 63% \nof the major PRC cities do not meet grade II national air quality standards. The poor are most \nvulnerable to environment-induced diseases and are least capable of paying for adequate medical \nattention  for  respiratory  illnesses  associated  with  breathing  polluted  air.  With  rapid  economic \ndevelopment  expected  to  continue,  emissions  per  unit  of  GDP  must  decline  significantly  to \nmaintain the present level of polluting emissions. If the Government does not provide stronger \nincentives to abate polluting emissions, environmental damage will continue to increase. \n7.  Coal production results in the emission of methane,5 a greenhouse gas (GHG). When \nreleased into the atmosphere, GHGs contribute to global warming. Methane is approximately 21 \ntimes more potent than CO . In 2002, PRC coal mines vented about 10 billion-12 billion cubic \n2\nmeter (m3) of methane into the atmosphere. As coal mining operations go deeper underground, \nthis volume is expected to increase.6 Methane produced by coal is called coalbed methane (CBM) \nwhen released through wells, which are drilled from the surface into underground coal seams, and \ncoal mine methane (CMM)7 when it is released through mine shafts.8 If captured, methane could \nbe a clean energy source. \n8.  CBM is adsorbed onto the internal surface of the coal seam and is released as a result of \npressure changes when underground coal is mined or exposed to surface conditions. Underground \nCMM is highly explosive and needs to be removed during, and sometimes before, actual coal-\nmining operations to ensure that underground coal mines can be operated safely. Many coal mines \nhave  a  high  methane  content  and  inefficient  CMM  drainage  is  the  main  cause  of  frequent \nunderground explosions, which resulted in the death of more than 7,000 miners in 2003, and of \nover 4,100 during the first half of 2004.9 The PRC has many more coal mine related fatalities than \nother coal mining countries, mainly due to differences in mine operation management, safety \nstandards, and miners\u2019 working hours.10  In August 2003, the Government announced that in 2004 \nit would invest CNY2.2 billion (about $265 million equivalent) to improve workplace safety for coal \nminers, mainly by installing more efficient CMM drainage systems.  \n9.  The  Government  is  providing  preferential  policies  and  tax  incentives  to  private  sector \ninvestors for CBM exploration and production in virgin coal areas. In 1996, the China United \nCoalbed Methane Corporation Limited was established to attract foreign investors and technology \nto develop the PRC\u2019s CBM sector and to act as joint venture partner for CBM exploration and \nproduction activities. However, a successful CBM development project using surface wells drilled \n                                                 \n4   ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to the Peoples\u2019 Republic of China for the Promotion of Clean Technology \n(Cluster). Manila (Subproject 1, Final Report, 15 October 2001). \n5   Methane is a non-toxic combustible gas and the primary constituent (about 98%) of natural gas.  \n6   The International Energy Agency projects that the PRC\u2019s increase in GHG emissions between 2000 and 2030 will \nnearly equal the increase of the entire industrialized world.  \n7    Since mainly CMM is produced in the PRC and will be under the CMMDP, all coal-associated methane will be called \nCMM unless the reference is specifically to CBM.  \n8   In the PRC, coal is mainly produced underground, and only about 5% is produced through open cast mining.  \n9   Small-scale coal mines that produce 300,000 tons or less a year, account for about 50% of total annual coal \nproduction and for about 70% of the accidents. Underground methane gas explosions account for approximately \n80% of coal mine accidents. \n10   To improve safety and health conditions in PRC coal mines the United States Labor Department is providing \ntechnical assistance, which is financed by a grant of $2.3 million. \n ",
        "3 \ninto virgin coal seams has not yet been developed on a commercial scale in the PRC.11 Through \npreferential policies the Government is also encouraging coal mines to increase CMM capture and \nuse. Some coal mines use the produced CMM for inefficient small-scale power generation or \ndistribution to households. However, CMM use is small, and less than 10% of the vented CMM has \nbeen properly drained. Total CBM resources up to a depth of 2,000 meters are estimated at 30 \ntrillion-35 trillion m3. Based on experience in the United States, approximately 10% of these CBM \nresources (3.0-3.5 trillion m3) could be developed into proven reserves that can be produced \nthrough surface wells and used as fuel. This is equivalent to about 100 years of the PRC\u2019s current \nnatural gas production rate. \n10.  In October 1996, ADB provided technical assistance (TA) to explore opportunities and \nidentify priority areas for developing a CBM demonstration project.12 This was followed in October \n1998 by another ADB-financed TA for the preparation of a commercially viable CMM (production \nand  use)  demonstration  project.13  The  TA  confirmed  the  feasibility  of  establishing  a  CMM \ndemonstration project.14 However, the mining company chose to explore private sector investments \nfor converting the CMM into methanol. This did not constitute the most economic option, and the \nproject could, therefore, no longer be supported by the Government.15  Subsequently, in early \n2002, the Government requested an expansion of the TA by including the coal-mining area in \nsouthern Shanxi Province, which is operated by the Jincheng Anthracite Mining Group Company \nLimited  (JMC).  ADB  provided  supplementary  TA  in  June  200216  to  study  this  proposal.  The \nfeasibility study was completed in July 2003. \n11.   Shanxi covers 156,000 square kilometers in the north-central PRC and has a population of \nmore than 32 million. The province has mountainous areas, rolling hills, and the loess plateau of \nthe Fen River valley. Major cities in valleys often experience thermal inversions that lead to severe \nair pollution. The provincial capital, Taiyuan, with about 3 million people, is the industrial center. \nShanxi is a poor inland province with a nominal GDP per capita of CNY6,146 in 2002, equivalent to \n75.1% of the national average (CNY8,184), ranking 21st among 31 provinces. In terms of urban \nincome per capita, Shanxi ranks 22nd. It accounts for about one third of total coal production in the \nPRC and has many typical examples of the major pollution problems. \n12.  The air quality of Shanxi is among the worst of any region in the PRC. It includes 3 of the \nPRC\u2019s 10 most polluted cities. The environmental problems are closely related to the use and \ntransport  of  coal.  In  13  of  the  15  cities  reviewed  by  the  Shanxi  Environment  Protection \nAdministration in 2002,17 annual daily average PM concentrations exceeded class-II standards for \nair quality in residential, general industrial, and agricultural areas.18 Based on 2000 data, the national \nclass-III standards for PM in designated industrial zones were exceeded in 10 of these cities, and \nSO  levels exceeded class-II standards in 12 cities during the same period. Province-wide, 9-10% \n2\n                                                 \n11   Foreign oil and gas companies are estimated to have invested more than $90 million in such CBM exploration and \ndevelopment.  \n12   ADB.1996.

The  annual  economic  losses  caused  by  pollution  in  2002  exceeded  3%  of  the \nprovincial GDP. Nearly 42% of this loss was caused by air pollution, 36% by water pollution, and \n22% by solid wastes.19 \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n13.  Jincheng  municipality,  located  in  southern  Shanxi,  has  2.11  million people.  Poverty  is \nwidespread:  about  221,500  are  rural  poor  and  about  97,000  urban  poor.20  The  municipality \nconsumes about 850,000 tons of coal annually, which causes annual emissions of SO  and PM of \n2\nabout 120,000 tons a year. Air quality is poor, with Class II standards for total PM achieved on only \n29 days during 2001 and on only 59 days in 2002. During the 10th FYP the Jincheng municipal \ngovernment (JMG) is implementing various environmental improvement activities to receive the \nGovernment\u2019s designation of \u201cenvironmental model city\u201d by 2005. The Blue Skies program of JMG \nis a key initiative that includes closure and relocation of heavily polluting enterprises; stricter \nenforcement  of  pollution  control  standards;  establishment  of  district  heating  systems;  and \nintroduction of cleaner fuels, including CMM, which is produced and vented by the numerous coal \nmines around Jincheng. The use of CMM will avoid the coal\u2019s environmentally harmful emissions. \nCMM and CBM are not yet used on a large commercial scale in the PRC and would require the \nintroduction of new, proven technologies for improving the drainage and capture of CMM from \nunderground coal mines, producing CBM from surface wells in advance of mining, and use CMM \nas a fuel for power generation. Better drainage and use of CMM will help to reduce the risk of \nunderground gas (CMM) explosions and support the Government\u2019s program to increase workers\u2019 \nsafety in coal mines. \n14.  The Sihe mine, with estimated coal reserves of 3.5 billion tons, is owned and operated by \nJMC. This mine was selected as a demonstration project for the large commercial use of CMM and \nCBM, following a detailed assessment of the CMM and CBM that could be made available with \nfurther development. The Sihe mine began operations in early 2002, when about 1.5 million tons of \ncoal (anthracite with a sulfur content of less than 1%) was produced. It produces about 435,000 m3 \nof CMM a day of which about 30% is captured and used and 70% is vented into the atmosphere. \nCoal production will increase to 8 million tons a year by 2008, when CMM drainage (captured \nCMM) reaches more than 500,000 m3 of CMM a day. CMM drainage could be considerably \nimproved and expanded, which would reduce mine ventilation costs since less air will need to be \npumped  into  the  mine  to  achieve  an  acceptable  level  of  CMM  concentration  in  the  air \nunderground.21 Well drilling from the surface into the coal seams before underground coal mining \nwill  contribute  to  cost-efficient  capture  of  CMM  once  underground  coal  mining  in  the  area \ncommences. \n15.  The Sihe mine requires electricity to operate. Because the mine\u2019s captive 58 MW coal-\nbased  power  generation  capacity  is  insufficient  to  meet  its  power  requirements,  electricity  is \npurchased  from  the  Shanxi  Electrical  Power  Company.  The  SO emissions  from  the  present \n2 \ncaptive power plants exceed national standards but are exempted from complying with them since \nthe plants provide heat and power and use low-grade waste coal\u2015a byproduct of coal production \nthat has no market.22  Based on the projected production of CMM and CBM at the Sihe mine, a  \n                                                 \n19   The production of each ton of coal causes a pollution-related economic loss of CNY15, and the generation of each \nkilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity causes a loss of CNY0.10. \n20   Based on local poverty lines; an annual per-capita net incomes of more than CNY1,000 (weighted average) for rural \nareas and CNY1,800 (weighted average) for urban areas.  \n21   Additional efficiency gains will be achieved in terms of improved methane content of the drained CMM, smaller \nrequired diameter of the pipes for draining the CMM, and lower vacuum pump operating costs as a result of the use \nof modern, properly sealed drainage pipes underground.  \n22   About 12 MW of this power generation capacity will be decommissioned in 2004, when two additional captive coal-\nbased power plants with a combined capacity of 100 MW will become operational.  These plants will comply with \nnational emission standards since they will be equipped with electrostatic precipitators and SO  scrubbers. \n2\n ",
        "5 \n120 MW23 power plant using the CMM and CBM as fuel is the least-cost alternative for power \ngeneration expansion along the Shanxi power grid. The power produced from the plant would \neventually meet about half of JMC\u2019s power requirements and make the construction of additional \npolluting captive coal-based power plants unnecessary. \n16.  Many other underground coal mines around Jincheng produce coal and release a total of \nabout 400 million m3 of CMM24 a year into the atmosphere. Such CMM can be used for heating \nand cooking use residential, commercial, and industrial consumers in Jincheng and adjacent towns \nand the use of CMM rather than coal will avoid harmful emissions. However, a transmission and \ndistribution pipeline system is needed to transport CMM from the mines to consumers. Such a \npipeline system will also promote additional CMM capture by mines since the pipeline system will \nenable them to sell the CMM to consumers.25  \n17.   The Air Pollution Control Law (amended in 2000-2001) provides the basis for a rational \nregulatory framework to promote clean energy development in an environment-friendly manner. \nThe law provides for emission trading, which has been pilot-tested in Taiyuan with ADB support.26 \nEmissions trading has begun in Taiyuan and the Shanxi provincial government (SPG) plans to \nexpand the trading mechanism to cover the entire province. On a smaller scale, the transmission \nand  distribution  of  CMM  has  been  demonstrated  as  viable  under  the  Shanxi  Environment \nImprovement Project.27  \n18.  A CMM development project that captures CMM and CBM (produced in advance of mining) \nand  avoids  their  release  into  the  atmosphere  has  considerable  potential  to  apply  the  clean \ndevelopment  mechanism  (CDM)  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  (or  similar  mechanism).  External \nagencies such as the World Bank, the United Nations Environmental Programme, and several \nbilateral agencies are actively involved in CDM related activities in the PRC. ADB is assisting \nsmall-scale  CDM  development  in  the  PRC.28  Because  of  the  PRC\u2019s  high  potential  for  GHG \nreduction,  several  external  agencies  have  expressed  interest  in  providing  assistance  for  the \nbaseline study that would determine net GHG reductions and, in particular, the certified emission \nreductions (CERs) that could be generated as a result of the CMMDP. Further assistance in this \nregard will also be provided under ADB\u2019s CDM Facility, which was established in 2003.29  \n19.  The CMMDP will directly benefit about 410,000 people in the urban Jincheng, including \nabout 53,700 persons (about 13%) who live under the local urban poverty line. Increased use of \nCMM will allow a gradual decrease in the use of raw coal and briquettes for cooking and heating, \nand thus reduce in- and outdoor air pollution (SO , CO , NO , and PM), which causes serious \n2 2 x\nenvironmental and health impacts (respiratory diseases), particularly for the poor. \nC.  Lessons Learned \n20.  ADB\u2019s  overall  experience  in  PRC  energy  and  environment  sector  projects  has  been \npositive.30  Projects  are  generally  well  designed  and  efficiently  implemented,  although  some \ndifficulties have emerged in certain projects, usually from inappropriate policies on energy pricing, \n                                                 \n23   The net effective power generation capacity would be 105.6 MW.  \n24    With an average methane content of 50%. \n25   This opportunity would increase considerably if the CMM transmission pipeline were to be connected with the major \nwest-east gas transmission pipeline, which runs to the north of Jincheng and is to transport natural gas from the \nXinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to eastern PRC. \n26   ADB. 2000.

However,  the \ncompleted Ping Hu Oil and Gas Development Project has been highly successful in substituting \nthe distribution and use of polluting coal gas with natural gas in Shanghai and has shown that a \nstrong  commitment  and  preparedness  by  project  components  as  well  as  the  involvement  of \nexperienced and well-trained project implementation staff and competent international consultants \nare important for projects that require the adoption of new technical designs and observance of the \napplicable safety and operating standards.32  Overall, the projects\u2019 general success is attributed to \n(i) extensive preparation before ADB intervention, (ii) high degree of local ownership, (iii) effective \nleadership in project management offices (PMOs), (iv) timely policy and enterprise reforms, and (v) \nfavorable market conditions. Although mobilizing of counterpart funds was sometimes delayed, in \nmost  cases  it  did  not  result  in  unsatisfactory  performance.  Ongoing  market  reforms  and \nrestructuring  of  the  power  sector  make  uncertain  the  continued  financial  viability  of  project \nenterprises, particularly those state-owned, which are in the early stages of autonomous and \ncommercial operations. \n21.  These  lessons  have  been  taken  into  account  in  project  design  and  preparation.  In \nparticular, the pricing of the electricity and CMM to be produced and consumed under the Project \nhas  been  set  at  appropriate  levels.  Staff  members  of  the  PMO  for  the  CMMDP  and  project \nimplementation  agencies  (PIAs)  have  already  participated  in  ADB  training  for  project \nimplementation and administration, and international consultants will help the PIAs during project \nimplementation.33 The CMMDP has been discussed with other external agencies34 involved or \ninterested in CMM and CBM mitigation, and efficiency and safety improvement activities in the coal \nsector. The CMMDP has also been presented at various conferences and workshops where it was \ndiscussed with private sector parties involved in CBM exploration and development. All support the \nCMMDP and consider it a timely activity that will catalyze for development of the PRC\u2019s CMM and \nCBM resources. Appendix 3 summarizes the external assistance provided to improve the PRC \nenvironment and, in particular, to develop CBM resources, and improve coal mine safety. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.   Objectives \n22.  The CMMDP will cover all aspects of effective and efficient CMM and CBM production, \ncapture, and use by applying the latest technologies. The CMMDP will include (i) improved CBM \nproduction  from  vertical  surface  wells  and  directionally  drilled  wells  from  the  surface;  \n(ii) improved CMM drainage through the use of underground directional drilling and other modern \nequipment  and  materials;  (iii)  CMM-based  power  generation  using  internal  combustion  gas \nengines; and (iv) transmission and distribution of CMM for residential, commercial, and industrial \nuse.  The  CMMDP  will  also  demonstrate  that  introducing  new  CMM  drainage  methods  and \ntechnology increases safety of underground coal mining operations and provides environmental \nand health benefits in terms of avoided emissions associated with alternatives if the CMMDP is not \nimplemented (e.g., additional coal-based power generation in the vicinity of the Sihe mine and \nrelease of substantial quantities of CMM and CBM into the atmosphere).

The proposed Project components are as follows. \n1.  Part A \u2013 Production of CMM and CBM for a 120 MW Power Plant  \n24.  This component includes all necessary civil works, equipment, technical and consulting \nservices, and training required to (i) improve CMM drainage and degasification by drilling CBM \nsurface wells at the Sihe mine, (ii) establish a 120-MW CMM-fired power plant and supply the \nrequired CMM and CBM35, and (iii) expand the power transmission lines and upgrade the power \ndistribution systems at the coal mining areas of JMC. CMM drainage will be improved through \ndirectional  drilling  of  long  inseam  boreholes  underground  and  installing  CMM  gathering  and \ndrainage systems. Degasification will take place as result of CBM production from surface wells \ndrilled into coal seams to be developed. This will include (i) drilling of up to 20 vertical wells and 1 \ndirectional well from the surface into coal seams, (ii) constructing gas gathering and pipeline \ntransportation systems, and (iii) installing safety and monitoring systems.  The power plant will \nconsist of internal combustion gas engines with an individual capacity of 1.5-3.5 MW, waste heat \nboilers, and steam turbines for power generation and will be built in two phases of 60 MW each. \nThe power plant will use about 182.4 million m3 of CMM and CBM36 a year. Training will be \nprovided in underground directional drilling and CMM collection, surface-well development for CBM \nproduction, and operation and maintenance of CMM-fired power plants. Consulting services will be \nprovided  for  project  implementation  and  on-site  training.  The  general  technical  design  of  the \nCMMDP is explained in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n  2.  Part B - CMM Transmission and Distribution \n25.  This component includes all necessary civil works, pipelines, storage tanks, compressors, \nand other equipment required to establish a CMM transmission and distribution pipeline system for \nsupply of CMM to Jincheng and Gaoping cities, and Yangcheng, Zezhou, Lingchuan, and Qinshui \ncounties. In Jincheng, an old pipeline network which distributed waste gas produced by a polluting \nfertilizer plant37 to about 7,000 households, will be upgraded and expanded. In Gaoping and the \nother counties, new pipeline systems will be built. By 2008, a total of about 90,000 households38 \nand various industries and commercial establishments will be served with a minimum of`166 million \nm3 of CMM39 a year. \n3.  Part C - Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building \n26.  Institutional strengthening and capacity building will be provided to JMC, the two PIAs for \npart B, the Shanxi Energy CBM Company Limited (SECC) for the CMM transmission component \nand  the  Jincheng  CMM  Comprehensive  Utilization  Company  Limited  (JCCUC)  for  the  CMM \ndistribution  component,  and  the  Shanxi  Energy  Industries  Group  Limited  (SEIG),  the  parent \ncompany of SECC. Consulting services and training will be provided in areas such as financial \nmanagement, enterprise reforms and governance, human resources development, performance \nmanagement,  environmental  and  benefits  monitoring,  and  energy  improvement  activities.  In \nparticular, the consultants will help identify specific cost control measures for the PIAs and SEIG. \n \n27.  Shanxi has enormous potential to develop CBM and CMM projects. Consulting services will \nbe provided to strengthen the regulatory framework for investing in CMM-use projects and the \n                                                 \n35   Such a power plant would be the largest in the world based on installed power generation capacity.  \n36   Based on a methane content of 100%. \n37   The fertilizer plant will be closed upon completion of the CMM distribution system. \n38   It is also envisaged that by 2008 an additional 20,000 households will receive CMM that has been transported by \ntruck to local distribution networks; however, this activity is outside the project scope. \n39   Based on average methane content of 50%. \n   ",

The CMMDP\u2019s results should be disseminated and other CMM and \nCBM projects developed in Shanxi with private sector and other investors, whether from the PRC \nor abroad. The CMMDP will also provide training and consulting services in these areas. \nC.   Special Features \n1.  Potential Benefits from the Clean Development Mechanism \n28.  The CMMDP has clear and appropriate CDM additionality,40 as it will (i) help remove policy \nbarriers to CMM and CBM development in the PRC, (ii) remove technological barriers to efficient \nextraction  and  production  of  CMM  and  CBM,  and  (iii)  remove  financial  barriers  for  financing \nmedium-  to  large-scale  CMM-based  power  generation.  Based  on  current  and  projected  gas \nproduction and use rates, a minimum of 4.4 million tons of CO  equivalent (CO e) emission \n2 2\nreductions a year will be achieved upon completion of the CMMDP. The World Bank\u2019s Prototype \nCarbon Fund has agreed in principle with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to purchase 3 million tons \nCO e in emission reductions from the CMM-fired power plant under the CMMDP, at $4.25 per ton \n2\nof CO e, for a total contract value of about $12.75 million. The emission reductions would be \n2\npurchased from the date of start of operations of the power plant, which is scheduled for early \n2006, until 2012, and would initially be traded as verified emission reductions (VERs).41 The \nPrototype Carbon Fund, with assistance from Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), has \nprepared a project design document for this purpose and submitted it to the CDM executive board \nfor approval. If the CMMDP fulfills all requirements of the Kyoto Protocol, and clearance of such \nsale is obtained from the CDM executive board, additional CERs that can be generated by the \nCMMDP could be offered to other potential buyers. ADB is planning to help MOF sell additional \nCERs from part A, and develop the CDM potential of part B. The relationship between the CMMDP \nand CDM is presented in more detail in Appendix 4.  \n2.  Maximizing the CMMDP\u2019s Impact on the Poor \n29.  The CMMDP will create about 1,200 full-time jobs during construction and 845 during the \noperation. During the construction, 780 positions, with an estimated CNY8.5 million in wages, will \nbe filled by the poor and women. During operations, 420 jobs representing CNY4.6 million of \nwages per year will go to the poor and women. As a result of ADB policy dialogue, JMC and SECS \nare planning to undertake a number of poverty reduction projects for local communities, which in \nthe case of JMC will be financed from the income generated from the CMM-fired power plant (see \npara. 59). 42  \n3.  Private Sector Participation \n30.  After the CMMDP has been completed and has demonstrated that a CMM-fired power plant \ncan be operated successfully in conjunction with ongoing coal mining activities, the potential for \nprivate sector participation in plant operation will be considerable. There is considerable potential \nto increase the power plant\u2019s installed capacity as the demand for power is expected to increase in \nthe coming years. The Government plans to amend the electricity law to improve the regulatory \nframework to commercialize power generation to attract more private investors. Private sector \nparticipation in the CMM-fired power plant would be realistic if sufficient progress were made in the \nongoing restructuring and reorganization of major coal companies into 9\u201310 large national ones, \nfollowed by their (partial) privatization; closure of small coal mines; and further deregulation of the \ncoal prices. Private sector participation in part B is not very attractive given the small scale of gas \n                                                 \n40   Reductions in emissions by sources of GHG that would occur in the absence of the proposed project activity. \n41   Prior to registration of the Project with the CDM Executive Board emission reductions generated by the Project are \nconsidered VERs. After registration the Project will generate emission reductions certified by the CDM Executive \nBoard, i.e., CERs.  \n42   Further, ADB is processing a project of $500,000, which is to be financed by the Department for International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom, to provide assistance for the training of laid-off miners for other jobs and skills \ndevelopment of new miners to enable them to be employed in mechanized mines.  \n ",

Options for private sector participation in \nthe CMM-fired power plant will be identified by the consultants to be recruited under part C and an \naction plan for attracting such participation will be developed by 2006.43 Similarly, a number of \nsmaller private coal mines in the project area are expected to opt to establish CMM-fired power \nplants with private sector investments after the CMMDP demonstrates the successful operation of \nthe power plant.  \nD.  Cost Estimates \n31.  Project cost estimates are summarized in Table 1. The total project cost is estimated at \n$237 million equivalent including physical and price contingency allowances and interest and other \ncharges during construction. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at $139.9 million and local \ncurrency  costs  at  $97.1  million  equivalent.

Financing Plan \n32.  The Government has requested an ADB loan of $117.4 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to finance part of the foreign exchange cost of the CMMDP and part of its consulting \nservices. The ADB loan will have a 24-year term including a grace period of 4 years, an interest \nrate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions as \nset forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these \nterms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision \nand not made relying on any communication or advice from ADB. JBIC will provide a parallel loan \nof $20 million to finance the foreign exchange cost of CMM and CBM production under part A. The \nJBIC loan is expected to have a 24-year repayment period, including a grace period of 4 years, an \ninterest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  JBIC\u2019s  LIBOR-based  basic  interest  rate \napplicable  for  untied  loans  to  the  PRC  denominated  in  USDollars,  no  front-end  fee,  and  a \ncommitment fee of 0.5% per annum, and such terms and conditions that will be set forth in the \nJBIC loan agreement. The United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) has provided a \ngrant of $500,000 to finance international and domestic consulting services for construction of the \nCMM-fired power plant. The remaining foreign exchange cost of $2.6 million and local cost of \n$96.5 million equivalent will be financed through equity contributions from JMC, SEIG, and JMG in \nthe total amount of $61.2 million equivalent, and a loan of $37.9 million equivalent from the \nIndustrial Commercial Bank of China. The Borrower will be the PRC, and loan proceeds will be re-\nlent through MOF to SPG, which in turn will on-lend part of these loan proceeds to JMC and SECC \nthrough on-lending agreements with the same terms and conditions as those of the loan. For \nimplementation of the CMM distribution component, SPG will channel another part of the loan \n                                                 \n43   The action plan will be discussed between SPG and ADB during a mid-term review of the Project, scheduled for \nearly 2007.  \n   ",
        "10   \nproceeds to JMG for on-lending to JCCUC under a third onlending agreement, which again will \nincorporate the same terms and conditions as the head loan. The foreign exchange and interest \nvariation  risks  of  the  loan  will  be  borne  by  the  PIAs.  The  signing  of  the  three  on-lending \nagreements  between  SPG  and  JMC,  SPG  and  SECC,  and  JMG  and  JCCUC,  in  form  and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, will be a condition of loan effectiveness.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n33.  SPG, the Executing Agency for the CMMDP, has established a PMO in Taiyuan, staffed by \na Project director and five professional staff. The CMMDP will be implemented by three PIAs. JMC \nwill implement Part A and has established an independent company unit (JMC-CU) to operate the \npower plant. SECC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SEIG, will implement and operate the CMM \ntransmission component, and JCCUC, wholly-owned by JMG, will implement and operate the CMM \ndistribution component under Part B. The PMO, in consultation with the PIAs, will implement part \nC. Each PIA will establish a project implementation office (PIO) headed by a director and staffed by \nadequate  personnel  to  supervise  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  subprojects.  The  PMO's \nresponsibilities include (i) overall coordination, macro-level project management, and monitoring, \nincluding implementation of policy reforms and other institutional measures,44 (ii) annual budget \npreparation and monitoring of the use of loan proceeds; (iii) quality assurance; (iv) progress \nreporting  to  SPG  and  ADB,  including  reports  on  cost  management,  project  impact,  and \nenvironmental  impact  assessment;  (v)  interagency  coordination  and procurement  support;  (vi) \nfacilitation of training; (vii) ensuring of compliance with loan covenants, and (viii) development and \nmaintenance of a project Internet site to provide public access to basic information about project \nactivities, the status of the implementation schedule, procurement process, and resettlement plans. \nThe PMO is developing a Website that will provide information about all aspects of the CMMDP to \ninterested  parties,  including  its  general  design  and  objectives,  construction  and  progress \nschedules,  procurement  arrangements  and  packages,  required  consulting  services,  and  CDM \npotential. JBIC and ADB will coordinate implementation of the various project components. SPG, \nJBIC, and ADB are envisaged to conduct a midterm review of the CMMDP in early 2007.  \n                                                 \n44   A steering committee chaired by a provincial vice-governor has been established to provide guidance and policy \ndirection in the preparation and implementation of the Project. The steering committee comprises senior officials of \nthe concerned departments in Shanxi Province and Jincheng. \n ",
        "11 \n \n34.  The PIOs are responsible for administration, financial, and technical supervision of the \nsubprojects and their implementation. The PIOs will manage (i) day-to-day implementation of their \ncomponents;  (ii)  engagement  of  consultants;  (iii) coordination  with  the  concerned  domestic \nprocurement agency; (iv) submission of all procurement and related documents for ADB approval; \n(v) preparation and evaluation of bids and recommendations on award of contracts; (vi) preparation \nand submission of quarterly reports on the subprojects, and financial statements of the enterprises \nto ADB; (vii) procurement of equipment and materials financed under local currency funds; (viii) \nmanagement  and  reporting  of  the  human  resource  development  and  training  programs;  (ix) \nsupervision of civil works, installation, and commissioning of the subproject facilities; and (x) liaison \nwith concerned government agencies as required.  \n2.  Implementation Period \n35.  Construction of project facilities is envisaged to take 4 years, from early 2005 to the end of \n2008. The site for the CMM-fired power plant has been prepared, and routing of CMM transmission \nand distribution pipelines and the location of the related facilities have been finalized. A Project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n3.  Procurement \n36.  ADB-financed procurement will include the procurement of equipment, materials, and civil \nworks. Under part A, ADB-financed procurement will include the supply of all internal combustion \ngas engines, including auxiliary equipment, that will be used for power generation and the supply \nof power transmission lines. JMC will undertake the procurement of all other required equipment \nand goods for the power plant as well as the construction of all related civil works. JBIC-financed \nequipment, materials, and technical services for CMM and CBM production will be procured in \naccordance with procurement procedures agreed between the Borrower and JBIC and acceptable \nto ADB.45 Under part B, ADB-financed procurement for the CMM transmission component will \ninclude the procurement of pipes, equipment, and materials as well as the selection of civil works \ncontractors for construction of the control center and gas gathering stations while for the CMM \ndistribution component it will include the procurement of pipes, valves, regulators, storage tanks, \nand other related equipment. All goods and civil works to be procured under the CMMDP that are \nto be wholly or partly financed by ADB, will be procured in accordance with the ADB's Guidelines \nfor Procurement under Asian Development Bank Loans. Most items that will be financed by ADB \nwill  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  through \nseparate tenders using ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents. ICB bid packages have been identified \nfor this purpose. Other items costing less than $500,000 will be procured on the basis of ADB\u2019s \ninternational shopping (IS) procedures. The selection of the civil works contractors for construction \nof the control center and gas gathering stations for the CMM transmission component under part B \nwill be done on the basis of local competitive bidding (LCB) and the indirect foreign exchange cost \nof the contracts will be financed from the ADB loan.46 All other civil works construction activities \nunder the CMMDP will be financed from local currency funds. All procurement activities under the \nCMMDP  irrespective  of  the  source  of  financing  will  be  managed  by  domestic  procurement \nagencies selected by the PIAs. These are well qualified to perform these tasks and have previous \nexperience in other externally funded projects. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy \nwill be included in all documents and contracts during bidding and implementation of the CMMDP. \nItems financed by the PIAs with local currency funds will be procured following bidding procedures \nacceptable to ADB.  A list of indicative procurement packages to be financed by ADB is in \nAppendix 7. \n                                                 \n45   Including drilling machines, CMM drainage pumps, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes and fittings, HDPE pipe \nfusion machines, and services for vertical drilling of up to 20 CBM wells and directional drilling of 1 CBM well. \n46   Each contract is estimated at less than $1 million equivalent and the indirect foreign exchange costs are estimated at \n50% of the respective contract amounts. \n   ",
        "12   \n4.  Consulting Services \n37.  Under part A, ADB will provide 18 person-months of international and 65 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services to assist JMC supervise CMM drainage and CBM production. At the \nsame time USTDA will provide a grant of about $500,000 to fund 12 person-months of international \nand 8 person-months of domestic consulting services to help JMC (i) select the most efficient \ndetailed design for the power plant, (ii) procure the required equipment and materials for the power \nplant, and (iii) supervise construction and commissioning of the first phase of 60 MW. Under part B, \nADB will provide 6 person-months of international consulting services and 28 person-months of \ndomestic  consulting  services47  to  assist  SECC  and  JCCUC  with  project  management  and \nimplementation. Under part C, ADB will provide 14 person-months of international and 40 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services48 for institutional strengthening and capacity building in \nJMC, SEIG, SECC, and JCCUC, and for promoting the development of additional CBM and CMM \nprojects in Shanxi. The international consultants to be financed by ADB under parts A, B, and C \nwill be provided through three separate packages. Their services will be provided through the \nselection of a consulting firm for each package following the submission of simplified technical \nproposals (and financial proposals) and the use of the quality- and cost-based selection method in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Selection and engagement of \ndomestic consultants will be done in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to ADB. The \nproposed outline terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n  5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n38.  SPG will adopt any of the following disbursement procedures for withdrawal of proceeds of \nthe loan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook: (i) a direct payment procedure, \nwherein ADB, at the request of the PMO, pays a designated beneficiary directly; (ii) a commitment \nprocedure, wherein ADB, at the request of the PMO, provides an undertaking to reimburse a \ncommercial bank for payments made or to be made to a supplier against a letter of credit financed \nfrom the loan account; or an imprest account procedure, wherein ADB, at the request of the PMO, \nadvances funds to the concerned PIAs for payment of civil works contracts, local consultants, or \ntraining. The initial amount to be deposited to the imprest account will be based on projected six-\nmonths expenditures or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The statement of expenditure \nprocedure may be used to liquidate or replenish advances to the imprest account or reimburse any \neligible expenditures for any individual payment not to exceed $200,000. The reimbursement \nprocedure will be used for disbursements with regard to any eligible retroactive financing. \n6.  Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n39.  In view of the advanced stage of project preparation, ADB has agreed to (i) advance action \nto procure internal combustion gas engines from 18 March 2004, and (ii) retroactive financing for \neligible expenses incurred and paid for with regard to consulting services and procurement of \ninternal combustion gas engines up to $10 million from 18 March 2004.49 The Borrower and SPG \nhave been advised that the advance actions and retroactive financing do not commit ADB to \nfinancing the CMMDP. \n  7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n40.  The accounting, auditing, and reporting systems and procedures for the CMMDP will be in \naccordance with the Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment \nProjects Financed by ADB. Each PIA will maintain separate accounts of the operations of its part of \nthe CMMDP and submit through the PMO to ADB audited project accounts and agency financial \n                                                 \n47   The  domestic  consultants  engaged  under  Parts  A  and  B  will  each  include  10  person-months  to  develop   \nbenchmarks and indicators for measurement of the economic, social, and environmental impact of the respective \nparts of the Project. \n48   This component also includes a provision for procurement of computers and related equipment. \n49   The advance action was published in the electronic version of ADB Business Opportunities of 10 September 2004 \nand in its printed version of mid-October 2004.  \n ",
        "13 \nstatements, including a management letter, in English not later than 9 months after the end of each \nof the first two financial years and not later than 6 months after the end of subsequent financial \nyears.  The  Government,  SPG,  and  the  PIAs  have  been  informed  about  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nsubmission of audited financial statements and possible penalties for delays in submission. The \nsubmitted  audited  project  accounts  and  agency  financial statements  should  be of  acceptable \nquality and should be prepared in accordance with internationally accepted accounting standards. \nFinancial  statements  with  adverse  opinions  or  disclaimers  from  auditors  are  considered \nunacceptable and cannot be submitted for this purpose. SPG and the PIAs through the PMO will \nalso submit to ADB reports and information concerning the use of the loan proceeds, project \nimplementation, and the performance of each PIA. The reports will include (i) quarterly progress \nreports on project implementation, and (ii) a project completion report not later than 3 months after \ncompletion of the project facilities. The PIAs will finance the annual audits to be carried out by \nauditing firms with experience and qualifications acceptable to ADB. \n  8.  Anticorruption \n41.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to provincial and local \ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added to \nthe ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. ADB\u2019s program \nfor the PRC includes assistance that will improve governance and provide incentives to reduce the \nincidence of corruption in the longer term. SPG will take the following anticorruption actions: (i) \ninvolve full-time officials from SPG to periodically review, together with staff of the PMO, the PIAs, \nand the concerned tendering companies; bidding process; delivery of equipment and materials; \nand installation, construction, and operation; (ii) introduce a dual-signing system, in which the \nwinning bidder for a civil works contract also signs an anticorruption contract with the employer; \nand (iii) periodically inspect of civil works contractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and \nsettlements. \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n42.  A Project Performance Management System (PPMS) was developed by SPG. The PPMS \nincludes a set of measurable indicators that were developed based on project design, impacts, and \nrisks. The macroeconomic and sector performance, institutional capacity, and reforms were taken \ninto account in designing the monitoring indicators. These indicators are presented in the project \nframework (Appendix 1) They cover environmental impacts such as reduction in GHG, PM, SO , \n2\nand NO  emissions, and improvement of air quality; institutional indicators such as operational, \nx\nfinancial, and corporate performance of the PIAs; expansion of the CMMDP\u2019s scope, replication of \nthe CMMDP at other mines; mobilization of private sector investments in similar projects; social \nand poverty impacts focusing on new job creation, number of poor households connected to the \nCMM distribution system; CMM consumption by poor households; and tariffs applied to CMM \nconsumption  by  such  households.  A  feedback  and  reporting  mechanism  for  effective  project \nimplementation  and  initial  startup  activities,  including  a  baseline  survey  based  on  a  random \nhousehold sample to be monitored with follow-up surveys, was included in the PPMS. Consultants \nto be recruited under part C of the CMMDP will help monitor and evaluate the indicators during \nproject implementation. They will also help develop a monitoring plan for the period after project \nimplementation. A copy of the PPMS is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n10.  Project Review \na.  Financial Performance \n  i.  Jincheng Anthracite Mining Group Company Limited  \n43.  JMC is wholly owned by SPG and the largest company involved in the CMMDP. Its main \nactivities are coal mining, engineering and construction, real estate development, printing and \npublishing,  production  of  chemicals,  and  power  generation.  JMC  has  assets  totaling  about \nCNY12.1 billion as of the end of 2003 and a local credit rating of AAA, based on past financial \n   ",
        "14   \nperformance and timely repayments of existing loans. JMC made significant investments of about \n$700 million during 2001-2003 that were largely financed through new equity injection (about 51%) \nand internal cash generation (about 19%). Over recent years, JMC has been moderately profitable, \nmainly as a result of an increase in the price of coal. With limited borrowing JMC\u2019s debt-to-equity \nratio decreased from about 80% in 2000 to about 55% in 2003. The debt service coverage ratio \nimproved from a low of 0.8 times in 2000, to about 1.7 times in 2003. In 2003 JMC recorded a \nprofit  of  about  CNY6.4  million  and,  with  increasing  demand  for  coal,  is  expected  to  remain \nprofitable.  \nii.  Shanxi Energy Industries Group Limited and Shanxi Energy CMM \nUtilization Company Limited  \n44.  SEIG, the parent company of SECC, the PIA for the CMM transmission component under \npart B, is a holding company with its headquarters in Taiyuan. SEIG is wholly owned by SPG and \nhas assets totaling about CNY741.6 million as of the end of 2003, including 24 subsidiaries, most \nof which transport coal and engage in other coal-related business. SEIG made a profit in 2001 but \nin 2000, 2002, and 2003, it incurred losses, based on net results from the operations of its \nsubsidiaries. The SARS50 epidemic, which banned coal transportation for 3 months in 2003, and \naccidents in older coal mines, were two key reasons for the poor financial performance. SECC is \nexpected to generate about CNY110.2 million in revenues by 2009, representing about 20% of \nSEIG\u2019s overall revenues. A financial covenant requiring SECC to maintain a satisfactory operating \nratio has been included in the relevant loan documents. This will enable monitoring of SECC\u2019s \nprogress and capacity development for adequate cash generation. Support in this area will also be \nprovided under part C. \n \n45.  At present, SEIG has adequate resources that could be used for further investments and is, \ntherefore, in a position to make the required equity contribution to SECC to ensure its sound \nfinancial operations. With regard to SECC, the present CMM production capacity at the 29 coal \nmines around Jincheng, which have been targeted to supply CMM, is about twice the projected \ndemand for CMM under part B. SECC\u2019s long term strategy is to be able to purify, concentrate, and \npressurize the excess CMM up to pipeline-quality standard to make it suitable for injection into the \nmajor west-to-east gas transmission pipeline.  \niii.  Jincheng CMM Comprehensive Utilization Company Limited \n46.  JCCUC has been established as a new company that is wholly owned by JMG. During \nproject implementation, JMG will be able to make the required equity contribution to JCCUC to \nensure its sound financial operations. JCCUC will receive the assets, including an existing pipeline \nworth  CNY60  million,  from  the  Jincheng  Municipal  Gas  Company  Limited,  which  will  cease \noperations upon completion of the CMM distribution system.  \n \n47.  A summary of the past and projected financial performance of JMC and the financial \nprojections of the JMC-CU, SECC, and JCCUC are in Appendix 8. The detailed tables are in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \nb.  Environmental Measures \n48.  The CMMDP is classified as environment category \u201cB\u201d. An initial environmental examination \nhas been prepared. Anticipated environmental impacts during construction are: dust generation, \nsoil  erosion,  disturbance  of  vegetation,  and  risk  of  gas  leaks  during  drilling.  Impacts  during \noperations  are:  emissions  from  the  proposed  power  plant,  and  potential  gas  leakage  from \ntransmission and distribution pipelines. The anticipated impacts will be successfully mitigated in \naccordance with existing PRC environmental standards. The CMMDP will not impact any sensitive \nor endangered species: two nature preserves in Jincheng are more than 5 kilometers from the \n                                                 \n50   Severe acute respiratory syndrome. \n ",
        "15 \nCMMDP facilities. The CMMDP will have net positive environmental benefits: improved indoor and \noutdoor air quality, reduced potential for acid precipitation, and reduction of GHG emissions. The \nEnvironmental Impact Assessment reports prepared by JMC and SEIG for the CMM-fired power \nplant  and  the  CMM  transmission  pipeline  system  have  been  approved  by  the  Shanxi \nEnvironmental  Protection  Administration  and  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration.  \nThe summary initial environmental examination is presented in Appendix 9. \nc.  Social Issues and Poverty Reduction \n49.  The construction of the CMMDP will affect 262 households51 or 999 persons, according to \nthe resettlement plans. In total, 29.49 hectares (ha) will be permanently acquired as a result of the \nCMMDP, of which 69.07% or 20.37 ha is farmland. The CMMDP will also require the temporary \nacquisition  of  308.69  ha  of  land  and  lease  of  9.36  ha.  About  6,135  m2  of  houses  will  be \ndemolished. The total cost for land acquisition and resettlement is estimated at $9.49 million \n(CNY78.77 million) in 2004 prices. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts have been identified \nand separate resettlement plans for parts A and B prepared, addressing major issues related to \nentitlements, compensation and rehabilitation of affected people. The PIAs have submitted the \nresettlement  plans  to  ADB  and  confirmed  that  the  resettlement  information  booklets  were \ndistributed to the affected people in September 2003. The resettlement plans were placed in the \noffices of the affected village committees in November 2003. The resettlement plans were posted \non  ADB's  resettlement  Website  in  September  2004.  The  summary  resettlement  plan  is  in  \nAppendix 10. \n50.  The Government, SPG, and PIAs will ensure that all affected people are compensated and \nresettled on time and adequately in accordance with the resettlement plan so that they will be at \nleast as well off as they would have been without the CMMDP. A mechanism has been established \nto consult with affected people throughout land acquisition and resettlement. The executing agency \nand PIAs will keep ADB informed of the progress of implementation of the resettlement plan \nthrough the quarterly progress reports. SPG will engage an independent agency to monitor and \nevaluate land acquisition and resettlement implementation. The monitor will submit a monitoring \nand evaluation report (for each component) to ADB upon completion of the compensation and \nresettlement activities, and 1 year thereafter to ensure that affected people have been adequately \nrehabilitated. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n51.  The CMMDP includes economic, financial, environmental, and social assessments. The \nintegrated benefits and impacts outweigh the associated costs. \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Viability  \n1.  Least-Cost Assessment and Economic Viability \n52.  Consultants recruited under the ADB-financed TA have reviewed the CMMDP\u2019s demand \nforecast and concluded that the risk associated with it is minimal (Supplementary Appendix E). \nThey have also produced a demand forecast for electricity consumption in the Shanxi power grid \nfor the short term (3 years) and the long term (up to 2020) on a sector basis. The demand- side \nmanagement measures, including implementation of time-of-day tariffs based on the long-run \nmarginal cost, were taken into account in the short- and long-term forecasts. A gas demand \nforecast was also prepared by the executing agency and found acceptable by the consultants. \n \n53.  Based on the energy demand forecast, the consultants carried out least-cost generation \nexpansion planning. The analysis shows that the planned phased commissioning of the CMM-fired \n                                                 \n51   Including two minority (Hui) households who will be affected by the land acquisition and resettlement due to the \nconstruction of CBM/CMM transmission and distribution pipeline system under Part B.  \n   ",
        "16   \npower plant under the CMMDP is supported by the least-cost generation expansion plan for the \nShanxi power grid. The analysis used constant 2003 prices and a discount rate of 12%. Tradable \ncommodities were valued at border prices at the prevailing exchange rate (CNY8.3/$1.0). Non-\ntradable commodities were valued at shadow prices, using a mix of standard and specific conversion \nfactors.52  Two  least-cost  generation  expansion  alternatives  for  the  Shanxi  power  grid  were \nconsidered. The results indicate that the least-cost generation expansion scenario including the \nCMMDP compares favorably with the one without it. The result of the least-cost analysis is supported \nby equalizing discount rate analysis.53 The equalizing discount rate shows that the CMM-fired power \nplant is superior up to a discount rate of 18.0%, compared with the alternative of locating the coal-\nfired thermal plant in the load center. \n \n54.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for each project component and \nfor the CMMDP as a whole. As in the least-cost analysis, the economic analysis applied the \nconversion  factors  to  costs  for  investment  in  land,54  equipment,  fuel,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance,55 where applicable. For the EIRR calculations, the project benefits mainly include:  \n(i) incremental electricity and gas outputs and more efficient gas supply, (ii) cost savings from \nmeeting existing demand, and (iii) local environmental benefits. \n \n55.  The EIRR calculation takes into account only the main benefits but includes all project-\nrelated costs. Including the local environmental benefits, this approach yields an EIRR of 21.1% for \npart A, 27.5% for part B, and 23.4% for the whole CMMDP (Appendix 11). Sensitivity analyses \nwere performed for the above EIRRs. For the EIRR of the whole CMMDP, sensitivity analysis \nshowed the EIRR would decrease to (i) 19.3% if the CMMDP were to experience a cost overrun of \n20%; (ii) 15.3% if the benefits were reduced by 20%; (iii) 20.8% if the CMMDP were to experience \na commissioning delay of one year; and (iv) 10.6% if all scenarios occurred. \n \n56.  An economic evaluation of the environmental impacts of the CMMDP was carried out based \non  the  benefits-transfer  method.  The  evaluation  used  (i)  the  methodology  adopted  in  ADB\u2019s \nWorkbook on Economic Evaluation of Environmental Impacts (1996) to determine the adjusted \nestimate of the monetary damages caused by air pollution during the study period, taking into \naccount the location of the pollution sources, the emission level, and population affected; and  \n(ii) estimates of average annual climate change for carbon emissions to evaluate the monetary \ndamage caused by GHG emissions (Supplementary Appendix F). If the global environmental \nbenefits were added to the project benefits, the EIRR for CMM and CBM production and the CMM-\nfired power plant would increase to 30.9%, for CMM transmission and distribution pipeline systems \nto 42.1%, and for the CMMDP as a whole to 34.6%. \n2.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n57.  Financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is calculated separately for (i) CMM and CBM \nproduction, and CMM-fired power plant components in part A; (ii) transmission component in part \nB, and (iii) distribution component in part B. As the CMM-fired power plant will obtain CMM from \nthe underground drainage at Sihe mine and from surface wells, a single FIRR is calculated from \nthe combined cash flows of these three subcomponents and is estimated at 6.2%. FIRRs for the \ntransmission and distribution components are 7.2% and 6.9%, respectively. The FIRR for the \noverall CMMDP is 6.5%. The FIRRs for the overall CMMDP and each component are above \n                                                 \n52    A standard conversion factor of 0.93 was used. Border prices were used for all imported items. Local costs were \nshadow priced using group and specific conversion factors: 1.0 for equipment, 1.67 for steel, 0.76 for cement, \n0.82 for timber, 2.0 for skilled labor, and 0.67 for unskilled labor. Taxes and duties were excluded. \n53    The costs of environmental mitigation and the resettlement program have been included in the project cost \nestimates. \n54   Land is valued at the economic opportunity cost (the estimated value of the best alternative utilization). \n55   Line losses were based on the statistics of historical line loss rates in each city. \n   \n ",
        "17 \nweighted average cost of capital estimated at 4.48% for the overall CMMDP, indicating that all \ncomponents are financially viable. The sensitivity analysis showed that the FIRR of the whole \nCMMDP would decrease to (i) 5.6% if the CMMDP were to experience a cost overrun of 10%, (ii) \n5.9% if the benefits of all components were reduced by 10%, (iii) 5.7% if CMMDP were to be \ndelayed by 1 year, and (iv) 3.6% if all scenarios occur. Details of financial analysis and price \nassumptions are in Appendix 12. \nB.  Environmental Benefits \n58.   The CMMDP will demonstrate the feasibility of using new technologies for commercial CBM \nand CMM production, capture, and use, and promote the development of similar projects in the \nPRC. The CMMDP will improve air quality by replacing coal, fuel wood, synthetic \u201cwaste\u201d gas, and \npetroleum-based fuels with CBM and CMM equivalent to about 265 million m3 of methane a year \nupon completion of the CMMDP by the end of 2008. No reasonable alternatives to the CMMDP \nwould achieve similar objectives and benefits. Natural gas reserves have not been discovered in \nthe project area, and there are no plans to deliver piped gas to the project area from external gas \nfields. The CMMDP will save about 429,310 tons of coal per year, approximately two thirds from \nclean  power  generation  and  one  third  from  fuel  switching  by  industrial  and  municipal supply \ncustomers.  Estimated annual emissions reductions are 7,866 tons of PM, 4,901 tons of SO , 2,077 \n2\ntons of NO , and 612,058 tons of CO  due to energy efficiency gains.  Reductions in PM, SO , and \nx 2 2\nNO  emissions will generate local benefits (improved air quality) and regional ones (reduced acid \nx\nprecipitation). Global benefits will result from methane capture and CO  reductions generated by \n2\nfuel switching. Methane capture alone will result in a minimum of 4.4 million tons of CO e emission \n2\nreductions a year upon completion of the CMMDP. \nC.  Social Benefits \n59.  The CMMDP will provide social benefits for the poor in terms of (i) providing the poor with \nclean energy at affordable cost, (ii) job creation, (iii) reducing air pollution and related health \nimpacts, (iv) improving their socio-economic environment, (v) improving occupational safety for \nminers, and (vi) improving their quality of life. Under part A, JMC will undertake specific poverty \nreduction initiatives such as expansion of the Sihe Mine Hospital with additional CNY1 million \ninvestment in Jiafeng county in 2004 to serve over 70,000 local community people, including about \n7,000 poor people;56 a provision to reduce medical costs by 15% per person-visit57 for those poor \nliving under minimum living guarantee; and construction of a local road with an investment of \nCNY1 million between 2005 and 2006 to serve 5,000 people, including 500 poor people in the \npoverty county where the CMM-fired power plant is located. Under part B, SECC will supply CMM \nto an industrial zone in Yangcheng county, where investments of about CNY200 million will be \nmade within 5 years, which would provide 3,500 jobs for local poor and women. Following policy \ndialogue between JMC and ADB, it has been agreed that JCCUC will connect poor households for \nfree to the CMM gas distribution pipeline system and will apply a special pro-poor CMM tariff \nscheme that reduces normal monthly user fees by about 50%.58 At the same time JCCUC will \ncollect the connection fees for all other households, estimated at CNY1,732 per household, over 6 \nmonths. \n                                                 \n56   The expansion of the hospital will not only improve the quality and services for local community residents but also be \nable to save transportation costs of CNY26 for each return trip for medical treatment in hospitals of Jiancheng City  \n70 km away, or of Qinshui County 50 km away. \n57   This reduction will result in savings of about CNY8 in medical costs per person-visit. \n58   Such a scheme would result in savings of CNY3.124 million in terms of connection fees and CNY0.37 million for the \nfirst year in terms of gas tariffs for 1,800 poor households registered under the minimum living guarantee (MLG) \nprogram of the Jincheng Civil Affairs Bureau. The respective municipal and county finance bureaus will finance the \ncost of the scheme. Subsequently, the connection exemption and gas tariff reduction for poor households will be \nrenewed on a yearly basis until all poor household in the Project area have been connected to the CMM distribution \nnetwork. \n   ",
        "18   \n60.  A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13. A benefit distribution \nand poverty impact ratio (PIR) analysis was also carried out to compute the PIR of the CMMDP \n(Supplementary G). The share of net project economic benefits directly accruing to the poor is \nestimated at 16.7%.  \nD.  Assessment of Project Risks \n  1.  CMM and CBM Production for Power Generation \n61.  The CMMDP area is among the highest potential CMM- and CBM-producing areas in terms \nof methane in place (in coal seams). The design of the CMM-fired power plant is based on a \ndetailed and conservative assessment of the CMM and CBM quantities that can reasonably be \nexpected to be produced during the development of the Sihe mine and has sufficient flexibility to \naccommodate any variations in the supply of CMM and CBM if they occur. In case of shortfalls of \nCMM and CBM supplies to the power plant, JMG\u2019s mines,59 which are a few kilometers from the \npower plant, have adequate CMM production capacity and could supply additional CMM to meet \nshortfalls. The technical and completion risks associated with the introduction of new technologies \nfor CBM production,60 CMM drainage, and CMM-based power generation have been addressed by \nincluding consulting services for project implementation, including those financed by USTDA, and \nthe requirement that the supplier of the internal combustion gas engines under the CMMDP will be \nresponsible for supervision of the first year  of their operation and maintenance following the \ncommissioning of the first 50% of total power generation capacity. The power plant will be operated \non  a  captive  basis  to  reduce  sensitivity  to  electric  tariffs  and,  in  principle,  will  only  produce \nelectricity for the Sihe mine. However, the electricity tariff of the power plant of CNY0.234/kWh is \nlower than the average tariff of the Shanxi power grid\u2019s average tariff of CNY0.29/kWh, and the \npower plant will be able to sell electricity to the grid in case the mine\u2019s demand for power is \nreduced. The establishment of JMC-CU as a separate company unit with an agreed purchase price \nfor the CMM and CBM and an agreed sales price to the Sihe mine for the power produced, thus \nensuring transparency and financial sustainability of its operations. \n  2.  CMM Transmission and Distribution \n62.  The construction and operation of the CMM transmission and distribution system is based \non a detailed technical design and known technologies. The various coal mines in the vicinity of \nJincheng produce CMM in excess of what is required to meet the projected CMM demand under \nthe CMMDP. SECC has finalized CMM purchase agreements with a sufficient number of coal \nmines to ensure adequate CMM supplies and has assigned the contracts to SECC, while SECC \nhas finalized a CMM sales contract with JCCUC. The establishment of SECC as a separate entity \nwill ensure financial sustainability of the operation of the pipelines. Obtaining right-of-way approval \nfor construction and operation of the transmission pipelines and the feeder pipelines from the \nvarious coal lines to the transmission pipelines is not expected to be difficult since the pipelines \nlargely run through sparsely populated areas and sufficient funds for compensation have been \nmade available in accordance with the resettlement plan. The tariffs for CMM consumption are in \nline with the present tariffs for the synthetic \u201cwaste\u201d gas, which is distributed in Jincheng, and the \nprojected demand for CMM is expected to exceed supplies. \n  3.  Overall Project \n63.  To fully assess the potential project risks, a probabilistic risk analysis was performed using \nthe Monte Carlo simulation technique based on 3,000 simulations for the EIRR and FIRR analyses. \nThe risk variables were selected because of their significant impact on the CMMDP\u2019s economic \nand financial viability. The risk analysis for the EIRR selected five risk factors: outputs, capital cost, \n                                                 \n59   Including mines that are operated by Qin River Coal Industry Stock Company Limited, which at present vent about \n200,000 m3 of CMM a day. \n60   The CBM well development program is to be periodically reviewed to ensure that the CBM wells will produce as \nmuch gas as feasible.  \n ",
        "19 \nimplementation delay, exchange rate, and local environmental benefits. The expected EIRR, based \non the weighted average of all simulated combinations, is 22.6%, about 0.8% lower than the base \ncase value without consideration of project risks. The results indicate that the expected FIRR is \n6.5%, about 0.4% lower than the base case value without consideration of project risks. \n  \n64.  Poverty is associated with vulnerability. The dimension of risk in poverty assessment is of \nsignificance since the poor are the most vulnerable to unexpected unfavorable outcomes. Seven \nrisk factors in the PIR analysis have been selected as the crucial risk variables because of their \nsignificant  impact  on  the  PIR,  including  financial  and  economic  costs;  financial  benefits  and \neconomic  benefits;  and  the  shares  of  consumer  surplus,  government  net  benefits,  and  labor \nsurplus to the poor. The assumed probability distributions were discussed and carefully reviewed \nby the project preparation TA consultants. The expected PIR is 15.9%, 0.8% lower than the base-\ncase value without consideration of risks, and still higher than the share of the poor in the project \narea (13.1%). Even with pessimistic assumptions, the probability of a negative outcome for the \npoor is insignificant (close to zero). The risk analysis on PIR calculation, together with the analysis \non the probability of overall project failure (risk analysis on the EIRRs and FIRRs), concludes that \nthe probability for negative outcomes for the poor is also minimal. Supplementary Appendix H \npresents the CMMDP\u2019S risk analysis. \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n65.

        "26  Appendix 2 \nCOAL SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Historical Coal Production and Consumption \n \n1.   Annual coal production in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) expanded from about \n1.05 billion tons in 1990 to about 1.40 billion tons in 1996, after which it decreased again to \nabout 1.23 billion tons in 2000. Since then, these production levels were maintained at slightly \nhigher levels in 2001 and 2002, only to increase sharply to about 1.6 billion tons in 2003.1 In \n1998 the demand for coal caused the Government to close about 75% of the small coal mines, \nincluding the township and village coal mines (TVCMs) and reduce their coal production to \nabout 250 million tons a year. At the same time, coal stockpiles increased to about 200 million \ntons and exports increased to about 90 million tons a year while it was expected that given its \nrelatively low coal prices the PRC could become a major coal exporter. However, since then \ncoal exports have stalled at 80 million\u201390 million tons a year due increasing domestic demand. \nCoal is expected to continue to account for about 64% of the PRC\u2019s primary commercial energy \nconsumption and it is projected that to meet demand coal supplies would need to increase to \nabout 3.2 billion tons a year by 2020 if the PRC\u2019s present growth rates and energy policies \ncontinue. Although the PRC has the third largest coal reserves in the world and such coal \ndemand could be met from proven domestic coal reserves, many large- and small-scale mines \nare  reaching  the  end  of  their  lifetime  cycle  and  considerable  investments  are  required  to \nincrease domestic coal production. Taking into account the time required to develop new mines \nand the additional investments required for developing the required additional transportation \ninfrastructure (mainly railways) to transport the coal to consumers a domestic coal supply deficit \ncould occur in the future, which would need to be met from coal imports, in particular in coastal \nprovinces. \n \nB.  Structure of the Coal Sector \n \n2.  Traditionally, the Ministry of Coal Industry was responsible for the PRC\u2019s main coal \nmines. However, this ministry was abolished in 1996 and the responsibility for coal mining, \nincluding  the  large  state-owned  coal  mines,  was  delegated  to  the  concerned  provincial \ngovernments while the Government only maintained a central supervisory role through the State \nAdministration for Coal Industry (SACI). Following further reorganization of the coal sector in \n1998 SACI was also abolished while the Government only remained involved in occupational \nsafety aspects of the coal sector through the State Administration of Work Safety. Coal mines in \nthe PRC comprise the following types: \n \n(i)  key  state-owned  coal  mines  (KSOCMs),  administered  by  the  concerned \nprovincial government; \n(ii)  local state-owned coal mines (SOCMs), administered by provincial, prefecture, \nand county governments; and \n(iii)  TVCMs (operated by private individuals or local governments in townships and \nvillages).  \n \n3.  There are about 100 KSOCMs, of which about 33 are listed as key state enterprises. \nThese mines mainly use mechanized mining technologies and their produced coal is mainly \nused in power plants, blast furnaces, steel plants, and large state-owned enterprises. There are \nabout  2,000  SOCMs,  which  are  much  smaller  than  the  KSCOMs  and  are  only  partially \nmechanized. It is estimated that there are around 23,000 TVCMs, which are characterized by \n                                                 \n1 About 90% of the produced coal is steaming coal and about 10% is coking coal. ",
        "Appendix 2  27 \nlow production levels and predominantly manual coal production. They mainly supply coal to \nlocal communities and townships. Before 1982, domestic coal supply was mainly provided by \nKSCOMs. It is estimated that in 2002 the KSCOMs employed about 830,000 persons, the \nSOCMs about 915,000 persons, and the TVCMs about 220,000 persons.  \n \n4.  From 1983 until 1997, the Government promoted the development of TVCMs to promote \nrural development and meet coal demand in certain areas. The percentage of coal production \nfrom TVCMs increased from about 18% in 1980 to about 45% of total production in 1996, \nwhereas during the same period the share of KSCOMs decreased from about 56% to about \n39%. Subsequently, there was a fall again in the relative share the TVCMs in coal production to \nabout 19% in 2000 when overall demand for coal decreased. It is estimated that in 2002 with \nincreased coal demand the share of the KSOCMs in coal production was about 51%, the share \nof the SOCMs about 19% and that of the TVCMs about 30%. Over the past decade the TVCMs \ntherefore acted as \u201cswing\u201d coal producers to meet the domestic coal demand. \n \n5.  The considerable decreases in annual coal consumption between 1996 and 2001 have \nbeen largely the result of the implementation of the Government\u2019s economic reform policies \naimed at restructuring of the state owned enterprises and improving their operating and energy \nefficiency and financial status. In particular the Government\u2019s policy to close small enterprises in \nthe coal, power generation, petrochemicals, iron and steel, and construction materials industries \ncontributed to more efficient use of coal and hence a decrease in coal consumption. Also the \nreplacement of certain state-owned enterprises by more efficient commercial enterprises played \na role. However, such efficiency gains in the use of coal have now ended and it is expected that \ncoal consumption will increase considerably in the coming years driven by the sharp increase in \ndemand for coal by power plants of which about 75% use coal as fuel.   \n \nC.  Coal Production Cost and Pricing \n \n6.  The cost of coal production varies considerably among various mines and types of coal. \nIn general, the lowest production costs occur in the TVCMs because of use of basic mining \nmethods; absence of proper safety, coal mine methane (CMM) drainage, and air ventilation \nfacilities; and the employment of low-wage miners. The large KSCOMs have considerable \neconomies of scale in comparison with the small TVCMs but also higher costs because of \nsafety, environmental, and social welfare concerns, which they need to address. Overall, it is \nestimated that in the PRC the coal production cost range between $6\u201315 (equivalent) per ton of \ncoal produced.     \n \n7.  The coal and power industries are intimately entwined: some 50% of coal production is \nused for electricity generation and more than 75% of power is generated from coal-fired plants. \nHowever, policies governing the two industries have not developed in step. Since the early \n1990s coal prices for other sectors than the power sector have undergone a relatively high \ndegree of liberalization and prices have risen substantially, with the exception of a dip in the late \n1990s. The quantities and price of coal that the key state mines and other large coal mines are \nto supply each year to the power sector are negotiated through annual national trade coal \nconferences  with  the  participation  of  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission \n(NDRC) and the Ministry of Railways with the aim to arrive at a government regulated coal \nprice. During recent years with considerable economic growth demand for coal has increased in \nall industrial sectors but producer and consumer prices for electricity remain tightly controlled. \nEven at times of power shortages, as occurred in 2003, power companies are not permitted to \nraise prices. This has resulted in a serious and very public conflict between the coal and power \nindustries to which coal producers have responded by trying to make the power companies pay ",
        "28  Appendix 2 \nhigher prices. The Government is considering to liberalize the coal price for the power sector in \nthe near future, also because considerable expansion of existing coal mines, where possible, \nand development of new ones will be required to meet the increasing demand for coal in the \ncoming years. \n8.  The PRC\u2019s membership in the World Trade Organization imposes obligations relating to \ntariff and nontariff barriers and to subsidies. However, the coal industry continues to receive \nsubstantial subsidies relating to extraction, transportation and social costs. Such assistance \nincludes exemption of repayment of loans from state owned banks, debt-to-equity swaps to \nreduce interest costs and debts, and provision of treasury bonds and low interest loans to state \nowned coal enterprises. It is difficult to accurately estimate the past and present value of direct \nand indirect financial support provided by the Government to the coal sector. However, it is \nestimated that such support has been declining over the paste decade. This could become a \nsource of contention in the near future. \nD.   Coal Transport \n9.  Although coal mining is profitable at present, transporting it by rail to large consumers \nsuch as power plants remains unprofitable. At present the Government allocates rail transport \ncapacity for all freight, including coal, as well as freight rates. After incurring losses in the \nprevious 3 years, it is estimated that the rail industry achieved marginal return on equity rates of \n0.27% to 1.13% from 1998 to 2002. However, about 50% of the freight capacity of the railways \nis already used for transporting coal and in 2004 hauling coal has become even less profitable \nfor railway companies than other categories of freight, which has caused bottlenecks in the \nsupply of coal and has worsened coal shortages. Under these circumstances securing adequate \nrailway capacity for transporting coal in the future has become a major challenge. \n \nE.   Recent Developments  \n \n10.  After incurring losses during the previous 5 years, coal sector operations broke even in \n2002 and are estimated to have achieved a modest return on equity of 2\u20133% in 2003. Increased \ndemand for coal was largely responsible for higher prices and industry profitability, which could \nhave been even higher had the Government not capped the coal prices. With regard to the \noperation of the coal mines it is expected that the central Government will reinstate some \ndegree of central control and supervision so as to be able to close down unauthorized, wasteful, \ndangerous, small coal mines and be able to regulate production and coal prices. As a first step \nthe Government has identified 19 new national coal zones in the provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, \nand Inner Mongolia. All coal mines in these areas are required to obtain central Government \napproval for their operations. Until recently, local governments had sole jurisdiction about the \noperation of small coal mines, which also constitute a significant source of tax revenue for local \ngovernments.  It is estimated that in 2003 there were still some 15,000 small coal mines in the \nPRC that produced less than 30,000 tons a year. Increased Central Government control is also \nexpected to facilitate merger of viable small coal mines with larger SOCMs and KSOCMs. \n ",
        "Appendix 3  29 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE  \n \n \n1.  External sources, including direct foreign investment, are increasingly being promoted \nand now finance about 20% of total annual investments in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) energy sector, mainly in the power sector. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \napproved about $3.2 billion to the PRC energy sector to finance 25 projects in the public sector, \nand 2 private sector power projects. With regard to power projects, thermal power projects \naccount for 41% in terms of loan amount, with hydropower projects accounting for about 36%, \nfollowed by transmission and distribution (about 17%), and renewable energy (about 6%). ADB \nhas also provided 67 technical assistance (TA) projects for the energy sector for about $32 \nmillion to help prepare projects, provide policy advice, and build institutional capabilities of \npower utilities that are the executing agencies of ADB loans.  \n \n2.  ADB  has  extended  10  loans  amounting  to  $1.48  billion  for  urban  environmental \nimprovement projects in the PRC, including district heating distribution, natural gas distribution, \nand  combined  heat  and  power  plants.  Five  projects  have  been  completed  and  are  in \ncommercial operation, which has resulted in improvement in the overall ambient air quality in \nthe project cities. ADB has taken a leading role in providing support for (i) corporatizing and \ncommercializing  power  utilities  and  state-owned  enterprises,  (ii) developing  the  policy  and \nregulatory frameworks for encouraging foreign investment in the power sector, (iii) introducing \ncompetitive bidding procedures for power, energy efficiency, and clean production projects, \n(iv) strengthening financial management of project enterprises, (v) rationalizing the power tariff \nstructure, and (vi) promoting market reforms to support energy efficiency and clean production.  \n \n3.  The World Bank is the largest official source of external funding for the power sector. As \nof April 2003, it had provided $5.8 billion to finance 25 power projects, most of which are large-\nscale thermal power or hydropower projects. A comparable amount has been invested in energy \nconservation and environmental improvement projects. The World Bank's 2003 program does \nnot include any power projects. Its future program primarily targets renewable energy projects \nunder the World Bank-Global Environment Facility (GEF) Strategic Partnership for Renewables. \nRecent  World  Bank  TA  for  the  power  sector  has  been  supporting  the  Government's \nderegulation efforts. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United \nNations  Environment  Programme  are  providing  assistance  for  power  sector  restructuring, \nenergy efficiency, and industrial clean production. \n \n4.  Among the bilateral sources, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) is the \nlargest source of external assistance. It has provided concessional loans totaling \u00a5438 billion \n($3.6 billion  at  the  current  exchange  rate)  for  14  power  sector  projects  through  its  official \ndevelopment assistance window, excluding those assisted through export credits and untied \nyen loans provided by the former Export-Import Bank of Japan. JBIC has also provided special \ncredits to major cities to improve their environment through the installation of emission control \ndevices and equipment in power plants and factories, and through building water treatment \nfacilities. JBIC is considering shifting its traditional focus of assistance to the power sector from \nhydro and thermal power generation to energy conservation and renewable energy, particularly \nin the western region. Germany, through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW),  has provided \napproximately $400 million in mixed credits, mostly for power plants and turbine modernization \nprojects. KfW has been also assisting the Government in energy efficiency, providing credit \nlines, and renewable energy development. Other bilateral sources, providing export credits or \nmixed credits and TA, include Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Spain, United \nKingdom, and United States. \n ",
        "30  Appendix 3 \n \n5.  To promote the production and utilization of coalbed methane (CBM) and coal mine \nmethane (CMM) in the PRC, various funding agencies have provided and are providing support. \nIn 1992, UNDP provided a GEF-financed TA project of $10 million to demonstrate in various \nparts of the PRC new technologies to improve CBM and CMM production and to establish a \nnational database on CBM and CMM resources at PRC coal mines. Over the years, the United \nStates Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has been actively promoting the production \nand utilization of CBM and CMM in the PRC through its support for the establishment and \nactivities  of  the  China  Coalbed  Methane  Clearinghouse  (CCMC)  under  the  China  Coal \nInformation Institute. USEPA\u2019s main activities include (i) research and data collection on the \nPRC\u2019s CMM production and emissions, (ii) dissemination of CBM- and CMM-related information \nand  data,  (iii)  identification  of  potential  projects  for  the  use  of  CMM,  and  (iv)  organizing \ninternational conferences and workshops to promote international cooperation for CMM and \nCBM development in the PRC. In 1996, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) began \na project at the Tiefa coal mine in Liaoning Province to demonstrate more efficient CMM \ndrainage  technologies.  In  1997,  the  project  was  taken  over  by  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency (JICA) as a Japan \u201cGreen Aid Project,\u201d and it was completed in 2002. \nUSEPA  continues  to  support  CCMC\u2019s  activities.  In  June  2002,  the  United  States  Labor \nDepartment provided a grant of $2.3 million for TA to improve safety and health conditions in \nPRC coal mines. The technical assistance will be implemented in cooperation with the State \nAdministration for Work Safety of the PRC and will focus on (i) development of mine rescue \ntechniques  and  institutionalizing  training  in  such  techniques,  (ii)  capacity  building  for \ngovernment personnel to promote workplace safety and health in PRC coal mines, (iii) training \nof  miners  and  operators  in  safe  operational  methods  and  practices,  (iv)  improving  the \nenforcement of relevant laws and regulations, and (v) developing pilot projects to demonstrate \nsafer  techniques  and  safety  supervision.  The  United  Kingdom,  under  its  Cleaner  Coal \nTechnology Transfer Programme with the PRC, is supporting projects to promote enhanced \ncontrol and use of CMM, extraction and use of abandoned mine methane, and the development \nof  underground  coal  gasification.  All  agree  on  the  urgency  of  increasing  CMM  utilization \nschemes to mitigate the large greenhouse gas emissions associated with coal mining, improve \nthe environment, and increase miners\u2019 safety.  \n  \n ",
        "Appendix 4   31 \nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PROJECT AND  \nTHE CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM \n \n \n1.  The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a market-based financing instrument under \nthe Kyoto Protocol. It provides project developers access to additional financial resources for \ndeveloping and implementing projects that provide greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction benefits \nover business-as-usual trends. The enforcement of the Kyoto Protocol is expected shortly with \nratification by Russia. The amount of $1.5 billion\u20132.5 billion has been committed in the GHG \nmarket, which is expected to grow as the Protocol\u2019s first commitment period (2008\u20132012) \napproaches, to $5 billion\u201310 billion annually. \n \n2.  Emission reductions created by the Coal Mine Methane Development Project (CMMDP) \nmay qualify for trading under the CDM. Under the CDM, emission reductions in a developing \ncountry can be traded or sold to developed countries subject to GHG reduction targets under \nthe Kyoto Protocol. The CDM process has five steps: (i) identification and design, including \npreparation of a project design document; (ii) validation and registration with the CDM executive \nboard; (iii) monitoring; (iv) verification and certification; and (v) issuance of certified emission \nreductions (CERs).  \n \n3.  In theory, a CDM project recognizes revenue only after operations begin, when emission \nreductions are generated and CERs can be issued. In practice, because registration procedures \nhave only recently become available, verifiable emission reductions (VERs) are being traded in \nthe emerging global carbon market. The global carbon market consists of buyers concentrated \nin Europe, Japan, and North America, including the Prototype Carbon Fund.1 The fund has an \nagreement with the Ministry of Finance of the PRC to purchase 3 million tons of carbon dioxide \nequivalent (CO e) in emission reductions from CMMDP, at $4.25 per ton of CO e, for a total \n2 2\ncontract value of about $12.75 million.  \n \n4.  The PRC policy and institutional context for CDM projects are rapidly evolving. Several \nprojects in PRC are being prepared as CDM projects, including (i) the Gansu Clean Energy \nProject, supported by ADB,2 (ii) the proposed Liaoning environmental improvement project, and \n(iii) the CMMDP. A new baseline methodology and project design document for the CMMDP are \nexpected to be submitted shortly to the CDM executive board by the Prototype Carbon Fund.  \n \n5.  The CMMDP seems to have clear and appropriate CDM additionality,3 as it will (i) help \nremove policy barriers to development of coal mine methane (CMM) and coalbed methane \n(CBM) in the PRC; (ii) remove technological barriers to efficient extraction and production of \nCMM and CBM; and (iii) remove financial barriers for financing medium- to large-scale CMM- \nand CBM-fired power generation. Based on current and projected CMM and CBM production \nand  utilization  rates, an  estimated  minimum  of  23  million  tons  of CO e  reductions  will  be \n2\nachieved during the first 10 years of operation of the CMM-fired power plant alone.  \n \n                                                 \n1 The ADB CDM facility, created in 2003, functions as a market facilitator rather than a buyer. \n2 ADB. 2003.

        "  Appendix 8  35\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS \n \n1.  The following analysis provides a quantitative and qualitative examination of the financial \nhealth of the three revenue earning companies involved in the Project \u2013 Jincheng Anthracite Mining \nGroup  Co.  Ltd.  (JMC);  Shanxi  Energy  Industries  Group  Co.  Ltd.  (SEIG)  and  its  independent \nsubsidiary, Shanxi Energy CBM Co. Ltd. (SECC); and the newly established entity Jincheng Coal \nMine Methane (CMM) Comprehensive Utilization Company (JCCUC). The historical and projected \nfinancial statements of the project enterprises are shown in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n2.  JMC and JMC- Company Unit. JMC was transformed from a state-owned enterprise under \nthe Ministry of Coal to a corporate entity in 2002. JMC is a holding company, which is wholly owned \nby the Shanxi provincial government (SPG) with total assets of CNY12.1 billion as of end of 2003. \nJMC is involved in coal production; engineering and construction; real estate development; printing \nand publishing; production of chemicals; and power generation. The company was awarded a local \ncredit rating of AAA by the Shanxi Provincial Bureau, based on its past performance and timely \nrepayments of existing loans. It had cash and short term investments of CNY1.3 billion at the end of \n2003. For 2003, JMC\u2019s net after tax profit was about CNY6.4 million. \n \n3.  JMC employs about 30,000 people and is one of the top 15 companies in Shanxi Province. JMC \nmade significant investments\u2014about $700 million equivalent\u2013during 2001-2003, large part of which \nwere financed by new equity injection (about 51%) and internal cash generation (about 19%). With \nlimited borrowing, JMC\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio improved over the same period (from 80% to 55%). The \ndebt-service-coverage ratio improved from the low level of .0.8 in 2000, to about 1.7 in 2003 (see  \nTable A8.1). \nTable A8.1: Financial Performance and Projections \nJincheng Anthracite Mining Group Company Limited \n  Actual  Projected \nYear ending December 31  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2006  2008  2010 \nFinancial Accounts                 \n   Operating Revenues  1,331.3  1,592.0  2,494.6  4,212.5  4,891.3  7,159.3  9,736.4  11,717.9 \n   Net Income  14.7  65.3  (50.3)  6.4  54.8  98.6  137.4  164.0 \n   Total Assets  7,014.6  9,041.9  11,139.9  12,091.3  13,509.7  20,757.3  25,154.8  33,470.2 \n   Capital Expenditures  (248.0)  1,791.6  2,279.6  1,726.9  2,083.2  4,428.8  2,214.1  3,744.4 \nFinancial Ratios                 \n   Operating Ratio a (%)  92.3  92.4  76.2  86.6  82.9  84.0  84.5  85.1 \n   Return on Net Fixed Assetsb (%)  1.7  3.5  0.7  2.7  2.4  3.3  3.5  2.6 \n   Accounts Receivables c (months)  7.0  3.6  1.8  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0 \n   Debt/(Debt & Equity) Ratiod (%)  79.9  62.9  60.2  54.8  58.8  56.3  60.2  62.9 \n   Debt Service Ratio e (times)  0.8  1.3  2.7  1.7  2.0  1.7  1.5  1.5 \nSource:  Company financial statements; company and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n4.  In 1998, the Government\u2019s policy to close down small-scale coal mines increased local coal \nprices to international levels. Coal prices that averaged around CNY130-140 per ton in 1998 increased \nby about 200% to the current level of CNY420 per ton, which is in line with the international price of coal \nof about $50.8 per ton. This helped improve JMC\u2019s financial performance.  \n5.  JMC has established a new company unit (JMC-CU) to operate the CMM-fired power plant \nunder the CMM Development Project (CMMDP). The CMM-fired power plant will source the supply of \nCMM  from  the  Sihe  mine,  owned  by  JMC,  and  the  CBM  from  surface  wells,  which  are  to  be \ndeveloped in JMC\u2019s concession area under the CMMDP. The first 50% of the generation capacity will \nbecome available by January 2006, followed by the remaining 50% by January 2008. The operating \nrevenue of the CMM-fired power plant is projected to increase from CNY88.0 million in 2006 (at 50% \nof capacity) to CNY184.9 million in 2008 (at full capacity).1 Once the CMM-fired power plant is \noperating at full capacity, its return-on-net-fixed-assets is expected to be in a satisfactory range of  \n6\u20139% during 2010\u20132015. The CMM-fired power plant\u2019s ability to generate increasing internal cash \n                                                 \n1  Based on an agreed sales price of the power generated at CNY0.234/kWh.

        "36  Appendix 8 \n \nfrom its operations will contribute to a decrease in its debt-to-equity ratio over time from 72% in 2005 \nto 43% in 2015 while its debt-service-coverage ratio is projected to be in the range of 1.4 to 1.8 times \nduring 2009-2015. \n \n6.  SEIG and SECC. SEIG was established in 1993 as a state-owned enterprise under the Shanxi \nProvincial Government and was corporatized under the Corporation Law in May 2001. SEIG, a \nholding company that is wholly owned by SPG, has its headquarters in Taiyuan. Its assets total \nCNY741.6  million  as  of  end  of  2003,  including  24  subsidiaries  (10  coal-related  wholly  owned \nsubsidiaries,  8  subsidiaries  with  majority  shareholding,  and  6  subsidiaries  with  less  than  50% \nshareholding), most of which are engaged in the transport of coal and other coal-related business. \nWhile coal transportation is its core business, SEIG has other interests  such as power generation and \ntransportation of compressed methane gas by trucks. Recently, the Government, as part of the \nongoing power sector restructuring, reduced SEIG\u2019s share in the Yangcheng Power Plant (2,100 MW) \nto 4%.   \n7.  SEIG incurred losses, based on net results from the operations of a range of subsidiaries in \n2000, 2002, and 2003. It made a profit in 2001. In 2003, SEIG incurred a loss of CNY 10.1 million on \ntotal revenues of CNY235.8 million. The SARS epidemic, which banned coal transportation for 3 \nmonths in 2003, and accidents in older coal mines were two key reasons for the poor financial \nperformance.  SEIG\u2019s projected debt level is about 26%\u201343% during 2004\u20132010 and its overall \nbusiness growth forecast seems reasonable. However, SEIG has poor financial cost control with an \noperating ratio of about 105%, implying that its operations are not generating sufficient cash to meet \nits expenses and to replace its operational assets.  \n \n8.  In 2001, SEIG received the exclusive franchise from SPG for transporting CMM and CBM in \nShanxi Province, and established the SECC for this purpose. SECC will receive CNY71.7 million in \nequity contribution from SEIG. SEIG has the following sources of equity: CNY7.9 million available cash; \nCNY65.9  million  received  as  restitution  from  the  Shanxi  Finance  Bureau  in  September  2004 \n(accumulated as follows: CNY19.2 million in 2001, CNY26.9 million in 2002, and CNY19.8 million in \n2003); additional expected dividend of about CNY7 million from Yangcheng power plant in 2003; and \nCNY12 million from subsidiary companies. This is more than is required for SEIG\u2019s equity contribution. \nThe proposed CMM transmission pipeline will also reduce the number of accidents in coal mines by \npromoting the more efficient drainage of CMM by coal mine operators who are to supply CMM to SECC.  \n9.  SECC is expected to generate about CNY110.2 million in revenues by 2009, representing about \n20% of the SEIG\u2019s overall revenue. Its projected debt level will improve to 70% in 2009 from 82% in \n2005.  Its  overall  business  growth  forecast  seems  reasonable.  A  financial  covenant  requiring  a \nsatisfactory operation ratio has been included in the relevant Project Agreement to monitor its progress \nwhile capacity building support in this area will also be provided under the Project. \n10.   JCCUC. The Jingcheng municipal government has established JCCUC as a wholly owned \nsubsidiary. JCCUC will receive the assets, including existing pipelines worth CNY60 million, from the \nJincheng Municipal Gas Company Limited, which will be closed down upon completion of the CMM \ndistribution pipeline system under the CMMDP. The Jincheng municipal government has provided a \nwritten guarantee for the equity amount of CNY81.2 million. JCCUC's projected revenue is expected to \ngrow from CNY132.5 million in 2006 (operating at 86% capacity) to CNY169.2 million in 2009 (operating \nat full capacity). Based on preliminary estimates, the net income is projected to be around CNY10.0 \nmillion in 2009 (representing a return-on-net-fixed assets of about 5.6%). There are no plans for any \nmajor additional investments during this period and JCCUC\u2019s operating performance is expected to be \nstable with an operating ratio of around 87%. Its debt-to-equity ratio is estimated at about 74% at the \nbeginning of project implementation and is expected to decrease to around 60% by 2009. \n \n11.

The proposed CMMDP includes (i) improved and expanded coal mine methane (CMM) \nand coalbed methane (CBM)1 production at the Jincheng Anthracite Mining Group Company \nLimited (JMC) mining areas, totaling approximately 182 million cubic meters a year (m3/year), \nwhich will be used to fire a 120-megawatt (MW) power plant; 22 kilometers (km) of 110 kilovolt \npower transmission line and four transformer substations will be constructed to deliver power to \nthe grid; (ii) construction and operation of gas transmission and distribution networks to deliver \napproximately  166  million  m3/year  of  CMM,  with  an  average  methane  content  of  50%  to \nJincheng City, including Yangcheng county; and (iii) institutional strengthening of the project \nimplementing agencies (PIAs). CMM will be produced from existing mines, and CBM will be \nproduced from new surface wells; new mining is not required.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n3.  Shanxi is on the middle reaches of the Yellow River in north-central PRC. It is about \n156,300 square kilometers (km2) in area, with a population of 32.97 million in 2000. It has a dry \nand windy spring, a wet summer, and a cold winter. The wet season is from July to September, \nwhen flooding is prevalent in the low-lying areas, particularly in the Yellow River Basin.   \n \n4.  The CMMDP is in Jincheng county in the mountainous region of southeast Shanxi, close \nto the border with Henan Province. The topography is dominated by limestone mountains and \nplateaus covered by loess. Jincheng is in the southeast of the Shanxi plateau, which is higher in \nthe east and lower in the central area. The urban center is in the catchment area of the Qin and \nDan rivers, characterized by medium-relief rolling hills and basins. Mountains and rolling hills \nover 800 meters above sea level occupy 87.1% of the total land. The Gaoping Basin, Jincheng \nBasin, and Qin River valley are Jincheng\u2019s economic and political centers. Seismic activity is \nrare and of low intensity (under grade IV). All facilities will be designed to withstand grade-VI \nincidents. \n \n5.  The Qin River is 458 km long, and flows into the Yellow River, with a highly variable \nseasonal  flow  of  2.5\u20133,050  cubic  meters  per  second  (m3/sec).  There  are  three  seasonal \ntributaries within 5 km of the site: the Mazhuang, Pan, and Changzhuang rivers.2 The water \nquality  generally  falls  within  class-IV  standards.  During  the  rainy  season,  erosion  of  the \nsurrounding land can lead to very high concentrations of suspended solids in the rivers, which \ncan lead to restrictions in the flow and consequent flooding. \n \n6.  More  than  120  minerals  have  been  discovered,  including  coal,  bauxite,  pearlite, \nrefractory clay, gallium, and zeolite. Shanxi is the largest coal-producing province in the PRC. \nThe project area is a traditional base for heavy industries, including iron and steel, glass and \nceramics, and power generation. The main air pollution sources in Jincheng are industry, coal, \n                                                 \n1  CMM is produced by in-mine drilling and drainage and CBM is produced from surface wells drilled into virgin coal \nseams. \n2  The Pan and Changzhuang rivers are seasonal. ",

On an annual daily average basis, air quality within Jincheng City exceeds \n2\nclass-III standards of the State Ambient Air Quality Standards (GB3095\u20131996), which is poor \ncompared with the other 11 cities in Shanxi.  \n \n7.  Forestry and vegetation in the area are declining and continuing erosion is damaging \ngrassland. Endangered species have been reported in the area (including white-skin pine tree, \nleopard, and eagle) but are declining. According to the Environmental Pollution Status and \nControl Measures of Jincheng prepared by the Jincheng Environmental Protection Bureau in \nApril  2003,  the  development  of  the  mines  and  the  associated  construction  activities  have \nsignificantly  damaged  the  ecological  environment.  There  are  two  natural  protection  areas: \nManghe in Yangcheng county, and Lishan in Qinshui county, both over 5 km from the proposed \npipeline route and other project facilities). \n \n8.  Several cultural sites are located within Jincheng, for example, Yuhuang Temple from \nthe Yuan Dynasty and Qinglian Temple from the Song Dynasty. There are four protected \nstructures  within  Jincheng  City:  (i)  Jingde  Bridge,  provincial  level;  (ii)  Jingzhong  Bridge, \nprovincial level; (iii) Jincheng Committee Center, city level; and (iv) Zhang Family House, city \nlevel. \n \nD.  Anticipated Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n9.  The CMMDP is designed to reduce air pollution emissions, regional and indoor, by \nexpanding clean energy supplies and improving energy efficiency. Emission reductions are \nsummarized in Table A9.1. Except for short-term disruptions during construction, no irreversible \nnegative impacts directly due to project design, location, and operations have been identified.  \n \n10.  Air pollution loads will decrease with the CMMDP via reduction in coal use, reduction in \npetroleum  fuels  use,  and  capture  of  vented  methane  gas.  Indoor  air  quality  will  improve, \nregional SO  loads and acid precipitation potential will decrease, and global environmental \n2\nbenefits will accrue from methane capture. Water and soil pollution will be indirectly reduced \ndue to a lower rate of pollutant transfer from air to water and soil, with reduced stress on local \necosystems. Coal-derived waste will be reduced. \n \nTable A9.1: Estimated Emissions Reduction  \n \n    Calculated Emission Reduction \n    (tons/year, except for CH ) \n4 \n            CH   CO  \n4 2\nProjectComponent  Coal Saved          (million  equivalent \n(tons/year)  PM  SO   NO   CO   m3/year)  (million \n2 x 2\ntons/year) \nPart A:   291,270  4,910  3,909  1,276  410,901  182.4  3.0 \nCMM and CBM  for   \nPower Generation \nPart B:   138,040  2,956  992     801  201,157   83.0  1.4 \nCMM Distribution \nTotal  429,310  7,866  4,901  2,077  612,058  265.4  4.4 \nCBM = coalbed methane, CH  = methane,CMM = coal mine methane, CO  = carbon dioxide, m3 = cubic meter, NO \n4   2 x\n= nitrogen oxides, PM = particulate matter, SO  = sulfur dioxide \n2\nNotes:  CO  equivalent reductions include avoided, reduced, and captured CH emissions, and reduced CO  \n2 4  2\nemissions through energy efficiency improvements.  \nSource: Feasibility  studies,  environmental  assessment  reports  for  individual  project  components,  and  reports \nprepared by project preparatory  technical assistance consultants. \n \n \n ",
        "40  Appendix 9 \n11.  Construction traffic, excavation and earthmoving, and aggregate processing facilities will \ngenerate  dust,  which  will  be  suppressed  with  routine  measures  (e.g.,  water  sprays  on \nconstruction sites and roads, tarps to cover trucks hauling raw materials). Construction vehicles \nand stationary equipment will meet existing PRC emissions and noise standards. Construction \nactivity in urban areas and near sensitive receptors (schools, hospitals, etc.) will be limited to \ndaylight  hours;  additional  noise  abatement  measures  such  as  temporary  barriers  will  be \nconstructed as necessary to meet national and local standards. Traffic and communications \nmay be occasionally disrupted during construction of the pipelines and the CMM gathering and \ntransmission stations.  \n \n1.  Project Alternatives \n \n12.  Without the CMMDP, the area will continue to rely on coal as the primary energy source \nfor commercial, industrial, and residential use. Other energy options have not been developed \non a commercial scale in the project area. Demand-side management measures will continue to \nbe driven by market forces, but will be insufficient in the near term to offset increasing energy \ndemands.  CMM  and  CBM  are  readily  available  alternatives,  the  supply  of  which  can  be \nexpanded through improved production methods.  \n \n2.  Coal Mine and Methane Gas Safety \n \n13.   The safety record of the PRC coal industry is poor and considerable efforts are being \nmade to improve its performance, including closure of small mines over the last few years. In \n2002, 6121 deaths were reported, a rise of 8% over 2001. This is equivalent to 4.7 deaths per \nmillion tons of coal mined. Specific statistics for Shanxi are not available. The reported figures \nare believed to underestimate the extent of worker injuries and fatalities, as accidents in small \nand  illegal  mines  often  go  unreported.  Occupational  diseases  such  as  coal  worker's \npneumoconiosis and silicosis are likely to be endemic amongst miners, but statistics for the \nproject area are not available. \n \n14.  The risks associated with CMM and CBM extraction are low compared to actual coal \nmining. The explosion hazards associated with coal mining will be reduced. Enhanced CMM \nand CBM production will reduce mine explosion hazard by reducing the amount of methane gas \nin the mine working space. Using the predicted coal savings via replacement with CMM and \nCBM, the CMMDP is estimated to save about five lives per year. The draining of CBM from \nmines will make coal production safer. Injuries and occupational disease should be reduced with \nthe CMMDP, but statistics are not available to perform a valid evaluation. \n \n15.  Gas leakage from pipeline transmission and distribution systems will be minimized by \ndesign,  following  best  engineering,  construction,  and  operating  practices.  Methane  and \nhydrogen sulfide (H S) are monitored by automated systems that trigger alarms when methane \n2\nconcentration in air is within explosive limits and when H S is above designated workplace \n2\nsafety limits.  \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n16.  Construction contractors will be required to provide basic sanitation facilities, domestic \nsewage treatment, solid waste management, noise and dust control, and personal protective \nequipment  for  workers,  and  to  conduct  noise  and  dust  monitoring  at  construction  sites. \nConstruction  equipment  must  meet  relevant  PRC  emissions  and  noise  standards.  Local \nenvironmental  protection  bureaus  (EPBs)  will  be  responsible  for  routine  monitoring  of \nconstruction activities, as well as conducting routine air and water monitoring at designated \nmonitoring stations. The Jincheng EPB will be responsible for oversight of local EPBs and will \nreview  data  from  construction  contractors  and  local  EPBs  to  determine  if  environmental \nrequirements are being met. The CMMDP project management office (PMO) will designate at ",
        "Appendix 9  41 \nleast one suitably qualified professional staff member to serve as an environmental officer for \nthe CMMDP. The PMO will be responsible for compiling progress reports for submission to ADB \ntwo times a year.  \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n17.  Environmental  evaluations  and  assessments  have  been  prepared  for  each  project \ncomponent, and have included at least one public consultation for each subproject, primarily via \nsurveys in affected areas. Survey results indicated strong local support for the CMMDP, based \non improved energy services, improved air quality and local ecological conditions, and expected \neconomic benefits.  \n \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n18.  The CMMDP will demonstrate the potential for CMM and CBM as a reliable and safe \nclean energy supply, improve regional and indoor air quality, and reduce the explosion hazard \nassociated with methane gas production, transmission, and distribution. Global environmental \nbenefits will be realized via reduction of CO . The anticipated impacts arise primarily from \n2\nconstruction activities, and can be readily mitigated with good engineering practice and active \nenvironmental management. The Jincheng EPB will assume a lead role in assuring that the \nenvironmental management program is fully implemented. Local EPBs, PIAs, and construction \ncontractors will be responsible for routine monitoring and oversight. Project impacts, mitigation \nmeasures, and monitoring requirements are summarized in Table A9.2.  \n \nH.  Conclusions \n \n19.  The environmental examinations and assessments conducted adequately evaluate the \npotential  impacts  of  the  CMMDP.  Further  project  processing  by  ADB  is  contingent  on \ncompletion of all environmental assessments as required by the PRC Government. A summary \ninitial environmental examination has been prepared pursuant to completion of all required \nenvironmental assessments. The environmental impact assessment reports prepared by the \nPIAs for the various components have been approved by the Shanxi Environmental Protection \nAdministration and the State Environmental Protection Administration. Based on the project \ndesign, impacts, mitigation measures, and institutional capacity, environmental category B is \nappropriate.  \n ",

        "44  Appendix 10 \n \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \n1.  The Coal Mine Methane Development Project (CMMDP) in Shanxi Province comprises \nthree subprojects, all of which will require land acquisition and population resettlement. The land \nacquisition and resettlement (LAR) program is designed to ensure that the affected people will be \nbetter off or at least not worse off as a result of the CMMDP. \n \n2.  The impacts of the CMMDP are summarized in Table A10.1. In total, 29.49 hectares (ha) \nof land will be permanently acquired by the CMMDP, of which 69% or 20.37 ha is farmland. The \nCMMDP will require 308.69 ha of temporary land occupation and 9.36 ha of land lease. When \nconstruction is completed, the temporarily acquired land will be rehabilitated and returned to the \naffected people for their continued use. In addition, 6,135 m2 of brick houses and yards will be \ndemolished. Some auxiliaries, such as yards, toilets, trees, and tombs, will also be affected. A \ntotal of 262 households or 999 people will be affected, including 104 households or 386 persons \naffected by permanent land acquisition, 116 households or 455 persons by temporary land \nacquisition, 7 households or 18 persons by land lease, and 35 households or 140 persons by \nrelocation. \n \nTable A10.1: Summary of LAR Impacts of the Coal Mine Methane Development Project \n  Affected Households  Permanent Land  Temporary  Land  House \nand Population   Acquisition  Land  Lease  Demolishment \n(no.)

For the construction of the Sihe 120 megawatt (MW) CMM-fired power plant 5.32 ha of \nland will be permanently acquired and will affect 23 households comprising 85 persons. Coalbed \nmethane (CBM) production from surface wells will require 9.36 ha of land lease for 20 years and \naffect  7  households  comprising  18  persons.  The  coal  mine  methane  (CMM)  transmission \npipelines component will affect 14.1 ha of land permanently, 111.26 ha of land temporarily, and \ndemolish 6,135 m2 of houses. In total, 186 households comprising 723 people will be affected  \n(35  households  comprising  128  persons  by  permanent  land  acquisition,  116  households \ncomprising 455 persons by temporary land occupation, and 35 households comprising 140 \npersons by house demolishment. For the CMM distribution component, 10.07 ha of land will be \npermanently acquired and 46 households comprising 173 people will be affected. In addition, \n197.43 ha of road will be occupied temporarily. To avoid LAR impacts, or if not possible, to \nminimize them, efforts were made in close consultation with local officials and village committees \nduring the project feasibility study and design stages. LAR issues are manageable if the affected \npeople are properly and fairly compensated and if their income and livelihood is improved or at \nleast restored after completion of the CMMDP. \n ",
        "Appendix 10  45 \n \n4.  The compensation of the permanent land loss is based on the Land Administration Law \nof the PRC of 1998 and associated Jincheng municipal laws and regulations, as well as the \nNotification for Strict Implementation of Commercialized Land Use Rights Transfer through Open \nBidding issued by the Ministry of State Land and Resources and Ministry of Inspection on \n26 August 2002. Two separate resettlement plans have been prepared for the CMMDP, which \nconform to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy on involuntary resettlement. \n \n5.  For permanent land acquisition for the 120 MW CMM-fired power plant component, the \ncompensation rate is based on the current bidding price of land in Jiafeng township, Quishui \ncounty, which is about CNY1.17 million per ha for agricultural land. The compensation rate of \nland lease for the CBM production from surface wells component is CNY140,055 per ha for \nfarmers and CNY4,170 per mu for collectives. For the CMM transmission pipelines component, \nthe compensation rate for permanent land acquisition adopts the current bidding price of land in \nJincheng, which is about CNY1.29 million per ha. The compensation rate for temporary land \nacquisition is CNY43,650 per ha and road rehabilitation CNY90.96 per square meter (m2). The \naverage replacement value of CNY600 per m2 will be used for structures lost due to the \nconstruction  of  the  CMM  transmission  pipeline  component.  Relocation,  transfer,  and \ntransportation allowances will also be provided. The compensation rates for the CMM distribution \ncomponent  will  be  based  on  the  current  bidding  price  in  Jincheng  City,  which  is  about \nCNY206,910 per ha for permanent land acquisition, and CNY102 per m2 for road recovery cost. \n \n6.   Compensation for land acquisition will be paid to all users with or without legal papers, \nincluding affected people settled on the land as long as they are included in the final list of \naffected people or are able to prove their occupation of affected plots before the cut-off date (31 \nDecember 2003). The payment will be made in cash according to the class and type of land and \ndwellings. The relocated households will also receive a transfer and transportation allowance. \nAny income lost from temporary land occupation will be paid in cash to the affected people at a \nrate of 1.5 times the average annual output value. As soon as the construction is completed, the \nland will be returned to the users in its original form. Compensation for standing crops, auxiliaries \nand other assets (e.g., toilets, tombs, and trees) will also be paid directly to the affected people. \n \n7.  The affected people have been notified about the key elements of the LAR plan on \nvarious occasions during meetings and interviews and have participated in its planning and \ndesign. For example, during the measurement surveys and socioeconomic survey in August \n2003, the distribution of the Resettlement Information Booklet for parts A and B of the CMMDP in \nSeptember 2003, and the redistribution of an updated Resettlement Information Booklet for part \nA in September 2004, extensive efforts were made to inform the affected people about the plan \nfor  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  and  to  integrate  the  needs  and  expectation  in  the \npreparation of the resettlement plans. In addition, a number of meetings and interviews to \ndiscuss key elements of the resettlement strategy have been convened in relocated and host \nvillages. Results of these meetings and concerns of the affected people were integrated into the \nresettlement plans. Further consultations will be carried out on the selection of housing sites and \ndistribution of housing plots. \n \n8.    Economic rehabilitation measures will include (i) provision of jobs to affected people \nduring project construction and operation; (ii) employment of affected people in local enterprises \nwith the assistance of local government; (iii) land readjustment and programs taken by the local \ngovernments to intensify and diversify farm operations for affected people in order to raise the \nvalue of production and income per unit of land; and (iv) training in scientific and diversified \nagricultural business to help affected people increase their income, such as courtyard economic \nactivities; technology for animal husbandry, planting of crops with high economic value, and \ngreenhouse winter fruits and vegetables; electronics; machinery and pipeline maintenance and \nrepair; equipment maintenance and repair of gas compression stations; sales methods and ",
        "46  Appendix 10 \nstrategy;  and  vehicle  maintenance  and  repair.  Vulnerable  households  will  enjoy  special \nprovisions, including CNY5,000 special social development fund assistance. The grievance \nredress procedures are well established and explanations are included in the Resettlement \nInformation Booklet provided to all affected people and villages. \n \n9.  The project implementation agencies (PIAs) are responsible for implementation of all \nmeasures: Jincheng Anthracite Mining Group Company Limited (JMC) for part A of the Project; \nShanxi Energy CBM Company Limited (SECC) for the transmission component under part B; \nand  Jincheng  CMM  Comprehensive  Utilization  Company  Limited  (JCCUC)  for  the  CMM \ndistribution component under part B. The project resettlement office (PRO) within each PIA has \nthe lead responsibility for coordinating the planning, implementation, financing, and monitoring of \nland acquisition and resettlement. The PRO of JMC will have three full-time staff members; of \nSECC, five, and of JCCUC, five.  \n \n10.  They  will  work  closely  with  relevant  township  officials,  who  will  be  responsible  for \ndelivering entitlements, selecting new housing sites, and monitoring development of replacement \nland, and other economic measures among affected and host villages. In order to ensure that the \nstaff of PRO and township and village committees can properly and smoothly handle the land \nacquisition and resettlement, a training program will be organized for the PRO officers. \n \n11.  The  preliminary  cost  estimate  for  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  program  is \nCNY78.77  million  ($9.54  million)  in  2004  prices,  including  contingencies.  Resettlement \nimplementation will be scheduled in stages to coincide with the overall project construction \nschedule. However, before the affected people are moved and land is acquired, a final baseline \nsurvey will be conducted in each village, and the household contracts will be negotiated and \nsigned. \n \n12.  There will be internal and external monitoring of the implementation of the resettlement \nplans. Monitoring methodologies are specified in the resettlement plans. Internal supervision and \nmonitoring will be done by the PRO of each implementing agency to ensure compliance with the \nprovisions of the resettlement plans. The PRO has agreed to a set of supervision milestones with \nADB, which should be in effect to ensure timely and effective implementation of resettlement \nactivities (Table A10.2). External monitoring will be carried out by an independent monitor under \ncontract to the PIAs. \n \n13.  There are about 900 minority persons, including Hui, Mongolian, Tibetan, Miao, Yi, Buyi, \nKorean, Manchurian, and Tujia, who will benefit from the improved CBM gas supply. About two \nHui  minority  households  in  the  project  area  will  be  affected  by  the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. Particular attention and special provisions will be paid to them to ensure their \ninterests and rights and socio-cultural customs will be protected. These provisions are presented \nin the resettlement plans and summary resettlement plan. \n ",

        "48  Appendix 11 \n \n \nPROJECT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Demand Forecast and Least-Cost Generation Plan \n \n1.  In 2000, electricity consumption in the Shanxi power grid increased by 10%, following by \n11.2%  in  2001,  and  12.6%  in  2002.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA) \nconsultants produced a demand forecast for electricity consumption in the Shanxi power grid. \nForecast was made for the short term (3 years) and the long term (up to 2020) on a sector \nbasis. The demand-side management measures, including implementation of time-of-day tariffs \nbased on the long-run marginal cost, were taken into account in the short- and long-term \nforecasts.  The  projected  growth  rates  of  electricity  demand  vary  for  different  consumer \ncategories, the highest being in construction and the lowest in agriculture. Electricity demand in \ngigawatt-hours is conservatively forecast to grow at 8.1% for 2002\u20132005, 7.0% for 2006\u20132010, \n6.9% for 2011\u20132015, and 6.8% for 2016\u20132020.  \n \n2.  Based on the energy demand forecast, the PPTA consultants carried out least-cost \ngeneration expansion planning using the generator of electric system planning model. The power \ngeneration options used in conjunction with plants under construction included 300 megawatts \n(MW) and 600 MW coal-fired power-generating units, gas turbine power plants, and combined-\ncycle power plants. The analysis shows that the planned commissioning of the coal mine \nmethane (CMM)-fired power plant at the Sihe mine under the Coalmine Methane Development \nProject (CMMDP) in 2006 (60 MW) and 2008 (60 MW) is supported by the least-cost generation \nexpansion plan for the Shanxi power grid. The analysis used constant 2003 prices and a discount \nrate of 12%. Tradable commodities were valued at border prices at the prevailing exchange rate \n(CNY8.3=  $1.0).  Non-tradable  commodities  were  valued  at  shadow  prices,  using  a  mix  of \nstandard and specific conversion factors.1  \n \n3.  Two  least-cost  generation  expansion  alternatives  for  the  Shanxi  power  grid  were \nconsidered. Alternative I is the base case, which is to construct the CMM-fired power plant and \ntransmission lines to connect the plant to the Shanxi power grid. In alternative II, the CMM-fired \npower plant will not be constructed; instead, 120 MW of coal-fired thermal power plant in the \nJMC operational areas is considered to meet the load requirement. The present values of cost \nflows (discounted to 2003 prices) for alternatives I and II are CNY169.583 and CNY169.655 \nbillion,  respectively.  The  results  indicate  that  the  least-cost  generation  expansion  scenario \nincluding the CMMDP compares favorably with the one without the CMMDP.  \n \n4.  The  result  of  the  least-cost  analysis  is  supported  by  equalizing  discount  rate  (EDR) \nanalysis.2 In the EDR analysis (Table A11.1), the CMM-fired power plant will replace coal-fired \nthermal for base load operation. The analysis compares the investment and operation cost of \nthe 106 MW CMM-fired power plant with that of 120 MW coal-fired thermal (the capacity \ndifference is due to different plant consumption rate and forced outage rate (FOR) between the \nCMM-fired power plant and the coal-fired thermal power plant). The main assumptions for the \ncandidates, including the fuel cost and capital cost, were found to be appropriate. The results of \nan environmental impact were also incorporated into the EDR analysis. The EDR shows that the \nCMM-fired power plant is superior up to a discount rate of 14.4%, compared with the alternative of \nlocating the coal-fired thermal power plant in the load center. \n \n                                                 \n1  A standard conversion factor of 0.93 was used. Border prices were used for all imported items. Local costs were \nshadow priced using group and specific conversion factors: 1.0 for equipment, 1.67 for steel, 0.76 for cement, \n0.82 for timber, 2.0 for skilled labor, and 0.67 for unskilled labor. Taxes and duties were excluded. \n2  The costs of environmental mitigation and the resettlement program have been included in the project cost \nestimates. ",
        "Appendix 11  49 \nB.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n5.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculations include (i) the CMM-fired power \nplant  and  production  of  CMM  and  coalbed  methane  (CBM),  (ii) CMM  transmission  and \ndistribution pipeline systems, and (iii) the whole CMMDP including all components. The benefits \nof the CMMDP mainly include (i) incremental electricity and gas outputs, and more efficient gas \nsupply; (ii) cost savings from meeting existing demand; and (iii) environmental benefits. As in \nthe least-cost analysis, the economic analysis applied the conversion factors to investment \ncosts  for  land,3 generation,  transmission,  and  distribution;  fuel  costs;  and  operation  and \nmaintenance costs, where applicable. For the EIRR calculations, the benefits of energy output \nwere valued based on consumer's willingness to pay, economic prices of gas and end-consumer \ntariffs. \n \n6.  An economic evaluation of the environmental impacts of the CMMDP was carried out \nbased on the benefits transfer method. The evaluation used (i) methodology adopted in the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s Workbook on Economic Evaluation of Environmental Impacts (1996) \nto determine the adjusted estimate of the monetary damages caused by air pollution during the \nstudy period, taking into account the location of the CMM-fired power plant, the emission level, \nand the population affected; and (ii) estimates of average annual climate change for carbon \nemissions to evaluate the monetary damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions.  \n \n7.  The EIRR calculation is a conservative approach, as it takes into account only the main \nbenefits of different components but includes all CMMDP-related costs. As presented in Tables \nA11.2 to 4, taking the local environmental benefits into account, this approach yields an EIRR of \n21.1% for the component that include the CMM-fired power plant and the production of CMM \nand  CBM,  27.5%  for  the  component  that  includes  the  CMM  transmission  and  distribution \npipeline systems, and 23.4% for the whole CMMDP. Sensitivity analyses were performed for the \nabove EIRRs. For the EIRR of the whole CMMDP, sensitivity analysis showed that the EIRR \nwould decrease to (i) 19.3% if the CMMDP were to experience a cost overrun of 20%; (ii) 15.3% \nif  the  benefits  were  reduced  by  20%;  (iii)  20.8%  if  the  CMMDP  were  to  experience  a \ncommissioning delay of one year; and (iv) 10.6% if (i), (ii), and (iii) all occurred.  \n \n8.  If the global environmental benefits were added to the benefits of the CMMDP, the EIRR \nfor the CMM-fired power plant and the production of CMM and CBM would increase to 30.9%, \nthe EIRR for CMM transmission and distribution pipeline systems would increase to 42.1%, and \nthe EIRR for the whole CMMDP would increase to 34.6%. \n \n                                                 \n  3  Land is valued at the economic opportunity cost (the estimated value of the best alternative utilization).

        "5  4  Appendix 12 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Parameters Used \n \n1.  Under part A, the Jincheng Anthracite Coal Mining Group Co. Ltd. (JMC) will connect the \nnew 120 MW power station (fully owned by JMC) to the Shanxi power grid, which is owned by \nShanxi Electric Power Company (SEPC), to improve reliability of supply, even though the power \nstation could be operated as an isolated power station disconnected from the grid. Electricity will \npass through transmission lines\u2014mostly owned by JMC\u2014from the terminal station at the power \nplant  to  the  distribution  point  at  the  mining  site  and  therefore  will  not  require  to  pay  any \ntransmission charge. However, electricity is required to pass through Duanshi substation, which \nis owned by SEPC. JMC has confirmed that they will pay a use of system charge of CNY0.0025 \nper kilowatt-hour (kWh) for all electricity generated by the power station and supplied to the Sihe \nmine. This use of systems charge is about 1% of the agreed purchase price of CNY0.234/kWh. \n \n2.  JMC  has  unconditionally  guaranteed  that  Sihe  mine  will  purchase  all  electricity \ngenerated by the 120 MW power plant at a price of CNY0.234/kWh, which will be increased in \nfuture in line with local inflation and other external factors. The tariff is approximately 20% lower \nthan the prevailing electricity tariffs in the Shanxi Province of CNY0.29/kWh. \n \n3.  Under  part  B,  the  proposed  retail  gas  prices  for  different  customer  categories  are \ncomparable to other alternatives available. For example, the fertilizer plant gas (2900 kcal/m3 \nenergy content), was sold at the following prices (CNY per m3):  residential: 0.45; utilities: 0.5; \ncommercial:  0.6;  and  industrial:  0.55.  If  the  fertilizer  gas  prices  are  adjusted  to  energy \nrquivalent, price for residents (at 4500 kcal/m3, the energy content of CMM) is CNY0.7/m3; for \nindustrial is CNY 0.93/m3, which are comparable to the proposed prices. The proposed prices \nare shown in Table A12.1. \n \n4.  In Shanghai natural gas is sold to consumers at CNY2.1/m3, which translates into a \nCMM equivalent price of about CNY1/m3. This confirms that the proposed consumer prices are \nin line with present consumer gas prices in the PRC. \n  \nTable A12.1: Summary Price Assumptions \n \nItem  Purchase Price  Sale Price \nPart A     \nCMM and CBM Production from  CMM and CBM: CNY0.2/m3 a  Electricity: CNY0.234/kWh \nSihe Mine and Surface Wells and \nCMM-Fired Power Plant \n   \nPart B \n1.

        "Appendix 12  55 \n5.  The cost of equity calculation is shown in Table A12.2. The weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC) represents a weighted average of the different returns (interests) paid to the \nvarious source of funds for the CMM Development Project (CMMDP). The calculation of WACC \nis based on the financing plan for the CMMDP and after adjustment for the corporate rate of \n33% for tax deductibility of interest payments and for local inflation projection of 2%, the post-tax \nreal WACC is calculated at 4.48% (Table A12.3). \n \nTable A12.2: Cost of Equity Calculation \n \nRisk-Free Rate (Nominal)  4.62% \nRisk-Free Rate (Real)  2.57% \nEquity Premium  3.50% \nEquity Beta  0.95 \nForecast Inflation  2.00% \nTax Rate  33.00% \nAfter-Tax Cost of Equity (Real)  5.88% \nAfter-Tax Cost of Equity (Nominal)  8.00% \nSource: Jincheng Anthracite Mining Group Company Limited, \nShanxi Energy CBM Company Limited, and Jincheng CMM \nComprehensive Utilization Company Limited. \n \nTable A12.3: Calculation of WACC \n \n      ADB  JBIC  Local  Govt.      \nProject Costs  Loan  Loan  Loan  Equity   Grant  Total \nAmount ($ million)  117.40  20.00  37.86  61.24  0.50  237.00\nWeight Factor %  49.54  8.44  15.97  25.84  0.21  100.00\nNominal Cost %  4.30  4.30  6.12  8.00  0.00   \nBusiness Tax %  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00   \nCorporate Income Tax %  33.00  33.00  33.00  0.00  0.00   \nTax-Adjusted Nominal Cost %  2.88  2.88  4.10  8.00  0.00   \nInflation Rate %  2.00  2.00  2.00  2.00  2.00   \nReal Cost %  0.86  0.86  2.06  5.88  0.00   \nMinimum Rate Test %  4.00  4.00  4.00  5.88  0.00   \nWeighted Component of WACC %  1.98  0.34  0.64  1.52  0.00   \nWeighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)  4.48%             \nADB = Asian Development Bank, Govt. = Government, JBIC = Japan Bank for International Cooperation, WACC = \nweighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n \n6.  Financial internal rate of return (FIRR) measures the financial viability of a project. Table \nA12.4  presents  each component\u2019s  receipts, payments  and  net  cash  flows  for  20  years of \noperations where it is assumed that the receipts and payments will remain constant in real \nterms once a steady state is reached. The present value of net benefits becomes zero at \ndiscount rates between 6.2%\u20137.2%. This represents the range of FIRRs for the three project \ncomponents while the FIRR for the overall Project is estimated at 6.5%. Since the cash flows in \nFIRR calculation are post-tax the FIRR is to be compared against the post tax WACC of 4.48%. \nSince the range of FIRRs is higher than WACC, all components are financially viable. Sensitivity \nanalysis shows that subjected to adverse conditions, the FIRR remains reasonably robust, \nexcept if all adverse conditions occur simultaneously. ",

        "Appendix 13  57 \n \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nSector identified as a national priority in  Yes  Sector identified as a national priority  No \ncountry poverty analysis?    in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \n \nIn line with the Government\u2019s energy sector strategy to promote socioeconomic development and to meet the basic \nneeds of the poor, increased clean energy supply is needed to support the national poverty reduction program. \nAdequate and clean energy supply is seen as essential to human well-being and a crucial enabler of economic \nactivities. The supply of coal mine methane (CMM) and coalbed methane (CBM) will decrease the coal burning that \ncauses serious environmental and air-related diseases, particularly reduce the impacts on the poor, women and \nchildren who suffer most. The increased gas supply to local industries and commercial users will enable many \nenterprises to expand production and increase the quality and values of products, which in turn will create more \nemployment and income opportunities for the local population and generate more tax revenues for the Shanxi \nprovincial government to enhance its poverty reduction efforts. The improved urban environment can improve the local \ninvestment climate to attract more investment to the region and promote the growth of industry and service sectors. \nThrough careful design of project subcomponents and proactive policy dialogue, the CMM Development  Project \n(CMMDP) provides free gas connection and tariff subsidy to the poor so that they can have access to the clean energy \nfor their daily life. Moreover, the CMMDP will improve the safety of coal miners, who are mostly the poor people and \nimprove the quality of life for the local people. Overall, the supply of clean CMM will complement the poverty reduction \nefforts in the Shanxi Province. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                     Targeting Classification: General intervention \nPoverty analysis has been conducted as an integral part of project planning and design and with the use of \nquantitative and qualitative methodologies. Various poverty data have been used in the analysis at national, provincial, \nmunicipal,  and  subproject  levels  through  field  poverty  assessments,  questionnaire  surveys  and  stakeholder \nconsultations, including with the project beneficiaries and affected people, and secondary data collection. Extensive \nparticipatory methods have been used to assess the local poverty situation and energy needs of the poor. Policy \ndialogue has been undertaken to form a comprehensive poverty reduction and social strategy for the CMMDP that \nincludes the following key components: \n \n1.  Providing clean energy supply to the poor: The CMMDP will directly benefit a total urban population of about \n410,000 in the project beneficiary area of Jincheng. Of the total beneficiary population, about 53,670 people or \nabout 13.1% of the total beneficiaries belong to the poor measured by the local urban poverty lines. The \nincreased use of CMM is expected to decrease the use of conventional fuels such as raw coal and coal briquettes \nthat cause serious environmental and health impacts, which will indirectly benefit the entire population (particular \nfor the poor) residing in the municipality of Jincheng, which is home to about 221,500 of rural poor based on the \npoverty line of CNY1,000 and about 97,000 urban poor who have an annual per-capita net income of less than \nCNY1,800 (weighted average) for urban areas. \n \n2.  Creating jobs for the poor: The construction of the CMMDP will create about 1,200 full-time jobs during \nconstruction and 845 during operation. Of these, about 780 full-time jobs for the poor and women with an \nestimated CNY8.5 million wage payment will go to the poor and women during construction and 420 full-time jobs \nduring operations or CNY4.6 million of the wage payments per year are expected to go to the poor and women. In \naddition, local procurement of the materials required for the program is expected to create additional jobs. \n \n3.  Reducing air pollution and air-related diseases for the poor: The development and increase of CMM and \nCBM supplies and use will reduce air pollution by replacing the energy supplies from the coal-fired thermal power \nplants and other plants using coal as fuel and household coal burning for cooking and heating in the beneficiary \nurban areas. The CMMDP will substantially reduce the consumption of coal by an estimated 429,000 tons a year \nand result in annual air emission reduction of 7,866 tons of particulate matter (PM), 4,901 tons of sulfur dioxide \n(SO ); 2,077 tons of nitrogen oxides (NO ); and 612,058 tons of carbon dioxide (CO ). The improvement of air \n2  x 2\nquality will reduce the morbidity and mortality rate of air-related diseases and associated medical costs, loss of \nhealthy working days, as well as human suffering. The poor, elderly, children, and women, who have less coping \nresources and are more vulnerable, will benefit disproportionately from the replacement of coal and wood. In \nparticular, women usually spend more time than men on cooking and the length of their exposure to indoor house \nair pollution from cooking and heating is considerable higher than men. As such, the CMMDP would bring to \nwomen much greater benefits than to men. A recent medical study in the PRC indicates that the incidence rate of \nrespiratory diseases (such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, throat infection, and tonsillitis) amounts to 77.78% on \naverage for communities using individual coal stoves for cooking and space heating, which is 50% higher than \nthat for areas where centralized heating is provided. \n ",
        "58  Appendix 13 \n \n \n4.  Induced socioeconomic benefits to the poor: By increasing CMM supplies to local residents, industries, \ncommercial  users,  and  public  institutions,  the  CMMDP  is  expected  to  result  in  major  improvement  of \nsocioeconomic infrastructure for the project areas and promote regional economic development by accelerating \nthe growth of the region\u2019s gross domestic product and by changing production process from manual- or coal- and \ndiesel-operated into methane gas-operated to improve the efficiency and product quality and output values, which \nin turn could facilitate poverty reduction in the region. The improved urban environment can improve the local \ninvestment climate to attract more investment to the region, and act as a catalyst for future development. It can \nalso have provisions for the growth of other sectors in the region in addition to industry and business, such as real \nestate, transportation, service, recreation and tourism, and in turn will increase employment opportunities and \nincome for the local population and the poor. Moreover, the greater availability of methane gas would generate \nincreased local government tax revenues. A proportion of total revenues could be spent on the poverty reduction \nprograms on health, education, water supply and sanitation, employment schemes and so on. \n \n5.  Improving occupational safety of poor miners: The CMMDP would also help reduce the risk of underground \nmethane gas explosions during coal mining, which account for approximately 80% of the coal mine accidents. The \nofficial death rate in Shanxi Province is approximately 5\u20136 persons per million tons of coal mined. The supply of \nmethane gas will replace the use of coal which would translate into the reduction in the loss of up to 5 human \nlives a year from mine accidents. It would also set an example for other coal mines as how to improve CMM \ndrainage. The CMMDP will increase the safety of coal miners. As most of the coal miners are the poor people, the \nsaved lives from the CBM and CMM development and use would therefore accrue to the poor.  \n \n6.  Enhancing quality of life for the poor: The socioeconomic survey results show that the vast majority of the local \nresidents (92%) consider that the CMMDP will improve the overall quality of life, 87% consider that the supply of \nCMM will reduce the housework for women, 75% believe that the CMMDP will reduce health problems, and 50% \nbelieve that the CMMDP will improve heating. \n \n7.  Implementing  gas  supply  assistance  programs  to  the  poor:  To  make  the  CMMDP  more  effective  in \nencouraging the poor to use more clean energy and ensure that the poor will benefit directly from the CMMDP \nand facilitate the poverty reduction efforts in the project area, the following key poverty reduction programs have \nbeen agreed and will be implemented by the Shanxi provincial government (SPG), Jincheng Anthracite Mining \nGroup Limited (JMC), Shanxi Energy CBM Company Limited (SECC), and Jincheng CMM Comprehensive \nUtilization Company Limited (JCCUC) as a result of proactive policy dialogue: \n \n(i)  JMC will put additional CNY1 million investment in expansion of the Sihe Mine Hospital (currently only serves \nthe employees of  the Sihe mine) in Jiafeng township in 2004 to serve over 70,000 local people, including \nabout 7,000 poor people, who are facing difficulties of poor economic, transportation and medical conditions, \nand access to doctors. The expansion of the hospital will improve the quality and services (in particular the \nprovision of better surgery equipment and the medical beds) of the hospital for local community residents \nwho would benefit from the services of the hospital and be able save transportation costs of CNY26 for each \nreturn trip or annual CNY61,000 in total for medical treatment in hospitals of Jincheng City 70 kilometers (km) \naway, or of Qinshui county 50 km  away. Most important, JMC will provide 15% or about CNY8 reduction per \nperson-times of medical cost for the poor living under minimum living guarantee (MLG). In addition, JMC will \nalso construction of a 3-km rural gravel road from Xiahe to Panzhuang to Xuwa villages (Panzhuang \ntownship, Qingshui county) with an investment of CNY1 million between 2005 and 2006 to serve about 5,000 \nlocal population, including about 500 poor persons.  \n(ii) SECC will supply CMM  to an industrial zone in Yangcheng county, which is expected to attract investments \nof a minimum of CNY200 million within five years. The replacement of coal with CMM will also make the \nexisting production process (i.e., ceramic products manufacturing) more environment-friendly. The industrial \nzone is expected to provide 3,500 jobs for local poor and women and generate about CNY33.60 million in \nincome per year; and, \n(iii) JCCUC will provide free gas connection and 50% tariff reduction for the poor households in the CMM \ndistribution areas. Such a scheme is consistent with the ADB policy that tariff subsidy should be transparent \nand explicit; this would result in CNY3.124 million savings in the project areas in terms of connection fees \nand CNY0.37 million for the first year in terms of gas tariffs for 1,800 poor households registered under the \nMLG program of the Jincheng Civil Affairs Bureau. The financing will come from respective municipal and \ncounty finance bureaus. The connection exemption and gas tariff reduction will be extended on a gradual \nbasis to the remaining poor households in the project area.  \n \n ",

The public consultation and participation process is the \ncore element of the design and implementation of the CMMDP and is prepared through participatory approaches \ninvolving various stakeholders, including the beneficiaries and affected population. A community participation and \nawareness program will be formulated and implemented by JMC, SECC, and JCCUC to serve as an ongoing \nconsultation mechanism for the involvement of all stakeholders. \n \nParticipation strategy:                                                                                                                             Yes \n \nThe  community  participation  has  been  undertaken  during  the  planning  and  design  of  the  CMMDP.  Ongoing \nconsultations will be carried out by SPG, JMC, SECC, and JCCUC during the resettlement process to properly \naddress the needs and problems of the affected people. Further consultations will also be undertaken to understand \nand meet their evolving needs and expectations of the CMM users as well as increase the awareness of the public, \nespecially the beneficiaries, about the benefits of the CMMDP and encourage the active involvement of local \ncommunities to maximize their support to the CMMDP, promote CMM consumption and savings and raise the social \nacceptance of user fees. The consultations can take the forms of annual questionnaire surveys by consumer category, \ncombined with ad hoc community forums. Women\u2019s organizations and schools usually have extensive networks that \ncan be used for the distribution of information materials and survey questionnaires. \n \nD.            Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nIn order to maximize the project benefits to women, preferential policies will be given to women for the employment \nand training opportunities generated from the project construction and operation phases, and the proposed poverty \nreduction programs of the CMMDP. Women\u2019s needs and interests will be fully represented in the implementation of \nthe CMMDP. A proactive employment policy and targeted training programs for the women will be adopted by JMC, \nSECC, and JCCUC. It is expected that 40% of the employment opportunities will be filled by women and the poor with \nthe implementation of gender equity policies. Particular attention will be paid to women-headed households during the \nland acquisition and resettlement process. A CNY5,000 special social development fund will be provided to women-\nheaded households affected by the CMMDP for income generation and livelihood opportunities. \n \nOutput prepared:                                                                                                                                  No \n \n \nE.

        "60  Appendix 13 \n \nAffordability   Not significant  The affordability of the poor has been carefully assessed.  By  Yes \n  2006, the consumers are expected to spend about 2.8% more \nof  household  income  on  gas.  These  percentages  are \nconsidered  to  be  at  an  affordable  level.  The  impact  of \nexpenditure increase for energy is considered to be minimal \ngiven that the total percent paid by each household is currently \na small percentage of their total income. Impact on households \nin the lowest income bracket can be potentially significant but \nwill be mitigated through the reduction of monthly user fees. \nLabor  Not Significant  The construction and operation of the CMMDP will generate  No \n  about 2,050 jobs for local beneficiaries. No job and income \n  losses are expected to take place.  \nIndigenous  Not Significant  There  are  about  900  minority  persons,  including  Hui,  No \nPeople  Mongolian, Tibetan, Miao, Yi, Buyi, Korean, Manchurian, and \nTujia, who will benefit from the improved CMM supply. About 2 \nHui minority households in the project area will be affected by \nthe land acquisition and resettlement. Particular attention and \nspecial provisions will be paid to them to ensure their interests \nand rights and socio-cultural customs will be protected.
