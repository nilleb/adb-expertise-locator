THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the additional financing of the Road Network \nUpgrading Sector Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed additional financing will support the scaling up of the project through the \naddition of 97 kilometers (km) of national roads to the 81 km to be upgraded and climate \nproofed under the current project scope.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The government adopted a strategic development plan (SDP) for 2011\u20132030 in 2011 \nthat aims to sustain economic growth, fast-track economic development, and modernize and \ndiversify the economy by providing the country with high-quality infrastructure.3 The SDP is \nbased on the three pillars of developing social capital, infrastructure, and the economy. It \nprioritizes public investments in 2011\u20132015 that will create the conditions to attract private \ninvestment and support private sector growth. This includes investments in roads, since a safe \nand efficient transport system is essential to progress in all three of the SDP\u2019s priority areas. \nDuring  2011\u20132017,  the  SDP  and  current  government  operational  plans  concentrate  on \nupgrading roads to achieve quick returns and transformational changes needed for economic \nprogress, inclusive development, and social stability. \n \n4.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country partnership strategy for Timor-Leste for \n2011\u20132015 has carried on ADB\u2019s previous concentration on the development and management \nof infrastructure, and on complementary activities that support the private sector as a driver of \nchange.4 The strategy aims to help the country make services more available outside of the \ncapital city of Dili by improving transport connectivity to support growth in the rural economy. \nThis is expected to reduce poverty by giving the poor access to markets and basic public \nservices. It will also help spread economic activity and the benefits of the country\u2019s petroleum \nwealth more broadly to areas beyond the capital.  \n \n5.  The  road  network  in  Timor-Leste  had  deteriorated  during  a  25-year  conflict  that \npreceded independence in 2002 due to a lack of investment in maintenance, rehabilitation, and \nupgrades. This deterioration continued during 2002\u20132011 when the efforts made to rehabilitate \nthe network were inadequate. Poor road conditions were constraining the country\u2019s efforts to \ndevelop.5 In  2011,  however,  the  SDP  recognized  that  more  substantial  investments  were \nneeded in road rehabilitation and upgrades if the network was to be made sustainable. \n                                                \n1   The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed \nLoans to the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Road Network Upgrading Sector Project. Manila. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Road Network Upgrading \nSector Project (TA 8146-TIM). \n3  Government of Timor-Leste. 2011. Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan, 2011\u20132030. Dili. \n4  ADB. 2011. Country Partnership Strategy: Timor-Leste, 2011\u20132015. Manila. The country partnership strategy \naddresses four of the five core areas of ADB operations designated by ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term \nStrategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. Manila. \n5   A condition survey conducted in 2012 with the support of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) found \nthat 76% of a 950-kilometer (km) sample of the overall 1,428 km national road network was in fair condition and in \nneed of intervention in the near future. About 23% was determined to be in poor condition and requiring immediate \nattention.  ", "2 \n6.  Led by ADB, Timor-Leste\u2019s development partners have responded to the challenge in a \nsubstantial, coordinated way. They include the Government of Australia, the European Union, \nthe Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the World Bank. ADB has supported \nthe Road Network Development Sector Project, the Road Network Upgrading Project, and the \nRoad Network Upgrading Sector Project.6 Together with projects now being implemented with \nthe support of JICA and the World Bank, these operations will upgrade about 360 km or 25% of \nthe national road network by the end of 2018 (map).7 The Government of Australia and the \nEuropean Union have focused their complementary activities on the district and rural road \nnetwork and have emphasized support for road rehabilitation and maintenance through the \ndevelopment of small-scale contractors and community involvement. ADB\u2019s projects are on \ntrack to upgrade 190 km of national road by 2018. About 100 km of these roads are expected to \nbe mostly completed by the end of 2015. Including the expanded scope of the overall Road \nNetwork Upgrading Sector Project to be funded under the proposed additional financing, these \nADB activities and those under way with assistance from other development partners will have \nupgraded at least 570 km or 40% of the country\u2019s national road network when completed.  \n \n7.  The Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communication (MPWTC) lacks the full \nstaff and institutional capacity needed to properly implement capital works or maintain road \nassets. ADB-financed technical assistance (TA) is supporting scholarships for its professional \nstaff and a program to build the necessary technical knowledge. The TA is also helping to \nformulate  a  capacity  development  framework  and  a  strategic  development  plan  for  the \nMPWTC.8 A project management unit (PMU) embedded in the MPWTC and responsible for \nmanaging ADB, JICA, and World Bank programs has considerable experience in dealing with \nthe requirements of development partners and other government agencies. To date, the PMU \nhas successfully coordinated the activities of the development partners and has ensured that \nthe projects they support have applied consistent technical standards and safeguards. It has \nalso been successful in managing the interface with government agencies whose cooperation is \nnecessary for smooth implementation of individual projects. \n \n8.  The MPWTC continues to develop systems for routine maintenance of national roads. It \nplans to introduce performance-based maintenance (PBM) contracts for all upgraded roads. \nHowever, civil works contracts for development partner-financed roads require contractors to \ncarry out routine maintenance for 2 years after the defects notification period. 9 This ensures \nthat the immediate and short-term maintenance needs on these upgraded roads are met. Two \nPBM contracts being piloted under ADB\u2019s Road Network Development Project have introduced \nthe concept to local contractors, consultants, and ministry personnel. The experience to be \ngleaned  while  overseeing  the  2-year  contractor  maintenance  periods  will  also  help  build \nMPWTC capacity to implement network wide PBM. ADB is continuing to work closely with the \nministry  to  help  it  plan,  budget,  procure,  and  implement  maintenance  operations.  An \ninternational road maintenance specialist financed by ADB is currently helping the MPWTC\u2019s \nnewly created maintenance division to prepare a detailed maintenance plan for 2016.10 \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2009.

This is known as the defects notification period. The contractor is responsible for \nmaintenance of the accepted works for the 2 years after this 1-year period ends.  \n10  ADB. 2007.

Progress toward the \nintended outputs has been satisfactory, and the outcome is expected to be achieved. The \ncontract packages for civil works and consultant services have been procured, and civil works \nhave started. No cost overrun is foreseen, although the project is about 14% behind schedule \ndue mostly to longer-than-anticipated times for procurement, contract awards, and contractor \nmobilization.  The  government  has  streamlined  the  related  procedures.  Contracts  are  now \ndeemed to be endorsed if the government\u2019s Court of Accounts makes no objection within 30 \ndays  of  its  submission  for  approval,  facilitating  the  process.11 The  National  Procurement \nCommission will use a single-stage, one-envelope procedure for future civil works contracts \ninstead of the single-stage, two-envelope procedure, potentially shortening the awards process \nby up to 3 months. These measures will prevent delays similar to those faced by the current \nproject to be repeated in the overall scaled-up project.  \n \n10.  Compliance during the current project with ADB and government safeguards has been \nsatisfactory. While the core subproject has only a minimal resettlement impact, the government \nhas budgeted the funds needed to compensate affected persons. \n \n11.  The current project meets ADB\u2019s criteria for a project progressing well except it is not \nrated \u201con track\u201d because of a shortfall in actual disbursements against projections.12 Civil works \nare on schedule but payments to contractors, and hence disbursements, are delayed due to an \nadministrative review of tax liabilities on a separate contract that is not financed by ADB, and \ndelays in incorporating the company as a local business.13 Payment delays have not materially \nimpacted implementation.14 The project is eligible for additional financing because (i) it will \nremain technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound, and each new subproject \nwill be required to meet the subproject eligibility criteria; (ii) the subprojects are accorded high \npriority by the government; (iii) the subprojects are consistent with the project\u2019s development \nobjectives; and (iv) the overall project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy. \n \n12.  Additional financing of the current project is the most efficient way for ADB to maintain \nthe momentum of its program of support for achieving the government\u2019s objectives in the road \ntransport sector. Three new subprojects are proposed under the additional financing to upgrade \n97 km of national road. These will ensure the completion of the north coast road by the end of \n2019 (map). After this scaling up and the completion of all of its projects, ADB will have helped \nupgrade 20% (285 km) of the national road network and made a significant impact on improving \nconnectivity across the country. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the project will be increased and more efficient movement of people and \ngoods. The outcome will be a more reliable and safer road network. The impact and outcome \nare unchanged from the current project, although the project\u2019s expanded road improvement \noutput will directly benefit a greater number of people.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n11  The Court of Accounts reviews and confirms that all legal requirements for contract procurement and awards with a \nvalue of more than $5 million have been met. Initially, no time limit was provided for its reviews. \n12  ADB. 2011. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. OM H5/BP. Manila. \n13  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  On 29 September 2015, in view of this situation, ADB\u2019s President granted a waiver of the project performance \nrating requirement for scaling up. \n ", "4 \nC.  Outputs \n14.   Although the current project\u2019s four outputs will remain essentially the same in the overall \nproject with the additional financing, scope and targets or timelines will change for two of them. \n \n15.  Output 1: National roads upgraded and climate proofed. An additional 97 km of \nnational roads will be strengthened with the additional financing. The existing sealed pavements \nof the Baucau\u2013Lautem, Maubara\u2013Karimbala, and Atabae\u2013Mota Ain sections will be widened \nfrom less than 4.5 meters to 6 meters with the provision of asphalt surfacing. Vulnerability to \ndamage from severe rainfall, sea level rise, and other potential effects of climate change will be \nreduced  through  engineering  countermeasures.  These  will  include  drainage  structures  of \nsuitable sizes, the raising of road levels in flood-prone areas, and the use of bioengineering to \npromote slope stability. This will be in addition to the similar work being undertaken by the \ncurrent project on 81 km of national roads. Average roughness on all 178 km of the overall \nproject\u2019s roads will be reduced to the same level.  \n \n16.  Output  2:  Detailed  designs  for  future  priority  road  links  prepared.  Detailed \nengineering design and social and environmental due diligence will be prepared for about 169 \nkm of national roads.  \n \n17.  Output 3: Performance-based road maintenance expanded. Civil works contracts for \nboth the original and additional project\u2019s roads will provide for a 2-year maintenance period \nstarting after the defects notification period during which the contractor will undertake PBM. On-\nthe-job training will be delivered by the contract supervisor. \n \n18.  Output 4: Awareness raised of road safety and transport-related social issues. \nRoad  safety  awareness  will  be  increased  by  extending  the  community-based  road  safety \nawareness program, including an education program for schools, drivers, road users and the \ncommunity, and implementing an HIV/AIDS prevention program to all communities along both \nthe original and the additional project\u2019s roads. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n19.  The total cost of the overall project after additional financing is estimated to be $201.86 \nmillion after the additional financing of $76.22 million (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \nCurrent  Additional \nItem      Amounta  Financingb  Total \nA.

The government has  requested  a  loan  of  $53,000,000 from  ADB\u2019s ordinary  capital \nresources (OCR) to help finance the project. The OCR loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan), and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.15 The OCR loan will finance civil \nworks, taxes and duties, late payment charges imposed by suppliers and contractors, bank \ncharges, local transport costs, insurance costs, and interest and commitment charges during \nconstruction on the OCR loan.16   \n \n21.  The  government  has  also  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR16,574,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will \nhave a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2% per annum \nduring the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan  agreements.  The  Asian  Development  Fund  loan  will  finance  civil  works,  consultants\u2019 \nservices, project management, taxes and duties, late payment charges imposed by suppliers \nand  contractors,  bank charges,  local  transport  and  insurance  charges,  and  interest  during \nconstruction on the Asian Development Fund loan. \n \n22.  The government will contribute $71.81 million to the cost of the overall project, of which \n$2.39 million is for the additional financing.17 The government contribution will finance civil \nworks, land acquisition, taxes and duties, and resettlement costs. The government has assured \nADB that it will meet any financing shortfall to ensure project outputs are fully implemented.

The amount of \ntaxes and duties (i) is within the reasonable threshold identified during the country partnership strategy preparation \nprocess, (ii) does not represent an excessive share of the project investment plan, and (iii) will only be financed in \nrespect of ADB-financed expenditures. Financing of taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the \nproject. \n17  Net additional financing from government for the overall project is $2.39 million comprising additional investment \ncost of $18.53 million, and reduced costs of $16.14 million accruing to government\u2019s cost share for the original \nproject.  \n ", "6 \nGovernment  69.42  56.3  2.39  3.1  71.81  35.6 \nTotal  123.25  100.0  78.61  100.0  201.86  100.0 \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding. \na   Refers to the original amount and additional financing from the Global Environment Facility (GEF). \nb  At US dollar\u2013SDR exchange rate prevailing 1 September 2015. \nc   Additional financing of the project from the GEF was approved by the President 11 September 2014. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The PMU established in the MPWTC is responsible for the management of the original \nproject and will manage the additional project outputs (para. 7). The PMU is headed by a project \nmanager and has a full-time professional staff, including a chief technical advisor, a road \nconstruction advisor, a road maintenance engineer, and a financial administrator. The PMU has \nbeen strengthened steadily as its portfolio responsibilities have grown. International and national \nspecialists provide a full-time safeguards unit within the PMU. \n \n24.  Further additional financing, including cofinancing to meet a potential financing gap for \nimplementing additional candidate subprojects, may be considered in the future if the project \nperforms well. \n \n25.  The implementation arrangements for the overall project are summarized in Table 3. \nWith the exception of a change in the original financing arrangements for the new subprojects, \nthe arrangements are essentially unchanged from the current project. The arrangements and \nchanges are described in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).18 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2014\u2013December 2020 \nEstimated completion date  December 2020 (Loan closing date: 30 June 2021) \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Council for the Administration of the Infrastructure Fund  \nMinister of planning and strategic development (chair)  \nMinister of public works (member) \nMinister of transport and communications (member) \nMinister of finance (member) \n(ii)   Executing agency  Council for the Administration of the Infrastructure Fund \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  MPWTC \n(iv)  Implementation unit  PMU, Department of Roads Bridges and Flood Control, 12 staff \nProcurement  Civil works  4 contracts (2 current and 2  $136.0 \nadditional financing)  million \nNational competitive  2 contracts (current financing)  $9.0 million \nbidding (financed by the \nGovernment of Timor-\nLeste) \nShopping  10 contracts (current financing)  $0.5 million \nCommunity participation  Multiple  $0.2 million \nConsulting services  QCBS (design)  64 person-months (current  $2.2 million \nfinancing) \nQCBS (supervision)  2 contracts, 936 person-months  $12.5 million \n(1 current and 1 additional \nfinancing) \n  ICS  14 contracts, 237 person- $2.7 million \nmonths (current and additional \n                                                \n18  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nAspects  Arrangements \nfinancing extension) \nAdvance contracting and retroactive  Civil works packages for approved subprojects \nfinancing  Consulting  services  for  construction  supervision.

Vulnerability to damage from severe rainfall, sea level rise, \nand  other  potential  effects  of  climate  change  will  be  reduced  through  engineering \ncountermeasures, including providing suitably-sized drainage structures, raising road levels in \nflood-prone areas, and using bioengineering to promote slope stability. \n \nB.

Subprojects financed by ADB will be required to meet the subproject selection criteria.19 \nEconomic analysis has been undertaken for each of the three new subprojects in the overall \nproject in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines, and each was found to meet the subproject \nselection criteria (footnote 18). 20  The analysis estimated economic internal rates of return of \n14.1% for the Maubara\u2013Karimbala and Atabae\u2013Mota Ain roads combined and 10.7% for the \nBaucau\u2013Lautem section. An engineering assessment has found that it costs significantly less to \nmaintain an upgraded road in Timor-Leste than it does to maintain unimproved roads. Timor-\nLeste has a sovereign wealth fund derived from petroleum revenue that has accumulated since \n2005 and currently stands at about $16 billion. Provided that the fund is prudently managed, \nTimor-Leste  will  remain  able  to  allocate  funds  for  maintenance  of  road  transport  assets, \nincluding those created under the project. \n \nC.  Governance \n28.  The governance environment has not changed since it was assessed for the current \nproject. The public financial management system is heavily centralized. Numerous controls \nresult in bottlenecks that slow payment processes and weaken budget implementation. The \ngovernment has promoted decentralization of noncore financial management functions from the \nMinistry of Finance to line ministries as capacity in these agencies has improved. However, the \nsystem for payments still involves reviews of payment certificates provided by the PMU and the \nMPWTC by several agencies. \n \n29.  The government created the National Procurement Commission in 2011. With the help \nof the PMU, the commission has administered the bidding processes for ADB-financed projects \n                                                \n19  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "8 \nduring 2012\u20132014 in a satisfactory way and in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines. However, \nprocurement still needs to be made more transparent and efficient, and a balance between risk \nand  accountability  for  projects  without  development  partner  oversight  has  not  yet  been \nachieved. \n \n30.  The executing agency, the Council for the Administration of the Infrastructure Fund, was \nestablished in 2011 to oversee the use of the state fund for financing infrastructure.21 The Civil \nService Act (2004) provides standards, principles, definitions, and guidelines for civil service \nadministration; a code of ethics for civil servants; and an administrative disciplinary mechanism. \nA  law  creating  a  new  anticorruption  commission  became  effective  in  2009,  and  the  first \nanticorruption commissioner was appointed in 2010. However, the commission needs more \nresources.  \n \n31.  To mitigate the governance risks, the MPWTC has implemented several ADB-supported \ninfrastructure projects through its PMU (footnote 7). This PMU will oversee execution of the \nexpanded project scope under the additional financing. The PMU has a financial administrator \nwith considerable experience with ADB-financed projects. Based on ADB\u2019s previous project \nexperience, the PMU has the capacity to manage the project. \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  the \ngovernment  and  the  executing  agency.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n33.  The  primary  beneficiaries  of  the  project  will  be  (i)  vehicle  drivers  and  passengers,  \nnonmotorized transport users, and all others using the roads to be upgraded; (ii) households in \ncommunities that sell cash crops and other agricultural produce; (iii) providers of passenger and \ngoods transport services and commercial truck drivers; and (iv) small businesses and traders, \nincluding vendors at local markets, trade store owners, coffee and other produce buyers, and \nsmall-  and medium-sized  enterprises  in the district  capitals  and  towns.  Key  social  service \nproviders, such as those in the education and health sectors, will also benefit from the road \nupgrades. \n \n34.  The women of Timor-Leste have generally been excluded from infrastructure-related \njobs and decision making related to infrastructure development. The project aims to redress \nthis.  Classified  by  ADB  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  the  project  will  support  the \nempowerment of women and ensure that they are given some of the jobs the subprojects will \ngenerate.22 The  project  will  (i) incorporate  women\u2019s  views  in  the  project  design;  (ii)  raise \nawareness of gender and transport security and HIV/AIDS; (iii) have a quota for the employment \nof women in the construction work, favoring unemployed widows, female heads of households, \nand  other  vulnerable  groups;  and  (iv)  have  a  quota  for  the  involvement  by  women  in \nbioengineering and maintenance works. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n35.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project has been classified \ncategory B for resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. The road improvement \n                                                \n21 The Infrastructure Fund is derived from the petroleum revenue-financed sovereign wealth fund and used for \nfinancing infrastructure development. \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nwork  is  expected  to  be  mostly  within  the  existing  road  corridor,  but  it  will  require  some \nresettlement from small areas of land, some houses and shops, and roadside stalls and kiosks. \nA resettlement framework has been prepared, providing guidelines on screening, assessment, \nand the preparation of resettlement plans for road subprojects. The resettlement plan has been \nprepared and disclosed for the subproject under the current project. Draft resettlement plans for \nthe additional subprojects have been prepared in accordance with the resettlement framework \nand will be cleared by ADB prior to its approval of each subproject. They will then be disclosed \non  the  government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  websites.  The  MPWTC  will  publicly  disclose  each  draft \nresettlement plan and disseminate relevant information in local languages in subproject areas. \n \n36.   The MPWTC will finalize the resettlement plan for each subproject after the detailed \ndesign is prepared and ensure that affected persons receive compensation in line with the \nresettlement  framework.  Each  resettlement  plan  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) and Timor-Leste laws and be cleared by ADB. The MPWTC will (i) appoint a \nfocal person for land issues; (ii) set up an environmental and social unit within the PMU, \nincluding social safeguard specialists; (iii) coordinate with the Department of Land, Property, \nand Cadastral Services, as well as other relevant agencies; and (iv) set up committees to \nimplement resettlement activities. MPWTC\u2019s social safeguard capacity will be strengthened by \nproviding resettlement specialists for 30 person-months and by conducting training. \n \n37.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  the  environment.  An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework has been prepared to ensure that the project \nwill  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  Timor-Leste  laws.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) was prepared for the current project based on the detailed \ndesign. This was disclosed, along with the environmental framework, on the government and \nADB websites. IEEs for each additional subproject under additional financing have also been \nprepared. They  will  be  updated  based  on  the  detailed  designs  and cleared  by  ADB. The \nenvironmental impacts of road upgrading works during construction and operation have been \nassessed and can be mitigated to acceptable levels.  \n \n38.  The environmental management plan (EMP) from the updated IEE for each subproject \nwill  be  incorporated  in  civil  works  contracts.  The  EMP  will  guide  the  PMU,  supervision \nconsultants,  and  contractors  in  managing,  monitoring,  and  reporting  environmental  impact \nmitigation and compliance. Civil works will not start until (i) the contractor has received training \non environmental management and has submitted the site-specific EMP; (ii) the site-specific \nEMP has been reviewed and cleared by the PMU, the supervision consultant, and ADB; and (iii) \nan environmental license has been obtained from the National Directorate for Environment. The \nenvironmental management capacity of the Directorate of Roads, Bridges, and Flood Control \nand the PMU will be strengthened by environment specialists who will provide training. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the risk  assessment  and  risk management  plan. 23 The  risks can  be managed  and  are \nmitigated by the design of the project. The intended benefits are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n23  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk  Mitigating Measures \nLand acquisition delays the start  Resettlement plans will be finalized and compensation will be paid before civil \nof civil works.  works begin.

ASSURANCES \n \n40.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. \n \n41.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the loan agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n42.
