THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nPapua New Guinea (PNG) for the COVID-19 Rapid Response Program under the Countercyclical \nSupport Facility's COVID-19 pandemic response option (CPRO).1 \n \n2.  Among the Pacific developing member countries of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nonly PNG is currently affected by community transmission of the coronavirus disease (COVID-\n19). The country is classified as a small island developing state, in a fragile and conflict-affected \nsituation.2 It exhibits vulnerabilities in its economy and health system, limited fiscal space, and \nsignificant reliance on development partners to  help it achieve its development objectives. \nThe economy is projected to contract by 2.9% in 2020, and poverty and unemployment are rising. \nTo manage the adverse socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19, the government is implementing a \n$769 million countercyclical program, including an economic stimulus package that encompasses \nthe government\u2019s COVID-19 health, education, and multisector response plans.3 Collectively, \nthese represent the government\u2019s overall pandemic response plan, and the proposed CPRO will \nhelp the government implement it. PNG meets the access criteria of the CPRO (Table 1).4  \n \nTable 1: Summary Assessment of Compliance with the Access Criteria for the \nCountercyclical Support Facility and the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option  \nAccess Criterion  Asian Development Bank Assessment \n1.  Adverse impact  GDP is projected to contract by 2.9% in 2020 in real terms, against 2.1% growth projected \nof exogenous  prior to the pandemic, driven by contractions in construction, accommodation and food \nshocks  services, and transport (main text, para. 8). The 2020 fiscal balance is estimated to worsen \nfrom \u20135% of GDP pre-COVID-19 to \u20138.2% of GDP post-COVID-19. Public sector debt is \nexpected to reach 49.8% of GDP in 2020, compared with 39.8% in 2019. The 2020 current \naccount surplus is projected to decline to 15.9%, from 22.3% in 2019. The pandemic resulted \nin immediate and significant negative impacts on unemployment (31% of household heads \nlost their jobs) and poverty (increase by 4.5 percentage points) (main text, paras. 11\u201312). \n2.  Countercyclical  Countercyclical  development  expenditures  approved  and  prepared  for  2020  total \ndevelopment  $769 million (3.2% of GDP). This includes support for pro-poor countercyclical expenditures \nexpenditures  of $445 million through the budget and $324 million from domestic institutions\u2014in the form \nof support for the health system response; improved social assistance; better hygiene; \nsupport for agricultural development and food security; support for micro, small, and medium-\nsized enterprises; loan repayment holidays; and superannuation withdrawals to mitigate the \nimpacts of COVID-19, especially on vulnerable groups (main text, paras. 14\u201316). \n3.  Pre-shock record  Growth, which averaged 4.2% during 2015\u20132019, was undermined by falling commodity \nof generally  prices, droughts, and an earthquake. Despite the multiple shocks, fiscal policy was generally \nsound  sound, and the deficit averaged 3.9% during 2015\u20132019. The government managed to limit \nmacroeconomic  the fiscal deficit to 2.5% of GDP in 2017 and 2.6% of GDP in 2018 under a fiscal consolidation \nmanagement  strategy. In 2019, as it stepped up capital expenditures to stimulate growth, the deficit \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

Fiscal reform is ongoing and supports revenue-raising measures \nand expenditure control guided by IMF technical assistance under a Medium-Term Revenue \nStrategy (2018\u20132022) and an IMF SMP. The central bank has managed price stability \n(inflation averaged 5.3% during 2015\u20132019) through its exchange rate mechanism and other \nmonetary policy tools. However, the exchange rate mechanism, combined with a policy of \nforeign currency rationing, resulted in foreign exchange shortages, which dampened growth \n(main text, para. 7).  \n4.  Structural  A state of emergency was declared on 23 March 2020, accompanied by the State of \nreforms  Emergency Act 2020. This was replaced by the National Pandemic Act 2020 on 16 June \n(including health  2020. On 17 June 2020, the National Control Centre was set up to manage the response \nresponse)  and  coordinate  national  government  agencies  and  development  partner  support. \nBorders have been closed since 26 March 2020 and remain so, but initial restrictions on \ndomestic movements were relaxed. The Department of Health issued the Emergency \nPreparedness and Response Plan in March 2020, which outlined key actions to respond to \nCOVID-19. The government added beds in intensive care units and isolation facilities, \npurchased  medical  and  personal  protective  equipment,  increased  COVID-19  testing, \nstrengthened contact tracing, and trained frontline health workers (main text, paras. 5 and \n14). Lessons from the pandemic will feed into the preparation of the National Action Plan for \nHealth Security 2021\u20132030, with longer-term public health and preventative measures.  \n5.  Debt  Public sector debt in 2020 is forecast to expand to 49.8% of GDP post-COVID-19, compared \nsustainability  with a 40.3% pre-pandemic projection. The IMF\u2019s DSA prepared in June 2020 puts PNG at \nhigh risk of debt distress, with no access to external market finance. The rating results from \nthe COVID-19-induced breaches of the debt service\u2013revenue ratio. However, debt is still \nassessed as sustainable, conditional on the implementation of sound fiscal policies and SMP \ncommitments. A DSA conducted by ADB shows that the negative consequences of the \npandemic are primarily short-to-medium term, with positive growth resuming as pandemic \neffects subside. ADB\u2019s proposed loan is not expected to add significantly to the debt service \nobligations or affect PNG\u2019s debt sustainability (main text, para. 27). \n6.  Coordination  ADB has been in close communication with the IMF on the CPRO. In June 2020, the IMF \nwith the IMF  disbursed $364 million to PNG under an RCF, noting the need for additional financing \nsupport. The IMF\u2019s RCF report is provided in lieu of an assessment letter. The IMF began an \nSMP in February 2020, and ADB closely coordinated with the IMF on the proposed State-\nOwned Enterprise Reform Program, which is a benchmark in the SMP (main text, para. 24).  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPRO = COVID-19 pandemic response option, \nDSA = debt sustainability analysis, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, PNG = Papua \nNew Guinea, RCF = Rapid Credit Facility, SMP = Staff-Monitored Program. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Resource-rich but inherently vulnerable. PNG is a resource-dependent, lower middle-\nincome country with an estimated population of 9.3 million and per-capita gross national income \nof $2,685 in 2019.5 The mineral sector (mining, petroleum, and natural gas) accounted for 28% \nof gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019, while agriculture, forestry, and fisheries contributed \nanother 17.1%.6 Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) account for about 25% of \nGDP (of the formal economy) and 24% of the labor force.7 MSMEs are mainly engaged in retail \nand service industries and operate in urban and peri-urban settings.

An estimated 48% of children \nborn in PNG are stunted or chronically undernourished (double the rate of countries with a \ncomparable GDP per capita), risking cognitive limitations in a population where a majority of the \nworkforce has completed a maximum of grade ten education.9 These fragilities are reflected in \nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) human development index, which ranks \nPNG 155th out of 189 economies.10 PNG is also prone to disasters caused by natural hazards. \nSince 2016, PNG has experienced droughts, earthquakes, and a volcanic eruption.  \n \n4.  Fragile health system. PNG is making modest progress in improving its health outcomes. \nHowever, its performance is uneven. The maternal mortality ratio declined from 470 deaths per \n100,000 live births in 1990 to 215 deaths in 2015, and was estimated at 171 during 2016\u20132018.11 \nPNG\u2019s human development index rose by 43% between 1990 and 2017 and its ranking remains \nlow (footnote 10). Health facilities are in poor condition and short of medical supplies. The country \ndoes not have enough health workers and is generally unprepared to respond to a pandemic \n(footnote 3). Financial constraints limit the number of outreach clinics, particularly in rural areas. \nOnly 12 of the 22 provinces have pre-triaging areas and isolation facilities; most provincial \nhospitals (16 of 22) have limited capacity in their intensive care units (ICUs)\u2014only 93 ICU beds \nand 12 functioning ventilators for COVID-19 patients are available nationwide; and the quality of \nthese beds and the adequacy of supplies such as personal protective equipment (PPE) are \nunknown. According to the World Health Organization, PNG\u2019s preparedness and response \ncapacity for COVID-19 is at Level 2 (where Level 5 is best).  \n \n5.  Government quick to act on COVID-19. PNG\u2019s first case of COVID-19 was detected on \n20 March 2020. The following day, a state of emergency was declared, which also activated the \nUnited Nations (UN) Humanitarian Cluster system. The government closed the borders from \n26 March 2020, imposed internal travel restrictions, and decreed a national lockdown on 23 \nMarch\u201327 April 2020. On 23 March 2020, the Prime Minister appointed the Police Commissioner \nas \"Emergency Controller,\" which Parliament confirmed in April 2020. Parliament also passed the \nNational Pandemic Act 2020 on 16 June 2020, which outlines the legal powers conferred to the \nController, as well as the reporting obligations and financial management arrangements (including \nthe need for audits) for the medium-term response to the pandemic.12 With this act in place, the \nstate of emergency was lifted. On 17 June 2020, the National Control Centre (NCC) was set up \nto manage the response and coordinate national government agencies and development partner \nsupport,  including  the  implementation  of  the  pandemic response  plan  (para.  2).  A second \nlockdown was imposed on 29 July\u201314 August 2020. The lockdowns meant that most businesses \nand institutions, including schools, were shut for about 7 weeks. This depressed domestic \ndemand and required education to be delivered virtually (para. 15). No domestic flight restrictions \napply at present, but international travelers are admitted subject to strict entry regulations.13 \n \n8  M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders) estimates that up to 70% of women in PNG have experienced \nphysical or sexual assault in their lifetime.

They restrict entry to four PNG \nseaports (Port Moresby, Rabaul, Morobe, Madang) and Port Moresby\u2019s international airport. No person is permitted \nentry unless provided with an exemption by the Controller. A 14-day quarantine period is required upon arrival.   \n ", "4 \n6.  COVID-19 tally. As of 16 November 2020, PNG recorded 602 positive cases of COVID-\n19 and 7 deaths across 13 provinces (out of 22 administrative regions), and had carried out \n29,466 tests.14,15 While the rate of testing has increased since March 2020, testing in the \nprovinces (and the settlement areas of Port Moresby) remains inadequate given that most cases \nare not epidemiologically linked, suggesting widespread community transmission. In mid-July \n2020, PNG recorded a dramatic upsurge in COVID-19 infections, reflecting increased testing.16 \nTesting is carried out through a network of public and private clinics with samples processed \nthrough  two  laboratories  in  Port  Moresby  and  Goroka,  and  overseas.  However,  effective \nsurveillance is limited by the slow processing time and lack of patient identification after the \nresults.  The  ADB-financed  public  health  surveillance  system  (electronic  national  health \ninformation system) is supporting surveillance by tracking COVID-19- associated symptoms, \nincluding pneumonia, and through death reports.  \n \n7.  Pre-shock record of generally sound fiscal management. Growth averaged 4.2% \nbetween 2015\u20132019, but has been volatile because of falling commodity prices, droughts, and an \nearthquake (Table 2). Despite the multiple shocks, fiscal policy was generally sound, and the \ndeficit averaged 3.9% during 2015\u20132019. The government managed to limit the deficit to 2.5% of \nGDP in 2017 and to 2.6% of GDP in 2018 under a fiscal consolidation strategy. Additionally, the \ngovernment adopted fiscal reforms\u2014including revenue-raising measures under a medium-term \nrevenue strategy guided by International Monetary Fund (IMF) technical assistance (TA), and \nmeasures aimed at controlling recurrent expenditure.17 A switch to a more expansionary fiscal \npolicy in 2019 led to a deficit of 4.9% of GDP, largely driven by increased capital expenditure to \nstimulate growth, but also in a context of weaker revenues and a revision to nominal GDP.18 \n \nTable 2: Selected Economic and Fiscal Indicators \nItem  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019e  2020p  2020r \nGDP growth (%, constant prices)  9.5  4.1  3.5  (0.8)  5.0  2.1  (2.9) \nInflation (CPI period average)  6.0  6.7  5.4  4.7  3.6  3.8  3.3 \nTotal revenue and grants (% of GDP), of  18.3  16.1  15.9  17.8  16.2  15.3  14.0 \nwhich \n    Domestic revenue (% of GDP)  16.9  13.9  13.9  15.5  14.1  14.3  12.8 \nTotal expenditure (% of GDP), of which  22.9  20.9  18.4  20.4  21.1  20.3  22.2 \n   Recurrent expenditure (% of GDP)  14.0  14.0  14.0  14.5  13.9  13.5  14.3 \nFiscal surplus (deficit) (% of GDP)  (4.6)  (4.7)  (2.5)  (2.6)  (4.9)  (5.0)  (8.2) \nGross public debt (% of GDP), of which  29.9  33.7  32.7  38.3  39.8  40.3  49.8 \n    Gross external public debt (% of GDP)  6.7  8.5  8.8  15.2  17.0  18.5  23.6 \nGross official foreign reserves ($ million)  1,738.0  1,656.1  1,735.6  2,214.8  2,312.8  2,431.6  2,281.7 \n     In months of imports  10.0  6.4  5.1  6.7  5.4  6.2  5.8 \nCurrent account balance (% of GDP)  20.2  25.0  23.5  23.0  22.3  22.3  15.9 \n( ) = negative, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPI = consumer price index, e = estimated, GDP = gross domestic \nproduct, p = projected (pre-COVID-19), r = revised projection (post-COVID-19). \nSource: International Monetary Fund, Article IV Reports. \n8.

Without this \nrevaluation, the fiscal deficit would have been \u20134.7% (compared with \u20134.9% actual) and the debt stock would have \nbeen 38.2% (compared with 39.8% actual). \n ", "5 \nto a contraction of 2.9% in 2020. Export revenues fell as global commodity prices weakened along \nwith weaker external demand, and declines in mining production also contributed to lower exports. \nLockdowns and restrictions on international and domestic travel hurt several industries: transport, \naccommodation and food services, real estate, manufacturing, and construction. Cognizant that \nadverse business conditions and lower economic activity are anticipated to continue into 2021 \nbecause of the continued spread of COVID-19 and ongoing depressed regional demand, the \ngovernment is formulating the 2021 national budget with support from development partners in \nan effort to continue critical pandemic response plan measures and identify opportunities for re-\nenergizing productive economic sectors outside the extractive industries, such as infrastructure \n(para. 21). In response to this uncertainty, the government indicated that several critical elements \nof the pandemic response plan were likely to continue and be reflected in the 2021 budget.  \n \n9.  Fiscal impact of COVID-19. The fiscal deficit is projected to expand to 8.2% of GDP, from \n5.0% of GDP before the pandemic. This reflects an estimated fall in revenues of 19.4% and a net \nexpenditure  cut  of  3.9%  in  2020  when  compared  to  projections  before  the  pandemic. \nThe  government  reduced  its  revenue  projection  from  15.3%  of  GDP  to  14.0%  of  GDP. \nThe supplementary budget announced expenditure cuts totaling K2.3 billion from the 2020 \nbudget, and directed K1.6 billion to fund COVID-19-related and other expenditures.19  \n \n10.  COVID-19 impact on finance sector. The impact on the finance sector is expected to be \nlimited. Nonperforming loans, which were 4.0% of total loans prior to the pandemic, including \nthose of MSMEs, are expected to increase moderately. Commercial banks are profitable and well \ncapitalized, and are expected to be able to absorb credit losses.20 Nonbank financial institutions \ntypically lend only against collateral, such as movable assets, and have limited exposure to the \nhigh-risk market segment of MSMEs. While liquidity was sufficient prior to COVID-19, the Bank \nof  Papua  New  Guinea  (BPNG)  has  subsequently  provided  additional  liquidity  through  a \nquantitative easing program and continues to monitor this closely. \n \n11.  Socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19. Poverty models suggest that the poverty rate \nwas about 27.2% before the pandemic; based on a 10% decline in mean per capita consumption, \nthe poverty rate could jump to 31.7% in 2020.21 As of June 2020, up to 31% of household heads \nwere reported to have lost their jobs (footnote 7). The most vulnerable are those without any \nalternative sources of income, such as low-income earners and subsistence workers. Of these \nvulnerable people, 79% are employed and 48% are women.22 Disruption in the food supply chain \nand surges in food prices particularly threaten the 26.5% of the population below the national food \npoverty line (with an incidence of 28.5% in rural areas).23 Protracted impacts on employment \nindicate a longer period of recovery, which could exacerbate pre-existing challenges of stunting, \nwasting, and malnutrition (para. 3). With limited social insurance programs in the country, \nvulnerable  groups  such  as  poor  households,  older  people,  people  with  disabilities,  and \nhouseholds headed by women are at risk of slipping into poverty. Of these vulnerable people, \n80% currently have no income or only limited ability to generate income, and 67% do not have \naccess to basic services such as water and sanitation, health clinics, and primary schools. \n \n19 The supplementary budget showed a net reduction in recurrent expenditure of K0.8 billion, and a net increase in \ncapital expenditure of K0.1 billion. \n20 Commercial banks reported a combined ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 34.9% as of June 2019. \n21 J. Bulan et al. 2020. COVID-19 and Poverty: Some Scenarios. Unpublished note prepared for ADB\u2019s Economic \nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department. The poverty rate, based on a poverty line of $1.90 per day, was \nlast recorded at 39.9% (2009).

Women and girls particularly vulnerable. In addition to the risk of COVID-19 infection, \nadditional health impacts on women and girls include the diversion of resources from other \nessential services such as maternal and reproductive health care. The UN Population Fund \nresearch highlights that GBV is increasing and that the state of emergency severely curtailed \nwomen and girls\u2019 ability to access GBV services.24 The COVID-19 pandemic is also undermining \nwomen\u2019s economic security. Women are more vulnerable to economic hardships given their \nreliance on informal work (60% of informal entrepreneurs are women). Even before the state of \nemergency, women's workforce participation was lower than men's\u2014men were almost twice as \nlikely as women to have wage jobs in the formal sector. The Women\u2019s Microbank is experiencing \n95% customer default on either single or multiple loan repayments as many of their women \nentrepreneur clients feel the impacts of COVID-19. While the data is not disaggregated by sex, a \nUN survey of MSMEs found that 37% have temporarily ceased operations and a further 25% have \nreduced staff or wages (footnote 7). The same research indicates that the income of 80% of \nhouseholds has been negatively affected, with debt increasing by up to 42%.  \n \nB.  The Government\u2019s COVID-19 Countercyclical Responses \n \n13.  Strong countercyclical expenditure plan. The government\u2019s pandemic response plan \n(para. 2) totals $769 million (3.2% of GDP). The plan (Table 3) comprises multiple measures \n(paras. 14\u201316) to improve core health sector capacities, respond adequately to the pandemic, \nminimize the impacts on vulnerable groups, and provide economic stimulus to boost aggregate \ndemand and help the economy through the recovery.  \n \nTable 3: Pandemic Response Plan, 2020 \n($ million) \nBudget  Domestic \nDonor- Institutions' \nItem  Total  Government  Fundeda  Support \nHealth and safety   166  90  76  0 \nHealth system strengthening   92  33  59   \nWater, sanitation, and hygiene  35  18  17   \nSafety  39  39     \nSocial assistance, food security, and \nprotection of vulnerable groups   213  35  31  147 \nSocial protection (e.g., against GBV)  6    6   \nFood security and nutrition   38  35  3   \nEducation  22    22   \nSuperannuation / unemployment   147      147 \nMSMEs and other economic support  390  208  5  177 \nMSMEs and agriculture  66  61  5   \nMSME lending through commercial banks  59  59     \nInfrastructure stimulus  88  88     \nLoan repayment holidays  177      177 \nTotal  769  333  112  324 \nGBV = gender-based violence; MSMEs = micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.  \na  Development partners\u2019 support though the multisector response plan.

Following confirmation of the first COVID-19 case in \nMarch 2020, the government, with development partner support, is expending $92 million on \nhealth system strengthening, delivering (i) 400 non-ICU beds in temporary isolation facilities for \nCOVID-19 patients across the country, (ii) clinical guidelines on how to manage COVID-19 \npatients  and  training  in  COVID-19  case  management  for  about  4,836  health  workers, \n(iii) a community education campaign and establishment of logistic arrangements, and (iv) rapid \nprocurement of test kits and PPE to support national testing capacity.25 To improve access to \nwater, sanitation, and hygiene, the government and development partners are implementing \nactions to provide water supply to communities, schools, and health care facilities ($35 million). \nTo protect the people, the government set up the NCC to coordinate its pandemic response, and \nis strengthening quarantine facilities, border protection, and policing ($39 million). Lessons \nlearned during the pandemic will feed into the preparation of long-term activities to be designed \nand presented in the National Action Plan for Health Security 2021\u20132030 (footnote 3). \n \n15.  Social  assistance,  food  security,  and  protection  of  vulnerable  groups \n($213 million).26 The government\u2019s social assistance and food security programs targeted poor \nand  vulnerable  groups  at  risk  of  being  further  marginalized  because  of  COVID-19. \nThe government, with development partners, is expending $38 million on nationwide food security \nactivities, including distribution of food rations during April\u2013December 2020. The main recipients \nare those affected by income and job losses, especially in urban areas where they have fewer \nmeans to grow their own food; 5,000 individuals in the National Capital District (NCD) are \nestimated to have received food rations to date. Implementation is channeled through churches \nand local administration bodies to ensure correctly targeted and timely distribution of relief. \nThis scheme draws on the databases of nongovernment organizations involved in volunteer and \nhumanitarian work in the NCD. In addition, an estimated 10,000 smallholder farmers and poor \nrural households are receiving support to purchase seedlings or home gardening kits, or to \nmanage threats to plant and animal health. The aim is to help them sustain their crop and livestock \nproduction for household consumption and/or market sale, and thus prevent income losses from \nCOVID-19-induced disruptions to economic activities. A rapid assessment revealed that most \nschools find it difficult to deliver remote teaching. In response, the government, with development \npartner  support,  is  spending  $22  million  on  broadcasting  educational  television  and  radio \nprograms nationwide three times a week for secondary students, and daily radio programs for \nprimary  students.  This  benefits  more  than  370,000  children,  including  168,000  girls,  and \nminimizes learning disruptions. The humanitarian cluster system has been activated (para. 5), \nincluding the protection cluster. The government and development partners are implementing \n$6 million worth of initiatives, e.g., through the GBV and child protection subclusters, to ensure \nthe safety and protection of women, children, older people, and people with disabilities across the \ncountry. Women and community groups were encouraged to produce face masks as a source of \nimmediate income. At least 200,000 locally made masks were procured by the government and \nare being distributed around the NCD. At least 14,000 superannuation fund members working \nmostly  in  the  formal  sector  (about  38%  of  them  women)  will  get  early  access  to  their \nsuperannuation equivalent to 20% of their own contributions to date, or a maximum of K10,000, \nfor immediate cash assistance. This is estimated to total $147 million, or less than 5% of overall \nassets held by the superannuation funds, so is not considered to impact the funds' sustainability. \n \n \n25 An amount of $57,000 was disbursed to each province in June 2020 to support local COVID-19 activities and procure \nsupplies. The PPE procurement follows the same advance procurement arrangements supported by the UN Office \nfor Project Services (UNOPS) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) as does the World Bank\u2019s \n$19.38 million COVID-19 Emergency Response Project (P173834). \n26 Summary of Social Assistance Measures (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n16.  MSMEs and other economic support ($390 million). The government took several \nmeasures to safeguard small businesses and rural producers, and improve the hygiene in \nmarkets and business centers to allow trading to continue, especially for informal traders and \nsmall vendors. This includes $66 million to support the prices for coffee, cocoa, and copra farmers \nand stabilize their income, and a market improvements program for producers. Smallholder \nproducers receive logistics and transportation support, including aggregation of products to urban \nhubs and main commercial markets. To date, 14 shipments took place from Lae to Port Moresby, \neach containing 10,000 bags of produce or 912 dry and refrigerated containers. Lending to \nMSMEs is also being supported with a $59 million credit guarantee program delivered through \nBank South Pacific (about 65% market share) and National Development Bank (about 2.2% \nmarket share). This will enable MSMEs to retain their workers. The lending support comes with \nbusiness training to build the resilience of small businesses to withstand the COVID-19 impacts. \nThe package includes $11 million for agriculture-related businesses; $7 million for youth, women, \nand micro businesses; and a further $2.2 million exclusively for women-run businesses. Interest \nrates range between 4%\u20135% with a term of 15\u201320 years. The government allocated $88 million \nto support short-term employment through capital works in the education, health, judiciary, \ntransport, and other infrastructure sectors. Finally, in April 2020, PNG\u2019s financial institutions began \ngranting loan repayment holidays for 3 months or longer, estimated to cost $177 million. Laid-off \nworkers and businesses impacted by COVID-19 are eligible for this support.  \n \n17.  Monetary policy response. The BPNG launched a 3-month quantitative easing program \nin April 2020, which injected K643 million into the financial system. As a further policy measure to \nsupport liquidity, it reduced the cash reserve ratio of commercial banks from 10% to 7%. It also \nreduced its policy rate, the kina facility rate, from 5% to 3%, and commercial banks responded by \nreducing lending rates. \n \nC.  Proposed  Program,  Impact,  ADB\u2019s  Value  Addition,  and  Development  Partner \nCoordination \n  \n18.  ADB\u2019s program will support the government in containing the pandemic and cushion its \nsocial and economic impact, particularly on the poor and vulnerable. It is aligned with PNG's \noverarching development objective of mitigating the health, social, and economic impact of the \noutbreak (footnote 3). The outcome will be: adverse effects of COVID-19 on businesses and the \npopulation reduced. The program has three outputs: (i) COVID-19 health response measures \nimplemented,  (ii)  measures  to  protect  and  provide  social  assistance  and  food  security  to \nvulnerable  groups  enhanced,  and  (iii)  MSMEs  safeguarded  from  the  economic  downturn. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n19.  Lessons learned. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the country's fragilities and \nrequired the use and strengthening of existing systems to meet the needs of the people. Policy \ndialogue and experiences from other CPROs have shown that support to areas where ADB is not \ntraditionally  involved,  such  as  social  protection,  requires  longer  and  more  substantive \nengagement with the government. While ADB\u2019s ability to influence the design of social protection \ninitiatives is limited, the CPRO provides a basis for greater ADB engagement and the opportunity \nto improve these areas through future projects and/or TA. COVID-19 presented time-sensitive \nchallenges  in  procurement  and  logistics  to  which  national  agencies  were  not  previously \naccustomed. Contracting the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) to procure and import \nmedical supplies through both the government and development partners has worked well. The \ndesign of the proposed CPRO incorporates these lessons and reflects evaluation findings from \n ", "9 \nprevious disaster responses, such as that to the 2018 earthquake, its coordination with the cluster \nsystem, and the use of both government and partner systems to respond most effectively.27 \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s value addition. This CPRO is part of a wider package of assistance to meet short-\nterm response requirements\u2014it supports the stabilization of the fiscal situation and contributes to \nrecovery efforts. It is complemented by TA funds ($1.6 million) to directly procure health supplies, \nAsia Pacific Disaster Response Fund assistance ($3 million) to further contribute to the health \nresponse, and a proposed policy-based operation focused on public financial management (PFM) \nreforms in the health sector (an additional $50 million added to the originally planned $100 \nmillion).28 This operation has supported the government in achieving critical actions underlying \ntheir health sector response plan (para. 3).29 In concert with other development partners, ADB \ncontributed  to  policy  discussions  on  the  economic  response  and  the  development  of  the \nsupplementary budget, especially on managing higher debt levels.30 ADB also supported a public \nhealth surveillance system, and PFM regulatory reforms at the Department of Health's subnational \nagencies and four provincial health authorities (footnote 28). ADB will embed consultants in the \nDepartment  of  Treasury  (DOT)  to  support  monitoring  and  reporting  of  the  program\u2019s \nimplementation, and the development of a revised medium-term fiscal strategy that provides a \npath toward longer-term fiscal sustainability. ADB will also mobilize regional TA in support of \nsocial assistance and gender equality to help monitor these aspects of the CPRO, build the \ncapacity of line agencies for social policy development, help them strengthen their systems to \ndeliver social protection, and supplement their efforts to report on the effectiveness of these \ninitiatives,  particularly  for  women  and  girls.31 This  work  will  also  inform  any  future  ADB \ninterventions. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s support for recovery. ADB expects to provide further budget support through the \nHealth Services Sector Development Program ($150 million in 2020) and the State-Owned \nEnterprises Reform Program ($100 million in 2020, $150 million in 2021, $250 million in 2022). \nThese  policy-based  operations  provide  financial  resources  to  help  meet  PNG's  short-term \nfinancing needs while supporting policy reforms that promote longer-term growth and poverty \nreduction. To assist the country\u2019s medium-term economic recovery, ADB has planned significant \ninvestments in infrastructure to support road transport, maritime links, and domestic and air \ntransportation. Quality  infrastructure  is  a  central  component  of the  government\u2019s  economic \nrecovery strategy. This pipeline of programs and projects complements the CPRO by building on \nthe government\u2019s desire for macroeconomic stability, fiscal sustainability, and greater economic \ngrowth, including beyond the extractive industries. \n \n22.  Alignment with Strategy 2030 and country partnership strategy. The CPRO is aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, particularly the operational priorities of addressing remaining poverty \nand reducing inequalities, promoting rural development and food security, accelerating progress \nin gender equality, and strengthening governance and institutional capacity.32 The program\u2019s \ndesign reflects Strategy 2030\u2019s approach to fragile and conflict-affected situations and small \n \n27 Australian Humanitarian Partnership. 2019.

Development  partner  coordination.  The  support  of  development  partners  for  the \ngovernment\u2019s COVID-19 response is well coordinated through the NCC and the UN Disaster \nManagement Team.34 The NCC is at the center of the response,  while the UN leads the \ncoordination with the development partners. Several UN agencies also directly support the relief \nefforts.35 The UN Disaster Management Team, of which ADB is a member, is the primary vehicle \nfor the UN to align the efforts of development partners, keep the partners abreast of developments, \nand advocate for more financing to meet pressing needs as described in the COVID-19 Multi-\nSector Response Plan (footnote 3).  \n \n24.  ADB maintains a regular dialogue with the IMF on assessments of PNG's macroeconomic \nand fiscal situation. When the IMF prepared its Rapid Credit Facility and reviewed its Staff-\nMonitored Program, it sought ADB\u2019s views on the economic outlook in the context of ADB\u2019s budget \nsupport in 2020, the proposed State-Owned Enterprise Reform Program, which is a benchmark \nin the Staff-Monitored Program, and forward pipeline.36 ADB also sought the IMF\u2019s views on the \nCPRO access criteria.37 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs, Budget Support, and Debt Sustainability  \n \n25.  The budget deficit of 8.2% in 2020 is equivalent to a financing need of $1.95 billion. \nThis is $558 million more than the pre-pandemic need. The deficit will be financed through a mix \nof domestic ($566 million) and external ($1,246 million) sources, with a further drawdown on the \ncash balance of $138 million with the BPNG, which indicates an overall financing shortfall. \nExternal borrowing will be entirely financed by multilateral and bilateral partners (Table 4). \n \nTable 4: Urgent Financing Needs and Support for 2020  \n($ million) \nItem  2020 (before COVID-19)  2020 (adjusted for COVID-19) \nRevenues                4,146                     3,341  \nGrants (COVID-19 related)a   0  112 \nExpenditure                5,508                   4,958  \nCOVID-19 pandemic response plan expenditurea   0  445 \nBudget balance              (1,362)                  (1,950) \nTotal budget financing needed:                1,362                     1,950  \n    Net domestic borrowing                 370                         566  \n    Drawdown from cash balance                       0                           131  \n    Net external borrowing:                  992                     1,253  \n             Commercialb  300                     0 \n         International Monetary Fund                       0                           364  \n \n33 ADB. 2015.

The government\u2019s development policy letter is in Appendix 3. \n \n27.  Debt sustainability. Despite the IMF classifying PNG at high risk of debt distress, debt \nsustainability analyses conducted by ADB and the IMF have shown that the consequences of the \npandemic would primarily be short-to-medium term.38 In the longer term, as PNG\u2019s major resource \nprojects generate higher growth, the economic effects of the pandemic would gradually dissipate. \nPlanned lending from development partners would lift public debt to 49.8% of GDP in 2020 and \nto 52.6% in 2023, before a downward trajectory resumes. The breaches of debt service limits are \neither one-off or short-lived. The longer-term sustainability of PNG\u2019s external and public debt is \npreserved. Debt management is guided by a medium-term debt strategy that seeks to make use \nof low-cost external financing. ADB provides TA support in debt management (footnote 30). ADB\u2019s \nproposed loan, which represents 2.5% of PNG\u2019s outstanding public debt stock, is not considered \nto add significantly to the debt service obligations of the government or affect debt sustainability. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n28.  DOT will be the executing agency. The implementing agencies are the departments of \nhealth,  education,  community  development  and  religion,  agriculture  and  livestock,  national \nplanning and monitoring, and commerce and industries. DOT will monitor budget execution and \nthe flow of funds for countercyclical measures, and submit a report to ADB by the end of May \n2021. ADB will commit TA resources (para. 20) to monitor program implementation which will be \naligned to the government\u2019s monitoring arrangements (para. 5). The program implementation \nperiod is February 2020 to June 2021. The proceeds of the loan will be withdrawn in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n29.  Governance. The most recent public expenditure and financial accountability assessment \nwas in 2015.39 PNG scored relatively well on credibility of the fiscal strategy and budget, policy-\nbased planning and budgeting, and comprehensiveness and transparency. However, it has scope \nfor improvement in accountability; management of public assets, liabilities and associated fiscal \nrisks; and timeliness of fiscal accounts. ADB and development partners are supporting the \ngovernment\u2019s improvements in  PFM. The current administration set up several institutional \narrangements to ensure that COVID-19 funds are expended as intended. This includes the \n \n38 Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 IMF. 2015. Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment. Washington, DC. \n ", "12 \nPandemic Act (para. 5), financial instructions that prescribe how COVID-19 funds are to be \ndisbursed, and the reporting required. Despite PNG ranking 137th out of 179 economies in \ncorruption perception, improving governance is a priority, as evidenced by the Whistleblowers Act \n2020, which protects civil servants who report maladministration or misconduct from retaliation.40 \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was discussed with the government. \n \n30.  Poverty.  Poverty  has  increased  with  COVID-19  (para.  11).  The  impacts  on  the \nemployment of heads of households are severe, and temporary relief such as cash support from \nsuperannuation  funds  will  prevent  households  from  falling  into,  or  deeper  into,  poverty. \nFood supplies are an essential immediate response for those at high risk of reduced food intake, \nespecially affected informal workers in urban areas. Most poor households are in rural areas \ndominated by subsistence and cash crop production; hence, agriculture support through price \nsubsidies, payment of freight costs for transporting produce and distributing planting materials \nand livestock will help maintain food and cash crop production, a source of food security and \nincome for small-scale producers. The government\u2019s assistance to MSMEs and informal traders \nthrough market improvements, small business training, provision of loans, and loan repayment \nholidays will prevent enterprises from going out of business or having to dismiss workers.   \n \n31.  Gender.  The  program  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.41 It  includes \nproactive actions across all three output areas to support women\u2019s health, safety, and economic \nempowerment. To protect women\u2019s health, the National Guidelines on Clinical Management of \nCOVID-19 Cases include gender actions such as provisions for pregnant women, continued \nantenatal care and prioritizing GBV risk assessments, training for frontline health workers (most \nare women) on the clinical management of COVID-19 (which has been provided), and ringfenced \nbudget for maternal health care services. The GBV subcluster continues to be activated and \nmeets regularly; agreements are in place to ensure that GBV services across PNG are considered \n\"essential services\" and can operate during lockdowns; and the government approved a code of \nconduct preventing sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers. To support women\u2019s \neconomic  empowerment,  the  government\u2019s  package  to  support  MSMEs  will  target  women \nentrepreneurs through low-interest financial products, market improvements, training, and loan \nrepayment holidays. In addition, women and women\u2019s groups in the NCD are producing face \nmasks as an additional income-generating opportunity; 200,000 masks were procured by the \ngovernment to be distributed to communities around the NCD. \n \n32.  Safeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nwas  screened  and  classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples.42 Additional due diligence confirmed that the program\u2019s component with the \ngreatest risk\u2014comprising a guarantee arrangement for lending to MSMEs\u2014will not result in any \nadverse environmental impacts.43 The banks will apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list \nin their lending to MSMEs. The program is not expected to have any significant environmental or \nsocial safeguards impacts as per the provisions in the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n   \n33.  Risks and mitigating measures.

Adverse  GDP is projected to contract by 2.9% in 2020 in real terms, against 2.1% growth projected \nImpact of  prior to the pandemic. Revenue is projected to fall by $800 million or 3.4% of GDP, from \nExogenous  the pre-COVID-19 target or to fall by 2.9% of GDP compared to 2019. The 2020 fiscal \nShocks  balance is estimated to worsen from \u20135% of GDP pre-COVID-19 to \u20138.2% of GDP post-\nCOVID. The current account surplus is projected to reduce to 15.9% from 22.3% pre-\nCOVID-19.  \nThe economy has been increasingly battered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The authorities \nhave managed to contain the spread of COVID-19, to some extent, by imposing lockdowns, \nbut these measures have depressed economic activity. Further, combined with falling \nexport revenue as global commodity prices weaken along with external demand, and with \nthe closure of Porgera gold mine, lockdowns have significantly undermined the fiscal \nposition of the government. Recovery in 2021 is expected to be weak. \nSeveral industries have been hampered by partial business closures as a result of \nlockdowns  and  restrictions  on  international  and  domestic  travel:  transportation, \naccommodation  and  food  services,  real  estate,  manufacturing,  and  construction. \nAgriculture and forestry have also been constrained by disruption to transportation and \ntrade,  notably  by  quarantine  requirements  on  shipments,  which  have  lengthened \nturnaround  times.  Domestic  demand  and  household  spending  have  weakened  with \ncurtailed business activity and associated cost-cutting measures, most notably layoffs and \nreduced work hours and salaries.  \nThe production and export of liquefied natural gas are not expected to be significantly \naffected by COVID-19, but mining and quarrying have been hit by the recent suspension of \noperations at the Ok Tedi gold and copper mine following a local outbreak of COVID-19. \nBeyond the Ok Tedi suspension, mining and quarrying output overall is seen to contract by \n15% or more in 2020, largely reflecting closure of Porgera, following the government\u2019s \ndecision not to renew the operator\u2019s license, and by disappointing output from the Lihir gold \nmine. \nThe forecast for inflation in 2020 is unchanged from before the pandemic, at 3.3%, as prices \ntrack persistently weak economic activity. Recent economic developments have applied \nboth downward and upward pressure on inflation. Downward pressures include a lower oil \nprice, weaker domestic demand, and government interventions to mitigate the effect of \nCOVID-19, including price regulations on selected consumer goods and a freight subsidy \nintroduced to support shipments of local produce to the capital and ill-served offshore \nislands. Upward pressures include the reduced supply of goods under restrictions intended \nto contain COVID-19 and local currency depreciation. A lesser but still noteworthy upward \npressure is accelerated increase in the money supply fueled by a quantitative easing \nprogram introduced by the BPNG, the central bank. \nThe current account surplus is seen to fall to 15.9% of GDP with lower commodity prices, \nweaker external demand for exports, and disruption caused by transportation bottlenecks. \nThe gold price has increased, but its positive effect will be more than offset by lost gold \nproduction from key mines. Imports have similarly slowed as businesses have become \ncautious  and  restrictions  have  reduced  trade.  Foreign  exchange  reserves  stood  at \n$2.1 billion at the end of March 2020, providing cover for 5.1 months of imports. The \nreduction in the prices for hydrocarbons impacts PNG through the reduction in tax revenue \nand dividends to the state, and reduced foreign exchange transfers to the government \nbecause resource companies remit tax in US$. \nGovernment revenue is expected to deteriorate significantly, with the authorities forecasting \nthat revenue in 2020 will fall to the equivalent of 3.4% of GDP, below earlier expectations. \nMeanwhile, additional expenditure is needed to implement the government\u2019s response to \nthe COVID-19 emergency.  \n ", "  Appendix 4  25 \nAccess Criterion  Asian Development Bank Assessment \nThe shortfall will be funded in part through increased financing from development partners, \nand the government initiated a supplementary budget to cut expenditure on other budget \nitems. PNG\u2019s net borrowing for 2020 is projected to increase from 5% to 8.2% due to the \nreduction in revenue and expenditure re-appropriations for 2020. This will increase the \ngross domestic borrowing from a target of 40.3% to 49.8%. \nThe pandemic has also had a significant social and economic impact, with an increase in \npoverty, unemployment and violence against women and children. \n2.  Countercyclical  The  government,  development  partners  and  domestic  institutions  have  prepared \nDevelopment  $769 million of countercyclical support or 3.2% of GDP (table 3). This includes $166 million \nExpenditures  for health and safety, $213 million for social assistance, food security and protection to \nvulnerable groups, and $390 million for MSMEs and other economic support. From the total \nsupport of $769 million, $444 million is directed through the budget, of which $332 million \nis government funded and $112 million is development partner  financial assistance. \nThe additional $324 million of support is from domestic institutions, including for loan \nrepayment  holidays,  though  commercial  banks,  and  support  for  superannuation \nwithdrawals. \nThe government funded portion of $332 million (K1.1 billion) is composed of (i) K645 million \nannounced stimulus package, (ii) additional infrastructure stimulus of K305 million within \nthe supplementary budget, and (iii) K200 million of support for MSMEs through commercial \nbanks. By midyear, the government has already released  75% of the expenditures \nannounced form the K645 package, including for water, sanitation and hygiene programs \nfor districts (K60.0 million), medical drug and PPE procurement in the Health Sector \n(K67.0 million), Reinforcing security and defense border posts (K113.0 million), citizens \nrepatriation program (K15.0 million), food distribution programs through Churches and City \nAuthorities (K5.0 million), agriculture market development for Provinces and Districts \n(K111.0 million), and logistics support for MSME\u2019s and households (K44.5 million). \nIn the face of falling revenues of 3.4% of GDP, the government has announced the retention \nof  the  full  capital  works  budget  for  2020.  Overall  share  of  development  or  capital \nexpenditure as share of total expenditure has been increased by 3%. With budget cuts of \n100% directed towards non-productive operational expenditure for 2020, the government \nhas attempted, with the supplementary budget, to maintain a fiscal expansionary stance to \nstimulate the economy within its limited fiscal space. \nIn May 2020, the government requested and received $363.3 million from the IMF under \nthe RCF made available to fund COVID-19 expenditures. The loan proceeds financed the \ninitial emergency response in health, helped to shore up foreign exchange reserves and \nexecute  a  re-prioritized  capital  and  operational  budget  of  the  government,  where \nemergency expenditures in health and security were brought forward. The government has \ncommitted to post details of all procurement awarded under a National State of Emergency \nwithin  1  week,  present  weekly  reports  of  COVID-19  expenditures  in  the  Budget \nManagement Committee, and submit a consolidated report to the National Executive \nCouncil published within 3 months of the end of the emergency period. \n3.  Pre-shock  Growth averaged 4.2% between 2015\u20132019, and 0.9% in the non-mineral economy, despite \nRecord of  being impacted by multiple shocks\u2014falling commodity prices, drought, and an earthquake.  \nGenerally \nIn this very challenging context, fiscal policy has generally been sound, with the deficit \nSound \naveraging 3.9% over 2015\u20132019. The deficit was limited to 2.5% of GDP in 2017 and 2.6% \nMacroeconomic \nof GDP in 2018, before a switch to a more expansionary fiscal policy in 2019, with a deficit \nManagement \nof 4.9% of GDP, largely driven by increased capital expenditure, to stimulate growth of the \neconomy; although, the deficit was also impacted by falling revenues associated with weak \ngrowth (revenues excluding grants fell to 14.1% of GDP in 2019 from 15.5% in 2018), and \nto a lesser extent revisions in nominal GDP. Additionally, the government has worked to \nimplement fiscal reform measures, including revenue raising measures under a Medium-\nTerm Revenue Strategy (2018\u20132022), guided by IMF technical assistance, and measures \naimed at controlling recurrent expenditure under a Medium Term Fiscal Strategy (2018\u2013\n2022), although progress has been slower than hoped for. An IMF SMP commenced in \nFebruary 2020, following a request from the Government to the IMF to oversee its reform \nagenda.  \n ", "26  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criterion  Asian Development Bank Assessment \nInflation averaged 5.3% during 2015\u20132019 and 5.0% during 2010\u20132014. Key drivers of \ninflation were exchange rate movements, commodity price fluctuations, and demand pull \nassociated with a large foreign direct investment, PNG LNG, a $19 billion liquified natural \ngas plant constructed during 2010-2014. Inflation may also have been impacted by a \nprogram of purchasing government debt by the BPNG during 2014\u20132017; however, this was \nterminated and wound down from 2018 (BPNG holdings of Government debt increased from \nK766 million in December 2013, to K2.0 billion in December 2014, and to K3.9 billion in \nDecember 2016, and were steadily reduced thereafter, falling to K1.9 billion as of March \n2020).  \nThe Kina Facility Rate is the BPNG\u2019s policy rate; it was held at 6.25% during 2015\u2013July \n2019, above the rate of inflation; however, its effectiveness has been limited, as evidenced \nby its weak transmission to lending rates, which remain primarily determined by credit risk \nappetite, and to deposit rates, which remain low as a result of ample system liquidity. \nThe exchange rate mechanism has also limited the effectiveness of the Kina Facility Rate. \nKey factors that influence PNG\u2019s exchange rate are commodity price fluctuations and capital \nflows associated with foreign direct investment. The kina appreciated against the US dollar \nby 34.8% between June 2010 and June 2012, during a period of rising gold prices and large \ninflows of foreign currency associated with the construction phase of PNG LNG; central bank \nforeign exchange reserves grew to over $4 billion in 2012, compared to $2 billion in 2007. \nHowever, this trend reversed in 2013 as PNG LNG construction ended and as commodity \nprices began to slide. This put significant downward pressure on the kina, which depreciated \nby 26.3% between June 2013 and June 2014, as well as on international currency reserves, \nwhich reduced to $2.6 billion in July 2014. The central bank intervened to stem the pace of \ndepreciation and loss of reserves by introducing in June 2014 a trading band and a policy of \nrationing foreign exchange. These interventions prevented the exchange rate and currency \ntrading from adjusting to market conditions, finally appearing as shortages of foreign \nexchange. A recent assessment by the IMF indicates that the currency remains overvalued \nby 12% to 18%. This is evidenced by a reported backlog of foreign currency orders (i.e., \ndemand for foreign currency) with commercial banks, estimated at around $0.5 billion. This \nhas impeded growth and inhibited investment. In this context, the IMF SMP recommends \nthat PNG gradually devalue its currency, which could be achieved with a real depreciation \nof 3% to 5% per annum over a period of 3 years, and to complement this with seeking \ntechnical assistance for an appropriate exchange rate policy. During 2020, exchange rate \ndepreciation picked up after the commencement of the IMF SMP (the kina depreciated by \n2.6% versus the US dollar, between January and September 2020). In addition, the IMF \nSMP recommends that an amount of at least $60 million per month be released from \nreserves under the SMP, and the BPNG is broadly on track with this, having released \n$330  million as of July 2020, against an annual target under the IMF SMP of $720 million.  \n4.  Structural  The Department of Health released an Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan on \nReforms  2 March 2020, outlining a framework for key actions needed to prepare and respond to \n(including  COVID-19. On 23 March 2020, a state of emergency was declared, which resulted in a \nHealth  lockdown of the economy and restrictions on movements of people. An Emergency Act \nResponse)  2020 was passed on 24 March 2020, which was retroactively applied from 13 March, \nempowering authorities to respond. The Police Commissioner was appointed as the \n\u2018Emergency Controller\u2019 by the Prime Minister. The borders were closed from 26 March and \nthe first lockdown was from 23 March to 1 April. A second lockdown was from 29 July to \n14 August. The Emergency Act was superseded by the National Pandemic Act 2020, which \nwas passed on 16 June 2020. The National Pandemic Act outlined the legal powers \nconferred to the Controller, including the imposition of border and quarantine controls, and \nfinancial management arrangements for the medium-term response to the pandemic. \nOn 17 June 2020, a NCC was established to manage the response and coordinate national \ngovernment agencies and development partner support. The NCC is led by the Controller, \nand through the whole-of-government NCC governance structure, it is currently monitoring \nand enforcing 11 Pandemic Measures including governing of international and domestic \ntravel,  provincial  coordination,  burial  of  deceased  persons,  customs  duties,  testing, \nsurveillance,  businesses  and  social  events,  health  protocols,  and  public  transport \nrestrictions in the capital. At present, physical borders are closed but land and sea borders \nremain porous. The only formal points of entry are Port Moresby\u2019s airport for travellers, and \nthe seaports of Port Moresby, Lae, Madang and Rabaul for cargo.  \n ", "  Appendix 4  27 \nAccess Criterion  Asian Development Bank Assessment \n \nThe government has initiated a countercyclical economic package to be implemented by \nvarious agencies to support the economy and the vulnerable through support for MSMES, \nfood donation, freight subsidy scheme and superannuation support to those who have lost \ntheir jobs due to COVID-19 among others. \n5.  Debt  The drastic economic and financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have deteriorated \nSustainability  PNG\u2019s growth prospects. The government\u2019s limited capacity to generate sufficient revenues \nto fund its mounting expenditures in the face of the pandemic has widened the fiscal deficits \nwhich must then be covered by borrowing. The current deteriorating fiscal deficits will raise \nPNG\u2019s public debt ratio to nearly 50% of GDP in 2020, well beyond the government\u2019s 30% \nmedium-term target. This has forced the government to request adoption of amendment to \nFiscal Responsibility Act, raising the legal threshold level of 45%, set in 2019, to 60%. \nCurrent upward pressures come on the back of a marked trend of rising public debt during \nrecent years. Fiscal slippage, revaluation of foreign currency debt in 2018, and a revision \nof public debt to include some SOE project loans taken over by the government caused \npublic debt to rise to 39.8% in 2019 from 32.7% of GDP in 2017. Exceptionally tough \ncircumstances this year will likely see the debt ratio jump to 49.8%, and to stabilize above \n50% in the years to follow, as overall fiscal deficits are expected to more than outweigh \neconomic growth\u2019s downward pull on the debt ratio. \nDespite the IMF classifying PNG at high risk of debt distress, the DSAs conducted by ADB \n(and the ones conducted by the IMF/WB), have shown that the drastic outcome of the \npandemic would be presenting themselves in the short to medium term and that over the \nlonger term, as PNG\u2019s major resource projects will continue to generate higher growth, the \ndrastic economic effects of the pandemic would gradually dissipate. Both ADB\u2019s and \nIMF/WB\u2019s DSAs point to the fact that as breaches of debt services are either one-off or \nshort lived, the longer-term sustainability of the country\u2019s external and public debt are \npreserved. ADB\u2019s assessment points to the gradual decline of the projected present value \nof the public debt-to-GDP to below 50% from 2024 and onwards (45% in IMF/WB\u2019s DSA). \nBoth DSAs reach the conclusion that the short-term breaches of the external debt service-\nto-revenue ratio are expected to be financed by loans with concessional terms. ADB\u2019s \nproposed loan, which represents 2.5% of PNG\u2019s outstanding debt stock, is not expected to \nadd significantly to the debt service obligations facing the government or affect PNG\u2019s debt \nsustainability. \n6.  Coordination  ADB has been in close communication with the IMF on the CPRO. ADB undertook regular \nwith the IMF  dialogue with the IMF on issues such as an assessment of the macroeconomic and fiscal \nsituation, particularly related to how the increasing deficit would affect debt sustainability. \nADB also sought the IMF\u2019s views on the access criteria for this CPRO. The IMF commenced \na SMP in Feb 2020, and ADB has been closely coordinating with the IMF on the SOE reform \nprogram, which is a benchmark in the SMP. When the IMF prepared its RCF and undertook \na review of the SMP, the IMF sought ADB\u2019s views on the economic outlook in the context \nof ADB\u2019s budget support in 2020 and forward pipeline. In June 2020, the IMF disbursed \n$364 million to PNG, under a RCF and prepared an updated DSA. The RCF paper notes \nthe need for additional financing support for PNG. The IMF\u2019s RCF report is provided in lieu \nof an assessment letter. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; BPNG = Bank of Papua New Guinea; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease; CPRO = \nCOVID-19 pandemic response option; DSA = debt sustainability analysis; GDP = gross domestic product; IMF = \nInternational Monetary Fund; K = kina; LNG = liquified natural gas; MSME = micro, small and medium-sized enterprise; \nNCC = National Control Center; PHA = provincial health authority; PNG = Papua New Guinea; RCF = Rapid Credit \nFacility; SMP = Staff-Monitored Program; SOE = state-owned enterprise; US = United States; WB = World Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20201119175117+11'00'", "Creator": "PDF24 Creator", "Keywords": "papua new guinea, png, COVID-19 response, pandemic, disease control, communicable disease, health system development, emergency preparedness and response, loan 4015, adb projects, terms and conditions, board approval, rrp, approved projects", "ModDate": "D:20201201154802+08'00'", "Producer": "GPL Ghostscript 9.27", "Subject": "The report and recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors (RRP) document describes the terms and conditions of a project for consideration and approval by ADB's Board of Directors.
