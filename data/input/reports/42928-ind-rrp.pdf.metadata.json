The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nA. \n\nSector Background \n\nPF\n\nFP\n\n1\n\nT \n\n2. \nIndia has the second largest road network in the world, with a total estimated road length \nof about 3.3 million kilometers (km). An efficient and reliable transportation network is necessary \nfor  India\u2019s  socioeconomic  development  as  well  as  its  national  integration.  The  Indian  road \nnetwork is extensive but generally of poor quality. The transport sector is regarded as one of the \npriority sectors for improvement, to achieve India\u2019s ambitious development targets. The current \nstate of the transport sector, caused by chronic underfunding and resulting capacity shortages, \nis broadly seen as the major constraint on India\u2019s economic growth. \n \n3. \nRoad transport is dominant in India, accounting for 65% of freight movement (in ton-km) \nand 87% of passenger traffic (in passenger-km); rail accounts for much of the rest. India\u2019s road \nnetwork  mainly  consists  of  three  categories  of  roads:  (i)  66,754  km  of  national  highways; \n(ii) 128,000  km  of  state  highways  and  470,000  km  of  major  district  roads;  and  (iii)  about \n2.7 million  km  of  the  tertiary  system,  mainly  consisting  of  rural  roads  (other  district  roads  and \nvillage roads).T\n \n4. \nThe national highways serve as the arterial network of India. They run across the length \nand breadth of the country\u2014connecting all state capitals, major ports, international boundaries, \nand areas of economic and strategic importance. They constitute less than 2% of the country\u2019s \nroad length but carry about 40% of the road-based traffic. An overwhelming proportion of their \ntotal length is single-laned (27%) or double-laned (59%); only 14% has four lanes or more. The \nnational highways are the lifeline of the transport network, and their development is critical for \nsustaining the momentum of economic growth. \n \n5. \nResponsibility for developing and maintaining the national highway system rests with the \nMinistry  of  Shipping,  Road  Transport  and  Highways  (MOSRTH),  while  state,  district,  and  rural \nroads  are  the  responsibility  of  state  and  local  governments.  The  central  Government  provides \nfunds  for  developing  and  maintaining  national  highways  from  a  yearly  budgetary  allocation, \nwhile the respective state governments provide funds for state highways, and district and rural \nroads.  The  funds  come  from  a  mixture  of  general  revenue,  national  and  state  fuel  cess,  tolls, \nand external funding. \n \n6. \nThe  national  highways  and  the  secondary  system  have  been  unable  to  cope  with  the \nrapid traffic growth. In the road sector, freight traffic has increased at about 12% per year and \npassenger  traffic  at  about  8%  annually  over  the  past  decade.  Over  the  last  6  years  (FY2001- \n\n                                                 \n1\nT   Department of Road Transport and Highways, Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways, Government of \n\nIndia. 2008.

This is projected to get worse as the Indian economy is expected to grow at over \n8% per annum in the long term. It is difficult to forecast the projected growth precisely in traffic \nvolumes.  However,  the  Investment  Commission  of  India  has  projected  an  annual  increase  of \n12%\u201315% for passenger traffic and 15%\u201318% for cargo traffic.T\n \nB. \n\nGovernment Policy Response and Plan \n\nT \n\n2\n\n3\n\nFP\n\nPF\n\nPF\n\nFP\n\n7. \nRecognizing the challenge of accelerating the provision of road transport infrastructure, \nlack of which is becoming a clear drag on the economy, the Government initiated investment in, \nand  reform  of,  the  national  highway  system.  An  autonomous  body,  the  National  Highways \nAuthority of India (NHAI), was made operational in 1995 and given the mandate to upgrade and \nstrengthen the national highways comprehensively.  \n \nMOSRTH  retained  the  overall  strategy  and  policy-making  mandate  for  the  national \n8. \nhighway system. NHAI is responsible for operations\u2014including the development, maintenance, \nand management of the national highways, which are vested to it. NHAI is required to discharge \nits functions transparently, based on sound business principles, as far as is practicable. Through \na series of reforms partly supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (Appendix 3), NHAI \nhas  taken  significant  steps  to  develop  and  strengthen  its  institutional  capacity  and  move  in  a \nmore commercial direction. \n \nNHAI  launched  an  ambitious  program  in  1999.  The  National  Highway  Development \n9. \nProject (NHDP) was initially introduced in two phases at a cost of $14 billion. Since then, it has \nbeen greatly expanded. The objective of the NHDP is not only to augment existing capacity, but \nto  build  a  more  efficient  and  safer  highway  network.  It  is  being  implemented  concurrently  in \nseven phases and broadly covers the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nPhase  I  covers  the  golden  quadrilateral  linking  the  four  metropolises  of  India\u2014\nDelhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai\u2014through a four-lane highway (5,846 km). \nPhase II includes the north\u2013south corridor (about 4,000 km) connecting Srinagar \nto Kanyakumari, and the east\u2013west corridor (about 3,300 km) connecting Silchar \nto Porbandar. This phase also covers port connectivity. \nPhase III (10,000 km) covers national highways carrying high volumes of traffic; \nconnects state capitals with the network established in the first two phases; and \nprovides connectivity to places of economic, commercial, and tourist importance.  \nPhase IV (20,000 km) envisages upgrading of existing single-lane and two-lane \nnational highways across the country to high-quality two-lane national highways. \nPhase  V  (6,500  km)  provides  for  expansion  to  six  lanes  of  the  four-lane \nhighways,  comprising  the  golden  quadrilateral  and  certain  other  high-density \nstretches. The Project is part of this phase. \nPhase VI (1,000 km) includes the development of 1,000 km of expressways on a \nbuild\u2013operate\u2013transfer  (BOT)  basis  to  serve  the  growing  urban  centers, \nparticularly those located within a few hundred kilometers of each other.  \nPhase  VII  provides  for  building  of  ring  roads,  bypasses,  grade  separators,  and \nservice roads to utilize the enhanced capacity of the national highways fully. \n\n                                                 \n2\nT   Thangaraj Committee, Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways. 2006.

The NHDP \nis  funded  by  a  mixture  of  sources:  (i)  the  Government  of  India  from  a  non-lapsable  and \ndedicated central road fund, financed by tax on petrol and diesel; (ii) market borrowing of NHAI; \n(iii) external assistance from ADB, World Bank, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation; \nand (iv) tolls and private sector investment through public\u2013private partnership (PPP). \n \nInitially, the Government mainly relied on public funding for implementation of the NHDP \n11. \nbecause  of  the  scale  of  the  investment,  the  long  gestation  periods,  uncertain  returns,  and  the \nrelative inexperience of the concession industry. The magnitude of the resource requirements, \nand  the  perceived  efficiency  and  responsiveness  of  the  private  sector,  have  recently  led  the \nGovernment to encourage active private sector involvement.  \n \n12. \nThe Government has initiated a set of policies and incentives to make the sector more \ninvestment-friendly. They include the following: (i) the Government will carry out all preparatory \nwork,  including  land  acquisition,  with  the  right-of-way  (ROW)  to  be  made  available  to \nconcessionaires  free  from  all  encumbrances;  (ii)  setting  up  a  transparent  competitive  bidding \nprocess,  developing  a  standard  concession  agreement,  and  standardization  of  procurement \nrequirements;  (iii)  100%  tax  exemption  for  5  years  and  30%  relief  for  the  next  5  years;  (iv) \nforeign direct investment under the automatic route permitted for all road development projects; \n(v) duty-free import of specified modern high capacity equipment for highway construction; and \n(vi) a capital grant of up to 40% for viability gap funding of uneconomic projects. \n \nC. \n\nPublic\u2013Private Partnership \n\n13. \nIn  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  decision  of  April  2007,  all  new  projects  under \ndifferent phases of the NHDP will be implemented on a PPP basis by awarding them first on a \nBOT  (toll)  basis,  failing  which  on  a  BOT  (annuity)  basis,  failing  which  only  on  an  engineering \nprocurement  and  construction  (EPC)  basis.  The  PPP  approach  has  been  adopted,  as  it \nprovides  a  solution  to  the  enormous  investment  requirements  in  the  sector  and  creates  an \nefficient allocation of risks and rewards. \n  \n14. \nIn  a  BOT  modality,  the  private  party  is  responsible  for  constructing,  maintaining,  and \noperating the road during the concession period. At the end of the concession period, the road \nis  transferred  to  NHAI.  In  a  BOT  toll  modality,  the  private  party  recovers  its  investment  by \ncollecting the toll over the life of the concession. The bids are awarded on the amount of the up-\nfront  lump  sum  payment  made  by  the  concessionaire  to  NHAI  (or  least  the  subsidy  received \nfrom  NHAI)  through  a  competitive  bidding  process.  The  concessionaire  provides  the  initial \ninvestment and takes the construction, operation, and traffic risk.  \n \n15. \nIn  a  BOT  annuity  modality,  the  bid  is  awarded  on  basis  of  the  least  amount  of  annuity \npayments required by the concessionaire from NHAI. The private party takes no market or traffic \nrisk; that risk is borne by NHAI. The concessionaire still provides the initial investment and takes \nthe construction and operation risk. In the EPC modality, the private party is only responsible for \nconstruction  of  the  Project,  and  NHAI  provides  the  investment  and  takes  the  operation  and \ntraffic or market risk. \n \nTo  provide  an  enabling  environment  for  PPPs,  a  policy  and  regulatory  framework  has \n16. \nbeen developed for BOT projects, in the form of a standard model concession agreement. The \nconcession  agreement  addresses  issues  that  are  typically  important  for  limited  recourse \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n    \n\nfinancing of infrastructure projects, such as mitigation and unbundling of risks, allocation of risks \nand  rewards,  symmetry  of  obligations  between  the  principal  parties,  and  termination.  The \ndevelopment  of  the  concession  agreement  substantially  helps  in  streamlining  the  tender \nprocess\u2014enhancing  transparency  and  providing  a  level  playing  field\u2014which  will  encourage \nprivate investment. \n \nD. \n\nAsian Development Bank Operations \n\n1. \n\nCountry Strategy \n\n17.  Mainstreaming  poverty  reduction  is  the  central  organizing  theme  of  ADB\u2019s  country \n4\nstrategy and program (CSP) 2003\u20132006 for India.PF\nFP The CSP draws on the three pillars of ADB\u2019s \npoverty  reduction  strategy:  pro-poor  growth,  social  development,  and  good  governance.  The \nstrategy  aims  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  high-growth  agenda  by  helping  with  fiscal \nconsolidation,  infrastructure  development,  and  private  sector  development.  Political  and \neconomic  developments  since  finalizing  the  CSP  indicate  that  the  strategy  remains  valid, \nespecially the core strategy of poverty reduction through infrastructure-led growth, supported by \n5\nsocial  development  and  good  governance.  The  2006\u20132008  CSP  updatePF\nFP  suggests  that  the \nobjective of accelerating India\u2019s annual GDP growth to 8% depends on upgrading infrastructure \nfacilities  and  improving  the  efficiency  of  such  public  services.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  assistance \nprogram reflects this priority, with infrastructure accounting for nearly 77% of the 3-year pipeline \n(excluding private sector and nonsovereign operations); transport projects account for the bulk \n(36%). \n \nIn  support  of  the  Government\u2019s  11th  Five  Year  Plan,  the  country  operations  business \n18. \nplan  2008\u20132010  calls  for  continued  infrastructure  development  assistance  (transport,  energy, \nand urban); and promoting PPP in a bigger way than it has done in the past.T\nT The draft country \npartnership  strategy  2008\u20132012  reemphasizes  support  for  inclusive  and  environmentally \nsustainable  growth,  with  continued  focus  on  infrastructure  development.  It  also  calls  for \ncatalyzing investment and greater use of the PPP modality.T\n \n\nT  \n\n6\n\n7\n\nFP\n\nFP\n\nPF\n\nPF\n\n2. \n\nSector Strategies \n\n19. \nThe  operating  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  transportation  sector  strategy  are  (i)  investment  in \nphysical  infrastructure,  with  an  emphasis  on  augmenting  existing  structure;  establishment  of \ntotal connectivity, including at the national, state, and rural levels; reducing disparities between \nstates;  development  of  a  modally  balanced  system;  and  subregional  economic  cooperation; \n(ii) policy  and  institutional  reforms,  including  those  at  NHAI;  (iii)  traffic  safety;  (iv)  focus  on \noperation and maintenance (O&M); (v) developing environmentally and socially sound projects; \nand  (vi) increasing  private  sector  participation,  including  PPP.  The  strategy  encourages  ADB \ninterventions  to  increase  private  sector  participation  in  the  transportation  sector,  to  take \nadvantage  of  the  greater  efficiencies  that  private  operators  can  achieve  and  to  help  meet  the \nlarge capital requirements. \n \n\n5\n\n                                                 \n4\nT  ADB. 2003.

ADB has provided loans as well as technical assistance amounting to about $3.4 billion \nfor the sector. In the 1980s, ADB placed emphasis on transportation systems and infrastructure. \nThe  loans  approved  in  this  period  supported  improvements  in  India\u2019s  road,  rail,  and  port \ntransport  networks;  and  in  operating  systems.  In  the  early  1990s,  ADB  turned  to  institutional \ncapacity  building,  agency  restructuring,  and  policy  reforms,  including  the  promotion  of  private \nsector participation. Then, as the Government\u2019s priorities changed, focus was put on removing \ninfrastructure  bottlenecks  and  augmenting  transportation  capacity  to  reduce  poverty  through \neconomic growth while continuing policy dialogue. Appendix 3 describes ADB assistance to the \nroad sector in India and the indicative assistance pipeline. \n  \n21. \nThe  Project  builds  on  assistance  provided  by  ADB  to  the  road  sector  in  India.  In \nparticular, ADB\u2019s public sector operations (South Asia Transport and Communications Division \nand India Resident Mission) have played an important role in \u201csetting the stage\u201d through policy \ndialogue  and  technical assistance  for  the  establishment  and  capacity  building  of  NHAI;  and  in \nformulating  and  supporting  the  NHDP.  These  have  enabled  the  proposed  investment  by  the \nprivate sector (and ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department). \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nRapidly increasing traffic demand on many stretches has necessitated augmentation of \n22. \nthe  existing  four-lane  highways  to  six-lane  highways.  NHAI  has  identified  6,500 km  of  such \nroads.  This  expansion  program  includes  the  golden  quadrilateral.  These  sections  form  NHDP \nphase V, which will be bid out over a period of time as BOT projects. As part of the first wave, \nNHAI  has  bid  out  seven  projects  under  NHDP  phase  V,  including  the  Project  (i.e.,  national \nhighway  [NH]1:  Panipat\u2013Jalandhar).  This  section  of  the  road  is  part  of  the  historical  Grand \nTrunk Road, which ran from Sonargaon in Bangladesh to Peshawar in Pakistan. The road was \nupgraded to four lanes from two lanes during the past decade. \n \n23. \nThe  Project  is  the  largest  among  the  NHDP  phase  V  projects  (Supplementary \nAppendix E). This will be the first time that the design\u2013build\u2013finance\u2013operate (DBFO) model is \nused. DBFO is different from the traditional BOT model, where a detailed design is prepared by \nNHAI and both input and output parameters are defined. In DBFO, which is a well-tested model \nin other countries, only the output is defined and the developer is given the freedom to propose \nnew  technologies,  designs,  and  methods  to  achieve  the  required  output  standard.  Ultimately, \nthis can lead to efficiencies and lower costs. \n \n24. \nThis is also the first time that revenue sharing will be used as a BOT model. Under this \napproach, bid evaluation is based on the percentage of revenues that a bidder is willing to share \nwith  NHAI,  which  is  a  departure  from  the  traditional  model  of  annuity  or  up-front  lump  sum \npayment  to  NHAI.  Under  this  risk  allocation,  NHAI  and  the  concessionaire  share  upside  and \ndownside risks, thereby creating a closer PPP. The revenue-share model is being tried for the \nfirst  time  in  India  (although  it  has  been  used  successfully  in  other  countries)  and  successful \nimplementation would encourage further projects to be bid on this basis. \n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n    \n\nB. \n\nProject Description \n\n1. \n\nProject History and Timeline \n\nIn  November  2006,  a  two-stage  international  competitive  bidding  process  was  initiated \n25. \nby  NHAI  for  the  expansion  to  six  lanes  of  the  Panipat\u2013Jalandhar  section  of  NH1.  In  the  first \nstage, qualified bidders were selected based on their (i) technical capability and experience as \ndeveloper and/or contractor; and (ii) financial strength in terms of net worth and cash accruals. \nThe short-listed candidates from stage one made detailed proposals in the second stage, which \nwere evaluated on the basis of technical submissions and financial bids.  \n \n26. \nIn  January  2008,  the  Soma  Isolux  Consortium  emerged  as  the  winning  bidder.  The \nconcession agreement was signed between NHAI and Soma Isolux (concessionaire) on 9 May \n2008.  The  consortium  ownership  comprised  Isolux  Cors\u00e1n  Concesiones  (51%)  and  Cors\u00e1n-\nCorviam  Construcci\u00f3n  (10%),  both  part  of  the  Group  Isolux  Cors\u00e1n,  and  Soma  Enterprises \n(39%).  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Scope \n\n27. \nThe Project consists of retrofitting the existing four-lane highway to a six-lane highway, \nand  building  flyovers  or  overpasses  and  vehicular  underpasses  on  all  existing  intersections  to \nallow  continuous  flow  of  traffic.  This  has  to  be  undertaken  with  the  minimum  possible \ninconvenience to existing traffic, and with no major deterioration in current levels of service. The \nconcessionaire will also be responsible for the O&M of the road during the concession period. At \npresent,  NHAI  is  collecting  tolls  on  the  existing  four-lane  sections.  This  will  continue  until \nfinancial  close.  Thereafter,  including  during  the  construction  period,  the  concessionaire  will  be \nentitled  to  collect  all  tolls.  At  the  end  of  the  15-year  concession  period,  the  road  will  be \ntransferred back to NHAI. \n \n28. \nThe  project  length  starts  from  km  96.0  in  Panipat  (state  of  Haryana)  and  ends  at \nkm 387.1  in  Jalandhar  (state  of  Punjab),  with  a  total  length  of  291.1  km.  The  project  scope \nconsists  of  (i)  widening  the  existing  four-lane  road  to  six  lanes  (three  lanes  in  each  direction), \nwith  partial  access  control;  (ii)  construction  of  service  roads  on  either  side;  (iii)  provision  of \ncrossover  facilities  with  exit  and  entry  points  at  major  intersections;  (iv)  overpasses,  grade \nseparators,  pedestrian  underpasses,  vehicular  underpasses,  culverts,  minor  bridges,  major \nbridges,  road  over  bridges,  protection  works;  and  (v)  O&M,  including  toll  collection  during  the \nconcession period.  \n \n29. \nIn addition, the Project includes the following facilities: roadside furniture (including crash \nbarriers,  guard  rails,  cat\u2019s  eyes,  etc.);  street  lighting;  pedestrian  facilities;  landscaping  and \narboriculture;  truck  parking;  bus  bays;  highway  patrol  vehicles;  ambulances;  cranes;  an \nadvanced traffic management system; and toll plazas. The toll plaza system will be state-of-the-\nart, with care taken to minimize any theft of tolls. Supplementary Appendix C contains details of \nthe toll system. \n \n30. \nThe  road  will  be  designed  for  continuous  flow  of  traffic.  There  are  currently \n114 intersections, which cause congestion and are a safety hazard. Overpasses and vehicular \nunderpasses will be built at these intersections, which will improve the speed and safety of the \nroad considerably. The paved carriageway on each side of the median will be 10.5 meters wide, \nand each of the lanes will be 3.5 meters wide. The specifications and standards of the project \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nscope are to conform to the Manual of Specifications and Standards for Six-laning of National \nHighways through Public Private PartnershipT\n \n\nT published by MOSRTH. \n\n8\n\nPF\n\nFP\n\n3. \n\nConcession Agreement \n\n31. \nThe  concession  agreement  is  based  on  the  standard  concession  agreement  for  BOT \nprojects in the road sector and has been awarded as a DBFO with a revenue share. It defines \nthe  commercial  arrangements,  allocates  the  risks,  and  unambiguously  specifies  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities of NHAI and the concessionaire. The objective of the concession agreement is \nto  allow  the  private  sector  to  develop  bankable  projects  in  a  timely  fashion.  Appendix  5 \ndescribes the key terms of the concession. \n \nThere  is  a  strict  timeline  for  various  milestones  to  be  met,  with  liquidated  damages \n32. \nspecified  for  any  delays:  (i)  the  concession  agreement  commences  (appointed  date)  when \nfinancial close is achieved, which has to be 180 days after the concession agreement is signed. \nThis  will  be  5  November  2008.  Failure  to  achieve  financial  close  (which  is  defined  as  all \nconditions  precedents  being  met  for  disbursement)  within  this  period  will  lead  to  substantial \nliquidated damages payable by the concessionaire; (ii) within 365 days from the appointed date, \nconstruction needs to start and at least 25% of the total capital cost must be spent; (iii) within \n730 days from the appointed date, the concessionaire must have commenced construction of all \nbridges  and  expended  at  least  65%  of  the  total  capital  cost;  (iv)  by  the  912th    day  from  the \nappointed date, construction needs to be completed; and (v) the concession is for a period of 15 \nyears  after  the  appointed  date.  The  concessionaire  starts  collecting  tolls  immediately  after  the \nappointed  date  on  the  existing  four-lane  toll  road  while  it  is  constructing  the  Project  and  is \nthereafter  entitled,  subject  to  payment  of  a  concession  fee,  to  retain  all  tolls  both  during  and \nafter construction for the duration of the concession period. \n \n33. \nThe risks under the concession have been generally allocated to the parties who are in \nthe  best  position  to  manage  them.  ROW  acquisition  risk  and  environmental  permitting  risk, \nwhich  have  caused  delays  for  many  projects,  are  taken  by  the  Government  as  its  sole \nresponsibility  and  are  a  prerequisite  condition  to  closing  the  transaction.  NHAI  will  be \nresponsible  for  providing  the  ROW  to  the  concessionaire,  free  and  clear  of  all  encumbrances \nand  occupation.  NHAI  is  responsible  for  all  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  compensation. \nNHAI will procure all applicable permits relating to environment protection and conservation of \nsites.  It  will  also  secure  approval  from  the  railway  authorities  to  enable  the  concessionaire  to \nconstruct road over bridges and under bridges at grade crossings. \n \n34. \nThe concessionaire is responsible for designing, building, operating, and maintaining the \nProject, so all technical risks are allocated to the concessionaire. The technical parameters are \nbased mainly on output specifications whose standards are clearly laid out, rather than on input \nspecifications.  Since  only  the  outputs  are  generally  specified,  enough  room  is  left  for  the \nconcessionaire to innovate, add value, and reduce cost. \n \n35. \nThe  concessionaire  is  responsible  for  procuring  financing..  A  number  of  provisions  are \nmade in the concession agreement to facilitate financing and protect the rights of the lenders: (i) \nin the highways sector, project assets do not constitute adequate security for lenders; rather, the \nproject revenue streams are the basis of lender security. Lenders have been given assignment \n\n                                                 \n8\nT   Department of Road Transport and Highways, Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways, Government of \nIndia.  2008.

The  project  corridor  passes  through  some  of  the  most \nimportant agricultural and industrial hubs of India. It also attracts passenger traffic destined for \npilgrim centers like Sirhind and Fatehgarh Sahib, Amaranth, and Vaishnodevi as well as centers \nof  tourism  such  as  Simla  and  Kashmir.  It  connects  Delhi  to  important  cities  in  Punjab  and \nHaryana. Traffic growth on this road is expected to be robust, as this region is considered one of \nthe most dynamic parts of the Indian economy. \n \nThe road passes through Khanna, the largest grain market in Asia. Several trading and \n37. \nmanufacturing  industries,  rice  mills,  and  agro-industries  are  spread  along  both  sides  of  the \ncorridor;  Jalandhar,  Ludhiana,  Gobindgarh,  Ambala,  and  Karnal  are  the  more  important \nindustrial clusters. Supplementary Appendix B lists the important towns along the corridor.  \n \n38. \nThe Project\u2019s traffic study was carried out by BCEOM, a French engineering consulting \nfirm with considerable experience in the sector. The traffic projections take into account growth \nin  population,  state  per  capita  income,  net  state  domestic  product,  vehicle  registrations,  and \nalternative routes. This is an existing road where tolls have been collected for several years, so \nthe risk profile of the transaction is considerably lower than that of a greenfield road project.  \n \n39. \nThe  revenue  risk  is  shared  by  the  concessionaire  and  NHAI.  The  concessionaire  pays \nNHAI 20.14% of the revenues, with a 1% increase to the NHAI share every year. If the actual \ntraffic is lower that the targeted traffic in 2018, the concession period will be increased subject to \na  maximum  increase  of  20%.  If  the  actual  traffic  is  greater  than  targeted  traffic  in  2018,  the \nconcession  period  will  be  reduced  or  the  revenue  share  of  NHAI  will  increase  subject  to  a \nmaximum reduction of 10%. \n \n40. \nThe road is access-controlled and tolls are be collected at toll plazas located at km 146 \n(Butana), km 212 (Shambu), and km 328 (Ladhowal). Tolls are already being collected by NHAI \nfrom these plazas.  After the appointed date, the concessionaire will improve the facilities. The \ntoll rates for various categories of motorized vehicles have been fixed nationally for such BOT \nprojects by NHAI, at predetermined rates on a per-km basis. Concessionary rates are provided \nfor  local  traffic.  Appendix  7  details  the  toll  rates,  which  are  indexed  to  inflation.  Willingness  to \nuse and pay has been established as it is an existing toll road; a user survey also confirms this. \n \n\n5. \n\nSafety \n\nIndia  records  the  highest  number  of  road  accidents  in  the  world.  According  to  the \n41. \nNational Transportation Planning and Research Centre, the number of road accidents in India is \nthree times higher than in developed countries. The number of accidents per 1,000 vehicles in \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nPF\n\nFP\n\n9\n\nIndia  is  as high  as  35,  compared  to  4\u201310  in  developed  countries.  In  2006,  there  were  around \n460,000 road  accidents,  which  killed  105,749  and  injured  close  to  500,000  people  in  India. \nThese  numbers  translate  into  one  road  accident  every  minute  and  one  road  accident  death \nevery  5  minutes.  Road  traffic  injuries  and  fatalities  impose  a  huge  economic  burden.  The \nsocioeconomic cost of road accidents for India in 1999\u20132000 has been estimated at some 3% of \nGDP.T\nT  However,  while  contributing  to  economic  growth,  an  improved  road  network  with  more \ntraffic can also lead to more road accidents unless safety issues are more widely addressed.  \n \nThe  Project  will  have  many  features  that  will  address  the  critical  issue  of  safety.  The \n42. \nconcessionaire  has  to  follow  relevant  standards  and  guidelines  issued  by  MOSRTH  and  the \nIndian  Roads  Congress.  A  safety  consultant  will  be  appointed  by  NHAI  to  oversee  safety \nmeasures  during  the  development,  construction,  and  operation  periods\u2014both  for  workers  and \nroad  users.  Safety  is  addressed  in  the  design  phase,  with  the  safety  consultant  reviewing  the \nroad  design.  Provisions  have  been  made  for  a  change  in  project  scope  to  address  the \nrecommendations of the safety consultant. All accident data will be compiled, analyzed by the \nsafety  consultant,  and  recommendations  will  be  put  forward  for  prevention.  Once  a  year,  the \nsafety consultant will carry out a safety audit. \n \n43. \nIn addition, the Project has provision for the following: (i) the concessionaire will assist \nthe state government to set up and operate a medical aid post at each of the three toll plazas. \nThe  concessionaire  will  pay  for  construction  of  the  aid  post  and  the  recurring  expenditure; \n(ii) around-the-clock  ambulance  services  will  be  provided,  with  response  time  of  no  more  than \n10 minutes; (iii) highway patrol will be provided at all times to provide assistance to users and \nmonitor  road  conditions;  (iv)  cranes  will  be  provided  to  tow  away  disabled  vehicles  that  might \nbecome  a  safety  hazard;  (v)  a  lighting  system  will  be  provided;  (vi)  crash  barriers,  guardrails, \nand delineators and cat\u2019s eyes will be provided; and (vii) accelerating and decelerating lanes will \nbe provided to enter and exit the highway. \n \n44.  Many  accidents  occur  in  India  because  local  traffic  is  mixed  with  fast-moving  highway \ntraffic. This is a major safety hazard and causes considerable congestion. However, local traffic \nvery often has no other option but to use the main highway. In the case of the Project, no direct \naccess is provided to local traffic. Access will be provided through service roads, which will be \nconstructed on both sides of the highway and will only be broken at bridges and toll plazas. To \nconnect  the  service  roads  and  allow  the  local  traffic  to  move  freely  in  between,  43  vehicular \nunderpasses and 71 overpasses will be provided. \n \nFor pedestrian safety, the Project will have (i) pedestrian walkways and guardrails along \n45. \nservice  roads  in  urban  areas;  (ii)  55  footbridges  and  19  pedestrian  underpasses;  and \n(iii) pedestrian crossings at service roads. In addition, 72 bus bays will be provided for picking \nup and dropping off passengers; these will be separated from the main highway and built only \non the service roads. Sixteen truck parking areas will also be provided so that trucks do not park \non the main highway. \n \nC. \n \n46. \nSoma Isolux NH One Toll Way Private Limited (Soma Isolux) has been incorporated as \na special purpose vehicle to implement the Project.

Cors\u00e1n-Corviam  Construcci\u00f3n  will  have  a  61%  share  in  this \nventure and Soma will have a 39% share. \n \n54. \nThe  EPC  contractor  will  carry  out  design  and  quality  control,  and  overall  project \nmanagement.  The  project  management  team  will  comprise  professionals  with  extensive \nexperience  in  road  management,  construction,  and  operations.  The  EPC  contractor  will \noutsource  construction  work  to  a  constructor  through  an  EPC  outsourcing  agreement.  The \noutsourced constructor will be 100% owned by Soma. The EPC contractors will be jointly and \nseverally liable for all the obligations under the EPC agreement. Soma has been given the main \nresponsibility  to  construct  the  Project  because  of  its  familiarity  with  local  conditions  and \nextensive experience in implementing NHAI projects. Cors\u00e1n-Corviam Construcci\u00f3n will provide \nits input extensively during the design phase. \n \n55. \nThe  implementation  schedule  has  been  defined  under  the  concession  agreement,  with \nconstruction to be completed within 30 months and intermediate project milestones to be met at \nregular  intervals.  Failure  to  meet  any  milestone  will  lead  to  liquidated  damages.  Monthly \nprogress reports will be provided, and the road will have to pass several tests and inspections \nbefore a project completion certificate is issued. The EPC agreement\u2019s implementation schedule \nis structured so that completion should occur 6 months ahead of schedule. \n \n\n2. \n\nOperation and Maintenance \n\n56. \nDuring  the  construction  and  operation  periods,  Soma  Isolux  will  be  responsible  for \noperating  and  maintaining  the  project  highway  in  accordance  with  the  concession  agreement, \nwhich lays out the standards and requirements. Details of the O&M are yet to be finalized but it \nis expected that the sponsors will undertake this activity directly and not outsource it, given their \nexperience.  The  standards  of  O&M  have  been  developed  by  the  Indian  Roads  Congress  and \nare  based  on  best  practice.  O&M  operations  will  be  divided  along  four  key  departments\u2014toll \nplaza, corridor control, routine road maintenance, and central control center. Each department \nwill be headed by its own manager, who will report to the O&M manager. \n \n57. \nThere will be three toll plazas, which will have semiautomatic, automatic, and electronic \ntoll collection. Special care has been taken to provide a high quality of service and avoid theft of \ntoll  revenues.  This  will  be  achieved  by  implementing  state-of-the-art  toll  equipment  and  strict \nmonitoring. Each toll plaza will have a plaza manager to manage the day-to-day operations and \nmaintenance. The plaza manager will be supported by the plaza controllers, administration and \nplaza  maintenance  team.  The  operation  will  be  audited  on  a  day-to-day  basis  by  the  on-site \naudit  team  member,  who  will  ensure  that  all  control  measures  and  company  policies  are \nadhered  to  at  all  times.  The  audit  team  on  site,  although  working  at  the  toll  plaza,  will  report \ndirectly to the audit manager. \n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n    \n\n3. \n\nMonitoring and Supervision \n\n58.  Monitoring  and  supervision  of  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  will  be \nundertaken  through  an  independent  engineer  who  will  be  selected  by  NHAI  from  its  panel  of \nqualified  firms.  The  independent  engineer  will  be  remunerated  through  NHAI  rather  than  the \nconcessionaire,  to  ensure  its  independence.  The  process  of  appointing  the  independent \nengineer  has  already  been  initiated  and  one  should  be  appointed  very  soon.  A  lenders\u2019 \nindependent engineer will also be appointed to assist the lenders. \n  \n59. \nThe  independent  engineer  plays  a  critical  role  in  the  Project.  The  broad  role  and \nfunctions of the independent engineer include (i) review of the drawings and documents during \nthe development period; (ii) review, inspection, and monitoring of construction works during the \nconstruction period; (iii) conducting tests on completion of construction, and issuing completion \ncertificates;  (iv)  review,  inspection,  and  monitoring  of  O&M  during  the  construction  operation \nperiods;  (v)  determining  the  costs  of  any  works  or  service  and/or  their  reasonableness;  and \n(vi) assisting the parties in resolution of disputes. \n \n60. \nThe  concessionaire  will  maintain  a  book  of  accounts  recording  all  toll  receipts.  As  it \nshares  the  revenue  with  the  concessionaire,  NHAI  is  highly  motivated  to  ensure  that  all  toll \nrevenues  are  collected  correctly.  A  reputed  statutory  auditor  will  be  selected  by  the \nconcessionaire from the panel of auditors approved by NHAI, and will audit the traffic count for \neach category of vehicle and the payment of fee. NHAI can directly appoint an additional auditor \nif required. \n \nE. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions  \n\n61. \nADB classifies the Project environment category B, involuntary resettlement category B, \nand  indigenous  peoples  category  C.  NHAI  commissioned  the  social  impact  assessment  and \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  reports  in  2007.  ADB  reviewed  the  studies  related  to  the \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  Project,  and  an  environmental  and  social  safeguard \ndue diligence mission was fielded during 7\u201310 May 2008.  \n \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n62. \nADB classifies the Project environment category B. No protected areas or ecologically, \nculturally,  or  historically  sensitive  sites  are  traversed  by  or  near  the  project  area.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination has been conducted by consulting engineering services on behalf of \nNHAI, and the summary initial environmental examination is in Supplementary Appendix A. The \nProject is expected to create minor environmental impacts normally associated with construction \nworks  such  as  loss  of  trees,  erosion,  siltation,  spoil  and  waste  generation,  dust,  noise, \nemissions from asphalt and hot mix plants and from construction equipment and vehicles, and \nimpacts  from  borrow  pits  and  quarry  sites.  Mitigating  measures  will  include  planning  and \nconfining activities within the construction area and replanting to address damage to vegetation; \nimplementing adequate drainage, embankment consolidation, and slope stabilization measures; \nbalancing  cut  and  fill;  proper  siting  of  asphalt,  hot  mix  plants,  and  construction  camps;  and \ninstalling dust and noise suppression and exhaust emission control measures. Borrow pits and \nquarry  sites  will  be  suitably  identified  and  approved  by  the  state  pollution  control  boards.  The \nnegative environmental impacts are considered temporary and insignificant, provided mitigation \nmeasures  are  adopted  and  implemented.  Detailed  mitigation  measures  and  a  monitoring \nprogram with cost estimates have been developed in the detailed environmental management \nplan  to  be  implemented  during  construction  and  operation.  Public  consultation  has  been \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nundertaken and stakeholders\u2019 views were collected and responded to in the project design and \nenvironmental management plan formulation. During operation, the Project is expected to have \nlong-term  positive  impacts  related  to  the  improved  road  and  transportation,  time  and  fuel \nsavings, and economic growth nationally and along the highway corridor. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n63. \nNH1 is a heavily traveled four-lane divided highway intersected by several national and \nstate  highways  that  run  through  one  of  the  most  prosperous  agricultural  and  commercial  and \nindustrial areas in India. Most lands are agricultural, with commercial and built-up areas in some \nstretches.  The  lands  adjoining  the  highway  are  primarily  agricultural,  with  extensive  plantation \ncover  and  a  few  pockets  of  barren  land.  NH1  has  relatively  few  encroachments,  with  shops, \ncommercial  establishments  (largely  roadside  cafes),  and  residences  set  back  from  the  road, \napparently  mainly  in  anticipation  of  expansion  by  NHAI.  As  is  customary  along  its  major \nhighways,  NHAI  has  conducted  extensive  information  campaigns.  Most  of  the  land  was \nacquired  when  the  original  road  was  expanded  to  a  four-lane  highway  a  decade  ago;  only \naround 2% of land acquisition remains to be done for the Project. \n \n64. \nNHAI  is  responsible  for  acquiring  all  lands  and  compensating  for  loss  of  assets  and \nlivelihoods  for  development  on  the  national  highway  network  it  administers.  The  basic \nparameters  are  governed  by  the  National  Highways  Act  of  1956  and  1988,  together  with  the \nRules  of  1957,  1974,  and  1997  and  various  circulars  related  to  land  acquisition.  Resettlement \nand compensation issues are also dealt with in NHAI\u2019s Works Manual (2006). ADB has been a \ndevelopment  partner  of  NHAI  for  many  years,  with  several  technical  assistance  activities  and \nloans totaling about $1.6 billion provided for national highway development, mainly the golden \nquadrilateral.  NHAI  will  be  responsible  for  resettlement,  if  any,  and  restoration  of  income  in \naccordance  with  the  national  rehabilitation  and  resettlement  policy  (NRRP),  2007,  prior  to \nhanding over the land to the concessionaire.  \n \n \nF. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n1. \n\nImpact, Outcome, and Output \n\n65. \nThe Project aims to promote sustainable economic development in India by developing a \nmore  efficient  transport  system.  An  efficient  highway  network,  which  is  the  main  artery  of  the \ntransportation system in India, is a prerequisite for sustained socioeconomic development. The \nProject will achieve the following objectives: (i) allow continuous traffic flow on a critical section \nof the Indian highway network, alleviating congestion which will reduce fuel use and allow faster \ntravel;  (ii)  remove  capacity  constraints  by  making  the  road  a  six-lane  highway  (iii)  improve \nconnectivity and trade by facilitating efficient movement of goods in the agricultural heartland of \nthe country; (iv) improve safety by introducing design features that will reduce traffic accidents; \n(v)  encourage  further  private  sector  investment  in  the  critical  and  underfunded  transportation \nsector  from  international  and  domestic  sponsors;  and  (vi)  underpin  a  new  PPP  model,  which \nallows efficient sharing of the project risks and benefits between NHAI (public) and the private \nsponsor. The Project\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n\n \n66. \nThe development effectiveness of the Project will be assessed in terms of private sector \ndevelopment, business success, and economic sustainability in accordance with the guidelines \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n    \n\nfor  implementing  the  good  practice  standards  for  evaluating  private  sector  investment \noperations, prepared by the evaluation cooperation group of multilateral development banks. In \nterms  of  private  sector  development  impact  at  the  company  level,  the  Project  will  expand  the \nsponsors\u2019  capacity  to  build,  operate,  and  manage  very  large  projects.  This  is  the  largest  BOT \nproject ever awarded in India for a road project. The Project will also allow Spanish and Indian \nsponsors  to  exchange  technical  and  operational  skills,  which  will  improve  the  efficiency  in \nconstruction and management of the toll road. \n \nFor  the  Project  and  beyond,  positive  impacts  include  development  of  workforce  skills \n67. \nand  building  capacity  in  the  Indian  construction  and  infrastructure  industry.  The  Project  is \nexpected to yield a private sector development impact well beyond the Project. It is the first of \nthe  toll  road  projects  being  tried  on  a  DBFO  basis  with  revenue  share,  which  will  help \ndemonstrate  the  feasibility  of  joint  public\u2013private  development  of  such  road  projects.  It  also \ndemonstrates  the  execution  of  international  collaboration.  This  is  important,  as  Indian \ninfrastructure  needs  in  the  transportation  sector  would  be  hard  to  meet  without  international \ninvestment,  capacity,  and  expertise.  The  Project  is  financially  sustainable  and  meets  local \nenvironment requirements. Its development effectiveness framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\n. \n\n \nG. \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n68. \nThe  economic  analysis  for  the  Project  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (1997). The main benefit of the decongestion, \nexpansion,  and  improvement  of  NH1  is  faster  traffic  flow,  which  leads  to  savings  in  vehicle \noperating  cost  (VOC)  and  time.  The  VOC  was  analyzed  using  the  Highway  Design  and \nMaintenance  (HDM)  model.  The  comparison  between  with-  and  without-project  scenarios \ndetermined the incremental costs and benefits. The quantified benefits are savings in VOC and \nsavings in passenger time costs. Other benefits, such as the reduced number of accidents, are \nnot  quantified.  Population  growth  and  increases  in  economic  activity  drive  traffic  growth.  The \nsensitivity  of  the  EIRR  was  tested  under  increases  in  costs  and  declines  in  traffic  volumes. \nUnder all scenarios, the EIRR is well above the social discount rate of 12%.   \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nLoan \n\nA. \n \n69. \nThe  proposed  ADB  assistance  will  comprise  (i)  ADB  loan  of  up  to  $100,000,000 \n(denominated  in  US  dollar  and  or  Indian  rupee  equivalent)  which  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  without  government  guarantee;  (ii)  a  B  loan  of  up  to  $140,000,000. \nThe  ADB  assistance  will  be  subject  to  relevant  Reserve  Bank  of  India  and  other  government \napprovals  for  any  US  dollar-denominated  lending  loan.  Any  rupee  loan  will  require  the \nGovernment\u2019s approval to issue an Indian rupee bond and/or the completion of cross-currency \nswap documentation with the Government\u2019s approved swap counterparty. \n \n70. \nThe ADB loan will have a maximum term of up to 13 years, including a grace period of \nup to 3 years. It will be repaid quarterly. The loan will carry an interest rate and fees customary \nin the market to be determined by ADB\u2019s Pricing and Credit Enhancement Committee.  \n \n71. \nThe  loan  will  share  common  terms  and  conditions  with  the  loans  of  other  lenders  to \nProject,  where  appropriate,  in  addition  to  ADB-specific  terms  and  conditions.  The  loan  will  be \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nsubject  to  conditions  precedent  for  disbursements,  including  all  necessary  government  and \nshareholder  approvals,  consents,  and  contractual  and  financial  arrangements  satisfactory  to \nADB.  The  loan  agreement  will  include  appropriate  (i)  representations  and  warranties; \n(ii) covenants,  including  affirmative,  negative,  financial,  and  information  covenants;  and \n(iii) events of default. \n \n72. \nThe  security  package  will  include  arrangements  typical  for  such  financing,  including \ncharges over the project shares, bank accounts, project assets to the extent allowed by national \nlaw,  debt  service  reserve,  support  for  cost  overrun,  assignment  of  project  agreements  and \ninsurance. The Project will be bound by covenants related to security, tailored to the transaction. \nThe lenders will be protected by appropriate remedies for events of default. ADB will enter into \nan inter-creditor agreement and share in the security package pari passu with the other lenders. \n \nB. \n \n73. \n \n\nThe Project merits ADB support for the following reasons:  \n\nJustification  \n\nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  transportation  and  road \nsector  strategy  and  its  10th  and  11th  five  year  plans  for  augmenting  the \ncapacity  of  national  highways,  which  face  enormous  constraints  because \nof  accelerating  traffic  demand.  The  Project  is  part  of  the  Government\u2019s \nNHDP  phase  V,  which  provides  for  expansion  to  six  lanes  of  the  key \nhighway arteries in India. \n\nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  CSP  for  India,  which  calls  for \ncontinued  infrastructure  development  assistance  (transport,  energy,  and \nurban)  and  promoting  PPP.  In  particular,  the  Project  is  built  on  ADB \nassistance in the reform and capacity building of NHAI and dovetails with \nvarious efforts by the regional department to encourage private investment \nin the road sector. \n\nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  the  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  transport  sector \nstrategy\u2014investment  in  physical  infrastructure,  with  an  emphasis  on \naugmenting existing structures; traffic safety; and increasing private sector \nparticipation, including PPP. \n\nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  the  PPP  strategy  of  ADB  and  India.  The \nstrategy encourages increased private sector participation in underfunded \nsectors  through  structuring  projects,  initiating  policy  reforms,  and  direct \ninterventions.  Private  sector  participation  can  bring  greater  efficiency  and \nadd private investment to a critical sector like the highway sector in India \n(which needs to mobilize $52 billion equivalent by 2015). \n\nThe Project is the largest of the first phase of NHDP V projects. It would be \none  of  the  first  DBFO  structures  to  use  a  revenue-sharing  model  for  the \nfirst  time  in  Indian  roads.  This  BOT  structure  allows  efficient  allocation  of \nrisks  and  allows  private  sector  players  to  innovate,  as  it  focuses  on \noutputs  and \ninputs.  Successful \nimplementation  of  this  Project  would  allow  other  projects  to  follow  this \nmodality.  \n\nlevels  of  service \n\nrather \n\nthan \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n    \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  Project  runs  through  the  so-called  \u201cbread  basket\u201d  of  India.  The  road \npasses through the largest grain market in Asia as well as many towns with \nimportant  agro-industries.  Having  an  efficient  and  reliable  transportation \nnetwork in this part of the country will benefit the agrarian economy. \n\n \n(vii)  The  proposed  ADB  financial  assistance  will  enable  Soma  Isolux  to  raise \nlong-tenor debt financing for the Project. This type of financing is suitable \nfor  infrastructure  projects  of  this  nature  but  not  readily  available  in  the \nIndian  market.  If  relevant  government  approvals  are  obtained,  the  Project \ncan  raise  attractive  dollar-based  financing  from  ADB,  which  is  not  readily \navailable in this sector for India from international banks. \n\n(viii)  This  is  ADB\u2019s  first  private  sector  loan  in  India\u2019s  road  sector  (and  only  the \nthird  private  sector  loan  for  a  road  project  by  ADB).  The  proposed  loan \ncomplements and builds on prior work done by ADB. \n\nMain Risks and Mitigating Factors \n\n74. \nRight-of-Way  Acquisition.  NHAI  will  be  responsible  for  providing  ROW  to  the \nconcessionaire, free and clear of all encumbrances and occupation. NHAI is responsible for all \nland  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  compensation.  The  Government  has  recognized  from \nexperience  that  this  is  a  likely  cause  of  delay,  which  concessionaires  have  limited  ability  to \nmitigate. It has thus taken this as its sole responsibility. As a condition precedent to the financial \nclose,  60%  of  the  ROW  is  to  be  provided  at  financial  closure  and  the  remaining  ROW  within \n90 days.  Delay  will  lead  to  liquidated  damages  to  be  paid  to  the  concessionaire.  The  Project \nalready has over 60%   ROW available, and the rest will be acquired soon. Most of the ROW \nwas acquired a decade ago when the two-lane highway was expanded to a four-lane highway. \n \nPermitting.  NHAI  will  procure  all  applicable  permits  relating  to  environment  protection \n75. \nand conservation of sites, and approval of the railway authorities to enable the concessionaire \nto  construct  road  over  bridges,  under  bridges  and  at  grade  crossings.  Lack  of  the  necessary \nenvironmental  clearance  has  been  a  major  cause  of  delay  in  projects, so  it  has  been  made  a \ncondition  precedent  for  the  appointed  date.  For  other  permits,  Soma  Isolux  will  receive \nassistance  from  NHAI  and  the  governments  of  Punjab  and  Haryana  in  accordance  with  their \nagreements.  Availability  of  all  applicable  permits  to  the  satisfaction  of  NHAI  and  ADB  will  be \nrequired in accordance with the loan agreement. \n \n76. \nConstruction  Completion  Risk.  Soma  Isolux  will  sign  a  fixed-price,  lump-sum  EPC \ncontract  with  Cors\u00e1n-Corviam  Construcci\u00f3n  and  Soma.  The  core  competency  of  both \ncompanies  is  engineering  and  construction  and  they  have  substantial  experience  in  India  and \ninternationally in successfully implementing similar road projects. Given the experience with the \nIndian environment, the EPC contractor will outsource construction work to a constructor 100% \nowned  by  Soma.  Soma  has  implemented,  or  is  implementing,  14 NHAI  projects.  It  has  a \nsuccessful  record  for  completing  all  the  road  projects  on  time  or  before  time.  The  EPC \ncontractor  has  also  hired  an  experienced  design  coordinator  and  design  consultant  for  the \nProject, both experts in the field. \n \n77. \nThe project road has been divided into five separate sections and each section is being \nrun  as  an  independent  project  with  its  own  management,  labor,  material,  and  machinery.  The \nconstruction  schedule  has  been  planed  to  complete  the  Project  6  months  ahead  of  schedule. \nThis  redundancy  and  independence  would  help  in  mitigating  the  construction  risk  delay.  The \n\n \n\n \nC. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nProject has already been mobilized well ahead of time. The risk of construction cost and delay \nwill  also  be  mitigated  to  some  extent  by  insurance  (Supplementary  Appendix  D)  and  support \nfrom  EPC  contractors  and/or  sponsors.  The  sponsors  will  bring  in  additional  equity  or  provide \nsubordinated loans to cover any shortfall caused by cost overruns during implementation. \n \n78. \nTraffic Risk. The primary risk of the Project is that not enough traffic will be generated to \nmeet  debt  service  obligations.  This  risk  is  tied  to  the  general  macro  economy  of  India, \nparticularly the economy of the Project\u2019s traffic catchment area. Punjab and Haryana are the two \nrichest states in India. The macroeconomic conditions within the catchment area of the highway \nare very strong and are expected to remain strong, as this area has good, balanced growth in \nboth  the  agricultural  and  industrial  sectors.  Tolls  have  been  collected  for  many  years  on  the \nexisting  four-lane  highway,  so  users\u2019  willingness  to  pay  and  the  current  traffic  demand  have \nbeen clearly established.  \n \n79. \nOperation and Maintenance Risk. The sponsors have a strong record of operating toll \nroads  in  India  and  internationally.  The  concession  agreement  delineates  in  detail  the  specific \noperating  and  maintenance  requirements,  and  the  independent  engineer  will  monitor  all  the \nrelated work. Insurance will be taken out to cover some of the risks during the period. Adequate \nprovisions  will  be  made  to  have  sufficient  funds  available  for  regular  and  heavy  maintenance \nthrough cash flows and/or reserves. \n \n80. \nThe  toll  road  also  faces  the  risk  of  toll  revenue  leakage  through  theft  because  of \nemployee  misconduct.  This  risk  is  mitigated  by  the  concessionaire  installing  an  automated \nstate-of-the-art tolling system that has three level levels of control and supervision. In addition, it \nhas  an  organization  structure  that  will  strictly  monitor  and  audit  toll  collection.  The  sponsors \nhave managed toll roads before and have a strong record of minimizing toll leakage. \n \n81. \nForce  Majeure  and  Default  Risk.  The  concession  agreement  provides  the  lenders \nprotection directly from NHAI under termination events related to force majeure, concessionaire \ndefault, and NHAI default. This protection, although incomplete, is in addition to what is usually \navailable to lenders in similar transactions.  \n \n \nD. \n \n82. \nSoma  Isolux  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date) \nand  policy  relating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism \n(2003).  Consistent  with its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB  will  require  Soma  Isolux  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and \ncontrols following international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption \nor  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism;  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain \nfrom engaging in such activities.

The  contractual  structure  is  in  Appendix  2.  Overall  management  control  of  the \ncompany will be through the board. The board will delegate the day-to-day work to the general \nmanager, to whom the construction manager, finance manager, and operation and maintenance \n(O&M) manager\u2014all with considerable experience in their fields\u2014will report.  \n\nA. \n\nConstruction \n\n \n\n2. \nSoma  Isolux  will  enter,  on  an  arm\u2019s-length  basis,  into  a  lump-sum,  fixed-price  time-\nbound engineering procurement and construction (EPC) agreement on a turnkey basis, with a \njoint  venture  of  Cors\u00e1n-Corviam  Construcci\u00f3n  and  Soma  Enterprises  (the  EPC  contractor). \nCors\u00e1n-Corviam Construcci\u00f3n will have a 61% share in this venture and Soma Enterprises will \nhave a 39% share. \n \n3. \nDesign and quality control and the overall project management will be carried out by the \nEPC  contractor.  The  project  management  team  will  comprise  professionals  with  extensive \nexperience  in  road  management,  construction,  and  operations.  The  EPC  contractor  will \noutsource  construction  work  to  a  constructor  through  an  EPC  outsourcing  agreement.  The \noutsourced constructor will be 100% owned by Soma Enterprises. The construction contractual \nstructure  is  in  Appendix  2.  The  EPC  contractors  will  be  liable  for  all  the  obligations  under  the \nEPC  agreement.  Soma  Enterprises  has  been  given  the  chief  responsibility  to  construct  the \nProject because of its familiarity with local conditions, and extensive experience in implementing \nNational Highways Authority of India (NHAI) projects. Cors\u00e1n-Corviam Construcci\u00f3n will provide \nits input extensively during the design phase. \n \nThe  organizational  structure  of  the  companies  involved  creates  a  natural  check  and \n4. \nbalance  for  the  contractual  structure.  Isolux  Cors\u00e1n  Concesiones  and  Cors\u00e1n-Corviam \nConstrucci\u00f3n  are  run  as  two  separate  companies  (Appendix  8)  with  their  own  separate  profit \nand  loss  responsibility,  and  management  and  reporting  structure.  Isolux  Cors\u00e1n  Concesiones \nhas  heavily  negotiated  the  EPC  contract  with  Cors\u00e1n-Corviam  Construcci\u00f3n  and  Soma \nEnterprises.  Cors\u00e1n-Corviam  Construcci\u00f3n  has  extensively  negotiated \nthe  construction \noutsourcing agreement with Soma Enterprises. The EPC costs will be reviewed independently \nby a third party. \n \n5. \nThe  EPC  contractor  has  appointed  Intesca  SPAN  as  the  design  coordinator;  and \nMeltech  Infrastructure  Engineers,  SPAN  Consultants,  and  Feedback  Ventures  as  the  design \nconsultants.  Work  has  been  divided  among  the  design  consultants  in  the  following  manner: \nMeltech  Infrastructure  Engineers:  kilometer  (km)  96  to  km  196;  SPAN  Consultants:  km  196  to \nkm 287; and Feedback Ventures: km 287 to km 387.1. The design consultants have extensive \nexperience  and  will  be  responsible  for  providing  the  design  of  the  road,  checking  structural \nadequacy, and providing technical guidance until the end of execution. \n \n6. \nFor the purpose of smooth execution, construction management, timely execution, and \nrisk management, the Project has been divided into five separate construction packages. These \npackages will be independent of each other\u2014with their own management, labor, material, and \nequipment\u2014and work will be executed simultaneously on all five packages.  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nOperation and Maintenance \n\nThe  implementation  schedule  has  been  defined  under  the  concession  agreement,  with \n7. \nconstruction to be completed within 30 months and intermediate project milestones to be met at \nregular  intervals.  Failure  to  meet  any  milestones  will  lead  to  liquidated  damages.  Monthly \nprogress reports will be provided, and the road will have to pass several tests and inspections \nbefore a project completion certificate is issued. The EPC agreement\u2019s implementation schedule \nis structured so that completion should occur 6 months ahead of schedule. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nDuring  the  construction  and  operation  periods,  Soma  Isolux  will  be  responsible  for \noperating  and  maintaining  the  project  highway  in  accordance  with  the  concession  agreement, \nwhich lays out the standards and requirements. Details of the O&M are yet to be finalized but it \nis  expected  that  sponsors  will  undertake  this  activity  directly  and  not  outsource  it,  given  their \nexperience. The O&M standards have been developed by the Indian Roads Congress and are \nbased on best practice.  \n \n \n9. \nThe  corridor  control  department  will  patrol  the  Project  routinely  from  designated  start \npoints and will ensure that project safety levels are maintained. This department will also assist \nmotorists as required, and will form part of the incident management team, which will manage \nincidents  in  a  manner  that  ensures  the  road  is  returned  to  normal  operations  as  soon  as  is \nsafely  possible.  The  corridor  control  team  will  respond  with  ambulances  at  the  scene  of \naccidents as required. \n \nThe  routine  road  maintenance  department  will  ensure  that  highway  maintenance  is \n10. \ncarried  out  in  a  professional  manner  and  the  quality  of  the  road  is  maintained.  It  will  be \nresponsible for inspection, maintenance, and repair of the Project and the facilities. The Project \nhas  been  divided  into  three  sections,  each  with  a  dedicated  on-site  engineer  reporting  to  the \nroutine road maintenance manager. \n \n11. \nThe  central  control  center  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  the  emergency  telephone \nbooths along the route as well as the dispatch and control of emergency response vehicles and \npolice  as  required.  The  central  control  center  will  also  be  the  center  for  all  routine  road \nmaintenance  coordination  that  takes  place  on  the  route.  This  will  ensure  an  integrated  flow  of \ninformation, which will make it possible to convey information to motorists about any incident on \nthe facility or regarding maintenance work taking place at a certain location. The motorists will \nbe  prewarned  via  the  variable  message  signs  located  along  the  project  highway,  making  the \nhighway safer for its users. \n \nC. \n \n12.  Monitoring  and  supervision  of  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  will  be \nundertaken  through  an  independent  engineer  who  will  be  selected  by  NHAI  from  its  panel  of \nqualified  firms.  The  independent  engineer  will  be  remunerated  through  NHAI  rather  than  the \nconcessionaire,  to  ensure  its  independence.  The  process  of  appointing  the  independent \nengineer  has  already  been  initiated  and  one  should  be  appointed  very  soon.  A  lenders\u2019 \nindependent engineer will also be appointed to assist the lenders. \n  \nThe  independent  engineer  plays  a  critical  role  in  the  Project.  The  broad  role  and \n13. \nfunctions of the independent engineer include (i) review of the drawings and documents during \nthe development period; (ii) review, inspection, and monitoring of construction works during the \n\nMonitoring and Supervision \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\nconstruction period; (iii) conducting tests on completion of construction and issuing completion \ncertificates;  (iv)  review,  inspection,  and  monitoring  of  O&M  during  the  construction  operation \nperiods;  (v)  determining  the  costs  of  any  works  or  service  and/or  their  reasonableness;  and \n(vi) assisting the parties in resolution of disputes. \n \n14. \nThe  concessionaire  will  maintain  a  book  of  accounts  recording  all  toll  receipts.  As  it \nshares  the  revenue  with  the  concessionaire,  NHAI  is  highly  motivated  to  ensure  that  all  toll \nrevenues  are  collected  correctly.  A  reputed  statutory  auditor  will  be  selected  by  the \nconcessionaire from the panel of auditors approved by NHAI, and will audit the traffic count for \neach  category  of  vehicle  and  the  payment  of  fee.  NHAI  can  appoint  an  additional  auditor  if \nrequired. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f32     Appendix 5 \n\nKEY FEATURES OF THE CONCESSION AGREEMENT \n\nProject Development and Operations \n\n \nA. \n \nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  concession  agreement,  an  independent \n1. \nengineer is to be appointed by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) The concession \nagreement  stipulates  that  the  commercial  operations  will  commence  only  after  Soma  Isolux \nreceives  the  completion  or  provisional  completion  certificate  from  the  independent  engineer. \nThe  independent  engineer  will  monitor  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  Project,  and  will \nsubmit regular periodic reports (at least once a month) to the NHAI. \n  \n2. \nThe NHAI has the right to change the scope of the Project. However, any costs arising \nfrom a change in scope order issued during the construction period and in excess of a ceiling of \n0.25% of the Total Project Costs, will be reimbursed by the NHAI. The concession agreement \nalso stipulates the damages payable by the NHAI and Soma Isolux if the site is unavailable and \nif construction is not completed within the stipulated schedule. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  concession  agreement,  the  concessionaire, \nNHAI,  escrow  bank,  and  senior  lenders  have  to  execute  an  escrow  agreement.  The  escrow \naccount needs to be opened by the concessionaire prior to the date of financial close and date \nthe concessionaire takes over the project from  NHAI (appointed date). In accordance with the \nconcession agreement requirement, all proceeds of financial package, all toll fees relating to the \nproject  highway,  all  payments  by  the  NHAI,  insurance  proceeds,  have  to  be  deposited  by  the \nconcessionaire in the escrow account. \n \n4. \naccount: \n \n\nThe agreement specifies the following order for appropriation of deposits in the escrow \n\nEscrow Account \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nall taxes due and payable by the concessionaire; \nall  payments  relating  to  construction  of  the  project  highway,  subject  to  and  in \naccordance with the conditions, if any, set forth in the financing agreements; \nO&M  expenses,  subject  to  the  ceiling,  if  any,  set  forth  in  the  financing \nagreements; \nO&M  expenses  and  other  costs  and  expenses  incurred  by  the  NHAI  in \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  agreement,  and  certified  by  the  NHAI  as \ndue and payable to it; \nconcession fee due and payable to the NHAI; \n\n(v) \n(vi)  monthly proportionate provision of debt service due in an accounting year; \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\npremium due and payable to the NHAI; \nall payments and damages certified by the NHAI as due and payable to it by the \nconcessionaire, including repayment of revenue shortfall loan; \ndebt service in respect of subordinated debt; \nany reserve requirements set forth in the financing agreements; and \nbalance, if any, in accordance with the instructions of the concessionaire. \n\n(ix) \n(x) \n(xi) \n \n5. \nGiven the presence of revenues from the first day of the concession period, the escrow \nagreement requires that all fee and any other revenues from the project highway until COD be \ntransferred  to  an  escrow  sub-account.  Up  to  the  COD  of  the  deposits  received  in  the  sub-\naccount, the money available to Soma Isolux for use would be subject to the following: \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n33 \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nEquity of up to 10% of total project costs has been expended by Soma Isolux. \nThe disbursement from the sub-account will be the lower of (i) 50% of each debt \ntranche  disbursed  by  the  senior  lenders,  and  (ii)  funds  available  in  the  sub-\naccount. \nIf  Soma  Isolux  is  in  default  in  meeting  a  project  milestone,  then  the  fee  being \ncollected and deposited subsequent to the date of such project milestone, will be \nheld  in  a  separate  sub-account  (withheld  amount  account) for  each  day\u2019s  delay \nthereafter.  \nIf Soma Isolux is in default in meeting the project milestone immediately following \nthe defaulted milestone, the withheld amount available in the escrow sub-account \nwill  not  be  released  until  the  defaulted  milestones  have  been  achieved  and  the \nproject milestone immediately after the latest defaulted milestone, is achieved in \ntime. \nIf  Soma  Isolux,  as  certified  by  the  independent  engineer  to  the  escrow  bank, \nachieves  the  defaulted  milestone  and  also  achieves  the  immediately  following \nproject  milestone  on  schedule,  the  withheld  amount  will  be  disbursed  by  the \nescrow bank to the construction period fee escrow sub-account.  \nIf the COD, as certified by the independent engineer to the escrow bank, occurs \nafter the scheduled six-laning date solely because of concessionaire default, then \nthe withheld amount and the fee deposited (including interest on both) during the \nperiod between the scheduled six-laning date and the COD will belong to and be \ndisbursed  to  the  NHAI,  and  the  concessionaire  will  not  be  entitled  to  the  same \ndespite anything to the contrary contained in the agreement. \n\nEquity Dilution \n\nC. \n \n6. \nIn accordance with the concession agreement, the concessionaire will not undertake any \nchange in ownership without the prior approval of the NHAI. The concession agreement states \nthat the aggregate holding of the existing promoters consortium members will \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nnot decline below 51% during the construction period; \nnot decline below 33% during a period of 3 years following COD; and \nbe at least 26% or any lower proportion permitted by the NHAI thereafter until the \nend of the concession period. \n\nThe  concession  agreement  also  states  that  any  transfer  of  ownership  leading  to \n7. \nacquisition  of  more  than  15%  of  total  equity  of  the  appointed  concessionaire  or  the  company \nholding  directly  or  through  one  or  more  companies  the  equity  of  the  concessionaire,  would \nrequire the NHAI approval from the national security perspective. \n\nD. \n\n \nProject Milestones \n \nThe concesion agreement specifies that the following project milestones need to be \n\n8. \nachieved by Soma Isolux: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nProject  Milestone  I.  By  project  milestone  I,  on  the  365th  day  from  the \nappointed  date,  Soma  Isolux  should  have  commenced  construction  of  the \nproject highway and expended at least 25% of the total capital cost. \nProject  Milestone  II.  By  project  milestone  II,  on  the  730th  day  from  the \nappointed  date,  Soma  Isolux  should  have  commenced  construction  of  all \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34     Appendix 5 \n\n(iii) \n\nbridges and expended at least 65% of the total capital cost.  \nScheduled Six-Laning Date. Soma Isolux should have completed six-laning in \naccordance  with  the  concession  agreement  on  the  912th  day  from  the \nappointed date.  \n\n \n9. \nIn accordance with the concession agreement, if any of the above project milestones are \nnot  met  within  90  days  from  the  date  set  forth,  unless  such  failure  has  occurred  because  of \nforce majeure or for reasons solely attributable to the NHAI, Soma Isolux shall pay damages to \nthe  NHAI  in  a  sum  calculated  at  the  rate  of  0.1%  of  the  amount  of  performance  security  for \ndelay of each day until the milestone is achieved.  \n\n \n10. \nHowever, if the project completion date is achieved on or before the scheduled six-laning \ndate,  the  damages  paid  will  be  refunded  by  the  NHAI  to  the  concessionaire,  but  without  any \ninterest. \n \nE. \n\nProvisions  Protecting  the  Interests  of  the  Concessionaire  in  case  Traffic  is \nReduced because an Additional Tollway or Competing Road is Built \n\n \n11. \nconcessionaire in traffic is reduced because an additional tollway or competing road is laid. \n\nThe  concession  agreement  contains  provisions  to  protect  the  interests  of  the \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nNeither  the  NHAI  nor  any  government  agency  will  at  any  time  before  the  10th \nanniversary  of  the  appointed  date,  construct  or  cause  to  be  constructed  any \ncompeting  road,  provided  that  the  average  traffic  on  the  project  highway  in  any \nyear does not exceed 90% of the designed capacity. \nNeither  the  NHAI  nor  any  government  instrumentality  will  construct  or  cause  to \nbe  constructed,  any  expressway  or  other  toll  road  between,  among  others, \nkm 96.00  and  km  387.10  for  use  by  traffic  at  any  time  before  the  10th \nanniversary of the appointed date. Here, additional tollway does not include any \nexpressway 20% longer than the existing route comprising the project highway. \nIn  case  such  an  additional  tollway  or  competing  road  is  constructed,  the \nconcession  agreement  provides  that  the  user  fee  collected  from  any  vehicle  on \nthe additional tollway will at no time be less than 25% higher than the fee levied \nand collected from similar vehicles using the project highway.  \nIn case an additional tollway is opened to traffic between the 10th anniversary of \nthe appointed date and the end of the concession period, the concessionaire will \nbe entitled to an additional concession period, which shall be equal in duration to \nthe  period  between  the  opening  of  the  additional  tollway  and  the  end  of  the \nconcession period.  \nThe  NHAI  will  pay  compensation  to  the  concessionaire  in  a  sum  equal  to  the \ndifference between the realizable fee and the projected daily fee until the breach \ncaused by construction of the additional tollway is cured. \n\n \nTarget Traffic \n\nF. \n \n12. \nThe concession agreement provides for increase or decrease of the concession period \nbased  on  the  actual  traffic  on  the  project  highways,  compared  with  the  projected  traffic,  on  a \nparticular date.  \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe  concession  agreement  provides  that  the  projected  traffic  on  the  project \nhighway  on  1  January  2018  (\u201ctarget  date\u201d)  will  be  69,443  passenger  car  units \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n35 \n\n(PCU) per day (\u201ctarget traffic\u201d), and any variations will lead to modifications in the \nduration of the concession period as follows: \nFor  every  1%  shortfall,  the  concession  period  will  be  increased  by  1.5%,  up  to \n20% of the concession period. \nFor every 1% in excess, the concession period will be decreased by 0.75%, up to \n10% of the concession period. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\nDesign Capacity \n\nG. \n \n13. \nIf  the  average  daily  traffic  of  PCUs  in  any  accounting  year  exceeds  the  designed \ncapacity  of  90,000  PCUs  on  the  project  highway,  and  continues  to  exceed  this  designed \ncapacity  for  3  accounting  years  thereafter,  an  indirect  political  event  will  be  deemed  to  have \noccurred and the NHAI at its discretion may terminate the concession agreement by making a \ntermination payment in accordance with the provision of the concession agreement.  \n\nTraffic Cap \n\nH. \n \n14. \nIf the average daily traffic of PCUs in any accounting year reaches a level equivalent to \n120% of the designed capacity, the fee levied and collected from the traffic exceeding the traffic \ncap will be deemed to be due and payable to the NHAI. \n \nI. \n \n15. \nIn accordance with the concession agreement, the concessionaire can collect additional \nrevenue from the commercial advertising, display or hoarding at the toll plazas, rest areas, bus \nshelters and telephone booths located on the project highway if the advertising thereon does not \nviolate the guidelines of Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways. \n\nAdditional revenue \n\n \nChange in Law \n\nThe concession agreement provisions for change in law which means the following,: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthe enactment of any new Indian law;

The toll fee will be revised once a year as follows: \n \n\n0.60 \n1.04 \n2.08 \n3.34 \n\nBase Fee x (WPI-B/ WPI-A) x \u2026. km for one-way journey \nWPI-B  =  the  average  wholesale  price  index  available  for  the  year  ending  31  March \n\npreceding the fee revision date \n\nWPI-A = the wholesale price index on June 1997 (131.4%) \n\n \n3. \n \n\n(i) \n\nLocal Traffic. This traffic is subdivided into the following categories: \n\nb. \n\nCar or Jeep or Van. Two subcategories of users:  \na. \n\nCategory  1.  Residents  of  villages  or  towns  or  cities,  industrial  units, \nestablishments,  and  self-employed  persons  with  workplace  within  a \nradius  of  10  km  of  the  fee  collection  booth\u2014monthly  pass  of  Rs150 \nstipulated by the concession agreement. \nCategory  2.

Monthly rate of Rs1,000 stipulated by the concession agreement. \nLight Commercial Vehicle or Trucks. For plying within 20 km of the toll plaza, \nthe  concession  agreement  stipulates  a  concessional  fee  of  Rs25  per  entry  for \ntrucks and Rs15 per entry for LCV. \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n \n4. \nIf  a  vehicle  has  to  cross  this  stretch  of  national  highway  more  than  once  a  day,  the \nconcession agreement provides that the user will have the option to take a daily pass by paying \n1.5 times the corresponding rates computed from Table A7 for a one-way journey. If the vehicle \nhas to use the stretch continuously for the entire month, the concession agreement states that \nthe user may have a monthly pass upon payment of charges equal to 30 times those applicable \nfor a single trip. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n  \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nECONOMIC EVALUATION \n\n1. \nThis analysis assesses the economic viability of the expansion and improvement of the \nnational  highway  (NH)  1  toll  road  in  India.  The  evaluation  covers  the  widening  of  the  existing \nfour-lane road to a six-lane road, construction of service roads, provision of crossover facilities, \noverpasses, bridges, and other infrastructure necessary to promote the continuous flow of traffic \nand  improve  safety.  The  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs)  were  analyzed  using  the  highway \ndesign and maintenance (HDM) model. \n \nResource costs and benefits are valued in constant 2008 prices, in Indian rupees. The \n2. \ncomparison of with- and without-project scenarios over the project life determined the costs and \nbenefits.  \n \nB. \n\nProject Costs and Benefits \n\nThe time horizon of the analysis is the concession period, which is expected to begin in \n\n3.  \nNovember 2008 and end in October 2023. Construction is expected to take about 2.5 years.  \n\nC. \n\nValuation of Costs and Benefits \n\n1.  Costs \n\n4. \nThe  costs  included  are  capital  costs,  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) \ncosts, pre-operating costs, resettlement costs, and environmental mitigation costs. Capital costs \nexclude  price  escalation,  interest  during  construction,  and  taxes.  Incremental  costs  for  O&M \nwere the difference between the O&M costs expected during the project life, and the estimated \nO&M costs if the Project had not materialized. The analysis assumes that without-project O&M \ncosts are 67% of the with-project O&M costs. Resettlement and environmental mitigation costs \nare  figures  taken  from  the  social  and  environmental  impact  assessment  reports,  adjusted  to \n2008 price levels. \n  \n2.  Benefits \n\nThe  Project  will  relieve  congestion  in  114  intersections  through  overpasses  and \n5. \nvehicular  underpasses,  allowing  traffic  to  flow  more  continuously.  In  addition,  two  additional \nlanes will expand the capacity of the highway, and roughness will be reduced from 3.45 m/km to \n2.0 m/km.  The  main  effect  of  this  decongestion,  expansion,  and  improvement  will  be  faster \ntraffic flow.  \n\n6. \nThe benefits incurred from normal and generated traffic volumes are valued separately. \nNormal traffic is traffice that will use the existing highway with or without the Project. Generated \ntraffic is additional traffic that will occur only with the Project. Generated traffic is conservatively \nestimated at 20% of annual traffic growth.  \n \n7. \nSurveys  were  conducted  to  determine  the  current  level  of  traffic  on  the  highway \naccurately.  From  the  baseline  figures,  future  traffic  levels  were  estimated  using  the  expected \npopulation growth, per capita income growth, and the growth of net state domestic products as \ninputs.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSavings in VOCs and savings in the value of passenger time are the quantified benefits \n8. \nfrom this Project. Other benefits, such as reduced number of accidents, are not quantified. The \nHDM model was used to estimate savings in VOCs for seven vehicle classes. Passenger time \ncosts assume that the value of each hour spent on the road is the average income per hour in \nthe area. Passenger time costs were calculated only for cars, minibuses, and buses.  \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n41\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 September 2008) \n \n", "Currency Unit\nRe1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Indian rupee/s (Re/Rs) \n$0.023 \nRs43.25 \n", "AADT \nADB \nBCEOM \nBOT \nCOD \nCSP \nDBFO \nDSCR \nEIRR \nEPC        \nFIRR \nGDP \nHDM \nMOSRTH \nNH \nNHAI \nNHDP \nNRRP \nO&M \nPCU \nPPP \nROW \nSPV \nVOC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", " \n", " \n", "annual average daily traffic  \nAsian Development Bank \negis bceom international \nbuild\u2013operate\u2013transfer \ncommercial operations date \ncountry strategy and program \ndesign\u2013build\u2013finance\u2013operate \ndebt service coverage ratio \neconomic internal rate of return \nengineering procurement and construction \nfinancial internal rate of return  \ngross domestic product \nhighway design and maintenance \nMinistry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways \nnational highway  \nNational Highways Authority of India \nNational Highways Development Project \nnational rehabilitation and resettlement policy \noperation and maintenance \npassenger car unit \npublic\u2013private partnership \nright-of-way \nspecial purpose vehicle \nvehicle operating cost \n", " \nNOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) ends on 31 March.
