THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the additional financing of the Road Asset Management \nProject. \n \n2.  The  proposed  grant  will  help  finance  the  gap  arising  from  changes  in  financing \narrangements as well as a change in the project scope to include priority maintenance works for \nthe Southern National Ring Road of Afghanistan\u2019s regional highway from Ghazni to Kandahar, \nwhich is the economic lifeline of the country\u2019s eastern region. The additional financing will also \ninclude a capacity development component to introduce sustainable practices in road asset \nmanagement and road maintenance. The overall project will facilitate regional connectivity, \nimprove the quality and efficiency of road transport services, and promote inclusive economic \ngrowth. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Afghanistan\u2019s economy has suffered from prolonged conflict, which has destroyed the \ncountry\u2019s minimal economic infrastructure and institutions. More than 2.5 million Afghans have \nbeen driven from their homes and livelihoods. Since the fall of Taliban regime in 2001, the country \nhas received billions of dollars in international assistance, which increased the country\u2019s gross \ndomestic product fivefold to more than $20 billion since 2002. The country is beginning to recreate \nan economy that can address and sustain the needs of its people, but stable and sustainable \neconomic development is still needed. To this end, the Government of Afghanistan has developed \na range of policies and strategies with support from its development partners. However, not all of \nthem have been successfully implemented. The 2008\u20132013 Afghanistan National Development \nStrategy,1 the country\u2019s first strategy paper for poverty reduction, set the context for rebuilding the \ncountry by (i) addressing poverty through private-sector-led equitable economic growth, and  \n(ii) exploiting the economy\u2019s growth potential. \n \n4.  Afghanistan\u2019s fragile and conflict-affected situation has devastated its roads. By 1994, \nabout 80% of the 42,000-kilometer (km) network was in disrepair.2 In 2002, the government began \nmajor reconstruction programs, which focused on rebuilding damaged or destroyed roads, as well \nas rehabilitating roads that had fallen into disrepair because of a prolonged lack of maintenance. \nNearly  8,000  km  of  roads  have  been  reconstructed  or  rehabilitated.  The  government  and \ndevelopment partners have focused their efforts on reconstruction, but there is an emerging need \nto ensure the sustainability of past investments. The ongoing Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nstudy on operation and maintenance (O&M) found that 85% of the road network remains in poor \ncondition and only 50% is in serviceable, year-round condition. \n \n5.  Financial and institutional sustainability are among the main challenges Afghanistan faces \nin providing O&M for its road network. The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) has been unable to \nfully implement the various approaches proposed in its 2006\u20132013 O&M strategy that aimed to \ncreate a viable and efficient road maintenance system to keep the roads open year-round and \nallow people and goods to move safely and efficiently within Afghanistan.3 A lack of policies on \n                                                \n1  Government of Afghanistan. 2008. Afghanistan National Development Strategy. Kabul. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2003. Afghanistan's Transport Sector on the Road to Recovery. Manila. \n3  Government of Afghanistan. 2006. Operation and Maintenance Strategy. Kabul. \n   http://www.carecprogram.org/uploads/docs/AFG-Public-Works-Strategy.pdf  ", "2 \nroad user charges and O&M financing complicates these financial and institutional challenges. \nFinancially, Afghanistan is not expected to be self-reliant in the next 5 years.  Institutionally, \nAfghanistan  needs  to  address  organizational  and  human  resources  issues  from  an  O&M \nperspective. Organizationally, the mandates of the different government authorities responsible \nfor the road network must be properly delineated. Functionally, MPW lacks the specialized system \nrequired to ensure adequate and accountable operations. A tool for planning and managing road \nO&M nationally does not exist. The ad hoc approach of this system must be integrated and \nproperly developed to enable systematic planning and management of road network O&M.  \n \n6.  Realizing  the  importance  and  seriousness  of  the  issue,  Afghanistan\u2019s  development \npartners have contributed $150 million for O&M of the road network since 2011. Under the $109 \nmillion  Road  Sector  Sustainability  Program  of  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (USAID), the government and development partners have agreed on short- and \nlong-term plans. In the short term, a 5-year transfer process has been defined, with road O&M \nfunded by development partner contributions in the first year and by road user fees in the fifth \nyear. In the long term, three autonomous entities\u2014a road authority, road fund, and transportation \ninstitute\u2014will be created to ensure sector sustainability. The road authority will manage road \ndevelopment and maintenance, the road fund will provide sustainable financing for road O&M, \nand the transportation institute will train Afghan professionals and build their capacity in transport \nengineering. Apart from road development, the World Bank\u2019s $332 million National Rural Access \nProgram also allocated (i) $21 million for routine and periodic maintenance of paved and unpaved \nsecondary roads, and (ii) $1.5 million for a road network inventory. \n \n7.  Under Transport Network Development Investment Program Tranche 4,4 ADB provides \n$5 million to finance a pilot O&M subproject which aims to (i) assess MPW\u2019s overall O&M capacity, \nand (ii) develop a methodology that best suits Afghanistan and will be used in future road O&M \nprojects. The maintenance works include overlay in some sections, pothole patching, crack \nsealing, surface sealing, mill and fill, and roadside maintenance. The pilot subproject addressed \nbasic O&M issues on the first 50 km of the Kabul\u2013Jalalabad Highway (from Kabul to Surubi) by \nimproving the international roughness index (IRI) from 8\u201312 to 4\u20135.  \n \n8.   In early 2016, ADB estimated about $55.0\u201360.0 million will be needed to address the \nmaintenance work on Afghanistan\u2019s national ring road section between Kabul and Kandahar; and \nthe strategic highway section between Kabul and Jalalabad. ADB approved the current project of \n$25.5 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources on 31 October 2016 with a grant effectiveness \ndate of 5 January 2017.5 The current project was designed to (i) initiate the establishment of a \nsustainable road maintenance system for the country\u2019s major highways and (ii) develop MPW\u2019s \nO&M capacity. The project\u2019s two major components are road maintenance and a road asset \nmanagement system (RAMS). Two sections of national highways were selected for maintenance \nbecause of their economic and strategic importance: (i) Kabul\u2013Jalalabad Highway from Surubi to \nJalalabad and (ii) the Kabul\u2013Kandahar Highway from Kabul to Ghazni. The project will also \ndevelop a RAMS as the primary decision-making support tool to help MPW plan and manage \nroad O&M. ADB financed the current project through a grant of $25.5 million from its Special \nFunds resources. The government provided $500,000 in counterpart support in the form of office \nspace and staff. \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2014.

Manila (Grant 0508-AFG). \n \n ", "3 \n \n9.  The current project is performing well based on the following assessment:6 \n \n(i)  Delivery of expected outputs. The current project is on track to meet the intended \noutputs: (a) national highways in the southern region maintained and (b) O&M and \nroad  management  capacity  enhanced.  The  condition  survey  for  the  Kabul\u2013\nJalalabad  Highway  and  Kabul\u2013Ghazni  Highway  has  been  completed.  The \nengineering designs for an 85-km section of the Kabul\u2013Jalalabad Highway and a \n50-km section of the 135 km of the Kabul\u2013Ghazni Highway have been completed. \n(ii)  Implementation  progress.  The  project  is  progressing  as  scheduled.  Three \nindividual consultants for road asset management system (RAMS) namely the \nteam leader, deputy team leader, and transportation engineer have been recruited \nand mobilized in June 2017. The inception report was submitted in August 2017. \nRecruitment  of  the  remaining  RAMS  consultants  is  in  process.  The  bidding \ndocuments for procurement of civil works package 1, which covers 35 km of the \nKabul\u2013Jalalabad Highway have been reviewed and tendered. The contract award \nis expected by September 2017. The bidding documents for civil works package \n2, which covers 50 km of the Kabul\u2013Jalalabad Highway, have been completed and \nsubmitted to ADB for review. The total contract amount expected to be awarded \nby November 2017 is about $15.0 million. \n(iii)  Compliance with safeguard policy requirements. The project is category C for \nthe environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people. It focuses on \nroad maintenance within the boundaries of the right-of-way of existing carriageway \nof the Kabul\u2013Jalalabad and Kabul\u2013Ghazni highways. The project does not have \nany adverse social or environmental impacts because of the limited scale and \nscope of the maintenance works, and the use of small machinery and equipment \nfor the activities. The project complies with the ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n(iv)  Management of risks. The project has measures to manage risks. ADB has \nsupported the program management office (PMO) in preparing bidding documents \nand bid evaluation reports, and in supervising contract execution. In addition, by \ncontracting out work in small packages for national competitive bidding, ADB has \nsupported the development of the local market in Afghanistan. This follows the \nADB and the government\u2018s agreed approach on enhancing project delivery in \nAfghanistan. ADB conducted recruitment of consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time), while \nthe government negotiated and signed the contracts with the consultants. \n(v)  Project performance rating. The current project was rated on track in the project \nperformance rating from grant effectiveness up to Q2 2017. \n \n10.  The current project intends to provide MPW with a RAMS that will support objective \nplanning, improve road serviceability, and ensure cost-effective use of available resources. The \nprospect of additional financing was raised in the report and recommendation of the President for \nthe current project (footnote 5). The additional financing is needed to (i) fill the financing gap of \n$30.3 million; and (ii) include the section from Kabul to Kandahar, between Ghazni and Kandahar \nin southeastern Afghanistan, which was part of the original scope of the 2016 need assessment \nfor maintenance of the ring road.  \n                                                \n6  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "4 \n  \n11.  The additional financing will support scaling up of O&M practices. This will  include \noverloading control by providing weighbridges in the key locations of Afghanistan\u2019s regional \nhighway. It will help consolidate development outcomes by establishing sustainable road asset \nmanagement and road maintenance practices. Overall, the project meets the eligibility criteria for \nadditional financing. The additional financing will enhance the intended impact of the current \nproject by utilizing the existing implementation arrangements, achieving results quickly. \n \n12.  The overall project is in line with the strategic objectives, as described in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan (COBP), 2017\u20132019, of ensuring continual support for road network \nO&M in the short term and developing the government\u2019s O&M capacity in the long term.7 The \nCOBP  identifies  investments  in  developing  a safe, reliable,  and  efficient transport  network \nconnecting urban and rural centers as priorities for the transport sector and are in line with the \ngovernment\u2019s strategies for development of the sector. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact and outcome for the overall project will be the same as those for the current \nproject. The overall project is aligned with the following  impact: increased sustainability of \nAfghanistan\u2019s road transport sector, as highlighted in Afghanistan\u2019s O&M Strategy 2006. The \noverall project will have the following outcome: improved road connectivity and safety.8 \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The proposed additional financing will enable the expansion of the project outputs. The \nincremental outputs will be periodic and routine maintenance9 works on about 328 km of the \nSouthern National Ring Road between Ghazni and Kandahar and other locations along the \nSouthern National Ring Road as needed. The proposed additional financing activities will also \nexpand the capacity development component to include strengthening MPW\u2019s capability in \noverloading control. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n15.  The  overall  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $56.3  million,  including  taxes,  duties,  and \ncontingencies (Table 1). The estimated climate change finance (adaptation) amount is $0.48 \nmillion. \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Afghanistan, 2017\u20132019. Manila. \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n9  Routine maintenance comprises a range of small and simple activities, usually carried out at least once a year, but \nusually widely dispersed. Typical activities include roadside verge clearing and cutting back encroaching vegetation, \ncleaning of silted ditches and culverts, patching and pothole repair, and light grading or reshaping of unsealed \nsurfaces. Periodic maintenance occurs less frequently, usually after several years. Works can include re-graveling, \nresurfacing, resealing, and repairs to structures.  \n ", "5 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n \nCurrent  Additional \nItem  Amounta  Financingb  Total \nA.

The government has requested a grant10 not exceeding $30 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. ADB funding for the \nproject includes the financing of taxes and duties,11 which is justified because (i) the amount will \nnot be an excessive share of the project investment plan, and (ii) the financing of taxes and duties \nis material and relevant to the project\u2019s success. This is in line with ADB\u2019s Operations Manual.12 \nThe government's in-kind contribution to project financing will be for incremental administrative \nexpenses, communications, and office facilities, as required. The World Bank also follows this \npractice  in  Afghanistan.  The  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2.

The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Afghanistan had a high risk of debt distress \nand was therefore eligible to receive 100% of its Asian Development Fund allocation. \n11 The costs for taxes and duties include the business receipt tax estimated at 7%, the fixed tax on imports of 2%\u20137%, \nand customs duties of 2.5%\u201316.0%. These costs do not represent an excessive share of the financing plan and are \nwithin applicable country partnership strategy parameters. ADB. 2005.

The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 13). \n \n18.  The additional financing will not change any of the existing implementation arrangements. \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) will remain the executing agency; MPW, through the PMO, will be \nthe implementing agency. MPW engineers will carry out quality assurance and control of the \nmaintenance work under the supervision of the road maintenance expert engaged as part of the \nRAMS component of the current project. The condition survey of the project roads, including \nquantities and cost estimates, is being prepared as part of tranche 4 of the Transport Network \nDevelopment Investment Program (footnote 4). \n \n19.  Procurement financed by the ADB grant will be undertaken in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines. Advance contracting is proposed to improve project readiness. The \nadditional financing will be used for variations of the ongoing consulting contracts under the RAMS \ncomponent of the current project. The consultants, who are familiar with the work and challenges \nin a country classified as a fragile and conflict-affected situation, will continue to supervise the \nadditional financing component. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2018\u2013June 2021 \nEstimated completion  June 2021 (estimated grant closing date: 31 December 2021) \ndate \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance \n(ii) Implementing  Ministry of Public Works \nagency \n(iii) Implementation unit  Program management office, 35 staff \nConsulting services  Individual  107 person-months  $1.0 million \nconsultants  (30 person-months \ninternational, 77 \nperson-months \nnational) \n ", "7 \nAspects  Arrangements \nProcurement  International  1 contract  $2.5 million  \ncompetitive bidding \n(goods) \nNational  6 contracts  $24.0 million \ncompetitive bidding \n(civil works) \nRetroactive financing  Advance contracting will be applied for civil works and consulting \nand/or advance  services.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  An initial assessment of pavement conditions along the Southern National Ring Road \nindicates varying surface quality, with IRI between 8 and 12 in most sections. This is well below \nthe acceptable technical standards, which suggest that roughness along a route of this kind \nshould be within an IRI range of 4\u20135.14 The proposed maintenance along this route will address \nthe pavement deficiencies identified and improve ride quality, pavement life, and overall safety. A \nteam of local engineers with the support of MPW\u2019s O&M department will conduct the condition \nsurvey of the project roads, including quantities and cost estimates, as part of tranche 4 of the \nTransport Network Development Investment Program (footnote 4). It is expected to be completed \nin December 2017. The detailed maintenance and repair methodology will be based on the \noriginal methodology developed under the pilot O&M subproject and implemented in the current \nproject. \n \n21.  Preliminary climate risk screening shows that the project\u2019s climate change risk is medium, \neven  though  the  project  scope  only  includes  partial  overlay  and  repair  of  pavement.  The \ndevelopment of awareness of climate risks and knowledge of mitigation measures for the road \nproject design will be considered as part of the RAMS component in the current project. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  The project will help achieve the envisaged benefits of an improved transport corridor, \nincluding lower transport costs and shorter travel times. The economic evaluation of the project \nwas undertaken using ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects15 and followed the \nanalytical framework of the highway development and management model.16 The traffic forecast \nis based on traffic counts on the project road in early 2015.

Paris. \n \n ", "8 \ntraffic volume, annual normal traffic growth is forecast at 3% for 2018\u20132040. Project costs and \nbenefits are calculated based on a comparison of with- and without-project scenarios. The \neconomic costs are (i) capital cost, including physical contingencies, but excluding taxes; and (ii) \nO&M, notably the cost of periodic maintenance assumed to be undertaken at 6-year intervals. \nThe economic benefits are savings in vehicle operating costs resulting from the improved project \nroad and time savings. The results of the economic analysis show that the project is economically \nfeasible with an estimated economic internal rate of return of 44.9%. This confirms ADB\u2019s \nexperience with maintenance projects, which tend to generate high economic returns. Sensitivity \ntests confirmed that the project would remain viable if the envisaged project costs increase or \nbenefits were reduced. No financial analysis was undertaken because the project road will not \ngenerate revenue. \n \n23.  The current project intended to address two financial sustainability concerns: the lack of \nan effective O&M regime and a chronic shortage of O&M funds. In the next 5 years, government \nfunding for maintenance is unlikely to meet the requirements to preserve the value of the road \nassets. The government would have to raise about $251 million annually to meet the maintenance \nneeds of its core road network. In 2015 the government collected $83 million through road user \nfees and taxes, but more needs to be done. Given the country\u2019s narrow economic base, fragile \nsecurity situation, and competing demands for scarce budget resources, Afghanistan is not \nexpected to be financially self-reliant and will need to rely on contributions from development \npartners to finance road maintenance. Accordingly, development partners should balance their \nassistance between investments and O&M support. An increase in O&M funds is necessary but \nnot sufficient to ensure road asset sustainability. Institutional strengthening to create sufficient \ncapacity for managing future maintenance will be developed as part of the current project and in \nconjunction with the overall project. \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  Governance is a major challenge in Afghanistan. The project has been designed to \nmitigate these risks, especially in the areas of financial management and procurement. An \nupdated financial management assessment of MPW and its PMO took into consideration their \noverall capacity, including funds-flow arrangements, governance, staffing, budgeting, accounting \nand financial reporting systems, internal control procedures, financial information systems, and \ninternal  and  external  auditing  arrangements.  This  assessment  found  that,  from  a  financial \nmanagement perspective, the overall control risk is moderate. MPW and PMO have adequate \nexperience and capacity in financial management to manage the project funds as well as \nadequate funds flow, accounting systems, and budgeting arrangements. The 2015 restructuring \nof the PMO significantly improved its overall capacity. The PMO\u2019s finance department staff \nincludes a manager, five accountants, and a trainee. MPW conducts internal audits periodically, \nand annual external audits have yielded satisfactory results since ADB\u2019s engagement with MPW \nin 2003. MPW is responsible for ensuring an adequate audit trail; the annual financial statements \nare audited by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB in accordance with auditing standards. \n \n25.  Improvement  is  needed  in  accounting  policies  and  procedures  and  reporting  and \nmonitoring. In accounting policies and procedures, the PMO has been using a manual book \naccounting  approach,  which  is  inferior  to  modern  accounting  software.  The  PMO  has \ndemonstrated the capacity to monitor and report project finances based on ADB requirements. \nHowever, the submission of some project financial statements has been delayed. Thus, the \nupdated financial management assessment recommended that (i) modern accounting software \nbe procured and installed as soon as possible so that PMO staff can be trained to use it; and (ii) \nan international financial management specialist be recruited to help PMO staff conduct financial \n ", "9 \nmanagement, ensuring that the audited project financial statements are submitted in a timely \nmanner. Financial management risks and risk mitigation measures will be reviewed and updated \nthroughout the project\u2019s life. \n \n26.  All goods and works will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, \nand all consulting services will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. ADB agreed to the government\u2019s request to recruit the individual consultants, which \nwill ensure the transparency of the procurement process and mitigate the risk of delays. MPW will \nremain responsible for negotiating and signing the contracts, issuing the notice to proceed, and \nsupervising  the  contracts.  This  is  consistent  with  the  agreement  between  ADB  and  the \ngovernment of Afghanistan on the approach to enhance project delivery and the objective of \nADB\u2019s policy on additional financing to promote efficiency gains through timely and seamless \ntransition from project preparation to implementation. The policy requirements and measures are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 13). \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, MOF, and MPW. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 13). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  The poverty and social assessment conducted for the project revealed the extent of \npoverty in the country, including (i) food insecurity affecting one-third of the population, (ii) a lack \nof access to improved water resources, and (iii) limited access to education and health services. \nThe gender assessment revealed high maternal and infant mortality rates, limited mobility of \nwomen compared with that of men, and overall low status of women. While the project\u2019s long-\nterm impact is expected to improve women\u2019s physical access to education, health, and other \nservices by shortening travel times and making roads safer, these are indirect benefits. The \nproject will promote equal work pay for men and women. The project is categorized as no gender \nelements. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  All three safeguard categories are categorized as C since (i) no land acquisition or \ninvoluntary resettlement is required, as the maintenance work will be carried out within the right-\nof-way of existing roads; (ii) no indigenous peoples, as defined by ADB for operational purposes, \nlive within the project area; and (iii) the environmental impact will be minimal, not requiring \nmitigation actions. Thus, no land acquisition and resettlement plan, indigenous peoples plan, or \ninitial environment assessment and environmental monitoring plan will be required. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  The major residual risk is the political stability of the country, which has led to security \nthreats to development operations. With the proposed mitigation measures, the overall risk \nassessment is moderate, while the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the \ncosts. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.17 \n \n                                                \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nImplementation of periodic maintenance  Development partners are helping the government to \nhas been limited by weak capacity and  create a road authority, road fund, and transportation \ninadequate  budget  flows,  resulting  in  institute.
