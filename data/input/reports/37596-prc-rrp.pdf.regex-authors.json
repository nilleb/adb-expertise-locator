An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nAssessment  undertaken.  The  summary  EIA  was  circulated  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Board  of  Directors  on  6  January \n2006 and uploaded on the ADB web site on 10 January 2006. \n   \nProject Description  The Guangxi Nanning Urban Environmental Upgrading Project (the \nProject) is a key urban environmental improvement initiative of the \nNanning municipal government (NMG) which aims to enhance the \nurban  environment  and  public  health  in  Nanning  City.  The \nincidence of waterborne and vector-borne diseases is expected to \nbe reduced by 10% from the 2004 level. The Project comprises \nfour  subprojects:  (i) Xinxujiang  River  environmental  upgrading, \nwhich will reduce flood risk, improve wastewater management, and \nexpand the green environment in the area along Xinxujiang River; \n(ii) Kelijiang River environmental upgrading, which will reduce flood \nrisk,  improve  wastewater  management,  and  expand  the  green \nenvironment in the area along Kelijiang River within Xiangsihu New \nDistrict; (iii) solid waste management, which will strengthen the \ndomestic  solid  waste  management  capacity  and  improve \ncleanliness of the streets; and (iv) Qingxiushan Park ecological \nupgrading, which will improve the environmental conditions and \nfacilities of the park, a major tourism and recreational amenity in \nNanning City, and thereby contribute to improvement of the city\u2019s \nair quality, promote tourism, and increase people\u2019s awareness of \nenvironmental  protection.  The  Project  will  provide  institutional \ncapacity building and training on project management, operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M)  of  project  facilities,  and  sustainable \nfinancial management of the implementing agencies (IAs).  \n \nRationale  Nanning is the capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region \n(GZAR).  Nanning\u2019s  economic  growth  has  lagged  behind  other \ncoastal regions in the PRC but it has experienced rapid economic \ngrowth during the last two decades. The annual growth rate of 12% \nfor 2003\u20132004 was higher than the national average of 9.8%. The \nurban  population  has  increased  from  1.0  million  in  1995  to \n1.5 million in 2004, and is expected to grow further to 2.1 million in \n2010 and 3.0 million in 2020. \n ", "iv   \n  Nanning  is  currently  addressing  three  major  development \nopportunities: (i) its role as a gateway to the landlocked provinces \nof the southwestern region of the PRC, (ii) its designation as a \ntarget city under the Government\u2019s Western Region Development \nStrategy,  and  (iii)  its  role  as  a  gateway  to  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN). \n \nTo  accelerate  social  and  economic  development,  improve  the \nquality  of  life  for  urban  residents,  and  upgrade  the  urban \nenvironment,  the  provision  of  basic  infrastructure  and  services \nneeds to be expanded and upgraded in Nanning City. The Project \nwill  reduce  water  and  soil  pollution  through  flood  control  and \nwastewater  and  solid  waste  management  (brown  issues),  and \nimprove the quality of life of urban residents by increasing green \nspace (green issues). \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project is to enhance the urban environment and \npublic health in Nanning City through (i) improved flood control, \n(ii) improved  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management,  and \n(iii) expanded green environment. The outcome of the Project will \nbe  improved  urban  environmental  management  in  Nanning  by \n2010 through (i) reducing the flood risk to no more than 5% annual \nprobability in Xinxujiang and Kelijiang rivers within Xiangsihu New \nDistrict; (ii) upgrading the water quality from worse than class V to \nclass  IV  in  Xinxujiang  River  and  class  III  in  Kelijiang  River; \n(iii) improving efficiency in solid waste management; (iv) reducing \nsolid wastes and general dirt in city streets; (v) expanding green \nspace  by  0.5  square  meters  (m2)  per  capita  per  year;  and \n(vi) increasing public awareness of environmental protection. \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at the equivalent of \n$262.6 million, including taxes and duties of $8.2 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million equivalent) \nSource  Total Cost  % \nAsian Development Bank  100.0  38.1 \nNanning Municipal Government  151.6  57.7 \nLocal Bank Loans    11.1  4.2 \nTotal  262.6  100.0 \nNote: Columns may not add up because of rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n  ADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  the  equivalent  of  $100.0  million, \ncovering about 38.1% of the total project cost, including financial \ncharges  during  construction  on  the  loan.  The  Government  will \nprovide about 61.9% of the total project cost. Counterpart funding \nwill be financed by the NMG\u2019s wastewater tariff, solid waste tariff, \ncity construction and maintenance tax, and special fiscal funds. \nCommercial financing from domestic banks will provide additional \nfunding. \n   ", "  v\nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $100.0 million from the ordinary capital resources of ADB \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The  PRC  will  make  proceeds  of  the  loan  available  to  the \nTerms  government of the GZAR. The government of the GZAR will make \nproceeds of the loan available to NMG, which will onlend to the \nrespective IAs. All subloans and onlending will be on the same \nterms and conditions as the ADB loan. The IAs will assume the \nforeign exchange and interest rate variation risks for ADB\u2019s loan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Nanning Municipal Government \n \nImplementation  NMG has established a project steering committee (PSC) headed \nArrangements  by  the  vice  mayor.  The  PSC  will  be  responsible  for  project \ncoordination  and  policy  guidance  during  implementation.  The \nproject  management  office  (PMO)  for  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  established  within  the  Nanning  Financial \nBureau will continue as the PMO for the Project. The PMO will \nserve as the secretariat of the PSC and will be responsible for \ncoordinating implementation of project activities. \n   \nProcurement  ADB-financed equipment, materials and goods, and services will \nbe procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \nProcurement  will  be  coursed  through  international  competitive \nbidding, national competitive bidding, or shopping procedures as \ndetermined  by  the  particular  circumstances  of  each  contract \npackage.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines, \nforeign  contractors  may  participate  in  bidding  for  national \ncompetitive bidding contracts. \n \nConsulting Services  The loan will finance about 32 person-months of international and \n94 person-months of domestic consulting services to support the \nPMO and IAs in project implementation and management, and \ninstitutional capacity building. The consultants will cover (i) project \nmanagement and implementation support; (ii) efficient operating \nprocedures;  (iii)  preventive  maintenance;  (iv)  financial \nmanagement; (v) social,  resettlement,  and environmental impacts \nmonitoring;  (vi)  business  planning and  management  information \nsystem  development;  (vii)  human  resources  development;  and \n(viii) corporate governance. The consultants will assist the  PMO in \n ", "vi   \n  questions related to ADB procedures and reporting, procurement, \nquality  control,  start-up  testing,  commissioning,  O&M,  and \nimplementation of the project performance monitoring system. The \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and its \nBorrowers.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will significantly improve water quality in Xinxujiang \nBeneficiaries  River and Kelijiang River, enhance the safety of drinking water \nsources in downstream Yongjiang River, and protect the quality of \ngroundwater,  especially  in  shallow  aquifers.  The  Project  will \nconvert current environmental hot spots affected by uncontrolled \nwastewater  and  solid  waste  discharges  in  the  Xinxujiang  and \nKelijiang  rivers  into  model  green  areas,  improving  the  city\u2019s \nenvironmental  conditions  and  aesthetics.  The  Project  will  also \nenhance the quality of the urban environment by increasing carbon \ndioxide  absorption  and  oxygen  release,  through  ecological \nupgrading  of  Qingxiushan  Park.  The  Project  will  improve  the \nenvironmental potential of Qingxiushan Park by (i) increasing the \ntotal  biomass  and  forest  coverage  rate,  (ii)  protecting  and \ndiversifying forest species and promoting research to ensure forest \nsustainability, (iii) enhancing soil conservation, and (iv) promoting \npublic awareness programs for park visitors. \n \nThe Project will benefit about 3.03 million residents, of which about \n217,000 (7.2%) are poor. The improved urban environment will \nprovide  an  enabling  environment  for  poverty  reduction  through \n(i) reduction  of  the  incidence  of  infectious  and  waterborne  and \nvector-borne diseases, (ii) improvement of investment conditions to \nattract more outside investment for local development, (iii) creation \nof  new  job  opportunities,  and  (iv)  development  of  the  tourism \nindustry. As a result, the population exposed to waterborne and \nvector-borne diseases will be reduced, and the associated medical \ncosts  and  number  of  workdays  and  school  days  lost  due  to \nsickness will be cut. Savings in medical costs will be greater for the \npoor,  families  with  children,  and  the  elderly,  as  they  are  most \nvulnerable to such diseases. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  Potential risks include (i) inadequate wastewater treatment and \nsolid waste disposal capacities at the required time because of \ndelays in the second phase of the Jiangnan wastewater treatment \nplant upgrading and the Chengnan landfill site improvement by \nNMG,  and  the  Nanning  city  sewerage  upgrading  by  the  World \nBank; (ii) possible delays in increasing the solid waste tariff and \ntariff  collection  rate;  (iii)  lack  of  customers\u2019  willingness  to  pay \nincreased tariffs; (iv) lack of proper O&M of the project facilities; \n(v) lack  of  IAs\u2019  capacity  to  carry  out  their  responsibilities; \n(vi) discontinuation  of  enforcement  of  environmental  standards; \n(vii)  change  in  existing  pollution  control  measures;  (viii) lack  of \nsupport from all levels of government agencies concerned; (ix) \ndelays  in  land  acquisition  and resettlement;  and (x)  unforeseen ", "  vii\n  difficult  construction  conditions.  Risk  (i)  is  being  mitigated  by \nsynchronizing the project design and implementation schedules. \nRisks (ii) and (iii) are being mitigated by ensuring financial and \nmanagerial autonomy for the solid waste management company, \nand conducting public consultations to obtain public support for the \ntariff increase. Risks (iv) and (v) will be mitigated through provision \nof institutional capacity building for the IAs. Risks (vi), (vii), and \n(viii) will be mitigated through regular project reviews. Risks (ix) \nand  (x)  will  be  mitigated  through  support  from  the  project \nmanagement consultants and regular project monitoring. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Guangxi  Nanning  Urban  Environmental \nUpgrading Project (the Project). \n \n2.  The Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help improve the \nurban environment in Nanning City, the capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region \n(GZAR)  by  reducing  flood  risks,  improving  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management,  and \nexpanding the green environment. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy1 and will \nhelp  the  PRC  achieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  of  environmental \nsustainability and increased access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. This report is \nbased on the findings of the Loan Appraisal Mission and discussions with the central and local \ngovernments, relevant agencies, and community organizations. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  The  urban  population  in  the  PRC  grew  from  about  190  million  in  1980  to  almost \n524 million, about 40% of the total population, in 2004. This urbanization trend is expected to \ncontinue and about 700 million people, equivalent to 50% of the population, will live in cities by \n2030.2 Rapid economic growth over the last two decades has created tremendous pressure on \nnatural  resources  including  land,  water,  and  forests.  Increasing  demand  for  basic  urban \ninfrastructure  has  exceeded  the  financial  and  physical  capacity  of  most  cities  to  provide \nadequate sanitation services. In 2004, about 32.6 billion cubic meters (m3) of wastewater was \ngenerated and discharged in the PRC, of which only about 45.7% was treated. Much of the solid \nwaste  is  disposed  in  natural  depressions  or  open  dumps  without  adequate  environmental \nsafeguards. This has accelerated the pollution of rivers, lakes, and underground aquifers; and \nhas degraded the urban environment. \n  \n4.  The Government has prioritized environmental protection and pollution control in its \ndevelopment  strategy.3 It  has  enacted  several  environmental  laws,  including  those  on  the \nprevention  or  control  of  pollution  of  air  and  water.  These  laws  and  ancillary  regulations \nemphasize  initial  prevention  and  then  the  polluter  pays  principle  during  environmental \nmanagement.  Two  key  legal  requirements  are  well  established:  (i)  prior  evaluation  of  the \nenvironmental  impact  of  projects;  and  (ii)  the  principle  that  the  design,  construction,  and \noperation of a project should be carried out simultaneously with the design, construction, and \noperation of the associated environmental protection measures. The Government has issued a \nseries of laws on the use of natural resources and has instituted a system of monitoring, \nrecording, and reporting the discharge of pollutants. The laws stipulate administrative, civil, and \ncriminal responsibilities for environmental violations. \n \n5.  Nanning has been the capital of the GZAR, located in the southwestern region of the \nPRC, since 1958. The economic development of Nanning started from a relatively low level with \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n2  The Government\u2019s long-term vision for development was set out during the 16th Party Congress and reiterated \nduring the 10th National People\u2019s Congress. \n3  State Environmental Protection Administration. 2002. \u201cThe National Tenth Five-Year Plan for Environmental \nProtection\u201d. Beijing. ", "2 \ngross domestic product (GDP) less than CNY100 million in 1950. Compared with other coastal \nregions in the PRC, Nanning\u2019s economic growth has lagged behind. However, during the last \ntwo decades, Nanning has experienced rapid economic growth. Its GDP reached CNY59 billion \nin 2004 compared with only CNY3 billion in 1985. The annual growth rate of 12% for 2003\u20132004 \nwas  higher  than  the  national  average  of  9.8%.  The  urban  population  has  increased  from \n1.0 million in 1995 to 1.5 million in 2004, and is expected to grow further to 2.1 million in 2010 \nand 3.0 million in 2020. Nanning is currently addressing three major development opportunities: \n(i) its role as a gateway to the landlocked provinces of the southwestern region of the PRC, \n(ii) its  designation  as  a  target  city  under  the  Government\u2019s  Western  Region  Development \nStrategy, and (iii) its role as a gateway to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \ncountries.4 \n \n6.  The provision of basic infrastructure and services has not kept pace with increased \ndemand. This has led to deterioration in the quality of life for urban residents, degradation of the \nurban environment, and inefficient economic development. The Nanning municipal government \n(NMG) aims to relieve pressure on the city\u2019s existing central commercial areas by further \ndevelopment,  aimed  at  high-tech  research  and  manufacturing  outputs  together  with  the \nassociated residential accommodation. The areas identified to benefit from this urban expansion \nare those (i) presently at risk of seasonal flooding, (ii) in need of basic infrastructure services to \nremove existing point sources of pollution and provide for future wastewater discharges, and \n(iii) requiring an increase in solid waste collection points for transfer of waste to disposal. The \ndevelopment of Xiangsihu New District falls into three areas of activity: (i) public infrastructure, \n(ii) institutional buildings, and (iii) commercial and domestic accommodation. The Project will \nsupport the first area. The second area will be developed by NMG. The third area will be \npredominantly developed through private sector initiatives that NMG will actively pursue and \nencourage. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n7.  The major urban environmental issues in Nanning are (i) inadequate flood protection \nmeasures for the newly urbanized areas, (ii) lack of wastewater and solid waste management \nfacilities and inefficiency in its management, and (iii) degradation of the green environment \nthroughout the city and in Qingxiushan Park. The Government needs assistance to achieve the \nMDGs for environmental sustainability (Goal 7) and to halve the proportion of people without \nsustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 (Target 10). \n \n1.  Nanning City Master Plan \n \n8.  The  Nanning  Urban  Master  Plan  for  2004\u20132020  indicates  that  the  city\u2019s  urban \ndevelopment will follow the \u201cone axis and two strips\u201d model \u2014 one axis along Yongjiang River \nincluding Xiangsihu New District;5 one strip of north and west ecological protection; and one \nstrip of south ecological protection \u2014 that will form the multi-center urban space system of \u201cone \ncenter, two subcenters, and multi-cores\u201d. The urban area of Nanning City will expand both west \nand east. \n \n9.  To  the  east,  newly  urbanized  areas  are  either  under  construction  or  already  well \ndeveloped. In the short term, the eastern development outwards to the ring expressway will be \n                                                 \n4  Nanning City has been nominated as the permanent host city of the annual China-ASEAN Exposition. It has \nrecently become a member of the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n5  Xiangsihu  New  District  is  a  new  development  zone  identified  by  the  NMG,  which  covers  more  than  one \nadministrative district rather than an administrative district. \n ", "3 \ndelayed because of the shortage of capital for infrastructure upgrading. Further development to \nthe east will put huge fiscal pressure on NMG. However, to the west, Xiangsihu New District is \nan ideal new area for future urban development of Nanning City because of (i) high-value land \nreserve; (ii) convenient transportation to the city center; and (iii) highly developed education, \nscience, and technology establishments. In addition, to meet the time schedule of integrated \nand balanced development of Nanning City, urban development priority is to accelerate the \nconstruction of Xiangsihu New District. \n \n10.  The total area of 120 square kilometers (km2) of the whole Xiangsihu New District is \nequivalent to the current size of Nanning City. From an economic development perspective, this \nnew  district  has  a  concentration  of  a  number  of  economic  entities  including  a  high-tech \ndevelopment zone, and most of the higher education colleges and universities in the city. From \nthe social development perspective, the new district will soften the competition for land use in \nthe existing central areas of the city. The planned development of Xiangsihu New District will \nturn this district into a subcenter of the city with science and technology companies, education \ninstitutions, and residential accommodation. \n \n2.  Project Rationale \n \n11.  Xinxujiang and Kelijiang rivers are located in the western part of the city, and flow into \nYongjiang River. Both rivers are characterized by shallow channels and wide terracing. Flood \ncontrol measures undertaken by NMG in respect of Yongjiang River have prevented surcharge \nflooding into the Xinxujiang and Kelijiang catchments to a certain extent, but existing flood \nprotection  facilities  are  not  sufficient  to  protect  Xiangsihu  New  District  from  5%  annual \nprobability of flooding. \n \n12.  Xinxujiang and Kelijiang river basins overlap with part of Xiangsihu New District, which is \ncurrently a peri-urban area, and infrastructure development is lagging behind. Wastewater is \ndischarged into the nearest watercourses in the Xinxujiang and Kelijiang catchments through a \ncombined sewerage system and is not treated. This creates gross pollution in Xinxujiang River \nand Kelijiang River. The current pollution level is worse than class V of the national water quality \nstandard.6 NMG has a target to increase the collection and treatment of domestic wastewater in \nthe city to 70% by 2010 and 90% by 2020,7 and thus achieve class III or IV water quality in city\u2019s \nrivers, including Xinxujiang River and Kelijiang River. Water quality improvement in Xinxujiang \nand Kelijiang rivers will contribute to protection of water quality around raw water intakes located \ndownstream along Yongjiang River. While wastewater treatment plants and trunk mains are \nbeing developed, sewer networks need to be expanded in Xiangsihu New District. \n \n13.  Currently, domestic solid waste is collected from households manually using bicycles \nwith carts, offloaded to containers at the transfer stations, and transported by road to the landfill \nsite. The efficiency of the solid waste management system would be significantly increased by \nupgrading  the  transfer  stations  to  include  effective  compaction,  increasing  the  number  of \ntransfer stations, and introducing an operational management control system to improve the \nefficiency of waste transfer. Street sweeping is undertaken manually. The increase in the urban \n                                                 \n6  The PRC environmental quality standards have five classes for surface water quality based on their use. Class I is \nthe best in quality and class V is the worst. Class I is for water resources and nationally protected water bodies. \nClass II is for high-value fish protection areas, class A protection areas, and spawning habitats for fish. Class III is \nfor potable water resources, class B protection areas, general fish protection areas, and swimming areas. Class IV \nis for general industrial water sources and noncontact recreational areas. Class V is suitable only for industrial use. \n7  In accordance with the national directives. \n ", "4 \nroad area and the introduction of higher-speed dual carriageways have created a safety hazard, \nand advanced mechanized techniques are needed. \n \n14.  Qingxiushan Park is located in the immediate southeast of Nanning. The total area of the \npark is 21.7 km2, of which the forest cover is currently 2.9 km2. Qingxiushan Park is a major \ntourism and recreational amenity in Nanning, attracting 70% of its visitors from outside the city. \nVisitors enjoy walking and hiking in the forest and pray at the temple inside the park. The forest \nin Qingxiushan Park contributes to air quality improvement by increasing the carbon holding and \nreleasing  more  oxygen.  Nanning  City  has  been  declared  the  \u201cgarden  city\u201d  by  the  state \ngovernment.8 NMG endeavors to increase the current 8.1 square meters (m2) of green space \nper capita by 0.5 m2 each year. Qingxiushan Park has been and will continue to be the major \ncontributor to achieve this target. The problems facing Qingxiushan Park have natural causes: \n(i) frequent and periodic fires damage trees and wildlife habitat, (ii) monsoon rains result in \nerosion and loss of soils, and (iii) wastewater generated in the park and discharged through \nseptic tanks to open water ditches within the park contaminates groundwater. Visitors pay an \nentrance fee, and trees and flowers produced in the park are sold mainly for greening of \nNanning City. These revenues are used for management of the park and will fund part of the \nProject. The Nanning Qingxiu Mountain Scenic and Resort Development Company has legal \npower to enforce adequate protection of the park within its charter. \n \n3.  Policy Dialogue \n \n15.  Policy dialogue on key reforms is a significant aspect of ADB\u2019s operations in the PRC in \nwater  supply,  sanitation,  and  waste  management.  Significant  progress  has  been  made  in \n(i) introducing tariff and enterprise reforms, (ii) strengthening the local and regulatory framework, \nand (iii) promoting private sector participation. ADB has supported the tariff reform process \nthrough two technical assistance (TA) projects9 which have contributed significantly to water \ntariff reforms and resources conservation. These were followed by ADB\u2019s urban wastewater \ntariff study TA,10 under which the national guidelines for wastewater tariffs were developed. The \nguidelines include tariff calculation methodologies that will allow full cost recovery, taking into \nconsideration  affordability  and  social  constraints.  The  TA  also  recommended  options  for \nencouraging multichannel investment, including private sector participation in urban wastewater \nmanagement. In addition, ADB supported the Government through a TA that strengthened \npolicy reform on the use of market-based instruments to enhance private sector partnership in \npublic utilities, mainly for water supply, and wastewater and solid waste management.11 \n \n16.  The  Project  will  build  on  and  continue  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  on \n(i) sustainable flood control and river basin management, (ii) reduction of flood risk maintaining \nwater  quality,  (iii)  wastewater  management  and  reduction  of  open  watercourse  pollution, \n(iv) comprehensive solid waste management, (v) cost recovery and tariff reform, and (vi) poverty \nreduction. \n \n17.  Strengthening of the legal framework for sound environmental management has been a \nkey element of ADB\u2019s policy dialogue and operational activities. To help build the necessary \n                                                 \n8  The criteria for the \u201cgarden city\u201d include green space of (i) more than 6.5 square meters (m2) per capita, and \n(ii) more than 30% of the total city area. \n9  ADB. 1997.

Manila. \n ", "5 \ncapacity, ADB provided training for staff of the Environmental Protection Commission of the \nNational People\u2019s Congress, and developed a legal information system to support drafting the \nenvironmental laws. In the area of legislation, assistance was provided to help amend the \n(i) water pollution prevention and control law which was passed in 1996, (ii) antidesertification \nlaw passed in 2001, and (iii) a clean production law which is under consideration by the National \nPeople\u2019s Congress.12 In addition, ADB helped upgrade the knowledge and skills of provincial \nlegislative drafters in reviewing, amending, and formulating local legislation on protection and \nconservation of the environment and natural resources. ADB helped improve the institutional \ncapacity of the State Environmental Protection Administration and its provincial bureaus to \nstrengthen environmental standards and to enforce environmental laws and policies. \n \n18.  Flood events in rapidly growing cities damage high-value urban property; disrupt key \nindustrial, commercial, and government centers; and have high recovery costs. The current \nflood control system in the PRC emphasizes the use of structural measures to reduce flood \nhazards, which are essential to improve security for those living and working in flood-prone \nareas. Nonstructural approaches are also increasingly used to mitigate flood risks\u2014including \ndata  acquisition,  flood  forecasting,  flood  warning,  and  response  procedures\u2014to  reduce \nexposure and vulnerability to floods. The development of flood protection measures for flood \naffected cities is a local government responsibility. Plans have been prepared for a range of \nstructural and nonstructural works within the city\u2019s jurisdiction. However, plans need to be \nassessed within the overall framework of the river basin development and in line with the \nnational policy on integrated flood management. Specifically, monitoring in the project area \nshould be integrated in the real-time modeling of river flows and flood routing for the Pearl River \nsystem which covers the project area (Assurance ii a); and the rehabilitation of the reservoir, \nlocated at the upper stream of the project area, should be completed by the time of the \ncompletion of the physical works under the Project (Assurance ii b).  \n \n19.  Currently, urban district governments are responsible for collection and transfer of solid \nwaste  to  the  landfill  site  while  the  Nanning  Sanitation  and  Administration  Department  is \nresponsible for operation and management of the landfill site. Lack of coordination between \ndistrict governments causes inefficiency in transferring solid waste from the transfer stations to \nthe landfill site. Establishment of a transfer system covering six urban districts will be considered \nfor future improvement. NMG will introduce an operational management control system under \nthe Project to improve the efficiency of waste transfer to maximize the efficiency of solid waste \nmanagement [paragraph 28 (vi)]. \n \n4.  Lessons Learned \n \n20.  ADB has financed 57 TA grants and provided 16 loans totaling about $1,977 million to \naddress  issues  relating  to  the  urban  development  and  environment  sector  in  the  PRC \n(Appendix 2). ADB\u2019s assistance in these sectors has resulted in more rational pricing of water, \nmajor increases in water tariffs, introduction of wastewater tariffs, implementation of commercial \nprinciples, and introduction of private sector participation. These improvements are fundamental \nfor making the wastewater management and water supply sector financially and operationally \nsustainable. \n \n21.  Lessons learned from ADB\u2019s experience in the urban development and environment \nsector were considered in policy dialogue with the Government, engineering design of the \n                                                 \n12  ADB.  1994.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Legislative  Reform  for  Protecting \nEnvironment and Natural Resources. Manila.  \n ", "6 \nproject facilities, and institutional capacity building programs. One of the lessons learned is the \nneed  for  strategic  master  plans.  Since  the  Project  covers  various  subsector  components, \nextensive policy dialogue was held with the Government on the related master plans, including \nthe (i) overall city master plan, (ii) river basin management and flood control master plan, \n(iii) wastewater  management  plan,  and  (iv)  solid  waste  management  master  plan.  It  was \nconfirmed that each project component is in line with the respective master plan. A second \nmajor issue is the importance of cost recovery and tariff reform. These were discussed as part \nof the policy dialogue and it was agreed that the wastewater and solid waste tariff would be \nreviewed during project implementation to improve cost recovery. A third lesson learned is that \nincreased  public  awareness  is  one  of  the  most  effective  measures  to  improve  the  urban \nenvironment. In view of this, provision of public awareness training on environmental protection \nhas been included under the Project. A lesson related to resettlement is the need for the \nestablishment  of  an  effective  internal  and  external  monitoring  mechanism  of  resettlement \nimplementation. Arrangements for monitoring and evaluation have been fully incorporated in the \nresettlement plans. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n22.  The impact of the Project is to enhance the urban environment and public health in \nNanning  City  through  (i)  improved  flood  control,  (ii)  improved  solid  waste  and  wastewater \nmanagement, and (iii) expanded green environment. The incidence of waterborne and vector-\nborne diseases is expected to be reduced by 10% from the 2004 level. The outcome of the \nProject will be improved urban environmental management in Nanning by 2010 by (i) reducing \nthe flood risk to no more than 5% annual probability in Xinxujiang and Kelijiang rivers within \nXiangsihu New District; (ii) upgrading the water quality from worse than class V to class IV in \nXinxujiang  River  and  class  III  in  Kelijiang  River;  (iii)  improving  efficiency  in  solid  waste \nmanagement; (iv) reducing solid wastes and general dirt in city streets; (v) expanding green \nspace by 0.5 m2 per capita per annum; and (vi) increasing public awareness of environmental \nprotection. \n \nB.

The Kelijiang River environmental upgrading subproject will reduce flood risk, improve \nwastewater management, and expand the green environment in the area along Kelijiang River \n ", "7 \nof 1.64 km2. This subproject will (i) construct and rehabilitate 14.9 km of embankment; (ii) create \na permanent lake (Xiangsihu Lake) by dredging and embankment with a normal retaining \ncapacity of 4.38 million m3 and additional wet season flood storage capacity of 5.42 million m3; \n(iii) install 47.75 km of sewerage pipelines, 2 pumping stations, and a buried pipe crossing \nunder Yongjiang River to transfer about 60,000 m3 per day of wastewater from Xiangsihu New \nDistrict to the Jiangnan wastewater drainage system; (iv) provide a pumping station and delivery \nmain for the transfer of water from Yongjiang River to flush through Xiangsihu Lake during the \ndry  season  for  maintaining  water  flow  and  water  quality;  and  (v)  construct  a  storm  water \ndrainage pipe network to serve the proposed 23.17 km2 Xiangsihu New District. \n \n26.  The  solid  waste  management  subproject  will  strengthen  the  domestic  solid  waste \nmanagement capacity of NMG and improve the cleanliness of the streets. This subproject will \n(i) construct or upgrade 22 small transfer stations throughout the urban districts, (ii) provide \nloading and compacting equipment at all the transfer stations, (iii) determine an operational \nmanagement control system to improve the efficiency of waste transfer, and (iv) provide 30 \nstreet  sweeping  vehicles  and  20  street  washing  tankers.  The  compacted  waste  will  be \ntransported to a new engineering landfill site at Chengnan. \n \n27.  The Qingxiushan Park ecological upgrading subproject will improve the environmental \nconditions and facilities of the park, a major tourism and recreational amenity in Nanning City, \nand thereby contribute to improvement of the city\u2019s air quality, promote tourism, and increase \npeople\u2019s awareness of the environment. This subproject will include (i) 71 hectares (ha) of \nreforestation; (ii)198 ha of improved arboreal mix; (iii) a seedling base comprising greenhouses, \nplant shelters, and spray irrigation system; (iv) forest protection facilities comprising two fire \nappliances and facilities for prevention and cure of plant diseases and control of insect pests; \n(v) auxiliary support facilities comprising 2.5 km of access road to the seedling base, electric \npower supply, telecommunication, and a science and technology service center; (vi) gravity \nsewers and 11 pumping stations for the southern area of Qingxiushan Park; (vii) two separate \ntrunk sewer routes to transfer wastewater flows to the Langdong wastewater treatment plant \nfrom  Qingxiushan  Park;  and  (viii)  provision  of  public  awareness  training  on  environmental \nprotection to the visitors. \n \n28.  The institutional capacity building will support increased efficiency and management \ncapacity  of  the  implementing  agencies  (IAs).  Capacity  building  will  be  achieved  through \ndomestic and overseas training and the provision of consulting services. Institutional capacity \nbuilding will assist the IAs to (i) become autonomous and financially sustainable operating \ncompanies that can effectively and efficiently meet the service obligations set out for them; \n(ii) comply with all relevant national policies for the cost recovery, tariff, and enterprise reform of \nthe wastewater and solid waste management sector; (iii) develop soundly based operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) plans for future service provision and commercial growth; (iv) develop a \npublic awareness training program on environmental protection; (v) establish technical and \nadministrative policies and procedures on the hydraulic and water quality balance in Xinxujiang \nand Xiangsihu lakes; and (vi)  improve the efficiency in solid waste transportation at the new \nand upgraded transfer stations. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n29.  The  Project  will  adopt  a  comprehensive,  coordinated  approach  involving  several \ninterrelated components to addressing the complex and interrelated problems of improving the \nurban environment. The Project will prevent water and soil pollution through flood control and \nwastewater and solid waste management (brown issues), and improve the quality of life of \n ", "8 \nurban residents by increasing green space (green issues). Areas around Xinxujiang Lake and \nXiangsihu Lake, which will be created to increase the flood retaining capacity of Xinxujiang \nRiver and Kelijiang River, will be developed concurrently as parks and serve as public amenity \nareas. These areas are currently environmental hot spots affected by uncontrolled wastewater \nand solid waste discharge. Provision of urban infrastructure in the proposed newly urbanized \narea will enable NMG to relieve the pressure of rapid urbanization in the existing city center. \nThe urban environmental scope of this Project is broader than that of past ADB-financed urban \nenvironmental improvement projects which have focused mainly on wastewater management. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n30.  The total project cost is estimated at the equivalent of $262.64 million, including foreign \nexchange  costs  of  $113.47  million  (43.2%)  and  local  currency  costs  of  the  equivalent  of \n$149.17 million (56.8%).

The Borrower of the loan will be the PRC, which will make proceeds of the loan available \nto the government of the GZAR. The government of the GZAR will make the proceeds of the \nloan available to NMG, which will onlend to the IAs. All subloans and onlending will be on the \nsame terms and conditions as the ADB loan. The IAs will assume the foreign exchange and \ninterest rate variation risks for the proceeds of the ADB loan onlent to them. The flow of funds \nand onlending arrangements are described in Appendix 5. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n34.  NMG will be the Executing Agency for the Project. The project steering committee \n(PSC), headed by the vice mayor and comprising representatives of the Nanning Financial \nBureau,  Nanning  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Nanning  Planning  Administration \nBureau, Nanning Construction Commission, Nanning Land and Resources Bureau, Nanning \nEnvironment  Protection  Bureau,  Nanning  Water  Resource  Bureau,  Nanning  Municipal \nAdministration  Bureau,  Nanning  Audit  Bureau,  Qingxiushan  Mountain  Administration \nCommission, and Xiangsihu New District Administration Commission, will be responsible for \nproject coordination and providing policy guidance during implementation. \n \n35.  The Nanning Investment and Development Company will be the IA for the Xinxujiang \nRiver environmental upgrading subproject; the Nanning Xiangsihu Investment, Construction, \nand Development Company Limited for the Kelijiang River environmental upgrading subproject; \nthe Nanning Shixi Solid Waste Treatment Company Limited for the solid waste management \nsubproject;  and  the  Nanning  Qingxiu  Mountain  Scenic  and  Tourist  Resort  Development \nCompany Limited for the Qingxiushan Park ecological upgrading subproject. These companies \nare 100% state-owned.  \n ", "10 \n36.  The  project  management  office  (PMO)  has  been  established  within  the  Nanning \nFinancial Bureau. The PMO will serve as the secretariat of the PSC and will be responsible for \ncoordinating  the  implementation  of  project  activities.  The  PMO  will  (i)  ensure  adequate \ninterdepartmental cooperation and interagency coordination, (ii) monitor the progress of project \nimplementation,  and  (iii)  coordinate  communication  with  ADB  and  agencies  concerned.  A \nproject implementation unit will be established in each subproject IA and will be responsible to \nthe respective IA for coordinating detailed implementation activities. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n37.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 5 years from 2006 until the end of 2010 \n(Appendix 6).  The  implementation  period  is  estimated  based  on  the  project  scope  and \nconstruction technology requirements. This schedule is considered realistic and achievable \nbecause the project implementation structure is already in place and preparatory works are \nunder way. ADB\u2019s successful experience with similar projects in the PRC\u2014and the EA\u2019s and \nIAs\u2019 in-depth knowledge and experience in urban environmental improvement projects using \ninternational financing from the World Bank and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation\u2014\nalso indicate that the schedule is realistic and achievable. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n38.  Equipment, materials and goods, and services financed under the loan will be procured \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and follow ADB procedures for international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) for packages each with a value greater than $1 million. Packages \nvalued at $1 million or less will be procured following national competitive bidding or shopping \nprocedures as determined by the particular circumstances of the contract package. Civil works \ncontracts costing more than $10 million will be procured using ICB. Civil works contracts valued \nat the equivalent of $10 million or less can be procured using national competitive bidding \nprocedures  in  accordance  with  the  PRC  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  and  the  respective \nprocurement regulations acceptable to ADB.13 The selection and engagement of contractors will \nbe subject to ADB approval.14 Procurement packages are provided in the procurement plan \n(Appendix 7). Major equipment will be purchased through ICB procedures and financed by the \nADB loan. The internationally tendered equipment packages will include the necessary technical \nsupport for ensuring proper installation, testing, commissioning, and training of operational staff \nas part of the related contracts. In accordance with ADB requirements, foreign contractors may \nparticipate in bid for national competitive bidding contracts. \n \n39.  ADB  approved  NMG\u2019s  request  for  advance  procurement  action  to  expedite  project \nimplementation. Advance action will include (i) prequalification of contractors, tendering, and bid \nevaluation  for  civil  works  packages;  and  (ii)  preparation  of  tender  documents  to  procure \nmaterials and equipment. The issuance of invitations to bid or to prequalify under the advance \nprocurement action will be subject to ADB approval. All advance procurement actions will be \nundertaken in conformity with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The Government, NMG, and IAs \nwere advised that approval of advance procurement action does not commit ADB to finance the \nProject.  \n \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 1997.

Consulting Services \n \n40.  The loan will finance about 32 person-months of international and 94 person-months of \ndomestic  consulting  services  to  support  the  PMO  and  IAs  in  project  implementation  and \nmanagement,  and  institutional  capacity  building.  The  consultants  will  undertake  (i)  project \nmanagement and implementation support; (ii) efficient operating procedures; (iii) preventive \nmaintenance; (iv) financial management; (v) social, resettlement, and environmental impacts \nmonitoring;  (vi)  business  planning  and  management  information  system  development; \n(vii) human resources development; and (viii) corporate governance. The consultants will assist \nthe PMO in questions related to ADB procedures and reporting, procurement, quality control, \nstart-up  testing,  commissioning,  O&M,  and  implementation  of  the  project  performance \nmonitoring  system  (PPMS).  The  PMO  will  initiate  advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of \nconsultants, including the short-listing of qualified consultants. The international consulting firm \nwill  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  Asian \nDevelopment Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  international  consulting  firm  will  be  selected  in \naccordance with the quality- and cost-based selection method using full technical proposal \nprocedures. Appendix 8 provides the outline terms of reference for consulting services. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n41.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with NMG and the \nIAs. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding \ndocuments for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the \nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of NMG, IAs, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers as \nthey relate to the Project. For the Project, NMG will undertake the following anticorruption \nactions: (i) involve full-time officials from the municipal discipline investigation bureaus in bidding \nand construction, (ii) introduce a dual-signing system in which the civil works contract winner \nalso  signs  an  anticorruption  contract  with  the  employer,  and  (iii)  periodically  inspect  the \ncontractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n42.  The ADB loan funds will be disbursed in accordance with the procedures set out in \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  To  expedite  project  implementation  through  timely \nrelease  of  loan  proceeds,  NMG  will  establish  an  imprest  account  promptly  after  loan \neffectiveness  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  Disbursements  from  the  imprest \naccount will be supported by an appropriate withdrawal application and related documentation. \nSuch documentation will demonstrate, among other things, that the goods and/or services were \nproduced in and procured from ADB\u2019s members, and are eligible for ADB financing. The initial \namount to be deposited in the imprest account will not exceed the estimated expenditures for \nthe next 6 months, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The ADB statement of \nexpenditures procedure may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures. Individual \npayments to be reimbursed or liquidated under the procedure will not exceed $200,000.15 It will \n                                                 \n15  Limits for the imprest account and statement of expenditures are in accordance with a recent review of ADB\u2019s PRC \nportfolio, and to facilitate improved efficiency in loan disbursement. \n ", "12 \nbe a condition for disbursement of the loan proceeds for any subproject that the Government \nsubmit to ADB the certification that (i) the onlending agreement for subproject has been entered \ninto between NMG and the IA concerned, and (ii) such onlending agreement contains the same \nfinancial terms and conditions as required in the loan agreement. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n43.  The  PMO  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  indicating  (i)  progress  made, \n(ii) problems  encountered  during  the  period  under  review,  (iii)  steps  taken  or  proposed  to \nremedy the problems, (iv) the proposed program of activities, and (v) progress expected for the \nfollowing 6 months. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the PMO, with \nsupport  from  the  IAs,  will  submit  to  ADB  a  completion  report  providing  (i)  details  about \nimplementation, (ii) actual costs incurred in relation to cost estimates, (iii) benefits, (iv) progress \nin the institutional area, and (v) other information that ADB may request. \n \n44.  The PMO will maintain records adequate to identify goods and services financed out of \nthe  loan  proceeds,  following  accounting  principles  and  practices  prescribed  by  the  PRC \naccounting  law.  The  law  requires  enterprises  to  prepare  financial  statements  and  follow \ninternationally accepted accounting standards. The IAs will maintain separate project accounts \nand records. The financial statements of the project accounts and the annual corporate financial \nstatements for the IAs will be subject to external audit by (i) the Nanning Municipal Audit \nBureau, (ii) higher level government auditors, and (iii) certified public accountants. The audits \nwill be carried out in accordance with regulations for auditing approved by the State Council and \nthe PRC\u2019s independent auditing standards issued by the Chinese Institute of Certified Public \nAccountants, and ADB requirements. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest \naccount and statement of expenditure will be incorporated in the audit reports. The IAs\u2019 annual \naudited financial statements and audited project accounts will be submitted to ADB no later than \n6 months after the end of the fiscal year for the entire implementation period.16 The annual audit \nreports will include an auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the loan proceeds and compliance with the \nfinancial covenants, included in the loan and project agreements, including the use of the \nimprest accounts and statement of expenditures procedures. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n45.  The PPMS indicators that have been agreed during project preparation include (i) public \nsatisfaction with  the  urban  environment,  (ii)  relevant  economic  and health  data  to  monitor \nproject impacts, (iii) incidence of seasonal flooding in the lower Xinxujiang and Kelijiang rivers \nwithin Xiangsihu New District, (iv) water quality in Xinxujiang and Kelijiang rivers, (v) solid waste \ntransportation efficiency, (vi) cleanliness of the city streets, (vii) expansion of green space, and \n(viii) increase in public awareness of environmental protection. The relevance and practicability \nof data collection for indicators was confirmed with the PMO.  \n \n46.  At the beginning of the Project, the PMO and IAs, with assistance from the consultants, \nwill develop PPMS procedures to generate data systematically on the inputs and outputs of the \nsubprojects, as well as the agreed socioeconomic, environmental, and health indicators to be \nused to measure project impacts. The PMO will (i) refine the PPMS framework, (ii) confirm \nachievable  targets,  (iii)  firm  up  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and  (iv)  establish \nsystems and procedures no later than 6 months after loan effectiveness. \n                                                 \n16  IAs currently have three tiers of audit: (i) internal audit, (ii) municipal government level audit, and (iii) provincial and \nstate government level audit. \n ", "13 \n47.  Under the PPMS framework, baseline and progress data will be reported at the requisite \ntime intervals by the IAs, including semiannual reporting of the environmental management plan \n(EMP).  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  the  data  through  its \nmanagement information system. The PPMS will be designed to permit adequate flexibility to \nadopt remedial action for project design, schedule, activities, and development impacts. The \nPMO, with the assistance of the consultants, will monitor and assess activities, and report to \nADB quarterly on the physical implementation and financial aspects of the Project to ensure that \nimpacts are monitored and reported in line with ADB requirements. \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n48.  Besides  regular  ADB  review  missions,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  undertake  a \ncomprehensive midterm review 2 years after project implementation begins. The review will \ninclude a detailed evaluation of (i) scope, (ii) implementation arrangements, (iii) resettlement, \n(iv) achievement of scheduled targets, (v) progress of the agenda for policy reform and capacity \nbuilding measures, and (vi) reallocation of loan proceeds and change to the disbursement \npercentages. Feedback from the PPMS activities will be analyzed. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Environmental Impacts and Benefits \n \n49.  The Project will significantly (i) improve water quality in Xinxujiang River and Kelijiang \nRiver; (ii) enhance the safety of drinking water sources in downstream Yongjiang River; and \n(iii) protect the quality of the groundwater, especially in shallow aquifers. The improvement of \nwater quality in Xinxujiang and Kelijiang rivers is subject to the establishment of integrated \npolicies and procedures for water quality monitoring and management in these rivers. The \nProject will convert the current environmental hot spots affected by uncontrolled wastewater and \nsolid waste discharges in Kelijiang and Xinxujiang rivers into model green areas, improving the \ncity\u2019s environmental conditions and aesthetics.  \n \n50.  The Project will enhance the quality of the urban environment by increasing carbon \ndioxide absorption and oxygen release, through ecological upgrading of Qingxiushan Park. The \nProject will improve the environmental potential of Qingxiushan Park by (i) increasing the total \nbiomass and forest coverage rate, (ii) protecting and diversifying forest species and promoting \nresearch to ensure forest sustainability, (iii) enhancing soil conservation, and (iv) promoting \npublic awareness programs for park visitors.  \n \n51.  The Project will construct wastewater collection systems that will significantly contribute \nto the city\u2019s environmental management, subject to the scheduled completion of the Jiangnan \nwastewater treatment plant and the connecting trunk sewers. The other necessary requirements \nare constructing branch sewer and sewer connections on time and developing appropriate O&M \nof the wastewater collection networks by relevant NMG agencies. No adverse environmental \nimpacts from operations of the Jiangnan wastewater treatment plant are expected, subject to \nadequate provisions for its O&M, including appropriate sludge treatment and disposal.  \n \n52.  The Project will enhance the city\u2019s solid waste management capacity and efficiency. The \nintroduction of a modern mechanized municipal solid waste transfer system\u2014including new and \nupgraded  transfer  stations,  optimized  waste  hauling  operations,  and  the  improved  street \n ", "14 \nsweeping  capacity\u2014will  minimize  airborne  dust  and  nuisance  odors,  improve  community \nhygiene and sanitation by controlling insects and pests, and enhance the city\u2019s cleanliness. \n \n53.  The  Project  will  have  some  adverse  impacts  in  the  construction  phase,  including \nairborne  dust,  odor,  noise,  traffic  congestion,  waste  discharge  from  construction  camps,  \ndredged  materials,  removal  of  trees,  soil  erosion,  land  occupation,  damage  to  roads,  and \ninfectious  diseases.  Adverse  impacts  will  be  avoided  or  reduced  to  acceptable  levels  by \n(i) careful  selection  of  project  component  sites  and  spoil  disposal  sites  to  avoid  sensitive \nlocations; (ii) control of noise, dust, and release of wastewater during construction; (iii) soil \nerosion  control  during  earthwork;  (iv)  odor  and  noise  control  during  operation;  and \n(v) landscaping  after  project  completion.  The  summary  environmental  impact  assessment \n(SEIA) summarizes environmental impacts, mitigation measures, and monitoring plans. The \nEMP, prepared as part of the SEIA, will guide environmental mitigation and monitoring under \nthe Project. The highlights of the SEIA are in Appendix 9. \n \nB.  Social Dimensions \n \n1.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n \n54.  The  Xinxujiang  River  and  Kelijiang  River  environmental  upgrading  subprojects  will \ninvolve a relatively large amount of land acquisition and resettlement, and two full resettlement \nplans (RPs) have been prepared. The Qingxiushan Park ecological upgrading subproject will \ninvolve relatively small land acquisition and resettlement, and a short RP has been prepared. \nFor the solid waste management subproject, 22 small plots of vacant state-owned land which \nare not occupied by informal dwellers will be occupied permanently; since no land acquisition or \ndemolition of structures is required, no RP was necessary. The Project will affect 6 townships \nand streets, 13 villages, and 2 farms. In total, 1,918 households with 6,585 persons will be \naffected directly by land acquisition and/or house demolition, among which 482 households and \n1,854  people  belong  to  the  floating  (rural  migrant)  population.  There  will  be  permanent \nacquisition of 184 ha of collective-owned land, 50 ha of state-owned land, 128 ha of land in river \ncourses, and temporary occupation of 5 ha of collective-owned land. There will be demolition of \n(i) 35,332 m2 of residential houses, (ii) 12,624 m2 of temporary buildings, and (iii) 14,850 m2 of \ninstitutional buildings. All those affected persons will be compensated and resettled in a timely \nand adequate manner in accordance with the RPs so that they will be at least as well off as they \nwould have been without the Project.  \n \n55.  The land acquisition and resettlement compensation policy for the Project is based on \nthe NMG\u2019s document17 and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. The draft RPs provide a \nsocioeconomic profile of those affected persons and the scope of the impacts; and address \nissues  related  to  entitlements  for  compensation,  legal  framework,  public  consultations, \ngrievance  procedures,  rehabilitation  measures,  budget,  implementation  arrangements,  and \nmonitoring plan. The PMO and IAs implemented ADB\u2019s full disclosure policy for the resettlement \nactivities. The summary RP is in Appendix 10, including resettlement supervision milestones. \n \n                                                 \n17 NMG. 2004. Method of Collective Land Acquisition and Compensation for Housing Demolition on Collective Land. \nNanning. \n ", "15 \n2.  Poverty Reduction, Health, and Social Benefits \n \n56.  Among the beneficiaries, the poor18 in the project impact area (PIA) comprise about \n217,000 (7.2%) of the total population. An improved urban environment will help to enable \npoverty reduction through (i) reduction of the incidence of infectious and waterborne and vector-\nborne diseases, (ii) improvement of investment conditions to attract more outside investment for \nlocal  development,  (iii)  creation  of  new  job  opportunities,  and  (iv)  development  of  tourism \nindustry. As a result, the population exposed to waterborne and vector-borne diseases will be \nreduced, and the associated medical costs and number of workdays and school days lost due to \nsickness will be cut. Savings in medical costs will be greater for the poor, families with children, \nand the elderly, as they are most vulnerable to such diseases. A summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \n57.  The PIA has a population of 3.03 million, of which about 1 million is from 35 ethnic \nminority groups. The main ethnic minority groups are Zhuang (95%) and Yao (3.8%). About \n1,805 persons of ethnic minority groups will be affected by land acquisition and resettlement. \nOther ethnic minorities, including Miao, Dong, and Hui, will not be affected by land acquisition \nand  resettlement.  The  social  assessment  report  showed  that  ethnic  minorities  are  highly \nassimilated in the main Han group in terms of socioeconomic characteristics, religion, social \nstatus,  education,  employment,  and  other  service  opportunities.  There  is  no  separate  or \notherwise specific zone within the PIA that is exclusively or predominantly inhabited by any of \nthe ethnic minorities, and all ethnic minorities are mixed and live in the same communities.19 \nImpact and special measures for ethnic minorities are included in the RPs, and enhancement \nmeasures are in the social development action plan (SDAP). \n \nC.  Financial Aspects \n58.  The discounted cash flow analysis based on incremental costs and benefits under with-\nand  without-project  scenarios  for  the  two  revenue-earning  subprojects  (solid  waste \nmanagement and Qingxiushan Park ecological upgrading subprojects) was undertaken in real \nterms using constant 2005 prices. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was computed on \nan after-tax basis. The FIRR for the solid waste management subproject is 9.36%, and the \nQingxiushan Park ecological upgrading subproject FIRR is 7.87%. These exceed the weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC) of 4% in real terms.  \n \n59.  Sensitivity tests were carried out for the two revenue-earning subprojects. The solid \nwaste management subproject is relatively insensitive to adverse changes in financial revenues \n(decreases). Above a 19.1% decrease in the proposed revenues, the FIRR would be less than \nthe WACC of 4%. In the case that all three factors (revenues, investment costs, and O&M costs) \nchange adversely on the same scale at the same time, the FIRR and net present value would \nbe relatively sensitive. Above a 10.6% change in these combined factors, the FIRR would be \nlower  than  the  WACC  of  4%.  For  the  Qingxiushan  Park  ecological  upgrading  subproject, \nrevenue  changes  for  sale  of  tree  seedlings  and  flowers,  visitors,  and  other  revenues  are \nrelatively insensitive. With adverse changes less than 17.5% in each revenue category, the \n                                                 \n18 Includes both rural and urban poor. Rural poor refers to those with annual per capita income of less than CNY650. \nUrban poor refers to people who are under the minimum living standard scheme (MLSS). People under the MLSS \nwill receive social assistance from the civil administrative department. MLSS varies in different counties in the \nGZAR. The MLSS in Nanning City was CNY190 per capita per month in 2003 and was raised to CNY210 per \ncapita per month in 2005. \n19  The Zhuang and Han have coexisted peacefully for more than 1,000 years and there has been a high degree of \nintermarriages. \n ", "16 \nFIRR is still satisfactory. In the case that all factors change adversely, the FIRR and net present \nvalue would be sensitive. Above an 11% change, the FIRR would be lower than WACC of 4%. \nSensitivity analysis indicates that the FIRRs for these two subprojects are robust under adverse \nconditions.  \n \n60.  Financial statement projections in nominal terms for the IAs for the two revenue-earning \nsubprojects  were  prepared  and  showed  satisfactory  results.  The  minimum  debt  service \ncoverage ratios and acceptable rates of return on equity will generally be achieved by the \nProject. The IAs have agreed to meet the minimum levels of financial performance, and these \nwill be included as loan covenants covering capital structure (debt to equity), debt service cover, \nand liquidity. Financial projections have estimated the tariffs required for an appropriate level of \nfinancial performance. The ensuing projected tariff rises were discussed with NMG and found \ngenerally  acceptable.  Periodic  tariff  reviews  will  be  required  to  overcome  the  risk  of  poor \nfinancial performance or unexpected changes in the tariff income. The overall fiscal impact \nresulting from the Project is expected to be positive, as various levels of government, including \ndistrict governments and NMG, are investors in the Project. However, the shareholders, and \nsubsequently the guarantor of the ADB loan, will take some financial risk during construction \nand  in  the  first  few  years  of  operation.  Based  on  the  financial  analysis,  these  risks  are \nconsidered manageable. The O&M costs were estimated for each subproject. For the other two \nnon-revenue-earning subprojects (Xinxujiang River and Kelijiang River environmental upgrading \nsubprojects), NMG will ensure that adequate budgetary funds are transferred to cover the costs \nneeded for normal O&M. The financial analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \nD.  Financial Management Assessment \n61.  The financial management assessment was conducted on all the IAs, covering the \nimplementation arrangements, sustainability, fiduciary risks, and mitigation strategy. The Project \nwill assist each IA to establish a sound and solid financial management system at the beginning \nof  project  implementation.  The  financial  management  system  will  be  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Governance and Financial Management of an ADB Investment Project. Each IA \nwill  keep  accounts  in  accordance  with  commercial  accounting  principles  and  subject  to \nindependent external audit by suitably qualified commercial or government auditors. Accounting \nwill be performed in accordance with the relevant PRC accounting standards, which largely \nfollow international norms. All IAs will meet ADB requirements for auditing arrangements and \nsubmit audited financial statements and project accounts to ADB annually. \n \n62.  To  ensure  accurate  and  timely  interpretation  of  the  IAs\u2019  financial  position  and \nperformance, and to ensure that project expenditures are used for the purposes stated in the \nloan and project agreement with due attention to considerations of economy and efficiency, \nfinancial  management  of  the  Project  should  be  consistent  with  PRC  national  accounting \nstandards.  The  Nanning  Financial  Bureau  will  provide  the  IAs  with  extensive  training  on \naccounting and financial management to strengthen accounting and financial management skills \nand procedures of the financial departments of the IAs. The 2006 training plan will cover training \non  accounting,  procedures  and  filing,  preparation  of  financial  statements,  government \nprocurement laws, and tax laws. \n \n63.  On  16  March  2001,  NMG  approved  the  procurement  administrative  regulation  and \nprocedures for projects financed by international financial institutions. The regulation is based \non the government notice issued by the Financial Bureau of GZAR on detailed disbursement \nprocedures for the World Bank-financed Guangxi Urban Environment Improvement Project. If \n ", "17 \nnecessary, NMG will issue additional regulations to further strengthen overall management of \nthe Project. \n \nE.  Economic Aspects \n64.  The  four  subprojects  will  generate  economic  benefits  for  the  urban  population  of \nNanning City. The Xinxujiang River and Kelijiang River environmental upgrading subprojects are \nexpected  to  generate  the  following  benefits:  (i)  cleaner  environment;  (ii)  reduction  and/or \navoidance of loss of life, damage to properties, and disruption in economic activities due to \nfloods; (iii) avoidance of loss in income and medical expenses because of diseases caused by \nwastewater and solid waste contamination of the rivers; (iv) reduction of biological oxygen \ndemand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in Yongjiang River, which is a major \nsource of water supply for Nanning City; and (v) increase in land values. \n \n65.  The solid waste management subproject is expected to generate the following benefits: \n(i) clean environment, (ii) reduction and/or avoidance of floods (as a result of reduced solid \nwaste in rivers/canals/drainage system), and (iii) avoidance of loss in income and medical \nexpenses because of diseases produced by solid waste contamination. The Qingxiushan Park \necological upgrading subproject is aimed at countering the environmental imbalance caused by \nthe rapid urbanization of Nanning City and to reduce pollution in the park from the wastewater \ngenerated by park visitors. Benefits from this subproject include (i) reduced soil erosion, (ii) \nincreased water retention, (iii) reduced carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide from the atmosphere, \n(iv) increased tourism, (v) income from the sale of tree seedlings and flowers, (vi) protection of \nunderground  water  (sewerage  component),  (vii)  increased  forest  stock,  (viii) reduced  worm \ndamage in trees (because of proposed improved arboreal mix), and (ix) reduced damage to \ntrees and flowers (because of proposed monitoring station and fire protection component). \n \n66.  Quantitative analysis of the benefits identified showed that the four subprojects will \ngenerate  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  of  24.0%  for  the  Xinxujiang  River \nenvironmental upgrading, 22.1% for the Kelijiang River environmental upgrading, 11.1% for \nsolid  waste  management,  and  12.6%  for  the  Qingxiushan  Park  ecological  upgrading \nsubprojects.20 The Project is considered economically feasible if the EIRR is equal to or is \nhigher than the economic opportunity cost of capital (12%). In economic terms, except for the \nsolid  waste  management  subproject,  all  the  subprojects  are  viable.  However,  when \nreduction/avoidance of flood damage21 (as a result of reduced solid waste in rivers, canals, and \ndrainage system) that can be attributed to the solid waste management subproject is quantified \nand included as one of the economic benefits, it is likely that the EIRR will exceed 12%. \nDetailed economic analysis is in Appendix 13. \n \nF.  Project Risks and Mitigation Measures \n67.  The  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  Conventional  engineering \ndesigns with proven records of reliable performance are adopted for flood control, solid waste \nmanagement, and reforestation. The ICB equipment procurement will include technical support \nfor  installation,  testing,  and  commissioning  as  recommended  by  the  manufacturer.  During \nproject  implementation,  the  consultants  will  support  the PMO  and  IAs  to  ensure  delivered \nequipment and works comply with the design requirements and quality standards. Based on the \n                                                 \n20  EIRR for the Xinxujiang and Kelijiang river subprojects will be revised downwards after incorporating the increases \nin resettlement costs. \n21  The IA estimated that, for the Xinxujiang river basin, flood damage that could be avoided by the Project is \nestimated at about CNY11.03 million per year. \n ", "18 \nperformance of ADB\u2019s PRC portfolio, cost overruns and major implementation delays are not \nexpected. \n \n68.  Potential risks include (i) inadequate wastewater treatment and solid waste disposal \ncapacities at the required time due to delays in the second phase of the Jiangnan wastewater \ntreatment  plant  upgrading  and  the  Chengnan  landfill  site  improvement  by  NMG,  and  the \nNanning city sewerage upgrading by the World Bank; (ii) possible delays in increasing the solid \nwaste tariff and tariff collection rate; (iii) lack of customers\u2019 willingness to pay the increased \ntariffs; (iv) lack of proper O&M of project facilities; (v) lack of IAs\u2019 capacity to carry out their \nresponsibilities; (vi) discontinuation of  enforcement of environmental standards; (vii)  change in \nexisting pollution control measures; (viii) lack of support from all levels of government agencies \nconcerned;  (ix)  delays  in  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  and  (x) unforeseen  difficult \nconstruction conditions. Risk (i) is being mitigated by synchronizing the project design and \nimplementation schedules. Risks (ii) and (iii) are being mitigated by ensuring the financial and \nmanagerial  autonomy  for  the  solid  waste  management  company,  and  conducting  public \nconsultations to obtain public support for the tariff increase. Risks (iv) and (v) will be mitigated \nthrough provision of institutional capacity building for the IAs. Risks (vi), (vii), and (viii) will be \nmitigated through regular project reviews. Risks (ix) and (x) will be mitigated through support \nfrom the project management consultants and regular project monitoring. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n69.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, GZAR, and NMG have given \nthe following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n(i)  NMG will ensure that (a) the local monitoring at Tianbao reservoir, Xinxujiang \nRiver, and Kelijiang River is established compatible with the GZAR\u2019s regional \nflood monitoring and control system, which is expected to be upgraded by 2010, \nfor the future integration;

Environmental Needs \n \n1.  The Project is designed to address the urgent urban environmental upgrading issues in \nNanning City. Environmental needs include (i) reduction of seasonal flood risk in the lower part \nof Xinxujiang and Kelijiang rivers, (ii) improvement of wastewater and solid waste management, \nand (iii) expansion of the green environment throughout the city. \n \nB.  Alternatives \n \n2.  Without  the  Project,  the  (i)  flood  control  capacity  would  continue  to  be  weakened; \n(ii) surface  water  quality  would  continue  to  deteriorate  because  of  increased  volumes  of \nuntreated wastewater discharged to the receiving waters; (iii) municipal solid waste collection, \ntransfer, and transportation systems would remain inefficient, manually based, and relatively \nexpensive; and (iv) existing woodland would deteriorate because of lack of diversity and its \nvulnerability to diseases and forest fires, and the dominant masson pine would continue to \ninhibit the growth of other species. Technical alternatives were evaluated for (i) wastewater \ncollection and treatment options; (ii) sewerage pumping schemes and sites; (iii) river flushing \nschemes; (iv) dredging, transportation, and disposal of river sediment; (v) number and locations \nof solid waste transfer stations; and (vi) tree planting scales at Qingxiushan Park, taking into \naccount technical and environmental requirements. \n \nC.  Benefits \n \n3.  The Project will bring significant health benefits to about 650,000 directly affected people \nliving in the project area, and significantly contribute to environmental upgrading of Nanning \nCity. The Project will assist in achieving environmental management and pollution control goals \nand targets, including pollutant loads reduction and surface water quality classification set by \nthe plans and strategies set by the Nanning municipal government (NMG), GZAR, and central \nGovernment. The Project will assist NMG in its ongoing effort to promote the city as a green and \nenvironmental model city. \n \n4.  The Project will bring significant positive impacts to the safety and health of Nanning City \nresidents and assets by reducing flooding and associated pollution and health hazards in the \nnorthwest area of Nanning, enabling further urban expansion in the area. The Project will \nsignificantly (i) improve water quality in Xinxujiang and Kelijiang rivers; (ii) enhance the safety of \ndrinking water sources in downstream Yongjiang River; (iii) protect the quality of groundwater, \nespecially in shallow aquifers; and (iv) help the return of aquatic life in the project rivers. Water \nquality has been severely contaminated in both lower reaches of Kelijiang and Xinxujiang rivers, \nprimarily  from  direct  discharges  of  domestic  wastewater  and  surface  runoff  of  agricultural \nactivities along the rivers. The main pollutants are total coliform, chemical oxygen demand \n(COD),  nitrogen,  and  phosphorus.  Environmental  monitoring  conducted  during  the  project \nenvironmental impact assessment for Kelijiang River shows that the coliform bacteria group was \n78.0 times the applicable standard; ammonia nitrogen, 9.6 times; total phosphor, 1.9 times; and \nCOD, 1.8 times. Similarly, data for Xinxujiang River show that the coliform bacteria group was \n48.0 times higher than the standard; ammonia nitrogen, 5.5 times; total phosphor, 0.45 times; \nand COD, 1.5 times. It is expected that the Project will reduce the total chemical oxygen \ndemand by potassium dichromate method (CODcr) load by about 2,200 ton per year (t/yr), total \nbiological oxygen demand (BOD ) load by 557 t/yr, and total ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) load by \n5\n393 t/yr in Xinxujiang and Kelijiang rivers. The pollution discharge reduction to the Nanning \n ", "  Appendix 9  41 \nsection of Yongjiang River is anticipated to be 16,250 t/yr for COD and 1,270 t/yr for ammonia \nnitrogen  (NH3-N)  by  2010.  The  Project  will  also  assist  the  development  of  the  citywide \nautomatic  water  quality  monitoring  system  to  establish  modern  integrated  water  quality \nmanagement.  The  Project  will  convert  the  current  environmental  hot  spots  affected  by \nuncontrolled wastewater and solid waste discharges in Kelijiang and Xinxujiang rivers and their \nvicinity into model green areas, improving the city\u2019s environmental conditions and aesthetics.  \n \n5.  The Project will enhance the city\u2019s solid waste management efficiency. The introduction \nof a modern mechanized municipal solid waste transfer system\u2014including new and upgraded \ntransfer stations, optimized waste hauling operations, and improved street sweeping capacity\u2014\nwill minimize airborne dust and nuisance odors, improve community hygiene and sanitation by \ncontrolling insects and pests, and enhance the city\u2019s cleanliness and aesthetics. \n \n6.  The Project will enhance the quality of the urban environment by increasing carbon \ndioxide absorption and oxygen release through upgrading of Qingxiushan Park. The Project will \nimprove the environmental potential of Qingxiushan Park by (i) increasing the total biomass and \nforest coverage rate, (ii) protecting and diversifying forest species and promoting research to \nensure forest sustainability, (iii) enhancing soil conservation, and (iv) promoting the use of the \npark for city residents. The annual forest water conservation capacity is estimated to increase \nby about 71,522 t. A total of 4,531 t of soil will be conserved from erosion. The forest carbon \nholding capacity will increase by about 173.7 t/yr, equivalent to 636.9 t/yr of carbon dioxide \nremoved from air. The amount of oxygen generated by the increased green area will be 541.4 \nt/yr and reduce 210 t/yr of airborne dust. \n \nD.  Potential Negative Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n7.  Adverse impacts generated by the Project during construction will include airborne dust, \nodor, noise, traffic congestion, waste discharge from construction camps, dredged materials, \nremoval of trees, soil erosion, land occupation, damage to roads, and infectious diseases. \nAdverse impacts will be avoided or reduced to acceptable levels by taking appropriate mitigation \nand  compensation  measures.  Such  measures  will  cover  (i)  a  careful  selection  of  project \ncomponent sites and spoil disposal sites to avoid sensitive locations; (ii) control of noise, dust, \nand  release  of  wastewater  during  construction;  (iii)  soil  erosion  control  during  earthwork; \n(iv) odor and noise control during operation; and (v) landscaping after project completion. With \nthe appropriate and full implementation of the mitigation measures, the adverse impacts of the \nProject are expected to be minimized and reduced to acceptable levels.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "42  Appendix 10 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  The  Guangxi  Nanning  Urban  Environmental  Upgrading  Project  consists  of  four \nsubprojects:  (i)  Xinxujiang  River  environmental  upgrading  (Xinxujiang  River  subproject), \n(ii) Kelijiang  River  environmental  upgrading  (Kelijiang  River  subproject),  (iii)  solid  waste \nmanagement  (solid  waste  subproject),  and  (iv)  Qingxiushan  Park  ecological  upgrading \n(Qingxiushan Park subproject).  \n2.  The Kelijiang and Xinxujiang subprojects will involve a relatively large amount of land \nacquisition and resettlement. Two full resettlement plans (RPs) have already been prepared \nbased on Asian Development Bank (ADB) requirements. Qingxiushan Park will involve relatively \nsmall land acquisition and resettlement, so a short RP has been prepared. For the solid waste \nsubproject, 2.7 hectares (ha) of vacant state-owned land will be transferred to the Implementing \nAgency (IA); since no persons are affected, no RP is necessary. All persons affected by the \nProject  will  be  eligible  for  compensation  and  assistance.  The  cutoff  date  for  eligibility  for \ncompensation and assistance will be the date when the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region \nDevelopment and Reform Commission approves the project feasibility study, which will be \nannounced to all affected persons immediately afterward. When the detailed engineering of \neach subproject has been finalized, if necessary, the RPs will be updated on the basis of any \ndesign changes. \nB.  Resettlement Impacts \n \n3.  To avoid or minimize land acquisition and resettlement, there was close consultation \nwith local officials and village committees and/or street committees during the preliminary and \nfinal feasibility study stages. The proposed Project will affect 6 townships/streets, 13 villages \nand 2 farms in Yongxin District, High Technology New District, Chengbei District, and Qingxiu \nDistrict of Nanning City. The affected villages can be classified as \u201cvillage in city\u201d; many have \nlimited  farmland  due  to  urbanization,  and  households  derive  most  of  their  income  from \nnonagricultural activities, and supplement their incomes by renting farmland or housing.  \n4.  In total, 1,918 households with 6,585 persons will be directly affected by land acquisition \nand/or house demolition, among which 482 households and 1,854 people belong to the floating \n(rural migrant) population. Details by project component are shown in Table A10. \nTable A10:  Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n \nPermanent Land Acquisition  Tempo- Building Demolition  Directly  Directly \nrary   Affected  Affected \nLand  House-  Floating \nProject  State- Collective- Land in  Living  Institution  Simple \nOccu- Holds  House-\nComponent  Owned   Owned   River   houses  houses \npation  holds \nCourses\n (ha)  (ha)  (ha)   (ha)  (m2)  (m2)  (m2)  (H.H.)

In total, about 361.4 ha of land will be permanently acquired by the Project, of which \n51% is classified collective land. In addition, 5.07 ha of farmland will be occupied temporarily \nduring the construction phase. Structures to be demolished include 35,332 square meters (m2) \nof rural houses, 4 institutions with 14,850 m2 of institutional buildings, and 12,624 m2 of basic \nhouses which are mainly rented or owned by the floating population for living and breeding \nanimals.  \n \nC.  Policy and Legal Framework \n6.  For people unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to achieve equal or better \nincome and living standards in line with laws and regulations of the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. Compensation for permanent land loss \nand house demolition is based on the (i) Land Administration Law of the PRC, 2004; (ii) State \nCouncil Decision to Deepen Reform and Strictly Enforce Land Administration (Document No. 28 \ndated  November  2004);  (iii)  Method  of  Collective  Land  Acquisition  and  Compensation  for \nHousing  Demolition  on  Collective  Land  (Nanning  Municipal  Government  [NMG]  Document \nNo. 106,  effective  22  November  2004);  and  (iv)  Management  Method  of  Urban  Housing \nDemolition of Nanning City, (NMG Document No. 17, effective 1 July 2003). \n7.  Based  on  consultations  with  local  governments  and  affected  persons,  and  general \npractice in the project counties and/or cities, a set of resettlement principles was adopted by the \nproject IAs: (i) land acquisition and involuntary resettlement should be avoided or minimized \nwhere feasible by developing and comparing a series of design alternatives; (ii) compensation \nand  entitlements  provided  are  based  on  market  value  or  replacement  value  and  must  be \nadequate to allow affected persons to at least maintain their pre-project standard of living, with \nthe prospect of improvement; (iii) land temporarily occupied and the disruption period are to be \nkept to a minimum; (iv) all affected persons, registered and non-registered, are entitled to \ncompensation and assistance; (v) where remaining farmland per capita is not sufficient to \nmaintain food supply, other income-generating activities will be provided; (vi) special measures \nwill be provided to vulnerable groups and floating populations, such as assignment of economic \nhousing, transfer assistance, training, and employment placement; (vii) all affected persons will \nbe adequately informed about eligibility, compensation rates and standards, livelihood and \nincome-restoration plans, and project timing; and (viii) implementation will be closely monitored \nto identify and resolve problems in a timely manner.  \n \n8.  For land acquisition, the land compensation will be paid to the affected village and the \nresettlement subsidy will be paid to the affected households. The land compensation standards \nare quite high, reflecting the proximity to the urban center. For institutions, compensation will be \npaid  to  owners  who  are  responsible  for  rehabilitating  the  affected  persons.  Compensation \npayments will be made in cash according to the appraised value of the land and fixed property \nassets. Compensation for standing crops, tress, other attachments, and temporary impacts will \nbe paid directly to affected persons. Income losses resulting from reduced production and/or \nsales and wages caused by the Project will be assessed and compensated in cash. \n9.  The new Kelijiang Road started construction adjacent to the Kelijiang River subproject in \nJuly  2005  and  will  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2006.  Since  this  construction  involves \nembankment next to the river, there is some overlap between the land and housing impacted by \nboth projects. The roads required acquisition of about 16.2 ha of land and to date 86 houses \nhave  been  demolished.  This  project  is  under  the  same  IA,  and  the  land  acquisition  and \n ", "44  Appendix 10 \nresettlement have followed the NMG\u2019s document.1 Further due diligence was conducted to \nensure  that  affected  persons  are  satisfied  with  the  resettlement;  this  diligence  report  was \nincluded as an annex to the RP for Kelijiang River subproject. \n \nD.  Resettlement and Rehabilitation \n  \n10.  To  minimize  the  resettlement  impacts  to  affected  persons  and  restore  their  living \nstandards, the detailed programs of restoration and relocation have been arranged in the RPs. \nPeople can choose the available programs according to their requirements. According to the \neconomic characteristics of affected villages, different schemes for income restoration will be \ncarried out. The compensation is to be used for village income-generating activities, such as \nexpansion of small businesses, and building commercial and residential houses for renting; \naffected  persons  will  share  the  benefit  from  these  investments.  Additional  strategies  and \nmeasures  for  seriously  affected  villages  include  (i)  commercial  land  base  allocation, \n(ii) provision of employment for project construction, and (iii) provision of skills training and \nassistance for employment information and placement. Although the project impacts on incomes \nare not serious, these measures will ensure that all affected persons can maintain or acquire \nmore stable incomes to restore and enhance their living standards.  \n11.  Regarding house demolition, registered structures will be compensated at market prices \nand non-registered structures will be compensated at replacement cost. Affected villagers can \nchoose to purchase commercial houses,  exchange properties, or rebuild houses with free \nhouse sites. To improve residents\u2019 living standards, Nanning City is constructing budget housing \nwithin Xiangsihu New District which cost only CNY1,033/m2. According to the project policy \nframework, the compensation for housing will range from CNY1,090/m2 to CNY1,800/m2, so \naffected persons will have enough money to purchase new or secondhand houses. \n12.  In addition, special attention will be paid to resettlement and rehabilitation of the floating \npopulation and vulnerable groups. Since the floating population only has 1-year land lease \ncontracts and their temporary structures are simple or leased, the proposed compensation \nentitlements are fair (normally no compensation is required by law). However, the amount they \nobtain will be quite small so they will receive the following special measures: (i) transition and \nmoving allowances, (ii) assistance to apply for budget housing, (iii) arrangement of low-rent \nhousing, (iv) provision of free skills training and employment information and guidance, and \n(v) arrangement of rental spaces for commercial activities.  \nE.  Resettlement Cost and Fund Management  \n \n13.  The cost estimate for land acquisition and resettlement is CNY727.8 million in 2005 \nprices, including contingencies and land taxes; this is equivalent to $89.7 million (41.7% of total \nproject cost). The land acquisition and resettlement cost are included as part of the total project \ncost and will be funded by the NMG. According to the compensation policies and standards \ndefined in the RPs, the payment and usage of compensation funds will be carried out under the \nsupervision  of  the  internal  monitoring  agencies  with  regular  audit  reviews.  Detailed \nmeasurement surveys will be conducted in each village and enterprise; and the compensation \ncontracts will be negotiated and signed with village committees, households, and enterprises. \nFinal costs will be adjusted on this basis. \n                                                 \n1  NMG. 2004.

Information Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance \n \n14.  The affected  persons have been informed about the key elements of land acquisition \nand resettlement through consultation during the planning stage and distribution of resettlement \ninformation. On various occasions during meetings, interviews, focus group discussions, public \nconsultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  local  representatives  have \nparticipated in the planning, and concerns have been integrated into the RPs. In September \n2005, the draft RPs were publicized in Nanning Newspaper and placed in the Nanning library. In \nNovember  2005,  the  draft  final  RPs  were  disclosed  to  the  13  villages  and  2  farms,  and \nresettlement information booklets provided to affected households on 10 December 2005. The \ndraft RPs will be posted on the ADB web site prior to loan appraisal and the approved RPs will \nbe posted by the date of approval by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. The respective project IAs will \nestablish  project  resettlement  units  for  (i)  supervising  implementation,  (ii)  continuing  public \nconsultation, (iii) monitoring progress, and (iv) responding to grievances. The grievance redress \nprocedures are well established and explanations are explained in the RPs. \nG.  Implementation Arrangement and Schedule \n \n15.  The  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for \nimplementing resettlement. A resettlement office within the PMO will coordinate the planning, \nimplementation, financing, and reporting of land acquisition and resettlement. The subproject \nresettlement offices, which are set up under the IAs, will take primary responsibility for the \nresettlement consultation, implementation, and timely delivery of entitlements. The resettlement \nimplementation  schedule  was  prepared  based  on  the  overall  project  preparation  and \nconstruction timetable. No land acquisition or demolition shall start until RPs are updated based \non designs and approved by ADB. It is anticipated that land acquisition will start in July 2006 \nand  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2007.  Housing  relocation  will  start  from  early  2006,  re-\ndesignation of collective land to commercial land use and subsequent development will be done \nby the end of 2006, and full restoration of livelihoods and living conditions will be achieved by \nthe end of 2007.  \nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n16.  Internal  and  external  monitoring  of  resettlement  implementation  will  be  conducted. \nInternal supervision and monitoring will be done by each IA to ensure compliance with the \nprovisions of the RP. The PMO and IAs will engage an independent agency for semiannual \nmonitoring and annual evaluation of land acquisition and resettlement until 2 years after the \ncompletion of land acquisition and resettlement. External monitoring reports will be forwarded \ndirectly to both the PMO and ADB. \n \n ", "46  Appendix 11 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?    priority in country poverty partnership \n    No    No \nagreement?   \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nThe project impact area (PIA) covers Xiangsihu district, Qingxiu district, Xinning district, Xincheng district, Chengbei \ndistrict, Yongxin district, Yongning district, and Wuming county of Nanning City. The total project beneficiaries are 3.03 \nmillion, which is equivalent to 47% of the total population of Nanning City. The Project will enhance the urban \nenvironment and public health in Nanning City through (i) improved flood control, (ii) improved wastewater and solid \nwaste management, and (iii) expanded green environment. Improved urban environment will provide an enabling \nenvironment for poverty reduction through (i) improved health status and well-being of urban residents by reducing the \nincidence of infectious and waterborne diseases; (ii) improved investment conditions which will help attract more \noutside investment for local development, create new job opportunities, accelerate the construction of city ecological \nsystem; and (iii) improved Yongjiang River water environment and developed tourism industry in Nanning City. The \nProject will also provide more job and investment opportunities to increase people\u2019s income. During construction, the \nProject will create about 11,400 person-years of work; 40% will be unskilled work. Some 60% of the unskilled work will \nbe targeted at the poor, totaling 3,990 person-years at total wages of CNY17.56 million or CNY4,400 per person-year. \nPriority will be given to women, people affected by resettlement, ethnic minorities, and other vulnerable groups. In \naddition, during construction, 480 person-years of local jobs will be created in the provision of construction material \nwith total wages of CNY3.8 million or annual average wages of CNY7,920 per capita. After project construction, about \n420 additional jobs will be created with total wages of CNY4.54 million annually or CNY108.96 million during the 24-\nyear operation period. \nA health impact analysis was conducted to estimate the health benefits associated with improved flood control, \nwastewater and solid waste management, and expanded green environment. In estimating the potential health \nbenefits (savings) attributable to the Project, an assumption of 40% reduction in waterborne and vector-borne \ndiseases was used.a Under the \u201cwithout-project\u201d scenario, it is projected that the incidence of water-related health \ncosts will (i) increase in real terms with increasing urbanization, (ii) increase untreated wastewater and solid waste \nvolumes, and (iii) increase pollution of receiving water bodies and general deterioration in the urban environment \nbecause of lack of effective wastewater and solid waste management services. So, it has been conservatively \nassumed that health costs will increase by about 5% annually from 2006 to 2032. Health benefits have been estimated \nfor the \u201dwith-project\u201d scenario, starting to accrue from 2010 (the Project\u2019s first full operations year). As a result of \nimproved environmental pollution control, the population exposed to pollution-related diseases will be reduced, with \nthe associated reduction in medical costs and drop in number of workdays and school days lost due to sickness. The \nestimated potential annual health benefits attributable to the Project will be CNY2.0 million in 2010 and CNY4.8 million \nin 2032. The net present value of health benefits that is attributable to the Project during the period 2010\u20132032 is \nestimated at CNY14.6 million. The benefit of savings in direct medical costs to children, elderly, women, and poor will \nbe greater as they are most vulnerable to the diseases. Women have more contact with water from household \nresponsibilities (especially cooking and washing), so they will benefit disproportionately from the improvement in water \nquality, sanitation, and urban environment as a result of the Project. The poor live under unsanitary conditions, so they \nwill gain more than the average population in terms of better environmental and living conditions. \nFor the full health benefits to be realized, the following will be required: (i) parallel improvements in public health \neducation, (ii) higher standards of personal hygiene, (iii) prevention and control, and (iv) improved housing and living \nconditions. These will be particularly important for the poor, who are likely to suffer most from the incidence of \npollution-related diseases. The arrangements for monitoring health benefits  will be  incorporated in the project \nperformance management system (PPMS) to be established for comprehensive project impact monitoring. A detailed \nhealth impact analysis is in Supplementary Appendix G. The qualitative benefits of the Project will be (i) reduced risk \nof exposure to waterborne diseases associated with treatment of a greater proportion of wastewater and reduced \nsewer overflows, and less water bodies receiving wastewater pollutants; (ii) reduced risks of exposure to filth- and \nvector-borne diseases and offensive odor because of collection and treatment of a greater proportion of solid waste, \nreduction of pollution and offensive odor of the transit stations, reduction of garbage spillover in the streets, and \nreduction  of  groundwater  contamination;  and  (iii)  increased  forestry  coverage  at  Qingxiushan  Park,  which  will \ncontribute to reduce soil erosion, increase the carbon holding capacity, and release more oxygen.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  47 \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nIn the PRC, income is used as the main indicator to measure poverty. In 2003, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region \n(GZAR) had its absolute poverty line set at CNY650 net income per capita per year. The standard of low-income rural \nresidents is CNY651\u2013950 per capita per year. By these definitions, a total of 0.96 million are among the absolute poor \nand 4.93 million are low-income rural residents. In 2003, there were 317 poverty villages in Nanning with a total of \n474,000 rural poor, accounting for 9.9% of Nanning\u2019s total population or 8.05% of rural poor in the GZAR. Among the \nrural poor in Nanning City, 75,800 live in absolute poverty and 398,200 are low-income rural residents. \nCompared with the GZAR and Nanning City, the rural poor in the PIA is minor but the urban poor is higher. The main \ncause is that the PIA is located in the urban and suburban areas of Nanning and the people who live there have more \naccess to income-earning opportunities. The incidence of rural poverty measured as per capita income below CNY950 \nin the PIA is about 0.14 million (8.1% of the rural population or 4.6% of the total PIA population). Absolute poverty \n(less than CNY650) is 0.02 million (1.2%).  \nUnlike the rural poverty definition, there is no uniform standard for the urban poverty line. In general, people under the \nminimum living standard scheme (MLSS) are defined as urban poor. The urban poor mostly consist of people with no \nincome, no capacity to work, no legal support, or no ability to work. People under the minimum MLSS will receive \nsocial assistance from the civil administrative department. The MLSS varies in different counties in the GZAR. In 2003, \nthe MLSS was CNY190 per capita per month in Nanning. The number of people under the MLSS is 85,924, which is \n6.1% of the urban population. The urban poor in the PIA is about 73,000 (5.6%) of the total PIA population. The \nproportion of urban poverty in part of the PIA, particularly for the Kelijiang River environmental upgrading subproject, is \nhigher than the Nanning City and GZAR average because a large number of the floating population lives on riparian \nland. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nStakeholder analysis and the role of each stakeholder are identified. The main stakeholders of the Project are urban \nresidents; farmers; floating population; waste collectors; street sweepers; implementing agencies (IAs) such as the \nNanning Investment and Development Company, Nanning Xiangsihu Investment, Construction and Development \nCompany, Nanning Shixi Solid Waste Treatment Company, and Nanning Qingxiu Mountain Scenic and Tourist Resort \nDevelopment  Company;  executing  agency,  i.e.,  the  Nanning  Municipal  Government  (NMG);  and  secondary \nstakeholders such as the All-China Women\u2019s Federation, Civil Affairs Bureau, etc. During the project design, a variety \nof participatory approaches\u2014such as participatory rural appraisal, workshops, focus group discussions, meetings, \ninterviews, and surveys\u2014were employed to gain a better understanding of the demand, needs, and interests of the \nstakeholder, particularly groups that are normally excluded from the decision making process. \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nLocal district and county governments and communities will assist each IA in (i) acquiring land; (ii) implementing \nresettlement plans (RPs), the social development action plan (SDAP), and environmental management plan (EMP); \nand (iii) organizing local labor construction to ensure the participation and benefit of the Project to the poor, women, \nfloating population, and other vulnerable people. Local people, particularly affected people and ethnic minority groups, \nwill continue to be involved in the consultation and participation process, especially in the implementation of RPs, \nSDAP, and EMP. For the purpose of public disclosure, the EA, IAs, local governments, and village committees will \nreceive copies of all relevant documents. An ongoing public information program on health behavior and sanitation will \nbe continued in coordination with the Health Bureau and Environmental Protection Agency of the NMG. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe poverty and social assessment indicated that women strongly support the Project. Women in the PIA perceived \nthat the Project will (i) improve the environment, (ii) bring new development opportunities, (iii) create employment \nopportunities, and (iv) reduce the incidence of waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Discussion with representatives \nof the All-China Women\u2019s Federation indicated that women will need some assistance to fully benefit from the Project. \nThe poverty and social assessment indicated that (i) in rural areas, women primarily engage in agriculture; while in \nurban areas, they engage in service industries and small business; and (ii) male members of poor households and \nfloating population tend to travel further for migrant labor opportunities than nonpoor males, leaving behind a high \npercentage of households headed by women. To maximize the Project\u2019s impact on women, they will be given priority \nfor project-generated employment during construction and operation of the project facilities. The rise in female \nparticipation in the labor market will increase women\u2019s net income\u2014improving overall family welfare and increasing \nthe status of women. To address women\u2019s needs, social mitigation and enhancement measures have been built into \nthe project design and SDAP have been included in the RPs and SDAP (Supplementary Appendix H). \nHas an output been prepared?

The financial analysis was prepared in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s)  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects \nFinanced by the Asian Development Bank. Detailed discounted cash flow analysis and financial \nstatements are in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \nB.  Solid Waste Management Subproject and Qingxiushan Park Ecological Upgrading \nSubproject \n \n2.  For  the  solid  waste  management  subproject  and  the  Qingxiushan  Park  ecological \nupgrading subproject, the financial benefit-cost analysis\u2014financial discounted cash flow (DCF) \nanalysis\u2014was  conducted  in  real  terms  to  determine  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital \n(WACC),  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR),  financial  net  present  value  (FNPV),  and \naverage incremental financial cost (AIFC) (if applicable), to assess the financial viability of each \nsubproject and the incremental tariff required. Financial statement projections were developed \nin nominal price terms for the implementing agencies (IAs) for these two subprojects (Nanning \nShixi Solid Waste Treatment Company and the Nanning Qingxiu Mountain Scenic and Tourist \nResort Development Company) to (i) project the financial performance of the IAs, (ii) assess the \nprofitability and debt service ability, and (iii) test the tariff required for the IAs to raise funds for \nproject construction and achieve full cost recovery during the operation period. Purchasing \npower parity is the base assumption. \n \n1.  Solid Waste Management Subproject \n3.  The Nanning Environment and Sanitation Division is responsible for collecting solid \nwaste revenue, which is subsequently transferred to a special bank account established by the \nNanning Financial Bureau. Sixty-eight percent of the solid waste revenue will be allocated to the \nNanning  Environmental  and  Sanitation  Division  to  finance  capital  investment,  and  cover \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  other  expenses.  The  proposed  budget  should  be \nsubmitted to the Nanning Finance Bureau for approval before using the solid waste revenue. \nThe Shixi Solid Waste Treatment Company, incorporated on 8 July 2004, will be responsible for \nfinancing, constructing, and operating the solid waste management subproject.  \n \n4.  The Nanning municipal government (NMG) introduced a new tariff system on urban solid \nwaste in July 2003. The solid waste tariff will be levied on the urban solid waste discharged, \ncovering various categories including construction waste but excluding hazardous and industrial \nwaste. The NMG plans to progressively increase the solid waste tariff in the coming years. From \n10 July 2003 to 9 July 2005, each urban household was charged CNY7.0 per month on solid \nwaste, CNY7.5 per month per household from 10 July 2005 to 9 July 2007, and CNY8.0 per \nmonth per household from 10 July 2007 onward. Floating population, institutions, public and \nprivate establishments, and commercial and manufacturers have also been levied charges on \nsolid waste.  \n \n5.  While the new tariff system is an important step, it is crucial to strengthen tariff collection \nin accordance with government regulations to ensure the commercial viability of the solid waste \nutilities. Current solid waste tariff revenue collection rates and amounts by consumer categories \nwere determined to establish a reasonable basis for solid waste revenue projection and further \nanalysis. In 2004, the solid waste revenue collected from urban households was CNY15.25 \n ", "50  Appendix 12 \nmillion, with an estimated collection rate of about 45%; revenue collected from the floating \npopulation was CNY0.12 million, with an estimated collection rate of only about 1.1%; and \nrevenue collected from all other consumer categories was CNY8.36 million. \n6.  The solid waste revenue collection rate from urban households is assumed to improve \nfrom 45% in 2004 to 55% in 2005, 60% in 2008, and 65% in 2011 and onward; the collection \nrate from the floating population is assumed to improve from the current significantly low level of \n1.1% in 2004 to 5.0% in 2005, 8.0% in 2008, and 10.0% in 2011 and onward; solid waste \nrevenues from all other user categories are assumed to increase 5.0% annually from 2005, \n6.5% from 2008, and 8.0% from 2011. Of the 68% of solid waste revenues being transferred to \nthe Nanning Environment and Sanitation Division, 55% is assumed to be transferred to the IA \n(only 50% in 2008 as only 20% production capacity will be used at the end of 2008). The annual \ntransferred amount will remain constant at CNY17 million in real terms in 2012 and onward, with \nthe actual transferred percentage decreased from 55% to 51% in 2012, and further decreased \nto  only  21%  in  2032.  The  above  assumptions  on  project  revenues  are  based  on  overall \ncomputation to achieve full cost recovery in the DCF analyses for the subproject and financial \nstatement projections for the IA, and to limit the transferred percentage of the solid waste \nrevenues to the IA in order for the balance of the solid waste revenues being used for other \nsolid waste treatment facilities in the city. \n7.  The  DCF  analysis  covers  the  period  from  2006  to  2032,  while  income  statement, \nbalance sheet, and cash flow statement projections cover 2006 to 2017. It is assumed that all \ncomponents of the subproject are to be commissioned at the end of 2008 with only 20% \nproduction capacity, 60% in 2009, 80% in 2010, and full operational capacity in 2011. \n8.  The WACC of 4% is computed on an after-tax basis in real terms. The subproject\u2019s FIRR, \ncomputed on an after-tax basis, is 9.36%; this compares favorably with the WACC. Sensitivity \nanalysis indicates that the FIRR is robust under adverse conditions. Both the DCF analysis and \nfinancial statement projections have shown satisfactory results based on the step-by-step tariff \nincreasing plan. Implementation of the solid waste tariff increasing plan and strengthening of the \ncollection system to improve the collection rates are important to achieve full cost recovery and \nmaintain satisfactory financial performance and long-term sustainability. \n \n2.  Qingxiushan Park Ecological Upgrading Subproject \n9.  The Nanning Qingxiu Mountain Scenic and Tourist Resort Development Company is a \nstate-owned company established on 10 July 2000 with registered capital of CNY79.68 million \nunder the administration of Qingxiu Mountain Administration Committee. It was reincorporated \nin 2000 in accordance with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) company law as a solely \nstate-owned limited company. The company is the IA for the Qingxiushan Park ecological \nupgrading subproject. \n10.  The DCF analysis covers the period from 2006 to 2032. The WACC of 4% is computed \non an after-tax basis in real terms. The FIRR for the subproject, computed on an after-tax basis, \nis 9.14%; this compares favorably with the WACC. The subproject is considered both financially \nviable and sustainable. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the FIRR is robust under adverse \nconditions.  \n11.  The financial statement projections\u2014including income statement, balance sheet, and \ncash flow statement projections\u2014for the IA for the \u201cwithout-project\u201d scenario were prepared with \nhistorical financial statements from 2002 to 2004 as the starting basis, and then combined with \n ", "  Appendix 12  51 \nthe  financial  statement  projections  for  the  \u201cproject  only\u201d  scenario  to  arrive  at  the  financial \nstatement projections for the \u201cwith-project\u201d scenario covering the period from 2002 to 2018. \n12.  Both DCF analysis and financial statement projections have shown satisfactory results to \nachieve  full  cost  recovery  and  maintain  satisfactory  financial  performance  and  long-term \nsustainability.  \n \nC.    Xinxujiang and Kelijiang Rivers Environmental Upgrading Subprojects \n \n13.  The Xinxujiang River and Kelijiang River environmental upgrading subprojects are non-\nrevenue earning subprojects, so only economic analysis and justification are required and the \nFIRR is not relevant. O&M costs for each subproject were estimated and addressed for NMG to \nensure that adequate government budgetary funds will be transferred to cover the O&M costs \nrequired for normal day-to-day operation. O&M costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) \nfor  each  year  in  real  terms  will  be  about  CNY10.85  million  for  the  Xinxujiang  River \nenvironmental upgrading subproject and CNY14.89 million for the Kelijiang River environmental \nupgrading subproject. \n \n \n ", "52  Appendix 13 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Economic Evaluation of Technical Alternatives \n \n1.  Xinxujiang and Kelijiang Rivers Environmental Upgrading Subproject. The Kelijiang \nand Xinxujiang rivers upgrading subprojects did not have technical alternatives for the least cost \nanalysis. This was because the water volumes in the lakes were fixed for water quality and flood \ncapacity criteria, and the area available to accommodate the lakes was confined by existing \nfeatures: roads, dykes, outlet drainage levels, etc. The boundaries of the flood storage lakes \nwere  adjusted  to  accommodate  as  much  surplus  excavated  material  as  possible,  thus \nminimizing off-site haulage and disposal costs. A pragmatic solution was therefore adopted. \n \n2.  Solid Waste Management Subproject. The type of transfer station to be constructed for \nthe  solid  waste  management  subproject  was  assessed.  The  three  alternative  schemes \nexamined are (i) two-bay system, (ii) three-bay system, and (iii) two-bay system with load \nmaximization system. The average incremental economic cost (AIEC) of the three different \nalternatives was compared. The discount factor used is the economic opportunity cost of capital \nassumed at 12%. Based on the AIEC, the least cost option is the use of a two-bay transfer \nstation equipped with a load maximization system (alternative scheme iii); AIEC=35.9 CNY per \nton). The least cost analysis does not take into account the availability of land required for the \nthree-bay system (alternative scheme ii). \n \n3.  Qingxiushan  Park  Ecological  Upgrading  Subproject.  Three  alternative  schemes \nwere compared for the collection and disposal of the sewage generated in Qingxiushan Park. \nThe three alternative schemes are as follows: (i) sewage will be treated in the 12 independent \nwastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the different locations in the park, (ii) sewage will be \npumped to Langdong WWTP, and (iii) an independent WWTP will be used for lower areas in the \npark and sewage will be pumped to Langdong WWTP in higher areas. Based on the AIEC, the \nleast cost option is the pumping of the sewage to the Langdong WWTP for treatment and \ndisposal (alternative scheme ii); AIEC=1.86 CNY per cubic meter (m3).  \n \nB.  Economic Benefits \n \n4.  Xinxujiang and Kelijiang Rivers Environmental Upgrading Subproject. Economic \nbenefits identified include clean environment (aesthetic). The socioeconomic survey revealed \nthat,  in  the  Xinxujiang  area,  50%  of  people  perceive  that  pollution  is  the  most  serious \nenvironmental problem. The subproject is expected to (i) deter people from dumping waste into \nthe river and other open land areas near the river since green areas will be built on both sides of \nthe river (the perception persists that undeveloped land and water bodies can be used as a \ndumping area for waste); and (ii) reduce or avoid loss of life, damage to properties, and \ndisruption to economic activities due to floods. Beneficiaries will include (i) people downstream \nof the two rivers, since the subprojects will increase the water retention capacity to 2.91 million \nm3 for Xinxujiang River and 4.38 million m3 for Kelijiang River; (ii) avoidance of income loss and \nmedical expenses from diseases caused by wastewater and solid waste contamination (in the \nriver); (iii) reduction of the following river pollutants: (a) 557 tons per year (t/yr) of biological \noxygen demand (BOD ), (b) 2,200 t/yr of chemical oxygen demand (CODcr), (c) 392 t/yr of NH -\n5 3\nN, and (d) 35 t/yr of phosphor in Yongjiang River (Xinxujiang and Kelijiang rivers drain into \nYongjiang River) which is a major source of water supply of Nanning City; and (iv) increase in \nland values1 (if environmental benefits are not considered). \n                                                 \n1  The two subprojects will provide a minimum flood protection of 20-year return period and a maximum of 50-year \nreturn period in the areas adjacent to the two rivers. Properties adjacent to the two rivers are at risk to flood \ndamage beyond the flood protection level. \n ", "  Appendix 13  53 \n5.  Solid  Waste  Management  Subproject.  Benefits  include  (i)  clean  environment \n(aesthetic), (ii)  reduction  and/or  avoidance  of flood  (as  a  result  of  reduced  solid  waste  in \nrivers/canals/drainage system), and (iii) avoidance of income loss and medical expenses from \ndiseases caused by solid waste contamination. There are 33 small transfer stations with a \ncapacity  of  50  tons  in  the  service  area.  At  full  capacity  and  100%  efficiency,  they  can \naccommodate about 1,650 tons per day. However, limiting factors in the volume of waste \ncollected is the number of street sweepers/collectors (906 tricycles at present) which bring \ngarbage from the pick-up points to the different transfer stations, and the low efficiency of the \ncollection process. In the Kelijiang and Xinxujiang river basins, solid waste from nearby villages \n(mostly floating population) ends up in the river. This was supported by the results of the \nsocioeconomic survey: about 2% of respondents dump their solid waste in the river while 79% \nput it in a public garbage tank and/or residential garbage tank; 19% feed it to poultry or livestock \n(food waste) or dispose of it by other means. An indicative estimate of the health benefits \nassociated with the subproject is in Supplementary Appendix G. It is estimated that medical and \nincome loss avoided because of the Project will be CNY2.0 million in 2010 and CNY4.8 million \nin 2032. It is assumed that about 60% of this amount is attributed to the solid waste subproject. \n \n6.  Qingxiushan  Park  Ecological  Upgrading  Subproject. The main objectives of this \nsubproject are to counter the environmental imbalance caused by rapid urbanization of Nanning \ncity, and reduce pollution in the park resulting from wastewater generated by park visitors. \nBenefits identified are as follows: (i) reduced soil erosion (6,328 t/yr), (ii) reduced dust in the air \n(234 t/yr), (iii) increased rainwater retention (99,813 t/yr), (iv) reduced carbon dioxide (814 t/yr) \nand sulfur dioxide (41 t/yr) from the atmosphere, (v) increased tourism, (vi) income from sale of \ntree  seedlings  and  flowers,  (vii) protection  of  underground  water  (sewerage  component), \n(viii) increased  forest  stock,  (ix) reduced  worm  damage  in  trees  (because  of  the  proposed \nincrease arboreal mix and pest control), (x) reduced firefighting cost (because of proposed fire \nbarriers), and (xi) reduced damage to trees and flowers (because of the proposed monitoring \nstation). \n \nC.  Economic Costs \n \n7.  The economic costs include capital investment costs, operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncosts, opportunity cost of land, resettlement costs, environmental costs, and replacement cost \nof capital investment. Residual values were treated as negative costs at the end of the project \nlife. Shadow pricing was used to convert financial prices into economic prices.  \n \n8.  Capital Costs. The summary of the financial and economic costs of the four subprojects \nis shown in Table A13.1. \n \nTable A13.1: Summary of Capital Costs \n (CNY million) \nSubproject   Financial Costsa  Economic Costsb \nXinxujiang River Environmental Upgrading  527.0  508.8 \nKelijiang River Environmental Upgrading  696.2  670.6 \nSolid Waste Management  67.6  67.6 \nQingxiushan Park Ecological Upgrading  106.8  105.0 \n  Total  1,397.6  1,352.0 \na Net of taxes and land acquisition costs. \nb Net of taxes and land acquisition costs; using domestic price numeraire. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n ", "54  Appendix 13 \n9.  Opportunity  Cost  of  Land.  The  total  land  area  affected  by  the  four  subprojects \namounted to 238.4 hectares (ha). About 233.3 ha will be affected permanently while 5.1 ha will \nbe affected only during project construction. Net output foregone during construction is about \nCNY0.2  million  per  year  while  net  output  foregone  after  project  completion  is  about \nCNY7.9 million per year. \n \n10.  Operation, Maintenance, and Environmental Cost. O&M cost for the Xinxujiang River \nenvironmental upgrading subproject is about CNY10.5 million per year; for the Kelijiang River \nenvironmental upgrading subproject, CNY14.4 million per year; for the solid waste management \nsubproject, from CNY1.6 million to CNY9.0 million per year; and for the Qingxiushan Park \necological  upgrading  subproject,  CNY6.2  million  to  CNY37.4  million  per  year.  The \nenvironmental mitigation measure cost ranges from CNY0.015 million to CNY10.13 million per \nyear during construction and CNY0.13 million to CNY0.57 million per year during operation. \n \nD.  Summary of Benefits and Costs, and Sensitivity Analysis \n \n11.  The Project is considered economically feasible if the economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) is equal to or higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital (12%). In economic \nquantitative terms, except for the solid waste management subproject, the Project is viable. \nHowever, when reduction and/or avoidance of flood damage2 (as a result of reduced solid waste \nin rivers, canals, or drainage system) that can be attributed to the solid waste management \nsubproject can be quantified and included as one of the economic benefits, it is likely that the \nEIRR will exceed 12%. For the sensitivity analysis, the parameters tested are an increase in \ncapital costs and decrease in benefits. \n \nTable A13.2: EIRR and Sensitivity Test \n \nIncrease \nDecrease \nin  Switching \nin \nSubproject   EIRR (%)  Capital  Values(% )  \nBenefits \nCosts  EIRR = 12% \n(EIRR %) \n(EIRR %) \nCapital  Benefit \n       \nCost \nXinxujiang River Environmental Upgrading  24.0  22.1  14.9  +268  -67 \nKelijiang River Environmental Upgrading  22.1  20.0  13.1  +207  -62 \nSolid Waste Management  11.1  10.8  8.2      -7  +4 \nQingxiushan Park Ecological Upgrading  12.6  11.0  10.4     +6  -3 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n12.  Increasing the civil works cost component by 30% will result in an EIRR of 22.1% for the \nXinxujiang River environmental upgrading subproject and EIRR of 20.0% for the Kelijiang River \nenvironmental upgrading subproject. If the increase in the land value of the properties adjacent \nto the rivers will only be realized for the first 3 years after project completion, the EIRR will \ndecrease  to  14.9%  and  13.1%,  respectively.  The  EIRR  of  the  solid  waste  management \nsubproject will fall further to 10.8% and 8.2% when the capital cost is increased by 10% and the \nbenefits  are  reduced  by  10%,  respectively.  The  Qingxiushan  Park  ecological  upgrading \nsubproject\u2019s EIRR will reduce to 11.0% and 10.4% when the capital cost is increased by 20% \nand the benefits are reduced by 10%, respectively. \n \n                                                 \n2  The Implementing Agency estimated that, for the Xinxujiang river basin, flood damage that could be avoided \nbecause of the Project is about CNY11.03 million on an annual basis. \n ", "  Appendix 13  55 \n13.  For  the  switching  values,  the  capital  cost  for  the  Xinxujiang  River  environmental \nupgrading subproject needs to be increased by 268% or the benefits reduced by 67% to reduce \nthe EIRR to 12%; for the Kelijiang River environmental upgrading subproject, the capital cost \nneeds to be increased by 207% or the benefits reduced by 62% to reduce the EIRR to 12%. To \nmake the EIRR of the solid waste management subproject reach 12%, the capital cost needs to \nbe reduced by 7% or the benefits increased by 4%. For the Qingxiushan Park ecological \nupgrading subproject, the capital cost needs to be increased by 6% or the benefits reduced by \n3% to make the EIRR equal to 12%. \n \nE.  Affordability of Basic Services \n \n14.  Xinxujiang  and  Kelijiang  Rivers  Environmental  Upgrading  Subprojects.  The \nNanning municipal government (NMG) currently collects fees for flood control and protection \nfrom public and private entities. However, the rates being implemented are low and were not \nintended to cover the  full O&M cost of existing flood control facilities. The fee is not per \nhousehold but is charged per employed member of the family. The rates are CNY60 per year \nper employee if the monthly income is over CNY400, CNY40 per year per employee if the \nmonthly income is between CNY251 and CNY400, and zero if the monthly income is CNY250 or \nless. Farmers are not charged but should provide 15\u201320 days voluntary labor inputs per farmer \nper year. No new tariffs were proposed on completion of the subprojects. \n \n15.  Solid Waste Management Subproject. For the solid waste management subproject, no \nnew  tariff  rate  increases  are  proposed  except  those  already  approved  by  NMG  for \nimplementation in 2007 (CNY8 per household per month). In addition, NMG has some safety \nnets to support poor families and other economically vulnerable groups in the city, which include \ndiscount on or nonpayment of the monthly fee. \n \n16.  Qingxiushan Park Ecological Upgrading Subproject. The proposed entrance fees \n(2005 constant price) to the park after project completion are CNY20 (2010), CNY30 (2015), \nand CNY45 (2020). Affordability of the entrance fee to the low-income group is not really an \nissue since going to the park is not a basic need of the population. In any case, there are other \nfree  public  parks  in  the  city,  e.g.,  Nanhu  lake  park  (171  ha)  offers  a  wide  variety  of \nentertainment and amenities aside from green areas and trees around the lake. Qingxiushan \nPark management provides free and/or discounted entrance fee to elderly visitors (70 years old \nand above). Based on water company data, per capita water consumption in Nanning City is \n144.5 m3 per year. The number of persons per household is 3.75, based on the socioeconomic \nsurvey. The residential wastewater tariff was CNY0.5 per m3 of water used in 2005, while the \nsolid  waste  fee  per  household  was  CNY7.5  per  month.  Monthly  household  income  was \nestimated  at  CNY1,500  in  2005.  After  project  completion,  the  estimated  ratio  of  monthly \nexpense to household monthly income for basic services (solid waste, wastewater, and flood \ncontrol) is 2.68% (5.39% if water supply expense is included). \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20060629122711+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20060605090118+08'00'", "Title": "Proposed Loan People\u2019s Republic of China: Guangxi Nanning Urban Environmental Upgrading Project", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": "Vice President  C.
