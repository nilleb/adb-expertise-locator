An  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nAssessment  undertaken,  and  the  summary  was  circulated  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Board of Directors and made public on \nthe ADB website on 5 March 2004. The environmental impact \nassessment  was  approved  by  the  Ministry  of  Nature  and \nEnvironment on 12 May 2004 and concluded that the project will \nhave no major adverse impacts on the environment. As there has \nbeen no change in scope or design, the approved environmental \nimpact assessment is still applicable.  \n   \nRationale for the  The  recent  global  financial  crisis  has  had  a  major  impact  on \nSupplementary Loan and  Mongolia's economic performance and fiscal position due to the \nGrant  collapse of international commodity prices. Real gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth is projected to shrink from 8.9% in 2008 to \n2.7% in 2009. The current account balance changed dramatically, \nfrom a surplus of 6.7% of GDP in 2007 to a deficit of 9.6% of GDP \nin  2008,  and  gross  official  international  reserves  fell  from \n$1,001 million  in  2007  to  $657  million  in  2008.  The  general \ngovernment deficit was 5% of GDP in 2008, with a target of 6% in \n2009. Despite balance of payment support from the International \nMonetary  Fund  and  government  capital  expenditure  cuts,  the \ngovernment is still in need of $205 million in 2009\u20132010 to finance \nits budget. \n \nApproved in June 2004, the Regional Road Development Project \nis experiencing a cost overrun due to a combination of factors, \nincluding cost underestimation, implementation delay, and high \ninflation. It will not be possible to complete the 428 kilometer (km) \nroad  construction  from  Choyr  to  the  border  with  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  near  Zamyn-Uud  without  supplementary \nfinancing.   \n \nThe  supplementary  financing  will  provide  the  government  with \ntimely support to help mitigate the effect of the financial crisis, \nalleviate  the  negative  impact  of  expenditure  cutbacks  on \nemployment,  improve  Mongolia's  long-term  development \nprospects, and achieve the original objectives of the project. \n \nCompletion of the project will also increase the economic impact \nof  two  previous  ADB-financed  road  projects  connecting ", "ii   \n \nMongolia's major economic centers with the Russian Federation. \nSupplementary  financing  is  justified  under  ADB's  Operations \nManual section on supplementary financing. \n   \nInvestment Plan for the  The  investment  cost  of  the  supplementary  loan  and  grant  is \nSupplementary Loan and  estimated  at  $25.64  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \nGrant  $1.64 million. \n \nFinancing Plan for the  Total Amount  Percent \nSupplementary Loan and  Source    ($ million)  (%) \nGrant  ADB loan    8.00  31 \nADB grant    16.00  63 \nGovernment of Mongolia    1.64  6 \n          Total     25.64  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank \nSource: ADB estimates. \n   \nSupplementary Loan and  The government has requested ADB to provide a loan equivalent \nGrant Amount and Terms  to $8 million and a grant equivalent to $16 million from its Special \nFunds resources to help finance the project. The proposed loan \nwill have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nwith an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as set forth in the draft financing agreement. The grant \nwill be fully utilized before the loan is disbursed.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The  Ministry  of  Road,  Transportation,  Construction  and  Urban \nImplementation  Development will continue to be the executing agency for the \nArrangements  project. A project steering committee, comprising representatives \nof central government agencies and local governments, is already \nestablished. It will continue to supervise project implementation \nunder the proposed supplementary loan and grant.  \n \nProcurement  One civil works package for a 62 km road section will be procured \nunder  the  supplementary  financing.  It  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time)  and  will  follow  international \ncompetitive  bidding  using  the  single-stage,  two-envelope \nprocedure. \n \nThe government has requested ADB's approval of advance action \nto cover invitation for bids, bidding, bid evaluation, and limited \ncontract awards. The government has also requested approval of \nretroactive  financing  for  the  price  adjustment  for  contract \npackages  B1,  NP1,  and  AR2  to  enable  the  contractors  to \ncomplete the respective road sections. ", "  iii\nProject Benefits and  In spite of the substantial cost increase and implementation delay, \nBeneficiaries  the project remains economically viable. Using a 12% discount \nrate, the net present value is $21.3 million. The economic rate of \nreturn  is  16.2%.  The  supplementary  financing  will  enable \ncompletion of the project, which will benefit about 10,500 people, \naround 21.6% of whom are poor, and will improve connectivity \nand access to social services.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The  following  risks  have  been  considered  in  formulating  the \nsupplementary financing: cost overrun, implementation delay, and  \nnoncompletion of the 176 km road section to be financed by the \nMillennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). \n \nThe risk of cost overrun has been mitigated by basing the cost \nestimates on the detailed engineering design, updating the costs \nto the 2009 price level, and using relatively high-cost escalation \nfactors.  The  other  two  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  procuring \npackage NP2 using international competitive bidding single-stage, \ntwo-envelope procurement procedure, with advance procurement \naction and retroactive financing; and (ii) coordinating closely with \nthe MCC to support the implementation of the MCC-financed road \nsection. \n \n ", "96o  00'E 111o  00'E\nMONGOLIA\nREGIONAL ROAD DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nR  U  S  S  I  A  N        F  E  D  E  R  A  T  I  O  N\nHanh\n50U o l0a0a'nNbatyo sNohvoinsbtirsk Ulaangom Hatgal 50 o 00'N\nUVS Altanbulag\nHOVSGOL\nDayaTnsengel Nogoonnuur Naranbulag Tes Tsagaan-Uul Moron BULGANSuhbaatar SELENGE Ereentsav\nBAYAN- Olgiy Olgiy Selenge Darhan\nOLGIY Tudevtey Hutag-Ondor Erdenet DARHAN-UUL Bayan-Uul\nDORNOD Havirga\nHovd ZAVHAN Bulgan ORHONSumber\nARHANGAY ULAANBAATAR HENTIY Choybalsan\nManhan Uliastay Tsahir BattsHeisnhgiegl Ondor Lun ULAANBAABTaAgRanuur Batnorov\nDariv TOV Nalayh\nHOVD Tayshir Tsetserleg Zuunmod Maanit Ondorhaan Monhhaan Matad Tamsagbulag\nYarant Harhorin\nTakeshiken GOVISUMBER\nUyench Altay Bayanhongor Choyr Baruun-Urt\nto Urumqi TogroGgOVI-ALTAY Buutsagaan Nariynteel Arvayheer Mandalgovi SUHEBrAdeAnTetAsaRgaanBichigt\nOVORHANGAY\nDUNDGOVI Saynshand\nBurgastay BAYANHONGOR\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC Tsogt-Ovoo DORNOGOVI 62 km\nOF  CHINA Dalanzadgad Zamyn-Uud to Beijing\n42 o 00'N OMNOGOVI Bayan-Ovoo 42 o 00'N\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nGashuun Suhayt OF  CHINA \nN\n62 km Road Section to be financed \nWestern Region under the supplementary loan/grant\nNational Capital Road\n0 50 100150200250 Provincial Capital Railway\nCity/Town River\nKilometers\nADB-Financed Road (completed projects) Provincial Boundary\n0 ADB-Financed Road (other ongoing project) International Boundary\n9\n-3 ADB-Financed Road Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsupplementary loan and grant both to Mongolia for the Regional Road Development Project. \nThe revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Rationale \n \n2.  A report and recommendation of the President (RRP) to the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Board of Directors, approved in July 2004, established the rationale for the project.1 \nMongolia is the second largest landlocked country in the world. Transport in Mongolia was \ncostly and difficult and a major reason for this was that the road sector was underdeveloped. \nThe 49,250 kilometers (km) road network comprised 11,063 km of state roads and 38,187 km of \nlocal roads. Only 12% of these were paved, 13% were gravel roads, and 75% were earth roads. \nThe proportion of paved roads and the overall road density (0.03 km per square kilometer [km2]) \nwere very low compared with other countries. Moreover, due to inadequate maintenance, the \ncondition  of  many  paved  and  gravel  roads  was  deteriorating  and  a  large  portion  were \nimpassable during the rainy or winter seasons.  \n \n3.  The underdeveloped road network had seriously constrained the country's access to \nforeign markets. Mongolia depended on external trade with its two neighbors\u2014the People's \nRepublic of China (PRC) and the Russian Federation\u2014which are also two major sources of \nforeign direct investment. In particular, the PRC was Mongolia's largest source of foreign direct \ninvestment, its largest export market, and its second-largest source of imports (after the Russian \nFederation). Mongolia also used the port of Tianjin in the PRC, the closest seaport, for market \naccess  to  the  United  States  and  other  countries  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  The  majority  of \nMongolia's external trade was carried on the existing north\u2013south railway line, which provided \nthe transport connection between Suhbaatar at the northern border with the Russian Federation \nand the southern border with the PRC near Zamyn-Uud. While the railway was suitable for \ncarrying long-haul and bulk cargos, it was less flexible and responsive to the needs of private \ntraders for smaller freight and over shorter distances. Railway transport was also subject to the \nproblem of different gauges being used in Mongolia and the PRC.   \n \n4.  The  inadequate  road  network  hindered  investment  and  job  creation  and  limited \ncommunities' access to markets and social services. At the time of approving the project loan, \nMongolia was a poor country, with 35.6% of the population living in poverty and per capita gross \ndomestic product (GDP) of $505. About 57% of the population was aged 25 years or younger. \nThe project feasibility study showed that about 10,500 people, around 21.6% of whom were \nliving  in  poverty.  Poverty  was  largely  income-based  and  mainly  due  to  the  lack  of  job \nopportunities (18.4% unemployment rate) (footnote 1). \n \n5.  The government's road sector strategy aimed to improve the efficiency of road transport \nto facilitate the country's economic and social development. The strategy focused on (i) creating \na favorable environment for developing a competitive road transport industry, (ii) increasing \ninvestment on road construction and rehabilitation to reduce Mongolia's isolation from world \nmarkets and improve the accessibility of isolated communities within the country, (iii) increasing \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

", "2     \n \nfunding for road maintenance, (iv) improving the efficiency of state-owned transport enterprises, \nand (v) improving road safety.  \n \n6.  ADB's country strategy was to foster pro-poor economic growth to reduce poverty.2 The \nstrategy focused on support for (i) creating an environment conducive to private-sector-led \ngrowth,  (ii)  generating  employment,  (iii)  maintaining  standards  of  human  development,  (iv) \nstrengthening  and  reforming  the  social  protection  system,  and  (v)  undertaking governance \nreforms. Developing the road sector was among the strategic focuses of ADB operations. \nCompletion of the north\u2013south road corridor was considered a high priority.  \n \n7.   The project would complement ADB's previous support for paving road sections along \npart  of  the  north\u2013south  corridor  linking  Altanbulag  at  the  Russian  Federation  border  with \nUlaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, by extending the road corridor south to the border with the \nPRC.3 It would complete the first modern highway between Mongolia's economic centers and its \nmain  trading  partners,  and  thereby  significantly  increase  the  country's  capacity  to  access \nexternal markets and further develop its economy and reduce poverty. The approved project \nwas considered financially sustainable and economically viable with a 29.7% economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) at the appraisal stage. \n \nB.  Objective and Scope  \n \n8.  The  objective  of  the  project  was  to  promote  regional  cooperation  and  sustainable \neconomic growth in Mongolia by increasing transport efficiency and safety for domestic and \ninternational traffic on Mongolia's north\u2013south road corridor. The project had five components: \n \n(i)  Construction of the project road. Under the project, a 428 km paved road from \nChoyr to the border with the PRC near Zamyn-Uud would be constructed. The \nChoyr\u2013Zamyn-Uud section would be a two-lane paved road with 7.0 meter (m) \nwide pavement and 1.5 m shoulders. The section between Zamyn-Uud and the \nborder  with  the  PRC  would  be  a  four-lane  paved  road  with  14.0  m  wide \npavement and 2.0 m shoulders.  \n \n(ii)  Cross-border road transport facilitation plan. Consulting services of $230,000 \nto be provided under the project would assist the government to (a) develop a \ntransit traffic framework agreement with the PRC and the Russian Federation, (b) \nestablish  regulations  on  cross-border  vehicles  according  to  international \nstandards, (c) negotiate with the PRC on increased access of Mongolian vehicles \nto PRC territory, (d) collect vehicle fees for road maintenance, (e) improve the \nroad  between  Zamyn-Uud  and  the  border  with  the  PRC,  (f) enforce  vehicle \nweight  control,  and  (g)  establish  emergency  services  for  vehicles  and \npassengers traveling on the north\u2013south road corridor. \n \n(iii)  Road safety improvement. This component comprised (a) installing road safety \nfeatures on the Altanbulag\u2013Ulaanbaatar section, (b) an independent road safety \naudit of the detailed design of the project, (c) distributing pamphlets and posters \non  road  safety  to  raise  public  awareness,  (d)  procuring  two  patrol  vehicles \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2003.

This  component  comprised  (a)  constructing \naccess roads totaling 40.5 km, (b) establishing roadside stations, (c) training \nlocal  laborers  in  road  construction  and  maintenance,  and  (d)  stakeholder \nparticipation.  \n \n(v)  Awareness and prevention of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. A technical \nassistance (TA) grant of $350,000 was provided to mitigate the risk of HIV/AIDS \nand human trafficking along the project road.  \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n \n9.  The project, including taxes, duties, and interest during construction, was estimated to \ncost  $78.14  million  equivalent.  ADB  provided  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR25,505,000 ($37.13 million) from ADB's Special Funds resources, financing 50% of the civil \nworks cost and 47.5% of the total project cost. The ADB loan was provided over 32 years, with \na grace period of 8 years and an interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \n10.  The Economic Development Cooperation Fund of the Republic of Korea (EDCF Korea) \nand the PRC cofinanced the project road on a parallel basis. The fund extended a loan of \n$23.88 million equivalent on concessional terms to finance 30.6% of the total project cost. The \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China provided a grant of $1.5 million equivalent to \nfinance 1.9% of the total project cost; this was subsequently increased to $3.2 million.  \n \n11.  In February 2007, ADB increased the loan amount to SDR28,343,456.86 by transferring \nto the project the surplus loan proceeds of SDR2,838,456.86 (about $4.5 million equivalent) \nfrom the completed Second Roads Development Project. This was to partly offset a shortfall in \nthe financing plan, as bid prices for civil works were much higher than originally estimated.

Status and Progress of Project Implementation  \n \n12.  Overall  project  progress.  As  of  30  September  2009,  overall  progress  of  project \nimplementation was estimated at 42.4%, compared to the loan elapsed period of 95%. As of \n1 December  2009,  the  cumulative  actual  contract  awards  totaled  $37.21  million,  while \ncumulative actual disbursements were $21.97 million. The project performance report rated the \noverall project implementation progress partly satisfactory because the delay in implementation \nwas more than 40% compared with the original appraisal schedule. On 3 December 2009, ADB \napproved an extension of the loan closing date by 24 months from 1 January 2010 to 31 \nDecember 2011. The status of the implementation of individual project components is described \nin paras. 13\u201328.  \n \n1.  Part A: Construction of the Project Road  \n \n13.  Construction of the 428 km road was cofinanced by EDCF Korea and the PRC. The \ndivision of responsibility was that (i) EDCF Korea would finance the 176 km section from Choyr \nto 8 km before the 35th railway crossing (package A), (ii) ADB would finance the 252.4 km \nsection from 8 km before the 35th railway crossing to Zamyn-Uud, and (iii) the PRC would \nfinance the 3.3 km section from Zamyn-Uud to the border with the PRC.  \n ", "    5\n14.  Originally, the ADB-financed section was to be a single contract package for 252.4 km. \nIn 2005, it was split into two packages (B1 and B2) to encourage competition and speed up \nconstruction. The results of the bidding in October 2006 indicated that the lowest evaluated \nresponsive bid price was $26.24 million for package B1 and $31.17 million for package B2. \nAccording to the financing plan in the 2004 RRP (footnote 1), the available financial resources \nfor both packages (excluding contingency allocation from both ADB and the government) was \nonly  $26.82  million.  Consequently,  the  government  and  ADB  decided  to  award  B1  and \nsubdivide and rebid package B2 in two packages (NP1 and NP2), with the government to \nfinance NP2 in its entirety. \n \n15.  As the project area is semiarid and sparsely vegetated steppe, there are plans to plant \nvegetation along the project road. As the civil works construction work is ongoing, planting has \nbeen deferred.  \n \na.  Package A Financed by EDCF Korea \n \n16.  The contract with a value of $31 million was signed on 4 April 2007. Since the funding \nprovided by EDCF Korea was only $23.9 million, the government agreed to finance the balance \nof  the  contract  amount.  Construction  commenced  in  June  2007  and  was  expected  to  be \ncompleted  by  the  end  of  October  2008.  However,  in  mid-2008,  after  8% implementation \nprogress, the contractor requested additional financing on the basis of input price increases and \ndepreciation of the won, and stopped all construction activities and withdrew its workforce. The \ngovernment did not accept the request and decided to use EDCF Korea funds for a different \nproject. Instead, the government requested the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) to \nfinance this section, which approved a grant of $47.2 million on 9 December 2009. \n \nb.  Package B1 under ADB Funding \n \n17.  The contract for $24.04 million for construction of the 131.3 km road section from the \n35th railway crossing to the 18th Khudag of Choyr\u2013Saynshand\u2013Zamyn-Uud was signed on \n28 December 2006. Construction commenced on 21 January 2007 and was scheduled for \ncompletion by 31 October 2008. As of 30 September 2009, cumulative physical progress was \nestimated at 59%. In May 2008, the contractor requested a price adjustment and then withdrew \npart of the workforce. In view of the double-digit inflation in 2007 and 2008, and substantial price \nincreases  in  road  construction  materials,  the  government  negotiated  a  one-time  price \nadjustment of $3 million to the existing contract and has requested ADB to finance this from the \nproposed supplementary financing. The contractor has agreed to restart construction in March \n2010 and complete the works by October 2010.  \n \nc.  Package NP1 under ADB Funding \n \n18.  ADB approved the award of the contract for the construction of the 62.2 km road from \nthe 18th Khudag to the 62.2 kilometer post on 22 February 2008. The contract for $11.38 million \nwas signed on 16 April 2008. Work commenced in May 2008 and was to be completed by \n30 June 2009. The cumulative physical progress of civil works as of the end of July 2009 was \nestimated at 10.2% and completion is expected by October 2010. The contractor has submitted \na price adjustment claim but not slowed down its work. Similar to the case of package B1, the \ngovernment has negotiated a one-time price adjustment of $0.78 million and requested ADB to \ncover the additional expenses from the proposed supplementary financing.  \n \n ", "6     \n \nd.  Package NP2 under Government Funding   \n \n19.  The cost of construction of this 62 km road section was to be met by the government. \nThe government twice attempted to award the contract on deferred payment terms without \nsuccess. Subsequently, as a result of the recent financial crisis, and having entered into a \nstand-by arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in April 2009, the government \nhas had to cut public expenditure, and is no longer able to finance this section. It has requested \nADB  to  take  over  financing  of  this  contract package  through  the  proposed  supplementary \nfinancing.  \n \ne.  Civil Work Package under People\u2019s Republic of China Funding \n \n20.  The construction of the road from Zamyn-Uud to the state border (3.3 km) through grant \nfunding provided by the PRC was successfully completed in October 2005. The total cost of the \ncompleted road was $3.2 million, compared with an appraisal estimate of $1.5 million. The \nGovernment  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  provided  the  additional  funds  required  to \ncomplete this road section.  \n \n2.  Part B: Implementation of a Cross-Border Road Transport Facilitation Plan   \n \n21.  The  cross-border  facilitation  plan  was  approved  on  19  January  2005.  A  tripartite \nagreement  with  the  Russian  Federation  and  the  PRC  is  under  negotiation,  and  bilateral \nagreements  are  regularly  updated.  To  assist  the  government  in  implementing  the  plan,  a \nconsulting firm will be recruited in the 2nd quarter of 2010 (to provide 10 international person-\nmonths and 16 national person-months of consulting services). \n \n  3.  Part C: Road Safety Improvement \n \n22.  Two  individual  consultants  (one  international  and  one  national)  were  recruited  in \nOctober 2007 to jointly audit the road safety aspects of the detailed design of the project road \nand  the  Ulaanbaatar\u2013Altanbulag  road.  The  final  report  was  submitted  on  25  April  2008. \nSubsequently,  a  contract  was  awarded  in  September  2008  to  implement  the  road  safety \nimprovements of the Ulaanbaatar\u2013Altanbulag road. The contract was successfully completed by \nthe end of the 3rd quarter of 2009.   \n \n23.  An international consultant will be recruited for 2 person-months to train traffic police \nofficers  on  traffic  regulations  3  months  prior  to  the  completion  of  road  construction  work. \nTogether with this training, distribution of pamphlets and posters on road safety to raise public \nawareness is also planned. Procurement of vehicles and two-way communication radios is \nplanned to take place in parallel with road opening in 2012.   \n \n  4.  Part D: Area Development \n \n24.  To facilitate movement of people and goods between towns in the project area, four \naccess roads totaling 40.5 km were to be constructed under the project. In September 2008, \nADB approved the award of contract package AR1 for construction of a 15.5 km access road \nfrom the project main road to Erdene Soum. However, in view of the financing shortfall of the \nproject, the Ministry of Finance did not consent to awarding the contract. As the bidding was \ncarried out in early 2008, the government has requested ADB's approval for rebidding this \npackage. Adequate funds are available under the existing loan to finance package AR1 and the \ncontract package will continue to be financed under the existing loan.  ", "    7\n25.  For package AR2, to construct an 18.25 km access road from the main road to Orgon \nSoum,  the  executing  agency  signed  the  contract  for  $2.0  million  on  24  January  2008. \nConstruction commenced in March 2008 and is expected to be completed by August 2010. The \ncontractor has submitted a price adjustment claim, and, similar to packages B1 and NP1, the \ngovernment has negotiated a one-time price adjustment of $0.18 million.  \n \n26.  The Road Supervision Research Center conducted the first batch of the training program \nfor  20  construction  workers  and  40  semi-skilled  equipment  operators  from  1  March  to \n30 April 2007. The second batch of the training program is planned to be undertaken before \n2011.  \n \n27.  Stakeholder participation will commence after additional financial arrangements for the \nconstruction of all road sections of the main road have been finalized. A consulting firm will be \nrecruited to help the government to continue the stakeholder participation process providing \ntraining  for  small  enterprises,  skills  development,  and  support  for  vulnerable  groups. \nConsultations will start in April 2010 and stakeholder participation discussions will be conducted \non an intermittent basis until the end of 2010.  \n \n5.  Part E: Awareness and Prevention of HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking \n \n28.  To help mitigate the potential risks of HIV/AIDS transmission and human trafficking \nalong the north\u2013south corridor after project completion, ADB provided TA for Awareness and \nPrevention of HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking for $350,000 (footnote 1). The Ministry of Health \nwas the executing agency for the TA. Four individual consultants (one international consultant \nfor 2 person-months and three national consultants for 57 person-months) with expertise in \nhuman  trafficking,  health  education  and  advocacy,  HIV/AIDS  medical  services,  and \nepidemiological  surveillance  and  monitoring  were  recruited.  Consultants  under  the  TA \ncommenced services on 1 January 2006 and activities were completed in July 2009.  \n \n6.  Compliance with Loan Covenants \n \n29.  The loan covenants have been or are being complied with,4 except for implementation of \nthe cross-border road transport facilitation plan. The compliance status of the project loan \ncovenants is given in Supplementary Appendix A. The transit transport agreement between \nMongolia, the PRC, and the Russian Federation has not been finalized and may take longer \nthan  expected.  The  Government  of  the  Russian  Federation  has  indicated  that  the  draft \nagreement needs to be renegotiated. Bilateral agreements are already in place and the traffic \nforecast  does  not  depend  on  the  tripartite  agreement.  Hence,  the  absence  of  a  tripartite \nagreement will not adversely affect the project. \n \n7.   Strength and Weaknesses of the Project \n \n30.  The project road is a lifeline for Mongolia, and the government has accorded the highest \npriority to the project. Completion of the project road will (i) increase the economic impact of the \nprevious support of the government and ADB for connecting the main economic and population \ncenters in Mongolia with both the Russian Federation and the PRC; (ii) strengthen economic \nties between Mongolia and those countries; (iii) increase the flexibility, efficiency, and reliability \n                                                 \n4  Project steering committee meetings were only held once in 2005 and 2006. ADB noted this in its loan review \nmission in 2006 and requested the government to adhere to the loan covenant (at least once every 6 months). This \ncovenant was complied with in 2007 and 2008. \n ", "8     \n \nof Mongolia's transport system; and (iv) enable Mongolia to tap economic opportunities offered \nby other countries in the region.   \n \n31.  The main weaknesses of the project are that (i) it was approved using the cost estimates \nbased  on  the  design  parameters  for  typical  sections,  without  detailed  information  on  the \ntopographic and geotechnical conditions of the project road, and this has contributed to cost \nunderestimation  and  to  the  financing  shortfall  for  the  project;  and  (ii)  it  has  experienced \nimplementation delays during both procurement and contract implementation and, taking into \naccount  the  very  short  construction  season  in  Mongolia,  this  exposed  the  project  to  cost \nescalation pressures during the recent period of very high inflation in Mongolia.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY LOAN AND GRANT \n \nA.  Cost Overrun and Financing Scope \n \n32.  Cost  overrun.  The  supplementary  financing  is  proposed  due  to  cost  overrun.  The \nupdated cost of civil works for the project is estimated to be $115.46 million in 2009 prices, and \nthe total project is estimated to cost $141.90 million. This represents a 114% increase over the \noriginal cost estimate of $53.97 million for civil works and an 82% increase over the original total \nproject cost estimate of $78.14 million.  \n \n33.  The  cost  overrun  is  attributable  to  two  major  factors:  cost  underestimation,  and \nimplementation delay combined with high inflation. The cost estimates in the 2004 RRP were \nbased on very preliminary engineering design at the feasibility study stage, relying on rough \nestimates of work items and quantities. Consequently, this led to major differences between the \nfeasibility and detailed design stages in terms of the work items and quantities, which are major \ncost factors. These are estimated to account for an increase of $27.14 million in civil works cost \nfor the Choyr\u2013Zamyn-Uud section (Appendix 2).  \n \n34.  Very high inflation during the project implementation period accounts for the remainder \nof the cost overrun. The annual increase in Mongolia's consumer price index was 9.6% in 2005, \n5.9% in 2006, 14.1% in 2007, and 23.1% in 2008.5 The prices of the main road construction \nmaterials soared. For example, between 2006 and 2008, the price of bitumen increased by \n117%, the price of diesel rose by 154%, and the price of petrol rose by 193%. \n \n35.  The problem of high inflation was exacerbated by delays in project implementation, \nwhich  meant  that  civil  works  contracts  were  awarded  later  than  scheduled  and  their \nimplementation  has  taken  longer  than  expected.  Bidders  have  quoted  higher  prices,  and \ncontractors  have  sought  contract  price  escalations  when  implementation  was  delayed  for \nreasons beyond their control. According to the original implementation schedule, the contract for \nthe ADB-financed section was to be awarded in the fourth quarter of 2005, and construction was \nto commence in the second quarter of 2006 and be completed by October 2009. Contract B1 \nwas awarded in December 2006, contract NP1 was awarded in April 2008, contract AR2 was \nawarded in January 2008, and contracts NP2 and AR1 have not yet been awarded. Contracts \nB1,  NP1,  and  AR2  are  expected  to  be  completed  in  2010,  but  contract  NP2  will  not  be \ncompleted until the end of 2012, and contract AR1 will not be completed until October 2011. \nOverall, completion of the project road will be 3.5 years behind the original schedule. The \ncontractors for packages A, NP1, and AR2 have cited various sources of delays that were \n                                                 \n5  Inflation based on the consumer price index peaked in August 2008 at 34.2%. World Bank. 2009. Mongolia \nMonthly Economic Update. Washington, DC. Inflation based on the consumer price index is forecast at 7% in 2010, \n5.5% in 2011, and 5.5% in 2012. ", "    9\nbeyond their control, including delays in issuing work permits, delays in customs clearance of \nconstruction equipment, late payment, and changes in engineering designs. Such delays had a \nheightened impact because of the short duration of the annual construction season in Mongolia.   \n \n36.  Financing scope. The supplementary financing will cover (i) the remaining 62 km road \nsection (NP2), which the government is no longer able to finance following the financial crisis \nand  having  entered  into  a  stand-by  arrangement  with  the  IMF;6 (ii) price  adjustments  for \ncontracts B1, NP1, and AR2; and (iii) related additional project administration costs such as \nsalaries and office expenses, which were financed under the main loan.  \n \n37.  Although contracts B1, NP1, and AR2 are fixed-price contracts, the government wishes \nto  settle  the  contractors\u2019  claims  amicably  due  to  the  following:  (i)  prices  of  main  road \nconstruction materials increased sharply due to high inflation in Mongolia in 2007 and 2008 \n(para. 34 and Appendix 2); and (ii) termination of contracts may result in lengthy legal disputes \nand will further delay completion of the project roads. The government has requested ADB to \nfinance the price adjustment under the supplementary financing. In parallel with the processing \nof the supplementary financing, the approval of the ADB Procurement Committee has been \nsought with respect to contract variations for the price adjustments, in accordance with an ADB \nmemorandum on price adjustments in ADB-financed contracts due to high inflation.7  \n \nB.  Impact on the Project \n \n38.  The cost overrun since 2005 has seriously hampered the construction of the project \nroad, a major component of the project. After entering into a stand-by arrangement with the IMF, \nthe government is no longer able to finance package NP2 that covers the 62 km section of the \nnorth\u2013south road corridor. The cost overrun also threatens completion of two of the other \npackages that form part of the corridor (package B1, 131.1 km; and package NP1, 62.2 km), as \nwell as one of the access roads (package AR2, 18.25 km). The contractors for these three \npackages have filed claims for additional payment, and the government has agreed to pay an \nadditional $3 million to the B1 contractor, $766,725 to the NP1 contractor, and $178,758 to the \nAR2 contractor. However, the original loan will not be able to finance these contract variations. If \nthese variations are not approved, the likely consequence would be termination of the contracts \nby the contractors without completing the works.  \n \n39.  Package AR1 has already been adversely affected by the financing shortfall. Although \nthe bidding process was completed and ADB endorsed the contract award in September 2008, \nthe government did not want to award the contract until additional financing is secured. \n \n40.  The supplementary financing will enable the government to complete the project and \nrealize  the  benefits  of  establishing  a  modern  highway  link  enabling  efficient  transportation \nbetween Mongolia's economic centers and its main trading partners. These benefits will not be \nrealized if the civil works of contracts B1, NP1, NP2, AR1, and AR2 are not completed.    \n \nC.  Rationale \n \n41.  Dependent on mineral exports, Mongolia's economy and fiscal position are vulnerable to \nexogenous  shocks.  The  recent  global  financial  crisis  caused  a  sharp  fall  in  the  prices  of \nMongolia's major export commodities. Most notably in 2009, the price of copper dropped by \n                                                 \n6  IMF. 2009. Request for Stand-By Arrangement.

This had a major impact on Mongolian economic performance and \naggravated its balance of payments and fiscal imbalances. Real GDP growth was projected to \nshrink from 8.9% in 2008 to 2.7% in 2009. The current account balance changed dramatically \nfrom a surplus of 6.7% of GDP in 2007 to a deficit of 9.6% of GDP in 2008, and gross official \ninternational reserves fell from $1,001 million in 2007 to $657 million in 2008. The general \ngovernment deficit was 5% of GDP in 2008, with a target of 6% in 2009. Despite IMF support \nand the government's substantial adjustment of the fiscal position by reducing expenditure and \nincreasing revenue, financing of the budget remains difficult, and about $205 million in 2009\u2013\n2010 will be required from other sources.8   \n \n42.  The supplementary financing will provide the government with timely support to help \nmitigate the effect of the financial crisis, alleviate the negative impact of the expenditure outlook \non employment, improve Mongolia's long-term development prospects, and achieve the original \nobjectives of the project.  \n \n43.  Completion of the Choyr\u2013Zamyn-Uud road corridor with additional financial resources \nfrom  ADB  will  also increase  the economic  impact  of  the  two  previous  ADB-financed  road \nprojects, and deepen regional integration. Since 1995, ADB has been supporting a sequenced \nimprovement  of  the  north\u2013south  regional  transport  corridor  which  forms  part  of  the  Asian \nHighway Network and is a Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation priority corridor. The \nRoads Development Project (footnote 3) financed construction of a 312 km paved road from \nUlaanbaatar  to  Altanbulag  (border  with  the  Russian  Federation),  and  the  Second  Roads \nDevelopment Project (footnote 3) financed construction of a 220 km paved national road from \nNalayh to Choyr. The project is a continuation of this road and will extend it to the border with \nthe PRC. Completion of this 1,000 km trunk road will generate more economic opportunities for \nMongolia,  and  benefit  other  countries  in  the  region,  especially  the  PRC  and  the  Russian \nFederation. Furthermore, the project road is a prerequisite for proposed ADB development \nactivities such as the Regional Logistics Development Project9 and the Southeast Gobi Urban \nand Border Town Development Project10 in Zamyn-Uud.  \n \n44.  Supplementary  financing  is  justified  under  the  Operations  Manual  section  on \nsupplementary financing, which states that ADB may provide supplementary financing to cover \na financing gap or a cost overrun on an ADB-financed project, provided that (i) the project \ncontinues to be a priority in the government\u2019s development strategy, and (ii) supplementary \nfinancing will help achieve the original project objectives and benefits.11  \n \nD.  Revised Cost Estimates \n \n45.  Costs  to  be  financed  by  the  supplementary  loan  and  grant  are  estimated  at \n$25.64 million equivalent, including civil works cost of contract NP2 (62 km), price adjustments \non the existing ADB-financed contract packages (contracts B1, NP1, and AR2), additional \nproject administration costs, and taxes and duties of $1.64 million. The costs are summarized in \nTable 2. \n                                                 \n8  IMF. 2009. Request for Stand-By Arrangement. Washington, DC.  \n9  ADB. 2008.

Revised Financing Plan \n \n47.  For the supplementary financing, the government has requested ADB to provide an \nAsian Development Fund (ADF) grant ($16 million) and an ADF loan ($8 million) for a total of \n$24 million from ADB's Special Funds resources to meet the financial needs of the project. The \nADF loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest \ncharge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter and such \n ", "12    \n \nother terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan and grant agreement. The ADF grant will \nbe fully utilized before the ADF loan is disbursed (Appendix 4).  \n \n48.  ADB  will  finance  94%  of  the  total  cost  of  the  supplementary  financing,  and  the \ngovernment will provide $1.64 million equivalent to finance all local taxes and duties. The \nfinancing plan is summarized in Table 4 and detailed in Appendix 4. \n \nTable 4: Financing Plan for Supplementary Loan and Grant \n($ million) \nShare of \nSource  Amount  Total (%) \nADB loan  8.00  31 \nADB grant  16.00  63 \nGovernment of Mongolia  1.64  6 \n          Total   25.64  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank.                \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n49.  The revised overall financing plan for the project is in Table 5. ADB's total financial \nassistance for the project will amount to $68.09 million equivalent, including the supplementary \nfinancing. This will finance 48% of the revised total project cost. \n \nTable 5: Financing Plan for the Project  \n($ million) \nShare of \nSource  Amount  Total (%) \nADB loan a  44.09  31 \nADB supplementary loan  8.00  6 \nADB supplementary grant  16.00  11 \nMillennium Challenge Corporation  47.20  34 \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea b  4.59  3 \nGovernment of the People's Republic of China  3.20  2 \nGovernment of Mongolia  18.82  13 \n         Total  141.90  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank.  \na ADB  provided  a  loan  of  SDR25.50  million  in  June  2004  and  transferred  loan  savings  of \nSDR2.84 million from the Second Roads Development Project (Loan 1700-MON) in February \n2007.  \nb $23.88 million approved but only $4.59 million utilized.  \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n50.  The MCC has extended a grant of $47.2 million to finance the civil works and related \nconstruction  supervision  consulting  services  to  finance  the  176  km  road  section  that  was \noriginally  to  be  financed  by  EDCF  Korea.  The  MCC  grant  will  be  provided  on  a  parallel \ncofinancing basis. The PRC grant of $3.2 million has been fully utilized.  \n \nF.  Changes in Implementation Arrangements  \n51.  The Ministry of Road, Transportation, Construction and Urban Development will be the \nexecuting agency for the project. The implementation arrangements on accounting, auditing and \nreporting, and project management arrangements for the supplementary financing remain the \nsame as those for the main project.  ", "    13\n52.  Implementation period. As stated in the 2004 RRP (footnote 1), the project was to be \ncompleted by 31 July 2009, with an ADB loan closing date of 1 January 2010. According to the \nrevised implementation schedule (Appendix 5), packages B1, NP1, and AR2 are expected to be \ncompleted by the end of 2010; and package AR1 will be completed in the third quarter of 2011. \nPackage NP2, which is to be financed by the supplementary loan, is expected to be completed \nby the end of June 2013. To enable the completion of packages B1, NP1, AR1, and AR2 under \nthe original loan on 3 December 2009, ADB approved an extension of the loan closing date by \n2 years from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011. To complete package NP2 under the \nsupplementary  financing,  the  loan  closing  date  will  have  to  be  further  extended  to \n31 December 2013.  \n \n53.  Procurement.  Only  one  package  (NP2)  will  be  procured  under  the  supplementary \nfinancing (Appendix 6). The civil works for package NP2 will be procured in accordance with \nADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  will  follow  the \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) single-stage, two-envelope procedure, as the estimated \ncontract value exceeds $1 million\u2014the ICB threshold for civil works in Mongolia.  \n \n54.  Disbursement  arrangements.  The  supplementary  financial  assistance  will  be \ndisbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). The civil work contracts will be disbursed using ADB\u2019s direct payment procedures. \nThe original loan will at all times and in all respects be held, used, committed, invested, or \notherwise disposed of entirely before supplementary financing is used. The $16 million grant will \nbe used, committed, invested, or otherwise disposed of entirely before the $8 million loan is \nused.  The  current  imprest  account  for  the  main  loan,  which  was  originally  used  for \ndisbursements for expenditure of the project implementation unit, will be continued to cover the \ndisbursement of loan funds of the original loan. Two new imprest accounts will be opened under \nthe supplementary financing\u2014one for the loan, and one for the grant. The imprest accounts will \nbe opened at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB, and the ceiling of each of the imprest \naccounts will be set as either the estimated expenditures to be financed through the respective \nimprest account for the next 6 months, or $500,000, whichever is lower. ADB's statement of \nexpenditure  procedures  may  be  used  for  reimbursing  eligible  expenses  and  liquidating \nadvances from the imprest accounts. Any individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated \nunder the statement of expenditure procedure will not exceed $100,000 equivalent. \n \n55.  Advance  action  and  retroactive  financing.  To  speed  up  the  contract  award  for \npackage NP2, the government has requested ADB's approval of advance action so that ADB \ncan review the procurement process without waiting for approval of the supplementary financing. \nAdvance action covers invitation for bids, bidding, bid evaluation, and limited contract awards. \nThe government has also requested approval of retroactive financing for the price adjustment \nfor packages B1, NP1, and AR2 to enable the contractors to complete the respective road \nsections.  Advance  contracting  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  and  retroactive  financing  not  exceeding  20%  of  the  total  ADB  supplementary \nfinancing arrangement will be extended. The government will also be advised that approval of \nthe advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project \nand that the expenditure must have been incurred before loan effectiveness but no earlier than \n12 months before the date of signing of the supplementary financial agreement. It was agreed \nthat ICB procedures will be used for procuring civil works contract packages under retroactive \nfinancing.  \n \n56.  Anticorruption policy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the executing agency. Consistent with its \n ", "14    \n \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the \nproject. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the project shall include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the \nexecuting agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they \nrelate to the project. ADB\u2019s midterm review of the original loan found no indication of any \npotential fraud or corruption. The government will continue to ensure that the project funds are \nutilized effectively and efficiently to implement the project and to achieve its objectives.  \n \n57.  Project performance monitoring and evaluation. The project will be monitored and \nevaluated  against  the  revised  design  and  monitoring  framework  with  updated  baseline \nindicators (Appendix 1). \n \nG.  Remedial Steps \n \n58.  To  ensure  the  revised  implementation  schedule  is  adhered  to,  ADB  will  assist  the \ngovernment to (i) finalize the bidding documents for package NP2, (ii) undertake bidding and \naward the contract for package NP2, (iii) award the contract for package AR1, (iv) increase the \nnumber of project supervision missions from one to two each year, (v) coordinate with the MCC \non the implementation of package A, and (vi) work with the government to complete the other \nproject activities on schedule. \n \nIV.   PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic Benefits \n \n59.  Despite the cost increase and implementation delay, the project remains economically \nviable.  The  economic  analysis  has  been  recalculated  using  the  same  methodology, \nassumptions,  and  baseline  traffic  as  in  the  2004  RRP  (footnote  1),  incorporating  updated \ninformation on project capital cost, traffic growth rate, fuel prices, vehicle operating costs, and \nproject schedule reflecting the 4 year delay in completion. The analysis covers a period of \n20 years from 2006 to 2025.  \n \n60.  The economic costs of the project comprise capital costs\u2014including labor, equipment, \nmaterials,  consulting  services,  and  physical  contingency\u2014and  maintenance  costs.  The \nopportunity cost of land is assumed to be zero since the land along the alignment is of low \nquality and does not have an alternative productive use.  \n \n61.  The economic benefits consist of savings in vehicle operating costs, time savings for \nroad users, and benefits from the generated traffic. Unquantified economic benefits include the \ncontribution  of  improved  transport  to  economic  diversification  and  trade  development,  and \nimproved access to economic opportunities and social services.  \n \n62.  Using a 12% discount rate, the net present value of the project is $21.3 million. The \nestimated EIRR is 16.2%. Sensitivity analysis shows that the project remains economically \nviable if costs rise by 15% or benefits are reduced by 15%. If these changes are combined, the \nEIRR would be reduced to 11.5%. The economic analysis is in Appendix 7. \n ", "    15\nB.  Social Impact  \n63.  Supplementary financing will bring benefits to about 10,500 people along the 62 km road \nsection, roughly 21.6% of whom are poor. The project will benefit poor people by enabling the \ndevelopment of the local livestock industry through improved access to domestic and regional \nmarkets. It will also improve connectivity between local towns and aimags (provinces), and \nimprove access to higher-quality social services in Ulaanbaatar. The project will directly and \nindirectly generate local economic benefits during construction and operation.  \n64.  The  main  social  risks  concern  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  These  have  been \naddressed through prevention and awareness measures for contractors, laborers, and local \ncommunities,  which  were  financed  by  an  associated  TA  (footnote  1).  Establishment  of  a \nvoluntary  counseling  and  testing  center,  together  with  provision  of  (i)  required  equipment, \n(ii) drugs and tests for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, (iii) information, \neducation, and communication materials, and (iv) training, contributed to the improvements in \nquality and access to services for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. Training \nand  awareness  materials  produced  under  the  TA  will  continue  to  be  used  under  the \nsupplementary financing.  \n \nC.  Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples Safeguards \n65.  Social aspects remain unchanged from the original loan. The land to be acquired for the \nproject and temporary use of land for construction will not involve any removal of structures or \naffect private landowners. The land is state owned, and is waste land. The project will not affect \nany ethnic minority groups. The project remains category C for involuntary resettlement and for \nindigenous peoples safeguard aspects. \n \nD.  Environmental Impact \n66.  The original loan is classified as environmental category B. The environmental impact \nassessment (EIA) was undertaken through broad-based public consultations, and the summary \nEIA was circulated to the Board and made public on the ADB website on 5 March 2004. The \nEIA was approved by the Ministry of Nature and Environment on 12 May 2004 and concluded \nthat the project will have no major adverse impacts on the environment. As there has been no \nchange in scope or design, the approved EIA is still applicable. There will be no additional \nenvironmental  impacts  apart  from  those  identified  in  the  approved  EIA.  During  project \nimplementation, the government will continue to implement the mitigating measures stipulated in \nthe EIA.  \nE.  Risks and Assumptions \n67.  The following risks have been considered in formulating the supplementary assistance: \ncost overrun, implementation delay, and noncompletion of the 176 km road section which will be \nfinanced by the MCC. \n68.  To mitigate the risk of cost overrun, the revised project cost is based on the work items \nand  quantities  included  in  the  detailed  engineering  design,  the  cost  estimates  have  been \nupdated to 2009 price levels, and relatively high-cost escalation factors have been used in \nestimating price contingencies as published by ADB for 2009\u20132013 (9.5% for local currency \ncosts and 1.9% for foreign currency costs). To mitigate risks of procurement-related delays, \nprocurement of package NP2 using ICB will follow the single-stage two-envelope procurement \nprocedure, with advance procurement action and retroactive financing to expedite early contract \naward and commencement. To mitigate the risk of delays in issuing work permits and customs \nclearance of construction equipment, the government has given an assurance that it will ensure \n ", "16    \n \ntimely issuance of these permits and prompt clearance of the necessary equipment. To mitigate \nthe risk of noncompletion of the 176 km road section, ADB will coordinate closely with the MCC \nto monitor timely implementation.  \n69.  The design and monitoring framework has been revised with assumptions that political \nstability and economic growth are maintained in the region, and that a transit traffic framework \nagreement among the PRC, Mongolia, and the Russian Federation is in place by 2012. It was \nalso assumed that the MCC will secure a qualified contractor to complete the 176 km road \nsection by 2012. \nV.  ASSURANCES \n70.  In addition to the assurances set forth in the loan agreement dated 1 May 2004, with \nwhich it will continue to comply, the Government of Mongolia has given the following additional \nassurances, which were incorporated in the legal document:  \n(i)  The government will ensure that the one hundred seventy six (176) km road \nsection from Choyr to 35th railway crossing will be completed by 30 June 2013. \nThe government will further ensure that the technical standards of the railway \ncrossing  in  terms  of  width,  pavement  structure,  safety  and  environment \nmeasures will be in accordance to (a) the measures set out in the feasibility study \nand road safety audit; and (b) international practices, including those of the \nFederation Internationale des Ingenieurs-Conseils (FIDIC), notably with respect \nto the use of an external supervision consultant.  \n(ii)  The  government  will  deploy  its  best  efforts  during  contract  bidding  and \nimplementation to ensure that the project can be completed by 30 June 2013, \nincluding  undertaking  timely  bid  evaluation,  prompt  signing  of  contracts  and \nissuance of the notice to proceed, and timely settlement of contractors' claims. \n(iii)  The government will further ensure that (a) the contractors will receive their work \npermits within twenty (20) working days from the date of application, and (b) the \nconstruction equipment will be cleared from customs within twenty (20) working \ndays from the date of application. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n71.  I am satisfied that the proposed supplementary loan and grant would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the \nPresident,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I \nrecommend that the Board approve  \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR5,199,000 to Mongolia for the \nRegional Road Development Project from ADB's Special Funds resources with \nan interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft financing agreement presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the grant not exceeding $16,000,000 to Mongolia, from ADB's Special Funds \nresources, for the Regional Road Development Project, on terms and conditions \nthat are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft financing \nagreement presented to the Board.      \nC.

The 428 kilometer (km) project road from Choyr to the People's Republic of China (PRC) \nborder  near  Zamyn-Uud  has  experienced  substantial  cost  overrun  since  the  project  was \noriginally approved. The estimated civil works cost has risen from $132,757 per kilometer in \n2004 to $285,140 per kilometer in 2009, an increase of 115%. The cost increase is mainly \nattributable  to  a  combination  of  two  factors:  cost  underestimation  in  the  2004  report  and \nrecommendation of the President1 (RRP), and implementation delay combined with inflation.   \n \n2.  Cost underestimation. The 2004 RRP indicated that, based on the findings of the \nproject preparatory technical assistance (TA), the civil works base cost for the project road \nincluding taxes was $56.82 million.

However,  the  cost  of  construction  facilities  and  vehicles  should  also  be \nincluded  as  part  of  the  civil  works  cost  because  these  are  normally  provided  through \ncontractors.

The final report stated that the project road was entirely a new one and that detailed \nengineering should be carried out before embarking on implementation. The cost estimates \nprovided in the TA final report were based on work item identification and quantification using \nfield observation data supplemented by detailed surveys and investigations on a sample basis, \npreliminary designs, and experience-based data for similar projects. The unit costs for the work \nitems were based on the cost data available from two internationally financed road projects \ncombined with the project-related information and judgment.  \n \n5.  The  RRP  provided  for  detailed  design  to  be  carried  out  as  part  of  the  project \nimplementation and was to be financed by the government. This was completed in July 2005. \nThe revised cost estimates were significantly higher than those in the RRP ($27.14 million). \nComparisons of the cost estimates in the final report and detailed design, unit costs, and \nquantities for the Choyr to Zamyn-Uud road are in Tables A2.2, A2.3, and A2.4.

Table A2.3 indicates that in overall terms the TA final report underestimated the unit \ncosts. The main problem, however, was the underestimation of work items and quantities. The \nbill of quantities in the detailed design completed by the government in July 2005 provided \nsignificantly more work items and quantities than the final report, particularly with respect to \nearthworks,  subbase  and  base,  and  drainage  and  bridge  protection.  The  government  has \nconfirmed that there was no change in the design parameters between project preparatory TA \nand the detailed design stages, so the underestimation of work items and quantities was due to \nthe absence of detailed engineering information at the project preparatory TA stage.   \n ", "22  Appendix 2 \n \nTable A2.3: Unit Cost Comparison \n  TA Final  Detailed   Actual Contracts  \nUnit  Report  Design  B1  NP1 \nItem  ($)  ($)  ($)  ($) \nper ha \n1.

As a result of the detailed design, in 2005 the government and the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) were made aware that the estimated cost of the project was about $27 million more \nthan the RRP cost estimates, and that all of the project road sections faced costs higher than \noriginally expected. This was confirmed by the contract price of package A and the lowest \nevaluated responsive bid prices for packages B1 and B2 in October 2006: \n \n(i)  Package  A.  The  $31  million  contract  exceeded  financing  by  the  Economic \nDevelopment Cooperation Fund of the Republic of Korea of $23.9 million based \non  the  RRP  estimate.  This  required  the  government  to  provide  additional \nfinancing of $7.1 million. \n ", "    Appendix 2  23 \n(ii)  Packages B1 and B2. The combined lowest evaluated responsive bid prices of \nthe two packages of $57.41 million exceeded the RRP estimate of $26.82 million, \nand would require additional funding.  \n \n8.  Inflation and implementation delay. The second cause of cost increases was the high \ninflation experienced during project implementation. This led to dramatic increases in the cost of \nroad construction and was reflected in higher contract prices and claims for price adjustment. \nThis was exacerbated by implementation delays, which led to bidding and award of contract \nbeing  significantly  later  than  the  original  project  schedule  and  the  contract  implementation \nperiod being exceeded.  \n   \n9.  Inflation based on Mongolia's consumer price index was 9.6% in 2005, 5.9% in 2006, \n14.1% in 2007, and 23.2% in 2008.4 As a result, the prices of road construction materials soared. \nTable A2.5 shows the price comparison between 2006 and 2008 made by the government using \nthe bid prices in 2006 and actual purchase prices for package B1. The prices of many key \nmaterials rose by a factor of 2\u20133.  \n \nTable A2.5: Unit Price Increase for Major Road Construction Materials \nUnit Rate in  Unit Rate in  Price Increase \nMaterials  Unit  2006 ($)  2008 ($)  (%) \nCement M425  ton  30.00  60.00  100 \nCement 525  ton  30.00  100.00  233 \nBitumen  ton  300.00  650.00  117 \nDiesel  liter  0.54  1.37  154 \nPetrol  liter  0.42  1.23  193 \nSource: Government of Mongolia. \n \n10.  For  most  of  the  contract  packages,  the  government  required  longer  than  originally \nscheduled to complete the bidding process and award contracts. Of the contract packages \nunder ADB, three packages (B1, NP1, and AR2) were awarded on an average of 22 months \nlater  than  expected  in  the  RRP,  two  contracts  (NP2,  AR1)  remain  to  be  awarded  (about \n60 months behind schedule), and one contract (A) is likely to be terminated followed by new \nbidding and contract award. Details of delays in contract awards are provided in Table A2.6. \n \n11.  After contracts were awarded, most of the contractors faced obstacles that delayed \ncontract implementation. Among these were delays in issuing work permits, delays in customs \nclearance of construction equipment, late payment, and delays due to changes in engineering \ndesign. Since the construction season in Mongolia is short due to the long and severe winter, \nsuch delays had a particularly adverse effect on implementation progress.  \n \n12.  The combined effect of these delays is that the projected completion date of the project \nroad is 3.5 years later than originally scheduled. Most of the contract awards were therefore \nsubjected  to  the  effects  of  the  recent  very  high  inflation.  Due  to  delays  in  contract \nimplementation outside of the control of the contractors, three of the contractors (for packages \nB1, NP1, and AR2) submitted claims for price escalation. Following review by the supervision \nconsultant, the government has accepted that price escalation should be paid in cases where it \nwas not possible for the contractor to complete the work within the contract period and in \nrespect of construction materials purchased after the original contract period. The estimated \ncost of contract variations for such price escalation is $3.95 million.  \n \n                                                 \n4  World Bank. 2009. Mongolia Monthly Economic Update. Washington, DC. \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \n \n13.  Conclusion. Taken together, the cost underestimation in the RRP and the combination \nof implementation delays and inflation have raised the estimated cost of the civil works to \n$115.46 million in 2009 prices. This represents a 114% increase from the original cost estimate \nof $53.97 million for civil works and an 82% increase from the original total project cost estimate \nof $78.14 million.  \n \nTable A2.6: Delays to Contract Packages Financed by ADB and the Republic of Korea \n  External Financier  Contract Award Date  Completion Date   \nFrom  Actual/  Actual/ \nContract  in RRP  2007  in RRP  Projected  in Contract Projected  Notes on Delays \nA  Rep of  Rep of  Not in  4 Apr 2007 Oct 2008  Jun 2013  Contractor withdrew in August \nKorea   Koreaa  implementation  2008 after completing 8% of \n  schedule  work.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  economic  analysis  is  carried  out  by comparing  with-project  and  without-project \nscenarios  using  the  same  methodology  and  assumptions  as  in  the  2004  report  and \nrecommendation of the President (RRP).1 It covers 20 years from 2006 to 2025. All benefits and \ncosts are in US dollars and in constant 2003 prices.  \n \nB.  Traffic Forecast \n \n2.  The original traffic forecast prepared in 2003 for the 2006\u20132025 period followed a three-\nstage process:  \n \n(i)  Initial traffic forecasts were based on an analysis of macro-level demographic \ntrends for Mongolia, as well as for the corridor between Choyr and the People's \nRepublic of China (PRC) border in Zamyn-Uud. \n \n(ii)  Macro-level  forecasts  for  freight  and  passenger  traffic  between  Choyr  and \nZamyn-Uud  were  disaggregated  into  road  and  rail  transport,  based  on  data \ngathered from interviews, traffic surveys,2 and published reports and statistics on \nrecent and anticipated modal shares. \n \n(iii)  Based on survey data and actual traffic patterns along the project road, road \ntraffic projections were further disaggregated into three types of traffic: (a) normal \ntraffic, (b) generated traffic (traffic that develops due to reduced transport costs or \nincreased business activities in the project area), and (c) diverted traffic (diverted \nfrom the existing railway to the project road). \n \n3.  The original forecast projected Mongolia's annual gross domestic product at 4.5% and \npopulation growth at 0.95% over the life of the project. Traffic on the corridor between Choyr \nand Zamyn-Uud was forecast to grow by 6.3% per annum for freight and 5.1% per annum for \npassengers. Traffic on this corridor has the options of road and rail. Based on existing modal \nshares and an analysis of traffic patterns derived from surveys, and taking into account factors \nsuch as commodity type, distance, and transport cost, traffic on the corridor was assigned \nbetween road and rail modes. The railway was expected to remain dominant, but the share of \nroads was projected to increase from 3.7% to 23.8% for freight, and from 0.4% to 5.8% for \npassengers. Without the project, road traffic would continue to move along existing unimproved \nearth tracks, and would remain low. With the project, traffic was projected to grow quickly, as \nthe road would capture most internal passenger traffic along the corridor and a growing share of \ntime-sensitive, high-value commodities (such as palletized freight). This would free capacity on \nthe  congested  rail  line.  Regional  traffic  (transit  traffic  between  the  PRC  and  the  Russian \nFederation, and export and import traffic between Mongolia and the PRC) was projected to \nconstitute a large and growing share of the traffic, rising from 30% in 2006 to 75% in 2025. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Manila (Loan 2087-MON, approved on \n22 July). \n2  The surveys included (i) traffic counts and origin\u2013destination surveys conducted in August 2003 along the project \nroad alignment, (ii) vehicle axle load survey conducted in September 2003, (iii) border survey conducted in August \n2003 in Zamyn-Uud, and (iv) survey of road-based business establishments conducted in September 2003 along \nthe Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darhan road. \n ", "30  Appendix 7 \n4.  The  original  traffic  forecast  as  stated  has  been  updated  on  the  basis  of  current \nmacroeconomic data including changes in fuel prices and updated information on actual and \nforecast economic growth using the latest annual traffic counts for the corridor (2006).3 The \ntraffic elasticity to economic growth was left unchanged at 1.2 for passenger traffic and 1.4 for \nfreight traffic. Delayed road opening will defer the commencement of traffic benefit by 4 years, \nfrom 2009 to 2013.

Capital costs. The financial capital costs were converted into economic costs using a \ncomposite  conversion  factor  of  1.01  (Table  A7.2).4 Costs  were  divided  into  tradable  and \nnontradable components. A shadow wage factor of 0.7 was used to estimate the economic price \nof unskilled workers, considering that, if unemployed people are hired under the project, their \neconomic opportunity cost would be low. The analysis is based on a shadow exchange rate \nfactor of 1.019 (Table A7.3). The opportunity cost of land was assumed to be zero since the \nland along the alignment is of low quality and does not have an alternative productive use. \n                                                 \n3  Observed average traffic on the road was 119 vehicles per day on the Choyr\u2013Saynshand section and 152 vehicles \nper day on the Saynshand\u2013Zamyn-Uud section in 2006.

Capital  costs  were  based  on  observed  2005\u20132009  nominal  costs  and  projections. \nVehicle operating costs and maintenance costs were based on 2009 prices. All costs were \nconverted to a constant 2003 price base for the purpose of the economic analysis, to ensure \ncomparability  with  former  evaluations  of  project  costs  and  benefits.  This  was  done  using \ncombinations  of  consumer  price  index  deflators  for  local  and  foreign  costs.  The  updated \neconomic capital costs5 of the project were estimated at $95.75 million in constant 2003 prices, \n47% above the initial economic cost estimates (Table A7.4). The real cost increase is below the \nnominal project cost increase, as a significant part of the cost overrun is due to inflation. \n  \nTable A7.4: Revised Economic Capital Costs \n($ million) \nItem  RRP Estimates  Revised Estimates \nFinancial Cost  78.14  141.90 \nInterests during construction  (1.80)  (2.19) \nPrice contingencies  (4.90)  (1.93) \nTaxes and duties  (6.76)  (11.51) \nComposite conversion factor  0.50  0.98 \nConversion to 2003 prices    (31.50) \nEconomic Cost  65.18  95.75 \n  ( ) = negative, RRP = report and recommendation of the President. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n5  Economic costs do not include taxes and price contingencies but reflect the real increase in input prices.  \n ", "32  Appendix 7 \n7.  Economic benefits. Economic benefits consist of savings in transport costs and travel \ntime for freight and passenger traffic, which are valued in terms of (i) vehicle operating cost \nsavings for normal traffic, (ii) difference in cost and travel time of using the railway and the \nproject road for diverted traffic, and (iii) 50% of vehicle operating cost savings from normal traffic \nas proxy for the willingness to pay for generated traffic. Traffic safety benefits were incorporated \nin the economic analysis update but amount to only 0.08% of benefits. The time savings \nanalysis was based on a value of time savings equivalent to the average Mongolian hourly \nsalary  (about  $1 per  hour)  for  car  passengers,  and  half  that  ($0.50  per  hour)  for  bus \npassengers. Only time savings for drivers and crew were considered for freight traffic. Overall, \nthe project is expected to reduce road trip costs on the corridor by 41%\u201356% depending on \nvehicle category (Table A7.5).  \n \nTable A7.5: Road User Costs and Savings \nEconomic  Financial Unit Trip Costs ($ per vehicle trip)a  \nRUC  Without Project    With Project \nSavings \nVehicle Category  (%)  VOC  Time  Total  VOC  Time   Total \nCar - medium   (47)  91.42 38.20  129.61  53.71  13.17  66.88 \nGoods vehicle  (41)  112.13 6.44  118.57  66.08  2.28  68.36 \nBus - light  (48)  113.56 65.96  179.52  66.08  24.30  90.38 \nBus - medium  (54)  161.01 132.05  293.06  80.92  49.68  130.60 \nBus - heavy  (56)  226.07 276.34  502.41  111.18  101.55  212.73 \nTruck - light  (49)  162.76 0.00  162.76  80.48  0.00  80.48 \nTruck - medium  (47)  241.24 0.00  241.24  124.97  0.00  124.97 \nTruck - heavy  (47)  366.71 0.00  366.71  190.38  0.00  190.38 \nTruck - articulated  (47)  551.04 0.00  551.04  285.36  0.00  285.36 \n( ) = negative, RUC = road user cost, time = value of time savings, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \na 2003 prices. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n8.  Cost\u2013benefit analysis. Using a 12% discount rate, the economic benefits of the project \nremain substantial. The reevaluated net present value of the project is $21.3 million, and the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 16.2% (Table A7.6). The revised EIRR of the project \nis below the former estimates due to the combined effects of the higher capital costs, lower \ntraffic forecasts, and road opening delays.  \n ", "  Appendix 7  33 \n \nTable A7.6: Cost\u2013Benefit Analysis  \n($ million) \nTransport  Time and \nMaintenance  Cost  Safety \nYear  Capital Cost  Cost  Savings  Savings  Net Benefit \n2006  0.61            (0.61) \n2007  8.85            (8.85) \n2008  12.01           (12.01) \n2009  12.11           (12.12) \n2010  11.31           (11.32) \n2011  27.18           (27.18) \n2012  21.65           (21.65) \n2013    0.57  17.89  2.52        19.85  \n2014    0.57  19.81  2.73        21.97  \n2015    0.61  20.94  2.88        23.21  \n2016    7.15  22.12  3.03        18.00  \n2017    0.74  23.60  3.21        26.08  \n2018    0.65  24.91  3.38        27.64  \n2019    0.68  26.28  3.56        29.16  \n2020    0.68  27.73  3.75        30.80  \n2021    21.57  29.03  3.93        11.39  \n2022    1.10  30.34  4.13        33.37  \n2023    0.76  31.76  4.33        35.33  \n2024    0.76  33.25  4.54        37.03  \n2025    0.79  34.83  4.77        38.81  \n      Net present value at 12% discount rate  21.28 \n      EIRR        16.21% \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n9.  Sensitivity analysis. A sensitivity analysis is undertaken to test the effects of negative \nchanges on key parameters that determine the benefits and costs of the project on economic \nviability. The result (Table A7.7) indicates that the EIRR of the project exceeds or is close to the \ncutoff level of 12%, even if these are under significant increases in costs or reductions in user \nbenefits. The EIRR may fall just below 12% in the case of a 15% increase in total project cost \ncombined with a 15% decrease in benefits. An additional cost overrun of 35% of total project \ncost could compromise project viability. To reach this threshold, the cost of the works that have \nnot yet been completed would have to rise 54% above the 2009 estimates. \n \nTable A7.7: Sensitivity Analysis  \nNet Present \nValue  EIRR  Switching \nItem  ($ million)  (%)  Value (%)a \nBase case  21.28  16.21   \nCapital cost increase by 15%  12.20  14.20  35 \nMaintenance cost increase by 15%  20.10  16.00  264 \nOverall cost increase by 15% (A)  11.00  14.00   \nUser benefits decrease by 15% (B)  11.00  14.00  (23) \nCombined (A) and (B)  (2.40)  11.50   \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \na  Factors applied to the best estimate for each cost or benefit item to reduce EIRR to a 12% threshold. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20100308091439+08'00'", "Author": "ds4", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20100309152611+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - RRP MON for Approved for Circulation to Board 5 Mar.doc"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 March 2010) \n \nCurrency Unit    \u2013  togrog (MNT) \nMNT1.00  =  $0.0006900 \n$1.00  =  MNT1,449.25 \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  ADF  \u2013  Asian Development Fund \n  EDCF Korea  \u2013  Economic Development Cooperation Fund of the Republic of Korea \n  EIA  \u2013  environmental impact assessment \n  EIRR  \u2013  economic internal rate of return \n  GDP  \u2013  gross domestic product \n  ICB  \u2013  international competitive bidding  \n  IMF  \u2013  International Monetary Fund \n  km  \u2013  kilometer \n  km2  \u2013  square kilometer \n  m  \u2013  meter \n  MCC  \u2013  Millennium Challenge Corporation \n  PRC  \u2013  People\u2019s Republic of China \n  RRP  \u2013  report and recommendation of the President \n  SDR  \u2013  special drawing rights \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \n \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \nVice-President  C.
