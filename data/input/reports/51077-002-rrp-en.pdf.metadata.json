Physical  and \nnonphysical investments are designed to curb climate change and disaster impacts while creating \na cleaner environment in Maldives, one of the world\u2019s lowest-lying nations.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe Greater  Mal\u00e9  capital  region  and  its  outer  islands  suffer from  severe environmental \npollution and deteriorating livability because of the inadequate collection and haphazard disposal \nof solid waste. The project area encompasses the 35 inhabited islands of the Alifu Alifu Atolli, Alifu \nDhaalu Atoll, Kaafu Atoll, and Vaavu Atoll, including the capital city of Mal\u00e9, with a total population \nof  216,000  (51%  of  Maldives).  Open  dumping  and  burning  of  garbage  at  the  30-year-old,  10-\nhectare  dumpsite  on  Thilafushi  Island  (6  kilometers  from  Mal\u00e9)  creates  an  environmental  and \npublic  health  hazard.  Plumes  of  smoke  visible  from  Mal\u00e9,  the  international  airport,  and \nsurrounding resorts compromise air quality and pose a daily nuisance to residents and tourists, \nwhile  toxic  leachate  contaminates  soil  and  groundwater.  Greater  Mal\u00e9  and  its  inhabited  outer \nislands lack an organized and sustainable waste management system for the 774 tons per day \n(tpd) of mixed solid waste they generate.3 Because of rapid urbanization and tourism development \nin the region, waste generation is expected to grow to 924 tpd by 2022 (footnote 3). The increasing \npressure on an already stressed waste management system poses a significant threat to tourism \nand  fisheries,  both  of  which  rely  heavily  on  the  country\u2019s  pristine  environment  and  are \ncornerstones  to  Maldives\u2019  economy.4  Poor  communities  on  the  outer  islands  suffer  from \naccumulated  garbage  as  they  have  limited  awareness  and  capacity  to  manage  solid  waste \neffectively.  \n \nExisting waste collection, transfer, and disposal system. High population density and \n4. \nnarrow streets present unique challenges for waste collection in Mal\u00e9. Created in 2015, Waste \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Maldives, 2018\u20132020. Manila.  \n2  ADB. 2017.

Tourism  accounts  for  30%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct  and  is  expected  to  expand  in  the  project  area.

Mal\u00e9. \n\n \n\n\fManagement Corporation Limited (WAMCO) is the state-owned operator charged with collecting \nand transporting waste, as well as managing the regional waste management facilities throughout \nthe  country.  Waste  collection  in  the  outer  islands  is  the  responsibility  of  island  councils  not \nWAMCO. WAMCO has limited professional experience in modern and efficient waste collection \nsystems, and this lack of technical and managerial skills undermines their performance (footnote \n3). While WAMCO is trying to improve collection, the company receives nearly 150 complaints \nper day (as of September 2017) for non-collection of waste. Its collection equipment includes a \nfleet of aging vehicles unable to access narrow streets. WAMCO does not have uniform refuse \nbins  or  formal  transfer  stations.  Waste  is  transported  to  Thilafushi  Island  in  open,  non-\ncontainerized vessels, resulting in significant spillage into the ocean.5 Since 2008, fires have been \ndeliberately set at the dumpsite to reduce growing mounds. The equipment and logistics at the \nsite are inadequate to manage incoming waste efficiently and maximize the use of limited space. \nConstruction  and  demolition  waste  and  end-of-life  vehicles  (ELVs)  are  not  collected  and \nprocessed  separately.  Household  surveys  in  the  project  area  show  high  demand  for  3R \nawareness and education programs. About half of household respondents to a socioeconomic \nsurvey,  conducted  as  part  of  the  project  preparatory  TA,  highlighted  the  need  for  more  3R \nawareness and the importance of education. \n \n5. \nClimate change and disaster risks. At 1.5 meters above mean sea level, Maldives is \nvulnerable  to  sea  level  rise.  Natural  hazards  such  as  extreme  rainfall  and  severe  storms  are \nprojected to increase because of climate change, posing a risk to infrastructure and operations. \nThe Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004 dispersed about 290,000 cubic meters of waste \nfrom  open  dumpsites  on  land,  including  municipal  and  hazardous  waste  such  as  asbestos, \nmedical  waste,  and  oil.6  Therefore,  the  project  design  needs  to  include  measures  to  protect \nsystems from natural hazards and climate change.7 \n \n6. \nPolicy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  for  waste  management.  The \nPresident\u2019s  2013  manifesto  calls  for  improvement  in  waste  management  in  the  Greater  Mal\u00e9 \narea.8  The  National  Solid  Waste  Management  Policy  outlines  the  principles  to  improve \nenvironmental  quality.  A  proposed  solid  waste  management  act  would  set  the  legal  and \ninstitutional framework for the  industry. The  project  is fully  aligned  with  the  national  policy  and \nregulations.  The  Waste  Management  and  Pollution  Control  Department  in  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironment  and  Energy  (MEE)  is  mandated  to  ensure  safe  waste  disposal  on  all  inhabited \nislands.  The  MEE  works  closely  with  development  partners  to  develop  its  regional  waste \nmanagement systems,9  and  selected  the  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB)  to  cover  the  project \narea because of the bank\u2019s industry experience and the project\u2019s link to ADB\u2019s TA for formulating \na development strategy for Greater Mal\u00e9.10 \n \n\n                                                \n5  Government of Maldives, Ministry of Environment and Energy. 2016.

As part of its national strategy to achieve efficient \n7. \npublic  spending  on  economic  and  social  services,  the  government  aims  for  70%  of  its  total \npopulation to live in Greater Mal\u00e9.11 The plan seeks to create spatial agglomeration and economic \nopportunities for faster growth and poverty reduction. Most of the population increase is expected \nto be absorbed in the newly developed island of Hulhumal\u00e9. Waste management systems are not \ncurrently equipped to handle this projected growth. \n \n8. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  The  following  lessons  and  value  additions  were \nincorporated in the project design:12 (i) use a phased approach to match implementation capacity \n\u2014a follow-on ADB project to develop a waste-to-energy plant as a long-term treatment solution \nconsistent with the comprehensive waste management strategy13 for the project area is planned \nfor approval in 2019 or 2020;14 (ii) develop high project readiness; (iii) include technical capacity \nbuilding  for  procurement,  contract  management,  safeguards,  and  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M); (iv) ensure strong community consultation and capacity building targeting women;15 and \n(v) incorporate disaster risk reduction and climate change-resilient measures in project designs.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: a healthy living environment created in \nthe  Greater  Mal\u00e9  capital  region  and  its  outer  islands  (footnote  8).  The  project  will  have  the \nfollowing outcome: climate- and disaster-resilient SWM services improved.16 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project will have three outputs. \n\n10. \n \n11. \nOutput  1:  Waste  collection,  transfer,  and  disposal  systems  improved  and  made \nclimate and disaster resilient. This output will include (i) an efficient waste collection strategy \ndesigned and applied in Mal\u00e9 and Hulhumal\u00e9, in consultation with local communities, targeting \nwomen;  (ii)  waste  collection  and  transport  equipment,  such  as  trucks,  bins,  and  containers, \nprovided  for  Mal\u00e9,  Hulhumal\u00e9,  and  Villimal\u00e9;  (iii)  transfer  stations  in  Mal\u00e9  and  Villimal\u00e9 \nconstructed,  and  transfer  station  in  Hulhumal\u00e9  designed  as  land  is  not  yet  confirmed; \n(iv) construction  and  demolition  waste  processing  plant  and  ELV  dismantling  workshop \nconstructed;  (v)  waste  vessel  harbor  at  Thilafushi  rehabilitated;  (vi)  three  vessels  for  waste \ntransport from the outer islands to Thilafushi provided; (vii) heavy equipment, such as bulldozers, \nexcavators,  and  roll  trucks,  provided  for  controlled  dumpsite  management  at  Thilafushi;  and \n(viii) two administrative buildings for WAMCO at the Mal\u00e9 transfer station and the Thilafushi waste \nvessel  harbor  constructed.  All  facilities  will  adopt  climate-change  and  disaster-resilient  design \nfeatures  including  enhanced  engineering  designs  such  as  strengthened  seawalls,  raised  floor \nelevations,  and  enhanced  drainage  systems;  and  soft  interventions,  such  as  disaster  and \nemergency planning and awareness building.  \n                                                \n11 The government did not specify a period for achieving this target but estimated it would take 15\u201320 years.  \n12 Independent Evaluation Department. 2011.

This  output  will  provide  comprehensive  support  to  strengthen \nsustainable SWM in the 32 poor outer island communities of the project area. It will include (i) at \nleast 22 island waste management centers (IWMCs), of which 11 will be supported by JFPR grant, \ndeveloped  or  upgraded  with  processing  equipment  (balers,  glass  crushers,  metal  presses)  in \nconsultation  with  the  community,  targeting  women  and  incorporating  climate  and  disaster-risk \nmeasures;17  (ii)  collection  equipment  for  the  32  outer  islands  (bins,  refuse  collection  vehicles, \ndump trucks) provided; (iii) capacity building of eligible island councils targeting women in waste \ncollection,  segregation,  composting,  recycling,  and  O&M  undertaken;  and  (iv)  community \nawareness and behavior change campaigns in 3R targeting women in all outer islands delivered. \nAs subprojects under output 2 will be prepared after Board approval, each island is required to \nmeet  minimum  eligibility  and  selection  criteria,  including  safeguards,  to  receive  IWMC  support \nunder  the  project.  The  criteria,  which  are  intended  to  ensure  sustainability,  are  outlined  in  the \nproject  administration  manual  (PAM).18  Subprojects  with  resettlement  impacts  will  not  be \nincluded.  Output 2 will be partially funded by a JFPR grant, which will support (i) the construction \nof IWMCs on at least 11 eligible islands, (ii) the provision of skills and capacity building to women \non eligible islands, and (iii) the delivery of 3R awareness campaigns on all the 32 outer islands. \nThe PAM outlines additional selection criteria for JFPR supported islands. \n \n13. \nOutput  3:  Institutional  capacity  and  public  awareness  in  sustainable  waste \nmanagement strengthened. This will include (i) capacity building support in sustainable SWM \nservice delivery and disaster risk management provided to eligible WAMCO staff (at least 70% \neligible  women  staff);  (ii)  public  awareness  and  behavior  change  campaigns  in  3R  delivered, \ntargeting  the  poor  and  women  in  Greater  Mal\u00e9;  and  (iii)  project  management,  design,  and \nsupervision consultant support provided. Capacity building activities in disaster risk management \nwill include the preparation of an SWM disaster action plan outlining prevention, preparedness, \nresponse,  and  recovery  tasks.  Disaster  risk  management  awareness  activities  will  involve  first \nresponders,  such  as  police  and  firefighters,  in  Thilafushi.  A  public  awareness  and  community \ncapacity building consultant recruited by the PMU will implement public awareness and behavior \nchange activities in outer islands (under outputs 2) and Greater Mal\u00e9 (under output 3). \n \nD. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $40  million  (Table  1).

The project \nsteering  committee  will  provide  overall  policy  and  strategic  guidance  to  the  project.  A  project \ntechnical  committee  will  coordinate  design  and  implementation  issues.  The  PMU  will  recruit \n(i) consulting firms to support project management, engineering, supervision, capacity building, \nand  community  awareness;  and  (ii)  an  individual  expert  to  support  disaster  risk  management \nactivities. The PAM has an outline of the terms of reference for consultants (footnote 18). The \nimplementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in  detail  in  the  PAM \n(footnote 18). \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  \nEstimated grant closing date \n\nJune 2018\u2013June 2023 \n30 June 2023 \n31 December 2023 \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nAspects \nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Implementing agency \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n \nConsulting services \n \n \nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nArrangements \n\nProgram Steering Committee \nChair: Ministry of Environment and Energy (MEE) minister \nMembers: Waste Management Company Limited (WAMCO), Ministry of Finance and \nTreasury (MOFT), Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Gender and \nFamily, Local Government Authority, Environmental Protection Agency  \n \nTechnical Committee \nChair: MEE project director \nMembers: MEE, Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Gender and \nFamily, Local Government Authority, Ministry of Housing and Infrastructure Mal\u00e9 City \nCouncil, Environmental Protection Agency, WAMCO, Thilafushi Corporation Limited, \nand two representatives from environmental nongovernment organizations \nMOFT \nMEE \nProject  management  unit  at  the  MEE\u2019s  Waste  Management  and  Pollution  Control \nDepartment (eight staff) \nInternational competitive bidding \nNational competitive bidding \nQuality- and cost-based selection 90:10 \nQuality-based selection \nIndividual consultant selection \nAdvance contracting is requested for civil works, equipment, and consultant \npackages.

The government will provide counterpart support in \nthe form of staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n20. \nTechnical due diligence confirmed the designs are robust and sustainable. It included a \ncomprehensive review of the project feasibility study, engineering designs, cost estimates, and \nsite  investigations. Technical  aspects  of the  project  were  appraised  based  on  (i)  rationale  and \n\n                                                \n19 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\frelevance,  benefits,  proposed  designs,  ease  of  implementation,  and  operations;  (ii)  technical \nalternatives  and  their  viability  along  with  least-cost  analysis  -  MEE  evaluated  a  range  of \nalternatives, including various collection concepts and technologies (e.g., vehicle and bin types, \ncontainer designs, and treatment and disposal approaches) to ensure continuity and feasibility \nacross the system; (iii) life cycle costs, including capital and operating costs; and achievable cost \nsavings, including climate- and disaster-resilient measures (footnote 7); (iv) maximum beneficiary \narea coverage, including the poor; (v) minimum adverse environmental and social impacts; and \n(vi) optimized time lines for implementation through high project readiness. The project design \nadequately addresses the key waste management issues facing the project area. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic analysis. The economic rationale for government intervention is sound as the \n21. \nproject aims to provide sustainable SWM services in the Greater Mal\u00e9 capital region and its outer \ninhabited islands. The project\u2019s estimated economic internal rate of return is 17.5%, higher than \nthe  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  estimated  at  9.0%,  indicating  significant  economic \nreturns. The sensitivity analysis also revealed satisfactory results, except under the scenario of \nall downside risks occurring together, i.e., (i) a 20% capital cost overrun, (ii) a 20% overrun in \nO&M costs, (iii) a 20% decline in estimated benefits, and (iv) a 1-year delay in implementation.20 \n \nFinancial analysis. The transaction TA (footnote 2) conducted a financial analysis for the \n22. \nproject to determine whether it is sustainable and the extent to which it will generate revenues to \ncover O&M costs. The results showed the project would generate sufficient revenues to cover full \nO&M costs provided WAMCO implements regular tariff revisions. The financial performance of \nWAMCO  shows  it  has  substantially  depended  on  government  grants.  Thus,  the  financial \nprojections of WAMCO and the island councils demonstrate the revenue account will remain in \nsurplus  by  (i)  rationalizing  tariffs,  (ii)  improving  collection  efficiency,  and  (iii)  continuing \ngovernment support. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nFinancial management. The financial management assessment concludes the MEE can \nconduct  adequate  financial  management  of  the  project.  The  MEE  has  experience  in  handling \nlarge  projects  funded  internally  and  externally  (footnote  3).  In  addition,  the  MEE  has  an \nestablished legal, institutional, and monitoring framework available for budgeting, accounting, and \nauditing.  Thus,  the  overall  financial  management  risk  for  the  project  is  moderate.  The  project \ndesign includes the following risk mitigation measures: (i) commitment of the MOFT and the MEE \nto ensure the timely setup of the PMU with qualified staff, and (ii) commitment from the MOFT \nand the MEE for timely allocation and disbursement of the government\u2019s counterpart funds. The \nprogram will provide further support to improve the financial management capacity of the MEE \nand the PMU. \n \n24. \nProcurement.  Procurement  of  civil  works  and  goods  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The recruitment of consultants will follow ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  A  procurement \ncapacity assessment concluded the overall procurement risk for the project is moderate. The MEE \nhas extensive experience in development partner-supported procurement of goods and works. A \nprocurement  expert  recruited  under  the  attached  TA  will  provide  additional  implementation \nsupport for the MEE. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \n\n                                                \n20 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fand  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  MOFT.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote18). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n25. \nOverall  poverty  in  Maldives  is  estimated  at  15%  (2010),  but  poverty  levels  in  Mal\u00e9 \nincreased from 4% in 2003 to 12% in 2010 due to migration of unskilled workers from the outer \natolls.21  The  project  includes  improved  waste  management  for  poor  outer  island  communities, \nincluding skills training and awareness and behaviour change campaigns. The project will result \nin a cleaner environment that will have a positive impact on fishing and tourism-based livelihoods, \nwhich many of the poor depend on. \n \nGender. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The gender benefits of \n26. \nthe project include (i) participation of women in community-based waste management activities \nin  poor  outer  island  communities,  (ii)  capacity  building  on  gender  for  project  stakeholders, \n(iii) promotion of equitable access to project-related jobs, and (iv) equal opportunity employment \nacross  positions  in  WAMCO.  The  MEE  endorsed  a  gender  action  plan  with  clear  targets, \nresponsibilities,  and  resource  allocations  for  the  participation  of  women.22  The  PMU  will \nimplement the gender action plan with support from public awareness and community capacity \nbuilding consultants recruited under the project, and the JFPR grant coordinator. The information, \neducation, and communication specialist in the PMU will serve as the gender focal point to support \ntimely and effective implementation of the gender action plan (footnote 22). \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n27. \ncategories are as follows.23 \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  MEE  prepared  three  draft  initial  environmental \n28. \nexaminations24  with  environmental  management  plans  for  subprojects  requiring  civil  works:  (i) \ntransfer  stations  in  Mal\u00e9  and  Villimal\u00e9;  (ii)  construction  and  demolition  waste  processing  plant, \nELV dismantling workshop, and waste vessel harbor rehabilitation; and (iii) a sample IWMC. All \nproject  locations  are  outside  sensitive  areas  and  impacts  will  be  avoided  or  mitigated  through \nmeasures  identified  in  the  environmental  management  plans.  The  MEE  conducted  public \nconsultations that will continue throughout implementation. The MEE prepared an environmental \nassessment and review framework for output 2, including site selection and design criteria. No \ncategory A projects are allowed.25 The environmental assessment and review framework and the \ninitial environmental examinations were disclosed on the websites of ADB and the MEE and will \nbe available in the local language. The PMU will handle safeguards-related grievances following \nthe  project-specific  grievance  redress  mechanism  for  the  project.  While  the  MEE  developed \nsafeguards  capacity  from  other  development  partner-supported  projects,  the  PMU  will  receive \n\n                                                \n21 Government  of  Maldives,  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury,  Department  of  National  Planning.  2010.
