THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport \nExpansion Project. \n \n2.  The  project  will  improve  facilities  at  Presidente  Nicolau  Lobato  International  Airport \n(PNLIA) in Dili, the main gateway airport to Timor-Leste, with the extension of the airport runway \nto meet international safety standards and construction of a new air traffic control tower (ATCT), \ntaxiways, aprons, and an aeronautical ground lighting system to support the upgraded runway. \nThe project will also enhance the organizational and management capacity of the Ministry of \nTransport  and  Communications  (MOTC),  the  Air  Navigation  Administration  of  Timor-Leste \n(ANATL), and the Civil Aviation Authority of Timor-Leste (AACTL) to ensure the long-term \nsustainability of the airport facility and operation. The project will help to establish better air \nconnectivity within and outside the country by enhancing the efficiency and safety of air transport \nof  passengers  and  goods.  Private  sector  participation  is  envisaged  for  the  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the airport, and the government has already appointed the International \nFinance Corporation (IFC) as its transaction advisor. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context. In 2019, Timor-Leste\u2019s non-oil gross domestic product was \n$1.7 billion while its oil gross domestic product was $2.0 billion. With production from the current \noil fields forecast to end in 2022\u20132023, there is an urgent need for economic diversification. \nDeveloping a sustainable non-oil economy, however, has been a challenge for Timor-Leste. In \n2020, the non-oil economy was (i) estimated to have contracted by 7.9% (the third year of \ncontractions since 2017), and (ii) at its lowest level since 2009, after limited recovery of 1.8% in \n2019.1 The severe economic downturn in 2020 was because of (i) the global economic slowdown; \n(ii) the state-of-emergency measures, including the almost complete lockdown of the country and \nthe closure of PNLIA, as part of various measures to contain the coronavirus disease (COVID-\n19); and (iii) the political uncertainties that led to the rejection of the 2020 budget, which curtailed \ngovernment spending in the first three quarters of the year (footnote 1). Poor quality infrastructure \nis one of the key constraints to private sector development and a broader structural transformation \nof the economy. Well-targeted investments in infrastructure are considered essential to achieve \nsustainable and inclusive growth in the country and to accelerate economic recovery in the post-\nCOVID-19 era. The government has identified tourism, agriculture, and petrochemicals as the \nleading sectors in its strategy for economic growth and diversification.2 Developing tourism \nrequires focused investments aimed at increasing easy access to the country, especially given \nthe stiff competition with established tourist destinations in neighboring countries.3 \n \n4.  Importance of air transport to the economy. The government is seeking accession to \nthe World Trade Organization as well as full membership in the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations and hopes to reap direct benefits through closer trade, investment, and labor market \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB).

The country operations business plan, 2021-2023 extended the \ncountry partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 to cover up to 2022. The country partnership strategy for Timor-Leste, \n2023\u20132027 will be prepared for the approval of the ADB Board of Directors in 2022. \n \n ", "2 \nlinkages. To make the most of these opportunities, the government will require further investments \nin infrastructure and improved connectivity, both international and domestic, which will contribute \nto more efficient movement of goods and people. \n \n5.  Air  transport  sector  in  Timor-Leste.  Timor-Leste  has  four  international  airports \n(including PNLIA) and five domestic airports.4 ANATL operates all airports and AACTL functions \nas the regulator for the air transport sector. Both ANATL and AACTL are under the MOTC. PNLIA \nplays the role of the gateway airport to Timor-Leste and handled 0.17 million passengers in 2019, \nof which 90% were international. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the PNLIA connected to \nonly three countries (Australia, Indonesia, and Singapore), which posed challenges for Timor-\nLeste in establishing strong linkages with a broader market.5 The limited air connectivity is caused \nby, among others, serious concerns with aviation safety in Timor-Leste. On the policy and \nregulatory side, the government introduced laws and regulations to certify aerodromes in the \ncountry only in 2019 with support from the Government of Australia. Such certification is a safety \nrequirement under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.6 \n \n6.  Constraints of the Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport. Even though \nPNLIA is the main airport of Timor-Leste, its substandard airside facilities have been a serious \nchallenge to national aviation safety.7 PNLIA\u2019s runway is 1,850 meters (m) in length and 30 m in \npavement width. From a safety perspective, the runway can accommodate practically only up to \nCode C aircrafts, and with significant restrictions on payload because of the short runway.8 The \nrunway also does not have adequate measures for safe aerodrome operation. For example, ICAO \nstandards specify that runway end safety areas (RESAs) shall be at least 90 m long for safe \naerodrome operation; however, PNLIA\u2019s runway does not have any RESAs. These issues pose \nchallenges to PNLIA\u2019s route development and better air connectivity, because airlines are subject \nto commercial penalties from having to operate with reduced payloads (i.e., fewer passenger \nseats occupied) and extra safety measures. The ATCT is also in poor condition and does not fully \nmeet  the  minimum  response  time  requirement  specified  by  ICAO  standards.9  The  critical \ninvestment requirements to address these deficiencies and meet the challenges to aviation safety \nand economic diversification are best met through public investments because of the long \ngestation investment requirements, with private sector participation scoped out for O&M. \n \n7.  Relevant government policy and program. The Timor-Leste Strategic Development \nPlan, 2011\u20132030 identified reforms to upgrade infrastructure, with an emphasis on achieving rapid \n \n4  The other three international airports are (i) the Baucau airport in the Baucau Municipality in eastern Timor-Leste, (ii) \nthe Suai airport in the Cova Lima Municipality in southern Timor-Leste, and (iii) the Oecusse airport in the East \nTimorese Oecusse Special Administrative Region. \n5  Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, PNLIA has served only one direct route to Darwin, Australia. \n6  AACTL issued decree-law no. 32 for aerodrome certification in December 2019. ANATL applied for an aerodrome \ncertificate for PNLIA in 2019, but the certification procedure has not been finalized yet. \n7  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (Air Transport) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n8  Aircraft codes are based on a combination of the aircraft wingspan and the outer main gear wheel span. According \nto the ICAO Aerodrome Design Manual, Code C aircrafts refer to those with a wingspan of 24\u201336 m and an outer \nmain gear wheel span of 6\u20139 m, such as Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. Code E aircrafts refer to those with a wingspan \nof 52\u201365 m and an outer main gear wheel span of 9\u201314 m. The length of the runway at PNLIA warrants operation of \nCode C aircrafts only with significant payload restrictions. The payload restriction on Code E aircrafts is too \nprohibitive, preventing any such operation. \n9  The ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices recommend that the response time be kept below 4 seconds \nunder all circumstances. Although the location of the ATCT satisfies the requirement for line-of-sight distances for \nthe runway, it has a constrained view of the eastern part of the runway, failing to meet the minimum response time \nstandard. \n \n ", "3 \ngrowth and ensuring that no part of the country is left behind.10 The expansion of PNLIA, as Timor-\nLeste\u2019s gateway to the global economy, is one of the strategic priority projects of the Infrastructure \nFund listed in the budget book of the country, managed by the Council for the Administration of \nthe  Infrastructure  Fund  (CAFI).11  The  expansion  of  PNLIA  aims  to  improve  the  country\u2019s \nconnectivity  and  productivity,  underpinned  by  detailed  plans  and  targets  for  progress  and \nunderscored by the country\u2019s aspiration to become a full member of the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations. The PNLIA is planned to become a modern international airport compliant with \nglobally  accepted  safety  standards  and  with  the  capacity  to  handle  more  than  1  million \npassengers annually by 2050. With support from IFC, the government prepared the PNLIA master \nplan in October 2019.12 The airport development program incorporated in the PNLIA master plan \nwill be implemented in a staged manner, and this project supports the first stage. O&M of the \nairport is expected to engage the private sector, and the government is exploring options, assisted \nby IFC. \n \n8.  The government\u2019s aspiration is also reflected in its policies and civil aviation sector master \nplan:  the  National  Policy  for  Civil  Aviation  (2017)  aims  to  promote  national  tourism  by \nstrengthening air transport infrastructure and services, and the Transport Sector Master Plan \n(2018) recommends safety and services in public air transport to be improved. ADB provided \ntechnical assistance to support the government in exploring options for upgrading PNLIA\u2019s \nrunway.13 \n \n9.  Strategic alignment. As highlighted in Table 1, the project is aligned with the following \noperational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (i) accelerating progress in gender equality; (ii) \ntackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental \nsustainability; (iii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity; and (iv) fostering regional \ncooperation and integration.14  The project also supports ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nTimor-Leste, 2016\u20132020, which aims to promote economic growth and diversification by removing \ninfrastructure bottlenecks and institutional constraints (footnote 3). \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nOperational Priorities  Project Contributions \nAccelerating progress in  Scale  up  support  for  gender  equality.

ADB\u2019s earlier air transport projects and lessons learned. ADB has supported air \ntransport infrastructure development of its developing member countries to boost economic \ngrowth  through  improved  connectivity.  As  an  example,  the  Tribhuvan  International  Airport \nimprovement project in Nepal aimed at safety and capacity improvement, and it showed the \nimportance of sustained institutional capacity building to ensure successful contract management \nand implementation of the project.15 The project addresses these lessons by incorporating \nintegrated institutional arrangements for implementation and providing capacity development \ncomponents. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n11.  The project is aligned with the following impact: economic diversification and national \nproductivity improved by ensuring better connectivity within and outside of the country (footnote \n10). The project will have the following outcome: efficiency and safety of goods\u2019 and people\u2019s \nmovements improved.16 \n \n12.  Output 1: Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport runway, air traffic control \ntower, and other key airport facilities improved. The project will extend the existing 1,850 m \nrunway westward to a 2,100 m runway, including a 166 m seaward extension, which will remove \nthe payload restrictions on Code C aircrafts and ensure that the runway fully complies with the \nminimum RESA length of 90 m required under the ICAO standards for safe airfield operation.17 \nThe project will also construct new taxiways, including a partially parallel taxiway with dimensions \n(such as the length and distance from the runway centerline) to accommodate Code C and Code \nE aircrafts. The aprons will also be reconfigured to complement these airside improvements. In \naddition, the ATCT will be relocated to ensure that (i) its new location fully meets the threshold \nresponse time recommended by the ICAO standards in detecting aircraft movements, and (ii) its \nheight covers the line of sight of aircraft movement areas such as the runway and taxiway. \n \n \n \n \n15 ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n16 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n17 The runway will also be widened from 30 m to 45 m and the runway strip protection from 150 m to 280 m to meet the \nICAO requirements. These improvements will also allow the operation of Code E aircrafts, albeit with payload \nrestrictions. The government\u2019s PNLIA master plan suggests that PNLIA\u2019s runway will be further extended in the \nmedium term for the potential full operation of Code E aircrafts without any payload restrictions. \n \n ", "5 \n13.  Output  2:  Organizational  and  management  capacity  of  the  integrated  project \nmanagement unit and the Ministry of Transport and Communications (Air Navigation \nAdministration of Timor-Leste and Civil Aviation Authority of Timor-Leste) enhanced. The \ngovernment  is  working  on  forming  an  integrated  project  management  unit  (IPMU),  an \ninterministerial body comprising staff from the MOTC (ANATL and AACTL) and Ministry of \nFinance. The IPMU will have a technical working group, which will be responsible for day-to-day \nproject management activities.18 This output will focus on developing the capacity of the IPMU on \nprocurement, contract and project management, financial management and accounting, and \nsafeguards  monitoring.  The  capacity  development  support  is  meant  to  achieve  long-term \nsustainability of the airport beyond the project implementation period, so that capacity can be \nmaintained within the IPMU and relevant ministries. A complementary technical assistance will \nalso be provided to support capacity development of the IPMU member ministries, including \nparticularly  MOTC,  and  agencies  for  the  long-term  retention  of  knowledge  and  skills  in \nsafeguards.  \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n14.  ADB will work with the government and other development partners such as the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA), and IFC to ensure that the new infrastructure for the \nPNLIA is targeted with appropriate scale and leverage, and that services are delivered with \nimproved efficiency, cost recovery, and sustainable O&M. The PNLIA is expected to be developed \nunder a hybrid public\u2013private partnership (PPP) modality, where ADB will finance key airport \nfacilities, except for the new international terminal, which is under consideration to be financed by \nJICA, while the O&M of the project facilities will be managed by the private sector.19 ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement will help the government in leveraging private sector participation in the O&M PPP \ntransaction for the PNLIA and it will closely coordinate with JICA for better interface management \nduring implementation. ADB will help the government in establishing institutional capacity during \nimplementation. \n \nBox: Noteworthy Features of the Project \n \n(i) Enable Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport (PNLIA) to meet the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization design and safety standards, so that more airlines can establish diverse international routes \nto and from Timor-Leste without payload restrictions.  \n \n(ii) Contribute to increasing PNLIA\u2019s capacity to handle potential traffic growth gradually up to 1 million \npassengers by 2050, which will promote tourism and economic diversification, in addition to enhancing \nthe country\u2019s connectivity and closer economic ties with neighboring countries in the Asia and Pacific \nregion and beyond. \n \n(iii) Explore a public\u2013private partnership arrangement for operation and maintenance assisted by the \nInternational Finance Corporation Transaction Advisory Services, with capital expenditure for upgrading \nPNLIA from the government, the Asian Development Bank, and the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency.

The government has requested (i) a regular loan of $85 million, and (ii) a concessional \nloan of $50 million, both from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, to help finance the project. The \nregular loan will have a 26.5-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft regular ordinary capital resources loan agreement.21 Based on the straight-line repayment \nmethod, the average loan maturity is 16 years and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% \nper year. The concessional loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an \ninterest rate of 2.0% per year during the grace period and thereafter; and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft concessional ordinary capital resources loan agreement. \n \n20 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority has indicated that all global market participants should assume \nthat there will be no LIBOR publication after 2021. Therefore, ADB and other global market participants with LIBOR-\nlinked financial products are preparing to shift to alternative reference rates by 31 December 2021. \n \n ", "7 \n17.  The ADB loans will finance the civil works for the extension and expansion of the runway, \napron, taxiway, ATCT, and aeronautical ground lighting system; and capacity development of the \nMOTC (ANATL and AACTL) and IPMU. The government counterpart funds will cover the civil \nworks, land acquisition and resettlement costs, project management consultancy, and recurrent \ncosts. JICA is planning to finance a new airport terminal on a parallel collaborative basis (not \nadministered by ADB) with a grant in the amount of $44 million.

Details are in the \nPAM (footnote 21). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The executing agency will be the CAFI, and the implementing agency will be the MOTC. \nThe Interministerial Commission will provide oversight of the entire PNLIA development program, \nand the IPMU to be established under the Interministerial Commission will assist the National \nProcurement Commission with the preparation of bidding documents for civil works and terms of \nreference for consultants\u2019 services. \n \n20.  The design-and-build approach will be adopted for the project. There will be one package \nprocured through open competitive bidding with prequalification, which is planned to be advertised \nin the third quarter of 2021. For consulting services contracts, there will be one package for a firm \nto be engaged in project management consultancy services, and four individual consultants for \ncapacity building of the MOTC (ANATL and AACTL) and IPMU for (i) a procurement/contract \nmanagement expert, (ii) a financial management expert, (iii) an environmental safeguards expert, \nand (iv) a social safeguards expert. Implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and \ndescribed in detail in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  September 2021\u2013May 2026 \nEstimated completion date  31 May 2026 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 November 2026 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Interministerial Commission \nChair: Minister of Planning and Territory \nMembers: Minister of Finance, Minister of Transport and Communications, \nMinister of Public Works, and Minister of Foreign Affairs \n(ii)  Executing agency  Council for the Administration of the Infrastructure Fund \n(iii) Key implementing  Ministry of Transport and Communications \nagency \n(iv) Implementation unit  Integrated project management unit \n \n ", "8 \nAspects  Arrangements \nProcurement  Open competitive  Design-and-build with one  $115.62 million \nbidding  package for output 1 \nConsulting services  QCBS  494.5 person-months construction  $5.06 million \nsupervision consultancy services \nICS  24 person-months  $0.87 million \nAdvance contracting  Construction supervision consultant and design-and-build package \nDisbursement  Disbursement of the loan proceeds will follow ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = individual consultant selection, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSources: ADB and Government of Timor-Leste. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  The feasibility study confirmed the project\u2019s technical viability.22 PNLIA is locked by the \nBanda Sea to the west and the Comoro River to the east. The design of the runway extension will \nconsider (i) the flood levels of the Comoro River and their impact on the proposed river crossing \nand their potential for flooding the airport compound; and (ii) the regional mean sea level rise, as \nthe runway will be extended to the west into the sea after land reclamation. The project will also \nprovide improved drainage systems to ensure safe operation of the airport during the monsoon \nseason. The O&M of the project asset will likely be undertaken by a private sector partner to be \nselected through a PPP tender to be launched in the fourth quarter of 2021. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n22.  Economic and financial analyses concluded that the project is economically viable and \nfinancially sustainable. Passenger traffic forecasts were prepared from historical passenger traffic \nrecords with relevant socioeconomic parameters. The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return is \n16.0% with a net present value of $113.3 million at a 9% discount rate. The economic analysis \ncompared the benefits and costs of the with- and without-project scenarios. The main benefits \nrelate to (i) international flight ticket price savings, (ii) an increase in value added derived from \nadditional foreign tourist spending, (iii) value added effects to local industries resulting from an \nincrease in air cargo exports, and (iv) an increase in aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenues. \nSensitivity analysis indicated that the project\u2019s economic viability would remain satisfactory even \nunder adverse scenarios. \n \n23.  The project will generate revenue from charged tariffs with increased traffic volumes. \nAlthough the expected revenue will not be sufficient to cover the capital investments, and thus \nboth the financial net present value and financial internal rate of return for the project are negative, \nincremental revenues will meet O&M costs from 2031 onward, provided that the tariff structure is \nrevised by 2026. O&M shortfall in the initial years from 2026 to 2030 will be met by the overall \nrevenues of ANATL, the operating agency. The government is committed to provide any balance \nthrough subsidies to fully meet the O&M expenditures. \n \n \n \n22 Preparation of the project was supported by a transaction technical assistance project. ADB. 2019. Technical \nAssistance for Southeast Asia Transport Project Preparatory Facility Phase 2. Manila. \n \n ", "9 \nC.  Sustainability \n \n24.  ANATL will be responsible for O&M of the assets created under the project through its \noverall revenues and subsidies from the government. The O&M of the airport is planned to be \ntransferred to a private sector partner under the hybrid PPP modality, subject to financial structure \nacceptable to the market (para. 14). The current tariff structure for airport services does not assure \nfull cost recovery. Analysis has confirmed the long-term financial sustainability of the project \nassets, provided that the tariff structure is revised by 2026.  \n \nD.  Governance \n \n25.  Financial management. The pre-mitigation financial management risk is assessed as \nsubstantial mainly because of the complex implementation arrangements. The CAFI and the \nMOTC have agreed to implement an action plan to address the risks identified in financial \nmanagement. The IPMU will be created under the Interministerial Commission and will be \nresponsible for day-to-day management of the project\u2019s financial management arrangements, \nincluding implementation of the project-specific risk-mitigating activities. The project will support \nthe IPMU staff with capacity enhancement in procurement, contract and project management, \nfinancial  management  and  accounting,  and  safeguards  monitoring  to  manage  project \nimplementation and to promote long-term sustainability. \n \n26.  Procurement. The procurement risk is rated high since the MOTC and IPMU have no \nexperience in ADB-financed projects and will depend on international consultants for project \nimplementation. Based on strategic procurement planning, the design-and-build contract will help \ndeliver value for money, as it minimizes interfaces and organizational complexity, allowing for \nmore efficient delivery. The design-and-build contract will also improve project innovation and \nattractiveness for international contractors. A project management consultant and a construction \nsupervision consultant will be recruited to assist the IPMU. All procurement will be undertaken in \naccordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and CAFI. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  As of 2014, 41.8% of Timor-Leste\u2019s population still lived below the national poverty line, \nand limited employment was a major contributor to high poverty levels in the country.23 The project \nwill contribute to creating job opportunities for the local population during construction and O&M, \nwhich will increase their access to income-generating opportunities. Only 27% of women are \nrepresented in the labor force or deemed economically active in Timor-Leste, compared with 56% \nof men. In response, the project has set a target for increasing the female workforce of the \ncontractor, which will contribute to women\u2019s economic empowerment. While the MOTC (ANATL \nand AACTL) has relatively few female employees, especially in decision-making positions, it is \nworking to narrow the gender gap. Gender-based violence \u2013 sexual exploitation, abuse, and \nsexual harassment (GBV-SEAH) is deeply entrenched in all facets of society in Timor-Leste. \n \n23 ADB. 2021. Basic Statistics, Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n \n ", "10 \nAmong  ever-partnered  women  aged  15\u201349  years,  59%  have  experienced  intimate  partner \nphysical and/or sexual violence at least once in their lifetime.24  \n \n29.  The project is categorized as having some gender elements and will promote gender \nequality through the following key actions: (i) provide access to employment by requiring the \ncontractor to hire local labor, with targets for female participation and equal pay for equal work in \nalignment with core labor standards under the national labor law; (ii) ensure the delivery of training \non GBV-SEAH to all contracted employees, in recognition of the high rates of GBV-SEAH in \nTimor-Leste; (iii) provide a grievance redress mechanism through which employees and members \nof  the  surrounding  community  may  report  GBV-SEAH  and  other  concerns  and  infractions \nanonymously;  (iv)  strengthen  the  gender  capacity  of  the  MOTC  (ANATL  and  AACTL)  by \nsupporting the creation of an inclusive human resources development plan; and (v) support the \ndevelopment of airport facilities that are access-friendly with gender-sensitive design features. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n30.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.25 \n \n31.  Environment (category A). The MOTC prepared an environmental impact assessment \nincluding  (i)  an  environmental  and social  audit  of the  existing  airport  facilities,  and (ii)  an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The draft environmental impact assessment was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 25 March \n2021.26 The environmental and social audit has identified a number of areas where environmental \nand social safeguard performance could be improved at PNLIA, including waste management \nand environmental monitoring. \n \n32.  During construction, significant negative environmental impacts are anticipated on air \nquality, water quality (surface water, groundwater, and coastal water), soils, biodiversity, land use, \nnoise, hazardous and nonhazardous waste, spoil disposal, local utilities and infrastructure, \noccupational health and safety, and community health and safety, without mitigation in place. The \nproject is not anticipated to result in transboundary impacts. There is a potential for significant \ncumulative impacts if works under the project are undertaken concurrently with works for the new \nairport terminal to be financed by JICA and a road upgrade project linking the airport to Tasitolu \nunder consideration by the government. The project design and the EMP include relevant \nmitigation measures such as temporary noise screens, silt curtains around work zones and \nspillways, and watering access roads. Coastal geohazards and rising sea levels due to climate \nchange may affect the project. Several adaptation measures have been integrated into the project \ndesign to limit such impacts, including raising the height of the revetment to avoid overtopping \nduring storm surges and to protect against tsunami. \n \n33.  The conceptual modeling of longshore sediment transportation indicates that significant \nadverse environmental impacts on coastal geomorphology and biodiversity may be expected in \nthe long term. The magnitude of the impacts will be reassessed using the primary data collected \nduring the detailed design, and mitigation measures, such as installation of a box culvert, will be \nadjusted as appropriate before construction works begin. \n \n \n24 The Asia Foundation. 2016.

A total area of 201,893 square meters of land \nwill be permanently acquired by the project, and safeguards due diligence has identified about \n248  affected  households  (1,437  affected  persons).  Of these,  203  affected  households  are \nexpected to be severely affected (1,226 severely affected persons), with 37 affected households \n(194 affected persons) losing 10% or more of their total productive land and 166 affected \nhouseholds  (1,015  affected  persons)  physically  displaced.27  A  draft  land  acquisition, \ncompensation, and support plan (LACSP) has been prepared to address the project\u2019s land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  impacts,  in  consultation  with  local  communities  and  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and relevant government laws and \nregulations.  Project  information  has  been  disclosed  to  affected  persons  throughout  project \npreparation, and the draft LACSP was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 23 March 2021.28 The LAR \ncosts are estimated to be $8.6 million to be financed by the government. The draft LACSP will be \nupdated based on the replacement cost study and detailed engineering design and in consultation \nwith affected households and other stakeholders. All involuntary resettlement impacts will have \nbeen mitigated in full prior to the start of civil works. A grievance redress mechanism will help \nresolution  of  any  complaints  during  project  implementation.  Effective  internal  and  external \nmonitoring of LAR progress will be pursued at all stages of project implementation. \n \n35.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Due diligence did not identify any indigenous peoples \nor ethnic minorities in the project area. No indigenous peoples impacts are expected. \n \nG.

Women, albeit few, are more likely to be interested in administrative positions. \ng  Elements of an inclusive human resources development plan may include the following: equal employment \nopportunities; equal pay for equal work; adequate parental (both maternity and paternity) leave; targeted recruitment, \nretention, and promotion of women in managerial and technical positions; organizational mentorship programs for \nyoung female employees; and prevention and response policy for GBV-SEAH. \nh  This includes a 1-year defect liability period.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n \n ", "16  Appendix 2 \nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=52320-002-3 \n \n 1.
