An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nAssessment  undertaken for the supplementary grant. \n   \nProject Description  The  proposed  supplementary  grant  will  fulfill  the  expected \noutcome  and  outputs  of  the  project.  It  will  improve  about \n367 kilometers (km) of Route 4 (the project road) from Xiang- \nNgeun to Nakha, construction of a bridge over the Mekong River \non the project road, and improvement of about 100 km of rural \naccess roads in the project area. The project will also (i) support \nmaintenance of the national road network by providing financing \nfor  periodic  road  maintenance,  (ii)  improve  road  safety  by \nfinancing consulting services to continue the ongoing road safety \nassistance program, and (iii) finance a program to reduce the risks \nof HIV/AIDS/sexually transmitted infections and human trafficking \nthat may develop during the improvement and operation of the \nproject  road.  The  project  will  support  regional  cooperation \nbetween the Lao PDR and Thailand by facilitating cross-border \ntraffic movement on border crossings between the two countries. \nThe supplementary grant will finance cost and quantity overruns \nfor the improvement of Route 4, including road widening of 60 km. \n   \nRationale  Poor basic infrastructure is a major impediment to subregional \neconomic cooperation. The Lao PDR is pivotal to the Greater \nMekong Subregion transport corridors linking northern Thailand, \nnorthern Viet Nam, and the southern provinces of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. Improving routes that connect provinces in the \nLao PDR  will  enhance  subregional  connections  between  the \nnorthern  Lao  PDR  and  surrounding  countries,  as  well  as \neconomic growth and poverty reduction within the Lao PDR.  \n \nThe  project  was  approved  on  27  September  2007,  and \nprocurement activities were started in 28 June 2007. Invitations to \nbid on civil works packages for sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 were issued \nin March 2008. The closing date for bids was July 2008. The four \ncivil works contracts were signed on 3 December 2008. \n \n ", "ii   \n  The proposed supplementary grant will finance the increase in \ncosts  of  civil  works  for  sections  2\u20135  of  the  project  road.  The \nincrease  in  project  costs  results  from  (i)  price  increases,  and \n(ii) the increase in civil works quantities between those used at \nappraisal based on the preliminary project preparatory technical \nassistance design and those in the detailed designs carried out by \nthe civil works contractors, and for widening 60 km of section 5. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  project  will  facilitate  regional  cooperation  and  increased \neconomic growth in the Greater Mekong Subregion by improving \nthe national highway linking the Louangphrabang area with the \nLao PDR\u2013Thailand border. Improvement of this road, much of \nwhich currently has a gravel and earth surface, and rural access \nroads will facilitate increased exports to Thailand of agricultural \ngoods produced in the project area and increased tourism from \nThailand to Louangphrabang. The impact of the project will be \nincreased trade and economic growth in the project area and the \nregion.  The  outcome  will  be  more  efficient  transport  on  the \nregional and national road networks. \n   \nRevised Project  The  revised  investment  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at \nInvestment Plan   $118.6 million, including taxes and duties of $8.1 million. \n   \nRevised Financing Plan  Source  Base  Supp  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  27.0  27.0  54.0  45.5 \nOPEC Fund for International  11.0  0.0  11.0  9.3 \nDevelopment \nGovernment of Australia  14.5  0.0  14.5  12.2 \nGovernment of the   22.4  0.0  22.4  18.9 \nRepublic of Korea  \nGovernment of the Lao PDRa  13.6  3.1  16.7  14.1 \n       Total  88.5  30.1  118.6  100.0 \na  Includes $8.1 million in taxes and duties. \nBase:  As  stated  in  Asian  Development  Bank.  2007.

The \nProject Management Division of DOR, which is responsible for \nmanaging all DOR projects, will carry out the functions of a project \nmanagement unit. \n ", "  iii\nProcurement  The procurement plan was updated during the fact-finding mission \nin November 2009. \n   \nConsulting Services  The procurement of the supervision consultants for sections 2\u20135 \nhas been completed. The supervision consultants were selected \nin  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time) of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). The supervision consultants have been mobilized \nand will continue to function in accordance with their original terms \nof reference. Consulting services for the HIV/AIDS awareness and \nprevention of human trafficking program will be recruited using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method and biodata technical \nproposal. A national consultant will be recruited as an individual \nconsultant for the external resettlement monitor assignment. All \nconsulting services will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  Project  benefits  include  vehicle  operating  cost  savings,  time \nBeneficiaries  savings, diverted traffic, saving from improved road safety, and \nsavings  from  reduced  maintenance  costs.  An  estimate  of  the \nproject\u2019s economic viability was prepared, based on assessment \nof the direct benefits and costs. The project\u2019s revised economic \ninternal rate of return is estimated at 19.4%.  \n   \nRisks   The major risks identified for the original grant also apply to the \nsupplementary grant. The project is formulated to minimize these \nrisks  during  and  after  project  implementation.  The  most \nidentifiable risk is that the road may not be properly maintained, \nbut the emphasis of ADB and other international institutions on \nand the commitment of the government to road maintenance will \naddress  this  risk.  Compensation,  assistance,  and  income \nrestoration measures relating to involuntary resettlement might not \nbe delivered on time, thereby delaying the start of civil works. The \ngender strategy includes consultation workshops for the affected \nhouseholds to increase their understanding of resettlement issues \nsuch as entitlements, compensation, and the grievance process. \nThe project supervision consultants will include specialists to help \nMPWT manage resettlement, environmental impacts, and ethnic \nminority  specific  activities  and  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \npolicies are complied with. Upgrading of the road will increase the \nmobility of goods and people along the route and could increase \nrisks of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections and human \ntrafficking  in  local  communities,  especially  among  women  and \nchildren.  There  is  also  potential  for  increased  road  traffic \naccidents.  To  minimize  the  potential  risks  of  traffic  accidents, \nHIV/AIDS,  and  human  trafficking,  the  project  includes  a  road \nsafety program and an HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program.  \n \n ", "iv   \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsupplementary grant to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Northern \nGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Transport Network Improvement Project. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. Coordination among development partners is described \nin Appendix 2.   \n \nII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \nA.  Project Rationale \n2.  Enhanced  subregional  economic  cooperation  requires  improved  connections  across \ncountries  and  between  centers  of  economic activity.  The  Lao  PDR  is  pivotal to  the  GMS \ntransport corridors linking northern Thailand, northern Viet Nam, and the southern provinces of \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Improving routes that connect provinces in the Lao PDR \nto  each  other  and  to  borders  will  enhance  subregional  connections  between  the  northern \nLao PDR and surrounding countries. The GMS Transport Sector Strategy Study1 identified the \nproject as a high priority transport project that will link the northern Lao PDR with Thailand. \n \n3.  Future development of the Lao PDR economy will depend on expanding and upgrading \nconnections with its neighboring GMS countries2 to provide linkages that will enable transport of \nproduce and goods to local and international markets. The project will form part of the new GMS \nNortheastern  Corridor  (encompassing  Nanning  in  Guangxi  Province,  PRC;  Hanoi  and \nThanh Hoa  in  Viet  Nam;  Louangphrabang,  Lao  PDR;  and  Bangkok,  Thailand)  which  was \nidentified in the GMS Transport Sector Strategy Study. The upgrading of the project road will \nconnect (i) districts in central and southern Xaignabouli province, (ii) the provincial capitals of \nLouangphrabang and Xaignabouli with a sealed all-weather road, and (iii) the border crossing \nwith Thailand near Kenethaowith the GMS corridors that converge on Louangphrabang. These \n \nconnections  will  reduce  transport  costs  from  the  important  agricultural  areas  in  southern \nXaignabouli to markets in Thailand. The government considers road access to be one of the \nkeys  to  eradicating  poverty,  and  it  is  a  major  focus  of  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty \nEradication Strategy.3   \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n4.  In September 2007, the government and ADB reached an agreement on the impact, \noutcome, outputs, cost estimates and financing plan, and the implementation arrangements for \nthe Northern Greater Mekong Subregional Transport Network Improvement Project.4 The project \nwill improve about 367 kilometers (km) of Route 4, including a new bridge over the Mekong \nRiver, and improvement of about 100 km of rural access roads in the project area. The main \nproject outcome will be more efficient transport on the regional and national road networks. The \nproject consists of (i) civil works to improve five sections of Route 4 from Xiang-Nguen in the \nnorth to Nakha at the border with Thailand in the south, and a new bridge over the Mekong \nRiver; (ii) civil works to improve about 100 km of rural access roads; (iii) provision of funding for \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004.

The \nproject  will  lead  to  increased  trade  between  Thailand  and  the  Lao  PDR;  increased  gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  in  project  area  districts;  increased  exports  to  Thailand,  primarily \nagricultural  products;  increased  tourism  from  Thailand  to  Louangphrabang;  and  an  overall \nreduction in the poverty level in project area districts. \nC.  Cost Estimate and Financing Plan \n5.  The cost of the project was originally estimated at $88.5 million, including taxes and \nduties  of  $6.24  million,  physical  and  price  contingencies,  interest  and  other  charges.

Status and Progress of Project Implementation \n7.  The  project  is  being  implemented  largely  as  programmed,  and  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted as scheduled by 31 December 2013. The government has complied with all grant \nassurances for which compliance is due. The Project Management Division of the Department \nof Roads (DOR) of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) is responsible for \nmanaging the project. The construction supervision consultant was mobilized in September \n2008. Invitations for bid for sections 2\u20135 were issued in March 2008.1 The closing date of all \nbids was in July 2008. Civil works contracts for sections 2\u20135 were signed on 3 December 2008. \nDetailed design of the civil works contractors commenced shortly thereafter, and was largely \ncompleted by mid-2009. At appraisal, the cost of the total length of the four sections, 308.1 km, \nwas estimated at $37.2 million. The total of the winning bids (based on preliminary design level \nquantities) for the four sections totaled $47.4 million, an increase of 27% over the estimated \namount. The detailed design for the four sections ultimately totaled 306.9 km in length, and \nrequired significantly higher quantities of many items. The estimated construction cost rose to \n$67.4 million\u2014an overall increase between appraisal and completion of detailed design of 81%. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY GRANT \n8.  The proposed supplementary grant will finance the increased costs of the civil works \ncontracts for sections 2\u20135. The increase in civil works costs is due to (i) unit price increases, \nand (ii) the increase in civil works quantities between those used at appraisal based on the \npreliminary project preparatory technical assistance2 (TA) design and those specified in the \ndetailed designs carried out by the civil works contractors, and widening of 60 km of section 5. \nThe unit price increases comprise about 30% of the increase in civil works costs, while the \nincrease in civil works quantities comprise about 70%. \n \nA.  Cost Overruns \n1.  Unit Price Increases  \n9.  Unit prices used during the TA were based on prevailing material prices in the Lao PDR \nin  July  2007.  The  final  bid  unit  prices  were  based  on  representative  domestic  prices  for \nJuly 2008, which was essentially at the peak of a large worldwide spike in crude oil prices. From \nJuly  2007  to  July  2008,  there  were  very  significant  increases  in  the  cost  of  construction \nmaterials in the Lao PDR. For example, bitumen increased by 39%, cement rose by 11%, and \n                                                 \n1  Section 1 is financed by parallel financing from the Government of the Republic of Korea. There has been no cost \noverrun on this section. \n2  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Lao People's Democratic Republic for Preparing the Northern GMS \nTransport Network Improvement Project. Manila. \n ", "4     \ndiesel fuel increased by 65%. Further details on unit prices for the civil works contracts are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n2.  Quantity Increases and Other Factors \n10.  Implementation of the project has been based on a design-build concept. The estimated \ncosts of civil works in the original report and recommendation of the President were based on \npreliminary quantities as determined during the TA. Civil works bids were then based on these \npreliminary  quantities.  After  bidding  and  award  of  the  civil  works  contracts,  the  selected \ncontractors carried out detailed designs that determined final contract bid quantities for each \nunit price item, and final civil works contract amounts. During the 1.5\u20132.0 year period between \nthe completion of the preliminary designs and the completion of the detailed designs, there were \nvery significant changes in the road condition. The causes of the extensive damage to the \nexisting  roadway  between  appraisal  and  detailed  design  were  primarily  due  to  (i)  large \nincreases in traffic volumes, particularly heavily loaded trucks; and (ii) two severe rainy seasons \nthat damaged the unpaved road and increased the requirement for routine maintenance at the \nend of these two wet seasons, which the government was unable to provide. Changes in the \nroad condition primarily affected final quantities for earthworks, the pavement structural section \nand drainage items. Among the most important was the widespread deterioration of the existing \nunsealed road, which required significant increases in embankment, subbase, and base course \nmaterials over original estimates. The deterioration of the existing roadway was most acute on \nsection 5. During the preliminary design, a large number of existing drainage structures were \nconsidered to be adequate, only requiring cleaning and extension under the road improvement \nproject. However, during the detailed design phase, it was determined that many of these \ndrainage structures had also deteriorated and become damaged by heavy runoff flows.3 Many \nof the drainage structures thought to be salvageable could not be salvaged, and needed to be \nreplaced.   \n \n11.  In addition, between the time of the TA and the period of detailed design the design \nvehicle axle load in the country was increased from 9.1 tons to 11.0 tons, an increase of 21%. \nThe revised axle load is consistent with the standards on other GMS transport corridors. This \nincrease required increased thickness of subbase and base courses of the project road to \nsatisfy these new design criteria.  \n \n12.  After completion of the detailed design by the civil works contractors, MPWT and the \nsupervision consultants undertook a review of the detailed designs on sections 2\u20135. Taking into \nconsideration  the  recent  and  forecasted  increases  in  traffic  volumes  on  section  5,  MPWT \ndecided to modify the cross-sectional design for section 5. The original detailed design for 60 \nkm of section 5 was based on a 5.5 m formation: 5.5 m of pavement, with no provision for \nshoulders. Since it is contemplated that the pavement width of section 5 will have to be widened \nin the very near future to accommodate already increased traffic and projected traffic increases, \nthe width of 60 km of section 5 will be increased under the present civil works contract, to a \nformation of 8.0 m, with a pavement width of 7.0 m and two 0.5 m wide shoulders4. Drainage \nstructures will also be widened. In addition, a new 0.6 km bypass will be constructed and an \nexisting 2.0 km bypass will be improved on section 5. \n                                                 \n3  Rainfall during 2008\u20132009 was higher than normal. The hydrology and runoff characteristics of many catch basins \nalong the road have changed as a result of heavy recent deforestation, hence higher runoff volumes.   \n4  The remaining 23 kilometers of section 5 already have a width of 8.0 meters. \n ", "  5   \n3.  Regional Cooperation \n13.  Since project appraisal in 2007, there has been a significant increase in cooperation \nbetween the governments of the Lao PDR and Thailand. This cooperation has included the \nprovision of bilateral economic assistance to the Lao PDR from Thailand, much of which is \nbeing provided to the transport sector. A number of these cooperative initiatives are having, and \nwill continue to have, a major impact on the project. Some of the most important project-related \nregional developments are (i) the recently approved new Phoudou border crossing, including \nthe improvement of the 30 km road in the Lao PDR from Phoudou to Paklay, both components \nto be financed by a Government of Thailand grant, which is expected to be implemented by the \nend of 2011; (ii) the new Nong Pachip border crossing that is presently at the planning stage at \nthe provincial level, and scheduled for opening in 2010; and (iii) the proposed new border \ncrossing at the southern terminus of section 5, with the construction of the Nakha Lao\u2013Thai \nFriendship Bridge over the Hueng River. The new bridge will be financed under a grant from \nThailand, with tentative implementation in 2011\u20132012. All three of these projects will open new \nborder crossings between the two countries, and will have a major influence on both traffic \npatterns and traffic volumes in the project area, particularly along sections 4 and 5. Not only will \ntraffic be generated between the two countries, there will also be significant diverted traffic. \nGenerated traffic will include traffic to and from northern Thailand and both Louangphrabang \n(along the project road) and Vientiane. There will also be diverted traffic from northern Thailand \n(Chiangmai, Nan, and Uttaradit) through the Lao PDR, destined for the provinces of Loei, \nLom Sak, Udorn, and Nongkhai in northeastern Thailand.   \n \nB.  Impact on the Project \n14.   The cost and quantity overruns have posed a major risk to the timely and successful \ncompletion of the project, particularly civil works on sections 2\u20135. The proposed supplementary \ngrant will support the original project objectives, outcomes, and outputs. \n \nC.  Rationale \n15.  The proposed supplementary grant is in compliance with ADB\u2019s policy for supplementary \nfinancing.5 The proposed supplementary grant is to cover the project cost overrun. The project \nwill  support  the  government  to  complete  the  improvement  of  Route  4,  part  of  the  GMS \nNortheastern Corridor, by 2013. Expanding and upgrading connections with neighboring GMS \ncountries is crucial for future development of the Lao PDR economy. However, the cost overrun \nhas jeopardized the project, increasing the risk of delays in implementation. There is a strong \nneed for ADB to provide supplementary financial assistance to the government to ensure that \nthe project is completed on time and successfully. The project remains economically viable and \nfinancially sustainable with the supplementary financing. \n \nD.  Revised Cost Estimate \n16.  The revised project cost is $118.6 million, including taxes and duties, and physical and \nprice contingencies. This is an increase of 34.0% over the original cost estimate. The revised \nproject investment plan is in Table 3. The detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and \ntotal cost estimates by financier are in Appendix 4. \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005.

Remedial Steps \n18.  The project supervision consultants will strictly monitor costs for sections 2\u20135 to ensure \nthat there are no further cost increases. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n19.  MPWT (formerly the Ministry of Communications, Transport, Posts, and Construction) \nwill continue to be the executing agency and will be responsible for the overall supervision and \nexecution of the project. DOR is the implementing agency and is responsible for the direct \nsupervision and execution of the project. The Project Management Division of DOR, which is \nresponsible  for  managing  all  DOR  projects,  is  carrying  out  the  functions  of  a  project \nmanagement unit.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n20.  The  proposed  supplementary  financing  will  not  require  any  extension  of  the \nimplementation period. The project will be completed by 31 December 2013. \n \n3.  Procurement \n21.  Procurement of civil works for sections 2\u20135 of the project has been completed. All \nprocurement financed by the ADB and the Government of Australia grants, and OFID loan, has \nbeen in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n22.  Procurement of civil works for section 1, financed by the Government of the Republic of \nKorea,  including  the  new  Mekong  River  Bridge,  has  been  completed.  Procurement  of  the \nsupervision  consultant  for  section  1  has  also  been  completed.  The  procurement  followed \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea procedures. Detailed design was completed in May 2009. \nThe civil works procurement has been tendered, and the civil works contract was executed on \n31 August 2009. The civil works contractor is presently mobilizing its equipment and staff to the \nsite. The total value of the civil works contract did not exceed the amount estimated at appraisal.  \n23.  Procurement for three project components is still pending. MPWT has completed the \ninitial selection exercise of about 100 km of rural access roads to be improved. Design of the \nrural roads is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2010, following agreement between \nMPWT and ADB on the selection of roads and scope of work. Selection of the roads on which \nperiodic  maintenance  is  to  be  carried  out  is  under  way.  The  maintenance  component  is \nexpected to be carried out during the second half of 2010. MPWT has drafted the detailed list of \nequipment to be procured for the Kenthao border crossing. Procurement and installation are \nexpected to take place during the second half of 2010. \n4.  Consulting Services \n24.  Procurement of the supervision consultants for sections 2\u20135 has been completed. The \nsupervision consultants were selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The supervision consultants have been \nmobilized and will continue to function in accordance with their original terms of reference. The \nterms of reference for the consulting services for the HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention of \n ", "8     \nhuman trafficking program have been finalized, and the consultants are expected to be selected \nduring the second quarter of 2010. The consultants will be recruited using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method and biodata technical proposal. The terms of reference for the external \nresettlement monitor assignment have also been finalized. A national consultant is expected to \nbe recruited as an individual consultant for the external resettlement monitor assignment during \nthe second quarter of 2010. The recruitment of an international consultant for the consulting \nservices for the road safety component is expected to take place during the second half of 2010. \nAll consulting services will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and are financed by the Government of Australia.   \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n25.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand the bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of MPWT and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and \nother service providers as they relate to the project. \n \n26.  The  project  incorporates  several  other  measures,  in  addition  to  the  standard  ADB \nrequirements, to deter corruption and increase transparency. The project includes (i) building \nthe capacity of MPWT to comply with ADB and government procedures as outlined in the \nproject administration manual, (ii) establishment of a project website to disclose information \nabout project implementation, and (iii) establishment of a grievance redress mechanism to \nensure greater accountability. The project website provides updated, detailed information on \nproject implementation. For example, the website will include procurement-related information \nsuch as the list of participating bidders, name of the winning bidder, basic details on bidding \nprocedures  adopted,  amount  of  contract  awarded,  and  the  list  of  goods  and/or  services \nprocured. The grievance redress mechanism will receive and resolve complaints and act upon \nstakeholders\u2019  reports  of  irregularities  on  project-related  matters,  including  grievances \nconcerning resettlement. MPWT is publicizing the existence of this mechanism to ensure that \nstakeholders are aware that there is a venue to address concerns or grievances relating to \nfraud, corruption, abuse, and any other aspects of project implementation. Administration of the \nproject will be delegated to the Lao PDR Resident Mission in 2010. The resident mission\u2019s \nproximity to the project area and Lao language capabilities will facilitate close interaction with \nMPWT  and  the  project  supervision  consultants,  as  well  close  monitoring  of  project \nimplementation. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n27.  The  current  disbursement  arrangements  under  the  Northern  Greater  Mekong \nSubregional Transport Network Improvement Project (footnote 4), including provisions for the \nimprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditures  procedures,  will  continue  to  apply  to  the \nsupplementary grant. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n28.  MPWT is maintaining separate accounts for the project, and will have such accounts and \nrelated financial statements audited annually by an external auditor in accordance with auditing \nstandards acceptable to ADB. MPWT will submit to ADB, within 6 months of the close of the \n ", "  9   \nfiscal year, certified copies of audited project accounts and financial statements and auditor\u2019s \nreports, all in English. The audit of such financial statements will include (i) an assessment of \nthe adequacy of accounting and internal control systems with respect to project expenditures \nand other financial transactions, (ii) an assessment of compliance with financial grant covenants \nand ADB requirements for project management, (iii) an opinion on the use of the statement of \nexpenditures procedure, and (iv) an opinion on the use of the imprest account.  \n \n29.  MPWT  is  reporting  the  progress  of  project  implementation  by  submitting  quarterly \nprogress reports to ADB and the co-financiers. MPWT will monitor project implementation in \naccordance with the project implementation schedule, and will keep ADB and the co-financiers \ninformed of any significant deviations from the schedule. The quarterly reports include summary \ninformation  on  basic  data,  utilization  of  funds,  achievement  of  immediate  development \nobjectives, compliance with covenants, implementation progress, land acquisition, resettlement \nprogress, and major issues and problems. Within 3 months of the project\u2019s physical completion, \nMPWT will submit to ADB and the co-financiers a project completion report that will provide a \ndetailed evaluation of the project design, costs, contractors\u2019 and consultants\u2019 performance, \nsocial and economic impact, economic internal rate of return (EIRR), and such other details as \nmay be requested by ADB. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n30.  A set of indicators for evaluating project performance in relation to its impacts, outcomes, \noutputs, and conditions has been agreed by MPWT and ADB. The baseline data include among \nothers (i) economic development and socioeconomic indicators, (ii) transport costs and times, \n(iii) transport charges, (iv) accident rates, (v) international and total traffic levels, (vi) affected \npersons\u2019  incomes,  (vii)  access  to  social  services,  (viii)  jobs  created  in  construction  and \nmaintenance, (ix) incidence of STIs, and (x) incidence of human trafficking. The indicators will \nbe measured and compared with the baseline at project inception, completion, and after 3 years. \nWhere  relevant,  indicators  are  disaggregated  by  gender  and  ethnicity.  The  project \nimplementation consultants will help train MPWT staff in using the monitoring and evaluation \nsystem. The main sources of data include (i) secondary data from government sources, (ii) a \nhousehold socioeconomic sample survey, and (iii) participatory rapid appraisal. MPWT will \nsubmit to ADB a report summarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, completion, and \n3 years after physical completion of the project. \n \n9.  Project Reviews \n31.  ADB, the government, and the co-financiers will conduct regular annual reviews of the \nproject,  and  will  jointly  undertake  a  midterm  review  of  the  project  in  mid-2011  to  assess \n(i) implementation status, (ii) design and construction standards, (iii) performance of consultants \nand contractors, (iv) project impacts, (v) status of compliance with the covenants stipulated in \nthe grant agreement, and (vi) the need for any changes in the project scope or schedule to \nachieve the project impact. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Traffic Forecast  \n32.  During preparation of the supplementary grant, new traffic counts were conducted at the \nsame sites along the project road that were used during preparation of the original project. \nSubstantial changes in traffic levels and composition have occurred since the original traffic \n ", "10    \ncounts. Actual traffic levels are higher than were originally forecast. While the numbers of \nmedium buses, light trucks, and motorcycles were lower than in the original forecast, there were \nsubstantial increases in the numbers of cars, medium trucks, and heavy trucks compared to the \nforecast. The numbers of four-wheel drive vehicles and light and heavy buses were also higher, \nalthough to a lesser extent. Traffic forecasts by vehicle type were prepared for the project road \nsections for 2010\u20132032 (Appendix 7). The forecasts are based on expected growth in GDP, \nincome elasticities of demand, and analysis of regional trade and tourism patterns. Total traffic \nexcluding motorcycles is higher than the original project forecast, based on the actual traffic \nlevels since project approval. Total traffic including motorcycles is forecast to grow at annual \nrates of about 4.8%\u20135.7% during 2010\u20132032, except during 2011\u20132015, when growth rates are \nhigher as a result of generated traffic. The projected growth rates are reasonable, considering \nexpected economic growth in the project area and experience in other ADB-financed road \nprojects. Generated traffic arises from increased shipments of agricultural commodities and \nother  goods,  and  increased  passenger  traffic  carrying  tourists  between  Thailand  and \nLouangphrabang. The improved road conditions will also generate demand by reducing vehicle \noperating costs (VOCs). \n \nB.  Economic Benefits \n33.  The  economic  analysis  has  been  revised  to  incorporate  updated  project  costs,  the \nrevised traffic forecast, and updated values of benefits (Appendix 7). The economic analysis \nwas carried out for the project by comparing the with- and without-project scenarios. In the \nwithout-project scenario, the road is assumed to remain in its present condition. The with-project \nscenario includes routine and periodic maintenance according to international standards. The \nproject preparatory TA (footnote 6) considered various mutually exclusive project alternatives \nsuch as different pavement types and alignments, and the proposed project is based on the \nmost cost-effective and least-cost option. Project economic costs include the resource costs of \nroad  improvement  and  maintenance,  equipment,  and  consulting  services.  The  primary \neconomic benefits for the project are VOC savings, time savings, diverted traffic, savings from \nimproved road safety, and savings from reduced maintenance costs. Economic benefits were \ncalculated using the same methodology used for costs. VOC savings will accrue primarily from \nimprovements in the road surface, horizontal and vertical alignment, and increased average \nspeed. VOC savings for normal traffic account for about 54% of total benefits while benefits \nfrom generated traffic account for about 16%. Generated traffic is defined as new traffic induced \nfrom the reduction in transport costs arising from the project, and includes both international and \ndomestic generated traffic. Benefits for generated traffic are estimated at half the value of VOC \nsavings for normal traffic. The project will result in improved average speeds along the project \nroad, and the travel time for the entire length of the project road will be reduced from about 11 \nhours to about 6 hours. Time savings account for about 19% of total benefits. Benefits from \nimproved  road  safety  and  reduced  maintenance  costs  comprise  smaller  portions  of  total \nbenefits. The project will also have other benefits, such as improved access to social services. \nHowever, these have not been quantified because of lack of sufficient data. \n \n34.  The EIRR for the project is 19.4%, and the net present value is $40.7 million, using a \n12% discount rate. The EIRR and net present value have increased from those for the original \nproject (EIRR of 16.6% and net present value of $22.3 million) primarily because of the change \nin composition of traffic and increased traffic forecast. In particular, the numbers of heavy \nvehicles, especially medium and heavy trucks, and cars, in the revised traffic forecast are \nsignificantly higher than in the original traffic forecast, in accordance with actual traffic levels \nsince approval. Since these heavy vehicles have high operating costs, they generate large VOC \nsavings  with  the  improved  road,  providing  substantial  economic  benefits.  These  additional \n ", "  11   \nbenefits exceed the negative impact on the economic return of the increased project costs. \nWhile total traffic is lower in the revised forecast, this is because the number of motorcycles is \nmuch lower than in the original forecast. Since motorcycles have very low VOCs relative to \nother vehicle types, reduction in their numbers has only a small effect on the level of project \nbenefits.  \n \n35.  Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effects of negative changes in the key \nparameters that determine the benefits and costs of the project. The sensitivity analysis for the \nproject indicates that capital costs would have to increase by 51% or total benefits decrease by \n39% for the EIRR to reach the level of 12%. Given ADB\u2019s experience with similar projects in the \nLao PDR and the completion of detailed design work, such changes are not expected to occur. \nThe sensitivity analysis shows that the EIRR exceeds 12% in all cases. A distribution analysis \nwas carried out. Project benefits accruing to the Lao PDR are distributed among five groups: \n(i) users of freight transport, (ii) users of passenger transport, (iii) vehicle owners, (iv) labor, and \n(v) the government and/or economy of the Lao PDR. Users of passenger transport receive \nabout 29% of total benefits, users of freight transport receive about 24%, vehicle owners receive \nabout 14%, and the government and/or the economy receives about 31%.  \n \nC.  Resettlement \n36.   The project is rated category B, and a short resettlement plan was prepared for the \nwhole  length  of  Route  4  and  the  Mekong  River  Bridge  as  part  of  the  original  grant.  The \nresettlement plan is divided into five sections and it is currently being updated following detailed \ndesign. It is expected that road widening may increase the number of households but the \nimpacts will not be significant. Specific to section 5, the draft updated resettlement plan shows \nthat the number of households increased from 57 to 805, but only seven households will be \nrequired to relocate. Impacts on agricultural land are marginal and no household will lose 10% \nor more of its productive assets. Therefore, the project is still rated category B.  \n \nD.  Social Impact and Gender \n37.  The project will provide direct social benefits in addition to the economic benefits, which \nwill expand economic opportunities available to the poor. The project road passes through \nlargely agricultural areas that are in transition from production for subsistence consumption and \nfor local markets to more export and commercially oriented crops. Rural women in the project \ndistricts are engaged in both subsistence and commercial agriculture. Upgrading of the project \nroad will provide a strategic all-weather link that will facilitate improved access for men and \nwomen to goods, markets, schools, medical facilities, and other social services for the project \ndistricts. The improved road access will lower the costs for the public sector to provide social \nservices. The project will have a positive health impact on people from about 120 villages \nlocated along the road, by improving the very dusty and hazardous road conditions in which \nchildren walk several kilometers to school during the dry season. Increased access to transport \nin the project districts will increase enrollment of children from rural areas in the secondary \nschools in towns. Construction and operation of the road will provide significant employment \nopportunities  for  poor  people.  Poor  men  and  women  will  also  benefit  through  seasonal \nemployment from road maintenance work. Increased tourism will generate additional demand \nfor locally produced goods and services. Improvement of rural access roads will help to extend \nthe project benefits and opportunities to rural communities.  \n \n38.  Potential adverse social and gender impacts from the project, in addition to the project\u2019s \nresettlement impacts, include (i) increased traffic safety risks for people living and working along \n ", "12    \nthe road caused by higher traffic levels and higher vehicle speeds along the improved road; and \n(ii) increased risks of exposure to HIV/AIDS and human trafficking of women and children during \nconstruction and operation because of the influx of construction workers and increased transit \ntraffic. The project will address these risks through the road safety component and HIV/AIDS \nand human trafficking program. \n \nE.  Indigenous Peoples \n39.  In the project area, 82.3% of the population is classified Lao-Tai (the main ethnic group); \n10.8% Mon-Khmer; 5.8% Hmong-Mien; and 0.3% Chinese-Tibetan. The indigenous peoples \ngroups have been relocated to the project area since 1970 because of the Indochina war and as \npart of government relocation efforts. The groups now practice sedentary agriculture and rice \nfarming, and have been involved in commercialization of agriculture. Although they retain their \ntraditional culture, religion, and social organization, they have adopted mainstream language, \neducation, and agricultural practices. The literacy rate among the Mon-Khmer is close to the \nnational average, but the Hmong-Mien have a literacy rate about half the national average. The \nvillage consultation indicates that indigenous peoples groups support the road improvement. \nThe Khmou live along the project road and account for 40% of the 255 households potentially \naffected by resettlement. The impact on their agricultural land is minor. These groups will benefit \nfrom the economic development arising from the project, including improved access to markets \nand social services and greater opportunities for their roadside small businesses. The project is \nrated  category  B.  Specific  actions  are  already  included  in  the  resettlement  plan  and  the \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking prevention program to ensure that they are not marginalized \nand become vulnerable by resettlement activities and changes brought by upgrading of the \nproject road. \n \nF.  Environmental Assessment \n40.  The  project  classification  is  environment  category  B.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) for the supplementary grant was carried out and reviewed by ADB. The IEE \nconcluded that the project will not have any major adverse environmental impacts and only \nshort-term air and water pollution, noise, traffic disturbance, and soil erosion impacts during the \nconstruction period. The mitigation measures identified in the IEE\u2019s environmental management \nplan include (i) restoration of affected areas, e.g., borrow pits, after project completion; (ii) \nimplementation of slope stabilization measures; (iii) controlling sewage discharge and other \nwaste fluids from construction sites, and hazardous and toxic materials from bitumen plants and \nfrom  construction  equipment;  (iv)  maintaining  proper  drainage  to  avoid  stagnation  and \ncontrolling downstream water pollution; (v) topsoil removal and reinstallation for re-vegetation \nupon completion of road improvement works; (vi) minimizing noise, dust, emissions, and other \npollutants  associated  with  civil  works;  and  (vii)  provision  of  adequate  road  access  during \nconstruction. The project will eliminate heavy road dust emissions, thereby reducing safety risks \ncaused by extremely poor road visibility under current road conditions. The road improvement \nwill also reduce associated health risks to roadside communities. The project will have overall \nbeneficial environmental impacts and will have minor negative impacts, which will be carefully \nmonitored and adequately mitigated.  \n \nG.  Risks \n41.  The major risks identified for the original grant also apply to the supplementary grant. \nThe project is formulated to minimize potential risks during and after project implementation. \nThe traffic forecast may not materialize, but the project remains viable even with substantially \n ", "  13   \nlower traffic levels. There is a risk that the road may not be properly maintained, but this will be \naddressed by the emphasis of ADB and other international institutions, and the commitment of \nthe  government  to  road  maintenance.  Compensation,  assistance,  and  income  restoration \nmeasures relating to involuntary resettlement might not be delivered on time, thereby delaying \nthe start of civil works. The gender strategy includes consultation workshops for the affected \nhouseholds  to  increase  their  understanding  of  resettlement  issues  such  as  entitlements, \ncompensation, and the grievance process. Upgrading of the road will increase the mobility of \ngoods and people along the route and could increase risks of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking in \nlocal communities, especially among women and children. To minimize the potential risks of \nincreased road traffic accidents, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking, the project includes a road \nsafety program and an HIV/AIDS and human trafficking mitigation and awareness program.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n42.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  government  has  assured  its  continued \ncompliance with the covenants set forth in the Grant Agreement dated 26 November 2007. In \nparticular, the government will ensure that the widening of section 5 complies with all covenants \nrelating  to  implementation  of  the  updated  resettlement  plan  and  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards.   \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n43.   I am satisfied that the proposed supplementary grant would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ngrant not exceeding the equivalent of $27,000,000 to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, for the Northern Greater Mekong Subregion Transport \nNetwork Improvement Project, on terms and conditions substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \nDate: 29 March 2010 \n ", "14   Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions  \nSummary  and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nTrade in the region and  1.

The major development partners active in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) \ntransport  sector  are  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  Japan  (through  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency), and the World Bank. Other multilateral donors finance smaller projects or \nprovide cofinancing for ADB or World Bank projects. Several other bilateral donors provide assistance \nas well. ADB, Japan, and other bilateral donors provide substantial assistance for projects addressing \nregional  cooperation  and  integration.  ADB  assistance  in  this  area  is  provided  through  Greater \nMekong  Subregion  transport  corridor  projects.  Japan  and  other  bilateral  donors  have  provided \ncofinancing for these projects. Japan, Australia, and Thailand have also financed bridges connecting \nthe Lao PDR with its neighbors. The World Bank, ADB, and Japan have financed many projects \naddressing economic growth through rehabilitation or maintenance of national roads, with the World \nBank focusing on maintenance in recent years. The World Bank, ADB, the Swedish International \nDevelopment Agency (Sida), and others have provided a smaller amount of financing for projects \naddressing economic growth through rehabilitation or maintenance of provincial or rural roads. \n \nTable A2.1: Major Development Partners \nLoan/Grant\nSectors and  Source of  Amount  Road Sections/  Length Completion\nThemes  Funds  Projects  ($ million)  Bridges  (km)  (Expected) \nTransport, and  ADB  East\u2013West Corridor  L-32.0  NR 9: M.Phin\u2013Daen  78.0 2005 \ninformation and  Savane \ncommunication  JICA  East-West Corridor  G-59.0  NR 9: Xeno-Phalan\u2013 160.6 2003 \ntechnology;  Phin \nregional  JICA  East\u2013West Corridor  L-41.2  2nd Mekong Bridge\u2013    2006 \ncooperation and  Savannakhet \nintegration  ADB/THA/  Northern Economic  L-90.0  NR3: Houayxai\u2013 220.0 (2008) \nPRC  Corridor  Boten \nADB/OFID/  Northern Greater  G-27.0  NR 4: Xiang Ngeun\u2013 367.0 (2013) \nRepublic of  Mekong Subregion  G-14.5  Nakha \nKorea/  Transport Network  (Aus) \nAustralia  Improvement  L-22.4  \n(Kor) \nTHA  Road NR2  L-20.0  NR2: Pakbeng\u2013Thai  46.0 (2008) \nBorder (M.

Institutional Arrangements and Processes for Development Coordination \n2.  There is substantial coordination among the major donors in the Lao PDR transport \nsector. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport arranges joint project review missions and \nstrategy  discussions  twice  per  year,  in  which  the  World  Bank,  Sida,  and  ADB  regularly \nparticipate;  and  at  times  other  donors.  Frequent  informal  communications  are  maintained \namong the donors. The World Bank and ADB cooperate closely in formulation of projects. For \nexample, while the World Bank has taken the lead in addressing road maintenance, ADB \nprojects have included components for road maintenance, which are designed to follow Road \nMaintenance  Fund  procedures  established  with  World  Bank  assistance.  ADB  coordinates \nclosely with bilateral and other multilateral donors. Financing for the Northern Greater Mekong \nSubregion Transport Network Improvement Project includes cofinancing from Australia, the \nRepublic of Korea, and the OPEC Fund for International Development. Previous ADB projects \nhave included cofinancing from Sida, the Nordic Development Fund, the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, and Thailand. \n \n ", "20   Appendix 3 \nPRICE CHANGES: JULY 2007 (TIME OF APPRAISAL) COMPARED WITH 2008 AND 2009 \n \nJuly 2007  July 2008  Percentage \nPreliminary  Median Unit  Percentage  October 2009  Increase \nDesign Basis  Price as Bid  Increase  Fact-Finding for  July 2007 to \nUsed at  by Civil Works  July 2007 to  Supplementary  October \nItem  Appraisal  Contractors  July 2008  Grant  2009 \nMaterial costs ($)           \nBitumen (liter)  $0.67   $0.93   38.8  $1.01  50.7 \nAggregate subbase,  $6.50   $14.80   127.7  $7.00  7.7 \ntype a (m3) \nAggregate base, type  $22.00   $23.64   7.5  $23.00  4.5 \nb (m3) \nDiesel Fuel (liter)  $0.85   $1.44   69.4  $0.83  (2.4) \nReinforcing Steel (ton)  $750.00   $1,240.00   65.3  $657.00  (12.4) \nCement (ton)  $76.20   $84.82   11.3  $86.14  13.0 \nUnskilled labor costs   $0.92   $0.92   0.0  $1.81   96.7 \n    (person-hour) \nAppreciation of the kip     $1 = 9,617  $1 = 8,606  10.5  $1 = 8,450  12.1 \n    against the US dollar \nAverage annual    4.5%  7.6%  \u2026  0.7%  \u2026 \n    inflation (%)a \n( ) = negative, \u2026 = not available, m3 = cubic meter.  \na  As measured by the consumer price index (%). \nSources: Department of Roads of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, and the Asian Development Bank. \n \n ", "Appendix 4    21\nREVISED DETAILED PROJECT COST ESTIMATES (2007 versus 2009) \n \nTable A4: Road 4, Sections 2\u20135a \n \n    October 2009   \n    Completion  Difference between Appraisal \nAugust 2007  July 2008  Detailed  and Completion of  \nAppraisal  Awarded Bids  Engineering  Detailed Design \nLength  Cost  Length  Cost  Length  Cost  Length  Costb \nRoad Section  (km)  ($million)  (km)  ($ million)  (km)  ($ million)  (km)  ($ million)  % \n5  Hoauy Pet\u2013 82.58  6.93   82.58  9.90        82.20  21.70   (0.38)  14.77   213.00 \nKenthao\u2013\nBotene\u2013Nakha \n \n4  Paklay\u2013Houay  45.62  4.98   45.62  7.62        45.52  9.94   (0.10)  4.96   100.00 \nPet \n \n3  Nam Pui\u2013Paklay  99.93  12.59   99.93  14.58       99.40  18.05   (0.53)  5.46   43.00 \n2  Xaignabouli via  79.94  12.69   79.94  15.32        79.75  17.71  (0.19)  5.02  40.00 \nThadeua\u2013Nam   \nPui \n \nTotal  308.07  37.19   308.07  47.42        306.87  67.40  (1.20)  30.21  81.00 \n( ) = negative, km = kilometer. \na  Includes taxes and contingencies. \nb Reflects reduction in shoulder widths from 1.0 meter (m) to 0.5 m on all sections; and widening of embankment to 8 m on section 5, \nwith 7.0 m pavement width. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", "22   Appendix 5 \nREVISED COST ESTIMATES BY EXPENDITURE CATEGORY AND FINANCIER \n \nTable A5.1: Revised Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n($ million) \nItem  Basea  Supp  Total  % \nA.

Traffic Forecasts \n1.  During preparation of the supplementary grant, new traffic counts were conducted at the \nsame sites along the project road that were used during preparation of the original project. \nSubstantial changes in traffic levels and composition have occurred since the original traffic \ncounts. Actual traffic levels are higher than originally forecast. While the numbers of medium \nbuses,  light  trucks,  and  motorcycles  were  lower  than  in  the  original  forecast,  there  were \nsubstantial increases in the numbers of cars, medium trucks, and heavy trucks compared to the \nforecast. The numbers of four-wheel drive vehicles and light and heavy buses were also higher, \nalthough to a lesser extent. Traffic forecasts by vehicle type were prepared for the project road \nsections  for  2010\u20132032.  The  forecasts  are  based  on  expected  growth  in  gross  domestic \nproduct, income elasticities of demand, and analysis of regional trade and tourism patterns. \nTotal traffic excluding motorcycles is higher than the original project forecast, based on the \nactual traffic levels since project approval. Total traffic including motorcycles is forecast to grow \nat annual rates of about 4.8%\u20135.7% during 2010\u20132032, except during 2011\u20132015, when growth \nrates are higher as a result of generated traffic developing. The projected growth rates are \nreasonable considering expected economic growth in the project area and experience in other \nroad projects financed by the Asian Development Bank. Generated traffic arises from increased \nshipments  of  agricultural  commodities  and  other  goods,  and  increased  passenger  traffic \ncarrying tourists between Thailand and Louangphrabang. The improved road conditions will also \ngenerate demand by reducing vehicle operating costs (VOCs).

Economic Analysis \n2.  The  economic  analysis  has  been  revised  to  incorporate  updated  project  costs,  the \nrevised traffic forecast, and updated values of benefits. The economic analysis was carried out \nfor the project by comparing the with- and without-project scenarios. In the without-project \nscenario, the road is assumed to remain in its present condition. The with-project scenario \nincludes routine and periodic maintenance according to international standards. The project \npreparatory  technical assistance considered various  mutually  exclusive  project  alternatives, \nsuch as different pavement types and alignments, and the proposed project is based on the \nmost cost-effective and least-cost option. The economic analysis covers 25 years (2008\u20132032), \nbased on a 6-year implementation period. The economic prices are expressed using the world \nprice numeraire. \n \nC.  Costs \n3.  Project  economic  costs  include  the  resource  costs  of  road  improvement  and \nmaintenance,  equipment,  and  consulting  services.  Price  contingencies,  interest  during \nconstruction, and taxes and duties are excluded. Costs were divided into tradable and non-\ntradable portions. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to the non-tradable portion. \nTo take into account local unemployment and underemployment, costs for unskilled labor were \nadjusted by a shadow wage rate factor of 0.9 to arrive at the economic opportunity cost. \n \nD.  Benefits \n4.  The primary economic benefits for the project are VOC savings from normal, generated, \nand diverted traffic; time savings; savings from improved road safety; and savings from reduced \nmaintenance costs. Economic benefits were calculated using the same methodology used for \ncosts. VOCs were recalculated using 2009 prices. VOC savings will accrue primarily from \nimprovements in the road surface, and horizontal and vertical alignment. Unit economic VOCs \nfor  nine  types  of  vehicles  were  estimated  using  the  Highway  Design  and  Maintenance \nStandards  Model-IV  and  representative  VOCs  are  shown  in  Table  A7.4.  VOC  savings  for \nnormal traffic account for about 54% of total benefits while benefits from generated traffic \naccount for about 16%. Generated traffic is defined as new traffic induced from the reduction in \ntransport costs arising from the project, and includes both international and domestic generated \ntraffic. Benefits for generated traffic are estimated at half the value of VOC savings for normal \ntraffic. Benefits from diverted traffic arise from the diversion of traffic from other roads in the Lao \n ", "30   Appendix 7 \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), particularly Route 13 from Vientiane to the northern \nLao PDR. \n \nTable A7.4 Representative Vehicle Operating Costs by Vehicle Type \n($ per vehicle-km) \nVehicle Type  Without Projecta  With Projectb  VOC Savings \nRolling terrain       \nCar  0.191  0.233  0.042 \nFour-wheel drive  0.205  0.317  0.112 \nLight bus   0.181  0.223  0.042 \nLight truck   0.170  0.219  0.049 \nMedium truck  0.352  0.511  0.159 \nHeavy truck  0.599  0.846  0.247 \nkm = kilometer, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \na  Corresponding to an international roughness index of 10 for a gravel road. \nb   Corresponding to an international roughness index of 2. \nSource:  Consultants estimates. \n \n5.  Time savings account for about 19% of total benefits, and include savings in passenger \nand freight time. The project will result in improved average speeds along the project road, e.g., \nfrom 56.1 kilometers per hour (km/hour) to 82.8 km/hour for a car. The travel time for the entire \nlength of the project road will be reduced from about 11 hours to 6 hours. The value of time \nsaved by passengers traveling during work time was calculated at $0.28 per hour, based on an \nestimate of passengers\u2019 average annual income. This value was also used for people traveling \nduring leisure time since no data on people\u2019s willingness to pay for travel time savings in the \nLao PDR was available. The value of time saved for freight is assumed at $1.58/vehicle-hour for \nlight trucks, $7.09/vehicle-hour for medium trucks, $9.45/vehicle-hour for heavy trucks, and \n$0.24/vehicle-hour for motorcycles and motorized tricycles. Benefits from improved road safety \nand reduced maintenance costs comprise smaller portions of total benefits. Savings in road \nmaintenance  costs  are  based  on  the  routine  maintenance  necessary  to  maintain  an \ninternational roughness index of 10, including grading of the current earth surface of the road. \nSavings from improved road safety arise from the reduced number of accidents per vehicle-\nkilometer on the improved road, and in the severity of accidents. The cost per accident was \nestimated at $1,165, based on government statistics. The project will also have other benefits, \nsuch as improved access to social services, but these have not been quantified because of the \nlack of sufficient data. \n \nE.  Results of Economic Analysis \n6.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was recalculated for the project. The EIRR \nfor the project is 19.4%, and the net present value is $40.7 million, using a 12% discount rate \n(Table A7.5). The EIRR and net present value have increased from those for the original project \n(EIRR of 16.6% and net present value of $22.3 million) primarily because of the change in \ncomposition of traffic and the increased traffic forecast. In particular, the numbers of heavy \nvehicles, especially medium and heavy trucks, cars, and light buses, in the revised traffic \nforecast are significantly higher than in the original traffic forecast, in accordance with actual \ntraffic  levels  since  approval.  Since  these  heavy  vehicles  have  high  operating  costs,  they \ngenerate large VOC savings with the improved road, providing substantial economic benefits. \nThese additional benefits exceed the negative impact on the economic return of the increased \nproject costs. While total traffic is lower in the revised forecast, this is because the number of \nmotorcycles is much lower than in the original forecast. Since motorcycles have very low VOCs \n ", "Appendix 7  31\nrelative to other vehicle types, their reduction has only a small effect on the level of project \nbenefits. \n \nTable A7.5: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n($ million) \n        ----------------------------------------------Benefits-------------------------------------------- \nCapital  Maint  Total  Normal  Generated  Time  Diverted  Road  Maint  Total  Net \nYear  Costs  Costs  Costs  Traffic  Traffic  Savings  Traffic  Safety  Savings  Benefits  Benefits \n2008  0.479  0.000  0.479  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  (0.479) \n2009  13.377  0.000  13.377  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  (13.377) \n2010  17.908  0.000  17.908  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  (17.908) \n2011  21.704  0.000  21.704  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  (21.704) \n2012  20.235  0.000  20.235  5.487  0.650  1.576  0.255  0.004  0.000  7.971  (12.264) \n2013  24.171  0.000  24.171  10.144  1.828  3.082  0.465  0.008  2.230  17.757  (6.414) \n2014  0.000  2.169  2.169  11.581  2.832  3.721  0.525  0.009  2.230  20.898  18.729 \n2015  0.000  2.169  2.169  11.906  3.720  4.046  0.533  0.009  2.230  22.445  20.277 \n2016  0.000  2.169  2.169  12.247  3.863  4.186  0.542  0.010  2.230  23.078  20.909 \n2017  0.000  2.169  2.169  12.603  4.016  4.333  0.551  0.010  2.230  23.744  21.575 \n2018  0.000  7.540  7.540  12.953  4.171  4.481  0.565  0.011  2.230  24.411  16.870 \n2019  0.000  2.169  2.169  13.317  4.335  4.635  0.580  0.011  2.230  25.109  22.940 \n2020  0.000  2.169  2.169  13.697  4.509  4.798  0.595  0.012  2.230  25.841  23.672 \n2021  0.000  2.169  2.169  14.093  4.694  4.968  0.611  0.012  2.230  26.609  24.440 \n2022  0.000  2.169  2.169  14.506  4.891  5.148  0.627  0.013  2.230  27.415  25.246 \n2023  0.000  2.169  2.169  14.936  5.100  5.337  0.644  0.013  2.230  28.260  26.092 \n2024  0.000  7.540  7.540  15.386  5.322  5.535  0.661  0.014  2.230  29.149  21.608 \n2025  0.000  2.169  2.169  15.855  5.559  5.745  0.678  0.015  2.230  30.082  27.913 \n2026  0.000  2.169  2.169  16.345  5.810  5.965  0.697  0.016  2.230  31.063  28.894 \n2027  0.000  2.169  2.169  16.857  6.079  6.197  0.715  0.016  2.230  32.095  29.926 \n2028  0.000  2.169  2.169  17.385  6.359  6.438  0.735  0.017  2.230  33.165  30.996 \n2029  0.000  2.169  2.169  17.930  6.652  6.689  0.755  0.018  2.230  34.275  32.106 \n2030  0.000  7.540  7.540  18.492  6.959  6.949  0.775  0.019  2.230  35.425  27.885 \n2031  0.000  2.169  2.169  19.071  7.280  7.220  0.796  0.020  2.230  36.618  34.449 \n2032  (36.851)  2.169  (34.682)  19.669  7.616  7.501  0.818  0.021  2.230  37.855  72.537 \n                              EIRR =  19.43% \n                              NPV =  40.692 \n(  ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, Maint = maintenance, NPV = net present value.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Sensitivity Analysis \n7.  Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effects of negative changes in the key \nparameters that determine the benefits and costs and to test that the detailed design has been \ncompleted  and  the  contracts  of  the  project  awarded.  The  sensitivity  analysis,  shown  in \nTable A7.6,  indicates  that  capital  costs  would  have  to  increase  by  51%  or  total  benefits \ndecrease by 39% for the EIRR to reach the level of 12%. Given the Asian Development Bank's \nexperience with similar projects in the Lao PDR, such changes are not expected to occur. The \nsensitivity analysis shows that the EIRR exceeds the level of 12% in all cases. Even if there \nwere  no  generated  traffic,  the  EIRR  remains  above  12%.  To  determine  the  degree  of \nuncertainty of the project, a risk analysis was carried out. Key variables, e.g., costs and traffic \n ", "32   Appendix 7 \ngrowth rates, were assigned a random value within defined limits based on assumed probability \ndistribution functions. A Latin Hypercube type random sampling was used, and the simulation \nrun was made with 500 iterations to generate the probability distribution of the EIRR. The results \nshow that the probability that the EIRR will fall below 12% is less than 1.0% and that the EIRR is \nthus robust. \n \nTable A7.6: Sensitivity Analysis \nSwitching \nItem  EIRR (%)  ENPV  Value (%) \nBase case  19.4  40.692    \n1 year implementation delay  17.5  34.000    \nNormal traffic \u201320%  17.4  28.723   72 \nGenerated traffic \u201320%  18.9  37.056   256 \nTotal benefit \u201320%  15.6  18.552   39 \nCapital costs +20%  16.5  28.420   51 \nNormal traffic \u201320%; capital costs +20%  14.7  16.452   31 \nMaintenance at 50%  17.8  27.389   226 \n           EIRR = economic internal rate of return, ENPV = economic net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nG.  Distribution Analysis \n8.  Distribution analysis was carried out to examine the project\u2019s impact on beneficiaries, \nusing  the  same  EIRR  methodology  and  assumptions  for  discount  rate,  price  numeraire, \nconstant price, and standard conversion factor adjustment. The distribution of benefits is shown \nin Table A7.7. The project benefits are distributed among five national groups: (i) users of \npassenger transport, (ii) users of freight transport, (iii) vehicle owners, (iv) labor, and (v) the \ngovernment and economy of the Lao PDR. Users of passenger transport receive about 29% of \ntotal benefits, users of freight transport receive about 24%, vehicle owners receive about 14%, \nand the economy receives about 31%. \n \nTable A7.7: Distribution of Net Benefits \n($ million) \nFinancial  Economic  Economic -  Passenger  Freight  Vehicle  Net \nItem  PV  PV  Financial  Users  Users  Owners  Labor  Economy  Benefits \nBenefits                    \nNormal Traffic    59.84  59.84  23.94  23.94  11.97       59.84  \nGenerated    18.18  18.18          18.18  18.18  \nTime    20.55  20.55  10.27  5.14  5.14       20.55  \nDiverted    2.63  2.63  1.31  0.66  0.66       2.63  \nSafety    0.05  0.05  0.03    0.03       0.05  \nMaintenance    9.45  9.45          9.45  9.45  \nCosts                    \nInvestment and     (70.75)  (59.51)  11.25          11.25  11.25  \n   maintenance \nLabor    (12.49)  (10.50)  1.98        1.98    1.98  \nNPV  (83.24)  40.69   123.93   35.55   29.73  17.79   1.98   38.88   123.93  \n( ) = negative number, NPV = net present value, PV = present value. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and technical assistance consultants estimates. \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "mmj", "CreationDate": "D:20100331104743+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "ModDate": "D:20100609134716+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "Title": "Microsoft Word - REV29Mar2010 RRP Supp NTNIP.doc"}, "author_page": "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 22 March 2010) \n \nCurrency Unit  \u2013  kip (KN) \n \nKN1.00  =  $0.000118     \n$1.00  =  KN8,475.50     \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB   \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  DOR  \u2013  Department of Roads \n  EIRR  \u2013  economic internal rate of return \n  GDP  \u2013  gross domestic product \n  GMS  \u2013  Greater Mekong Subregion \n  ICB  \u2013  international competitive bidding \n  IEE  \u2013  initial environmental examination \n  km  \u2013  kilometer \n  Lao PDR  \u2013  Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n  m  \u2013  meter \n  MPWT  \u2013  Ministry of Public Works and Transport \n  NCB  \u2013  national competitive bidding \n  OFID  \u2013  OPEC Fund for International Development \n  PRC  \u2013  People\u2019s Republic of China \n  STI   \u2013  sexually transmitted infection \n  TA   \u2013  technical assistance \n  VOC  \u2013  vehicle operating cost \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the government and its agencies ends on 30 September. \nFY  before  a  calendar  year  denotes  the  year  in  which  the  fiscal  year  ends, \ne.g., FY 2010 ends on 30 September 2010.  \n(ii)  In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n \nVice-President  C.
