I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed senior \nloans of up to $30,000,000 to XacBank, and up to $10,000,000 to TenGer Financial Group (for \nonlending to XacLeasing), for Supporting Micro, Small, Medium-Sized Enterprises and Leasing \nFinance in Mongolia.1 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  Development of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) is critical for the \ndiversification of Mongolia\u2019s economy, which relies heavily on the mining industry. MSMEs \nmake up 98% of all enterprises in Mongolia, three-quarters of which are microenterprises.2 \nAccess  to  finance  is  the  foremost  constraint  for  Mongolian  MSMEs\u2014the  World  Bank\u2019s \nEnterprise Surveys show that more than 30% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in \nMongolia perceive access to finance as the largest issue for their operations. 3 It is estimated \nthat  only  about  10%  of  around  37,000  Mongolian  SMEs  regularly  access  finance  through \nbanks.4 Another World Bank study notes that when finance is available to SMEs, loan terms and \nconditions are characterized by high interest rates, shorter maturities, and smaller amounts that \ndo  not  meet  the  full  financial  needs  of  these  companies  and  primarily  require  immovable \ncollateral (footnote 2). There is therefore very significant unmet financing demand from all \nMSME segments in Mongolia, and commercial banks are seeking to raise additional sources of \nfunding to respond to this.  \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) met several financial institutions to find suitable \ncandidates with the interest and ability to serve the MSME segment, and to examine ways to \nsupport  the  financing  needs  of  those  MSMEs  and  SMEs  that  cannot  meet  the  traditional \ncollateral  requirements  of  banks.  Additionally,  ADB  is  developing  a  sovereign  program  to \nimprove substandard living conditions through the provision of priority services to ger areas in \nMongolia's  capital,  Ulaanbaatar (the  Ger  Area Development  Program).5 Currently,  60% (or \nabout 800,000) of the capital\u2019s population lives in the ger areas. ADB considered how the two \nprojects could complement each other. Specifically, funding was needed for small businesses \noperating in the ger areas under the sovereign project. Hence, ADB sought a private sector \nbank that had experience in lending to lower-income businesses in ger areas. (To further \nsupport MSME access to finance, ADB is in the early stages of processing a loan to another \nsystemically important commercial bank in Mongolia, which would complement this initiative).  \n \n4.  ADB held discussions with TenGer Financial Group (TFG), a financial holding group with \nsix subsidiaries engaged in banking, leasing, general insurance, microcredit in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, financial security, and financial advisory services. TFG has a core strategy of \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  World Bank. 2012. Financial Sector Assessment: Mongolia.

Other constraints noted were the tax rate, \ninadequately  educated  workforce,  informal-sector  practices,  political  instability,  and  licensing  and  permitting \nproblems.

Manila.   \n5  The $320 million Ulaanbaatar Urban Services and Ger Areas Development Investment Program (Project Number:  \n45007) targets specific ger areas (named after ger tents) where services such as water supply and sewerage will \nbe provided to economic hubs (subcenters) to rationalize costs. Many businesses are also operated from gers. \n ", "2          \n \n\u201cPeople, Planet, and Profit.\u201d Largest among the group\u2019s holdings is XacBank, which accounts \nfor 97% of its assets. XacBank, a participant in ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program, is a systemically \nimportant  bank  in  Mongolia  with  its  origins  in  microfinance.  XacBank  has  the  highest \ninternational credit rating among Mongolian banks, setting high governance standards since its \ninception. It has excellent asset quality and a strong focus on being responsive to the needs of \nits customers and, more broadly, the people of Mongolia, with the goal of promoting more \nequitable, inclusive growth across the country.6 XacBank expanded into the SME segment, \nwhere there is significant unmet demand for financing, and now provides other standard bank \nproducts.  XacBank  is  active  in  ger  areas  and  has  branches  specifically  in  the  ger  areas \n(Bayankhoshuu and Selbe) targeted under the Ger Area Development Program.7   \n \n5.  XacLeasing, TFG\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, has been active in Mongolia since 2007 \nand  has  a  market  share  of  about  14%.  XacLeasing  provides  leases  to  companies  and \nindividuals, primarily equipment leasing for small businesses and leasing to individuals for \npassenger  vehicles.  By  lending  to  TFG  in  addition  to  XacBank,  ADB  will  also  have  the \nopportunity to support the country\u2019s emerging leasing industry, which is important since some \nbusinesses struggle to provide the collateral typically required by banks. Given XacBank\u2019s \nstrong developmental mandate as compared with the other commercial banks and its ability to \ntouch the underserved poor in Mongolia, coupled with the opportunity to support the leasing \nindustry through TFG, ADB selected XacBank and TFG as candidates for the proposed loans.   \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n6.  TFG was established in 1998 as a holding company for XacBank, which grew to become \none of the most prominent microfinance institutions globally. TFG is now a major Mongolian \nfinancial group with a portfolio of growing companies engaged in financial services. XacBank \naccounts for the majority of group assets, while XacLeasing accounts for 2% of group assets. \nTFG\u2019s insurance subsidiary has limited operations to date. The remaining companies within the \ngroup are service-based firms that generate advisory fees.  \n \n7.  XacBank is Mongolia\u2019s fourth-largest commercial bank. It operates in all 21 provinces \nand in Ulaanbaatar, serving more than 525,000 customers through its 103 retail and four SME \nbusiness branches, as well as specialized banking outlets that include 888 mobile banking \nmerchants and 49 savings and credit cooperatives. XacBank strives to be the market leader in \nMongolia for corporate governance, transparency, and risk management. It has developed a \nreputation for its corporate social responsibility initiatives and received a rating of 4 out of 5 from \nthe development finance rating agency, Planet Finance, for its long-standing social performance. \nThe bank\u2019s goal is to be a client-focused company that is accessible and innovative, and able to \nleverage the economic growth prospects of Mongolia. \n \n8.  XacLeasing was established in 2007 to offer equipment leasing to SMEs and individual \nclients. In February 2013, the company provided leasing services to 331 customers. The total \nlease portfolio at fiscal year-end 2012 was MNT20.9 billion. Construction, road maintenance, \nand transportation represent the largest sector exposure (41%), followed by manufacturing \n(11%), trade (8%), services (7%), and mining (4%). In terms of underlying assets, about 80% of \ntotal leases are passenger and commercial vehicles. The balance is made up of equipment in \n                                                \n6  XacBank and TFG have also been at the forefront of financial education efforts. In 2012, XacBank delivered social \nand financial education programs to 30,000 children and youths throughout Mongolia. \n7  An SME Development Committee has been established in each subcenter. Provision of business incubator \nbuildings combining vocational training and renting space for SMEs is included in the first tranche of the Ger Area \nDevelopment Program. This will form a relevant and efficient vehicle for XacBank\u2019s MSME lending program, and \ncomplement the MSME development component of the ADB sovereign program. ", "              3 \nvarious sectors, such as agriculture, health, and education.8 The company initially adopted a \nconservative  approach,  which  led  to  slow  portfolio  growth  in  early  years  as  management \nfocused on building relationships with vendors.  \n   \n9.  Despite the slower growth initially, XacLeasing has been profitable every year since \n2008, generating an average return on equity of more than 10% by 2012. The company has \ndeveloped  strategic  partnerships  with  key  equipment  vendors  in  Mongolia  covering \nmanufacturing, transportation, mining,  health  care,  and  agricultural  industries.  Bolstered  by \nincreasing demand, more significant growth is expected: the total portfolio is estimated to reach \nMNT500  billion  by  2017.  Cross-selling  is  also  an  important  part  of  TFG\u2019s  strategy,  and \nXacLeasing stands to benefit from leveraging XacBank\u2019s brand recognition and branch network. \nThe International Finance Corporation (IFC) has provided technical assistance to XacLeasing \nfor capacity building in areas such as risk management and corporate governance, and ORIX \nCorporation,  which  became  a  TFG  shareholder  in  2013,  will  provide  strategic  support  for \nXacLeasing as it seeks to scale up its leasing activities.9 \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n10.  Ownership. TFG\u2019s major shareholders are Mongolyn Alt Corporation (MAK) (20%), IFC \n(19%), ORIX Corporation (16%), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) \n(12%), Ronoc (10%), EIT Capital Management (10%), Mercy Corps (8%), and Triodos Fund \n(4%).  The  remaining  small  shareholders  are  Mongolian  individuals  and  the  Mongolian  UB \nRotary Club, Open Society Forum, Equity Investment Trust. XacBank and XacLeasing are \nwholly owned subsidiaries of TFG. \n \n11.  Management.  TFG  and  XacBank  have  an  experienced  and  well-qualified  top \nmanagement; the chief executive officer (CEO) of XacBank, Bat-Ochir Dugersuren, has been \nassociated with the group since 1998 and held many senior positions, including chief financial \nofficer of TFG and deputy CEO of XacBank. The bank has appointed a new chief risk officer in \nSeptember 2013 who gained extensive experience in SME and corporate lending at ABN Amro \nBank. The CEO of XacLeasing is Tsevegjav Gumenjav, supported by the chief operating officer, \nDaurenbek Serikjan. The XacLeasing management team has more than 20 years of combined \nexperience in the finance sector. \n \n12.  Bold Magvan serves as the CEO of TFG, and has been an executive director on its \nboard since January 2011. Before joining TFG, Magvan was XacBank's CEO for 2 years and its \npresident for over 3 years. Magvan is a senior banking professional with more than 20 years of \nexperience  in  global  financial  institutions,  including  the  World  Bank  and  the  International \nMonetary Fund. His career experience also includes 4 years at the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) in \nthe top management position of deputy governor from 1996 to 2000. \n \n13.  Governance structure. TFG recognizes the importance of sound corporate governance \nin supporting its sustainable growth and securing trust among its various stakeholders, including \ncustomers,  staff,  and  shareholders.  Besides  adhering  to  the  Principles  of  Corporate \nGovernance of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, TFG bases its \noperations on the principles and best practices set out in the Corporate Governance Code, \nwhich the Mongolian Financial Regulatory Commission adopted in 2007.  \n                                                \n8  XacLeasing. 2013. Business Plan 2013\u20132017. Ulaanbaatar. \n9  ORIX Corporation is a Japanese financial services group established in 1964. The group offers leasing, lending, \nrentals, life insurance, real estate financing and development, venture capital, investment and retail banking, \ncommodities funds and securities brokering. ORIX has also expanded globally, offering financial services in North \nAmerica, Asia, the Middle East, and Northern Africa. ", "4          \n \n14.  The board of directors of TFG consists of eight members and includes representatives \nfrom EBRD, IFC, ORIX Corporation, and Triodos Fund. The chairperson of the board is Chuluun \nGanbold,  a  Mongolian  national  with  more  than  30  years  of  experience  in  business  and \nadministration. He is a founding member of X.A.C. (Golden Fund for Development), the first \nnonbank  financial  institution  in  Mongolia  and  a  predecessor  of  XacBank.  The  board  is \nresponsible for determining the strategy of TFG and for supervising the conduct of its business, \nincluding responsibility for corporate governance.  \n \n15.  The compliance department manages reporting of any suspicious transactions. The TFG \ncompanies have established \u201cknow your customer\u201d principles, and have adopted policies on \nanti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism. Suspicious transactions are \nidentified by scanning information based on key items such as transaction amount, politically \nexposed persons, and watch lists, and findings are reported to the Financial Information Unit of \nthe BOM.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n16.  The proposed unsecured senior loans to XacBank for up to $30 million and to TFG (for \nonlending to XacLeasing) for up to $10 million will support Mongolian MSMEs through subloans \nmade  by  XacBank  and  through  leases  provided  by  XacLeasing.  The  loan  to  XacBank \nrepresents about 25% of the bank\u2019s annual funding needs based on historical growth rates.10 \nHowever, additional growth is expected in 2014 given the significant levels of unmet financing \ndemand from MSMEs. The proposed ADB loan amount represents less than 15% of XacBank\u2019s \nprojected funding needs for 2014. Of the funding that ADB will provide to XacBank, up to $6 \nmillion will be targeted to MSMEs in the Bayankhoshuu and Selbe ger areas under the Ger Area \nDevelopment Program.  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will receive annual audited financial statements for TFG, XacBank, and XacLeasing \nin  accordance  with  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards.  ADB  will  also  receive \nquarterly  financial  statements  and  compliance  certificates  for  agreed  financial  covenants. \nReporting requirements include (i) updates on governance, safeguards, and social protection \ncompliance;  and  (ii)  updates  on  XacBank  and  XacLeasing\u2019s  business  performance  and \nutilization of the ADB loans. ADB will field review missions at least annually to examine and \ndiscuss progress with TFG, XacBank, and XacLeasing\u2019s management. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s presence adds value through the following: \n(i)  ADB will provide stable long-term financing that cannot be readily raised from the \nlocal market, and is needed to help banks deal with the maturity mismatch on \ntheir balance sheet. Mongolia\u2019s capital markets are undeveloped and commercial \nbank funding is not readily available in large amounts. Also, Mongolia has felt the \nimpact of the problems in Europe's banking industry, which used to provide \nfinancing to Mongolian banks. Hence, Mongolian banks have had to turn to IFIs. \n(ii)  ADB\u2019s loan to XacBank will help overcome the lack of access to finance that \nMSMEs now experience in Mongolia. MSME growth is needed to help diversify \n                                                \n10 XacBank\u2019s loan portfolio growth has averaged about $120 million annually since 2010. ", "              5 \nthe country\u2019s economy. The ADB loan also directly complements the work of the \nsovereign sector\u2019s Ger Area Development Program by helping promote private \nsector  development  and  growth  of  business  activity  in  the  ger  areas  where \nXacBank already has an established branch presence.  \n(iii)  ADB\u2019s funding will also help support the nascent leasing industry in Mongolia, \nwhich is in need of access to funds for its growth. The leasing industry provides a \ncritical  alternative  for  businesses  that  cannot  access  bank  funding  due  to \ncollateral requirements.    \n(iv)  Through on-site monitoring with TFG, XacBank, and XacLeasing management \nover  the  life  of  the  loan,  ADB  will  support  the  group\u2019s  adherence  to  high \ncorporate governance, social, environmental, and risk management standards. \n \nD.  Risks \n \n19.  Challenging  operational  environment.  Mongolia  has  a  small,  narrowly  diversified \neconomy, with high reliance on the cyclical mining sector. Recent high inflation has further \nexposed the banking industry to economic and policy risks, and there have been decreases in \nforeign direct investment and foreign exchange reserves. Solid economic growth prospects, \nalong with progress in economic stabilization and an open, market-led economy partly mitigate \nthese  weaknesses.11 Authorities  have  taken  measures  to  tighten  prudential  regulations  on \ncapital  requirements,  asset  classification,  and  loss  provisions.  The  managements  of  TFG, \nXacBank,  and  XacLeasing  are  cognizant  of  the  risks  imposed  by  Mongolia\u2019s  economic \nenvironment, and to help mitigate the risks imposed by the operating environment, the group \nconservatively manages its capital position and keeps a significant liquidity buffer at XacBank, \nwhich also maintains a diversified and granular loan portfolio with prudent limits on sector and \nborrower concentration. \n \n20.  Rapid growth of credit in Mongolia. Banking credit growth has increased in 2013, \nreaching 23% in the first 6 months of the year, partly driven by the government\u2019s specialized \nprogram funding for SMEs in targeted segments such as meat, flour, and fuel, as well as \nmortgages. This follows a slowdown in credit growth in 2012, when it was 24% for the full year. \nWhile credit growth has increased significantly since the global financial crisis, it was from a \nrelatively small and narrow base. BOM is taking steps to improve bank supervision, and has \nincreased the capital requirements for systemically important banks. As a systemically important \nbank, XacBank is exposed to tougher supervision and a higher regulatory capital requirement \nthan banks that are not considered systemically important. Although it remains a concern, the \nrisk of overheating has also receded as a result of the policy tightening evident in 2012.12  \n \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n21.  Impact. The impacts of the loans are (i) growth of the banking and leasing sectors; and \n(ii) greater access to banking credit and leasing services for underserved MSMEs in Mongolia. \nThis will be reflected by an increase in loans and leases, as well as an increase in the ratio of \nbanking sector credit to gross domestic product, and ratio of leasing sector credit to gross \ndomestic product. Additionally, ADB will support broader finance sector development through \nfinancing XacLeasing in a country that has a very small nonbank sector.  \n \n                                                \n11 Standard & Poor\u2019s. 2013. Banking Industry Country Risk Assessment: Mongolia. New York. \n12 Moody\u2019s Investors Service. 2013. Banking System Outlook: Mongolia. New York. ", "6          \n \n22.  Outcome. The outcome will be the growth and sustainability of XacBank\u2019s financial \nservices and XacLeasing services to MSMEs in Mongolia. This will be measured by monitoring \nnonperforming loans and capital adequacy, and the increased volume of lending to MSME \nborrowers. A large number of new MSME borrowers are expected to be women. Although not \nbeing measured, providing financing to MSMEs will strengthen their role as an important source \nof employment, especially in underserved ger and rural areas. Moreover, funding these entities \nhelps diversify the economy.  \n \n23.  Outputs. The output of the loans is that XacBank\u2019s and XacLeasing\u2019s financial capacity \nto service MSMEs is expanded. XacBank and XacLeasing will provide financial services while \nensuring that adequate investment is made in human resources and business processes. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n \n24.  Strategy 2020\u2019s13 focus on poverty reduction through private sector development and \ninclusive  financial  systems  will  be  supported  by  TFG\u2019s  emphasis  on  funding  underserved \nsegments of the Mongolian population. The Government of Mongolia considers that private \nsector development will be a thematic driver of change, and that ADB assistance is needed to \nstrengthen  financial  markets  to  support  long-term  investment,  innovation,  and  access  to \nfinance. 14 ADB\u2019s  strategy  also  provides  that  ADB  will  increase  access  to  finance  by \nstrengthening financial intermediation through the banking industry. Access for MSMEs and the \nrural population to formal sources of credit is limited. ADB\u2019s finance sector assessment for \nMongolia further concludes that broader and deeper financial intermediation is necessary for \nMongolia  to  achieve  sustainable,  long-term  growth. 15 The  finance  sector  assessment \nrecommends the continued development of the finance sector and improvements in access to \nfinance. The proposed loans are also consistent with the government\u2019s SME development \nprogram aimed at boosting SME capacity and job creation. The loans also complement the \ngovernment\u2019s  ongoing  MSME  lending  programs  through  the  commercial  banks.  These \nprograms target specific sectors and types of enterprises that the government deems eligible, \nso many MSMEs continue to seek funding not available to them under these programs.   \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n \n25.  In 2008, ADB conducted an independent evaluation of ADB assistance to the finance \nsector.16 Based on this analysis, and in view of looming challenges and opportunities, it put \nforward recommendations for future operations. These included (i) considering nonsovereign \nequity investments in and loans to Mongolian banks by ADB to strengthen operational capacity; \n(ii) supporting rural finance by using banks to channel credit to meet the gap in the supply of \nrural finance in the country; (iii) providing longer-term loans to meet and promote the needs of \nSMEs; and (iv) supporting the development of nonbank and capital market sectors.   \n \n \n \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2008.

Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n26.  The loans are classified as category \u201cFI\u201d for impacts on the environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. Subprojects classified as Category A for these criteria \nwill not be financed under the loans. The potential impacts and risks associated with XacBank \nand XacLeasing\u2019s existing and likely future portfolios, and their commitment and capacity for \nenvironmental and social management, have been assessed. Existing social and environmental \nmanagement systems have been reviewed. In respect of loans and leases extended by using \nADB funds, the companies will integrate and apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list \nwith its existing exclusion list; ensure compliance with applicable national laws and regulations, \nand with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). An enhanced environmental and social \nmanagement system (ESMS) satisfactory to ADB will be a condition of first disbursement. The \nESMS will require compliance with national labor laws and will include measures to comply with \ninternationally recognized core labor standards, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy (2001), including provisions prohibiting any discrimination against women in hiring and \nproviding equal pay for equal work for men and women. The human resource policies of TFG \ncompanies are based on equal opportunities. XacBank also targets female customers as an \nimportant business segment, and the bank\u2019s commercial policies and practices support equal \nopportunities  for  women  in  access  to  services  and  markets.  XacBank  commits  to  provide \ngender-sensitive  outreach  training  to  XacBank  and  XacLeasing  staff  on  servicing  women \ncustomers and borrowers. The borrowers\u2019 reporting requirements to ADB include reporting on \nsubloans by gender, and ADB will monitor progress in supporting female borrowers over the \ncourse of the loan. This transaction is classified SGE (some gender elements) under ADB\u2019s \nguidelines on gender mainstreaming.17  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n27.  TFG and XacBank were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international \npractice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB \nwill  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n28.  The proposed senior loans are within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \nsingle investment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.
