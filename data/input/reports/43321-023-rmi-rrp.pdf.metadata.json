In 2010, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  approved  (i) a  program  cluster  for  the  public  sector  program  and  (ii)  financing  from  the \nAsian Development Fund (ADF) of $9.5 million (SDR6,413,000) for subprogram 1 of the public \nsector  program.2 The  public  sector  program  supports  the  implementation  of  the  government\u2019s \nreform initiatives and initiates the adjustments required to achieve long-term fiscal sustainability. \nUnder subprogram 1, policy actions were designed and the implementation of immediate reform \npriorities began. Subprogram 2 will complete the implementation of the policy actions. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  RMI  consists  of  29  low-lying  atolls  and  five  single  islands  that  cover  181  square \nkilometers of land area spread across nearly 5 million square kilometers of the western Pacific \nOcean.  The  country  gained  independence  in  1979,  having  been  administered  by  the  United \nStates  (US)  as  part  of  the  Trust  Territory  of  the  Pacific  Islands  since  1947.  The  2011  census \nrecorded a total population of 53,158 persons, with approximately 74% of the population living \non Majuro and Ebeye.3 ADB has identified the RMI as a fragile situation since 2008; among the \nconstraints  that  underlie  weak  performance  and  fragility  are  weak  public  sector  institutions, \nlimited government capacity, and underdeveloped governance systems.4 \n \nThe  RMI  economy  relies  heavily  on  government  expenditure  and,  in  turn,  on  foreign \n4. \ngrants,  which  fund  more  than  two-thirds  of  government  expenditure.  Most  foreign  grants  are \nprovided  by  the  US,  mainly  under  the  amended  Compact  of  Free  Association. 5  Increased \nforeign grants helped the economy grow at an average annual rate of 3.1% in FY2000\u2013FY2007. \nHowever, the economy contracted by 1.9% in FY2008 and 1.3% in FY2009, as high world food \nand  fuel  prices  raised  inflation  to  14.7%,  prompting  the  declaration  of  a  state  of  national \neconomic emergency. The economy grew by 5.2% in FY2010, driven by an expansion of fishery \noutput  and  exports,  and  moderating fuel  prices. Similarly,  growth in FY2011  was  5.0%,  driven \nby  bigger  fish  catches,  large  inflows  from  the  Kwajalein  land  use  agreement,  and the  Federal \nAviation Administration-funded airport extension project (Table 1). \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2010.

Of  a \n$130 million  annual  budget  in  FY2011,  about  $95  million  was  funded  by  bilateral  donors,  with \napproximately  two-thirds  of  this  representing  Compact  grants.  The  RMI  and  US  governments \nare investing in a Compact trust fund that is intended to generate a revenue stream to replace \nCompact  grants  from  FY2024.  Contributions  from  the  RMI  government  have  fallen  short, \nhowever,  because  excessive  recurrent  expenditure  and  poor  revenue  performance  prevented \nthe generation of the required fiscal surpluses. Under current policies, there will be insufficient \ngovernment assets in the Compact trust fund in 2023 to replace the expiring Compact grants.7 \n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nTable 2: Economic Outlook, FY2012\u2013FY2015 \n\nFY2015  \n\nFY2013  \n\nFY2014  \n\nFY2012  \n\n0.6 \n1.7 \n59.1 \n\u2026 \n0.7 \n52.9 \n\u2026 \n\n2.6  \n3.0  \n60.9  \n\u2026 \n0.5  \n57.0 \n\u2026 \n\nItem \nReal GDP (% change) \n5.4  \nInflation (%) \n2.5  \nRevenue (% of GDP) \n62.9  \nPersonnel costs (% of revenue) \n30.5  \nFiscal balance (% of GDP) \n1.0  \nExternal debt (% of GDP) \n54.8  \n184.3  \nNominal GDP ($ million) \n\u2026 = not available, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSources:  ADB.

Republic of the Marshall Islands. 2011 Article IV Consultation. Washington, DC. \n7  The  International  Monetary  Fund  baseline  scenario  assumes  that  the  government  maintains  a  modest  fiscal \nsurplus of about 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) over the medium term, and GDP growth gradually declines \nto  about  1.5%  over  the  medium  term.  Under  this  scenario  there  would  be  a  gap  of  $15.4  million  to  fully  replace \nexpired Compact grants from FY2024. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fIn 2009, recognizing the need for reform, the RMI government began  several initiatives \n7. \nto advance public sector reform and promote  macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth. \nThese  included  the  preparation  of  a  comprehensive  recovery  plan  for  the  Marshalls  Energy \nCompany (MEC) and the formation of the Comprehensive Adjustment Program (CAP) Advisory \nGroup  and  the  Tax  and  Revenue  Reform  and  Modernization  (TRAM)  Commission  to  prepare \nfiscal reform plans.8 These initiatives formed the basis of the government\u2019s strategy to mitigate \nthe impact of the global financial crisis and subsequently led to the design of ADB\u2019s support for \nthe public sector program (footnote 2). \n \n8. \nSubprogram  1 supported  the  design  and  initial  implementation  of  reforms  to  rectify  the \nsituation  in  which  the  government  found  itself  in  2008  and  2009.  The  subprogram  was \nimplemented successfully by the government and had a positive outcome by putting in place a \nsolid  foundation  on  which  to  begin  the  implementation  of  further  reforms  under  subprogram 2. \nBeginning  in  2009,  and  continuing  throughout  the  implementation  of  the  program,  the  policy \nconditions of subprogram 1 have stabilized the fiscal situation, particularly in the areas of debt \nand expenditure management. \n \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  government  onlent  the  majority  of  loan  funds  to  MEC.9 The \n9. \nfunds were used to repay a high-interest loan held by MEC with a commercial bank. Using the \ncash-flow savings from repaying this loan, MEC was able to refurbish a generator and achieve a \nsignificantly higher megawatt output, which reduced fuel usage by about 14%. \n \n10. \nSubprogram  1  included  several  covenants  concerning  the  rationalization  of  MEC,  of \nwhich the onlending arrangement between the government and MEC was critical in contributing \nto  MEC\u2019s  long-term  commercial  and  financial  stability.10 Under  subprogram 1,  the  government \nwas required to (i) ensure that a subsidiary loan agreement was executed between the Ministry \nof  Finance  (MOF)  and  MEC,  (ii)  establish  a  sinking  fund  account  at  a  commercial  bank  to \naccumulate  funds  to  service  its  repayment  obligations  under  the  loan  agreement,  (iii)  ensure \nthat MEC makes automatic monthly payments into the sinking fund account, and (iv) ensure that \nMOF had the first priority right to receive payments from other assets of MEC in the event of a \ndefault in the obligation of MEC to contribute to the sinking fund account. In addition, the loan \nagreement  required  MEC  to  (i)  open  a  separate  account  at  a  commercial  bank  dedicated  to \nrepair  and  maintenance  funds;  and  (ii)  make  automatic  monthly  payments  into  the  repair  and \nmaintenance account from its revenue accounts, to be used exclusively for repair, maintenance, \nprocurement of spare parts, materials, and equipment (and related labor costs) directly related \nto power generation and distribution. The government has complied with these covenants. \n \n11. \nThe  program  is  aligned with  the  RMI  country  operations  business  plan  (COBP),  2012\u2013\n2014 and ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2010\u20132014. It also applies lessons from earlier ADB policy \nprograms in the RMI and elsewhere in the Pacific, as well as ADB\u2019s approach to engaging with \nweakly  performing  countries,  notably  by  (i)  adopting  a  country-led  set  of  policy  actions \ndeveloped in an open, participatory manner and at a pace in keeping with country practices, and \n(ii) initiating long-term policy dialogue and providing targeted technical assistance (TA). \n \n\n                                                \n8  MEC.  2009.

Majuro. \n\n9  An amount of $8,542,445 (89.9%) was initially onlent to MEC under subprogram 1. \n10 Loan Agreement between Republic of the Marshall Islands and Asian Development Bank (Schedule 5). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n12. \nThe impact will be that the public sector provides more efficient and effective services to \nthe population. The outcome will be that the government achieves fiscal sustainability. For the \npurposes  of  the  program,  fiscal  sustainability  is  defined  as  the  Compact  trust  fund  being  on \ntrack to replace Compact grants in FY2024. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \nOutput  1:  Government\u2019s  fiscal  discipline  improves  over  the  medium  term.  Under \nsubprogram  1,  the  cabinet  endorsed  budget  targets  for  FY2011  and  FY2012  to  bring  budget \noutcomes in line with International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommendations. The key target was \na  budget  surplus  large  enough  to  fund  RMI  contributions  to  the  Compact  trust  fund. \nComplementary  targets  were  set  for  other  budget  items,  including  civil  servant  wages  and \nsalaries, grants and transfers, capital expenditure, and tax revenue. The cabinet also endorsed \ndebt management guidelines for the government and SOEs. \n \n14. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  these  budget  targets  were  to  be  implemented  over  FY2011  and \nFY2012, and fiscal restraint was to be maintained in the preparation of the budget for FY2013. \nTo  improve  fiscal  discipline,  subprogram  2  also  requires  adoption  of  a  public  sector  debt \nmanagement strategy and fiscal responsibility legislation, through an amendment to the existing \nFinancial Management Act, 1990. \n \n15. \nThe  government  does  not  have  a  medium-term  debt  management  strategy,  and  it  has \nrecognized that it needs to adopt a more comprehensive and integrated approach to ensure that \ndebt  is  maintained  at  sustainable  levels.  The  debt  management  strategy  will  provide  the \ngovernment  with  a  path  to  restore  debt  sustainability,  define  its  debt  management  objectives, \nset  risk  management  strategies,  and  reduce  the  future  financial  burden  of  meeting  its  debt \nobligations. The existing Financial Management Act defines the general principles of managing \ngovernment finances but does not contain provisions for debt management. The amendment to \nthe act will therefore incorporate key components of the debt management policy. \n \nThe budget targets set under subprogram 1, and implemented under subprogram 2, are \n16. \nto be achieved through the actions of outputs 2 and 3, which are designed to restrain recurrent \nexpenditure and increase tax revenue. The medium-term direction underlying the program is an \nincrease  in  the  budget  surplus  to  5%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  by  FY2016,  as \nrecommended by the IMF (footnote 6). \n \n17. \nOutput 2: Cabinet enforces restraint on recurrent expenditure. Under subprogram 1, \nthe  CAP  Advisory  Group  prepared  an  independent  review  of  public  expenditure.  The  cabinet \nendorsed the CAP Advisory Group report and the actions recommended by the group to restrain \nrecurrent  expenditure.  These  included  removing  funding  for  50  vacant  positions  in  the  civil \nservice;  reducing  compensation  paid  to  landowners  for  MEC\u2019s  access  to  their  land;  and \nreducing the government's administrative expenditure on housing leases and rentals, electricity, \nwater,  communications,  vehicles,  fuel,  and  professional  services.  In  addition,  a  freeze  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s wage and salary bill, compensation paid to members of the Parliament (Nitijela), \nand  housing  allowances  for  public  officials,  was  recommended  by  the  CAP  Advisory  Group. \n\n \n\n\fthe \n\nindependent  assessment  of \n\nSubprogram 1 also supported workforce audits in three major ministries\u2014education, health, and \npublic works\u2014to guide efforts to raise the productivity of the civil service.11 \n \n18. \nUnder subprogram 2, these expenditure targets were to be met through the FY2011 and \nFY2012  budgets.  The  government  made  general  across-the-board  cuts  to  expenditure  in \nFY2010  (5.0%),  FY2011  (5.5%),  and  FY2012  (budgeted  expenditure  maintained  at  FY2011 \nlevels),  rather  than  adopting  the  targeted  cuts  as  originally  envisaged  by  the  Advisory  Group; \nhowever,  this  approach  resulted  in  the  majority  of  targets  being  met.  Subprogram 2  also \nextends  the  workforce  audits  to  five  more  ministries  and  agencies\u2014finance,  foreign  affairs, \ninternal  affairs,  attorney-general\u2019s  office,  and  resources  and  development\u2014as  well  as  the \nNitijela,  and  begins  actions  to  implement  the  findings  in  conjunction  with  the  Public  Service \nCommission. \n \nOutput  3:  Ministry  of  Finance  increases  tax  revenue.  Under  subprogram 1,  the \n19. \nTRAM  Commission  completed  an \ntax  system  and \nrecommended  actions  to  increase  tax  revenue.  The  cabinet  endorsed  both  the  report  and  the \nrecommendations. \n \n20. \nSubprogram  2  requires  implementation  of  the  tax  reforms  as  recommended  by  the \nTRAM Commission. The commission recommended replacing an array of existing taxes with a \nmodern  tax  regime  that  has  higher  revenue  potential.  The  proposed  new  taxes  are  a \nconsumption tax, an excise tax for certain goods (such as alcohol and fuel), a net profit tax for \nlarge businesses, and a modified wages and salaries tax. These will replace hotel taxes, import \nduties,  various  local  taxes,  and  gross  revenue  taxes  (except  those  on  small  businesses).  The \nnew taxes are designed to reduce distortions facing producers and consumers. The commission \nalso recommended changes to the income tax by removing exemptions and adopting a tax-free \nthreshold  to  reduce  its  regressive  aspects,  and  to  improve  tax  administration  by  unifying  tax \nadministration, strengthening tax audits, and harmonizing tax collection processes. \n \n21. \nThe  Pacific  Financial  Technical  Assistance  Centre  has  been  providing  support  to  the \ngovernment  in  this  area.  Under  subprogram  2,  legislation  was  introduced  into  Parliament  in \nSeptember 2012. The Australian Agency for International Development has recruited an advisor \nfor MOF (Division of Customs, Treasury, Revenue and Taxation) to successfully implement the \nreforms over a 2-year period. Actions under way to improve tax administration focus on tax-filing \nassistance and tax payment, audit and investigations, objections and appeals, management of \ndelinquent taxpayers, and considering more efficient information technology systems. The level \nof  taxpayer  noncompliance  is  high,  and  relatively  simple  efforts  to  improve  tax  filing  and \npayment should yield solid revenue gains.12 \n \n22. \nRaising  compliance  through  more  rigorous  tax  administration  is  expected  to  generate \nmost  of  the  additional  tax  revenue  targeted  under  the  program,  as  the  new  taxes  should  be \nlargely revenue-neutral for existing taxpayers in the short-term. The medium-term target is to lift \nthe ratio of taxes to GDP to 16.2% in FY2015, from 14.3% in FY2011, as the IMF recommended. \n \nOutput  4:  Selected  state-owned  enterprises  improve  their  performance.

The  cabinet  and  the  MEC  board  endorsed  debt  restructuring  for \nMEC, and the MEC board endorsed the establishment of a maintenance account to hold funds \nset aside for maintenance. \n \n24. \nSubprogram 2 provides for annual public reporting on SOE performance, the adoption of \nan  SOE  policy,  the  introduction  of  an  SOE  act  in  Parliament,  the  continued  implementation  of \nthe MEC comprehensive recovery plan, and the implementation of MEC's debt restructuring and \nmaintenance  account.  Time-bound  recovery  plans,  based  on  the  application  of  good  practice \nprinciples, have been prepared under subprogram 2 for other SOEs. \n \nThe  SOE  policy  confirms  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  10  good  practice  principles \n25. \nfor the management and operation of SOEs, adopted under subprogram 1, and covers the role \nof the responsible minister, the principle objective for the operation of SOEs, community service \nobligations, governance, and accountability requirements. The key components of the policy will \nbe  incorporated  into  an SOE  act.  Also  under  subprogram  2,  strategic  reform  plans  have been \nprepared  for  the  Majuro  Water  and  Sewer  Company,  Marshall  Islands  Shipping  Corporation, \nand Tobolar Copra Processing Authority, and action is under way to implement the plans.14 \n \nThe  MEC  comprehensive  recovery  plan  includes  actions  to  (i)  improve  corporate \n26. \ngovernance  through  reconstitution  of  the  board,  (ii)  improve  procurement  and  financial \nmanagement,  (iii)  align  tariffs  to  reflect  costs,  (iv)  reduce  system  losses,  (v)  improve  billing \nthrough  prepaid  metering  and  more  rigorous  collection,  (vi)  raise  the  efficiency  of  fuel  usage, \n(vii) reduce  nonessential  expenditure,  and  (viii)  overhaul  the  main  generators  and  other  major \nequipment (footnote 8). MEC's debt restructuring has three elements: (i) replacing a sovereign-\nguaranteed  loan  from  the  Bank  of  Guam  with  a  concessional  loan  from  the  government, \n(ii) deferring principal repayments on an existing loan from the Rural Utilities Service of the US \nDepartment of Agriculture, and (iii) establishing a debt-servicing sinking fund. \n \n27. \nOutput  5:  Cabinet  ensures  effective  stakeholder  participation  in  public  sector \nreforms.  A  consultation  and  participation  program  was  started  under  subprogram  1,  and  has \nbeen  ongoing  under  subprogram  2.  Project  preparatory  TA  under  subprogram  1  assisted  the \ngovernment  in  carrying  out  public  consultation,  bringing  together  stakeholders  from  the \ngovernment,  civil  society  organizations,  academia,  the  private  sector,  and  youth  groups  in  six \nsessions.15 Open  debate  on  a  wide  range  of  issues  yielded  significant  information,  opinions, \ninsights,  ideas,  and  recommendations.  All  consultations  were  bilingual.  Each  session  covered \nthe economy, fiscal and economic trends and outlook, and policy options and actions. A strong \nconsensus  emerged  on  key  points  related  to  ongoing  economic  difficulties,  the  necessity  of \nadopting serious reforms to deal with imbalances, and the imperative that the cabinet take the \nlead in this reform process. \n \n28. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  government  has  sought  to  strengthen  engagement  with \ndevelopment  partners  to  support  its  reform  program.

The meeting gave the government a forum to present its public sector program. \nIt  discussed  the  RMI\u2019s  reform  and  development  progress  and  priorities,  which  included \nexpenditure  reforms,  tax  and  revenue  reforms,  energy  sector  reforms,  and  SOE  performance \nand reform needs. The joint communiqu\u00e9 acknowledged that continued public outreach efforts \nwill be an important ingredient to successful implementation of the program.16 \n \nStakeholder  consultation  has  been  ongoing  since  the  approval  of  subprogram  1, \n29. \nparticularly around tax and SOE reform. In March 2012, ADB also approved TA with a provision \nto support a second development partners\u2019 meeting, once scheduled by the government.17 \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n30. \nThe government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR3,242,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 24-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement. \n \nThe  loan  size  was  determined  after  consideration  of  (i)  the  government\u2019s  FY2013 \n31. \nfinancing needs, including the required contribution to the Compact trust fund that is intended to \ngenerate  a  revenue  stream  to  replace  Compact  grants  in  FY2024;  (ii)  the  significance  and \ncomplexity  of  the  policy  actions  of  the  program,  and  the  budgetary  resources  required  to \nimplement the program successfully; (iii) the conformity of the program with ADB\u2019s COBP for the \nRMI;  and  (iv)  direct  budget  support  being  provided  by  other  development  partners.  The \ndetermination  of  the  loan  size  also  took  into  account  the  government\u2019s  demonstrated \ncommitment  to  implementing  the  program,  as  evidenced  by  the  development  policy  letter \n(Appendix 3). \n \n32. \nADB\u2019s COBP for the RMI.18 \n \nE. \n\nThe  proposed  loan  size  is  within  the  established  lending  allocation,  and  is  included  in \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n33.  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  overseeing  all  policy, \nlegal, and regulatory actions to be undertaken in connection with the program; and (ii) ensuring \nthat  all  policy  reforms  set  out  in  the  policy  matrix  are  duly  carried  out  in  a  timely  manner \n(Appendix  4).  MOF  will  also  be  responsible  for  program  administration,  disbursements,  and \nmaintenance  of  all  program  records.

Manila (TA 8061-RMI, for $225,000, approved on 20 March 2012). \n\n18 The RMI received an ADF allocation of $2.46 million for 2012,  and it is proposed to bring forward  the provisional \n\n2013 and 2014 allocations ($1.29 million each) so that subprogram 2 can be funded entirely from ADF. \n\n19 25  August  2009  was  the  date  of  the  approval  of  the  project  preparatory  TA  (footnote  15).  The  subprogram 2 \n\nimplementation period began on 7 June 2011 (the day after approval of subprogram 1). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fmonitoring  efforts  will  continue  through  2013.  Ongoing  TA  activities  have  been  supporting  the \ngovernment in meeting the policy actions, and these will continue beyond loan effectiveness.20 \n \n34. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single tranche  and  in  accordance  with \nthe  provisions  of  ADB's  Simplification of  Disbursement  Procedures  and Related  Requirements \nfor Program Loans.21 \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n35. \nThe  primary  gain  from  the  program  in  the  medium  term  will  be  improved  fiscal \nsustainability  of  the  government,  as  measured  by  the  Compact  trust  fund  being  on  track  to \nreplace Compact grants when they expire in FY2024. The IMF assessment letter is accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n36. \nThe government\u2019s ability to implement its budget as approved is integral to the success \nof  the  program.  The  general  quality  and  comprehensiveness  of  the  RMI  budget  has  improved \nsince  2009,  with  the  incorporation  of  previously  off-budget  allocations  into  the  main  allocation \nprocess.  The  budget  planning  and  approval  process  has  also  improved,  and  the  FY2011  and \nFY2012  budgets  were  being  prepared  largely  in  accordance  with the  set  calendar  and  budget \nschedule, in part due to support from ADB. \n \n37. \nGovernment procurement is undertaken in accordance with the Procurement Code (Act), \n1988 and applies to expenditure of public funds irrespective of their source by the government. \nThe code (i) aims to boost public confidence in the procedures followed in public procurement; \n(ii)  ensures  the  fair  and  equitable  treatment  of  all  persons  who  deal  with  the  procurement \nsystem  of  the  government;  and  (iii) applies  greater  economy  to  government  procurement \nactivities, and maximizes the purchasing value of public funds of the government. Procurement \nrisks under the program are considered low. \n \n38. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MOF.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the program. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan  agreement.  These  measures  will  complement  the  actions  under  way  to  improve financial \naccountability  and  anticorruption  measures,  which  are  being  put  in  place  by  the  government \nwith the support of its development partners. \n \n\n                                                \n20 ADB. 2010.

First,  better  fiscal \nmanagement  will  reduce fiscal  deficits;  improve the  capacity to deal  with external  shocks;  and \ncreate a foundation for sustainable, equitable, and inclusive pro-poor economic growth. Second, \nrevenue enhancement will enable the government to make transfers to the Compact trust fund, \nallowing a smooth transition to the post-Compact era, which could otherwise create social and \neconomic tension as public expenditure and employment shrink and as poverty and deprivation \nworsen.  Third,  improving  the  efficiency  of  SOEs,  especially  MEC,  will  reduce  the  burden  that \ncash transfers place on the budget, and make additional resources available for development.22 \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n40. \nThe  subprogram  is  classified  as  category  C  for  environment,  resettlement,  and \nindigenous  people.  No  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  have  been  identified.  No \ninvoluntary resettlement or impact on indigenous people is expected. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n41. \nThe potential benefits from undertaking fiscal and structural reforms to improve the long-\nterm  fiscal  sustainability  of  the  RMI  government  are  considered  to  outweigh  the  risks.  Indeed, \nthe cost of inaction could be substantial\u2014a continued low growth rate, with implications for the \ngovernment\u2019s ability to fund basic social services and transition to the post-Compact era. Major \nrisks  and  mitigating measures  are  summarized  in Table  3  and  detailed  in the  risk  assessment \nand risk management plan.23 \n \n\nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe government\u2019s capacity to \neffectively implement reforms \nmay prove insufficient. \n\nMitigating Measures \nOngoing technical assistance activities have been supporting the \ngovernment in meeting the policy actions, and these will continue \nbeyond loan effectiveness. \n\nThe current pace of reform may \nnot be sustained if political \nsupport is lost or the cabinet is \nunable to make the required \ndecisions. The risk is that the \nreform program may stall or the \nprogress made by the \ngovernment to improve fiscal \ndiscipline may be reversed. \n\nCommunity demand for the program was built through the holding of \npublic symposia during subprogram 1. A strong consensus emerged \non key points related to the RMI\u2019s ongoing economic difficulties, the \nnecessity of adopting serious reform measures to deal with \nimbalances, and the imperative that the cabinet and Parliament take \nthe lead in this reform process. Consultation has been ongoing, \nincluding a development partners' meeting held by the government in \nDecember 2010. \n\n                                                \n22 In addition, ADB has two projects with a poverty-reduction focus in RMI: ADB. 2010. Proposed Grant Assistance to \nthe Cook Islands, Marshall Islands, and Tonga for Social Protection of the Vulnerable in the Pacific. Manila (Grant \n9151-REG, approved on 13 September 2010 for $3,000,000 financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction); \nand ADB. 2010.

Yet revenues \nneed to be raised in the short-\nto-medium term if the RMI is to \nreach a level whereby the \nannual budget can sustainably \n(i) cover recurrent costs fully, \n(ii) provide a realistic amount of \nfunds for annual one-off items, \nand (iii) provide sufficient \nsurplus to enable the \ngovernment to make the \nrequired annual contribution to \nthe Compact trust fund. \n\nMitigating Measures \nTechnical assistance by ADB and other development partners has \nbeen supporting components of the PFM system. The government \nundertook a self-assessment of its PFM system, as a precursor to a \npublic expenditure and financial accountability assessment. The \nPacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre will support the \ndevelopment of a PFM road map in November 2012. \n\nThe government is moving ahead on tax reform; however, it is \nexpected that the new taxes will be largely revenue-neutral in the short \nterm. Any potential short-term increase in revenues will come from \nmore rigorous tax administration by unifying the tax system, improving \ntax audits, and harmonizing tax collection processes. \nThe Australian Agency for International Development has recruited an \nadvisor for the Ministry of Finance (Division of Customs, Treasury, \nRevenue and Taxation) to successfully implement the reforms over a \n2-year period. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, PFM = public financial management, RMI = Republic of the Marshall Islands. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n42. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as described in detail  in  the loan \ndocuments. \n \nThe  loan  will  become  effective  only  after  the  government  has  satisfactorily  fulfilled  all \n43. \npolicy actions for the release of the single tranche of subprogram 2.
