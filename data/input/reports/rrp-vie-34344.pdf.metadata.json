The  SDPL  adopts  a  process-\noriented approach and is designed to systematically identify and \nresolve issues and constraints on business, particularly on SMEs, \nthrough  intergovernmental  coordination  and  stakeholder \nconsultation. \n \nCreation  of  an  enabling  business  environment  in  Viet  Nam  is \nchallenging due to deficiencies common to developing economies in \ntransition. Many key policy, legal, and institutional frameworks in \nsupport of business operations have yet to be completed. Also, a \npolicy bias favoring public sector entities remains. In selecting areas \nto be covered by the SDPL, priority was given to those assessed to \n                                                 \n1  Following the Board approval of the R-Paper on Review of ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy, staff instructions to \nreplace the PI/CPI classification with a new tracking system are under preparation in line with paragraph 84 of the \nR-Paper. ", "  iii\nbe (i) significant for SMEs' current business operations, (ii) backed \nby Government commitment to reform in line with best practices, (iii) \nlinked  to  ADB's  past  and  ongoing  operations,  and  (iv) \ncomplementary to activities of other aid agencies. \n \nFormulation  of  the  SDPL  is  based  on  an  in-depth  analysis  and \ndiscussions with the Government of each component over a period \nof  9  months.  In  particular,  policy  measures  proposed  under  the \nSDPL were discussed extensively with Government officials at both \nthe technical and decision-making levels, with highly technical inputs \nfrom experts in the fields of SME policy, land, leasing, registration \nsystems,  secured  transactions, and  technical  standards.  The \ndiscussions culminated in agreement with the Government on the \nobjective and expected impact of undertaking clearly defined policy \nactions, conforming to best international practices. \n \nMany measures adopted under the SDPL support the Government \nin undertaking market-friendly interventions and eliminating policy \nbias against SMEs, thus strengthening the environment for private \nsector development. Beneficiaries of such measures are expected to \ninclude the poor and the near poor. \n   \nObjective and  The objective of the SDPL is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to \nScope  create a business environment that is conducive to economic growth \nand employment generation. To achieve this objective, the SDPL \nfocuses on the following: \n \n(i)  Enhancing  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework.  (a)\nImproving the business registration and licensing systems \nby  implementing  a  uniform  and  consistent  registration \nprocedure nationwide, and streamlining business licensing \nprocedures; (b) establishing the Government\u2019s institutional \nframework for SME development, for effective monitoring \nand evaluation of the sector. Policies and programs will be \nbased on a comprehensive database on the SME sector \nand  a  coordinated  SME  development  strategy;  and  (c) \npromoting  closer  public-private  sector  partnership  and \nproviding  systems  that  make information  on  government \nregulations on enterprises easily accessible to the public.  \n \n(ii)  Improving SMEs\u2019 access to resources (finance and land \nuse rights). (a) Reducing the costs and risks of lending to \nSMEs  by  developing  an  SME  accounting  system; \nestablishing  land  registration  and  valuation  methods  to \nimprove the use of land-use rights certificates as collateral; \nand supporting the use of movable properties as collateral\nthrough  a  functioning  secured  transactions  registry;  (b) \nimproving the operational environment of financial leasing \ncompanies by expanding the types of leasing products and \ndiversifying their funding source; and (c) completing legal \nand institutional frameworks for market-based transactions ", "iv   \non land by establishing the legal basis for issuance of land-\nuse  rights  certificates,  making  information  on  land \naccessible to the public, and promoting good governance in \nadministrative procedures.  \n \n(iii)  Facilitating  SMEs\u2019  access  to  international  markets \n(industrial/technical  standards).  Lowering  the  structural \nbarrier on industrial and technical standards for SMEs by (a) \ncompleting the legal framework on industrial and technical \nstandards,  (b)  undertaking  institutional  reforms  of \ncertification  bodies  and  ensuring  SME  representation  in \nsetting standards, and (c) making information on standards\nreadily available to the public. \n \nThe Program framework is in Appendix 1. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The SDPL adopts the program cluster approach with two back-to-\nback subprograms totaling $100 million. Subprogram I loan amount \nwill be for $60 million and subprogram II will be processed upon the \nsuccessful completion of subprogram I. \n \nSubprogram I of SDPL will be drawn from the Asian Development \nFund, which will have a repayment period of 24 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, and carry an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \nSubprogram  I  will  be  implemented  within  18  months  after  loan \neffectiveness. \n \nSubprogram II will be presented for Board consideration, based on \nprogress  in  implementing  subprogram  I.  Policy  conditions  for \nsubprogram II are subject to revision to reflect the Government\u2019s \nachievements and changing policy environment. Subprograms II will \nbe implemented within 18 months after loan effectiveness. \n   \nProgram Period and   The  program  cluster  comprises  two  programs  and  subprogram  I \nTranching  comprises two tranches. The period for implementing subprogram I \nwill be 18 months from loan effectiveness. The first tranche will be \nreleased upon compliance with the first tranche release conditions \nand  the  second  upon  completion  of  policy  actions  proposed  for \nsecond tranche release. Implementation of subprogram I is planned \nfor November 2004 to May 2006. The final review for subprogram I, \nsecond tranche release, is expected to coincide with subprogram II \nloan fact-finding.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) will be the Executing \nAgency for the SDPL.  \n   \nProcurement  The proceeds of the SDPL will be disbursed for a broad range of \nimports, subject to a negative list of ineligible items. All procurement \nof goods and services produced in and originating from member \ncountries of ADB will be made with due consideration to economy ", "  v\nand efficiency in accordance with standard public sector procedures \nin  Viet  Nam  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices, \nacceptable to ADB. The Borrower will certify that the value of total \nimports minus (i) imports from nonmember countries, (ii) ineligible \nimports,  and  (iii)  disbursements  made  under  other  official \ndevelopment assistance, is greater than the amount expected to be \ndisbursed during the year. ADB will have the right to audit the use of \nthe  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Borrower's \ncertification. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The policy framework for the SDPL includes specific components \nthat bear distinct costs of structural adjustments. The Government \nhas  provided  assurances  that  necessary funding  will  be  made \navailable to cover these costs. \n   \nImplementation  To  coordinate  program  implementation  among  government \nArrangements  ministries and agencies concerned, a program steering committee \n(PSC) will be formed. The PSC, chaired by a deputy minister of MPI, \nwill  comprise  senior  officers  from  all  ministries  and  government \nagencies  concerned (Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources and Environment, Ministry of Science and Technology, \nMinistry of Justice, and State Bank of Viet Nam). The PSC will meet \nat least twice a year to review pending issues and propose concrete \nactions for their resolution to ensure timely program implementation.\n   \nTechnical Assistance  The Government has requested ADB to provide TA for capacity \nbuilding  for  SME  development  for  $1.4  million.  The  TA  will  be \nfinanced  by  ADB  ($500,000),  Danish  Consultancy  Trust  Fund \n($300,000) and Swiss Consultant Trust Fund ($600,000), in support \nof SDPL implementation. The TA will focus on (i) technical, legal, \nand  policy-related  assistance  to  the  reform  agenda  based  on \ninternational experience; (ii) institution-building activities, including \nfostering good governance and pilot implementation of new systems; \nand (iii) new approaches to training and information dissemination.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  There are three principal risks in implementing the SDPL. The first is \nin  effective  coordination  and  cooperation  within  the  Government, \nboth  horizontally  among  different  ministries  and  agencies \nconcerned, and vertically with the provincial and district authorities. \nConsultation and coordination with the private sector and the aid \ncommunity active in SME development will also be required. It is \nexpected that coordination and cooperation among all stakeholders \nwill  gradually  improve  along  with  the  increased  capacity  of  the \nAgency for SME Development within the MPI, thus reducing the risk \nof overlap and inconsistencies in SME support activities.  \n \nA second risk pertains to good governance of the central, provincial,\nand district governments. Governance at the provincial and district \nlevels is particularly important given the fact that the positive impact \nof the SDPL will be felt only through effective implementation of \npolicies at the ground level. These risks are common to several ", "vi   \nprograms and are being addressed through the implementation of \nthe comprehensive Public Administration Reform Master Program \nfor 2001\u20132010, which is being supported by ADB. \n \nA  third  risk  relates  to  the  technical  capacities  of  implementing \nagencies.  Experience  suggests  that, given  adequate  technical \nsupport,  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  reforms  is  strong.  In \nimplementing  previous  programs,  delays  were  caused \npredominantly by the lack of technical expertise and the consensus \nbuilding approach taken in enactment of laws and regulations. To \nreduce this risk, the TA has been formulated through discussions \nwith  all  implementing  agencies  at  the  technical  level.  Many \nrequirements pertain to completing the legal framework and putting \nin place modern information technology-based systems, taking into \nconsideration the experience of other countries. The SDPL will also \ninvolve coordination with aid agencies active in the respective areas \nof each component.  \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram  cluster  concept  for  the  Small  and  Medium-sized  Enterprise  (SME)  Development \nProgram Loan (SDPL), and (ii) a proposed loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for \nsubprogram I of the SDPL. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for \nCapacity Building for SME Development, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve (i) Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) administering a portion of the TA not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 and $600,000 \nto  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Government  of  Denmark  and  the  Government  of \nSwitzerland, respectively; and (ii) ADB providing the balance of the TA, not exceeding the \nequivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  Viet Nam is a country of about 80 million people, the majority (approximately 76%) of \nwhom live in rural areas. Although still one of the poorest countries in the region, Viet Nam has \nmade steady progress toward adoption of a market-oriented economy (through Doi Moi or \neconomic renovation since 1986) and has achieved rapid economic growth. Viet Nam\u2019s average \ngross domestic product (GDP) growth rate (7.7%) during the 1990s marked the second fastest \ngrowth in the region, after the People\u2019s Republic of China (10.1%).1 In 2003, Viet Nam posted a \nGDP growth of 7.1%. Per capita GDP increased from $361 in 1997 to $426 in 2002 (Table 1). \nAlthough  the  share  of  foreign  direct  investment  to  GDP  declined  recently,  exports  have \ncontinued to rise. Gross domestic savings and capital formation also increased during the \nperiod.   \n \nTable 1: Basic Economic Indicators \n \nItem  1997 1999 2000 2001 2002  2003\nPopulation  74.3 million 76.6 million  77.6 million  78.7 million 79.7 million  80.9 million\nGDP per Capita  $361 $369.2 $395.5 $403.8 $426.0  454.8b\nGDP Growtha  8.2 4.7 6.1 5.8 6.4  7.1\n   Agriculture (%)  25.8 25.4 24.5 23.2 23.0  21.8\n   Industry (%)  32.1 34.5 36.7 38.1 38.5  40.0\n   Service (%)  42.2 40.1 38.7 38.6 38.5  38.2\nExchange Rate (D per $1)   11,683 13,944   14,168   14,800 15,280  15,732\nExport ($ million)    9,185 11,541 14,448 15,029 16,706  20,176\nImport ($ million)   10,432 11,742 15,637 16,218 19,745  25,227\nLabor Force (million)      34.5   36.0     36.7     37.7 40.5  41.2\n   Agriculture (million)     23.6   24.1     24.3     24.5 23.3  23.1\n   Industry (million)       2.9     3.1       3.2       3.3 4.2  4.6\n   Service (million)       7.8     8.6       9.0       9.7 12.7  13.2\nGDP = gross domestic product. \na Refers to annual percentage change. \nb Staff estimate. \nSource: ADB. 2004. Key Economic Indicators \u2013 Viet Nam (www.adb.org/statistics); \n  IMF. 2003. Viet Nam: Country Report - Statistical Appendix. Washington, D.C. \n \n3.  One of the most striking features of Viet Nam\u2019s rapid growth is the rise in the industry \nsector. Industry is now a leading sector, and between 1997 and 2003 grew by 8% in terms of \n                                                 \n1  In comparison, the world average during the period was about 2.7%, while the average for the low-income \ncountries was about 3.3%.  ", "2    \nthe share of GDP. The export of manufactured goods has also increased although commodities \n(such as crude oil, rice, and coffee) are still the leading exports. It is important to note that the \nrise in industry sector has not increased employment in the sector. Agriculture, despite its recent \ndecline, remains the top employer of the Vietnamese labor force.     \n \nTable 2: Comparison by Economic Sectors in 2002 \n \n      Foreign \nState-Owned  Private \nInvestment \nSector  Sector \nSector \nShare of GDP (%)   39        48   13 \n2002 Annual GDP (industrial) Growth Rate    12        20  14 \nShare of Total Investment    52        29  19 \nShare of Employmenta  10         89b   1 \nEstimated Number of Companies   5,200  90,000c 3,000 \n   Of which are SMEs   3,000     85,000  0 \nGDP = gross domestic product, SME = small and medium-sized enterprise.  \na  Statistics for 2001.  \nb  Of the 89%, it is estimated that about 70% comes from household enterprises. \nc In addition, it is estimated that there are 40,000 cooperatives, 2.4 million household enterprises, and 13,000 \nagricultural farms (enterprises). \nSource: Data provided by the Ministry of Planning and Investment. \n \n4.  The  Government  has  had  an  active  privatization  program,  but  the  economy  is  still \ndominated by the state sector, which accounted for 39% of output and for over 50% of total \ninvestment  in  2002  (Table  2).  Furthermore,  while  the  foreign  investment  sector  has  been \nimportant  for  Viet  Nam\u2019s  growth,  it  is  the  domestic  private  sector  that  has  led  economic \ndevelopment since 2000, with an annual growth rate of almost 20% (18.7% in 2003). For the \ndomestic private sector to continue its growth, however, the Government will need to accelerate \nits efforts in establishing an enabling business environment in Viet Nam. \n  \n5.  The macroeconomic outlook for Viet Nam is generally favorable. The ADB projects GDP \ngrowth of 7.5% for 2004 and 7.6% for 2005. Although macroeconomic performance has been \nfavorable, restructuring the state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector is considered critical to sustain \nthe high growth rates of recent years. Furthermore, maintaining macroeconomic stability and a \nrelatively high level of economic growth rate would be a requisite for achieving the development \ngoals  outlined  in  the  10-year  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP) 2   and  the \nComprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS).  \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR \nA.  Sector Description and Analysis \n6.  SMEs are defined as businesses and production establishments that have a registered \ncapital of less than D10 billion (about $670,000) or an average number of annual permanent \nemployees of less than 300, or both. It is estimated that more than 90% of all private enterprises \nare SMEs.   \n \n7.  It has been estimated that about 90,000 formal private SMEs currently operating in Viet \nNam have been registered in accordance with the Enterprise Law. Of the 736,000 enterprises \n                                                 \n2  SEDP was approved by the 9th Party Congress in April 2001. ", "    3 \n(including  household  enterprises)  registered  in  all  sectors  as  of  31  December  2002, \napproximately  648,000  were  small  and  household  enterprises  without  tax  codes.  Of  the \nenterprises with tax codes, 84,731 had a registered capital of less than D10 billion while 85,169 \nhad less than 300 employees. Thus, on both criteria of registered capital and average number \nof employees, SMEs account for over 99.6% of the total number of registered enterprises. Even \nwhen  household  enterprises  are excluded,  it  can  be  deduced  that more  than  90%  of  the \ncompanies  registered  under  the  Enterprise  Law  are  SMEs.

To better identify the major challenges, as well as to define priorities and chart varied \nassistance of other aid agencies in the SME sector, TA 4031-VIE3 undertook formulation of a \ncomprehensive road map for SME development in Viet Nam. A summary of the road map is in \nAppendix  3.  First,  in  preparing  the  road  map,  a  number  of  surveys  were  reviewed,  and \ndiscussions were held with the SMEs, private sector representatives, Government officials, as \nwell as other stakeholders to understand their perception of the major priorities for the sector. \nSecond, a comprehensive review was undertaken to discuss the status of current reforms and \nmajor development plans of the Government. Third, aid activities were studied so as to avoid \noverlaps and to seek synergies where possible.   \n \n9.  Through these steps, a comprehensive diagnostic analysis was produced to identify the \nmajor constraints in the sector. The road map emphasizes the importance of an enabling \nbusiness environment and the need for comprehensive legal and institutional development for \nViet Nam. The road map categorizes the main issues in three interrelated areas:  \n \n(i)  business  regulatory  environment,  covering  the  creation  of  an  appropriate \npolicy, legal, and regulatory framework for enterprises; \n \n(ii)  access to resources, dealing with enterprises' access to essential resources,  \nincluding infrastructure, human, and financial resources in particular; and \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2002. Preparing SME Development Program. Manila (approved for $650,000 on 13 December 2002). ", "4    \n(iii)  enterprise support, addressing methodologies in support of SMEs\u2019 efforts for \ncapacity building, including access to domestic and foreign markets. \n \n10.  In addition to numerous roundtable discussions with Government agencies, the road \nmap was presented to the private sector and all aid agencies active in SME development in \nworkshops  held  in  September  and  December  2003  in  Hanoi,  Viet  Nam.  Feedback  and \ncomments  from  participants  have  been  incorporated  in  the  final  road  map.  With  its \ncomprehensive policy recommendations for mid- to long-term development of SMEs, the road \nmap is expected to be the basis for the long-term, interministerial action program for SME \ndevelopment to be adopted by the Government.   \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n1.  Key Issues \n11.  Based on the analysis of the road map and consultations with stakeholders, key issues \nfor SME development in Viet Nam have been identified.  \n \n12.  Incomplete and Inconsistent Business Registration and Licensing Systems. The \nEnterprise Law of 2000 promoted business registration and significantly reduced the time, cost \nand documentation for starting a business. After the enactment of the Enterprise Law, however, \nmore than 50 implementing guidelines were issued on the registration and licensing process at \ndifferent provincial and district levels. Also, 10 decrees containing provisions contradicting the \nEnterprise Law have been identified. Further complicating the process is the inconsistent new \nprovisions  for  simplified  business  registration,  with  some  provinces  not  approving  the \nestablishment of businesses permitted under the law. Both business registration and licensing \nsystems are not unified on a national basis, nullifying many of the benefits of the Enterprise \nLaw. Many SMEs still suffer from inconsistent and inefficient business registration and licensing \nsystems; thus, compliance costs are increasing. \n \n13.  Absence  of  SME  Development  Policy  and  Coordination  Framework.  Although \nimportant progress has been made, the basic framework to support SME development is still \nincomplete, in both policies and institutions. This lack of a policy and coordination framework \nhas  resulted  in  contradictions  and  duplications  of  support  programs  provided  by  different \nGovernment ministries and agencies. It also constrains effective aid coordination. Furthermore, \nthere is no specific system for collecting data on the sector for purposes of policy formulation. \nProgress to date in upgrading the National Business Information Network (NBIN)4 has been \nlimited, and there are currently no mechanisms to provide information to and collect information \nfrom SMEs.   \n \n14.  Limited Access to Financial Resources. Viet Nam\u2019s financial sector still perceives \nfinancing for SMEs to be costly and highly risky. Hence, SMEs\u2019 access to financial resources is \nlimited despite the fact that various aid agencies have a number of credit lines for the sector. \nPriority must be given to developing a more sustainable system for SME financing by reducing \nthe costs and risks related to giving credit to SMEs. First, recognizing that offering collateral \nremains an important means for SMEs to access credit, the limited access to land-use rights \ncertificates (LURCs) for use as collateral must be overcome. For SMEs to better utilize the \n                                                 \n4  The NBIN was established through the Enterprise Law. Its aim is to collect information electronically on the \nenterprises through their registration. However, NBIN covers only about 30% of Viet Nam, and thus much of the \nneeded information remains unrecorded.   ", "    5 \ncertificates as collateral, the legal and administrative framework for the issuance of LURCs \nneeds to be improved. The registration of any subsequent transactions or exercise of land use \nrights (as immovable property) must be streamlined and made uniform throughout the country, \nwith an appropriate system to maintain records. The price valuation method of land also needs \nto be updated to give banks a better basis for pricing the collateral.5 For movable properties, an \neffective secured transactions registry, which clearly establishes the prioritization of creditors' \nand lien holders' rights upon registering their interest will facilitate SMEs\u2019 access to credit.    \n \n15.  Second, lack of collateral is compounded by lack of financial information on SMEs.  The \nfinancial reporting requirements are overly complex for SMEs. For example, the balance sheets \nand income statements for SMEs are comparable with those of large enterprises. Furthermore, \nthere are currently 25 accounting books and 39 supporting documents applicable to SMEs. \nThere  is  a  need  to  develop  a  more  simplified,  publicly  recognized,  and  uniformly  applied \naccounting system for SMEs. Finally, leasing can be an effective substitute for secured lending \nand can mitigate the higher risk of providing medium-term financing to small companies that \nlack business track records and audited financial statements. Shortcomings in the Vietnamese \nlegal and policy framework for leasing limit product offerings and restrict funding sources. \nAmendments to the legal framework will give leasing companies more freedom in both product \noffering and sources of funding.  \n \n16.  Limited Access to Physical Resource: Land Use. Among various forms of physical \nresource,  land  use  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the  most  significant  barriers  to  SME \ndevelopment in Viet Nam. The Vietnamese legislative framework for land is complex.6 There is \nno single land use registry covering the whole country and registration is a time-consuming \nprocess involving central, provincial and district authorities. As a result, most SMEs resort to \nleasing land from SOEs.  \n  \n17.  Limited Access to International Markets: Technical Standards. Although Viet Nam \nwill enter the World Trade Organization (WTO) regime and the SMEs will have greater access \nto foreign markets, many barriers must be overcome for the SMEs to fully capitalize on this \nopportunity.  Regardless  of  WTO\u2019s  mandates  on  tariff  and  other  means  to  seek  trade \nliberalization, Vietnamese exports need to conform to various technical standards before they \ncan  enter  foreign  markets.  Currently,  significant  gaps  exist  in  the  legislative  framework \nsurrounding both product quality and standardization and in the system for obtaining information \non standards or how to comply with them.   \n \n18.  The key issues identified above stem from fundamental and structural impediments that \nconfront  the  Vietnamese  economy  today.  First,  the  lack  of  basic  economic  and  business \ninfrastructure required for efficient functioning of a market-based economy, such as accounting \nstandards  (which  are  being  developed)  and  a  centralized  land  registry,  makes  SME \ndevelopment  exceptionally  challenging.  Second,  the  bias  toward  SOEs  causes  market \ndistortions, often creating competitive disadvantages for private sector SMEs, although recent \nofficial policy directions from the Government and the Communist Party have clearly stated that \nall enterprises should be treated equally. Third, in addition to key legal reforms and institutional \ndevelopments, limited provision of important information from and to SMEs is a significant \nbarrier to SME development. \n                                                 \n5 The price valuation currently administered by local people\u2019s committees does not take into consideration the actual \nmarket transactions of land.   \n6\n A significant improvement in reducing the complexity of the legislative framework will be achieved with the \npromulgation of the new Land Law (2003), effective July 2004. ", "6    \n2.  Government Objectives and Strategy \n19.  The Government's development goals and poverty reduction targets are stated in the \nSEDP, various sector strategies, and the CPRGS. The CPRGS targets reduction of poverty \nincidence by approximately 12 percentage points between 2001 and 2010 through increased \nefficiency in resource use, social progress and equity in income distribution, and development of \ncorruption-free and efficient state functions.  \n  \n20.  Communist  Party  Resolution  14/NQ-TW  (2002)  and  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Decision \n94/2002/QD-TTg  (2002)  formally  recognized  the  private  sector  as  an  important  pillar  for \neconomic development and employment generation. Private sector SMEs are viewed as the \nmain source of employment generation for the 1.5 million new entrants to the labor market \nannually to 2010. Furthermore, as more SMEs become formal, tax-paying enterprises, their \ncontributions to government revenues are also expected to become significant.   \n \n21.  To support the private sector, the Government issued Decree 90/2001/ND-CP\u2013\u2013Support \nfor Development of SMEs (Decree 90)\u2013\u2013in November 2001 and officially recognized SMEs for \nthe first time in Viet Nam. Decree 90 provides a framework for the Government to support and \nencourage private sector development and covers the establishment of (i) an SME Promotion \nCouncil with cross-ministry membership to act as an advisory body to the Prime Minister, and \n(ii) the Agency for SME Development in the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) to \ncoordinate SME-related activities. \n \n22.  To further support Government initiatives for private sector development, the SDPL \nprovides  assistance  for  (i)  completing  the  supporting  legal  and  policy  frameworks;  (ii) \nestablishing  efficient  mechanisms  for  coordination  among  various  government  ministries, \nagencies, and other stakeholders including the private sector; and (iii) effectively implementing \ncurrent legal and policy measures at the central, provincial, and local levels.     \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank's Strategy and Operations in the Sector \n23.  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program (CSP) (2002\u20132004) for Viet Nam7 reiterates the \nimportance of achieving sustainable growth to realize the overarching goal of poverty reduction. \nPreliminary data from the 2002 Multipurpose Household Survey show a decline in poverty \nincidence from 37% in 1998 to 29% in 2002 using an international poverty line.8 To support the \ncontinuation  of  the  country's  path  toward  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  ADB's \noperational strategy is committed to developing a vibrant private sector in Viet Nam through (i) \npromotion of agricultural diversification, (ii) establishment of an enabling business environment \nfor SMEs, and (iii) development of alternative channels of financial intermediation to banks. The \nSDPL is consistent with ADB's operational priorities and strategic focus for Viet Nam.  \n \n24.  In its past operations, ADB has provided several credit lines for SMEs, particularly in \nconjunction with agricultural development projects and programs. Also, the SOE Reform and \nCorporate Governance Program Loan (SCPL)9 initiated policy dialogues with the Government \non  developing  a  dynamic  private  sector.  The  SDPL  builds  on  achievements  of  ADB \ninterventions by making a number of important linkages to previous and ongoing programs. \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2002. Viet Nam: Country Strategy and Program. Manila (approved on 17 January 2002). \n8  Poverty had fallen 21 percentage points, from 58% to 37% during the previous 5-year period. \n9  ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grants to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the State-owned Enterprise Reform and \nCorporate Governance Program Loan. Manila (approved on 21 December 1999 for $100 million).  ", "    7 \nSpecifically, the SDPL will ensure that the Enterprise Law, which was a core policy action under \nSCPL, is effectively implemented, business registration systems streamlined, and licensing \nprocedures  simplified.  The  SDPL  also  builds  on  the  enhanced  role  and  capacity  of  the \nVietnamese Accounting Association, supported under the Second Financial Sector Program \nLoan (FSPL II),10 for disseminating information on a simplified SME accounting system and \nproviding training programs to SMEs.  \n \n4.  External Assistance to the Sector \n25.  External assistance to SMEs in Viet Nam started in the mid-1990s. It is estimated that \nthere are over 60 recent or current initiatives in the sector. In addition to ADB, major multilateral \nfunding agencies active in SME development include the European Union (EU), International \nFinance  Corporation,  International  Labour  Organisation  (ILO),  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme (UNDP), United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and World \nBank (WB). Other bilateral aid agencies from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, \nFinland, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and United States (US) are \nalso active. Appendix 4 presents a matrix of aid activities in the SME sector, spread across (i) \npolicy and institutional support; (ii) legal and regulatory enhancement; (iii) human resource \ndevelopment, such as vocational and training centers; (iv) line of credit for SMEs; and (v) \nbusiness development services. Despite diverse assistance, there has been no policy-based \nsupport in Viet Nam that takes a comprehensive view of developing the SME sector.  \n \n26.  More specifically, UNDP and UNIDO have worked closely with the Government on \nimplementing Decree 90 and a number of aspects related to the Enterprise Law. On issues \nrelated to SOE reform, WB, in coordination with a number of bilateral sources, has put in place \na comprehensive package of reforms under its Poverty Reduction and Support Credit. For credit \nto  SMEs,  WB,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  and  EU  have  separately \nprovided lines of credit to commercial banks for a combined total of approximately $500 million \nduring 2003\u20132005. As for other schemes related to SME financing, such as the credit guarantee \nsystem, the Japan International Cooperation Agency plans to provide assistance as part of \nJapan\u2019s Miyazawa Initiative. For reforms related to land use, Sweden has provided extensive \nassistance with a main focus on land planning and environmental issues. As regards capacity \nbuilding for SMEs, including those related to labor protection, bilateral aid agencies as well as \nILO have been active. On SMEs\u2019 access to markets, United States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID) is providing assistance to upgrade the laws on competition and economic \ncontracts,  to  enable  Viet  Nam's  accession  to  WTO.  ADB  closely  coordinates  with  these \nagencies to maximize synergies where possible, and avoid duplication of efforts.   \n \n5.  Lessons Learned \n27.  ADB's past operations in SME development suggest a number of key lessons.  \n \n(i)  For program loans, commitment of the developing member country (DMC) is \ncrucial  for  successful  outcomes.  Merely  passing  legislative  and  regulatory \nchanges to satisfy ADB conditions did not guarantee successful outcomes. \n \n(ii)  Programs must provide sufficient flexibility to allow for rapidly changing economic \nand political conditions.  \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2002. Second Financial Sector Program Loan. Manila (approved on 20 November 2002, for $50 million). ", "8    \n(iii)  ADB's SME operations in individual DMCs were often one-off projects, with little \ncontinuity and complementarities with other ADB operations or integration with \nother aid agencies\u2019 SME operations. \n \n28.  Distinct features of the SDPL, which address shortcomings of ADB's past operations for \nSME development, include the consultative approach taken throughout its formulation. A series \nof workshops for each component was organized with a view to achieving commitment from the \nGovernment and stakeholders. Furthermore, the road map helped clarify the coordination issue \nwith other aid agencies. For the SDPL to maintain its relevance throughout its implementation \nperiod, it proposes to adopt a program cluster modality, which would allow operational flexibility \nand adjusting to changing economic and political conditions. \n \n6.  Rationale \n29.  There is a consensus among the Government, ADB, and the aid community on the \nurgent need to support development of SMEs to sustain economic growth and to progressively \nreduce the country's poverty incidence. The traditional approach, which aimed to encourage \nSME development through provision of subsidized credit and services, did not address the \nunderlying distortions and consequently achieved mixed results. The SDPL focuses on these \ndistortions and the creation of an enabling business environment.  \n \n30.  Creation of an enabling business environment in Viet Nam is challenging due to features \ncommon  to  developing  economies  in  transition.  Many  key  policy,  legal,  and  institutional \nframeworks in support of business operations have yet to be completed. There also remains a \npolicy bias for public sector entities. In selecting areas to be covered under the SDPL, priority \nwas given to those assessed to be (i) significant for SMEs' current business operations, (ii) \nbacked by the Government's commitment to reform in line with best practices; (iii) linked to \nADB's past and ongoing operations; and (iv) complementary to activities of other aid agencies.  \n \n31.  Intensive discussions with Government counterparts and consultation with private sector \nstakeholders and aid agencies resulted in prioritizing SDPL objectives to (i) enhancing the policy \nand regulatory environment, (ii) improving access to financial and physical resources, and (iii) \nfacilitating access to domestic and international markets.  \n \n32.  To achieve these objectives, it would be critical to have (i) coordination of policies \namong various Government ministries and agencies concerned; (ii) continued policy dialogue \nwith both technical officials and decision makers of the executing and implementing agencies so \nthat reforms are implemented in line with best practices; (iii) appropriate funding for establishing \nand operationalizing systems in support of policy implementation; and (iv) technical inputs, \nparticularly for the purposes of institutional capacity building. Furthermore, these measures \nmust be effectively synchronized, achieve concrete results within a predetermined timeframe, \nand build momentum for further reforms to take place. Given these conditions, it was assessed \nthat a program loan modality would be most suitable for this project. The SDPL adopts a \nprocess-oriented approach implementing measures on a step-by-step basis and is designed to \nsystematically  identify  and  resolve  issues  and  constraints  within  the  SME  sector  through \nintergovernmental coordination and stakeholder consultation, taking advantage of the program \ncluster modality. \n \n33.  It is important to note that the SDPL will require extensive capacity building for its \nimplementation. In particular providing training and resources to local government authorities ", "    9 \nwill be imperative because actual implementation will take place largely at the local level. In this \nregard, good governance is a key element for successful implementation of the SDPL. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Objectives and Scope  \n34.  The objective of the SDPL is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to create a business \nenvironment that is conducive to economic growth and employment generation. Specifically, the \nSDPL will support reform measures for (i) enhancing the policy and regulatory framework; (ii) \nimproving SMEs\u2019 access to finance and land use rights; and (iii) facilitating SMEs\u2019 access to \ndomestic and international markets by improving industrial and technical standards. \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n35.  Reforms to be implemented in each component of the SDPL are presented in the policy \nmatrix accompanying the development policy letter (Appendix 5) and in the program framework \n(Appendix 1). A discussion of key policy measures follows. \n \n1.  Improving the Current Business Registration and Licensing Systems \n36.  The Enterprise Law of 2000 shifted the paradigm of business registration and licensing \nfrom one in which Government permitted companies to carry out certain activities, to one in \nwhich the companies are free to engage in all activities not expressly prohibited by law. The law \nhelped improve fairness and equality in the business environment and institutionalized the \nprinciple  that  citizens  are  entitled  to  conduct  businesses  in  accordance  with  the  law.  The \nEnterprise Law concurrently simplified licensing by abolishing 150 sublicenses and introduced a \none-stop registration system decreasing the number of steps in registration from 20 to 3.11 \n \n37.  Keeping business registration and licensing processes simple and ensuring consistent \nand fair implementation of the processes reduce uncertainty, risks, and costs for businesses. \nHowever,  recent  developments  show  some  reversals  from  earlier  measures  simplifying \nbusiness  registration  and  licensing.  For  example,  after  the  abolition  of  a  large  number  of \nlicensing  requirements,  numerous  new  requirements  have  been  issued.  To  maintain  the \nmomentum  of reform in the business registration and licensing procedures, the SDPL will \naddress (i) numerous implementing guidelines issued by provincial authorities that have caused \nconfusion to business registration officers; (ii) arbitrary interpretation and implementation of \nbusiness registration and licensing at local levels; and (iii) limited capacity and resources of \nregistration offices, particularly at local levels. \n \n38.  The SDPL supports the adoption of increased uniformity in procedures for business \nregistration throughout Viet Nam. It is expected that the business registration system will be \nmodernized at all levels\u2013\u2013central, provincial, and district\u2013\u2013and based on NBIN so that the \nregistration procedure may be simplified.  \n                                                 \n11  The positive impact of the new procedure is evident in the number of newly registered enterprises. During 2000\u2013\n2002, 55,793 new enterprises were established, compared with only 45,000 in 9 years (1991\u20131999). In 2000, \n14,400 new enterprises were registered under the Enterprise Law, a 250% increase from the previous year and \n500% increase in registered capital. In some provinces, such as Bac Giang, Ha Giang, Quang Binh, and Hung \nYen, the number of new enterprises registered in 2000 equaled the number of enterprises registered in the \nprevious 9 years. Some 150,000 household enterprises were also established in 2000, with 28,500 new household \nenterprises in Ho Chi Minh City alone. ", "10    \n39.  The  Task Force  for  the  Enforcement  of  the  Enterprise  Law  (Task  Force)  reviewed \nlicensing requirements and procedures and reported to the Prime Minister on the need for \nfurther streamlining. It identified decrees and implementation guidelines that contradict the spirit \nof the Enterprise Law and recommended measures to address them. The SDPL supports \nabolishing redundant and unnecessary regulations and licensing as recommended by the Task \nForce, through issuance of a decision by the Prime Minister. The SDPL will further support the \nTask Force and MPI to take on a greater role in creating a more effective licensing regime \n(rather than submitting ad hoc recommendations to the Prime Minister) conducive to business \ngrowth in Viet Nam. The SDPL will support authorization of the Task Force and MPI to submit a \nproposal for an ex ante assessment system for business licenses. \n \n2.  Establishing the Government\u2019s Policy and Institutional Framework for SME \nDevelopment \n40.  Promulgation  of  Decree  90  on  SME  development  in  2001  has  better  defined  the \nGovernment\u2019s role. A diverse range of Government policies and plans refers to the importance \nof SME development, but the Government has yet to integrate them into a national SME \ndevelopment  strategy.  The  strategy-making  process  has  been  constrained  by  limited \ninstitutional resources and capacity, lack of a coordination mechanism, insufficient efforts to \npromote public private partnerships, and a weak statistical base on SMEs.  \n \na.  Identifying a More Effective Basis for Targeting SMEs \n41.  Official definition of SMEs provides the basis for targeting, monitoring, and evaluating \nthe Government's SME policies. There is no globally accepted definition of SMEs and most \ncountries  establish  their  own  definition  based  on  their  specific  economic  and  social \ncircumstances.  In  Viet  Nam,  Decree  90  defines  SMEs  as  business  and  production \nestablishments that are registered under the current legislation, with a registered capital of less \nthan D10 billion (about $670,000) less than 300 permanent employees a year on average, or \nboth. A more precise definition will help the Government better monitor SMEs and develop a \nfocused set of policies. To better monitor SMEs and track their performance, the Government \nwill define SMEs more spcifically. \n \nb.  Developing a System for Collecting Information on SMEs \n42.  Accurate and up-to-date information permits the Government to identify constraints to \nthe establishment and growth of businesses. Thus, targeted interventions to eliminate such \nconstraints  may  be  initiated  with  predefined  and  quantified  baselines  for  measuring  policy \nimpact. Data on the SME sector in Viet Nam as defined by Decree 90 are not collected and key \ndata sources have not yet been formally asked to collect SME-specific data. The two main \nsources of data are  \n \n(i)  the national statistical network, which comprises the General Statistical Office \n(GSO), 61 provincial statistics offices, and over 600 district statistics offices. The \ndistrict statistics offices collect most of the data on SMEs for processing at the \nprovincial statistics offices and subsequent reporting to the different departments \nof the General Statistical Office; and \n \n(ii)  NBIN, which comprises the Business Information Center. NBIN has the mandate \nto set up and manage the registration system on enterprises throughout the \ncountry. It is within the Enterprise Department of MPI and collects data from 61 ", "    11 \nprovincial business registration offices and over 600 district business registration \nsections.  \n \n43.  Compiling accurate information on enterprises in Viet Nam is hindered by (i) absence of \nclear guidelines on the specific data to be collected, leading to significant local variance, and \naggregation of data at the provincial level; and (ii) low response rate from enterprises, estimated \nto be as low as 20% for SMEs and even lower for household enterprises.12  \n \n44.  To overcome the problems in data collection, the Agency for SME Development will \nupgrade and implement a plan for NBIN, under the SDPL, incorporating measures to address \ncurrent constraints. NBIN will cover all provinces in Viet Nam and incorporate an SME database \nas  well  as  an  on-line  SME  gateway  for  SMEs,  providing  information  on  regulations  and \nprocedures for compliance, Government support programs, business associations, and other \nbusiness support providers. It will also establish linkages with other sources of information on \nSMEs, such as the secured transactions center and GSO to augment data collected at NBIN \nand obtain a more comprehensive picture of the status of SMEs. \n \nc.  Formulating a Coordinated Plan for SME Development \n45.  The  Agency  for  SME  Development  was  created  under  Decree  90.  Its  tasks  and \nresponsibilities are wide-ranging and include formulation of an integrated SME development \nstrategy. Under TA 4031 (footnote 3), ADB provided technical inputs into the preparation of the \nroad map for SME development. A modernized information system and the road map form the \nbasis for the SME development strategy in Viet Nam. To put the strategy into action, MPI, the \nSDPL  support,  will  submit  a  multisector  and  interministerial  action  program  for  SME \ndevelopment to the Prime Minister for consideration of his approval.  \n \n46.  The SME Promotion Council, also created under Decree 90 and with cross-ministry \nmembership to advise the Prime Minister on mechanisms and policies on SME development, \nwill play an integral role in formulating the SME development strategy and its action program. \nSince a high-level interministerial coordination task force for horizontal integration of SME-\nrelated policies, and strategies and plans of various Government ministries and agencies has \nyet to be established, the review and feedback from the SME Promotion Council will be vital in \nmaintaining coherence and consistency of the strategy and its action program. However, the \nSME  Promotion  Council  has  limited  membership  from  the  private  sector.  To  ensure  that \nproblems of the SMEs are considered and addressed in the action program, the Government \nwill increase members from the private sector and business associations in the SME Promotion \nCouncil.  \n  \n3.  Enhancing SMEs\u2019 Access to Financial and Physical Resources \n47.  Access to finance is perhaps the most often cited problem of SMEs. Under the current \noperational environment, banks are becoming increasingly interested in lending to private sector \nSMEs. However, high transaction costs associated with lending to SMEs have held back actual \ngrowth in SME loans. Availability of collateral, which can potentially compensate for SMEs' \nperceived high credit risk, is limited, given the SMEs\u2019 weak asset base. The SDPL supports \nmeasures to reduce the cost and risks of lending by addressing the bottlenecks SMEs face in \nproviding financial information and offering collateral to lenders. Furthermore, it will also develop \n                                                 \n12 One of the main reasons for the low response from SMEs is that there is no single agency that collects the \nnecessary information comprehensively, making such information database useful for SMEs themselves.  ", "12    \nan alternative channel for SME financing through new funding sources and a diversified range \nof products for the leasing industry. \n \na.  Developing an SME Accounting System \n48.  The accounting system for smaller enterprises in Viet Nam is governed by two decisions \n(Decision 1177 on the Accounting System of SMEs issued on 23 December 1996, and Decision \n144 amending and supplementing Decision 1177 issued on 21 December 2001) and is based \non standards similar to those for larger enterprises. Specifically, enterprises are required to \nprepare  and  submit  a  balance  sheet  with  details  of  off-balance  sheet  items,  an  income \nstatement,  explanatory  note  to  financial  statements,  and  details  of  account  balances  on \ninventory, sales revenue, bad debts, overdue payables, changes in fixed assets, distribution of \nprofit, and the status or use of reserves. There are currently 25 accounting books applicable to \nall types of enterprises and 39 supporting documents (compulsory and guiding) in accordance \nwith Decisions 1177 and 144. \n \n49.  The Vietnamese accounting system is also in the process of being brought to conformity \nwith international accounting standards. An Accounting Standards Board, established by the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) in 1999, issued four Vietnamese accounting standards in 2001 and \nanother six standards in 2002. The newly issued Vietnamese accounting standards are largely \nin  accordance  with  international  standards.  Furthermore,  on  17  June  2003,  the  National \nAssembly passed the Law on Accounting, considerably modernizing the accounting rules in Viet \nNam. SME accounting, however, has fallen behind this process. The new Accounting Law, \nwhich became effective on 1 January 2004, supersedes both Decisions 1177 and 144, but \nreplacing decisions have yet to be issued.  \n \n50.  To  make  financial  records  available  for  loan  applications  under  a  uniform  set  of \naccounting standards applicable to SMEs, the inconsistencies and incompleteness of SME \naccounting must be remedied. Furthermore, a simplified system must be developed to better \nsuit SMEs' needs and capabilities. The SDPL supports MOF in issuing revised decisions to \nreplace 1177 and 144, consistent with the new Accounting Law. Subsequently, a simplified \nsystem consistent with the Vietnamese accounting standards will be introduced. The SDPL will \nfurther support dissemination of and training on the simplified SME accounting system through \nthe  Vietnamese  Accounting  Association  and  its  SME  Accounting  Center.  The  Center  will \nprepare a program to train SMEs and business associations on the new SME accounting \nsystem.   \n \nb.  Increasing Effective Use of Collateral \n51.  Most banks in Viet Nam rely mainly on SMEs' ability to provide security for loans due to \nSMEs' inadequate financial records and business planning skills on one hand, and the banks' \ninexperience and inability to effectively assess SMEs\u2019 credit risks on the other hand. Given \nSMEs\u2019 weak asset base, their options for collateral are not many and LURCs are likely to be the \nmost valuable. Yet issuance of LURCs (as immovable property) to SMEs has been extremely \ntime-consuming,  with  a  series  of  checks  that  must  be  cleared  and  requirements  for  legal \ndocuments that vary from province to province. The problem stems from the fact that the \nauthority to assign land-use rights and issue LURCs was given to local people's committees, \nand each adopted different procedures and requirements. The situation was further complicated \nby the lack of a single, uniform land registry system in Viet Nam. \n ", "    13 \n52.  The new Land Law of 2003 (effective July 2004), which introduces the concept of a \nsingle  land  registry  in  Viet  Nam,  is  expected  to  essentially  resolve  many  of  the  issues \nsurrounding LURCs. Under the new Land Law, a single format of LURCs will be issued to all \nland  users  under  the  sole  authority  of  the  Ministry  of  Natural  Resource  and  Environment \n(MONRE) for nationwide use. A single land registry system covering the whole of Viet Nam, \nusing one procedure for every registration, will help ensure clarity and security of titles and \nimprove the use of land as collateral. A simple, transparent, and uniform procedure for issuing \nLURCs will help reduce transaction costs for SMEs acquiring such rights. Furthermore, the new \nLand Law makes reference to bringing land pricing by the state in line with the market value of \nland, a significant departure from reliance on land prices set by the people's committees for \npurposes of taxation and compensation.  \n \n53.  The SDPL supports the Government in putting into practice the principles of the new \nLand Law, which would make LURCs more readily available for use as collateral by SMEs. \nSpecifically,  the  SDPL  will  support  developing  uniform  procedures  to  be  followed  by  all \nprovincial and district offices of MONRE for (i) land registration and LURC issuance, and (ii) \ninformation collection on the issued LURCs. Furthermore, MOF, together with MONRE, will draft \nnew guidelines for valuation of land in line with market prices for use by local authorities. A \ndecree stipulating the use of the guideline by local authorities will be drafted and issued. After \nthe issuance of the decree, MOF will draft and issue implementing circulars in accordance with \nthe Land Law. \n \n54.  For  using  movable  properties  as  collateral,  emphasis  has  been  placed  on  the \ndevelopment of a secured transactions registration system. Under the First Financial Sector \nProgram Loan (FSPL I),13 the Government issued a Secured Transactions Decree (Decree 165) \nand a Decree Establishing the Registry for Secured Transactions. The secured transactions \nregistry has the potential to reduce the costs and risks of lending secured by movable property, \nincluding equipment, inventories, and receivables, thus improving SMEs\u2019 access to finance. The \nGovernment continues to make steady progress toward developing a nationwide computerized \nsecured  transactions  registration  system.  The  Ministry  of  Justice  (MOJ)  prepared  an \nimplementation plan containing milestones for system development. In 2002, MOJ established \nthe National Registration Center of Secured Transactions in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh. But, to \nachieve the objective of effectively securing credit, much work is still needed on both the legal \nframework and system development. \n \n55.  For the proper functioning of the secured transactions registry, legal documents must \nclearly establish prioritization of creditors' and lien holders' rights upon registering their interest. \nFurthermore, the computerized system must ensure efficiency and transparency for potential \ncreditors or purchasers. MOJ, with SDPL support, will draft and submit to the National Assembly \nlegislation prioritizing creditors' and lien holders' rights upon registering their interest on the \nNational  Registration  Agency  for  Secured  Transactions  (NRAST).  Furthermore,  the  SDPL \nsupports enactment of an implementing decree to the ordinance, which will promote efficiency \nand transparency of the registration agency by (i) permitting anyone to obtain free noncertified \nsearch reports through Internet\u2013based search, (ii) allowing frequent registrants to register on-\nline, and (iii) limiting required data for registering notice. \n \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 1996.

Manila \n(approved for $90 million on 19 November 1996).  ", "14    \nc.  Improving the Operational Environment for Financial Leasing \nCompanies \n56.  Financial leasing operations in Viet Nam are governed by Decree 16/2001/ND-CP (May \n2001) and Circular No. 8/2001/TT-NHNN (September 2001) issued by State Bank of Viet Nam \n(SBV). The activities of financial leasing companies (FLCs) are confined to financial leasing for \nmachinery, equipment, vehicles, and other movable assets; advising clients on matters relating \nto  financial  leasing  operations;  and  other  services  related  to  financial  leasing.  Sale  and \nleaseback and syndicated lease transactions are permitted, although implementing regulations \nhave yet to be issued. Transactions in foreign currency are subject to the foreign exchange \ncontrol regulations of SBV. FLCs are permitted to mobilize capital from short-, medium-, and \nlong-term borrowing from credit institutions in Viet Nam and abroad; issuance of bonds with a \nterm of over 1 year (subject to SBV approval); and by other means as approved by SBV. \n57.  The development of the leasing industry in Viet Nam is particularly constrained by \nshortcomings in the legal framework that restrict both the activities and the funding mechanisms \nof FLCs. The Government recognizes that the absence of implementing regulations for sale and \nleaseback transactions and syndicated leasing constrains FLCs from offering a fuller product \nrange tailored to market needs. Long-term funding also presents a problem for some FLCs, \nincluding subsidiaries of state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) that source all or most of their \nfunds from their respective parent banks. Leasing companies have cited difficulties in attracting \nterm loans of more than 1 year at viable interest rates, and relatively few have been successful \nin issuing medium- or long-term bonds. To date, no leasing company has attempted to structure \nand sell packages of their outstanding leases, as a way of leveraging additional funds. The \nSDPL will support the Government in revising Decree 16 and Circular No. 8 governing leasing \nactivities to allow wider product ranges and sources of funding for FLCs. \n4.  Completing  the  Legal  Framework  for  Land  to  Allow  Market-Based \nTransactions  \n58.  Many SME surveys in Viet Nam point to limited access to land as the foremost constraint \nto their growth.14 Issues on SMEs\u2019 access to land revolve around inefficiencies resulting from \ninconsistencies and bias distinct to economies in transition. For example, there is a significant \ndifference in the proportion of land-use rights held by SOEs compared with those held by private \nsector SMEs. The economic transformation process has resulted in a large amount of prime \ncommercial and industrial land allocated to SOEs. However, many do not take full advantage of \nthe land allocated to them in their industrial or commercial activities. Much land allocated to the \nSOEs are left idle with no plans for future use while the rapidly growing private SMEs are \nsuffering from lack of land for their use. Consequently, leasing idle land from SOEs has become \nthe most common method used by private sector SMEs to obtain land, although subletting from \nSOEs is, in most cases, illegal. \n \n59.  Despite  the  country\u2019s  transition  toward  a  more  market-based  economy,  land  still  is \nconsidered as being owned by \u201call citizens\u201d and administered by the State as \u201crepresentative \nowner.\u201d This fundamental framework has not changed. However, the Government is taking \nproactive measures to clarify the principles of land law and make them consistent for developing \na property market in Viet Nam. Given the sensitivity of issues related to land, progress will likely \nbe gradual. Nonetheless, some noteworthy measures have been taken. For example, the new \n                                                 \n14  Reports and surveys: Institute of Economics. 2001. General Survey on Infrastructure Services to the Private \nSector. Hanoi, Viet Nam; and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). 2002. Business Environment for \nPrivate Enterprises. Tokyo, Japan.  ", "    15 \nLand Law of 2003, supported under the SDPL, recognized the property market for the first time \nin Viet Nam and stipulates that land pricing should be based on real market transfer prices of \nland-use  rights  under  normal  circumstances.  The  law  also  augments  and  improves  State \nmanagement of land in terms of (i) land zoning and planning, (ii) transferring the power to \nallocate or lease land and issue LURCs from the Government to the provincial and district \npeople\u2019s committees, (iii) establishing the organization (nonprofit public service SOE) to create \nand manage land funds, (iv) establishing a uniform land registration system for undertaking all \nland registration in Viet Nam, (v) making clear the procedures for settling of land disputes, and \n(vi) clarifying the guiding principles for land pricing. \n \n60.  One of the key achievements of the new law is making land-use rights transferable \nbased on market principles. It also introduces a single nationwide registry system, a uniform \nprocedure for issuing LURCs, and measures to improve the use of idle land. A simplified and \nmore  transparent  legislative  framework  will  benefit  SMEs  by  making  the  law  easier  to \nunderstand,  particularly  for  owners  or  operators  who  have  no  legal  background,  and  by \ngenerally reducing transaction costs. \n \n61.  The  SDPL  supports  enforcing  impartial  dissemination  of  information  on  land  use \nplanning and zoning. Viet Nam does not have mandatory land use planning that designates \nspecific land use in certain zones for specific purposes. Instead, it has regional zoning plans \nand urban development master plans. The detailed plans prepared for specific zones must then \nbe developed in accordance with the urban development master plan. The detailed plans, as \ndescribed in Decree 68 on preparation and approval of land zoning and planning in localities, is \nthe primary vehicle for land use management and land allocation associated with public and \nprivate sector housing, infrastructure, and commercial development projects. Preparation of the \ndetailed plan is normally the first step in the project development process, and is a prerequisite \nfor the subsequent steps of obtaining planning certificates, and land allocation and construction \napprovals.  \n \n62.  Thus, information on detailed plans is important to all enterprises interested in acquiring \nland and should be widely disseminated once the provincial government approves such a plan. \nHowever, information on land zoning and plans is valuable, and can be sold or used as the \nbasis for land speculation. The new Land Law requires that the land zoning and plans be \nannounced publicly within 30 days after they are decided or ratified by the competent state \nagency.  To  ensure  that  SMEs  are  given  access  to  such  information,  the  SDPL  supports \nMONRE in preparing a decree that mandates local agencies to disseminate information on \nzoning and planning promptly, and specifies that administrative penalties will be imposed for \nviolation of this requirement. \n \n5.  Enhancing SMEs\u2019 Access to International Markets \n63.  Standardization  is  a  key  part  of  microeconomic  infrastructure  that  is  still  in  the \ndevelopment phase in Viet Nam. For businesses, standards help create a common trading \nlanguage, and reduce costs for manufacturing and warehousing. For governments, standards \noffer an opportunity for deregulation and improved governance as they help to ease the level of \nregulatory details to essential requirements for health protection, safety, and the environment. \nThe  SDPL  supports  the  Government  in  developing  industrial  and  technical  standards  in \nconformity with best international practices, which promote participation of all stakeholders, \nincluding SMEs. \n ", "16    \na.  Completing the Legal Framework on Industrial and Technical \nStandards in Conformity with Best International Practices \n64.  Some secondary regulations relating to the Ordinance of Product Quality of 1999 are \neither outdated or incomplete. A Government providing a detailed definition of the Ordinance on \nProduct Quality only exists in draft form and has yet to be approved. Other legal texts required \nfor completion of the current legal framework include (i) issuance of \u201cThe List of Products \nRequired  to  Conform  to  Vietnamese  Technical  Standards\u201d;  and  (ii)  update  of  the  list  of \nimport/export products in Decision 117, which requires the State to check for quality. These \nlegal texts are expected to sufficiently clarify the requirements of product quality and aid in \neffectively implementing the current ordinance. \n \n65.  As a next step, the SDPL will support drafting and submitting to the Government an \nordinance on standardization to develop a uniform standardization system with the aim of \nreducing regulatory burdens. Such an ordinance will be in line with international practices and is \nexpected to substantially reduce the cost of regulatory compliance for SMEs. \n \nb.  Undertaking Institutional Reforms and Bringing SME Representation \nin Setting Standards \n66.  There are several impediments within the current institutional framework. One problem \narea is in accreditation of certification bodies. In Viet Nam, there is one accreditation body, the \nBureau of Accreditation, vested with the task of assessing the competence of certification \nbodies. However, the Bureau of Accreditation has yet to accredit a single certification body. \nGiven the current limited capacity of the bureau, it would be beneficial to authorize international \ninstitutions to accredit certification bodies in Viet Nam. Accordingly, the SDPL will support the \nMinistry of Science and Technology (MOST) in drafting a decision requiring that any certification \nbody operating in Viet Nam must be accredited by an Accreditation Body that is a mutual \nrecognition agreement by signatory member of the International Accreditation Forum, or Pacific \nAccreditation Cooperation, or Viet Nam's Board of Accreditation. \n \n67.  The Directorate for Standards and Quality (STAMEQ), as authorized by MOST, had \noriginally been the only institution to certify standardized products, quality assurance systems, \nand testing laboratories. These functions have been transferred to technical service institutions; \nhowever,  STAMEQ  continues  to  undertake  certification.  There  is  a  conflict  of  interest  for \nSTAMEQ to handle certification when the Bureau of Accreditation is operating under STAMEQ. \nDevelopment of certification bodies in the private sector will also be hindered as a result of \nSTAMEQ's competitive advantage as a state-owned certification body. To address this issue, \nMOST will plan for and implement the separation of STAMEQ's state administrative functions \nfrom its commercial activities.  \n \n68.  The  SDPL  also  supports  SMEs'  participation  in  the  process  of  setting  standards. \nInvolvement in the process of standardization itself also allows the interests of SMEs to be \nreflected in the resulting standards. Under the SDPL, MOST will ensure that private SMEs are \nrepresented  in  the  National  Technical  Committee  of  Standard  and  industry  and  technical \ncommittees of standardization.        \n ", "    17 \nc.  Making Information on Both National and International Standards \nReadily Available \n69.  SMEs in Viet Nam currently have poor knowledge of international standards and national \nstandards  of  other  countries.  Availability  of  information  about  competitors  and  market \nrequirements related to product quality is limited. A database of international standards and \nnational  standards  of  other  countries  has  been  developed  by  the  Information  Center  of \nSTAMEQ  and  additional  information  regarding  technical  standards  and  product  quality  is \nprovided by information centers of some ministries. However, it is not always immediately \napparent to SMEs how this information relates to their business and finding simple answers to \nbasic questions is often difficult for SMEs that have little knowledge of how standards and \nconformity assessment systems work. SMEs also have limited access to information on testing \nservices provided by Vietnamese and international testing laboratories.  \n \n70.  Lack of access to information and knowledge on standards can be a major competitive \ndisadvantage for SMEs attempting to enter domestic or international markets. To overcome this \nbarrier, the SDPL supports MOST in developing an on-line database providing SMEs with \ninformation on (i) national standards of other countries, international standards, and cross-\nrecognition  schemes;  (ii)  certification  bodies,  testing  laboratories,  and  quality  management \nproviders; and (iii) relevant information on technology transfer.   \n \nC.  Important Features \n71.  The SDPL is based on an in-depth analysis and discussions with the Government on \neach component over a period of 9 months. In particular, policy measures proposed under the \nSDPL were discussed extensively with Government officials, at both technical and decision-\nmaking levels, with highly technical inputs from experts in the fields of SME policy, land, leasing, \nregistration  systems,  secured  transactions,  and  technical  standards.  The  discussions \nculminated  in  agreement  with  the  Government  on  the  objective  and  expected  impact  of \nundertaking clearly defined specific policy actions conforming with best international practices.    \n \n72.  In the medium term, policies implemented with the support of the SDPL are expected to \nincrease SMEs\u2019 contribution to economic growth and employment generation. Many measures \nadopted under the SDPL support the Government in undertaking market-friendly interventions \nand eliminating policy bias against SMEs, thus strengthening the environment for private sector \ndevelopment. Beneficiaries of such measures are expected to include the poor and the near \npoor. The impact of the SDPL on the poor has been assessed in Appendix 6.  \n \n73.  The proposed policies under the SDPL are expected to have no negative impact on \nwomen. Policies to mainstream gender concerns under the SDPL were, however, constrained \nby lack of data on SMEs in general. This serious limitation also makes quantifying the impact of \nthe SDPL on specific groups of people, such as the poor and women, impractical. The SDPL \naddresses this shortcoming through (i) the establishment of NBIN, and  (ii) annual reports to be \nprepared on the status of SMEs. The SDPL will closely monitor outcomes, and economic and \nsocial impacts throughout its implementation to ensure that there are no adverse impact on the \npoor and the vulnerable, including women.  \n74.  Implementation of the policy conditions proposed under the SDPL is expected to have \ninsignificant direct impact on the environment. Measures to be adopted by the Government \nconcentrate on (i) streamlining administrative procedures, such as those required for business \nand land registration; (ii) providing more relevant information to SMEs, such as those related to ", "18    \nstatutory  rules  and  regulations  and  SME  support  programs;  and  (iii)  establishing  social  or \neconomic  infrastructure,  such  as  the  land  registration,  secured  transactions,  and  SME \naccounting systems.   \n75.  Two  components  may  have  some  positive  impact  on  the  environment.  One  is  the \ncomponent for improving SME's access to land\u2013\u2013enactment of the Land Law, which establishes \nclear  and  secure  rights  for  land  use,  increasingly  allowing  market-based  transactions  on \nLURCs. There is the potential that long-term and sustainable resource management will be \nundertaken due to the increased security and clarity on land use. The newly enacted law also \nclearly stipulates safeguards for environmental protection. The second component with potential \npositive impact is enhancement of the standardization framework in Viet Nam. By bringing the \nlegal and institutional frameworks for standardization in line with international best practices, the \ntechnical  and  industrial  standards  will  be  upgraded.  Adherence  to  such  standards  by  all \nenterprises in Viet Nam will likely bring positive impact on the environment in the medium to \nlong term.  Accordingly, the SDPL is classified as category C under ADB's environmental \nclassification system.15\nD.  Financing Plan \n76.  The lending modality of the SDPL will be a program cluster, comprising two back-to-back \nsubprograms.  For  subprogram  I,  an  ADB  loan  of  $60  million  equivalent  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) is proposed. For the succeeding subprogram II\u2013\u2013based on resource \navailability and satisfactory performance of the first subprogram\u2013\u2013an ADB loan of $20 million \nequivalent from ADF and an additional $20 million from ordinary capital resources (OCR) is \nproposed.  \n \n77.  The SDPL is being cofinanced by Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) and \nKreditanstalt fur Wiederauflbau (KfW); and representatives from both the Deutsche Gesellschaft \nf\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) and JBIC joined the loan fact-finding mission in March \n2004 to strengthen operational consistency. AFD proposes to provide cofinancing of \u20ac25 million, \n\u20ac15 million for subprogram I, and \u20ac10 million for subprogram II. KfW proposes to provide \ncofinancing of \u20ac20 million: \u20ac14 million for subprogram I and \u20ac6 million for subprogram II.16   \n \n78.  The SDPL will be the first program loan to be cofinanced by KfW. As in the case of AFD \ncofinancing, KfW's contribution is structured as a parallel financing arrangement. This is an \nimportant  step  for  ADB  to  further  expand  its  financing  partnership  with  key  development \npartners in new areas of operation. Within the overall program, KfW concentrates on improving \nthe operational environment for FLCs, taking responsibility for the initial assessment of the \nreform process. ADB will provide overall coordination and oversight for monitoring the program. \nReporting to and by the Government is designed to minimize transaction costs in dealing with \ndifferent agencies. \n \n79.  The total amount for the SDPL and loan amounts for the subprograms are determined \non the basis of the strategic importance of developing the SME sector and the costs of structural \nreforms to be supported under the SDPL. Such costs arising from reform measures to be \nimplemented are estimated to be around $190 million to $250 million equivalent during the 36 \nmonths of program implementation.17 It has been estimated that streamlined licensing, and \n                                                 \n15 The environmental assessment of the policy matrix is in the Supplementary Appendix.  \n16 Conversion rate: $1.00=\u20ac0.84.\n17 Estimates by ADB staff with inputs from consultants engaged under TA 4031-VIE (footnote 3). ", "    19 \nbusiness and land registration procedures will reduce fees in the range of $35 million to $55 \nmillion per year. Equipment, software, and hardware for establishing systems in support of a \nstreamlined and efficient business and land registration systems in the pilot phase will incur \ncosts of approximately $20 million. Training, including for those at local and district levels, is \nestimated to cost $12 million per year. Institutional reform measures, including those for the \nAgency for SME Development, Business and Land Registration Section at the district level, and \nSTAMEQ, are estimated to cost some $28 million. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n80.  MPI will be the Executing Agency for the SDPL. MONRE, MOF, MOST, MOJ, and SBV \nwill be the implementing agencies. MPI will be responsible for overall program implementation, \nincluding administration and disbursement of loan proceeds, maintenance of accounts, and \npreparation of semiannual progress reports on program implementation.  \n \n81.  To  coordinate  program  implementation  among  government  ministries  and  agencies \nconcerned, a program steering committee (PSC) will be formed. The PSC, chaired by a deputy \nminister  of MPI,  will  comprise  senior  officers  from  all  ministries  and  government  agencies \nconcerned (MOF, MONRE, MOST, MOJ, and SBV). The PSC will meet twice yearly and on an \nad hoc basis to review pending issues and propose concrete actions for their resolution to \nensure timely program implementation. A program implementation and coordination unit will be \nformed within MPI to assist the PSC and ADB in implementing the Program. The unit will be \nheaded by a senior officer of MPI and staffed with MPI officials. The unit will be responsible for \nday-to-day implementation of the SDPL. \n \n2.  Procurement and Disbursement \n82.  In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans, all goods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will \nbe procured, with due consideration to economy and efficiency, in accordance with standard \npublic procedures in Viet Nam and normal private sector commercial practices acceptable to \nADB.18 Goods commonly traded on the international commodity markets will be procured in \naccordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB. \n \n83.  The proceeds of the SDPL will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, except for a \nlist of ineligible items (Appendix 7). The Borrower will certify that the value of total imports minus \n(i) imports from nonmember countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) disbursements made under \nother official development assistance, is greater than the amount expected to be disbursed \nduring the year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the \naccuracy of the Borrower's certification.  \n \n3.  Counterpart Funds \n84.  The Government has assured that sufficient funds will be made available to meet the \ncosts associated with the reform program supported by the SDPL. Any counterpart funds not \nrequired for the reforms will be used for general budget support. \n                                                 \n18  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. ", "20    \n4.  Monitoring and Tranching \n85.  The Government and ADB/AFD/KfW will continue to engage in active policy dialogue on \nsector  issues,  policy  reforms,  and  other  measures  during  SDPL  implementation  and  on \nadditional reforms that may be considered necessary or desirable.   \n \n86.  For its effective implementation, the program lending modality requires an appropriate \nregime  for  public  financial  management,  including  budget  development,  execution  and \nmonitoring, external fiscal reporting, and transparency. The aid community in Viet Nam has \nmade collective efforts to assess the status of the public financial management system and \nproduced a number of periodic diagnostic reports. During SDPL implementation, ADB will, from \ntime to time, review reports on the public financial management system in Viet Nam prepared by \nother aid agencies and will request the Government to clarify and discuss issues identified in \nsuch reports.19  \n \n87.  The  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  consolidated  semiannual  reports  on  SDPL \nimplementation and accomplishment of objectives. The consolidated reports, to be submitted in \nsuch form and detail and within the period that ADB may reasonably request, will cover (i) \nprogress made and specific problems encountered during the 6 months under review, (ii) steps \ntaken or proposed to resolve the problems, and (iii) proposed SDPL activities and expected \nprogress during the following 6 months. ADB will send regular review missions to confirm \ncompliance  with  conditions  for  the  second  tranche  release  for  subprogram  I  as  well  as \ncompliance  with  conditions  for  subprogram  II,  and  advise  on  actions  to  maintain  SDPL \nimplementation on course. To the extent possible, the review missions will be fielded jointly with \nAFD and KfW. Within 3 months from completion of the SDPL or at such time as deemed \nappropriate,  the  Government  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  consolidated  program \ncompletion report on the overall impact of the policy reforms implemented.  \n \na.  Subprogram I \n88.  The loan for subprogram I is to be released in two tranches: (i) the first tranche of $25 \nmillion from ADF, upon compliance with the first tranche release conditions; and (ii) the second \ntranche of $35 million from ADF, upon fulfillment of the second tranche release conditions. The \nsecond tranche is expected to be released 18 months from loan effectiveness, but may be \nreleased earlier upon compliance with the specified tranche release conditions. ADB and the \nGovernment will jointly review progress in implementing specified policy actions approximately 3 \nmonths before the scheduled tranche releases. The first and second tranche release conditions \nare as set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 5).  \n \n89.  Where feasible, the Government is encouraged to undertake, during the implementation \nof  subprogram  I,  policy  measures  proposed  under  subprogram  II.  ADB  will  reflect  the \nGovernment's achievements and refine policy actions under subprogram II accordingly, taking \ninto consideration the policy environment for implementing subprogram II. The Government and \nADB have identified three conditions in subprogram II, as conditions for Board consideration for \nthat subprogram II loan. These conditions are as specified in the policy matrix. Successful \n                                                 \n19  The importance of allocating an appropriate budget to the implementing agencies to ensure sustainable operations \nof systems developed in the SDPL, such as the NBIN under MPI and the centralized land registry under MONRE \nwas discussed with the Government. In the event of delays in fulfilling second tranche conditions of subprogram I, \nrelevant government agencies will be requested to provide information on budget allocation associated with such \nconditions. ", "    21 \ncompletion of subprogram I and agreement to retain the three Board consideration conditions in \nsubprogram II will be a requisite for initiating subprogram II processing.  \n \nb.  Subprogram II \n90.  The proposed loan for subprogram II will be processed separately after the successful \ncompletion of subprogram I and presented to the Board for approval. Subprogram II is expected \nto comprise a loan of $20 million equivalent from ADF and a loan of $20 million equivalent from \nOCR. Its tranching remains to be determined. Proposed conditions for subprogram II are set out \nin the policy matrix and are subject to revision and refinement following the assessment of the \nmacroeconomic environment, lessons learned from implementing subprogram I, and overall \nprogress  in  SME  development-related  reforms.  However,  the  principal  concept  of  Board \nconsideration conditions must be maintained in subprogram II. The conditions for subprogram II \nare envisioned to be implemented within 18 months from effectiveness of the subprogram II \nloan. \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n91.  The  advisory  technical  assistance  (ADTA)  will  provide  key  technical  inputs  for \nimplementing the SDPL and institutional capacity building support to implementing agencies on \na selective basis.  The main activities of the TA will focus on (i) technical, legal, and policy-\nrelated assistance to the reform agenda based on international best practices, where applicable; \n(ii) institution-building activities, including fostering good governance and pilot implementation of \nnew systems; and (iii) new approaches to training and information dissemination.   \n \n92.  Given the extensive need for technical assistance in implementing the SDPL, a series of \nADTAs are proposed for consideration. The ADTA to be attached to the SDPL will support \nimplementation of SDPL\u2019s subprogram I. Furthermore, pending availability of TA funds, both \nwithin ADB and from other aid agencies, additional assistance will be provided, in particular to \nbuild the capacity of the implementing agencies\u2013\u2013an item not sufficiently covered under the \naccompanying ADTA\u2013\u2013and to support the policy actions in subprogram II. Separately, KfW \nproposes an ADTA for developing the leasing industry, while AFD proposes an ADTA for \nimplementing a number of key policy actions associated with enhancing technical and industrial \nstandards.   \n \n93.  Funding for the ADTA to be attached to the SDPL will not exceed $1,400,000 equivalent. \nADB will administer portions of the TA not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to be financed \non a grant basis by the Government of Denmark and the equivalent of $600,000 to be financed \non a grant by the Government of Switzerland. ADB will provide the balance not exceeding the \nequivalent of $500,000, on a grant basis, from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA will cover the \nentire foreign exchange costs and part of the local currency cost.20 The ADTA, tentatively \nplanned for inception in November 2004, will be implemented over 9 months. A total of 30 \nperson-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  44  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services will be required. Consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. Procurement \nunder the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The objectives, \nscope, and implementation arrangements, including the budget of the ADTA, are in Appendix 8. \n \n                                                 \n20 A second ADTA for $300,000 is currently in the pipeline to support the implementation of SDPL subprogram II.  \nConfirmation of the TA will take place during the Country Programming Mission in 2005.  ", "22    \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impact \n94.  In resolving legal, institutional, and technical constraints that disadvantage SMEs in \naccessing credit, acquiring land-use rights, and achieving regulatory compliance, the SDPL \ntakes  a  market-based  participatory  approach.  For  instance,  the  SDPL  acknowledges  the \nfundamental role of information for markets to allocate resources efficiently and the essential \nneed for all market participants to have access to that same relevant public information. The \nSDPL  utilizes  the  technology  available  today  in  making  as  much  pertinent  information  as \npossible obtainable in the public domain.  \n \n95.  Collectively, the availability of information for doing business in Viet Nam is expected to \nsubstantially increase, thus reducing the cost and risks of doing business for all enterprises. \nEnterprises will benefit from (i) the establishment of NBIN, which will have an on-line SME \ngateway providing information on procedures to comply with regulations, Government support \nprograms  for  SMEs,  business  associations,  and  other  business  support  providers;  (ii)  the \ndissemination for training of the simplified SME accounting system through the Vietnamese \nAccounting Association; (iii) impartial dissemination of information on land-use planning and \nzoning; and (iv) an on-line database providing information on national and international technical \nand industrial standards.  \n \n96.  The  SDPL  also  introduces  information  technology  for  collecting  and  compiling \ninformation and data nationwide. The current fragmented database on business activities and \nland usage constrains the Government and businesses in making informed decisions. Both the \nrollout of NBIN nationwide and adoption of a single land registry aim to make available timely, \naccurate, and comprehensive information covering all of Viet Nam. Such database is part of a \nmodern infrastructure required for efficient functioning of markets and may be considered as \npublic goods that help achieve transactional efficiencies.  \n \n97.  Adopting  simple  and  uniform  systems  and  administrative  procedures  is  the  basic \nprinciple that guides the SDPL. Simple and uniform systems and administrative procedures \nhave the merit of avoiding confusion, arbitrariness, and rent-seeking behavior in delivering \npublic services, particularly at the provincial and district levels. They also bring the benefits of \neconomies of scale when implemented through a nationwide system, thus reducing the total \ncost of service delivery. Concurrently, the cost of doing business for enterprises would also be \nreduced.  Specific  examples  in  the  SDPL  include  (i)  business  licensing  and  registration \nprocedures, (ii) simplified accounting system for SMEs, (iii) procedures for issuance of LURCs, \nand (iv) the uniform standardization systems.  \n \n98.  The  SDPL  also  calls  for  the  participation  of  business  representatives  in  the  SME \nPromotion Council, the highest advisory body for policy making in support of SME development, \nand  SME  representation  in  the  National  Committee  of  Standardization  and  other  relevant \nindustry and technical committees for standardization. SMEs' participation is essential to ensure \nthat  their  specific  competitive  disadvantages  and  unique  business  opportunities  within  the \nVietnamese  commercial  and  industrial  environment  are  fully  considered  in  the  process  of \nformulating policies, rules, and regulations. Their representation will not only help eliminate \nunfair policy bias against SMEs but also encourage transparency and stakeholder consultation \nto the benefit of the economy as a whole.  \n ", "    23 \n99.  The positive elements incorporated in the SDPL will increasingly be felt as the existing \nsystems are transformed and modernized to better support a progressively market-oriented \neconomy. Successful implementation of the SDPL will form the basis for further developing the \nprivate sector in Viet Nam.  \n \nB.  Risks and Safeguards \n100.  There  are  three  principal  risks  in  implementing  the  SDPL.  The  first  is  in  effective \ncoordination  and  cooperation  within  the  Government,  both  horizontally  among  different \nministries and agencies concerned and vertically with the provincial and district authorities. \nConsultation and coordination with the private sector and the aid community active in SME \ndevelopment will also be required. It is expected that coordination and cooperation among all \nstakeholders  will  gradually  improve  with  the  increased  capacity  of  the  Agency  for  SME \nDevelopment, thus reducing the risk of overlap and inconsistencies in SME support activities. \nTA in support of SDPL implementation will also include capacity building for the Agency for SME \nDevelopment to reduce this risk. \n \n101.  A  second  risk  pertains  to  good  governance  in  the  central,  provincial,  and  district \ngovernments. Governance at the provincial and district level is particularly important, since the \npositive impact of the SDPL requires effective implementation of policies at the ground level. \nThese  risks  are  common  to  several  programs  and  are  being  addressed  through  the \nimplementation of the comprehensive Public Administration Reform Master Program for 2001\u2013\n2010, which is being supported by ADB.21\n \n102.  A third risk relates to the technical capacities of implementing agencies. Experience \nsuggests that, given adequate technical support, the Government\u2019s commitment to reforms is \nstrong. In implementing previous programs, delays were caused predominantly by the lack of \ntechnical expertise and of the consensus-building approach in enacting of laws and regulations. \nTo reduce this risk, the TA was formulated through discussions with all implementing agencies \nat the technical level. Many requirements pertain to completing the legal framework and putting \nin  place  modern  information  technology-based  systems,  taking  into  consideration  the \nexperience of other countries. The SDPL will also involve coordination with aid agencies active \nin their respective areas in each component.  \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n103.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The policies adopted and actions taken before the date of the Loan Agreement \nas described in the development policy letter (Appendix 5) will continue to be in \neffect for the duration of the SDPL period; and \n(ii)  The  Government  will  promptly  adopt  such  policies  and  take  other  actions \nincluded in the SDPL and specified in the development policy letter, and will \n                                                 \n21  ADB. 2003.

Definition of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises   \n1.  Decree 90 defines SMEs to be \u201cthose business and production establishments that have \nregistered under the current legislation, have the registered capital of less than D10 billion at \nbusiness registration agencies and/or the average number of annual permanent employees of \nless than 300.\u201d   \nB.  Size and Diversity of the SME Sector \n2.  Data on the SME sector in Viet Nam, as defined by Decree 90, are not collected and, as \nyet, no formal request to collect SME-specific data has been made to key data sources. The \nmain sources of data are the national statistical network with data collected by the General \nStatistical Office (GSO), and the National Business Information Network (NBIN) of the Ministry \nof Planning and Investment (MPI). Some tentative conclusions as to the size and diversity of the \nsector can be drawn, using data collected by these organizations for other purposes.  \n3.  SME  data  are  scarce  and  fragmented,  and  their  reliability  is  suspect.  There  is  a \nsignificant gap with respect to the availability of reliable statistical information on the registration \nand performance of SMEs. Available data often aggregate all types of enterprises including \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs), non-SOEs and foreign invested enterprises. This makes the \nanalysis complex. Efforts have been made to disaggregate the data to the most usable extent \npossible  to  provide  a  reasonable  understanding  of  the  Vietnamese  SME  sector,  but  the \nfundamental shortcomings in the data sets used remain. \n4.  This said, there is a consistent view that SMEs constitute an overwhelming proportion of \ntotal  enterprises  in  Viet  Nam;  SMEs  are  most  active  in  commerce,  trade,  repair  and \nmanufacturing; and SMEs are major employment creators.   \n5.  Table A2.1 outlines the overall profile of enterprises in Viet Nam during 1998\u20132002. It is \nestimated that as of 31 December 2002 Viet Nam had about 736,000 registered enterprises in \nall sectors. This number does not include the several million informal household enterprises not \nobliged to register at local government offices.  \nTable A2.1: Profile of Firms in Viet Nam as of 31 December 2002 \n \nType of Firm  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002 \nFirms with Tax Codes           \n   SOEs   6,498  6,235  5,813  5,587  5,256 \n   Non-SOEs  26,335  33,939  45,294  62,068  81,188 \n   FIEs  881  959  1,063  1,127  1,194 \nSubtotal  33,714  41,133  52,170  68,782  87,638 \nSOEs (% of total)  19  15  11  8  6 \nNon-SOEs (% of total)  78  83  87  90  93 \nFIEs (% of total)  3  2  2  2  1 \nTotal  100  100  100  100  100 \nFirms without Tax Codes           \nSubtotal  559,234  577,065  602,798  625,484  648,284 \nTotal  592,948  618,198  654,968  694,266  735,922 \n    SOE = state-owned enterprise, FIE = foreign invested enterprise.  \n    Source: General Statistical Office, 2003. \n ", "34 Appendix 2 \n \n6.  GSO data allow the disaggregation of only those enterprises with tax codes. Those \nwithout tax codes are assumed to be household enterprises or small enterprises in terms of \ncapital, labor, and revenue. The number of tax-coded enterprises is reported to have increased \nfrom 33,714 in 1998 to 87,638 in 2002, with an average growth rate of 27% per annum during \n1998\u20132002. In 2002, non-SOEs accounted for 93% of total enterprises, while SOEs accounted \nfor 6% and FIEs for 1%. The number of SOEs is observed to have declined from 6,498 in 1998 \nto 5,256 enterprises in 2002 due to SOE equitization.  \n7.  In  1998  there  were  592,234  non-tax-coded  enterprises.  The  number  increased  to \n649,284 in 2002, with an annual growth rate of 4%. These enterprises account for some 88% of \ntotal enterprises in 2002 and they are assumed to be small in size and scope of operation. As \nthere are no systematic statistical data on these enterprises, the analysis will assume that \nenterprises without tax codes have registered capital below D10 billion, employ less than 300 \nemployees, and hence are SMEs.  \n8.  Table A2.2 shows that based on the registered capital criterion, at the end of 2002, there \nwere 84,371 enterprises with registered capital below D10 billion. SMEs accounted for 99.6% of \ntotal enterprises, assuming that those SMEs without tax codes have registered capital of less \nthan D10 billion. For each individual year during 1998\u20132002, SMEs were over 99% of total \nenterprises and their annual growth rate in number was on average 5%. SMEs are observed to \nbe predominantly in the category of less than D1 billion in registered capital, accounting for an \naverage proportion of 97% of total enterprises.  \nTable A2.2: Classification of Firms by Registered Capital \n \n1998    1999  2000  2001    2002 \n \n% of    % of  % of  % of    % of \n  Firms  Firms  Firms  Firms  Firms \nTotal  Total  Total  Total  Total \nRegistered Capital  (no.)

As  more  SMEs  enter  the  formal  sector,  tax  revenues  will  rise  and  provide  the \nGovernment  with  greater  budgetary  resources  that  can  in  part  be  used  to  improve  social \nservices. SMEs tend to be more labor intensive than large enterprises, and so create more job \nopportunities per unit of capital invested. Their development will help absorb the one million or \nso new entrants to the Vietnamese labor market each year.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \nlimited companies, 42.4% of shareholding (joint stock) companies, and 65.9% of SOEs.

The road map of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) brings together all aspects \nof SME development in Viet Nam. It aims to be comprehensive in coverage, and to identify \nshort-, medium- and long-term actions for the government, the private sector, and aid agencies \nto ensure rapid growth in the SME sector. The road map is also expected to serve as the basis \nfor the Government\u2019s SME development action program.   \n2.  After a brief review of the status of the SME sector in Viet Nam and current external \nsupport  to  the  sector,  the  SME  road  map  makes  a  diagnostic  analysis  that  covers  three \ninterrelated areas: \n(i)  The business environment. This covers the creation of an appropriate policy, \nlegal, and regulatory framework for enterprise growth; \n(ii)  Access to resources. This covers access of enterprises to essential resources \n(infrastructure, human resources, and finance in particular); and \n(iii)  Enterprise support. This addresses the provision of enterprise support services \nwhere there is market failure. \n3.  In each case, the present situation in Viet Nam and the issues and constraints are \ndescribed, a future vision based on best practice is identified, and the short-, medium- and long-\nterm reform agenda are proposed. \n4.  The diagnostic analysis of the business environment covers \n(i)  policy and its institutionalization, including matters pertaining to SMEs in the \nnational  development  plan,  role  of  the  Government,  organizational \nresponsibilities  in  the  Government,  stakeholder  consultation,  Government \nsupport policies, and policy evaluation; and \n(ii)  the legal and regulatory framework, including matters pertaining to enterprise \nestablishment and operation, financial reporting, taxation, contracts and dispute \nsettlement, bankruptcy, land use, technical standards, banking and finance, and \ncompetition. \n5.  The diagnostic analysis of access to resources covers \n(i)  nonfinancial resources, including matters pertaining to land and property, and \nhuman resources with reference to enterprise education, enterprise culture, and \nlabor markets; and \n(ii)  access  to  finance,  including  matters  pertaining  to  equity  financing,  lending, \nleasing, and guarantee schemes. \n6.  The diagnostic analysis of enterprise support covers business development services, \nincluding  training,  consultancy  and  advisory  services,  marketing,  market  information  and \npromotion,  technology  information,  technology  development  and  transfer,  and  business \nlinkages.

In conclusion the SME road map draws together a consolidated analysis of the visions \nand  the  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term  reform  plans  in  each  of  three  areas.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nThe Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) targets reduction of poverty incidence \nby approximately 12 percentage points between 2001 and 2010. This will be achieved through an average annual \neconomic growth rate of 7.5%, social progress and equity in income distribution, and development of corruption-free \nand efficient state functions. Given the slower growth prospect of the agriculture sector, relative decline of foreign \ndirect investments to gross domestic product (GDP), and the pressing need to restructure the state-owned enterprise \n(SOE) sector, the Government now regards the private sector as the main engine for the next round of economic \ngrowth and employment generation. The Government expects the activities of the private sector, which consists \nmostly of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to lead economic growth. Under Comprehensive Poverty \nReduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS), the private/SME sector has created and is expected to continue to create \n90% of the 1.5 million new jobs annually to 2010. Development of the private/SME sector is also expected to expand \nthe tax base for Viet Nam, thus increasing the opportunity for social spending. Due to the importance the Government \nplaces on developing the private/SME sector for economic growth and poverty reduction, many policy actions \nsupported under the SME Development Program Loan (SDPL) are also specified in the CPRGS as requisite reform \nmeasures. The poverty analysis section below identifies policy actions proposed under the SDPL that are also \nincluded in the CPRGS. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Poverty Classification: Others \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe goal of the SDPL is to improve SMEs competitiveness and enhance their potential contribution to \neconomic growth and employment generation, to enable them to help reduce poverty incidence in the country. The \nobjective  is  to  support  the  Government  in  undertaking  measures  to  (i)  enhance  SMEs\u2019  policy  and  regulatory \nframework, (ii) improve SMEs\u2019 access to key financial and physical resources, and (iii) facilitate SMEs\u2019 access to \ndomestic and international markets. Policy conditions proposed under the SDPL are specific to achieving the Program \nobjectives. Each was reviewed in terms of its outcomes and expected economic and social impacts as summarized \nbelow.  \n \nI.   Developing an Enabling Policy and Regulatory Environment \n \nPolicy actions proposed for developing an enabling policy and regulatory environment for SMEs fall under \ntwo components: (A) improving the current business registration and licensing systems, and (B) establishing the \nGovernment's policy and institutional framework for SME development through a coordinated plan based on public-\nprivate partnership. Policy actions under component (A) include measures for simplifying registration and licensing \nprocedures so as to make establishment of new businesses easier and encourage businesses to enter the formal \nsector. Such measures are identified under the CPRGS as requirements for poverty reduction. The proposed \ncomputerization  of  business  registration  will  do  away  with  arbitrary  administrative  procedures,  promote  good \ngovernance, reduce transaction costs for SMEs, and increase accessibility. Ex ante regulatory impact review will \nensure that unnecessary licenses that discourage SME establishment and growth are reconsidered, while ex post \nreview will provide feedback to policymakers on measures adopted for improvement. A simple and transparent \nregulatory regime will reduce the costs for establishing businesses and complying with statutory rules and regulations, \nand help accelerate the growth of the SME sector and create new employment opportunities, including those for the \npoor. The policy actions will also support good governance and combat corruption, both acknowledged in the region \nas crucial in fighting poverty. \n \nPolicy actions under component (B) supports the inclusion of private sector members to the SME Promotion \nCouncil to ensure that SMEs' views are better represented in policy making and program formulation. The long-term \nSME development action program to be adopted by the Government will provide a comprehensive basis to address \nmany constraints to SME development, facilitating establishment and operations of SMEs, and giving them access to \nkey resources. The action program is expected to serve as a guideline for interministerial and aid coordination.  \n(The Poverty Partnership Agreement was signed on 25 February 2002. Poverty incidence has declined from 37% in\n1998 to 29% in 2002.) ", "  Appendix 6  63\nTo enhance information flow to the SMEs, component (B) also supports the establishment of an on-line SME-\ninformation web site (\u201cinformation gateway\u201d), which includes (i) information on market, government regulations, and \nother topics of interest to SMEs; (ii) an SME statistical database; and (iii) linkages with the General Statistical Office \nand the National Business Information Network. The direct impact will be more effectively planned and executed \npolicies and programs, availability of comprehensive information for SMEs through the gateway, and heightened \npublic awareness of the SME sector. Lack of information on SMEs has been identified as a major constraint to be \naddressed under the CPRGS and a two-way information flow is a requisite reform measure. Cost for accessing \ninformation on regulations relevant to SMEs, and programs and services available to SMEs will be minimum and will \nbe affordable to the poor. However, equipment and some technical knowledge will be required to access the \ninformation.  \n  \nII.   Enhancing SME's Access to Finance \n \nEnhancing SME's access to finance has four components: (A) reducing the costs and risks of lending to \nSMEs by developing an SME accounting system, (B) reducing the costs and risks of lending to SMEs by making land-\nuse certificates available as collateral, (C) improving SMEs' access to finance through expansion of the use of leasing, \nand (D) reducing costs and risks of lending secured by movable property. Under component (A), proposed policy \nactions include issuance of clarifications on Decisions 1177 and 144 on the Accounting System for SMEs in \naccordance with the new Accounting Law; a simplified and clear SME accounting system based on Vietnamese and \nInternational Accounting Standards; and the Vietnamese Accounting Association (VAA) and its SME Accounting \nCenter to develop a program to disseminate and train SMEs and business associations on SME accounting. \nSimplifying the accounting system will assist SME owners and managers to better plan for and manage their limited \nresources. An accounting system that is easy to understand and apply will also encourage formalization of enterprises \nand reduce costs for preparing financial statements and thereby enable SMEs to access credit from banks and other \nformal financial institutions. Accounting systems are the basis of good corporate governance and better business risk \nmanagement. A simplified accounting system will support the establishment and growth of SMEs, and creation of \nmore jobs. It will also allow the Government to expand its tax base and increase social spending to aid the poor.  \n \nPolicy actions proposed under component (B) aims to make the legislative framework for land simple and \ntransparent. It will benefit SMEs and the poor alike as the law becomes easier to understand and its registration \nprocess simple and transparent. The centralized land registration system will be computerized so as to streamline the \nsystem for the benefit of the public as a whole, including the poor. A single land use registry will ensure clarity and \nsecurity of title, and improve the use of land as collateral. The cost of land registration and accessing information on \nland will be minimum and will be affordable to the poor. However, equipment and some technical knowledge will be \nrequired  for  accessing  information  on  land.  Developing  a  functional  land  market  will  remove  distortions  and \npreferential access to land. Market-based pricing of land will improve valuation for purposes of collateral. The \neconomy on the whole will benefit through more efficient allocation of resources, lower transaction costs, and greater \ninvestment to improve sites and premises. Market-based valuation of land is likely to increase tax revenues from land \nto enable the Government to increase spending on the poor. A modernized land management system by the \nGovernment will further promote good governance and combat corruption, crucial in fighting poverty. \n \nPolicy actions proposed under components (C) and (D) will expand the use of leasing and movable \ncollaterals to enable SMEs to access credit. The leasing industry, while still small in size relative to the banking sector, \npredominantly serves the SMEs by financing equipment. Policy actions support diversification of leasing products and \nsources of funding for leasing companies. Improved operational viability of the leasing sector, and creation of an \nalternative source of funding for leasing companies in particular, will help expand the coverage of leasing companies. \nEnhanced operation of the National Registry for Secured Transactions (NRAST) will, on the other hand, support the \nuse of equipment, inventories, and receivables as collateral for bank loans, also aiding SMEs in accessing credit \nthrough formal financial institutions. Moreover, the economic gains expected from higher use of NRAST is far-\nreaching, as it will benefit not only the SMEs but all entities involved in extending credit backed by collateral.  \n \nThe policy actions under the four components aim to resolve SMEs limited access to finance, long-term \nfinancing in particular, and thereby promote sustainable growth of SMEs. The benefits of simple, transparent, and \neffective frameworks of accounting, land registration, leasing, and secured transactions system will be felt by all \nenterprises. The proposed policy actions will support good governance and sustainable economic growth, and make \npositive contributions toward poverty reduction. \n \nIII.  Improving SME's Access to Land by Completing the Legal Framework for Land \n \nThe SDPL supported the enactment of a new land law, which includes (i) issuance of a uniform system of \nland-use certificates; (ii) simplified land registration; (iii) requiring information on land availability to be made public; \nand (iv) promoting property market development. To support the implementation of the new Land Law, and to further ", " 64 Appendix 6 \nencourage  formalization  of  landholding,  an  implementing  decree  to  the  new  Land  Law  will  be  issued.  The \nimplementing decree will include (i) legal leasing of the land by existing tenants subject to their compliance with \nregulations, and (ii) administrative penalties against government officials who fail to make public information on land \nuse planning and zoning information as required by the Land Law. Simplified and transparent procedures for assigning \nof land or leasing land to SMEs will improve SMEs\u2019 access to land. A modernized legal framework for land and land \nadministration is a requirement under the CPRGS and is expected to promote good governance and to combat \ncorruption related to land use, known to negatively impact the poor in particular.  \n \nTo enhance access to land and also to encourage a more active market for land use, a circular on the new \nLand Law will be issued. The circular will include (i) uniform procedures for all local agencies on issuance of land-use \nrights certificates and subsequent registration of land-use rights, and (ii) uniform information collection on the issued \nland-use rights certificates by all local agencies. Increased transparency and consistency will result in more efficient \nuse of land, lower transaction costs, and better access to land by SMEs. An on-line system for disseminating \ninformation on land will be made available to the public and affordable to the poor. However, access to equipment and \ntechnical knowledge will be required to retrieve the information. \n \nIV.  Improving SME's Access to International Markets through Enhanced Industrial and Technical Standards \n \nThere are two components for improving SME's access to international markets through enhanced industrial \nand technical standards: (A) lowering the structural barrier on industrial and technical standards for SMEs by \ncompleting the legal framework, and (B) undertaking institutional reforms and encouraging public-private partnership \u2013 \nincluding an information system for SMEs. Component (A) includes policy actions for: reducing regulatory compliance \nburdens on technical standards, a draft Ordinance on Technical Standardization to develop a uniform standardization \nsystem; enhancing public confidence in the certification institutions by requiring that any certification body operating in \nViet Nam must be accredited by an Accreditation Body that is a mutual recognition agreement signatory member of \nthe International Accreditation Forum, or Pacific Accreditation Cooperation, or by Viet Nam's Board of Accreditation; \nand bringing standardization in line with best practices by supporting submission of an Ordinance on Technical \nStandardization to the National Assembly.  An improved standards' framework will reduce the costs of compliance, \nfacilitate  comparison  of  products  by  consumers,  and  generally  allow  for  better  compliance  with  standards  by \nenterprises, including SMEs. Arbitrary setting of standards, which increases compliance costs, will be reduced and \napplication of international standards and accreditation practices will boost public confidence as well as the potential \nfor higher exports. The overall impact will be enhanced competitiveness of SMEs, and increased opportunities to \naccess domestic, regional, and international markets. \n \nPolicy actions under component (B) include an on-line database, providing information to the SMEs on (i) \nnational standards of other countries, international standards, and cross-recognition schemes; (ii) certification bodies, \ntesting laboratories, and quality management providers in Viet Nam; and (iii) relevant information on technology \ntransfer, legally separating Directorate for Standards and Quality\u2019s (STAMEQ\u2019s) commercial and state administrative \nactivities and ensuring SME representation on the National Technical Committee of Standardization and on the \nindustry technical committees of standardization for standards development. The extensive database on technical and \nindustrial standards will aid the SMEs in becoming more aware of and making informed efforts toward meeting those \nstandards. This will facilitate their access to both domestic and international markets. The separation of commercial \nand administrative functions will improve corporate governance, increase competition, and promote public confidence \nin standards and testing. SME\u2019s representation on the National Technical Committee and industry committees will help \nto make the standards increasingly appropriate for SMEs.  \n \nThe measures proposed under this component will result in a more pragmatic, efficient, and transparent \nprocess for setting standards and obtaining certifications. SMEs will benefit from reduced compliance costs and higher \ncapacity to access both domestic and international markets. Increased level of exports by SMEs will support the \nviability of their long-term operations and contribute toward economic growth and poverty reduction. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe impacts of the SDPL on economic growth and employment generation are assessed to be significantly \npositive. No adverse impact requiring mitigating measures was identified.  \n  Given the current limitations on data collection, quantifying the impact of the Program and the proposed \npolicy actions on the poor is extremely difficult. This serious obstacle in monitoring the economic and social impact of \nthe Program will be overcome through (i) the establishment of the National Business Information Network, and (ii) \nannual reports on the status of SMEs, both supported under the SDPL. The Program will closely monitor outcomes, \nand economic and social impacts throughout its implementation to ensure that there are no adverse impacts to the \npoor and the vulnerable.

Rationale and Objectives \n1.  The TA on capacity building for small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development \nwill support the implementation of the first subprogram of the SME development program loan \n(SDPL) cluster. The goal is to help the Government create a business environment conducive to \nSME development by (i) providing specific and detailed technical inputs based on international \nbest practices, where appropriate; (ii) formulating specific programs to support capacity-building \nefforts of the Government; and (iii) developing ways to effectively disseminate the findings and \nrelated information to ensure effective participation from the private sector. \n \nB.  Scope \n2.  The TA is expected to focus on three major components: (i) providing technical, legal, \nand policy-related assistance to the reform agenda based on international best practices, where \nappropriate; (ii) formulating and delivering institution-building activities, including governance \nreform and pilot implementation of new systems; and (iii) developing a systematic approach to \ntraining  and  information  dissemination.  These  components  aim  to  help  SMEs  address \nconstraints in accessing domestic and international markets. More specifically, the expected \noutputs of the TA fall under four groups. \n \n(i)  The  SME  development  action  program.  The  outputs  include  a  long-term, \ninterministerial  development  framework  for  SMEs,  to  be  adopted  by  the \nGovernment,  with  an  information  system  for  effective  dissemination,  and  an \nimplementing guideline on Decree 90.  \n \n(ii)  Business  registration  and  licensing  reform.  The  outputs  include  a  legal  and \ninstitutional framework to enhance the current regulatory regime. \n \n(iii)  An SME accounting system. The outputs include the system itself and a training \nand dissemination program for the SME sector and accounting professionals in \nViet Nam. \n \n(iv)  A registration system for immovable and movable assets. The outputs include a \nlegal and institutional framework for the registries and pilot implementation.  \n \n3.  The TA will comprise two phases. In phase 1, the following technical documents will be \ndrafted: (i) the SME development framework (action program); (ii) a business licensing system \nand  plan  for  expansion  of  National  Business  Information  Network  (NBIN);  (iii)  an  SME \naccounting  system;  and  (iv)  an  enhanced  framework  for  use  of  movable  and  immovable \ncollaterals \u2013 including a land price valuation system, in consultation with the Government and \nprivate  sector  representatives  concerned.  On  the  basis  of  the  frameworks,  phase  2  will \nundertake the related implementation components, including the operations of NBIN and land \nregistration.   \n \nC.  Methodology and Key Activities \n4.  The TA will fund consultants with expertise in the SME sector and related areas (paras. \n2\u20133).  They  will  conduct  in-depth  consultations  with  the  Government  and  private  sector \n ", "68 Appendix 8 \nstakeholders. A consultative approach, which is an integral part of the process to produce \ntargeted outputs, will be followed by a number of roundtable discussions and workshops for \nskills and knowledge transfer needed to implement the policy conditions under the SDPL. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will monitor the process closely to ensure the quality of outputs, \nincluding training. \n \n5.  The consultants will prepare a detailed work plan before the start of services, which will \ninclude a timetable for deliverables defined under each component of the TA. The consultants \nwill be required to submit interim reports within the deadline specified in the work plan agreed \nupon with ADB. All reports will be reviewed by the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), \nthe Implementing Agencies (IAs), and ADB. Draft final reports will be submitted within the \ndeadline specified in the work plans after incorporation of feedback from MPI, IAs, and ADB. \nTripartite  meetings  will  be  held  before  finalizing  the  draft  final  reports.  The  final  report, \nincorporating comments from MPI, IAs, and ADB during and after the tripartite meetings, should \nbe submitted upon completion of service. The TA is scheduled to begin in November 2004 and \nto be completed by August 2005. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n6.  The TA is estimated to cost a total of $1,625,000 equivalent, comprising $1,220,000 in \nforeign exchange and $405,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $1,400,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $180,000 \nequivalent of the local currency costs. The TA is financed from ADB\u2019s TA funding program \n($500,000) and is cofinanced by both Danish Consultancy Trust Fund ($300,000) and Swiss \nConsultant  Trust  Fund  ($600,000).  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  $225,000 \nequivalent of the local currency costs, including provision of counterpart staff, office space, \nadministrative services, and physical facilities. The cost estimates and the financing plan are in \nTable  A8.  ADB  will  engage  a  team  of  international  and  domestic  consultants  to  provide \nconsulting services of 74 person-months. Where deemed necessary for expeditious provision of \nassistance to the implementing agencies, ADB may also consider engagement of individual \nconsultants. The contract with the consultants will be based on the quality- and cost-based \nselection process and the simplified technical proposal will be used. Procurement under the TA \nwill be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The terms of reference for the \nconsultants  are  in  the  supplementary  appendix.
