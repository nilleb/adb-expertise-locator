The  SDPL  adopts  a  process-\noriented  approach  and  is  designed  to  systematically  identify  and \nresolve  issues  and  constraints  on  business,  particularly  on  SMEs, \nthrough \nstakeholder \nconsultation. \n \nCreation  of  an  enabling  business  environment  in  Viet  Nam  is \nchallenging due to deficiencies common to developing economies in \ntransition.  Many  key  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  frameworks  in \nsupport  of  business  operations  have  yet  to  be  completed.  Also,  a \npolicy bias favoring public sector entities remains. In selecting areas \nto be covered by the SDPL, priority was given to those assessed to \n\nintergovernmental \n\ncoordination \n\nand \n\n                                                 \n1   Following the Board approval of the R-Paper on Review of ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy, staff instructions to \nreplace the PI/CPI classification with a new tracking system are under preparation in line with paragraph 84 of the \nR-Paper. \n\n\f \nObjective and \nScope \n\n \n\niii\n\ntransactions, and \n\nto  ADB's  past  and  ongoing  operations,  and \n\nbe  (i)  significant  for  SMEs'  current  business  operations,  (ii)  backed \nby Government commitment to reform in line with best practices, (iii) \nlinked \n(iv) \ncomplementary to activities of other aid agencies. \n \nFormulation  of  the  SDPL  is  based  on  an  in-depth  analysis  and \ndiscussions with the Government of each component over a period \nof  9  months.  In  particular,  policy  measures  proposed  under  the \nSDPL were discussed extensively with Government officials at both \nthe technical and decision-making levels, with highly technical inputs \nfrom  experts  in  the  fields  of  SME  policy,  land,  leasing,  registration \nsystems,  secured \ntechnical  standards.  The \ndiscussions  culminated  in  agreement  with  the  Government  on  the \nobjective  and  expected impact  of  undertaking clearly  defined  policy \nactions, conforming to best international practices. \n \nMany  measures  adopted  under  the  SDPL  support  the  Government \nin  undertaking  market-friendly interventions  and  eliminating  policy \nbias  against  SMEs,  thus  strengthening  the  environment  for  private \nsector development. Beneficiaries of such measures are expected to \ninclude the poor and the near poor. \n \nThe objective of the SDPL is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to \ncreate a business environment that is conducive to economic growth \nand  employment  generation.  To  achieve  this  objective,  the  SDPL \nfocuses on the following: \n \n(i) \n\nEnhancing  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework.  (a)\nImproving  the  business  registration  and  licensing  systems \nby  implementing  a  uniform  and  consistent  registration \nprocedure  nationwide,  and  streamlining  business  licensing \nprocedures;  (b)  establishing  the  Government\u2019s  institutional \nframework  for  SME  development,  for  effective  monitoring \nand  evaluation  of  the  sector.  Policies  and  programs  will  be \nbased  on  a  comprehensive  database  on  the  SME  sector \nand  a  coordinated  SME  development  strategy;  and  (c) \npromoting  closer  public-private  sector  partnership  and \nproviding  systems  that  make information  on  government \nregulations on enterprises easily accessible to the public.  \n\n \n(ii) \n\nImproving SMEs\u2019 access to resources (finance and land \nuse  rights).  (a)  Reducing  the  costs and  risks of  lending  to \nSMEs  by  developing  an  SME  accounting  system; \nestablishing  land  registration  and  valuation  methods  to \nimprove the use of land-use rights certificates as collateral; \nand  supporting  the  use  of  movable  properties  as  collateral\nthrough  a  functioning  secured  transactions  registry;  (b) \nimproving  the  operational  environment  of  financial  leasing \ncompanies by expanding the types of leasing products and \ndiversifying  their  funding  source;  and  (c)  completing  legal \nand  institutional  frameworks  for  market-based  transactions \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n(iii) \n\nrights  certificates,  making \n\non land by establishing the legal basis for issuance of land-\nuse \nland \naccessible to the public, and promoting good governance in \nadministrative procedures.  \n\ninformation  on \n\nFacilitating  SMEs\u2019  access  to \ninternational  markets \n(industrial/technical  standards).  Lowering  the  structural \nbarrier on industrial and technical standards for SMEs by (a) \ncompleting  the  legal  framework  on  industrial  and  technical \nstandards, \nreforms  of \ncertification  bodies  and  ensuring  SME  representation  in \nsetting standards, and (c) making information on standards\nreadily available to the public. \n\n(b)  undertaking \n\ninstitutional \n\n \nThe Program framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  SDPL  adopts  the  program  cluster  approach  with  two  back-to-\nback subprograms totaling $100 million. Subprogram I loan amount \nwill be for $60 million and subprogram II will be processed upon the \nsuccessful completion of subprogram I. \n \nSubprogram  I  of  SDPL  will  be  drawn  from  the  Asian  Development \nFund,  which  will  have  a  repayment  period  of  24  years,  including  a \ngrace  period  of  8  years,  and  carry  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter. \nSubprogram  I  will  be  implemented  within  18  months  after  loan \neffectiveness. \n \nSubprogram  II  will  be  presented  for  Board  consideration,  based  on \nprogress  in  implementing  subprogram  I.  Policy  conditions  for \nsubprogram  II  are  subject  to  revision  to  reflect  the  Government\u2019s \nachievements and changing policy environment. Subprograms II will \nbe implemented within 18 months after loan effectiveness. \n \nThe  program  cluster  comprises  two  programs  and  subprogram  I \ncomprises two tranches. The period for implementing subprogram I \nwill  be  18  months  from  loan  effectiveness.  The  first  tranche  will  be \nreleased  upon  compliance  with  the  first  tranche  release  conditions \nand  the  second  upon  completion  of  policy  actions  proposed  for \nsecond tranche release. Implementation of subprogram I is planned \nfor November 2004 to May 2006. The final review for subprogram I, \nsecond tranche release, is expected to coincide with subprogram II \nloan fact-finding.  \n \nThe Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) will be the Executing \nAgency for the SDPL.  \n \nThe  proceeds  of  the  SDPL will  be  disbursed  for  a  broad  range  of \nimports, subject to a negative list of ineligible items. All procurement \nof  goods  and  services  produced  in  and  originating  from  member \ncountries  of  ADB  will  be  made  with  due  consideration  to  economy \n\n \nProgram Period and  \nTranching \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nProcurement \n\n\f \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\nv\n\nand efficiency in accordance with standard public sector procedures \nin  Viet  Nam  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices, \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  Borrower  will  certify  that  the  value  of  total \nimports  minus  (i)  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  (ii)  ineligible \n(iii)  disbursements  made  under  other  official \nimports,  and \ndevelopment assistance, is greater than the amount expected to be \ndisbursed during the year. ADB will have the right to audit the use of \nthe  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Borrower's \ncertification. \n \nThe  policy  framework  for  the  SDPL  includes  specific  components \nthat  bear  distinct  costs  of  structural  adjustments.  The  Government \nhas  provided  assurances  that  necessary funding  will  be  made \navailable to cover these costs. \n \nTo  coordinate  program \nimplementation  among  government \nministries  and  agencies  concerned,  a  program  steering  committee \n(PSC) will be formed. The PSC, chaired by a deputy minister of MPI, \nwill  comprise  senior  officers  from  all  ministries  and  government \nagencies  concerned (Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources  and  Environment,  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology, \nMinistry of Justice, and State Bank of Viet Nam). The PSC will meet \nat least twice a year to review pending issues and propose concrete \nactions for their resolution to ensure timely program implementation.\n \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  TA  for  capacity \nbuilding  for  SME  development  for  $1.4  million.  The  TA  will  be \nfinanced  by  ADB  ($500,000),  Danish  Consultancy  Trust  Fund \n($300,000) and Swiss Consultant Trust Fund ($600,000), in support \nof  SDPL  implementation.  The  TA  will  focus  on  (i)  technical,  legal, \nand  policy-related  assistance  to  the  reform  agenda  based  on \ninternational  experience;  (ii)  institution-building  activities,  including \nfostering good governance and pilot implementation of new systems; \nand (iii) new approaches to training and information dissemination.  \n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  There are three principal risks in implementing the SDPL. The first is \nin  effective  coordination  and  cooperation  within  the  Government, \nboth  horizontally  among  different  ministries  and  agencies \nconcerned,  and  vertically  with  the  provincial  and  district  authorities. \nConsultation  and  coordination  with  the  private  sector  and  the  aid \ncommunity  active  in  SME  development  will  also  be  required.  It  is \nexpected that coordination and cooperation among all stakeholders \nwill  gradually  improve  along  with  the  increased  capacity  of  the \nAgency for SME Development within the MPI, thus reducing the risk \nof overlap and inconsistencies in SME support activities.  \n \nA second risk pertains to good governance of the central, provincial,\nand  district  governments.  Governance  at  the  provincial  and  district \nlevels is particularly important given the fact that the positive impact \nof  the  SDPL  will  be  felt  only  through  effective  implementation  of \npolicies  at  the  ground  level.  These  risks  are  common  to  several \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n \n\nprograms  and  are  being  addressed  through  the  implementation  of \nthe  comprehensive  Public  Administration  Reform  Master  Program \nfor 2001\u20132010, which is being supported by ADB. \n \nA  third  risk  relates  to  the  technical  capacities  of  implementing \nagencies.  Experience  suggests  that, given  adequate  technical \nsupport,  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  reforms  is  strong.  In \nimplementing \ncaused \nprograms, \npredominantly by the lack of technical expertise and the consensus \nbuilding  approach  taken  in  enactment  of  laws  and  regulations.  To \nreduce  this  risk, the  TA  has  been  formulated  through  discussions \nwith  all \nlevel.  Many \nrequirements pertain  to completing  the  legal  framework  and  putting \nin  place  modern  information  technology-based  systems,  taking  into \nconsideration the experience of other countries. The SDPL will also \ninvolve coordination with aid agencies active in the respective areas \nof each component.  \n\nimplementing  agencies  at \n\ndelays  were \n\ntechnical \n\nprevious \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nprogram  cluster  concept  for  the  Small  and  Medium-sized  Enterprise  (SME)  Development \nProgram  Loan  (SDPL),  and  (ii)  a  proposed  loan  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for \nsubprogram  I  of  the  SDPL.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nCapacity Building for SME Development, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will  approve  (i)  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) administering a portion of the TA not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 and $600,000 \nto  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Government  of  Denmark  and  the  Government  of \nSwitzerland,  respectively;  and  (ii)  ADB  providing  the  balance  of  the  TA,  not  exceeding  the \nequivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n2. \nViet  Nam  is  a  country  of  about  80  million  people,  the  majority  (approximately  76%)  of \nwhom live in rural areas. Although still one of the poorest countries in the region, Viet Nam has \nmade  steady  progress  toward  adoption  of  a  market-oriented  economy  (through  Doi  Moi  or \neconomic renovation since 1986) and has achieved rapid economic growth. Viet Nam\u2019s average \ngross domestic product (GDP) growth rate (7.7%) during the 1990s marked the second fastest \ngrowth in the region, after the People\u2019s Republic of China (10.1%).1 In 2003, Viet Nam posted a \nGDP growth of 7.1%. Per capita GDP increased from $361 in 1997 to $426 in 2002 (Table 1). \nAlthough  the  share  of  foreign  direct  investment  to  GDP  declined  recently,  exports  have \ncontinued  to  rise.  Gross  domestic  savings  and  capital  formation  also  increased  during  the \nperiod.   \n\n \nTable 1: Basic Economic Indicators \n \n1999\n\n1997\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002 \n\n$361\n8.2\n25.8\n32.1\n42.2\n11,683\n  9,185\n 10,432\n   34.5\n   23.6\n     2.9\n     7.8\n\n2003\n74.3 million 76.6 million  77.6 million  78.7 million 79.7 million  80.9 million\n454.8b\n7.1\n21.8\n40.0\n38.2\n15,732\n20,176\n25,227\n41.2\n23.1\n4.6\n13.2\n\nItem \nPopulation \nGDP per Capita \nGDP Growtha \n   Agriculture (%) \n   Industry (%) \n   Service (%) \nExchange Rate (D per $1)  \nExport ($ million) \nImport ($ million) \nLabor Force (million)  \n   Agriculture (million) \n   Industry (million) \n   Service (million) \nGDP = gross domestic product. \na Refers to annual percentage change. \nb Staff estimate. \nSource: ADB. 2004.

The export of manufactured goods has also increased although commodities \n(such as crude oil, rice, and coffee) are still the leading exports. It is important to note that the \nrise in industry sector has not increased employment in the sector. Agriculture, despite its recent \ndecline, remains the top employer of the Vietnamese labor force.     \n \n\nTable 2: Comparison by Economic Sectors in 2002 \n \n\n \nState-Owned \nSector \n\n \nPrivate \nSector \n\nForeign \nInvestment \nSector \n13 \n14 \n19 \n  1 \n3,000 \n0 \n\nShare of GDP (%) \n2002 Annual GDP (industrial) Growth Rate  \nShare of Total Investment  \nShare of Employmenta\nEstimated Number of Companies  \n   Of which are SMEs  \nGDP = gross domestic product, SME = small and medium-sized enterprise.  \na  Statistics for 2001.  \nb  Of the 89%, it is estimated that about 70% comes from household enterprises. \nc  In  addition,  it  is  estimated  that  there  are  40,000  cooperatives,  2.4  million  household  enterprises,  and  13,000 \n\n      48  \n      20 \n      29 \n       89b\n90,000c\n   85,000 \n\n 39 \n 12 \n 52 \n 10 \n5,200 \n3,000 \n\nagricultural farms (enterprises). \n\nSource: Data provided by the Ministry of Planning and Investment. \n \n4. \nThe  Government  has  had  an  active  privatization  program,  but  the  economy  is  still \ndominated  by  the  state  sector,  which  accounted  for  39%  of  output  and  for  over  50%  of  total \ninvestment  in  2002  (Table  2).  Furthermore,  while  the  foreign  investment  sector  has  been \nimportant  for  Viet  Nam\u2019s  growth,  it  is  the  domestic  private  sector  that  has  led  economic \ndevelopment  since  2000,  with  an  annual  growth  rate  of  almost  20%  (18.7%  in  2003).  For  the \ndomestic private sector to continue its growth, however, the Government will need to accelerate \nits efforts in establishing an enabling business environment in Viet Nam. \n  \n5. \nThe macroeconomic outlook for Viet Nam is generally favorable. The ADB projects GDP \ngrowth  of  7.5%  for  2004  and  7.6%  for  2005.  Although  macroeconomic  performance  has  been \nfavorable, restructuring the state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector is considered critical to sustain \nthe high growth rates of recent years. Furthermore, maintaining macroeconomic stability and a \nrelatively high level of economic growth rate would be a requisite for achieving the development \ngoals  outlined \nthe \nComprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS).  \n \n\nthe  10-year  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP) 2   and \n\nin \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Analysis \n\n6. \nSMEs are defined as businesses and production establishments that have a registered \ncapital  of  less  than  D10  billion  (about  $670,000)  or  an  average  number  of  annual  permanent \nemployees of less than 300, or both. It is estimated that more than 90% of all private enterprises \nare SMEs.   \n \n7. \nIt has been estimated that about 90,000 formal private SMEs currently operating in Viet \nNam have been registered in accordance with the Enterprise Law. Of the 736,000 enterprises \n\n                                                 \n2   SEDP was approved by the 9th Party Congress in April 2001. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 3\n\n(including  household  enterprises)  registered  in  all  sectors  as  of  31  December  2002, \napproximately  648,000  were  small  and  household  enterprises  without  tax  codes.  Of  the \nenterprises with tax codes, 84,731 had a registered capital of less than D10 billion while 85,169 \nhad less than 300 employees. Thus, on both criteria of registered capital and average number \nof employees, SMEs account for over 99.6% of the total number of registered enterprises. Even \nwhen  household  enterprises  are  excluded,  it  can  be  deduced  that  more  than  90%  of  the \ncompanies  registered  under  the  Enterprise  Law  are  SMEs.

A summary of the road map is in \nAppendix  3.  First,  in  preparing  the  road  map,  a  number  of  surveys  were  reviewed,  and \ndiscussions were  held  with  the  SMEs,  private  sector  representatives,  Government  officials,  as \nwell  as  other  stakeholders  to  understand  their  perception of  the  major priorities  for  the  sector. \nSecond, a comprehensive review was undertaken to discuss the status of current reforms and \nmajor  development  plans  of  the  Government.  Third,  aid  activities  were  studied  so  as  to  avoid \noverlaps and to seek synergies where possible.   \n \n9. \nThrough these steps, a comprehensive diagnostic analysis was produced to identify the \nmajor  constraints  in  the  sector.  The  road  map  emphasizes  the  importance  of  an  enabling \nbusiness  environment  and  the  need  for  comprehensive  legal  and  institutional  development  for \nViet Nam. The road map categorizes the main issues in three interrelated areas:  \n \n\nbusiness  regulatory  environment,  covering  the  creation  of  an  appropriate \npolicy, legal, and regulatory framework for enterprises; \n\naccess  to  resources,  dealing  with  enterprises'  access  to  essential  resources,  \nincluding infrastructure, human, and financial resources in particular; and \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2002. Preparing SME Development Program. Manila (approved for $650,000 on 13 December 2002). \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n\f4\n\n \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nenterprise  support,  addressing  methodologies  in  support  of  SMEs\u2019  efforts  for \ncapacity building, including access to domestic and foreign markets. \n\n \n10. \nIn  addition  to  numerous  roundtable  discussions  with  Government  agencies,  the  road \nmap  was  presented  to  the  private  sector  and  all  aid  agencies  active  in  SME  development  in \nworkshops  held  in  September  and  December  2003  in  Hanoi,  Viet  Nam.  Feedback  and \ncomments  from  participants  have  been  incorporated  in  the  final  road  map.  With  its \ncomprehensive  policy  recommendations  for  mid-  to  long-term  development  of  SMEs,  the  road \nmap  is  expected  to  be  the  basis  for  the  long-term,  interministerial  action  program  for  SME \ndevelopment to be adopted by the Government.   \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Issues \n\nBased on the analysis of the road map and consultations with stakeholders, key issues \n\n11. \nfor SME development in Viet Nam have been identified.  \n \n12. \nIncomplete  and  Inconsistent  Business  Registration  and  Licensing  Systems.  The \nEnterprise Law of 2000 promoted business registration and significantly reduced the time, cost \nand documentation for starting a business. After the enactment of the Enterprise Law, however, \nmore than 50 implementing guidelines were issued on the registration and licensing process at \ndifferent  provincial  and  district  levels.  Also,  10  decrees  containing  provisions  contradicting  the \nEnterprise  Law  have  been  identified.  Further  complicating  the  process is  the  inconsistent  new \nprovisions  for  simplified  business  registration,  with  some  provinces  not  approving  the \nestablishment of businesses permitted under the law. Both business registration and licensing \nsystems  are  not  unified  on  a  national  basis,  nullifying  many  of  the  benefits  of  the  Enterprise \nLaw. Many SMEs still suffer from inconsistent and inefficient business registration and licensing \nsystems; thus, compliance costs are increasing. \n \n13. \nAbsence  of  SME  Development  Policy  and  Coordination  Framework.  Although \nimportant  progress  has  been  made,  the  basic  framework  to  support  SME  development  is  still \nincomplete,  in  both  policies  and  institutions.  This  lack  of  a  policy  and  coordination  framework \nhas  resulted  in  contradictions  and  duplications  of  support  programs  provided  by  different \nGovernment ministries and agencies. It also constrains effective aid coordination. Furthermore, \nthere is no specific system for collecting data on the sector for purposes of policy formulation. \nProgress  to  date  in  upgrading  the  National  Business  Information  Network  (NBIN)4  has  been \nlimited, and there are currently no mechanisms to provide information to and collect information \nfrom SMEs.   \n \nLimited  Access  to  Financial  Resources.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  financial  sector  still  perceives \n14. \nfinancing for SMEs to be costly and highly risky. Hence, SMEs\u2019 access to financial resources is \nlimited  despite  the  fact  that  various  aid  agencies  have  a  number  of  credit  lines  for  the  sector. \nPriority must be given to developing a more sustainable system for SME financing by reducing \nthe  costs  and  risks  related  to  giving  credit  to  SMEs.  First,  recognizing  that  offering  collateral \nremains  an  important  means  for  SMEs  to  access  credit,  the  limited  access  to  land-use  rights \ncertificates  (LURCs)  for  use  as  collateral  must  be  overcome.  For  SMEs  to  better  utilize  the \n\n                                                 \n4   The  NBIN  was  established  through  the  Enterprise  Law.  Its  aim  is  to  collect  information  electronically  on  the \nenterprises  through  their  registration.  However,  NBIN  covers  only  about  30%  of  Viet  Nam,  and  thus  much  of  the \nneeded information remains unrecorded.   \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 5\n\ncertificates  as  collateral,  the  legal  and  administrative  framework  for  the  issuance  of  LURCs \nneeds to be improved. The registration of any subsequent transactions or exercise of land use \nrights (as immovable property) must be streamlined and made uniform throughout the country, \nwith an appropriate system to maintain records. The price valuation method of land also needs \nto be updated to give banks a better basis for pricing the collateral.5 For movable properties, an \neffective  secured  transactions  registry,  which  clearly  establishes  the  prioritization  of  creditors' \nand lien holders' rights upon registering their interest will facilitate SMEs\u2019 access to credit.    \n \nSecond, lack of collateral is compounded by lack of financial information on SMEs.  The \n15. \nfinancial reporting requirements are overly complex for SMEs. For example, the balance sheets \nand income statements for SMEs are comparable with those of large enterprises. Furthermore, \nthere  are  currently  25  accounting  books  and  39  supporting  documents  applicable  to  SMEs. \nThere  is  a  need  to  develop  a  more  simplified,  publicly  recognized,  and  uniformly  applied \naccounting system for SMEs. Finally, leasing can be an effective substitute for secured lending \nand  can  mitigate  the  higher  risk  of  providing  medium-term  financing  to  small  companies  that \nlack business track records and audited financial statements. Shortcomings in the Vietnamese \nlegal  and  policy  framework  for  leasing  limit  product  offerings  and  restrict  funding  sources. \nAmendments to the legal framework will give leasing companies more freedom in both product \noffering and sources of funding.  \n \nLimited  Access  to  Physical  Resource:  Land  Use.  Among  various  forms  of  physical \n16. \nresource,  land  use  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the  most  significant  barriers  to  SME \ndevelopment in Viet Nam. The Vietnamese legislative framework for land is complex.6 There is \nno  single  land  use  registry  covering  the  whole  country  and  registration  is  a  time-consuming \nprocess  involving  central,  provincial  and  district  authorities.  As  a  result,  most  SMEs  resort  to \nleasing land from SOEs.  \n  \n17. \nLimited  Access  to  International  Markets:  Technical  Standards. Although Viet Nam \nwill enter the World Trade Organization (WTO) regime and the SMEs will have greater access \nto  foreign  markets,  many  barriers  must  be  overcome  for  the  SMEs  to  fully  capitalize  on  this \nopportunity.  Regardless  of  WTO\u2019s  mandates  on  tariff  and  other  means  to  seek  trade \nliberalization,  Vietnamese  exports  need  to  conform  to  various  technical  standards  before  they \ncan  enter  foreign  markets.  Currently,  significant  gaps  exist  in  the  legislative  framework \nsurrounding both product quality and standardization and in the system for obtaining information \non standards or how to comply with them.   \n \nThe key issues identified above stem from fundamental and structural impediments that \n18. \nconfront  the  Vietnamese  economy  today.  First,  the  lack  of  basic  economic  and  business \ninfrastructure required for efficient functioning of a market-based economy, such as accounting \nstandards  (which  are  being  developed)  and  a  centralized  land  registry,  makes  SME \ndevelopment  exceptionally  challenging.  Second,  the  bias  toward  SOEs  causes  market \ndistortions,  often  creating  competitive  disadvantages  for  private  sector  SMEs,  although  recent \nofficial policy directions from the Government and the Communist Party have clearly stated that \nall enterprises should be treated equally. Third, in addition to key legal reforms and institutional \ndevelopments,  limited  provision  of  important  information  from  and  to  SMEs  is  a  significant \nbarrier to SME development. \n\n                                                 \n5 The price valuation currently administered by local people\u2019s committees does not take into consideration the actual \n\nmarket transactions of land.   \n\n6   A  significant  improvement  in  reducing  the  complexity  of  the  legislative  framework  will  be  achieved  with  the \n\npromulgation of the new Land Law (2003), effective July 2004. \n\n\f6\n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy \n\n19. \nThe  Government's  development  goals  and  poverty  reduction  targets  are  stated  in  the \nSEDP,  various  sector  strategies,  and  the  CPRGS.  The  CPRGS  targets  reduction  of  poverty \nincidence  by  approximately  12  percentage  points  between  2001  and  2010  through  increased \nefficiency in resource use, social progress and equity in income distribution, and development of \ncorruption-free and efficient state functions.  \n  \nCommunist  Party  Resolution  14/NQ-TW  (2002)  and  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Decision \n20. \n94/2002/QD-TTg  (2002)  formally  recognized  the  private  sector  as  an  important  pillar  for \neconomic  development  and  employment  generation.  Private  sector  SMEs  are  viewed  as  the \nmain  source  of  employment  generation  for  the  1.5  million  new  entrants  to  the  labor  market \nannually  to  2010.  Furthermore,  as  more  SMEs  become  formal,  tax-paying  enterprises,  their \ncontributions to government revenues are also expected to become significant.   \n \n21. \nTo support the private sector, the Government issued Decree 90/2001/ND-CP\u2013\u2013Support \nfor Development of SMEs (Decree 90)\u2013\u2013in November 2001 and officially recognized SMEs for \nthe first time in Viet Nam. Decree 90 provides a framework for the Government to support and \nencourage  private  sector  development  and  covers  the  establishment  of  (i)  an  SME  Promotion \nCouncil with cross-ministry membership to act as an advisory body to  the Prime Minister, and \n(ii)  the  Agency  for  SME  Development  in  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  (MPI)  to \ncoordinate SME-related activities. \n \n22. \nTo  further  support  Government  initiatives  for  private  sector  development,  the  SDPL \nprovides  assistance  for  (i)  completing  the  supporting  legal  and  policy  frameworks;  (ii) \nestablishing  efficient  mechanisms  for  coordination  among  various  government  ministries, \nagencies, and other stakeholders including the private sector; and (iii) effectively implementing \ncurrent legal and policy measures at the central, provincial, and local levels.     \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Asian Development Bank's Strategy and Operations in the Sector \n\nADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  (CSP)  (2002\u20132004)  for  Viet  Nam7  reiterates  the \n23. \nimportance of achieving sustainable growth to realize the overarching goal of poverty reduction. \nPreliminary  data  from  the  2002  Multipurpose  Household  Survey  show  a  decline  in  poverty \nincidence from 37% in 1998 to 29% in 2002 using an international poverty line.8 To support the \ncontinuation  of  the  country's  path  toward  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  ADB's \noperational strategy is committed to developing a vibrant private sector in Viet Nam through (i) \npromotion of agricultural diversification, (ii) establishment of an enabling business environment \nfor SMEs, and (iii) development of alternative channels of financial intermediation to banks. The \nSDPL is consistent with ADB's operational priorities and strategic focus for Viet Nam.  \n \n24. \nIn  its  past  operations,  ADB  has  provided  several  credit  lines  for  SMEs,  particularly  in \nconjunction  with  agricultural  development  projects  and  programs.  Also,  the  SOE  Reform  and \nCorporate  Governance  Program  Loan  (SCPL)9  initiated  policy  dialogues  with  the  Government \non  developing  a  dynamic  private  sector.  The  SDPL  builds  on  achievements  of  ADB \ninterventions  by  making  a  number  of  important  linkages  to  previous  and  ongoing  programs. \n                                                 \n7   ADB. 2002. Viet Nam: Country Strategy and Program. Manila (approved on 17 January 2002). \n8   Poverty had fallen 21 percentage points, from 58% to 37% during the previous 5-year period. \n9   ADB.  1999.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grants  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  State-owned  Enterprise  Reform  and \nCorporate Governance Program Loan. Manila (approved on 21 December 1999 for $100 million).  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 7\n\nSpecifically, the SDPL will ensure that the Enterprise Law, which was a core policy action under \nSCPL,  is  effectively  implemented,  business  registration  systems  streamlined,  and  licensing \nprocedures  simplified.  The  SDPL  also  builds  on  the  enhanced  role  and  capacity  of  the \nVietnamese  Accounting  Association,  supported  under  the  Second  Financial  Sector  Program \nLoan  (FSPL  II),10  for  disseminating  information  on  a  simplified  SME  accounting  system  and \nproviding training programs to SMEs.  \n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\n25. \nExternal  assistance  to SMEs  in  Viet  Nam  started  in  the  mid-1990s.  It is  estimated  that \nthere are over 60 recent or current initiatives in the sector. In addition to ADB, major multilateral \nfunding  agencies  active  in  SME  development  include  the  European  Union  (EU),  International \nFinance  Corporation,  International  Labour  Organisation  (ILO),  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme (UNDP), United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and World \nBank  (WB).  Other  bilateral  aid  agencies  from  Australia,  Belgium,  Canada,  Denmark,  France, \nFinland, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and United States (US) are \nalso active. Appendix 4 presents a matrix of aid activities in the SME sector, spread across (i) \npolicy  and  institutional  support;  (ii)  legal  and  regulatory  enhancement;  (iii)  human  resource \ndevelopment,  such  as  vocational  and  training  centers;  (iv)  line  of  credit  for  SMEs;  and  (v) \nbusiness  development  services.  Despite  diverse  assistance,  there  has  been  no  policy-based \nsupport in Viet Nam that takes a comprehensive view of developing the SME sector.  \n \n26.  More  specifically,  UNDP  and  UNIDO  have  worked  closely  with  the  Government  on \nimplementing  Decree  90  and  a  number  of  aspects  related  to  the  Enterprise  Law.  On  issues \nrelated to SOE reform, WB, in coordination with a number of bilateral sources, has put in place \na comprehensive package of reforms under its Poverty Reduction and Support Credit. For credit \nto  SMEs,  WB,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  and  EU  have  separately \nprovided lines of credit to commercial banks for a combined total of approximately $500 million \nduring 2003\u20132005. As for other schemes related to SME financing, such as the credit guarantee \nsystem,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  plans  to  provide  assistance  as  part  of \nJapan\u2019s  Miyazawa  Initiative.  For  reforms  related  to  land  use,  Sweden  has  provided  extensive \nassistance with a main focus on land planning and environmental issues. As regards capacity \nbuilding for SMEs, including those related to labor protection, bilateral aid agencies as well as \nILO  have  been  active.  On  SMEs\u2019  access  to  markets,  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (USAID) is providing assistance to upgrade the laws on competition and economic \ncontracts,  to  enable  Viet  Nam's  accession  to  WTO.  ADB  closely  coordinates  with  these \nagencies to maximize synergies where possible, and avoid duplication of efforts.   \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nADB's past operations in SME development suggest a number of key lessons.  \n\nFor  program  loans,  commitment  of  the  developing  member  country  (DMC)  is \ncrucial  for  successful  outcomes.  Merely  passing  legislative  and  regulatory \nchanges to satisfy ADB conditions did not guarantee successful outcomes. \n\nPrograms must provide sufficient flexibility to allow for rapidly changing economic \nand political conditions.  \n\n27. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2002. Second Financial Sector Program Loan. Manila (approved on 20 November 2002, for $50 million). \n\n\f8\n\n \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nADB's SME operations in individual DMCs were often one-off projects, with little \ncontinuity  and  complementarities  with  other  ADB  operations  or  integration  with \nother aid agencies\u2019 SME operations. \n\n \nDistinct features of the SDPL, which address shortcomings of ADB's past operations for \n28. \nSME development, include the consultative approach taken throughout its formulation. A series \nof workshops for each component was organized with a view to achieving commitment from the \nGovernment and stakeholders. Furthermore, the road map helped clarify the coordination issue \nwith other aid agencies. For the SDPL to maintain its relevance throughout its implementation \nperiod, it proposes to adopt a program cluster modality, which would allow operational flexibility \nand adjusting to changing economic and political conditions. \n \n\n6. \n\nRationale \n\n29. \nThere  is  a  consensus  among  the  Government,  ADB,  and  the  aid  community  on  the \nurgent need to support development of SMEs to sustain economic growth and to progressively \nreduce  the  country's  poverty  incidence.  The  traditional  approach,  which  aimed  to  encourage \nSME  development  through  provision  of  subsidized  credit  and  services,  did  not  address  the \nunderlying  distortions  and  consequently  achieved  mixed  results.  The  SDPL  focuses  on  these \ndistortions and the creation of an enabling business environment.  \n \n30. \nCreation of an enabling business environment in Viet Nam is challenging due to features \ncommon  to  developing  economies  in  transition.  Many  key  policy,  legal,  and  institutional \nframeworks in support of business operations have yet to be completed. There also remains a \npolicy bias for public sector entities. In selecting areas to be covered under the SDPL, priority \nwas  given  to  those  assessed  to  be  (i)  significant  for  SMEs'  current  business  operations,  (ii) \nbacked  by  the  Government's  commitment  to  reform  in  line  with  best  practices;  (iii)  linked  to \nADB's past and ongoing operations; and (iv) complementary to activities of other aid agencies.  \n \n31. \nIntensive discussions with Government counterparts and consultation with private sector \nstakeholders and aid agencies resulted in prioritizing SDPL objectives to (i) enhancing the policy \nand  regulatory  environment,  (ii)  improving  access  to  financial  and  physical  resources,  and  (iii) \nfacilitating access to domestic and international markets.  \n \n32. \nTo  achieve  these  objectives,  it  would  be  critical  to  have  (i)  coordination  of  policies \namong  various  Government  ministries  and  agencies  concerned;  (ii)  continued  policy  dialogue \nwith both technical officials and decision makers of the executing and implementing agencies so \nthat reforms are implemented in line with best practices; (iii) appropriate funding for establishing \nand  operationalizing  systems  in  support  of  policy  implementation;  and  (iv)  technical  inputs, \nparticularly  for  the  purposes  of  institutional  capacity  building.  Furthermore,  these  measures \nmust  be  effectively  synchronized,  achieve  concrete  results  within  a  predetermined  timeframe, \nand build momentum for further reforms to take place. Given these conditions, it was assessed \nthat  a  program  loan  modality  would  be  most  suitable  for  this  project.  The  SDPL  adopts  a \nprocess-oriented approach implementing measures on a step-by-step basis and is designed to \nsystematically  identify  and  resolve  issues  and  constraints  within  the  SME  sector  through \nintergovernmental coordination and stakeholder consultation, taking advantage of the program \ncluster modality. \n \nIt  is  important  to  note  that  the  SDPL  will  require  extensive  capacity  building  for  its \n33. \nimplementation.  In  particular  providing  training  and  resources  to  local  government  authorities \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 9\n\nwill be imperative because actual implementation will take place largely at the local level. In this \nregard, good governance is a key element for successful implementation of the SDPL. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope  \n\n34. \nThe  objective  of  the  SDPL  is  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  create  a  business \nenvironment that is conducive to economic growth and employment generation. Specifically, the \nSDPL  will  support  reform  measures  for  (i)  enhancing  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework;  (ii) \nimproving  SMEs\u2019  access  to  finance  and  land  use  rights;  and  (iii)  facilitating  SMEs\u2019  access  to \ndomestic and international markets by improving industrial and technical standards. \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n35. \nReforms to be implemented in each component of the SDPL are presented in the policy \nmatrix accompanying the development policy letter (Appendix 5) and in the program framework \n(Appendix 1). A discussion of key policy measures follows. \n \n\n1. \n\nImproving the Current Business Registration and Licensing Systems \n\n36. \nThe Enterprise Law of 2000 shifted the paradigm of business registration and licensing \nfrom  one  in  which  Government  permitted  companies  to  carry  out  certain  activities,  to  one  in \nwhich the companies are free to engage in all activities not expressly prohibited by law. The law \nhelped  improve  fairness  and  equality  in  the  business  environment  and  institutionalized  the \nprinciple  that  citizens  are  entitled  to  conduct  businesses  in  accordance  with  the  law.  The \nEnterprise Law concurrently simplified licensing by abolishing 150 sublicenses and introduced a \none-stop registration system decreasing the number of steps in registration from 20 to 3.11 \n \n37. \nKeeping  business  registration  and  licensing  processes  simple  and  ensuring  consistent \nand  fair  implementation  of  the  processes  reduce  uncertainty,  risks,  and  costs  for  businesses. \nHowever,  recent  developments  show  some  reversals  from  earlier  measures  simplifying \nbusiness  registration  and  licensing.  For  example,  after  the  abolition  of  a  large  number  of \nlicensing  requirements,  numerous  new  requirements  have  been  issued.  To  maintain  the \nmomentum  of  reform  in  the  business  registration  and  licensing  procedures,  the  SDPL  will \naddress (i) numerous implementing guidelines issued by provincial authorities that have caused \nconfusion  to  business  registration  officers;  (ii)  arbitrary  interpretation  and  implementation  of \nbusiness  registration  and  licensing  at  local  levels;  and  (iii)  limited  capacity  and  resources  of \nregistration offices, particularly at local levels. \n \nThe  SDPL  supports  the  adoption  of  increased  uniformity  in  procedures  for  business \n38. \nregistration  throughout  Viet  Nam.  It  is  expected  that  the  business  registration  system  will  be \nmodernized  at  all  levels\u2013\u2013central,  provincial,  and  district\u2013\u2013and  based  on  NBIN  so  that  the \nregistration procedure may be simplified.  \n\n                                                 \n11  The positive impact of the new procedure is evident in the number of newly registered enterprises. During 2000\u2013\n2002,  55,793  new  enterprises  were  established,  compared  with  only  45,000  in  9  years  (1991\u20131999).  In  2000, \n14,400  new  enterprises  were  registered  under  the  Enterprise  Law,  a  250%  increase  from  the  previous  year  and \n500%  increase  in  registered  capital.  In  some  provinces,  such  as  Bac  Giang,  Ha  Giang,  Quang  Binh,  and  Hung \nYen,  the  number  of  new  enterprises  registered  in  2000  equaled  the  number  of  enterprises  registered  in  the \nprevious 9 years. Some 150,000 household enterprises were also established in 2000, with 28,500 new household \nenterprises in Ho Chi Minh City alone. \n\n\f10\n\n \n\n \n\nThe  Task  Force  for  the  Enforcement  of  the  Enterprise  Law  (Task  Force)  reviewed \n39. \nlicensing  requirements  and  procedures  and  reported  to  the  Prime  Minister  on  the  need  for \nfurther streamlining. It identified decrees and implementation guidelines that contradict the spirit \nof  the  Enterprise  Law  and  recommended  measures  to  address  them.  The  SDPL  supports \nabolishing redundant and unnecessary regulations and licensing as recommended by the Task \nForce, through issuance of a decision by the Prime Minister. The SDPL will further support the \nTask  Force  and  MPI  to  take  on  a  greater  role  in  creating  a  more  effective  licensing  regime \n(rather than submitting ad hoc recommendations to the Prime Minister) conducive to business \ngrowth in Viet Nam. The SDPL will support authorization of the Task Force and MPI to submit a \nproposal for an ex ante assessment system for business licenses. \n \n\n2. \n\nEstablishing the Government\u2019s Policy and Institutional Framework for SME \nDevelopment \n\n40. \nPromulgation  of  Decree  90  on  SME  development  in  2001  has  better  defined  the \nGovernment\u2019s role. A diverse range of Government policies and plans refers to the importance \nof  SME  development,  but  the  Government  has  yet  to  integrate  them  into  a  national  SME \ndevelopment  strategy.  The  strategy-making  process  has  been  constrained  by \nlimited \ninstitutional  resources  and  capacity,  lack  of  a  coordination  mechanism,  insufficient  efforts  to \npromote public private partnerships, and a weak statistical base on SMEs.  \n \n\na. \n\nIdentifying a More Effective Basis for Targeting SMEs \n\n41. \nOfficial  definition  of  SMEs  provides  the  basis  for  targeting,  monitoring,  and  evaluating \nthe  Government's  SME  policies.  There  is  no  globally  accepted  definition  of  SMEs  and  most \ncountries  establish  their  own  definition  based  on  their  specific  economic  and  social \ncircumstances. \nIn  Viet  Nam,  Decree  90  defines  SMEs  as  business  and  production \nestablishments that are registered under the current legislation, with a registered capital of less \nthan  D10  billion  (about  $670,000)  less  than  300  permanent  employees  a  year  on  average,  or \nboth.  A  more  precise  definition  will  help  the  Government  better  monitor  SMEs  and  develop  a \nfocused  set  of  policies.  To  better  monitor  SMEs  and  track  their  performance,  the  Government \nwill define SMEs more spcifically. \n \n\nb. \n\nDeveloping a System for Collecting Information on SMEs \n\n42. \nAccurate  and  up-to-date  information  permits  the  Government  to  identify  constraints  to \nthe  establishment  and  growth  of  businesses.  Thus,  targeted  interventions  to  eliminate  such \nconstraints  may  be  initiated  with  predefined  and  quantified  baselines  for  measuring  policy \nimpact. Data on the SME sector in Viet Nam as defined by Decree 90 are not collected and key \ndata  sources  have  not  yet  been  formally  asked  to  collect  SME-specific  data.  The  two  main \nsources of data are  \n \n\nthe  national  statistical  network,  which  comprises  the  General  Statistical  Office \n(GSO), 61 provincial statistics offices, and over 600 district statistics offices. The \ndistrict  statistics  offices  collect  most  of  the  data  on  SMEs  for  processing  at  the \nprovincial statistics offices and subsequent reporting to the different departments \nof the General Statistical Office; and \n\nNBIN, which comprises the Business Information Center. NBIN has the mandate \nto  set  up  and  manage  the  registration  system  on  enterprises  throughout  the \ncountry. It is within the Enterprise Department of MPI and collects data from 61 \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 11\n\nprovincial business registration offices and over 600 district business registration \nsections.  \n\n \n43. \nCompiling accurate information on enterprises in Viet Nam is hindered by (i) absence of \nclear  guidelines  on  the  specific  data  to  be  collected,  leading  to  significant  local  variance,  and \naggregation of data at the provincial level; and (ii) low response rate from enterprises, estimated \nto be as low as 20% for SMEs and even lower for household enterprises.12  \n \nTo  overcome  the  problems  in  data  collection,  the  Agency  for  SME  Development  will \n44. \nupgrade and implement a plan for  NBIN, under the SDPL, incorporating measures to address \ncurrent constraints. NBIN will cover all provinces in Viet Nam and incorporate an SME database \nas  well  as  an  on-line  SME  gateway  for  SMEs,  providing  information  on  regulations  and \nprocedures  for  compliance,  Government  support  programs,  business  associations,  and  other \nbusiness  support  providers.  It  will  also  establish  linkages  with  other  sources  of  information  on \nSMEs,  such  as  the  secured  transactions  center  and  GSO  to  augment  data  collected  at  NBIN \nand obtain a more comprehensive picture of the status of SMEs. \n \n\nc. \n\nFormulating a Coordinated Plan for SME Development \n\n45. \nThe  Agency  for  SME  Development  was  created  under  Decree  90.  Its  tasks  and \nresponsibilities  are  wide-ranging  and  include  formulation  of  an  integrated  SME  development \nstrategy. Under TA 4031 (footnote 3), ADB provided technical inputs into the preparation of the \nroad map for SME development. A modernized information system and the road map form the \nbasis for the SME development strategy in Viet Nam. To put the strategy into action, MPI, the \nSDPL  support,  will  submit  a  multisector  and  interministerial  action  program  for  SME \ndevelopment to the Prime Minister for consideration of his approval.  \n \n46. \nThe  SME  Promotion  Council,  also  created  under  Decree  90  and  with  cross-ministry \nmembership  to  advise  the  Prime  Minister  on  mechanisms  and  policies  on  SME  development, \nwill  play  an  integral  role  in  formulating  the  SME  development  strategy  and  its  action  program. \nSince  a  high-level  interministerial  coordination  task  force  for  horizontal  integration  of  SME-\nrelated  policies,  and  strategies  and  plans  of  various  Government  ministries  and  agencies  has \nyet to be established, the review and feedback from the SME Promotion Council will be vital in \nmaintaining  coherence  and  consistency  of  the  strategy  and  its  action  program.  However,  the \nSME  Promotion  Council  has  limited  membership  from  the  private  sector.  To  ensure  that \nproblems  of  the  SMEs  are  considered  and  addressed  in  the  action  program,  the  Government \nwill increase members from the private sector and business associations in the SME Promotion \nCouncil.  \n  \n\n3. \n\nEnhancing SMEs\u2019 Access to Financial and Physical Resources \n\n47. \nAccess to finance is perhaps the most often cited problem of SMEs. Under the current \noperational environment, banks are becoming increasingly interested in lending to private sector \nSMEs. However, high transaction costs associated with lending to SMEs have held back actual \ngrowth  in  SME  loans.  Availability  of  collateral,  which  can  potentially  compensate  for  SMEs' \nperceived  high  credit  risk,  is  limited,  given  the  SMEs\u2019  weak  asset  base.  The  SDPL  supports \nmeasures to reduce the cost and risks of lending by addressing the bottlenecks SMEs face in \nproviding financial information and offering collateral to lenders. Furthermore, it will also develop \n\n                                                 \n12  One  of  the  main  reasons  for  the  low  response  from  SMEs  is  that  there  is  no  single  agency  that  collects  the \n\nnecessary information comprehensively, making such information database useful for SMEs themselves.  \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n \n\nan alternative channel for SME financing through new funding sources and a diversified range \nof products for the leasing industry. \n \n\na. \n\nDeveloping an SME Accounting System \n\n48. \nThe accounting system for smaller enterprises in Viet Nam is governed by two decisions \n(Decision 1177 on the Accounting System of SMEs issued on 23 December 1996, and Decision \n144 amending and supplementing Decision 1177  issued on 21 December 2001) and is based \non  standards  similar  to  those  for  larger  enterprises.  Specifically,  enterprises  are  required  to \nprepare  and  submit  a  balance  sheet  with  details  of  off-balance  sheet  items,  an  income \nstatement,  explanatory  note  to  financial  statements,  and  details  of  account  balances  on \ninventory, sales revenue, bad debts, overdue payables, changes in fixed assets, distribution of \nprofit, and the status or use of reserves. There are currently 25 accounting books applicable to \nall types of enterprises and 39 supporting documents (compulsory and guiding) in accordance \nwith Decisions 1177 and 144. \n \nThe Vietnamese accounting system is also in the process of being brought to conformity \n49. \nwith  international  accounting  standards.  An  Accounting  Standards  Board,  established  by  the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) in 1999, issued four Vietnamese accounting standards in 2001 and \nanother six standards in 2002. The newly issued Vietnamese accounting standards are largely \nin  accordance  with  international  standards.  Furthermore,  on  17  June  2003,  the  National \nAssembly passed the Law on Accounting, considerably modernizing the accounting rules in Viet \nNam.  SME  accounting,  however,  has  fallen  behind  this  process.  The  new  Accounting  Law, \nwhich  became  effective  on  1  January  2004,  supersedes  both  Decisions  1177  and  144,  but \nreplacing decisions have yet to be issued.  \n \n50. \nTo  make  financial  records  available  for  loan  applications  under  a  uniform  set  of \naccounting  standards  applicable  to  SMEs,  the  inconsistencies  and  incompleteness  of  SME \naccounting  must  be  remedied.  Furthermore,  a  simplified  system  must  be  developed  to  better \nsuit  SMEs'  needs  and  capabilities.  The  SDPL  supports  MOF  in  issuing  revised  decisions  to \nreplace  1177  and  144,  consistent  with  the  new  Accounting  Law.  Subsequently,  a  simplified \nsystem consistent with the Vietnamese accounting standards will be introduced. The SDPL will \nfurther support dissemination of and training on the simplified SME accounting system through \nthe  Vietnamese  Accounting  Association  and  its  SME  Accounting  Center.  The  Center  will \nprepare  a  program  to  train  SMEs  and  business  associations  on  the  new  SME  accounting \nsystem.   \n \n\nb. \n\nIncreasing Effective Use of Collateral \n\n51.  Most banks in Viet Nam rely mainly on SMEs' ability to provide security for loans due to \nSMEs'  inadequate  financial  records  and  business  planning  skills  on  one  hand,  and  the  banks' \ninexperience  and  inability  to  effectively  assess  SMEs\u2019  credit  risks  on  the  other  hand.  Given \nSMEs\u2019 weak asset base, their options for collateral are not many and LURCs are likely to be the \nmost  valuable.  Yet  issuance  of  LURCs  (as  immovable  property)  to  SMEs  has  been  extremely \ntime-consuming,  with  a  series  of  checks  that  must  be  cleared  and  requirements  for  legal \ndocuments  that  vary  from  province  to  province.  The  problem  stems  from  the  fact  that  the \nauthority  to  assign  land-use  rights  and  issue  LURCs  was  given  to  local  people's  committees, \nand each adopted different procedures and requirements. The situation was further complicated \nby the lack of a single, uniform land registry system in Viet Nam. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 13\n\nThe  new  Land  Law  of  2003  (effective  July  2004),  which  introduces  the  concept  of  a \n52. \nsingle  land  registry  in  Viet  Nam,  is  expected  to  essentially  resolve  many  of  the  issues \nsurrounding  LURCs. Under  the  new  Land  Law,  a  single  format  of  LURCs  will  be  issued  to  all \nland  users  under  the  sole  authority  of  the  Ministry  of  Natural  Resource  and  Environment \n(MONRE)  for  nationwide  use.  A  single  land  registry  system  covering  the  whole  of  Viet  Nam, \nusing  one  procedure  for  every  registration,  will  help  ensure  clarity  and  security  of  titles  and \nimprove the use of land as collateral. A simple, transparent, and uniform procedure for issuing \nLURCs will help reduce transaction costs for SMEs acquiring such rights. Furthermore, the new \nLand Law makes reference to bringing land pricing by the state in line with the market value of \nland,  a  significant  departure  from  reliance  on  land  prices  set  by  the  people's  committees  for \npurposes of taxation and compensation.  \n \nThe  SDPL  supports  the  Government  in  putting  into  practice  the  principles  of  the  new \n53. \nLand  Law,  which  would  make  LURCs  more  readily  available  for  use  as  collateral  by  SMEs. \nSpecifically,  the  SDPL  will  support  developing  uniform  procedures  to  be  followed  by  all \nprovincial  and  district  offices  of  MONRE  for  (i)  land  registration  and  LURC  issuance,  and  (ii) \ninformation collection on the issued LURCs. Furthermore, MOF, together with MONRE, will draft \nnew  guidelines  for  valuation  of  land  in  line  with  market  prices  for  use  by  local  authorities.  A \ndecree stipulating the use of the guideline by local authorities will be drafted and issued. After \nthe issuance of the decree, MOF will draft and issue implementing circulars in accordance with \nthe Land Law. \n \n54. \nFor  using  movable  properties  as  collateral,  emphasis  has  been  placed  on  the \ndevelopment  of  a  secured  transactions  registration  system.  Under  the  First  Financial  Sector \nProgram Loan (FSPL I),13 the Government issued a Secured Transactions Decree (Decree 165) \nand  a  Decree  Establishing  the  Registry  for  Secured  Transactions.  The  secured  transactions \nregistry has the potential to reduce the costs and risks of lending secured by movable property, \nincluding equipment, inventories, and receivables, thus improving SMEs\u2019 access to finance. The \nGovernment continues to make steady progress toward developing a nationwide computerized \nsecured  transactions  registration  system.  The  Ministry  of  Justice  (MOJ)  prepared  an \nimplementation plan containing milestones for system development. In 2002, MOJ established \nthe  National  Registration  Center  of  Secured  Transactions  in  Hanoi  and  Ho  Chi  Minh.  But,  to \nachieve the objective of effectively securing credit, much work is still needed on both the legal \nframework and system development. \n \n55. \nFor  the  proper  functioning  of  the  secured  transactions  registry,  legal  documents  must \nclearly establish prioritization of creditors' and lien holders' rights upon registering their interest. \nFurthermore,  the  computerized  system  must  ensure  efficiency  and  transparency  for  potential \ncreditors or purchasers. MOJ, with SDPL support, will draft and submit to the National Assembly \nlegislation  prioritizing  creditors'  and  lien  holders'  rights  upon  registering  their  interest  on  the \nNational  Registration  Agency  for  Secured  Transactions  (NRAST).  Furthermore,  the  SDPL \nsupports enactment of an implementing decree to the ordinance, which will promote efficiency \nand transparency of the registration agency by (i) permitting anyone to obtain free noncertified \nsearch  reports  through  Internet\u2013based  search,  (ii)  allowing  frequent  registrants  to  register  on-\nline, and (iii) limiting required data for registering notice. \n \n\n                                                 \n13  ADB.  1996.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Financial  Sector  Program.  Manila \n(approved for $90 million on 19 November 1996).  \n\n\f14\n\n \n\n \n\nc. \n\nImproving the Operational Environment for Financial Leasing \nCompanies \n\n56. \nFinancial leasing operations in Viet Nam are governed by Decree 16/2001/ND-CP (May \n2001) and Circular No. 8/2001/TT-NHNN (September 2001) issued by State Bank of Viet Nam \n(SBV). The activities of financial leasing companies (FLCs) are confined to financial leasing for \nmachinery, equipment, vehicles, and other movable assets; advising clients on matters relating \nto  financial  leasing  operations;  and  other  services  related  to  financial  leasing.  Sale  and \nleaseback and syndicated lease transactions are permitted, although implementing regulations \nhave  yet  to  be  issued.  Transactions  in  foreign  currency  are  subject  to  the  foreign  exchange \ncontrol  regulations  of  SBV.  FLCs  are  permitted  to  mobilize  capital  from  short-,  medium-,  and \nlong-term borrowing from credit institutions in Viet Nam and abroad; issuance of bonds with a \nterm of over 1 year (subject to SBV approval); and by other means as approved by SBV. \n\n57. \nThe  development  of  the  leasing  industry  in  Viet  Nam  is  particularly  constrained  by \nshortcomings in the legal framework that restrict both the activities and the funding mechanisms \nof FLCs. The Government recognizes that the absence of implementing regulations for sale and \nleaseback  transactions  and  syndicated  leasing  constrains  FLCs  from  offering  a  fuller  product \nrange  tailored  to  market  needs.  Long-term  funding  also  presents  a  problem  for  some  FLCs, \nincluding subsidiaries of state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) that source all or most of their \nfunds from their respective parent banks. Leasing companies have cited difficulties in attracting \nterm loans of more than 1 year at viable interest rates, and relatively few have been successful \nin issuing medium- or long-term bonds. To date, no leasing company has attempted to structure \nand  sell  packages  of  their  outstanding  leases,  as  a  way  of  leveraging  additional  funds.  The \nSDPL will support the Government in revising Decree 16 and Circular No. 8 governing leasing \nactivities to allow wider product ranges and sources of funding for FLCs. \n\n4. \n\nCompleting  the  Legal  Framework  for  Land  to  Allow  Market-Based \nTransactions  \n\n58.  Many SME surveys in Viet Nam point to limited access to land as the foremost constraint \nto  their  growth.14  Issues  on  SMEs\u2019  access  to  land  revolve  around  inefficiencies  resulting  from \ninconsistencies and bias distinct to economies in transition. For example, there is a significant \ndifference in the proportion of land-use rights held by SOEs compared with those held by private \nsector  SMEs.  The  economic  transformation  process  has  resulted  in  a  large  amount  of  prime \ncommercial and industrial land allocated to SOEs. However, many do not take full advantage of \nthe land allocated to them in their industrial or commercial activities. Much land allocated to the \nSOEs  are  left  idle  with  no  plans  for  future  use  while  the  rapidly  growing  private  SMEs  are \nsuffering from lack of land for their use. Consequently, leasing idle land from SOEs has become \nthe most common method used by private sector SMEs to obtain land, although subletting from \nSOEs is, in most cases, illegal. \n \n59. \nDespite  the  country\u2019s  transition  toward  a  more  market-based  economy,  land  still  is \nconsidered  as  being  owned  by  \u201call  citizens\u201d  and  administered  by  the  State  as  \u201crepresentative \nowner.\u201d  This  fundamental  framework  has  not  changed.  However,  the  Government  is  taking \nproactive measures to clarify the principles of land law and make them consistent for developing \na property market in Viet Nam. Given the sensitivity of issues related to land, progress will likely \nbe gradual. Nonetheless, some noteworthy measures have been taken. For example, the new \n                                                 \n14  Reports  and  surveys:  Institute  of  Economics.  2001.  General  Survey  on  Infrastructure  Services  to  the  Private \nSector.  Hanoi,  Viet  Nam;  and  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC).  2002.  Business  Environment  for \nPrivate Enterprises. Tokyo, Japan.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 15\n\nLand Law of 2003, supported under the SDPL, recognized the property market for the first time \nin Viet Nam and stipulates that land pricing should be based on real market transfer prices of \nland-use  rights  under  normal  circumstances.  The  law  also  augments  and  improves  State \nmanagement  of  land  in  terms  of  (i)  land  zoning  and  planning,  (ii)  transferring  the  power  to \nallocate  or  lease  land  and  issue  LURCs  from  the  Government  to  the  provincial  and  district \npeople\u2019s committees, (iii) establishing the organization (nonprofit public service SOE) to create \nand manage land funds, (iv) establishing a uniform land registration system for undertaking all \nland registration in Viet Nam, (v) making clear the procedures for settling of land disputes, and \n(vi) clarifying the guiding principles for land pricing. \n \n60. \nOne  of  the  key  achievements  of  the  new  law  is  making  land-use  rights  transferable \nbased  on  market  principles.  It  also  introduces  a  single  nationwide  registry  system,  a  uniform \nprocedure  for  issuing  LURCs,  and  measures  to  improve  the  use  of  idle  land.  A  simplified  and \nmore  transparent  legislative  framework  will  benefit  SMEs  by  making  the  law  easier  to \nunderstand,  particularly  for  owners  or  operators  who  have  no  legal  background,  and  by \ngenerally reducing transaction costs. \n \n61. \nThe  SDPL  supports  enforcing  impartial  dissemination  of  information  on  land  use \nplanning  and  zoning.  Viet  Nam  does  not  have  mandatory  land  use  planning  that  designates \nspecific  land  use  in  certain  zones  for  specific  purposes.  Instead,  it  has  regional  zoning  plans \nand urban development master plans. The detailed plans prepared for specific zones must then \nbe  developed  in  accordance  with  the  urban  development  master  plan.  The  detailed  plans,  as \ndescribed in Decree 68 on preparation and approval of land zoning and planning in localities, is \nthe  primary  vehicle  for  land  use  management  and  land  allocation  associated  with  public  and \nprivate sector housing, infrastructure, and commercial development projects. Preparation of the \ndetailed plan is normally the first step in the project development process, and is a prerequisite \nfor the subsequent steps of obtaining planning certificates, and land allocation and construction \napprovals.  \n \n62. \nThus, information on detailed plans is important to all enterprises interested in acquiring \nland and should be widely disseminated once the provincial government approves such a plan. \nHowever,  information  on  land  zoning  and  plans  is  valuable,  and  can  be  sold  or  used  as  the \nbasis  for  land  speculation.  The  new  Land  Law  requires  that  the  land  zoning  and  plans  be \nannounced  publicly  within  30  days  after  they  are  decided  or  ratified  by  the  competent  state \nagency.  To  ensure  that  SMEs  are  given  access  to  such  information,  the  SDPL  supports \nMONRE  in  preparing  a  decree  that  mandates  local  agencies  to  disseminate  information  on \nzoning  and  planning  promptly,  and  specifies  that  administrative  penalties  will  be  imposed  for \nviolation of this requirement. \n \n\n5. \n\nEnhancing SMEs\u2019 Access to International Markets \n\n63. \nStandardization  is  a  key  part  of  microeconomic  infrastructure  that  is  still  in  the \ndevelopment  phase  in  Viet  Nam.  For  businesses,  standards  help  create  a  common  trading \nlanguage,  and  reduce  costs  for  manufacturing  and  warehousing.  For  governments,  standards \noffer an opportunity for deregulation and improved governance as they help to ease the level of \nregulatory  details  to  essential  requirements  for  health  protection,  safety,  and  the  environment. \nThe  SDPL  supports  the  Government  in  developing  industrial  and  technical  standards  in \nconformity  with  best  international  practices,  which  promote  participation  of  all  stakeholders, \nincluding SMEs. \n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\n \n\na. \n\nCompleting the Legal Framework on Industrial and Technical \nStandards in Conformity with Best International Practices \n\n64. \nSome  secondary  regulations  relating  to  the  Ordinance  of  Product  Quality  of  1999  are \neither outdated or incomplete. A Government providing a detailed definition of the Ordinance on \nProduct Quality only exists in draft form and has yet to be approved. Other legal texts required \nfor  completion  of  the  current  legal  framework  include  (i)  issuance  of  \u201cThe  List  of  Products \nRequired  to  Conform  to  Vietnamese  Technical  Standards\u201d;  and  (ii)  update  of  the  list  of \nimport/export  products  in  Decision  117,  which  requires  the  State  to  check  for  quality.  These \nlegal  texts  are  expected  to  sufficiently  clarify  the  requirements  of  product  quality  and  aid  in \neffectively implementing the current ordinance. \n \nAs  a  next  step,  the  SDPL  will  support  drafting  and  submitting  to  the  Government  an \n65. \nordinance  on  standardization  to  develop  a  uniform  standardization  system  with  the  aim  of \nreducing regulatory burdens. Such an ordinance will be in line with international practices and is \nexpected to substantially reduce the cost of regulatory compliance for SMEs. \n \n\nb. \n\nUndertaking Institutional Reforms and Bringing SME Representation \nin Setting Standards \n\nThere  are  several  impediments  within  the  current  institutional  framework.  One  problem \n66. \narea is in accreditation of certification bodies. In Viet Nam, there is one accreditation body, the \nBureau  of  Accreditation,  vested  with  the  task  of  assessing  the  competence  of  certification \nbodies.  However,  the  Bureau  of  Accreditation  has  yet  to  accredit  a  single  certification  body. \nGiven the current limited capacity of the bureau, it would be beneficial to authorize international \ninstitutions  to  accredit  certification  bodies  in  Viet  Nam.  Accordingly,  the  SDPL  will  support  the \nMinistry of Science and Technology (MOST) in drafting a decision requiring that any certification \nbody  operating  in  Viet  Nam  must  be  accredited  by  an  Accreditation  Body  that  is  a  mutual \nrecognition agreement by signatory member of the International Accreditation Forum, or Pacific \nAccreditation Cooperation, or Viet Nam's Board of Accreditation. \n \n67. \nThe  Directorate  for  Standards  and  Quality  (STAMEQ),  as  authorized  by  MOST,  had \noriginally been the only institution to certify  standardized products, quality assurance systems, \nand testing laboratories. These functions have been transferred to technical service institutions; \nhowever,  STAMEQ  continues  to  undertake  certification.  There  is  a  conflict  of  interest  for \nSTAMEQ to handle certification when the Bureau of Accreditation is operating under STAMEQ. \nDevelopment  of  certification  bodies  in  the  private  sector  will  also  be  hindered  as  a  result  of \nSTAMEQ's  competitive  advantage  as  a  state-owned  certification  body.  To  address  this  issue, \nMOST  will  plan  for  and  implement  the  separation  of  STAMEQ's  state  administrative  functions \nfrom its commercial activities.  \n \n68. \nThe  SDPL  also  supports  SMEs'  participation  in  the  process  of  setting  standards. \nInvolvement  in  the  process  of  standardization  itself  also  allows  the  interests  of  SMEs  to  be \nreflected in the resulting standards. Under the SDPL, MOST will ensure that private SMEs are \nrepresented  in  the  National  Technical  Committee  of  Standard  and  industry  and  technical \ncommittees of standardization.        \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 17\n\nc. \n\nMaking Information on Both National and International Standards \nReadily Available \n\n69. \nSMEs in Viet Nam currently have poor knowledge of international standards and national \nstandards  of  other  countries.  Availability  of  information  about  competitors  and  market \nrequirements  related  to  product  quality  is  limited.  A  database  of  international  standards  and \nnational  standards  of  other  countries  has  been  developed  by  the  Information  Center  of \nSTAMEQ  and  additional  information  regarding  technical  standards  and  product  quality  is \nprovided  by  information  centers  of  some  ministries.  However,  it  is  not  always  immediately \napparent to SMEs how this information relates to their business and finding simple answers to \nbasic  questions  is  often  difficult  for  SMEs  that  have  little  knowledge  of  how  standards  and \nconformity assessment systems work. SMEs also have limited access to information on testing \nservices provided by Vietnamese and international testing laboratories.  \n \n70. \nLack of access to information and knowledge on standards can be a major competitive \ndisadvantage for SMEs attempting to enter domestic or international markets. To overcome this \nbarrier,  the  SDPL  supports  MOST  in  developing  an  on-line  database  providing  SMEs  with \ninformation  on  (i)  national  standards  of  other  countries,  international  standards,  and  cross-\nrecognition  schemes;  (ii)  certification  bodies,  testing  laboratories,  and  quality  management \nproviders; and (iii) relevant information on technology transfer.   \n \nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\ntransactions,  and \n\n71. \nThe  SDPL  is  based  on  an  in-depth  analysis  and  discussions  with  the  Government  on \neach component over a period of 9 months. In particular, policy measures proposed under the \nSDPL  were  discussed  extensively  with  Government  officials,  at  both  technical  and  decision-\nmaking levels, with highly technical inputs from experts in the fields of SME policy, land, leasing, \nregistration  systems,  secured \ntechnical  standards.  The  discussions \nculminated  in  agreement  with  the  Government  on  the  objective  and  expected  impact  of \nundertaking clearly defined specific policy actions conforming with best international practices.    \n \n72. \nIn the medium term, policies implemented with the support of the SDPL are expected to \nincrease SMEs\u2019 contribution to economic growth and employment generation. Many measures \nadopted  under  the  SDPL  support  the  Government  in  undertaking  market-friendly  interventions \nand eliminating policy bias against SMEs, thus strengthening the environment for private sector \ndevelopment.  Beneficiaries  of  such  measures  are  expected  to  include  the  poor  and  the  near \npoor. The impact of the SDPL on the poor has been assessed in Appendix 6.  \n \n73. \nThe  proposed  policies  under  the  SDPL  are  expected  to  have  no  negative  impact  on \nwomen. Policies to mainstream gender concerns under the SDPL were, however, constrained \nby lack of data on SMEs in general. This serious limitation also makes quantifying the impact of \nthe  SDPL  on  specific  groups  of  people,  such  as  the  poor  and  women,  impractical.  The  SDPL \naddresses this shortcoming through (i) the establishment of NBIN, and  (ii) annual reports to be \nprepared on the status of SMEs. The SDPL will closely monitor outcomes, and economic and \nsocial impacts throughout its implementation to ensure that there are no adverse impact on the \npoor and the vulnerable, including women.  \n\n74. \nImplementation  of  the  policy  conditions  proposed  under  the  SDPL  is  expected  to  have \ninsignificant  direct  impact  on  the  environment.  Measures  to  be  adopted  by  the  Government \nconcentrate on (i) streamlining administrative procedures, such as those required for business \nand land registration; (ii) providing more relevant information to SMEs, such as those related to \n\n\f18\n\n \n\n \n\nstatutory  rules  and  regulations  and  SME  support  programs;  and  (iii)  establishing  social  or \neconomic  infrastructure,  such  as  the  land  registration,  secured  transactions,  and  SME \naccounting systems.   \n\nTwo  components  may  have  some  positive  impact  on  the  environment.  One  is  the \n75. \ncomponent for improving SME's access to land\u2013\u2013enactment of the Land Law, which establishes \nclear  and  secure  rights  for  land  use,  increasingly  allowing  market-based  transactions  on \nLURCs.  There  is  the  potential  that  long-term  and  sustainable  resource  management  will  be \nundertaken due to the increased security and clarity on land use. The newly enacted law also \nclearly stipulates safeguards for environmental protection. The second component with potential \npositive impact is enhancement of the standardization framework in Viet Nam. By bringing the \nlegal and institutional frameworks for standardization in line with international best practices, the \ntechnical  and  industrial  standards  will  be  upgraded.  Adherence  to  such  standards  by  all \nenterprises  in  Viet  Nam  will  likely  bring  positive  impact  on  the  environment  in  the  medium  to \nlong  term.    Accordingly,  the  SDPL  is  classified  as  category  C  under  ADB's  environmental \nclassification system.15\n\nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n76. \nThe lending modality of the SDPL will be a program cluster, comprising two back-to-back \nsubprograms.  For  subprogram  I,  an  ADB  loan  of  $60  million  equivalent  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) is proposed. For the succeeding subprogram II\u2013\u2013based on resource \navailability  and  satisfactory  performance  of  the  first  subprogram\u2013\u2013an  ADB  loan  of  $20  million \nequivalent  from  ADF  and  an  additional  $20  million  from  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  is \nproposed.  \n \n77. \nThe  SDPL  is  being  cofinanced  by  Agence  Francaise  de  Developpement  (AFD)  and \nKreditanstalt fur Wiederauflbau (KfW); and representatives from both the Deutsche Gesellschaft \nf\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ) and  JBIC  joined  the  loan  fact-finding  mission  in  March \n2004 to strengthen operational consistency. AFD proposes to provide cofinancing of \u20ac25 million, \n\u20ac15  million  for  subprogram  I,  and  \u20ac10  million  for  subprogram  II.  KfW  proposes  to  provide \ncofinancing of \u20ac20 million: \u20ac14 million for subprogram I and \u20ac6 million for subprogram II.16   \n \n78. \nThe SDPL will be the first program loan to be cofinanced by KfW. As in the case of AFD \ncofinancing,  KfW's  contribution  is  structured  as  a  parallel  financing  arrangement.  This  is  an \nimportant  step  for  ADB  to  further  expand  its  financing  partnership  with  key  development \npartners in new areas of operation. Within the overall program, KfW concentrates on improving \nthe  operational  environment  for  FLCs,  taking  responsibility  for  the  initial  assessment  of  the \nreform process. ADB will provide overall coordination and oversight for monitoring the program. \nReporting to and by the Government is designed to minimize transaction costs in dealing with \ndifferent agencies. \n \n79. \nThe total amount for the SDPL and loan amounts for the subprograms are determined \non the basis of the strategic importance of developing the SME sector and the costs of structural \nreforms  to  be  supported  under  the  SDPL.  Such  costs  arising  from  reform  measures  to  be \nimplemented are estimated to be around $190 million to $250 million equivalent during the 36 \nmonths  of  program  implementation.17  It  has  been  estimated  that  streamlined  licensing,  and \n\n                                                 \n15 The environmental assessment of the policy matrix is in the Supplementary Appendix.  \n16 Conversion rate: $1.00=\u20ac0.84.\n17 Estimates by ADB staff with inputs from consultants engaged under TA 4031-VIE (footnote 3). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 19\n\nbusiness  and  land  registration  procedures  will  reduce  fees  in  the  range  of  $35  million  to  $55 \nmillion  per  year.  Equipment,  software,  and  hardware  for  establishing  systems  in  support  of  a \nstreamlined  and  efficient  business  and  land  registration  systems  in  the  pilot  phase  will  incur \ncosts  of  approximately  $20  million.  Training,  including  for  those  at  local  and  district  levels,  is \nestimated  to  cost  $12  million  per  year.  Institutional  reform  measures,  including  those  for  the \nAgency for SME Development, Business and Land Registration Section at the district level, and \nSTAMEQ, are estimated to cost some $28 million. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n80.  MPI will be the Executing Agency for the SDPL. MONRE, MOF, MOST, MOJ, and SBV \nwill be the implementing agencies. MPI will be responsible for overall program implementation, \nincluding  administration  and  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds,  maintenance  of  accounts,  and \npreparation of semiannual progress reports on program implementation.  \n \n81. \nTo  coordinate  program  implementation  among  government  ministries  and  agencies \nconcerned, a program steering committee (PSC) will be formed. The PSC, chaired by a deputy \nminister  of  MPI,  will  comprise  senior  officers  from  all  ministries  and  government  agencies \nconcerned (MOF, MONRE, MOST, MOJ, and SBV). The PSC will meet twice yearly and on an \nad  hoc  basis  to  review  pending  issues  and  propose  concrete  actions  for  their  resolution  to \nensure timely program implementation. A program implementation and coordination unit will be \nformed  within  MPI  to  assist  the  PSC  and  ADB  in  implementing  the  Program.  The  unit  will  be \nheaded by a senior officer of MPI and staffed with MPI officials. The unit will be responsible for \nday-to-day implementation of the SDPL. \n \n\n2. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n82. \nIn accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans, all goods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will \nbe  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in  accordance  with  standard \npublic  procedures  in  Viet  Nam  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices  acceptable  to \nADB.18  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international  commodity  markets  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB. \n \nThe proceeds of the SDPL will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, except for a \n83. \nlist of ineligible items (Appendix 7). The Borrower will certify that the value of total imports minus \n(i) imports from nonmember countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) disbursements made under \nother  official  development  assistance,  is  greater  than  the  amount  expected  to  be  disbursed \nduring the year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the \naccuracy of the Borrower's certification.  \n \n\n3. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n84. \nThe  Government  has  assured  that  sufficient  funds  will  be  made  available  to  meet  the \ncosts  associated  with  the  reform  program  supported  by  the  SDPL.  Any  counterpart  funds  not \nrequired for the reforms will be used for general budget support. \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n\n\f20\n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\n85. \nThe Government and ADB/AFD/KfW will continue to engage in active policy dialogue on \nsector  issues,  policy  reforms,  and  other  measures  during  SDPL  implementation  and  on \nadditional reforms that may be considered necessary or desirable.   \n \n86. \nFor  its  effective  implementation,  the  program  lending  modality  requires  an  appropriate \nregime  for  public  financial  management,  including  budget  development,  execution  and \nmonitoring,  external  fiscal  reporting,  and  transparency.  The  aid  community  in  Viet  Nam  has \nmade  collective  efforts  to  assess  the  status  of  the  public  financial  management  system  and \nproduced a number of periodic diagnostic reports. During SDPL implementation, ADB will, from \ntime to time, review reports on the public financial management system in Viet Nam prepared by \nother  aid  agencies  and  will  request  the  Government  to  clarify  and  discuss  issues  identified  in \nsuch reports.19  \n \n87. \nThe  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  consolidated  semiannual  reports  on  SDPL \nimplementation and accomplishment of objectives. The consolidated reports, to be submitted in \nsuch  form  and  detail  and  within  the  period  that  ADB  may  reasonably  request,  will  cover  (i) \nprogress made and specific problems encountered during the 6 months under review, (ii) steps \ntaken  or  proposed  to  resolve  the  problems,  and  (iii)  proposed  SDPL  activities  and  expected \nprogress  during  the  following  6  months.  ADB  will  send  regular  review  missions  to  confirm \ncompliance  with  conditions  for  the  second  tranche  release  for  subprogram  I  as  well  as \ncompliance  with  conditions  for  subprogram  II,  and  advise  on  actions  to  maintain  SDPL \nimplementation on course. To the extent possible, the review missions will be fielded jointly with \nAFD  and  KfW.  Within  3  months  from  completion  of  the  SDPL  or  at  such  time  as  deemed \nappropriate,  the  Government  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  consolidated  program \ncompletion report on the overall impact of the policy reforms implemented.  \n \n\na. \n\nSubprogram I \n\n88. \nThe loan for subprogram I is to be released in two tranches: (i) the first tranche of $25 \nmillion from ADF, upon compliance with the first tranche release conditions; and (ii) the second \ntranche of $35 million from ADF, upon fulfillment of the second tranche release conditions. The \nsecond  tranche  is  expected  to  be  released  18  months  from  loan  effectiveness,  but  may  be \nreleased  earlier  upon  compliance  with  the  specified  tranche  release  conditions.  ADB  and  the \nGovernment will jointly review progress in implementing specified policy actions approximately 3 \nmonths before the scheduled tranche releases. The first and second tranche release conditions \nare as set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 5).  \n \n89.  Where feasible, the Government is encouraged to undertake, during the implementation \nof  subprogram  I,  policy  measures  proposed  under  subprogram  II.  ADB  will  reflect  the \nGovernment's  achievements  and  refine  policy  actions  under  subprogram  II  accordingly,  taking \ninto consideration the policy environment for implementing subprogram II. The Government and \nADB have identified three conditions in subprogram II, as conditions for Board consideration for \nthat  subprogram  II  loan.  These  conditions  are  as  specified  in  the  policy  matrix.  Successful \n\n                                                 \n19  The importance of allocating an appropriate budget to the implementing agencies to ensure sustainable operations \nof systems developed in the SDPL, such as the NBIN under MPI and the centralized land registry under MONRE \nwas discussed with the Government. In the event of delays in fulfilling second tranche conditions of subprogram I, \nrelevant government agencies will be requested to provide information on budget allocation associated with such \nconditions. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 21\n\ncompletion of subprogram I and agreement to retain the three Board consideration conditions in \nsubprogram II will be a requisite for initiating subprogram II processing.  \n \n\nb. \n\nSubprogram II \n\n90. \nThe  proposed  loan  for  subprogram  II  will  be  processed  separately  after  the  successful \ncompletion of subprogram I and presented to the Board for approval. Subprogram II is expected \nto comprise a loan of $20 million equivalent from ADF and a loan of $20 million equivalent from \nOCR. Its tranching remains to be determined. Proposed conditions for subprogram II are set out \nin the policy matrix and are subject to revision and refinement following the assessment of the \nmacroeconomic  environment,  lessons  learned  from  implementing  subprogram  I,  and  overall \nprogress  in  SME  development-related  reforms.  However,  the  principal  concept  of  Board \nconsideration conditions must be maintained in subprogram II. The conditions for subprogram II \nare  envisioned  to  be  implemented  within  18  months  from  effectiveness  of  the  subprogram  II \nloan. \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n91. \nThe  advisory  technical  assistance  (ADTA)  will  provide  key  technical  inputs  for \nimplementing the SDPL and institutional capacity building support to implementing agencies on \na  selective  basis.    The  main  activities  of  the  TA  will  focus  on  (i)  technical,  legal,  and  policy-\nrelated assistance to the reform agenda based on international best practices, where applicable; \n(ii) institution-building activities, including fostering good governance and pilot implementation of \nnew systems; and (iii) new approaches to training and information dissemination.   \n \n92. \nGiven the extensive need for technical assistance in implementing the SDPL, a series of \nADTAs  are  proposed  for  consideration.  The  ADTA  to  be  attached  to  the  SDPL  will  support \nimplementation  of  SDPL\u2019s  subprogram  I.  Furthermore,  pending  availability  of  TA  funds,  both \nwithin ADB and from other aid agencies, additional assistance will be provided, in particular to \nbuild  the  capacity  of  the  implementing  agencies\u2013\u2013an  item  not  sufficiently  covered  under  the \naccompanying  ADTA\u2013\u2013and  to  support  the  policy  actions  in  subprogram  II.  Separately,  KfW \nproposes  an  ADTA  for  developing  the  leasing  industry,  while  AFD  proposes  an  ADTA  for \nimplementing a number of key policy actions associated with enhancing technical and industrial \nstandards.   \n \n93. \nFunding for the ADTA to be attached to the SDPL will not exceed $1,400,000 equivalent. \nADB will administer portions of the TA not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to be financed \non a grant basis by the Government of Denmark and the equivalent of $600,000 to be financed \non a grant by the Government of Switzerland. ADB will provide the balance not exceeding the \nequivalent of $500,000, on a grant basis, from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA will cover the \nentire  foreign  exchange  costs  and  part  of  the  local  currency  cost. 20  The  ADTA,  tentatively \nplanned  for  inception  in  November  2004,  will  be  implemented  over  9  months.  A  total  of  30 \nperson-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  44  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting  services  will  be  required.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. Procurement \nunder  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  objectives, \nscope, and implementation arrangements, including the budget of the ADTA, are in Appendix 8. \n \n\n                                                 \n20  A  second  ADTA  for  $300,000  is  currently  in  the  pipeline  to  support  the  implementation  of  SDPL  subprogram  II.  \n\nConfirmation of the TA will take place during the Country Programming Mission in 2005.  \n\n\f22\n\n \n\n \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impact \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nIn  resolving  legal,  institutional,  and  technical  constraints  that  disadvantage  SMEs  in \n94. \naccessing  credit,  acquiring  land-use  rights,  and  achieving  regulatory  compliance,  the  SDPL \ntakes  a  market-based  participatory  approach.  For  instance,  the  SDPL  acknowledges  the \nfundamental  role  of  information  for  markets  to  allocate  resources  efficiently  and  the  essential \nneed  for  all  market  participants  to  have  access  to  that  same  relevant  public  information.  The \nSDPL  utilizes  the  technology  available  today  in  making  as  much  pertinent  information  as \npossible obtainable in the public domain.  \n \nCollectively, the availability of information for doing business in Viet Nam is expected to \n95. \nsubstantially  increase,  thus  reducing  the  cost  and  risks  of  doing  business  for  all  enterprises. \nEnterprises  will  benefit  from  (i)  the  establishment  of  NBIN,  which  will  have  an  on-line  SME \ngateway  providing  information  on  procedures  to  comply  with  regulations,  Government  support \nprograms  for  SMEs,  business  associations,  and  other  business  support  providers;  (ii)  the \ndissemination  for  training  of  the  simplified  SME  accounting  system  through  the  Vietnamese \nAccounting  Association;  (iii)  impartial  dissemination  of  information  on  land-use  planning  and \nzoning; and (iv) an on-line database providing information on national and international technical \nand industrial standards.  \n \n96. \nThe  SDPL  also  introduces  information  technology  for  collecting  and  compiling \ninformation  and  data  nationwide.  The  current  fragmented  database  on  business  activities  and \nland usage constrains the Government and businesses in making informed decisions. Both the \nrollout of NBIN nationwide and adoption of a single land registry aim to make available timely, \naccurate, and comprehensive information covering all of Viet Nam. Such database is part of a \nmodern  infrastructure  required  for  efficient  functioning  of  markets  and  may  be  considered  as \npublic goods that help achieve transactional efficiencies.  \n \n97. \nAdopting  simple  and  uniform  systems  and  administrative  procedures  is  the  basic \nprinciple  that  guides  the  SDPL.  Simple  and  uniform  systems  and  administrative  procedures \nhave  the  merit  of  avoiding  confusion,  arbitrariness,  and  rent-seeking  behavior  in  delivering \npublic  services,  particularly  at  the  provincial  and  district levels.  They  also  bring  the  benefits  of \neconomies  of  scale  when  implemented  through  a  nationwide  system,  thus  reducing  the  total \ncost of service delivery. Concurrently, the cost of doing business for enterprises would also be \nreduced.  Specific  examples  in  the  SDPL  include  (i)  business  licensing  and  registration \nprocedures, (ii) simplified accounting system for SMEs, (iii) procedures for issuance of LURCs, \nand (iv) the uniform standardization systems.  \n \nThe  SDPL  also  calls  for  the  participation  of  business  representatives  in  the  SME \n98. \nPromotion Council, the highest advisory body for policy making in support of SME development, \nand  SME  representation  in  the  National  Committee  of  Standardization  and  other  relevant \nindustry and technical committees for standardization. SMEs' participation is essential to ensure \nthat  their  specific  competitive  disadvantages  and  unique  business  opportunities  within  the \nVietnamese  commercial  and  industrial  environment  are  fully  considered  in  the  process  of \nformulating  policies,  rules,  and  regulations.  Their  representation  will  not  only  help  eliminate \nunfair policy bias against SMEs but also encourage transparency and stakeholder consultation \nto the benefit of the economy as a whole.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 23\n\nThe positive elements incorporated in the SDPL will increasingly be felt as the existing \n99. \nsystems  are  transformed  and  modernized  to  better  support  a  progressively  market-oriented \neconomy. Successful implementation of the SDPL will form the basis for further developing the \nprivate sector in Viet Nam.  \n \nB. \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\n100.  There  are  three  principal  risks  in  implementing  the  SDPL.  The  first  is  in  effective \ncoordination  and  cooperation  within  the  Government,  both  horizontally  among  different \nministries  and  agencies  concerned  and  vertically  with  the  provincial  and  district  authorities. \nConsultation  and  coordination  with  the  private  sector  and  the  aid  community  active  in  SME \ndevelopment  will  also  be  required.  It  is  expected  that  coordination  and  cooperation  among  all \nstakeholders  will  gradually  improve  with  the  increased  capacity  of  the  Agency  for  SME \nDevelopment,  thus  reducing  the  risk  of  overlap  and  inconsistencies  in  SME  support  activities. \nTA in support of SDPL implementation will also include capacity building for the Agency for SME \nDevelopment to reduce this risk. \n \n101.  A  second  risk  pertains  to  good  governance  in  the  central,  provincial,  and  district \ngovernments. Governance at the provincial and district level is particularly important, since the \npositive  impact  of  the  SDPL  requires  effective  implementation  of  policies  at  the  ground  level. \nThese  risks  are  common  to  several  programs  and  are  being  addressed  through  the \nimplementation of the comprehensive Public Administration Reform Master Program for 2001\u2013\n2010, which is being supported by ADB.21\n \n102.  A  third  risk  relates  to  the  technical  capacities  of  implementing  agencies.  Experience \nsuggests  that,  given  adequate  technical  support,  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  reforms  is \nstrong.  In  implementing  previous  programs,  delays  were  caused  predominantly  by  the  lack  of \ntechnical expertise and of the consensus-building approach in enacting of laws and regulations. \nTo reduce this risk, the TA was formulated through discussions with all implementing agencies \nat the technical level. Many requirements pertain to completing the legal framework and putting \nin  place  modern \nthe \ntechnology-based  systems, \nexperience of other countries. The SDPL will also involve coordination with aid agencies active \nin their respective areas in each component.  \n \n\ninto  consideration \n\ninformation \n\ntaking \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n103. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nThe policies adopted and actions taken before the date of the Loan Agreement \nas described in the development policy letter (Appendix 5) will continue to be in \neffect for the duration of the SDPL period; and \n\nThe  Government  will  promptly  adopt  such  policies  and  take  other  actions \nincluded  in  the  SDPL  and  specified  in  the  development  policy  letter,  and  will \n\n                                                 \n21  ADB. 2003.

The \nmain  sources  of  data  are  the  national  statistical  network  with  data  collected  by  the  General \nStatistical Office (GSO), and the National Business Information Network (NBIN) of the Ministry \nof Planning and Investment (MPI). Some tentative conclusions as to the size and diversity of the \nsector can be drawn, using data collected by these organizations for other purposes.  \n\n3. \nSME  data  are  scarce  and  fragmented,  and  their  reliability  is  suspect.  There  is  a \nsignificant gap with respect to the availability of reliable statistical information on the registration \nand  performance  of  SMEs.  Available  data  often  aggregate  all  types  of  enterprises  including \nstate-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  non-SOEs  and  foreign  invested  enterprises.  This  makes  the \nanalysis complex. Efforts have been made to disaggregate the data to the most usable extent \npossible  to  provide  a  reasonable  understanding  of  the  Vietnamese  SME  sector,  but  the \nfundamental shortcomings in the data sets used remain. \n\n4. \nThis said, there is a consistent view that SMEs constitute an overwhelming proportion of \ntotal  enterprises  in  Viet  Nam;  SMEs  are  most  active  in  commerce,  trade,  repair  and \nmanufacturing; and SMEs are major employment creators.   \n\n5. \nTable A2.1 outlines the overall profile of enterprises in Viet Nam during 1998\u20132002. It is \nestimated that as of 31 December 2002 Viet Nam had about 736,000 registered enterprises in \nall sectors. This number does not include the several million informal household enterprises not \nobliged to register at local government offices.  \n\nTable A2.1: Profile of Firms in Viet Nam as of 31 December 2002 \n\nType of Firm \n\nFirms with Tax Codes \n   SOEs  \n   Non-SOEs \n   FIEs \n\nSubtotal \n\nSOEs (% of total) \nNon-SOEs (% of total) \nFIEs (% of total) \n\nFirms without Tax Codes \n\nTotal \n\nSubtotal \nTotal \n\n1998 \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n \n\n \n\n6,498 \n26,335 \n881 \n33,714 \n19 \n78 \n3 \n100 \n\n \n\n \n\n6,235 \n33,939 \n959 \n41,133 \n15 \n83 \n2 \n100 \n\n \n\n \n\n5,813 \n45,294 \n1,063 \n52,170 \n11 \n87 \n2 \n100 \n\n \n\n \n\n5,587 \n62,068 \n1,127 \n68,782 \n8 \n90 \n2 \n100 \n\n \n\n \n\n5,256 \n81,188 \n1,194 \n87,638 \n6 \n93 \n1 \n100 \n\n559,234 \n592,948 \n\n577,065 \n618,198 \n\n602,798 \n654,968 \n\n625,484 \n694,266 \n\n648,284 \n735,922 \n\nSOE = state-owned enterprise, FIE = foreign invested enterprise.  \nSource: General Statistical Office, 2003. \n\n \n\n   \n   \n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n34\n \n\nGSO  data  allow  the  disaggregation  of  only  those  enterprises  with  tax  codes.  Those \n6. \nwithout  tax  codes  are  assumed  to  be  household  enterprises  or  small  enterprises  in  terms  of \ncapital, labor, and revenue. The number of tax-coded enterprises is reported to have increased \nfrom 33,714 in 1998 to 87,638 in 2002, with an average growth rate of 27% per annum during \n1998\u20132002. In 2002, non-SOEs accounted for 93% of total enterprises, while SOEs accounted \nfor 6% and FIEs for 1%. The number of SOEs is observed to have declined from 6,498 in 1998 \nto 5,256 enterprises in 2002 due to SOE equitization.  \n\nIn  1998  there  were  592,234  non-tax-coded  enterprises.  The  number  increased  to \n7. \n649,284 in 2002, with an annual growth rate of 4%. These enterprises account for some 88% of \ntotal enterprises in 2002 and they are assumed to be small in size and scope of operation. As \nthere  are  no  systematic  statistical  data  on  these  enterprises,  the  analysis  will  assume  that \nenterprises  without  tax  codes  have  registered  capital  below  D10  billion,  employ  less  than  300 \nemployees, and hence are SMEs.  \n\n8. \nTable A2.2 shows that based on the registered capital criterion, at the end of 2002, there \nwere 84,371 enterprises with registered capital below D10 billion. SMEs accounted for 99.6% of \ntotal  enterprises,  assuming  that  those  SMEs  without  tax  codes  have  registered  capital  of  less \nthan  D10  billion.  For  each  individual  year  during  1998\u20132002,  SMEs  were  over  99%  of  total \nenterprises and their annual growth rate in number was on average 5%. SMEs are observed to \nbe predominantly in the category of less than D1 billion in registered capital, accounting for an \naverage proportion of 97% of total enterprises.  \n\nTable A2.2: Classification of Firms by Registered Capital \n\n \n \nRegistered Capital \n\n \n\n \n\nSMEs \nWithout Tax Codes \nWith Tax Codes \n<1.0 billion \n1.0\u20133.0 billion \n3.1\u20135.0 billion \n5.1\u201310.0 billion \n\nTotal SMEs \n\nLarge Firms \n>10.0 billion \nTotal Large Firms \nTotal Firms \n\n1998 \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n \n \n\n   \n\nFirms \n(no.) \n\n% of \nTotal \nFirms \n\nFirms \n(no.) \n\n% of \nTotal \nFirms\n\nFirms \n(no.) \n\n% of \nTotal \nFirms\n\n559,234  94.3    577,065\n\n   \n\n \n24,686 \n3,973 \n2,368 \n1,624 \n\n4.2    29,709\n5,057\n0.7   \n3,011\n0.4   \n2,055\n0.3   \n591,884  99.8    616,896\n\n93.3 \n \n4.8 \n0.8 \n0.5 \n0.3 \n99.8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n602,798\n\n36,135\n7,063\n4,313\n2,914\n653,222\n\n \n\n \n\n92.0 \n \n5.5 \n1.1 \n0.7 \n0.4 \n99.7 \n\nFirms \n(no.) \n\n625,484\n\n45,305\n10,326\n6,410\n4,301\n691,826\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n% of \nTotal \nFirms \n\nFirms \n(no.) \n\n% of \nTotal \nFirms\n\n \n\n   \n90.1    648,284\n\n \n\n   \n\n6.5    55,231\n1.5    14,335\n8,870\n0.9   \n5,935\n0.6   \n99.6    732,655\n   \n0.4   \n0.4   \n\n \n\n \n\n88.1 \n \n7.5 \n1.9 \n1.2 \n0.8 \n99.6 \n\n   \n0.2   \n0.2   \n\n1,064 \n1,064 \n\n0.2 \n0.2 \n592,948  100.0    618,198 100.0\n\n1,302\n1,302\n\n1,746\n1,746\n\n0.3 \n0.3 \n654,968 100.0\n\n2,440\n2,440\n\n0.4 \n0.4 \n694,266 100.0    735,922 100.0\n\n3,267\n3,267\n\nSME = small and medium-sized enterprise. \nSource: General Statistical Office, 2003. \n\n9. \nTable A2.3 shows that in 2002, 733,453 enterprises (99.7% of total enterprises) had less \nthan 300 employees.

However,  since  the  SMEs  constitute  an  overwhelming \nproportion of enterprises in Viet Nam, their contribution to GDP may be regarded as significant. \nPrevious  studies  indicated  that  an  overwhelming  proportion  of  private  enterprises  in  Viet  Nam \ncould  be  categorized  as  SMEs.1  Though  data  on  the  contribution  of  the  SME  sector  to  the \n\n                                                 \n1   See, for example United Nations Industrial Development Organization-Ministry of Planning and Investment.

SMEs tend to be more labor intensive than large enterprises, and so create more job \nopportunities per unit of capital invested. Their development will help absorb the one million or \nso new entrants to the Vietnamese labor market each year.  \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nlimited  companies,  42.4%  of  shareholding  (joint  stock)  companies,  and  65.9%  of  SOEs.  Thus,  one can  say  that \nalmost  all  non-state  registered  enterprises  are  SMEs.

The road map is also expected to serve as the basis \nfor the Government\u2019s SME development action program.   \n\nAfter  a  brief  review  of  the  status  of  the  SME  sector  in  Viet  Nam  and  current  external \n2. \nsupport  to  the  sector,  the  SME  road  map  makes  a  diagnostic  analysis  that  covers  three \ninterrelated areas: \n\nThe  business  environment.  This  covers  the  creation  of  an  appropriate  policy, \nlegal, and regulatory framework for enterprise growth; \n\nAccess  to  resources. This covers access of enterprises to essential resources \n(infrastructure, human resources, and finance in particular); and \n\nEnterprise support. This addresses the provision of enterprise support services \nwhere there is market failure. \n\nIn  each  case,  the  present  situation  in  Viet  Nam  and  the  issues  and  constraints  are \n3. \ndescribed, a future vision based on best practice is identified, and the short-, medium- and long-\nterm reform agenda are proposed. \n\n4. \n\nThe diagnostic analysis of the business environment covers \n\npolicy  and  its  institutionalization,  including  matters  pertaining  to  SMEs  in  the \nnational  development  plan, \nthe  Government,  organizational \nthe  Government,  stakeholder  consultation,  Government \nresponsibilities \nsupport policies, and policy evaluation; and \n\nrole  of \n\nin \n\nthe  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  including  matters  pertaining  to  enterprise \nestablishment  and  operation,  financial  reporting,  taxation,  contracts  and  dispute \nsettlement, bankruptcy, land use, technical standards, banking and finance, and \ncompetition. \n\n5. \n\nThe diagnostic analysis of access to resources covers \n\nnonfinancial  resources,  including  matters  pertaining  to  land  and  property,  and \nhuman resources with reference to enterprise education, enterprise culture, and \nlabor markets; and \n\naccess  to  finance,  including  matters  pertaining  to  equity  financing,  lending, \nleasing, and guarantee schemes. \n\n6. \nThe  diagnostic  analysis  of  enterprise  support  covers  business  development  services, \nincluding  training,  consultancy  and  advisory  services,  marketing,  market  information  and \npromotion,  technology  information,  technology  development  and  transfer,  and  business \nlinkages.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n\f \n\nTime Period: \n\n \n\nShort Term: \n2004\u20132007 \nMedium-Term: \n2008\u20132010 \nLong-Term:  \n2011\u20132014 \nShort-Term \n\nMajor \nDonor \n\nUNIDO \n\nGTZ \n\nLong-Term \n\n  \n\n38\n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nIn conclusion the SME road map draws together a consolidated analysis of the visions \n7. \nand  the  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term  reform  plans  in  each  of  three  areas.

strategy and \naction plan. \n\nDevelop and sustain a planning \nsystem that ensures an integrated \nnational SME development strategy \nand action plan. \n\nThere is overorientation to \nthe provision of private \ngoods by Government. \n\nReorient the role of Government to \ncreating an enabling environment, \nhelping to compensate only for \nmarket failures, and provide only \npublic not private goods. \n\nOrganizational \nResponsibilities \n\n \n\nResources allocated are \ninadequate to allow \nGovernment to fulfill its \nrole in SME development. \n\nIncrease the resources of the MPI

\nindependent parties. \n\nUpgrade the definition of SMEs to \ninclude in the criteria turnover and \nbalance sheet values, the principle \nof autonomy of ownership, and sub-\ndefinitions of micro, small, and \nmedium-sized enterprises. \n\nPrepare an intervention policy \nstatement based on addressing \nmarket failure, clarifying the specific \nobjectives and criteria for \nintervention, the requirements if any \nfor public subsidy, the expected \noutcomes, and the means of \nmonitoring and measuring \nperformance. \n\nReliable statistical \ninformation about the \nSME sector is absent.

statutory \nresponse times. \n\nThere is no assessment of \nthe impact of legislation \non the SME sector. \n\nEstablish a framework for public \nconsultation, regulatory impact \nassessment, and monitoring of \nregulatory impact on SMEs. \n\nEstablish a simplified accounting \nsystem for SMEs.  \n\nCertain accounting \nregulations are incomplete \nand certain regulations \nare inconsistent. \n\nPrepare for SMEs full guidance on \naccounting systems and clarify fully \nhow Viet Nam Accounting System \nwill apply to SMEs. \n\nFinancial \nReporting \n\nCurrent accounting \nsystems are too complex \nfor SMEs. \n\nTaxation \n\n \n\nThere are differential tax \ntreatments that penalize \ndomestic enterprises. \n\nThere are vague and \ncontradictory tax \nincentives. \n\nIntroduce a tax regime that does not \ndifferentiate on the basis of \nownership between foreign and \ndomestic enterprises. \n\nSimplify the tax incentive regime for \ndomestic enterprises, merge it with \nthe tax incentive regime for foreign \nenterprises, and clearly define \neligibility for incentives minimizing \nthe scope for official discretion in \ninterpretation. \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n39\n\n \n\nTime

This  will  be  achieved  through  an  average  annual \neconomic growth rate of 7.5%, social progress and equity in income distribution, and development of corruption-free \nand  efficient  state  functions.  Given  the  slower  growth  prospect  of  the  agriculture  sector,  relative  decline  of  foreign \ndirect investments to gross domestic product (GDP), and the pressing need to restructure the state-owned enterprise \n(SOE)  sector,  the  Government  now  regards  the  private  sector  as  the  main  engine  for  the  next  round  of  economic \ngrowth  and  employment  generation.  The  Government  expects  the  activities  of  the  private  sector,  which  consists \nmostly  of  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs),  to  lead  economic  growth.  Under  Comprehensive  Poverty \nReduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS), the private/SME sector has created and is expected to continue to create \n90% of the 1.5 million new jobs annually to 2010. Development of the private/SME sector is also expected to expand \nthe tax base for Viet Nam, thus increasing the opportunity for social spending. Due to the importance the Government \nplaces  on  developing  the  private/SME  sector  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  many  policy  actions \nsupported under the SME Development Program Loan (SDPL) are also  specified in the CPRGS as requisite reform \nmeasures.  The  poverty  analysis  section  below  identifies  policy  actions  proposed  under  the  SDPL  that  are  also \nincluded in the CPRGS. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nIntroduction \n \n\nPoverty Classification: Others \n\nThe  goal  of  the  SDPL  is  to  improve  SMEs  competitiveness  and  enhance  their  potential  contribution  to \neconomic  growth  and  employment  generation,  to  enable  them  to  help  reduce  poverty  incidence  in  the  country.  The \nobjective  is  to  support  the  Government  in  undertaking  measures  to  (i)  enhance  SMEs\u2019  policy  and  regulatory \nframework,  (ii)  improve  SMEs\u2019  access  to  key  financial  and  physical  resources,  and  (iii)  facilitate  SMEs\u2019  access  to \ndomestic and international markets. Policy conditions proposed under the SDPL are specific to achieving the Program \nobjectives. Each  was reviewed in terms of its outcomes and expected  economic and social  impacts  as summarized \nbelow.  \n \nI.   Developing an Enabling Policy and Regulatory Environment \n \n\nPolicy  actions  proposed  for  developing  an  enabling  policy  and  regulatory  environment  for  SMEs  fall  under \ntwo  components:  (A)  improving  the  current  business  registration  and  licensing  systems,  and  (B)  establishing  the \nGovernment's  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  SME  development  through  a  coordinated  plan  based  on  public-\nprivate  partnership.  Policy  actions  under  component  (A)  include  measures  for  simplifying  registration  and  licensing \nprocedures  so  as  to  make  establishment  of  new  businesses  easier  and  encourage  businesses  to  enter  the  formal \nsector.  Such  measures  are  identified  under  the  CPRGS  as  requirements  for  poverty  reduction.  The  proposed \ncomputerization  of  business  registration  will  do  away  with  arbitrary  administrative  procedures,  promote  good \ngovernance,  reduce  transaction  costs  for  SMEs,  and  increase  accessibility.  Ex  ante  regulatory  impact  review  will \nensure  that  unnecessary  licenses  that  discourage  SME  establishment  and  growth  are  reconsidered,  while  ex  post \nreview  will  provide  feedback  to  policymakers  on  measures  adopted  for  improvement.  A  simple  and  transparent \nregulatory regime will reduce the costs for establishing businesses and complying with statutory rules and regulations, \nand help accelerate the growth of the SME sector and create new employment opportunities, including those for the \npoor. The policy actions will also support good governance and combat corruption, both acknowledged in the region \nas crucial in fighting poverty. \n \n\nPolicy actions under component (B) supports the inclusion of private sector members to the SME Promotion \nCouncil to ensure that SMEs' views are better represented in policy making and program formulation. The long-term \nSME development action program to be adopted by the Government  will provide a comprehensive basis to address \nmany constraints to SME development, facilitating establishment and operations of SMEs, and giving them access to \nkey resources. The action program is expected to serve as a guideline for interministerial and aid coordination.  \n\n(The Poverty Partnership Agreement was signed on 25 February 2002. Poverty incidence has declined from 37% in\n1998 to 29% in 2002.) \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n63\n\nTo enhance information flow to the SMEs, component (B) also supports the establishment of an on-line SME-\ninformation  web  site  (\u201cinformation  gateway\u201d),  which  includes  (i)  information  on  market,  government  regulations,  and \nother topics of interest to SMEs; (ii) an SME statistical database; and (iii) linkages with the General Statistical Office \nand  the  National  Business  Information  Network.  The  direct  impact  will  be  more  effectively  planned  and  executed \npolicies  and  programs,  availability  of  comprehensive  information  for  SMEs  through  the  gateway,  and  heightened \npublic  awareness  of  the  SME  sector.  Lack  of  information  on  SMEs  has  been  identified  as  a  major  constraint  to  be \naddressed  under  the  CPRGS  and  a  two-way  information  flow  is  a  requisite  reform  measure.  Cost  for  accessing \ninformation on regulations relevant to SMEs, and programs and services available to SMEs will be minimum and will \nbe  affordable  to  the  poor.  However,  equipment  and  some  technical  knowledge  will  be  required  to  access  the \ninformation.  \n  \nII.   Enhancing SME's Access to Finance \n \n\nEnhancing  SME's  access  to  finance  has  four  components:  (A)  reducing  the  costs  and  risks  of  lending  to \nSMEs by developing an SME accounting system, (B) reducing the costs and risks of lending to SMEs by making land-\nuse certificates available as collateral, (C) improving SMEs' access to finance through expansion of the use of leasing, \nand  (D)  reducing  costs  and  risks  of  lending  secured  by  movable  property.  Under  component  (A),  proposed  policy \nactions  include  issuance  of  clarifications  on  Decisions  1177  and  144  on  the  Accounting  System  for  SMEs  in \naccordance with the new Accounting Law; a simplified and clear SME accounting system based on Vietnamese and \nInternational  Accounting  Standards;  and  the  Vietnamese  Accounting  Association  (VAA)  and  its  SME  Accounting \nCenter  to  develop  a  program  to  disseminate  and  train  SMEs  and  business  associations  on  SME  accounting. \nSimplifying the accounting system will assist SME owners and managers to better plan for and manage their limited \nresources. An accounting system that is easy to understand and apply will also encourage formalization of enterprises \nand reduce costs for preparing financial statements and thereby enable SMEs to access credit from banks and other \nformal financial institutions. Accounting systems are the basis of good corporate governance and better business risk \nmanagement.  A  simplified  accounting  system  will  support  the  establishment  and  growth  of  SMEs,  and  creation  of \nmore jobs. It will also allow the Government to expand its tax base and increase social spending to aid the poor.  \n \n\nPolicy  actions  proposed  under  component  (B)  aims  to  make  the  legislative  framework  for  land  simple  and \ntransparent.  It  will  benefit  SMEs  and  the  poor  alike  as  the  law  becomes  easier  to  understand  and  its  registration \nprocess simple and transparent. The centralized land registration system will be computerized so as to streamline the \nsystem  for  the  benefit  of  the  public  as  a  whole,  including  the  poor.  A  single  land  use  registry  will  ensure  clarity  and \nsecurity of title, and improve the use of land as collateral. The cost of land registration and accessing information on \nland  will be minimum and  will be affordable to the poor. However, equipment and some technical knowledge  will be \nrequired  for  accessing  information  on  land.  Developing  a  functional  land  market  will  remove  distortions  and \npreferential  access  to  land.  Market-based  pricing  of  land  will  improve  valuation  for  purposes  of  collateral.  The \neconomy on the whole will benefit through more efficient allocation of resources, lower transaction costs, and greater \ninvestment to improve sites and premises. Market-based valuation of land is likely to increase tax revenues from land \nto  enable  the  Government  to  increase  spending  on  the  poor.  A  modernized  land  management  system  by  the \nGovernment will further promote good governance and combat corruption, crucial in fighting poverty. \n \n\nPolicy  actions  proposed  under  components  (C)  and  (D)  will  expand  the  use  of  leasing  and  movable \ncollaterals to enable SMEs to access credit. The leasing industry, while still small in size relative to the banking sector, \npredominantly serves the SMEs by financing equipment. Policy actions support diversification of leasing products and \nsources  of  funding  for  leasing  companies.  Improved  operational  viability  of  the  leasing  sector,  and  creation  of  an \nalternative source of funding for leasing companies in particular, will help expand the coverage of leasing companies. \nEnhanced operation of the National Registry for Secured Transactions (NRAST) will, on the other hand, support the \nuse  of  equipment,  inventories,  and  receivables  as  collateral  for  bank  loans,  also  aiding  SMEs  in  accessing  credit \nthrough  formal  financial  institutions.  Moreover,  the  economic  gains  expected  from  higher  use  of  NRAST  is  far-\nreaching, as it will benefit not only the SMEs but all entities involved in extending credit backed by collateral.  \n \n\nThe  policy  actions  under  the  four  components  aim  to  resolve  SMEs  limited  access  to  finance,  long-term \nfinancing  in  particular,  and  thereby  promote  sustainable  growth  of  SMEs.  The  benefits  of  simple,  transparent,  and \neffective  frameworks  of  accounting,  land  registration,  leasing,  and  secured  transactions  system  will  be  felt  by  all \nenterprises. The proposed policy actions will support good governance and sustainable economic growth, and make \npositive contributions toward poverty reduction. \n \nIII.  Improving SME's Access to Land by Completing the Legal Framework for Land \n \n\nThe  SDPL  supported  the  enactment  of  a  new  land  law,  which  includes  (i)  issuance  of  a  uniform  system  of \nland-use  certificates;  (ii)  simplified  land  registration;  (iii)  requiring  information  on  land  availability  to  be  made  public; \nand (iv) promoting property market development. To support the implementation of the new Land Law, and to further \n\n\f \n64\n\nAppendix 6 \n\nencourage  formalization  of  landholding,  an  implementing  decree  to  the  new  Land  Law  will  be  issued.  The \nimplementing  decree  will  include  (i)  legal  leasing  of  the  land  by  existing  tenants  subject  to  their  compliance  with \nregulations, and (ii) administrative penalties against government officials who fail to make public information on land \nuse planning and zoning information as required by the Land Law. Simplified and transparent procedures for assigning \nof land or leasing land to SMEs will improve SMEs\u2019 access to land. A modernized legal framework for land and land \nadministration  is  a  requirement  under  the  CPRGS  and  is  expected  to  promote  good  governance  and  to  combat \ncorruption related to land use, known to negatively impact the poor in particular.  \n \n\nTo enhance access to land and also to encourage a more active market for land use, a circular on the new \nLand Law will be issued. The circular will include (i) uniform procedures for all local agencies on issuance of land-use \nrights certificates and subsequent registration of land-use rights, and (ii) uniform information collection on the issued \nland-use rights certificates by all local agencies. Increased transparency and consistency  will result in more efficient \nuse  of  land,  lower  transaction  costs,  and  better  access  to  land  by  SMEs.  An  on-line  system  for  disseminating \ninformation on land will be made available to the public and affordable to the poor. However, access to equipment and \ntechnical knowledge will be required to retrieve the information. \n \nIV.  Improving SME's Access to International Markets through Enhanced Industrial and Technical Standards \n \n\nThere are two components for improving SME's access to international markets through enhanced industrial \nand  technical  standards:  (A)  lowering  the  structural  barrier  on  industrial  and  technical  standards  for  SMEs  by \ncompleting the legal framework, and (B) undertaking institutional reforms and encouraging public-private partnership \u2013 \nincluding an information system for SMEs. Component (A) includes policy actions for: reducing regulatory compliance \nburdens on technical standards, a draft Ordinance on Technical Standardization to develop a uniform standardization \nsystem; enhancing public confidence in the certification institutions by requiring that any certification body operating in \nViet Nam must be accredited by an Accreditation Body that is a mutual recognition agreement signatory member of \nthe International Accreditation Forum, or Pacific Accreditation Cooperation, or by Viet Nam's Board of Accreditation; \nand  bringing  standardization  in  line  with  best  practices  by  supporting  submission  of  an  Ordinance  on  Technical \nStandardization  to  the  National  Assembly.    An  improved  standards'  framework  will  reduce  the  costs  of  compliance, \nfacilitate  comparison  of  products  by  consumers,  and  generally  allow  for  better  compliance  with  standards  by \nenterprises,  including  SMEs.  Arbitrary  setting  of  standards,  which  increases  compliance  costs,  will  be  reduced  and \napplication of international standards and accreditation practices will boost public confidence as well as the potential \nfor  higher  exports.  The  overall  impact  will  be  enhanced  competitiveness  of  SMEs,  and  increased  opportunities  to \naccess domestic, regional, and international markets. \n \n\nPolicy  actions  under  component  (B)  include  an  on-line  database,  providing  information  to  the  SMEs  on  (i) \nnational standards of other countries, international standards, and cross-recognition schemes; (ii) certification bodies, \ntesting  laboratories,  and  quality  management  providers  in  Viet  Nam;  and  (iii)  relevant  information  on  technology \ntransfer, legally separating Directorate for Standards and Quality\u2019s (STAMEQ\u2019s) commercial and state administrative \nactivities  and  ensuring  SME  representation  on  the  National  Technical  Committee  of  Standardization  and  on  the \nindustry technical committees of standardization for standards development. The extensive database on technical and \nindustrial standards will aid the SMEs in becoming more aware of and making informed efforts toward meeting those \nstandards.  This  will  facilitate  their  access  to  both  domestic  and  international  markets.  The  separation  of  commercial \nand administrative functions will improve corporate governance, increase competition, and promote public confidence \nin standards and testing. SME\u2019s representation on the National Technical Committee and industry committees will help \nto make the standards increasingly appropriate for SMEs.  \n \n\nThe  measures  proposed  under  this  component  will  result  in  a  more  pragmatic,  efficient,  and  transparent \nprocess for setting standards and obtaining certifications. SMEs will benefit from reduced compliance costs and higher \ncapacity  to  access  both  domestic  and  international  markets.  Increased  level  of  exports  by  SMEs  will  support  the \nviability of their long-term operations and contribute toward economic growth and poverty reduction. \n \nConclusion \n \n\nThe impacts of the SDPL on economic growth and employment generation are assessed to be significantly \n\npositive. No adverse impact requiring mitigating measures was identified.  \n\n \nGiven  the  current  limitations  on  data  collection,  quantifying  the  impact  of  the  Program  and  the  proposed \npolicy actions on the poor is extremely difficult. This serious obstacle in monitoring the economic and social impact of \nthe  Program  will  be  overcome  through  (i)  the  establishment  of  the  National  Business  Information  Network,  and  (ii) \nannual reports on the status of SMEs, both supported under the SDPL. The Program will closely monitor outcomes, \nand  economic  and  social  impacts  throughout  its  implementation  to  ensure  that  there  are  no  adverse  impacts  to  the \npoor and the vulnerable. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n65\n\n \nC.

The goal is to help the Government create a business environment conducive to \nSME development by (i) providing specific and detailed technical inputs based on international \nbest practices, where appropriate; (ii) formulating specific programs to support capacity-building \nefforts of the Government; and (iii) developing ways to effectively disseminate the findings and \nrelated information to ensure effective participation from the private sector. \n \nB. \n\nScope \n\n2. \nThe  TA  is  expected  to  focus  on  three  major  components:  (i)  providing  technical,  legal, \nand policy-related assistance to the reform agenda based on international best practices, where \nappropriate;  (ii)  formulating  and  delivering  institution-building  activities,  including  governance \nreform and pilot implementation of new systems; and (iii) developing a systematic approach to \ntraining  and  information  dissemination.  These  components  aim  to  help  SMEs  address \nconstraints  in  accessing  domestic  and  international  markets.  More  specifically,  the  expected \noutputs of the TA fall under four groups. \n \n\nThe  SME  development  action  program.  The  outputs  include  a  long-term, \ninterministerial  development  framework  for  SMEs,  to  be  adopted  by  the \nGovernment,  with  an  information  system  for  effective  dissemination,  and  an \nimplementing guideline on Decree 90.  \n\nBusiness  registration  and  licensing  reform.  The  outputs  include  a  legal  and \ninstitutional framework to enhance the current regulatory regime. \n\nAn SME accounting system. The outputs include the system itself and a training \nand  dissemination  program  for  the  SME  sector  and  accounting  professionals  in \nViet Nam. \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nA registration system for immovable and movable assets. The outputs include a \nlegal and institutional framework for the registries and pilot implementation.  \n\n \n3. \nThe TA will comprise two phases. In phase 1, the following technical documents will be \ndrafted: (i) the SME development framework (action program); (ii) a business licensing system \nand  plan  for  expansion  of  National  Business  Information  Network  (NBIN);  (iii)  an  SME \naccounting  system;  and  (iv)  an  enhanced  framework  for  use  of  movable  and  immovable \ncollaterals  \u2013  including  a  land  price  valuation  system,  in  consultation  with  the  Government  and \nprivate  sector  representatives  concerned.  On  the  basis  of  the  frameworks,  phase  2  will \nundertake  the  related  implementation  components,  including  the  operations  of  NBIN  and  land \nregistration.   \n \nC. \n\nMethodology and Key Activities \n\n4. \nThe TA will fund consultants with expertise in the SME sector and related areas (paras. \n2\u20133).  They  will  conduct  in-depth  consultations  with  the  Government  and  private  sector \n\n \n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 8 \n\nstakeholders.  A  consultative  approach,  which  is  an  integral  part  of  the  process  to  produce \ntargeted  outputs,  will  be  followed  by  a  number  of  roundtable  discussions  and  workshops  for \nskills and knowledge transfer needed to implement the policy conditions under the SDPL. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will monitor the process closely to ensure the quality of outputs, \nincluding training. \n \n5. \nThe consultants will prepare a detailed work plan before the start of services, which will \ninclude a timetable for deliverables defined under each component of the TA. The consultants \nwill be required to submit interim reports within the deadline specified in the work plan agreed \nupon with ADB. All reports will be reviewed by the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), \nthe  Implementing  Agencies  (IAs),  and  ADB.  Draft  final  reports  will  be  submitted  within  the \ndeadline  specified  in  the  work  plans  after  incorporation  of  feedback  from  MPI,  IAs,  and  ADB. \nTripartite  meetings  will  be  held  before  finalizing  the  draft  final  reports.  The  final  report, \nincorporating comments from MPI, IAs, and ADB during and after the tripartite meetings, should \nbe submitted upon completion of service. The TA is scheduled to begin in November 2004 and \nto be completed by August 2005. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n6. \nThe TA is estimated to cost a total of $1,625,000 equivalent, comprising $1,220,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $405,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  The  Government  has  requested \nADB to finance $1,400,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $180,000 \nequivalent  of  the  local  currency  costs.  The  TA  is  financed  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program \n($500,000)  and  is  cofinanced  by  both  Danish  Consultancy  Trust  Fund  ($300,000)  and  Swiss \nConsultant  Trust  Fund  ($600,000).  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  $225,000 \nequivalent  of  the  local  currency  costs,  including  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space, \nadministrative services, and physical facilities. The cost estimates and the financing plan are in \nTable  A8.  ADB  will  engage  a  team  of  international  and  domestic  consultants  to  provide \nconsulting services of 74 person-months. Where deemed necessary for expeditious provision of \nassistance  to  the  implementing  agencies,  ADB  may  also  consider  engagement  of  individual \nconsultants.  The  contract  with  the  consultants  will  be  based  on  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection process and the simplified technical proposal will be used. Procurement under the TA \nwill  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants  are  in  the  supplementary  appendix.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n69\n\n \n \n \nTable A8: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n($) \n \n\nItem \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  Foreign Exchange Local Currency    Total Cost\n\nA.
