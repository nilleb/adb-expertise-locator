I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  India  for  the  Sustainable  Coastal  Protection  and \nManagement Investment Program.  \n \n2.  The investment program will address immediate coastal protection needs and coastal \ninstability  using  environmentally  and  socially  appropriate  solutions,  with  a  focus  on  softer \noptions such as artificial reefs, beach nourishments, and dune management in the states of \nGoa, Karnataka, and Maharashtra.1  It will also develop institutional capacities to meet the long-\nterm  needs  of  sustainable  coastal  protection  and  management,  and  support  initiatives  to \nincrease  the  participation  of  the  private  sector  and  communities  in  coastal  protection  and \nmanagement. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Development  problems. India has a coastline of 7,525 kilometers (km)\u20145,425 km \nalong the nine national coastal states of the mainland and 2,100 km in the union territories. \nAbout 20%\u201325% of its population lives within 50 km of the coast, with 70% of them residing in \nrural areas. All the coastal states and territories are affected by coastal erosion. Coastline \nerosion over the years has intensified in the west coast\u2014in the states of Goa, Karnataka, and \nMaharashtra\u2014on  which  the  investment  program  will  focus.2  In  these  states,  50%  of  the \n1,100 km of coastline is facing erosion; about 530 km are prone to erosion and 330 km require \nprotection.  At the current rate of seawall and other constructions along the shorelines, the \nprime beaches could become almost extinct in the next 20 years. The rise in sea levels and the \nlikely  increased  frequency  and  intensity  of  storms  will  aggravate  the  erosion,  with  serious \neconomic and environmental consequences for coastal states. The sea level rise is projected to \nbe  from  15 centimeters  to  38 centimeters  in  the  Indian  subcontinent  by  the  middle  of  the \ncentury. A rise of 1 meter in sea level is projected to displace 7.1 million people in India, with a \nloss of 5,764 square km of land and 4,200 km of roads. \n \n4.  Coastal  erosion  is  caused  by  both  natural  (such  as  storms  and  currents)  and \nanthropogenic (including dams, riverbed quarrying, harbors, and inlet stabilization) effects. In \nIndia, numerous examples show how human activities have contributed to or caused coastal \nerosion. These include change in sediment supply through dredging, river damming, and sand \nmining or the construction of littoral barriers such as groins, jetties, and ports. Beach scour can \nbe caused by seawall construction and loss of vegetation on the shoreline affects erosion rates. \nSediment traps (such as dredged navigational channels) and alteration to wave processes \ncaused by jetties and ports also play a role. Urbanization of the coast has exacerbated coastal \nerosion.   \n5.  Coastal erosion is responsible for loss of land, houses, infrastructure, and business \nopportunities;  and  poses  a  high  risk  to  human  well-being,  economic  development,  and \necological integrity. Every year, 400 hectares of land, 75,000 hectares of crop areas, and \n34,000 residential  houses  and/or  industrial  establishments  are  lost  or  damaged  by  coastal \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the Sustainable Coastal Protection and Management \nProject. Manila.  \n2  These three states were selected after consulting the states and central government, and considering coastal \nerosion and instability status in these states.  ", "2 \nerosion. The impact will be much more extensive and widespread in the coming years, as the \ncoastline is increasingly subject to a wide range of economic developments, many of which \ncreate conflicts and pressures on the already disturbed natural coastal environments. The rural \npoor coastal communities are the most vulnerable to the impacts of erosion and poor coastal \nmanagement.  Many  of  India\u2019s  rapidly  growing  urban  areas  are  also  vulnerable  to  coastal \nerosion; Mumbai, for example, incurs a cost of about $2.5 million per km on capital works alone \nto protect some of its prime waterfront property. \n6.   The coastal protection strategy in India aims at protecting the land and overall economic \ngrowth. Protecting the beach and the environment are relatively new concepts.  The most \nfrequently applied methods for coastal protection have been through the use of hard structures, \nsuch as seawalls or groins. Long-term plans to manage coastal erosion are available. However, \nresource constraints result in the measures being undertaken to target the more vulnerable \nsections of the coasts and as local emergency measures. Such interventions provide mostly \nland protection.  Seawalls and groins continue to be preferred measures though they do not \nnecessarily address the root cause of the problem.  As the pressure on the coastal zone keeps \nexpanding because of human-induced activities as well as relative sea level rise, there is an \nurgent need to find sustainable solutions for coastal protection.  \n \n7.  Development opportunities. Continuing coastal erosion worldwide is leading to the \ndevelopment and installation of innovative techniques for effective and unobtrusive shoreline \nand  near  shore  control.  There  are  increasing  examples  of  replacement  or  modification  of \ntraditional  hard  rock  protection  with  softer  options  such  as  beach  nourishments,  dune \nmanagement, or artificial reefs. The investment program is designed to facilitate the transition to \nsofter solutions, with a focus on environmentally appropriate and sustainable solutions.  \n \n8.  The benefits of coastal projection to coastal economies are enormous. Interventions to \nprevent coastal erosion and protect beaches and adjoining land will benefit port operators and \nusers, fisherfolk, tourism operators, beach users, farmers, and other property owners and local \ncommunities  living  near  to  or  depending  on  the  coast.  In  addition,  the  introduction  and \ndevelopment of new technologies have lower environmental and social impacts than rock walls, \nwhich are the traditional solution to coastal erosion problems in India. When solutions include \nthe construction of artificial reefs, there are benefits for beaches, land and property behind \nbeaches, tourism, and artisanal fisheries since reefs provide a beneficial habitat for fish and \nother marine species. The introduction of these new technologies for coastal protection leads to \nsolutions  that  not  only  protect  the  coastline  from  erosion  but  enhance  income-generating \nopportunities for communities living near the affected areas. \n9.  Strategic context. A key theme of the government\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan, 2007\u20132012 is \nthe integration of environmental concerns into policy, planning, and development activities. The \nplan also underscores the need to address the impacts of sea level rise, particularly for coastal \nagriculture, as well as the management of seawater ingress into coastal areas. Considering the \ngovernment\u2019s development priorities, the country partnership strategy of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for India, 2009\u20132012 emphasizes sustainable measures for coastal protection with \na focus on the enhanced capacity of state authorities to design, implement, monitor, and finance \ncoastal protection and management measures.3 \n10.  Institutional  environment.  The  mandate  for  coastal  erosion  mitigation  is  typically \nentrusted to the state level coastal division, which is part of a larger state department with a \nmuch broader and largely technical mandate. The technical and human-resource capacity of the \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n ", "3 \ncoastal  divisions  is  limited,  with  minimal  experience  in  modern  and  sustainable  coastal \nprotection and management measures. Integrated management and the use of environmentally \nand socially acceptable solutions for coastal protection require effective local level community \nparticipation. The processes for these solutions are presently limited and new methodologies \nwill have to be developed to meet these requirements. Maintenance is a key issue; a high level \nof local support for maintenance is required in some areas, such as beach stabilization work. \nDevelopment  of  protection  works  could  open  up  opportunities  for  communities  and  other \nstakeholders, with some initial support, to help realize potential financial benefits.  \n11.  Investment  plan.  The  three  states  have  envisaged  an  investment  plan  of  about \n$700 million for coastal protection and management over the medium term. An adjustment to \nthe long list based on prioritization of subprojects has been carried out for financing under the \ninvestment program. All subprojects to be included under the investment program will have to \nmeet the selection criteria: (i) erosion status; (ii) technical, institutional, and economic feasibility; \n(iii)  compliance  with  safeguards  requirements;  (iv)  endorsement  by  stakeholders,  including \nagreements to support the project; and (v) state priority. \n12.  Road  map.  A road map (a sector strategy), comprising the policy and institutional \nactions and an investment program, has been prepared to support the states to move toward \nintegrated and sustainable coastal protection and management. The objective of the road map \nis to reduce coastal erosion and instability in the states. The road map envisages actions to \nprotect and manage the shorelines of the three states, meeting the needs of communities and \nother stakeholders, while maintaining the environmental integrity of the shorelines. \n13.  Policy framework. The 1991 CRZ notification; Environment Protection, Act 1986; a \nnumber  of  other  policies,  legislations  and  notifications;  and  the  state  level  shoreline \nmanagement  plans  (SMPs)  provide  an  ample  policy  framework  for  implementation  of  the \ninvestment program. The government is considering further regulatory improvement because of \nthe new challenges that are likely to arise from climate change-induced sea level rise and the \ngrowing  pressures  of  population  on  coastal  resources  and  biodiversity.  To  support \nimplementation of the investment program, the states have identified some policy improvements \nat state level as part of the agreed sector road map. These include preparation of state SMPs, \nopening  the  way  for  increased  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  in  coastal  protection, \nestablishment of processes and procedures for approvals of coastal infrastructure plans and \ndesigns, and a sustainable operation and maintenance program for coastal protection. \n \n14.  Lessons identified. Lessons from coastal interventions in India and other countries \nhave been examined and incorporated in the design of the investment program. Worldwide \nexperience shows that traditional methods of shoreline protection using hard structures cannot \nbe supported as long-term strategies. Key lessons include (i) using environmentally and socially \nappropriate  solutions;  (ii)  better  planned  and  designed  coastal  infrastructure;  (iii) involving \nregional  governments  and  local  communities  in  planning,  design,  and  implementation; \n(iv) devising  innovative  community  support  program  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  coastal \nprojects; (v) giving importance to flood-prone agricultural land; (vi) assessing the intangible \nbenefits and their overall economic efficiency in terms of least-cost options; and (vii) retaining \ntrained and experienced staff in the target institutions and institutional development.   \n15.  Multitranche financing facility. The MFF modality is the most suitable lending modality \nfor  effective  implementation  of  the  investment  program,  which  requires  9  years.  All  the \nsubprojects,  selected  or  long-listed,  are  similar  in  nature  in  terms  of  designs  for  coastal \nprotection solutions, and in implementation arrangements. The MFF modality will be more \neffective  than  the  regular  loan  modality  in  meeting  client  needs,  while  facilitating  stronger \n ", "4 \npartnership,  and  in  implementation  performance.  The  MFF  provides  the  opportunity  and \nincentives for high implementation quality since future tranches are subject to the performance \nof the ongoing tranche, and sufficient readiness for implementation. It will foster (i) the progress \nof the agreed incremental institutional actions; (ii) the implementation with assessment and \nincorporation of lessons learned during the previous tranches; and (iii) sound capacities of the \nstate executing agencies (SEAs) to proceed with necessary reforms, which were prepared \nduring the project preparation process.  \n \n16.  Development  coordination. There has been limited external assistance for coastal \nprotection and management in India. Nearly all investment funding has been from the states, \ncentral government, and the private sector. The lack of external assistance has resulted in a \nlack of exposure to new ideas and practices. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the \nDepartment  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom  are  currently  working  in \npartnership with ADB in coastal protection and management initiatives in India.4 The World Bank \nrecently approved the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project. The World Bank and ADB \nworked closely to harmonize interventions for coastal protection in India. The focus of the World \nBank\u2019s project is on coastal zone management, mapping, and planning; and piloting integrated \ncoastal zone management in the states of Gujarat, Orissa, and West Bengal. The focus of the \nproposed  ADB-supported  investment  program  is  on  designing  coastal  erosion  protection \ninfrastructure in the states of Goa, Karnataka, and Maharashtra.   \n17.  Private sector. The shoreline of the states holds major opportunities for private sector \ndevelopment and PPP. Investors have shown significant interest in the shoreline and beach \nareas,  and  many  investments  are  already  profiting  from  shore  and  coastal  areas.  The \ninvestment  program  will  bridge  the  gap  between  coastal  development  requirements  and \nopportunities and the identification of effective areas for partnership, and where appropriate, \npromote private sector involvement. The private sector role could include (i) contribution from \nbeneficiaries for the maintenance of erosion protection; (ii) commercial sponsorship of dune \nmanagement and other natural protection; and (iii) direct investment opportunities for the private \nsector  and  PPP  in  tourism,  marinas,  jetties,  harbors,  dredging,  water  treatment,  land \nreclamation, regeneration, and other areas. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n18.  The impact of the investment program will be improved income and reduced poverty of \nthe coastal communities in the subproject areas of the coastal states of Goa, Karnataka, and \nMaharashtra.  The  outcome  of  the  investment  program  will  be  protected  and  managed \nshorelines  in  the  three  states,  meeting  the  needs  of  stakeholders  and  protecting  the \nenvironment. The key performance target is protecting and managing 150 km of coastline with \ncommunity and private sector participation. The project 1 of investment program would meet the \nrequirements of 10 km of the coast.   \n                                                 \n4 ADB and the GEF are working to develop a project proposal to address climate-resilient sustainable coastal \ninfrastructure protection and management in India. The GEF project will complement the investment program \nthrough systemic support activities designed to support sustainable shoreline planning and management of the \nentire  coastline  of  the  three  states,  with  site-specific  investments  in  coastal  protection  measures.  Capacity \ndevelopment for sustainable coastal protection and management supported by the Department for International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom is included in 2009.

The  investment  program  outcome  will  be  achieved  through  the  following  outputs: \n(i) developed sustainable plans and management for shorelines, (ii) reduced coastal erosion \nand instability, and (iii) enhanced capacity for shoreline planning and development.  \n1.  Output 1: Sustainable Plans and Management for Shorelines Developed \n20.  Output 1 includes (i) participatory SMPs; (ii) functional coastal management information \nsystems; and (iii) management, supervision, and planning of subprojects. \n21.  Participatory shoreline management plans. SMPs will be prepared to meet long-\nterm shoreline management needs. Participatory and integrated SMPs, with the participation of \nwomen, will be produced for the coastlines of the three states. Shoreline plans will address key \nissues of the coastal processes, shoreline land use, and present proposals for the long-term \nsustainable management and protection of the shoreline. The plans will also identify potential \neconomic development opportunities in coastal areas. \n22.  Coastal  management  information  systems.  Coastal  management  information \nsystems will be developed and established within each SEA, with linkages to central agencies. \nThe  databases  will  source  information  from  national  and  state  level  institutions  and  other \nspecialized agencies, including the Ministry of Environment and Forests. These will establish \neffective mechanisms for sharing information with state and district level coastal agencies and \nstakeholders. Maintenance of the management information system will be a key responsibility of \nthe coastal information management units (CIMUs) to be established within each SEA.  \n23.  Management  and  planning  of  subprojects.  The  investment  program  will  support \nmanagement and supervision of subproject implementation, and preparation of detailed design \nof subprojects for future tranches. Planning and design of projects for implementation will be \nselected  based  on  the  outputs  of  the  shoreline  management  planning  process.  Selected \nprojects will be formulated and submitted for preliminary selection and assessment. Feasibility \nstudies, including numerical modeling as required, will be carried out for all projects to assess \ntheir technical and economic viability as well as their social and environmental impacts.  \n  2.  Output 2: Coastal Erosion and Instability Managed and Reduced \n24.  Output 2 comprises (i) reducing coastal erosion and instability using environmentally and \nsocially appropriate solutions, and (ii) community and private sector engagement in coastal \nerosion and instability reduction.    \n25.  Reducing coastal erosion, salinity and instability. Coastal erosion, salinity and \ninstability will be reduced through economically viable protection works, using environmentally \nand socially appropriate solutions. Key areas of other coastal protection interventions include (i) \nnavigation  inlets  and  training  of  river  and  drain  mouths;  (ii)  natural  protection through  the \ndevelopment and planting of dunes, and planting of mangrove or other trees for protection or \nshelter; and (iii) coastal management, including water quality, dredging, and reclamation.  \n26.   Community and private sector engagement. The key components will be (i) training \nprovided to local communities in shoreline management and income-generating activities, and \n(ii) new initiatives toward income generation of local communities. The states will take steps \ntoward encouraging private sector investments in coastal protection and management, including \nputting  in  place  enabling  policies  and  guidelines  for  private  sector  participation  in  coastal \nprotection and management as feasible.  \n ", "6 \n  3.  Output 3: Enhanced Capacity for Shoreline Planning and Development \n27.  Output  3  includes  (i)  enhanced  capacity  within  districts  and  states  to  design  and \nimplement projects; (ii) enhanced capacity of local experts and agencies, and government \ninstitutes; (iii) improved capacity of communities and stakeholders to manage and maintain \nbeaches; and (iv) mandated SEAs to coordinate coastal infrastructure projects. Such capacity \nenhancement is crucial to realize the policy and institutional actions of the investment program \nroad map.  \n28.  Enhanced capacity within districts and states. Capacity at district and state levels will \nbe enhanced to prepare and implement participatory SMPs. CIMUs will be established and \nshoreline management plans will be prepared and updated at 5 yearly intervals. SMPs will form \nthe basis of long-term shoreline protection and management.  \n29.  Enhanced capacity of local experts and agencies and government institutes.  The \ncapacity of local experts and agencies, local bodies, and stakeholders will be enhanced to \nprovide specialist support for planning, modeling, design, checking, and review for coastal \nprotection and management.  \n30.  Improved capacity of communities and stakeholders. The mandates and capacities \nof  communities  and  stakeholders  will  be  improved  to  manage  and  maintain  the  beaches.  \nLocally based community stakeholders and beneficiaries will support project coordination and \nmonitoring during implementation, and management and maintenance of the beaches.  \n31.  Mandated  state  executing  agencies.  The  states  will  take  all  necessary  steps  to \nempower the SEAs to coordinate all coastal management programs. Towards this, the capacity \nof the SEAs will be enhanced. Establishment of a CIMU within the SEAs will support the \ncoordination of the management information system.  \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n32.  The project investment cost is estimated at $404.6 million including taxes and duties of \n$35.5 million to be financed by the government.

Implementation Arrangements \n34.  Each state will have a different SEA with responsibility for overall project management \nand implementation: Goa Water Resources Department, Karnataka Public Works, Ports and \nInland Water Transport Department, and Maharashtra Maritime Board. The government of each \nstate will establish a program steering committee, to be chaired by the SEA departmental \nsecretary,  to  provide  broad  project  oversight;  policy  guidance;  facilitate  interdepartmental \ncoordination;  and  help  institutionalize  effective  mechanisms  to  plan,  improve,  and  manage \ncoastal management initiatives. A program management unit (PMU), headed by a full-time \nproject  director,  will  be  established  in  each  state.  The  implementation  arrangements  are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the facility administration manual (FAM).5  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  September 2010\u2013December 2019 \nEstimated project completion date   31 December 2019 \nProject management \n(i)  Oversight body  Program steering committee of each state \n(ii)  Executing agency  Goa Water Resources Department, Karnataka Public Works, Ports \nand Inland Water Transport Department, and Maharashtra Maritime \nBoard.  \n(iii) Key implementing agencies  As above \n(iv) Project implementation unit  A program management unit, headed by a full-time project director, \nwill be established in each state. \n                                                 \n5  Facility Administration Manual (Chapter II, Implementation Arrangements; and Chapter III Project Management \nArrangements). \n ", "8 \n \nAspects  Arrangements \nProcurement  All goods and services to be financed under the multitranche \nfinancing facility will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \nConsulting services  All consulting services to be financed under the multitranche \nfinancing facility will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time \nto time). \nRetroactive financing and/or  Under each tranche, ADB may, subject to its policies and \nadvance contracting  procedures, allow on request (i) advance contracting of civil works, \nequipment and materials, and consulting services; and \n(ii) retroactive financing of eligible expenditures up to 20% of the \nproposed individual loan, incurred prior to loan effectiveness but not \nearlier than 12 months before the date of signing of the related legal \nagreement.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n35.  Economic and financial analyses were conducted for the two subprojects under project 1 \nand one subproject that is likely to be included in project 2 of the investment program. The \nbenefits of the subprojects are principally the prevented losses that would occur without the \nproject. The investment and ongoing maintenance costs of the subprojects are weighed against \nthese  benefits.  The  main  direct  financial  and  economic  impacts  of  the  project  will  be  the \nprotection of land, buildings, and infrastructure from future damage caused by coastal erosion \nand monsoon storms. The protected land will also increase the incomes and livelihoods of \nurban and rural households and businesses located on the coastlines. Tourism, rural farm and \nfishing households, ports and factories and their owners, operators, and workers will benefit \nfrom the subprojects.  Removing the erosion risk will help encourage future investment in the \ncoastal zone. The results of the economic analysis show that the subprojects have economic \ninternal rates of return in the range of 15.2%\u201318.9%.  Economic risks to the viability of these \nsubprojects are low, the major risk being large cost overruns.   \nB.  Governance \n36.  The  financial  management  system  of  the  SEAs  was  assessed  to  ensure  that  the \nfinancial management capacity of the SEAs is adequate to implement the investment program. \nIt has incorporated measures to ensure good governance, accountability, and transparency by \nsetting  out  clear  input  and  output  targets  in  their  implementation  plans.  The  design  and \nimplementation  arrangements  provide  for  mitigating  corruption  risks.  Risks  associated  with \nproject management, including procurement and disbursement, will be mitigated by (i) engaging \ninternational and national consultants to advise and assist in the procurement of goods and \nservices; (ii) introducing a dual signing system in which the civil works contractor awarded the \ncontract will also sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; (iii) periodic inspection by \nthe  PMU  of  the  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  and \n ", "9 \n(iv) setting up SEA websites to foster transparency, timely award of contracts, and uploading \ndetails on project activities and implementation. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) was explained to and discussed with the government and SEAs. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n37.  Although the primary focus of the investment program is on addressing coastal erosion \nand coastal management, a significant number of the poor are likely to be beneficiaries of the \nsubprojects because of protection from losses and damages to their land and houses, and \nrestoration of their livelihood and incomes. The investment program will promote community \nparticipation  and  income-generating  opportunities,  including  some  gender  benefits.  These \ninitiatives will enhance the livelihood of the people directly affected by shoreline erosion and \npromote sustainable social development. Coastal protection and management programs will \ncreate a number of economic opportunities, some of which would have direct and indirect \nbenefits to women. \nD.  Safeguards \n38.  For each of the two subprojects included in project 1 and one subproject that is likely to \nbe included project 2, an environmental impact assessment was carried out, along with an \nenvironmental  management  plan  and  the  summary  environmental  impact  assessment.  An \nenvironment assessment and review framework has also been prepared that would apply to \nsubprojects in all tranches under the MFF. Although project 1 has been classified environmental \ncategory  A,  the  interventions  in  many  cases  will  improve  the  natural  environment  of  the \nshoreline by stabilizing and even restoring the natural beaches. Although serious negative \nenvironmental impacts are not expected, given the complexity of coastal processes and the new \ntechnologies being employed, the extra level of diligence was needed. Potential adverse effects \nduring  the  construction  phase  can  be  mitigated  and  significant  residual  effects  are  not \nanticipated. Potential adverse effects of proposed structures were considered during the design \nstage and measures were included to minimize them. The environmental management plan will \naddress possible effects during the construction and operation phases. Public consultation and \ndisclosure was completed in each subproject area.  \n \n39.  The interventions of the subprojects  will be carried out offshore or on the shoreline. \nThere are no settlements in these areas and, as a result, none of the subprojects will require \nany  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  of  people.  Project  1  is  category  C  for  involuntary \nresettlement. A resettlement framework has been prepared in case any resettlement need arise \nin any subsequent tranches.  In the subproject areas, there are no indigenous peoples or ethnic \nminority  groups.  People  who  would  benefit  from  controlling  sea  erosion  have  only  a  few \nunderdeveloped    communities  that  have  largely  been  fully  integrated  with  the  mainstream \npopulation.  The  social,  economic,  linguistic,  and  cultural  characteristics  of  the  various \ncommunities residing in the subproject areas are mostly identical. Project 1 is category C for \nindigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples planning framework has been prepared in case any \nindigenous people are found in any subsequent tranches.  \n  \n  \n ", "10 \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n40.  The investment program involves some risks, which are manageable and will be largely \nmitigated during implementation. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh \nthe costs, given the likelihood of the risks occurring.  \n41.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.6 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nComplexity of coastal processes  Provision has been made for the international panel of experts to \nreview the design and implementation of subproject to ensure \nthe soundness of technical designs and feasibility assessments. \nPressure to develop inappropriate  The investment program will support only socially and \nsolutions  environmentally acceptable coastal protection solutions. \nImplementation delays because the  The program activities have been carefully scheduled to avoid \nmajor interventions can be implemented  lengthy delays from extreme weather events. \nin non-monsoon seasons only \nSustainability of the interventions  The investment program incorporated institutional changes \nrequired for the sustainability of the interventions, including \ndeveloping a self-sustaining and well-resourced shoreline \nmanagement.  \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n42.  The  government  and  the  SEAs  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  \ninvestment program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the FAM and loan documents. The government and \nSEAs have given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in the FFA. Specific \ncovenants agreed by the government and SEAs with respect to individual tranches under the \nMFF are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement for the respective tranches. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n43.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount  not  exceeding  $250,000,000  to  India  for  the  Sustainable  Coastal  Protection  and \nManagement Investment Program from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n7 September 2010 \n                                                 \n6  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (web linked document no. 12) \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \n \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and/or  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions and Risks \nSummary  Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms \nImpact       \nAssumptions \nImproved income and  5 years after completion of   Statistics on state GDP \nStable socio- political \nreduced poverty  of the  investment program (2024):  and tourists and tourism-\nenvironment \ncoastal communities in   Higher per capita income for   related economic activities   \nthe subproject areas of   coastal communities in the   Human Development  States continue to support \nthree coastal states  subproject areas  Index and Below   coastal protection \n       \nContribution from tourism to state  Poverty Level for  Climate change related \nGDP increased   intervention districts  environmental impacts are \n   \nPoverty incidence in coastal  District and panchayat  within predicted level \ncommunities reduced   reports \nRisk \n   Baseline data and BME \nComplexity of coastal \nreports \nprocess \n \nShifting population along \ncoastlines may impact \npoverty reduction analyses \nOutcome       \nProtected and managed  At the end of the investment  CIMU data  Assumption \nshorelines in the three  program (2019):    Coastal protection and \nSpace Application Centre \nstates  meeting the    management projects are \nAbout 150 km of coastline in the  satellite imageries \nneeds of stakeholders  implemented using highest \nstates protected and managed   \nand the environment  Statistics from District  technical standards \nusing soft technologies as \nrequireda  Industry Centers, Trade   Risks \n  Association of small and \n \nCommunity and private sector  Implementation delays \nmedium enterprises \nparticipate in coastal protection   \n  Emergency measures due \nand management \nPanchayat and rural  to natural calamities  \n \ndevelopment department   \nNumber of businesses at  statistics  Role of extraneous factors \nintervention beaches increased by    that impact data on overall \n15%  Project progress reports  economic growth  \n  Baseline data and BME   \n10% increase in coastal shipping  reports  Organizational capacity to \nundertake   maintenance \nand fish landings at intervention \nand sustainability of \ndistricts \nsubprojects \nOutputs       \n1.
