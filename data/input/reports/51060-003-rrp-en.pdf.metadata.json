Subprogram 1 ($40 million) was approved in October 2017.2 \nSubprogram 2 is for $50 million.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\nMacroeconomic context. Real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by more than \n3. \n7% in 2017, in sharp contrast to 0.2% growth in 2016, mostly driven by mining-related and other \nmanufacturing  activities.4 Construction  returned  to  growth  following  years  of  contraction,  and \nremittance flows from Armenians working in the Russian Federation supported the growth spurt \nin wholesale and retail trade and other services.5 The growth in remittances will likely slow down \nin  2018;  and  a  pickup  in  inflation  will  hit  real  wages,  likely  affecting  demand for  services.  The \nexpansion of exports of 2017 is also unlikely to be sustained, given the weaker forecast growth \nfor copper prices in 2018. This might constrain mining investments. In 2018, real GDP growth is \nexpected to decelerate to about 3%\u20134%, more in line with Armenia\u2019s potential output growth. \n \n4. \nPotential  output  growth  in  Armenia  is  partly  limited  by  low  levels  of  investment,  which \ndeclined from about 40% of GDP before the financial crisis (much of it  fueled by the pre-2009 \ncapital-inflow and credit-induced construction boom) to less than 18% in 2017. This contraction \nin  investment  as  a  share  of  GDP  is  expected  to  end  now,  and  pro-growth  policies  by  the \ngovernment could help revive it, especially if business environment challenges and geopolitical \nrisks are addressed. However, a strong rebound is unlikely because of high costs of local currency \nfinance and constraints to the banking system\u2019s maturity transformation capacity.6 As a result of \n                                                \n1  Included in ADB. 2014. Country Partnership Strategy: Armenia, 2014\u20132018. Manila. \n2   ADB.  2017.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Programmatic \nApproach  and  Policy-Based  Loan  for  Subprogram  1  to  Armenia  for  the  Public  Efficiency  and  Financial  Markets \nProgram. Manila. \n\n3  ADB provided transaction technical assistance for Support to Public Efficiency and Financial Markets Program. \n4  Industrial output volumes were up by 12.6%, mostly because of increases in global prices of copper, the country's \nlargest export. Brandy, wine, tobacco, and textile industries also contributed to  raising the exports by 25.8% to a \nrecord high of $2.2 billion. \n\n5  The surprisingly high 2017 real GDP growth figure exceeded the estimates of most observers\u2019 forecasts of 3.0%\u2013\n3.5%  and  was  mostly  determined  by  an  unanticipated  fourth-quarter  hike  in  economic  activity.  The  unexpected \nrecovery in remittances from the Russian Federation supported 5.5% growth in retail trade turnover, and a 14.4% \nsurge in other services. \n\n6  Maturity  transformation  is  a  key  function  of  banking.  The  maturity mismatch  that  is needed  to  facilitate long-term \ninvestment projects, while serving agents\u2019 liquidity needs, is a key driver of the net interest margin in banking. The \nterm refers to the difference in the residual contractual maturity between assets and liabilities. \n\n \n\n\fthe root constraints highlighted below, pricing benchmarks for financial contracts in local currency \nare  currently  nonexistent  for  most  tenors  or  are  very  steep  when  available,  and  the  economy \nremains dollarized and vulnerable to external shocks.7 \n \nCore development problem. While financial institutions in Armenia have improved their \n5. \nrole  over  the  years  (predominantly  banking),  financial  markets  remain  nascent.  This  limits \nArmenia\u2019s  private  sector  development;  and  affects  public  finance,  fiscal  management,  and \nmacroeconomic and financial stability. This is rooted in three constraints:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nFundamental  gaps  in  public  debt  and  fiscal  risk  management  scope.  To \nensure  fiscal  stability  and  sustainability,  these  functions  need  to  become  more \ncredible,  transparent,  and  effective.  Before  the  PEFMP:  (a)  public  debt \nmanagement  lacked  effectiveness  and  strategic  underpinnings;  (b)  fiscal  risk \nmanagement was inadequate and significantly incomplete in scope, played no role \nin  the  vetting  of  new  initiatives,  lacked  basic  methodologies  of  analysis,  and \nexercised no risk management or mitigation responsibilities; and (c) private sector \nprovision of public infrastructure services lacked legal/regulatory bases and was \ndone in nontransparent and potentially fiscally adverse ways. \nKey institutional and financial infrastructure gaps that hold back efficiency \nand liquidity in Armenia\u2019s government securities and money markets. Before \nthe  PEFMP  debt  securities  issuance  practices  and  communication  were \ninadequate, at least in terms of the development of financial market benchmarks \n(price  discovery)  and  the  need  to  gradually  reduce  liquidity  premiums  in \ngovernment  debt  securities.  Lack  of  market-making  frameworks  also  impeded \nprice discovery.   \nProblems in key legal frameworks for new instruments and the protection of \ninvestors,  and  deep  deficiencies  in  corporate  transparency.  Before  the \nPEFMP, gaps in legal frameworks for new financial instruments and asset classes \nhindered  investor  interest  and  feasibility  in  the  issuance  of  new  financial \ninstruments.  Lack  of  corporate \nthe \nbroadening of investor/issuer bases in Armenia\u2019s debt and equity markets. \n\ninformation  practices  also  constrains \n\n \nNew  government\u2019s  continuity  in  financial  reforms.  It  is  crucial  to  support  the  new \n6. \nGovernment  of  Armenia\u2019s  efforts  in  promoting  reforms  that  can  produce  mutually  reinforcing \neffects along the areas of intervention of the PEFMP. Financial reform processes are medium-\nterm in nature, and the political transition that took place in March\u2013May  2018 has not affected \ncountry ownership for the PEFMP. The constitutional transition to a parliamentary system in April \n2018 did bring policy dialogue and technical assistance (TA) temporarily to a halt from late March. \nEven though a new cabinet was formed in the third week of April, political circumstances led to a \nnew government step-down and a new cabinet solution only emerged in mid-May 2018. An ADB \nmission  presented  the  PEFMP  to  the  new  government  team  at  the  end  of  May,  and  received \nformal support for its objectives and reforms, and for the policy dialogue that had been interrupted. \nPolicy dialogue resumed swiftly under a formal request for support for both subprogram 2 reforms \nand  for  those  included  in  the  post-program  engagement  framework  (PPEF).  New  elections, \nexpected to take place in the near future, are likely to consolidate Parliamentarian support for the \ngovernment solution and reform agenda.    \n\n                                                \n7  At the current Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) policy rate of 6%, risk-free rates for highly liquid instruments with a    \n5-year tenor are about 8.5% (and above 10% for a 10-year tenor). Maximum tenors offered by banks in Armenia in \nlocal currency are now below 24 months on average, at rates of about 13%. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n7. \nReform  outputs  area  1:  Public  debt  and  fiscal  risk  management  policies \nstrengthened. To ultimately enhance fiscal discipline, transparency, and credibility, this output \naims to  strengthen  the  legal framework  and  improve  the  analytical  capacity  of the  Public  Debt \nManagement  Department  (PDMD)  to  mitigate  system  risks;  introduce  more  clarity  and \ntransparency in PDMD\u2019s internal procedures, operations, and debt issuance decisions; and bring \ntransparency  to  the  government\u2019s  debt  management  objectives  over  the  medium  term.  Under \nsubprogram 2, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) continued efforts to significantly improve (i) its fiscal \npolicy  framework  to  ensure  fiscal  sustainability,  credibility,  and  transparency;  and  (ii)  its \ninstitutional and regulatory capacity to manage key fiscal risks. These efforts are crucial to ensure \nfiscal stability and the confidence of financial markets going forward, and are key complements \nto the new fiscal rule approved in December 2017 (with International Monetary Fund [IMF] TA \nsupport).8 A key pillar of the overall effort is one of strengthening MOF control and understanding \nof the wide array of operations and activities that produce fiscal risks.  \n \nUnder this output, the role of the PDMD has been expanded to include, e.g., the analysis \n8. \nand vetting of requests for guarantees. It now centralizes the analysis and reporting of all forms \nof explicit liabilities within the Medium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) process and through periodic \npublic bulletins. Parliament approved new legislative amendments (to the Laws on International \nTreaties)  to  strengthen the  role of  the  MOF in  vetting  all  external  borrowing.  For  example, the \nminister  of  finance  is  now  the  only  government  official  charged  with  signing  loan  agreements, \nregardless of modalities, and is the final decision maker on all external borrowing proposals. To \nimplement this new framework, the MOF developed and approved a manual to guide the analysis, \nnegotiation, and contracting of external borrowing. Following the new reporting requirement, the \nMOF  published  its  annual  assessment  on  Armenia\u2019s  Debt  Sustainability  in  May  2018.  This \nupgrade in public transparency is a crucial complement to the new fiscal rule, itself a key new \npillar in Armenia\u2019s fiscal governance, and will help ensure market confidence in fiscal policy.9 \n \n9. \nThe MOF also approved a formal operational risk management framework that includes \nbusiness continuity planning and implementation routines. To adequately address credit risks and \nrisks related to fiscal contingent liabilities associated with budgetary lending and guarantees, the \nMOF also established a framework to vet, monitor, and evaluate these operations. In coordination \nwith the IMF, risk-vetting and monitoring procedures were adopted to close the wide gaps that \nhad been identified and prioritized in the fiscal risk management road map.10 This policy area also \naddressed a fundamental institutional handicap related to (i) the lack of information flow routines \nfor  any  integration  of  fiscal  risk  management  and  (ii)  the  absence  of  a  full-fledged  fiscal  risks \nassessment  department  within  the  MOF.  The  MOF  has  adjusted  its  institutional  framework  to \nsignificantly  facilitate  the  integration  of  risk  monitoring  and  management  functions,  and \ninformation flows. To elevate the relevance of this new institutional function, it formed a Fiscal \nRisks Assessment Department in full integration with statistical functions. \n \n10. \nIn  close  coordination  with  several  development  partners  (but  mostly  with  the IMF),  this \noutput  helped  enhance  the  fiscal  risk  management  capacity  of  Armenia  in  public\u2013private \n\n                                                \n8  The introduction of the new fiscal rule required amendments to the Budget System Law and the Public Debt Law, \n\nbut this was not included in subprogram 2 as a policy action. \n\n9   Fiscal  transparency  is  favorable  to  emerging  economies\u2019  borrowing  costs  and  help  increase  foreign  investor\u2019s \n\ndemand for their sovereign debt, i.e. beyond issues of availability of information on debt servicing capabilities. \n\n10  A  separate  set  of  procedures  to  vet,  analyze,  manage,  and  report  risks  that  are  associated  with  public\u2013private \npartnerships (PPPs) was developed and will also be approved. These methodologies complement the general fiscal \nrisk assessment models developed by the IMF.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fpartnerships (PPPs) and ensure that the proposed new legal and institutional ecosystem for PPPs \nonly  promotes  development-relevant  and  fiscally  responsible  PPPs.  This  work  has  been \ndeveloped  by  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  and  Investments  (MEDI),  in  wide \nconsultation  with  different  line  ministries  and  in  line  with  the  PPP  Policy  Statement  approved \nearlier.  The  range  of  risks  involved  in  contracting  and  implementing  a  PPP  pipeline  merited  a \nthorough  process  of  interministerial  dialogue  (and  capacity  development)  to  build  consensus \nabout key policy trade-offs. To a large extent, this effort had to be undertaken a second time from \nJune 2018 onward, albeit very successfully. The PPP law proposal approved by the cabinet and \nsubmitted to Parliament in August 2018 meets crucial requirements in that regard.  \n \n11. \nReform  outputs  area  2:  Government\u2019s  securities  market  and  money-market \ninfrastructure improved. To develop financial markets in dram and finance public sector needs \nmore  sustainably,  this  output  aims  to  increase  trading  volumes  and  liquidity  in  government \nsecurities. This will help enable a gradual reduction in foreign currency risk exposures by public \nand  corporate  borrowers  and  lenders  in  Armenia.  These  reforms  are  key  prerequisites  for  the \ndevelopment of reliable risk-free benchmarks for the pricing of all other local currency financial \ncontracts in Armenia. This is a precondition for financial deepening in local currency in Armenia \nand sustaining de-dollarization efforts. Under subprogram 2, the MOF and the Central Bank of \nArmenia (CBA) continued to improve the underpinnings of the government securities market and \nmoney  markets\u2014crucial  cornerstones  for  the  development  of  capital  and  financial  markets.  A \ntime-bound  road  map  for  the  medium-term  development  of  capital  and  financial  markets  in \nArmenia was developed  and approved  through a  memorandum  of  understanding  between  the \nMOF and the CBA. This memorandum recognizes the crucial interdependence of actions between \nthe MOF and the CBA in this regard, and it includes the three pillars of policy action that are most \nrelevant  at  this  stage:  (i)  money-markets  and  systemic  liquidity  management,  (ii)  public  debt \nsecurities market development, and (iii) corporate debt and equity securities development. \n \n12. \nAccess to public debt issuance for retail investors was established under subprogram 1, \nenhanced by mobile technology. This was implemented under subprogram 2, and the subject of \na new public reporting requirement. A more effective primary dealers\u2019 system was approved in \nsubprogram 1, with market-making responsibilities to promote price discovery and liquidity in the \ngovernment securities market. This was implemented under subprogram 2, reviewed and subject \nof a public report to the market on possible and planned improvements, with an explicit request \nfor  feedback.  A  Regular  Treasury  Bill  Program  (RTBP),  approved  under  subprogram  1,  was \nimplemented under subprogram 2 and reviewed against whether volumes and maturities were \nconsistent  with  the  feedback  from  the  market  and  aligned  with  monetary  and  public  debt \nmanagement policies (and the need to develop money markets). The MOF also upgraded and \npublished its treasury securities annual borrowing plan, with a clear policy on bond buyback and \nswitch  operations  to  ensure  financial  markets\u2019  understanding  of  the  MOF\u2019s  debt  management \noperations. These reforms  add  predictability  to the  MOF\u2019s  debt  issuance  and  management for \ninvestors. Working with NASDAQ OMX and the CBA, the MOF developed its requirements for \nbond  switch  auctions  and  regulations  for  enabling  NASDAQ\u2019s  operationalization  of  the  new \nsystem to facilitate MOF consolidation of outstanding issues. \n \nSubprogram 2 aimed at ensuring that the MTDS (2019-2021) is effective in communicating \n13. \nthe  recognized  need  to (i)  reduce  exposure  to  currency  risks  and  (ii)  develop  a  local  currency \nsovereign  debt  market.  It  was  fundamental  that  the  MTDS  fully  reflected  the  operational \nimplications of these priorities in the debt issuance program going forward,11 including an explicit \n\n                                                \n11 The  projected  share  for  net  borrowings  in  domestic securities in  total  new  borrowings for  2019\u20132020  has  almost \ndoubled in the new MTDS. Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Armenia. http://www.minfin.am/en/page/strategy/. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fannouncement  of  options  and  possible  plans  to  address  the  Eurobond-related  redemption \nchallenge  of  2020.  The  approval  of  the  new  MTDS  introduced  this  public  debt  management \ndialogue to market participants, and now also articulates the critical risk trade-offs going forward. \nTogether  with  the  first  publication  of  the  public  debt  sustainability  assessment  report,  these \nimprovements are crucial breakthroughs in public debt management transparency in Armenia. A \nworking group has also strengthened the much-needed analytical cooperation between the CBA \nand  PDMD.  A  joint  internal  paper  (on  potential  exchange  rate  impacts  of  accelerated  local-\ncurrency debt issuance and mitigation options) was produced as a result. \n \n14. \nTo develop Armenian integration with international financial markets and mainstream the \nuse of the Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA) across money markets in Armenia, the \nCBA became a member of the International Capital Market Association (ICMA)12 and approved \nthe introduction of the GMRA in 2018. Approved was also the implementation of a plan to, inter \nalia: (i) mainstream the use of GMRA by upgrading CBA\u2019s own systems in all of its open-market \noperations and standing facilities from 2018 onwards; (ii) undertake a regulatory review to remove \nregulatory biases against GMRA adoption and publicly inform supervisees of the gradual removal \nof  such  regulatory  biases.  This  market  communication  approach  will  enable  a  nondisruptive \ntransition in market participants\u2019 information technology and liquidity management systems. ADB \nTA efforts in this reform area complement the assistance of the European Bank for Reconstruction \nand Development. \n \n15. \nUnder  subprogram  1,  a  steering  committee  was  formed  to  implement  a  Tri-party  Repo \nProject. Under subprogram 2 and with ADB TA support, this brought the MOF, the CBA, and the \nCentral Depository of Armenia (and NASDAQ OMX) together to study  system and institutional \noptions, and their financial feasibility. A request for proposals was sent to potential international \nvendors, selection was finalized, and a financial feasibility analysis was presented to the steering \ncommittee. A full economic cost\u2013benefit analysis was undertaken to assess short-listed systems. \nA survey was also launched to market participants to reassess the potential for this investment\u2019s \ncost recovery and its drivers. A final decision at the second steering committee meeting reflected \na consensus that this investment is premature and determined options for when (i) increases in \nbanks\u2019  liquidity  management  activity  and  (ii)  improvements  in  the  CBA\u2019s  systemic  liquidity \nmanagement can produce a higher economic feasibility for it. The MOF also reviewed the source \nand analysis of its cash flows to identify ways to improve its forecast projections. It reflected and \napproved these in a roadmap to (i) develop a new cash management framework using Treasury \nbills, buybacks, and switches; and (ii) better coordinated with CBA\u2019s own liquidity management. \nThis will remove one of the constraints to the CBA\u2019s systemic liquidity management functions. \n \n16. \nReform  outputs  area  3:  Base  of  instruments  and  investors  broadened,  and \ncorporate  transparency  enhanced.  To  ultimately  increase  resource  mobilization  for  private \ninvestments,  this  output  aims  to  strengthen  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  new \ninstruments  and  corporate  transparency  in  Armenia.  This  aims  to  encourage  more  active \ninvestors  and  issuers  to participate  in  Armenia\u2019s  capital markets.  In  a  sign  of strong economic \npolicy  commitment  to  the  broad  financial  reform  agenda,  the  new  government  confirmed  the \nimplementation  of \nfor  pension  contributions  and \ninvestments,13 and actually increased the fiscal-sharing element of it to avoid informality in labor \ncontracts. The new government is also preparing significant amendments to Armenia\u2019s insolvency \n                                                \n12 ICMA membership enables legal opinions on GMRA enforceability in Armenia to be published by ICMA, and  will \n\nthe  mandatory  capitalization  system \n\nfacilitate cross-border repo transactions between Armenian companies and ICMA members. \n\n13 The funded pension system introduced in 2014 allowed involving internationally reputed pension fund managers into \nthe financial markets of Armenia. As the result of funded contributions, the mandatory pension funds include assets \nof more than AMD105 billion as of end 2017. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fframework. Cabinet is deciding on legal proposals to improve bankruptcy processes and protect \ncreditors\u2019  rights,  e.g.,  by  establishing  specialized  courts  for  insolvency  procedures,  ensuring \nalignment in court treatment of insolvency cases with civil cases, and ensuring the participation \nof the Ministry of Justice and the judge of an insolvency case (not just the insolvency officer) in \nthe Supervisory Body. \n \n17. \nParliament  approved  a  new  Law  on  Residential  Mortgage  Lending,  together  with \nAmendments to the Covered Mortgage Bonds Law. With the latter, the regulation of covered bond \nissuance  was  brought  in  line  with  best  practices.  One  of  the  major  features  introduced  by  the \nreform is the regulation of centralized covered bond issuance. There was a great uncertainty in \ncases of insolvency of the participant issuer, as the relations between the central issuer and the \nparticipant issuer could not be regulated simply by a contract. The reformed law addresses this \nissue and makes sure centralized issuance of covered bonds is safe, the assets in the pool are \nring-fenced against insolvency, and all the procedures are certain. The reforms also updated the \nlist of eligible assets for the pool, making the law a stronger basis for financial activities.14 Banks \nin Armenia have been trying to structure these investment vehicles and adding new asset classes, \nand this strengthening of legal frameworks is now expected to catapult these efforts forward. To \nclarify  the  nature  and  attributes  of  new  investment  instruments  and  special  purpose  vehicles \n(enabling  synthetic  securitization  and  the  issuance of securities  before  a  loan-book  purchase), \nand  to  strengthen  the  legal  basis  for  securitization,  Parliament  approved  the  proposed \namendments to the Law on Asset Securitization and Asset-Backed Securities.15 \n \n18. \nAs  illustrated  above,  there  has  been  no  slowdown  in  financial  reform  efforts  by  the \nGovernment  in  Armenia  in  2018.  By  August  2018,  the  cabinet  had  approved  proposals  to \nintroduce modern elements of corporate law in Armenia, such as (i) the concept of a shareholder\u2019s \nagreement (e.g., as an amendment to the Joint Stock Companies Law); and (ii) the protection of \nminority investors\u2019 rights (as amendments to the Joint Stock Company Law, the Law on Limited \nLiability  Companies,  and  the  Law  on  Securities  Market).  To  establish  stronger  corporate \ntransparency practices in Armenia and promote more availability of reliable financial information \non  domestic  companies,  the  cabinet  also  approved  a  number  of  reforms  that  are  expected  to \nattract  more  investors  and  channel  more  savings  through  financial  markets  to  companies that \nneed capital to grow and generate jobs. Under subprogram 2,  a package of audit reforms was \nproposed  to  Parliament  that  included  the  establishment  of  a  public  oversight  board.  These \nreforms,  when  adopted  in  Parliament  (and  supported  by  the  PPEF),  will  pave  the  way  to  a \nsystemic shift in the financial information and transparency industry in Armenia. \n \nLessons. As with subprogram 1, subprogram 2 incorporates important lessons from policy \n19. \ndialogue experience in finance sector and public sector reform programs in other countries, as \nwell as from earlier ADB policy-based lending engagement in Armenia. International lessons for \nthe successful development of local currency financial markets, public management, fiscal risk \nmanagement, etc., were incorporated across all reform efforts to varying degrees, but the policy \ndialogue often emphasized the need to address and target more context-specific solutions that \nonly TA and reform analysis could uncover. This was done in full use of the advantages of ADB\u2019s \nprogrammatic  assistance  (relative  to  other  modalities).  In  this  sense,  the  experience  of \nsubprogram 2 has also confirmed the advantages of the programmatic modality to the nature of \n\n                                                \n14 The law clearly defines the assets that can be used as substitutes, and introduces a cap on the percentage of such \n\nassets in the pool. \n\n15 For example, prior to these amendments, the special purpose vehicles had the legal status of foundations (not of \ninvestment funds), which hindered securitization efforts. Amendments also now enable synthetic securitizations (and \nnot only via true-sale). Other crucial constraints (e.g. lack of clarity on reserve requirements for the parties\u2019 accounts \nreceivables) were also removed, and securitization is now a viable option in Armenia. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fthis  multi-period,  multi-speed  reform  agenda  in Armenia.  Setting  realistic  policy  actions is  also \ncritical  to  ensure  that  the  reform  program  can  be  carried  out  effectively  and  implementing \nagencies\u2019  technical  staffs  remain  fully  connected  to  the  process.  Policy  reforms  must  be \naccompanied by significant government ownership, but this often requires a more pragmatic and \nsequenced  approach from  development  partners  (often  emphasizing  issues  of form  on  how  to \napproach reform challenges). As often observed in other \u201cpost-transition\u201d contexts, catalyzing the \nlevels of inter-agency institutional collaboration that are crucial in financial markets development \nis a challenge in Armenia (at working levels). Promoting analytical cooperation between agencies \noften requires setting formal requirements for it, to support policy dialogue continuity and frame \nthe progress that is needed in more effective ways. \n \n20. \nReform Implementation Challenges and Adjustments to Subprogram 2. Subprogram \n2 reforms and policy dialogue progressed broadly as expected in terms of indicative targets set \nin October 2017 at subprogram 1 approval. In some areas, the effectiveness of the policy dialogue \nresulted in more concrete reform achievements and new reform efforts (policy actions 1, 7, 15, \nand 23). Some key legal reforms also progressed faster than originally expected (policy actions \n3 and 22). The timing of policy action 25 was also corrected, to be in line with policy action 24. \nAdjustments  were  required  in  policy  actions  11  and  17\u201319  to  achieve  the  underlying  policy \nobjectives more effectively and reflect concrete reform realities. A supplementary linked document \ndiscusses  these  reform  adjustments  in  detail. 16 All  Subprogram  2  policy  actions  have  been \nachieved  before  late-September  2018.  All  Subprogram  1  policy  actions  have  been  sustained \nwithout any rollback of the reform measures. \n \n21. \nframework.  The  policy  dialogue  process  under \nsubprogram 2 was successful in clarifying that several follow-up reform steps will be crucial and \ncould benefit from further ADB support. The ADB team  and the authorities agreed on  a PPEF \nthrough which both can lock-in a working-level commitment to jointly prepare the next phase of \nassociated  reforms,  i.e.,  reforms  that  are  a  natural  sequence  or  necessary  for  subprogram  2 \nreforms to come to full fruition  in  terms  of  impact. The  PPEF  contains a non-exhaustive list  of \ninitial activities,17 including the development of an integrated fiscal risk management framework \nin close coordination with capacity development and the new institutional setup for this function, \nPPP pipeline development (within the new legal and regulatory framework), further development \nof market-making and primary dealer frameworks (and other efforts to enhance price discovery \nand turnover liquidity), reviewing tax challenges to securities\u2019 trading and issuance, implementing \nregulatory  efforts  to  encourage  corporate  debt  issuance,  developing  the  capacity  of  the  new \ngoverning framework for accounting and auditing in Armenia, etc. \n \n22. \nCoordination  with  other  development  partners.  As  indicated  in  specific  references \nabove,  Subprogram  2  helped  coordinate  the  benefits  of  different  sources  of  TA  for  fiscal  and \nfinance  sector  reforms  in  Armenia.  Different  aspects  in  the  scope  of  the  program  have  been \nclosely  coordinated  with  the  IMF  and  the  EBRD.  Close  collaboration  with  IMF  teams  on  PPP \nreforms and on the fiscal risk management upgrading dialogue was instrumental to the related \u2013\nachievements under Subprogram 2 and are expected to continue during the PPEF. Collaboration \nwith the EBRD on money-markets development is also expected to strengthen.  Some reforms \nbenefited from earlier TA by the European Union delegation in Armenia and by the World Bank. \nThis has ensured that the proposed program reforms complement related (past and present) TA \n\nPost-program  engagement \n\n                                                \n16 Reform Implementation Challenges and Adjustments to Subprogram 2 (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\nin Appendix 2).  \n\n17 Post-Program Engagement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\finitiatives  by  other  development  partners,  and  that  each  partner\u2019s  work  is  always  considered, \nintegrated, and often actually incorporated for the first time are form-consequent policy dialogue.18 \n \nC. \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n23. \nTo  illustrate  the  potential  financial  and  economic  impacts  of  the  reforms  presented  in \nSection II.B, a full discussion is presented in a supplementary document.19 Subprogram 2 reforms \n(i) bring to fruition a number of key legal and institutional game-changers for financial markets in \nArmenia,  thus  sustaining  the  benefits  of  complementary  reform  processes  implemented  in \nsubprogram 1; and (ii) put in motion new reform processes that, for example, the proposed PPEF \nwill help consolidate. The development of the financial markets is crucial for Armenia and can: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nsupport government funding possibilities in the domestic market, thereby reducing \nits  currently  very  high  foreign  currency  exposure  and  vulnerability  to  external \nshocks; \nsupport the traction of monetary policy levers, and provide suitable instruments for \nthe authorities to deal with macroeconomic shocks and risks to financial stability \nfrom high dollarization; \ndevelop  local  capital  markets,  on  the  back  of  the  development  of  an  effective \ngovernment  securities  market,  to  enable  banks\u2019  maturity  transformation,  and \ncompanies\u2019 and households\u2019 access to local currency borrowing; and \nimprove the efficiency of capital allocation and intermediation between investors \nand  borrowers,  through  adequate  disclosure  and  legal  frameworks  to  protect \ninvestors and borrowers. \n\n \nThe proposed reforms under the PEFMP\u2014to address each of the three root constraints \n24. \npresented in para 5 above, are important in their own specific context. The Program Economic \nand Financial Impact Assessment illustrates these potential financial benefits through estimates \nof  the  specific,  partial  benefits  that  proposed  reforms  can  produce  in  each  area.20 This  due \nthis  reform  program,  complemented  by  crucial \ndiligence  and  analysis \ncontemporaneous  and  future  reform  processes,  can  indeed  contribute  to  stronger  and  more \nsustained economic growth, and less episodes of macroeconomic and financial instability. \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\nindicates \n\nthat \n\n25. \nArmenia experienced an economic growth spurt in 2017. As a result, the budget deficit in \n2017 decreased to 4.8% of GDP from 5.5% in 2016. External public debt increased to 42.5% of \nGDP from  41.1%  in 2016,  while domestic  debt rose  to 11.1% from  10.9%  in 2016. To reduce \ndebt-related  vulnerabilities,  the  government  envisages  significant  fiscal  consolidation  in  2018-\n2019. With public debt exceeding the legal limit of 50% of GDP, Armenia\u2019s fiscal rule requires a \nreduction  in  the  budget  deficit  to  2.7%  in  2018.  Over  the  medium  term,  the  budget  deficit  is \nexpected to narrow further to 2% of GDP in both 2019 and 2020. The government has requested \na regular loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to underpin subprogram 2. \nThe loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, straight line method, an \n\n                                                \n18 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Program Economic and Financial Impact Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 This analysis takes into account the program of reforms under subprogram 1, subprogram 2, and commitments made \nunder  the  PPEF.  International  reform  and  empirical  experience  have  shown  that,  taken  together,  the  reform \nprocesses in the program could be very meaningful. However, a meaningful quantification of the combined impact \non the economy from these different and partial processes is extremely difficult to make. Instead, the linked document \nattempts at highlighting the several channels of medium-term potential economic impact that recent cross-country \nempirical literature has emphasized. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fannual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The average maturity is 9.25 years, and there is \nno maturity premium payable to ADB. The loan amount reflects the government\u2019s financing needs, \nconsidering  its  development  expenditure  over  2018\u20132020  (Table  1).  The  financing  gap  is \nexpected  to  be  $146.12  million  or  1.99%  of  GDP  in  2018,  to  be  financed  partly  through \nsubprogram 2. The closing date of the loan is 31 December 2018. \n \n\nTable 1: Armenia State Budget Financing Gap for 2018\u20132020 (Projected) \nAmount \n2019 \n($ million) \n 3,083.67  \n 3,398.70  \n (315.03) \n701.92  \n 656.41  \n\nItem \n1.

The CBA, the MOF and the MEDI are the implementing \n26. \nagencies for their respective reforms (Appendix 4). The MOF was the executing agency in prior \nprogram loans, including subprogram 1. The MOF, the MEDI and the CBA had a well-established \nrecord  of  implementing  reform  programs  with  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  IMF,  and \nSubprogram 2 benefited from that. The implementation period for subprogram 2 is from November \n2017  to  December  2018. The  proceeds  of  subprogram  2  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n27. \nGovernance. Armenia\u2019s public financial management (PFM) has steadily improved over \ntime  in  budget  credibility,  comprehensiveness  and  transparency,  policy-based  budgeting  and \nexecution, and revenue administration. However, the management of fiscal risks related to public \nsector  enterprises  and  PPPs,  cash  management,  and  forecasting  ability  is  weak.  The  MOF \ncontinues  to  have  a  consistent  lead  role  in  PFM  reform  efforts,  including  the  new  Tax  Code \nimplemented in January 2018. The government\u2019s Anticorruption Council is responsible for setting \nanticorruption policies, leading investigations, and imposing remedies. \n \n28. \nPoverty and social. Subprogram 2 is expected to contribute indirectly (over the medium \nterm) to poverty reduction through improved finance sector stability, stronger resilience to external \nshocks,  and  more  sustained  economic  and  employment  growth.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009), the program is classified category C for impacts on the environment, \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\finvoluntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \nsummarized in table 2 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n\nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe country is still vulnerable to external \nshocks,  which  may  directly  affect \nfinancial  stability  and  spur  increases  in \ndollarization. Rating: Substantial \nFiscal  instability  and  foreign  currency \ndebt  servicing  concerns  can  affect  the \nstability  of  the  domestic  debt  issuance \nprogram. \nRating: Substantial \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe mitigation of external risks remains a priority of the Government of \nArmenia. Resilience will be strengthened by implementing reforms such \nas  those  in  subprogram  2,  and  by  increasing  the  depth  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s domestic debt and reducing foreign exchange borrowing. \nThe government continues to reduce the fiscal deficit. A new tax code \nintroduced  in  late  2016  is  broadening  the  tax  base  and  increasing \nrevenues.  This  can  reduce  risks  of  fiscal  instability.  The  new \ngovernment has stepped up plans to strengthen the issuance of more \ndram  debt  to  reduce  foreign  currency  risk  exposures  earlier  than \notherwise.  Reforms  under  the  program  are  expected  to  strengthen \npublic debt management. \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n29. \nwith the government.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n30. \nThe  Government  and  the  MOF  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan agreement. \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n31. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $50,000,000 to Armenia for subprogram 2 of the Public Efficiency and Financial Markets \nProgram, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n\n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n9 October 2018\n\n                                                \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nFiscal sustainability and resilience in the finance sector increased by 2020a \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\n \na.
