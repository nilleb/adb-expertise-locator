An initial environmental examination (IEE) was \nundertaken, and the summary IEE is a core appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The Project will improve connectivity and allow better access \nin  Balochistan,  and  build  the  capacity  and  systems  for \nsustainable  road  sector  development,  specifically  in  road \nmaintenance. The Project will also improve the efficiency of \nnational  highway  (NH)  25,  including  one  major  border \ncrossing, that passes through Balochistan, and forms part of \nthe  priority  road  transport  corridor,  that  links  Pakistan, \nAfghanistan, and Central Asia together. \n   \nRationale  Balochistan is the largest and least developed province in \nPakistan.  The  economic  development  potential  in  the \nprovince  is  constrained  by  its  limited  resource  base; \ninadequate  social  and  economic  infrastructure;  lack  of \nconnectivity between the poor rural population and market \nand district centers; and poor access to education and health \nfacilities,  and  social  services;  and  few  employment \nopportunities.    \n   \nThe  onset  of  peace  in  Afghanistan  and  developments  in \nPakistan  and  Central  Asia  offer  opportunities  for  regional \ncooperation.  As  one  of  the  principal  gateways  between \nPakistan and Afghanistan, Balochistan is well placed to play \nan  increasing  role  in  regional  trade  and  cooperation  if \ntransport  bottlenecks  are  removed  and  cross-border \narrangements improved.   \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  adopted  a \nprogrammatic  approach  that  sequences  interventions  in \nindividual provinces over several years. This  Project is the \nthird  intervention  using  that  approach, following the road \nprojects that were approved in 2001 and 2002 and covered \nthe provinces of Sindh and Punjab, respectively. Balochistan \nprovincial government (BPG) has taken some initiatives to \naddress provincial road sector policy issues, and established \na road management unit (RMU) at its Communications and \nWorks  Department  (CWD).  However,  major  challenges \nremain, including continued institutional changes at CWD and \nefforts to improve road maintenance and road safety. At the \nfederal level, the National Highway Authority (NHA), which is \nresponsible  for  national  highway  development  and \nmaintenance, is undergoing a policy and institutional reform \nprogram supported by ADB.  ", "ii   \nObjectives and Scope  The  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  reduce  poverty  and \nsupport pro-poor economic growth by (i) enhancing access of \nrural  populations  to  economic  opportunities  and  social \nservices  by  improving  the  provincial  road  network;  (ii) \nimproving trade facilitation and efficiency of the priority road \ntransport corridor linking Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central \nAsia together, which traverse Balochistan; and (iii) providing \nessential institutional support and capacity building at CWD.    \n   \n  The  Project  has  four  main  components:  (i)  a  provincial \ninstitutional development component (PIDC) supporting CWD \nand  districts,  (ii)  a  provincial  access  component  (PAC) \ncomprising  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  about  1,100 \nkilometers  (km)  of  provincial  roads,  (iii)  a  cross-border \ndevelopment component (CDC) supporting improved trade \nfacilitation and providing a new pilot cross-border facility, and \n(iv)  a  national  highway  component  (NHC)  comprising \nrehabilitation of 247 km of national highways. Rehabilitation \nand construction of the provincial roads will follow a sector \napproach. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $267.3 million \nequivalent. The foreign exchange cost is $162.5 million, and \nthe local currency cost is $104.8 million equivalent. \n   \n  ($ million) \nFinancing Plan  Source   Foreign   Local  Total  Percent \n   Exchange   Currency  Cost \n \nADB                   162.5             23.2  185.7  69.5 \nGovernment  0.0      81.6       81.6           30.5      \n  Total  162.5  104.8              267.3         100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of \u00a520,266,370,000 ($185.7 million equivalent) from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be provided. The loan \nwill have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, \nan interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per \nannum, a front-end fee of 0.5%, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. \nThe Borrower will make the loan proceeds available to NHA \n($85.7 million equivalent) and BPG ($100 million equivalent).  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \n   \n   ", "iii   \nExecuting Agencies  CWD Balochistan for the PIDC and the PAC, NHA for the \nCDC and the NHC. \n   \nImplementation  The  project  components  will  be  implemented  by  the \nArrangements  established project management units (PMUs) at CWD and \nNHA, respectively. Each PMU will be headed by a project \ndirector. The additional chief secretary (ACS) of BPG will chair \na steering group for the PIDC and the PAC. The Chairperson \nof NHA will chair a steering group for the CDC and the NHC.  \n   \nProcurement  All procurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines for Procurement. Advance action for procurement \nwas approved on 14 July 2003. \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will require 250 person-months of international \nand 4,509 person-months of domestic consulting services for \n(i) institutional development with capacity building under the \nPIDC, (ii) detailed design and construction supervision for the \ncivil  works  for  the  provincial  roads,  and  (iii)  construction \nsupervision of the civil works for the national highways. The \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants.  \n   \nThe  Technical  Assistance  A  TA  loan  equivalent  to  $1.0  million  (SDR  701,000)  for \nLoan   Community  Development  and  Poverty  Targeting  will  be \nprovided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The TA loan \nwill have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears; an interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5 % per annum thereafter; and such other terms \nand conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft TA Loan Agreement.    \n   \nTechnical Assistance Grant  ADB will provide a TA grant in the amount of $500,000 for \ncross-border development. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \n   ", "iv   \nProject Benefits and  The main quantifiable benefits of the Project consist of savings \nBeneficiaries  in vehicle operating costs and passenger time. The economic \ninternal rates of return (EIRR) for the selected two national \nhighways are 33.7% and 40.4%, respectively. For the six core \nprovincial  roads,  the  EIRRs  are  14.8\u201348.9%. All provincial \nroads were subjected to analysis based on multiple social and \neconomic  criteria.  The  Project  will  reduce  poverty  by  (i) \nenabling the poor to participate in economic opportunities and \nenhancing their access to social services, and (ii) creating \nadditional economic opportunities for the poor by stimulating \neconomic growth. Project beneficiaries will comprise (i) the \npoor  who  will  have  increased  access  to  economic \nopportunities and human development services because of \nimproved national highways and provincial roads; (ii) the poor \nwho live in the districts in Balochistan and were previously \nunable  to  pursue  employment  and  other  economic \nopportunities  due  to  geographic  isolation  and  long oj urney \ntimes; (iii) companies, employees, consumers and transport \noperators in Balochistan Province,  Afghanistan, and Central \nAsia  who  directly  or  indirectly  use  goods  and  services \ntransported on the project roads.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The risks to the Project are related to (i) start-up delays, (ii) \ncommitment to institutional changes at CWD, (iii) progress on \nreform at NHA, (iv) adequacy of road maintenance at federal \nand  provincial  levels  and  (v)  commitment  to  cross-border \ndevelopment. The risks will be mitigated through (i) advance \nactions  for  recruiting  consultants  and  starting  procurement \nactivities, (ii) use of already established PMUs and appointed \nproject directors, (iii) BPG\u2019s commitment to and agreement \nwith ADB on institutional development and changes, (iv) policy \nand  institutional  reform  measures  already  implemented  by \nNHA,  (v)  actions  initiated  by  NHA  to  improve  road \nmaintenance and increase its funding, (vi) capacity building at \nCWD  and  other  support  for  road  maintenance  under  the \nProject, and (vii) strong support by the federal Government \nand  advance  actions  already  under  way to improve trade \nfacilitation  including  transit  arrangements.  NHA  and  CWD \nhave satisfactorily implemented past loans in the road sector. \n   \n \n \n \n   ", " ", "   \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a (i) proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Balochistan Road Development Sector Project; and (ii) \na proposed technical assistance (TA) loan for Community Development and Poverty Targeting. \nThe report also describes a proposed TA grant for Cross-Border Development, and if the Board \napprove the proposed loan and TA loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, will approve the TA grant. The project framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Road Sector. Balochistan, which is the largest but least developed and least populated \nprovince in Pakistan, has 6.6 million people,1 or 5% of the total population. About 76% of \nBalochistan's population live in rural areas. The provincial road network2 grew from 14,682 \nkilometer (km) in 1993 to 23,451 km in 2000 (Appendix 2) reflecting  poor connectivity in the \nprovince. The largest  expansion was that of farm-to-markets roads, which increased manifold \nwith support frp, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of Japan. The length of \nthe national highways remained largely constant at 2,300 km. Balochistan has still, however, the \nlowest density of roads among  the four provinces  of Pakistan. Poor connectivity and access \ncontinue to be a major problem, which particularly affect the poor, who live mostly in the rural \nareas. The increased demand for road transport  \u2013 about 7-8% per year  \u2013 and higher traffic \nintensity combined with insufficient maintenance have caused several parts of the road network \nto deteriorate. A survey of 2,500 km of provincial roads found that gravel roads or earthen tracks \nrepresenting 90% of the network were in poor to very poor condition and  were deteriorating \nrapidly owing to increased traffic, underinvestment in transport infrastructure, and insufficient \nmaintenance.3 The national highways in Balochistan, which are administered by the National \nHighway Authority (NHA), play an important role from  the regional perspective as they carry \ntransit  traffic  between  Pakistan  and  Afghanistan  and  provide  access  to  ports4  in southern \nPakistan through national highway (NH) 25. Several sections on NH25 are, however, constrained, \ntoo narrow with respect to the traffic carried, and in poor condition; the conditions cause high \nvehicle operating cost and compromise road safety.  \n \n3.  Pakistan\u2019s  Regional  Cooperation  and  Trade  Potential.  The  onset  of  peace  in \nAfghanistan, introduction of market-oriented reforms in Pakistan, and developments in Central \nAsia have opened up opportunities for closer cooperation among these countries. Pakistan and \nits province Balochistan is geographically well placed and has the potential to play an increasing \nrole in regional cooperation, linking landlocked Afghanistan, and Central and South Asia more \nclosely. Pakistan provides the shortest route (about 300-500 km shorter than the second best \nalternative) to ports in Afghanistan and most countries in Central Asia, which are landlocked and \nremain dependent on road transport and transit arrangements with neighboring countries that \nallow the use of their port facilities.  Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the countries in Central Asia \n                                                 \n1  From 1981 to 1998, the population grew at an annual average rate of 2.68% (Balochistan 2.42%). \n2  The Balochistan provincial road network comprises 2,351 kilometers (km) of national highways (administered by the \nNational Highway Authority), 8,146 km of provincial highways, 8,659 km of secondary roads, and 3,940 km of access \nroads. \n3  PRs100.9 million was spent on road maintenance in FY2001/02. It is estimated that twice this amount is needed to \npreserve the road asset base in Balochistan. \n4  Karachi and Qasim ports. A new port being constructed in Gwadar in southwest Pakistan is expected to open during \n2005.  ", "2  \nsuffer, however, from lack of or inadequate facilities and systems5 at border crossings. Moreover, \ncross border procedures and operations are generally bureaucratic and slow, causing extensive \ndelays in moving goods, and passengers across the borders. The resulting inability to effectively \nmanage and monitor cross-border trade has spurred extensive smuggling and other unauthorized \nflow of goods, and thus distorts trade and tariff regimes in the subregion. While Pakistan's trade \nwithin the  Economic Cooperation Organization6 (ECO) accounts for only 3% of its total trade, \nAfghanistan is Pakistan\u2019s third largest trading partner within ECO after Iran and Turkey. Recent \ndata on trade showed that nearly 90% of Afghanistan\u2019s exports of $1.2 billion7 and about 46% of \nits imports were through Pakistan. A significant portion of Afghanistan\u2019s exports was reexports of \nimports from Pakistan.8 Thus, Afghanistan's trade with Pakistan was dominated by unofficial \nexports and reexports amounting to $941 million, followed by import transit trade ($221 million) \nand  import  trade  ($61  million).  With  further  progress  on  securing  peace  and  positive \ndevelopments in Afghanistan, trade between Afghanistan and Pakistan and transit traffic through \nPakistan could substantially increase.9      \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n4.  Poverty. In Pakistan the incidence of poverty increased from 30.6% in FY1999 to 32.1% \nin FY2001 leaving about 42 million people in poverty.10 Poverty is largely a rural phenomenon. \nAbout 108 million people live in rural areas (77% of the total population of 130 million). More than \n40% of the population live below the poverty line in the rural areas. The overall poverty level in \nBalochistan is reported at 39.1% (43.7% in rural areas and 29.5 % in urban areas).11 The Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper of the Government puts the overall poverty figure in Balochistan at 41-\n47%. About 50% of the rural villages in Balochistan have no or very poor road access.  ADB is \nactively engaged in policy dialogue on poverty reduction and related issues with the federal and \nprovincial governments. The poverty focus is emphasized in the country strategy program (CSP) \nof May 2002 and reinforced in its update (2004-2006), and in the poverty partnership agreement \nthat was signed in 2002 between  the  federal  Government  and  ADB. Balochistan provincial \ngovernment (BPG) is prioritizing improvement of provincial connectivity and enhanced access to \nreduce poverty. Research and international experience have shown that improved connectivity \nand road transport play an important role in reducing poverty by providing basic access to \neducation, health, and markets, and improving access to social and economic opportunities, \nincluding  labor  and  product  markets,  schools,  and  clinics.  Improved  road  connectivity  in \nBalochistan will help the poor overcome geographic isolation, and enable them to participate in \ncommunity and wider decision making and overcome social, cultural, and physical barriers.12  \n \n5.  Institutional Capacity and Constraints. The Communication and Works Department \n(CWD) in Balochistan, which is responsible for roads and buildings, is structured and functions as \na typical public works department. It's character has not changed significantly during recent \n                                                 \n5  Specifically physical infrastructure, equipment, customs, and other administrative systems. \n6  Comprises  Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan,  Iran,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyzstan,  Tajikistan,  Turkey,  Turkmenistan,  and \nUzbekistan. \n7  UNDP/World Bank. 2001.Study: Afghanistan\u2019s Trade with Neighboring Countries. Manila. Refers to official and \nunofficial trade.  \n8  This is partly because of the lower prices in Afghanistan and partly because of unofficial and informal trade routes.  \n9  Currently about 4,000 trucks pass Chamman border crossing every day. Past volume of official transit freight traffic \nthough Pakistan never exceeded 3 million tons per year. \n10 This is based on the official poverty line defined at 2,350 calories and analysis in the poverty reduction strategy \nprogram (PRSP) of the Government.  \n11 Talat Anwar and Sarfraz Qureshi. 2001.

Manila. \n   ", "3   \nyears. Planning and institutional capacity at for road maintenance at CWD is weak. In addition, \nthe  use  of  road  asset  management,  maintenance  systems  and  procedures  are  not \ninstitutionalized and integrated in the day-to-day operations at CWD. While a separate road \nmanagement unit was established in 1999 with support of ADB and the Nordic Development \nFund, the unit was essentially discontinued in 2001 due to lack of provincial support. Another \nimportant  but  more  difficult  issue  is  alignment  of  staff  resources  at  CWD.  Moreover,  as  a \nconsequence of the ongoing devolution program,13 significant challenges are confronting BPG, \nwhich sets the basis for the transforming CWD and the 26 district administrations. At the federal \nlevel, NHA is undergoing a policy and institutional reform program supported by ADB through a \nprogram loan component14 and the World Bank, which aims to transform NHA into a modern road \nmanagement agency. This program includes (i) institutional development and capacity building at \nNHA, (ii) improved road maintenance processes, (iii) support for the road maintenance fund that \nwas established in 2002, (iv) a road safety program, (iv) an axle load control program and (v) \nimproved financial management system. Although some initial delays occurred, NHA made good \nprogress during 2002 and 2003 and met the agreed upon first tranche conditions (June 2002) and \nthe second tranche conditions (July 2003), which had been agreed upon with ADB.15  \n \n6.  Road  Maintenance,  Safety,  and  Vehicle  Overloading.    During  the  last  5  years, \nspending on road maintenance in Balochistan has fluctuated between PRs47.5 million and \nPRs100.9 milliont.16 The recent expansion of the provincial road network and the increase in the \nroad asset base indicate that bigger budget allocations for maintenance are required to sustain \nthe provincial road network. This implies a shift from road network expansion to improvement and \nmaintenance of existing roads. It also suggests allocation of more funds for road maintenance \nand further involvement of the private sector to enhance capacity and efficiency. With respect to \nroad  safety,  Pakistan's  total  fatalities-to-vehicle  ratio  is  about  10  times  higher  than  that  in \ndeveloped countries.17 The situation is worst in Balochistan because of low awareness, poorly \ntrained drivers, and a large number of narrow roads. In  1999, 467 people were killed in road \naccidents. Reported road accidents reached about  346, but the actual number is likely to be \nmuch higher. Overloading of trucks is also a problem on major roads in Balochistan. While NHA \nhas initiated actions to address this growing problem, further efforts  by CWD are required  to \ncontrol the increasing damage to its road network. Appendix 3 gives the road sector analysis.  \n \n7.  Transit Arrangements. Transit trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan is governed by \nthe Afghan Transit Trade Agreement (ATTA) signed in 1965. ATTA covers two main routes \npassing via Chamman and Torkham. Transportation of Afghan cargo is allowed through railway \nservice only. Road transport across Pakistan for certain humanitarian aid shipments bound for \nAfghanistan is also allowed as an exception by the National Logistics Center. To protect domestic \nindustry and to discourage smuggling, 24 items not allowed under ATTA  have been put on the \nnegative list. Recently, however,  eight items on that list were  deleted and Pakistan has also \nallowed Port Quasim as an alternative port of entry for transit. Additional measures may include \n(i) improving the application of current procedures and working arrangements at the main cross-\nborder points, (ii) allowing private operators to carry containers by road, (iii) introducing the use of \n                                                 \n13 Under the devolution program, local governments at district level have been created.  \n14 ADB. 2001.

Due to its geographic location, Pakistan \nhas a great opportunity to increase trade by providing efficient transit and competitive access to \nports for landlocked Afghanistan if impediments to trade are relaxed and eventually removed.18 \nThe proposed Project addresses the prevailing constraints by providing TA to review and improve \ncurrent transit arrangements under ATTA and by improving transit operations at one major border \ncrossing on a pilot basis. \n \n8.  Road  Sector  Assistance  in  Afghanistan  and  Central  Asia.  The  road  network  in \nAfghanistan is in an extremely poor state following decades of war and civil unrest, and road \nsector institutions are weak or absent.  To address these shortcomings, ADB is actively involved \nin the road sector in Afghanistan. ADB is supporting TA for capacity building19 and TA to develop \na framework and legislation for cross-border transport, covering Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the \ncountries in Central Asia.20 ADB is also financing rehabilitation and reconstruction of important \nroads in Afghanistan: (i) rehabilitation of the Kandahar\u2013Spin Bolak road (105 km),21 which is the \nmain southeast highway connecting Afghanistan with Pakistan and Balochistan at Chamman \nborder crossing, and (ii) rehabilitation of the Pule Khumri\u2013Mazar Sharif\u2013Sheberghan\u2013Andhoy \nroad section (392 km) in the north of Afghanistan including the road link connecting Afghanistan \nwith  Uzbekistan  (Naibabad\u2013Hairatan  road,  55  km).  In  Central  Asia,  ADB  is  also  active  in \nsupporting subregional cooperation and removing impediments to cross-border road transport \nthrough regional TA22 and financing road rehabilitation projects in Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, \nTajikistan, and Uzbekistan.  \n \n9.  Sector  Coordination  and  Assistance.  ADB,  World  Bank  and  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC) are the principal providers of assistance to the road sector in \nPakistan (Appendix 4). ADB has approved seven loans totaling $747 million for Pakistan\u2019s road \nsector, four of which have been for umbrella projects that include components in each of the \ncountry\u2019s four provinces.23 The World Bank has mainly focused on assistance to the national road \nnetwork, specifically rehabilitation of the main domestic artery (Karachi-Lahore-Peshawar), along \nwith support for policy and institutional reform of NHA at the federal level. Following the adoption \nof a coordinated policy agenda for road sector reform at the national and provincial levels, ADB \nhas targeted (i) development of provincial road networks, (ii) rehabilitation of national highways of \nregional  significance,  and  (iii)  assistance  to  improve  efficiency  of  movement  of  goods  and \npassengers  across  borders  in  the  region.  JBIC  has  also  provided  assistance  to  provincial \nnetworks, complementing ADB assistance.  \n \n10.  Experience in Subregional Cooperation. ADB has played a catalytic role and is actively \nsupporting several subregional cooperation initiatives in Asia. These initiatives include support for \n(i) the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), which was initiated in 1992; (ii) Central Asia; and, more \nrecently, (iii) South Asia Social and Economic Cooperation (SASEC). Experience gained in these \ninitiatives show that peace encourages the natural process of economic integration, including \n                                                 \n18 Initiatives in regional trade facilitation include (i) the proposed South Asian Free Trade Area (SAARC), and (ii) the \nFramework Agreement on ECO Trade Cooperation. \n19 ADB. 2002.

ADB also contributes to economic growth, \nimproved  employment  opportunities,  and  reduced  poverty  by  tapping  the  comparative \nadvantages  of  the  participating  countries.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  subregional  cooperation \ndemonstrates progress and success when collaborating on specific and project-driven activities, \nsuch  as  transport  infrastructure  and  cross-border  facilitation  including  transit,  within  the \nframework  of  existing  relationships.  The  proposed  Project  builds  on  this  experience  by \nintroducing a pilot cross-border development initiative at one major border crossing in Pakistan. \n \n11.  Lessons in Project Implementation. Implementation of the four provincial umbrella \nprojects financed by ADB (para. 9) suffered from fragmented efforts, and coordination problems, \nwhich  led  to  project  implementation  delays.  The  provincial  governments,  including  BPG, \ndemonstrated, however, their capability to implement the projects as envisaged at appraisal with \nthe support of design and construction supervision consultants. Adopting a provincial focus, the \nidentified weaknesses in the umbrella projects were addressed in subsequent provincial road \nprojects for Sindh and Punjab. Both  projects are in the early stages of implementation with \nrecruitment of consultants and procurement actions, and are progressing through with some initial \nstart-up delays. These delays are partly due to the federal and provincial assembly elections, \nwhich took place last year and led to changes in the provincial governments. During  project \npreparation, agreement was reached with CWD and NHA that experienced and dedicated staff \nwould be appointed to key project management positions, specifically for positions as project and \ndeputy project directors. Supported by project preparatory TA consultants, NHA and BPG have \nadvanced in preparing the project proforma (PC-1). NHA and BPG have also allocated adequate \nresources for preconstruction activities and early procurement actions, including prequalification \nof civil works contractors. Project implementation will be also be helped by strong support from \nBPG and the chairman of NHA. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n12.  The objectives of the Project are to reduce poverty and support pro-poor economic growth \nby (i) enhancing access  of rural populations to economic opportunities and social services by \nimproving the province\u2019s road network, (ii) improving trade facilitation and efficiency of the priority \nroad  transport  corridor  linking  Pakistan,  Afghanistan,  and  Central  Asia,  which  crosses \nBalochistan; and (iii) providing essential institutional support and capacity building at CWD. \n \n13.  The Project will improve the inadequate provincial connectivity and allow better access, \nspecifically  for  the  rural  poor,  to  education  and  health  facilities,  markets,  districts,  and  the \nprovincial cities. The Project will also, together with ongoing and planned road rehabilitation and \nreconstruction in Afghanistan, support subregional cooperation by (i) improving cross-border \nmovements of goods and passengers at the Chamman border crossing between Pakistan and \nAfghanistan,  (ii)  improving  access  to  ports  located  in  southern  Pakistan,  and  (iii)  reducing \ntransport cost through improved road conditions and shorter travel time.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n14.  The Project includes four main components: (i) a provincial institutional development \ncomponent (PIDC) supporting CWD and districts,  (ii) a provincial access component  (PAC) \ncomprising rehabilitation and construction of about 1,100 km of provincial roads, (iii) a cross-\nborder development component (CDC), and (iv) a national highway component (NHC) comprising \nrehabilitation  of  247  km  of  national  highways.  As  with  the  two most recent provincial road \n   ", "6  \nprojects, rehabilitation and construction of the provincial roads will follow a sector approach.24  To \nenhance the poverty impact of the Project and ensure that development benefits reach the people \nliving along the project  roads, a complementary community support program will be provided \nthrough a TA loan (paras. 55-56). In addition, a TA grant will assist the Government to review, \ndevelop, and improve trade facilitation measures and prepare a program for increased efficiency \nof cross-border movements of goods and passengers (para. 57). \n \n15.  The PIDC supports the policy actions, which have been agreed upon by BPG and ADB \nand form part of the Project (Appendix 5). These include (i) reviewing CWD\u2019s institutional setup \nand arrangements, including staffing and competence levels; (ii) strengthening the core road \nmanagement functions in CWD's organizational structure, specifically for planning and executing \nmaintenance; (iii) introducing HDM-4 at CWD and revamping the road asset management system \n(RAMS); (iv) strengthening  road maintenance processes and introducing performance-based \nmaintenance  contracts;  (v)  reviewing  the  provincial  sources  for  road  maintenance  funding, \nincluding the provincial budgets and availability of funds for road maintenance, and developing a \nroad user charge mechanism and establishing a road fund for secure and stable funding of \nmaintenance;  (vi)  increasing  funding  of  maintenance;  (vii)  improving  road  safety; and (viii) \nbuilding capacity in environmental and social assessment and resettlement planning.  \n \n16.  The CDC focuses on trade facilitation and draws on recent findings from the TA (footnote \n20)  on  subregional  cooperation,  especially  with  respect  to  corridor,  port,  and  transport \ndevelopments. It also draws on the findings  of the assessment of the current cross-border \nagreements, procedures, and practices for the countries in the region, specifically  Pakistan, \nAfghanistan, Iran, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The CDC complements assistance provided by \nADB on customs modernization and World Bank assistance that focused on capacity building in \ntrade facilitation. The NHC supports subregional cooperation through improvement of the most \nutilized  but  constrained  sections  of  NH25,  which  form  a  component  of  the  Central  Asia-\nAfghanistan-Pakistan corridor, but are in poor condition and suffer from capacity constraints and \npoor road safety. The NHC supports the continued implementation of the ongoing policy and \ninstitutional reform program for NHA, supported by ADB and World Bank (Appendix 6).25 \n \n1.  Provincial Institutional Development Component  \n17.  The PIDC draws on the findings of TA provided by ADB26 to BPG  and policy dialogue \nbetween  ADB  and  BPG/CWD.  The  PIDC  focuses  on  building  capacity  for  institutional \ndevelopment  and  adoption  of  modern  road  management  practices? specifically  for  road \nmaintenance? and  road  safety.  The  PIDC  supports  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \nbuilding at CWD and conforms with the devolution program that is currently being undertaken in \nPakistan.  It  includes  consulting  services,  with  capacity  building,  training,  and  provision  of \nessential equipment for CWD. \n \n18.  Consulting services will be required to  (i) strengthen institutional capacity at CWD and \ndistrict levels for road maintenance and road safety functions, including training of CWD staff, \ndistrict  staff,  and  trainers;  (ii)  introduce  modern  maintenance  concepts? contracting  out, \nperformance-based maintenance? and prepare maintenance manuals; (iii) prepare a number of \n                                                 \n24 A sector loan is deemed appropriate where ADB policy for such a loan is met. For this loan, (i) Balochistan provincial \ngovernment (BPG) has a provincial road sector investment plan to meet the priority development needs, (ii) BPG \nthrough the Communication and Works Department (CWD) has the institutional capacity to implement the Project, \nand (iii) BPG road sector policies can be improved.  \n25 The World Bank is preparing a national highway road project, which  focuses on continued reform of NHA and \nupgrading of national highway 5. \n26 ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n   ", "7   \ncomplete maintenance contracts, including specifications for bidding by CWD on a pilot basis; (iv) \nfurther develop the RAMS at CWD and,  as appropriate, expand it to district administrations; (v) \nhelp BPG and CWD develop (a) a road user charge and mechanism for heavy truck traffic that \ndamages  provincial  roads,  and  (b)  a  mechanism  for  stable  and  secured  funding  of  road \nmaintenance; (vi) provide capacity building with training to enhance the institutional capacity of \nCWD  for  road  safety,  social  and  environment  assessments,  and  handling  of  social  and \nenvironmental  problems  associated  with  road  sector  works;  and  (vii)  guide  nongovernment \norganization (NGO) to conduct poverty monitoring of the Project, specifically covering monitoring \nof contractors\u2019 compliance with applicable labor and other laws, and measures to prevent child \nabuse and promote equal treatment and facilities for both genders. \n \n19.  The PIDC will provide a maintenance system and information technology27 to enhance \nCWD\u2019s  delivery  of  services  to  districts  and  people  living  in  Balochistan.  These  inputs  are \nimportant for (i) strengthening planning and maintenance functions, and (ii) further developing the \nRAMS. The PIDC also provides for equipment for traffic and condition surveys, which are \ndeemed important but are currently not available at CWD. \n \n2.  Provincial Access Component  \n20.  The PAC comprises (i) rehabilitation and construction of about 19 provincial roads totaling \nabout 1,100 km, and (ii) a periodic maintenance subcomponent. Following a sector approach, the \nProject will rehabilitate and construct about 6 provincial highways totaling about 662 km and \nabout 13 rural access roads totaling 468 km, which collectively pass through 20 of Balochistan\u2019s \n26 districts, many of which are poor and  are located  in less developed areas. Most of the \nprovincial roads are located in poor and deprived districts. 28 \n \n21.  The provincial roads will generally be widened to 3.7 or 7.3 meters, depending on traffic \ndensity, and provided with a 2.0- or 2.5-meter-wide shoulders on each side. Wherever possible, \nwidening will be  confined to one side to minimize disruption or adverse impacts and ease \nconstruction and traffic management. The provincial roads will be designed for surface treatment. \nAs existing alignments will be followed, resettlement and environmental impacts will be minimal.  \n \n22.  The provincial roads were identified and assessed under previous ADB TA financed by \nloans, and form part of the provincial road master plan. Six (three provincial highways and three \nrural access roads) of the 53 prescreened roads, totaling about 400 km and representing a \nsample of typical roads from Balochistan and poor districts, were selected as core roads for \nfurther evaluation under the same TA (footnote 26) and subsequent detailed design. The selected \ncore provincial roads were subjected to multiple economic and social criteria analyses: economic \nanalysis,  social  analysis,  assessment  of  poverty  reduction  impacts,  and  environmental \nexamination. A number of stakeholders, specifically from the district administrations, poor people, \nroad users living along or near the roads, and NGOs were involved in the selection process. \nInterviews and surveys of several stakeholder groups indicate strong support for rehabilitating the \nselected provincial roads. \n \n23.  Periodic  Maintenance  Subcomponent.    As  a  pilot  initiative,  this  subcomponent  is \nintended to finance a 3-year time slice of priority road maintenance activities. For each of the 3 \nyears, this component will cover periodic maintenance of an estimated 500 km gravel and \nsurfaced roads to be carried out through maintenance contracts.29 The works will be restricted to \n                                                 \n27 Hardware and software. \n28 Based on a district development ranking carried out by the Punjab Economic Research Institute. \n29  The estimated total cost for this subcomponent is $500,000. See Appendix 7. \n   ", "8  \nperiodic maintenance works and will comprise mainly grading and leveling of gravel roads. The \nroads for this component will be selected after completion of prescreening and condition surveys \nby the consultants under the PIDC. The works will be supervised by the consultants under the \nPAC. Since this component is included to encourage BPG to commit more of its annual budget to \nperiodic maintenance resources, the cost to be met under the ADB loan will be limited to 30%, \nwhile the balance of 70% will be met through BPG counterpart funding. This component will \nincrease  awareness  and  understanding  of  road  maintenance,  contribute  to  securing  BPG \nresources for periodic road maintenance, and address the critical backlog in road maintenance. \n \n24.  Under the PIDC, a mechanism for improved axle load control will be designed. In addition, \nCWD will pursue a dedicated information campaign and training in close coordination with the \nother BPG departments and agencies responsible for enforcing axle-load control and information, \nsuch as the police, drivers\u2019 training centers, truck and bus owners and operators, road user \nassociations, and the general public. \n \n3.  Cross-Border Development Component \n25.  The CDC comprises physical and nonphysical subcomponents. The physical component \naddresses the identified constraints, which specifically include lack of basic infrastructure, and \nscattered facilities along with inefficient and slow handling procedures at the border crossings. \nThe non-physical component includes a detailed review (under  TA accompanying this loan) \nincluding training by consultants on current cross-border practices covering immigration, customs, \nsecurity, and other cross-border functions and related procedures at the four main border points \nin Pakistan. The review will be the basis for a detailed analysis and preparation of an action plan \naimed at simplifying, and relaxing or removing nonphysical and nontariff barriers within  the \nexisting legal and regulatory framework. In addition, the review will provide inputs for developing \nand designing a new cross-border facility at Chamman. The objective is to improve efficiency, \nreduce transaction cost, improve service, and reduce waiting times at the border crossing. Using \nthe findings and recommendations of the TA, the design and supervision consultants under the \nNHC will design a new cross-border facility at Chamman, which will be constructed under the civil \nworks contract in the NHC (para. 26). \n \n26.  It is envisaged that the new cross-border facility at Chamman will perform most or all main \nfunctions required for efficient cross-border movement of goods, vehicles, and passengers. Staff \nresponsible for immigration, customs, and security, and staff providing banking, insurance, and \nother services will be located in the new facility. The new cross-border facility will be constructed \nand equipped with modern systems and equipment. It will comprise a new building, truck parking \nfacilities, cargo inspection sheds, weigh bridges, telephones and customs systems. The private \nsector will be invited to provide services and establish complementary storage and other facilities. \nIt is envisaged that the new concept may, at a later stage, be broadened to a joint project with the \nGovernment of Afghanistan with a view that the new facilities might take the form of a one-stop \nshop operated jointly by the authorities on both sides of the border.  The component includes \ntraining the  various  staff; handling immigration, security, customs, weigh stations; and other \nfunctions at the cross-border facility, focusing on modern and efficient practices. Immigration and \ncustoms officers will also receive training in regulations governing the movement of vehicles, \npersons, and freight through Pakistan and in and out  of Afghanistan, the duties payable on \nvarious types of cargo, the nature of any prohibited cargoes, and measures to improve efficiency \nand reduce time taken to cross the border. \n \n   ", "9   \n4.  National Highway Component  \n27.  For  the  NHC,  which  will  facilitate  regional  traffic  and  also  improve  connectivity  to \nBalochistan\u2019s provincial road network, 247 km of NH25 will be rehabilitated and widened covering \nthe sections (i) Kalat\u2013Quetta, 130 km, and (ii) Quetta\u2013Chamman, 117 km.  \n \n28.  The national highways will be 7.3 meters wide with a 3.0-meter-wide shoulder on each \nside. Wherever possible,  the widening  will be  confined to one side to minimize disruption or \nadverse impacts and ease construction and traffic management. The roads will be designed for \nasphalt-concrete  pavements.  As  existing  alignments  will  be  followed,  resettlement  and \nenvironmental impacts will be minimal. Road safety audit will be conducted as part of the update \nof  the  existing  designs.  A  summary  of  the  design  approach  and  technical  standards  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix A.  \n29.  NHA identified the national highways, which were assessed under previous TA and form \npart of NHA\u2019s medium-term budget framework and approved investment plan. Their feasibilities \nwere  further  evaluated  and  confirmed  under  TA  (footnote  26),30  and  subjected  to  detailed \ntechnical evaluation and assessment, economic viability analysis, and analysis of poverty, social, \nand environmental impacts.  \n30.  The  Project  will  install  weigh  stations  at  the  Chamman  border  crossing,  along  with \nequipment and related civil works. The location and technical specifications will be determined \nduring the update of the detailed design during implementation of the Project from 2004. As a \nseparate ongoing initiative, NHA is implementing a road safety action plan and  an axle-load \ncontrol  program,  which  also  comprises  a  dedicated  information  campaign  and  training  of \nagencies  responsible  for  enforcement  and  information,  including  the  police,  institutions for \neducation, drivers\u2019 training centers, truck and bus owners and operators, road user associations, \nand the general public.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Road Maintenance \n31.  The  Project  supports  improved  road  maintenance  with  several  subcomponents  and \nactivities under the PIDC. The medium-term road maintenance needs and funding sources will be \nassessed and a funding mechanism designed and implemented under the Project.  This may \ninclude design of a road user charge mechanism that will recover damage caused by heavy truck \ntraffic by charging a maintenance fee or something similar for all heavy vehicles passing strategic \npoints on Balochistan\u2019s road network. Another initiative supported by the Project is strengthening \nof  maintenance  planning  capacity  building,  and  improved  execution  of  maintenance  by \ncontracting it out to the private sector. The PIDC includes preparation of complete contract \ndocumentation, including specifications, for bidding out periodic and routine maintenance to the \nprivate  sector.  In  addition,  contract  documentation  with  specifications  will  be  developed  for \nperformance-based maintenance on  a pilot basis. The objective is to increase  contracted-out \nmaintenance over time so that the share of contracted-out maintenance to the private sector \nreaches at least 10% by 2005, 20% by 2006, and 40% by 2007.  \n \n                                                 \n30 The two selected sections were found to be the most constrained and narrow sections on NH25, but carry the most \ntraffic of all sections on NH25. Most other sections on NH25 have also previously been widened to 7.3-meter \ncarriageway plus shoulders. \n   ", "10  \n2.  Road Safety \n32.  Poor road safety affects the many poor people who live in the  project influence area. \nAcknowledging the importance of improving road safety while taking into account the provincial \ninstitutional capacity, BPG will prepare, with the support of consultants, a provincial road safety \naction plan under the PIDC. Representatives of road user groups, NGOs, and others? including \nthe most vulnerable to such accidents, the poor pedestrians?  will be consulted. The action plan, \nwhich will build  on  and  complement  other  federal  and  provincial  road  safety  programs,  will \ncomprise  a  series  of  preventive  measures,  such  as  education,  information  campaigns  and \ntraining; and corrective measures, including enforcing traffic safety regulation and introducing \nroad safety audits for provincial roads, to reduce the number of road accidents in Balochistan. \nThe Project will provide support with input from consultants under the PIDC and provision for \nequipment, such as for accident reporting or other requirements, as might be identified in the road \nsafety action plan. It is envisaged that a  reputable NGO will be engaged to administer and \ncoordinate the work, which will be carried out under the action plan, and also  to assist in its \nimplementation when feasible and justified. At the federal level, NHA is undergoing a road safety \nprogram supported by ADB and World Bank (footnote 14). \n \n3.  Capacity Building for Environment and Social Assessment   \n33.  CWD lacks staff, expertise, and capacity to carry out environment and social assessment. \nTo address this constraint, CWD has agreed to establish the Road Environment and Social \nAssessment Cell (RESAC). RESAC is expected to carry out many functions for the environment, \nand  social  safeguards  and  assessment  for  the  road  sector.  However,  RESAC  lacks  staff, \nexpertise, and capacity to carry out environment and social assessment. To ensure that RESAC \nachieves its intended role and function, a program with action to enhance the capacity of this unit \nwill be developed and implemented under the Project. A consultant team on social development, \ngender, resettlement, and environment under the PIDC will help CWD prepare and implement the \ninstitutional enhancement program.  \n \n4.  Subregional Cooperation \n34.  The Project is the first in Pakistan, which, together with other ongoing and planned road \nprojects in Afghanistan, supports subregional cooperation through physical and nonphysical \nimprovements of critical sections of NH25, which form part of the transport corridor of Central \nAsia-Afghanistan-Pakistan  that  passes  through  Balochistan.  Apart  from  providing  improved \naccess to ports in southern Pakistan, the Project will also facilitate the economic and social \ndevelopment of the transport corridor area through improved access and easier movement of \npeople and goods, and these help reduce poverty and support pro-poor economic growth. Other \nnontransport-related initiatives, including those by other aid agencies, will provide linkages  to \nrealize the corridor concept and support area development along that corridor. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n35.  The estimated cost of the Project is $267.3 million equivalent, including civil works, \nequipment, consulting services, land acquisition, resettlement, institutional support to CWD and \nthe project management unit, taxes, customs, and contingencies. The cost comprises $162.5 \nmillion  in  foreign  exchange  (60.8%  of  the  total)  including  $8.0  million  for  interest  during \nconstruction, and $104.8 million equivalent (39.2%) in local currency.

Financing Plan \n36.  The Government has requested a loan of  \u00a520,266,370,000 ($185.7 million equivalent) \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the Project (Table 2). The loan will have a \n25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 0.5% (the fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the  reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were \nits own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from \n   ", "12  \nADB. The Borrower will make available the loan proceeds to NHA ($85.7 million equivalent) and \nBPG ($100 million equivalent).  \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nForeign  Local  Total  Percent \nSource \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n         \nADB  162.5  23.2  185.7  69.5 \nGovernment  0.0  81.6  81.6   30.5 \nTotal  162.5  104.8  267.3  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank.  \nSource: ADB staff estimates. \n \n37.  The amount of local currency funding takes account of the current fiscal situation in \nPakistan. The country is one of the poorest in the world and the federal Government and BPG \nhave difficulty mobilizing sufficient funds from their own resources to meet all development \ncommitments, including rehabilitation and upgrading critical physical and social infrastructure. \nAlthough  the  need  to  generate  domestic  resources  to  finance  investments  for  sustaining \neconomic growth is well recognized, the country has not yet developed the resource base \nnecessary to adequately finance without external assistance the required level of investments. \nUnder the current circumstances, a large investment-savings gap will continue exerting pressure \non development program. Thus, external support is needed to meet some of the local currency \ncosts  of  projects.  In  line  with  ADB's  policy  to  help  provide  local  currency  cost  financing, \nparticularly for projects that address priority poverty concerns in  economically less developed \nregions, about 12.5 % of the loan will be for that purpose. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management  \n38.  CWD will be the Executing Agency for the PIDC and the PAC (Supplementary Appendix \nB). The  secretary of CWD will assume overall responsibility for project implementation. The \nadditional chief secretary for development will chair a steering group comprising senior staff of \nBPG and CWD, which will guide the CWD institutional strengthening program and the action plan \nforming part of the policy matrix agreed  upon with ADB. The core  project management unit, \n(PMU) through the Project Engineering Cell, will be responsible for project management. The \nPMU already established by CWD is headed by a project director. The project director will be \nsupported by other staff including two deputies who will be in charge of day-to-day administration \nof the provincial roads. While the  PMU  has  experience  with  ADB-financed projects and is \ngenerally capable, some institutional strengthening is required to ensure effective implementation. \nThus, the PMU will be supported by institutional consultants under the Project as well as  by \ndesign and construction supervision consultants. The  institutional consultants will support the \nPMU in project management, supervision of short-term consultants under the  PIDC, contract \nadministration, and project preparatory work, while the design and supervision consultants will be \nresponsible for construction supervision in accordance with the Federation International des \nIngenieurs-Conseils (FIDIC) conditions. The consultants will help build capacity at CWD and PMU \nto effectively manage and implement all project components, specifically the civil works and \nresettlement plans, and prepare subprojects for the provincial roads component. Early in their \nwork, the institutional consultants will prepare project preparation and implementation manuals. \nThe implementation arrangements for the PIDC and the PAC are shown in Appendix 8.  \n \n   ", "13   \n39.  NHA will be the Executing Agency for the CDC and the NHC (Supplementary Appendix \nC). The NHA Chairman will chair a steering group, comprising senior staff members of NHA, who \nwill guide in implementing the NHC. While NHA will be responsible for design and construction of \nthe new cross-border facility under the CDC, the secretary of the Ministry of Communications  \n(MOC), in consultation with the existing Task Force on Trade Facilitation (chaired by Joint \nSecretary, Ministry of Commerce),  will be the  Implementing Agency for the other parts of the \nCDC,  specifically for planning the structure, authority and procedures for  operating the new \ncross-border facility. NHA has already appointed a project director and has experience with ADB-\nfinanced projects. It is capable of implementing the  Project with support of the construction \nsupervision consultants. The implementation arrangements for the CDC and the NHA are shown \nin Appendix 9.  \n \n2.  Subproject Preparation for the Provincial Access Component \n40.  The core provincial roads are prescreened and meet criteria that are acceptable to ADB. \nSpecifically, the core roads must have been found technically feasible, economically justified, and \nsocially and environmentally responsible. Most of the data needed for selecting and prioritizing \nthese roads were prepared under project preparatory and technical assistance and loan-financed \nTA. The full data and documentation required for approval of all subprojects are not yet available \nand data will be prepared under the Project. While the subproject roads will be selected at the \ndiscretion of BPG, ADB approval will be required before tendering for road improvement.   \n \n41.  CWD will submit to ADB only subprojects that meet the criteria for financing under the \nloan (Appendix 10). The list of prescreened candidate subprojects is in Supplementary Appendix \nD.  Each  subproject  should  (i)  be  economically  viable,  (ii)  be  technically  feasible,  (iii)  be \nenvironmentally and socially responsible, (iv) be screened for environmental impacts, (v) be \nselected based on prioritized district development ranking, (vi) be selected and designed to avoid \nor minimize resettlement (a resettlement plan should be prepared where needed), (vii) be part of \nthe provincial road master plan, (viii) be in compliance with all applicable ADB guidelines, (ix) \nhave received all BPG and other approvals, (x) have sufficient counterpart funding, (xi) have \nbudget provided for operation and maintenance of the road, and (xii) have district commitment to \nmaintenance of that road. CWD will seek ADB approval by submitting a request for subproject \napproval that will include (i) a cover sheet; (ii) a basic data sheet; (iii) a location map; (iv) an initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) or environmental impact assessment, as appropriate, in ADB \nformat; (v) the BPG environment approval; and (vi) a resettlement plan, in a format acceptable to \nADB. \n \n3.  Implementation Schedule \n42.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years, including  preconstruction activities. A \nsummary implementation schedule, based on a detailed schedule prepared by NHA, CWD, and \nADB, is  in  Appendix  11. The schedule assumes that the project loan will be approved in \nNovember 2003 and be effective by 1 February 2004. The two national highways and the six core \nprovincial roads will be ready for contract awards in June 2004. The subprojects for the noncore \nprovincial  roads  will  be  implemented  in  subsequent  phases,  going  through  subproject \npreparation, bidding and award of civil works, and construction.  \n4.  Procurement \n43.  Goods and related services and civil works will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement.  Civil works for the national highway component will be procured \nthrough  four  contract  packages  following  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  among \n   ", "14  \nprequalified bidders. ICB will be followed for all civil works contracts with an estimated value \nexceeding $3 million. Civil works contracts with an estimated value equal to or below $3 million \nwill follow local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB, with separate prequalification. \nContracts for goods and related services estimated to cost in excess of $500,000 will be subject \nto ICB. The provincial roads entail about 12 contracts for civil works, each with an estimated \nvalue of $1.0 million to $10 million. Equipment will be procured under international shopping \nprocedures. International shopping procedures will be followed for supply contracts valued at less \nthan $500,000 equivalent and direct purchase procedures will be followed for items valued at less \nthan  $100,000.  NHA  and  CWD  have  agreed  to  include  the  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy31 in all bidding documents and contracts. In July 2003, ADB approved \nCWD\u2019s request for advance action for procurement. BPG and CWD were advised that such \napproval  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project.  Contract  packages  for  the  national \nhighways and the core provincial roads are in Appendix 12.  \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n44.  The Project will require 250 person-months of international and 4,509 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services for (i) institutional development with capacity building under the \nPIDC, (ii) construction supervision of the civil works for the national highways, and (iii) detailed \ndesign and construction supervision for civil works for the provincial roads. All consultants will be \nselected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for  engaging domestic consultants. The quality- and cost-\nbased selection procedure will be followed  in selecting consulting firms. Both NHA and CWD \nhave agreed to include the relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy in all invitations for \nbidding documents and contracts.   \n \n45.  ADB and CWD have agreed on the objectives and the scope of the consulting services for \ninstitutional development and capacity building under the PIDC. The scope includes support and \ncapacity building in project management, road maintenance and development of a RAMS, and \nsupport services to the PMU including preparation of subprojects in a format acceptable to ADB. \nConsulting services will be provided by an international firm in association with a domestic firm. \nThe approximate staffing inputs will be about 78 person-months of international and 200 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants. The overall period of the services will be about 48 months. The \nsummary terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n46.  CWD will engage one consulting firm for design and construction supervision of provincial \nroads. Staffing inputs will be about 101 person-months of international and 3,202 person-months \nof domestic consultants. The overall period of services will be about 72 months. Furnished office \nfacilities, utilities, vehicles, and equipment required by the construction supervision consultants \n(CSCs) will be provided under the Project. Field offices, material testing laboratories with utilities, \nand vehicles required by construction inspectors will be supplied through the civil works contracts \nfor  the  provincial  roads,  as  appropriate.  The  summary  terms  of  reference  are  given  in \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \n47.  NHA will engage one international firm in association with a domestic firm for construction \nsupervision of national highways. Staffing inputs will be about 71 person-months of international \nand 1,107 person-months of domestic consultants. The overall period of the services will be \nabout 72 months. Furnished office facilities, utilities, vehicles, and equipment required by the \nCSCs will be provided under the Project. Field offices, material testing laboratories with utilities, \nand vehicles required by construction inspectors will be supplied through the civil works contracts \n                                                 \n31 ADB. 1998. Anticorruption Policy. Manila. Available: http://www.adb.org/work/Policies/Anticorruption. \n   ", "15   \nfor the national highways, as appropriate. The summary terms of reference are in Supplementary \nAppendix G.  \n \n  6.  Advance Action  \n \n48.  On 14 July 2003, ADB approved advance action for recruiting project consultants and for \npreconstruction activities for the civil works. The Mission has advised NHA and BPG that any \nsuch approval would not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n  7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n49.  All  disbursement  procedures  under  the  loan  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (January 2001). Direct payment procedures will be followed for consulting services and \nthe civil works under ICB. Imprest account procedures will be used for the local bidding for civil \nworks for CWD and also for CWD\u2019s incremental expenditures under the loan. The imprest account \nwill be established in the National Bank of Pakistan. The initial advance will not exceed the \nestimated expenditures for 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The statement \nof expenditure procedure will be used for all payments and contracts under $50,000 equivalent.   \n \n8.  Accounts, Audit, and Reports \na.  Accounts and Audit \n50.  NHA and  CWD will maintain records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and \nservices financed by the loan proceeds, the financing sources received, the expenditures incurred, \nand use of local funds. The accounts will be set up in accordance with sound accounting principles. \nExternal accounting experts will be engaged to design project accounts to be used by NHA and \nCWD. Consolidated project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually by \nprivate sector auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited reports and related financial statements in \nEnglish will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which \nthey  relate.  The  director-general  of  audits  will  coordinate  all  account  activities  and  ensure \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s audit and accounting requirements. ADB will review and follow up on these \nmatters as necessary.  \n \n51.  All procurement and disbursement activities will be subject to independent performance \naudit to ensure transparency, and objective and independent assessment of such activities. The \nperformance audit will be conducted three times during project implementation in conjunction with \nthe annual audit of project accounts and financial statements and will be carried out by the same \nexternal auditors. In addition, ADB will conduct project procurement and disbursement audits during \nimplementation as part of its regular review. Both NHA and BPG have agreed to combat corruption \nin the road sector, including the procurement of contracts, by preparing an anticorruption strategy \nfor the road sector, in consultation with civil society and anticorruption agencies in Pakistan and \nADB. The strategy will be prepared within 6 months of loan effectiveness. NHA and BPG will \nimplement the strategy during the remaining project implementation period. \n \nb.  Reports \n52.  Before starting  the civil works under the Project, NHA and CWD will provide ADB with \nmonthly progress reports on the status of preconstruction activities. These reports, due at the end \nof each month, will be sent in electronic form. When the PMUs and the CSCs have been appointed, \n   ", "16  \nthey will prepare monthly progress and quarterly reports32 for NHA, CWD, PMUs and ADB. The \nformat of the reports will be discussed and agreed upon before consulting services starts. Once the \nworks have been completed, NHA  and CWD will arrange for the consultants to submit a project \ncompletion report within 3 months of the physical completion of the Project. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n53.  Both NHA and CWD, with the assistance of the PMUs and the CSCs, will separately carry \nout project performance and benefit monitoring and evaluation (M&E) by compiling and analyzing \nappropriate traffic, socioeconomic, and other data for the project roads. This evaluation will follow \nADB\u2019s Project Performance Management Systems Handbook. For this purpose, a baseline survey \nfor one national highway and three provincial roads (comprising provincial highway, secondary \nand/or access road) will be undertaken. This will be followed by data collection and other surveys \nduring implementation and immediately after these project roads have been completed and handed \nover. The findings and supporting data will be incorporated into the project completion report. \nSystems for recording data and statistics for such monitoring will be established as part of the \nproject implementation arrangements with assistance of the PMUs and the CSCs. NHA and CWD, \nassisted by the consultants will evaluate the benefits of the Project in accordance with a schedule \nand terms of reference to be agreed upon with ADB. \n \n10.  Project Review \n54.  ADB  will  conduct  regular  reviews  throughout  project  implementation.  Midway  through \nProject  implementation  (end-2006),  ADB,  NHA,  and  CWD  will  review  the  Project  and  its \nimplementation status in detail. The review will cover the entire scope of the Project to determine \nwhether any adjustments  in  the  proposed  procurement  and  management  arrangements  are \nneeded. The review will also address any outstanding procurement problems, and financing and \nscheduling matters. \n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN \n55.  To enhance the poverty impact of the Project, and  to ensure that maximum possible \ndevelopment benefits reach the people living along the project roads and that the resources they \nrely on are protected and developed in a sustainable way, additional provincial support will be \nprovided through a TA loan. The TA will support devolution and assist BPG and the district \nadministration in enhancing the project benefits to the poor. The TA  will have three parts: (i) \ndeveloping community infrastructure  and empowering communities, and (ii) strengthening of \nsocial protection and education, and (iii) monitoring and measuring poverty and social impacts. \nThe initiatives under the TA loan are to be selected in a participatory process involving the \ncommunities and the district administration from the  provincial roads, which are located in the \npoorest districts in Balochistan. The TA loan will be implemented over 4 years, with expenditure \ncommencing at the start of FY2004. The objectives, tentative scope, financing, and implementation \narrangements are in Appendix 13. The TA loan will be executed by CWD and implemented by \nreputable NGOs, with CWD support and close coordination with the district administrations. \n \n56.  The total cost of the TA loan is estimated to be about $1.25 million. ADB will finance all \nforeign exchange cost and a portion of the local currency costs. ADB will provide one loan \nequivalent to SDR 701,000 million [$1.0 million equivalent] from its Special Funds resources with a \nmaturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; and such other terms and conditions as are \n                                                 \n32 The quarterly report will also include data on project performance monitoring and benefit monitoring. \n   ", "17   \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft TA Loan  Agreement.  Consulting \nservices may be provided by one or more consulting firms or individual consultants recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB.  \n \nV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANT \n \n57.  To support the Project and assist in improving trade facilitation, the Government has \nrequested TA to prepare a program for more efficient cross-border operations and to establish a \npilot cross-border facility. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $630,000, comprising foreign \nexchange  of  $285,000  and  local  currency  of  $345,000  equivalent.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, including the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$215,000 equivalent of the local currency cost; the Government will finance the balance of the \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nTA scope, implementation arrangements, outline terms of reference, cost estimates and financing \nplan are outlined in Appendix 14. \n \nVI.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits  \n58.  The economic analysis (Appendix 15) of the national highways shows economic internal \nrates of return (EIRRs) of 37.7% and 40.4%, respectively. The economic analysis of the six core \nprovincial roads shows EIRRs of 14.8\u201348.9%. The sensitivity analysis shows that the EIRRs for \nall evaluated roads are above 12% and quite robust.  \n \n59.  Economic analysis was carried out using the highway design and maintenance (HDM) \nsoftware. The model evaluates project investments considering capital and recurrent costs as \nwell as the benefits derived from savings in road user costs for the  with-project and  without-\nproject cases.  Economic analysis assumed the project life  to be 20 years. Two improvement \noptions  were  considered,  i.e.,  asphaltic  concrete  overlay  and  surface  dressing  for  different \npermutations of traffic levels and road roughness conditions. The main quantifiable benefits of the \nproject are (i) savings on vehicle operating costs (VOC) for existing traffic, and (ii) VOC savings \nfor  generated  traffic  because  of  improvements  in  road  surface  conditions.  In  addition, \nnonquantifiable benefits will arise from improved access to markets, which will boost agricultural \neconomic  activities;  reduced  agricultural  input  costs  because  of  better  transport  facilities; \nimproved access to health, education, and other social sector facilities; and subregional benefits \narising from improved trade facilitation and reduced delays at border crossings.  \n \nB.  Poverty Reduction Impact \n60.  The overall poverty level in Balochistan is reported at 39.1% of which 43.7% is for rural \nareas and 29.5% for urban areas (para. 4). While the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper of the \nGovernment reports the overall poverty figure in Balochistan at 41-47%, about 50% of the rural \nvillages in Balochistan have no or very poor road access.  Around 76% of the population in \nBalochistan live in rural areas, where the incidence of poverty approached almost 50% before the \nrecent drought, and now may be approaching 70% in drought stricken rural areas, compared with \nabout 35% of the rural population living below the poverty line for Pakistan as a whole. Data for \nBalochistan is  questionable as the low population density makes sampling difficult, but the \nhousehold  survey  results  indicate  that  poverty  levels  among  households  sampled  for  the \nprovincial roads are on average 53%. \n \n   ", "18  \n61.  The Project is classified as a poverty intervention and will directly reduce poverty by \nlowering the costs of transport for the poor traveling to farmers\u2019 markets, labor markets, health \nand education centers, and other social and public services. According to the conducted poverty \nassessment,  the  Project  will  have  a  large  effect  on  reducing  poverty,  directly  benefiting \napproximately 500,000 people in 19 districts living adjacent to the roads. Of these, an estimated \n200,000 poor people will be direct beneficiaries. Many more will benefit in the long run from the \nlower transport costs and induced economic and social development.  \n \n62.  The estimated poverty impact ratios of the core roads range from 26% to over 100% of \nthe net economic benefits accruing to the poor for the Project as a whole, with most roads having \nbetween 30% and 50%. Such benefits will become evident in higher agricultural product profit \nmargins for poor farmers,  as well as lower cost and more timely access to schools, medical \nclinics, and employment centers. Furthermore, the lower transport costs will increase mobility \namong the poor and help them find employment opportunities in other areas. \n \n63.  The Project will generate significant employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled \nlabor during  implementation. Unskilled labor (males and females) will be employed directly in \nroad construction and maintenance and indirectly by providing materials and services to the \nconstruction and maintenance activities. The Project will generate for unskilled labor employment \nopportunities of approximately 22,560 person-months for national highways and 31,560 person-\nmonths for provincial and rural roads.  The Project will have positive externalities, which will \nimprove the livelihood of the poor. The poverty reduction aspects of the Project will be enhanced \nby encouraging contractors to engage local workers in project areas and providing first priority to \nthe poor and disadvantaged in the actual construction of provincial roads. \n \nC.  Social Dimensions and Impacts \n \n64.  The  social  dimensions  of  the  Project,  including  stakeholder  participation  and  equity \nconsideration, are designed to facilitate more pro-poor and equitable distribution benefits. The \nProject will adopt a participatory approach to effectively implement the resettlement plan and an \nawareness campaign on road safety issues. The initial poverty and social assessment did not \nidentify indigenous people or minorities because of the insular nature of some communities, and \nan indigenous people\u2019s development plan (IPDP) is not required. Small groups of affected people \nwere interviewed to determine their aspirations and their likely reaction to the road. Support for \nthe roads was universal, with all groups identifying positive outcomes.  The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 16. \n \n65.  As part of institutional reform, the Project will strengthen the capacity of CWD to address \npoverty, environment, social safeguard, and social development issues in the transport sector. \nGender awareness training will be given to CWD staff at provincial and district levels. Gender-\ndisaggregated data will be collected through the baseline project performance management \nsystem survey as well as in subsequent surveys to be conducted at midterm and completion of \nthe project. \n \n66.  In compliance with Government and international core labor standards,  CWD will be \nstrengthened to monitor the implementation of labor laws, particularly  the issues of equal pay for \nequal work between women and men workers; prohibition of child labor; and provisions on health, \nsanitation, and appropriate working conditions, including accommodation, where appropriate, for \nconstruction workers at campsites during the construction period. A number of covenants related \nto this issue will be incorporated in the loan agreement. \n \n   ", "19   \n67.  The Project was developed with a view to avoid or minimize the need for land acquisition \nand  involuntary  resettlement.  A  full  census  was  conducted  of  all  affected  people,  land, \nstructures/assets  on  the  right-of-way  for  the  two  national  highways  and  the  six  core \nrepresentative subprojects for the provincial roads component, including a 25% socioeconomic \nsample survey for resettlement planning. The Project will require acquisition of approximately 42 \nhectares for the two national highways and six core provincial roads, and will likely affect about \n487 people  as a consequence of  land acquisition.  Widening and improvement will affect 143 \nstructures  (80  shops  or  small  business  enterprises,  39  residential  houses,  and  24  other \nstructures).  The  estimated  cost  for  land  acquisition,  compensation,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring is approximately $4 million equivalent. A summary resettlement plan is presented in \nAppendix 17. The summary in local language and in English will be distributed to the affected \npeople by NHA and BPG and through NHA and ADB web sites. The complete plan will be \npublicly  available  at  NHA,  CWD,  and  at  ADB's  Pakistan  Resident  Mission. The remaining \nsubprojects (provincial roads) will be selected during implementation. The requirements of ADB\u2019s \npolicy on involuntary resettlement for preparing the sector loan necessitated a resettlement \nframework (Appendix 18) for all subprojects. A resettlement plan for each remaining subproject \nwill be prepared and approved by BPG and submitted to ADB for approval. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts and Measures \n \n68.  In  accordance  with  ADB's  requirements  on  environmental  assessment,  an  IEE  was \nprepared for the two national highways and the six core provincial roads. The IEE (Appendix 19) \nshows that, generally, the Project will not cause significant environmental problems and with the \nmitigation measures, potential adverse impacts are manageable. The Project will comply with all \nADB environmental assessment requirements. The environmental mitigation measures during the \nconstruction phase will be incorporated into the bidding documents for civil works, and NHA and \nCWD will be responsible for overall environmental management in their respective components.  \n  \nE.  Project Risks  \n69.  A potential risk is the delays in project preparation and start-up activities and necessary \napprovals by NHA and BPG. This risk will be mitigated through approval of advance actions by \nNHA and BPG and adequate allocation of staff and other resources. The PMUs are  already \nestablished  at  NHA  and  CWD  and  have  been  sufficiently  staffed  and  empowered  with \nexperienced staff. An implementation unit is also being established at MOC for execution of the \nTA grant. \n \n70.  Another risk is lack of project sustainability due to inadequate maintenance. This risk has \nbeen addressed by the asset management and maintenance activities forming part of the Project. \nNHA and BPG are committed to provide sufficient and increased funding for road maintenance, \nincluding increasingly contracting out  maintenance to the private sector. Maintenance forms a \ncentral and integral part of the PIDC and NHA and BPG will take the necessary steps to increase \nfunding for maintenance and introduce new maintenance concepts and procedures.  \n \n71.  NHA and BPG are committed to reform of their institutions. While NHA is undergoing a \nreform program supported by ADB, BPG has agreed with ADB on a set of institutional and other \nreform  measures,  covering  institutional  development  with  capacity  building  and  improved \nmaintenance and road safety, with measurable targets. Consultants will support BPG and CWD \nto introduce institutional reform measures and to build capacity. The risks of failure or slowdown \nin reform are therefore considered manageable.  \n \n   ", "20  \n72.  The recent history of conflict in the region and related incidents or threats is a potential \nrisk for the project. The federal and provincial governments are aware of this risk and have taken \nmeasures to manage it as far as is possible. \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n73.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, NHA, BPG, and CWD have \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n74.  Environment. NHA and BPG will ensure the following: \n \n(i)  Road construction and maintenance will be carried out as required under the \nGovernment's  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nguidelines including (a) appropriate selection of quarry and borrow sites and their \nrehabilitation after use; (b) proper disposal of soils and construction materials; (c) \nuse of sound environmental design and construction techniques that ensure slope \nstability and drainage; and (d) minimization of construction impacts such as dust, \ndiversion of stream flow and increased turbulence, and equipment noise. \n \n(ii)  When project roads pass through or near protected or sensitive areas (e.g., nature \nreserves, parks, conservation areas, biodiversity reserves, or cultural and historical \nsites), rapid assessment will be carried out before any construction work starts. \nBPG  will  ensure  cooperation  with  the  responsible  authority  in  preparing  and \nimplementing protective measures, which may include area demarcation, fencing, \ncheckpoints, speed bumps, wildlife passage zones, patrols or other measures to \nprotect the area from encroachment or environmental degradation due to road \nimprovement and increased access.  \n \n75.  Resettlement. NHA and BPG will ensure that land acquisition and resettlement activities \nare implemented in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s  policy on \ninvoluntary resettlement, as set out in the agreed-upon resettlement plans for core subprojects \nand resettlement framework (Appendix 18) for noncore subprojects, including the following: (i) \nland and rights-of-way will be acquired in a proper and timely manner; (ii) compensation will be \nprovided at replacement cost and entitlements as stipulated in the resettlement plan, with ADB\u2019s \npolicy to prevail in  case of any difference with the Government's laws and regulations; (iii) \ncounterpart funds and disbursements will be provided promptly to affected people, with agreed-\nupon compensation given to them before any land is taken or civil works contracts awarded, and \nthe Project will not use any emergency provisions that allow land to be taken in advance of \npayment; (iv) NHA and CWD have  guaranteed to meet unforeseen obligations in excess of \nbudget estimates; (v) NHA and CWD will implement adequate supervision, monitoring, and \nreporting;  (vi)  a  competent  independent  agency  will  be  in  charge  of  external  M&E;  (vii) \nresettlement  fund  disbursements  and  expenditures  will  be  audited annually; (viii) adequate \ninformation dissemination to and consultation with affected people will be done; (ix) consultation \nand grievances will be documented; (x) resettlement plans will be updated if the scope of the \nProject is changed; and (xi) progress will be regularly reported to ADB.  \n \n76.  Grievance and Redress Mechanism. The Borrower will cause CWD and NHA to form \nwithin  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness  an  independent  committee  consisting  of  individuals \nunrelated to the Project to hear any grievance or other complaint relating to resettlement issues. \n   ", "21   \nThe committee will hold a public hearing of any grievance or complaint filed with it and make its \nrecommendations for redress, if any, within 45 days of receipt of the complaint. \n \n77.  Health Risks and Provisions. NHA and BPG will ensure that the civil works contracts \ninclude an information and education campaign on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS33 \nfor construction workers as part of the health and safety program at campsites during the \nconstruction period. NHA and BPG will ensure that the civil works contracts include legally \nmandated  provisions  on  health,  sanitation,  and  appropriate  working  conditions,  including \naccommodation, and clean drinking water for construction workers at campsites during the \nconstruction period. \n \n78.  Illegal Trafficking of Women, Children, and Goods.  The Borrower  will ensure that \nNHA and CWD enact measures, satisfactory to ADB, to  prevent, monitor, detect, and arrest \nillegal trafficking of women and children and illegal movement of goods. NHA and CWD  will \nsubmit to ADB quarterly reports summarizing issues addressed, progress made, and future plans \nfor action. \n \n79.  Labor Laws. NHA and BPG will ensure that the civil works contractors comply with all \napplicable labor and worker safety laws, and do not employ children in construction activities. \nNHA and BPG will set employment targets for women for road construction activities acceptable \nto ADB and will cause contractors to adhere to such targets. The Government will provide equal \nopportunity  for  women  for  road  construction  activities,  and  will  not  allow  contractors  to \ndifferentiate wages for men and women for work of equal value. A specific clause to this effect will \nbe included in bidding documents, and compliance will be strictly monitored during project \nimplementation.  \n \n80.  Anticorruption. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate directly, or through its agents, any possible \nfinancial or management impropriety in conducting the Project. The Government, NHA, BPG, and \nCWD agree to fully cooperate with any such investigation and extend all necessary assistance, \nincluding access to all relevant books and records as well as engagement by NHA or CWD of \nindependent experts that may be needed for satisfactory completion of such investigations. All \nexternal costs related to the investigations will be borne by the Project. Within 6 months of loan \neffectiveness,  BPG  and  NHA  will  also  prepare  an  anticorruption  strategy,  which  will  be \nimplemented during the project implementation period. \n \n81.  Project Management.  In order to ensure continuity, transparency, efficiency and good \nmanagement, NHA, BPG and CWD will consult with ADB on matters related to management of \nthe Project. All matters relating to selection or appointment, or any changes to such selection or \nappointment, of any project director or deputy project director, will be duly notified to ADB.    \n \n82.  RESAC. CWD will establish RESAC and provide a core staff including two experienced \nexperts by December 2003 to deal with issues such as resettlement planning and management, \npoverty reduction monitoring, labor practices, gender analysis, and environment. \n \n83.  Road Sector Reform and Institutional Strengthening.   BPG and NHA give these \nassurances: \n \n(i)  BPG will review CWD's institutional capacity and staffing, and consult with ADB on \nrecommended  measures  and  actions  to  transform  CWD  into  a  modern  road \n                                                 \n33  HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n   ", "22  \nmanagement agency, and other actions as agreed upon  in the policy matrix and \naction plan (Appendix 5).  \n \n(ii)  NHA will continue the reform of its organization, institutional structure, and other \nkey areas in accordance with its policy and institutional reform program (Appendix \n6).  \n \n84.  Road Maintenance.  Assurances on road maintenance are made by NHA and BPG. \n \n(i)  NHA and  BPG will ensure that the improved roads are maintained to design \nstandards and in accordance with sound maintenance practices, that appropriate \nroad maintenance procedures and annual maintenance plans are prepared for \nthe improved national highways and provincial roads, on the basis of modern, \nagreed-upon maintenance standards, traffic volumes, and assessment of needs.  \n \n(ii)  Upon completion of the national highways, NHA will contract out periodic and \nroutine maintenance for these roads to the private sector.  \n \n(iii)  BPG will (a) increase its spending on road maintenance by 5% yearly in real \nterms (base value: PRs.97.8 million  in 2002/03); (b) award three maintenance \ncontracts (covering at least 500 km in total) to the private sector within 24 months \nof loan effectiveness; (c) award at least one performance-based maintenance \ncontract (covering at least 50 km) to the private sector within 24 months of loan \neffectiveness; and (d) conduct a study on road user charges and suitable sources \nand mechanisms for increased funding  of road maintenance, and consult with \nADB on implementing the recommended measures. \n \n85.  Private  Sector  Participation.  The  Borrower  will  cause  CWD  to  contract  out  road \nmaintenance to private sector operators. Such contracts will attain the following percentages of all \nmaintenance contracts awarded  annually: 10% by 31 December 2005, 20% by 31 December \n2006, and 40% by 31 December 2007. Within 4 months of each of the dates specified, CWD will \nconfirm to ADB the actual percentages attained. \n \n86.  Transit  Agreement. Within  6  months  of  the  receipt  of  the  consultants'  report,  the \nGovernment and ADB will hold a joint workshop to review the report and identify areas for action \nby the Government, which may facilitate increased trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan \nthrough the Chamman border crossing. \n \n87.  Cross-Border Facility. Within 3 months of the delivery to MOC of the consultant\u2019s \nrecommendations and plan for the proposed new cross-border facility, the Government will \napprove that proposal; within 24 months  after the Government approves the plan, NHA will \ncomplete construction and installation of all necessary equipment in accordance with the plan; \nwithin 36 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will have started operating the cross-\nborder facility at Chamman. Among other things, the cross-border facility will provide a health \ninformation service that will include disseminating information to prevent HIV/AIDS and other \nsexually transmitted diseases. \n \n88.  Subproject Approval Process and Selection. All subprojects  will comply with ADB \npolicies and guidelines, and satisfy ADB procedures for subproject preparation with respect to \ntechnical,  operational,  economic,  social,  indigenous  people,  resettlement,  and  other \nrequirements. Balochistan will make available sufficient counterpart funding for each subproject. \n   ", "      23 \nA subproject will be eligible for financing under the loan if it satisfies the criteria set forth in \nAppendix 10. \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n1.  The Government, NHA, and BPG will have approved the Planning Commission Proforma I \n(PC-I) for the Project.  \n \nC.  Condition for Loan Disbursement \n2.   No loan proceeds for financing a civil works contract for a national provincial highway or \nrural road will be disbursed until the CSCs for the national highways or the provincial roads, as \nappropriate, have been engaged.   \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n3.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and the proposed TA loan would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of ADB and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the loan of \u00a520,266,370,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Balochistan \nRoad Development Sector Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with interest \nto be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 25 \nyears, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements presented to the Board; and \n \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 701,000 to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the Community Development and Poverty Reduction \ncomponent of the Project, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose  set  forth  in  the  draft  Technical  Assistance  Loan  and  Project  Agreements \npresented to the Board.  \n \n \n \n  Tadao Chino \n  President \n \n28 October 2003 \n ", "2\n4\n   \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n  A\np\n  p\ne\nn\nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets  Monitoring  Assumptions  d\nix\nMechanisms  and Risks   1\nGEBanolhaoalc nhcisetda ne caonndo nmeiicg hgbroowrinthg  aanreda rsed uced poverty in   IRnecdreuacseedd p gorvoesrsty d omestic product  Pa nrodv sintactiiaslt iecsco nomic data   Cinoitmiatpivleems eonf toatrhye irn evceosntmomenicts  and          \n  infrastructure, social services and \nprograms. \nPurposes       \n1.

Overall \n1.  Transport is an important sector in Pakistan, contributing about 10% to the total gross \ndomestic product (GDP). Road transport is the dominant mode of transport, and carries 90% of \nall passenger traffic and 95% of all freight traffic. Road transport services are largely in the \nprivate sector1 and are subject to strong competition. During the 1990s, the overall demand for \nroad transport grew at 7\u20138% per year while the average GDP grew at 4\u20135%. The number of \nregistered motor vehicles is 4.2 million and is growing at 8% annually. Pakistan\u2019s national road \nnetwork extends some 250,000 kilometers (km)? of which 60% is paved? and has grown about \n4.5% annually during the last decade.  \n \n2.  A  total  of  PRs207  billion  was  raised  in  revenues  from  the  road  sector  through  a \ncombination of general revenue taxes and user charges over the 5-year period 1995-2000. \nNational and provincial highway expenditures totaled PRs118 billion over that period. The \nbalance? PRs89 billion (43%)? was contributed to the government\u2019s general revenue. \n \nB.  National Highway System \n3.  Network. The national highway (NH) network comprises about 8,500 km of national \nhighways and motorways,2 and carries 75-80% of Pakistan\u2019s commercial traffic. The main \ndomestic artery is concentrated along the Karachi\u2013Lahore\u2013Peshawar corridor, which is 1,670 \nkm long. It serves 80% of Pakistan\u2019s urban population and carries over 55% of the country\u2019s \nintercity traffic. A detailed condition survey carried out in 2001 indicates that 50% of the NH \nnetwork is in poor to very poor condition.3 Some of the poor sections are located on the main \ninternational arteries (NH5 and NH25), connecting Pakistan with Afghanistan and providing \naccess to ports in southern Pakistan.   \n \n4.  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA).    NHA,  with  responsibility  for  operation, \nmaintenance, and development of the NH system, is an autonomous highway agency with a \nfunctional structure and decentralized implementation through regional offices at provincial \nlevels. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank have provided assistance4 to \nreorganize and commercialize NHA, shifting its focus toward a network operator and service \nprovider role and strengthening NHA\u2019s financial management systems to improve governance. \nNHA has, however, internal capacity constraints, such as limited in-house capability in strategic \nplanning, project and asset management, and network operation. The use of modern road asset \nmanagement and maintenance systems (including HDM-4) for operation and maintenance need \nto be fully institutionalized and integrated in the day-to-day operations.5 Until recently, the four \nprovincial highway departments were responsible for some 90,000 km of roads. Some parts of \nthat network are now being transferred to the district administrations as part of the devolution \nprogram.  \n \n                                                 \n1  About 95% of all road freight transport is carried out by the private sector.  \n2  The National Highway Authority (NHA) under the Ministry of Communications is responsible for the national \nhighway network. \n3  40% good, 11% fair and 49% poor/very poor.  \n4  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the Road Development Sector Program (program loan component). Manila. \n5  Most of these issues are being addressed under a national road project, which is being prepared by the World \nBank. ", " 28 Appendix 3 \n5.  Project Prioritization and Portfolio Management.  In the past NHA suffered from \npoorly justified investments, began too many new projects, and did not pay sufficient attention to \nnetwork conservation. The situation led to the deterioration of road conditions along some of the \nmore heavily trafficked highway sections, caused project delays, increased project costs, and \nreduce the headroom for new high-priority initiatives as well as conservation of the network. \nEncouraged by ADB and the World Bank, NHA has during the last 2 years reprioritized and \nreprogrammed the investment program with more attention and resources for conserving the \nNH network. Thus, the federal Government and NHA have initiated a multiyear PRs35 billion \nNational Highway Improvement Program covering rehabilitation, resurfacing, and improvement \nof  some  2,700  km  of  the  NH  network,  based  on  a  condition  survey  and  a  network-level \nprioritization study. \n \n6.  Vehicle  Overloading.    Vehicle  overloading  is  a  major  impediment  to  sustainable \ndevelopment of the road sector in Pakistan, particularly on the NH network. Surveys by road \nagencies indicate that 88% of all trucks exceed the per-axle limit of 8 tons; 43% exceed the new \nproposed federal load limit of 12 tons per axle. Overloading causes roads to deteriorate rapidly, \nreducing their service life and significantly reducing the economic benefits that should have \nbeen realized during the designed life of the roads.6 Moreover, the high recurrent costs of \nmaintenance and the need for reconstruction erode the limited development resources of the \ncountry.  As  a  result,  there  is  a  great  need  to  strengthen  enforcement  of  rules  against \noverloading vehicles and accelerate the ongoing nationwide axle load program pursued at the \nfederal level by the NHA.7 \n \n7.  Road Maintenance. At NHA, it recognized increasingly that greater emphasis and more \nspending on road maintenance are necessary to preserve the national road infrastructure asset \nbase. A road fund was established in 2001 with World Bank support. NHA has increased its \nspending  on  routine  and  periodic  road  maintenance;  spending  on  routine  maintenance \nincreased from PRs600 million in FY1997/98 to PRs800 in FY2002/03, but further increases are \nnecessary to reduce the backlog of maintenance.  The increase of the road asset base, \nhowever, indicates that NHA should spend at least about PRs3,000 billion to keep the network \nin its present condition. Maintenance is increasingly being contracted out to private civil works \ncontractors.  \n \n8.  Road Safety.  The fatality rate on Pakistan's road network remains among the highest in \nAsia.8  The  causes  are  high  speeds,  lack  of  road  safety  measures,  poor  discipline  and \nenforcement of rules, and poor condition of vehicles. Road safety audits are not conducted \nroutinely for all new and improved roads. The road safety problem is exacerbated by lack of \nawareness and poor knowledge of road safety matters among the general public and the road \nusers. Efforts and coordination at the national and province levels are not concerted, and \nresponsibilities  and  accountability  among  the  institutions  and  provincial  departments  are \nunclear. Extensive efforts in education and training of drivers, coupled with awareness building, \nare required to address the high fatality rate. The Government passed the National Highway \nSafety Ordinance in September 2000, which provided the legal basis for establishing the \nNational  Highway  and  Motorway  Police  (NHMP)  Force  under  the  federal  Ministry  of \n                                                 \n6  Calculations for local conditions show that a truck loaded at 12 tons per axle destroys roads five times as fast as a \ntruck loaded at 8 tons per axle. \n7  The nationwide axle-load program pursued by the NHA includes installing 30 weigh bridges at strategic locations \non the national highway network.  \n8  Pakistan had 18.69 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles in 1992. This was lower than those for India (25.27) and \nBangladesh (85.58), but higher than those for Southeast Asia (5-15 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles) and far above \nthe countries with the lowest number of fatalities, such as the United Kingdom (1.60) and Japan (1.74).

This measure expands the role of the very successful motorway police to the \nnational highway system, in a phased manner.  \n \n9.  Private  Sector  Participation.    NHA  is  pursuing  opportunities  for  private  sector \nparticupation (PSP) in road infrastructure projects. Projects include the Lahore and Karachi \nbypass projects, which are being prepared on build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis. The role of \nthe domestic private sector in road contracting and providing engineering services is fairly well \ndeveloped. NHA needs, however, to step up its efforts to increase PSP. NHA is currently \ndeveloping Lakhpass crossing just outside Quetta in Balochistan on BOT basis. NHA could \nincrease PSP manifold by introducing network management and performance-based contracts \nfor maintenance.   \n \nC.  Balochistan Province \n10.  Institutional Capacity and Constraints. The Communication and Works Department \n(CWD) in Balochistan, which is responsible for roads and buildings, is structured and functions \nas  a  typical  public  works  department.  The  key  issue  at  CWD  is  inadequate  funding  for \nmaintenance and weak institutional capacity in planning and executing maintenance. Thus, \nthere is a great need to build institutional capacity for maintenance and revamp the road asset \nmanagement system. Although a road maintenance unit was established in 1999 with support of \nADB and the Nordic Development Fund, maintenance did not become fully institutionalized and \nintegrated in the day-to-day operations at CWD. Another important but more difficult issue is \nrightsizing of staff. This needs to be addressed with a broader institutional and organizational \nreview of CWD and a move toward a modern road management agency. Moreover, as a \nconsequence of the ongoing devolution program,9 which was formally initiated in August 2001, \nthe functions and allocation of responsibilities between CWD and the 26 district administrations \nneed to be reviewed.  \n \n11.  Road Maintenance. Since 1995, spending on road maintenance in Balochistan has \nremained largely constant; budget allocations for road maintenance10 increased by 4.9% from \nPRs92.3  million  in  FY1998  to  PRs97.8  million  in  FY2002,  while  the  allocations  for  road \ndevelopment (investments) under the annual development grant were around PRs2.121 billion \nin FY2002 and PRs3.502 billion in FY2003. The recent expansion of the road network and the \nincrease  of  the  road  asset  base  indicate  that  further  increases  of  budget  allocations  for \nmaintenance are required to sustain the road network.11 While Balochistan has lower road \ndensity and generally poorer access than other provinces in Pakistan, some road network \nexpansion is still required to connect districts and villages, and thus provide access for the poor \nrural  communities.  It  is  also  important  to  increase  maintenance  spending  and  improve \nmaintenance management and processes on existing roads.  \n \n12.  Road Safety.  Improving road safety is also an important issue in Balochistan. The \nsituation is exacerbated because of weak institutional capacity at CWD and the narrow roads \nand poor conditions. Under the Project, CWD will prepare an action plan to address road safety \nwith preventive and corrective measures including information and awareness campaigns and \neducation and adoption of road safety audits. \n \n13.  Private Sector Participation.  The opportunities for PSP in road infrastructure projects \nare smaller in Balochistan than elsewhere in Pakistan due to remoteness and relatively low \ntraffic volumes.  The role of the domestic private sector in road contracting and providing \n                                                 \n9  Under the devolution program, local governments at distric level have been created. \n10 Road maintenance spending level in Balochistan: FY1998/99? PRs77.3 million. FY1999/2000? PRs47.5 million. \nFY2000/01? PRs77.4 million. FY2001/02? PRs 100.9 million.  \n11 Based on analysis by consultants supporting the road maintenance unit at Communication and Works Department. ", " 30 Appendix 3 \nengineering services is, however, fairly well developed. Both NHA and BPG need, however, to \nstep up efforts to increase PSP in Balochistan. NHA is currently developing Lakhpass crossing \njust outside Quetta in Balochistan on BOT basis. CWD could increase PSP by contracting out \nmaintenance and gradually introducing network management and performance-based contracts \nfor maintenance.   \n ", "Appendix 4      31\nEXTERNAL FINANCING FOR THE ROAD SECTOR\nProject Funding Amount Year\nSource ($ million)\nFarm-to-Market Roads Project ADB 38.00 1986\nSecond Farm to Market Roads Project ADB 113.00 1990\nFlood Damage Restoration Project ADB 78.00 1993\nSukkur Bridge Project ADB 45.00 1994\nRural Access Roads Project ADB 123.00 1996\nRoad Sector Development Program ADB 200.00 2001\nPunjab Road Development Sector Project ADB 150.00 2002\nSubtotal 747.00\nLocomotive Manufacturing Factory JBIC 81.00 1984\nRailway Transportation Reinforcement (II) JBIC 123.00 1985\nIndus Highways - Phase I JBIC 71.00 1989\nIndus Highways - Phase II JBIC 173.00 1991\nTrack Circuit at 94 Mainline Station JBIC 27.00 1992\nRural Roads Construction JBIC 95.00 1993\nNew Locomotive Production   JBIC 50.00 1993\nIndus Highways - Phase IIB JBIC 152.00 1993\nDiesel Electric Locomotive Rehabilitation JBIC 50.00 1993\nKohat Tunnel Construction (I) JBIC 45.00 1994\nDiesel Locomotive Production II JBIC 71.00 1996\nDiesel Electric Locomotive Rehabilitation JBIC 56.00 1996\nSurvey Vessel Modernization JBIC 20.00 1996\nKohat Tunnel Construction (II) JBIC 34.00 2001\nSubtotal 1,048.00\nFirst Highway Project WB 17.00 1964\nThird Highway Project WB 50.00 1980\nFourth Highway Project WB 152.00 1987\nTransport Sector Project WB 184.00 1991\nKarachi Port Modernization WB 91.40 1992\nTrade and Transport Facilitation WB 3.00 2001\nSubtotal 497.40\nTotal 2,292.40\nADB = Asian Development Bank, JBIC = Japan Bank for International Cooperation, WB = World Bank.\nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates.", " \n3\n2\n \nPROVINCIAL POLICY MATRIX AND ACTION PLAN \nA\n  p\np\nMain Areas of  Objective  Key Issues and Actions Taken   Next Step of Reform and Actions   Compliance  e\nn\nReform  Monitoring  d\nix\nInstitutional  Transform the  The organization of the CWD went  Continue steps to transform CWD so it becomes  Prior to approval of   5\n \nReform with New  organizational  through several changes recently.

The selection of subprojects by the Balochistan provincial government (BPG) will be \nsubject to Asian Development Bank (ADB) approval. The criteria for selection and the \napproval process are outlined in this appendix. \n \nA.  Subproject Selection Criteria \n2.  Subprojects must meet the following criteria. \n(i)  Provincial road master plan.  The subproject will be part of the provincial \nroad master plan. \n(ii)  Poverty targeting. The subproject will have been prioritized based on the \ndistrict  development  ranking  used  by  the  Government  for  determining \nallocation of its development expenditures.  \n(iii)  Technical  feasibility.  The  subproject  will  be  technically  feasible  and  a \ndetailed report prepared. \n(iv)  Economic feasibility. Economic analysis of the subproject will be prepared in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and \nthe estimated economic internal rate of return will be at least 12%. \n(v)  Social assessment and analysis. The subproject will be socially sound, will \nminimize the need for land acquisition, and will include measures to mitigate \nany social impacts. An initial social assessment (ISA) for the subproject will \nhave been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s relevant guidelines.  \n(vi)  Resettlement. The proposed subproject road will not entail any involuntary \nresettlement or land acquisition. Impact on any affected persons through land \nacquisition or description of livelihood will be minimal. If a subproject involves \nland acquisition or involuntary resettlement, a full resettlement plan (if the \nnumber of affected persons is 200 or more) or a short one (if fewer than 200 \npersons  are  affected)  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  have  been  prepared  in \naccordance with the resettlement framework agreed upon by the Government \nand  ADB  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Involuntary \nResettlement. \n(vii)  Indigenous people. If any indigenous people, such as tribes or settlers, as \nper ADB\u2019s definition, are likely to be affected significantly by a subproject, an \nindigenous people\u2019s plan should be prepared in accordance with ADB's Policy \non Indigenous People. \n(viii)  Environmental considerations. Each proposed subproject road will have \nbeen screened for environmental impacts in compliance with the requirements \nof the Government and the ADB,1 and should not cause any major adverse \nimpact on the environment. ADB will have received and reviewed the initial \nenvironmental  examination,  if  any,  prepared  for  the  proposed  road.  All \nnecessary  approvals  and  clearances  will  have  been  obtained  for  the \nsubproject from the federal and provincial governments and related agencies. \n(ix)  Counterpart funding. BPG will ensure that sufficient counterpart funding is \nallocated to implement the subproject on time and efficiently in accordance \nwith the overall implementation schedule. \n(x)  Government  approvals.

Background \n1.  Balochistan is a relatively poor province and economic growth is constrained by a road \nnetwork suffering from lack of development and maintenance. It is the largest of Pakistan\u2019s \nprovinces,  but  it  has  isolated  settlements  and  is  generally  detached  from  the  country\u2019s \nmainstream  political  and  economic  activities.  The  Project  has  been  designed  to  support \nsustainable  pro-poor  growth,  reduce  poverty,  promote  subregional  cooperation,  and  be \nenvironmentally and socially responsible. The Project is expected to contribute significantly to \npoverty reduction in the medium term by increasing literacy level, reducing transport costs, \nreducing  intradistrict  travel  times,  increasing  access  to  social  services,  and  reducing  the \nvulnerability of the population, particularly of women. According to surveys conducted as part of \nproject  preparation,  people  along  the  roads  expect  the  roads  to  generate  employment \nopportunities for them and increase their access to social services like health and education. \nSimilarly poor people would be able to reach police stations and banks more easily. The Project \nwill help people transport their goods to market, reduce transport costs, increase food security, \nand increase mobility of the population.  \n \n2.  Experience elsewhere has shown that the potential benefits to the poor are likely to be \nachieved quickly. The effects are more likely to be sustained if the infrastructure project is \naugmented  with  specific  support  and  assistance  targeted  at  the  poor,  such  as  direct \ninvolvement in road construction and construction of ancillary facilities (footpaths, drainage), or \nindirect involvement through activities that enable the community to capitalize on the new \nopportunities. The latter might include drilling wells to enable cash crops to be planted or \nproviding transport to increase access to health and education. In both cases the emphasis is \non providing training and skills to help the poor help themselves. \n \nB.  Objectives \n3.  The technical assistance (TA) will (i) develop and implement community initiatives that \nleverage off the Project in a manner that increases its positive impact on the poor, and in \nparticular, on women; (ii) support intitiatives aimed at promoting greater awareness of social, \nhealth and safety issues that may emerge from the Project; and (iii) establish a scheme to \nmeasure and monitor the poverty impact of roads. \n \nC.  Major Activities and Tasks  \n4.  The TA involves three major activities, which may overlap and complement each other. \n \n5.  Community Infrastructure and Empowerment Fund. Grants of up to the equivalent of \n$25,000 each in support of poverty alleviation in road-side communities along roads supported \nunder BRDSP will be made on a competitive basis to selected non-governmental organizations \nand other community groups approved by ADB.  \n \n6.  Social Protection and Education Fund.   Grants up to the equivalent of $10,000 each \nin support of programs aimed  at raising community awareness of social, health and safety \nissues such as prevention of HIV/AIDS, trafficking of women and children, and vehicular traffic \naccident will be made on a competitive basis to selected non-governmental organization and \nother community groups approved by ADB. \n \n7.  Monitoring and Measuring Social and Poverty Impacts.  \n(i)  Identify indicators for measuring the social impact of the project roads and \nassociated programs.  ", "44  Appendix 13 \n(ii)  Undertake a benchmark study to determine the current values of the measures, \nidentify the current use of the road, and describe the socioeconomic profile of \nusers and nonusers.  \n(iii)  Training the Project management unit/Project Engineering Cell in the CWD to \nidentify  and  monitor  social  impacts,  and  establish  an  ongoing  monitoring \nprogram.  \n(iv)  Prepare a baseline report, a project completion report, and a review report 2 \nyears after physical project completion.  \n(v)  Carry out a socioeconomic and poverty impact study on past road projects. \n8.  Cost and Financing. The TA will be financed from the Special Funds resources of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). The total cost is estimated at $1.25 million comprising $0.22 \nmillion in foreign exchange and $1.03 million in local currency. The TA loan of $1.0 million will \nfinance the total foreign cost and $0.78 million of the local cost. The Balochistan provincial \ngovernment (BPG) will finance the remainder of the local costs. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n9.  Executing and Implementing Agencies.  CWD will be the Executing Agency. The \nestablished project management unit (PMU) at CWD will be the Implementing Agency, headed \nby the project director. Nongovenment organizations (NGOs) will be appointed to undertake the \nTA loan activities. The TA is planned to begin by January 2004 and will be implemented over \nsix years. \n \n10.  CWD will in consultation with ADB, establish a Community Support Project Committee \n(the Committee) consisting of no less than seven members. At least four members of the \nCommittee shall be drawn from non-governmental organizations, academia or the media. At \nleast three members of the Committee shall be women. This committee will be entrusted to \ndevelop  and  approve  detailed  criteria  and  procedures  for  solicitation  and  selection  of \napplications for grant awards under the (i) Community Infrastructure and Empowerment Fund \nand  (ii)  Social  Protection  and  Education  Fund.  In  setting  criteria  for  grant  selection,  the \nCommittee shall give utmost importance to enhancing livelihood opportunities  of the poor, \nparticularly women, and in addressing other basic needs concerns such as clean water supply \nand nutrition. \n \n11.  Procurement of Goods and Services. The PMU will initiate the hiring of consultants. \nEach consultant or consulting team will prepare an inception report for its subcomponent within \n2 weeks of the start of services, providing a time-bound work program and a schedule of \nprogress reports. For each subcomponent, a draft final report will be submitted and a final \nreport finalized after comments of the Government and ADB have been incorporated. \n \n12.  Training, Workshops, and Seminars. Community participation is the essence of the \nTA. Workshops will be held on each road to introduce the Project and to provide a means of \ncommunicating concepts and reporting progress. The TA will train CWD and the community \ngroups to ensure effective transfer of knowledge. \n \n13.  Accounts and Audits. CWD will establish separate project accounts for expenditures \nunder the TA loan, with separate recording of transactions. CWD will appoint an independent \nauditor  acceptable  to  ADB  to  routinely  monitor  and  annually  evaluate  and  document  the \nexecution of community initiatives supported under the Project. Such auditors will be replaced \nevery two years. \n ", "  Appendix 14  4 5\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANT FOR  \n \nCROSS-BORDER DEVELOPMENT  \n \nA.  Objective \n1.  The Technical Assistance (TA) will develop a concept, prepare a plan, and complete a \npackage, including outline design and specifications, for a pilot cross-border facility to be established \nand operated at the Chamman border point. The pilot cross-border facility will take cognizance of the \nenvironment and opportunities for coordinated operation of immigration, customs, vehicle inspections, \nand  health  and  other  phytosanitary  inspections.  The  facility  must  be  administratively  least \ncumbersome, client-friendly, and transparent in all processes while fully complying with applicable \ngovernment policies, regulations, and interests.  \n \nB.  Scope and Outline Terms of Reference  \n2.  The TA will entail the following major tasks. \n \n(i)  Briefly review all significant recent (last 5 years) assessments of trade facilitation \narrangements (including port clearance and storage fees and other levies) at ports and \nborder crossings conducted by the Government of Pakistan or internal or external \nagencies, ascertain the validity of such assessments, and analyze why any proposals, \nif any, have not been implemented. \n(ii)  Review the major legal, financial, and administrative issues affecting cross-border \ntransit and trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and identify any major gaps and \nrequired changes in the 1965 Transit Agreement to develop a comprehensive transit \nagreement that considers the interests and concerns of both governments and the \ncompetitive situation.   \n(iii)  Identify, review and assess the key issues on transit of goods and vehicles carrying \nsuch goods. The review will include, but be will not be limited to (a) regulation of \nvehicle  movement  across  the  borders;  (b)  harmonization  of  vehicle  standards  on \ndimensions,  weights,  axle  loads,  emissions,  etc.;  (c)  harmonization  and  cross-\nacceptability of roadworthiness inspection criteria; (d) development of a cross-border \ninsurance regime; and (e) introduction of a customs temporary vehicle importation \nregime (i.e., waiver of import duties without posting any guarantee).  \n(iv)  Evaluate the  \u201cone-stop\u201d pilot trade facilitation arrangements at Qasim Port and Karachi \nPort and any border crossings where similar efforts may be underway, and delineate \nthe primary causes of the successes and failures of such efforts. In addition, assess \nfurther  potential  for  document  alignment  to  make  it  responsive  to  the  common \nrequirements  of  buyers,  sellers,  banks,  insurers,  forwarders,  port  and  customs \nauthorities and any others that may be involved in the transit process.  \n(v)  Map every required step for landing, unloading, warehousing, clearing and reloading \ngoods at Karachi and Qasim ports and Chamman/Spin Boldak border crossing and \nanalyze costs for each step in time and money (including any \u201cfacilitation fees\u201d that \nmay be charged by unauthorized agents); and make a detailed analysis of how each \nstep could be improved, streamlined, rationalized, consolidated, or eliminated to gain \nefficiency.  \n(vi)  Compare the mapped existing processes with  the best practices in the region and \nelsewhere and detail what will be required to make the practices in Pakistan conform to \nbest practices in the region and to adapt to the local environment.  \n(vii)  To  test  the  validity  and  applicability  of  the  results  of  the  above  analysis,  hold \nworkshops and other consultations with (a) the established trade facilitation group \n ", "46 Appendix 14 \nmanaged by the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) and its members from the public and \nprivate sector; (b) users of such cross-border facilities, including operators of vehicles \nand owners of goods being shipped; and (c) current administrators and other operators \nof cross-border facilities.  \n(viii)  Develop a plan of operations for the pilot cross-border facility including, but not limited \nto, preparation of rationalized  procedures for compliance with all border clearance \nrequirements (e.g., single-form processing) and staffing needs and training (by different \nidentified categories of skills).  \n(ix)  Coordinate closely and consult, as necessary, with government ministries and other \nagencies to develop a consensus on the cross-border concept, and plan and proposed \nfacility?including systems and equipment?and the management responsibility for the \npilot  cross-border  facility  and  how  management  oversight  over  representatives  of \nmultiple government ministries and agencies could be effected.   \n(x)  Identify all needs for the cross-border facility and any related or additional facilities \n(including  any  warehousing,  truck  parking  sheds,  cargo  inspection  sheds,  weigh \nbridges, rest facilities, etc.), equipment (including cargo scanning and sniffer dogs, \ntelephone/Internet communications, firefighting equipment, etc.), and training to fully \noperate the pilot facility.  \n(xi)  Identify other transit operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan with which communication \nlinks  would  be  useful  for  effective  operation  of  the  pilot  cross-border  facility  and \ndevelopment  of  a  recommendation  on  how  a  communication  network  could  be \nestablished among such transit operations.  \n(xii)  Prepare guidelines for recommended organizational structures indicating number and \ntype of personnel required.  \n(xiii)  Identify  the  appropriate  roles  for  the  private  and  public  sectors  and  investment \nopportunities.  \n(xiv)  Prepare a manual of recommended procedures and available resources to improve \ncross-border operations and hold training workshops with all relevant staff working at \nthe Chaman. \n(xv)  Prepare  (a)  a  detailed  concept  plan,  (b)  a  comprehensive  investment  package \n(including but not limited to a master plan, outline design, equipment and systems, and \nspecifications for the new cross-border facility) for external and private sector financing, \n(c) a plan for a recommended organizational setup, (d) an operations plan, and (e) a \ntraining package.  \n(xvi)  Prepare preliminary cost estimates for the recommended pilot cross-border facility.  \n(xvii)  Analyze  emerging  social  and  environmental  governance  issues  that  stem  from \nincreased trade and transit between Pakistan and Afghanistan and their likely costs \nand  other  consequences.

The Balochistan Road Development Sector Project will involve improving some 1,400 kilometers \n(km) of selected national provincial and rural access roads. The economic analysis examined the \nexpected contribution of the Project to the province of Balochistan. The two national highway sections \nand the six core roads1 were subjected to detailed economic evaluation. Noncore roads will be subjected \nto a similar analysis  for their inclusion in later stages of the Project. The Highway Development and \nManagement Model of the World Bank (HDM-4) was used to analyze for direct savings  in transport \ncosts. Value added from ensuring new industries, employment, and sub-regional transport due to better \ntransport links are not quantified. The main assumptions about maintenance and improvement strategies  \nwith and without the Project are discussed in paras. 2-4. \n \n2.  For the already paved  national highways, the  without project case is  the situation where the \nquality of service provided by the existing roads is maintained at a reasonable level. The international \nroughness index (IRI) is allowed to deteriorate only until level IRI 10.  At that point, periodic maintenance \nworks are carried out to improve the condition to IRI 6. Routine maintenance activities  that were \nconsidered use prevailing standards of the National Highway Authority: nominal patching of potholes, \ncrack sealing by bituminous seal coat, grass cutting, grading of shoulders as well as cleaning of culverts \nand ditches, and refurbishing of sign posts. The maintenance strategy is assumed to remain constant for \nthe 20-year evaluation period.  \n \n3.  For provincial highways, the without project case is  the situation where the quality  of service \nprovided by the existing roads is maintained at a reasonable level. IRI is allowed to deteriorate only until \nlevel IRI 10. At that point, periodic maintenance works are carried out to improve the condition to IRI 6. \nRoutine maintenance activities and the overall maintenance strategy will be the same as in para. 2. For \nexisting  gravel/earth  tracks,  the  roughness  level  of  which  is  beyond  measurement,  only  routine \nmaintenance  is  provided.  In  recognition  of  the  prevailing  maintenance  standards  of  Balochistan's \nCommunication and Works Department, roughness levels are allowed to deteriorate up to the maximum \nvalue provided by HDM for such roads.  \n \n4.  For the with project case, the two surface treatments were asphalt concrete (AC) and triple \nsurface treatment (TST). Periodic maintenance based on road condition in terms of roughness level was \nassumed. Initial treatment will give IRI levels of 2.5 with AC and 4 with TST. For AC roads the \nmaintenance strategy assumes that whenever IRI exceeds 6, an overlay of   50 millimeters (mm)  for \nNational highways or 25 mm for Provincial roads will be added with AC to lower IRI back to 2.5. For TST \nroads, the maintenance strategy assumes that whenever IRI exceeds 8, a 25 mm overlay will be added \nwith TST to  lower IRI back to 4.  It is assumed that, after improvement, routine maintenance will be \ncarried out: complete patching of potholes, regular ditch cleaning, refurbishing any safety measures \ndisturbed, and grading of shoulders at regular intervals, especially after the monsoon. \n \nB.  Road Condition and Traffic \n \n5.  Road Condition. The condition of existing paved roads was investigated by topographic survey, \npavement survey, roughness survey, and pit investigations. The results are summarized in Table A15.1.  \nThe of unpaved roads were visually inspected by the expert engineering staff. \n                                                 \n1  The core roads were selected from a prescreened list of roads meeting the 12% minimum economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) criterion of the Asian Development Bank.

Road Improvement and Maintenance Costs.  Improvement costs were established for each \nroad separately on the basis of estimated quantities of work using the recently completed Rural Access \nRoad Project in Balochistan.  For national highways, old cost estimates of similar constructions were \nupdated using current national highway rates. The costs based on the unit rates for various maintenance \noperations are in Table A15.6. \n \nTable A15.6: Unit Maintenance and Operations Costs  \n(PRs)  \nOperation  Financial  Economic  Unit \ncost  cost \nPatching  156  133  m2 \nReseal  28  24  m2 \nSurface dress TST  150  128  m2 \nOverlay, 50mm   300  255  m2 \nShoulder edge Repair  40  34  m2 \nRoutine Maintenance  70,000  59,500  per km \nTST= triple surface treatment. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n11.  The above financial costs, inclusive of taxes and duties, are converted into economic cost using \nthe standard conversion factor of 0.9 as adopted in  aq similar  Asian Development Bank project in ", "5 2  Appendix 15 \nPakistan. It was assumed that the project duration was 2 years and/or 1 year for small roads, with 50% of \nthe works to be carried out in year 1 and 50% in year 2 or 100% of the works completed in 1 year.  \n \nD.  Benefits \n \n12.  The main quantifiable benefits of the investment are (i) the savings in Vehicle Operating Costs \n(VOCs) for existing traffic; and (ii) VOC savings to diverted traffic where applicable. A minor component \nwill be savings in periodic maintenance cost to be incurred by the Government. The savings in VOC are \ndue  to  better  road  surface  conditions.  As  access  to  markets,  which  reflects  agricultural  benefits, \nimproves, more economic activities are expected to result in generated traffic. However generated traffic \nof goods was ignored considering the water constraint on agricultural production, except for the Zhob \nKhajuri road, where current traffic is negligible and traffic levels have been predicted from adjacent land \nuse data and land use patterns. The benefits to generated traffic are assumed to be half the rate for \nnormal traffic.2 The value of time used was 80% of the average wage for work journeys and 20% of the \naverage wage for nonwork journeys.  \n \nE.  Results of Economic Evaluation and Sensitivity Analysis \n13.  Economic Evaluation. Two improvement strategies, surface dressing with TST and AC  was \nevaluated. For national highways, both AC and TST produced acceptable  economic internal rate of \nreturns (EIRRs) and can stand the worse case as in the sensitivity analysis. For the provincial highways \nand rural roads, both AC and TST proved economically acceptable except for  the Khurkhera\u2013Kanraj \nsection that will only meet 12% criterion only by using TST. Based on the preceding analysis, AC and \nTST can be considered for national highways and core rural access and provincial roads, and TST is the \npreferred treatment for Khurkhera - Kanraj . \n \n14.  Sensitivity Analysis. Sensitivity analysis with TST was tested. Assumptions that would affect the \noutcome are listed in Table A15.7 and Table A15.8 along with a likely range of values. The analysis \nshows that all proposed roads tested still meet the 12% target with changes in the key assumptions over \na significant range. Table A15.9 showed that the results are most sensitive to the assumed VOCs and \ncapital costs. Respectively, a 20% reduction in VOC or an increase in capital costs of 17% is required for \nsome of the core roads to be nonviable. While events of this magnitude are possible, the majority of the \ncore roads require much larger changes, so the likelihood that the Project as a whole will prove \nnonviable is small. An extension in construction time by 1 year (delaying some costs and all the benefits) \nis equivalent to a 5% reduction in cost and a 12% reduction in benefits. \n \nTable A15.7: Summary of EIRRs with Sensitivity Analysis for National Highways \n \nRoad Section  Strategy I  Strategy II  20%  50%  20%  Reduction  Extension of \n  (AC)  (TST)  Reduction  Reduction  Increase  in Growth  Construction \nin VOC   in Value of  in Capital  from 5%  to  Time by 1 \nTime  Cost  3%  Year \nNational Highways                 \nQuetta \u2013 Kalat   40.4  46.5  34.3  38.8  35.3  30.9  36.0 \nQuetta \u2013 Chamman   33.7  40.6  28.5  32.6  29.4  37.8  28.4 \nSource:  Consultants' report. \nAC = asphalt concrete, TST = triple surface treatment, VOC = vehicle operation cost \n                                                 \n2  This is the \u201crule of a half\u201d normally used for estimating benefits to generated traffic.

Distribution Analysis \n15.  Distribution analysis  distributed all economic net benefits among the following categories of \nstakeholders:  (i)  local  passengers,  (ii) through travelers, (iii) freight users, (iv) vehicle owners, (v) \nunskilled labor, and (vi) Government/economy. In the case of Pakistan, both the passenger and freight \ntransport markets are highly competitive.  The proportion of the road user benefits that will be passed on \nto users was estimated to range from 70% for rural access roads to 90% for national highways. The \nmajority of the vehicles are privately owned. For the Project\u2019s capital expenditure and maintenance cost \non local labor, SWRF of 0.7 was assumed.   \n \n16.  The summarized results of the distribution analysis are for national and provincial highways, and \nrural access roads.3   \n                                                 \n3 The benefits do not include any estimate of the likely  benefits of through traffic between Afghanistan and CAR and the \nPakistan ports. ", "5 4  Appendix 15 \nG.  Poverty Impact \n17.  For the poverty impact analysis, assumptions were made for each road about the proportion of \nthe poor in each stakeholder group. The incidence of poverty is very high in this region of Pakistan. \nBased on origin-destination surveys undertaken at 14 locations across Balochistan? where responses \nwere correlated with income data obtained from the social survey? the distribution of  the poor was \ndeveloped for each road. The social survey revealed a high incidence of vehicle ownership amongst \npeople below the poverty level.4 Overall 20% of vehicle owners using the road were assumed to be poor \n(mostly motorcycle owners); 100% of unskilled workers  were assumed to be poor, whereas skilled \nworkers were assumed to be non-poor. Overall, the poverty impact ratio (PIR) is 0.46, higher than the \n12.2% of the poor\u2019s share of national income or the head count poverty ratio of about 35% in the country. \nThe value of the PIR is relatively insensitive to changes in the total benefits or costs.5 The PIR is \nsensitive to the assumptions on the distribution of the poor among users. However, a 50% reduction in \nthe proportion of the poor among local passengers would be needed to bring the ratio below 35%. \n \n18.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \nSector Identified as a National Priority in  Sector Identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Analysis? Yes  Country Poverty Partnership Agreement? Yes \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan.  Poverty in Pakistan \nhas historically been higher in rural than in urban areas. Poverty rose more sharply in the rural \nareas in the 1990s, and in FY1999 the incidence of rural poverty (36.3%) was significantly \nhigher than that of urban poverty (22.6%). During the 1990s, income distribution also worsened \nin rural areas, but improved slightly in urban areas. The increase in poverty is attributed mainly \nto declining economic growth, lack of social safety nets, persistence of severe macroeconomic \nimbalances, reduced flow of remittances from out-of-country Pakistani workers, and poor \ngovernance.  \n \nPoverty intervention is a critical theme of the Project. The direct and indirect potential for \nreducing poverty through road improvement will be realized through (i) increased access to \nmarkets, (ii) improved transportation of goods between areas of surplus and areas of deficit, \n(iii) reduced transport costs (potentially reduced cost of freight and goods as well as passenger \nfares), (iv) increased food security, and (v) increased employment opportunities. Improved \ntransportation will improve the distribution of social services to the villages along the project \nroads. Local medical clinics and educational facilities will receive better support. Furthermore, \nroad construction will create higher levels of income from agriculture and crop production; a \ndemand for agricultural labor, wage rates, and wage income; and income from business and \nindustries. \n \nThe Project will generate employment for people along the route. Unskilled laborers will be \nemployed directly in road construction and maintenance and indirectly by providing material \nand services to the construction and maintenance activities.  \n \nMore important are  the long-term impacts of the Project.  These are narrowing the gap of \nintradistrict disparities and providing the poor, unemployed youth, and women with better \naccess to services and economic opportunities.   \nB.  Poverty Analysis          Proposed Classification: PI \n \nBased on the official poverty line set by the Government, 55% of the total population in the \nproject area live below the poverty line (i.e., per capita income of less than PRs650 per month).  \nIn the latest report of the Social Policy and Development Center  (SPDC), the 26 districts in \nBalochistan, Quetta, and Musa Khel rank as the least developed and most deprived.  \n \nA survey of the 53 proposed roads in 22 districts shows that (i) 55% of the population live \nbelow the poverty line, (ii) the education level in the districts is low (only 51% of males and \n81% of females have primary education), (iii) 45% of the population are landless, and 58% do \nnot own any land to cultivate.  \n \nDuring group interviews, perceptions of the Project were elicited from the local communities.  \nThe major findings are that the Project will (i) be beneficial as it will generate employment \nopportunities  for  the  people,  (ii)  improve  access  to  social  services  such  as  health  and \neducation, (iii) reduce transportation costs, (iv) improve their income as they can easily bring \ntheir goods to markets, (v) increase food security, and (vi) increase mobility of the population.  \nThe communities expect the Project to make a positive impact on their lives by raising the \nstandard of living and reducing poverty in the province. \n \nPoverty reduction will be monitored during and after construction to assess the impact of the \nProject on the poor.

Background \n1.  The Balochistan Road Development Sector Project aims at widening and improving a total \nof 19 roads with an aggregate length of approximately 1,100 kilometers in Balochistan Province, \nPakistan. The project roads are of three types: (i) national highways, (ii) provincial highways, \nand (iii) rural access roads. They include two national highway sections, namely Quetta\u2013Kalat \nRoad  (N25,  130  km)  and  Quetta\u2013Chamman Road (N25, 117 km) and six selected \"core\" \nprovincial roads, comprising three provincial highways, namely:  Kach\u2013Shahrag\u2013Harnai Road \n(95 km), Zhob\u2013Mir Ali Khail\u2013Khajuri Kach Road (101 km), and Nag\u2013Punjgur Road (85 km); and, \nthree rural access roads, namely: Gulistan\u2013Sagi Bazar\u2013Kandel Road (13 km), Dera Allahyar\u2013\nHairdin Road (40 km), and Khurkhera\u2013Kanraj Road (24 km).  \n \n2.  The Balochistan provincial government (BPG) selected the core provincial roads from \nroads prioritized by the project preparatory technical assistance consultants for (i) a geographic \nspread over different agro-ecological zones and major tribes (Pashtoon and Baloch) of the \nprovince; (ii) minimal adverse resettlement impact on the adjacent populations; (iii) poverty \nreduction; (iv) the likelihood of positive socioeconomic impacts on  the province\u2019s population, \nparticularly  the  poor  and  other  vulnerable  groups;  (v)  economic  viability;  (vi)  intradistrict \nconnectivity with markets and towns; and (vii) interdistrict, interprovincial, and international \nconnectivity. The same selection criteria will serve largely as guiding principles for the remaining \nnon-core roads under this sector Project.  \n \n3.  The National Highway Authority (NHA) and the Communications and Works Department \n(CWD) will be the Executing Agencies (EAs) for their respective roads. Each EA will establish a \nProject Directorate in Quetta, which will have a Road Environment and Social Assessment Cell \n(RESAC) headed by a deputy director, an executive engineer-level officer to ensure proper \nplanning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  all  land  acquisition  and  resettlement-related \nactivities. For noncore roads, each RESAC will conduct proper impact assessment, screen for \npossible land acquisition and resettlement effects and prepare a subproject Resettlement Plan \n(RP), full or short as required, for review and approval by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nbefore a civil works contract is issued.   \n \n4.  This RP was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and \nADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement. The RP covers all eight core roads projects and presents \nthe scope of land acquisition and resettlement, remedial measures for mitigating adverse \nimpacts, and how and when these measures will be implemented. It is based on the census and \nsocioeconomic assessment of the potentially affected persons (APs). Thus, this RP will serve as \na model for RP preparation for other non-core subprojects. The preparation of an indigenous \npeoples  development  plan  (IPDP),  following  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples,  is  not \nrequired for this Project because the two ethnic groups (Baloches and Pathans) identified during \nthe study are all integrated into the mainstream life of the province.  \n \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n5.  The proposed improvements will be carried out largely within the existing right-of-way \n(ROW) of the project roads. But the proposed widening will require additional 2- to 3- meter-\nwide strips of land on either side of most project roads. Over 90% of the lengths of the selected \ncore project roads pass through nonproductive barren lands, which are known as statelands. \nFor the remaining 5-10% lengths of the roads, the lands are owned by individuals who utilize \nthem  beneficially,  i.e.,  for  agricultural  purposes  in  open  areas  and  for  residential and/or \ncommercial purposes in built-up areas. These lands will be acquired as per provisions and rules ", "58 Appendix 17   \nlaid  down  in  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  1894  (LAA,  amended)  in  conjunction  with  ADB\u2019s \nresettlement policy and guidelines.  \n \n6.  An estimated area of 42 hectares (ha) will need to be acquired for the two national \nhighways  (24  ha)  and  the  six  core  project  roads  (18  ha).  These  are  all  privately  owned \nproductive and/or built-up areas, excluding the nonproductive tribal commons or statelands. The \nproductive lands have mostly fruit orchards. Land acquisition will also affect an estimated 1,750 \ntrees? 1,150 are fruit trees and 600 are wood trees (timber/firewood).   As a result of additional \nland  acquisition  for  the  two  national  highways  and  six  core  provincial  project  roads,  an \nestimated 344 people will be affected: 274 landowners and 70 tenants. Some realignments and \nbypasses may be necessary to minimize or avoid displacement in congested built-up areas and \nurban centers, which may be identified and decided upon later when the design is finalized. The \nrealignments and bypasses (if any) will require the acquisition of additional landstrips as new \nROW.  New  ROW  will  be  selected  carefully  to  minimize  adverse  resettlement  and \nsocioeconomic impacts. A complete inventory and valuation of the private lands to be acquired \nand the structures and other assets affected will be carried out and this RP will be revised \naccordingly. \n \n7.  A full census of all potentially affected households, small business enterprises (SBEs) \nand community/cultural structures along the project corridor of impact (the proposed formation \nwidth) was conducted on the eight selected roads in April-May 2003. The Project will partly \naffect 143 structures/assets, of which 80 are shops/SBEs, 39 are residential houses, 5 are \ncultural/community structures (mosques, etc.), 2 are enclosed fruit orchards, and the remaining \n17 are other structures/asset, including 10 abandoned dilapidated structures. The Project will \nassist all structure owners to relocate on the available ROW land (out of the formation widths) \nso that APs can reestablish their businesses and restore their incomes with least disruption. \n \n8.  Land acquisition and removal of built-up structures affect 358 people on the provincial \ncore project roads and the two national highways (247 km). \n \nC.  Objectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n9.  In Pakistan, the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 (as amended) is the core legal tool the \nGovernment uses to acquire private lands for a public purpose. Under the provisions of the act, \ncash compensation for land is paid at the market rate to affected landowners, and for the \naffected crops only to registered tenants. The legal framework does not cover illegal occupants, \nsquatters,  and  encroachers.  In  many  project-specific  cases,  however,  the  governments  of \nPakistan and the other provinces (Sindh, Punjab and North West Frontier Province) have \nassisted project-affected persons even without any legal titles.  \n \n10.  Pakistan has no specific policy on resettlement. In the absence of a formal policy to \nassist nontitled persons, a project-specific set of resettlement principles consistent with ADB \npolicy requirements was adopted in this Project.  As a result, APs, owners and tenants of \nacquired lands and affected structures (SBEs, houses, etc.), are entitled to a combination of \ncompensation  measures  and  resettlement  assistance,  depending  on  the  nature  of  their \nownership rights to lost/affected assets and scope of the impact, including social and economic \nvulnerability of the APs. In general terms, the APs will be compensated for the loss of lands and \nstructures/assets,  and  assisted  to  restore  their  SBEs,  livelihoods,  and  cultural/community \nstructures/assets.

Consultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress  \n11.  Consultations.    The  Project  has  strong  support  and  positive  public  response  as \nextensive community awareness and consultation programs among the affected/beneficiary \ncommunities were carried out during the field surveys. A total of 97 group interviews (men and \nwomen groups) were conducted along the core project roads. During project implementation, \nRESAC, assisted by the local nongovernment organization (NGO) and a resettlement specialist \nfrom the construction supervision consultants, will continue to prepare and implement the \ninformation and community consultation program in the project areas. \n ", "60 Appendix 17   \n12.  Disclosure of the RP.  When the project design is finalized and the RP is subsequently \nrevised,  the  Project  will  publish  a  project  grief  on  its  scope  and  objectives,  including \nresettlement entitlements for APs, in both English and Urdu languages and distribute the same \namong  the  roadside  communities,  particularly  the  APs,  by  December  2003,  at  the  latest. \nGenerally, All literate people understand Urdu language. If necessary, however, the brochure \nwill also be translated into Pashto, Brahvi, and Balochi languages. In addition, RESAC and the \nlocal NGO will hold discussion sessions with groups of APs to further explain and, if necessary, \nrefine/improve the project brief. \n \n13.  Grievances Redress Committee.  Provisions of LAA-1894 enable aggrieved APs to \npresent their cases to the Land Acquisition Collector\u2019 office or to a court of law to have their \ngrievances redressed and disputes resolved.  The Project will establish a grievance redress \ncommittee  (GRC),  with  representatives  from  the  local  government  (union  council, \nsubdistrict/District nazims), local NGOs/CBOs, respective EAs (NHA and CWD) and APs. The \nGRC aims to provide a mechanism to mediate conflict and cut down on lengthy litigation, which \noften delays infrastructure projects.   \n \n14.  Resettlement Advisory Committee. The resettlement advisory committee (RAC) will \nencourage local participation, ensure full transparency and accountability for the resettlement \nprogram and people\u2019s entitlements, and safeguard the rights of the most vulnerable peoples \naffected by the Project. The RAC will comprise representatives from the APs, NGO, CWD, and \nother stakeholders. Women will be represented on the RAC. The RAC will provide coordinating \nnodes for land acquisition and compensation, and relocation, and resettlement, and will assist \nthe APs in all possible ways to minimize disruption and hardship during relocation.  \n \nE.  Income Restoration Strategy \n15.  The entitlement matrix (Table A17.1) aims to compensate APs for their losses and to \nprovide  measures  to  minimize  resettlement  effects  and  restore  or  improve  the  APs's \nincome/standard of living. Based on extensive consultations with the affected business owners \nand  other  stakeholders,  affected  SBEs  will  relocate  on  their  own  upon  receipt  of  full \ncompensation and before the start of civil works.  The project directorates will notify their \nrespective APs about 6 months ahead of the scheduled start of construction works.  The APs \nwill be allowed to take the salvageable materials for reconstructing their shops and will be \nassisted during relocation. The RESAC and the local NGO will assist the local business leaders \nand affected shop owners with better land use planning and will organize the relocated business \narea, taking into account traffic and safety of the road users.  \n \nF.  Institutional Framework \n16.  Each EA will establish RESAC within its project directorate to implement the RP. Each \nEA will also engage a local NGO to help implement the RP, particularly for social preparation, \ndisclosure of RP, public consultation, road safety awareness, and other resettlement-related \nactivities, including grievance redress. A resettlement specialist from the project supervision \nconsultants  will  also  give  technical  assistance  in  resettlement  planning,  implementation, \nmonitoring and evaluation.  \n \nG.  Resettlement Budget and Financing \n17.  The total estimated cost for land acquisition and resettlement is expected to be in the \namount of PRs.207.1 million ($3.6 million). The total RP implementation budget is estimated for \n20 CWD roads included in the sector Project at PRs.159.1 million ($2.77 million), and for the \ntwo NHA roads at PRs.48.0 million (US$0.83 million). Balochistan's CWD will be spending \nPRs.44.5 million ($0.78 million) on RP implementation on the six core project roads, and the ", "  Appendix 17  61\nremaining amount of PRs.114.3 million ($2.0 million) on 14 non-core subprojects.

Implementation Schedule \n18.  NHA and CWD will implement the RP before civil works start in mid-/late 2004. A time-\nbound RP implementation schedule has been prepared in  accordance with the time of civil \nworks.1  The  Project  will  provide  adequate  advance  notification  to  the  APs  and  will  pay \ncompensation  and  resettlement  assistance  for  lost  assets  at  least  30  days  before  actual \npossession of the land or relocation of affected structures and assets.  An identity card will be \nprepared for each AP and will be issued during the census survey. \n \nI.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n19.  RP implementation will be supervised and monitored by the project directorates, RACs, \nand GRCs. Monitoring will be both internal and external. The project directors (CWD and NHA) \nwill  prepare  monthly  reports  on  the  progress  of  RP  implementation.  Project  supervision \nconsultants will monitor implementation and will report quarterly to NHA, CWD and ADB on the \nprogress of resettlement activities. A panel of domestic experts, who will be engaged jointly by \nCWD and NHA, will conduct independent monitoring and evaluation twice a year for the first 2 \nyears and then once every year during the remaining period of the Project. The independent \nmonitoring and evaluation reports will be submitted to NHA, CWD, and ADB. \n \n                                                 \n1  A detailed time schedule for implementing the RP is given in the main RP document, and available upon request. ", "62 Appendix 18 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Purpose \n \n1.  The  resettlement  framework  establishes  the  screening,  planning,  and  management \nprocedures for involuntary resettlement that apply to non-core road projects to conform to the \npolicy on involuntary resettlement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  framework \napplies to activities prepared after Board approval and during loan implementation.  \n \nB.  Procedures \n \n2.  The following procedures in preparing a resettlement plan (RP) for noncore road projects \nduring project implementation will apply. \n \n(i)  Subprojects with possible land acquisition and resettlement effects are screened \nto ensure their consistency with ADB's policy on involuntary resettlement; \n(ii)  Resettlement effects are identified and avoided or minimized; \n(iii)  The need for a full or short RP is determined in accordance with the criteria set in \nADB's Handbook for Resettlement,1  \n(iv)  The project engineering cell prepares each subproject RP when required. The \nRP is submitted for approval to ADB and is implemented before the award of civil \nworks contracts. \n \nC.  Scope  \n \n3.  The resettlement framework has the following elements: \n(i)  Scope of land acquisition and resettlement. This covers (a) the scope and \nreasons for subproject resettlement, maps, any alternative options to minimize \nland  acquisition,  and  main  resettlement  effects;  (b)  likely  resettlement  risks \nimpoverishment or increased vulnerability for key stakeholders; and (c) primary \nresponsibilities for resettlement. \n(ii)  Socioeconomic information. This comprise (a) census data, including numbers \nand spatial distribution of people affected by different types of loss; (b) methods \nfor conducting socioeconomic surveys; (c) asset inventory; (d) likely resettlement \neffects; (e) all resettlement losses; (f) socioeconomic survey data of affected \npersons  (APS)  including  household  size,  composition,  and  income  and \nexpenditure by key social groups; (g) definition of severely affected households; \n(h) impact on the poor and vulnerable groups (the destitute, widows, disabled, \netc.) and any special measures needed for them, e.g., social preparation, special \nassistance in relocation. \n \nD.  Objectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements.  \n \n4.  In Pakistan, the Land Acquisition Act (LAA) of 1894 (as amended) is the core legal tool \nthe Government uses to acquire private lands for a public purpose. Under the provisions of the \nact, cash compensation is paid at the market rate to affected landowners for land, and to \nregistered tenants for the affected crops only. The legal framework does not cover squatters \nand encroachers. In many project-specific cases, however, the governments of Pakistan and \n                                                 \n1  A full resettlement plan should be prepared if the subproject will have a significant impact on affected people.  \nResettlement will be \u201csignificant\u201d where 200 or more people will experience major impacts. \u201cMajor\u201d impacts \nconstitute being physically displaced from housing and/or losing more than 10% of the household\u2019s productive \n(income generating) assets.  ", "  Appendix 18  63\nthe other provinces (Sindh, Punjab, and NWFP) have assisted even project-affected persons \nwithout any legal titles.  \n \n5.  Pakistan has no specific policy on resettlement. In the absence of a formal policy to \nassist persons with no title to land, a project-specific set of resettlement principles consistent \nwith ADB's policy requirements was adopted in this Project. As a result, the APs, the owners \nand tenants of acquired lands and affected structures (small business enterprises (SBEs), \nhouses,  etc.)  are  entitled  to  a  combination  of  compensation  measures  and  resettlement \nassistance, depending on the nature of their ownership rights to lost/affected assets and scope \nof the impact, and the social and economic vulnerability of the APs. In general terms, the APs \nwill be compensated for loss of lands and structures/assets and assisted to restore their SBEs, \nlivelihoods, and cultural/community structures/assets.

Relocation of the APs will be addressed as required in the subproject RPs through (i) \noptions for relocating housing and other structures; site selection and planning; layout, and \ndesign;  (ii)  provision  of  basic  social  facilities;  (iii)  measures  for  integration  with  host \ncommunities; (iv) study of issues afftecting vulnerable groups; and (v) measures to manage and \nmonitor any environmental risks. \n \nF.  Income Restoration Strategy \n \n7.  Income restoration measures will include (i) identifying livelihoods at risk, (ii) strategies \nfor income restoration, (iii) plan for job creation, (iv) income substitution, (v) retraining, (vi) self-\nemployment, and (vii) business relocation. \n \nG.  Institutional Framework \n \n8.  The project directorates of National Highway Authority (NHA) and Communication and \nWorks Department (CWD) will execute the project resettlement activities. An executive engineer \nwill be appointed as the deputy director of the Road Environment and Social Assessment Cell \n(DD/RESAC), in charge of land acquisition and resettlement operations, and will report to the \nproject  director.  The  DD/RESAC  will  plan,  implement  and  monitor  RP  activities  in  close \npartnership with theAPs, affected/concerned district governments, land acquisition collectors \n(LACs),  field  offices,  local  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  hired  to  assist  in  RP \nimplementation,  resettlement  specialist  from  the  project  supervision  consultants,  grievance \nredress committees (GRCs), and resettlement advisory committees (RACs). In addition, the \nRESAC  will  be  responsible  for  periodic  internal  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  project \nactivities. A panel of experts will be engaged to evaluate RP implementation. Independent \nevaluations will be undertaken twice annually for the first 2 years and then annually during the \nremaining Project period. \n \nH.  Resettlement Budget and Financing \n \n9.  This  will  cover  (i)  measures  for  planning  for  land  acquisition  and  budgeting  and \nresettlement costs, annual budget, and sources of funding; (ii) arrangements for approval of RP \ncost estimates; and (iii) the flow of funds to reach APs and the contingency arrangements. Also \nincluded are guarantees to finance any additional costs required to meet the resettlement \nobjectives, and confirmation of the delivery of entitlements to APs on time. NHA/CWD will \nensure the prompt provision and efficient flow of the budgeted funds. \n \nI.  Implementation Schedule \n \n10.  An indicative schedule for RP preparation and implementation in relation to technical \nworks will be prepared. It will show the time schedule of all resettlement activities, the start and \nfinish dates before acquisition/demolition and procedures for implementing the key elements. \n \nJ.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n11.  There will be arrangements for internal and independent monitoring and evaluation for \nRPs, including plans, timing, resources, and indicators for internal monitoring and external \nindependent evaluation of resettlement targets; and an assessment of the capacity of internal \nand external monitoring and evaluation units.  ", "  Appendix 19   65\nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The Project is categorized as a B Project according to the environmental assessment guidelines \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Therefore, the initial environmental examination (IEE) of the \nsample subprojects were prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines. This appendix is \nbased on the IEE report of the sample projects and includes the assessment of the environmental impact \non the sector.   \n \nB.  Overview of the Environmental Assessment of the Sector Impacts  \n2.  Balochistan  Province's    existing  environmental  problems  are  dominated  by  desertification, \nshortage of water due to lack of groundwater recharge, declining biodiversity, soil erosion and salination, \nand  urban  pollution  especially  water  contamination.  Although  environmental  protection  and  related \nnatural  resource  management  regulations  such  forest  legislation  exist  in  Pakistan,  the  present \nenvironmental administration in Balochistan is very weak. The Environmental Protection Ordinance of \n1983 requires environmental assessment to be submitted to the provincial Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA) for approval before any project is implemented. However, this practice was only recently \nimplemented in Balochistan. \n \n3.  Improving the road network, as the main transport infrastructures in Balochistan will benefit the \nprovince by improving connectivity and facilitating traffic movement between rural areas and state \nnational highways. However, it will also generate environmental costs related to road construction and \noperation. Increased mobility will lead to increased production and service sectors, and therefore to \nincreasing deterioration of the environment and natural resources if appropriate mitigation measures are \nnot applied. The environmental impacts associated with construction to improve the road networks will be \naddressed and handled mainly by the road authorities. However, dealing with the impact related to the \noperation of the road networks will involve other institutions and civil society. Better coordination among \nagencies including civil society is needed to anticipate and prevent environmental problems. Since the \nProject will strengthen the provincial Communication and Works Department (CWD) and establish the \nRoad, Environment, and Social Assessment Cell (RESAC), it is expected that RESAC can facilitate \ncoordination to address and handle environmental problems related to the transport sector in more \nsustainable and systematic ways.  In addition, the technical assistance loan, which basically focuses on \nempowering civil society, will become a complementary component to maximize the project benefits and \nreduce any social and environmental costs related to the Project. \n \nC.  Summary of the IEE of the Sample Subproject \n1.  Project Description \n \n4.  The roads surveyed for the project covered 2,500 kilometers (km) in 21 districts of Balochistan. \nSubsequently, another 31 roads 508 km long in Kalat district were added. The National Highway \nAuthority (NHA) and the government of Balochistan selected eight roads after initial prioritization: three \nrural access roads (RARs), three provincial highways (PHs), and two national highways (NHs). The \nRARs and PHs will involve construction or rehabilitation of the existing roads or tracks 3.7 meters wide \nand with a 2-meter shoulder on each side. The NHs will involve widening the existing roads to 7.3 meter. \nFor all roads, culverts, bridges, and drainage will be rehabilitated. \n ", "66 Appendix 19 \n  2.  Environmental Condition of the Project Area \n \n5.  The environmental conditions of the project area particularly along the road alignment are briefly \nsummarized here. \n \n6.  Gulistan-Sagi Bazar-Kandel Road (RAR).  The  present  kutcha  track  of  13  km  starts  from \nGulistan and ends at Kandel Road. It is flanked with fruit, vegetable, and wheat farms, irrigated mainly by \ntube wells.  Water in this area has been pumped from a groundwater table at a depth of 300-600 feet. \nFarmers use the road to transport agricultural products to market. The present road crosses two small \nstreams. The RAR does not pass through forest/game reserve, wildlife sanctuary, or any protected area. \nNo endangered plant and animal species have been reported.  \n \n7.  Khurkhera\u2013Kanraj Road (RAR). The present track extends to 24 km Lasbela district starting \nfrom 25 km after Khurkhera connection from NH25 and ending at village Pehi. The area is characterized \nby low-fertility gravel type soil on small bare mountains with low rainfall. There is no agriculture in the \narea and the inhabitants depend on livestock only. The area used to have fish and chicken farms, but \nthese were ruined by the recent drought. Most of the land is devoid of any tree cover but sporadic \nbushes are found in patches. The road passes through flat drylands where no forest/game reserve, \nwildlife sanctuary, or any protected areas have been encountered. No endangered plant and animal \nspecies have been reported.  \n \n8.  Dera Allahyar\u2013Hairdin Road (RAR). This is 40 km road starts from Dera Allahyar near NH65) \nand ends at Hairdin. The road also leads to the Sui Gas fields. This is the only road in Balochistan that \npasses through fertile agricultural lands and has green cover along the road. The area is water rich due \nto the Put-Feeder canal. Limited industrial activity has been reported including brick kilns, cement pipe \nfactory, rice mills, cotton ginning mills, and fish and poultry farms. More animal life is observed here due \nto the presence of water. The RAR passes through canal-irrigated lands, but no forest or game reserves, \nwildlife sanctuary, or protected areas have been encountered. No endangered plant and animal species \nhave been reported.  \n \n9.  Zhob-Mir Ali Khail-Khajuri Kach Road (PH). This provincial single carriageway originates at \nZhob (linking with NH50) and ends at Khajuri Kach. The road is located at the extreme north of the \nprovince connecting Balochistan to North West Frontiner Province via Tank. The land along the highway \nis highly mountainous with steep slopes and current pathway riding conditions are poor.  Topography is \nundulating for the first 11 km while hilly areas occur for the rest of the road. The road meanders along \nGomal, Zhob, and other rainwater streams, where isolated and protruding rocky mountains are located.  \nThere is a katcha (unpaved) shingle track to Mughal Kot, 80 km from Zhob, and another 20 km track that \ncannot sustain any type of traffic. Grapes and apricot are major fruits being grown. Forest cover is rare in \nthe area, except greenery and agro-based activity along the river where water flows even during drought. \nIn rainy season, all water channels are full, disrupting the transport route and emergency supplies to the \nlocal people. The groundwater table is in the range of 50-100 feet in and around Zhob. Agroforestry \nalong water channels has provided alternate habitats for many birds, insects etc. A few unexplored coal \nmines at the end of the road may be exploited on completion of the road. In contrast with that of other \nselected roads, this area is relatively less polluted by dust due to better vegetative cover. Most of the \ncorridor along this road consists of gravel-type mountains with possibility of some landslides. The \nhighway does not pass through forest or game reserve, wildlife sanctuary, or any protected area. No \nendangered species have been reported.  \n ", "  Appendix 19   67\n10.   Nag\u2013Punjgur Road (PH). This PH originates  at the outskirts of Panjgur  and ends at Nag \n(Kharan and Panjgur districts). Current PH riding conditions are not good and the PH is unpaved (katcha \ntrack with loose gravel top). Fruit farms are observed only in Panjgur area. Beyond Panjgur, very little \nhabitation is possible because drought conditions, sandy soils, and hardened surfaces make it unfit for \nvegetation and fruit farming. Again the water table is reported to be lower than in other parts of \nBalochistan, i.e., 25-300 feet deep but is not extracted because financial resources of the inhabitants are \nlow. Wind is reportedly strong most of the year along the road and can be used to generate electricity, \npumping water, etc. Population density along the roads is low. The road runs almost on level ground with \nsandy  soil  and  gravel-black mountains devoid of any bushes or trees, adjoining vast stretches of \nuncultivated  dry  field.  The  area  has  very  little  green  cover  or  plantations  as  a  whole  and  faces \nsandstorms regularly resulting in visibility problems. The road crosses a number of dried-up streams and \nrivers including Rakhshan River, Surab River, and Sabzab Nullah. No forest or game reserves, wildlife \nsanctuary, protected areas, or endangered species have been reported.  \n \n11.  Kach\u2013Shahrag\u2013Harnai Road (PH). This unpaved provincial road starts from Kach located 71 km \nfrom Quetta on Quetta-Ziarat Road and ends at Harnai. It covers two districts of Ziarat and Sibi. There is \nan old outdated railway tunnel through which the current road passes, constructed to avoid land sliding \nonto the railway tracks. A few pockets of loose soil were observed, which makes landslides and erosion \nof the embankment common. Pockets close to the riverbed show scattered fruit and vegetable farms and \nmedicinal herbs. Some parts of the valley along the road depend on surface rainwater flowing through \nthe rivers and is called barani-fed areas, with groundwater table as low as 200 feet. Other areas have \ngroundwater at a depth of 500-800 feet. During the heavy monsoon season flooding closes portions of \nthe road. The highway crosses the river Khost, which had water flowing throughout the year before the \ndry spell of the past 5-6 years, requiring a number of bridges on the river and eroding bases of the \nexisting road. This road is used to transport fruits/vegetables to markets, coal to nearby thermal power \nplants and other users in Balochistan and Punjab; and to bring wood from Punjab. Coal mining is \ncommon in Harnai, which has four railway stations involved in coal transport throughout the country. The \nrailway line runs from Khost to Harnai and beyond. The highway passes through partially irrigated lands, \nbut there is no forest or game reserve, wildlife sanctuary, or any protected areas.  No endangered \nspecies have been reported.  \n \n12.  Quetta-Kalat Road (NH). This section of the road starts from the outskirts of Quetta and ends at \nKalat.   This road is an important part of NH25 originating from Karachi to Chamman and would be the \nkey route to Afghanistan and further north to the Central Asian republics. This highway passes through \npartially irrigated lands with fruit and agricultural farms. Soil is patchy, with gravel on most of the route, \nbut sandy soil occurs after Pringabad with typical desert bushes in the area. The land is fertile but lacks \nwater resources and supply and depends heavily on either pumping of underground water or rainwater \nharvesting. The water table depth varies from 350 to 600 feet in towns along the highway. The road \ncrosses a number of small towns and markets like Pringabad, Mastung, Mangochar, and Kalat.  At Lakh \npass, an 80-m mountain cut is being established to minimize gradient and turning. Heavy winds and dust \nstorms are typical in certain areas, especially after Pringabad. Mixed types of trees are planted near \nMastung. This area is designated as an earthquake zone. Its history of earthquakes in the recent past \ndictates the architecture of homes which are constructed with mud to minimize losses and blend with \nnature. The project road is 5 km away from the Hazarghanji Park.  No other forest or game reserve, \nwildlife sanctuary, or any protected areas have been encountered. No endangered species have been \nreported.  \n \n13.  Quetta\u2013Chamman Road  (NH).  The road starts from the outskirts of Quetta and ends at \nChamman. It forms part of the integrated program for improvement and upgrading of NH25 from Karachi \nto Chamman. All rivers and streams have dried up. Land in the corridor consists of loose soil without any \ntree cover. In windy weather, dust storms are common. The few inhabitants of the area depend on ", "68 Appendix 19 \nlivestock. Close to Quetta, a few stone crushers operate. Brick kilns using local coal with high emissions \nof visible smoke are scattered along the road to Chamman. The road passes through a number of towns: \nBeleli,  Kuchlak,  Yaru,  Saranan,  Jungle  Pir  Ali  Zai,  Killa  Abdullah,  ShelaBagh,  Khojak  Pass,  and \nChamman. Travel time between Quetta and Chamman is around 2 hours 20 minutes with the existing \ncondition of the road. A small dried-up river/stream winds along the road after Killa Abdulllah for 20-30 \nkm and the existing road alignment crosses a number of rainwater streams. Kojak mountain terrain near \nShelabagh is a difficult terrain with high water-induced landslides and erodible soil. The PH passes \nthrough scantily irrigated lands where no forest or game reserve, wildlife sanctuary, or any protected \nareas have been encountered.  No endangered species have been reported.  \n \n  3.  Screening Potential Impact and Mitigation Measures \n \n14.  No significant environmental impact is expected due to  location because the Project will be \nconfined to rehabilitating existing roads and does not include roads located nearby or within reserve \nareas or wildlife sanctuaries. Environmental impacts may include (i) disrupted traffic in the construction \narea, (ii) increased air pollution due to increased dust and other volatile chemical substances from the \nasphalt  plant,  (iii)  noise  and  vibration,  (iv)  disrupted  water  systems  due  to  cut  and  fill  and  other \nearthwork, and (v) potential landslides associated with elevating the road. Such impacts will occur only \nduring the construction period. Mitigation measures will include (i) rerouting traffic during the construction \nstage; (ii) maintaining optimum moisture content during handling of soil, spraying water to minimize dust, \nand maintaining a safe distance between asphalt plants and public facilities including schools; (iii) strictly \ncontrolling  the  construction  works  that  create  noise  and  vibration  by  prohibiting  night  work  near \nresidential areas; (iv) pumping stagnant water and providing adequate drainage systems; (v) stabilizing \nroad embankment sideslopes; (vi) avoiding road widening at ponds and widening roads only on one side \nto avoid excessive tree cutting; (vii) planting trees; and (viii) establishing forums to communicate with \naffected persons. All these mitigation measures will be included in the contract documents for the \ncontractor.  All  the  impacts  are  clearly  temporary  and  manageable.  However,  special  attention  to \nimplementing environmental mitigation is needed for the following:(i) roads connecting Zhob to Khajuri \nand Quetta-Chamman due to the need for heavy cutting of mountains and landslide problems; and (ii) \nroad connecting Dera Allahyar to Hairdin due to potential accidents related to the gas pipeline. Improving \nthe road will reduce dust, but it will also increase traffic, which might increase air pollution related to \nmotor vehicle operation. Since the cause of the impacts are beyond the responsibility of the EA, it is \nnecessary that the EA maintain tree planting along the road to minimize the impact of vehicle emission \non public health and to maintain the embankment to avoid erosion. Borrow pit operations will be strictly \ncontrolled (e.g., no borrow pits will be allowed in agriculture lands or areas prone to erosion and \nlandslide, and former borrow pit areas will be rehabilitated). Consultations carried out with communities \nin the surrounding project areas during the IEE noted that the people expected the Project to benefit \nthem by providing quicker assistance for medical patients, minimum fares, and shorter time for their \nagricultural produce to reach the market.  \n \n4.  Institutional Arrangement for Monitoring and Implementing Environmental \nManagement Plan \n \n15.  The environmental management plan (EMP) covers actions to ensure that mitigation measures \nand monitoring of theie implementation throughout project implementation and operation are part of the \nIEE. The EMP stated that, during construction impacts associated with earthwork (e.g., siltation, erosion, \ndust, noise) need to be carefully mitigated. During operation, air pollution due to vehicle emissions and \ncontamination of oil are impacts that need to be handled. Implementation of the mitigation measures will \nbe monitored in accordance with the Government and ADB's environmental assessment requirements. \nThe  report  on  EMP  implementation  should  be  submitted  to  ADB  annually.  Based  on  the  EMP, ", "  Appendix 19   69\nimplementating  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  stage  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the \ncontractor.  \n \n16.  An environmental specialist will be hired as part of the consultant team for implementing the \nProject and will assist the RESAC in Balochistan CWD to prepare contractual documents so that the bid \ndocuments and other obligations of the contractors clearly identify their environmental responsibilities \nand describe penalties for noncompliance. In addition, the environmental specialist as part of the \nconsultant\u2019s  team  will  also  provide  recommendations  to  the  engineering  design  team  to  address \nenvironmental concerns, and supervise monitoring of mitigation measures implementation during the \nconstruction stage. To deal with environmental impacts associated with the operation, particularly with \nincreasing  vehicle  emission,  oil  contamination  due  to  spillage  and  linkage,  Balochistan  CWD  will \nstrengthen coordination with relevant agencies to minimize the impacts. CWD and its RESAC will \nimplement overall environmental monitoring and management, while NHA will implement its EMP.  \n \n  5.  Finding and Recommendations \n \n17.  The  present  IEE  reveals  that  few  environmental  impacts  are  likely  to  occur  due  to  the \nconstruction activities; normal operations of the proposed rehabilitation project and recommendations are \nsuggested accordingly for mitigating these perceived impacts. A  full environmental impact assessment \n(EIA) for roads involved in this Project is not required. \n \nD.  Environmental Criteria for Subproject Selection  \n18.  The following selection criteria will be adopted for the follow on subprojects: \n(i)  The subproject will not involve any widening of rights-of-way of the existing roads located \nwithin the areas declared as environmentally and socially sensitive (e.g., national parks, \nsanctuaries, cultural heritage).  \n (ii)  The Project will involve only the subprojects that comply with all necessary Government \nenvironmental  requirements  such  as  a  no  objection  certification  from  Pakistan  or \nBalochistan EPA. \n \nE.  Review Procedures for the Environmental Assessment of the Follow-on Subprojects \n \n19.  The EIA for the follow-up subproject will be prepared and reviewed by the following procedures: \n \n(i)  The IEE (including the EMP) for all follow-on subprojects must be prepared by the \nenvironmental specialist as part of the consultant team. If any significant environmental \nimpact is predicted, an EIA will also be prepared. \n(ii)  During the IEE/EIA, adequate consultations with affected groups will be carried out and a \nreport on these consultations will be an appendix of the IEE/EIA. \n(iii)  All the IEE reports will be reviewed by RESAC. All the IEE reports will be submitted to \nADB and the Pakistan or Balochistan EPA. The construction works can start only after \nADB concurs with the IEE report and the no objection certificate granted by the Pakistan \nor Balochistan EPA.  \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "RRP-Balochistan main text-23-Oct-2003 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20031028101908Z", "Title": "RRP-Balochistan main text-23-Oct-2003.doc", "Author": "fnl", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20040218104335+08'00'"}}
