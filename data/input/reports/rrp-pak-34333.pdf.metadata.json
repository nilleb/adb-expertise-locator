An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nundertaken, and the summary IEE is a core appendix. \n \nThe Project will improve connectivity and allow better access \nin  Balochistan,  and  build  the  capacity  and  systems  for \nsustainable  road  sector  development,  specifically  in  road \nmaintenance.  The  Project  will  also  improve  the  efficiency  of \nnational  highway  (NH)  25,  including  one  major  border \ncrossing, that passes through Balochistan, and forms part of \nthe  priority  road  transport  corridor,  that  links  Pakistan, \nAfghanistan, and Central Asia together. \n \nBalochistan  is  the  largest  and  least  developed  province  in \nPakistan.  The  economic  development  potential \nthe \nlimited  resource  base; \nprovince \ninadequate  social  and  economic  infrastructure;  lack  of \nconnectivity  between  the  poor  rural  population  and  market \nand district centers; and poor access to education and health \nfew  employment \nfacilities,  and  social  services;  and \nopportunities.    \n \nThe  onset  of  peace  in  Afghanistan  and  developments  in \nPakistan  and  Central  Asia  offer  opportunities  for  regional \ncooperation.  As  one  of  the  principal  gateways  between \nPakistan and Afghanistan, Balochistan is well placed to play \nan  increasing  role  in  regional  trade  and  cooperation  if \ntransport  bottlenecks  are \nremoved  and  cross-border \narrangements improved.   \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  adopted  a \nprogrammatic  approach  that  sequences  interventions  in \nindividual  provinces  over  several  years.  This  Project  is the \nthird  intervention  using  that  approach,  following  the  road \nprojects  that  were  approved  in  2001  and  2002  and  covered \nthe provinces of Sindh and Punjab, respectively. Balochistan \nprovincial  government  (BPG)  has  taken  some  initiatives  to \naddress provincial road sector policy issues, and established \na  road  management  unit  (RMU)  at  its  Communications  and \nWorks  Department  (CWD).  However,  major  challenges \nremain, including continued institutional changes at CWD and \nefforts  to  improve  road  maintenance  and  road  safety.  At  the \nfederal level, the National Highway Authority (NHA),  which is \nresponsible \nfor  national  highway  development  and \nmaintenance,  is  undergoing  a  policy  and  institutional  reform \nprogram supported by ADB.  \n\n\fThe  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  reduce  poverty  and \nsupport pro-poor economic growth by (i) enhancing access of \nrural  populations  to  economic  opportunities  and  social \nservices  by  improving  the  provincial  road  network;  (ii) \nimproving  trade  facilitation  and  efficiency  of  the  priority  road \ntransport  corridor  linking  Pakistan,  Afghanistan  and  Central \nAsia together, which  traverse  Balochistan;  and  (iii)  providing \nessential institutional support and capacity building at CWD.    \n \nThe  Project  has  four  main  components:  (i)  a  provincial \ninstitutional development component (PIDC) supporting CWD \nand  districts,  (ii)  a  provincial  access  component  (PAC) \ncomprising  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  about  1,100 \nkilometers  (km)  of  provincial  roads,  (iii)  a  cross-border \ndevelopment  component  (CDC)  supporting  improved  trade \nfacilitation and providing a new pilot cross-border facility, and \n(iv)  a  national  highway  component  (NHC)  comprising \nrehabilitation  of  247  km  of  national  highways.  Rehabilitation \nand  construction  of  the  provincial  roads  will  follow  a  sector \napproach. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $267.3  million \nequivalent. The foreign exchange cost is $162.5 million, and \nthe local currency cost is $104.8 million equivalent. \n \n\n Foreign \n Exchange \n\n($ million) \n Local \n Currency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\nPercent \n\nSource \n \n\n \n\n69.5 \n\n185.7 \n\n     81.6           30.5      \n\n0.0 \n162.5 \n\n104.8              267.3         100.0 \n\nADB                   162.5              23.2 \nGovernment \n    81.6 \n  Total \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \n \nA  loan  of  \u00a520,266,370,000  ($185.7  million  equivalent)  from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  be  provided.

Each  PMU  will  be  headed  by  a  project \ndirector. The additional chief secretary (ACS) of BPG will chair \na steering group for the PIDC and the PAC. The Chairperson \nof NHA will chair a steering group for the CDC and the NHC.  \n \nAll  procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines for  Procurement.  Advance action for procurement \nwas approved on 14 July 2003. \n \nThe  Project  will  require  250  person-months  of  international \nand  4,509  person-months of domestic consulting services for \n(i)  institutional  development  with  capacity  building  under  the \nPIDC, (ii) detailed design and construction supervision for the \ncivil  works  for  the  provincial  roads,  and  (iii)  construction \nsupervision  of  the  civil  works  for  the  national  highways.  The \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants.  \n \nA  TA  loan  equivalent  to  $1.0  million  (SDR  701,000)  for \nCommunity  Development  and  Poverty  Targeting  will  be \nprovided  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The  TA  loan \nwill  have  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8 \nyears;  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace \nperiod and 1.5 % per annum thereafter; and such other terms \nand  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with those \nset forth in the draft TA Loan Agreement.    \n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance Grant  ADB  will  provide  a  TA  grant  in  the  amount  of  $500,000  for \ncross-border development. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fincreased  access \n\nThe main quantifiable benefits of the Project consist of savings \nin vehicle operating costs and passenger time. The economic \ninternal  rates  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  selected  two  national \nhighways are 33.7% and 40.4%, respectively. For the six core \nprovincial  roads,  the  EIRRs  are  14.8\u201348.9%.  All  provincial \nroads were subjected to analysis based on multiple social and \neconomic  criteria.  The  Project  will  reduce  poverty  by  (i) \nenabling the poor to participate in economic opportunities and \nenhancing  their  access  to  social  services,  and  (ii)  creating \nadditional  economic  opportunities  for  the  poor  by  stimulating \neconomic  growth.  Project  beneficiaries  will  comprise  (i)  the \npoor  who  will  have \nto  economic \nopportunities  and  human  development  services  because  of \nimproved national highways and provincial roads; (ii) the poor \nwho  live  in  the  districts  in  Balochistan  and  were  previously \nunable \nto  pursue  employment  and  other  economic \nopportunities  due  to  geographic  isolation  and  long  journey \ntimes;  (iii)  companies,  employees,  consumers  and  transport \noperators  in  Balochistan  Province,  Afghanistan,  and  Central \nAsia  who  directly  or  indirectly  use  goods  and  services \ntransported on the project roads.  \n \nThe  risks  to  the  Project  are  related  to  (i)  start-up delays, (ii) \ncommitment to institutional changes at CWD, (iii) progress on \nreform  at  NHA,  (iv)  adequacy  of  road  maintenance  at  federal \nand  provincial  levels  and  (v)  commitment  to  cross-border \ndevelopment.  The  risks  will  be  mitigated  through  (i)  advance \nactions  for  recruiting  consultants  and  starting  procurement \nactivities, (ii)  use of already established PMUs and appointed \nproject  directors,  (iii)  BPG\u2019s  commitment  to  and  agreement \nwith ADB on institutional development and changes, (iv) policy \nand  institutional  reform  measures  already  implemented  by \nroad \ninitiated  by  NHA \nNHA, \nmaintenance and increase its funding, (vi) capacity building at \nCWD  and  other  support  for  road  maintenance  under  the \nProject,  and  (vii)  strong  support  by  the  federal  Government \nand  advance  actions  already  under  way  to  improve  trade \nfacilitation  including  transit  arrangements.

The project framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nRoad  Sector.  Balochistan,  which  is  the  largest  but  least  developed  and  least  populated \n2. \nprovince  in  Pakistan,  has  6.6  million  people,1  or  5%  of  the  total  population.  About  76%  of \nBalochistan's  population  live  in  rural  areas.  The  provincial  road  network2  grew  from  14,682 \nkilometer  (km)  in  1993  to  23,451  km  in  2000  (Appendix  2)  reflecting  poor  connectivity  in  the \nprovince.  The  largest  expansion  was  that  of  farm-to-markets  roads,  which  increased  manifold \nwith support frp, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of Japan. The length of \nthe national highways remained largely constant at  2,300 km. Balochistan has still, however, the \nlowest  density  of  roads  among  the  four  provinces  of  Pakistan.  Poor  connectivity  and  access \ncontinue  to  be  a  major  problem,  which  particularly  affect  the  poor,  who  live  mostly  in  the  rural \nareas.  The  increased  demand  for  road  transport  \u2013  about  7-8%  per  year  \u2013  and  higher  traffic \nintensity combined with insufficient maintenance have  caused several parts of the road network \nto deteriorate.  A survey of 2,500 km of provincial roads found that gravel roads or earthen tracks \nrepresenting  90%  of  the  network  were  in  poor  to  very  poor  condition  and  were  deteriorating \nrapidly  owing  to  increased  traffic,  underinvestment  in  transport  infrastructure,  and  insufficient \nmaintenance.3  The  national  highways  in  Balochistan,  which  are  administered  by  the  National \nHighway  Authority  (NHA),  play  an  important  role  from  the  regional  perspective  as  they  carry \ntransit  traffic  between  Pakistan  and  Afghanistan  and  provide  access  to  ports4  in  southern \nPakistan through national highway (NH) 25. Several sections on NH25 are, however, constrained, \ntoo  narrow  with  respect  to  the  traffic  carried,  and  in  poor  condition;  the conditions cause  high \nvehicle operating cost and compromise road safety.  \n \n3. \nPakistan\u2019s  Regional  Cooperation  and  Trade  Potential.  The  onset  of  peace  in \nAfghanistan,  introduction  of  market-oriented  reforms  in  Pakistan,  and  developments  in  Central \nAsia  have  opened  up  opportunities  for  closer  cooperation  among  these  countries. Pakistan and \nits province Balochistan is geographically well placed and has the potential to play an increasing \nrole  in  regional  cooperation,  linking  landlocked  Afghanistan,  and  Central  and  South  Asia  more \nclosely.  Pakistan  provides  the  shortest  route  (about  300-500  km  shorter  than  the  second  best \nalternative) to ports in Afghanistan and most countries in Central Asia, which are landlocked and \nremain  dependent  on  road  transport  and  transit  arrangements  with  neighboring  countries  that \nallow  the  use  of  their  port  facilities.  Pakistan,  Afghanistan,  and  the  countries  in  Central  Asia \n\n                                                 \n1  From 1981 to 1998, the population grew at an annual average rate of 2.68% (Balochistan 2.42%). \n2  The Balochistan provincial road network comprises 2,351 kilometers (km) of national highways (administered by the \nNational Highway Authority), 8,146 km of provincial highways, 8,659 km of secondary roads, and 3,940 km of access \nroads. \n\n3  PRs100.9 million was spent on road maintenance in FY2001/02. It is estimated that twice this amount is needed to \n\npreserve the road asset base in Balochistan. \n\n4  Karachi and Qasim ports. A new port  being constructed in Gwadar in southwest Pakistan is expected to open during \n\n2005.  \n\n\f2\n\n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nsuffer, however, from lack of or inadequate facilities and systems5 at border crossings. Moreover, \ncross border procedures and operations are generally bureaucratic and slow, causing extensive \ndelays in moving goods, and passengers across the borders. The resulting inability to effectively \nmanage and monitor cross-border trade has spurred extensive smuggling and other unauthorized \nflow of goods, and thus distorts trade and tariff regimes in the subregion. While Pakistan's trade \nwithin the  Economic  Cooperation  Organization6  (ECO)  accounts  for  only  3%  of  its  total  trade, \nAfghanistan is Pakistan\u2019s third largest trading partner within  ECO after Iran and Turkey. Recent \ndata on trade showed that nearly 90% of Afghanistan\u2019s exports of $1.2 billion7 and about 46% of \nits imports were through Pakistan. A significant portion of Afghanistan\u2019s exports was reexports of \nimports  from  Pakistan.8  Thus,  Afghanistan's  trade  with  Pakistan  was  dominated  by  unofficial \nexports  and  reexports  amounting  to  $941  million,  followed  by  import  transit  trade  ($221  million) \nand  import  trade  ($61  million).  With  further  progress  on  securing  peace  and  positive \ndevelopments in Afghanistan, trade between Afghanistan and Pakistan and transit traffic through \nPakistan could substantially increase.9      \n \nB. \n \nPoverty. In Pakistan the incidence of poverty increased from 30.6% in FY1999 to 32.1% \n4. \nin FY2001  leaving  about  42  million  people  in  poverty.10  Poverty  is  largely  a  rural  phenomenon. \nAbout 108 million people live in rural areas (77% of the total population of 130 million). More than \n40% of the population live below the poverty line in the rural areas. The overall poverty level in \nBalochistan is reported at 39.1% (43.7% in rural areas and 29.5 % in urban areas).11 The Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper of the Government puts the overall poverty figure in Balochistan at 41-\n47%.  About  50%  of  the  rural  villages  in  Balochistan  have  no  or  very  poor  road  access.  ADB is \nactively engaged in policy dialogue  on poverty reduction and related issues with the federal and \nprovincial governments. The poverty focus is emphasized in the country strategy program (CSP) \nof May 2002 and reinforced in its update (2004-2006), and in the poverty partnership agreement \nthat  was  signed  in  2002  between  the  federal  Government  and  ADB.  Balochistan  provincial \ngovernment (BPG) is prioritizing improvement of provincial connectivity and enhanced access to \nreduce poverty.  Research  and  international  experience  have shown  that  improved  connectivity \nand  road  transport  play  an  important  role  in  reducing  poverty  by  providing  basic  access  to \neducation,  health,  and  markets,  and  improving  access  to  social  and  economic  opportunities, \nincluding  labor  and  product  markets,  schools,  and  clinics.  Im proved  road  connectivity  in \nBalochistan  will  help the poor  overcome geographic isolation,  and  enable  them  to  participate in \ncommunity and wider decision making and overcome social, cultural, and physical barriers.12  \n \nInstitutional  Capacity  and  Constraints.  The  Communication  and  Works  Department \n5. \n(CWD) in Balochistan, which is responsible for roads and buildings, is structured and functions as \na  typical  public  works  department.  It's  character  has  not  changed  significantly  during  recent \n\n                                                 \n5  Specifically physical infrastructure, equipment, customs, and other administrative systems. \n6  Comprises  Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan, \n\nIran,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyzstan,  Tajikistan,  Turkey,  Turkmenistan,  and \n\n7  UNDP/World  Bank.  2001.Study:  Afghanistan\u2019s  Trade  with  Neighboring  Countries.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n \n\nyears. Planning and institutional capacity at  for  road  maintenance at CWD is weak. In addition, \nthe  use  of  road  asset  management,  maintenance  systems  and  procedures  are  not \ninstitutionalized  and  integrated  in  the  day-to-day  operations  at  CWD.  While  a  separate  road \nmanagement  unit  was  established  in  1999  with  support  of  ADB  and  the  Nordic  Development \nFund,  the  unit  was  essentially  discontinued  in  2001  due  to  lack  of  provincial  support.  Another \nimportant  but  more  difficult  issue  is  alignment  of  staff  resources  at  CWD.  Moreover,  as  a \nconsequence  of  the  ongoing  devolution  program,13  significant  challenges  are  confronting  BPG, \nwhich sets the basis for the transforming  CWD and the 26 district administrations. At the federal \nlevel, NHA is undergoing a policy and institutional reform program supported by ADB through a \nprogram loan component14 and the World Bank, which aims to transform NHA into a modern road \nmanagement agency. This program includes (i) institutional development and capacity building at \nNHA, (ii) improved road maintenance processes, (iii) support for the road maintenance fund that \nwas  established  in  2002,  (iv)  a  road  safety  program,  (iv)  an  axle  load  control  program  and  (v) \nimproved financial management system.  Although some initial delays occurred, NHA made good \nprogress during 2002 and 2003 and met the agreed upon first tranche conditions (June 2002) and \nthe second tranche conditions (July 2003), which had been agreed upon with ADB.15  \n \nRoad  Maintenance,  Safety,  and  Vehicle  Overloading.    During  the  last  5  years, \n6. \nspending  on  road  maintenance  in  Balochistan  has  fluctuated  between  PRs47.5  million  and \nPRs100.9 milliont.16 The recent expansion of the provincial road network and the increase  in the \nroad asset base indicate that  bigger  budget  allocations  for  maintenance  are  required  to  sustain \nthe provincial road network. This implies a shift from road network expansion to improvement and \nmaintenance  of  existing  roads.  It  also  suggests  allocation  of  more  funds  for  road  maintenance \nand further involvement of the private sector to enhance capacity and efficiency. With respect to \nroad  safety,  Pakistan's  total  fatalities-to-vehicle  ratio  is  about  10  times  higher  than  that  in \ndeveloped  countries.17  The  situation  is  worst  in  Balochistan  because  of  low  awareness,  poorly \ntrained  drivers,  and  a  large  number  of  narrow  roads.  In  1999,  467  people  were  killed  in  road \naccidents.  Reported  road  accidents  reached  about  346,  but  the  actual  number  is  likely  to  be \nmuch higher. Overloading of trucks is also a problem on major roads in Balochistan. While NHA \nhas  initiated  actions  to  address  this  growing  problem,  further  efforts  by  CWD  are required  to \ncontrol the increasing damage to its road network. Appendix 3 gives the road sector analysis.  \n \nTransit Arrangements. Transit trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan is governed by \n7. \nthe  Afghan  Transit  Trade  Agreement  (ATTA)  signed  in  1965.  ATTA  covers  two  main  routes \npassing via Chamman and Torkham. Transportation of Afghan cargo is allowed through railway \nservice  only.  Road  transport  across  Pakistan  for  certain  humanitarian  aid  shipments  bound  for \nAfghanistan is also allowed as an exception by the National Logistics Center. To protect domestic \nindustry  and  to  discourage  smuggling,  24  items  not allowed under ATTA  have  been  put  on  the \nnegative  list.  Recently,  however,  eight  items  on  that  list were  deleted  and  Pakistan  has  also \nallowed Port Quasim as an alternative port of entry for transit. Additional measures may include \n(i) improving the application of current procedures and working arrangements at the main cross-\nborder points, (ii) allowing private operators to carry containers by road, (iii) introducing the use of \n                                                 \n13 Under the devolution program, local governments at district level have been created.  \n14 ADB. 2001.

Due  to  its  geographic  location,  Pakistan \nhas a great opportunity to  increase trade by providing efficient transit and competitive access to \nports  for  landlocked  Afghanistan  if  impediments  to  trade  are  relaxed  and  eventually  removed.18 \nThe proposed Project addresses the prevailing constraints by providing TA to review and improve \ncurrent transit arrangements under ATTA and by improving transit operations at one major border \ncrossing on a pilot basis. \n \nRoad  Sector  Assistance  in  Afghanistan  and  Central  Asia.  The  road  network  in \n8. \nAfghanistan  is  in  an  extremely  poor  state  following  decades  of  war  and  civil  unrest, and road \nsector institutions are weak or absent.  To address these shortcomings, ADB is actively involved \nin the road sector in Afghanistan. ADB  is supporting TA for capacity building19 and TA to develop \na  framework  and  legislation  for  cross-border  transport,  covering  Pakistan,  Afghanistan, and the \ncountries  in  Central  Asia.20  ADB  is  also  financing  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  important \nroads in Afghanistan: (i) rehabilitation of the Kandahar\u2013Spin Bolak road (105 km),21 which is the \nmain  southeast  highway  connecting  Afghanistan  with  Pakistan  and  Balochistan  at  Chamman \nborder  crossing,  and  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  the  Pule  Khumri\u2013Mazar  Sharif\u2013Sheberghan\u2013Andhoy \nroad section (392 km) in the north  of Afghanistan including the road link connecting Afghanistan \nwith  Uzbekistan  (Naibabad\u2013Hairatan  road,  55  km).  In  Central  Asia,  ADB  is  also  active  in \nsupporting  subregional  cooperation  and  removing  impediments  to  cross-border  road transport \nthrough  regional  TA22  and  financing  road  rehabilitation  projects  in  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia, \nTajikistan, and Uzbekistan.  \n \nSector  Coordination  and  Assistance.  ADB,  World  Bank  and  Japan  Bank  for \n9. \nInternational  Cooperation  (JBIC)  are  the  principal  providers  of  assistance  to  the road sector in \nPakistan (Appendix 4). ADB has approved seven loans totaling $747 million for Pakistan\u2019s road \nsector,  four  of  which  have  been  for  umbrella  projects  that  include  components  in  each  of  the \ncountry\u2019s four provinces.23 The World Bank has mainly focused on assistance to the national road \nnetwork, specifically rehabilitation of the main domestic artery (Karachi-Lahore-Peshawar), along \nwith support for policy and institutional reform of NHA at the federal level. Following the adoption \nof a coordinated policy agenda for road sector reform at the national and provincial levels, ADB \nhas targeted (i) development of provincial road networks, (ii) rehabilitation of national highways of \nregional  significance,  and  (iii)  assistance  to  improve  efficiency  of  movement  of  goods  and \npassengers  across  borders  in  the  region.  JBIC  has  also  provided  assistance  to  provincial \nnetworks, complementing ADB assistance.  \n \n10. \nExperience in Subregional Cooperation. ADB has played a catalytic role and is actively \nsupporting several subregional cooperation initiatives in Asia. These initiatives include support for \n(i) the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), which was initiated in 1992; (ii) Central Asia; and, more \nrecently, (iii) South Asia Social and Economic Cooperation (SASEC). Experience gained in these \ninitiatives  show  that  peace  encourages  the  natural  process  of  economic  integration,  including \n\n                                                 \n18 Initiatives  in  regional  trade  facilitation  include  (i)  the  proposed  South  Asian  Free  Trade  Area  (SAARC),  and  (ii)  the \n\nFramework Agreement on ECO Trade Cooperation. \n\n19 ADB. 2002.

ADB  also  contributes  to  economic  growth, \nthe  comparative \nimproved  employment  opportunities,  and  reduced  poverty  by \nadvantages  of  the  participating  countries.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  subregional  cooperation \ndemonstrates progress and success when collaborating on specific and project-driven activities, \nsuch  as  transport  infrastructure  and  cross-border  facilitation  including  transit,  within  the \nframework  of  existing  relationships.  The  proposed  Project  builds  on  this  experience  by \nintroducing a pilot cross-border development initiative at one major border crossing in Pakistan. \n \n11. \nLessons  in  Project  Implementation.  Implementation  of  the  four  provincial  umbrella \nprojects financed by ADB (para. 9) suffered from fragmented efforts, and coordination problems, \nwhich  led  to  project  implementation  delays.  The  provincial  governments,  including  BPG, \ndemonstrated, however, their capability to implement the projects as envisaged at appraisal with \nthe support of design and construction supervision consultants. Adopting a provincial focus, the \nidentified  weaknesses  in  the  umbrella  projects  were  addressed  in  subsequent  provincial  road \nprojects  for  Sindh  and  Punjab.  Both  projects  are  in  the  early  stages  of  implementation  with \nrecruitment of consultants and procurement actions, and are progressing through with some initial \nstart-up  delays.  These  delays  are  partly  due  to  the  federal  and  provincial  assembly  elections, \nwhich  took  place  last  year  and  led  to  changes  in  the  provincial  governments.  During  project \npreparation,  agreement  was  reached  with  CWD  and  NHA  that  experienced  and  dedicated  staff \nwould be appointed to key project management positions, specifically for positions as project and \ndeputy  project  directors.  Supported  by  project  preparatory TA consultants,  NHA and  BPG have \nadvanced in preparing the project proforma (PC-1). NHA and BPG have also allocated adequate \nresources  for  preconstruction  activities  and  early  procurement  actions, including prequalification \nof civil works contractors.  Project  implementation  will  be  also  be  helped  by  strong support from \nBPG and the chairman of NHA. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n12. \nThe objectives of the Project are to reduce poverty and support pro-poor economic growth \nby  (i)  enhancing access  of  rural  populations  to  economic  opportunities  and  social  services  by \nimproving the province\u2019s road network, (ii) improving trade facilitation and efficiency of the priority \nroad  transport  corridor  linking  Pakistan,  Afghanistan,  and  Central  Asia,  which  crosses \nBalochistan; and (iii) providing essential institutional support and capacity building at CWD. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  inadequate  provincial  connectivity  and  allow  better  access, \n13. \nspecifically  for  the  rural  poor,  to  education  and  health  facilities,  markets,  districts,  and  the \nprovincial cities. The Project will also, together with ongoing and planned road rehabilitation and \nreconstruction  in  Afghanistan,  support  subregional  cooperation  by  (i)  improving  cross-border \nmovements  of  goods  and  passengers  at  the  Chamman  border  crossing  between  Pakistan  and \nAfghanistan,  (ii)  improving  access  to  ports  located  in  southern  Pakistan,  and  (iii)  reducing \ntransport cost through improved road conditions and shorter travel time.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n14. \nThe  Project  includes  four  main  components:  (i)  a  provincial  institutional  development \ncomponent  (PIDC)  supporting  CWD  and  districts,  (ii)  a  provincial  access  component  (PAC) \ncomprising  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  about  1,100  km  of  provincial  roads,  (iii)  a  cross-\nborder development component (CDC), and (iv) a national highway component (NHC) comprising \nrehabilitation  of  247  km  of  national  highways.  As  with  the  two  most  recent  provincial  road \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\nprojects, rehabilitation and construction of the provincial roads will follow a sector approach.24  To \nenhance the poverty impact of the Project and ensure that development benefits reach the people \nliving  along  the  project  roads,  a  complementary  community  support  program  will  be  provided \nthrough  a  TA  loan  (paras.  55-56).  In  addition,  a TA grant will  assist  the  Government  to  review, \ndevelop, and improve trade facilitation measures and prepare a program for increased efficiency \nof cross-border movements of goods and passengers (para. 57). \n \n15. \nThe  PIDC  supports  the  policy  actions,  which  have  been  agreed  upon by  BPG  and  ADB \nand form part of the Project (Appendix 5). These include  (i) reviewing CWD\u2019s institutional setup \nand  arrangements,  including  staffing  and  competence  levels;  (ii)  strengthening  the  core  road \nmanagement functions in CWD's organizational structure, specifically for  planning and executing \nmaintenance; (iii) introducing HDM-4 at CWD and revamping the road asset management system \n(RAMS);  (iv)  strengthening  road  maintenance  processes  and  introducing  performance-based \nmaintenance  contracts;  (v)  reviewing  the  provincial  sources  for  road  maintenance  funding, \nincluding the provincial budgets and availability of funds for road maintenance, and developing a \nroad  user  charge  mechanism  and  establishing  a  road  fund  for  secure  and  stable  funding  of \nmaintenance;  (vi)  increasing  funding  of  maintenance;  (vii)  improving  road  safety;  and  (viii) \nbuilding capacity in environmental and social assessment and resettlement planning.  \n \n16. \nThe CDC focuses on  trade facilitation and draws on recent findings from  the TA (footnote \n20)  on  subregional  cooperation,  especially  with  respect  to  corridor,  port,  and  transport \ndevelopments.  It  also  draws  on  the  findings  of  the  assessment  of  the  current  cross-border \nagreements,  procedures,  and  practices  for  the  countries  in  the  region,  specifically  Pakistan, \nAfghanistan,  Iran,  Tajikistan,  and  Uzbekistan.  The  CDC  complements  assistance  provided  by \nADB on customs modernization and World Bank assistance  that focused on capacity building in \ntrade  facilitation.  The  NHC  supports  subregional  cooperation  through  improvement of the most \nutilized  but  constrained  sections  of  NH25,  which  form  a  component  of  the  Central  Asia-\nAfghanistan-Pakistan corridor, but are in poor condition and suffer from capacity constraints and \npoor  road  safety.  The  NHC  supports  the  continued  implementation  of  the  ongoing  policy  and \ninstitutional reform program for NHA, supported by ADB and World Bank (Appendix 6).25 \n \n\n1. \n\nProvincial Institutional Development Component  \n\nThe  PIDC  draws  on  the  findings  of  TA  provided  by  ADB26 to BPG  and  policy  dialogue \n17. \nbetween  ADB  and  BPG/CWD.  The  PIDC  focuses  on  building  capacity  for  institutional \ndevelopment  and  adoption  of  modern  road  management  practices? specifically  for  road \nmaintenance? and  road  safety.  The  PIDC  supports  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \nbuilding at CWD and  conforms with the devolution program that is currently being undertaken in \nPakistan.  It  includes  consulting  services,  with  capacity  building,  training,  and  provision  of \nessential equipment for CWD. \n \n18. \nConsulting  services  will  be  required  to  (i) strengthen  institutional  capacity  at  CWD  and \ndistrict levels  for  road  maintenance  and  road  safety  functions,  including  training  of  CWD  staff, \ndistrict  staff,  and  trainers;  (ii)  introduce  modern  maintenance  concepts? contracting  out, \nperformance-based maintenance? and prepare maintenance manuals; (iii) prepare a number of \n\n                                                 \n24 A sector loan is deemed appropriate where ADB policy for such  a loan is met. For this loan, (i) Balochistan provincial \ngovernment  (BPG)  has  a  provincial  road  sector  investment  plan  to  meet  the  priority  development  needs,  (ii)  BPG \nthrough the Communication and Works Department (CWD)  has  the  institutional  capacity  to  implement  the  Project, \nand (iii) BPG road sector policies can be improved.  \n\n25 The  World  Bank  is  preparing  a  national  highway  road  project,  which  focus es  on  continued  reform  of  NHA  and \n\nupgrading of national highway 5. \n\n26 ADB. 2002.

These  inputs  are \nimportant for (i) strengthening planning and maintenance functions, and (ii) further developing the \nRAMS.  The  PIDC  also  provides  for  equipment  for  traffic  and  condition  surveys,  which  are \ndeemed important but are currently not available at CWD. \n \n\n2. \n\nProvincial Access Component  \n\n20. \nThe PAC comprises (i) rehabilitation and construction of about 19 provincial roads totaling \nabout 1,100 km, and (ii) a periodic maintenance subcomponent. Following a sector approach, the \nProject  will  rehabilitate  and  construct  about  6  provincial  highways  totaling  about  662  km  and \nabout 13 rural access roads totaling 468 km, which collectively pass through 20 of Balochistan\u2019s \n26  districts,  many  of  which  are  poor  and  are  located  in  less  developed  areas.  Most  of  the \nprovincial roads are located in poor and deprived districts. 28 \n \n21. \nThe provincial roads will generally be widened to 3.7 or 7.3 meters, depending on traffic \ndensity, and provided with  a 2.0- or 2.5-meter-wide shoulders on each side. Wherever possible, \nwidening  will  be  confined  to  one  side  to  minimize  disruption  or  adverse  impacts  and  ease \nconstruction and traffic management. The provincial roads will be designed for surface treatment. \nAs existing alignments will be followed, resettlement and environmental impacts will be minimal.  \n \nThe  provincial  roads  were  identified  and  assessed  under  previous  ADB  TA  financed by \n22. \nloans, and form part of the provincial road master plan. Six (three provincial highways and three \nrural  access  roads)  of  the  53  prescreened  roads,  totaling  about  400  km  and  representing  a \nsample  of  typical  roads  from  Balochistan  and  poor  districts,  were  selected  as  core  roads  for \nfurther evaluation under the same TA (footnote 26) and subsequent detailed design. The selected \ncore provincial roads were subjected to multiple economic and social criteria analyses: economic \nanalysis,  social  analysis,  assessment  of  poverty  reduction  impacts,  and  environmental \nexamination. A number of stakeholders, specifically from the district administrations, poor people, \nroad  users  living  along  or  near  the  roads,  and  NGOs  were  involved  in  the  selection  process. \nInterviews and surveys of several stakeholder groups indicate strong support for rehabilitating the \nselected provincial roads. \n \nPeriodic  Maintenance  Subcomponent.    As  a  pilot  initiative,  this  subcomponent  is \n23. \nintended to finance a 3-year time slice of priority road maintenance activities. For each of the 3 \nyears,  this  component  will  cover  periodic  maintenance  of  an  estimated  500  km  gravel  and \nsurfaced roads to be carried out through maintenance contracts.29 The works will be restricted to \n\n                                                 \n27 Hardware and software. \n28 Based on a district development ranking carried out by the Punjab Economic Research Institute. \n29  The estimated total cost for this subcomponent is $500,000. See Appendix 7. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\nperiodic  maintenance  works  and  will  comprise  mainly  grading  and  leveling  of  gravel  roads.  The \nroads for this component will be selected after completion of prescreening and condition surveys \nby  the  consultants  under  the  PIDC.  The  works  will  be  supervised  by  the  consultants  under  the \nPAC. Since this component is included to encourage BPG to commit more of its annual budget to \nperiodic  maintenance  resources,  the  cost  to  be  met  under  the  ADB  loan will be limited to 30%, \nwhile  the  balance  of  70%  will  be  met  through  BPG  counterpart  funding.  This  component  will \nincrease  awareness  and  understanding  of  road  maintenance,  contribute  to  securing  BPG \nresources for periodic road maintenance, and address the critical backlog in road maintenance. \n \nUnder the PIDC, a mechanism for improved axle load control will be designed. In addition, \n24. \nCWD will pursue  a dedicated information campaign and training  in  close  coordination  with  the \nother BPG departments and agencies responsible for enforcing axle-load control and information, \nsuch  as  the  police,  drivers\u2019  training  centers,  truck  and  bus  owners  and  operators,  road  user \nassociations, and the general public. \n \n\n3. \n\nCross-Border Development Component \n\nThe CDC comprises physical and nonphysical subcomponents. The physical component \n25. \naddresses  the  identified  constraints,  which  specifically  include  lack  of  basic  infrastructure,  and \nscattered  facilities  along  with  inefficient  and  slow  handling  procedures  at  the  border  crossings. \nThe  non-physical  component  includes  a  detailed  review  (under  TA  accompanying  this  loan) \nincluding training by consultants on current cross-border practices covering immigration, customs, \nsecurity, and other cross-border functions and related procedures at the four main border points \nin Pakistan. The review will  be the basis for a detailed analysis and preparation of an action plan \naimed  at  simplifying,  and  relaxing  or  removing  nonphysical  and  nontariff  barriers  within  the \nexisting legal and regulatory framework. In addition, the review will provide inputs for developing \nand  designing  a  new  cross-border  facility  at  Chamman.  The  objective  is  to  improve  efficiency, \nreduce transaction cost, improve service, and reduce waiting times at the border crossing.  Using \nthe  findings  and  recommendations  of  the TA, the design and supervision consultants under the \nNHC will design a new cross-border facility at Chamman, which will be constructed under the civil \nworks contract in the NHC (para. 26). \n \nIt is envisaged that the new cross-border facility at Chamman will perform most or all main \n26. \nfunctions required for efficient cross-border movement of goods, vehicles, and passengers. Staff \nresponsible  for  immigration,  customs,  and  security,  and  staff  providing  banking,  insurance, and \nother services will be located in the new facility.  The new cross-border facility will be constructed \nand equipped with modern systems and equipment. It will comprise a new building, truck parking \nfacilities,  cargo  inspection  sheds,  weigh  bridges,  telephones  and customs system s.  The private \nsector will be invited to provide services and establish complementary storage and other facilities. \nIt is envisaged that the new concept may, at a later stage, be broadened to a joint project with the \nGovernment of Afghanistan with a view that the new facilities might take the form of a one-stop \nshop  operated  jointly  by  the  authorities  on  both  sides  of  the  border.  The component includes \ntraining  the  various  staff;  handling  immigration,  security,  customs,  weigh  stations;  and  other \nfunctions at the cross-border facility, focusing on modern and efficient practices.  Immigration and \ncustoms  officers  will  also  receive  training  in  regulations  governing  the  movement  of  vehicles, \npersons,  and  freight  through  Pakistan  and  in  and  out  of  Afghanistan,  the  duties  payable  on \nvarious types of cargo, the nature of any prohibited cargoes, and measures to improve efficiency \nand reduce time taken to cross the border. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nNational Highway Component  \n\n27. \nFor  the  NHC,  which  will  facilitate  regional  traffic  and  also  improve  connectivity  to \nBalochistan\u2019s provincial road network, 247 km of NH25 will be rehabilitated and widened covering \nthe sections (i) Kalat\u2013Quetta, 130 km, and (ii) Quetta\u2013Chamman, 117 km.  \n \n28. \nThe  national  highways  will  be  7.3  meters  wide  with  a  3.0-meter-wide  shoulder on each \nside.  Wherever  possible,  the widening  will be  confined  to  one  side  to  minimize  disruption  or \nadverse impacts and ease construction and traffic management. The roads will be designed for \nasphalt-concrete  pavements.  As  existing  alignments  will  be  followed,  resettlement  and \nenvironmental impacts will be minimal. Road safety audit will be conducted as part of the update \nof  the  existing  designs.  A  summary  of  the  design  approach  and  technical  standards  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix A.  \n\n29. \nNHA identified the national highways, which were assessed under previous TA and form \npart  of  NHA\u2019s  medium-term  budget  framework  and  approved  investment  plan.  Their  feasibilities \nwere  further  evaluated  and  confirmed  under  TA  (footnote  26),30  and  subjected  to  detailed \ntechnical evaluation and assessment, economic viability analysis, and analysis of poverty, social, \nand environmental impacts.  \n\n30. \nThe  Project  will  install  weigh  stations  at  the  Cham man  border  crossing,  along  with \nequipment  and  related  civil  works.  The  location  and  technical  specifications  will  be  determined \nduring  the  update  of  the  detailed  design  during  implementation  of  the  Project  from  2004.  As  a \nseparate  ongoing  initiative,  NHA  is  implementing  a  road  safety  action  plan  and  an  axle-load \ncontrol  program,  which  also  comprises  a  dedicated  information  campaign  and  training  of \nagencies  responsible  for  enforcement  and  information,  including  the  police,  institutions  for \neducation, drivers\u2019 training centers, truck and bus owners and operators, road user associations, \nand the general public.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nRoad Maintenance \n\n31. \nThe  Project  supports  improved  road  maintenance  with  several  subcomponents  and \nactivities under the PIDC. The medium-term road maintenance needs and funding sources will be \nassessed  and  a  funding  mechanism  designed  and  implemented  under  the  Project.    This  may \ninclude design of a road user charge mechanism that will recover damage caused by heavy truck \ntraffic by charging a maintenance fee or something similar for all heavy vehicles passing strategic \npoints on Balochistan\u2019s road network. Another initiative supported by the Project is strengthening \nof  maintenance  planning  capacity  building,  and  improved  execution  of  maintenance  by \ncontracting  it  out  to  the  private  sector.  The  PIDC  includes  preparation  of  complete  contract \ndocumentation,  including  specifications,  for  bidding out  periodic and routine maintenance to the \nprivate  sector.  In  addition,  contract  documentation  with  specifications  will  be  developed  for \nperformance-based  maintenance  on  a  pilot  basis.  The  objective  is  to  increase  contracted-out \nmaintenance  over  time  so  that  the  share  of  contracted-out  maintenance  to  the  private  sector \nreaches at least 10% by 2005, 20% by 2006, and 40% by 2007.  \n \n\n                                                 \n30 The two selected sections were found to be the most constrained and narrow sections on NH25, but carry the most \ntraffic  of  all  sections  on  NH25.  Most  other  sections  on NH25  have  also  previously  been  widened  to  7.3-meter \ncarriageway plus shoulders. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10\n\n \n\n2. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n32. \nPoor  road  safety  affects  the  many  poor  people  who  live  in  the  project  influence  area. \nAcknowledging  the  importance  of  improving  road  safety  while  taking  into  account  the  provincial \ninstitutional capacity, BPG will prepare, with  the  support of consultants, a provincial road safety \naction plan under the PIDC. Representatives of road user groups,  NGOs, and others? including \nthe most vulnerable to such accidents, the poor pedestrians?  will be consulted. The action plan, \nwhich  will  build  on  and  complement  other  federal  and  provincial  road  safety  programs,  will \ncomprise  a  series  of  preventive  measures,  such  as  education,  information  campaigns  and \ntraining;  and  corrective  measures,  including  enforcing  traffic  safety  regulation  and  introducing \nroad  safety  audits  for  provincial  roads,  to  reduce  the  number  of  road  accidents  in  Balochistan. \nThe  Project  will  provide  support  with  input  from  consultants  under  the  PIDC  and  provision for \nequipment, such as for accident reporting or other requirements, as might be identified in the road \nsafety  action  plan.  It  is  envisaged  that  a  reputable  NGO  will  be  engaged  to  administer  and \ncoordinate  the  work,  which  will  be  carried  out  under  the  action  plan,  and  also  to  assist  in  its \nimplementation when feasible and justified. At the federal level, NHA is undergoing a road safety \nprogram supported by ADB and World Bank (footnote 14). \n \n\n3. \n\nCapacity Building for Environment and Social Assessment   \n\n33. \nCWD lacks staff, expertise, and capacity to carry out environment and social assessment. \nTo  address  this  constraint,  CWD  has  agreed  to  establish  the  Road  Environment  and  Social \nAssessment Cell (RESAC). RESAC is expected to carry out many functions for the environment, \nand  social  safeguards  and  assessment  for  the  road  sector.  However,  RESAC  lacks  staff, \nexpertise, and capacity to carry out environment and social assessment. To ensure  that RESAC \nachieves its intended role and function, a program with action to enhance the capacity of this unit \nwill be developed and implemented under the Project. A consultant team on social development, \ngender, resettlement, and environment under the PIDC will help CWD prepare and implement the \ninstitutional enhancement program.  \n \n\n4. \n\nSubregional Cooperation \n\nThe Project is the first  in Pakistan, which, together with other ongoing and planned road \n34. \nprojects  in  Afghanistan,  supports  subregional  cooperation  through  physical  and  nonphysical \nimprovements  of  critical  sections  of  NH25,  which  form  part  of  the  transport  corridor  of  Central \nAsia-Afghanistan-Pakistan  that  passes  through  Balochistan.  Apart  from  providing  improved \naccess  to  ports  in  southern  Pakistan,  the  Project  will  also  facilitate  the  economic  and  social \ndevelopment  of  the  transport  corridor  area  through  improved  access  and  easier  movement  of \npeople and goods, and these help reduce poverty and support pro-poor economic growth. Other \nnontransport-related  initiatives,  including  those  by  other  aid  agencies,  will  provide  linkages  to \nrealize the corridor concept and support area development along that corridor. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates  \n\nThe  estimated  cost  of  the  Project  is  $267.3  million  equivalent,  including  civil  works, \n35. \nequipment,  consulting  services,  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  institutional  support  to  CWD and \nthe  project  management  unit,  taxes,  customs,  and  contingencies.  The  cost  comprises  $162.5 \nmillion  in  foreign  exchange  (60.8%  of  the  total)  including  $8.0  million  for  interest  during \nconstruction,  and  $104.8  million  equivalent  (39.2%)  in  local  currency.

The loan will have a \n25-year term including a grace period of 5  years, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 0.5% (the fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such other \nterms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements.  The  Government  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the  reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were \nits  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n \n\nSource \n\n \nADB \nGovernment \nTotal \n\nADB.

The  country  is  one  of  the  poorest  in  the  world  and  the  federal  Government  and  BPG \nhave  difficulty  mobilizing  sufficient  funds  from  their  own  resources  to  meet  all  development \ncommitments,  including  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  critical  physical  and  social  infrastructure. \nAlthough  the  need  to  generate  domestic  resources  to  finance  investments  for  sustaining \neconomic  growth  is  well  recognized,  the  country  has  not  yet  developed  the  resource  base \nnecessary to  adequately  finance  without external assistance  the  required  level  of  investments. \nUnder the current circumstances, a large investment-savings gap will continue exerting pressure \non  development  program.  Thus, external support is needed to meet some of the local currency \ncosts  of  projects.  In  line  with  ADB's  policy  to  help  provide  local  currency  cost  financing, \nparticularly  for  projects  that  address  priority  poverty  concerns  in  economically  less  developed \nregions, about 12.5 % of the loan will be for that purpose. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management  \n\n38. \nCWD will be the Executing Agency for the PIDC and the PAC (Supplementary Appendix \nB).  The  secretary  of  CWD  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for  project  implementation.  The \nadditional  chief  secretary  for  development  will  chair  a  steering  group comprising senior staff of \nBPG and CWD, which will guide the CWD institutional strengthening program and the action plan \nforming  part  of  the  policy  matrix  agreed  upon  with  ADB.  The  core  project  management  unit, \n(PMU)  through  the  Project  Engineering  Cell,  will  be  responsible  for  project  management.  The \nPMU  already  established by CWD  is  headed  by  a  project  director.  The  project  director  will  be \nsupported by other staff including two deputies who will be in charge of day-to-day administration \nof  the  provincial  roads.  While  the  PMU  has  experience  with  ADB-financed  projects  and  is \ngenerally capable, some institutional strengthening is required to ensure effective implementation. \nThus,  the  PMU  will  be  supported  by  institutional  consultants  under  the  Project  as  well  as  by \ndesign  and  construction  supervision  consultants. The  institutional  consultants  will  support  the \nPMU  in  project  management,  supervision  of  short-term  consultants  under  the  PIDC, contract \nadministration, and project preparatory work, while the design and supervision consultants will be \nresponsible  for  construction  supervision  in  accordance  with  the  Federation  International  des \nIngenieurs-Conseils (FIDIC) conditions. The consultants will help build capacity at CWD and PMU \nto  effectively  manage  and  implement  all  project  components,  specifically  the  civil  works  and \nresettlement  plans,  and  prepare  subprojects  for  the  provincial  roads  component.  Early in  their \nwork,  the  institutional consultants  will  prepare  project  preparation  and  implementation  manuals. \nThe implementation arrangements for the PIDC and the PAC are shown in Appendix 8.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\n \n\n39. \nNHA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  CDC  and  the  NHC  (Supplementary  Appendix \nC). The NHA Chairman will chair a steering group, comprising senior staff members of NHA, who \nwill guide in implementing the NHC. While NHA will be responsible for design and construction of \nthe  new  cross-border  facility  under  the  CDC,  the  secretary of  the  Ministry  of  Communications  \n(MOC),  in  consultation  with  the  existing  Task  Force  on  Trade  Facilitation  (chaired  by  Joint \nSecretary,  Ministry  of  Commerce),  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  the  other  parts  of  the \nCDC,   specifically  for  planning  the  structure,  authority  and  procedures  for  operating  the  new \ncross-border facility. NHA has already appointed a project director and has experience with ADB-\nfinanced  projects.  It  is  capable  of  implementing  the  Project  with  support  of  the  construction \nsupervision consultants. The implementation arrangements for the CDC and the NHA are shown \nin Appendix 9.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Preparation for the Provincial Access Component \n\n40. \nThe core provincial roads are prescreened  and meet criteria that are acceptable to ADB. \nSpecifically, the core roads must have been found technically feasible, economically justified, and \nsocially  and  environmentally  responsible.  Most  of  the  data  needed  for  selecting  and  prioritizing \nthese roads were prepared under project preparatory and technical assistance and loan-financed \nTA. The full data and documentation required for approval of all subprojects are not yet available \nand  data  will  be  prepared  under  the  Project.  While  the  subproject  roads  will  be  selected  at  the \ndiscretion of BPG, ADB approval will be required before tendering for road improvement.   \n \n41. \nCWD will  submit  to ADB only  subprojects  that  meet  the  criteria  for  financing  under  the \nloan (Appendix 10). The list of prescreened candidate subprojects is in Supplementary Appendix \nD.  Each  subproject  should  (i)  be  economically  viable,  (ii)  be  technically  feasible,  (iii)  be \nenvironmentally  and  socially  responsible,  (iv)  be  screened  for  environmental  impacts,  (v)  be \nselected based on prioritized district development ranking, (vi) be selected and designed to avoid \nor minimize resettlement (a resettlement plan should be prepared where needed), (vii) be part of \nthe  provincial  road  master  plan,  (viii)  be  in  compliance  with  all  applicable  ADB  guidelines,  (ix) \nhave  received  all  BPG  and  other  approvals,  (x)  have  sufficient  counterpart  funding,  (xi)  have \nbudget provided for operation and maintenance of the road, and (xii) have district commitment to \nmaintenance  of  that  road.  CWD  will  seek  ADB  approval  by  submitting  a  request  for  subproject \napproval that will include (i) a cover sheet; (ii) a basic data sheet; (iii) a location map; (iv) an initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  or  environmental  impact  assessment, as appropriate,  in ADB \nformat; (v) the BPG environment approval; and (vi) a resettlement plan, in a format acceptable to \nADB. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n42. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years,  including  preconstruction  activities.  A \nsummary implementation schedule, based on a detailed schedule prepared by NHA, CWD, and \nADB,  is  in  Appendix  11.  The  schedule  assumes  that  the  project  loan  will  be  approved  in \nNovember 2003 and be effective by 1 February 2004. The two national highways and the six core \nprovincial roads will be ready for contract awards in June 2004. The subprojects for the noncore \nprovincial  roads  will  be  implemented  in  subsequent  phases,  going  through  subproject \npreparation, bidding and award of civil works, and construction.  \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n43. \nGoods  and  related  services  and  civil  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  for  the  national  highway  component  will  be  procured \nthrough  four  contract  packages  following  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  among \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\nprequalified  bidders.  ICB  will  be  followed  for  all  civil  works  contracts  with  an  estimated  value \nexceeding $3 million. Civil works contracts with an estimated value equal to or below $3 million \nwill follow local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB, with separate prequalification. \nContracts for goods and related services estimated to cost in excess of $500,000  will be subject \nto  ICB.  The  provincial  roads  entail  about  12  contracts  for  civil  works,  each  with  an  estimated \nvalue  of  $1.0  million  to  $10  million.  Equipment  will  be  procured  under  international  shopping \nprocedures. International shopping procedures will be followed for supply contracts valued at less \nthan $500,000 equivalent and direct purchase procedures will be followed for items valued at less \nthan  $100,000.  NHA  and  CWD  have  agreed  to  include  the  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy31  in  all  bidding  documents  and  contracts.  In  July  2003,  ADB  approved \nCWD\u2019s  request  for  advance  action  for  procurement.  BPG  and  CWD  were  advised  that  such \napproval  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project.  Contract  packages  for  the  national \nhighways and the core provincial roads are in Appendix 12.  \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n44. \nThe  Project  will  require  250  person-months  of  international  and  4,509  person-months of \ndomestic  consulting  services  for  (i)  institutional  development  with  capacity  building  under  the \nPIDC,  (ii)  construction  supervision  of  the  civil  works  for  the  national  highways,  and  (iii)  detailed \ndesign and construction supervision for civil works for the provincial roads. All consultants will be \nselected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  The  quality-  and  cost-\nbased  selection  procedure  will  be  followed  in  selecting  consulting  firms.  Both  NHA  and  CWD \nhave  agreed  to  include  the  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  in  all  invitations  for \nbidding documents and contracts.   \n \n45. \nADB and CWD have agreed on the objectives and the scope of the consulting services for \ninstitutional development and capacity building under the PIDC. The scope includes support and \ncapacity  building  in  project  management,  road  maintenance  and  development  of  a  RAMS, and \nsupport services to the PMU including preparation of subprojects in a format acceptable to ADB. \nConsulting services will be provided by an international firm in association with a domestic firm. \nThe approximate staffing inputs will be about 78 person-months of international and 200 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants. The overall period of the services will be about 48 months. The \nsummary terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n46. \nCWD will engage one consulting firm for design and construction supervision of provincial \nroads. Staffing inputs will be about 101  person-months of international and 3,202 person-months \nof domestic consultants. The overall period of  services will be about 72 months. Furnished office \nfacilities,  utilities,  vehicles,  and  equipment  required  by  the  construction  supervision  consultants \n(CSCs) will be provided under the Project. Field offices, material testing laboratories with utilities, \nand vehicles required by construction inspectors will be supplied through the civil works contracts \nfor  the  provincial  roads,  as  appropriate.  The  summary  terms  of  reference  are  given  in \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \nNHA will engage one international firm in association with a domestic firm for construction \n47. \nsupervision of national highways.  Staffing inputs will be about 71 person-months of international \nand  1,107  person-months  of  domestic  consultants.  The  overall  period  of  the  services  will  be \nabout  72  months.  Furnished  office  facilities,  utilities,  vehicles,  and  equipment  required  by  the \nCSCs will be provided under the Project. Field offices, material testing laboratories with utilities, \nand vehicles required by construction inspectors will be supplied through the civil works contracts \n\n                                                 \n31 ADB. 1998.

The summary terms of reference are in Supplementary \nAppendix G.  \n \n \n \nOn 14 July 2003,  ADB approved advance action for recruiting project consultants and for \n48. \npreconstruction  activities  for  the  civil  works.  The  Mission  has  advised  NHA  and  BPG  that  any \nsuch approval would not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n \n \n49. \nAll  disbursement  procedures  under  the  loan  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (January 2001). Direct payment procedures will be followed for consulting services and \nthe  civil  works  under  ICB.  Imprest  account  procedures  will  be  used  for  the  local  bidding  for  civil \nworks for CWD and also for CWD\u2019s incremental expenditures under the loan. The imprest account \nwill  be  established  in  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan.  The  initial  advance  will  not  exceed  the \nestimated expenditures for 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The statement \nof expenditure procedure will be used for all payments and contracts under $50,000 equivalent.   \n \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\nAccounts, Audit, and Reports \n\na. \n\nAccounts and Audit \n\n50. \nNHA and  CWD  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  the  goods  and \nservices financed by the loan proceeds, the financing sources received, the expenditures incurred, \nand use of local funds. The accounts will be set up in accordance with sound accounting principles. \nExternal  accounting  experts  will  be  engaged  to  design  project  accounts  to  be  used  by  NHA  and \nCWD.  Consolidated  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  by \nprivate sector auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited reports and related financial statements in \nEnglish will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which \nthey  relate.  The  director-general  of  audits  will  coordinate  all  account  activities  and  ensure \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s audit and accounting requirements. ADB will review and follow up on these \nmatters as necessary.  \n \n51. \nAll  procurement  and  disbursement  activities  will  be  subject  to  independent  performance \naudit  to  ensure  transparency, and objective and independent assessment of such activities. The \nperformance audit will be conducted three times during project implementation in conjunction with \nthe annual audit of project accounts and financial statements and will be carried out by the same \nexternal auditors. In addition, ADB will conduct project procurement and disbursement audits during \nimplementation as part of its regular review. Both NHA and BPG have agreed to combat corruption \nin the road sector, including the procurement of contracts, by preparing an anticorruption strategy \nfor the road sector,  in consultation with civil society and anticorruption agencies in Pakistan and \nADB.  The  strategy  will  be  prepared  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  NHA  and  BPG  will \nimplement the strategy during the remaining project implementation period. \n \n\nb. \n\nReports \n\n52. \nBefore starting  the  civil  works  under  the  Project,  NHA  and  CWD  will  provide  ADB  with \nmonthly progress reports on the status of preconstruction activities. These reports , due at the end \nof each month, will be sent in electronic form. When the PMUs and the CSCs have been appointed, \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\nthey  will  prepare  monthly  progress  and  quarterly  reports32  for  NHA,  CWD,  PMUs  and  ADB.  The \nformat of the reports will be discussed and agreed upon before consulting services starts . Once the \nworks have been completed, NHA  and CWD will arrange for the consultants to submit a project \ncompletion report within 3 months of the physical completion of the Project. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n53. \nBoth NHA and CWD, with the assistance of the PMUs and the CSCs, will separately carry \nout project performance and benefit monitoring and evaluation (M&E) by compiling and analyzing \nappropriate traffic, socioeconomic, and other data for the project roads. This evaluation will follow \nADB\u2019s Project Performance Management Systems Handbook. For this purpose, a baseline survey \nfor  one  national  highway  and  three  provincial  roads  (comprising  provincial  highway,  secondary \nand/or access road) will be undertaken. This will be followed by data collection and other surveys \nduring implementation and immediately after these project roads have been completed and handed \nover.  The  findings  and  supporting  data  will  be  incorporated  into  the  project  completion  report. \nSystems  for  recording  data  and  statistics  for  such  monitoring  will  be  established  as  part  of  the \nproject implementation arrangements with assistance of the PMUs and the CSCs. NHA and CWD, \nassisted by the consultants will evaluate the benefits of the Project in accordance with a schedule \nand terms of reference to be agreed upon with ADB. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n54. \nADB  will  conduct  regular  reviews  throughout  project  implementation.  Midway  through \nProject  implementation  (end-2006),  ADB,  NHA,  and  CWD  will  review  the  Project  and  its \nimplementation status in detail. The review will cover the entire scope of the Project to determine \nwhether  any  adjustments  in  the  proposed  procurement  and  management  arrangements  are \nneeded.  The  review  will  also  address  any  outstanding  procurement  problems,  and  financing and \nscheduling matters. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN \n\n55. \nTo  enhance  the  poverty  impact  of  the  Project,  and  to  ensure  that  maximum  possible \ndevelopment benefits reach the people living along the project roads and that the resources they \nrely  on  are  protected  and  developed  in  a  sustainable  way,  additional  provincial  support  will  be \nprovided  through  a  TA  loan.  The  TA  will  support  devolution  and  assist  BPG  and  the  district \nadministration  in  enhancing  the  project  benefits   to  the  poor.  The  TA  will  have  three  parts:  (i) \ndeveloping  community  infrastructure  and  empowering  communities,  and  (ii)  strengthening  of \nsocial protection and  education,  and  (iii) monitoring  and measuring  poverty  and  social  impacts. \nThe  initiatives  under  the  TA  loan  are  to  be  selected  in  a  participatory  process  involving  the \ncommunities  and  the  district  administration  from  the  provincial  roads,  which  are  located  in  the \npoorest  districts  in  Balochistan.  The  TA  loan  will  be  implemented  over  4  years,  with  expenditure \ncommencing at the start of FY2004. The objectives, tentative scope, financing, and implementation \narrangements  are  in  Appendix  13.  The  TA  loan  will  be  executed  by  CWD  and  implemented  by \nreputable NGOs, with CWD support and close coordination with the district administrations. \n \n56. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  loan  is  estimated  to  be  about  $1.25 million. ADB will finance all \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  a  portion  of  the  local  currency  costs.  ADB  will  provide  one  loan \nequivalent to SDR 701,000 million [$1.0 million equivalent] from its Special Funds resources with a \nmaturity  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  with  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  thereafter;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \n\n                                                 \n32 The quarterly report will also include data on project performance monitoring and benefit monitoring. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\n \n\nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  TA  Loan  Agreement.  Consulting \nservices  may  be  provided  by  one  or  more  consulting  firms  or  individual  consultants  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB.  \n \n\nV. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANT \n\n \n57. \nTo  support  the  Project  and  assist  in  improving  trade  facilitation,  the  Government  has \nrequested TA to prepare a  program for more efficient cross-border operations and to establish a \npilot  cross-border  facility.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is estimated at $630,000, comprising foreign \nexchange  of  $285,000  and  local  currency  of  $345,000  equivalent.  The  Government  has \nrequested  ADB  to  finance  $500,000  equivalent,  including  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and \n$215,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost;  the  Government  will  finance  the  balance  of  the \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nTA scope, implementation arrangements, outline terms of reference, cost estimates and financing \nplan are outlined in Appendix 14. \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits  \n\nThe economic analysis (Appendix 15) of the national highways shows economic internal \n58. \nrates of return (EIRRs)  of 37.7% and 40.4%, respectively. The economic analysis of the six core \nprovincial roads shows EIRRs of 14.8\u201348.9%. The sensitivity analysis shows that the EIRRs for \nall evaluated roads are above 12% and quite robust.  \n \n59. \nEconomic  analysis  was  carried  out  using  the  highway  design  and  maintenance  (HDM) \nsoftware.  The  model  evaluates  project  investments  considering  capital  and  recurrent  costs  as \nwell  as  the  benefits  derived  from  savings  in  road  user  costs  for  the  with-project and  without-\nproject cases.  Economic  analysis  assumed  the  project  life  to  be  20  years.  Two  improvement \noptions  were  considered,  i.e.,  asphaltic  concrete  overlay  and  surface  dressing  for  different \npermutations of traffic levels and road roughness conditions. The main quantifiable benefits of the \nproject are (i) savings on vehicle operating costs (VOC) for existing traffic, and (ii) VOC savings \nfor  generated  traffic  because  of  improvements  in  road  surface  conditions.  In  addition, \nnonquantifiable benefits will arise from improved access to markets, which will boost agricultural \neconomic  activities;  reduced  agricultural  input  costs  because  of  better  transport  facilities; \nimproved access to health, education,  and other social sector facilities; and subregional benefits \narising from improved trade facilitation and reduced delays at border crossings.  \n \nB. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impact \n\n60. \nThe  overall  poverty  level  in  Balochistan  is  reported  at  39.1%  of  which  43.7%  is for  rural \nareas and 29.5%  for  urban  areas  (para.  4). While the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper of the \nGovernment reports the overall poverty figure in Balochistan at 41-47%, about 50% of the rural \nvillages  in  Balochistan  have  no  or  very  poor  road  access.  Around  76%  of  the  population  in \nBalochistan live in rural areas, where the incidence of poverty approached almost 50% before the \nrecent drought, and now may be approaching 70% in drought stricken rural areas, compared with \nabout 35% of the rural population living below the poverty line for Pakistan as a whole. Data for \nBalochistan  is  questionable  as  the  low  population  density  makes  sampling  difficult,  but  the \nhousehold  survey  results  indicate  that  poverty  levels  among  households  sampled  for  the \nprovincial roads are on average 53%. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\n61. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  a  poverty  intervention  and  will  directly  reduce  poverty  by \nlowering  the  costs  of  transport  for  the  poor  traveling  to  farmers\u2019  markets,  labor  markets,  health \nand education centers, and other social and public services. According to the conducted poverty \nassessment,  the  Project  will  have  a  large  effect  on  reducing  poverty,  directly  benefiting \napproximately 500,000 people in 19 districts living adjacent to the roads. Of these, an estimated \n200,000 poor people will be direct beneficiaries. Many more will benefit in the long run from the \nlower transport costs and induced economic and social development.  \n \n62. \nThe  estimated  poverty  impact  ratios  of  the  core  roads  range  from  26%  to  over  100%  of \nthe net economic benefits accruing to the poor for the Project as a whole, with most roads having \nbetween  30%  and  50%.  Such  benefits  will  become  evident  in  higher  agricultural  product  profit \nmargins  for  poor  farmers,  as  well  as  lower  cost  and  more  timely  access  to  schools,  medical \nclinics,  and  employment  centers.  Furthermore,  the  lower  transport  costs  will  increase  mobility \namong the poor and help them find employment opportunities in other areas. \n \n63. \nThe  Project  will  generate  significant  employment  opportunities  for  skilled  and  unskilled \nlabor during  implementation.  Unskilled  labor  (males  and  females)  will  be  employed  directly  in \nroad  construction  and  maintenance  and  indirectly  by  providing  materials  and  services  to  the \nconstruction and maintenance activities. The Project will generate for unskilled labor employment \nopportunities of approximately 22,560 person-months for national highways and 31,560 person-\nmonths  for  provincial  and  rural  roads.  The  Project  will  have  positive  externalities,  which  will \nimprove the livelihood of the poor.  The poverty reduction aspects of the Project will be enhanced \nby encouraging contractors to engage local workers in project areas and providing first priority to \nthe poor and disadvantaged in the actual construction of provincial roads. \n \nC. \n\nSocial Dimensions and Impacts \n \n64. \nThe  social  dimensions  of  the  Project,  including  stakeholder  participation  and  equity \nconsideration,  are  designed  to  facilitate  more  pro-poor  and  equitable  distribution  benefits.  The \nProject will adopt a participatory approach  to  effectively implement the resettlement plan and an \nawareness campaign on road safety issues.  The  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  did  not \nidentify indigenous people or minorities because of the insular nature of some communities,  and \nan indigenous people\u2019s development plan (IPDP) is not required. Small groups of affected people \nwere  interviewed  to  determine  their  aspirations  and  their  likely  reaction  to  the  road.  Support  for \nthe  roads  was  universal,  with  all  groups  identifying  positive  outcomes.  The  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 16. \n \n65. \nAs part of institutional reform, the Project will strengthen the capacity of  CWD to address \npoverty,  environment,  social  safeguard,  and  social  development  issues  in  the  transport  sector. \nGender awareness training will be  given  to  CWD  staff  at  provincial  and  district  levels.  Gender-\ndisaggregated  data  will  be  collected  through  the  baseline  project  performance  management \nsystem survey as well as in subsequent surveys to be conducted at midterm and completion of \nthe project. \n \nIn  compliance  with  Government  and  international  core  labor  standards,  CWD  will  be \n66. \nstrengthened to monitor the implementation of labor laws, particularly  the issues of equal pay for \nequal work between women and men workers; prohibition of child labor; and provisions on health, \nsanitation, and appropriate working conditions, including accommodation, where appropriate, for \nconstruction workers at campsites during the construction period. A number of covenants related \nto this issue will be incorporated in the loan agreement. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\n \n\n67. \nThe Project was developed with a view to avoid or minimize the need for land acquisition \nand  involuntary  resettlement.  A  full  census  was  conducted  of  all  affected  people,  land, \nstructures/assets  on  the  right-of-way  for  the  two  national  highways  and  the  six  core \nrepresentative  subprojects  for  the  provincial  roads  component,  including  a  25%  socioeconomic \nsample survey for resettlement planning. The Project will require acquisition of approximately 42 \nhectares for the two national highways and six core provincial roads, and will likely affect about \n487 people  as  a  consequence  of  land acquisition.  Widening  and  improvement  will  affect  143 \nstructures  (80  shops  or  small  business  enterprises,  39  residential  houses,  and  24  other \nstructures).  The  estimated  cost  for  land  acquisition,  compensation,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring  is  approximately  $4  million  equivalent.  A  summary  resettlement  plan  is  presented in \nAppendix  17.  The  summary  in  local  language  and  in  English  will  be  distributed  to  the  affected \npeople  by  NHA  and  BPG  and  through  NHA  and  ADB  web  sites.  The  complete  plan  will  be \npublicly  available  at  NHA,  CWD,  and  at  ADB's  Pakistan  Resident  Mission.  The  remaining \nsubprojects (provincial roads) will be selected during  implementation. The requirements of ADB\u2019s \npolicy  on  involuntary  resettlement  for  preparing  the  sector  loan  necessitated  a  resettlement \nframework (Appendix  18)  for all subprojects.  A  resettlement  plan for each remaining subproject \nwill be prepared and approved by BPG and submitted to ADB for approval. \n \nD. \n \n68. \nIn  accordance  with  ADB's  requirements  on  environmental  assessment,  an  IEE  was \nprepared for the two national highways and the six core provincial roads. The IEE  (Appendix 19) \nshows that, generally, the Project will not cause significant environmental problems and  with the \nmitigation measures, potential adverse impacts are manageable. The Project will comply with all \nADB environmental assessment requirements. The environmental mitigation measures during the \nconstruction phase will be incorporated into the bidding documents for civil works, and NHA and \nCWD will be responsible for overall environmental management in their respective components.  \n  \nE. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Measures \n\nProject Risks  \n\n69. \nA  potential  risk  is  the  delays  in  project  preparation  and  start-up activities and necessary \napprovals by NHA and BPG. This risk will be mitigated through approval of advance actions by \nNHA  and  BPG  and  adequate  allocation  of  staff  and  other  resources.  The  PMUs  are  already \nestablished  at  NHA  and  CWD  and  have  been  sufficiently  staffed  and  empowered  with \nexperienced staff. An implementation unit is also being established at MOC for execution of the \nTA grant. \n \n70. \nAnother risk is lack of project sustainability due to inadequate maintenance. This risk has \nbeen addressed by the asset management and maintenance activities forming part of the Project. \nNHA and BPG are committed  to provide sufficient and increased funding for road maintenance, \nincluding  increasingly  contracting out  maintenance  to  the  private  sector.  Maintenance  forms  a \ncentral and integral part of the PIDC and NHA and BPG will take the necessary steps to increase \nfunding for maintenance and introduce new maintenance concepts and procedures.  \n \nNHA  and  BPG  are  committed  to  reform  of  their  institutions.  While  NHA  is  undergoing  a \n71. \nreform program supported by ADB, BPG has agreed with ADB on a set of institutional and other \nreform  measures,  covering  institutional  development  with  capacity  building  and  improved \nmaintenance and road safety, with measurable targets. Consultants will support BPG and CWD \nto introduce institutional reform measures and to build capacity. The risks of failure or slowdown \nin reform are therefore considered manageable.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20\n\n \n\n72. \nThe  recent  history  of  conflict  in  the  region  and  related  incidents  or  threats  is  a  potential \nrisk for the project. The federal and provincial governments are aware of this risk and have taken \nmeasures to manage it as far as is possible. \n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government,  NHA,  BPG,  and  CWD  have \n\n73. \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n74. \n \n\nEnvironment. NHA and BPG will ensure the following: \n\n(i) \n\nRoad  construction  and  maintenance  will  be  carried  out  as  required  under  the \nGovernment's  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nguidelines including (a) appropriate selection of quarry and borrow sites and their \nrehabilitation after use; (b) proper disposal of soils and construction materials; (c) \nuse of sound environmental design and construction techniques that ensure slope \nstability and drainage; and (d) minimization of construction impacts such as dust, \ndiversion of stream flow and increased turbulence, and equipment noise. \n\n \n(ii)  When project roads pass through or near protected or sensitive areas (e.g., nature \nreserves, parks, conservation areas, biodiversity reserves, or cultural and historical \nsites),  rapid  assessment  will  be  carried  out  before  any  construction  work  starts. \nBPG  will  ensure  cooperation  with  the  responsible  authority  in  preparing  and \nimplementing protective measures, which may include area demarcation, fencing, \ncheckpoints,  speed  bumps,  wildlife  passage  zones,  patrols  or  other  measures  to \nprotect  the  area  from  encroachment  or  environmental  degradation  due  to  road \nimprovement and increased access.  \n\n \n75. \nResettlement. NHA and BPG will ensure that land acquisition and resettlement activities \nare  implemented  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  policy on \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  as  set  out  in  the  agreed-upon resettlement plans  for  core  subprojects \nand  resettlement framework (Appendix  18)  for  noncore  subprojects,  including  the  following: (i) \nland and rights-of-way will be acquired in a proper and timely manner; (ii) compensation will be \nprovided at replacement cost and entitlements as stipulated in the resettlement plan, with ADB\u2019s \npolicy  to  prevail  in  case  of  any  difference  with  the  Government's  laws  and  regulations;  (iii) \ncounterpart funds and disbursements will be provided promptly to affected people, with agreed-\nupon compensation given to them before any land is taken or civil works contracts awarded, and \nthe  Project  will  not  use  any  emergency  provisions  that  allow  land  to  be  taken  in  advance  of \npayment;  (iv)  NHA  and  CWD  have  guaranteed  to  meet  unforeseen  obligations  in  excess  of \nbudget  estimates;  (v)  NHA  and  CWD  will  implement  adequate  supervision,  monitoring,  and \nreporting;  (vi)  a  competent  independent  agency  will  be  in  charge  of  external  M&E;  (vii) \nresettlement  fund  disbursements  and  expenditures  will  be  audited  annually;  (viii)  adequate \ninformation dissemination to and consultation with affected people will be done; (ix) consultation \nand  grievances  will  be  documented;  (x)  resettlement  plans  will  be  updated  if  the  scope  of  the \nProject is changed; and (xi) progress will be regularly reported to ADB.  \n \nGrievance and Redress Mechanism. The Borrower  will  cause  CWD  and  NHA  to  form \n76. \nwithin  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness  an  independent  committee  consisting  of  individuals \nunrelated to the Project to hear any grievance or other complaint relating to resettlement issues. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f21 \n\n \n\nThe committee will hold a public hearing of any  grievance or complaint filed with it and make its \nrecommendations for redress, if any, within 45 days of receipt of the complaint. \n \n77. \nHealth Risks and Provisions.  NHA  and  BPG  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works  contracts \ninclude an information and education campaign on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS 33 \nfor  construction  workers  as  part  of  the  health  and  safety  program  at  campsites  during  the \nconstruction  period.  NHA  and  BPG  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works  contracts  include  legally \nmandated  provisions  on  health,  sanitation,  and  appropriate  working  conditions,  including \naccommodation,  and  clean  drinking  water  for  construction  workers  at  campsites  during  the \nconstruction period. \n \n78. \nIllegal  Trafficking  of  Women,  Children,  and  Goods.    The Borrower  will  ensure that \nNHA  and  CWD  enact  measures,  satisfactory  to  ADB, to  prevent,  monitor,  detect,  and  arrest \nillegal  trafficking  of  women  and  children  and  illegal  movement  of  goods.  NHA  and  CWD  will \nsubmit to ADB quarterly reports summarizing issues addressed, progress made, and future plans \nfor action. \n \nLabor  Laws.  NHA  and  BPG  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \n79. \napplicable  labor  and  worker  safety  laws,  and  do  not  employ  children  in construction activities. \nNHA and BPG will set employment targets for women for road construction  activities acceptable \nto ADB and will cause  contractors to adhere to such targets. The Government will provide equal \nopportunity  for  women  for  road  construction  activities,  and  will  not  allow  contractors  to \ndifferentiate wages for men and women for work of equal value. A specific clause to this effect will \nbe  included  in  bidding  documents,  and  compliance  will  be  strictly  monitored  during  project \nimplementation.  \n \n80. \nAnticorruption. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves the right to  investigate  directly, or through its agents,  any possible \nfinancial or management impropriety in conducting the Project. The Government, NHA, BPG, and \nCWD  agree  to  fully  cooperate  with  any  such  investigation  and  extend  all  necessary  assistance, \nincluding  access  to  all  relevant  books  and  records  as  well  as  engagement  by  NHA  or  CWD  of \nindependent  experts  that  may  be  needed  for  satisfactory  completion  of  such  investigations. All \nexternal costs related to the  investigations will be borne by the Project. Within 6 months of loan \neffectiveness,  BPG  and  NHA  will  also  prepare  an  anticorruption  strategy,  which  will  be \nimplemented during the project implementation period. \n \nProject Management.  In  order  to  ensure  continuity,  transparency,  efficiency  and  good \n81. \nmanagement, NHA, BPG and CWD will consult with ADB on matters related to management of \nthe Project. All matters relating to selection or appointment, or any changes to such selection or \nappointment, of any project director or deputy project director, will be duly notified to ADB.    \n \n82. \nRESAC.

Road transport is the dominant mode of transport, and carries 90% of \nall  passenger  traffic  and  95%  of  all  freight  traffic.  Road  transport  services  are  largely  in  the \nprivate sector1 and are subject to strong competition. During the 1990s, the overall demand for \nroad  transport  grew  at  7\u20138%  per  year  while  the  average  GDP  grew  at  4\u20135%. The number of \nregistered motor vehicles is 4.2 million and is growing at 8% annually. Pakistan\u2019s national road \nnetwork extends some 250,000 kilometers (km)? of which 60% is paved? and has grown about \n4.5% annually during the last decade.  \n \nA  total  of  PRs207  billion  was  raised  in  revenues  from  the  road  sector  through  a \n2. \ncombination  of  general  revenue  taxes  and  user  charges  over  the  5-year  period  1995-2000. \nNational  and  provincial  highway  expenditures  totaled  PRs118  billion  over  that  period.  The \nbalance? PRs89 billion (43%)? was contributed to the government\u2019s general revenue. \n \nB. \n\nNational Highway System \n\nNational  Highway  Authority  (NHA) . \n\n3. \nNetwork.  The  national  highway  (NH)  network  comprises  about  8,500  km  of  national \nhighways  and  motorways,2  and  carries  75-80%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  commercial  traffic.  The  main \ndomestic  artery  is  concentrated  along  the  Karachi\u2013Lahore\u2013Peshawar corridor, which is 1,670 \nkm  long.  It  serves  80%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  urban  population  and  carries  over  55%  of  the  country\u2019s \nintercity  traffic.  A  detailed  condition  survey  carried  out  in  2001  indicates  that  50%  of  the  NH \nnetwork is in poor to very poor condition.3 Some of the poor sections are located on the main \ninternational  arteries  (NH5  and  NH25),  connecting  Pakistan  with  Afghanistan  and  providing \naccess to ports in southern Pakistan.   \n \nfor  operation, \n4. \nmaintenance,  and  development  of  the  NH  system,  is  an  autonomous  highway  agency  with  a \nfunctional  structure  and  decentralized  implementation  through  regional  offices  at  provincial \nlevels. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank have provided assistance4 to \nreorganize  and  commercialize  NHA,  shifting  its  focus  toward  a  network  operator  and  service \nprovider role and strengthening NHA\u2019s financial management systems to  improve governance. \nNHA has, however, internal capacity constraints, such as limited in-house capability in strategic \nplanning, project and asset management, and network operation. The use of modern road asset \nmanagement and maintenance systems (including HDM-4) for operation and maintenance need \nto be fully institutionalized and integrated in the day-to-day  operations.5 Until recently, the four \nprovincial highway departments were responsible for some 90,000 km of roads. Some parts of \nthat  network  are  now  being  transferred  to  the  district  administrations  as  part  of  the  devolution \nprogram.  \n \n\n  NHA,  with  responsibility \n\n                                                 \n1  About 95% of all road freight transport is carried out by the private sector.  \n2  The  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA)  under  the  Ministry  of  Communications  is  responsible  for  the  national \n\nhighway network. \n\n3  40% good, 11% fair and 49% poor/very poor.  \n4  ADB. 2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loans  to  the \n\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the Road Development Sector Program  (program loan component). Manila. \n\n5  Most  of  these  issues  are  being  addressed  under  a  national  road  project,  which  is  being  prepared  by  the World \n\nBank. \n\n\f \n28\n\nAppendix 3 \n\n5. \nProject  Prioritization  and  Portfolio  Management.  In  the  past  NHA  suffered  from \npoorly justified investments, began too many new projects, and did not pay sufficient attention to \nnetwork conservation. The situation led to the deterioration of road conditions along some of the \nmore  heavily  trafficked  highway  sections,  caused  project  delays,  increased  project  costs,  and \nreduce  the  headroom  for  new  high-priority  initiatives  as  well  as  conservation  of  the  network. \nEncouraged  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  NHA  has  during  the  last  2  years  reprioritized  and \nreprogrammed  the  investment  program  with  more  attention  and  resources  for  conserving  the \nNH  network.  Thus,  the  federal  Government  and  NHA  have  initiated  a  multiyear  PRs35  billion \nNational Highway Improvement Program covering rehabilitation, resurfacing, and improvement \nof  some  2,700  km  of  the  NH  network,  based  on  a  condition  survey  and  a  network-level \nprioritization study. \n \n6. \nVehicle  Overloading.    Vehicle  overloading  is  a  major  impediment  to  sustainable \ndevelopment  of  the  road  sector  in  Pakistan,  particularly  on  the  NH  network.  Surveys  by  road \nagencies indicate that 88% of all trucks exceed the per-axle limit of 8 tons; 43% exceed the new \nproposed federal load limit of 12 tons per axle. Overloading causes roads to deteriorate rapidly, \nreducing  their  service  life  and  significantly  reducing  the  economic  benefits  that  should  have \nbeen  realized  during  the  designed  life  of  the  roads.6  Moreover,  the  high  recurrent  costs  of \nmaintenance  and  the  need  for  reconstruction  erode  the  limited  development  resources  of  the \ncountry.  As  a  result,  there  is  a  great  need  to  strengthen  enforcement  of  rules  against \noverloading vehicles and accelerate the ongoing nationwide axle load program pursued at the \nfederal level by the NHA. 7 \n \n7. \nRoad Maintenance . At NHA, it recognized increasingly that greater emphasis and more \nspending on road maintenance are necessary to preserve the national road infrastructure asset \nbase.  A  road  fund  was  established  in  2001  with  World  Bank  support.  NHA  has  increased  its \nspending  on  routine  and  periodic  road  maintenance;  spending  on  routine  maintenance \nincreased from PRs600 million in FY1997/98 to PRs800 in FY2002/03, but further increases are \nnecessary  to  reduce  the  backlog  of  maintenance.    The  increase  of  the  road  asset  base, \nhowever, indicates that NHA should spend at least about PRs3,000 billion to keep the network \nin its present condition. Maintenance is increasingly being contracted out to private civil works \ncontractors.  \n \nRoad Safety.  The fatality rate on Pakistan's road network remains among the highest in \n8. \nAsia.8  The  causes  are  high  speeds,  lack  of  road  safety  measures,  poor  discipline  and \nenforcement  of  rules,  and  poor  condition  of  vehicles.  Road  safety  audits  are  not  conducted \nroutinely  for  all  new  and  improved  roads.  The  road  safety  problem  is  exacerbated  by  lack  of \nawareness and poor knowledge of road safety matters among the general public and the road \nusers.  Efforts  and  coordination  at  the  national  and  province  levels  are  not  concerted,  and \nresponsibilities  and  accountability  among  the  institutions  and  provincial  departments  are \nunclear. Extensive efforts in education and training  of drivers, coupled with awareness building, \nare  required  to  address  the  high  fatality  rate.  The  Government  passed  the  National  Highway \nSafety  Ordinance  in  September  2000,  which  provided  the  legal  basis  for  establishing  the \nNational  Highway  and  Motorway  Police  (NHMP)  Force  under  the  federal  Ministry  of \n\n                                                 \n6  Calculations for local conditions show that a truck loaded at 12 tons per axle destroys roads five times as fast as a \n\n7  The nationwide axle-load program pursued by the NHA includes installing 30 weigh bridges at strategic locations \n\ntruck loaded at 8 tons per axle. \n\non the national highway network.  \n\n8  Pakistan  had  18.69  fatalities  per  10,000  vehicles  in  1992.  This  was  lower  than  those  for  India  (25.27)  and \nBangladesh  (85.58),  but  higher  than  those  for  Southeast  Asia  (5-15  fatalities  per  10,000  vehicles)  and  far  above \nthe  countries  with  the  lowest  number  of  fatalities,  such  as  the  United  Kingdom  (1.60)  and  Japan  (1.74).

NHA  is  pursuing  opportunities  for  private  sector \nparticupation  (PSP)  in  road  infrastructure  projects.  Projects  include  the  Lahore  and  Karachi \nbypass  projects,  which  are  being  prepared  on  build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis. The role of \nthe domestic private sector in road contracting and providing engineering services is fairly well \ndeveloped.  NHA  needs,  however,  to  step  up  its  efforts  to  increase  PSP.  NHA  is  currently \ndeveloping  Lakhpass  crossing  just  outside  Quetta  in  Balochistan  on  BOT  basis.  NHA  could \nincrease PSP manifold by introducing network management and performance-based contracts \nfor maintenance.   \n \nC. \n\nBalochistan Province  \n\n10. \nInstitutional  Capacity  and  Constraints. The Communication and Works Department \n(CWD) in Balochistan, which is responsible for roads and buildings, is structured and functions \nas  a  typical  public  works  department.  The  key  issue  at  CWD  is  inadequate  funding  for \nmaintenance  and  weak  institutional  capacity  in  planning  and  executing  maintenance.  Thus, \nthere is a great need to build institutional capacity for maintenance and revamp the road asset \nmanagement system. Although a road maintenance unit was established in 1999 with support of \nADB and the Nordic Development Fund, maintenance did not become fully institutionalized and \nintegrated  in  the  day-to-day  operations  at  CWD.  Another  important  but  more  difficult  issue  is \nrightsizing  of  staff.  This  needs  to  be  addressed  with  a  broader  institutional  and  organizational \nreview  of  CWD  and  a  move  toward  a  modern  road  management  agency.  Moreover,  as  a \nconsequence of the ongoing devolution program,9 which was formally initiated in August 2001, \nthe functions and allocation of responsibilities between CWD and the 26 district administrations \nneed to be reviewed.  \n \n11. \nRoad  Maintenance.  Since  1995,  spending  on  road  maintenance  in  Balochistan  has \nremained  largely  constant;  budget  allocations  for  road  maintenance10 increased by 4.9% from \nPRs92.3  million  in  FY1998  to  PRs97.8  million  in  FY2002,  while  the  allocations  for  road \ndevelopment (investments) under the annual development grant were around  PRs2.121 billion \nin FY2002 and PRs3.502 billion in FY2003. The recent expansion of the road network and the \nincrease  of  the  road  asset  base  indicate  that  further  increases  of  budget  allocations  for \nmaintenance  are  required  to  sustain  the  road  network.11  While  Balochistan  has  lower  road \ndensity  and  generally  poorer  access  than  other  provinces  in  Pakistan,  some  road  network \nexpansion is still required to connect districts and villages, and thus provide access for the poor \nrural  communities.  It  is  also  important  to  increase  maintenance  spending  and  improve \nmaintenance management and processes on existing roads.  \n \n12. \nRoad  Safety.  Improving  road  safety  is  also  an  important  issue  in  Balochistan.  The \nsituation  is  exacerbated  because  of  weak  institutional  capacity  at  CWD  and  the  narrow  roads \nand poor conditions. Under the Project, CWD will prepare an action plan to address road safety \nwith  preventive  and  corrective  measures  including  information  and  awareness  campaigns  and \neducation and adoption of road safety audits. \n \n13. \nPrivate Sector Participation.  The opportunities for PSP in road infrastructure projects \nare  smaller  in  Balochistan  than  elsewhere  in  Pakistan  due  to  remoteness  and  relatively  low \ntraffic  volumes.  The  role  of  the  domestic  private  sector  in  road  contracting  and  providing \n                                                 \n9  Under the devolution program, local governments at distric level have been created. \n10 Road  maintenance  spending  level  in  Balochistan:  FY1998/99? PRs77.3 million.  FY1999/2000? PRs47.5 million. \n\nFY2000/01? PRs77.4 million. FY2001/02? PRs 100.9 million.  \n\n11 Based on analysis by consultants supporting the road maintenance unit at Communication and Works Department. \n\n\f \n30\n\nAppendix 3 \n\nengineering services is, however, fairly well developed. Both NHA and BPG need, however, to \nstep up efforts to increase PSP in Balochistan. NHA is currently developing Lakhpass crossing \njust outside Quetta in Balochistan on BOT basis. CWD could increase PSP by contracting out \nmaintenance and gradually introducing network management and performance-based contracts \nfor maintenance.   \n \n\n\fAppendix 4      31\n\nEXTERNAL FINANCING FOR THE ROAD SECTOR\n\nProject\n\nFunding\nSource\n\nAmount\n($ million)\n\nYear\n\nFarm-to-Market Roads Project\nSecond Farm to Market Roads Project\nFlood Damage Restoration Project\nSukkur Bridge Project\nRural Access Roads Project\nRoad Sector Development Program\nPunjab Road Development Sector Project\n\nSubtotal\n\nLocomotive Manufacturing Factory\nRailway Transportation Reinforcement (II)\nIndus Highways - Phase I\nIndus Highways - Phase II\nTrack Circuit at 94 Mainline Station\nRural Roads Construction\nNew Locomotive Production  \nIndus Highways - Phase IIB\nDiesel Electric Locomotive Rehabilitation\nKohat Tunnel Construction (I)\nDiesel Locomotive Production II\nDiesel Electric Locomotive Rehabilitation\nSurvey Vessel Modernization\nKohat Tunnel Construction (II)\nSubtotal\n\nFirst Highway Project\nThird Highway Project\nFourth Highway Project\nTransport Sector Project\nKarachi Port Modernization\nTrade and Transport Facilitation\nSubtotal\n\nADB\nADB\nADB\nADB\nADB\nADB\nADB\n\nJBIC\nJBIC\nJBIC\nJBIC\nJBIC\nJBIC\nJBIC\nJBIC\nJBIC\nJBIC\nJBIC\nJBIC\nJBIC\nJBIC\n\nWB\nWB\nWB\nWB\nWB\nWB\n\n38.00\n113.00\n78.00\n45.00\n123.00\n200.00\n150.00\n747.00\n\n81.00\n123.00\n71.00\n173.00\n27.00\n95.00\n50.00\n152.00\n50.00\n45.00\n71.00\n56.00\n20.00\n34.00\n1,048.00\n\n17.00\n50.00\n152.00\n184.00\n91.40\n3.00\n497.40\n\n1986\n1990\n1993\n1994\n1996\n2001\n2002\n\n1984\n1985\n1989\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1993\n1993\n1993\n1994\n1996\n1996\n1996\n2001\n\n1964\n1980\n1987\n1991\n1992\n2001\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, JBIC = Japan Bank for International Cooperation, WB = World Bank.\nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\nTotal\n\n2,292.40\n\n\f3\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n5\n \n\ni\n\n \n\nMain Areas of \nReform \nInstitutional \nReform with New \nOrganization \nStructure  \n \n\nModern \nMaintenance \nPractices \n\nObjective \n\nTransform the \norganizational \nstructure of \nCommunication and \nWorks Department \n(CWD) so it becomes \nan effective and \nmodern road \nmanagement \norganization \n \n\nEnsure that CWD has \nsystems, procedures, \nand capacity to carry \nout effective and \nefficient road and \nbridge maintenance \nmanagement \n\nRoad User \nCharges \n\nEnsure that funding of \nmaintenance for long-\nterm preservation of \nthe provincial road \nnetwork is adequate \nand sustained \n\nPROVINCIAL POLICY MATRIX AND ACTION PLAN  \n \nKey Issues and Actions Taken  \n\nNext Step of Reform and Actions  \n\nThe organization of the CWD went \nthrough several changes recently. Initially, \nmany functions were transferred to the \ndistricts. This action did not prove \nsuccessful. A new organization structure \nwas approved on 4 March 2003, which \nbrought back some functions to the \nprovincial level. Rightsizing of staff is a \nkey issue in the move toward a modern \nroad management agency.   \n\nA road management unit (RMU) was \nestablished in 1998 with support of ADB \ntechnical assistance (TA) but it has since \nlapsed. The RMU needs to be empowered \nat CWD as the focal point for planning and \nmonitoring maintenance. CWD needs \ncapacity building, and training. \n \nMaintenance is at present rules -driven, \nlabor-based, and performed by force \naccount. Condition surveys are not \ninstitutionalized at CWD or the district \nlevel.  \n \nFunding for maintenance is currently \nprovided from the consolidated revenue \naccount. This system is working \nsatisfactorily. The main problem is the \nneed to pay staff formerly employed in \nmaintaining roads that have been \ntransferred to the National Highway \nAuthority (NHA). \n \n\nContinue steps to transform CWD so it becomes \na modern road management agency focusing on \nprovincial network modernization and \nconservation, with increased emphasis on \nmaintenance. Review the organizational setup \nand reorganize CWD along modern road \nmanagement principles by June 2005 and \napprove new setup end-2005. Delegate \nappropriate road management tasks, specifically \nmaintenance, to district administrations in support \nof devolution. Consider converting CWD into a \nseparate highway authority or corporation.  \n\nCWD, with the support of the consultants under \nthe provincial institutional development \ncomponent (PIDC), will develop road asset \nmanagement system (RAMS), new maintenance \nprocedures and manuals; and training staff in \nprocedures for developing, procuring, and \nsupervising contracts for routine and periodic \nmaintenance based on competitive tendering. \nThe new maintenance contracts will (i) include \nstandard or normal contracting out and network \nmanagement, and (ii) be performance-based.  \n\nCompliance \nMonitoring \nPrior to approval of \nthe new institutional \nsetup and \norganizational \nstructure and \nstaffing plan, CWD \nwill submit the \nproposal and the \nimplementation plan \nto the Asian \nDeveloment Bank \n(ADB) for \ncomments.   \nConsultant\u2019s report \nCWD will submit the \nimplementation plan \nwith brief \ndescription of the \nnew system and \nprocedures.  \n\nCWD will, with support of consultants under the \nPIDC, analyze maintenance funding \nrequirements and available options for secured \nand sustained funding for road asset \npreservation, specifically (i) a new road user \ncharge to recover costs for maintenance, and (ii) \nthe use of tolls on routes used by heavy through \ntraffic. The preferred schemes for (i) road user \ncharges, (ii) toll collection, and (iii) maintenance \nfunding mechanism will be implemented from \n2005 following consultations with ADB. . \n\nConsultant\u2019s report \nCWD will submit the \nnew proposal and \nimplementation plan \nto ADB for \ncomments. \n\n\f \n\nMain Areas of \nReform \nAxle Load \nControl \n\nRoad Safety \n\nObjective \n\nKey Issues and Actions Taken  \n\nNext Step of Reform and Actions  \n\nReduce overloading \nof vehicles, especially \ntrucks to prevent early \ndeterioration of the \nprovincial road \nnetwork  \n\nOverloading of trucks is a major and \ncommon problem in Pakistan. NHA is \nimplementing a program for axle-load \ncontrol for the national highway network. \nOnly two have been built in Balochistan. \nBalochistan provincial government (BPG) \nis monitoring the effectiveness of these \nstations. \n\nAs part of the Project, weigh stations will be \ninstalled for selective provincial highways at \nstrategic locations. Capacity and enforcement of \nrules will be strengthened through training of \nCWD and other staff, including the provincial \npolice. Awareness campaigns will be carried out \nby CWD. CWD will prepare an action plan for \nimproved enforcement of regulations, which will \nalso link with the devolution and police reforms \nsupported under ADB assistance.  \n\nImprove road safety \nand reduce the total \nnumber of road \naccidents in the \nprovince of \nBalochistan \n\nThere is lack of coordination and capacity \nin BGP? specifically at CWD, education \nand health departments, and the police \nforce? for preventive and corrective road \nsafety measures including information \ncampaigns, training, and education. No \naccident reporting centers have been \nestablished in Balochistan. \n\nThe objective is to develop, prepare, and \nimplement a road safety action plan in \nBalochistan, comprising, inter alia, awareness \ncampaigns, strengthening of education in \nschools, drivers\u2019 training, and enforcement of \ntraffic rules. The PIDC will support the \ncommittee's work and CWD will, by 2006, \ninstitutionalize road safety audits for all road \nprojects.  \n\nCompliance \nMonitoring \nCWD will submit an \naction plan for \nimproved \nenforcement of \nregulations. \nProject progress \nreports  \nPhysical inspection \nof installed weigh \nstations  \n\n \n\nRoad safety action \nplans will be \nsubmitted to ADB \nfor comments by \nend-2005. \nStatus reports on \naction taken to \nimprove \nenforcement of road \nsafety and traffic \nregulations will be \nmade. \n \nProject progress \nreporting \nProject review \nmissions  \n\nCWD lacks capacity and experienced staff \nfor environmental and social assessment. \nThere is a great need to strengthen \nmonitoring of civil works contracts \ncompliance with labor laws, specifically \ngender inequality and child labor. \nThe opportunities for PSP in road \ninfrastructure projects have been smaller \nin Balochistan than elsewhere in Pakistan \ndue to the remoteness and relatively low \ntraffic volumes. Use of contractors for \nmaintenance is relatively undeveloped in \nBalochistan. \nA few road user associations are \nestablished in Pakistan and involved in \nvarious areas, such as education and \nroad safety awareness campaigns. \n\nCWD will be strengthened through capacity \nbuilding and training of more staff, to be able to \ncarry out environment and social assessments of \nroad projects. Capacity building will be provided \nunder the PIDC.  \n\nCWD will increase contracting out of \nmaintenance so that 10% of routine and periodic \nmaintenance will be undertaken by the private \nsector in 2005, 20% in 2006, and 40% in 2007.  \n\nYearly status report \nwith completed \nactions will be \nsubmitted to ADB.  \n\nBPG and CWD will encourage the establishment \nof road user associations and similar \norganizations for broader participation and more \ninvolvement by the public and road users in road \noperations and development in Balochistan.    \n\nProject progress \nreporting  \n\nCapacity \nBuilding for \nEnvironment and \nSocial \nAssessment  \n\nStrengthen CWD\u2019s \ninstitutional capacity \nfor environment and \nsocial assessment of \nroad projects  \n\nIncrease private \nsector participation, \nwherever feasible, in \nCWD\u2019s road \nmaintenance \noperations and road \nrehabilitation program  \nIncrease involvement \nand participation of \nthe public and road \nusers in road \noperations and \ndevelopment \n\nPrivate Sector \nInvolvement \n\nRoad User \nAssociations \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n5\n\ni\n\n \n\n3\n3\n\n \n\n \n\n\fPolicy Theme \n\nObjective \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTransport \nPolicy \n \n \n\nRoad  Sector \nResource \nManagement \n\nRoad Asset \nPreservation \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nEstablish a transport system  that \nprovides efficient, safe, reliable, \nequitable, and environmental-\nfriendly access and mobility for \npeople and goods. \nInvest primarily in roads that are \neconomically viable and for \nwhich stable and secure \nresources for preservation of \nassets are available  \n\nImprove road maintenance and \nincrease allocations for road \nmaintenance  \n\nImplement a road asset \nmanagement system (RAMS) to \nensure that NHA effectively carry \nout asset management and \npreservation.

The plan \nfocuses on ongoing priority projects, \nappropriately balancing network \nexpansion and conservation.  \nNHA has increased road \nmaintenance allocation to PRs2.5 \nbillion in FY2001/02 and further to \nPRs3.4 billion in FY2002/03.    \nRAMS is used as the basis for \nallocating maintenance \nexpenditures. The Road Asset \nManagement Directorate (RAMD) at \nNHA is fully functioning, with core \nstaff (11 officers and 20 staff) \nposted at RAMD.  \nThe Government has prepared and \napproved legislation. NHA has \ninitiated actions to enforce \nlegislation through awareness \nprograms and measurement of \nvehicle load levels. Thirty high-\nspeed weigh stations are \noperational, delayed but underway.  \n(MOCR) has extended the \njurisdiction of the National Highway \nand Motorway Police (NHMP) for \nenforcing road safety and axle load \ncontrol to the national highways, \nstarting with 320 km of N5. A \nfine collection system has been set \nup and is operational at weigh \nstations for five national highways.  \nEnforcement procedures and \ninstitutional framework have been \nestablished including schedule of \n\n\fPolicy Theme \n\nObjective \n\n \nKey Issues and Actions Taken \n(under Loan 1891-PAK) \n\n \nNext Step of Reform and Actions  \n\nStatus and Compliance \nMonitoring \n\nImprovement \nof Institutional \nEfficiency  \n \n\nOperate road agencies on the \nprinciples of economy and \nefficiency in operations \u2014move \nto a commercial road agency, \ni.e., operating on a fee-for-\nservice basis  \n\nInstitutional evaluation exercise will be \ncontinued to create balance between the \nfunctions and staffing needs and achieve \nmaximum efficiency.

The  criteria  for  selection  and  the \napproval process are outlined in this appendix. \n \nA. \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria \n\n2. \n\nSubprojects must meet the following criteria. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nProvincial  road  master  plan.  The  subproject  will  be  part  of  the  provincial \nroad master plan. \nPoverty  targeting.  The  subproject  will  have  been  prioritized  based  on  the \ndistrict  development  ranking  used  by  the  Government  for  determining \nallocation of its development expenditures.  \nTechnical  feasibility.  The  subproject  will  be  technically  feasible  and  a \ndetailed report prepared. \nEconomic feasibility. Economic analysis of the subproject will be prepared in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects  and \nthe estimated economic internal rate of return will be at least 12%. \nSocial assessment and analysis. The subproject will be socially sound, will \nminimize the need for land acquisition, and will include measures to mitigate \nany  social  impacts.  An  initial  social  assessment  (ISA)  for  the  subproject  will \nhave been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s relevant guidelines.  \nResettlement.  The  proposed  subproject  road  will  not  entail  any  involuntary \nresettlement or land acquisition. Impact on any affected persons through land \nacquisition or description of livelihood will be minimal. If a subproject involves \nland  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement,  a  full  resettlement  plan  (if  the \nnumber of affected persons is 200 or more) or a short one (if fewer than 200 \npersons  are  affected)  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  have  been  prepared  in \naccordance with the resettlement framework agreed upon by the Government \nInvoluntary \nand  ADB  and \nResettlement. \nIndigenous people.  If  any  indigenous  people,  such  as  tribes  or  settlers,  as \nper ADB\u2019s definition, are likely to be affected significantly by a subproject, an \nindigenous people\u2019s plan should be prepared in accordance with ADB's Policy \non Indigenous People. \n\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \n\n(viii)  Environmental  considerations.  Each  proposed  subproject  road  will  have \nbeen screened for environmental impacts in compliance with the requirements \nof  the  Government  and  the  ADB,1  and  should  not  cause  any  major  adverse \nimpact  on  the  environment.  ADB  will  have  received  and  reviewed  the  initial \nenvironmental  examination,  if  any,  prepared  for  the  proposed  road.  All \nnecessary  approvals  and  clearances  will  have  been  obtained  for  the \nsubproject from the federal and provincial governments and related agencies. \nCounterpart funding.  BPG  will  ensure  that  sufficient  counterpart  funding  is \nallocated  to  implement  the  subproject  on  time  and  efficiently  in  accordance \nwith the overall implementation schedule. \nGovernment  approvals.  All  necessary  BPG  approvals  will  have  been \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines of the Asian Development Bank . Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n40\n\nAppendix 10 \n\n(xi) \n\nobtained for each subproject.  \nDistrict commitment.  As appropriate, BPG will have confirmed, in a manner \nacceptable to ADB, its commitment of the districts to the proposed subproject \nroad,  including  but  not  limited  to  the  provision  of  budgetary  allocations  for \nrehabilitation and operation and maintenance for the subproject road.  \n\n \nB. \n\nApproval Process for Subprojects  \n\n3. \nAll  subprojects  will  be  required  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  guidelines  and \nsatisfy  ADB\u2019s  procedures  for  subproject  preparation  with  respect  to  technical,  operational, \neconomic, social, indigenous people, resettlement and other requirements. BPG will ensure \nthat sufficient counterpart funding will be  available. The six core subproject provincial roads \nfor  which  the  aforementioned  requirements  were  applied  during  project  preparation  were \nfound  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  socially  responsible  and  environmentally \nsound.  For  additional  subprojects,  the  requirements  will  be  applied  during  project \nimplementation. \n \n4. \n  During  the  early  stages  of  implementation,  the  project  management  unit  (PMU) \nthrough  the  Project  Engineering  Cell  an  with  the  assistance  of  the  institutional  and \nmanagement  consultants,  will  prepare  a  consolidated  report  for  one  or  more  subprojects \ncovering all the stipulated ADB requirements. The report will be sent to ADB for review and \napproval.  With  ADB\u2019s  approval,  PMU  will  proceed  with  further  subproject  preparation, \nprocurement, and subproject implementation.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n \n \n\n

relatively poor province and economic growth is constrained by a road \n1. \nnetwork  suffering  from  lack  of  development  and  maintenance.  It  is  the  largest  of  Pakistan\u2019s \nprovinces,  but  it  has  isolated  settlements  and  is  generally  detached  from  the  country\u2019s \nmainstream  political  and  economic  activities.  The  Project  has  been  designed  to  support \nsustainable  pro-poor  growth,  reduce  poverty,  promote  subregional  cooperation,  and  be \nenvironmentally  and  socially  responsible.  The  Project  is  expected  to  contribute  significantly  to \npoverty  reduction  in  the  medium  term  by  increasing  literacy  level,  reducing  transport  costs, \nreducing  intradistrict  travel  times,  increasing  access  to  social  services,  and  reducing  the \nvulnerability of the population, particularly of women. According to surveys conducted as part of \nproject  preparation,  people  along  the  roads  expect  the  roads  to  generate  employment \nopportunities  for  them  and  increase  their  access  to  social  services  like  health  and  education. \nSimilarly poor people would be able to reach police stations and banks more easily. The Project \nwill help people transport their goods to market, reduce transport costs, increase food security, \nand increase mobility of the population.  \n \nExperience elsewhere has shown that the potential benefits to the poor are likely to be \n2. \nachieved  quickly.  The  effects  are  more  likely  to  be  sustained  if  the  infrastructure  project  is \naugmented  with  specific  support  and  assistance  targeted  at  the  poor,  such  as  direct \ninvolvement in road construction and construction of ancillary facilities (footpaths, drainage), or \nindirect  involvement  through  activities  that  enable  the  community  to  capitalize  on  the  new \nopportunities.  The  latter  might  include  drilling  wells  to  enable  cash  crops  to  be  planted  or \nproviding transport to increase access to health and education. In both cases the emphasis is \non providing training and skills to help the poor help themselves. \n \nB. \n\nObjectives \n\n3. \nThe technical assistance (TA) will (i) develop and implement community initiatives that \nleverage  off  the  Project  in  a  manner  that  increases  its  positive  impact  on  the  poor,  and  in \nparticular,  on  women;  (ii)  support  intitiatives  aimed  at  promoting  greater  awareness  of  social, \nhealth  and  safety  issues  that  may  emerge  from  the  Project;  and  (iii)  establish  a  scheme  to \nmeasure and monitor the poverty impact of roads. \n \nC. \n\nMajor Activities and Tasks  \n\nThe TA involves three major activities, which may overlap and complement each other. \n\n4. \n \n5. \nCommunity Infrastructure and Empowerment Fund. Grants of up to the equivalent of \n$25,000 each in support of poverty alleviation in road-side communities along roads supported \nunder BRDSP will be made on a competitive basis to selected non-governmental organizations \nand other community groups approved by ADB.  \n \n6. \nSocial Protection and Education Fund.   Grants up to the equivalent of $10,000 each \nin  support  of  programs  aimed  at  raising  community  awareness  of  social,  health  and  safety \nissues such as prevention of HIV/AIDS, trafficking of women and children, and vehicular traffic \naccident  will  be  made  on  a  competitive  basis  to  selected  non-governmental  organization  and \nother community groups approved by ADB. \n \n7. \n\nMonitoring and Measuring Social and Poverty Impacts.  \n(i) \n\nIdentify  indicators  for  measuring  the  social  impact  of  the  project  roads  and \nassociated programs.  \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nUndertake a benchmark study to determine the current values of the measures, \nidentify  the  current  use  of  the  road,  and  describe  the  socioeconomic  profile  of \nusers and nonusers.  \nTraining  the  Project  management  unit/Project  Engineering  Cell  in  the  CWD  to \nidentify  and  monitor  social  impacts,  and  establish  an  ongoing  monitoring \nprogram.  \nPrepare  a  baseline  report,  a  project  completion  report,  and  a  review  report  2 \nyears after physical project completion.  \nCarry out a socioeconomic and poverty impact study on past road projects. \n\n8. \nCost and Financing. The TA will be financed from the Special Funds resources of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). The total cost is estimated at $1.25 million comprising $0.22 \nmillion in foreign exchange and $1.03 million in local currency. The TA loan of $1.0 million will \nfinance  the  total  foreign  cost  and  $0.78  million  of  the  local  cost.  The  Balochistan  provincial \ngovernment (BPG) will finance the remainder of the local costs. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n9. \nExecuting  and  Implementing  Agencies.  CWD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The \nestablished project management unit (PMU) at CWD will be the Implementing Agency, headed \nby the project director. Nongovenment organizations (NGOs) will be appointed to undertake the \nTA loan activities. The TA is planned to  begin by January 2004 and will be implemented over \nsix years. \n \n10. \nCWD will in consultation with ADB, establish a Community Support Project Committee \n(the  Committee)  consisting  of  no  less  than  seven  members.  At  least  four  members  of  the \nCommittee  shall  be  drawn  from  non-governmental  organizations,  academia  or  the  media.  At \nleast  three  members  of  the  Committee  shall  be  women.  This  committee  will  be  entrusted  to \ndevelop  and  approve  detailed  criteria  and  procedures  for  solicitation  and  selection  of \napplications  for  grant  awards  under  the  (i)  Community  Infrastructure  and  Empowerment  Fund \nand  (ii)  Social  Protection  and  Education  Fund.  In  setting  criteria  for  grant  selection,  the \nCommittee  shall  give  utmost  importance  to  enhancing  livelihood  opportunities  of  the  poor, \nparticularly women, and in addressing other basic needs concerns such as clean water supply \nand nutrition. \n \n11. \nProcurement of Goods and Services.  The PMU will initiate the hiring of consultants. \nEach consultant or consulting team will prepare an inception report for its subcomponent within \n2  weeks  of  the  start  of  services,  providing  a  time-bound  work  program  and  a  schedule  of \nprogress  reports.  For  each  subcomponent,  a  draft  final  report  will  be  submitted  and  a  final \nreport finalized after comments of the Government and ADB have been incorporated. \n \nTraining, Workshops, and Seminars.  Community  participation  is  the  essence  of  the \n12. \nTA.  Workshops  will  be  held  on  each  road  to  introduce  the  Project  and  to  provide  a  means  of \ncommunicating  concepts  and  reporting  progress.  The  TA  will  train  CWD  and  the  community \ngroups to ensure effective transfer of knowledge. \n \n13. \nAccounts and Audits.  CWD  will  establish  separate  project  accounts  for  expenditures \nunder  the  TA  loan,  with  separate recording of transactions.  CWD  will  appoint  an  independent \nauditor  acceptable  to  ADB  to  routinely  monitor  and  annually  evaluate  and  document  the \nexecution of community initiatives supported under the Project. Such auditors will be replaced \nevery two years. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n45\n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANT FOR  \n \nCROSS-BORDER DEVELOPMENT  \n\n1. \nThe  Technical  Assistance  (TA)  will  develop  a  concept,  prepare  a  plan,  and  complete  a \npackage, including outline design and specifications, for a pilot cross-border facility to be established \nand operated at the Chamman border point. The pilot cross-border facility will take cognizance of the \nenvironment and opportunities for coordinated operation of immigration, customs, vehicle inspections, \nand  health  and  other  phytosanitary  inspections.  The  facility  must  be  administratively  least \ncumbersome,  client-friendly,  and  transparent  in  all  processes  while  fully  complying  with  applicable \ngovernment policies, regulations, and interests.  \n \nB. \n\nScope and Outline Terms of Reference  \n\nThe TA will entail the following major tasks. \n\n2. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nBriefly  review  all  significant  recent  (last  5  years)  assessments  of  trade  facilitation \narrangements (including port clearance and storage fees and other levies) at ports and \nborder  crossings  conducted  by  the  Government  of  Pakistan  or  internal  or  external \nagencies, ascertain the validity of such assessments, and analyze why any proposals, \nif any, have not been implemented. \nReview  the  major  legal,  financial,  and  administrative  issues  affecting  cross-border \ntransit and trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and identify any major gaps and \nrequired  changes  in  the  1965  Transit  Agreement  to  develop  a  comprehensive  transit \nagreement  that  considers  the  interests  and  concerns  of  both  governments  and  the \ncompetitive situation.   \nIdentify,  review  and  assess  the  key  issues  on  transit  of  goods  and  vehicles  carrying \nsuch  goods.

The  economic  analysis  examined  the \nexpected  contribution  of  the  Project  to  the  province  of  Balochistan.  The  two  national  highway  sections \nand the six core roads1 were subjected to detailed economic evaluation. Noncore roads will be subjected \nto  a  similar  analysis  for  their  inclusion  in  later  stages  of  the  Project.  The  Highway  Development  and \nManagement  Model  of  the  World  Bank  (HDM-4)  was  used  to  analyze  for  direct  savings  in transport \ncosts. Value added from ensuring new industries, employment, and sub-regional transport due to better \ntransport links are not quantified. The main assumptions about maintenance and improvement strategies  \nwith and without the Project are discussed in paras. 2-4. \n \nFor  the  already  paved  national  highways, the  without  project  case  is  the  situation  where  the \n2. \nquality  of  service  provided  by  the  existing  roads  is  maintained  at  a  reasonable  level.  The  international \nroughness index (IRI) is allowed to deteriorate only until level IRI 10.  At that point, periodic maintenance \nworks  are  carried  out  to  improve  the  condition  to  IRI  6.  Routine  maintenance  activities  that  were \nconsidered  use  prevailing  standards  of  the  National  Highway  Authority:  nominal  patching  of  potholes, \ncrack sealing by bituminous seal coat, grass cutting, grading of shoulders as well as cleaning of culverts \nand ditches, and refurbishing of sign posts. The maintenance strategy is assumed to remain constant for \nthe 20-year evaluation period.  \n \n3. \nFor  provincial  highways,  the  without  project  case  is  the  situation  where  the  quality  of service \nprovided by the existing roads is maintained at  a reasonable level. IRI is allowed to deteriorate only until \nlevel IRI 10. At that point, periodic maintenance works are carried out to improve the condition to IRI 6. \nRoutine maintenance activities and the overall maintenance strategy will be the same as in  para. 2. For \nexisting  gravel/earth  tracks,  the  roughness  level  of  which  is  beyond  measurement,  only  routine \nmaintenance  is  provided.  In  recognition  of  the  prevailing  maintenance  standards  of  Balochistan's \nCommunication and Works Department, roughness levels are allowed to deteriorate up to the maximum \nvalue provided by HDM for such roads.  \n \n4. \nFor  the  with  project  case,  the  two  surface  treatments  were  asphalt  concrete  (AC)  and  triple \nsurface treatment (TST). Periodic maintenance based on road condition in terms of roughness level was \nassumed.  Initial  treatment  will  give  IRI  levels  of  2.5  with  AC  and  4  with  TST.  For  AC  roads  the \nmaintenance  strategy  assumes  that  whenever  IRI  exceeds  6,  an  overlay  of    50  millimeters  (mm)  for \nNational highways or 25 mm for Provincial roads will be added with AC to lower IRI back to 2.5. For TST \nroads, the maintenance strategy assumes that whenever IRI exceeds 8, a 25  mm overlay will be added \nwith  TST  to  lower  IRI  back  to  4.  It  is  assumed  that,  after  improvement,  routine  maintenance  will  be \ncarried  out:  complete  patching  of  potholes,  regular  ditch  cleaning,  refurbishing  any  safety  measures \ndisturbed, and grading of shoulders at regular intervals, especially after the monsoon. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nRoad Condition. The condition of existing paved roads was investigated by topographic survey, \npavement survey, roughness survey, and pit investigations. The  results are summarized in Table A15.1.  \nThe of unpaved roads were visually inspected by the expert engineering staff. \n\nRoad Condition and Traffic \n\n                                                 \n1  The  core  roads  were  selected  from  a  prescreened  list  of  roads  meeting  the  12%  minimum  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n\n(EIRR) criterion of the Asian Development Bank. \n\n\f50 \n \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A15.1:  Road Condition Data \n\nRoad Section \n\n \n\nNational Highways \nQuetta \u2013 Kalat \nQuetta - Chamman \nProvincial Highway \n Sanjavi \u2013 Duki  \nRural Access Road \n Dera Allah Yar to Hairdin \nSource: .Consultants survey. \n\nRoughness Index (m/km) \n\n \n\n \n\n8.44 \n8.42 \n\n 11.47 \n \n  9.17 \n\n \n \n6. \nTraffic  Volume .

Improvement costs  were  established for each \nroad separately on the basis of estimated quantities of work using the recently completed Rural Access \nRoad  Project  in  Balochistan.    For  national  highways,  old  cost  estimates  of  similar  constructions  were \nupdated using current national highway rates.

It was assumed that the project duration was 2 years and/or 1 year for small roads, with 50% of \nthe works to be carried out in year 1 and 50% in year 2 or 100% of the works completed in 1 year.  \n \nD. \n \n12. \nThe  main  quantifiable  benefits  of  the  investment  are  (i)  the  savings  in  Vehicle  Operating  Costs \n(VOCs) for existing traffic; and (ii) VOC savings to diverted traffic where applicable. A minor component \nwill be savings in periodic maintenance cost to be incurred by the Government. The savings in VOC are \ndue  to  better  road  surface  conditions.  As  access  to  markets,  which  reflects  agricultural  benefits, \nimproves, more economic activities are expected to  result in generated traffic. However generated traffic \nof goods  was  ignored  considering  the  water  constraint on agricultural production, except for  the  Zhob \nKhajuri road, where current traffic is negligible and traffic levels have been predicted from adjacent land \nuse  data  and  land  use  patterns.  The  benefits  to  generated  traffic  are  assumed  to  be  half  the  rate for \nnormal traffic.2 The value of time used was 80% of the average wage for work journeys and 20% of the \naverage wage for nonwork journeys.  \n \nE. \n\nResults of Economic Evaluation and Sensitivity Analysis \n\nEconomic  Evaluation.  Two  improvement  strategies,  surface  dressing  with  TST  and  AC  was \n13. \nevaluated.  For  national  highways,  both  AC  and  TST  produced acceptable  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturns (EIRRs) and can stand the worse case as in the sensitivity analysis. For the  provincial highways \nand  rural  roads,  both  AC  and  TST  proved  economically  acceptable  except  for  the  Khurkhera\u2013Kanraj \nsection that will only meet 12%  criterion  only  by using TST. Based on the  preceding  analysis,  AC  and \nTST can be considered for national highways and core rural access and provincial roads, and TST is the \npreferred treatment for Khurkhera - Kanraj . \n \nSensitivity Analysis. Sensitivity analysis with TST was tested. Assumptions that would affect the \n14. \noutcome  are  listed  in  Table  A15.7 and  Table  A15.8  along  with  a  likely  range  of  values.  The analysis \nshows that all proposed roads tested still meet the 12% target with changes in the key assumptions over \na significant range. Table A1 5.9 showed that the results are most sensitive to the assumed  VOCs and \ncapital costs. Respectively, a 20% reduction in VOC or an increase in capital costs of 17% is required for \nsome of the core roads to be  nonviable. While events of this magnitude are possible, the majority of the \ncore  roads  require  much  larger  changes,  so  the  likelihood  that  the  Project  as  a  whole  will  prove \nnonviable is small. An extension in construction time by 1 year (delaying some costs and all the benefits) \nis equivalent to a 5% reduction in cost and a 12% reduction in benefits. \n \n\nRoad Section \n\nTable A15.7: Summary of EIRRs with Sensitivity Analysis for National Highways \n \n20% \nReduction \nin VOC  \n\nStrategy II \n(TST) \n\nStrategy I \n(AC) \n\n \n\n50% \nReduction \nin Value of \nTime \n \n38.8 \n32.6 \n\n20% \nIncrease \nin Capital \nCost \n \n35.3 \n29.4 \n\nReduction \nin Growth \nfrom 5%  to \n3% \n \n30.9 \n37.8 \n\nExtension of \nConstruction \nTime by 1 \nYear \n \n36.0 \n28.4 \n\nNational Highways   \nQuetta \u2013 Kalat  \nQuetta \u2013 Chamman  \nSource:  Consultants ' report. \nAC = asphalt concrete, TST = triple surface treatment, VOC = vehicle operation cost \n\n \n34.3 \n28.5 \n\n46.5 \n\n40.6 \n\n40.4 \n\n33.7 \n\n  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2   This is the \u201crule of a half\u201d normally used for estimating benefits to generated traffic. \n\n\fAppendix 15  53 \n\n \nTable A15.8: Summary of EIRRs with Sensitivity Analysis for Rural and Provincial Roads \n(%) \n\n \nRoad Section \n\n \n\nProvincial Highways   \nZhob\u2013Khajuri   \nNag\u2013Panjgur  \nKach\u2013Harnai  \nRural Access Roads \nGulistan\u2013Kandel \n\nStrategy I \n(TST) \n \n\nStrategy II \n (AC) \n\n20 % \nReduction \nin VOC  \n\n \n17.5 \n28.6 \n21.7 \n \n48.9 \n27.3 \n14.8 \n\n \n13.8 \n23.9 \n17.7 \n \n41.5 \n23.6 \n11.4 \n\n \n14.0 \n25.3 \n17.7 \n \n40.8 \n24.8 \n13.0 \n\n50 % \nReduction \nin Value of \nTime \n \n16.2 \n27.4 \n21.4 \n \n45.0 \n26.3 \n14.3 \n\n20% \nIncrease in \ncapital \nCost \n \n14.7 \n24.4 \n18.4 \n \n41.3 \n24.3 \n11.7 \n\nReduction \nin Growth \nfrom 5%  to \n3% \n \n16.8 \n26.6 \n18.7 \n \n46.6 \n25.3 \n13.5 \n\nExtension of \nConstruction \nTime by 1 \nYear \n \n14.6 \n24.1 \n19.1 \n \n34.1 \n23.8 \n11.4 \n\nDera\u2013Hairdin \nKhurkhera\u2013Kanraj  \nSource:  Consultants' report. \nAC = asphalt concrete, TST = triple surface treatment, VOC = vehicle operation cost. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A15.9: Switching Values (TST) \n \n\n20% Decrease \nin VOC \n\n50% decrease \nin Value of \nTime \n\nGrowth \nReduced from \n5%  to 3% \n \n\n20% Capital \nCost Increase \n\nSV \n% \n \n127 \n112 \n \n23 \n54 \n78 \n\nRoad Section \n\nNPV \n\nNPV \n\n \n\n \n2,189 \n2,213 \n \n27 \n191 \n434 \n\n \n2,485 \n2,585 \n \n135 \n260 \n571 \n\nNational Highways   \nQuetta \u2013 Kalat \nQuetta \u2013 Chamman  \nProvincial Roads \nZhob\u2013Khajuri  \nNag\u2013Panjgur  \nKach\u2013Harnai  \nRural Access Roads  \n177 \n74 \nGulistan\u2013Kandel \n348 \n207 \nDera \u2013 Hairdin \nKhurkhera\u2013Kanraj  \n610 \n7 \nSV Switching value\u2013 factor that will reduce the EIRR to 12%. \nSource:  Consultants ' report. \nNPV = net percent value, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \n\n81 \n230 \n18 \n\n119 \n109 \n30 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSV \n% \n \n194 \n221 \n \n595 \n474 \n302 \n\n \nF. \n\nDistribution Analysis \n\nNPV \n \n \n2,369 \n2,402 \n \n156 \n204 \n480 \n\n82 \n212 \n9 \n\nSV \n% \n \n453 \n367 \n \n178 \n123 \n226 \n\n570 \n245 \n68 \n\nNPV \n \n \n2,262 \n2,300 \n \n63 \n164 \n462 \n\n75 \n198 \n(3) \n\nSV \n% \n \n154 \n136 \n \n29 \n44 \n96 \n\n126 \n92 \n17 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n15. \nDistribution  analysis  distributed  all  economic  net  benefits  among  the  following  categories  of \nstakeholders:  (i)  local  passengers,  (ii)  through  travelers,  (iii)  freight  users,  (iv)  vehicle  owners,  (v) \nunskilled labor, and (vi) Government/economy. In the case of Pakistan, both the passenger and freight \ntransport markets are highly competitive.  The proportion of the road user benefits that will be passed on \nto users  was  estimated to range from 70%  for  rural  access roads to 90% for  national  highways.  The \nmajority of the vehicles are privately owned. For the Project\u2019s capital expenditure and maintenance cost \non local labor, SWRF of 0.7 was assumed.   \n \n16. \nrural access roads.3   \n\nThe summarized results of the distribution analysis are for national and provincial highways, and \n\n                                                 \n3  The  benefits  do  not  include  any  estimate  of  the  likely  benefits  of  through  traffic  between  Afghanistan  and  CAR  and  the \n\nPakistan ports. \n\n\f54 \n \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nG. \n\nPoverty Impact \n\nFor  the  poverty  impact  analysis,  assumptions  were made  for each road  about the proportion of \n17. \nthe poor in  each  stakeholder  group.  The  incidence  of  poverty  is  very  high  in  this  region  of  Pakistan. \nBased  on  origin-destination surveys undertaken at  14  locations across Balochistan? where responses \nwere  correlated  with  income  data  obtained  from  the  social  survey? the  distribution of  the  poor  was \ndeveloped for each road.  The  social  survey  revealed  a  high  incidence  of  vehicle  ownership  amongst \npeople below the poverty level.4 Overall 20% of vehicle owners using the road were assumed to be poor \n(mostly  motorcycle  owners);  100%  of  unskilled  workers  were  assumed  to  be  poor,  whereas  skilled \nworkers  were  assumed  to  be  non-poor.  Overall, the  poverty  impact  ratio  (PIR)  is  0.46,  higher  than  the \n12.2% of the poor\u2019s share of national income or the head count poverty ratio of about 35% in the country. \nThe  value  of  the  PIR  is  relatively  insensitive  to  changes  in  the  total  benefits  or  costs.5  The  PIR  is \nsensitive to the assumptions on the distribution of the poor among  users. However, a 50% reduction in \nthe proportion of the poor among local passengers would be needed to bring the ratio below 35%. \n \n18. \n\nThe overall result of distribution analysis is presented in TableA15.10 \n\n \n        Table A15.10:Distribution of Benefits Analysis and Poverty Impact Ratio \n\n \n\nItem \n\n \n  \n\n \n\nInflows \n\nOutflows \n \n\n  Road User \nBenefits  \n\nInitial Capital \nInvestment \n  Operation & \nMaintenance \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nNet \nBenefits  \n\n \nPoverty Impact Ratio \n  Gains and \nLosses  \n  Proportion of \nthe Poor (%) \n  Net Benefits \nfor the Poor \n\n20,419 \n\n0 \n\n20,419 \n\n7,114 \n\n2,337 \n\n0 \n\nNET BENEFITS \n\n \n  National Government \nFinancial \n  Economic \nPV PRs \n(m) \n\nPV PRs \n(m) \n\n \n \nDifference  \n\nDISTRIBUTION OF NET BENEFITS \n \nRoad Users \n \nLabor \n\nFreight  \nUsers \n\nVehicle  \nowners \n\nThrough  \nTraffic  \n\n \nGGovernment/\nEEconomy \n\nLocal  \nPassenger\ns \n\n \n7,571 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n-6,628 \n\n \n-7,798 \n\n \n1,160 \n\n-326 \n\n-390 \n\n64 \n\n \n0 \n\n0 \n\n \n13,465 \n\n \n-8,188 \n\n \n21,653 \n\n \n7,571 \n\n \nTotal \n \n\n13,465 \n\n7,571 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n3,299 \n\n \n0 \n\n0 \n\n \n3,299 \n\n \n \n3,299 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n0 \n\n0 \n\n \n7,114 \n\n \n \n7,114 \n\n \n0 \n\n0 \n\n \n2,337 \n\n \n \n2,337 \n\n \n175 \n\n35 \n\n \n210 \n\n \n \n194 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n97 \n\n \n994 \n\n29 \n\n \n1,120 \n\n \n \n-7,068 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n40% \n\n28% \n\n35% \n\n20% \n\n100% \n\n12% \n\n6,241 \n\n3,028 \n\n924 \n\n2,450 \n\n467 \n\n194 \n\n-862 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n  Poverty Impact Ratio \n \n\n \n0.46 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nNote: The net loss to Government/Economy (-7068) is calculated as \u20138188+1120. \nPRs = Pakistan rupees, PV = present value,  \nSource:  Consultants' report. \n\n                                                 \n4  This is believed to be due to the presence of smuggled or contraband goods, in which case, the actual use of vehicles is likely \n\nto be low. \n\n5   Except in the case of the Khajuri-Kanraj where the net benefit is small. \n\n\fAppendix 16 \n\n55\n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nSector Identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Partnership Agreement? Yes \n\nSector Identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Analysis? Yes \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan.  Poverty in Pakistan \nhas historically been higher in rural than in urban areas. Poverty rose more sharply in the rural \nareas  in  the  1990s,  and  in  FY1999  the  incidence  of  rural  poverty  (36.3%)  was  significantly \nhigher than that of urban poverty (22.6%). During the 1990s, income distribution also worsened \nin rural areas, but improved slightly in urban areas. The increase in poverty is attributed mainly \nto declining economic growth, lack of social safety nets, persistence of severe macroeconomic \nimbalances,  reduced  flow  of  remittances  from  out-of-country  Pakistani  workers,  and  poor \ngovernance.  \n \nPoverty  intervention  is  a  critical  theme  of  the  Project.  The  direct  and  indirect  potential  for \nreducing   poverty  through  road  improvement  will  be  realized  through  (i)  increased  access  to \nmarkets, (ii) improved transportation of goods between areas of surplus and areas of deficit, \n(iii) reduced transport costs (potentially reduced cost of freight and goods as well as passenger \nfares),  (iv)  increased  food  security,  and  (v)  increased  employment  opportunities.  Improved \ntransportation will improve the distribution of social services to the villages along the project \nroads. Local medical clinics and educational facilities will receive better support. Furthermore, \nroad  construction  will  create  higher  levels  of  income  from  agriculture  and  crop  production;  a \ndemand for agricultural labor, wage rates, and wage income; and income from business and \nindustries. \n \nThe Project  will  generate  employment  for  people  along  the  route.  Unskilled  laborers  will  be \nemployed  directly  in  road  construction  and  maintenance  and  indirectly  by  providing  material \nand services to the construction and maintenance activities.  \n \nMore  important  are  the  long-term  impacts  of  the  Project.    These  are  narrowing  the  gap  of \nintradistrict  disparities  and  providing  the  poor,  unemployed  youth,  and  women  with  better \naccess to services and economic opportunities.   \nB. \n \nBased  on  the  official  poverty  line  set  by  the  Government,  55%  of  the  total  population  in  the \nproject area live below the poverty line (i.e., per capita income of less than PRs650 per month).  \nIn  the  latest  report  of  the  Social  Policy  and  Developmen t  Center    (SPDC),  the  26  districts  in \nBalochistan, Quetta, and Musa Khel rank as the least developed and most deprived.  \n \nA  survey  of  the  53  proposed  roads  in  22  districts  shows  that  (i)  55%  of  the  population  live \nbelow the poverty line, (ii) the education  level  in  the  districts  is  low  (only  51%  of  males  and \n81% of females have primary education), (iii) 45% of the population are landless, and 58% do \nnot own any land to cultivate.  \n \nDuring group interviews, perceptions of the Project were elicited from the local communities.  \nThe  major  findings  are  that  the  Project  will  (i)  be  beneficial  as  it  will  generate  employment \nopportunities  for  the  people,  (ii)  improve  access  to  social  services  such  as  health  and \neducation, (iii) reduce transportation costs, (iv) improve their income as they can easily bring \ntheir goods to markets, (v) increase food security, and (vi) increase mobility of the population.  \nThe  communities  expect  the  Project  to  make  a  positive  impact  on  their  lives  by  raising  the \nstandard of living and reducing poverty in the province. \n \nPoverty  reduction  will  be  monitored  during  and  after  construction  to  assess  the  impact  of  the \nProject on the poor.

The  project  roads  are  of  three  types:  (i)  national  highways,  (ii)  provincial  highways, \nand  (iii)  rural  access  roads.  They  include  two  national  highway  sections,  namely  Quetta\u2013Kalat \nRoad  (N25,  130  km)  and  Quetta\u2013Chamman  Road  (N25,  117  km)  and  six  selected  \"core\" \nprovincial  roads,  comprising  three  provincial  highways,  namely:    Kach\u2013Shahrag\u2013Harnai Road \n(95 km), Zhob\u2013Mir Ali Khail\u2013Khajuri Kach Road (101 km), and Nag\u2013Punjgur Road (85 km); and, \nthree  rural  access  roads,  namely:  Gulistan\u2013Sagi  Bazar\u2013Kandel  Road  (13  km),  Dera  Allahyar\u2013\nHairdin Road (40 km), and Khurkhera\u2013Kanraj Road (24 km).  \n \n2. \nThe  Balochistan  provincial  government  (BPG)  selected  the  core  provincial  roads  from \nroads prioritized by the project preparatory technical assistance consultants for (i) a geographic \nspread  over  different  agro-ecological  zones  and  major  tribes  (Pashtoon  and  Baloch)  of  the \nprovince;  (ii)  minimal  adverse  resettlement  impact  on  the  adjacent  populations;  (iii)  poverty \nreduction;  (iv)  the  likelihood  of  positive  socioeconomic  impacts  on  the  province\u2019s  population, \nparticularly  the  poor  and  other  vulnerable  groups;  (v)  economic  viability;  (vi)  intradistrict \nconnectivity  with  markets  and  towns;  and  (vii)  interdistrict,  interprovincial,  and  international \nconnectivity. The same selection criteria will serve largely as guiding principles for the remaining \nnon-core roads under this sector Project.  \n \n3. \nThe National Highway Authority (NHA) and the Communications and Works Department \n(CWD) will be the Executing Agencies (EAs) for their res pective roads. Each EA will establish a \nProject Directorate in Quetta, which will have a Road Environment and Social Assessment Cell \n(RESAC)  headed  by  a  deputy  director,  an  executive  engineer-level  officer  to  ensure  proper \nplanning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  all  land  acquisition  and  resettlement-related \nactivities. For noncore roads, each RESAC will conduct proper impact assessment, screen for \npossible land acquisition and resettlement effects and prepare a subproject Resettlement Plan \n(RP), full or short as required, for review and approval by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nbefore a civil works contract is issued.   \n \n4. \nThis RP was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and \nADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Resettlement.  The  RP  covers  all  eight  core  roads  projects  and  presents \nthe  scope  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  remedial  measures  for  mitigating  adverse \nimpacts, and how and when these measures will be implemented. It is based on the census and \nsocioeconomic assessment of the potentially affected persons (APs). Thus, this RP will serve as \na  model  for  RP  preparation  for  other  non-core  subprojects.  The  preparation  of  an  indigenous \npeoples  development  plan  (IPDP),  following  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples,  is  not \nrequired for this Project because the two ethnic groups (Baloches and Pathans) identified during \nthe study are all integrated into the mainstream life of the province.  \n \nB. \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n5. \nThe proposed improvements will be  carried  out  largely  within  the  existing  right-of-way \n(ROW)  of  the  project  roads.  But  the  proposed  widening  will  require  additional  2-  to  3-  meter-\nwide strips of land on either side of most project roads. Over 90% of the lengths of the selected \ncore  project  roads  pass  through  nonproductive  barren  lands,  which  are  known  as  statelands. \nFor  the  remaining  5-10%  lengths  of  the  roads,  the  lands  are  owned  by  individuals  who  utilize \nthem  beneficially,  i.e.,  for  agricultural  purposes  in  open  areas  and  for  residential  and/or \ncommercial purposes in built-up areas. These lands will be acquired as per provisions and rules \n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 17 \n\n \n\nlaid  down  in  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  1894  (LAA,  amended)  in  conjunction  with  ADB\u2019s \nresettlement policy and guidelines.  \n \n6. \nAn  estimated  area  of  42  hectares  (ha)  will  need  to  be  acquired  for  the  two  national \nhighways  (24  ha)  and  the  six  core  project  roads  (18  ha).  These  are  all  privately  owned \nproductive and/or built-up areas, excluding the nonproductive tribal commons or statelands. The \nproductive lands have mostly fruit orchards. Land acquisition will also affect an estimated 1,750 \ntrees? 1,150 are fruit trees and 600 are wood trees (timber/firewood).   As a result of additional \nland  acquisition  for  the  two  national  highways  and  six  core  provincial  project  roads,  an \nestimated 344 people will be affected: 274 landowners and 70 tenants. Some realignments and \nbypasses may be necessary to minimize or avoid displacement in congested built-up areas and \nurban centers, which may be identified and decided upon later when the design is finalized. The \nrealignments  and  bypasses  (if  any)  will  require  the  acquisition  of  additional  landstrips  as  new \nto  minimize  adverse  resettlement  and \nROW.  New  ROW  will  be  selected  carefully \nsocioeconomic impacts. A complete inventory and valuation of the private lands to be acquired \nand  the  structures  and  other  assets  affected  will  be  carried  out  and  this  RP  will  be  revised \naccordingly. \n \n7. \nA full census of  all  potentially affected households, small business enterprises (SBEs) \nand community/cultural structures along the project corridor of impact (the proposed formation \nwidth)  was  conducted  on  the  eight  selected  roads  in  April-May  2003.  The  Project  will  partly \naffect  143  structures/assets,  of  which  80  are  shops/SBEs,  39  are  residential  houses,  5  are \ncultural/community structures (mosques, etc.), 2 are enclosed fruit orchards, and the remaining \n17  are  other  structures/asset,  including  10  abandoned  dilapidated  structures.  The  Project  will \nassist all structure owners to relocate on the available ROW land (out of the formation widths) \nso that APs can reestablish their businesses and restore their incomes with least disruption. \n \n8. \ncore project roads and the two national highways (247 km). \n \nC. \n\nLand  acquisition  and  removal  of  built-up  structures  affect  358  people  on  the  provincial \n\nObjectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n\nIn  Pakistan,  the  Land  Acquisition  Act  of  1894  (as  amended)  is  the  core  legal  tool  the \n9. \nGovernment uses to acquire private lands for a public purpose. Under the provisions of the act, \ncash  compensation  for  land  is  paid  at  the  market  rate  to  affected  landowners,  and  for  the \naffected crops only to registered tenants. The legal framework does not cover illegal occupants, \nsquatters,  and  encroachers.  In  many  project-specific  cases,  however,  the  governments  of \nPakistan  and  the  other  provinces  (Sindh,  Punjab  and  North  West  Frontier  Province)  have \nassisted project-affected persons even without any legal titles.  \n \nPakistan  has  no  specific  policy  on  resettlement.  In  the  absence  of  a  formal  policy  to \n10. \nassist  nontitled  persons,  a  project-specific  set  of  resettlement  principles  consistent  with  ADB \npolicy  requirements  was  adopted  in  this  Project.    As  a  result,  APs,  owners  and  tenants  of \nacquired  lands  and  affected  structures  (SBEs,  houses,  etc.),  are  entitled  to  a  combination  of \ncompensation  measures  and  resettlement  assistance,  depending  on  the  nature  of  their \nownership rights to lost/affected assets and scope of the impact, including social and economic \nvulnerability of the APs. In general terms, the APs will be compensated for the loss of lands and \nstructures/assets,  and  assisted  to  restore  their  SBEs,  livelihoods,  and  cultural/community \nstructures/assets.

The  Project  has  strong  support  and  positive  public  response  as \n11. \nextensive  community  awareness  and  consultation  programs  among  the  affected/beneficiary \ncommunities were carried out during the field surveys. A total of 97 group interviews (men and \nwomen  groups)  were  conducted  along  the  core  project  roads.  During  project  implementation, \nRESAC, assisted by the local nongovernment organization (NGO) and a resettlement specialist \nfrom  the  construction  supervision  consultants,  will  continue  to  prepare  and  implement  the \ninformation and community consultation program in the project areas. \n \n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 17 \n\n \n\n12. \nDisclosure of the RP.  When the project design is finalized and the RP is subsequently \nrevised,  the  Project  will  publish  a  project  grief  on  its  scope  and  objectives,  including \nresettlement entitlements for APs, in both English and Urdu languages and distribute the same \namong  the  roadside  communities,  particularly  the  APs,  by  December  2003,  at  the  latest. \nGenerally,  All  literate  people  understand  Urdu  language.  If  necessary,  however,  the  brochure \nwill also be translated into Pashto, Brahvi, and Balochi languages.  In addition, RESAC and the \nlocal NGO will hold discussion sessions with groups of APs to further explain and, if necessary, \nrefine/improve the project brief. \n \nGrievances  Redress  Committee.  Provisions  of  LAA-1894  enable  aggrieved  APs  to \n13. \npresent  their  cases  to  the  Land  Acquisition  Collector\u2019  office  or  to  a  court  of  law  to  have  their \ngrievances  redressed  and  disputes  resolved.  The  Project  will  establish  a  grievance  redress \ncommittee \n(union  council, \nfrom \nsubdistrict/District  nazims),  local  NGOs/CBOs,  respective  EAs  (NHA  and  CWD)  and APs. The \nGRC aims to provide a mechanism to mediate conflict and cut down on lengthy litigation, which \noften delays infrastructure projects.   \n \nResettlement  Advisory  Committee.  The  resettlement  advisory  committee  (RAC)  will \n14. \nencourage  local  participation,  ensure  full  transparency  and  accountability  for  the  resettlement \nprogram  and  people\u2019s  entitlements,  and  safeguard  the  rights  of  the  most  vulnerable  peoples \naffected by the Project. The RAC will comprise representatives from the APs, NGO, CWD, and \nother stakeholders. Women will be represented on the RAC. The RAC will provide coordinating \nnodes  for  land  acquisition  and  compensation,  and  relocation,  and  resettlement,  and  will  assist \nthe APs in all possible ways to minimize disruption and hardship during relocation.  \n \nE. \n\nIncome Restoration Strategy \n\nlocal  government \n\nrepresentatives \n\n(GRC),  with \n\nthe \n\n15. \nThe  entitlement  matrix  (Table  A17.1)  aims  to  compensate  APs  for  their  losses  and  to \nprovide  measures  to  minimize  resettlement  effects  and  restore  or  improve  the  APs's \nincome/standard of living. Based on extensive consultations with the affected business owners \nand  other  stakeholders,  affected  SBEs  will  relocate  on  their  own  upon  receipt  of  full \ncompensation  and  before  the  start  of  civil  works.    The  project  directorates  will  notify  their \nrespective  APs  about  6  months  ahead  of  the  scheduled  start  of  construction  works.    The  APs \nwill  be  allowed  to  take  the  salvageable  materials  for  reconstructing  their  shops  and  will  be \nassisted during relocation. The RESAC and the local NGO will assist the local business leaders \nand affected shop owners with better land use planning and will organize the relocated business \narea, taking into account traffic and safety of the road users.  \n \nF. \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\nEach EA will establish RESAC within its project directorate to implement the RP. Each \n16. \nEA will also engage a local NGO to help implement the RP, particularly for social preparation, \ndisclosure  of  RP,  public  consultation,  road  safety  awareness,  and  other  resettlement-related \nactivities,  including  grievance  redress.  A  resettlement  specialist  from  the  project  supervision \nconsultants  will  also  give  technical  assistance  in  resettlement  planning,  implementation, \nmonitoring and evaluation.  \n \nG. \n\nResettlement Budget and Financing \n\n17. \nThe  total  estimated  cost  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  expected  to  be  in  the \namount of PRs.207.1 million ($3.6 million). The total RP implementation budget is estimated for \n20  CWD  roads  included  in  the  sector  Project  at  PRs.159.1  million  ($2.77  million),  and  for  the \ntwo  NHA  roads  at  PRs.48.0  million  (US$0.83  million).  Balochistan's  CWD  will  be  spending \nPRs.44.5  million  ($0.78  million)  on  RP  implementation  on  the  six  core  project  roads,  and  the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n \nB. \n\nAppendix 17  61\n\nremaining  amount  of  PRs.114.3  million  ($2.0  million)  on  14  non-core  subprojects.

The  framework \napplies to activities prepared after Board approval and during loan implementation.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nduring project implementation will apply. \n \n\nThe following procedures in preparing a resettlement plan (RP) for noncore road projects \n\nProcedures \n\nSubprojects with possible land acquisition and resettlement effects are screened \nto ensure their consistency with ADB's policy on involuntary resettlement; \nResettlement effects are identified and avoided or minimized; \nThe need for a full or short RP is determined in accordance with the criteria set in \nADB's Handbook for Resettlement,1  \nThe  project  engineering  cell  prepares  each  subproject  RP  when  required.  The \nRP is submitted for approval to ADB and is implemented before the award of civil \nworks contracts. \n\nScope  \n\n \nC. \n \n3. \n\nThe resettlement framework has the following elements: \n\nScope  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  This  covers  (a)  the  scope  and \nreasons  for  subproject  resettlement,  maps,  any  alternative  options to minimize \nland  acquisition,  and  main  resettlement  effects;  (b)  likely  resettlement  risks \nimpoverishment  or  increased  vulnerability  for  key  stakeholders;  and  (c)  primary \nresponsibilities for resettlement. \nSocioeconomic information. This comprise (a) census data, including numbers \nand spatial distribution of people affected by different types of loss; (b) methods \nfor conducting socioeconomic surveys; (c) asset inventory; (d) likely resettlement \neffects;  (e)  all  resettlement  losses;  (f)  socioeconomic  survey  data  of  affected \npersons  (APS) \nincome  and \nexpenditure by key social groups; (g) definition of severely affected households; \n(h)  impact  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  (the  destitute,  widows,  disabled, \netc.) and any special measures needed for them, e.g., social preparation, special \nassistance in relocation. \n\nincluding  household  size,  composition,  and \n\nObjectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements.  \n\n \nD. \n \n4. \nIn Pakistan, the Land Acquisition Act (LAA) of 1894 (as amended) is the core legal tool \nthe Government uses to acquire private lands for a public purpose. Under the provisions of the \nact,  cash  compensation  is  paid  at  the  market  rate  to  affected  landowners  for  land,  and  to \nregistered  tenants  for  the  affected  crops  only.  The  legal  framework  does  not  cover  squatters \nand  encroachers.  In  many  project-specific  cases,  however,  the  governments  of  Pakistan  and \n\n                                                 \n1  A  full  resettlement  plan  should  be  prepared  if  the  subproject  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  affected  people.   \nResettlement  will  be  \u201csignificant\u201d  where  200  or  more  people  will  experience  major  impacts .  \u201cMajor\u201d  impacts \nconstitute  being  physically  displaced  from  housing  and/or  losing  more  than  10%  of  the  household\u2019s  productive \n(income generating) assets.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 18  63\n\nthe  other  provinces  (Sindh,  Punjab,  and  NWFP)  have  assisted  even  project-affected persons \nwithout any legal titles.  \n \n5. \nPakistan  has  no  specific  policy  on  resettlement.  In  the  absence  of  a  formal  policy  to \nassist  persons  with  no  title  to  land,  a  project-specific set of resettlement principles consistent \nwith  ADB's  policy  requirements  was  adopted  in  this  Project.  As  a  result,  the  APs,  the owners \nand  tenants  of  acquired  lands  and  affected  structures  (small  business  enterprises  (SBEs), \nhouses,  etc.)  are  entitled  to  a  combination  of  compensation  measures  and  resettlement \nassistance, depending on the nature of their ownership rights to lost/affected assets and scope \nof the impact, and the social and economic vulnerability of the APs. In general terms, the APs \nwill be compensated for loss of lands and structures/assets and assisted to restore their SBEs, \nlivelihoods, and cultural/community struc tures/assets.

An executive engineer \nwill be appointed as the deputy director of the Road Environment and Social Assessment Cell \n(DD/RESAC),  in  charge  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  operations,  and  will  report  to  the \nproject  director.  The  DD/RESAC  will  plan,  implement  and  monitor  RP  activities  in  close \npartnership  with  theAPs,  affected/concerned  district  governments,  land  acquisition collectors \n(LACs),  field  offices,  local  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  hired  to  assist  in  RP \nimplementation,  resettlement  specialist  from  the  project  supervision  consultants,  grievance \nredress  committees  (GRCs),  and  resettlement  advisory  committees  (RACs).  In  addition,  the \nRESAC  will  be  responsible  for  periodic  internal  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  project \nactivities.  A  panel  of  experts  will  be  engaged  to  evaluate  RP  implementation.  Independent \nevaluations will be undertaken twice annually for  the first 2 years and then annually during the \nremaining Project period. \n \nH. \n \nThis  will  cover  (i)  measures  for  planning  for  land  acquisition  and  budgeting  and \n9. \nresettlement costs, annual budget, and sources of funding; (ii) arrangements for approval of RP \ncost estimates; and (iii) the flow of funds to reach APs and the contingency arrangements. Also \nincluded  are  guarantees  to  finance  any  additional  costs  required  to  meet  the  resettlement \nobjectives,  and  confirmation  of  the  delivery  of  entitlements  to  APs  on  time.  NHA/CWD  will \nensure the prompt provision and efficient flow of the budgeted funds. \n \nI. \n \n10. \nAn  indicative  schedule  for  RP  preparation  and  implementation  in  relation  to  technical \nworks will be prepared. It will show the time schedule of all resettlement activities, the start and \nfinish dates before acquisition/demolition and procedures for implementing the key elements. \n \nJ. \n \n11. \nThere  will  be  arrangements  for  internal  and  independent  monitoring  and  evaluation  for \nRPs,  including  plans,  timing,  resources,  and  indicators  for  internal  monitoring  and  external \nindependent  evaluation  of  resettlement  targets;  and  an  assessment  of  the  capacity  of  internal \nand external monitoring and evaluation units.  \n\nResettlement Budget and Financing \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 19 \n\n  65\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT  \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \nThe Project is categorized as a B Project according to the environmental assessment guidelines \n1. \nof  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Therefore,  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  of  the \nsample subprojects were prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines. This appendix is \nbased on the IEE report of the sample projects and includes the assessment of the environmental impact \non the sector.   \n \nB. \n\nOverview of the Environmental Assessment of the Sector Impacts  \n\nBalochistan  Province's    existing  environmental  problems  are  dominated  by  desertification, \n2. \nshortage of water due to lack of groundwater recharge, declining biodiversity, soil erosion and salination, \nand  urban  pollution  especially  water  contamination.  Although  environmental  protection  and  related \nnatural  resource  management  regulations  such  forest  legislation  exist  in  Pakistan,  the  present \nenvironmental  administration  in  Balochistan  is  very  weak.  The  Environmental  Protection  Ordinance  of \n1983  requires  environmental  assessment  to  be  submitted  to  the  provincial  Environmental  Protection \nAgency (EPA) for approval before any project is implemented. However, this practice was only recently \nimplemented in Balochistan. \n \n3. \nImproving  the  road  network,  as  the  main  transport  infrastructures  in  Balochistan  will  benefit  the \nprovince  by  improving  connectivity  and  facilitating  traffic  movement  between  rural  areas  and  state \nnational  highways.  However,  it  will  also  generate  environmental  costs  related  to  road  construction and \noperation.  Increased  mobility  will  lead  to  increased  production  and  service  sectors,  and  therefore  to \nincreasing deterioration of the environment and natural resources if appropriate mitigation measures are \nnot applied. The environmental impacts associated with construction to improve the road networks will be \naddressed and handled mainly by the road authorities. However, dealing with the impact related to the \noperation of the road networks will involve other institutions and civil society. Better coordination among \nagencies  including  civil  society  is  needed  to  anticipate  and  prevent  environmental  problems.  Since  the \nProject  will  strengthen  the  provincial  Communication  and  Works  Department  (CWD)  and  establish  the \nRoad,  Environment,  and  Social  As sessment  Cell  (RESAC),  it  is  expected  that  RESAC  can  facilitate \ncoordination  to  address  and  handle  environmental  problems  related  to  the  transport  sector  in  more \nsustainable and systematic ways.  In addition, the technical assistance loan, which basically  focuses on \nempowering civil society, will become a complementary component to maximize the project benefits and \nreduce any social and environmental costs related to the Project. \n \nC. \n\nSummary of the IEE of the Sample Subproject \n\n1. \n\nProject Description \n\n \n4. \nThe roads surveyed for the project covered 2,500 kilometers (km) in 21 districts of Balochistan. \nSubsequently,  another  31  roads  508  km  long  in  Kalat  district  were  added.  The  National  Highway \nAuthority (NHA) and the government of Balochistan selected eight roads after initial prioritization: three \nrural  access  roads  (RARs),  three  provincial  highways  (PHs),  and  two  national  highways  (NHs).  The \nRARs and PHs will involve construction or rehabilitation of the existing roads or tracks 3.7 meters wide \nand with a 2-meter shoulder on each side. The NHs will involve widening the existing roads to 7.3 meter. \nFor all roads, culverts, bridges, and drainage will be rehabilitated. \n \n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 19 \n\n2. \n\n \n \n5. \nsummarized here. \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Condition of the Project Area \n\nThe environmental conditions of the project area particularly along the road alignment are briefly \n\n6. \nGulistan-Sagi  Bazar-Kandel  Road  (RAR).  The  present  kutcha  track  of  13  km  starts  from \nGulistan and ends at Kandel Road. It is flanked with fruit, vegetable, and wheat farms, irrigated mainly by \ntube wells.  Water in this area has been pumped from a groundwater table at a depth of 300-600 feet. \nFarmers  use  the  road  to  transport  agricultural  products  to  market. The present road crosses two small \nstreams. The RAR does not pass through forest/game reserve, wildlife sanctuary, or any protected area. \nNo endangered plant and animal species have been reported.  \n \n7. \nKhurkhera\u2013Kanraj  Road  (RAR).  The  present  track  extends  to  24  km  Lasbela  district  starting \nfrom 25 km after  Khurkhera connection from NH25 and ending at village Pehi. The area is characterized \nby  low-fertility  gravel  type  soil  on  small  bare  mountains  with  low  rainfall.  There  is  no  agriculture  in  the \narea  and  the  inhabitants  depend  on  livestock  only.  The  area  used  to  have  fish  and  chicken farms, but \nthese  were  ruined  by  the  recent  drought.  Most  of  the  land  is  devoid  of  any  tree  cover  but  sporadic \nbushes  are  found  in  patches.  The  road  passes  through  flat  drylands  where  no  forest/game  reserve, \nwildlife  sanctuary,  or  any  protected  areas  have  been  encountered.  No  endangered  plant  and  animal \nspecies have been reported.  \n \n8. \nDera  Allahyar\u2013Hairdin Road (RAR). This is 40 km road starts from Dera Allahyar near NH65) \nand ends at Hairdin. The road also leads to the Sui Gas fields. This is the only  road in Balochistan that \npasses through fertile agricultural lands and has green cover along the road. The area is water rich due \nto the Put-Feeder canal. Limited industrial activity has been reported including brick kilns, cement pipe \nfactory, rice mills, cotton ginning mills, and fish and poultry farms. More animal life is observed here due \nto the presence of water. The RAR passes through canal-irrigated lands, but no forest or game reserves, \nwildlife sanctuary, or protected areas have been encountered. No endangered plant and animal species \nhave been reported.  \n \n9. \nZhob-Mir Ali  Khail-Khajuri  Kach  Road  (PH).  This  provincial  single  carriageway  originates  at \nZhob  (linking  with  NH50)  and  ends  at  Khajuri  Kach.  The  road  is  located  at  the  extreme  north  of  the \nprovince connecting Balochistan to North West Frontiner Province via Tank.  The land along the highway \nis highly mountainous with steep slopes and  current pathway riding conditions are poor.  Topography is \nundulating for the first 11 km while hilly areas occur for the rest of the road. The road meanders along \nGomal, Zhob, and other rainwater streams, where isolated and protruding rocky mountains are located.  \nThere is a katcha (unpaved) shingle track to Mughal Kot, 80 km from Zhob, and another 20 km track that \ncannot sustain any type of traffic. Grapes and apricot are major fruits being grown. Forest cover is rare in \nthe area, except greenery and agro-based activity along the river where water flows even during drought. \nIn rainy season, all water channels are full, disrupting the transport route and emergency supplies to the \nlocal  people.  The  groundwater  table  is  in  the  range  of  50-100  feet  in  and  around  Zhob.  Agroforestry \nalong water channels has provided alternate habitats for many birds, insects etc. A few unexplored coal \nmines at the end of the road may be exploited on completion of the road. In contrast with that of other \nselected  roads,  this  area  is  relatively  less  polluted  by  dust  due  to  better  vegetative  cover.  Most  of  the \ncorridor  along  this  road  consists  of  gravel-type  mountains  with  possibility  of  some  landslides.  The \nhighway  does  not  pass  through  forest  or  game  reserve,  wildlife  sanctuary,  or  any  protected  area.  No \nendangered species have been reported.  \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 19 \n\n  67\n\n Nag\u2013Punjgur  Road  (PH).  This  PH  originates  at  the  outskirts  of  Panjgur  and  ends  at  Nag \n10. \n(Kharan and Panjgur districts). Current PH riding conditions are not good and the PH is unpaved (katcha \ntrack  with  loose  gravel  top).  Fruit  farms  are  observed  only  in  Panjgur  area.  Beyond  Panjgur,  very  little \nhabitation is possible because drought conditions, sandy soils, and hardened surfaces make it unfit for \nvegetation  and  fruit  farming.  Again  the  water  table  is  reported  to  be  lower  than  in  other  parts  of \nBalochistan, i.e., 25-300 feet deep but is not extracted because financial resources of the inhabitants are \nlow. Wind is reportedly strong most of the year along the road and can be used to generate electricity, \npumping water, etc. Population density along the roads is low. The road runs almost on level ground with \nsandy  soil  and  gravel-black  mountains  devoid  of  any  bushes  or  trees,  adjoining  vast  stretches  of \nuncultivated  dry  field.  The  area  has  very  little  green  cover  or  plantations  as  a  whole  and  faces \nsandstorms regularly resulting in visibility problems. The road crosses a number of dried-up streams and \nrivers including Rakhshan River, Surab River, and Sabzab Nullah. No forest or game reserves, wildlife \nsanctuary, protected areas, or endangered species have been reported.  \n \n11. \nKach\u2013Shahrag\u2013Harnai Road (PH). This unpaved provincial road starts from Kach located 71 km \nfrom Quetta on Quetta-Ziarat Road and ends at Harnai. It covers two districts of Ziarat and Sibi. There is \nan old outdated railway tunnel through which the current road passes, constructed to avoid land sliding \nonto the railway tracks. A few pockets of loose soil were observed, which makes landslides and erosion \nof the embankment common. Pockets close to the riverbed show scattered fruit and vegetable farms and \nmedicinal  herbs.  Some  parts  of  the  valley  along  the  road  depend  on  surface  rainwater  flowing  through \nthe  rivers  and  is  called  barani-fed  areas,  with  groundwater  table  as  low  as  200  feet.  Other  areas  have \ngroundwater at a depth of 500-800 feet. During the heavy monsoon season flooding closes portions of \nthe road. The highway crosses the river Khost, which had water flowing throughout the year before the \ndry  spell  of  the  past  5-6  years,  requiring  a  number  of  bridges  on  the  river  and  eroding  bases  of  the \nexisting road. This road is used to transport fruits/vegetables to markets, coal to nearby thermal power \nplants  and  other  users  in  Balochistan  and  Punjab;  and  to  bring  wood  from  Punjab.  Coal  mining  is \ncommon in Harnai, which has four railway stations involved in coal transport throughout the country. The \nrailway line runs from Khost to Harnai and beyond.  The highway passes through partially irrigated lands, \nbut  there  is  no  forest  or  game  reserve,  wildlife  sanctuary,  or  any  protected  areas.    No  endangered \nspecies have been reported.  \n \n12. \nQuetta-Kalat Road (NH). This section of the road starts from the outskirts of Quetta and ends at \nKalat.   This road is an important part of NH25 originating from Karachi to Chamman and would be the \nkey route to Afghanistan and further north to the Central Asian republics. This highway passes through \npartially irrigated lands with fruit and agricultural farms. Soil is patchy, with gravel on most of the route, \nbut sandy soil occurs after Pringabad with typical desert bushes in the area. The land is fertile but lacks \nwater resources and supply and depends heavily on either pumping of underground water or rainwater \nharvesting.  The  water  table  depth  varies  from  350  to  600  feet  in  towns  along  the  highway.  The  road \ncrosses a number of small towns and markets like Pringabad, Mastung, Mangochar, and Kalat.  At Lakh \npass, an 80-m mountain cut is being established to minimize gradient and turning. Heavy winds and dust \nstorms  are  typical  in  certain  areas,  especially  after  Pringabad.  Mixed  types  of  trees  are  planted  near \nMastung.  This  area  is  designated  as  an  earthquake  zone.  Its  history  of  earthquakes  in  the  recent  past \ndictates  the  architecture  of  homes  which  are  constructed  with  mud  to  minimize  losses  and  blend  with \nnature.  The  project  road  is  5  km  away  from  the  Hazarghanji  Park.    No  other  forest  or  game  reserve, \nwildlife  sanctuary,  or  any  protected  areas  have  been  encountered.  No  endangered  species  have  been \nreported.  \n \n13. \nQuetta\u2013Chamman  Road  (NH).    The  road  starts  from  the  outskirts  of  Quetta  and  ends  at \nChamman. It forms part of the integrated program for improvement and upgrading of NH25 from Karachi \nto Chamman. All rivers and streams have dried up. Land in the corridor consists of loose soil without any \ntree  cover.  In  windy  weather,  dust  storms  are  common.  The  few  inhabitants  of  the  area  depend  on \n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 19 \n\n3. \n\nScreening Potential Impact and Mitigation Measures \n\nlivestock. Close to Quetta, a few stone crushers operate. Brick kilns using local coal with high emissions \nof visible smoke are scattered along the road to Chamman. The road passes through a number of towns: \nBeleli,  Kuchlak,  Yaru,  Saranan,  Jungle  Pir  Ali  Zai,  Killa  Abdullah,  ShelaBagh,  Khojak  Pass,  and \nChamman.  Travel  time  between  Quetta  and  Chamman  is  around  2  hours  20  minutes  with  the  existing \ncondition of the road. A small dried-up river/stream winds along the road after Killa Abdulllah for 20-30 \nkm and the existing road alignment crosses a number of rainwater streams. Kojak mountain terrain near \nShelabagh  is  a  difficult  terrain  with  high  water-induced  landslides  and  erodible  soil.  The  PH  passes \nthrough  scantily  irrigated  lands  where  no  forest  or  game  reserve,  wildlife  sanctuary,  or  any  protected \nareas have been encountered.  No endangered species have been reported.  \n \n \n \nNo  significant  environmental  impact  is  expected  due  to  location  because  the  Project  will  be \n14. \nconfined  to  rehabilitating  existing  roads  and  does  not  include  roads  located  nearby  or  within  reserve \nareas or wildlife sanctuaries. Environmental impacts may include (i) disrupted traffic in the construction \narea,  (ii)  increased  air  pollution  due  to  increased  dust  and  other  volatile  chemical  substances  from  the \nasphalt  plant,  (iii)  noise  and  vibration,  (iv)  disrupted  water  systems  due  to  cut  and  fill  and  other \nearthwork, and (v) potential landslides associated with elevating the road. Such impacts will occur only \nduring the construction period. Mitigation measures will include (i) rerouting traffic during the construction \nstage; (ii) maintaining optimum moisture content during handling of soil, spraying water to minimize dust, \nand maintaining a safe distance between asphalt plants and public facilities including schools; (iii) strictly \ncontrolling  the  construction  works  that  create  noise  and  vibration  by  prohibiting  night  work  near \nresidential areas; (iv) pumping stagnant water and providing adequate drainage systems; (v) stabilizing \nroad embankment sideslopes; (vi) avoiding road widening at ponds and widening roads only on one side \nto  avoid  excessive  tree  cutting;  (vii)  planting  trees;  and  (viii)  establishing  forums  to  communicate with \naffected  persons.  All  these  mitigation  measures  will  be  included  in  the  contract  documents  for  the \ncontractor.  All  the  impacts  are  clearly  temporary  and  manageable.  However,  special  attention  to \nimplementing  environmental  mitigation  is  needed  for  the  following:(i)  roads  connecting  Zhob  to  Khajuri \nand  Quetta-Chamman  due  to  the  need  for  heavy  cutting  of  mountains  and  landslide  problems;  and  (ii) \nroad connecting Dera Allahyar to Hairdin due to potential accidents related to the gas pipeline. Improving \nthe  road  will  reduce  dust,  but  it  will  also  increase  traffic,  which  might  increase  air  pollution  related  to \nmotor  vehicle  operation.  Since  the  cause  of  the  impacts  are  beyond  the  responsibility  of  the  EA,  it  is \nnecessary that the EA maintain tree planting along the road to minimize the impact of vehicle emission \non public health and to maintain the embankment to avoid erosion. Borrow pit operations will be strictly \ncontrolled  (e.g.,  no  borrow  pits  will  be  allowed  in  agriculture  lands  or  areas  prone  to  erosion  and \nlandslide, and former borrow pit areas will be rehabilitated). Consultations carried out with communities \nin  the  surrounding  project  areas  during  the  IEE  noted  that  the  people  expected  the  Project  to  benefit \nthem  by  providing  quicker  assistance  for  medical  patients,  minimum  fares,  and  shorter  time  for  their \nagricultural produce to reach the market.  \n \n\n4. \n\nInstitutional Arrangement for Monitoring and Implementing Environmental \nManagement Plan \n\n \n15. \nThe  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  covers  ac tions to ensure that mitigation measures \nand monitoring of theie implementation throughout project implementation and operation are part of the \nIEE. The EMP stated that, during construction impacts associated with earthwork (e.g., siltation, erosion, \ndust, noise) need to be carefully mitigated. During operation, air pollution due to vehicle emissions and \ncontamination of oil are impacts that need to be handled. Implementation of the mitigation measures will \nbe  monitored  in  accordance  with  the  Government  and ADB's environmental assessment requirements. \nThe  report  on  EMP  implementation  should  be  submitted  to  ADB  annually.  Based  on  the  EMP, \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 19 \n\n  69\n\nimplementating  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  stage  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the \ncontractor.  \n \n16. \nAn  environmental  specialist  will  be  hired  as  part  of  the  consultant  team  for  implementing  the \nProject and will assist the RESAC in Balochistan CWD to prepare contractual documents so that the bid \ndocuments  and  other  obligations  of  the  contractors  clearly  identify  their  environmental  responsibilities \nand  describe  penalties  for  noncompliance.  In  addition,  the  environmental  specialist  as  part  of  the \nconsultant\u2019s  team  will  also  provide  recommendations  to  the  engineering  design  team  to  address \nenvironmental  concerns,  and  supervise  monitoring  of  mitigation  measures  implementation  during  the \nconstruction  stage.  To  deal  with  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  operation,  particularly  with \nincreasing  vehicle  emission,  oil  contamination  due  to  spillage  and  linkage,  Balochistan  CWD  will \nstrengthen  coordination  with  relevant  agencies  to  minimize  the  impacts.  CWD  and  its  RESAC  will \nimplement overall environmental monitoring and management, while NHA will implement its EMP.  \n \n \n \nThe  present  IEE  reveals  that  few  environmental  impacts  are  likely  to  occur  due  to  the \n17. \nconstruction activities; normal operations of the proposed rehabilitation project and recommendations are \nsuggested accordingly for mitigating these perceived impacts. A  full  environmental impact assessment \n(EIA) for roads involved in this Project is not required. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Criteria for Subproject Selection  \n\nFinding and Recommendations \n\n5. \n\n18. \n\nThe following selection criteria will be adopted for the follow on subprojects: \n\nThe subproject will not involve  any widening of rights-of-way of the existing roads located \nwithin  the  areas  declared  as  environmentally  and  socially  sensitive  (e.g.,  national  parks, \nsanctuaries, cultural heritage).  \nThe  Project  will  involve  only  the  subprojects  that  comply  with  all necessary Government \nenvironmental  requirements  such  as  a  no  objection  certification  from  Pakistan  or \nBalochistan EPA. \n\nReview Procedures for the Environmental Assessment of the Follow-on Subprojects \n\nThe EIA for the follow-up subproject will be prepared and reviewed by the following procedures: \n\nThe  IEE  (including  the  EMP)  for  all  follow-on  subprojects  must  be  prepared  by  the \nenvironmental  specialist  as  part  of  the  consultant  team.  If  any  significant  environmental \nimpact is predicted, an EIA will also be prepared. \nDuring the IEE/EIA, adequate consultations with affected groups will be carried out and a \nreport on these consultations will be an appendix of the IEE/EIA. \nAll  the  IEE  reports  will  be  reviewed  by  RESAC.  All  the  IEE  reports  will  be  submitted  to \nADB  and  the  Pakistan  or  Balochistan  EPA.  The  construction  works  can  start  only  after \nADB concurs with the IEE report and the no objection certificate granted by the Pakistan \nor Balochistan EPA.  \n\n(i) \n\n (ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \nE. \n \n19. \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 October 2003) \n", "Currency Unit \nPRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Pakistan rupee (PRe/PRs) \n$0.0169 \nPRs59.00 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nAC \nAP \nATTA \nBOT \nBPG \nCAS \nCDC \nCSC \nCWD \nEIA \nEIRR \nEMP \nGDP \nGRC \nHDM \nHIV/AIDS \n", "ICB \nIEE \nIRI \nJBIC \nLAA \nLIBOR \nM&E \nMOC \nNGO \nNH \nNHA \nNHC \nNHMP \nNHSC \nPAC \nPH \nPIDC \nPIR \nPMU \nPSP \nRAC \nRAMS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nasphalt concrete \naffected person \nAfghan Transit Trade Agreement \nbuild-operate-transfer \nBalochistan provincial government \ncompulsory acquisition surcharge \ncross-border development component \nconstruction supervision consultant \nCommunication and Works Department \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nEnvironmental Management Plan \ngross domestic product \ngrievance redress committee \nHighway Design and Maintenance Model \nhuman immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \ninternational roughness index \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation  \nLand Acquisition Act \nLondon interbank offered rate \nmonitoring and evaluation \nMinistry of Commerce \nnongovernment organization \nnational highway \nNational Highway Authority \nnational highway component \nNational Highway and Motorway Police \nNational Highway Safety Committee \nprovincial access component \nprovincial highway \nprovincial institutional development component \npoverty impact ratio \nProject Management Unit \nprivate sector participation \nresettlement advisory committee \nRoad Asset Management System \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "RAR \nRESAC \nRMF \nRMU \nROW \nRP \nSBE \nSOP \nTA \nTST \nUNDP \nVOC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "rural access road \nRoad Environment and Social Assessment Cell \nroad maintenance fund \nroad management unit \nright-of-way \nresettlement plan \nsmall business enterprise \nstandard operating procedure \ntechnical assistance \nsurface treatment \nUnited Nations Development Programme \nvehicle operating cost \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  ends  on  30  June.
