The additional financing will support the upgrading of underdeveloped or \noutdated productive rural infrastructure (PRI), thus increasing agricultural and rural productivity. \nIt  also  aims  to  improve  the  integration  of  strengthened  dams  and  reservoirs,  primary  and \nsecondary  canals,  and  access  roads  to  facilitate  increased  agricultural  productivity  and \ndiversification  and  reduce  vulnerability  caused  by  natural  disasters.  This  is  consistent  with the \napproach adopted by the ongoing Productive Rural Infrastructure Sector Project in the Central \nHighlands.3 It directly supports the Government of Viet Nam\u2019s National Target Program for New \nRural  Development,  2010\u20132020,  the  National Water  Resources  Strategy,  2006\u20132020,  and  the \nrecent Prime Minister\u2019s decision to restructure agriculture.4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nOn 15 October 2007, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the project loan of \nSDR58,723,000  ($90  million  equivalent,  excluding  the  government  contribution  of  $24.8 \nmillion).5   Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  provided  parallel  financing  with  a  \u20ac40  million \nloan  ($52  million  equivalent)  and  a  \u20ac1.0  million  grant  ($1.3  million  equivalent).  The  ADB  loan \nwas declared effective on 6 May 2008. The initial project was to (i) improve rural livelihoods by \nincreasing  agriculture  productivity;  (ii)  widen  employment  opportunities;  (iii)  improve  access  to \nhealth,  education,  and  safe  drinking  water;  and  (iv)  reduce  exposure  to  natural  disasters  by \nimproving deteriorated infrastructure.  \n \n4. \nThe  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD)  is  the  executing  agency. \nThe  central  project  management  unit  (CPMU)  established  within  the  Agriculture  Project \nManagement  Board  (APMB)  of  MARD  has  been  responsible  for  overall  national  project \nimplementation,  while  the  provincial  project  management  units  (PPMUs)  in  the  13  project \nprovinces have been responsible for day-to-day implementation. The project was implemented \nover 6 years and will close on 31 December 2014. At the time of the midterm review mission (11 \nMay\u20133  June  2011),  a  minor  modification  was  made  to  the  original  target  indicators  set  for \nimpacts and outcome in the  design and monitoring framework to extend the impact evaluation \nperiod  to  2016,  and  specify  the  baseline  to  measure  the  expected  increased  income.  The \noriginal  output  indicator  for  rural  roads  was  reduced  to  reflect  the  need  for  more  irrigation \nsubprojects to enable water supply, expand irrigated areas for crop diversification, and minimize \nflood and drought risks. \n                                                \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The provinces covered were (from north to south) Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua \n\nThien\u2013Hue, Quang Nam, QuangNgai, Kon Tum, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, Ninh Thuan, and Binh Thuan. \n\n3  ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nProject  performance. The project is considered to be performing well according to the \n5. \nadditional  financing  policy  in  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Manual.6 Despite  the  initial  start-up  delay,  the \nproject is on track to achieve its intended outputs and outcomes. As of 24 August 2014 overall \nproject  implementation  progress  was  99%  against  the  elapsed  loan  period  of  95%.  All  129 \nintended subprojects were physically completed. Cumulative contract awards comprised 95.1% \nof  the  ADB  net  loan  amount  and  disbursements  96.6%.  The  government  has  substantially \ncomplied with all covenanted safeguard requirements during implementation of subprojects. \n \nIn terms of achieving the revised output targets, the project rehabilitated 658 kilometers \n6. \nof  rural  roads  (122%);  and  irrigated  115,163  hectares  (105%)  of  agricultural  land  with  \n46  irrigation  canals  and  drainage  schemes,  six  rural  water  supply  schemes  (120%),  20  rural \nmarkets (111%), and nine flood protection schemes (225%). Appraisal estimates indicated more \nthan  400,000  hectares  of  irrigation  facilities  were  in  need  of  rehabilitation  and  about  25,000 \nkilometers of primary and secondary irrigation canals in need of lining. More than a third of the \nrural population did not have clean water supplies. The project has made a good contribution to \nmeeting the provincial infrastructure development targets. The monitoring data submitted by the \nCPMU and the PPMUs in December 2013 indicate the achievement of reduced travel and water \ncollection time, reduced vehicle operating costs, and increased rice and other crop production. \n \n7. \nAdditional support needed. Despite the achievements, much work is needed to reduce \ninfrastructure  constraints  to  production,  diversification,  and  economic  growth.  The  climate \nchange modeling study conducted by the World Bank indicates that the agro-ecological zones in \nthe  six  target  provinces will  encounter  severe to  very  severe  exposure  to hydroclimatic risks. 7 \nFarmers  in  those  areas  are  already  adapting  to  changes  in  climate  conditions  and  relying  on \nvarious  cropping  strategies.  The  study  recommends  investment  in  improving  and  expanding \nirrigation  infrastructure  where  opportunities  for  irrigation  expansion  are  greatest  in  the  central \nregion. Because dams and reservoirs are the backbone of irrigation systems, their safety is an \nurgent national concern. The government\u2019s National Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2011\u2013\n2016,  National  Target  Program  for  New  Rural  Development  (2010\u20132020),  and  the  National \nWater  Resources  Strategy  (2006\u20132020)  recognize \nthe  dual  objective  of  rural  water \ninfrastructure. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\n8. \nThe  additional  financing  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u2013\n2015  for  Viet  Nam.  The  impact  will  not  be  changed:  improved  livelihoods,  incomes,  and \nstandards  of  living  for  the  region\u2019s  rural  population  through  increased  agricultural  productivity, \nwider  employment  opportunities,  improved  health  and  education,  and  reduced  exposure  to \n                                                \n6  ADB.  2011.  Additional  Financing.  Operations  Manual.  OM  H5/BP.  Manila.  The  project  meets  the  four  eligibility \ncriteria  for  additional  financing.  First,  the  ADB  review  mission  in  2012  and  2013  confirmed  the  satisfactory \nperformance  of  the  original  project.  The  review  mission  in  December  2013  confirmed  that  the  original  project \nremains  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and  financially  sound.  Second,  the  government  accords  high \npriority to the original project as proposed to be expanded through the additional financing. Additional financing will \nbe crucial in meeting the national priorities stated in  National Target Program for New Rural Development, 2010\u2013\n2020, the National Water Resources Strategy, 2006\u20132020, and the recent Prime Minister\u2019s decision to restructure \nagriculture. Third, the additional financing scope is consistent with the project\u2019s development objective because the \nintended outcome and three outputs remain essentially the same except  for output 2 relating to capacity building \nwhich was slightly modified to include agricultural training for farmers. Fourth, the additional financing supports the \ninclusive growth that is identified as a priority in the Country Partnership Strategy: Viet Nam, 2012\u20132015. Manila. \nThe additional financing meets the three criteria for priority consideration: (i) the project is performing well; (ii) there \nis  a  high  degree  of  project  readiness  to  implement  the  additional  financing;  and  (iii)  the  additional  financing  has \ninnovative features that further reduce procurement risks, increase implementation efficiency, and increase project \nbenefits. \n\n7  World Bank. 2010.

The outcome statement remains the same, while the outcome indicators are \nmodified  to  adjust  to  the  current  socioeconomic  conditions,  consider  direct  contribution  of  the \nimproved PRI, and feasibility of data collection. 8 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n9. \nThe  three  outputs  are  unchanged.  The  output  statement  related  to capacity  building  is \nmodified to include agricultural training for farmers. Output indicators for the additional financing \nare  (i)  improved  PRI;  (ii)  improved  capacity  of  (a)  national,  provincial,  district,  and  commune \nstaff in technical design; and (b) farmers in agricultural production techniques; and (iii) improved \nproject management  skills  for  infrastructure development.  Rehabilitation of  water  supply  is  not \nincluded in the additional financing as the focus was modified from general rural  infrastructure \nsupport to improved irrigation system. \n \n10. \nActivities  to  improve  PRI  include  civil  works  to  (i)  improve  irrigation  infrastructure \nincluding  reservoirs  and  dams;  (ii)  upgrade  river  embankments  and  dikes  for  flood  protection, \nsaline  intrusion  protection,  and  other  purposes;  and  (iii)  rehabilitate  canal  roads  and  access \nroads around the irrigation schemes. Bioengineering techniques for soil and water stabilization \nwill  be  adopted  to  promote  soil  and  water  conservation.  Twenty-four  subprojects  were \nprescreened  and  a  feasibility  study  conducted  for  one  subproject.  A  feasibility  study  will  be \nconducted for  each of the remaining  23  subprojects to determine  their financial  eligibility.  One \nsubproject selection criterion is an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of at least 12%.9 \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe  additional  financing  will  support  work  estimated  to  cost  $92.5  million.  The  overall \n\n11. \nproject is estimated to cost $260.6 million, including taxes and duties of $20.3 million (Table 1). \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nCurrent Amounta  Additional Financinga  Revised Total \n\nItem \nA.

The funds from the \ncentral  government  will  finance  part  of  the  CPMU  operating  costs  and  training.  To  avoid  a \nsubstantial  implementation  delay,  the  feasibility  study,  detailed  design  and  construction \nsupervision  consultants,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  will  be  financed  by  the \ncounterpart fund from the provincial budget.

MARD continues as the executing agency and \ndelegates overall responsibility to its APMB. The CPMU established within APMB  will continue \nto be responsible for central project coordination. The provincial people\u2019s committees of the six \nparticipating provinces will continue their overall responsibility for implementation coordination in \ntheir respective provinces. The PPMUs set up within district agriculture and rural development \ndepartments in each of the six project provinces will continue their responsibilities. \n\n                                                \n10  ADB will finance taxes and duties for civil works and equipment to avoid delay, ensure completion of the civil works, \nand  realize  the  intended  outcome  and  outputs  within  the  proposed  4-year  implementation period.  The  total  cost of \ntaxes  and  duties  to  be  financed  by  ADB  is  estimated  at  $6.5  million.  The  calculation  of  taxes  and  duties  to  be \nfinanced by ADB under the project is based on the following principles: (i) the amount of taxes and duties financed \nby  the  ADB  loan  does  not  represent  an  excessive  share  of  the  project  investment  plan  and  is  in  line  with  the \neligible  expenditure  financing  parameters  set  out  in  the  CPS  2012\u20132015,  (ii)  the  taxes  and  duties  apply  only  to \nADB-financed expenditures and (iii) the financing of the taxes and duties is relevant to the project's success. The \ngovernment will finance taxes and duties for consulting services, subproject studies and design and safeguard and \ncommunity participation through cash contribution in the amount of $0.7 million. \n\n11 ADB will also finance bank charges, transportation, and insurance costs.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\nIn  the  communes,  the  project  will  continue  to  coordinate  with  the  local  administrations, \n15. \nusing  the  commune  people's  committees  as  points  of  liaison.  The  PPMUs  will  work  with \ncommune  personnel  who  will  ensure  coordination  of  day-to-day  activities  between  the  project \nand  commune  authorities.  These  activities  will  include  organizing  public  consultations,  and \ndesign  and  implementation  monitoring  by  commune  supervision  boards. 12  The  boards  are \nsupported by regular budget allocations from the districts. \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements for Additional Financing \n\nAspects \n\nArrangements \n\nImplementation period \n\nEstimated completion date \n\nJanuary 2015\u2013December 2018 \n31 December 2018 \n\nManagement \n\n(i)  Executing agency \n(ii)  Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iii)  Implementation units \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\nAdvanced contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development \nSix provincial people\u2019s committees and project management units of \nparticipating provinces (Binh Dinh, Binh Thuan, Ha Tinh,  Ninh Thuan, Phu Yen, \nand Thua Thien\u2013Hue) \nExisting central project management unit located in Ha Noi and existing \nprovincial project management units located in the participating provinces \nNational competitive bidding \n\n$61.50 million \n\nShopping \n\nSingle-source selection for \nexisting loan implementation \nconsultant \n\n31\u201340 contracts \n1 contract \n\n1 contract 28 person-months \nfor international and  \n174 person-months for \nnational consultants \n1 contract \n\n$0.04 million \n\n$1.60 million \n\n2 contracts \n\n$0.17 million \n\nLeast-cost selection for \nproject audit \nFixed-budget selection for \nbaseline and endline surveys \nand subproject completion \naudit \nNo advanced contracting required for Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing. \nSubproject design consultants will be recruited and contracted by the  provincial \nproject  management  units  using \nloan \neffectiveness. \nin  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nThe \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2012,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \n\nloan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed \n\ntheir  counterpart \n\n$0.60 million \n\nfunds  prior \n\nto \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development estimates. \n \n16. \nThe  contract  packaging  reflects  key  lessons  from  the  initial  project  on  how  to  improve \nprocurement  and  consultant  recruitment.  Based  on  a  review  of  75  bid  evaluation  reports \nprepared  by  the  PPMUs  of  six  participating  provinces,  several  measures  were  adopted  to \nimprove  the  quality  and  speed  of  civil  works  procurement.  First,  a  single-stage,  one-envelope \nbidding procedure will serve as the default to maximize transparency and price competition (as \nopposed  to  the  single-stage,  two-envelope  procedure,  which  was  the  default  under  the  initial \nproject).  Second,  any  requests  for  direct  contracting  during  implementation  will  be  strictly \nscrutinized  (almost  12%  of  civil  works  procurement  under  the  initial  project  used  direct \ncontracting).  Third,  to  address  the  elevated  risk  of  bidder  collusion,  civil  works  packages  are \nconsolidated  to  increase  minimum  lot  size to approximately  $1  million  thereby  enhancing their \ncommercial  attractiveness.  To  generate  bidder  interest,  business  outreach  events  will  be \norganized  in  Da  Nang,  Lam  Dong  and  Quang  Tri.  Fourth,  prior  review  of  procurement \ndocuments  prepared  by  Ha  Tinh  and  Thua  Thien\u2013Hue  PPMUs  will  be  undertaken  given  the \n                                                \n12 At least 30% of participants of commune supervision boards are women. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ndeficiencies identified in their bid evaluation process. Fifth, having identified certain weaknesses \nin  the  bid  evaluation  reports  of  the  PPMUs  from  six  participating  provinces,  a  customized \ntraining  program  will  be  developed  to  address  deficiencies  and  increase  awareness  of  the \nadditional explanations provided in the national competitive bidding section of the procurement \nplan. Detailed description of these measures and the underlying procurement risks they address \nare set forth in the project administration manual (PAM).13  \n \n17. \nUnder  the  initial  project,  one  package  for  recruiting  a  loan  implementation  consultant \nused  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  and  prior  review;  the  recruitment  process  had \nsevere  delays.  The  remaining  283  consulting  packages  were  recruited  using  consultant's \nqualifications  selection  and  post  review.  To  streamline  and  expedite  consultant  recruitment,  a \nnew  approach  will  be  adopted.  Consultant  recruitment  to  be  conducted  by  the  PPMUs  for \nfeasibility  studies,  detailed  design,  and construction  supervision  will  be  funded  by  government \ncounterpart funds following  national  procedures. Given  the  large number of  packages and  the \nPPMUs' limited knowledge of ADB procedures and the English language, the use of counterpart \nfunding  will  help  minimize  recruitment  delays.  Only  four  sets  of  consultants  will  be  recruited. \nSelection  methods  that  are  more  competitive  than  consultant\u2019s  qualifications  selection  will  be \nused, except as described in para. 18. \n \n18. \nSingle-source  selection  of  the  loan  implementation  consultant  under  the  initial  project, \nVICA  Consultants  International,  is  justified  for  several  reasons.  First,  VICA's  technical \ncapabilities  are  well  aligned  with  the  requirements  of  the  terms  of  reference  and  it  has \nexperience of exceptional value for this assignment. Also, VICA's actual performance under the \ninitial project was satisfactory. Second, VICA's financial proposal under the new contract will be \nreasonable  because  23  of  28  person-months  of  international  expert  input  and  132  of  174 \nperson-months  of national  expert  input  will  be  provided by  experts  recruited  under  the  original \nVICA  contract  based  on  remuneration  rates  determined  competitively  during  the  QCBS \nselection process. Third, given the specialized nature of the terms of reference, competition will \nbe limited; conducting a new selection process is unlikely to produce a firm with more technical \nexpertise or significantly lower price. Fourth, VICA's recruitment through single-source selection \nwill  significantly  accelerate  implementation  by  allowing  it  to  immediately  commence  key \nactivities involving review and/or preparation of technical design and safeguard documents, and \nsubproject  investment  reports.  Fifth,  recruitment  of  VICA  will  ensure  continuity  and  eliminate \nlearning costs that will be incurred if a new consultant is recruited. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n19. \nThe audit reports for the completed subprojects indicate no major technical issues. Most \nrepresentatives of the end-users interviewed by the last review mission were satisfied with the \ncompleted  works  that  were  handed  over  to  them.  Technical  capacity  of  the  PPMU  staff  was \nstrengthened through the training provided. Subprojects to be undertaken  under the additional \nfinancing  will  be  similar  to  those  under  the  initial  project  and  are  straightforward  rural \ninfrastructure  investments  (such  as  rehabilitating  and/or  upgrading  medium-scale  irrigation \ninfrastructure)  at  a  scale  within  the  technical  implementation  capacity  of  provincial  agencies. \nThe  existing  loan  implementation  consultants  will  confirm  the  quality  of  design  for  each \nsubproject identification report (SIR), while increased ceilings for a subproject introduced as part \n\n                                                \n13 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\nof  the  subproject  selection  criteria  are  likely  to  minimize  the  frequent  design  changes \nexperienced under the original project.14 \n \n20. \nTo  support  increased  productivity  and  diversification,  each  subproject  can  include  an \nagricultural  training  proposal  as  part  of  the  SIR,  and  the  requested  training  budget  will  be \nevaluated based on the following criteria: (i) potential increase in overall annual production and \nsales, (ii) likely increase in yields, and (iii) likely crop diversification. The PPMUs will assign the \nprovincial agriculture extension centers the responsibility to deliver the training-related activities. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nDirect benefits from improved PRI improvements are more agricultural productivity along \nwith  reductions  in  travel  costs  and  times;  indirect  benefits  include  diversification  of  market-\noriented  agriculture  output,  value-added  production,  and  reduced  risk  of  floods  and  drought \nresulting  in  avoided  agricultural  production  loss.  Indirect  benefits  are  becoming  increasingly \nimportant.  Completed  subproject  areas  seem  to  indicate  that  farm  households  with  small \nlandholdings  can  no  longer  advance  their  living  standards  by  making  incremental  productivity \ngains in rice; such households are increasingly reliant on nonrice crops with improved irrigation \nsystems.  As  part  of the preparation for the  additional financing,  one  SIR was prepared for  the \nupgrading of the Saloun reservoir and irrigation system subproject in Binh Thuan Province as a \nsample subproject. The estimated EIRR for this subproject is 15.3%. The subproject will enable \npoor  ethnic  minority  households  to  increase  their  income  and  improve  their  livelihood  by \ndiversifying  agriculture  production,  and  increase  their  access  to  public  services. 15  Similar \npositive effects are expected from the implementation of the candidate subprojects. \n \n22. \nProvincial government contributions during the additional financing period are expected \nto  be  in  the  range  of  0.4%\u20132.0%  per  annum  per  province. 16 Therefore,  the  contributions  are \naffordable. 17 All  six  provincial  governments  are  committed  to  funding  O&M  under  the  same \nterms as for the original project. The six participating provinces have provided sufficient O&M for \nthe  completed  subprojects  according  to  the  amount  specified  in  the  SIRs.  Therefore,  risk  of \ninadequate O&M funding under the additional financing is not likely. Implementation of O&M for \nthe completed subprojects will be monitored during the additional financing period. \n  \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nProcurement  and  recruitment  activities  under  the  original  project  were  vulnerable  to \nsignificant  risks  such  as  lack  of  competition,  collusion,  and  defective  bid  evaluation.  The \nproposed additional financing incorporates lessons from the completed subprojects to minimize \nsuch  risks  by  (i)  introducing  the  single-stage,  one-envelope  bidding  procedure  to  maximize \ntransparency;  (ii)  consolidating  civil  works  contracts  to  enhance  commercial  attractiveness  for \nbidders;  (iii)  requiring  prior  review  for  PPMUs  that  showed  relatively  weak  bid  evaluation \n\n                                                \n14 The subproject ceiling under the ongoing project was from $0.5 million to $5 million.  The subproject ceiling under \n\nthe additional financing is revised from greater than $2 million to less than $7 million. \n\n15 The Dong Gian commune is receiving support from national programs: (i)  Prime Ministerial Decision 54/2012/QD-\nTTg (4 December 2012) \u201cpromulgating the Policy on loans for development of production with respect to especially \ndifficult ethnic minority households for the period from 2012 to 2015\u201d, and (ii) Decision 551/QD-TTg of 4 April 2013 \n\u201cOn  approving  the  Program  135  on  supporting  the  infrastructure  investment  and  production  development  for \nspecially  difficult  communes,  border  communes,  safety  zone  communes  and  specially  difficult  villages.\u201d  The \nadditional financing will provide complementary training to ensure that the beneficiary farmers will be equipped with \nnecessary skills and knowledge for agriculture diversification. \n\n16 Provincial  government  contributions  to  the  project  will  mainly  comprise  project  investigation  and  design, \n\nconstruction supervision, and O&M after completion. \n\n17 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nprocesses  for  the  completed  subprojects;  and  (iv)  customizing  procurement  training  by  ADB\u2019s \nViet  Nam  Resident  Mission.  These  measures  are  deemed  adequate  to  address  procurement \nrisks. \n\n24. \nThe  original  project  was  implemented  without  any  major  financial  management  issues. \nFinancial  audits  conducted  in  2008,  2009,  2010,  2011  and  2012  did  not  identify  any  major \nissues  but  indicated  some  weak  financial  management  capacity  of  the  PPMUs  in  Binh  Dinh, \nBinh Thuan,  and Ninh Thuan provinces. The three PPMUs agreed to assign additional staff to \nensure  that  their  financial  management  units  comprise  at  least  one  chief  accountant,  one \naccountant,  and  one  cashier  to  strengthen their  internal  control  of  financial  management.  The \nCPMU  agreed  to  provide  financial  management  training  to  all  participating  PPMUs  prior  to \napproval of the additional financing by the ADB Board of Directors.  \n\n \n25. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MARD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 13). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nIn 2012, poverty in the participating provinces18 ranged from 6.1% to 15.7%, compared \n26. \nwith  an  overall  national  rate  of  9.6%  and  an  average  for  the  central  region  of  13.4%.  The \nadditional  financing  aims  to strike  a balance between  the  implementing capacity  of  a province \nand benefits for the poor in selecting the participating provinces. The preliminary data indicate \nthat the original project provided the beneficiaries, including women in the target communities, \nwith  improved  infrastructure  that  enabled  increased  productivity  and  diversification,  increased \nincomes and empowerment through off-farm income-earning opportunities, reduced the burden \nof domestic household work, and increased participation in project decision-making. The project \nalso improved access to education, health, and social services. These benefits are expected to \naccrue to the beneficiaries of the additional financing subprojects. \n \n27. \nImplementation  progress  reports  indicate  that  gender  targets  for  participation  in \nmeetings and trainings related to resettlement issues, technical O&M, and sanitation and water \nsavings were generally met. About 20%\u201340% of the commune supervision board members are \nwomen. Women\u2019s participation in O&M, however, was not feasible as the project did not finance \nthe  improvement  of  tertiary  canals.  The  implementation  experiences  also  indicate  the  need  to \nset appropriate numerical targets according to the availability of female staff in the PPMUs and \ntraining subjects. The gender classification for the additional financing scope is effective gender \nmainstreaming.  Based  on  the  lessons,  a  gender  action  plan  was  prepared  and  some  of  the \ngender action plan target indicators modified to ensure women\u2019s equal and feasible participation \nin decision-making and training opportunities.19 \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  and \nprocedures  developed  under  the  initial  project  have  been  followed  to  date  and  have  proved \nworkable. No major environmental impacts have been recorded since most of the works entail \nrehabilitating and upgrading existing infrastructure and are small to medium scale. Similar minor \nand  temporal  impacts  are  expected  for  the  additional  financing  scope.  A  draft  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE), prepared for the sample subproject (upgrading of the Saloun \nreservoir),  concludes  that  potential  environmental  impacts  are  minor  and  temporary,  and  the \n\n                                                \n18 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2)  \n19 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\nproposed  mitigation  measures  will  minimize  such  impacts.  If  ADB  assesses  the  quality  of  the \nfirst  IEE to be  satisfactory,  then  only  subsequent  subprojects  estimated  to  cost  $3.0 million  or \nmore  will  be  required  to  forward  an  IEE  to  ADB  for  prior  review.  ADB  will  conduct  a \npostevaluation of IEEs for projects estimated to cost less than $3.0 million. The environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  was  updated  for  the  additional  financing  to  describe  the \ndetailed  implementation  procedures  and  be  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguards  Policy  Statement \n(2009).20 \n\nResettlement  (category  B).  The  resettlement  framework  prepared  under  the  original \n29. \nproject was followed during project implementation. Forty-five of the 129 subprojects had minor \nland  acquisition  requirements.  Most  affected  households  only  lost  a  marginal  portion  of  their \nland and benefitted directly from the upgraded facilities. Independent monitoring was conducted \nfor  14  resettlement  activities  during  2011\u20132013,  and  confirmed  that  compensation  and \nallowances provided to affected households followed the approved framework and resettlement \nplans.  Additional  support  for  severely  affected  and  vulnerable  households  was  provided. \nRequirements  related  to  information  disclosure,  consultation,  and  grievance  redress  were \ngenerally followed. A postevaluation assessment of the resettlement assistance was conducted \nin  seven  provinces  to  assess  impacts  and  identify  lessons  from  implementation  of  the \nresettlement plans. Postevaluation in the remaining six provinces is ongoing. \n\n30. \nFor the additional financing, the PPMUs conducted initial screenings of the 24 proposed \ncandidate  subprojects  and  noted  that  8  subprojects  are  expected  to  involve  minor  permanent \nland  acquisition  impacts.  The  resettlement  framework  under  the  original  project  was  updated \nand renamed the resettlement and ethnic minority development framework to reflect provisions \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard Policy  Statement  and government  policies on  resettlement  and  ethnic \nminorities.  A  draft  resettlement  and ethnic  minority  development  plan  (REMDP)  was  prepared \nfor  the  sample  subproject  (upgrading  of  the  Saloun  reservoir).  REMDPs  will  be  prepared  and \nimplemented for any of the remaining subprojects with impacts on land acquisition, resettlement, \nand  ethnic  minorities.  A  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  for  subprojects  with  only  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.  The  provincial  people\u2019s  committees,  the  PPMUs,  and \ndistrict governments are committed to mobilize adequate staff and to follow the provisions in the \nupdated framework. \n\nIndigenous  Peoples  (category  B).  The  resettlement  framework  approved  under  the \n31. \noriginal  project  includes  an  ethnic  minority  specific  action.  Ethnic  minority  considerations  and \nmeasures  were  implemented  for  the  completed  subprojects.  Initial  screening  of  the  candidate \nsubprojects shows that ethnic minority concerns may be relevant for four subprojects, including \nthe  pilot  subproject.  No  change  will  be  made  to  the  ethnic  minorities  farming  and  livelihood \nsystem  or  their  cultural  practices  and  ancestral  domains.  The  draft  REMDP  prepared  for  the \npilot  subproject  attempts  to  provide  additional  measures  to  address  the  specific  needs  of  the \naffected  ethnic  minority  households  and  other  farm  households  belonging  to  ethnic  minority \ngroups  in  the  subproject  area. 21  Impacts  on  ethnic  minorities  in  the  subproject  areas  are \nexpected  to  be  overwhelmingly  positive,  as  the  subprojects  will  be  aimed  at  overall  economic \nand  social  improvement  of  the  total  population.  The  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment  framework  will  ensure  adequate  measures  to  address  the  specific  needs  of \naffected  ethnic  minority  households  and  other  farm  households  belonging  to  ethnic  minority \ngroups in the subproject area.22 \n\n                                                \n20 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Combined Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Combined  Resettlement  and  Indigenous  Peoples  Planning  Framework  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures summarized in Table 4 are described in detail in the \nrisk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 23 With  the  proposed  mitigation  measures,  the \noverall risk rating is low. The integrated benefits and positive impacts are expected to outweigh \nany negative impacts resulting from the identified risks. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nlead \n\nRisks \nSustainability.  Inappropriate  designs, \npoor  quality  construction,  and  deficient \noperation  and  maintenance \n(O&M) \npractices \nto  premature  asset \ndeterioration and reduced benefits. \nClimate.  Catastrophic  climatic  events \ninterrupt \nimplementation  or  damage \ninfrastructure. \nProvincial \ncapacity. \nTechnical \nimplementation  capacity  to  meet  all \nAsian  Development  Bank  and  project \nrequirements is limited. \nGovernance. Limited procurement and \nfinancial capacity may limit efficiency of \nimplementation  and  allow  corrupt \npractices to develop. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe  existing  loan  implementation  consultant  will  continue  to  provide \nguidance  on  the  design,  especially  for  dams  and  reservoirs,  and \noversight  during  construction.  Close  monitoring  will  ensure  O&M \nimplementation  for  the  completed  and  proposed  subprojects.  Post \nconstruction audit will ensure quality and sustainability.  \nCareful  attention  will  be  paid  to  the  planning  and  sequencing  of \nimplementation activities to match seasonal conditions. Robust design \nwith bioengineering measures will be used to stabilize local conditions. \nExpanded  terms  of  reference  for  the  existing  loan  implementation \nconsultant will provide increased technical inputs to design civil works \nthat  meet  ADB\u2019s  requirements  and  are  climate-proof  and  resistant  to \ndamage by natural disasters. \nRisk  mitigation  measures  include  single-stage,  one-envelope  bidding \nprocedures, consolidation of civil work packages, prior review for weak \nPPMUs,  customized  procurement  training,  increased  staff  during  the \nbid  preparation  and  evaluation  period  and  additional  staff  to  be \nassigned  to  the  PPMUs  in  Binh  Dinh,  Binh  Thuan,  and  Ninh  Thuan \nprovinces to increase internal financial control. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe  government  and  MARD  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  additional \n33. \nfinancing for the project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n34. \nadditional financing, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n\nThe  government  and  MARD  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \n\nV.
