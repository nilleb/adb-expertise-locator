The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Major Bridges Study, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, will approve the TA.1\n \n \nThe  project  will  improve  PNG\u2019s  two-lane  national  road  network  by  replacing  narrow \n2. \ntemporary  modular  steel  (or  Bailey)  and  other  deteriorated  bridges  with  permanent  two-lane \nstructures. The reusable Bailey bridges will be reassembled on rural roads to improve access. \nThe project is the first phase of the proposed bridge replacement program and covers five of the \n16  priority  national  roads.  It  is  envisaged  that  the  project  scope  will  be  expanded  in  future  to \nfinance  subsequent  phases  of  the  bridge  replacement  program.  The  project  will  develop  the \ncapacity  of  the  Department  of  Works  (DOW)  bridge  asset  management  system  (BAMS)  and \nimprove  road  safety  awareness  in  rural  areas  of  PNG  where  the  accident  rate  is  high.  The \nproject  preparatory  work  was  undertaken  through  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financed \nTA.2\n \n\n     \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  6.6  million  population  of  PNG  spread  over  a  land  area  of  about  462,000  square \n3. \nkilometers (km2\n) is connected by a network of 8,500 km of national roads and over 20,000 km of \nprovincial  and  district  roads.  The  bulk  of  the  population  (87%)  lives  in  rural  areas.  The  road \nnetwork on the mainland is not fully integrated because of rugged mountains, major rivers, and \nrainforests\u2014requiring  air  and  marine  transport  to  access  unconnected  areas.  Similarly,  the \nislands  are  connected  by  air  and  shipping  lines.  However,  most  of  the  population  depends  on \nroad transport for its economic activities and basic social services.   \n \n4. \nOwing  to  the  rugged  terrain  and  geographic  and  climatic  conditions,  PNG  has  a \nrelatively large number of bridges for the size of its road network. It is estimated that there are \nover  700  bridges  on  the  national  road  network. 3  A  large  proportion  of  these  are  single-lane \nBailey  bridges4  that  were  used  because  of  their  low  cost  and  faster  deployment  during  early \nstages  of  development  of  the  national  road  network.  However,  limited  load  carrying  capacity, \nincreasing traffic volume, and deterioration over time have made the Bailey bridges a safety risk \nand weak link in the two-lane national road system. Although the government, with the support \nof  development  partners,  is  actively  improving  and  upgrading  the  roads,  there  has  not  been \nmuch investment for improvement of bridges. In view of the large number of bridges involved, a \nlong-term  program  is  needed  to  replace  the  Bailey  and  other  deteriorated  bridges  gradually\u2014\nstarting with the 16 priority national roads.5\n  \n \n5. \nThe  project  offers  a comprehensive  bridge replacement  program.  A  sector  approach  is \nadopted  to  strengthen  the  support  for  the  government\u2019s  policies  for  development  of  the  road \n\n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for Preparing the Bridge Replacement for Improved Rural \n\nAccess Project. Manila (TA 7594-PNG).  \n\n3 From DOW\u2019s BAMS database. The estimate does not include culverts and other minor structures. \n4 Bailey bridges were originally developed for providing temporary crossing in case of emergencies such as natural \n\n5 See  the  National  Transport Development  Plan, 2006\u20132010.  The  16  roads  provide  the main  arterial system  of  the \n\ndisasters and military use.   \n\ncountry.    \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n   \n\nsubsector  and  to  provide  flexibility  in  implementation.  Detailed  selection  criteria  have  been \ndeveloped to assign priority to bridges that are to be replaced. Based on available financing and \nease  of contract  packaging,  bridges  will  be  selected from the  prioritized  list.  The  project  is  the \nfirst phase of implementation of the program and includes five priority national roads identified \nby the DOW.6 It is envisaged that the scope of the project will be scaled up in future to include \nall  16 priority  roads  and  other  key  roads  by  financing  subsequent  phases  through  ADB\u2019s \nAdditional Financing Policy.7\n \nThe  Bailey  bridges  that  are  removed  from  the  national  roads  and  are  in  useable \n6. \ncondition will be reassembled on selected rural roads that lack bridges for crossing streams and \nrivers. This will improve accessibility of the rural population to markets, livelihood opportunities, \neducation, and health facilities. The improved connectivity of rural roads with the national roads \nwill  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  the  overall  road  network,  bringing  higher  economic  returns \nfrom increased traffic.  \n \n7. \nRoad  safety  is  a  major  issue  in  PNG.  The  fatality  rate  of  45  road  deaths  per \n10,000 vehicles  in  PNG  is  one  of  the  highest  in the Western  Pacific  region.  About  37%  of  the \ndeaths  are  pedestrians.  Rural  areas  have  a  much  higher  number  of  crashes,  fatalities,  and \nserious  injuries. The  National  Road  Safety  Council  (NRSC)  was  established  in  2007  to  advise \nand  coordinate  road  safety  activities.  Despite  limited  resources,  the  NRSC  has  been  actively \npursuing road safety initiatives, particularly awareness campaigns, in and around the capital city \nof Port Moresby, which has the largest urban population. Similar initiatives are needed in rural \nareas, where 87% of the population resides and the accident rate is high.8\n \n \n8. \nThe  DOW\u2019s  road  asset  management  system  was  established  in  2003  and  BAMS  was \nestablished  in  2005,  for  systematic  management  of  the  road  network.  The  DOW  relies  on \nprovincial  staff to collect  and  update  the  database  regularly.  However,  because  of shortage of \nstaff and financial resources, data collection has been irregular and fragmented. Over time, the \ndatabase  has  become  outdated  and  is  of  little  use  for  planning  and  operations.  To  make \neffective use of BAMS, there is a need to improve the database.               \n \n9. \nPNG\u2019s  Strategic  Vision  2050;  the  Development  Strategic  Plan  (DSP),  2010\u20132030;  and \nthe  Medium  Term  Development  Plan  (MTDP),  2011\u20132015  emphasize  lack  of  transport \ninfrastructure  as  a  constraint  for  PNG\u2019s  economic  and  social  development.  The  trade  and \neconomic  development  targets  in  the  DSP  and  MTDP  require  considerable  growth  in  the \ncoverage  and  quality  of  the  national  road  network.  The  10  economic  corridors  for  integrated \ndevelopment  in  the  DSP  coincide  with  the  16  priority  national  roads.  Improvements  on  these \nroads will have a direct impact on economic development. Effective service delivery and income \nopportunities  for  the  rural  population  are  key  priorities.  Improved  accessibility  of  rural  road \nnetworks will open up markets, increase agricultural profitability, facilitate market chain linkage \nwith downstream processing and export markets, and increase access to education and health \nfacilities.    \n \n10. \nDevelopment Plan, 2006\u201320109\n\nThe  bridge  replacement  program  is  included  in  the  current  National  Transport \n but could not be implemented because of resource constraints. \n\n                                                \n6 DOW has selected five priority corridors: Magi highway, Hiritano highway, Ramu highway, Sepik highway, and New \n\nBritain highway. \n\n7 ADB. 2010. Additional Financing: Enhancing Development Effectiveness. Manila.  \n8 NRSC. 2011. 2007 Road Safety Data Report. Port Moresby.  \n9 The National Transport Development Plan will remain effective until the government approves the new NTS. \n\n\f  \n\n3 \n\nA long-term National Transport Strategy (NTS), 2011\u2013203010 is under preparation to support the \nDSP  and  will  become  effective  on  completion.  The  NTS  supports  the  bridge  replacement \nprogram  by  emphasizing  the  desirable  and/or minimum  level  of  service  for  the  national  roads, \nwhere narrow Bailey bridges are considered below standard and a safety and security risk. The \ngovernment is keen to proceed with the replacement of temporary Bailey and other deteriorated \nbridges  on  the  national  roads  with  permanent  structures.  This  is  reflected  in  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy, 2011\u20132015,11 and the country operations business plan, 2011\u20132012.12\n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe  impact  will  be  improved  access  to  markets  and  social  services  for  the  rural \npopulation  in  selected  provinces  of  PNG.  The  outcome  will  be  a  better  connected,  more \nefficient, and safer road network in rural areas of selected provinces.  \n \nC. \n \n12. \n \n\nThe project will have four key outputs:  \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n   \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\nBridge  replacement.  The  project  will  replace  20\u201330  Bailey  bridges  on  five \npriority national roads (footnote 6) with permanent two-lane bridges. The bridges \nare  prioritized  for  each  road  following  detailed  selection  criteria  based  on \n(a) traffic,  (b)  condition,  (c)  residual  life,  (d)  availability  of  alternative  routes, \n(e) safety of road users, (f) population served, and (g) additional works involving \nmajor  realignment  and  river  training.  The  bridges  will  be  selected  considering \npriority  ranking,  availability  of  funds,  safeguards  and  economic  due  diligence \nrequirements, and contract packaging.      \nImproving  rural  access.  For  the  Bailey  bridges  that  have  been  removed  from \nthe five priority national roads and are in usable condition, the project will finance \ntheir reassembly on rural roads that lack bridges. The provincial governments will \nidentify priority rural roads, following selection guidelines, preferably in the vicinity \nof  the  location  from  where  the  bridges  were  removed.  The  dismantling, \ntransportation,  and  reassembly  of  Bailey  bridges  will  be  part  of  the  main  civil \nworks contract for construction of permanent bridges.       \n\n(iii)   Capacity  development  of \n\nthe  Department  of  Work\u2019s  bridge  asset \nmanagement  system. The project will support BAMS to engage and train staff, \nundertake inventory and condition surveys on the 16 priority national roads, and \nupdate  the  database  on  bridges.  The  work  will  be  carried  out  in  close \ncoordination with the provincial units of the DOW.  \n\n(iv)   Road  safety  awareness  in  rural  areas.  The  project  will  finance  road  safety \ncampaigns in rural areas along the five priority national roads. The activities will \ninclude training for schoolchildren and communities in rural areas, complemented \nby media campaigns. The DOW will engage the NRSC under a contract to carry \nout road safety awareness in rural areas.  \n\n \nD. \n \n13. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $100.0 million.

The \nexisting  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  within  the  DOW  that  is  responsible  for  all  ADB-\nfinanced  projects  will  implement  this  project.  The  PIU,  headed  by  the  project  director  for  ADB \nloans, will be strengthened with additional staff to manage day-to-day implementation activities. \nThe  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  engaging  all  consulting  services  and  civil  works  contracts.  A \nproject  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  oversee  implementation,  monitor  progress,  provide \nguidance  to  the  executing  agency,  and  approve  bridges  to  be  replaced  on  selected  priority \nnational  roads  as  well  as  sites  on  rural  roads  where  reusable  Bailey  bridges  will  be \nreassembled. The PSC will meet at least quarterly and will be chaired by the secretary, DOW. \nThe members of the PSC will comprise representatives from the National Roads Authority, the \nDepartment of Transport, the NRSC, the Department of National Planning and Monitoring, and \nthe  Department  of  Treasury.

The additional staffing will consist of a \nproject  engineer,  an  accountant,  and  a  community  development  officer \nto  oversee \nimplementation  of  the  gender  action  and  resettlement  plans.  ADB  financing  for  PIU \nstrengthening  is  an  integral  part  of  ADB\u2019s  support  for  capacity  development.  The  government \nhas  given  assurance  that  upon  completion  of  the  project,  the  additional  PIU  staff  will  be \nintegrated into the DOW. \n \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  with  completion  by  December  2016.

Detailed  hydrological  and  geotechnical  field \ninvestigations  are  needed  before  a  decision  can  be  taken  regarding  the  location  of  these \nbridges.  In  some  cases,  landslides  and  other  similar  phenomena  upstream  cause  major \nchanges  in  the  river  flow,  requiring  more  innovative  bridge  designs.  Grant-financed  policy  and \nadvisory TA is attached to the loans to undertake the studies and prepare recommendations for \nthe  location  and  design  of  major  bridges.  The  recommendations  will  enable  the  inclusion  of \nmajor  bridges  in  future  phases.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $900,000.  ADB  will  finance \n$800,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).  The \ngovernment  will  provide  $100,000  equivalent  to  finance  counterpart  staff,  office  facilities,  and \nother  expenditures.  The  DOW  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  TA  will  be  implemented \nfrom January to June 2013.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n20. \nThe project will benefit the largely rural population of about 400,000 in the provinces of \nCentral,  Madang,  East  Sepik,  and  West  and  East  New  Britain  along  the  five  priority  national \nroads. The economic analysis is based on analyzing cost and benefits streams with and without \nthe  project  over  25  years  and  discounted  at  12%.  The  economic  analysis  was  undertaken  for \n27 high-ranked  bridges  on  the  selected  five  priority  roads.  The  quantified  benefits  include \nsavings  of  vehicle  operating  costs  and  value  of  time  from  avoiding  traffic  slowdown  and \ncongestion  on  existing  bridges,  and  disruption  following  the  failure  of  the  existing  bridges.  In \naddition, the analysis considers benefits from reduced maintenance costs and improved safety \nof the new two-lane permanent structures. The economic internal rate of return for the project is \n15.5% and the economic net present value is $20.3 million. Sensitivity analysis involving a 20% \ndecrease  in  benefits  and  a  20%  increase  in  costs  shows  that  the  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  remains  close  to  12%.  The  use  of  old  Bailey  bridges  from  national  roads  to  improve \naccess  on  rural  roads  will  result  in  benefits  to  rural  communities  that  cannot  be  quantified. \nAmong others, these include increased access to economic activities and education and health \nfacilities.         \n \n21. \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects.14\n\nFinancial  due  diligence  of  the  project  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n The financial sustainability of the project was \n\n                                                \n14  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. The project is classified a nonrevenue project \n\nunder ADB guidelines. \n\n\f  \n\n7 \n\nassessed at national and project levels. An analysis of projected expenditure was undertaken to \nevaluate the impact of the project on planned transport sector funding, including an assessment \nof  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  absorb  the  investment  financing  and  determine  if  sufficient \nresource  planning  has  been  undertaken  to  sustain  project  activities.  While  the  government  is \ntaking  a  number  of  steps  to  ensure  the  long-term  sustainability  of  infrastructure  projects,  the \nloan  agreement  will  include  assurances  for  counterpart  and  recurrent  funding  to  be  provided. \nThis will ensure that the appropriate level of resources will be made available in the medium and \nlong term to sustain project activities. \n \n22. \nTo  ensure  the  long-term  sustainability  of  road  projects,  the  National  Roads  Authority \n(NRA) was established in 2003 to (i) raise funds for the maintenance of public roads; (ii) ensure \nthe efficient preparation of effective annual road maintenance programs; and (iii) ensure that all \nroad  maintenance  is  executed  in  a  transparent,  effective,  and  efficient  manner.  In  2009,  the \nNRA  had  revenue  of  K18.3  million,  primarily  raised  through  a  small  fuel  levy  on  diesel,  with \nabout K67 million in reserves. Over 2,000 km of the national roads were transferred to the NRA, \nincluding significant sections of the five priority national roads included in the project. The NRA \nis maintaining some of the nominated sections but needs additional resources. To increase the \nNRA\u2019s funding and ensure its long-term sustainability, work is ongoing to increase the fuel levy, \nand introduce additional license fee for heavy vehicles, and other road user charges.15\n  \n \nFor road networks at provincial and district levels, the government provides a transport \n23. \ninfrastructure  maintenance  grant  as  a  block  allocation  to  each  province.  The  government  is \ncommitted  to  increasing  the  grants  and  appropriated  K45  million  for  this  purpose  in  2010  to \nincrease provinces\u2019 fiscal capacity to meet their transport infrastructure maintenance expenses. \n \nB. \n \n24. \nThe DOW has implemented several projects funded by development partners, including \nprojects financed by ADB. A capacity assessment of the current PIU within the DOW concluded \nthat  project management  arrangements  are reasonably  robust,  though  some strengthening for \nthis project is recommended.  \n \nFinancial  control  procedures  for  the  PIU  follow  the  Department  of  Finance\u2019s  financial \n25. \nmanagement manual. No significant financial management issues have been raised in external \naudit reports, or in other reports used by the DOW and key stakeholders for monitoring existing \nPIU  projects.  The  financial  management  arrangements  in  place  at  the  PIU  will  continue  to  be \nfollowed for this project. The PSC will ensure coordination across all aspects of the project.  \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  DOW.

With  87%  of  the  population  living  in  rural  areas,  the  poverty \nincidence is higher in rural than urban areas. Given the reliance on subsistence farming in most \nrural areas, the nature of rural poverty relates more to a lack of access to basic social services \nsuch  as  education  and  health  facilities,  and  lack  of  income-earning  opportunities,  rather  than \n\n                                                \n15 ADB.  2010.

Access to basic social services is especially constrained in rural \nareas  because  of  poor  infrastructure  coverage,  including  road  connectivity  and  transport \nservices.  \n \nThe  project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  socioeconomic  development  in  the \n28. \nproject  areas  by  improving  the  access  of  the  rural  population  to  livelihood  opportunities  and \nbasic  social  services,  reducing  their  travel  time,  and  making  these  essential  trips  safer.  The \nimproved  accessibility  will  increase  the  economic  opportunities  of  poor  rural  households, \npromote school attendance among children, and improve health outcomes among women and \nchildren by facilitating access to health facilities.   \n \n29. \nThe  project  is  classified  \u201ceffective  gender  mainstreaming.\u201d  Bridge  designs  will  take \nwomen\u2019s  safety  concerns  in  road  travel  into  consideration,  and  relocation  of  usable  Bailey \nbridges will incorporate access to health facilities and schools into selection criteria. Women will \nbe  engaged  in  semi-skilled  labor  for  construction  and  bridge  maintenance  activities  to  provide \nincome-earning  opportunities.  The  road  safety  awareness  campaigns  will  address  personal \nsafety concerns of women and children in road travel. A gender action plan has been prepared \nand  the  PIU  will  monitor  its  implementation,  supported  by  the  implementation  support \nconsultant. They will collect and analyze sex-disaggregated data in monitoring project activities \nas well as the gender action plan.  \n  \nD. \n \n30. \nEnvironmental.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009).  An  environmental  assessment  review  framework  has  been  prepared \nthat presents the general anticipated environmental impacts of the project, selection criteria, and \nenvironmental  procedures  for  undertaking  both  replacement  and  reassembly  of  bridges.  An \ninitial  environmental  examination,  including  an  environmental  management  plan,  has  been \nprepared  for  the  five  selected  priority  roads.  The  DOW  has  formally  submitted  the  five  initial \nthe \nenvironmental  examinations  and  environmental  assessment  review \nDepartment  of  Environment  and  Conservation  for  information.  Approval  is  not  required  under \nPNG law.  \n \nThe  construction  phase  impacts  will  be  temporary  and  primarily  related  to  increased \n31. \nwater  turbidity  associated  with  pile-driving,  excavation,  and  river  training  works.  No  significant \noperational impacts are expected. Mitigating measures have been developed, focusing on good \ninternational  construction  practices.  With  appropriate  mitigation  measures,  environmental \nimpacts associated with the project are expected to be minor, site-specific, and temporary. The \nimplementation  support  consultant  team  will  include  an  environmental  specialist  who  will \nmonitor  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan.  The  environmental  specialist \nwill  also  provide  on-the-job  training  and  capacity  building  of  DOW  staff  in  the  areas  of \nenvironmental mitigation, environmental monitoring, and occupational health and safety.  \n \n32. \nClimate  change  is  expected  to  have  implications  on  the  hydrologic  and  hydraulic \nproperties  of  the  bridge  sites.  The  bridge  design  will  incorporate  climate  change  impacts, \nparticularly  changes  in  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  floods.  The  ongoing  TA  will  help  in \nestimating present and future climatic conditions for bridge designs and for climate-proofing of \nthe project.16\n \n\nframework \n\nto \n\n   \n\n                                                \n16 A study of the climate change impacts on bridge design and recommendations for climate proofing of the bridges \nunder the project is under way, financed through ADB. 2007.

The  project  has  been  classified  category  B  for  involuntary \n33. \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  It  is  not  expected  to  involve  physical  displacement  of \npeople. It will, however, require acquisition of land for replacement of some bridges, resulting in \nloss of crops and trees on that land, and relocation of roadside food markets at some locations. \nResettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  for  each  of  the  five  selected  priority  national  roads \nincluded  in  the  project,  based  on  the  assessment  of  impacts  and  consultations  with  affected \nlandowners.  The  resettlement  plans  include  measures  to  compensate  for  affected  land  and \nassets,  and  to  assist  affected  persons  to  restore  and  improve  their  livelihoods.  A  resettlement \nframework has been prepared, providing guidelines on screening, assessment, and preparation \nof resettlement plans, if needed, for replacement of bridges on national roads and reassembly of \nBailey bridges on rural roads that will be selected during implementation. Affected landowners \nand  local  stakeholders  have  been  consulted  and  provided  relevant  information  during \npreparation of the resettlement plans. The DOW has endorsed the resettlement framework and \nresettlement plans that have been disclosed locally and posted on the ADB website.     \n \n34. \nA  social  assessment  concluded  that  ethnic  groups  in  the  project  area  are  primary \nbeneficiaries  of  the  project  and  not  distinct  or  vulnerable  compared  to  PNG\u2019s  mainstream \npopulation,  which  is  mostly  made  up  of  Melanesians.  The  leaders  of  local  communities/clans \nfrom  potential  project  sites  have  expressed  support for  the  project. The  overall  project  design, \nparticularly  the  resettlement  framework  and  resettlement  plans,  ensure  that  they  receive \nculturally appropriate benefits and actively participate in the project activities.  \n \n35. \nThe  DOW  and  provincial  governments  will  assign  lands  officers  to  manage  land \nacquisition and resettlement activities. The implementation support consultant team will include \nan international resettlement specialist and a national resettlement specialist to assist the DOW \nand  provincial  governments  to  manage  social  safeguard  aspects.  The  consultant  team  will \nprovide  necessary  safeguard  training  to  relevant  government  staff  involved  in  land  acquisition \nand resettlement.  \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nE. \n \n36.
