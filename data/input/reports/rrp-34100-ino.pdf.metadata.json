IEE \nwill be undertaken for selected noncore subprojects. \n \n \nThe  Renewable  Energy  Development  Sector  Project  will  comprise \nvarious  core  and  noncore  subprojects  that  will  add  about  82 \nmegawatt  (MW)  power  generation  capacity  with  480  gigawatt-hour \n(GWh)  annual  energy  output.  All  the  energy  will  be  produced from \nrenewable  resources,  thus  avoiding  the  use  of  fossil  fuels.  The \nassociated  power  distribution  networks  will  be  correspondingly \nstrengthened. \n \nIndonesia  has  a  very  large  number  of  small  power  grids  where \naddition  of  new  power  generation  capacity  using  renewable  energy \nresources  provides  economic  and  environmental  benefits. \nImplementation of such subprojects will also help restore the power \ndemand  and  supply  balance,  and  improve  the  quality  of  power \nsupply to existing consumers, particularly in the rural regions.  \n \nThe  Project  will  expand  renewable  energy  use  and  thereby  limit \nemission of greenhouse gases. \n \nThe total project cost, including physical and price contingencies and \ninterest during construction, is estimated at $256 million, comprising \nforeign  costs  of  $170  million  (66%)  and  $86  million  equivalent  of \nlocal costs (34%).  \n \nSource \n\nForeign \n($ million) \n115.8 \n  54.2 \n\nLocal \n($ million) \n45.2 \n40.8 \n\nTotal \n($ million) \n161.0 \n95.0 \n\nTotal Cost \n(%) \n63 \n37 \n\nADB \nGovernment \nand PLN \n100 \nTotal \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PLN = State Electricity Enterprise \n \n\n256.0 \n\n170.0 \n\n86.0 \n\n\fLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementing Agency  PLN \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n \n\niii \n\nA  loan  of  $161  million  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The \nloan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  a  front-\nend  fee  of  1.00%,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in \nthe draft Loan and Project Implementation Agreements. \n \nThe  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  will  be  relent  to  the  State  Electricity \nEnterprise  (PLN)  on  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB.  PLN \nwill  bear  interest  rate  variation  and  foreign  exchange  risks  on  the \nloan. \n \nUntil 30 September 2008 \n \n31 March 2008 \n\n \nDirectorate  General  for  Electricity  and  Energy  Utilization  in  the \nMinistry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  of  the  Government  of \nIndonesia. \n \n\n \nPLN  has  decentralized  day-to-day  operations  and  project \nmanagement  to  strategic  business  units  (SBUs).  A  full-time sector \nproject  director  has  been  appointed  to  the  PLN  headquarters  to \ncoordinate  ADB-funded  project  implementation.  The  sector  project \ndirector  is  supported  by  staff  to  coordinate  specific  functions,  i.e., \nproject  implementation  and  schedule,  procurement,  design  and \nengineering,  environment,  land  acquisition,  and  compensation. \nSubproject managers will be appointed to the SBUs, and subproject \nteams will be established to oversee the implementation of individual \nsubprojects. PLN will assign enough qualified and experienced staff \nto the sector project director and subproject managers. Consultants \nengaged under the Project will assist PLN staff. \n \nAll procurement to be financed under the Project will be carried out \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement. The various \nprocurement  threshold  limits  are  the  following:  (i)  international \ncompetitive bidding for (a) supply contracts of $500,000 or more; (b) \ncivil work contracts for small hydropower plants of $1 million or more; \nand  (c)  turnkey  contracts  packages  of  $1  million  or  more;  (ii) \ninternational shopping for supply contracts of $100,000\u2013500,000; (iii) \nlocal competitive bidding for all civil works contracts, construction of \ntransmission lines, and equipment erection of $100,000 to $1 million; \nand  (iv)  direct  purchase  for  all  contracts  below  $100,000.  The  local \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  to  be  followed  will  be  subject  to \nADB\u2019s approval. \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\nimprove \n\nlocal  residents'  quality  of \n\nA sector project implementation consultant (PIC) will be engaged by \nPLN  to  help  supervise  the  subprojects  included  in  the  two  sector \nprojects  that  will  be  implemented  concurrently:  the  Project  and  the \npower  transmission  improvement  sector  project.  The  PIC  will \nprepare  subprojects;  and  undertake  procurement,  contract  award, \ndesign review, supervision, and monitoring of all subprojects for both \nprojects. The PIC will report to the sector project director and support \nsubproject managers in project implementation. \n \nThe  PIC  will  be  recruited  by  PLN  using  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  PIC  will  provide  an \nestimated  117  person-months  of  international  and  132  person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services.  \n \nThe  power  generation  using  renewable  energy  resources  will  meet \nsubprojects'  electricity  needs  without  burning  fossil  fuels.  Power \nsupply  will \nlife,  promote \ncommercial  and  industrial  development,  and  be  environmentally \nsustainable.  Electricity  is  used  not  only  by  the  high-  and  middle-\nincome consumers, but also by the poor to meet their basic needs. \nElectricity is also vital for economic activities that create employment \nand  reduce  poverty.  The  total  beneficiary  population  is  about  5.2 \nmillion,  of  whom  about  1.5  million  are  poor.  Around  76,000  new \ncustomers are expected to be connected to the power grid. \n \nProject  success  depends  on  (i)  the  Government's  approval  of \nrevaluation  of  PLN\u2019s  assets,  and  a  gradual  increase  of  electricity \ntariff  from  2003;  (ii)  PLN\u2019s  decentralization  and  empowerment  of \nSBUs;  and  (iii)  timely  preparation  of  required  documents  for \nsubproject \nproject \nimplementation.  The  Government  has  assured  ADB  that  PLN's \nassets will be revalued and the tariff increased on time, and PLN has \napproved the establishment of support functions for SBUs. The last \ncondition for success will be met through close monitoring and ADB \nreview  missions.  The  Project  is  in  the  infrastructure  sector  with \nrevenue  in  the  domestic  currency,  exposing  the  investment  to  the \nforeign  exchange  rate.  Ongoing  reforms  aim  at  macroeconomic \nstabilization. Over the long run, power sector restructuring will allow \nprice risk management through a competitive electricity market. Until \nthis  is  possible,  the  Government  will  gradually  raise  the  electricity \ntariff  to  an  appropriate  level  and  reintroduce  an  automatic  tariff \nadjustment mechanism to maintain financial viability. \n \n \n \nTechnical assistance (TA) will be provided to design, and implement \non  a  pilot  basis,  the  power  welfare  scheme  (PWS)  for  low-income \nrural households in the outer islands. \n \n\nprocurement, \n\napproval, \n\nefficient \n\nand \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \nTechnical Assistance: \n \nObjective and Scope  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nAmount  \n\n \nImplementation \nPeriod  \n\nAn ADB-administered TA grant of $800,000 will be provided from the \nDanish  Cooperation  Fund  for  Renewable  Energy  and  Energy \nEfficiency for design and pilot implementation of the PWS. \n \nThe TA for the PWS is expected to commence in September 2003. \nThe  TA  will  be  implemented  in  24  months,  including  4  months  for \ndesign study, and 20 months for pilot implementation. \n \nPLN \n \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nConsulting    Services  The  TA  grant  will  finance  international  and  domestic  consulting \nservices,  and  fund  pilot  implementation  of  the  PWS.

The report \nalso  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  power  welfare  scheme,  and  if  the \nBoard approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nwill approve the TA. \n \nAt  the  request  of  the  Government  of  Indonesia,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \n2. \napproved  a  project  preparation  TA  for  the  outer  island  electrification  project.1  The  project \nproposal was included in the Country Assistance Plan (2001-2003) and is now titled Renewable \nEnergy Development Sector Project. The sector project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES  \n\nA. \n\nPower Sector Overview    \n\n3. \nThe formulation of power sector development policies is the responsibility of the Ministry \nof Energy and Mineral Resources, which discharges its control and regulatory functions through \nthe  Directorate  General  for  Electricity  and  Energy  Utilization  (DGEEU).  The  State  Electricity \nEnterprise (PLN), the state-owned electricity company, is responsible for the development and \noperation  of  the  power  sector  and  serves  over  30  million  consumers.  The  Ministry  for  State-\nOwned  Enterprises  exercises  the  sole  shareholder's  powers  on  behalf  of  the  Government. \nPLN's total installed power generation capacity reached 21,000 megawatts (MW) in December \n2001.  PLN\u2019s  assets  include  24,800  circuit-kilometers  (cct-km)  of  transmission  lines;  substation \ncapacity  of  50,000  megavolt-ampere  (MVA);  and  medium-  and  low-voltage  lines  totaling \n287,500 cct-km. The Java-Bali power grid has 74% of the installed capacity, and the remainder \nis spread over 1,100 power grids.2 \n  \n4. \nElectricity is also generated by power plants with an aggregate capacity of about 12,000 \nMW.  Large  industries  and  businesses  own  and  operate  the  plants,  and  PLN  customers  own \nabout half of these captive power plants, allowing these electricity users to buy power from PLN \nor  generate  their  own.  Since  the  plants  are  unregulated,  sufficient  data  is  not  available  to \ndetermine the actual amount of electricity used, or the impact of tariffs on PLN\u2019s power demand. \nIndependent power producers (IPPs), which are under contract to sell all their power output to \nPLN, have the capacity to generate another 3,000 MW. \n \n5. \nPLN's  power  supply  extends  to  49,000  (84%)  of  58,000  villages,  and  53%  of  the \nestimated  52  million  households  are  PLN\u2019s  customers.  The  reliability  of  power  supply  has \ngenerally been better than in many other developing member countries (DMCs), and Java-Bali \nhas  not  experienced  a  system-wide  power  failure  in  the  past  5  years  despite  PLN\u2019s  financial \nproblems.  Industrial  and  commercial  customers  find  the  electricity  tariff  com petitive. Reduction \n\n                                                 \n1   TA  3481-INO: Outer Island Electrification Project, for $800,000, approved on 23 August 2000.  \n2   Some  of  the  power  grids  on  the  three  large  islands  (Sumatra,  Kalimantan,  and  Sulawesi)  have  100\u2013500  MW \ncapacity. All the other power grids are smaller, many with only 1\u201330 MW capacity supplying power generated by \ndiesel-based generators to a provincial city and surrounding rural areas. When a sea or mountain range separates \nsuch small power grids, interconnection and economies of scale are difficult to achieve.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2\n\n \n\nof  the  subsidy  on  liquid  fuels 3  will  increase  the  cost  of  self-generation  and  improve  the \ncompetitiveness of PLN's supply. \n \n6. \nDuring  1998-2002,  the  capacity  factor  increased  by  about  3%,  which  indicates  that  the \nexisting power stations are generating more energy. The load factor has remained in the 67.5\u2013\n69.5%  range,  indicating  that  the  growth  in  peak  power  demand  has  been  normal.  The  tariff \nstructure  for  large  consumers  includes  a  multiplier  to  reflect  a  higher  supply  during  evening \nhours.  PLN  has  also  introduced  measures  that  allow  it  to  negotiate  lower  tariffs  to  encourage \ndemand-side management. Although the average electricity tariff has risen significantly in recent \nyears, it still remains lower than alternate options, and  so energy sales have not been affected \nmuch.  \n \nB. \n\nPower Sector Development Plan \n\n7. \nUntil  1997,  DGEEU  and  PLN  regularly  prepared  power  sector  development  plans  to \nreflect  an  annual  energy  sales  growth  rate  of  about  12%,  and  resources  were  mobilized  to \nimplement  these  plans.  Although  the  plans  were  optimistic,  PLN  could  acquire  resources  to \nimplement  new  projects.  In  1997,  about  70%  surplus  generation  capacity  was  available  and \nseveral  new  power  generation  projects  were  under  implementation,  some  by  IPPs. The crisis \nhad two significant impacts: (i) the growth of energy sales slowed, reducing the urgency to add \nnew  power  generation  capacity;  and  (ii)  the  electricity  tariffs  could  only  be  gradually  raised  to \nreflect  increased  cost  of  electricity  supply,  so financial performance results of PLN were poor \nand  it  could  not  borrow  for  capital  investment.  These  factors  introduced  considerable \nuncertainties in the power sector planning process, and available resources barely allowed PLN \nto complete ongoing projects.  \n \n8. \nThe  situation  has  gradually  changed.  The  annual  energy  sales  growth  is  now  about \n10%,  and  although  the  economic  forecasts  still  lack  clarity,  PLN  has  prepared  power  demand \nprojections  corresponding  to  annual  economic  growth  of  3.5\u20136.0%  and  an  increase  in \nelectrification ratio4 from 53% to 75% by 2010. A summary of the power development plan, i.e., \nthe  forecast  of  demand  growth  and  capacity  additions  required  in  the  power  sector,  is  in \nAppendix  2.  The  electricity  tariff  was  gradually  raised  during  2000\u20132002, and the Government \nplans to keep raising it to a level of full cost recovery and a reasonable rate of return by 2005. \nThe  projected  higher  electricity  sales  revenue  will  allow  PLN  to  meet  the  operating  costs \n(including  power  purchase  from  IPPs)  and  borrow  funds  for  the  new  investment  required  to \nsatisfy  power  demand  growth.  A  delay  in  new  investment  will  reduce  the  reliability  of  PLN\u2019s \npower supply, and the Java-Bali power grid could have a power shortfall by 2005. To address \nsuch  concerns,  large  consumers  may  decide  to  implement  new  captive  power  plants,  which \nwould be a less efficient and environment-friendly outcome.  \n \nC. \n\nSmall-Scale Power Generation \n\n9. \nTo promote power generation from renewable energy and private sector participation, by \nmid-1997, PLN had signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) with about 26 companies that \nplanned to add 280 MW from 44 power plants classified as small-scale power generators (less \nthan 30 MW). Unlike the PPAs for the large conventional power plants, the Government did not \n                                                 \n3   The competitiveness of PLN\u2019s supply can be established because of the low barrier for installing captive power \nplants.  If  large  customers  assign  a  low  value  to  the  supply,  they  will  use  self-generation, reducing PLN\u2019s energy \nsales.  \n\n4   The  electrification  ratio  is  the  number  of  households  connected  to  PLN  supply  divided  by  the  total  number  of \n\nhouseholds. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\noffer any assurance for the sales revenue to the project developers and the tariff was not linked \nto the exchange rate. The economic crisis significantly changed the project cost structure, and \nthe  projects  became  financially  unviable,  making  project  implementation  impossible  within  the \ncosts  or  within  the  3-year  period  envisaged  in  the  PPAs  and  allowing  PLN  to  cancel  the \ncontracts.  The  lack  of  a  new  agreement  on  the  terms  of  power  purchase  has  stalled  private \nsector development of small power plants.  \n \n10. \nThe  policy  of  promoting  private  sector  investment  in  all  types  of  power  generation \nprojects is even more relevant now, but it has to be adjusted. The process of selecting project \ndevelopers and determining the terms of  power purchase has to be transparent and auditable. \nADB  has  provided  assistance  to  develop  a  new  framework  for  private  sector  participation  in \npower  generation  projects  outside  Java-Bali  for  medium-sized  projects.5  The  Government  has \nissued  a  ministerial  decree  to  regulate  the  implementation  of  small  power  projects  using \nrenewable energy sources (less than 1 MW), which obliges PLN to buy the excess power.  \n \n11. \nDGEEU  has  prepared  a  draft  Green  Energy  Plan:  A  Strategy  to  Achieve  Sustainable \nDevelopment.  It  will  help  maximize  the  use  of  renewable  energy  and  promote  energy-efficient \ntechnologies. The Government will propose a new energy utilization bill, which will cover energy \nresource  management,  renewable  energy  supply  and  utilization,  energy-efficient technologies, \nstandards,  environmental  protection,  pricing,  and  measures  to  stimulate  higher  investments \nthrough  the  private  and  public  sectors.  The  green  energy  plan  includes  consultation  with \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  dissemination  of  information  regarding  advantages \nof renewable energy and energy efficiency. \n \nD. \n\nPower Sector Policies    \n\n12. \nBased  on  the  Government\u2019s  Power  Sector  Restructuring  Policy  (August  1998),  ADB \napproved a policy-based program loan (the Program) and the assoc iated capacity-building loan \n(TA Loan).6 The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) also approved a loan of $400 \nmillion,  disbursed  in  two  equal  tranches,  and  linked  to  the  release  of  the  two  program  loan \ntranches. The first program loan tranche of $200 million was disbursed in March 1999 and the \nBoard's approval is being sought for the release of the second tranche following the enactment \nand promulgation of the Electricity Law 20 on 23 September 2002.7 \n \n13. \nThe Program seeks to increase power sector efficiency and make it financially viable by \nestablishing  a  competitive  electricity  market  in  Java-Bali. The  new  electricity  law provides the \nnecessary legal framework, and stipulates that competition should be introduced within 5 years, \nstarting  with  competition  for  power  generation.  The  law  also  requires  creating  an  independent \nregulatory body within 1 year, and unbundling power generation, transmission, distribution, and \nsupply.8  \n \n \n                                                 \n5   It is one part of TA 3807-INO: Regional Power Transmission and Competitive market Development, for $500,000, \napproved  on  18  December  2001,  and  financed  under  the  Japan  Special  Fund.  The  contract  for  the  consulting \nservices was awarded in September 2002, and the implementation period is 6 months. \n\n6   Loan 1673-INO: Power Sector Restructuring Program, for $380 million, and Loan 1674-INO: Capacity Building for \n\nEstablishment of a Competitive Electricity Market, for $20 million, both approved on 23 March 1999.  \n\n7   Indonesia:  Progress  Report  of  the  Power  Sector  Restructuring  Program  (Loan  1673-INO),  planned  for  Board \n\nconsideration on a no objection basis by 9 December 2002.  \n\n8   Two types of supply companies will operate: (i) electricity supply ventures for the low-voltage consumers, which will \nremain uncontested; and (ii) the electric supply agencies for the medium - and high-voltage consumers (accounting \nfor about 56% of the total energy sales in Java-Bali), which will be opened to competition. \n\n\f4\n\n \n\nE. \n\nImplementing Agency     \n\n1. \n\nPLN Reorganization and Community Development \n\nPLN  has  a  two-tier  management  with  a  five-member  board  of  commissioners  of \n14. \nnominated  government  officials,  and  a  five-member  full-time  board  of  directors  lead  by  the \npresident  director.  The  management  is  fully  responsible  for  formulating  and  implementing \ncorporate strategies and business plans for utility operations, investments, finance, and human \nresources. Independent auditors review and submit a report on the company\u2019s annual financial \nstatements.  PLN  will  retain  its  primary  license  for  power  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution until the enterprise is unbundled in accordance with the new electricity law. PLN has \n(i)  two  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  that  own  and  operate  the  power  plants  in  Java-Bali; (ii) one \npower  transmission  unit  in  Java-Bali;  (iii)  two  operation  units  in  Sumatra  responsible  for \ngeneration and transmission; (iv) 16 regional operation units9 in the outer islands and four power \ndistribution  units  in  Java;  and  (v)  several  support  services  for  engineering,  construction, \nproduction,  etc.  PLN  is  being  reorganized  in  anticipation  of  the  structural  changes.  A  World \nBank-funded  international  consulting  firm  is  assisting  PLN  in  financial  and  organizational \nrestructuring.  \n \n15. \nTo  facilitate  the  transition  to  an  unbundled  power  sector,  the  focus  now  is  on \ndecentralization and empowerment of operational units by making them strategic business units \n(SBUs).  The  corporate  office,  which  earlier  made  all  decisions  in  operational  and  investment-\nrelated  matters,  is  now  transforming  itself  as  a  \u201cholding  company\u201d  with  SBUs  as  \u201cvirtual\u201d \nsubsidiaries. During the past 2 years, many corporate staff have been relocated to SBUs. SBU \ngeneral  managers  now  exercise  full  responsibility  for  energy  sales,  including  the  expansion  of \nthe  distribution  network.  The  larger  generation  and  transmission  projects  are  implemented \nunder the direct control of the corporate office. However, in the next phase of decentralization, \nSBU  managers  will  share  responsibility  for  procurement  and  be  fully  responsible  for  the \nimplementation  of  all  the  projects  in  their  respective  regions.  SBUs  will  eventually  have  the \nflexibility  to  negotiate  agreements  for  power  purchase  at  the  local  level  based  on  projected \nenergy  sale  and  revenue.  With  the  strengthening  of  managerial  capacity,  SBUs  are  well \npositioned  to  coordinate  the  development  and  management  of  the  regional  power  sector  with \nthe  provincial  and  regency  governments.  When  local  governments  establish  their  financial \ncapacity to invest in regional development  and  are  prepared  to  adjust  the  regional  electricity \ntariffs  to  reflect  the  full  cost  of  the  power  supply  in  the  region,  SBUs  are  envisaged  to  be \nseparated from PLN as jointly owned subsidiaries. The new electricity law allows such vertically \nintegrated  power  companies  in  the  outer  islands  to  be  owned  by  the  private  sector.  Like  any \nnetwork  industry,  economies  of  scale  are  available  in  the  power  sector.  While  administrative \ndecentralization may transfer authority to nearly 400 regencies and cities, fragmentation of the \npower sector is not advisable.  \n  \n16. \nTo discharge its social responsibility, PLN has pursued a community development plan \nto  expand  rural  electrification  and  help  poor  households.  PLN  has  partnered  with  village \ncooperatives (KUDs) to serve the rural regions. By 2001, formal agreements with about 4,700 \nKUDs covered power supply in 44,000 villages and over 22 million household consumers. The \ncooperation  includes  different  functions  based  on  the  capacity  of  the  KUDs,  such  as  meter \nreading, bill collection, trouble-shooting and inspection of customer installations, and distribution \n\n                                                 \n9   The  regional  operation  units,  or  wilayahs,  in  the  outer  islands  have  relatively  lower  annual  energy  sales  (1.5 \nterawatt-hours  [TWh])  and  number  of  consumers  (870,000).  Being  small,  the  regional  operation  units  need  to \noperate as vertically integrated utilities.  \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nnetwork  housekeeping.  The  larger  KUDs  have  management  service  agreements  that  include \nthe  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  local  diesel  generator  sets.  PLN  provides  all  the \nrequired training support and expertise, and pays the KUDs for their operational activities. \n \nPLN  has  adopted  another  three  programs  to  directly  benefit  the  poor  and  small \n17. \nconsumers: (i) the rural business service, which has benefited 75,000 small entrepreneurs and \nhelped  create  29,000  jobs  for  villagers;  (ii)  the  rural  electrification  loan,  which  provides  low-\ninterest loans to poor households unable to pay the new connection charge (about Rp60 billion \nto  781,000  consumers);  and  (iii) the program to empower small businesses and cooperatives, \nwhich  extends  loans  for  working  capital,  and  grants  for  training,  quality  improvement,  and \nmarketing  to  small  businesses  and  cooperatives  (about  Rp207  billion\u2014Rp173  billion  as  loans \nand  Rp34  billion  as  pledges\u2014to  over  43,000  units).  With  its  improved  financial  results,  PLN \nallocated Rp13 billion to the scheme in 2002 and 2003.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPLN Financial Management \n\nPLN\u2019s  financial  strategy  is  based  on  strict  budget  control  over  SBUs  and  operational \n18. \nunits,  stringent  cash  flow  norms  to  maintain  a  reasonable  level  of  power  supply  within  the \nfinancial  constraints,  proposals  to  gradually  increase  tariff  levels  for  Government  approval, \ndetermination of the subsidy necessary to offset the partial cost recovery from small consumers, \nand efficient energy billing and bill collection.  \n \n19. \nA  detailed  analysis  of  PLN  financial  performance  is  in  Appendix  3.  The  main \ncomponents  of  operating  costs  are  power  purchase,  fuel  and  lubricants,  maintenance, \npersonnel, and depreciation. The trend for these and other important operational parameters is \nbetter  than  that  in  other  DMC  utilities,  particularly  the  low  energy  losses  (11.5\u201313.5%)  and \nreceivables (33-40 days). The debt service cost for foreign currency loans acquired before the \ncrisis  is  now  higher  and,  based  on  the  policy  of  the  early  1990s,  PLN  now  buys  more  power \nfrom  IPPs  instead  of  investing  in  new  power  generation  capacity.10  It  avoided  incurring  larger \ndebt to build about 3,000 MW of new capacity. \n \n20. \nPLN  has  pursued  an  efficiency  improvement  program  based  on  an  operational  and \ncapital  expenditure  audit  carried  out  by  international  experts  in  1999.  All  units  were  assigned \nloss  reduction  targets,  which  involved  several  actions  such  as  reduction of fuel consumption, \ninventory levels, maintenance costs, and the billing cycle. Steps were also taken for customer \nvoltage  improvement,  load  balancing,  and  efficient  procurement  of  spares  and  consumables. \nPLN estimates that the resultant savings in 2001 were Rp1 trillion. \n \n21. \nUnder  the  1985  electricity  law,  the  Government  sets  the  electricity  tariff  for  various \nconsumer categories to allow PLN to recover all its costs. While this had not been particularly \ndifficult until 1997, the Government has faced a challenge since then in raising tariffs to adjust \nfor  the  higher  costs.  Wider  support  and  greater  transparency  are  now  needed,  including \ndiscussions in the House of Representatives (DPR). A sharp increase in electricity tariff would \nbe  inflationary,  reduce  domestic  savings,  and  thus  slow  economic  recovery.  Despite  the \ndifficulties,  the  average  revenue  from  electricity  sales  has  increased  from  Rp211  per  kilowatt-\nhour (kWh) in 1999 (when ADB appraised the Program loan) to Rp437/kWh in June 2002. To \noffset a lower tariff for small households (decided by DPR), a subsidy of Rp6.7 trillion covering a \nperiod of 3 years was transferred to PLN in 2001.  \n \n\n                                                 \n10  The share of purchased energy has increased from 2% in 1997 to 15% in 2001.  \n\n\f6\n\n \n\nAnother  correction  remains  for  PLN  to  incorporate  in  its  balance  sheet.  The  net  asset \n22. \nvalue  does  not  reflect  the  fair  replacement  value.  The  Government  and  PLN  are  discussing  a \nproposal to revalue the assets to increase the net asset value from Rp54 trillion to about Rp173 \ntrillion  on  1  January  2002.  The  asset  revaluation  will  attract  a  one-time  tax,  which  may  be \nspread  over  5  years,  and  increase  annual  provisions  for  depreciation.  The  higher  charges  will \ncause PLN to incur a loss in 2002 and 2003, although the cash generation (sum of net income \nand depreciation) is not expected to change significantly. \n \nF. \n\nCarbon Dioxide Emission \n\n23. \nThe  Kyoto  Protocol  to  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change \nspecifies  targets  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emission  in  developed  countries  from  their  1990 \nlevels by an average of 5.2% in 2008\u20132012. Although the Kyoto Protocol is yet to be ratified, a \nmarket for emission credits is expected to be established, which would benefit DMCs where the \nmarginal cost of greenhouse gas abatement is lower. A private-to-private transaction of this type \nwas demonstrated in January 2002, when the World Economic Forum purchased 4,000 carbon \nemission credits from the Salak geothermal power plant in West Java. An expression of interest \nwas  also  submitted  to  an  agency  in  the  Netherlands,  offering  8.67  million  tons of cumulative \ncarbon emission credits from two geothermal power plants (300 MW) being implemented by an \nIPP. \n \nG. \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy in the Power Sector \n\n24. \nDMCs  should  make  more  energy  available  in  a  least-cost  and  environment-friendly \nmanner, and improve access to it for all, particularly the poor. Mobilizing the required resources \nwill require establishing greater transparency and a competitive environment to promote private \nsector  investment,  and  increasing  supply-  and  demand-side  efficiencies.  Energy  sector \ndevelopment  must  also  be  environmentally  sustainable.  Regional  and  global  environmental \nimpacts must thus be mitigated and greater use of renewable energy sources encouraged. To \nensure  that  its  future  operations  reflect  these  requirements,  ADB  prioritizes reducing poverty, \npromoting  private  sector  involvement,  addressing  regional  and  global  environmental  impacts, \nand  promoting  regional  cooperation.  ADB  interventions  take  into  account  the  varying  physical \nfeatures, resource endowments, and economic standards of DMCs.  \n \n25. \nThe 1999 Program loan to Indonesia will be fully disbursed in 2002. The next significant \nchange will take place at end-2007, when the competitive electricity market will be established \nin  Java-Bali.  ADB  is  envisaged  to  consider  another  policy-based  loan  to  support  market \ndevelopment.  \n \nH. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n26. \nBased on implementation experience of recent projects, particular attention will be given \nto  (i)  availability  of  counterpart  funds,  (ii)  security  concerns  that  delay project implementation, \n(iii) streamlined internal procedures for selection of contractors, and (iv) timely availability of the \nright-of-way for transmission lines.  \n \n27. \nAvailability  of  counterpart  funds  has  improved  significantly  with  the  increase  in  the \nelectricity  tariff,  which  will  eventually  be  high  enough  to  generate  sufficient  cash  for  operation \nand  capital  expenditure  without  budgetary  support,  if  the  present  trajectory  of  increase  is \nmaintained.  PLN  decentralization  will  allow  field  managers  to  closely  monitor  project \nimplementation  and  take  timely  corrective  steps  when  necessary.  Closer  working  ties  with \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nthe  1995  project,  which \n\nin  southern  Sumatra;  and  (ii) \n\nprovincial  and  regency  governments  will  help  address  security  concerns;  and  right-of-way \nissues  will  be  addressed  by  preparing  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  (LARPs) \nusing a participatory process.  \n \nPLN  is  the  Implementing  Agency  for  two  ongoing  projects11  that  are  classified  as  \"at \n28. \nrisk\":  (i)  the  1993  Power  XXIII  project,  which  includes  the  implementation  of  the  86  MW  Musi \nhydropower  project \nincludes \nimplementation  of  522  km  of  a  275  kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  in  Sumatra,  and  the  86  MW \nPeusangan  hydropower  project  in  Aceh  Province  in  Sumatra.  The  Musi  hydropower project's \nconstruction  was  suspended  in  December  1997  along  with  that  of  a  large  number  of \ninfrastructure projects to limit export credit borrowings. In August 2000, considering that most of \nthe  civil  works  had  been  completed,  ADB  approved  the  use  of  loan  savings  to  substitute  the \nexport  credit  to  build  the  power  plant,  albeit  considerably  delayed.  PLN  is  now  evaluating  the \nbids  for  the  equipment  packages,  and  contract  award  is  expected  by  end-2002. Transmission \nline  construction  in  Sumatra  was  considerably  delayed  because  of  difficulties  in  obtaining  the \nright of way. By August 2002, 87% of the length had been completed. In June 2002, the district \nadministration took the lead in finalizing amicable settlements with the affected people, which is \nhelping in the construction of the remaining section. Commissioning of all transmission lines is \nplanned  by  end-2002.  In  Peusangan,  however,  little  site  work  has  been  possible  because  of \nsecurity concerns in Aceh. The Government is unable to unilaterally suspend the project as that \nwould adversely influence the ongoing political efforts to find a basis for sharing all resources.12 \nThrough  collaborative  efforts  of  the  Government,  provincial  government,  and  the  military,  a \nsecurity  action  plan  was  prepared  in  June  2002,  and  is  considered  acceptable  by  prospective \ncivil  works  contractors.  PLN  will  seek  JBIC's  approval  to  rebid  the  civil  works  contract  and \nextend the loan closing date to 2008, and request an extension of the ADB loan. These steps \nprovide  an  opportunity  to  implement  the  Peusangan  hydropower  project,  which  will  help  avoid \npower  shortage  in  the  province  and  promote  balanced  regional  development,  which  were  the \nADB loan's objectives. The long delay in implementing the three project components will keep \nimplementation  progress  as  only  partly  satisfactory,  and  so  the  projects  will  technically  be \nconsidered  \"at  risk.\"  However,  when  completed,  the  projects  will  provide  the  urgently  needed \ninfrastructure to mitigate power shortage in different parts of Sumatra. \n \nI. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n29. \nExternal  assistance  (Appendix  4)  has  played  a  key  role  in  expanding  PLN\u2019s  power \nsupply system and diversifying its generation mix. Although the private sector will be playing an \nincreasing  role  in  expanding  power  generation,  PLN  will  continue  to  invest  significantly  in  the \ntransmission and distribution systems, and will continue to need assistance from multilateral and \nbilateral sources.  \n \nSince 1970, ADB has approved 28 energy sector projects in Indonesia with  a combined \n30. \nvalue of $3.13 billion for the power sector and a gas transmission project. ADB has also given \nIndonesia  37  TA  grants  totaling  over  $13.6  million  for  studies  on  hydropower  and  geothermal \nimpact \npower  development,  rural  and  renewable  energy  development,  environmental \n\n                                                 \n11 Loan 1271-INO: Power XXIII Project, for $275 million ($201.89 million net amount after cancellations), approved in \nNovember  1993;  and  Loan  1397-INO:  Power  Development  and  Efficiency  Enhancement  Project,  for  $337 million \n($176.61 million net amount after cancellations), approved in October 1995.  \n\n12  The  Aceh  government  supports  the  project,  and  the  additional  power  generation  capacity  is  needed  to  avoid \nsevere power shortages. JBIC is cofinancing the front-end civil works and consulting services, and its loan is also \nopen. \n\n\f8\n\n \n\nassessment, energy efficiency, human resource planning, coal sector policy, gas utilization, gas \nregulatory framework, electricity tariffs, and strategic planning. \n \n31. \nADB has coordinated its operations in the power sector with other agencies, particularly \nthe World Bank and JBIC, on efficiency improvement, cost recovery, private sector involvement, \nand  restructuring.  The  World  Bank  has  provided  29  energy  sector  loans  since  1969,  with  a \ncombined value of $5.01 billion. The World Bank fielded a pre-appraisal mission in September \n2002 for an energy sector project proposal to be considered for approval in early 2003, which \nincludes,  (i)  about  $90  million  for  critical  transmission  de-bottlenecking projects, (ii) about $25 \nmillion  for  information  system  to  support  PLN's  reorganization,  and  (iii)  about  $2  million  for \ninstitutional  strengthening.  JBIC  has  provided  127  overseas  development  assistance  (ODA) \nprojects  in  the  energy  sector  for  a  total  of  about  $4.6  billion  equivalent,  and  14  non-ODA \nprojects  for  a  total  of  about  $3.6  billion  equivalent.  Further  JBIC  assistance  to  resume  the \nimplementation of the IPP-owned Tanjung Jati B power plant (1,320 MW) is expected by end-\n2002.  \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope  \n\n32. \nThe  Project  will  expand  renewable  energy  use  by  about  82  MW,  which  will  displace \nenergy  generated  by  fossil  fuels  (about  480  GWh  annually)  and  thereby  limit  emission  of \ngreenhouse  gases.  The  Project  includes  (i)  subprojects  to  generate  power  using  renewable \nenergy  sources,  and  (ii)  consulting  services  to  help  implement  subprojects  included  in  the \nProject and the Power Transmission Improvement (PTI) Sector Project.13  \n \n33. \nAlthough  the  renewable  energy  subprojects  are  of  relatively  small  capacity  (each less \nthan  20  MW),  they  will  account  for  5\u201310%  of  power  generation  in  their  power  grids  in  remote \nregions. PLN will upgrade and expand the distribution network correspondingly to improve the \nquality  of  power  supply  and  connect  new  consumers.14  Considering  the  waiting  list  for  new \nconsumers, the renewable energy subprojects will allow new connections for cold storage and \nice factories, which will help improve the value of outputs from agriculture and fisheries, which \nare  the  mainstay  of  the  rural  economy.  The  adequate  supply  of  power  will  also  help \ncommunities  expand  piped  water  supply,  education,  primary  health,  communication  facilities, \nand  entertainment.  The  Project  will  help  avoid  the  negative  environmental  impacts  resulting \nfrom  fossil  fuel-based  power  generation.  PLN  will  continue  implementing  its  own  schemes  to \nassist rural consumers (para. 17). The TA for the proposed power welfare scheme (PWS) will \nalso bring power connections to poor households on a pilot scale, which will provide a suitable \nmodel of microfinancing to increase the social impact of electrification programs. The Project will \nhelp improve the financial viability and decentralization of the power sector in accordance with \nthe Government\u2019s energy sector policy. \n \nB. \n\nSubprojects \n\n34. \nRenewable  energy  core  subprojects  have  been  identified  on  the  basis  of  agreed-on \nselection  criteria.  The  implementation  of  the  core  subprojects  may  commence  after  loan \n                                                 \n13  The  two  sector  projects  will  be  implemented  concurrently.  Only  one  consultant  is  envisaged  to  be  engaged  to \n\nimprove the effectiveness of project implementation supervision.  \n\n14  In  remote  power  grids,  about  70%  of  household  consumers  have  small  connections  (450  volt-ampere  [VA]), \n\nadequate only for minimal house lighting and a radio and small television. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\napproval  and  effectiveness.  These  are  the  Merasap,  Lobong,  Monganago,  and  Ndungga  mini \nhydropower  plants.  PLN  has  confirmed  that  it  has  not  signed  PPAs  with  private  sector \ndevelopers under the small-scale power generation program for any of the core subprojects.  \n \nPLN  will  select  other  renewable  energy  subprojects:  the  noncore  subprojects that also \n35. \nsatisfy  the  agreed-on  selection  criteria.  It  has  identified  eight  such  noncore  subprojects.  The \nnoncore subprojects are being prepared and the list with the salient features is in Appendix 5, \nTable A5.2. In case the priority changes during project implementation, PLN may substitute or \nadd other subprojects that also meet the selection criteria. PLN will seek ADB\u2019s approval to use \nloan  proceeds  to  implement  the  noncore  subprojects  by  submitting  documents  satisfactory  to \nADB:15 an executive summary of the feasibility report, including cost estimate, contract package \nlist,  and  implementation  schedule;  economic  and  financial  analysis;  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) and summary IEE (SIEE);16 social assessment and poverty analysis; LARP; \nand  a  brief  note  establishing  that  the  selected  noncore  subprojects  satisfy  the  following \nselection criteria:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nPower generation will use a renewable primary energy source, and in the case of \nhydropower, the height of the dam will be less than 15 meters and the reservoir \nvolume limited to 3 million cubic meters. \nThe subproject will be part of the least-cost development plan for the power grid, \nand it is financially and economically viable. \nThe  provincial  government  has  confirmed \nimplementation. \nIn  case  another  funding  agency  or  lending  institution  provided  resources  to \nprepare the subproject, it should indicate that it has no objection to PLN seeking \nADB funds for implementation. \nIn  case  the  subproject  has  been  developed  by  a  private  entity,  the  PPA  has \nbecome  invalid,  or  the  project  developer  has  confirmed  its  willingness  to \nwithdraw, and PLN should confirm that the project cannot be competitively bid. \nA  completed  environmental  screening  checklist  should  be  submitted  in  cases \nwhere an IEE need not be submitted.17  \nSubproject  implementation  will  be  completed  within  the  project  implementation \nperiod.  \n\nfor  subproject \n\nits  support \n\n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nRenewable Energy Resources \n\n36. \nIndonesia  has  huge  renewable  energy-based  power  potential,  mainly  from  small  and \nmini hydropower, and geothermal sources. Implementation of the renewable energy subprojects \nwill help establish benchmarks for base and total project costs, which can then be adjusted for \nthe different cost of funds and compared to proposals submitted by private sector developers to \nimplement  similar  renewable  energy  projects.  The  procurement-related  information  gathered \nduring project implementation will be useful for establishing benchmarks for large private sector \ninvestment, thus clearing the present impasse. The Government and PLN assured ADB that a \nsuitable action plan will be prepared by December 2003 to promote private sector participation \n                                                 \n15  The documentation prepared for the core subproject before loan approval will serve as a sample for the non-core \n\nsubprojects. \n\n16 IEE and SIEE will be required only for small hydropower plants with installed capacity more than or equal to 5 MW. \n17  The  format  of  the  environmental  screening  checklist  was  provided  to  PLN.  The  checklist  includes  aspects \n\nconsidered when ADB does environmental classification of hydropower project proposals.  \n\n\f10\n\n \n\n \n\nin renewable energy development.18 Local communities will participate in subproject operation, \nwhich will have environmental and social benefits.  \n \n\n2. \n\nTariff and Subsidy \n\nThe Government approved a package of measures to restructure PLN\u2019s balance sheet19 \n37. \nbut the electricity tariff is still below the cost of service. In consultation with DPR, the tariff has \nbeen  increased  by  6%  at  the  start  of  every  quarter  in  2002.20  The  Government  agreed  to \nincrease  the  annual  average  tariff  in  2003  and  2004  to  reach  an  economical  level  of  tariff  in \n2005  so  that  PLN  will  recover  all  costs  and  generate  sufficient  cash  for  new  investments. To \nprevent erosion of PLN's revenue in real terms and to make the tariff more transparent, formula-\nbased  automatic  tariff  adjustments  will  be  made  every  quarter  starting  1  January  2006,  taking \ninto account changes in input costs from inflation, changes in fuel prices, and exchange rate.   \n \n38. \nThe  average  tariff  for  small  consumers  is  Rp261/kWh,  or  about  40%  lower  than  the \noverall  average  tariff.  PLN  plans  to  maintain  the  lifeline  tariff  targeted  to  the  small  household \nconsumers (450 volt-ampere  [VA]),  or  households  in  the  lowest  20-percentile income bracket. \nThe  tariff  for  these  households  is  expected  to  remain  30%  lower  than  the  average  electricity \ntariff for the household consumer category. \n \n\n3. \n\nChanging Strategic Business Units into Power Companies  \n\n39. \nIn the outer island provinces where renewable energy subprojects will be implemented, \nPLN will seek active participation of the provincial and local governments and share the project \ndesign, and information on implementation arrangements with them to obtain their assistance in \ntimely project implementation, and increase subproject impact on the community. \n \n40. \nThe  new  electricity  law  allows  provincial  governments  to  participate  in  managing  the \nprovincial power sector, as tariffs can be set regionally. PLN will provide inputs to the provincial \ngovernments  to  help  prepare  provincial  power  development  plans  and  raise  the  provincial \nelectricity  tariff  to  the  level  required  to  generate  resources  to  fund  development  plans.  In \nprovinces  that  make  progress,  PLN  will  create  jointly  owned  provincial  power  companies.  The \nelectricity law allows licenses to be issued to private power companies, and PLN will prepare a \nsuitable framework to encourage the private sector to invest in provincial power companies.  \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n41. \nThe  total  project  cost,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies  and  interest  during \nconstruction,  is  estimated  at  $256  million,  comprising  foreign  costs  of  $170  million  (66%)  and \n$86 million equivalent of local costs (34%). The project cost includes the estimated costs of core \nsubprojects and identified noncore subprojects (Table 1, 2002 prices).  \n\n                                                 \n18  The  envisaged  establishment  of  a  market  under  clean  development  mechanism  after  ratification  of  the  Kyoto \nProtocol will help channel additional funds for such renewable energy projects (para 23). The policy and procedural \nissues are being examined in another ADB-funded study (footnote 5).   \n\n19 The restructuring related to PLN's failure to service  the  high-cost  Government  loans;  the  unpaid  principal  amount \n(Rp5.3  trillion)  was  converted  into  a  new  20-year  loan  (including  a  2-year  grace  period)  with  4%  annual \nadministrative  charge;  and  the  unpaid  interest  (Rp15.7  trillion)  and  penalty  (Rp13.0  trillion)  were  converted  to \nequity. \n\n20  The  average  revenue  from  electricity  sales  will  increase  to  Rp497/kWh  ($0.051/kWh)  by  December  2002.  The \nlarge low-voltage consumers in all categories will be paying $0.08\u20130.09/kWh. Consumers also pay a streetlight tax \nequal to 3\u201310% of the energy bill, which is transferred to the regency. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n \nTable 1: Estimated Project Cost \n($ million) \n \n\nForeign Cost \n\nLocal Cost \n\nItem \nRenewable Energy \nConsulting Services \nBase Cost \nTaxa \nFront-End Fee \nPhysical Contingencyb \nPrice Contingencyc \nInterest During Constructiond  \n \n\nTotal \n\n132.1 \n2.0 \n134.1 \n0.0 \n1.6 \n13.4 \n6.7 \n14.2 \n170.0 \n\n53.1 \n0.5 \n53.6 \n18.7 \n0.0 \n5.3 \n2.7 \n5.7 \n86.0 \n\nTotal Cost \n185.2 \n2.5 \n187.7 \n18.7 \n1.6 \n18.7 \n9.4 \n19.9 \n256.0 \n\nNote: \na  Value-added tax computed as 10% of foreign and local costs. \nb  Physical contingency computed as 10% of base cost. \nc  Price contingency computed on the basis of 5% on base cost. \nd \n\nIncludes commitment charge. \n\nSource: PLN estimates. \n \n \n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nindependent  decision  and  not  made  under \n\n42. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $161  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate  \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  a  front-end fee of \n1.00% (the fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe  draft  Loan  and  Project  Implementation  Agreements.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the \nbasis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  the \nGovernment's  own \ninfluence  of  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The Borrower will be the Government. The proceeds of the \nADB loan will be relent to PLN in dollar and other terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. PLN \nwill bear interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks on the loan.  \n \n43. \nProceeds of the proposed ADB loan will be utilized for the (i) foreign and local currency \ncosts  for  generation  and  transmission  lines  for  power  evacuation  (other  than  land  and  access \nroads); (ii) foreign currency cost and 50% of local currency cost for the consulting services; (iii) \nup-front fee; and (iv) interest during construction and commitment charge for the ADB loan. For \ncontracts  for  civil  works,  the  disbursement  will  be  limited  to  90%  of  the  contract  value.  The \nGovernment and PLN will provide counterpart funds to meet (i) the foreign and local currency \ncosts of expanding and upgrading the distribution network in areas supplied by the renewable \nenergy  subprojects;  and  (ii)  50%  of  the  local  currency  cost  of  the  consulting  services.  The \nGovernment  and  PLN  will  finance  the  costs  for  land  acquisition,  access  roads,  buildings,  and \ntaxes for all subprojects. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n \n\nthe \n\n\f12\n\n \n \n\nSource \n\n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nLocal \n\nForeign \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment and PLN \nTotal \nPLN = State Electricity Enterprise \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates \n\n115.8 \n54.2 \n170.0 \n\n45.2 \n40.8 \n86.0 \n\nTotal \n\n161.0 \n95.0 \n256.0 \n\nTotal Cost \n(%) \n\n63 \n37 \n100.0 \n\n \n44. \nShould  assets  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  need  to  be  transferred  to  a  successor  power \ncompany, ADB's agreement will be sought and arrangements acceptable to ADB put in place to \nensure  that  the  project  implementation  and  operation  continue  satisfactorily,  including  the \nservicing of debt and compliance to other loan conditions. \n \n45. \n  The  Government  has  sought  assistance  to  meet  part  of  the  local  Project  cost.  The \nGovernment  needs  to  support  the  power  sector  during  2003-2004,  i.e.,  till  the  tariff  remains \nbelow the economic level; whereas a deferment of the Project could cause deterioration of the \nreliability  of  power  supply.  The  high  ADB  cost-sharing ratio is justified given the current fiscal \nsituation  of  the  Government  and  environmental  benefits  from  the  Project.  Although a modest \neconomic recovery has been experienced, the fiscal situation remains under severe stress. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements   \n\n1. \n\nProject Management and Consultation \n\n46. \nDGEEU will be the Executing Agency as it is responsible for approval of electricity tariffs \nand implementation of power sector restructuring, which are two critical aspects of the Project. \nDGEEU also has administrative control over PLN, which will be the Implementing Agency. PLN \nhas  established  SBUs  at  the  regional  level  to  manage  day-to-day  project  implementation  and \nensure  achievement  of  project  performance  targets.  PLN  will  establish  the  necessary \ncoordinating functions at the head office to facilitate effective operation of SBUs.  \n \nThe  project  management  will  follow  the  decentralized  setup  of  PLN.  A  sector  project \n47. \ndirector  has  been  appointed  at  the  headquarters  to  coordinate  all  the  activities  related  the \nimplementation of the two sector projects (footnote 13). The sector project director and staff will \ncoordinate  (i)  project  implementation  and  schedule,  (ii)  procurement,  (iii)  design  and \nengineering,  (iv)  environment,  (v)  land  acquisition,  and  (vi)  compensation.  A  subproject \nmanager has been appointed at each SBU and subproject teams will be established to oversee \nindividual subproject implementation.  \n \nThe  Project  also  seeks  the  participation  of  the  local  communities  in  finalizing \n48. \narrangements  to  implement  LARP  before  and  during  implementation  and  to  distribute  power. \nThe existing contracts with KUDs for power distribution will be expanded to include the output \nfrom the subprojects. \n \n49. \nPLN  will  engage  a  sector  project  implementation  consultant  (PIC)  to  help  implement \nsubprojects included in the Project and PTI Sector Project. The PIC's scope of work will include \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n(i)  preparation  of  subprojects;  (ii)  procurement,  contract  award,  and  design  review;  and  (iii) \nsupervision, and monitoring of all subprojects for both sector projects.21 Engaging one PIC for \nboth  projects  has  a  considerable  advantage  because  implementation  issues  and  terms  of \nreference  (TOR)  will  be  similar.  The  PIC  will  report  to  the  sector  project  director  and  support \nsubproject managers in project implementation matters.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\nThe subprojects will be implemented over 5 years, from April 2003 to March 2008. The \n50. \nconstruction  period  of  12  months  is  required  for  subprojects  using  geothermal  resources,  22 \nmonths (27 months in Papua) for the mini hydropower plants, and 36-42 months for the small \nhydropower plants.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n51. \n All procurement to be financed under the Project will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement. The following are the  threshold limits of various types of \nprocurement:  (i)  international  competitive  bidding  for  (a)  supply  contracts  estimated  to  cost \n$500,000 or more; (b) civil work contracts for small hydropower plant, $1 million or more; and (c) \nturnkey contracts packages, $1 million or more; (ii) international shopping for supply contracts, \n$100,000\u2013500,000;  (iii)  local  competitive  bidding  for  all  civil  works  contracts,  construction  of \ntransmission  lines,  and  equipment  erection,  from  $100,000  to  $1  million;  and  (iv)  direct \npurchase  for  all  contracts,  below  $100,000.  The  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  to  be \nfollowed will be subject to ADB\u2019s approval. The list of contract packages for the core subprojects \nis in Appendix 5, Table A5.1. \n \n52. \nPLN will recruit the PIC  using  quality-  and  cost-based selection (QCBS)  in accordance \nwith ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to \nADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  It is estimated that 117 person-months of \ninternational consulting services and 132 person-months of domestic consulting services will be \nprovided. The breakdown of effort and cost estimate are in Appendix 5, tables A5.3-A5.5. PLN \nis taking advance action to recruit the consultant based on a full technical proposal. An outline \nof the TOR for the consulting services is in Appendix 6.  \n \n\n4. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements   \n\nLoan funds will be disbursed in accordance with the procedures set out in ADB\u2019s Loan \n53. \nDisbursement  Handbook.  All  four  disbursement  procedures\u2014reimbursement,  replenishment, \ncommitment, and direct payment\u2014are envisaged to be used in this Project. An imprest account \n(the Government term is \"special account\") will be established in Bank Indonesia, with a ceiling \nof  $16.1  million.  The  total  of  any  advances  requested  should  never  exceed  the  estimated \nexpenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. Alternatively, \na more direct mechanism may be used for the fund flow, such as allowing PLN to manage the \nloan expenditure through a special account in its own name. Such a direct mechanism would \nrequire a consensus between the  Ministry of Finance and PLN before loan inception.  PLN will \nbe responsible for preparing all the withdrawal applications for authorization by the ministry. The \nstatement-of-account  procedure  can  be  used  for  individual  payments  of less than $200,000 in \n\n                                                 \n21  To  expedite  the  project  implementation  prior  to  loan  effectiveness,  a  separate  contract  will  be  prepared  for  the \nenvisaged  consulting  services  related  to  (i)  and  (ii),  and  the  expenditure  will  be  met  through  a  minor  change  in \nscope of Loan 1397-INO (footnote 11).  \n\n\f14\n\n \n\nseeking  replenishment  and  liquidation  from  the  special  account.  Supporting  documents,  as \ndefined  in  the  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  need  to  be  submitted  with  every  withdrawal \napplication for individual expenditure above $200,000. ADB reserves the right to conduct spot or \nrandom checks of expenditures covered by the statement of account, through disbursement or \nreview  missions.  PLN  will  maintain  comprehensive  project-specific  accounting  records, \nsupporting all transactions, to facilitate any audit review. \n \n\n5. \n\nAccounts, Audit, and Report   \n\n54. \nPLN will submit audited annual financial statements for (i) PLN as an entity, and (ii) the \nProject. The entity and the Project statements will be audited by an independent auditor and in \naccordance  with  auditing  standards  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  financial  statements  (for \nthe entity and Project) will be submitted in English to ADB not later than 6 months after the end \nof  the  financial  year.  The  audit  opinion  will,  among  other  things,  confirm  (i)  the  accounting \nstandards  used  to  prepare  the  statements,  (ii)  that  PLN  has  utilized  all  proceeds  only  for  the \nProject as agreed on between ADB and PLN, (iii) that PLN was in compliance as of the date of \nthe  balance  sheet  with  all  financial  covenants  of  the  Loan  Agreement  between  ADB  and  the \nGovernment,  and  (iv) \ntransaction  documentation  has  been \nmaintained to support claims to ADB. \n \n\nthat  statement-of-account \n\n6. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n55. \nADB staff provided PLN with the draft Project Administration Memorandum, which will be \nused  to  provide  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB,  starting  from  the  first  quarter  after  loan \neffectiveness. These reports will indicate (i) the financial status of the subprojects; (ii) progress \nmade and problems encountered during the period under review; (iii) steps taken or proposed to \nremedy any problems; (iv) the status of implementation and compliance with loan covenants; (v) \nenvironmental, LARP, social assessment, and poverty analysis-related indicators for monitoring \nand evaluation; and (vi) a proposed program of activities, expected disbursement, and progress \nof  subproject  implementation  during  the  following  quarter.  After  project  completion,  PLN  will \nprepare  a  project  completion  report  (PCR)  in  the  form  agreed  on  with  ADB,  within  3  months \nafter loan closure. The PCR will review the planned objectives and achievements of the Project, \nincluding costs and benefits, and performance and contribution of all parties associated with its \nexecution. ADB will review implementation at least once a year. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE    \n\nA. \n\nTechnical Assistance for Power Welfare Scheme  \n\nADB will provide TA to design and implement the PWS for low-income rural households \n56. \nin  the  outer  islands.  The  Project  has  potential  benefits  for  the  poor,  particularly  in  the  rural \nareas,  and  low-income households can expect significant long-term impacts from extension of \npower  supply.  However,  such  households  will  need  support  to  meet  the  initial  expenses  for \nusing electricity, such as buying fixtures, house wiring, and connection charges. The PWS will \nbe  designed  and  implemented  to  defer  the  cost  of  electricity  supply  and  minimize  initial \nexpenses,  allowing  household  income  to  rise  to  a  reasonable  level.  As  a  pilot  scheme,  a \nrevolving fund will be established to benefit 10,000 poor households.  \n \n57. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $1 million equivalent, comprising foreign exchange cost of \n$80,000 and local currency cost of $920,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $800,000 equivalent \n\n\f \n\n15\n\non  a  grant  basis  from  the  Danish  Cooperation  Fund  for  Renewable  Energy  and  Energy \nEfficiency in Rural Areas to cover the entire foreign exchange cost, and $720,000 equivalent of \nlocal currency cost. The outline TOR, cost estimate, and financing plan are in Appendix 7. \n \n58. \n \n\nTA implementation arrangements will be the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPLN  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  The  Ministry  of  Cooperatives \n(MOC),  as  the  co-executing  agency,  will  advise  on  the  initial  study  of  the  PWS \nand supervise implementation. KUDs will be involved as suitable in PWS design \nand implementation. Active beneficiary participation is encouraged to sustain the \nPWS. \nTA implementation is expected to commence in September 2003 for 24 months, \nincluding  4  months  for  the  first  phase  of  design  study  and  20  months  for  the \nsecond  phase  of  implementation.  One  international  and  two  domestic  individual \nconsultants will be recruited for the first phase, either directly or from a consulting \nfirm,  for  a  total  of  12  person-months.  The  consultants  will  have  expertise  in \nmicrofinance,  socioeconomic  impact  analysis,  financial  and  economic  analysis, \nand  institutional  mechanism  development. ADB will recruit them  using QCBS  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory \nthe  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. \nKUDs  and  other  agencies  acceptable  to  ADB  will  implement  the  PWS  in  the \nsecond  phase  on  a  pilot  scale,  initially  targeting  about  10,000  low-income \nhouseholds in the subproject areas. Results from the study will be disseminated \nafter  project  implementation  for  expansion  and  wide  replication.  A  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  consisting  of  PLN  and  MOC  will  be  set  up  to \ncoordinate and supervise project implementation, and a domestic PIU consultant \nwill be recruited for a maximum of 2 person-months on intermittent assignments, \nsubject to requests by PLN and MOC, to help supervise implementation. \n\nto  ADB  on \n\n \nB. \n\nPlan for a Project Impact Review \n\nDuring  preparation  of  the  country  strategy  and  program  update  2004-2006,  ADB  will \n59. \nconsider inclusion of TA for a sector project impact review to be done after completion of some \nsubprojects.  The  TA  will  measure  and  evaluate  project  impacts  on  poverty  and  labor  to  help \njustify  future  investment  in  rural  electrification.  A  full  poverty  impact  assessment  and  labor \nimpact  assessment  will  be  prepared  to  evaluate  direct  and  indirect  impacts  on  benefit \ndistribution and labor market operations. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses \n\n1. \n\nLeast-Cost Option  \n\n \n\n60. \nA  least  cost  analysis  was  carried  out  by  comparing  the  costs  related  to  the  envisaged \nsubprojects  and  alternate  diesel-based  power  plants.  Three  considerations  have  been  taken \ninto  account:  (i)  future  growth  of  power  demand  and  required  capacity,  (ii)  the  gap  between \navailable dependable capacity and required capacity, and (iii) how to close this gap at the least \ncost.  The  subprojects  will  operate  as  base  load  power  plants  and  thereby  reduce  the  use  of \n\n\f16\n\n \n\ndiesel-based power plants, mainly to operation during the peak-demand period.22 Financial and \neconomic  aspects  were  compared.  The  financial  and  economic  superiority  of  the  proposed \nrenewable  energy  subprojects  made  them  the  least-cost  option  for  the  power  grid  expansion \nplan.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n61. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the core subprojects. The \nEIRR  was  determined  by  valuing  costs  and  benefits  in  economic  terms.  Domestic  prices  in \nconstant 2002 value were used in economic evaluation. Capital and O&M costs were adjusted \nto remove taxes, duties, and other transfer payments. The local currency expenditures relating \nmostly to nontraded goods were equal to their domestic value, and a shadow exchange rate of \n1.05  was  applied  to  calculate  the  economic  prices  of  traded  goods  from  their  financial  prices \n(based  on  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.95).  The  energy  available  for  sale  was  valued  in \nterms of resource cost savings.23 \n \nThe  EIRR  for  the  four  core  subprojects  was  estimated  at  19.4\u201322.1%.  The  results \n62. \nshowed  that  all  core  subprojects  were  economically  viable  and  the  benefits  resulting  from  the \nindividual  subprojects  sufficiently  high  to  justify  subproject  costs,  including  capital  costs.  The \nEIRR  calculation  was  subject  to  sensitivity  analysis  to  test  the  effect  of  possible  unfavorable \nchanges in key variables. A summary of the least-cost and economic analysis is in Appendix 8.  \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nThe financial analysis of the core subprojects was carried out based on real terms using \n63. \nconstant 2002 prices. The financial evaluation assumed that tariffs will be set to achieve the full \ncost recovery and adequate rate of return. The annual load demand in the subproject areas was \nforecast based on a low-case economic growth scenario. The costs included capital investment, \nfuel,  and  O&M,  including  those  for  the  associated  distribution  system.  The  financial  benefits \nwere based on a comparison of with- and without\u2013project scenarios. The benefits were derived \nfrom  the  estimated  savings  from  substituting  the  existing  diesel  power  plants,  and  their \nreplacement  cost  (after  10  years)  attributed  to  their  shorter  life.  The  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn (FIRR) for the core subprojects was estimated at 7.4-11.5%, which  exceeds the weighted \naverage cost of capital of 4.3%. The robustness of the investment was evaluated by carrying out \na  sensitivity  analysis  for  changes  in  major  assumptions.  Details  about  the  weighted  average \ncost of capital, FIRR, and sensitivity analysis are in Appendix 9.  \n    \n\n4. \n\nProject Beneficiaries \n\n64. \nThe poverty impact ratio\u2014the proportion of net economic benefits accruing to the poor\u2014\nwas  estimated  for  core  subprojects  by  analyzing  the  distribution  of  the  net  benefits,  or  the \ndifference between economic and financial benefits. The net project benefit directly accruing to \nthe  poor  was  estimated  at  Rp41,583  million  during  the  life  of  the  subprojects.  The  poverty \nimpact  ratio  was  estimated  at  26%.  Indirect  economic  and  social  impacts  will  also  arise from \nreduced air pollution.  \n \n                                                 \n22  The subprojects will provide additional reserve margin, which would allow new connections without deterioration in \n\nthe reliability. \n\n23  The  economic  benefits  are  conservatively  valued  in  terms  of  resource  cost  savings  as  the  Project's  output  will \nsubstitute diesel power generation. There will also be other social and environmental benefits, improvements in the \nreliability of power supply, and new connections that would improve the quality of life in Project areas. \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nThe  twelve  subprojects  for  renewable  energy  use,  including  four  core  subprojects,  are \n65. \nlocated  in  five  regions  of  the  outer  islands.  The  total  subproject  area  population  is  about  5.2 \nmillion, of whom about 1.5 million are poor. Around 76,000  new customers are expected to be \nconnected to the power grid. The Project is expected to have significant positive impacts on the \nlocal  population,  particularly  the  poor.  Socioeconomic  benefits,  which  narrow  the  gap  in  living \nconditions between the subproject areas and other regions, will make living in the project areas \nmore  desirable.  The  improved  power  supply  will  increase  jobs,  make  information  and  modern \nconveniences more accessible, and stimulate small, medium-sized, and home businesses. The \nProject  and  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  efforts  such  as  microfinance  programs  will \nallow the poor, especially women, to raise their household income and standard of living. \n\n \nSocial and Poverty Impact \n\nB. \n\n66. \nThe  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement  signed  in  April  2001  states  that  in  the \nmedium-term,  poverty  reduction  development  priorities  will  focus  on  growth,  human  resource \ndevelopment,  and  good  governance.  Improving  power  infrastructure  in  rural  and  remote  areas \nwill  contribute  to  regional  equity  and  growth.  Public  infrastructure  such  as  schools,  public \nmarkets,  and  village  health  clinics  are  the  first  served  when  a  village  is  electrified,  and  power \nsupply improves access to quality basic services.  Since the initial cost of connection is often a \nbarrier for the poor, the TA will pilot a new mechanism to supplement schemes already in place \nto help defray the initial cost of connection for poor households. KUDs will participate in billing \nand collection, thus involving consumers in service delivery. The innovations will help promote \ntransparent  institutions  responsive  to  the  needs  of  the  poor.  The  summary  poverty  and  social \nstrategy, and details of the poverty and social assessment are in Appendix 10. \n \n67. \nThe beneficiaries view electricity as a \"basic need\" alongside other basic social services \nsuch as education and health. Electricity is valued because it helps improve the quality of life, \ngeneral  convenience,  personal  security,  and  safety.  Households,  including  poor  ones,  use \nelectricity  in  more  and  more  ways  the  longer  they  have  it,  and  unless  expansion  of  electricity \nand  increased  access  to  it  are  supported,  long-term development achievements will be more \ndifficult to attain. \n \nAlmost across the board, most respondents in the subproject areas saw electrification as \n68. \nhelping  improve  (i)  education  (by  allowing  people  to  study  or  conduct  educational  activities  at \nnight);  (ii)  health  (by  encouraging  longer  clinic  hours,  use  of  television  to  spread  information, \ngreater  safety  by  eliminating  kerosene  lamps);  (iii)  general  equity  (by  giving  women  access  to \n(by  promoting  small-business \n(iv)  economic  activities \nlabor-saving  appliances);  and \ndevelopment).    Respondents,  even  among  the  relatively  poor,  were  also  willing  to  pay  up  to \n10%  of  total  household  expenditure  for  all  energy  uses,  as  well  as  substantial  up-front \nconnection charge.  \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n69. \nNo significant technical risks are associated with the proposed investment. The Project \nis  considered  financially  and  economically  sound  and  capable  of  withstanding  reasonable \nchanges  in  major  parameters.  Institutional  risks  are  not  considered  significant  as  PLN  has  a \ncomprehensive  organizational  structure  in  the  outer  islands.  However,  the  success  of  the \nProject  depends  on  (i)  the  Government's  approval  for  revaluing  PLN\u2019s  assets,  and  a  gradual \nincrease of electricity tariff from 2003; (ii) decentralization of PLN and empowerment of SBUs; \nand (iii) timely preparation of required documents for subproject approval, efficient procurement, \nand  project  implementation.  The  Government  has  assured  ADB  that  PLN's  assets  will  be \n\n\f18\n\n \n\nrevalued  and  the  tariff  increased  on  time.  PLN  has  approved  the  establishment  of  support \nfunctions  for  SBUs.  The  last  condition  for  success  will  be  minimized through close monitoring \nand  ADB  review  missions.  The  Project  is  in  the  infrastructure  sector  with  revenue  in  the \ndomestic currency, exposing the investment to the foreign exchange rate. The ongoing reforms \naim at macroeconomic stabilization. Over the long run, the restructuring of the power sector will \nallow  managing  the  price  risk  through  the  competitive  electricity  market.  Until  this  is  possible, \nthe Government will gradually raise the electricity tariff to an appropriate level and reintroduce \nan automatic tariff adjustment mechanism to maintain financial viability. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironment \n\n70. \nThe Project has been classified as category B as the subprojects are small scale, not in \nenvironmentally sensitive areas, and will have limited environmental impacts during construction \nand operation. An IEE was prepared for each core subproject. A sample SIEE is in Appendix 11 \nto  show  the  nature  of  the  Project  and  its  likely  potential  impacts.  The  sample  SIEE  includes \nmitigation  measures  that  need  to  be  adopted  by  the  subproject.  The  IEEs  indicate  that  short-\nterm  interference  in  daily  life  may  be  expected  during  construction  due  to  dust,  road  damage, \nand  noise,  while  no  significantly  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  expected  due  to  project \nimplementation. Local villagers may be contracted to help manage the watershed for each mini \nhydropower  plant,  which  will  not  only  create  jobs  but  also  raise  public  awareness  of  resource \nconservation and help protect the natural environment. \n \n71. \nThe  Project  will  have  positive  environmental  impacts,  as  well.  The  construction  and \noperation  of  the  small-scale  hydropower  plants  and  associated  transmission  lines  will  replace \npower  generation  from  diesel-based  generators,  reducing  carbon  dioxide  emission  and \ngreenhouse gas emissions, thus reducing global warming. \n \nE. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n72. \nThe  initial  social  assessment  for  all  subprojects,  compensation  policy  framework  and \nprocedural  guidelines,  indigenous  peoples  policy  framework,  and  LARPs  for  the  core \nsubprojects have been prepared. The summary social safeguard strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n73. \nPLN  has  shown  a  strong  commitment  to  the  Project  in  general  and  to  the  Papua \nsubprojects in particular. PLN has a sound social development approach, which is sensitive to \nthe cultural, political, and social peculiarities of local project stakeholders.  Several participatory \nmeetings involving local government representatives, PLN staff, and large numbers of affected \npeople,  including  traditional  leaders  and  women,  where  organized  in  Tatui  (Yapen),  Prafi \n(Manukwari), and Amai (Jayapura), which are home to various Papuan indigenous peoples. \n \nThe meetings and intensive contact with NGO representatives in subproject areas were \n74. \nvery useful for understanding the complexities of Papua. The lessons learned are being used to \nbuild  a  model  of  the  social  development  approach  needed  there.  Subproject  preparation  in \nPapua needs to be fully participatory and contingent on preparing community-driven indigenous \npeoples  development  plans  (IPDPs)  fully  accepted  by  the  affected  communities.  Indigenous \ncommunities hold land as a community asset with productive and symbolic values and so the \nresettlement and compensation strategy will have to be adapted to local conditions. It may result \nin  a  compensation  scheme  where  community  development  schemes  will  augment \ncompensation  paid  to  affected  households.  Subproject  construction  will  start  only  after  the \nparticipatory process has resulted in a plan acceptable to the communities and PLN,  and after \nthe  plan  provisions  are  delivered  to  the  people.  The  timeframe  for  social  development \n\n\f \n\n19\n\npreparation  is  thus  likely  to  be  longer  than  once  thought,  and  successful  subproject \nimplementation ensured only if the social development tasks have been concluded.  \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nimprovement  program \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  PLN  have  given  the \n\n75. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n76. \nPrivate  Sector  Participation  in  Small-Scale  Power  Generation.  The Borrower and \nPLN  will  ensure  that  for  a  subproject,  that  was  initially  developed  by  an  IPP,  to  qualify  for \nimplementation under the Project, there must be (i) confirmation that the PPA is not signed or is \ninvalid;  and  (ii)  written  confirmation  by  the  IPP  to  PLN  of  its  willingness  to  withdraw  and \nconfirmation  by  PLN  that  there  is  no  scope  for  the  subproject  to  be  competitively  bid.  The \nGovernment and PLN will ensure that a new action plan will be prepared by December 2003 to \npromote private sector participation in renewable energy development. \n \n77. \nPLN Financial Management. The Government\u2019s relending to PLN of loan proceeds on \nterms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB  is  a  condition  of  loan  effectiveness.  In  addition,  the \nGovernment  and  PLN  will  ensure  PLN\u2019s  continuing  compliance  with  financial  management \ntargets  and \nassurances  on  operational  budgets  and  efficiency \ncompliance  with  assurances  on  tariff  levels  for  PLN,  based  on  factors  including  asset \nrevaluation and self-financing ratio.  \n \nSector  Project  Criteria.  The  Government  and  PLN  will  ensure  compliance  with \n78. \nsubproject selection criteria for noncore subprojects, including ADB\u2019s approval of commencing \nimplementation  based  on  submission  of  documents  including  (a)  executive  summary  of \nfeasibility  report,  including  cost  estimate,  contract  package  list,  implementation  schedule;  (b) \nsocial  assessment;  (c)  poverty  analysis;  (d)  IEE  and  SIEE  for  selected  subprojects;  and  (e) \nLARP and IPDP, where applicable, satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n79. \nProject Implementation. The Government will ensure (i) appropriate security measures \nwill be put in place at project sites for the PLN staff, contractors, consultants, and ADB staff to \nperform  the  assigned  tasks;  (ii)  PLN  will  streamline  the  procurement  procedures  to  include \nexperts  from  headquarters,  and  SBU  staff;  (iii)  timely  and  full  implementation  of  LARPs  and \nIPDPs;  and  (iv)  all  necessary  action  to  make  available  land,  rights  of  way,  and  other  rights  in \nland required for the Project, to prevent project implementation delays.  \n \n80. \nFinancing  Plan.    The  Government  and  PLN  will  ensure  counterpart  funds,  based  on \nannual  budget  appropriation  requested  for  expansion  and  upgrading  of  distribution  systems, \nland acquisition, building, taxes, and access roads for renewable energy subprojects, and 50% \nof local currency costs for the PIC.  \n \n81. \nthings, independent audits of PLN and project annual financial statements. \n \n82. \nEnvironmental  Safeguards.  The  Government  and  PLN  will  ensure,  amongst  other \nthings,  implementing  measures  identified  in  the  IEE  and  SIEE  for  the  core  subprojects,  and \nsimilarly  for  the  noncore  subprojects,  all  in  accordance  with  the  environmental  monitoring \nprogram  and  ADB's  environmental  procedures  requirements  and  guidelines  as  amended  from \ntime to time.  \n\nPLN  Financial  Governance .  The  Government  and  PLN  will  ensure,  amongst  other \n\n\f20\n\n \n\n \n83. \nSocial  Safeguards.  The  Government  and  PLN  will  ensure  (i)  preparation  of  plans  to \naddress land acquisition, resettlement, and project effects on indigenous peoples in accordance \nwith  CPFPG  and  IPPF;  (ii)  LARPs  and  IPDPs  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB's \npolicies  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples;  and  (iii)  preparation  and \nimplementation of the relevant subproject LARP and IPDP will be a condition for the award of \ncivil works contracts for that subproject.  \n \nSocial Protection Plan.  Within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  and \n84. \nPLN will ensure updating and finalization of  a draft social protection plan satisfactory to ADB to \nreflect the planned corporate reorganization of PLN taking account of the recommendations of \nthe World Bank-funded consultant. \n \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n85. \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  $161,000,000  to  the  Republic  of \nIndonesia  for  the  Renewable  Energy  Development  Sector  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility, an amortization period of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and such other \nterms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nand Project Implementation Agreements presented to the Board.  \n \n \n\nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n \n\n25 November 2002 \n \n \n\n\fDesign Summary \n\nPerformance Targets \n\nMonitoring Mechanism \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n \n\n \n\nGoals \n \n?

In 2001, the State Electricity Enterprise  (PLN) served 30 million consumers all over \nthe  archipelago,  and  electricity  sales  totaled  85.5  terawatt-hour  (TWh).    About  56%  of  the \nelectricity was consumed for industry and commerce. PLN operates over 1,100 power grids, the \nlargest being the Java-Bali power grid with a power generation capacity of 18.4 gigawatt (GW). \nHowever, only about 53% of the population is connected to the power grids and so considerable \ngrowth is still needed.  \n \nPLN  has  prepared  a  long-term  power  development  plan  (2002\u20132010).  Based  on  least-\n2. \ncost principles, limited-, low-, medium-, and high-growth scenarios have been considered. The \nlimited-growth scenario is necessary to reflect immediate financial constraints, which may only \npermit completion of the committed projects.   \n \nB. \n\nExisting Power Generation Capacity \n\n3. \nPLN  owns  and  operates  about  4,055  generating  units  with  a  total  capacity  of  21,000 \nmegawatt (MW). About 74% of the capacity is in Java-Bali, and the rest is scattered throughout \nthe outer islands (Table A2.1).  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Installed Capacity of PLN Power Plants \n(MW) \n \n\nType of Power Plant  Outer Islands \n\nJava-Bali \n\nHydropower \nCombine Cycle \n  Gas Fired \n  Oil Fired \nSteam \n  Gas Fired \n  Oil Fired \n  Coal \nGeothermal \nGas Turbine \nDiesel \n   \nSource: PLN \n\nTotal \n\n \nC. \n\nPrimary Energy Use  \n\n714 \n \n876 \n0 \n \n \n310 \n590 \n20 \n646 \n2,441 \n5,511 \n \n\n2,391 \n \n 3,268 \n2,717 \n \n1,000 \n    800 \n4,200 \n360 \n558 \n109 \n15,492 \n \n\nTotal \n\n3,105 \n \n4,146 \n2,717 \n \n1,000 \n1,110 \n4,790 \n380 \n1,204 \n2,550 \n21,003 \n \n\nTotal  power  generation  in  2001  was  101.6  TWh,  which  included  the  power  purchased \n4. \nfrom  independent  power  producers  (13.3  TWh)  and  from  leased  generating  plants  (0.7  TWh). \nVarious  primary  energy  sources  were  utilized:  coal  (33.5%),  natural  gas  (29%),  fuel  oil  (22%), \nhydropower (12%), and geothermal sources (3.4%). \n  \n\n \n\n\f24\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nD. \n\nOperating Performance \n\n5. \nAverage  transmission  and  distribution  loss  during  1997-2001  was  12.3%,  which  is \nconsiderably lower than in other developing economies.24 The average frequency and duration \nof interruptions reflect the reliability and quality of service provided by a utility to its consumers. \nAlthough  performance  is  generally  satisfactory,  the  5  year  data  suggests  the  need  of  regular \nmaintenance and upgrading of the distribution networks (Table A2.2). \n \n\nTable A2.2: Losses and Interruptions \n(%) \n\n \n\n \nE. \n\nItem \n\nLosses  \n\nSAIDI \n\nSAIFI \n\n1997 \n\n12.10 \n\n15.15 \n\n12.81 \n\n1998 \n\n12.34 \n\n15.58 \n\n18.68 \n\n1999 \n\n12.22 \n\n14.00 \n\n18.49 \n\n2000 \n\n11.50 \n\n13.90 \n\n18.10 \n\n2001 \n\n13.48 \n\n13.24 \n\n15.12 \n\nSAIDI  =  system  average  interruption  duration  index  (hours  per  customer),  SAIFI  =  system \naverage interruption frequency index (times per customer) \nSource: PLN \n\nForecast of Power Demand  \n\n6. \nPower  demand  cannot  be  forecast  with  complete  certainty.  A  number  of  models  are \navailable to utilities. PLN uses one based on gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate; level of \nelectrification  ratio;  and  efforts  to  replace  captive  power  supply,  which  is  conservatively \nestimated at 10,000 MW. PLN\u2019s forecast considers a GDP growth rate of 3.5\u20136.0% as given by \nthe  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS).  The  high-growth  scenario  would \nrequire prohibitively high capital investment in the power sector and, therefore, only scenarios of \nlimited (financial constraint preventing new commitment), low, and medium growth are analyzed \n(Table A2.3).  \n \n\nTable A2.3: Projected Energy Demand \n(GWh) \n \n\nEnergy \nDemand \n\nJava-Bali \n\n \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLimited \n\n67,927   74,080   76,440   80,430   84,628   84,628  \n\n84,430   84,430  \n\n84,430  \n\n84,430  \n\nLow \n\n67,927   74,080   80,029   85,607   91,862   98,486  \n\n105,449   113,214   121,900   131,334  \n\nMedium \n\n67,927   74,080   82,092   89,272   97,469   106,223  \n\n115,550   125,463   135,973   147,088  \n\nOuter Islands \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLimited \n\n16,592   18,104   16,956   17,669   18,178   18,511  \n\n18,559   18,608  \n\n18,657  \n\n18,708  \n\nLow \n\n16,592   18,104   18,422   20,090   21,910   23,898  \n\n26,067   28,436  \n\n31,022  \n\n33,848  \n\n16,592   18,104   19,337   21,415   23,721   26,278  \n\nMedium \nSource: PLN \n                                                 \n24  These  losses  are  commonly  attributed  to  technical  and  nontechnical  reasons.  Two  major  reasons  for  technical \nlosses are that (i) small consumers constitute a relatively high portion of all consumers and are supplied through a \nlarge low-voltage distribution network (440 volts), which has high current flows and high heat losses; and (ii) a lack \nof  timely  expansion  and  improvement  of  the  distribution  networks  causes  overloads.  The  nontechnical  reason  is \nillegal electricity consumption, either as an unauthorized connection or tampering of energy meters. \n\n29,116   32,267  \n\n35,739  \n\n39,463  \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\nThe  availability  of  funds  will  determine  the  most  likely  scenario,  and  the  present  plans \n7. \nare based on the limited-growth scenario for the Java-Bali power grid. Its energy sales growth \nrate will be 4.2\u20134.6% in 2003\u20132005, less than the growth rate in 1995\u20132001 (8.8%). By 2005, \ncapacity  would  be  fully  utilized  and  the  system  may  not  be  able  to  support  further  demand \ngrowth.  \n \n8. \nUnder  a  conservative  plan  (low  economic  growth)  that  would  be  possible  with \nimprovement  in  financial  performance,  the  national  electricity  sales  growth  is  projected  to  be \nabout  6.9%  per  annum.  The  forecasts  take  into  account  the  impact  of  the  Government\u2019s \neconomic  reform  program  to  reduce  poverty  and  promote  regional  autonomy.  Reforms  will \nincrease  the  electrification  ratio  from  53%  to  75%  by  2010.  Electricity  sales  growth  rate  in  the \nouter islands (7.4%) will be a little higher than in Java-Bali (6.8%).  \n \nF. \n\nGeneration Expansion Plan \n\n9. \nThe  installed  generating  capacity  in  Java-Bali  is  18,700  MW,  comprising  PLN-owned \nplants of 15,700 MW and independent power producer (IPP)-owned of 3,000 MW. Due to aging \nof PLN\u2019s power plants, about 1,000 MW are not available. A peak power demand of 13,041 MW \nwas recorded on 13 November 2001. The generation capacity expansion plan is formulated on \na  reserve  margin  criterion25  with  a  loss  of  load  probability  of  1  day  per  year.  Based  on  past \nexperience,  a  reserve  margin  of  25\u201330%  is  required,  and  in  the  low-growth scenario, 11,000 \nMW  of  additional  capacity  will  be  needed  in  Java-Bali  by  2010.  Considering  the  financial \nconstraints (limited-growth scenario), addition of only 3,700 MW is likely by 2006. \n \nIn  the  outer  islands,  about  746  MW  generation  capacity  is  under  construction,  which \n10. \nincludes  hydropower  plants  (546  MW)  and  coal-based  power  plants  (200  MW).  The  power \nsupply situation in most power grids is unsatisfactory, and the required additional capacity in the \nmedium-growth scenario will be from various power plants: gas turbine (1,400 MW); geothermal \n(50  MW);  coal  based  (270  MW);  hydropower  (20  MW);  diesel  based  (390  MW);  and  mini \nhydropower (20 MW). \n \n11. \nprojects.  \n \nG. \n\nAn estimated $5.5 billion will be needed in 2002-2005, excluding the investment in IPP \n\nFunds Needed for Transmission, Substations, and Distribution \n\nTo maintain the reliability and quality  of power supply, the transmission and distribution \n12. \nnetworks should also be expanded to (i) prevent overloading of substations, (ii) provide flexibility \nin  operation  through  interconnecting  power  grids,  and  (iii)  evacuate  power  from  new  power \nplants.  \n \n13. \nPLN has prepared an investment plan for 2002-2005 based on (i) energy sales growth \nrate according to the low-growth case for outer islands; (ii) removal of bottlenecks in Java-Bali; \n(iii) operation of IPP power plants; and (iv) interconnections between Java and Sumatra, West \nKalimantan  and  Serawak,  and  Java  and  Bali.  The  plan  indicates  a  requirement  of  about  $5.5 \nbillion, which is the same as the requirement for additional power generation capacity. \n \n\n                                                 \n25  An adequate generation reserve should be provided to anticipate the possibility of forced or planned plant outages, \n\nand also to ensure reliable services. \n\n \n\n\f26\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nH. \n\nPlanning Constraints \n\n14. \nThe  higher  foreign  exchange  rate  since  1997  has  increased  PLN\u2019s  costs,  mainly  to \nservice  foreign  currency-denominated  loans,  and  purchase  natural  gas  and  power  from  IPPs. \nSince  a  corresponding  tariff  increase  would  have  transferred  the  burden  to  consumers  and \nslowed economic recovery, the tariff increase has been gradual. PLN could meet its cash flow \nrequirements for operations but was unable to service the foreign currency-based Government \nloans. Severe constraints were imposed on all new investments. While the demand forecast and \nexpansion-planning  exercise  indicate  a  large  fund  requirement,  the  financial  capacity  of  PLN \ndoes not permit it to raise its borrowings to $11 billion in 4 years. As long as the electricity tariff \nremains below the economic level, the private sector will also face considerable risk in investing \nin power generation. PLN has taken the following measures to partly address its predicament.  \n \n15. \nEfficiency Improvement. To ensure that consumers do not resist tariff increases, PLN \nmust  achieve  high  industry  standards.  It  involves  all  employees  in  improving  operational \nefficiency and promoting prudent capital expenditure. Since the efficiency improvement program \nstarted in 1999, PLN estimates that it has saved about $60 million in operational expenditure. \n \n16. \nRehabilitation  of  Power  Plants.  PLN  has  focused  on  rehabilitating  inefficient  and \nderated power plants, which provided larger benefits and required less time to implement than \nadding new power generating capacity. The program includes the following:  \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nrehabilitation of seven small hydropower plants in Java (completed in 2000); \nefficiency improvement of Muara Karang steam gas-based units 4 and 5 (2 x 200 \nMW),  under  cooperation  with  the  New  Energy  and  Industrial  Technology \nDevelopment Organization of Japan; and \nefficiency improvement of Gresik steam oil-based units 1 and 2  (2 x 100 MW) by \nconversion  to  gas-based  units,  under  cooperation  with  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency. \n\n \n17. \nExcess  Power  from  Captive  Power  Plants.  PLN  is  investigating  the  possibility  of \ncooperating with owners of captive power plants to help meet power requirements during high-\ndemand  evenings.  Based  on  a  December  2001  survey,  about  200  MW  capacity  may  be \navailable from such power plants in Java in 2002.  \n \n18. \nDemand-Side Management.  PLN  will  launch  a  demand-side management program in \nclose cooperation with customers on voluntary basis. It will include electricity price adjustment \nduring  high-demand  periods,  energy  conservation,  and  voluntary  load  curtailment.  In  the  first \nstage, the proposed program has the potential to reduce the peak demand in Java-Bali  by 140 \nMW in 2002. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS  \n \n\nA. \n\nFinancial Performance of the State Electricity Enterprise  \n\nThe  financial  performance  of  the  State  Electricity  Enterprise  (PLN)  in  1995\u20132001  is \n\nTable A3.1: Past Financial Performance of the State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) \n\n1. \nsummarized in Table A3.1. \n \n\nAverage revenue increase \n\n% \n\n \nItem \n\nEnergy sales  \n\nSales increases  \n\nOperating revenue \nAverage revenues  \n\nOperating expenses  \n\nEBIT \n\nDebt service  \nNet income after tax \n\nInternal sources of funds  \nReturn on assets a \nReturn on equity \n\nOperating ratio \nDebt to debt + equity ratio \n\n \n\nUnit \n \n\nGWh \n\n% \n\nRp billion \nRp/kWh \n\nRp billion \n\nRp billion \n\nRp billion \nRp billion \n\nRp billion \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n% \n\n1995 \n\n1996 \n\n1997 \n\n1998 \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n49,749 \n\n56,932\n\n64,312 \n\n65,144\n\n71,004 \n\n79,165\n\n85,528 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n8,306 \n163.0 \n\n6,537 \n\n1,769 \n\n576 \n1,020 \n\n3.328 \n\n3.7 \n\n \n\n78.7 \n27.7 \n\n5.8 \n\n14.4\n\n9,646\n165.4\n\n1.5\n\n7,713 \n\n1,933 \n\n1,897\n1,178 \n\n4.542\n\n4.7\n\n4.0\n\n80.0\n34.7\n\n2.4 \n\n13.0 \n\n11,126 \n169.1 \n\n1.3\n\n9.0 \n\n11.5\n\n8.0 \n\n14,036\n211.3\n\n15,997 \n220.7 \n\n22,557\n279.7\n\n28,625 \n330.6 \n\n2.2 \n\n24.9\n\n4.4 \n\n26.7\n\n18.2 \n\n9,450 \n\n16,809 \n\n21,503 \n\n27,216 \n\n31,939 \n\n1,676 \n\n(2,773)\n\n(5,506) \n\n(4,659)\n\n(3,315) \n\n3,435  1,602.0\n(9,546)\n(580) \n\n4,043.0  3,894.0\n(11,368)  (24,611)\n\n5.833 \n\n269\n\n1.426 \n\n(7.474)\n\n3.2 \n\n(1.9) \n\n84.9 \n45.3 \n\n1.7 \n\n(13.3)\n\n(40.8)\n\n119.8\n64.6\n\n0.2 \n\n(9.3) \n\n(0.9)\n\n(89.6) \n\n(132.1)\n\n134.4 \n78.5 \n\n0.4 \n\n120.7\n72.0\n\n(1.9)\n\n3,971 \n180 \n\n7,409 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.9 \n\n111.6 \n71.6 \n\n1.9 \n\n79.7 \n\nDebt service coverage ratio \n\ntimes  \n\n \n\n8.0 \n\n33.6\n\n40.8\n\n69.6\n\n12.7 \n\n33.1 \n\nSelf financing ratio (annual) \n% \na Defined as operating income less tax / average net fixed assets in operation. \nSource: State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) \n \nThe lower foreign exchange rate of the rupiah resulting from the 1997 crisis considerably \n2. \nincreased  PLN\u2019s  operating  and  debt  servicing  costs.  The  operating  ratio  (operating  expense \ndivided  by  operating  revenue)  became  more  than  100%,  and  the  debt  service  coverage  ratio \ndropped below 1.0, indicating that PLN could not service all its debt.26 However, the cash flow \nneeded for operations was possible, as PLN did not service the loans that had been relent by \nthe  Government.  The  default  attracted  a  penalty  of  Rp13  trillion  in  2000,  resulting  in  a \ncumulative  loss  that  not  only  wiped  out  the  retained  earnings  from  earlier  years  but  also \nthreatened to make the net value (equity and retained earnings) negative, making the company \ntechnically insolvent.  \n \n3. \nThe  impact  of  higher  foreign  exchange-linked  operating  and  debt  servicing  costs  was \nforeseen  during  the  preparation  of  the  1999  Loan  1673-INO:  Power  Sector  Restructuring \nProgram  (the  Program)  and  during  loan  appraisal.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nacknowledged  the  need  to  restructure  the  high-cost  debt.  At  the  time,  the  Government  faced \neven greater financial stress and could not immediately offer relief to a state-owned enterprise \non a selective basis. In June 2001, the Government as PLN\u2019s shareholder approved a financial \nrestructuring  package  that  implicitly  condoned  PLN\u2019s  failure  to  pay  interest  and  the  principal \n                                                 \n26  The self financing ratio is still indicated as positive because it is calculated from the cash flows, which do not record \n\nthe failure to service Government debt.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n28\n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\namounts  during  1998-2000,  and  converted  these  accrued  payments  (and  the  penalty  for  the \ndefault) into new long-term debt and equity. This financial package helped improve the balance \nsheet for 31 December 2000 by including (i) the conversion of Rp15.7 trillion of unpaid interest \nand Rp13.1 trillion of penalties into equity, and (ii) the conversion of unpaid principal amount of \nRp5.3 trillion into a 20-year term loan with an interest rate of 4%. \n \n4. \nHelped  by  the  withdrawal  of  the  default-related  penalty,  debt  restructuring  under  the \nsubsidiary loan agreements, a rising average electricity tariff, the renegotiated power purchase \ncosts,  and  the government subsidy to compensate for the low tariff for small consumers, PLN \nachieved a net income of Rp180 billion in 2001 compared to a net loss of Rp24.6 trillion in 2000. \nThe  government subsidy  of  Rp6.7 trillion and  the  decrease  in interest and financial charge by \nRp11  trillion  significantly  improved  PLN\u2019s  income  statement.  The  Government  has  already \nraised the tariff for 2002 by 6% per quarter and will raise it further in 2003-2005 so that it reflects \nthe  full  cost  of  supply,  including  a  reasonable  rate  of  return.  PLN  is  continuously  trying  to \nimprove its financial position  by,  among  other  things,  (i)  reducing  nontechnical  losses ; and  (ii) \nreducing costs by (a)  renegotiating power purchase costs,  (b) operating power plants using fuel \noil  rather  than  natural  gas,  and  (c)  reducing  fuel  costs  through  contract  amendment.  The \noperating ratio will be substantially improved in 2005, indicating that PLN\u2019s financial health will \nrecover  by  then.  Based  on  the  higher  projected  revenue,  PLN  has  the  capacity  to  borrow  for \nnew investments for next 4\u20135 years. \n \nB. \n\nProjected Financial Performance \n\n5. \n\nThe major assumptions for the financial projections are as follows: \nExchange rate: Rp9,000/$1 \n(i) \nInflation rate: 7.2% annually for local costs and 2.5% annually for foreign costs \n(ii) \n(iii) \nFuel prices: linked to international prices in 2004 onward \n(iv)  Maintenance costs: 1% of average net fixed assets in operation \n(v) \n\nPower purchase: reflecting new agreements with independent power producers \n(IPPs) \nEnergy sales growth (low-growth scenario): increase by 7.6% per annum in 2006 \nonward \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii)  Average  tariff:  increase  of  6%  every quarter  in  2003  and  5%  every  quarter  in \n\n2004, and no increases 2005 onward \n\n(viii)  Government subsidy: Rp3.2 trillion in 2003, and Rp3.3 trillion in 2004 \nAnnual investment (low-growth scenario): Rp161 trillion in 2003\u20132007 \n(ix) \nAssets revaluation: carried out on 1 January 2002 \n(x) \nCost of borrowing: 7% interest on ADB loans and 6.1% per annum on others \n(xi) \n\nThe actual and projected financial statements for 1999-2008 are summarized in Tables \n\n \n6. \nA3.2\u2013A3.4. \n \n7. \nPLN  has  requested  the  Government  to  revalue  its  assets  based  on  the  principles \nrecommended in the ADB-funded technical assistance.27 The net value of the operating assets \nwill increase to Rp173 trillion. Consequently, as of 31 December 2002, PLN\u2019s balance sheet will \nindicate a revaluation surplus of Rp74.1 trillion and government equity of Rp66 trillion, reducing \nthe debt-equity ratio from 61% to 27%. However, the asset revaluation will attract a tax payment \nof Rp8.7 trillion,  in equal installments for 5 years starting from 2002.

Accounts  payable,  including  arrears \nfrom IPPs, will significantly decrease from Rp19.9 trillion to Rp5.6 trillion due to  reduced power \npurchase  costs  as   a  result  of  renegotiations  with  IPPs.  To  continue  meeting  all  costs  and \nprovide  a  reasonable  level  of  cash  balance,  a  72%  increase  in  tariff  will  be  needed  in  2003. \nHowever, the Government plans to implement a more gradual increase of 20% per annum from \n2003 to 2005, which would allow a 6% rate of return starting in 2005.  \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Health of the State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) \n\n8. \nIn  many  ways,  PLN  is  a  well-run  utility:  its  operating  costs  are  low,  transmission  and \ndistribution  losses  are  reasonable,  and  revenue  collection  is  good.  The  inadequate  tariff  level, \nhowever, has adversely affected PLN's financial position. Sales revenue is expected to increase \nto Rp100 trillion in 2008 due to higher energy sales and tariff. The operating expenses\u2014mainly \nfuel  and  power  purchase  costs \u2014will  not  increase  by  as  much,  and  PLN  will  have  a  positive \noperating income in 2004, which will increase gradually from 2005 onward. Foreign borrowings \nof about Rp74.6 trillion will be needed in 2003-2007 for the investment program under the low-\ncase  scenario,  considering  the  cash  shortfall  remaining  after  equity  contribution,  operating \nincome, depreciation, and subsidy payment. The tariff increase during 2003-2005 will allow PLN \nto  service  existing  and  future  debt  during  the  next  3\u20134 years. The debt service coverage ratio \nwill increase to 3.4 in 2004, and the self-financing ratio will be 0.7% in 2003, and 53.9% in 2004. \nAsset  revaluation  will  significantly  improve  the  ratio  of  debt  to  debt  plus  equity  from  72%  in \n2001, to 27% in 2002, which will make room for larger borrowings. The average collection date \nis projected to remain within the normal range of 27-32 days.  \n \nPLN has obtained the Government's approval in principle to seek $804 million in official \n9. \nforeign  loans  during  2002\u20132004  from  ADB,  World  Bank,  Islamic  Development  Bank,  the \ngovernments of Belgium and Denmark, and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW); and through \nexport credit. \n \nD. \n\nLoan Covenants \n\nBased  on  the  projected  financial  performance,  the  following  financial  covenants  will  be \n\n10. \nproposed in the loan agreement: \n \n11. \nRevaluation of Assets. The Government will cause PLN to revaluate its assets from 1 \nJanuary 2002, in accordance with the  principles included in the ADB-funded study (footnote 2), \nand approve tax payment in five equal annual installments. \n \n12. \nImplementation  of  Electricity  Tariff  Increases.  The Government  will  cause  PLN  to \nimplement (i) gradual tariff increases in 2003 and 2004 to reach an economic tariff level in 2005; \n(ii) a tariff increase from 1 January 2005, to allow PLN  to maintain a self-financing ratio of not \nless  than  30%  from  2005  onward;  and  (iii)  a  formula-based  automatic  tariff  adjustment \nmechanism  from  1  January  2006,  to  protect  the  level  of  PLN\u2019s  tariffs  in  real  terms  by \ncompensating for changes in (a) the prices and quantities of fuel, (b) foreign exchange rate, and \n(c) domestic prices (inflation). \n \n13. \nOperating  Ratio.  The Government  will  ensure that PLN will maintain  every  fiscal year \nafter  31  December  2004,  a  ratio  of  total  operating  expenses  to  total  operating  revenue  not \nhigher than 85%. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n30\n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nDebt  Service  Coverage  Ratio.

Power system expansion has been planned considering (i) \nfuture development of power demand and load, (ii) the gap between the available dependable \ncapacity and other required capacity, and (iii) closing this gap at the least cost. \n\n \n2. \nThe  least-cost  analysis  was  carried  out  for  all  core  subprojects\u2014Merasap, Mongango, \nLobong,  and  Ndungga  mini  hydropower  plants\u2014by  comparing  them  with  alternate  modes  of \ngeneration. Since the power sector in the project areas mostly consumes diesel, diesel power is \nconsidered  a  viable  alternate  source.  The  least-cost  analysis  was  conducted  using  2002 \ndomestic market prices. Capital costs and operating costs, including fuel costs, were taken into \naccount,  and  taxes  excluded.  The  present  values  of  the  cost  streams  of  the  two  options  are \ncalculated along with equalizing discount rates for individual core subprojects as in Table A8.1. \nThe environmental costs were not included for diesel. \n\nTable A8.1: Least-Cost Analysis for Core Subprojects \n\n \n\n \n\nCore Subprojects \n\nNet Present Value \n(Rp million) \n\nRene wable \nResources Based \n18,827 \n19,805 \n25,958 \n24,312 \n\nAlternate \nDiesel Based \n21,379 \n19,959 \n27,463 \n32,059 \n\nEqualizing \nDiscount Rate \n(%) \n\n15.8 \n12.5 \n13.6 \n19.8 \n\nMerasap (1.5 MW) \nMongango (1.2 MW) \nLobong (1.6 MW) \nNdungga (1.9 MW) \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB. \n\nGeneral \n\nThe  economic  analysis  was  based  on  a  comparison  of  the  with-  and  without-project \n3. \nscenarios. Without the Project, the electricity shortage in the outer islands will be exacerbated, \nwhich may decelerate economic growth and worsen already-imbalanced regional development. \nWith  the  Project,  power  generation  will  be  expanded  using  renewable  energy  sources,  and \npower supply will be extended. Much hazardous emission will be avoided and the quality of life \nwill improve. \n \n4. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  conducted  using  domestic  market  prices.  The  economic \nprice  of  nontraded  goods  is  equal  to  their  domestic  prices,  and  a  shadow  exchange  rate  of \n1.053 (based on the standard conversion factor of 0.95) was applied to calculate the economic \nprice of traded goods. Due to local labor market conditions, an unskilled labor conversion factor \nof 0.75 in domestic prices was considered. Based on these assumptions, the main costs and \nbenefits have been broken down into traded goods, nontraded goods, and skilled and unskilled \nlabor; and conversion factors were calculated to value all costs and benefits in economic terms. \n \n \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix  8 \n\nC. \n\nCosts \n\n5. \nThe  main  project  costs  cover  civil  works,  equipment,  incremental  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs,  land  acquisition,  and  resettlement  with  and  without  the  Project.  The \neconomic  costs  were  estimated  from  financial  costs,  including  physical  contingencies.  Price \nescalation,  interest  during  construction,  and  taxes  are  excluded.  Local currency expenditures \nrelating  mostly  to  non-traded  goods  are  equal  to  their  domestic  value,  and  the  shadow \nexchange rate of 1.05 was applied to calculate the economic prices of traded goods from their \nfinancial prices. \n \nD. \n\nBenefits \n\nthe \n\nfrom \n\nEconomic  benefits \n\nrenewable  energy  development  subprojects  are \n6. \nconservatively  valued  in  terms  of  resource  cost  savings.  The  Project's  physical  output  will \nsubstitute diesel power generation in the project areas. The benefits from the net project output \nare  equal  to  the  resources  used  in  the  without-project scenario to supply the same amount of \nphysical output from an alternative source of supply, and the value of the benefits depends on \nsavings in the alternative cost of supply, which is diesel in this case. Based on the variable costs \nof  alternate  diesel  power  generation,  including  fuel  costs,  the  unit  cost  savings  from  replacing \nthe  diesel  generators  are  estimated  at  Rp809  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  (about  $0.09/kWh \nequivalent). \n \n7. \nThe  lifetime  of  the  renewable  energy-based  subprojects  is  about  10  years  longer  than \nthe alternate diesel generators, assuming that the proposed hydropower plants will last 30 years \nand diesel generators, 20 years. Resource cost savings attributable to new diesel power plants \nafter  the  initial  10  years  of  the  proposed  without-project  hydropower  plants  are  valued  by \nestimating the unit cost savings from new diesel power plants at Rp1,409/kW (about $0.16/kW \nequivalent), which is based on unit cost of alternative diesel generators. \n \n8. \nReplacement of diesel power generation by renewable energy-source power plants will \nimprove person's health, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and protect the environment. These \nconsiderable  benefits  are  mainly  social  and  not  easily  subject  to  economic  analysis.  The \nenhanced access to electricity in the project areas will increase the use of refrigerators, electric \nstoves,  electric  fans,  air  conditioners,  home  entertainment,  community and religious activities, \nand so on, improving the quality of life of local residents, including the poor. \n \nE. \n\nResults of Economic Analysis \n\n9. \nThe  project  benefits  will  accrue  to  all  energy  consumers\u2014residential,  commercial, and \nindustrial\u2014in the project areas. The new power plants will improve power supply and solve the \nenergy  shortage.  The  use  of  renewable  energy  sources  will  avoid  hazardous  emissions  and \nmeet  additional  demand.  The  Project  will  also  enhance  access  to  electricity  and  improve  the \nquality of life of local residents, including the poor. \n \nThe Project's economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was separately estimated for each \n10. \ncore  subproject  for  25  years,  including  5  years  of  construction  (2003-2007)  and  20  years  of \noperation (2008-2027) (Table A8.2). The results of the economic analysis show that all the four \ncore  subprojects  are  economically  viable  and  the  subproject  benefits  sufficient  to  justify \nsubproject  costs,  including  capital  costs.  The  EIRR  calculation  was  subjected  to  sensitivity \nanalysis to test the effect of possible unfavorable changes on key variables. \n \n\n\fAppendix  8 \n\n45 \n\nTable A8.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return  and Result of Sensitivity Analysis \n(%) \n \n\nVariables \n\nMerasap \n\nMongango \n\nLobong \n\nNdungga \n\n \n\n \nBase Case \nSensitivity Tests \ni.

The analysis also takes into account the cost of the \nassociated distribution system.  \n \nB. \n\nCapital Costs and Financial Benefits \n\n2. \nThe  project  costs include capital investment, fuel,  and  O&M. The capital costs for  the \nrenewable  energy  subprojects  include  the  engineering,  civil,  and  structural  work; mechanical \nand  electrical  equipment;  and  transmission  equipment,  including  that  for  the  associated \ndistribution system. The costs for land acquisition, buildings, resettlement, and access road are \nalso  included.  Annual  capital  expenditures  are  based  on  the  investment  program  of  State \nElectricity  Enterprise  (PLN).  All  capital  costs  are  expressed  in  real  terms using constant 2002 \nprices. The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR) was  calculated considering the  base  costs, \nexcluding  price  contingency  and  interest  during  construction.  No  residual  value  of  the \nsubprojects was considered in this analysis. \n \n3. \nThe  financial  benefits  are  based  on  a  comparison  of  scenarios  with  and  without  the \nProject.   The benefits derived from the estimated savings from substituting the existing diesel \npower  plants  and  their  replacement  cost  (after  10  years)  attributed  to  their  shorter  life.  All \nbenefits are expressed in real terms using constant 2002 prices.  \n \nC. \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital and Other Assumptions \n\nThe FIRR  was compared with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC) of 4.29%, \n\n4. \nwhich was determined based on the following assumptions: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan:  $161  million  (63.0%  of  total  funding), \ninterest rate of 5.6% per annum; \nlocal loan: $32 million (12% of total funding), interest rate of 20% per annum; \ngovernment funds: $63 million (25% of total funding), nominal cost of 10.6% per \nannum; \ntax rate: 30%; \ninflation rate: 7.2% per annum for local cost; \nreal cost: ADB loan\u20143.92%, local loan\u20146.34%, government funds\u20143.17%; and \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii)  minimum rate test: 4%. \n\n \n5. \nThe  FIRR  analysis  covers  25  years  of  project  life,  including  5  years  for  project \nimplementation. The annual load demand in the core subproject areas has been forecast based \non the low-case scenario. Comparing the with- and without-project scenarios, cost savings from \nfuel and O&M will accrue during subproject operation, and capital cost saving during the initial 3 \nyears  of  construction.  The  capacity  factors  of  generation  plants  are  assumed to be  57\u201385% \nbased on hydrological factors in the different subproject areas. \n \n\n\fAppendix  9 \n\n47 \n\nD. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity \n\n6. \nThe  FIRR  analysis  was  calculated separately  for  the  four  core  subprojects\u2014the mini \nhydropower plants in Merasap (1.5 MW), Lobong (1.6 MW), Mongango (1.2 MW), and Ndungga \n(1.9 MW)\u2014because each is connected to a separate power grid.  Table A9.1 shows a summary \nof the FIRR.  \n \n\nTable A9.1: Summary of Financial Internal Rate of Return \n(%) \n \n\nSubproject \n\nMerasap \nLobong \nMongango \nNdungga \n\nFIRR \n\n8.8 \n8.3 \n7.4 \n11.5 \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates \n\n \n \n7. \nThe  core subproject FIRRs exceed the  WACC of  4.29%, and so  the  base-case  FIRRs \nwere  considered  satisfactory.  The  financial  net  present  values,  which  are  discounted  at  the \nWACC, are also positive. \n \n8. \nTo  determine  the  robustness  of  the  results  obtained  in  the  base-case scenario and to \nidentify  the  possible  risks,  a  sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  on  changes  in  major  key \nvariables.  It  covers  three  variables:  an  increase  in  capital  expenditures  by  10%,  decrease in \nbenefits by 10%, and delay in implementation by 1 year. Another  two worst-case scenarios are \nconsidered:  when  two  of  the  above  variables  combine.  The summary of sensitivity analysis is \ngiven in Table A9.2. \n \n\nTable A9.2: Variables and Result of Sensitivity Analysis \n(%) \n \n\nVariables \n\nMerasap \n\nLobong  Mongango \n\nNdungga \n\nBase Case \nCapital Expenditure (+10%) \nBenefits (\u201310%) \nPower output (\u201310%) \nWorst Case 1a  \nWorst Case 2 b  \nNote: \na   A combination of capital expenditure increase and benefits decrease.  \nb   A combination of capital expenditure increase and implementation delay.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates \n\n8.3 \n7.2 \n6.9 \n7.8 \n5.8 \n6.8 \n\n8.8 \n7.6 \n7.3 \n8.3 \n6.2 \n7.8 \n\n7.4 \n6.2 \n6.0 \n6.9 \n4.9 \n5.8 \n\n11.5 \n10.2 \n10.0 \n10.9 \n8.7 \n9.7 \n\n \n9. \nThe result of the sensitivity  analysis shows that all the core subprojects achieve FIRRs \nof more than 4.29% of WACC in all cases, including the two worst-case scenarios. The FIRR is \nthus adequate and all the core subprojects are financially viable. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix  10 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL  STRATEGY \n \n\n \n\n \n\nYes  \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n      Yes \n\nSector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty  \npartnership agreement? \n\nA. \nSector identified as a national \n \npriority in country poverty analysis? \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \nThe  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement  signed  in  April  2001  states  medium -term  poverty  reduction \ndevelopment priorities will focus on good growth, human resource development, and good governance. Development \nof  the  power  sector  contributes  directly  to  each  area  of  intervention.  Improving  power  infrastructure  in  rural  and \nremote areas contributes to regional equity and growth. Public infrastructure such as schools, public markets, and \nvillage health clinics are the first to be served when a village is electrified, and electricity improves access to quality \nbasic services. Beneficiaries always view electricity as a \"basic need\" alongside other basic social services such as \neducation and health. Electricity is valued because it helps improve the quality of life, general convenience, personal \nsecurity, and safety. \n \nB. \nAnalysis: \nThe poverty impact ratio (PIR) expressing the proportion of net economic benefits accruing to the poor was estimated \nfor  core  subprojects  by  analyzing  the  distribution  of  the  net  benefits,  or  the  difference  between  the  economic  and \nfinancial benefits. The net project benefit directly accruing to the poor is estimated at Rp41,583 million during the life \nof the subprojects, and the PIR is estimated at 26%. Indirect economic and social impacts also arise from reduced air \npollution. A substantial portion of the core subject benefits will thus go directly to the poor, and the Project will achieve \nits primary objective of pro-poor economic growth. \n \nC. \nParticipation Process \nStakeholder analysis prepared  \nParticipation strategy: \nA series of consultation exercises and a survey of beneficiaries, including poor households, was carried out before \nselection of subproject locations.

The Enpogen study28 documented how \n2. \nrural  poor  see  electricity  as  an  important  way  to  improve  their  overall  quality  of  life,  make \nhousework  easier,  and  improve  feelings  of  security  (via  outside  lighting  at  night)  at  the \nhousehold  and  community  levels.  Besides  providing  household  lighting  (the  main  initial \napplication  of  electrification  among  the  poor),  electrification  opens  up  possibilities  for \nentertainment  and  access  to  information  via  television  or  radio,  and  for  the  purchase  of  labor-\nsaving  household  appliances  such  as  electric  irons,  rice  warmers,  and  even  electric  water \npumps.  Even though these appliances were seldom immediately available, the survey showed \nthat  households  seek  to  accumulate  electricity-dependent  assets  over  time,  even  where \nhouseholds remained income poor. \n \nWhile  it  will  not  guarantee  a  more  productive  local  economy,  electrification  is  a  major \n3. \neconomic building block.  Project activity is justified where development is lagging or held back \nby  lack  of  power.  Even  if  only  small  direct  benefits  accrue  to  the  poor,  the  indirect  benefits  of \neconomic  growth  and  jobs  will  benefit  all  persons  in  the  beneficiary  area,  including  the  poor. \nPriority will be given to connect not only households but also small businesses and community \nsocial and economic facilities, including education and health facilities that also serve the poor. \n \nB. \n\nElectricity Access in Project Areas \n\n4. \nElectrification  in  Indonesia  over  the  past  few  decades  has  been  impressive:  (i)  State \nElectricity  Enterprise  (PLN)  has  significantly  penetrated  rural  areas  and  has  a  high  degree  of \nrecognition  (even  in  nonelectrified  villages),  and  (ii)  it  considers  connecting  more  villages \n(extension)  as  more  important  than  connecting  more  customers  within  already-connected \nvillages (intensification).  \n \n5. \nThe district-level data is not readily available, but data from the village potential survey \n(potensi desa  [PODES]),  which  asks  village  officials  if  electricity  is  available,  may  be  used. \nTable A10.1 shows the percentage of electrified villages in the core subproject areas.  \n \n\nTable A10.1: Villages with State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) Electricity  \n(%) \n \n\nCore Subproject \nMerasap \nLobong \nMongango \nNdungga \nSource: PODES, 2000.  \n\nProvince \nWest Kalimantan \nNorth Sulawesi  \nGorontalo \nNusa  Tenggara  Timur  Ende \n\nDistrict \nSambas \nBolong Mongandow \nGorontalo \n\nElectrified Villages \n86.1 \n97.4 \n88.4 \n51.7 \n\n                                                 \n28  Insan Hitawasana Sejahtera.

While \nsome district-level figures fluctuate randomly due to the small samples, progress made, as well \nas relative deficiencies, in several project regions are evident. \n \n\nTable A10.2: Households Using State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) Electricity  \n(%) \n \n\nProvince/District \nWest Kalimantan  \n   Sambas \nNorth Sulawesi \n   Bolong Mongandow \n   Gorontalo \nNusa  Tenggara  Timur \n   Ende \n\n1996 \n44.6 \n58.0 \n71.9 \n74.5 \n33.4 \n23.6 \n40.6 \n\n1997 \n56.9 \n69.4 \n77.7 \n83.3 \n42.8 \n25.7 \n51.2 \n\n1998 \n59.7 \n71.4 \n78.4 \n82.3 \n43.3 \n34.6 \n50.3 \n\n1999 \n59.8 \n78.4 \n81.6 \n86.8 \n48.2 \n35.9 \n56.3 \n\n2000 \n63.7 \n81.8 \n83.9 \n86.0 \n53.4 \n32.3 \n57.6 \n\nSource: National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS) Core. \n \n7. \nHow  access  is  distributed  among  different  population  groups,  particularly  how  poor \nhouseholds  fare  relative  to  the  better-off,  is  important  to  observe.  The  data  in  1996-2000 was \nanalyzed and, as expected, the poor are less likely to have electricity, although, at least at the \nnational and broad regional levels, gaps are narrowing. Where overall coverage is higher, most \nnew connections go to poor households if only because most of the rich are already connected. \nThe poor are thus likely to gain greater access due to intensification in already-served areas, as \nwell as due to system expansion in isolated rural areas, which are less developed and have a \nhigher proportion of poor than less remote areas. \n \nC. \n\nAffordability and Real Demand for Electricity \n\nMany persons think they should not have to pay more than a certain percentage of their \n8. \nincome for a certain (minimum basic) standard of power supply\u2014say 4\u20135% of income for 20-30 \nkilowatt-hour  (kWh)  per  month.    A  study  under  the  Asian  Development  Bank  technical \nassistance  loan29  used  data  from  SUSENAS  consumption  and  expenditure  modules  of  1996 \n(precrisis) and 1999 (postcrisis) to show that rural households near the poverty line could afford \n(in 1999 prices) about Rp11,000, and urban households, about Rp15,000 per month, or around \nRp400/kWh for a lifeline supply of 30 kWh. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty Impact Analysis \n\n9. \nThe Project's poverty impact was derived from the economic and financial analysis. The \ndomestic  price  numeraire  and  the  discount  rate  of  12%  were  used.  Table  A10.3  shows  the \nthe \ndistribution  of  project  effects  (economic  minus \nstakeholders.  The  resource  savings  will  initially  accrue  to  PLN  and  the  Government,  then \ntransferred  to  outer  island  consumers  through  budget  allocations  for  rural  electrification  and \ntargeted subsidy for small consumers. The Project will benefit consumers (through a consumer \nsurplus  of  Rp175.4  billion)  and  labor  (through  jobs).  The  Government,  however,  will  suffer  an \neconomic loss due to inefficient resource use associated with domestic market price distortion \nrelative to world prices.  \n \n\nfinancial  present  values)  among \n\n                                                 \n29  Loan 1674-INO: Capacity Building for Establishment of a Competitive Electricity Market, for $20 million, approved \n\nin March 1999.  \n\n\fAppendix  10 \n\n51 \n\nThe net economic benefits (Rp159 billion) accruing to each stakeholder were allocated \n10. \nbetween the poor and nonpoor. The marginal government expenditure required for project cost \nfinancing accruing to the poor was estimated using the income share of the poor (around 14%) \nin gross domestic product (GDP); 25% of the consumer surplus is assumed to go to the poor, \nbased  on  the  proportion  of  poor  consumers  estimated  during  the  project  preparation  technical \nassistance. Based on the projected rural labor employed by the Project, 15% of the economic \nbenefits accruing to unskilled labor are assumed to go to the poor.

It  includes  core  and  noncore  renewable  energy-based  power  projects  with  a  82-\nmegawatt (MW) total capacity. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared for each \ncore subproject in accordance with the Environmental Assessment Requirements of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank. This sample summary IEE (SIEE) includes major findings and conclusions \nof  the  Ndungga  mini  hydropower  plant  in  Flores  and  was  prepared  for  analytical  purposes  to \nshow  the  nature  of  the  Project,  its  likely  potential  impacts,  and  possible  mitigation  measures \nneeded. \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Subproject \n\n2. \nThe  Ndungga  mini  hydropower  power  project  is  on  Flores  Island,  East  Nusa  Tenggara \nProvince.  Only  20  kilovolt  (kV)  distribution  systems  exist  in  and  around  the  main  localities  of \nFlores, and no major power generation facilities. Consumers are supplied from 42 diesel power \nplants scattered through almost all municipalities, and two mini hydropower plants\u2014Bajawa, Ogi \n(0.16 megawatt [MW]) and Ruteng, Waigarit (0.12 MW). \n \n3. \nThe proposed site of Ndungga is in Ende Regency, Ndungga village, Ndona district, in \nthe  catchments  of  the  Wolowona  River,  which  is  along  the  Ende-Maumere regency road. The \ndistance from Ende to Maumere is about 120.0 kilometer (km), and from Ndungga to Ende, 13.0 \nkm by paved road and 0.5 km by walking track. \n \n4. \nThe designed discharge of Ndungga is 3.7 cubic meters per second, with a net head of \n61 meters. The installed capacity will be 2 x 0.95 MW. The power plant will feed into the nearby \n20 kV distribution line connected to the load center of Ende. \n \nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nFlores  is  one  of  four  major  islands  in  the  northern  arc  of  Nusa  Tenggara,  which  is \n5. \nvolcanic in origin. The volcanic soil of the northern arc is fertile, although some is too ashy and \nporous to hold water well, while some has become weathered and infertile.  In the east, the lack \nof  rain  renders  soil  less  productive  than  it  might  otherwise  be.  The  alluvial  plains  of  the  north, \nbuilt  up  by  river  sediments,  are  generally  fertile.  The  island  has  few  permanent  watercourses, \nwith rivers and streambeds filling up and disappearing as and when the rains come. \n\n6. \nNusa  Tenggara  has  distinctive  fauna.  The  Komodo  dragon,  for  example,  the  world\u2019s \nlargest  lizard,  is  found  in  western  Flores.  Another  56  animal  species  are  thought  to  be \nindigenous, and many are endangered. Vegetation is sparse. \n \n \n7. \nFlores  has  few  modern  industries  or  commercially  valuable  natural  resources.  Most \npersons  rely  on  fishing  or  subsistence  agriculture.  Tourism  is  rapidly  growing  in  Lombok  and \nMaumere. \n \nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n8. \nThe  Ndungga  mini  hydropower  subproject  sits  on  the  Wolowona  River.  The  Ndungga \ncatchment  area  is  164  square  kilometer.  In  general,  the  Wolowona's  physical  and  chemical \n\n \n\n\fAppendix  11 \n\n53 \n\nwater conditions almost satisfy the water quality standard for category B (may be used as raw \nwater  for  drinking  water)  set  out  in  the  decree  of  the  Minister  of  State  for  the  Population  and \nEnvironment (Kep-02/MENKLH/1/1988). The use of the water for hydropower generation will not \naffect the water quality of Wolowona River. \n \n9. \nAccording to the 1994 general plan of regional planning of Ende Regency, the land for \nNdungga is zoned for cultivation, so no conflict in land use will arise. Based on field data, the \nland  of  the  project  area  and  its  surroundings  is  used  for  plantations  and  gardening  by  local \npersons. A part of it is unused state land. \n \n10. \nNo  protected  flora  and  fauna  exist  around  Ndungga.  No  significant  impacts  on  the \nenvironment  are  expected.  Seventeen  families  will  be  affected  and  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation  have  been  settled  with  them.  The  local  persons  hope  Ndungga  will  raise  their \nstandard of living either during construction or at project completion. \n \n11. \nThe protection of catchment of a hydropower plant is important for the environment and \nplant  operation.  Local  villagers  could  be  contracted  to  help  manage  and  patrol the catchment \nafter being trained in watershed management.  \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\n12. \nThe environmental investigations made clear that only very minor environmental impacts \nare expected. The proposed institutional requirement and environmental monitoring activities for \nthe Project are compiled in Table A11. \n \n\nTable A11: Recommended Activities for Institutional Requirement \nand Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n\nActivities \n\n1 \n\nTraining sessions for key personnel of the \nPLN planning department to address \nbasics of environmental protection; \n- \n-  methodology and procedures of EIAs;  \nenvironment-friendly planning and \n- \nselection of sites and right of way for \nelectrification projects \n\nResponsibility for \nExecution \nEnvironmental expert or \nscientist on behalf of PLN \n\nAssistance or \nApproval by \nInternationally \nexperienced \nconsultant, \nlocal university \n \n\n2  Assistance in detailed project planning \n\n \nactivities, especially for site surveys and \npreparation of project civil works \n\nEnvironmental expert or \nexperienced engineer on \nbehalf of PLN \n\nLocal authorities \n\n3  Conflict management of land acquisition \n\nprocedures \n\n4  Establishment of an environmental \n\nmonitoring program  \n- \n- \n\nfor project construction phase, \nfor the first 2 years from start-up of \nproject operation \n\n \n\nSocial development \nexpert on behalf of PLN \nEnvironmental experts \n(e.g., biologist, chemist) \non behalf of PLN \n \n\nLocal authorities \n \nLocal authorities, \nlocal university \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix  11 \n\nActivities \n\n5  Supervision of project construction phase to \nensure environment-friendly execution \n\n7  Preparation of progress reports of \n\nenvironmental monitoring (two per year) for \nfirst 2 years of project operation \n8  Establishment of an environmental \n\nmanagement program for   \nsubproject selection,  \n- \nenvironmental review of subproject \n- \nimplementation \n\nResponsibility for \nExecution \nEnvironmental expert or \nexperienced engineer on \nbehalf of PLN \n\nAssistance or \nApproval by \nIndependent local \nenvironmental expert / \nengineer in \ncollaboration with local \nauthorities \n\nLocal authorities \n\nEnvironmental expert or \nengineer on behalf of PLN   \n\nLocal authorities \n\nEnvironmental expert or \nengineer on behalf of PLN \n\nLocal authorities, \nlocal university \n\n6  Bimonthly preparation of environmental \n\nstatus reports during project construction  \n\nEnvironmental expert or \nengineer on behalf of PLN \n\nEIA = environmental impact assessment, PLN = State Electricity Enterprise \n \nF.  \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n13. \nThe IEE findings show that Ndungga, by virtue of its limited construction requirements, \nwill  have  a  neutral,  or  only  very  small,  influence  on  the  environment.  Starting  with  these \nenvironmental  impacts,  PLN  will  incorporate  mitigation  proposals  and  recommendations  for \nimplementation in the later project phases. \n \nG. \n\nConclusions \n\nThe proposed core subprojects will have limited significant environmental impacts. A full-\n14. \nscale environmental impact assessment is not required. Appropriate mitigation measures and a \nmonitoring  plan  and  their  implementation  arrangements  have  been  proposed,  and  an \nappropriate budget has been allocated in the project cost.  \n \n15. \nDevelopment of renewable energy will reduce carbon dioxide emission from the use of \nfossil fuels for power generation and reduce global warming. Contracting local persons to  help \nmanage  the  watershed  will  create  jobs,  raise  public  awareness  of  resource  reservation,  help \nprotect the environment, and promote regional development. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nA. \n\nBackground \n\nSUMMARY OF SOCIAL SAFEGUARD STRATEGY \n\nAppendix  12 \n\n55 \n\nThe  Renewable  Energy  Development  Sector  Project  includes  the  implementation  of \n1. \nvarious  subprojects  across  Indonesia  involving  the  construction  of  small  and  mini  hydropower \nplants,  and  construction  and  upgrading  of  transmission  (70  kilovolt  [kV]  and  below)  and \ndistribution  systems.  Four  core  subprojects,  representative  of  the  intervention  types  and \nregions,  have  been  prepared.  All  entail  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR),  and  one  also \naffects  indigenous  peoples.  Seven  noncore  subprojects  were  identified  and  are  under \npreparation.  Additional  subprojects  will  be  identified  after  loan  approval  and  prepared  during \nproject implementation. Land impacts are expected to be small or medium.  \n \nB. \n\nGeneral  Policy  and  Procedures  for  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  and \nIndigenous Peoples \n\nLAR  will  be  handled  in  accordance  to  national  law  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n2. \n(ADB) involuntary resettlement policy as detailed in the  Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to \nGood  Practice.  The  ADB  indigenous  peoples  policy  will  guide  subprojects.  LAR  preparation \nrequires (i) a common compensation policy framework and procedural guidelines (CPFPG) for \nall  subprojects;  and  (ii)  individual  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  (LARPs)  for \nsubprojects. Sector projects  require an indigenous peoples policy framework (IPPF) and specific \nindigenous  peoples  development  plans  (IPDPs)  for  subprojects  affecting  indigenous  people. \nThe preparation of a CPFPG, IPPF, LARPs, and IPDPs for the core subprojects was a condition \nfor project appraisal. LARPs and IPDPs, based on the detailed design and acceptable to ADB, \nwill be a condition for financing the noncore subprojects.  \n \n \n3. \nTo meet these requirements, State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) has prepared a CPFPG, \nan  IPPF,  three  LARPs,  and  one  LARP  with  IPDP  covering  the  four  core  subprojects.  These \ndocuments  were  complemented  by  an  initial  social  assessment  (ISA)  providing  preliminary \nimpacts  data  for  all  known  noncore  subprojects  and  by  a  social  assessment.  The  following \nsummarizes CPFPG, IPPF, core subproject LARPs, and noncore subproject impact data. \n \n \n4. \nThe  noncore  subprojects  will  be  prepared  after  loan  approval.  Adequate  social \ndevelopment  capacity,  inclusive  of  LARP  and  IPDP  preparation,  will  be  injected  into  the \npostappraisal phases, which will include providing sufficient social development expertise in the \nconsulting services for the sector project implementation consultant. \n \nC. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement  \n\n1. \n\nCompensation Policy Framework and Procedural Guidelines  \n\n5. \nThe  CPFPG  reflect  the  main  project  preparation  and  implementation  principles:  (i) \nnegative  impacts  will  be  minimized;  (ii)  compensation  will  be  sufficient  to  improve  or  at least \nrestore the preproject income and living standards of affected persons; (iii) affected persons will \nbe fully informed and consulted on compensation options and resettlement planning; (iv) asset \ncompensation  will  be  provided  at  replacement  rates;  and  (v)  lost  asset  compensation, \nreplacement  dwellings,  and  rehabilitation  provisions  and  allowances  will  be  provided  in  full \nbefore  ground  leveling  and  demolition.  ADB  approval  of  a  noncore  subproject  involving  LARP \nwill be subject to ADB's approval of the LARP. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix  12 \n\nThe  CPFPG  also  stipulate  eligibility  and  entitlements  for  land,  houses,  income  losses, \n\n6. \nand rehabilitation subsidies as follows: \n\n \n\nPermanent  agricultural  and  residential  land  losses  will  be  compensated  in  cash \nat market rates. \nTemporary land losses will be paid in cash at market rates. \nHouse  and  building  losses  will  be  compensated  in  cash  at  replacement  rates, \nfree of demolition expenses and salvaged materials. \nCrop losses will be paid to the affected persons in cash at market rates. \nRelocation  expenses  covering  transport  costs  will  be  paid  to  the  affected \npersons. \nBusiness loss allowance based on tax declarations will be paid to each affected \npersons for each month of interruption of business activities. \n\nAs for LAR processing procedures, the CPFPG establish the following:  \n(i) \n\nAfter  subproject  identification  and  completion  of  preliminary  design,  PLN  will \ncarry  out  an  ISA  to  determine  preliminary  impact  data  and  the  socioeconomic \nfeatures of the affected persons.  \nIf  through  this  process,  subproject  impacts  are  identified  as  \u201csignificant,\u201d30 a full \nLARP will be prepared.  \nIf,  however,  the  impacts  are  identified  as  less  than  \u201csignificant,\u201d  only  a  short \nLARP will be prepared.31  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n2. \n\nThe  sector  project  director,  through  the  social  development  unit,  has  the  overall \n8. \nsupervision, review, and financial responsibility for LAR. The subproject teams will prepare and \nimplement specific LARPs and share responsibility with local administrations for LAR, including \nasset valuation; consultation; entitlement delivery; and issuance of land acquisition, demolition, \nand building permits. Field tasks such as paying compensation, selecting replacement land, and \nproviding livelihood support will rest with village and local PLN personnel. \n \n\n3. \n\nDisclosure and Public Consultation  \n\n9. \nLARP  preparation  will  entail  intense  consultation  with  affected  families  through \nquestionnaires  and  community  meetings  involving  the  families  and  local  subproject  team  and \ngovernments.  A  booklet  summarizing  the  CPFPG  will  be  sent  to  all  affected  families,  and \nBahasa  Indonesia  CPFPG  and  LARPs  will  be  made  available  in  each  affected  village.  The \nsame  documents  in  English  will  be  posted  on  ADB's  web  site  and  made  available  at  the \nIndonesia  Resident  Mission  in  Jakarta.  Information  booklets  for  subprojects  in  areas  where \nindigenous peoples live will be compiled in the local languages. \n \n\n4. \n\nGrievance Procedures \n\n10. \nGrievances  will  first  be  lodged  with  the  villages.  If  no  settlement  is  reached  within  2 \nweeks,  complaints  can  be  raised  to  the  land  acquisition  committee  for  the  relevant  district \n(established  by  presidential  order).  If  still  unresolved,  outstanding  cases  can  be  sent  to  the \n\n                                                 \n30  Significant  impacts  are  (i)  200  or  more  affected  persons  and  (ii)  100  or  more  indigenous  people  or  vulnerable \n\ngroups and affected persons.  \n\n31  For full and short LARP formats, see Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. \n\n \n7. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix  12 \n\n57 \n\noffice of the head of local government. Final appeal for unsolved cases will be available in the \nappropriate courts of law. \n \n\n5. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n11. \nThe  LARP  will  be  internally  and  externally  monitored.  PLN  has  established  a  monthly \nreporting system involving the social development staff with the sector project director and in the \nregional  subproject  teams.  External  monitoring  will  be  assigned  to  an  independent  monitoring \nagency. PLN will report to ADB on the LARP in quarterly progress reports. External monitoring \nreports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  twice  a  year,  detailing  the  progress  in  implementing  each \nLARP  until  its  conclusion.  At  the  end  of  the  implementation  of  subproject,  the  independent \nmonitoring agency will prepare a report evaluating the results of the whole resettlement program \nand assessing affected families rehabilitation and satisfaction. \n \n\n6. \n\nFinances \n\nEach  LARP  will  establish  unit  compensation  rates  for  items  negatively  affected  by  the \n12. \nsubproject and will provide a detailed budget for LAR compensation. The budget will include (i) \nland compensation, resettlement subsidies, and house improvement or replacement; (ii) income \nrestoration  assistance;  (iii)  relocation  allowances;  (iv)  management  costs;  (v)  monitoring  and \nevaluation; (vi) taxes; and (vii) contingency. Cost estimates will be adjusted annually based on \nthe  inflation  rate  of  the  preceding  year.  Total  cost  of  the  resettlement  program  for  the  core \nsubprojects has been estimated at Rp6.5 billion. Cost estimates for the noncore subprojects will \nbe included in the respective LARPs. \n \nD. \n\nCore and Noncore Subproject Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plans \n\n1. \n\nCore Subprojects \n\n13. \nThe four  core  subprojects  are  mini  hydropower  plants  in  Merasap,  West  Kalimantan; \nLobong,  Gorontalo;  Mongango,  North  Sulawesi;  and  Ndungga,  East  Nusa  Tengara.  They \nrequire  short  LARPs,  which  reflect  the  stipulation  of  the  CPFPG  and  provide  information  on \ncompensation  rates,  consultation  activities,  and  budgets.  Core  subproject  LAR  impacts, \nincluding  affected  persons,  houses,  land,  and  relative  compensation  costs,  are  summarized \nbelow.  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nMerasap.  LAR  compensation  was  paid  in  1996,  and  the  land  acquired  is \nunoccupied.  ADB  reviewed  the  process  and  found  it  acceptable.  A  full  LARP \nsummary indicates that the subproject will acquire 5.5 hectares (ha) of farmland. \nNo houses will be affected and no resettlement will be necessary. The subproject \nalso  compensated  the  loss  of  2,037  trees.  Five  families  (29  persons)  were \naffected. The LARP amounted to Rp41 million in 1997. The local community and \nPLN  have  agreed  on  a  community  development  plan  for  an  estimated  Rp2.3 \nbillion. \nLobong.  A  short  LARP  indicates  that  5.2  ha  of  farmland  will  be  acquired.  The \nsubproject  required  removal  of  one  temporary  house  and  7,193  trees.  Twelve \nfamilies  (51  persons)  were  affected.  The  LARP  has  been  assessed  at  Rp972 \nmillion.   \n\n(iii)  Mongango. A short LARP indicates that 9.1 ha of farmland will be acquired. One \npermanent  and  four  temporary  houses,  and  1,040  trees  will  be  removed.  Thirty \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix  12 \n\n(iv) \n\nfamilies  (177  persons)  were  affected.  The  LARP  has  been  assessed  at  Rp904 \nmillion. \nNdungga. A short LARP indicates that 6.1 ha of farmland will be acquired. One \ntemporary  house  and  443  trees  will  be  removed.  Sixteen  families  (89  persons) \nwill be affected. The LARP is estimated at Rp2.3 billion. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nNoncore Subprojects \n\nThe  LARPs  for  the  identified  noncore  subprojects  are  in  various  stages  of  preparation. \n14. \nThe ISA estimating negative impacts has been prepared for all. Except for the small hydropower \nplants, short LARPs will be required for the noncore subprojects.  \n \nE. \n\nIndigenous Peoples  \n\n15. \nA few subprojects will affect indigenous communities. Some are relatively well integrated \ninto  Indonesian  society  and  culture,  while  others,  especially  in  Papua,  sharply  differ  in  race, \nculture, society, and political organization from the national mainstream. These differences have \nbeen  carefully  factored  into  project  activities  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  ADB  indigenous \npeoples policy.  \n \n \nGeneral indigenous people policy and procedural provisions are developed in an IPPF. \n16. \nSpecific  subproject  issues  will  be  dealt  with  through  an  IPDP  based  on  intensive  participatory \nplanning. Depending on the impact\u2019s gravity and the degree of indigenous people's vulnerability, \nthe  IPDP  will  either  be  included  in  the  subproject  LARPs  or  prepared  as  a  stand-alone \ndocument.  One  core  subproject  (Merasap)  will  affect  indigenous  people.  For  the  identified \nnoncore  subprojects  in  Papua,  the  preparation  of  individual  IPDPs  will  be  a  condition  for  ADB \nfinancing.  Community  infrastructure  that  may  be  provided  by  an  IPDP  will  have  to  be \nconstructed before the land needed by the subproject is acquired. \n \n\n1. \n\nIndigenous People Policy Framework \n\n17. \nThe  IPPF  provides  a  general  introduction  to  indigenous  people  issues  for  the  Project, \noutlines the criteria established by the ADB policy, identifies indigenous people, and provides an \noverview of indigenous communities to be or likely to be affected by the Project. The IPPF also \nsets  the  policy  and  procedural  framework  relevant  for  the  Project  as  a  whole;  outlines  the \ncontent  of  a  model  IPDP;  and  describes  the  strategy  to  be  followed  in  defining  different  IPDP \ntypes fitting the degree of impact intensity and relative vulnerability of affected communities. \n \n \n18. \nAs for the indigenous people identification criteria, the IPPF establishes that indigenous \npeople  are  those  who  in  various  degrees  (i)  descend  from  groups  present  in  specific  areas \nbefore the establishment of modern states and relative borders, and (ii) maintain distinct self- or \nnon-self-ascribed  identities.  Other  identification  criteria  will  be  used  to  establish  the  degree  of \nvulnerability of affected indigenous people and the type of action to be developed for an IPDP: \n(i) use of distinct languages; (ii) active maintenance of sociocultural systems and institutions that \ndiffer from the sociocultural system and institutional-political tradition of dominant societies; (iii) \npursuit  of  livelihood  in  the  margins  of  the  market  system;  and  (vi)  maintenance  of  unique  ties \nand attachments to natural resources and ancestral territories. \n \nThe IPPF establishes that IPDP interventions for affected indigenous people will have to \n19. \n(i) reflect local culture, beliefs, needs, and preferred options of affected communities; (ii) reflect \nthe  outcome  of  participatory  planning  methodologies;  (iii)  consider  traditional  procedures  and \n\n \n\n\fAppendix  12 \n\n59 \n\nfunctions  of  local  institutions;  (iv)  fit  local  production  systems;  (v)  promote  self-reliance among \nthe  affected  communities;  and    (vii)  ensure  that  adequate  lead  time  and  arrangements  are \nestablished for IPDP implementation. \n \nThe IPPF establishes that IPDPs will be prepared by specialists familiar with  indigenous \n20. \npeople  issues  and  with  anthropological  and  sociological  expertise.  IPDPs  will  include  the \nfollowing: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nan indigenous people identification assessment (IPIA) extensively describing (a) \nthe affected community, identifying the name of the  indigenous people; (b) type \nand  magnitude  of  direct  and  indirect  impacts;  (c)  number  of  households  and \npersons affected; (d) social organization; (e) livelihood and land tenure patterns; \n(f) history of relations with outsiders (including eventual  transmigrasi  [migrating] \ncommunities);  (g)  degree  of  adaptation  to  mainstream  society  and  culture;  and \n(h) local political forms and degree of participation into formal state administration \nmechanisms;  \nan  assessment  of  (a)  the  degree  of  vulnerability  of  the  affected  indigenous \npeople communities and of the type of IPDP needed based on the ISA and type \nof physical impacts of a subproject; (b) IPDP implementation capacity of affected \ncommunities,  local  government,  and  subproject  teams;  and,  if  necessary,  (c)  a \ncapacity-building plan to reinforce IPDP implementation; \na  thorough  participatory  planning  exercise  (to  be  documented  in  the  IPDP  text) \ninvolving  affected  communities,  local  governments,  subproject  teams,  and  the \nPLN social development unit; and  \na  community  development  action  plan  (CDAP)  (a)  formally  endorsed  by  the \naffected  communities  and  reflecting  the  results  of  the  ISA  and  participatory \nplanning  activities;  and  (b)  detailing  needed  IPDP  provisions,  organization \nframework,  monitoring  schemes,  and  specific  IPDP  implementation  schedules \nand budgets. \n\n \n21. \naffected by the subproject, to their degree of vulnerability, and to the type of impacts: \n  \n\nIPDP  type  and  initiatives  will  be  commensurate  to  the  variety  of  indigenous  people \n\nThe IPDP will be limited only to the  IPIA and will not require a specific a CDAP if \n(a)  negative  impacts  affect  indigenous  people  who  are  fully  integrated  in \nmainstream  society  and  culture  and  are  fully  in  control  of  the  national \nadministrative  system,  and  (b)  impacts  do  not  have  specific  sociocultural \ndimensions. The IPDP in this case will be included as a chapter in the LARP. \nThe IPDP will include with the IPIA directions to compensate affected persons as \nneeded  if  (a)  negative  impacts  affect  IP  groups  maintaining  a  degree  of \nsociocultural  and  institutional  distinction  from  mainstream  society;  and  (b) \nimpacts carry a sociocultural dimension but do not have broad community effects \n(i.e.,  the  houses  to  be  reconstructed  are  of  a  specific  traditional  type,  or \ncompensation  needs  to  follow  specific traditional procedures). The IPDP will be \nincluded as a chapter in the LARP. \nThe IPDP will include an IPIA and CDAP and will be prepared as a stand-alone \ndocument  if  (a)  negative  impacts  affect  IP  groups  maintaining  a  degree  of \nsociocultural  and  institutional  distinction  from  mainstream  society,  and  (b) \nimpacts not only carry a sociocultural dimension but also have broad community \neffects.  A  stand-alone  IPDP  will  also  cover  LARP  issues.  If  whole  communities \nhold  land  tenure  collectively,  the  IPDP  may  include special land compensation \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix  12 \n\nfeatures involving direct provisions for land users and generalized provisions, in \nthe form of community development packages, for what concerns communal land \nproperty. \n\n2. \n\nCore and Noncore Subprojects  \n\n22. \nOne core subproject, Merasap (West Kalimantan), impacts on indigenous people, whose \nissues are addressed in a LARP chapter. The indigenous people are Dayak villagers who are \nrelatively well integrated into the broader administrative system. Therefore, no stand-alone IPDP \nwill be prepared. The LARP contains a chapter on indigenous people, indicating the features of \nthe local sociocultural situation and detailing a number of specific interventions requested by the \naffected  community:  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  a  Christian  sanctuary  and  the \nconstruction of a wall to protect the cave where the sanctuary is from eventual floods. \n\n \n23. \nFour  noncore  subprojects  in  Papua  (Tatui,  Amai,  Prafi,  and  Genyem)  will  involve \nindigenous people. Considering local sociocultural features and the specific claims on local land \nand  natural  resources  held  by  the  Papua  communities  under  the  new  autonomous  province \nstatus,  these  subprojects  will  require  the  preparation  of  stand-alone  IPDPs.  For  these \nsubprojects  the  consultation  process  leading  to  the  conceptualization  of  the  IPDPs  has  been \ninitiated. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 October 2002) \n \n", "Currency Unit \n \nRp1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n \n= \n= \n", "rupiah (Rp) \n \n$0.000109 \nRp9,214 \n", " \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "ADB \nBAPPENAS  -  Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional  \n", "-  Asian Development Bank \n", "(National Development Planning Agency)  \n", "CDAP \nCPFPG \nDGEEU \nDMC \nDPR \nEIRR \nFIRR \nIEE \nIPDP \nIPIA \nIPP \nIPPF \nISA \nJBIC \nKUD \nLAR \nLARP \nLIBOR \nMOC \nNGO \nO&M \nODA \nPIC \nPLN \nPIR \nPPA \nPTI \nPWS \nQCBS \nSBU \nSIEE \nTA \nTOR \nWACC \n", "land acquisition and resettlement  \nland acquisition and resettlement plan \n", "-  community development action plan \n-  compensation policy framework and procedural guidelines  \n-  Directorate General for Electricity and Energy Utilization \n-  developing member country \n-  Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat (House of Representatives, or the Parliament)  \n-  economic internal rate of return \n- \nfinancial internal rate of return \n- \ninitial environmental examination \n- \nindigenous peoples development plan \n- \nindigenous people identification assessment \n- \nindependent power producer \n- \nindigenous peoples policy framework \n- \ninitial social assessment \n-  Japan Bank of International Cooperation \n-  Koperasi Unit Desa (village cooperative)  \n- \n- \n-  London interbank offered rate \n-  Ministry of Cooperatives \n-  nongovernment organization \n-  operation and maintenance \n-  overseas development assistance  \n-  project implementation consultant \n-  Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Enterprise) \n-  poverty impact ratio \n-  power purchase agreement \n-  power transmission improvement \n-  power welfare scheme \n-  quality- and cost-based selection  \n-  strategic business unit \n-  summary initial environmental examination \n- \n- \n-  weighted average cost of capital \n", "technical assistance \nterms of reference \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n", " \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "GWh (gigawatt-hour) \nkm (kilometer) \nkV (kilovolt) \nkVA (kilovolt-ampere) \nkWh (kilowatt-hour) \nMVA (megavolt-ampere) \nMW (megawatt) \nTWh (terawatt-hour) \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "unit of energy, equal to 1 million kWh \nunit of distance  \nunit of voltage, equal to 1,000 volts \nunit of connected load or apparent power \nunit of energy, equal to 1,000 Wh \nunit of apparent power \nunit of power, equal to 1 million watts  \nunit of energy, equal to 1 billion kWh \n", " \nNOTES \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n \n \n \n \nThis report was prepared by a team consisting of:  A.
