Fund II, to be established as a company incorporated in Mauritius, will be a \nclosed-end private equity fund (PEF), formed to invest in agribusiness companies in India and \nhaving a target capitalization of $200 million. Fund II is a follow-on fund to India Agri Business \nFund I (Fund I), which raised $120 million in 2008, and invested in similar medium-scale private \nsector agribusiness enterprises. Fund II will be managed by Rabo Equity Management Company \nLtd.  (REMCO,  fund  manager),  also  a  company  incorporated  in  Mauritius,  affiliated  with \nCo\u00f6peratieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank B.A. (Rabobank, sponsor), a prominent global \nagriculture focused bank. Rabobank is the key sponsor of Fund II (and of Fund I) and the majority \nshareholder of REMCO. REMCO will engage Rabo Equity Advisors Private Limited, (REAL, fund \nadviser),  a  company  incorporated  in  India,  as  its  advisor,  to  provide  investment  advisory  and \nmanagement services. \n \n3. \nInvestment  identification.  ADB  has  been  exploring  opportunities  to  support  specific \nsegments  of  the  agriculture  sector.  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  have  used  various \ninstruments and investment vehicles to allocate capital and resources to the agriculture sector: (i) \nsince 2006, about $100 million has been allocated to the sector through credit lines to banks; (ii) \nthe  Trade  Finance  Program  has  supported  about  $1.4  billion  of  food  and  agriculture  trade \ntransactions since 2006; (iii) direct loans and equity investments\u2014ADB has approved four direct \nloans for agribusiness companies, aggregating to $108 million, from August 2012 to August 2013; \nand (iv) investment in sector-neutral PEFs, which further invested in agribusiness-focused private \nenterprises. 1 \n \n4. \nWhile  there  is  continuing  scope  for  direct  financing,  the  dedicated,  sector-specific  PEF \nroute to  support  agribusiness  offers  several  benefits, such  as  (i)  having a focused market  and \ncountry  coverage  for  a  large  and  diversified  market  like  India,  and  reach  to  highly  specialized \ninvestments;  (ii)  supplementing  the  financial  intervention  with  a  more  pronounced  element  of \ntechnical and managerial support, which will be provided by a sector-specialist fund manager; (iii) \ncountering  the  cyclicality  and  uncertainty  of  the  sector,  through  a  portfolio  approach  toward \nagribusiness investments; and (iv) partnering with other private and multilateral institutions and \naggregating a higher level of capital, through a leveraging effect.  2 \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe  agriculture  sector  faces  severe  challenges  relating  to  (i)  diminishing  yields  from \nfarmlands;  (ii)  limitations  in  expanding  irrigation  and  increasing  the  net  sown  area;  (iii)  rapidly \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n \n\n1   A brief discussion of ADB\u2019s experience with PEFs and key lessons relating to their performance has been included \n\nin Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n2   A short note on agriculture sector-focused PEFs in India and their comparative standing to this investment proposal \n\nis included in Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\freducing  groundwater  resources  and  ever-increasing  dependence  on  farm  inputs  (principally \nfertilizers)  to  maintain  farm-output  levels;  (iv)  the  high  level  of  farm-level  and  storage  wastage \ncaused by poor linkages to markets and distorted pricing policies; and (v) limited value addition, \nwhich constrains rural income and employment levels, encouraging migration to potentially worse \nliving conditions in urban slums, and widening regional imbalances.  3 \n \n6. \nIn this context, Fund II will create a transmission mechanism to bring improved technology \n(like drought-resistant seeds), advanced resource conservation techniques (like micro irrigation), \nreduced wastage (through agri-infrastructure facilities like granaries and warehouses), and higher \nvalue addition (through primary processing activity in the dairy, fruit and vegetable, and oilseeds \nindustry,)  to  the  farm  level.  The  fund  manager\u2019s  contribution  to  the  business,  technology,  and \nfinancial  aspects  of  the  investee  companies\u2014in  addition  to  the  new  capital\u2014is  expected  to \nimprove governance and profitability at the company level, and deliver improved inputs, services, \nand value to the agribusiness sector at the farm level. 4 \n\n7. \nFund II will leverage both (i) the sponsor\u2019s agribusiness expert knowledge relating to the \nglobal  agricultural  value  chain,  which  is  well  demonstrated  through  the  extensive  research, \nadvisory, and commercial banking services of Rabobank in emerging markets, including India; \nand  (ii)  the  fund  manager\u2019s  dedicated  resources  and  preferential  access  to  commercial \nagribusiness opportunities in India, through its India-focused private equity investment strategy, \nwhich has been well demonstrated in the investment selection for Fund I. As such, Fund II, being \na  follow-on  fund,  will  benefit  significantly  from  the  pipeline,  business  linkages  relating  to \norigination, structuring, and funding of new investments and transaction-related cost efficiencies \nemanating from Fund I. \n\nStrategy. The fund manager\u2019s investment approach is based on four central principles: \n\n8. \nachieving attractive entry valuations through proprietary sourcing of deal flow; (ii) proactive risk \nmanagement of the risks associated with execution and expansion; (iii) enhancing value creation \nby advising portfolio companies on their business strategies and operations; and (iv) proactive \nexit planning, including installing back-stop arrangements in all investment structures. Fund II\u2019s \noverall investment objective is to generate returns driven by earnings growth and by providing \nexpansion  capital,  through  a  significant  minority  (or  majority  in  exceptional  cases)  equity \ninvestment in established agribusiness companies, led by experienced management teams; and \nto grow these, within 3\u20135 years, to a size that would be of interest to strategic investors, primarily \nlarger domestic or global private sector players in those segments. \n\nFund II will pursue an investment strategy similar to that of Fund I, making investments of \n9. \n$12 million\u2013$15 million each, in a balanced and diversified portfolio of 10\u201312 established, high-\ngrowth  businesses.  The  fund  manager  will  focus  on  companies  in  the  agribusiness  sector \nservicing  domestic  demand  and  with  possible  export  potential  that  are  poised  to  benefit  from \ngrowth  trends  in  the  following  four  subsectors:  (i)  agri  inputs  and  farm  services,  (ii)  agri- \ninfrastructure,  (iii)  primary  processing,  and  (iv)  processed  food  products  and  services.  The \nfinancial  analysis  details  the  Fund  I  investees,  the  strategic  and  operational  changes  brought \nabout by the fund manager, and their impact on the investees\u2019 performance. It also provides a \nsummary  overview  of  the  revenue  and  earnings  of  the  portfolio  companies  in  Fund  I,  after \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3   Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) gives an overview of the challenges \n\nfaced by the agriculture sector in India. \n\n4   Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) gives a snapshot of Fund I investments \nand highlights the diversity of the portfolio, specifically in upstream agribusiness, which is expected to be repeated \nin Fund II. \n\n2 \n \n\n \n \n\n\f3 \n \n\n \ninvestment\u2014highlighting  that  a  significant  proportion  of  companies  attained  levels  at  or  above \ninitial expectations. 5 \n \nC. \n \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n1. \n\nOwnership \n\n \n10. \nFund  II  will  issue  share  capital  to  its  investors,  including  the  sponsor  and  investment \nmanager. Fund II\u2019s initial close is set to raise a total of $80 million, from Rabobank ($30 million), \nCDC Group PLC ($30 million), and Development Bank of the Netherlands (FMO) ($10 million), \nalongside  ADB\u2019s  proposed  initial  investment  of  $10  million.

This threshold will be raised to 1.00% \nfor Fund II. This is normally not seen with other PEFs in Asia, and is a very positive factor for \nbringing  in  greater  alignment  of  interests  between  Fund  II\u2019s  investors  and  the  fund  manager\u2019s \nteam. It also acts as a source of the team\u2019s long-term commitment. \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernance Structure \n\n \n19. \nThe  fund manager  will  follow  a  rigorous multi-staged,  deal  evaluation  process  before  a \ntransaction is selected for final investment. In the initial stages, deals are logged in and mapped \nto the  pipeline  of  agribusiness  investments  in India,  assessed  by  the  REAL  team,  and  a  rapid \nassessment of the profile of the sponsor and the investment, in terms of risks and feasibility, is \ndone. The database of more than 640 private sector Indian agribusiness transactions assessed \nby  the  team  since  2008,  is  a  critical  reference  for  scanning  and  assessing  new  opportunities. \nDeals considered potential opportunities for investment are selected for initial due diligence and, \nwithin this subset, a few are proposed to Fund II\u2019s investment committee for initial approvals. \n \nThe investment committee for Fund II will follow a two-stage process. The transactions \n20. \nselected  at  the  first  stage  are  subject  to  extensive  due  diligence\u2014financial,  business  and \noperations,  technical,  legal,  accounting  and  forensic  background  checks,  as  well  as  the \nenvironment,  and  health  and  safety  dimensions  of  the  investment.  Only  a  select  few  are \nconsidered  acceptable  and  processed  for  final  decisions  by  the  second-stage  investment \ncommittee. \n\n \n\n \n\n21. \nThe data relating to the investment process for Fund I underscore its rigor and the quality \nof  investment  selection.  Of  nearly  640  transactions  included  in  the  deal  flow,  only  10%  were \nselected for initial due diligence, of which only 25% went on to the detailed due diligence stage, \nand  eventually  Fund  I  invested  in  10  of  these  640  deals  (a  1.50%  deal  conclusion  level, \nhighlighting a very high level of selectivity). \n\n22. \nFund II will also establish an advisory committee consisting of a minimum of five members, \nselected from among the larger shareholders (limited partner equivalents), including ADB, should \nit invest in Fund II. The role of the advisory committee will be to advise Fund II\u2019s board of directors \non  (i)  review  of  valuation  of  Fund  II\u2019s  assets,  (ii)  any  proposed  deviation  in  the  investment \nobjectives and policies of Fund II, (iii) resolution of any conflicts of interest, (iv) extension of the \ninvestment  period  and  term  of  Fund  II,  and  (v)  provide  such  advice  as      Fund  II\u2019s  board  may \nrequest. \n \nD. \n \n23. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  9, 10 \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nFinancial Performance of Fund I \n\n \n\n8  For further biographical information on the team, see Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9   [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\n10  [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\n \n \n\n\f5 \n \n\n \n \n24. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \nADB will provide an equity investment of up to $30,000,000 in Fund II, not to exceed 20% \n25. \nof Fund II\u2019s total committed capital, and not resulting in ADB being the largest investor in Fund II. \nTo mitigate risks, ADB will initially invest $10 million in the first closing of Fund II, with the balance \nof  up  to  $20  million  to  be  invested  in  Fund  II\u2019s  second  or final  close\u2014provided  certain targets \nrelating to Fund I exits and returns, and final Fund II size, are met within the stipulated period. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \nC. \n \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nFinancial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nExit Strategy \n\n \n27. \nFund  II\u2019s  preferred  exit  strategy,  as  seen  in  Fund  I,  is  through  trade  sales,  and,  to  a \nsignificantly lesser extent, public listings. In the fund manager\u2019s view, many multinationals and \ndomestic  conglomerates  look  to  acquire  companies  in  high-growth  sectors  where  they  do  not \nhave a presence, and will pay a premium for agribusiness companies that have a leading industry \nposition,  geographic  coverage,  strong  corporate  governance  and  accounting  standards, \noperational efficiencies, and stable professional management. The fund manager works toward \ncreating  these  value-enhancing  propositions  and  then  aims  to  deploy  its  local  and  global \nrelationships, principally through Rabobank, toward this end. Most of the investments in Fund I \nhave built-in put option provisions as last-resort exit arrangements. Fund II is expected to follow \na similar approach. \n \n\n2. \n\nReporting Arrangements \n\n  \n28. \nFund  II  will  provide  to  ADB  quarterly  unaudited  and  audited  annual  reports  including \nfinancial statements, a fund overview, and an overview of the portfolio, with information on each \nportfolio  company\u2019s  performance  and  valuation,  which  ADB  will  review  and  follow  up  on  as \nappropriate. \n\n \n\n29. \nADB  will  be  represented  on  Fund  II\u2019s  advisory  committee,  which  advises  Fund  II  on \nmatters such as conflicts of interest and other issues related to fund governance. 11 Detailed due \ndiligence  has  highlighted  that  Fund  I  reporting  arrangements  and  disclosure  standards  match \nexpectations.  Fund  II  will  adopt  similar,  and  some  improved,  reporting  standards  and \narrangements. \n \n\n11  The role of the advisory committee is to represent the interests of Fund II\u2019s investors. It will not participate in Fund \n\nII\u2019s investment process or make investment decisions. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\fValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nD. \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s participation in the first closing, as the nodal Asia-focused development financing \ninstitution (the other existing investors Rabobank, CDC Group PLC, and FMO have also invested \nin Fund I), is expected to have a positive signaling effect on other potential participants, and is \nexpected to facilitate capital mobilization for Fund II. By linking its first-close commitment to exits \nand evidence of the commercial performance of Fund I, ADB is indirectly increasing the prospects \nfor expedited capital raising, as this record will bolster the confidence of second- round private \nsector  investors,  who  will  place  higher  emphasis  on  commercial  returns. This  approach  draws \nsignificantly from the lessons learnt from ADB\u2019s previous PEF investments. \n \n31. \nADB will also establish better standards and measurement frameworks for capturing the \ndevelopment- and safeguards-related aspects of Fund II\u2019s performance as its capital is deployed. \nThese  measures  will  help  in  more  meaningful  and  causal  reporting  of  Fund  II\u2019s  development \nimpact, which has been an occasional drawback of such interventions and has been highlighted \nin the detailed evaluation reports on PEF performance prepared by ADB. \n \nE. \n \n32. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n33. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \n34. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nRisks \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n \n\n35. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \n36. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \n37. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACTS AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs  \n\n1. \n\nImpacts \n\n \nFund II will contribute to two development impacts.

This is a significant positive contribution of \nFund  II,  as  the  agribusiness  sector  is typically  owned  and  controlled  by traditional traders  and \nsemiprofessional  family-owned  small  businesses.  These  businesses,  though  with  very  strong \nroots  in  operations,  require  support  in  improving  standards  of  professional  management, \ndisclosure,  and  transparency  to  gain  acceptability  from  external  private  capital  providers  (debt \n\n6 \n \n\n \nA. \n \n\n \n \n\n\f7 \n \n\n \nand  equity).  PEFs  like  Fund  II  can  make  critical  contributions  by  bringing  better  management \npractices to these businesses, which also enhance the long-term viability of the sector (footnote \n5). \n \nThe second key impact is increased productivity, diversification, and value addition in the \n39. \nagriculture  sector  in  India\u2014reflected  in  higher  growth  rates,  particularly  for  basic  food  grains \ncritical for food security, and higher value-added produce. Increased equity participation and value \naddition  in  the  agribusiness  sector,  along  with  measures  to  increase  productivity,  will  create \nincome  and  employment  opportunities  at the  farm  level;  and facilitate  balanced,  inclusive,  and \nsustainable economic development in rural India. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n \n40.  Outcome. Fund II will achieve positive development and financial returns. It will create a \ntransmission mechanism to bring improved technology (like drought-resistant seeds), advanced \nresource  conservation  techniques  (like  micro-irrigation),  reduced  wastage  (through  agri- \ninfrastructure facilities like granaries and warehouses), and higher value addition (through primary \nprocessing activities in the dairy and oilseeds industries,) to the farm level. \n\n \nOutputs \n\n3. \n\n \n41. \nThe  core  output  of  ADB\u2019s  investment  will  be  the  establishment  of  Fund  II,  through  the \ncapital raised in the first and the subsequent close, and Fund II\u2019s investment in companies with \nbusiness and operations focused primarily on the Indian agribusiness sector. \n \nB. \n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n \n42. \nThe Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 has identified agriculture as one of the areas, for \nlinking  ADB  operations to  inclusive  growth,  and emphasized  that  continued  investments  in the \nsector will \"create jobs, promote economic opportunities, and reduce vulnerabilities by connecting \nthe poor to markets and increasing their access to social services and productive assets\". 12 This \nhas also been validated through independent valuations, which concluded that ADB\u2019s investments \nin this area had generated jobs, raised rural incomes, and reduced poverty. 13 \n \n43. \nthe key sectors to be supported by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department. \n \n\nThe country partnership strategy for India, 2013\u20132017 14 identifies agribusiness as one of \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n \nThe investment thesis of Fund II overlaps well with ADB\u2019s agriculture sector strategy, 15 in \n44. \nparticular with the expanded partnership with the private sector to attract more direct investments \nin productivity enhancement, agro-processing, agro-retailing, and other non-farm rural business. \n\n \n\n12  April 2014 Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific \n13 IED.  2010.

Other  issues  could  include  threats  to  plant  biodiversity, \nsusceptibility to pest attacks, occupational health concerns, and safety hazards. These impacts \nare expected to be site- and investment-specific, and will be avoided substantially by adhering to \nwell-established  and  accessible  international  practices  and  design  and  process  criteria,  which \nFund II will adopt. All of Fund II\u2019s portfolio companies are expected to be classified category B, \nand Fund II is classified category FI overall in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).  On  social  safeguards,  the  investment  is  classified  FI,  treated  as  category  C,  as  any \ninvestment  having  involuntary  resettlement  or  indigenous  peoples  impacts,  will  be  considered \nineligible for investment. \n \n47. \nFund  II  and  its  investees  will  establish  and  implement  an  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system (ESMS), commensurate with the impacts and risks of their operations. Fund \nII and its investees will comply with all applicable laws and standards on environment, health, and \nsafety aspects; and Fund II will not invest in any entity that is engaged in an activity named in \nADB\u2019s  Prohibited  Investment  Activities  List. 16 Fund  II\u2019s  ESMS  will  include  provisions  requiring \nFund  II  and  portfolio  companies  to  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and  to  take  measures  in \nrelation  to  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection Strategy. 17 The investment is categorized as having no gender elements. Since this is \na  follow-on  fund,  and  the  ESMS for  Fund  I  and its  investees  have  already  been  implemented, \nthere is high certainty that the fund manager will adhere to these requirements for Fund II. \n \nB. \n \n48. \nFund II, the sponsor, REAL, and REMCO were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing \nbest international practice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing \nof terrorism.
