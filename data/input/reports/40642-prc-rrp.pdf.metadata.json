An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nundertaken  for  each  of  the  investment  components  under  the \nProject.  The  summary  EIA  was  circulated  to  the  Board  of \nDirectors and uploaded on the website of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) on 14 August 2008. \n \nWuzhou  city  is  a  medium-sized  city  in  the  Guangxi  Zhuang \nAutonomous  Region.  Over  centuries,  Wuzhou  has  served  as  a \ngateway  city  and  regional  transportation  center  to  connect \nGuangxi  with  national  and  international  markets,  particularly \nthe  Government\u2019s \nthrough  river \nIn \ndevelopment  program,  Wuzhou  will  be  developed \ninto  a \nmultimode  regional \nthrough  domestically \nfunded ongoing transportation projects.  \n \nHowever,  geological  and  geographic  conditions  constrain  urban \ndevelopment  in  Wuzhou.  The  city  is  in  a  mountainous  region \ndivided into three parts by two big rivers. Because flat urban land \nis  lacking,  the  residents  tended  to  build  their  houses  in  the \nmarginal lands, which were gradually expanding up the mountains \nalong  slopes  of  major  valleys.  The  mountains  in  Wuzhou  are \nmainly  formed  by  loose  earth,  eroded  granite,  and  clastic  rocks. \nAs such, they are vulnerable to rain-triggered geological disasters \n(known  as  geohazards)  in  the  form  of  landslides,  slope  collapse, \nand mud and debris flows. Many of these valleys, though densely \npopulated, have been classified as geohazard-prone zones. \n \nWith support from the central Government, the Wuzhou municipal \ngovernment \nto \nstrengthen  the  control  of  geological  disasters,  mainly  by  building \nand  rehabilitating  of  the  slope  protections  and  retaining  walls. \nHowever, such traditional control measures have not always been \neconomical  and  optimal  solutions.  Under  severe  weather \nconditions,  these  slope  protections  and  retaining  walls  can  be \nwashed away together with houses and other buildings. \n \n\n(WMG)  has  made  enormous \n\ninvestments \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nto \n\nimprove \n\nThe  Guangxi  Wuzhou  Urban  Development  Project  will  adopt  a \nnew approach to address the geohazard concern of the city. The \nbasic principle of this new approach to geohazard management is \na shift from disaster rehabilitation to prevention. Under the Project, \ngeological  disasters  are  to  be  prevented  through  holistic  urban \nplanning  and  integrated  public  investment.  The  combination  of \nthese efforts will result in (i) carefully designed urban planning for \nlong-term  urban  expansion,  (ii)  relocation  of  the  people  living  in \nthe  geohazard-prone  valley  to  the  newly  developed  geohazard-\nfree urban area, (iii) engineering measures for geohazard control \nto convert the evacuated geohazard-prone valley into geohazard-\nfree  land  for  urban  redevelopment,  and  (iv)  stronger  geohazard \nthe \nforecasting  and  early  warning  capability \neffectiveness of the city\u2019s geohazard management system. \n \nWuzhou is a less developed, medium-sized city in western PRC. \nThe  Project  will  help  the  city  deal  with  geohazards\u2013a  major \ndevelopment  constraint\u2013and  help  free  thousands  of  people  from \nthe  threat  of  geological  disasters.  The  Project  will  introduce  an \ninnovative  approach \nin  urban \ndevelopment. The Project is expected to play a demonstration role \nfor  many  other  cities  facing  similar  geological  conditions  in  the \nPRC.  \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  sustained  urban  development  and \nbetter living standards for the people in Wuzhou. The outcome of \nthe  Project  is  a  reduction  in  the  geohazard  threat  to  the  life  and \nproperty  of  the  Wuzhou people  and in  the  geohazard  constraints \nto urban development. \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $263.3 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $4.9 million.  \n \n\nthe  geohazards \n\nto  address \n\nSource \n\n% of Total \n\nAmount \n($ million equivalent) \n100.0 \n82.5 \n80.9 \n263.3a \n\n38.0 \n31.3 \n30.7 \n100.0 \n\nAsian Development Bank \nWuzhou Municipal Government \nChina Construction Bank \n       Total \n \na Numbers may not add up due to rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n  \nA  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will \nbe  provided  under  its  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term including \na  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility for US dollar \nloans, a commitment charge, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\niii\n\nThe  ADB  loan  will  finance  38%  of  the  project  cost.  WMG  will \ncofinance  31.3%  of  the  Project  cost,  while  China  Construction \nBank will cofinance 30.7%. \n \nThe Government will relend loan proceeds to the Guangxi Zhuang \nAutonomous  Region  government,  which  will  then  onlend  the \nproceeds  to  WMG.  The  loan  will  be  relent  to  WMG  on  the  same \nterms and conditions as those of the ADB loan, with WMG bearing \nthe  foreign exchange  and  interest  rate  variation  risks  of  the  ADB \nloan. \n \nUntil 31 December 2014 \n \n30 June 2014 \n\nthe  WMG \n\n \nWuzhou municipal government \n \nWMG  has  established  a  project  leading  group,  chaired  by  the \nexecutive  vice  mayor,  to  direct  the  Project  and  provide  policy \nguidance during project implementation. Under the project leading \ngroup,  WMG  has  set  up  a  project  management  office  (PMO)  to \nundertake  and  coordinate  the  day-to-day  activities  in  connection \nwith  the  Project.  By  entering  into  an  undertaking  agreement, \nWMG  will  designate  Dongtai  State  Assets  Operations \nCorporation\u2014a  company  wholly  owned  by \nthat \nspecializes in urban construction\u2014to be the implementing agency. \nIt  will  carry  out  the  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  Project, \nincluding procuring goods and works under the Project. \n \nAll  procurement  of  goods  and  works  shall  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  International  competitive  bidding, \nnational competitive bidding, or shopping procedures will be used, \ndepending on the circumstances of each contract package. \n \nAbout  18  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and \n108  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  will  be \nprovided  under  the  Project  to  support  the  capacity  development \nfor  WMG  in  (i)  geohazard  management,  and  (ii)  institutional \nimplementation  and  management. \nstrengthening \nConsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nThe Project will directly benefit more than 486,000 urban residents \nof  Wuzhou  by  reducing  their  vulnerability  to  the  threat  of \ngeohazards,  and  by  addressing  the  geohazard  constraint  to \nsustainable  urban  development  of  the  city.  The  Project  has  two \ninvestment  components  and  one  capacity  development  and \ninstitutional  strengthening  component.  Under  the  investment \ncomponent  for  Pingminchong  valley  geohazard  resettlement  and \n\nfor  project \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nin \n\nfrom \n\nrelocated \n\nresidents  settling  down \n\nprevention, about 6,823 people or 1,816 households\u2014about 52% \nof  whom  are  low-income  families\u2014will  be  evacuated  from  the \ngeohazard-prone  valley  and \nin  a  well-equipped \nresettlement community newly constructed under the Project in a \ngeohazard-free  urban  area.  This  component  will  significantly \nimprove  the  quality  of  life  of  these  residents  by  eliminating  a \nlasting threat to their lives and property.  \n \nThe investment component for Hongling road network and related \ninfrastructure  will  help  Wuzhou  meet  its  short-  to  medium-term \nurban  expansion  needs,  which  are  induced  by  the  construction \nand  operation  of  domestically  funded  ongoing  transportation \nprojects  for  railway,  expressways,  and  river  transportation.  The \nroad  network  and  related  infrastructure,  once  completed,  will \nprovide the foundation for expanding the city into Hongling, a new \nurban  area  away \nthe  geohazard-prone  valleys.  As \nenvisaged, the urbanization of Hongling will (i) help the city meet \nits  urban  expansion  requirement  up  to  2020;  (ii)  accommodate \n100,000 \nthe  geohazard-free \ncommunities; and (iii) create thousands of new jobs, mainly in the \nservice sector.  \n \nThe  geohazard  forecasting  and  early  warning  system  to  be \nintroduced  and  established  under  the  capacity  development  and \ninstitutional  strengthening  component  will  provide  Wuzhou  with  a \nstronger  geohazard  management  system.  This  will  significantly \nenhance the city\u2019s capability to avoid geological disasters. \n \ntechnical  risks. \nThe  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual \nConventional engineering designs with proven records of reliable \nperformance  will  be  adopted  for  construction  of  the  resettlement \ncommunity  and  road  network,  and  for  installation  of  the  related \nmunicipal infrastructure along the roads.  \n \nThe  challenge  of  relocating  a  large  quantity  of  households  may \npose  a  risk  to  the  Project.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  detailed \nresettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  for  the  two  investment \ncomponents under the Project, strictly following ADB resettlement \nsafeguards  policy  and  participatory  consultation  procedures. \nSubstantial  consulting  inputs  have  been  included  in  the  capacity \ndevelopment and institutional strengthening component to provide \nguidance  and  technical  support  for  WMG.  This  will  help  ensure \nappropriate implementation of the resettlement plans following the \nADB resettlement safeguards policy requirements.  \n \nAnother  risk  might  arise  from  inappropriate  engineering  design \nand/or  irresponsible  engineering  treatment  for  the  geohazard \nprevention measures to be undertaken by the Project. WMG has \nassured  that  all  the  engineering  design  and  treatment  for \ngeohazard  prevention  measures  will  strictly  follow  the  national \ndesign  and  engineering  standards  for  geohazard  control  and \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nprevention  works.  The  capacity  development  and  institutional \nstrengthening component also includes the provision of expertise \nin geohazard engineering safety to provide guidance and stronger \nquality control.  \n \nCompared with the threat of geohazards to the life and property of \npeople  in  Wuzhou,  and  their  constraint  on  the  development \nopportunities of the city, the integrated benefits and impacts of the \nProject  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  The  identified  risks \nare manageable, given the mitigation measures provided. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f106  00'Eo\n\no\n111  00'E\n\nGUANGXI WUZHOU URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\nH U N A  N\n\n26  00'No\n\nG U I Z H O U\n\n26  00'No\n\nGuilin\n\nLipu\n\nG\n\nu\n\ni\nj\ni\n\na\n\nn\n\ng\n\n \n\nR\n\ni\nv\n\ne\n\nr\n\nXunjiang R.\n\nWuzhou\n\nXijiang River\n\nG U A N G D O N G\n\nBaise\n\nHechi\n\nYizhou\n\nLiuzhou\n\nG U A N G X I\n\nLitang\n\nNANNING\n\nFusui\n\nChongzuo\n\nGuigang\n\nYulin\n\nPingxiang\n\nNingming\n\nFangcheng\n\nDongxing\n\nVIET NAM\n\nQinzhou\n\nBeihai\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75 100 125\n\nY U N N A N\n\nN\n\nKilometers\n\nProject City\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Road\n\nProvincial Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\n22  00'No\n\n0\n8\n-\n3\n0\n9\n5\n \nH\nR\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nG u l f     o f     T o n k i n\n\nS o u t h    C h i n a    S e a\n\n106  00'Eo\n\no\n111  00'E\n\n22  00'No\n\nM\na\np\n \n1\n\n\fGUANGXI WUZHOU URBAN DEVELOPMENT OPROJECT\nProject Sites in Wuzhou\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\nOuter Ring Expressway\n\nProject Area\n\nProject Site\n\nMain Road\n\nOther Road\n\nRiver\n\nt\n\no\n\n \n\nG\nu\n\ni\n\nl\n\ni\n\nn\n\nPlanned Railway (Luoyang-Zhanjiang)\n\nWUZHOU\nINDUSTRIAL\nPARK\n\nr\ne\n\ng Riv\nuijia\n\nn\n\nG\n\nRailway\nStation\n\nHONGLING ROAD NETWORK\n\nChangzhou\nIsland\n\nZAOCHONG RESETTLEMENT COMMUNITY\n\nPINGMINCHONG\nGEOHAZARD RESETTLEMENT & PREVENTION\n\nto Guangdong\n\nXijiang River\n\nXunjiangRiver\n\nTANGYUANG\nINDUSTRIAL PARK\n\ng\n\nn i n\n\nn\n\nt o   N a\n\nCANGWU  DISTRICT\n\n0\n8\n-\n4\n9\n0\n9\n \nH\nR\n\nN\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nKilometers\n\nM\na\np\n \n2\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project. \n \n2. \nThe  Government  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  help  promote  the \nurban development of Wuzhou city in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region by addressing \none  major  development  constraint\u2014geohazards  in  the  form  of  landslide,  slope  collapse,  and \nmud  and  debris  flow.1 This  report  is  based  on  the  results  of  the  loan  processing  missions,  as \nwell as discussions with the central and local governments, relevant agencies, and community \norganizations.2 The design and monitoring framework of the Project is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nSince the PRC initiated economic reforms in 1978, sustained economic growth has been \n3. \naccompanied by rapid urbanization. The urban population increased from about 190 million or \n19.6%  of  total  population  in  1980  to  more  than  560  million  or  42.9%,  in  2005.  Through  the \nimplementation of the Five Year Plan (FYP) for 2006\u20132010, the PRC envisages a continuation \nof  this  urbanization  process  in  a  cautious  yet  steady  manner.3 The  aim  is  to  establish  a  more \nbalanced economic structure under an integrated market system comprising metropolitans, city \nclusters, and small and medium-sized cities to serve as the national or regional growth centers \nto  promote  sustained  development  across  the  country.  The  World  Bank  estimated  that \nurbanization  in  the  PRC  could  pass  the  60%  mark  by  2020,  with  200  million  or  more  rural \npeople  joining  the  urban  population. 4  The  rapid  urbanization  requires  continued  public \ninvestment  to  support  urban  expansion,  as  well  as  to  address  the  development  constraints \nfaced  by  the  cities  in  the  PRC.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC  2008\u20132010 \nidentifies direct support for sound and sustainable urban development as one major operational \nfocus. 5  It  emphasizes  resolving  constraints  to  sustained  urban  development  or  urban \nenvironmental improvement in the smaller cities, particularly those in the less developed interior \nprovinces and autonomous regions. \n \n4. \nAs a continental country with mountains and mountainous lands accounting for 65% of \nits  total  land  area,  the  PRC  is  one  of  the  most  vulnerable  countries  in  the  world  to  geological \ndisasters. During 1995\u20132005, geological disasters, on average, killed 1,108 people and caused \ndirect economic losses of CNY5.9 billion each year. All the provinces and autonomous regions \nare  affected  by  recurrent  geological  disasters,  most  commonly  landslides,  slope  collapse,  and \nmud and debris flow. Given the high concentration of human settlements and economic assets \n\n                                                 \n1   Geohazard  is  a  term  commonly  used  to  describe  many  different  geological  phenomena,  including  earthquakes, \nslope  collapse,  landslide,  and  mud  and  debris  flow.  In  the  PRC,  public  interventions  for  the  prevention  and \nrehabilitation  of  earthquake-induced  disasters  are  subject  to  a  set  of  specialized  laws  and  regulations.  In  this \nreport,  the  term  geohazard  covers  only  the  geological  phenomena  of  slope  collapse,  landslides,  and  mud  and \ndebris  flow,  which  are  the  most  common  geohazards  in  Wuzhou  and  many  other  cities  under  similar  geological \nconditions in the PRC.    \n\n2  The  Project  was  prepared  with  support  of  technical  assistance  approved  in  August  2007:  ADB.  2007.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nin  the  cities,  prevention  and  control  of  geohazards  is  a  special  concern  for  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment  in  the  PRC,  particularly  for  those  cities  in  the  mountainous  areas  of  the  less \ndeveloped western part of the country.  \n \nThe Government has formulated the 11th five-year program for prevention and control of \n5. \ngeohazard (FYP-PCG) for 2006\u20132010, which establishes the goals and principles for combating \ngeohazards  across  the country.6 Following  a  review  of  the  experiences and  lessons  from  past \npublic  interventions,  the  FYP-PCG  highlights  the  principle  of  the  \u201cprevention  first\u201d  and  the \nimportance  of  incorporating  the  geohazard  prevention  into  the  overall  development  process. \nLike many other cities in less-developed mountainous areas of the PRC, Wuzhou suffers from \npermanent  exposure  to  frequent  geohazards.  By  working  with  ADB  on  the  Project,  the \nGovernment  is  seeking  knowledge  input  and  financial  support  to  address  one  common \nconstraint to sustained urban development. The Project, which is designed in line with the FYP-\nPCG, is expected to play a demonstration role for other cities under similar geological conditions \nin the PRC.  \n  \nWuzhou  is  a  medium-sized  city  in  the  eastern  part  of  Guangxi,  one  of  the  12  less-\n6. \ndeveloped western provinces and autonomous regions that the Government is supporting under \nthe  National  Strategy  for  Development  of  the  West  (NSDW).  The  Wuzhou  municipal \ngovernment  (WMG)  has  three  urban  districts,  three  rural  counties,  and  one  county  and/or  city \nunder its jurisdiction, covering a total of 12,588 square kilometers (km2) and with a population of \n3.11  million.  For  this  Project,  Wuzhou  refers  to  the  city  proper,  comprising  the  three  urban \ndistricts  only.  Wuzhou has  an  urban  population  of  486,000  and  a  developed  urban  area  of  50 \nkm2. The city is at the intersection of two major rivers\u2014Xunjiang River and Guijiang River, which \nare then merged into Xijiang River\u2014the upstream section of Zhujiang River (i.e., Pearl River) for \nthe Pearl River Delta\u2014one major growth engine of the PRC. Wuzhou has existed for more than \n2,000  years.  Over  centuries,  Wuzhou  has  served  as  a  gateway  city  and  a  regional \ntransportation hub connecting Guangxi with the national and international markets, particularly \nthrough river transportation.  \n \n7. \nWith  support  from  the  Government  under  the  NSDW,  Wuzhou  has  developed  rapidly, \nmainly by strengthening its economic integration with the Pearl River Delta. From 2000 to 2005, \nWuzhou\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew on average 11.3% per year, compared with the \nnational average of 9.5%. The urban population of Wuzhou increased from 373,700 to 486,000, \nin that period, accompanied by an average increase in urban per capita disposable income of \n10.9% per year, compared with the national average of 10.6%.  \n \n8. \nThe  11th  FYP  for  2006\u20132010  envisages  Wuzhou  developing  further  into  a  regional \nmultimode  transportation  center  to  connect  Guangxi  with  the  Pearl  River  Delta  through  six \nongoing  domestically  funded  major  transport  projects:  three  expressway  projects,  two  railway \nprojects, and one river transport strengthening project. A significant urban expansion is required \nto accommodate these new infrastructure facilities, as well as to support their operations. The \nWuzhou  City  Development  Master  Plan  (2000\u20132020),  approved  by  the  Wuzhou  People\u2019s \nCongress,  envisages  the  city  to  have  a  developed  urban  area  of  80  km2  and  an  urban \npopulation  of  800,000  by  2020.  A  strategic  analysis  of  the  challenges  and  opportunities  for \nurban development in Wuzhou is in Appendix 2. \n \n\n                                                 \n6  Ministry of Land and Resources. 2007. 11th Five Year Program for Prevention and Control of Geohazard. Beijing. \n\n\fB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n9. \nBackground.  Geological  and  geographic  conditions  severely  constrain  urban \ndevelopment in Wuzhou. The city is in a mountainous region divided into three parts by two big \nrivers.  The  city  proper  is  on  the  north  bank  of  the  Xunjiang  River,  which  is  further  divided  by \nGuijiang River into the old urban center on the east side and a fast-growing new urban center \non  the  west  side.  The  south  bank  of  Xunjiang  and/or  Xijiang  River7 has  not  been  developed. \nBefore  the  development  of  the  new  urban  area  on  the  west  side  of  the  Guijiang  River  in  the \n1980s,  flat  land  available  around  the  old  urban  center  was  limited.  As  a  result,  the  residents \ntended  to  build  their  houses  in  the  marginal  lands,  which  were  gradually  expanding  up  the \nmountains along slopes of major valleys. The mountains in Wuzhou are mainly formed by loose \nearth, eroded granite, and clastic rocks. As such, they are vulnerable to rain-triggered geological \ndisasters  in  the  form  of  landslides,  slope  collapse,  and  mud  and  debris  flows.  Many  of  these \nvalleys, though densely populated, have been classified as geohazard-prone zones.  \n \n10.  With  support  from  the  central  Government  and  autonomous  region  government,  the \nWMG  has  made  enormous  investments  to  strengthen  the  control  of  geological  disasters  over \nthe past 50 years. Numerous engineering control projects have been implemented to stabilize \nthe  mountain  slopes  by  building  and  rehabilitating  the  slope  protections  and  retaining  walls. \nThese  measures  have  played  an  important  role  in  combating  geohazards.  However,  such \ntraditional  control  and  prevention  measures,  particularly  the  repeated  building  of  the  slope \nprotections  and  retaining  walls,  have  not  always  been  economical  and  optimal  solutions. \nDespite the existence of concrete retaining walls, people living in the geohazard-prone valleys \nremain vulnerable to landslides. Under severe weather conditions, these slope protections and \nretaining walls can be washed away together with houses and other buildings. On 8 June 2006, \na strong rainstorm hit Wuzhou, which triggered 181 landslides, 48 slope collapses, and 64 mud \nand debris flows. The geological disaster killed 12 people, wounded 26, and affected 21,673. It \nalso caused extensive damage to the city, including destroying 825 residential buildings with an \nestimated  direct  economic  loss  of  CNY30  million.  To  strengthen  urban  sustainability  and  to \nprovide the people with safe and more secure living conditions, Wuzhou needs to adopt a new \napproach to combat geohazards more effectively.  \n \nBased  on  the  experience  and  lessons  from  the  past,  and  taking  into  account \n11. \ninternational best practice, the WMG will adopt a new approach under the Project to combating \nthe  geohazard  concerns  of  the  city.  The  basic  principle  of  the  new  approach  to  geohazard \nmanagement  is  a  shift  from  disaster  rehabilitation  to  prevention.  Under  the  Project,  geological \nintegrated  public \ndisasters  are \ninterventions. The combination of these efforts will result in (i) carefully designed urban planning \nfor long-term urban expansion, (ii) relocation of the people living in the geohazard-prone zone to \nthe  newly  developed  geohazard-free  urban  area,  (iii)  engineering  measures  for  geohazard \ncontrol  to  convert  the  evacuated  geohazard-prone  valley  into  a  geohazard-free  land  for  urban \nredevelopment, and (iv) stronger geohazard forecasting and early warning capability to improve \nthe effectiveness of the city\u2019s geohazard management system.  \n \nRationale.  Wuzhou  is  a  less-developed,  medium-sized  city  in  western  PRC.  The  city \n12. \nhas reached a critical stage of urban development as it grows into a multimodal transportation \ncenter  to  further  strengthen  the  economic  integration  of  Guangxi  and  its  neighboring  western \nprovinces  with  the  Pearl  River  Delta.  The  Project  will  help  WMG  address  geohazards\u2014one \n\nthrough  holistic  urban  planning  and \n\nto  be  prevented \n\n                                                 \n7  The upper stream of the Xijiang River is called the Xunjiang before it meets the Guijiang River at the intersection in \n\nWuzhou. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fmajor development constraint\u2014and help free thousands of people from the threat of geological \ndisasters. The Project is consistent with the ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for PRC, which \nspecifies that ADB will directly support sound and sustainable urban development with a focus \non relatively underdeveloped areas in western and northeastern PRC (footnote 5). Furthermore, \nthe  Project  will  introduce  an  innovative  approach  to  addressing  geohazards.  It  is  expected  to \nplay a demonstration role for many other cities facing similar geological conditions in the less- \ndeveloped western part of the PRC.  \n \nPolicy  Dialogue. One increasingly challenging task related to the rapid urbanization in \n13. \nthe  PRC  is  satisfying  the  need  for  urban  expansion  need  through  properly  designed  land  use \nmanagement,  and  well-compensated  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  arrangements.  In  line \nwith the principle of achieving a harmonious society set forth for the 11th FYP, the Government \nhas  introduced  many  new  policy  initiatives  to  strengthen  land  use  management  and  to  assist \nlocal  governments  in  improving  their  management  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  As \nWuzhou is a fast-growing city, the WMG has gained rich experience in handling land acquisition \nand  resettlement  for  urban  expansion  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  national  laws  and \nregulations. In Guangxi, Wuzhou is regarded as a city of best practice for land acquisition and \nresettlement.  The  Project  has  provided  WMG  with  a  good  opportunity  to  learn  from  ADB  the \nresettlement safeguard policies and requirements to further improve their work.  \n \nThe Project has two investment components, both involving relocation of people. Under \n14. \none component, the Project beneficiaries are to be moved out of a geohazard-prone valley and \nrelocated  in  a  geohazard-free  new  resettlement  community.  Under  the  other  component, \nproject-affected  persons  are  to  be  relocated  because  of  the  construction  of  the  road  network \nand  related  infrastructure  to  promote  the  urban  expansion  into  the  geohazard-free  area.  The \nWMG,  recognizing  that  appropriate  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  the  key  to  project \nsuccess,  agreed  that  all  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  under  the  Project\u2014including  the \nrelocation  of \nInvoluntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995).  Furthermore,  the  resettlement  plan  prepared  for  the  road  network \nconstruction  will  establish \nthe  same  resettlement  principles,  compensation  standards, \nconsultation procedures, and implementation plan for the lands and resettlements required for \nroad  network  construction  and  the  neighboring  urban  lands  to  be  developed  with  the  road \nnetwork.  \n \n15. \nDuring  loan  processing,  ADB  and  WMG  conducted  a  continual  and  extensive  dialogue \non urban development strategy for Wuzhou, focusing on prioritizing and sequencing the planned \nurban development activities in accordance with the urban expansion needs of the city and the \nfinancing capability of WMG. Through a joint review of the urban development momentum, as \nwell as an in-depth assessment of economic and financial viability of the Project, WMG agreed \nto  divide  the  proposed  urban  expansion  plan  into  two  phases.  The  first  phase  will  prioritize \nsupport  for  the  city  expansion  into  a  geohazard-free  area  on  the  northern  bank  of  Xunjiang \nRiver. Urban expansion is continuing in this area because of the construction and operation of \nkey  transport  infrastructure,  such  as  the  long  distance  bus  terminal  and  the  railway  station. \nDevelopment of the southern bank of the Xunjiang River, including building a new bridge across \nthe river and constructing the road network and related municipal infrastructure, could be started \nin  the  second  phase,  after  adequate  development  of  the  northern  bank.  Instead  of  spreading \nlimited financial resources across all the planned urban development activities, the Project has \nincluded  only  the  highest  priority  development  activities  planned  for  the  city.  Through  such \ndialogue,  the  WMG  has  managed  to  plan  the  urban  development  through  a  well-coordinated \nsequence  of  phases,  and  keep  the  capital  investment,  physical  construction,  environmental \n\nthe  project  beneficiaries\u2014should  conform  strictly \n\nto  ADB\u2019s \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fthrough \n\nimpact, and land acquisition and resettlement requirement of the Project within its financing and \nproject management capability.  \n \n16. \nThrough  decades  of  combating  geological  disasters,  Wuzhou  has  developed  an \ninstitutionalized  geohazard  management  system  comprising  the  leadership  of  the  WMG,  the \ngeohazard emergency center of WMG, the meteorological station, district governments, and the \ncommunities and households in the geohazard-prone valleys. During the rainy season, almost \nall  slopes  in  the  geohazard-prone  zone  are  closely  monitored  by  designated  households  or \nindividuals through a community-based geohazard monitoring and alarming system. The system \nhas been effective in responding to emergencies. However, one shortcoming of the system is its \nlack  of  geohazard  forecasting  and  early  warning  capability.  Most  of  the  geohazard  events  are \ndetected  through  mass  observations  conducted  by  communities  and  households  alerted  by \nmeteorological forecast and mobilized by rainfalls. On the advice of ADB, the WMG agreed to \nadd  one  new  component  to  the  Project\u2014the  introduction  and  establishment  of  a  geohazard \nforecasting and  early  warning  system  to  strengthen  the  geohazard  management  of  the  city.  A \nmore detailed assessment of geohazard management in Wuzhou is in Appendix 3. \n \n17. \nExternal Assistance. ADB has supported urban development in the PRC (Appendix 4). \nIn support of the NSDW of the Government, ADB has also provided development assistance for \nGuangxi,  particularly \ntransport  and  urban \ndevelopment.8 The  Project  will  be  the  first  urban  development  project  prepared  with  support \nfrom  a  multilateral  development  bank  in  Wuzhou.  The  WMG  appreciated  the  international \nknowledge  and  experiences  that  ADB  brought  in  the  fields  of  urban  planning,  geohazard \nmanagement,  and  project  design  and  management  in  addition  to  the  financial  support  to  be \nprovided for the Project. \n \n18. \nLessons.  ADB-financed  urban  development  and  urban  environmental  improvement \nprojects  in  the  PRC  generally  perform  well.  Urban  development  requires  an  integrated  and \nmultisector  approach.  In  the  PRC,  urban  development  activities  in  a  city  are  guided  by  a \ncomprehensive city development master plan prepared for a time frame of 15\u201320 years, which \nis updated from time to time as appropriate. Guided by such a city master plan, holistic urban \nplanning and integrated public investment may be effective instruments in strengthening urban \nsustainability, improving human settlement, and improving urban environment. However, within \nan  approved  city  master  plan,  development  activities  still  need  to  be  carefully  prioritized  and \nsequenced in view of development momentum of the city, as well as the financing and project \nmanagement  capability  of  the  city  government.  Policy  dialogue  during  loan  processing  has \nallowed for a continual optimization of the urban development program for Wuzhou to maximize \nits development impact.  \n \n19. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  a  challenge  to  many  urban  development  projects \nthat may affect loan processing and implementation. Lessons from urban development projects \nin  the  PRC  indicate  that  ADB\u2019s  resettlement  safeguard  policy  and  operational  requirements \nshould be introduced as a sample of international good practice to help the concerned municipal \n\ninvestment  projects \n\nlending \n\nfor \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB.  2001.

This approach has facilitated a candid and constructive policy \ndialogue  with  WMG  in  preparing  the  resettlement  plan  for  the  Project  in  line  with  the  \u201cpeople-\ncentered\u201d  principle  advocated  by  the  Government  and  in  conformity  with  ADB  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy.    \n \n20. \nADB evaluation studies have highlighted relevant lessons for loan processing including \nthe  need  to  (i)  encourage  broad  reforms,  (ii)  ensure  counterpart  funding  for  operation  and \nmaintenance, (iii) consult the public and involved community in project design, (iv) address the \nresettlement  issues  at  the  early  stage  of  processing,  and  (v)  avoid  start-up  delays.  These \nlessons have been considered in policy dialogue with the Government and the WMG, and are \nincorporated in the design of the proposed Project.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n21. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  sustained  urban  development  and  higher  living \nstandards in Wuzhou. The impact will be measured by the achievement of sustained economic \ngrowth in the city, sustained growth of per capita income of city residents, steady urbanization, \nless vulnerability of the city to geohazards, and more effective geohazard management system. \nThe  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  a  reduction  in  the  geohazard  threat  to  life  and  property  of \npeople  living  in  Wuzhou,  and  a  reduction  in  the  geohazard  constraint  on  urban  development. \nThe outcome will be measured by fewer households living in the geohazard-prone zone, more \ngeohazard-free  lands  for  urban  development,  more  urban  road  and  municipal  infrastructure \nfacilities, and stronger geohazard forecasting and early warning capability.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe Project will have three major components generating the following outputs: \n\n22. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nPingminchong  valley  geohazard  resettlement  and  prevention.  This \ncomponent  will  involve  (a)  building  a  resettlement  community  in  Zaochong\u2014a \ngeohazard-free  urban  area,  to  be  equipped  with  quality  housing  and  municipal \ninfrastructure  to  accommodate  about  6,823  people  or  1,816  households  to  be \nevacuated  from  the  geohazard-prone  Pingminchong  valley;  and  (b)  undertaking \nthe  evacuated \ngeohazard-control  engineering  measures \nPingminchong  valley  into  geohazard-free  lands  with  a  total  area  of  about  20 \nhectares (ha) for urban redevelopment. \n\nconvert \n\nto \n\nHongling road network and related infrastructure. This component will entail \nbuilding  a  comprehensive  36.2-kilometer  urban  road  network  together  with  the \nrelated  municipal  infrastructure,  including  drainage  pipelines,  sewers,  public \ngreen areas, lighting, and traffic management facilities, to promote and facilitate \nthe  urban  expansion  into  the  geohazard-free  Hongling\u2014a  new  urban  area  of \nabout  540  ha  on  the  northern  bank  of  Xunjiang  between  the  newly  constructed \nrailway station and the fully developed urban area. \n\n(iii) \n\nCapacity development and institutional building. This component will involve \n(a)  developing  and  establishing  a  geographic  forecasting  and  early  warning \nsystem  that  is  compatible  with  a  geographic  information  system  (GIS)  to \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\ftraining \n\nrelevant \n\nincluding \n\nstrengthen  the  geohazard  management  of  the  city,  and  (b)  providing  technical \nsupport, \nin  urban  planning  and  geohazard \nmanagement  for  the  WMG  and  the  project  implementing  agency  to  strengthen \ntheir  capacity  to  meet  the  operational  requirements  of  the  Project  during \nimplementation.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  provide  specialized  consulting \nservices under this component to improve public awareness of geohazards and \ngeohazard  management  through  the  existing  community-based  geohazard \nmonitoring and alarming system. \n\n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n23. \nInnovative  Approach  to  Geohazard  Prevention.  The  traditional  mechanism  for \ngeohazard  management  relies  entirely  on  budget  support  from  the  central  and  local \ngovernments.  It  does  not  have  any  self-financing  capability.  The  Government\u2019s  long  lasting \nfinancial  constraints  have  limited  public  interventions  only  to  emergency  response  and  post-\ndisaster  rehabilitation  by  providing  assistance  for  disaster  relief  and  rehabilitation  of  the \ndamaged  retaining  walls.  The  budgetary  resources  available  determined  and  constrained  the \nlevel of rehabilitation and protection. Under the Project, a new mechanism will be introduced to \nshift geohazard management from disaster rehabilitation to disaster avoidance and prevention, \nand to introduce a self-financing element into geohazard management through integrated urban \nplanning and well coordinated urban development. \n \n24. \nUnder the Pingminchong component, people living in this geohazard-prone valley will be \nevacuated  and  relocated  to  a  newly  built  resettlement  community  in  a  geohazard-free  urban \narea,  freeing  them  from  geohazard threat.  In  the  evacuated  Pingminchong  valley,  engineering \nmeasures  will  include  (i)  cutting  the  mountain  slopes  to  a  degree  that  is  safe  and  free  of \nlandslidea, (ii) filling up the valley into carefully designed terraces, and (iii) installing an effective \ndrainage system to divert the storm water and protect the treated terraces from erosion. These \nengineering measures will convert the geohazard-prone Pingminchong valley into a geohazard-\nfree land. The WMG will then auction off the treated land for urban redevelopment. The WMG \nplans  to  use  the  revenue  from  the  sale,  after  deduction  of  the  costs  for  geohazard  control \ntreatment, to set up a revolving mechanism to finance future geohazard control and prevention \nprojects of the other geohazard-prone valleys in the city. In this connection, a special study was \nconducted  on  the  land  market  in  Wuzhou,  which  confirmed  that  all  the  land  transactions  for \nurban  development  in  Wuzhou  since  2003  have  been  conducted  through  transparent  market \noperations  in  the  form  of  a  tender,  auction,  or  public  listing.  Land  reforms  in  PRC,  particularly \nthe  strengthening  of  the  legal  framework  for  land  transactions,  have  provided  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  the  proposed  revolving  financing  mechanism.9 A  detailed  analysis  of  the  land \nmarket for urban development in Wuzhou is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \nThe  revolving  financing  mechanism  attempts  to  incorporate  geohazard  prevention  into \n25. \noverall  urban  development  through  holistic  urban  planning  and  integrated  public  investments. \nThis  approach  is  expected  to  prevent  disasters,  improve  human  settlements,  and  redevelop \nurban areas. This approach would not be possible without sizeable lending support from ADB to \ncomplement  the  WMG  investment  to  first  build  a  well-serviced  resettlement  community  to \nreceive the relocated households from the geohazard-threatened Pingminchong valley. \n \n\n                                                 \n9   The  legal  framework  for  land  market  development  in  the  PRC  has  evolved  over  the  past  20  years.  It  includes, \namong other things, the Amendment to the Constitution (1988), Enactment of the Property Rights Law (2007), and \nIssuance of the Decree on Transfer of Construction Land Use Rights through Tender, Auction and Listing (2007).  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGeohazard  Forecasting  and  Early  Warning  System.  Based  on  an  existing \n26. \ncomputerized  GIS  for  land  resources  management  in  Wuzhou,  and  taking  into  account \ninternational  best  practice,  the  Project  will  help  WMG  (i)  use  information  and  communication \ntechnology  to  establish  a  centralized  GIS-compatible,  real-time  monitoring  and  reporting \nnetwork  to  supplement  the  existing  community-based  mass  observation  mechanism  for  the \ngeohazard-prone  zones  of  the  city;  (ii)  develop  a  computer-based  dynamic  geohazard \nsimulation  and  forecasting  model,  based  on  meteorological  data  and  geohazard  monitoring \ndata, to provide technical support for early warning service against geohazards; and (iii) provide \nan integrated decision-making system for geohazard monitoring, early warning, and emergency \nresponse to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the geohazard management system of \nthe  city.  This  will  be  one  of  the  first  such  systems  to  be  introduced  to  strengthen  urban \ngeohazard management in the PRC.   \n \nD. \n \n27. \nTable 1 provides a summary of the project investment plan.  \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $263.3 million, including taxes and duties of $4.9 million. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n\n \nBase Costb \nI. \nII. \n\nPingminchong geohazard resettlement and prevention \nHongling road network and related infrastructure \nCapacity development, project management and implementation \nconsulting services \n \nSubtotal \n\n \n\n \n \n\nIII. \n \n \n\nB. \n\nContingenciesc \n\nAmounta\n\n53.4\n154.2\n2.0\n\n209.6\n\n25.9\n\n \n\nTotale \n\nFinancing Charges During Implementationd \n \n \n\nC. \n \n \na    Includes taxes and duties of $4.95 million. \nb \nc   Physical contingencies are computed at 5% for civil works.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility for US dollar loans, a commitment charge, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The Government \nhas  provided  ADB  with (i)  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on \nthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f \n29. \nThe ADB loan will finance 38% of the project cost, including the base cost, the financing \ncharges  during  implementation,  and  the  taxes  and  duties  associated  with  the  project \nexpenditures. 10  As  discussed  and  agreed  with  the  Government,  for  the  subcomponent  of \nconstruct  the  resettlement  community  in  Zaochong  (para.  22),  the  ADB  loan  will  be  used  to \nfinance  the  construction  of  basic  public  infrastructure  only,  including  site  preparation,  roads, \nwater  supply  and  sewage  pipelines.  Domestic  counterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  finance  the \nconstruction  of  the  housing  facilities.  The  WMG  has  obtained  a  commitment  from  China \nConstruction Bank (CCB) to provide a loan of $80.9 million to finance 30.7% of the project cost. \nThe  CCB  loan  will  have  a  term  of  10  years,  including  a  grace  period  equivalent  to  the \nimplementation  period  of  the  Project;  it  will  be  provided  in  the  national  currency  at  an  interest \nrate  of  7.83%  per  year.  The  WMG  has  provided  a  commitment  letter  to  confirm  (i)  timely \nprovision of adequate counterpart funds totaling $82.5 million, or 31.3% of the project cost; and \n(ii)  provision  of  additional  counterpart  funding  to  cover  any  funding  shortfalls  that  may  occur \nduring  project  implementation.  The  financing  plan  is  summarized  in  Table  2.  Detailed  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 5. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nWuzhou Municipal Government \nChina Construction Bank \n       Total \na Numbers may not add up due to rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n30. \nThe Borrower is the PRC. The Government will relend the loan proceeds to the Guangxi \nZhuang  Autonomous  Region  government  (GZARG),  which  in  turn  will  onlend  the  proceeds  to \nthe WMG. The loan will be onlent to the WMG on the same terms and conditions as those of the \nADB loan, with the WMG bearing the foreign exchange and interest rate risks of the ADB loan. \nThe chart for flow of funds through relending arrangements within the government system is in \nAppendix 6.  \n\n% \n38.0 \n31.3 \n30.7 \n100.0 \n\nTotala \n100.0 \n82.5 \n80.9 \n263.3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n31. \nThe  WMG  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  A  project  leading  group  headed  by  the \nexecutive  vice-mayor  has  been  established  to  provide  overall  guidance  and  support  for  the \npreparation and implementation of the Project. Under the project leading group, the WMG has \nestablished  a  project  management  office  (PMO)  to  undertake  and  coordinate  the  day-to-day \nactivities  of  the  Project.  By  entering  into  an  undertaking  agreement,  the  WMG  will  designate \nDongtai  State  Assets  Operations  Corporation\u2014a  company  wholly  owned  by  the  WMG  that \nspecializes in urban construction\u2014as the implementing agency (IA) to carry out the day-to-day \nimplementation  of  the  Project,  including  procuring  goods  and  works  under  the  Project.  The \nundertaking agreement will include the requirements and obligations in the Loan Agreement and \nProject  Agreement  applicable  to  the  IA.  The  chart  for  implementation  arrangements  is  in \nAppendix 7. \n\n                                                 \n10  Project-associated taxes and duties are estimated at $4.95 million, or about 1.9% of the total cost, which are not \n\nexcessively high yet a material part of the project costs.  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n32. \ndetailed implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nThe Project will be implemented over about 5 years from March 2009 to June 2014. The \n\nThe  procurement  of  goods  and  works  financed  under  the  loan  will  be  carried  out  in \n33. \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nContracts  for  goods  estimated  to  exceed  $1.0  million  and  contracts  for  works  estimated  to \nexceed $10.0 million will be procured using international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. \nContracts for goods and for works estimated to cost the same or less than the ICB values, but \nmore  than  $100,000  will  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures,  in \naccordance  with  the  PRC  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  (1999),  subject  to  modifications  agreed \nupon  with  ADB.  Contracts  for  goods  and  works  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less  will  be \nprocured  using  shopping  procedures.  For  contracts  to  be  procured  through  ICB  procedures, \nprocurement  documents  including  invitations  for  bids,  invitations  for  prequalification,  draft \nprequalification  documents,  draft  bidding  documents,  and  prequalification  and  bid  evaluation \nreports, are to be submitted to ADB for prior review and approval. For contracts to be procured \nthrough NCB procedures, the first draft English language version of the procurement documents \nshould be submitted for ADB review and approval regardless of the estimated contract amount. \nThe  ADB-approved  procurement  documents  should  then  be  used  as  a  model  for  all  NCB \nprocurement financed by ADB for the Project, and need not be reviewed further. ADB will review \nthe  bid  evaluation  report  and  award  of  contract  on  a  post-review  basis.  For  contracts  to  be \nprocured using shopping procedures, ADB will review the award of contracts on a post-review \nbasis. The procurement plan for the Project is in Appendix 9.  \n \nA  procurement  capacity  assessment  of  Dongtai  confirmed  that  the  IA  is  generally \n34. \ncapable  of  conducting  the  procurement  for  the  Project.  However,  it  will  need  training  and \ntechnical  support  to  understand  and  become  familiar  with  ADB  policy  and  procedural \nrequirements set out in ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The details of the capacity assessment \nare provided as part of the financial analysis appendix (Appendix 13). \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nThe  Project  will  fund  18  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  108 \n35. \nperson-months of national consulting services to support the capacity development of the WMG \nin (i) geohazard management, and (ii) institutional strengthening for project implementation and \nmanagement.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  one  consulting  firm  to  be  selected  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime),  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  at  the  quality-to-cost  ratio  of  80:20 \nwith  full  technical  proposal  procedures.  Consulting  services  are  required  for  (i)  designing  and \ndeveloping  a  GIS-compatible  geohazard  forecasting  and  early  warning  system;  (ii)  providing \nproject implementation and management support for  PMO and IA; and (iii) conducting training \nfor capacity development of the WMG, particularly in urban development, project management, \nand  geohazard  management.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consulting  services  is  in \nAppendix 10. \n \n\n \n\n\f5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n36. \nTo expedite project implementation, the WMG has requested for advance contracting for \nthe recruitment of consulting services, as well as for the procurement of goods and civil works. It \nalso  asked  for  retroactive  financing  to  cover  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $20  million, \nwhich equals 20% of the loan amount, incurred before loan effectiveness, but not earlier than 12 \nmonths before the signing of the Loan Agreement. All advance contracting will be undertaken in \nconformity  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  or  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  ADB \nmust  approve  the  issuance  of  invitations  to  bid  or  to  prequalify  under  advance  contracting. \nContracts  proposed  for  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines.  The  Government,  GZARG,  and  WMG  have  been  advised  that \napproval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n  \n\n6. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n37. \nwith  the  Government,  GZARG,  WMG,  and  the  IA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  loan  covenants  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the GZARG, WMG, and the IA, and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. For \nthe Project, the GZARG and WMG will undertake the following anticorruption actions: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nto  involve  the  agencies  responsible  for  oversight  of  the  IA  in  bidding  and \nconstruction to enhance construction quality control and supervise effective work; \nto  introduce  a  dual-signing  system  in  which  the  civil  works  contract  winner  also \nsigns an anticorruption contract with the employer; \nto  periodically  inspect  the  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and \nsettlements; \nto  engage  a  project  management  consultant  to  support  the  PMO  and  the  IA  to \nensure  good  governance,  accountability,  and \nin  project \nimplementation;  \nto  consult  with  the  concerned  central  Government  agencies  to  update  the  local \nlaws  and  regulations  on  local  and  corporate  governance  and  anticorruption \nmeasures; and  \nto disclose the information on contract awards on the project website of the WMG \nand in the audit report on the financial statements and project accounts following \nthe relevant laws and regulations of PRC. \n\ntransparency \n\n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n38. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the procedures set out in ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate  project \nimplementation  through  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds,  GZARG  will  establish  an  imprest \naccount  promptly  after  loan  effectiveness  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \nFinance  Bureau  of  the  GZARG  will  administer  the  imprest  account.  The  initial  amount  to  be \ndeposited in the imprest account will not exceed the estimated expenditures for the succeeding \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f6 months to be funded from the imprest account, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. \nTo  expedite  flow  of  funds  and  simplify  the  documentation  process,  the  ADB  statement-of-\nexpenditure  procedure  will  be  used  for  liquidation  and  replenishment  of  the  imprest  account, \nand for reimbursement of eligible expenditures not exceeding $200,000 per individual payment. \nThe payments in excess of the statement-of-expenditure ceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, \nor  replenished  based  on  full  supporting  documentation.  The  civil  works  contracts  under  the \nProject will be paid using direct payment procedures for such expenditures. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n39. \nAs  the  IA,  Dongtai  will  keep  records  to  allow  the  identification  of  goods  and  services \nfinanced from the loan proceeds, following accounting principles and practices prescribed by the \nPRC  Accounting  Law.  The  law  requires  financial  statements  to  be  prepared  following \ninternationally  recognized  accounting  standards.  Dongtai  will  set  up  and  maintain  separate \nproject accounts and records. The financial statements of the project accounts and the annual \ncorporate financial statement for Dongtai will be subject to external audit by the Wuzhou Audit \nBureau, the Guangxi Audit Bureau, and the State Audit Administration. The audits will be carried \nout in accordance with the audit regulations of the PRC, and will meet ADB requirements. The \naudit reports should include a separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest account and \nstatement  of  expenditures.  Dongati\u2019s  annual  audited  financial  statements  and  audited  project \naccounts  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  no  later  than  6  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year \nthroughout the implementation period.  \n \n40. \nThe WMG and Dongtai will submit reports and information to ADB concerning the use of \nthe  loan  proceeds,  project  implementation,  and  IA  performance.  These  reports  will  include  (i) \nquarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation;  (ii)  annual  reports;  and  (iii)  a  project \ncompletion report, which should be submitted not later than 3 months after the completion of the \nproject  facilities.  Through  the  preparation  and  submission  of  quarterly  progress  reports,  the \nPMO  will  report  the  progress  made,  problems  encountered  during  the  period  under  review, \nsteps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, the proposed program for the planned project \nimplementation activities, and progress expected in the following 6 months.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n41. \nThe  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  indicators,  their  relevance,  and \nmonitoring  practicalities  have  been  discussed  with  WMG  and  Dongtai  during  project \npreparation.  The  impact  indicators,  as  specified  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework,  will \ninclude  (i)  GDP  growth,  (ii)  urban  population  and  per  capita  income,  (iii)  proportion  of  urban \nresidents  living  in  geohazard-prone  areas,  and  (iv)  availability  and  reliability  of  the  geohazard \nforecasting  and  early  warning  services.  At  the  start  of  project  implementation,  the  PMO  and \nDongtai,  with  support  from  the  project  implementation  consultant,  will  develop  comprehensive \nPPMS  procedures  to  generate  data  systematically  on  project  outcome,  inputs  and  outputs  of \neach component, as well as the agreed-upon employment indicators, environmental monitoring \nindicators, and resettlement plan implementation indicators. These will be used to measure the \nproject impact, outcome, output, and compliance with ADB safeguard policy requirements. The \nPMO  will  (i)  refine  the  PPMS  framework,  (ii)  establish  the  baseline,  (iii)  confirm  achievable \ntargets, (iv) finalize the monitoring and recording arrangements, and (v) establish data collection \nsystems and reporting procedures no later than 6 months after loan effectiveness. In the design \nand  development  of  the  PPMS  framework,  special  attention  will  be  paid  to  the  demonstration \neffect  of  the  Project,  which  should  enable  systematic  data  collection  and  analysis  for \ndissemination of the lessons and experiences to cities beyond Wuzhou. \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n42. \nADB and the Government will review project implementation jointly at least once a year. \nIn addition, ADB and the Government will undertake a comprehensive midterm review 2 years \nafter the start of project implementation. This midterm review will include a detailed evaluation of \nthe scope, implementation arrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and \nprogress on the agenda for policy reform and capacity development measures. Feedback from \nthe PPMS activities will be analyzed. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n43. \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  more  than  486,000  urban  residents  of  Wuzhou  by \nreducing  their  vulnerability  to  geohazard,  and  by  addressing  the  geohazard  constraint  to \nsustainable  urban  development  of  the  city.  Under  the  Pingminchong  component,  about  6,823 \npeople  or  1,816  households,  about  52%  of  whom  are  low-income  families,  will  be  evacuated \nfrom the geohazard-prone valley and relocated in a well-serviced resettlement community newly \nconstructed under the Project in a geohazard-free urban area. This component will significantly \nimprove  the  quality  of  life  of  these  residents  by  eliminating  a  lasting  threat  to  their  life  and \nproperty.  \n \n44. \nThe  Hongling  component  will  help  Wuzhou  meet  its  short-  to  medium-term  urban \nexpansion needs, which are induced by the construction and operation of transportation projects \nfor  railway,  expressway,  and  river  transportation.  The  road  network  and  related  infrastructure, \nonce  completed,  will  provide  the  foundation  for  the  expansion  of the  city  into  Hongling,  a  new \nurban  area  away  from  the  geohazard-prone  valleys.  As  envisaged,  the  urbanization  of  the \nHongling  area  will  help  the  city  meet  its  urban  expansion  requirement  up  to  2020, \naccommodating  100,000  residents in  the  geohazard-free  communities  and  creating  thousands \nof new jobs, mainly in the service sector for the city.  \n \nThe geohazard forecasting and early warning system to be introduced and established \n45. \nunder the Project will provide Wuzhou with a stronger geohazard management system. This will \nallow  for  an  early  warning  service  against  geohazard  events,  thus  significantly  enhancing  the \ncity\u2019s capability to prevent geological disasters. \n \nB. \n \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n \n46. \nOverall,  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  significant. \nResettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  for  each  of  the  investment  components:  (i)  the \nPingminchong geohazard resettlement and prevention, and (ii) the Hongling road network and \nrelated infrastructure. The implementation of the Project will affect two rural villages, two urban \nresident  communities,  one  village  administration  office  and  one  township,  and  two  districts. \nPermanent  land  acquisition  will  affect  862  households  or  3,856  persons  (635  urban  dwellers \nand 3,221 rural dwellers). The demolition of residential structures will affect 2,105 households or \n7,081  persons  living  in  private  houses  under  the  administration  of  the  resident  and  village \ncommittees. Further, 15 institutions, 16 enterprises, and seven shops with 1,751 persons will be \nrelocated  because  of  nonresidential  structure  demolition.  Project  construction  will  permanently \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\faffect about 2,393 mu (667 square meters) of state- and collective-owned land, of which 272 mu \n(11.37%)  is  classified  as  farmland;  and  188,038.13  square  meters  (m2)  of  residential  houses \nand  25,022.01  m2  of  nonresidential  structures  of  institutions,  enterprises  and  shops  (5,845  m2 \nused for residential purpose and 19,177.01 m2 for nonresidential purpose) will be demolished. In \naddition,  some  productive  assets,  ground  attachments,  and  basic  infrastructure  and  special \nfacilities will also be affected. Of the total affected population, 383 households or 1,091 persons \nare from vulnerable groups, including 161 households with residential area of less than 12 m2 \nper  capita,  118  households  headed  by  women,  32  households  with  disabled  persons,  42 \nhouseholds  living  under  the  minimum  living  guarantee  (MLG),  and  26  households  with  \u201cfive \nguarantees\u201d.11 Land acquisition or resettlement will not affect any ethnic minority households.  \n \n47. \nBoth  resettlement  plans  have  been  formulated  through  participatory  consultations \nfollowing the relevant laws and regulations of the PRC, and in conformity with ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy. For permanent acquisition of farmland, 30% of land compensation will be \npaid  in  cash  to  the  affected  villages  and  70%  of  land  compensation  to  the  project-affected \npersons. The resettlement subsidy and compensation for standing crops will be fully paid to the \naffected  persons.  For  residential  houses  and  nonresidential  buildings  (i.e.,  institutions, \nenterprises,  and  shops)  that  are  to  be  demolished,  compensation  will  be  paid  to  the  owners, \nincluding those without house certificates. The payment will be made in cash according to the \nappraised value of the property. The households, institutions, enterprises, and shops that have \nto  relocate  will  also  receive  a  relocation  allowance.  Compensation  for  standing  crops, \nauxiliaries,  and  other  assets  will  also  be  paid  directly  to  the  affected  persons.  Income  losses \nresulting  from  reduced  production  and/or  sales  and  wages  caused  by  the  Project  will  be \ncompensated in cash.  \n \n48. \nThe resettlement strategy encompasses the replacement of housing, and the restoration \nof livelihoods and income. People who lose housing have two resettlement options\u2014to receive \nreplacement  house  at  property  rights  exchange  or  cash  compensation.  The  PMO,  Dongtai, \nresettlement  offices,  and  the  concerned  district  governments  will  provide  the  necessary \nrelocation  assistance  during  resettlement  implementation.  The  measures  for  economic \nrehabilitation include (i) provision of jobs generated by the urban development projects, and the \nproject-related  jobs  during  the  project  construction  and  operation;  (ii)  development  of \nnonagricultural  production,  including  self-employed  secondary  and  tertiary  businesses;  (iii) \nprovision of technical training to the affected persons to increase their skills to be employed in \nother institutions, enterprises, and businesses; and (iv) provision of social insurance. Relocated \ninstitutions,  enterprises,  and  shops  will  be  provided  with  the  compensation  and  resettlement \noptions.  The  same  institutions,  enterprises,  and  shops  will  reemploy  the  affected  employees, \nand no job losses are expected. The special needs and expectations of vulnerable groups will \nreceive attention and assistance. The PMO and Dongtai will supervise implementation to ensure \nthese  vulnerable  persons  receive  adequate  compensation,  housing  arrangement,  special \nfunding and MLG, and assistance to restore their living conditions and incomes.  \n \n49. \nThe WMG envisages the Pingminchong component as a social improvement project in \nline  with  the  Government\u2019s  people-centered  principle  to  build  a  harmonious  society.  This \ncomponent  is  designed  to  help  the  people  living  in  the  geohazard-prone  valley  eliminate  the \n\n                                                 \n11 PRC's  social  assistance  system  includes  a  national  system  of  subsistence  allowances  through  the  \"five \nguarantees\"  household  subsistence  program.  Under  this  program,  infirm  and  childless  old  people  enjoy \ngovernment support for food, clothing, medical care, housing and burial expenses.  \n\n14 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fthreat  of  geohazards  and  catch  up  with  the  higher  living  standards  in  other  parts  of  the  city. \nZaochong was selected as the location of the new resettlement community through comparative \nanalysis  of  alternatives  during  the  feasibility  study.  Apart  from  being  geohazard-free,  the \nZaochong site was chosen based on the following technical and socioeconomic considerations: \n(i) space available to accommodate the community development for a mixed, yet harmonized, \nneighborhood; (ii) geological condition and stability; (iii) proximity to existing and planned urban \ninfrastructure  and  social  services;  (iv)  access  to  public  transportation;  and  (v)  proximity  to  the \nexisting  and  planned  commercial,  cultural  and  educational  establishments.  The  new \nresettlement  community  will  provide  quality  housing  with  150,000  m2  of  floor  space  designed \nfollowing  the  national  engineering  and  safety  standards\u2014sufficient  to  accommodate  all  the \nrelocated residents from Pingminchong valley. The resettlement community will be constructed \nin  accordance  with  the  national  standards,  and  will  be  equipped  with  a  wide  range  of  public \ninfrastructure and services, including ample public green space and parking lots; water supply, \ndrainage and sanitation system; lighting; and a community center and other community service \nfacilities.  Compared  with  the  facilities  available  in  Pingminchong  valley,  the  new  resettlement \ncommunity  represents  a  substantial  improvement  in  living  conditions  for  the  people.  A \nhousehold survey conducted for loan processing showed that the families living in the valley are \neager to move out of the geohazard-prone area, and welcome the Project because it provides \nthem with the opportunity and means to free themselves from geohazard threats. \n \nThe  resettlement  palns  and  the  resettlement  information  booklets  have  been  prepared \n50. \nfor disclosure and distributed to the affected villages, communities, and persons. Aside from the \ngovernment  land  available  for  the  Project,  the  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  is  estimated  at  CNY476.7  million  including  contingencies.  A  summary  of  the \nresettlement plans is in Appendix 11; details are in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Benefits \n\n \nThe  Project  will  support  the  achievement  of  the  NSDW  by  promoting  economic \n51. \ndevelopment in the western PRC. Of the 486,000 Wuzhou residents to benefit from the Project, \n20,410 (4.2%) live under the MLG. Ethnic minorities account for 2.4% of the city population. The \nsocial  analysis  concluded  that  they  are  socially  and  economically  integrated  with  the  majority \npopulation, and will not be subject to any adverse impacts of the Project.  The detailed poverty \nand social assessment is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n52. \nRelocation  under  the  Pingminchong  component  will  provide  the  Pingminchong  valley \nresidents  with  an  opportunity  to  free  themselves  of  geohazard  threats,  improve  their  living \nconditions, and gain access to some essential municipal services, which could not be provided \nbecause  of  the  high  density  of  the  low-quality  housing  structures  built  randomly  in  the  valley. \nThe expansion of the urban area into the geohazard-free land, and the increase in permanent \njobs  through  the  urbanization  of  Hongling  area,  will  provide  better  accommodation  and \nlivelihood opportunities for the existing and incoming urban residents of Wuzhou. The continued \nurbanization  of  Wuzhou  will  also  create  new  jobs  that  will  need  to  be  filled  by  migrant  labors, \nmainly coming from the surrounding impoverished areas. \n \n53. \nThe  Project  will  create  2,260  person-years  of  direct  and  indirect  employment,  with \nestimated  earnings  totaling  CNY39  million,  during  the  construction  phase.  The  WMG  has \nassured ADB that vulnerable groups, including women, the poor and the ethnic minorities, will \nbe prioritized for these short-term jobs. Under this arrangement, an estimated 40% of the short-\nterm jobs will be filled by vulnerable groups (about 20% by women, about 20% by the poor and \nethnic minorities). Those temporarily employed in construction will benefit from the training and \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\nthe  concerned  environmental  protection  authorities.  The \n\nexperience  gained  under  the  Project,  enhancing  their  opportunities  for  employment  in  other \ninfrastructure  projects.  The  WMG  has  agreed  that  assuring  vulnerable  groups  of  employment \nopportunities will be included as a project performance indicator to be closely monitored under \nPPMS. Vulnerable groups and affected persons also will be given priority for the mid- to long-\nterm jobs. \n \n54. \nUnder the Project, the contractors will be sensitized to the issue of maximizing benefits \nfor  vulnerable  groups.  In  particular,  the  contractors  will  be  contractually  required  to  prioritize \nvulnerable groups for jobs and training opportunities. The poverty reduction and social strategy \nis summarized in Appendix 12. \n \nC. \n \n55. \nThe  capacity  development  and  institutional  building  component  of  the  Project  involves \nthe provision of consulting services only. These services are expected to improve environmental \nmanagement of the WMG, among other things. Major environmental impacts are expected from \nthe Pingminchong component and Hongling component. An environmental impact assessment \n(EIA)  has  been  prepared  for  each  of  the  two  investment  components.  Both  EIAs  have  been \nprepared  in  accordance  with  relevant  laws  and  regulations  of  the  PRC,  and  have  been \napproved  by \ninvestment \ncomponents were examined against the procedures and criteria specified in ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002), Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), and Environmental Guidelines for \nSelected  Infrastructure  Development  Projects. 12  Extensive  public  consultations  involving \nsurveys,  meetings  with  stakeholders,  and  focus  group  discussions  were  undertaken  during \nproject  preparation.  The  summary  EIA  (SEIA),  including  an  associated  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP),  has  been  prepared.  It  was  circulated  to  the  Board  of  Directors  and \nposted on the ADB website on 14 August 2008. The SEIA is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \nAs highlighted in the SEIA, the Project will improve the living and working conditions for \n56. \nresidents of Wuzhou. It will also strengthen the sustainability of urban development in Wuzhou \nby  addressing  one  of  the  most  acute  development  constraints\u2014the  city\u2019s  vulnerability  to \ngeohazards.  Other  environmental  benefits  include  (i)  less  soil  erosion  and  dust  from  the \nexposed slopes; (ii) less clogging of drainage and  siltation of waterways  from  mud and  debris \nflows  and  eroded  soil;  (iii)  better  environmental  amenities \nfor  geohazard-threatened \ncommunities  after  resettlement  or  treatment  and  redevelopment;  and  (iv)  an  elevated  road \nnetwork in Hongling area, which may also serve as flood escape routes in extreme weather. \n \n57.  Major  adverse  impacts  of  the  Project  include  air,  water,  and  noise  pollution  during \nconstruction. In general, these impacts are temporary and/or localized. Mitigation measures are \nprescribed  in  the  SEIA  and  EMP  under  EIAs.  The  adverse  environmental  impacts  associated \nwith the Project will be prevented, eliminated, or minimized to an acceptable level through the \nimplementation of the EMP under the SEIA and EIAs. The mitigation measures described in the \nEMP  will  be  updated  during  engineering  design,  and  will  be  continually  refined  during \nconstruction. Dongtai, the contractors, and the operating agencies will implement the EMP. The \nimplementation  will  be  closely  monitored  and  supervised  by  a  professionally  specialized \nenvironmental  monitoring  agency\u2014Wuzhou  Environmental  Monitoring  Center\u2014with  results \nreported regularly to the PMO, Wuzhou Environmental Protection Bureau, and ADB. A copy of \nthe EMP is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n\ntwo \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB. 1993. Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Development Projects. Manila. \n\n\fFinancial Aspects \n\nD. \n \n58. \nThe  Project  does  not  have  a  revenue  generating  component.  Therefore,  the  financial \nanalysis concentrated on the assessment of the financial impact and management of the WMG \nand  Dongtai,  as  the  IA.  The  fiscal  impact  and  affordability  were  assessed  by  comparing \nidentified  financing  sources  with  the  annual  funds  required  for  capital  expenditures  during \nproject implementation, and for operation and maintenance and debt service during operation. \nDuring  project  implementation,  the  counterpart  fund  requirement  is  expected  to  peak  in  2010 \nand  2011.  It  will  reach  a  manageable  level  of  about  6%  of  the  WMG\u2019s  current  annual  capital \nexpenditure  budget  in  those  years.  At  its  highest  level  in  2014,  projected  debt  service  is \nexpected  to  account  for  7.6%  of  operational  expenditures  of  the  WMG  before  gradually \ndeclining to 4.5%  in  2019.  This  indicates  an  acceptable  fiscal  risk  for  the  WMG,  particularly  in \nthe light of the sustained increase in revenues of the WMG. Since Dongtai will play the role of an \nagent to implement the Project on behalf of the WMG, the Project will have little impact on the \nfinancial  status  of  the  IA.  Assessment  of  the  financial  impact  on  the  WMG  and  Dongtai \nconfirmed that the Project will not affect the financial sustainability of either.  \n \n59. \nThe  potential  of  the  proposed  revolving  financing  mechanism  has  been  examined  by \ncomparing  geohazard  resettlement  and  prevention  costs  and  the  revenues  that  could  be \ngenerated from auction of the treated lands. Assuming that urban land values in Wuzhou remain \nat the current level, revenue from the sales of the treated and geohazard-free land would enable \nthe WMG to fully recover the cost of geohazard resettlement and prevention with a net gain of \nabout  CNY43.7  million.  This  surplus  could  be  used  as  seed  money  to  establish  the  revolving \nfinancing  mechanism  for  future  geohazard-mitigation  projects  of  the  other  geohazard-prone \nvalleys of the city. \n \nThe  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  WMG  and  Dongtai  have \n60. \nadequate \nfinancial  management \nprofessionals to manage the Project. Since this will be the first time for the WMG and Dongtai to \nimplement a project funded by a multilateral development bank, intensive training will be needed \nto  help  them  understand  and  become  familiar  with  ADB  policy  and  project  management \nrequirements. Relevant training has been included in the capacity development and institutional \nstrengthening component of the Project. More details of financial performance and management \nassessment are summarized in Appendix 13. The detailed financial management assessment is \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nE. \n \n61. \nThe economic analysis of the Project covers project justification, general parameters for \neconomic analysis, project cost and benefits, least-cost analysis, and distribution analysis. The \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for each of the investment components \nand for the Project as a whole. The economic rationale of the Project is solid. The Project will \nsupport the WMG in promoting urban development and combating geohazards in an integrated, \nwell-programmed,  and  cost-effective  manner.  The  primary  benefits  of  the  Project  include  the \nfollowing:  (i)  avoidance  of  property  damage  and  deaths  caused  by  geohazards,  improved \nhousing  conditions  and \nthe  geohazard-threatened  residents  of \nPingminchong  valley;  (ii)  increases  in  land  values  because  of  improvements  in  geological \ncondition  and  infrastructure;  (iii)  typical  benefits  arising  from  a  road  project  such  as  time \nsavings,  fuel  savings,  vehicle  operating  cost  savings,  and  accident  cost  reductions  through \nprovision of municipal road infrastructure for the Hongling area; and (iv) faster GDP growth from \nimprovements  in  general  infrastructure.  The  EIRR  is  19.3%  for  Pingminchong  component  and \n\nfinancial  management  systems  and  enough \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\nthe  quality  of \n\ninternal \n\nlife \n\nfor \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\fProject Risks and Mitigation Measures  \n\n20.9%  for  Hongling  component  under  the  base  case  scenario.  The  EIRR  for  the  Project  as  a \nwhole is 20.7%. All EIRRs are higher than the 12% economic opportunity cost of capital under \nvarious sensitivity analyses, including an increase in costs, a decrease in benefits, and a delay \nin  implementation.  A  summary  economic  analysis  is  in  Appendix  14.  A  detailed  economic \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nF. \n \nThe  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  Conventional  engineering \n62. \ndesigns  with  proven  records  of  reliable  performance  will  be  adopted  for  construction  of  the \nresettlement  community  and  road  network,  and  for  installation  of  the  related  municipal \ninfrastructure  along  the  roads.  Engineering  measures  to  prevent  geohazards  will  adopt  the \nconventional technology with proven track records in Wuzhou. \n \n63. \nThe  challenge  of  relocating  a  large  quantity  of  households  may  pose  a  risk  to  the \nProject.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  detailed  resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  for  the  two \ninvestment components under the Project, strictly following ADB resettlement safeguards policy \nand  participatory  consultation  procedures.  Substantial consulting  inputs  have  been included in \nthe  capacity  development  and  institutional  strengthening  component  to  provide  guidance  and \ntechnical support for WMG and Dongtai. This will help ensure appropriate implementation of the \nresettlement plans following the ADB resettlement safeguard policy requirements.  \n \n64. \nThe implementation of the resettlement plans will be subject to internal monitoring by the \nWMG and external monitoring by an independent agency to be engaged at the start of project \nimplementation.  The  WMG  will  closely  monitor  and  regularly  report  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  progress  through  its  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB.  In  addition,  the \nindependent monitoring agency will visit these investment components separately to (i) review \nresettlement  progress  and  the  general  welfare  of  affected  persons,  (ii)  recommend  ways  to \nresolve  any  issues  or  problems,  (iii)  provide  advice  to  Dongtai  and  the  local  officials,  and  (iv) \nevaluate  the  resettlement  plan  implementation.  The  independent  monitoring  agency  will  be \nrequired to pay special attention to vulnerable groups including women and the poor, to assess \nwhether  they  have  fully  regained  their  standards  of  living.  Such  monitoring  and  evaluation \nreports  will  be  prepared  every  6  months  during  implementation,  and  annually  for  2  years \nconsecutively  after \nthe  completion  of  resettlement.  These  reports  will  be  submitted \nsimultaneously to ADB, the WMG, and Dongtai, and will be uploaded to the ADB website. \n \nAnother  risk  might  arise  from  inappropriate  engineering  design  and/or  irresponsible \n65. \nengineering  treatment  for  the  geohazard  prevention  measures  to  be  undertaken  for  the \nevacuated  Pingminchong  valley.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  the  WMG  has  provided  specific \nassurances  that  the  engineering  design  and  treatment  of  geohazard  prevention  measures  will \nstrictly  follow  the  national  design  and  engineering  standards  for  geohazard  control  and \nprevention  works.  Under  the  capacity  development  and  institutional  strengthening  component, \nexperts in geohazard engineering safety will provide guidance and quality control to ensure the \nquality  and  safety  of  the  geohazard  prevention  engineering  measures  undertaken  by  the \nProject.  \n \n66. \nCompared  with  the  threat  of  geohazards  to  the  life  and  property  of  people  in  Wuzhou, \nand  their  constraint  on  the  development  opportunities  of  the  city,  the  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts of the Project are expected to outweigh the costs. The identified risks are manageable, \ngiven the mitigation measures provided. \n \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\fV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government,  the  GZARG,  and  the  WMG \n\n67. \nhave given the following assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nProvision  of  counterpart  fund.  The  Government  and  WMG  will  ensure  (a) \ntimely  provision  of  adequate  counterpart  financing  as  required  in  the  financing \nplan of the Project, and (b) provision of additional counterpart funds to cover any \nshortfall of funds or cost overruns that may occur during project implementation.  \n\n(i) \n\n  \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n\nApprovals of project land. The Project will be given all the land use approvals \nfrom the concerned authorities of the Government in a timely manner to ensure \ntimely implementation of the Project. \n\nImplementation of resettlement plans. The Government and WMG will ensure \n(a) timely updating of the resettlement plans at the stage of engineering design \ntaking  into  account  the  results  of  detailed  measurement  surveys,  (b)  submitting \nthe  updated  resettlement  plans  for  ADB  concurrence  prior  to  award  of  related \ncivil  works  contract,  and  (c)  disclose  the  updated  resettlement  plans  to  the \naffected  persons.  The  Government  and  the  WMG  will  further  ensure  that  the \nresettlement  plans  will  be  implemented  in  strict  conformity  to  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy. \n\nResettlement arrangement. The Government and the WMG will ensure that (a) \nconstruction  of  the  resettlement  community  in  Zaozhuang  will  have  been \ncompleted  with  sufficient  quality  housing  facilities  and  functioning  municipal \ninfrastructure  before  relocating  the  households  out  of  Pingminchong  valley  and \ndemolishing  their  current  houses,  (b)  the  project-affected  households  will  be \nprovided  a  replacement  housing  area  equivalent  to  their  current  housing \nconditions  in  their  original  place,  and  (c)  cash  option  will  be  provided  for  those \nfamilies  that  may  wish  to  settle  in  a  community  different  from  the  resettlement \ncommunity constructed under the Project.     \n\nEmployment opportunity for the vulnerable groups. The Government and the \nWMG will ensure that priority will be accorded to the vulnerable groups including \nthe women, the poor, and the ethnic minorities for the employment opportunities \ncreated  under  the  Project.  The  achievement  in  providing  employment  for  the \nvulnerable groups will be closely monitored as part of the PPMS.   \n\nImplementation  of  environmental  management  plan.  The  Government  and \nthe  WMG  will  ensure  (a)  timely  elaborating  and  updating  of  the  mitigation \nmeasures \ntimely \nimplementation of the mitigation measures specified in EMP.  \n\nin  EMP  during  engineering  design,  and  (b) \n\nincluded \n\nTechnical  standards  for  geohazard  control.  The  Government  and  the  WMG \nwill  ensure  that  the  national  regulations  and  technical  standards  for  geohazard \ncontrol and prevention works will be adopted in the design and undertaking of the \nengineering treatment for geohazard control and prevention measures under the \nProject.  \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Monitoring mechanism for quality control. The Government and the WMG will \nensure  that,  with  support  of  the  project  implementation  consultants,  a  special \nmonitoring mechanism will be established to closely observe the slope stability of \nPingminchong  valley  throughout  the  project  implementation  period  until  2  years \nafter project completion.   \n\nOperation and maintenance of the geohazard forecasting and early warning \nsystem.  The  Government  and  the  WMG  will  ensure  that  the  geohazard \nforecasting  and  early  warning  system  will  be  established  and  put  in  operation \nbefore  the  completion  of  Pingminchong  geohazard  resettlement  and  prevention \ncomponent.  The  Government  and  the  WMG  will  further  ensure  to  provide \nsufficient  full  time  professional  staff  and  financial  resources  to  support  the \noperation  and  maintenance  of  the  geohazard  forecasting  and  early  warning \nsystem to ensure its sustainable operation. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n68. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  loan  of  $100,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Guangxi  Wuzhou \nUrban  Development  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nC.

It  has  existed  for  more  than  2,100  years.  Under  the  local  government \nsystem  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  the  Wuzhou  municipal  government  (WMG) \nhas  jurisdiction  over  three  urban  districts  (Wanxiu,  Dieshan,  and  Changzhou),  one  county-city \n(Cenxi), and three rural counties (Cangwu, Mengshan, and Tengxian). The total area of Wuzhou \nis 12,588 square kilometres (km2), including an urban area is 1,097 km2 (8.7% of the total). By \nthe end of 2006, the total population under WMG administration was 3.08 million, including an \nurban  population  of  489,300  (15.9%).  However,  in  general  terms  and  in  the  context  of  the \nGuangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project, Wuzhou refers only to the city itself, comprising \nthe  three  urban  districts  and  covering  a  developed  urban  area  of  50  km2  with  a  population  of \n486,000. \n \nWuzhou  is  at  the  junction  of  the  Xijiang  River  and  the  Guijiang  River.  Xijiang  is  the \n2. \nupstream  section  of  Zhujiang  (i.e.  the  Pearl  River),  which  links  Guangxi  with  the  Pearl  River \nDelta\u2014a major growth engine of the PRC. Through these rivers, Wuzhou is connected to most \nof  the  important  cities  of  Guangxi,  including  Nanning,  Liuzhou,  Guigang,  and  Guilin  in  the \nupstream  direction;  and  many  cities  of  national  and  international  significance,  including \nGuangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macau, in the downstream direction. Because of its location and \neasy  connection  with  the  regional  waterway  system,  Wuzhou  used  to  have  a  very  prominent \nposition  in  Guangxi.  During  the  water  transportation  era  up  to  1980s,  Wuzhou  used  to  be  the \nmost  important  gateway  city  of  southwestern  PRC,  connecting  Guangxi  and  surrounding \nprovinces  with  national  and  international  markets.  As  a  result  of  the  water  transport  system, \nWuzhou  became  one  of  the  earliest  international  port  cities  of  Guangxi,  with  modern  customs \nestablished in 1897.   \n \n3. \nAs  the  land  transportation  systems  in  the  PRC  developed  rapidly,  Wuzhou  has  lagged \nbehind other cities in Guangxi that have gained direct access to the railway system and/or the \nexpressway  network.  Wuzhou  is  connected  only  by  highways  and  an  irregular  local  airline \nservice, in addition to the century-old declining water transport system. Lack of direct access to \nrailway  system  and  the  expressway  network  has  prevented  Wuzhou\u2014once  a  regional \ntransportation hub\u2014from realizing its full potential. \n \nIn  2006,  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  of  Wuzhou  was  CNY27.1  billion,  14.2% \n4. \nhigher than in 2005. On a per capita basis, Wuzhou\u2019s GDP was CNY8,789 (about $1,000 at the \nexchange rate in 2006), less than half the national average of $2,036 for 2006. Primary sectors \nof  the  economy  account  for  19.7%  of  GDP,  while  secondary  sectors  account  for  45%  and \ntertiary sectors 35.3%. Despite the high growth rate, Wuzhou is still a less-developed city at the \nearly stage of urbanization.  \n \n5. \nTo ensure sustained urban development, Wuzhou first needs to improve and strengthen \nits  connectivity  to  national  and  international  markets  by  gaining  direct  access  to  the  fast \ndeveloping modern transport system of the PRC. With support from the central government and \nthe government of Guangxi, Wuzhou will benefit from six ongoing, domestically funded national \ntransport  infrastructure  projects,  including  (i)  three  expressway  projects  to  link  Wuzhou  to  the \nnational expressway system in three directions (to Guilin in the north, Nanning in the west, and \nGuangzhou  in  the  east);  (ii)  two  railway  projects  to  connect  Wuzhou  with  the  national  trunk \nrailroads  both  vertically  (north-south)  from  Luoyang  to  Zhanjiang  and  horizontally  (east-west) \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nSpecial Challenges for Urban Development in Wuzhou \n\nfrom Guangzhou to Nanning; and (iii) one program to upgrade the water transport system of the \nXijiang-Zhujiang  rivers.  These  important  transportation  projects  will  once  again  make  Wuzhou \nan  important  regional  transportation  center  under  the  integrated  multimodal  transportation \nsystem  of  the  PRC.  In  particular,  Wuzhou  is  expected  to  become  a  regional  multimodal \ntransportation hub linking Qugangxi and surrounding provinces with the Pearl River Delta. \n \nB.  \n \nSustained  urban  development  in  Wuzhou  faces  several  challenges.  In  addition  to  the \n6. \nweak urban planning and financing capacity commonly found in many municipal governments in \nthe PRC, Wuzhou is constrained by its geographic location and geological conditions.  \n \nWuzhou is a mountainous city divided into three parts by two big rivers. The city proper, \n7. \nwhich  is  on  the  north  bank  of  Xunjiang  River  and/or  Xijiang  River,1 is  further  divided  by  the \nGuijiang River into the old urban center on the east side and a fast-growing new urban center \non the west side. The south bank of Xunjiang and/or Xijiang River has not been developed.  \n \n8. \nBefore  the  development  of  the  new  urban  area  on  the  west  side  of  Guijiang  River  in \n1980s,  the  old  city  proper  was  confined  to  a  small  developed  parcel  of  urban  land  of  about  2 \nkm2  on  the  northeast  corner  of  the  intersection  between  Guijiang  River  and  Xijiang  River. \nBecause of the increase in the urban population and the lack of appropriate urban planning, the \nresidential  areas  expanded  into  marginal  lands  up  the  mountain  slopes  along  major  valleys. \nMost  of  the  houses  in  these  valleys  were  simple  structures  randomly  built  with  little  planning. \nGradually,  many  of  the  major  valleys  became  crowded  with  low-quality  houses,  many  built \nadjacent to each other. The mountains in Wuzhou are mainly formed by loose earth formation, \neroded granite, and clastic rocks, making them highly vulnerable to geological disasters such as \nlandslides,  slope  collapses  and  mud  and  debris  flow  during  the  rainy  season.  Many  of  the \nheavily populated valleys are officially classified as geohazard-prone valley, with thousands of \nurban residents threatened by geological disasters. \n \n9. \nThe high density of low-quality housing and their vulnerability to geohazards in the major \nvalleys  around  the  old  urban  center  has  left  Wuzhou  little  choice  but  to  expand  the  urban \nboundary  into  the  geohazard-free  areas  across  the  rivers  and  outside  the  traditional  urban \ncenter. The urban expansion is now guided under the Wuzhou Urban Development Master Plan \nfor  2002\u20132020,  which  was  formulated  by  the  WMG  and  approved  by  the  Wuzhou  People\u2019s \nCongress and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region government. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nBased on an examination of the challenges and development opportunities of Wuzhou, \nthe master plan has proposed as the overall goal making Wuzhou an export-oriented industrial \ncity  in  the  east  of  Guangxi,  and  a  transportation  hub  to  connect  Guangxi  with  the  Pearl  River \nDelta.  \n \nGiven  the  geographic  and  geological  conditions,  Wuzhou  needs  to  be  developed  in \n11. \nclusters.  As  envisaged  in  the  master  urban  development  plan,  Wuzhou  would  comprise  \u201cone \ncentral  city,  one  sub-city  center,  three  county  seats  and  five  town  axels.\u201d  This  is  intended  to \n\nWuzhou Urban Development Master Plan  \n\n                                                 \n1   The  upstream  section  of  the  Xijiang  River  is  called  the  Xunjiang  River  before  meeting  the  Guijiang  River  at  the \nintersection in Wuzhou. The Xijiang River is referred to either as the Xunjiang River or as Xijiang River, depending \non whether the specific segment is located upstream of the intersection or downstream of the intersection.  \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nmake use of the lands available on the west and southwest sides of the city that are close to the \ntraditional city proper, and to deploy the urban infrastructure cost-effectively.  \n \n12. \nThe  long-term  urban  expansion  in  Wuzhou  is  generally  moving  south  and  west,  under \nthe  established  land  use  principle  of  developing  the  south,  expanding  towards  the  west, \nupgrading  the  east,  and  controlling  the  north.  Following  this  principle,  the  priorities  are  the \ndevelopment of new geohazard-free urban areas in Hongling and Sanlong in the west and in the \nCangwu County in the south, and upgrading the development of Changzhou Island of Xunjiang \nRiver  in  the  southwest.  To  realize  this  urban  development  concept,  the  transportation \nconnections among major clusters need to be constructed or enhanced.  \n \n13. \nUnder the master plan, the WMG envisaged the acceleration of urbanization and steady \ndevelopment  of  the  city  proper,  as  well  as  other  urban  areas  in  the  county  seats  and  smaller \ntowns. The population of Wuzhou overall was expected to reach 3.5 million by 2020, of which \nabout  50%\u201355%  was  to  reside  in  the  urbanized  areas  in  Wuzhou  city  proper  and  other  urban \ncenters under the jurisdiction of the WMG. Total developed urban lands was expected to grow \nto 67 km2 at the end of the 11th Five Year Plan in 2010, and then continue to grow up to 2020.   \n \n14. \nFrom 2003 to 2005, the WMG accumulatively invested CNY3.5 billion to develop basic \nurban infrastructure. These include 28 kilometers (km) of urban roads, five bridges, more than \n100  lanes,  and  the  lighting  system  of  the  city.  Public  investment  in  basic  infrastructure  has \ninduced substantial public or private investment to develop the service sector, as well as a large \nquantity  of  commercial  facilities  in  the  new  urban  areas  and  the  newly  constructed  and  well-\nserviced residential areas in the geohazard-free areas. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nDuring  loan  processing,  a  comprehensive  analysis  was  conducted  and  applied  the \n\u201cstrength, weakness, opportunity and threat\u201d approach to Wuzhou, which produced the following \nfindings: \n \n\nDevelopment Potentials Assessment \n\n(i) \n\nStrengths.  The  analysis  identified  the  following  strengths:  (a)  relatively  short \ndistance to the major cities of the Pearl River Delta, including Guangzhou, Hong \nKong,  and  Macau;  (b)  rich  historical  and  cultural  resources;  (c)  adequate  water \nsupply;  (d)  clean  environment;  (e)  forest  resources;  and  (f)  good  variety  of \nagricultural products. \n\n \n(ii)  Weaknesses.  The  analysis  identified  the  following  weaknesses:  (a)  lack  of \ndeveloped  urban  land  for  urban  expansion,  (b)  vulnerability  to  geohazards,  (c) \nlack of direct access to the integrated multimodal modern transportation system, \n(d) lack of natural endowment and advantage to develop a solid and specialized \nmanufacturing base as a backbone to support sustained industrialization, and (e) \nthe relatively weak institutional capability urban planning and municipal financing. \n\nOpportunities.  The  analysis  identified  the  following  opportunities:  (a)  support \nfrom the central Government under the National Strategy for Development of the \nWest,  (b)  access  to  the  multimodal  transportation  system  provided  by  the \nongoing  national  infrastructure  projects,  (c)  shift  of  the  manufacturing  industries \nfrom  the  coastal  cities  in  the  Pearl  River  Delta  towards  the  low-cost  cities  in \ninland  provinces  and  autonomous  regions,  (d)  the  new  initiative  of  Guangxi  to \npromote the Beibu Gulf Economic Development Zone, and (e) access to financial \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nsupport  and \ncooperation with the Asian Development Bank. \n\ninternational  knowledge  and  experiences  obtained \n\nthrough \n\nThreats.  The  analysis  identified  the  following  threats:  (a)  geohazards,  and  (b) \nenvironmental impact that may arise from rapid urbanization and industrialization. \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n\n16. \nThis analysis has confirmed the potential for sustained urban development of Wuzhou. \nIn  view  of  the  ongoing  transportation  infrastructure  projects,  and  the  location  of  the  city  at  the \njunction  of  a  number  of  important  national  expressways  and  railways,  Wuzhou  is  expected  to \ndevelop  into  an  important  multimodal  regional  transportation  center  upon  completion  of  these \nprojects. Wuzhou\u2019s tertiary sector, particularly logistics services, is envisaged to grow rapidly. \n \nAfter completion of these infrastructure projects, Wuzhou will be within a half-day travel \n17. \nby car or by passenger train of residents in most cities in the Peal River Delta and Beibu Gulf \nEconomic Zone. The clean and undisturbed natural environment and historical legacy of the city \ncan  provide  a  good  basis  for  development  of  tourism  and  recreation  service  to  support \nsustained urban development.   \n \n18. \nAs noted in the master plan, Wuzhou has good potential for industrial development. The \nmanufacturing sector needs to be developed selectively by establishing well-managed industrial \nparks  to  ensure  environmental  protection  and  environmental  sustainability  of  the  city,  as \nrequired  in  the  master  plan.  Given  the  location  of  Wuzhou  upstream  of  Xijiang  River,  these \nindustrial  parks  need  to  enforce  strict  entrance  criteria  to  avoid  discharging  pollutants  into \nXijiang River\u2014the water source for millions of people in downstream cities.  \n \n19. \nIn the context of environmental protection, the assessment highly commends the recent \nactions undertaken by the WMG to shut down polluting business in Wuzhou, including two coal-\nfired  thermal  power  plants  and  280  small  paper  mills.  In  addition,  the  WMG  has  installed \nautomatic pollution emission monitoring facilities for the 11 key polluting sources identified in the \ncity. \n \n20. \nThe  assessment  recommends  prioritizing  development  activities  envisaged  under  the \nmaster plan. The development of the north bank of the Xunjiang River and/or the Xijiang River, \nparticularly the Hongling area between the existing developed urban land and the railway station \nthat is under construction, should be the first priority. After completion of the railway station, the \nHongling  area  is  expected  to  serve  as  the  logistics  base  for  the  railway  station  and  other \ntransport facilities in this geohazard-free urban area. \n \n21. \nGeohazard concerns can be addressed as part of the urban development process by (i) \npromoting  urban  expansion  into  geohazard-free  areas,  (ii)  building  well-serviced  housing \nfacilities  in  the  geohazard-free  areas,  (iii)  moving  the  residents  from  the  geohazard-prone \nvalleys  and  relocating  them  into  geohazard-free  communities,  and  (iv)  undertaking  geohazard \ncontrol  and  prevention  measures  to  convert  the  evacuated  valley  into  geohazard-free  land  for \nurban redevelopment.   \n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nGEOHAZARD MANAGEMENT IN WUZHOU \n\nGeohazards in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n\n \nA. \n \nIn  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  geohazards  include  landslides,  slope \n1. \ncollapses, mud and debris flows, earth cracks, and land depressions that are either induced by \nnatural factors or human activities.1 \n \nWith complex geological and geographical formations and climate conditions, the PRC \n2. \nis  among  the  countries  that  suffer  most  from  a  wide  variety  of  large-scale  and  high-frequency \ngeohazards  that  are  widely  distributed.  All  provinces  except  for  Shanghai  are  affected  by \nlandslides,  slope  collapses,  and  mud  and  debris  flows.  The  provinces  of  Yunnan,  Sichuan, \nChongqing, Guangxi, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Shanxi, and Fujian \nare the worst hit. Geohazards between 1995 and 2005 left 1,108 people dead or missing, and \ncaused  a  direct  economic  loss  of  CNY5.9  billion  on  average  each  year.  The  worst  year  was \n1998,  when  the  PRC  suffered  a  direct  economic  loss  of  CNY15  billion  (footnote  1).  Official \nstatistics  show  that  more  than  102,800  geohazards  occurred  in  2006  across  the  country, \nincluding 2,041 in Guangxi, and caused a direct economic loss of CNY4.3 billion.2 \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  Government  has  tangibly  strengthened  geohazard  management.  For  the  10th \nFive-Year  Plan  (2001-2005),  the  number  of  deaths  as  a  result  of  geohazards  decreased  to \n4,278 from 6,621 during the 9th Five-Year Plan (1996-2000); and the direct economic loss fell to \nCNY21.1  billion  from  CNY31.8  billion.  The  major  programs  or  projects  of  the  Government  are \nhighlighted in paras. 4\u20137. \n \n\nAchievements \n\n1. \n\nGeohazard Surveys and Monitoring \n\n4. \nBetween  1999  and  2005,  the  Ministry  of  Land  and  Resources  organized  geohazard \nsurveys for the 700 most vulnerable counties and cities in the country. The surveys provided a \ngood understanding of the causes and distribution of geohazards which laid a solid foundation \nfor  planning  the  geohazard  prevention  and  control  projects.  Based  on  the  surveys,  geohazard \nmonitoring networks, comprising stations at more than 60,000 monitoring locations, have been \nestablished in the 700 most vulnerable counties and cities. Demonstration monitoring programs \nare being carried out in the pilot areas. \n \n\n2. \n\nGeohazard Forecasting and Early Warning \n\nSince  2003, \n\n5. \nthe  Ministry  of  Land  and  Resources  and  China  Meteorological \nAdministration  began  to  integrate  geohazard  and  weather  forecast  and  early  warning  at  the \nnational level. Similar work has been introduced in some provinces and cities. \n \n\n3. \n\nEmergency Response System \n\n6. \nAfter  the  State  Council  issued  the  national  action  plan  for  geohazard  emergency \nresponses  on  14  May  2005,  all  the  provinces  and  the  vast  majority  of  the  geohazard-prone \ncounties  and  cites  have  formulated  their  own  action  plans.  An  emergency  response  system, \n\n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Land and Resources. 2008. The 11th National FYP for Prevention and Control of Geohazard.

Financing  support  by \n\n7. \nIn  2003,  the  State  Council  promulgated  the  Ordinance  on  Geohazard  Prevention  and \nControl,  which  took  effect  on  1  March  2004.  The  29  geohazard-relevant  provinces  have  also \nformulated local ordinances and management guidelines, thus setting up a legal framework to \ngovern geohazard prevention and control in the PRC. \n \nC. \n \nThe various levels of governments (central, provincial, county and city, and township) \n8. \nshare  responsibility  for  financing  geohazard  prevention  and  control.3 The  central  Government \nhas  instructed  each  level  of  government  to  set  up  a  geohazard  prevention  and  control  fund \nwithin  the  government  operating  budget.  The  central  Government  will  fund  the  cost  of  the \ngeohazard survey and assessment, and the establishment of the national geohazard monitoring \nand  early  warning  system.  Geohazard  emergency  response  systems  at  the  provincial  and/or \nlower levels of government will be funded by the respective local governments. The provincial \nand local governments will fund the cost for resettlement of people threatened by  geohazards \nand geological disaster rehabilitation and mitigation, while the central Government will provide \nsupport and subsidies for mitigation of large geohazards. If research on geohazard prevention \nand  control  has  demonstration  value,  the  project  may  apply  for  funding  under  the  relevant \nnational  science  and \nlocal \ngovernments and enterprises is encouraged. \n \nD. \n \nThe  11th  national  five-year  program  for  prevention  and  control  of  geohazard  2006\u2013\n9. \n2010 (FYP-PCG) established a number of principles, including (i) \u201cprevention-first\u201d and \u201chuman-\ncentered  principles\u201d,  (ii)  integrated  treatment  and  resettlement  approach,  (iii)  mass-based \nmonitoring  and  prevention  system  with  clearly  defined  roles  and  responsibilities,  and  (iv) \nstronger  regulatory  framework  and  introducing  technological  advancement.  In  particular,  FYP-\nPCG  calls  for  the  resettlement  of  those  under  serious  threat,  and  the  establishment  of  an \nintegrated monitoring, forecasting, early warming, and emergency response system. The overall \ngoal  is  to  reduce  the  geohazard-threatened  population  by  30%  from  the  2005  baseline  by  the \nend of the 11th FYP-PCG. \n \nE. \n \nOriginating  from  a  small  plain  at  the  intersection  of  two  major  rivers,  Wuzhou  is  a \n10. \ntypical  mountainous  city  and  one  of  the  most  geohazard-prone  areas  in  the  Guangxi  Zhuang \nAutonomous  Region.  Rapid  urban  expansion  has  significantly  increased  the  distribution, \nfrequency, and scale of geohazards, causing greater damage to people\u2019s lives and properties, \nto socioeconomic development, and to social stability. \n \n \n\nNational 11th Five-Year Program for Prevention and Control of Geohazard \n\nGeohazards in Wuzhou \n\n                                                 \n3   Government  policy  states  that  if  a  geohazard  or  disaster  is  triggered  by  a  project,  the  project  owner  will  be  held \nresponsible for paying for the mitigation. Governments will be responsible for the prevention, control, and mitigation \nof geohazards and disasters caused by natural factors. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nStatistics show that the city is hit by several dozen landslides and slope collapses every \n11. \nyear.  Between  2000  and  2005,  many  urban  districts  of  Wuzhou  experienced  landslides  and \nslope collapses. On 8 June 2006, an exceptionally strong rainstorm hit Wuzhou, triggering 181 \nlandslides,  48  slope  collapses,  and  64  mud  and  debris  flows.  The  geological  disasters \nthreatened  the  lives  of  21,673  people  and  caused  extensive  damages,  laving  12  dead,  26 \nwounded,  and  825  residential  buildings  destroyed.  The  direct  economic  loss  totaled  about \nCNY30 million.  \n \nA land use survey found that, because geohazard-free urban land is lacking, about 30 \n12. \nenterprises and organizations and 53,000 residents of Wuzhou inhabit urban districts classified \nas  geohazard-prone  zones.  Private  low-quality  residential  buildings  account  for  70%  of  the \nhousing  structures  in  these  geohazard-prone  zones.  These  buildings  were  constructed  in \nmultiple cascades on the mountain slopes. Because of the complex geographical conditions and \nhistory, most of the private residential buildings were randomly built adjacent to another on the \nslope of mountains without any planning or geohazard safety assessment. The living conditions \nof  the  people  in  these  geohazard-prone  areas  are  affected  by  lack  of  access  to  urban \ninfrastructure  services,  overcrowded  housing,  narrow  and  poor  road  connections,  sewage \ndischarge into open sewers, and wanton removal of earth and vegetation.  \n \n13. \nThe geohazards in Wuzhou are attributed to a number of factors, including topography, \nstructure  of  the  earth  surface,  vegetation,  and  rainfall.  Wuzhou  has  a  steep  and  ragged \ntopography.  The  surface  is  a  thin  layer  of  loose,  porous  earth  on  an  impermeable  rock  base. \nThe trees on the slopes are large and will generate cracks on the surface of the slopes in strong \nwinds,  adding  more  moisture  to  the  loose  surface  material.  A  strong  and  long-lasting  storm, \nwhen combined these factors, can trigger landslides in the geohazard-prone areas. \n \nF. \n \n\nWuzhou Municipal Government Response \n\n1. \n\nPlanning and Regulatory Development \n\nIn \n\nline  with  national  policy, \n\n14. \nthe  Wuzhou  municipal  government  (WMG)  has \nstrengthened  planning  and  regulatory  development  for  geohazard  prevention  and  control. \nFollowing the proclamation by the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region government (GZARG) \nof  the  Circular  on  Strengthening  Geohazard  Prevention  and  Control,4 the  WMG  prepared  and \nreleased the Short-Term Plan for Geohazard Prevention and Control in Urban Area of Wuzhou \n(2003\u20132005).  In  May  2006,  the  Wuzhou  Land  Resources  Bureau  (WLRB)  completed  the \nWuzhou  Urban  Geohazard  Prevention  and  Control  Master  Plan.  In  October  2006,  the  WMG \nissued  the  Circular  on  Strengthening  Geohazard  Prevention  and  Control  for  Construction \nProjects.5 \n \nAt  the  same  time,  the  WMG  invested  substantial  human,  material  and  financial \n15. \nresources  in  improving  urban  planning  and  management,  and  strengthening  the  mitigation \nmeasures  to  help  the  communities  in  the  geohazard  valleys  to  cope  with  the  geohazard \nconcerns. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n4 Gui Zheng Fa No. (2002) 205. \n5 Wu Zheng Fa No. (2006) 40. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3      31 \n\n2. \n\nEnhanced Institutional Capacity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  WMG  has  established  leading  groups  to  strengthen  the  geohazard  management \n16. \nsystem \nin  municipalities  and  districts,  with  well-defined  responsibilities  and  reporting \nrelationships. The WMG has also established a system of geohazard review, assessment, and \nreporting,  including  (i)  the  requirements  for  geohazard  risk  assessment  for  all  construction \nprojects,  (ii)  an  accreditation  system  for  the  engineering  design  institutes  and  civil  works \ncontractors  for  undertaking  geohazard  prevention  and  control  projects,  (iii)  geohazard  early \nwarning  and  emergency  response  plan,  (iv)  disaster  reporting  system,  (v)  inspection  and \nassessment system for disaster impacts, and (vi) the special geohazard monitoring program for \nthe rainy season. \n \n\n3. \n\nImproved Geohazard Surveys \n\n17. \nFurther to the geohazard survey that the GZARG commissioned for Wuzhou in the late \n1990s,  the  Government  in  2003  conducted  a  geohazard  survey  with  mapping  at  a  1:100,000 \nscale for Wuzhou. The outputs of the survey include (i) preliminary classification of geohazards \nbased on their causes and distribution patterns; (ii) delineation of the geohazard risks, and the \ngeohazard  prevention  and  control  areas;  and  (iii)  a  geohazard  database.  The  survey  was \nstrengthened  by  a  special  investigation  conducted  by  Guangxi  Geological  Environment \nMonitoring  Station  in  partnership  with  the  WLRB  and  the  concerned  district  governments  of \nWuzhou in the context of the 8 June 2006 disaster. \n \n\n4. \n\nStrengthened Mitigation Measures \n\n18. \nIn 2004, the GZARG approved the feasibility study prepared by the WMG for a program \nto control the major geohazard-prone areas in the three urban districts of Wuzhou. In line with \nthe  approved  feasibility  study,  detailed  design  and  implementation  of  specific  mitigation \nengineering projects have been redirected at rehabilitation of 125 spots that were hit hard in the \n8  June  2006  disaster.  The  WMG  has  earmarked  special  funds  for  geohazard  rehabilitation. \nCertified design institutes and contractors have been engaged to design and implement these \ngeohazard rehabilitation projects. In cooperation with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the \nWMG has also formulated a new project to prevent and control geohazards in Wuzhou, which is \nexpected  to  prevent  geohazards  through  holistic  urban  planning  and  integrated  public \ninvestment with lending support from ADB.  \n \n\n5. \n\nCommunity-Based Monitoring and Alarm System \n\n19. \nLike many cities in the PRC, the WMG has established a community-based geohazard \nmonitoring and alarm system based on the experiences and actions of the local residents. The \nsystem consists of (i) the leadership of the WMG; (ii) the specialized geohazard monitoring and \nemergency response agencies of the WMG, such as the geohazard monitoring and emergency \ncenter  at  the  WLRB;  (iii)  the  meteorological  monitoring  station;  (iv)  district  governments;  (v) \ncommunity leaders at the geohazard-prone areas; and (vi) households living in the geohazard-\nprone  areas.  The  system  is  alerted  by  weather  forecasts  and  mobilized  when  it  rains.  Every \nslope  in  the  geohazard-prone  areas  is  closely  monitored  under  the  system  through  mass \nobservations  to  identify  potential  movements  of  slopes  and  buildings.  Mandatory  evacuation \nmay be declared to move the people out of the immediate danger to a temporary shelter until \nthe original sites are rehabilitated. The media, including newspapers, radio, and television, are \nwidely  used  to  notify  the  public  about  geohazards,  and  educate  the  public  about  geohazard \nprevention  and  mitigation  methods.  Brochures  are  distributed  to  each  household  in  the \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\ngeohazard-prone  areas,  providing  detailed  instructions  on  the  evacuation  route  for  each \nresponse  and  coordination \nhousehold,  emergency \nresponsibilities  within \ninformation \ndissemination mechanisms.  \n \n\nthe  system,  and  emergency  contact  numbers  and \n\nreporting  mechanism,  emergency \n\n6. \n\nIncreased Investment \n\n \n\nfirst, \n\nMajor Challenges \n\nlimited  budgetary \n\n20. \nOver  the  past  few  years,  the  WMG  and  the  district  governments  have  invested  more \nthan  CNY130  million  in  geohazard  prevention  and  control  projects  at  138  sites  identified  as \nhazardous.  The  projects  have  included  cleaning  and  rehabilitating  the  drainage  systems, \nbuilding  slope  protection  and  retaining  walls,  and  carrying  out  geohazard  resettlement.  In \naddition,  about  CNY110  million  has  been  mobilized  from  commercial  sources  to  construct \nresidential  housing  facilities  in  the  geohazard-free  areas  to  accommodate  1,152  households \nrelocated from the geohazard-stricken areas. \n \nG. \n \n21. \nDespite increased funding from the WMG, the geohazard management system remains \nunderfunded.  In  many  geohazard-prone  areas  in  the  city,  thousands  of  urban  residents  live \nunder the direct threat of geohazard. Despite the obvious long-term benefits of prioritizing and \nfor  geohazard \nstrengthening  geohazard  prevention \nmanagement have to be allocated for immediate disaster relief and rehabilitation.  \n \n22. \nAlthough  traditional  engineering  measures  to  prevent  and  control  geohazards\u2014\nconstruction of slope protection and retaining walls\u2014are effective in some cases, they are not \nalways  the  optimal  way  to  address  geohazard  concerns.  Heavy  rains  may  wash  away  the \nconcrete  slope  protection  and  retaining  walls  together  with  the  housing  structures  along  the \nslopes, as was seen in the 8 June 2006 disaster.  \n \n23.  Wuzhou  has  many  low-quality  housing  structures  built  on  the  mountain  slopes  in  the \ngeohazard-prone areas, representing the city\u2019s highest vulnerability to geohazards. Most of the \nresidents in these geohazard-prone areas are from the low-income families, which are the least \ncapable  of  avoiding  geohazards.  They  need  public  investment  to  help  them  catch  up  with  the \ngeohazard-free and infrastructure-serviced living conditions available in other parts of the city.  \n \n24. \nBecause of the lack of knowledge on international best practice and inadequate funding, \na modern computer-based geohazard forecasting and early warning system, has not yet been \ndeveloped.  Such  a  system  could  effectively  supplement  the  community-based  geohazard \nmanagement system, enhancing geohazard prevention in Wuzhou. \n \n \n \n\nresources \n\n \n\n\f \n\nEXTERNAL

However,  according  to  Article  67  of  the  Law,  the  procurement  of  civil  works \nfinanced  by  ADB  may  apply  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Therefore,  the  NCB  under  the  proposed \nproject shall follow ICB procedures described in ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, subject to the following \nmodifications:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n \n(iii) \n\n(iv)  \n\n \n\nAdvertising.  Invitations  to  bid  may  be  advertised  in  Chinese  in  at  least  one  widely \ncirculated national daily newspaper and on a freely accessible, nationally known website. \nStandard  bidding  documents.  ADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents,  or  other \nbidding documents1 acceptable to ADB, shall be used. \nPrequalification of bidders. There is no prequalification of bidders in order to accelerate \nthe  bidding  process.  Post  qualification  is  applied  to  the  bidder  whose  bid  has  been \ndetermined to offer the lowest evaluated cost. The evaluation of a bidder\u2019s qualifications \nshall only take into account the bidder\u2019s capacity and resources to perform the contract, \nin particularly its experience and past performance on similar contracts, capabilities with \nrespect  to  personnel,  equipment  and  construction  or  manufacturing  facilities,  and \nfinancial position. In carrying out the post-qualification assessment, the executing agency \nand/or implementing agency shall exercise reasonable judgment in requesting, in writing, \nfrom  a  bidder  only  missing  factual  or  historical  supporting  information  related  to  the \nbidder's qualifications, and shall provide a reasonable time for the bidder to provide his \nresponse.  \nBid  evaluation  committee.  To  evaluate  the  bids,  the  executing  agency  and/or \nimplementing  agency  shall  establish  a  bid  evaluation  committee.  The  members  of  the \nthe  executing  agency  and/or \ncommittee  shall \nimplementing  agency,  tendering  company,  and  experts  who  are  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s \nprocurement requirements.  \n\nthe  representatives \n\ninclude \n\nfrom \n\n                                                 \n1 The  Borrower,  with  the  assistance  from  World  Bank,  is  preparing  a  set  of  model  bidding  documents  for  national \ncompetitive bidding under ADB- and World Bank-financed projects in the PRC. If these documents are accepted by \nADB, they will be used in NCB under the proposed project. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10     43 \n\n \n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \nThe Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project aims to improve the sustainability \n1. \nof urban development in Wuzhou and the living standards of its urban residents. The Project \nis  estimated  to  cost  $263.3  million,  of  which  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  finance \n$100.0 million, Wuzhou municipal government (WMG) $82.5 million, and China Construction \nBank  (CCB)  $80.9  million.  The  WMG  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  Project,  and \nDongtai  State  Assets  Operations  Corporation\u2014an  enterprise  wholly  owned  by  the  WMG \nspecializing  in  urban  construction\u2014will  be  the  implementing  agency  (IA).  The  WMG  will \nestablish a project management office (PMO) to manage and coordinate the implementation \nof the Project. \n \n2. \n \n\nThe Project will have three major components: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPingminchong valley geohazard resettlement and prevention.

The physical construction for the first two components will involve land acquisition \nand  resettlement,  while  the  geohazard  forecasting  and  early  warning  system  only  involves \ncapacity  building  component  with  no \nimpacts.  Full \nresettlement  plans  were  prepared  for  the  Pingminchong  component  and  the  Hongling \ncomponent.  The  primary  objective  of  the  resettlement  plans  are  to  ensure  that  the  investment \ncomponents improve the standards of living of affected persons, or at least do not leave them \nworse off.   \n \nB. \n \n2. \nIn  terms  of  resettlement  impacts,  the  construction  of  the  Project  will  affect  two  rural \nvillages,  two  urban  resident  communities,  and  one  village  administration  office  and/or  one \ntownship  and  two  districts.  Permanent  land  acquisition  will  affect  862  households  or  3,856 \npersons (including 635 urban employees, and 3,221 rural people). The demolition of residential \nwill  affect  about  2,015  households  or  7,081  persons  living  in  private  houses  under  the \nadministration of the resident and village committees. Meanwhile, 15 institutions, 16 enterprises, \nand seven shops with 1,751 persons will be relocated because of nonstructural demolishment. \nProject  construction  will  permanently  affect  2,393  mu  (667  square  meters)  of  state-  and \ncollective-owned  lands  will  be  affected  permanently,  of  which  272  mu  (11.37%)  is  cultivated \nfarmland. In addition, 188,038.13 square meters (m2) of residential houses and 25,022.01 m2 of \nnonresidential  structures  of  institutions,  enterprises  and  shops  (5,845  m2  used  for  residential \npurpose  and  19,177.01  m2  for  nonresidential  purpose)  will  be  demolished.  In  addition,  some \nproductive assets, ground attachments, and basic infrastructure and special facilities will also be \naffected.  Table  A11  summarizes  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.  Of  the  total \naffected  population,  383  households  or  1,091  persons  are  vulnerable  groups,  including  161 \nhouseholds  with  small  residential  area  less  than  12  m2  per  capita  118  households  headed  by \nwomen, 32 households with the disabled, 42 households living under minimum living guarantee \n(MLG),  and  26  households  with  \u201cfive  guarantees.\u201d 1  No  ethnic  minority  households  will  be \nadversely affected.  \n \n3. \nTo  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  local  officials  and  village \ncommittees and/or resident committees were consulted closely during the preliminary and final \nfeasibility study stages.  \n \nC. \n \nThe  resettlement  plans  comply  with  the  laws  and  regulation  on  resettlement  of  the \n4. \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995).  The  compensation  for  the  permanent  land  loss  is  based  on  the \nLand Administration Law of PRC (amended 2004), the State Council Decision to deepen reform \n\nPolicy and Legal Framework \n\n                                                 \n1  PRC's  social  assistance  system  includes  a  national  system  of  subsistence  allowances  through  the  \"five \nguarantees\"household subsistence program. Under this program, infirm and childless old people enjoy government \nsupport for food, clothing, medical care, housing and burial expenses. \n\n \n\n\f48         Appendix 11 \n\nand  strictly  enforce  land  administration  (document  28,  November  2004),  and  the  circular \nconcerning  certain  issues  regarding  strengthening  land  adjustment  and  control  (31  August \n2006).  The  house  demolishment  is  based  on  the  state  and  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous \nRegion  urban  housing  demolishment  administration  regulations.  Based  on  consultations  with \nlocal  governments  and  those  affected,  and  in  line  with  general  practice  in  Guangxi  Zhuang \nAutonomous  Region  and  Wuzhou  city,  a  set  of  compensation  standards  was  adopted  by  the \nproject  management  office  (PMO)  and  implementing  agency  (IA).  The  following  resettlement \nprinciples have been established for the Project: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nLand  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  should  be  avoided  or  minimized \nwhere feasible by developing and comparing a series of design alternatives. \nAll people residing, cultivating or making a living within the areas acquired for a \ncomponent  before  a  formally  recognized  cut-off  date  should  be  considered \naffected people who should receive compensation for all losses, including assets \nand  livelihoods,  regardless  of  land  tenure  and  property  right  status,  and  should \nbe entitled to rehabilitation assistance. \nCompensation  and  entitlements  provided  are  based  on  replacement  value,  and \nthey  must  be  adequate  to  allow  those  affected  to  at  least  maintain  their  pre-\nproject standard of living, with the prospect of improvement. \nA  preferential  policy  will  be  established  for  vulnerable  groups  in  terms  of \nrelocation \ncompensation,  minimum \nassistance. \nAll  affected  persons  will  be  adequately  informed  on  eligibility  for  compensation, \ncompensation  standards,  livelihood  and  income  restoration  plans,  and  project \ntiming. \nAffected persons will be paid compensation in a timely manner. \n\nliving  guarantee,  employment,  and \n\n(vi) \n(vii)  No land acquisition, demolition, or dispossession of assets will take place before \n\npayment of compensation to affected persons. \n\n(viii)  Resettlement costs will be included as part of project costs. \n(ix) \n\nClose monitoring and timely actions will be carried out to identify and resolve any \nproblems.  \n\nCompensation, Income and Livelihood Restoration Scheme \n\n \nD. \n \n5. \nFor  permanent  land  acquisition  of  farmland,  30%  of  land  compensation  will  be  paid  in \ncash  to  the  affected  villages  and  70%  of  land  compensation  to  the  affected  persons.  The \nresettlement  subsidy  and  compensation  for  standing  crops  will  be  fully  paid  to  the  affected \npersons.  For  residential  houses  and  nonresidential  structures  (institutions,  enterprises  and \nshops)  to  be  demolished,  compensation  will  be  paid  to  the  owners,  including  those  without \nhouse  certificates.  The payment  will  be  made  in  cash  according  to  the  appraised  value  of  the \nproperty.  The  households,  institutions,  enterprises,  and  shops  that  have  to  relocate  will  also \nreceive  a  relocation  allowance.  Compensation  for  standing  crops,  auxiliaries  and  other  assets \nwill  also  be  paid  directly  to  the  affected  persons.  Income  losses  resulting  from  reduced \nproduction  and/or  sales,  and  wages  caused  by  the  Project  will  be  compensated  in  cash.  The \nresettlement  strategy  encompasses  the  replacement  of  housing,  and  the  restoration  of \nlivelihoods  and  income.  People  losing  housing  will  have  two  resettlement  options:  (i) \nreplacement house at property rights exchange or (ii) to receive cash compensation. The PMO, \nIA,  resettlement  offices,  and  local  governments  will  provide  necessary  relocation  assistance \nduring resettlement implementation. \n \n\n \n\n\f Appendix 11       49 \n\nInformation Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance Procedures \n\nEconomic  rehabilitation  measures  include  (i)  provision  of  employment  opportunities \n6. \nduring project construction and operation; (ii) nonagricultural production, including development \nof self-employed secondary and tertiary businesses (i.e. clothing, grocery, transportation, cargo, \ncommunity  service,  repair,  hairdressing  salon,  beauty  salon,  dry  cleaner,  entertainment,  and \ncatering services); (iii) provision of technical training to affected persons to increase their skills \nto  be  employed  in  other  institutions,  enterprises  and  businesses;  and  (iv)  provision  of  social \ninsurance.  Relocated  institutions,  enterprises,  and  shops  will  be  provided  with  the  options  of \ncompensation and resettlement. The same institutions, enterprises, and shops will reemploy the \naffected employees, and no job losses are expected. Attention and assistance will be given to \ntheir special needs and expectations of vulnerable groups. The PMO and the IA will supervise \nimplementation  to  ensure  that  these  vulnerable  persons  receive  adequate  compensation, \nhousing arrangement, special funding and MLG, and assistance to restore their living conditions \nand incomes. \n \nE. \n \nIn accordance with the PRC\u2019s national, provincial and municipal policies and regulations \n7. \nfor  land  acquisition,  house  demolition,  and  resettlement,  together  with  ADB  policies  and \nguidelines,  the  PMO  and  the  IA  have  conducted  public  consultations,  negotiation,  and \ninformation  disclosure  sessions  with  the  affected  people,  villages  and  district  governments \nduring  the  project  preparation.  During  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group  discussions,  public \nconsultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  local  representatives  and \naffected people have participated in the planning and their concerns have been integrated into \nthe  resettlement  plans.  The  resettlement  information  booklets  were  distributed  to  affected \npersons  in  August  2008.  The  Wuzhou  municipal  government  (WMG)  and  concerned  district \ngovernments have implemented ADB\u2019s full disclosure policy for resettlement activities, including \n(i)  distribution  of  the  resettlement  information  booklets  to  the  affected  persons,  and  resident \ncommunity and village offices; and (ii) posting of the resettlement plans in Chinese at resident \ncommunity  and  village  offices,  as well  as  on  the  ADB  website  in  English  and  Chinese,  before \nappraisal and upon the approval and/or endorsement of WMG by the end of August 2008. The \nProject  IA  will  establish  project  resettlement  units  for  supervising  implementation,  continuing \npublic  consultation,  monitoring  resettlement  progress,  and  responding  to  grievances.  The \ngrievance  address  procedures  are  well  established,  and  explanations  are  included  in  the \nresettlement plans and information booklets. \n \nF. \n \n8. \nThe PMO and IA will have around 20 full-time staff responsible for land acquisition and \nresettlement.  The  staff  from  each  component  resettlement  unit  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating  the  planning,  implementation,  financing,  and  monitoring  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement by working closely with village and resident officials, land resource bureau, house \ndemolishment  administration  office,  and  other  organizations  involved  in  the  implementation  of \nthe  resettlement  programs.  They  will  also  be  responsible  for  supervising  and  monitoring \nresettlement  (e.g.,  delivery  of  entitlements,  relocation  and  selection  of  new  housing  sites, \nrestoration  of  incomes,  provision  of  economic  rehabilitation  measures).  The  resettlement \nmonitor engaged by the PMO will organize a training program for the resettlement officers.  \n \n9. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  precede  the  component  construction  schedules, \nwhich will occur between December 2008 and November 2012. Detailed measurement surveys \nwill  be  conducted  in  each  village,  residential  community,  institution,  enterprise,  and  shop;  and \nthe compensation contracts will be negotiated and signed with resident and village committees, \n\nInstitutional Arrangement and Implementation Schedule \n\n \n\n\f50         Appendix 11 \n\nhouseholds,  institutions,  enterprises,  and  shops.  Based  on  these  surveys,  the  resettlement \nplans will be updated and submitted to ADB for review and approval before the awarding of civil \ncontracts. All compensation and assistance will be delivered to the affected persons before civil \nworks  begin.  To  ensure  that  affected  persons  have  been  adequately  compensated  and \nrehabilitated,  the  WMG  and  IA  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  progress  in  implementing  the \nresettlement  plans  through  quarterly  progress  reports  until  resettlement  is  completed;  and  will \nprepare  resettlement  completion  reports.  The  PMO  will  engage  an  independent  monitoring \nagency  for  semiannual  monitoring  and  annual  evaluation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nuntil 2 years after land acquisition, resettlement implementation, and completion of resettlement. \n \nG. \n\nBudget \n \nThe preliminary cost estimate for the land acquisition and resettlement program is about \n10. \nCNY476.7  million  in  2008  prices,  including  contingencies.  The  estimated  costs  include \ncompensation  for  permanent  land  acquisition,  demolition  of  residential  and  nonresidential \nhouses  and  auxiliaries,  relocation  allowance,  basic  infrastructure  and  special  facilities,  other \ncosts,  land-related  taxes,  and  contingencies.  The  resettlement  costs  for  the  Pingminchong \ncomponent accounts for about 46.4% of the total land acquisition and resettlement cost, while \nthe Hongling component accounts for about 53.6%. The land acquisition and resettlement costs, \nwhich will be financed by the WMG, are included in the project cost estimates. The Government \nwill provide counterpart budget for resettlement activities, including support where fund shortage \noccurs during resettlement implementation. \n \nH. \n \n11. \nResettlement plan implementation will be monitored internally and externally. Monitoring \nmethodologies  are  specified  in  the  resettlement  plans.  Internal  supervision  and  monitoring  will \nbe done by IA to ensure compliance with the provisions of the resettlement plans. The PMO and \nIA  have  agreed  to  a  set  of  supervision  milestones  with  ADB  to  ensure  timely  and  effective \nimplementation of resettlement activities. An independent monitoring agency under contract to \nthe PMO will carry out external monitoring and evaluation. Monitoring and evaluation reports will \nbe  prepared  every  6  months  during  implementation  and  annually  for  2  years  after  the \ncompletion of resettlement. These reports will be submitted directly to ADB, the PMO, and the \nIAs, and will be uploaded to the ADB website.  \n \n\nMonitoring and Supervision \n\n \n\n\fTable A11: Summary Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts  \n\nEngineering Works \n\nPermanent Land Acquisition \n\nDistrict \n\nVC/RC \n\nTownship/ \nAdmin. \nOffice \n\nTotal \nArea \n(mu) \n\nOf which \nFarmland \n(mu) \n\nAffected Households \n(No.)a \nTotal  Urban\n\nRural \n\nAPs (No.)a \n\nTotal Urban  Rural \n\nResidential House Demolition \nof Individual Households \n\nStructure Demolishment of \nInstitutions, Enterprises and \nShops \n\nTotal Area \n(m2) \n\nAffected \nHHs (No.) \n\nAPs (No.) \n\nTotal Area \n(m2) \n\nQuantity \n(No.) \n\nAPsb \n(No.) \n\nLAR Costs \n(CNY million) \n\nWanxiu \n\nPingminlu \n\n289 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n130,851 \n\n1,816 \n\n5,707 \n\n19,410c \n\n18 \n\n1,116d \n\n221 \n\nProject \nComponents \n\nPingminchong \nGeohazard \nResettlement \nand Prevention \nHongling Road \nNetwork \n\nPingdong  \nand Pingxi \n\nLongxin \n\nLongping \n\nChangzhou  Xinlong \n\n1,725\n\n379\n\n126 \n\n146 \n\n534 \n\n328 \n\n534 \n\n328 \n\n \n\n \n\n635 \n\n \n\n1,793\n\n1,428\n\n57,187 \n\n289 \n\n1,374 \n\n5,612 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTOTAL \n\n \n\n \n\n  2,393 \n\n272 \n\n862 \n\n862 \n\n \n\n635 \n\n3,221\n\n188,038.13 \n\n2,105 \n\n7,081  25,022.01\n\nAP =affected person, HH = household, LAR = land acquisition and resettlement. \na The classification of urban or rural households and population is based on their household registration and population registration.  \nb The number of affected persons includes the employees, teachers and students. \nc The total area of nonstructure demolishment includes 5,845 m2 for residential use and 19,177.01 m2 for nonresidential use. \nd The number of affected workers for family-owned shops is included in the number of affected persons to be affected by residential structure demolishment. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n38 \n\n635 \n\n \n\n1,751\n\n255  \n\n \n476  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n1\n1\n \n\n5\n1\n \n\n\f52        Appendix 12        \n\nSUMMARY OF POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nCountry/Project Title: People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project \n\nLending/Financing \nModality: \n \n\nProject Loan \n\n \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nEast Asia Department \nSocial Sectors Division \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n\n \nWuzhou  is  a  less-developed,  medium-sized  city  of  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Region  in  western  PRC,  which  is \ntargeted by the Government for support under the National Strategy for Development of the West (NSDW). The city is \nat a critical stage of urban development, with the goal of developing into a multimodal regional transportation center \nto strengthen the economic integration between Guangxi and its neighboring western provinces with the fast-growing \nPearl River Delta\u2014one major growth engine in PRC. The Project will help the Wuzhou municipal government (WMG) \nin  addressing  its  geohazards,  which  are  a  major  development  constraint.  The  Project  will  help  free  thousands  of \npeople from the threat of geological disasters, promote sustained urban development, and improve the quality of life \nfor  486,000  residents.  The  Project,  which  will  introduce  an  innovative  approach  to  geohazard  management,  is \nenvisaged to play a demonstration role for many cities facing similar geological conditions in the PRC\u2014a country that \nsuffers losses of human life and economic property from geological disasters every year.  \n \nThe Project is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy (CPS) 2008\u20132010 for \nthe  PRC,  which  specifies  that  ADB  will  directly  support  sound  and  sustainable  urban  development  with  a  focus  on \nrelatively  underdeveloped  western  and  northeastern  regions.a  It  also  aims  to  make  markets  work  more  efficiently \nthrough (i) urban infrastructure development, (ii) promotion of environmental sustainability, and (iii) pro-poor equitable \nand inclusive growth. The Project will provide an enabling environment in Wuzhou for poverty reduction directly and \nindirectly by: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n(x) \n\nreducing the geohazard threat on life and property and associated economic losses; \nintroducing and establishing a geohazard forecasting and early warning system to strengthen the existing \ncommunity-based geohazard monitoring and management system; \nconducting  geohazard  prevention  and  control  measures  to  convert  geohazard-prone  areas  into \ngeohazard-free land for urban redevelopment; \nproviding  roads  and  related  basic  infrastructure  to  promote  and  facilitate  urban  expansion  away  from \ngeohazard-prone areas;  \nincreasing mobility and access for local populations to key basic services and destinations; \nsaving travel time, reducing vehicle operation costs, improving road safety and reducing traffic accidents; \nincreasing  employment  and  income-generation  opportunities  from  temporary  job  creation  during  the \nconstruction phase and permanent job creation during the operational phase;  \nproviding  basic  infrastructure  to  support  the  development  and  operation  of  the  city  as  a  regional \nmultimodal transportation center, thus creating new jobs and income generating opportunities;  \nincreasing the land and property values for local residents in the Project areas; and \nimproving  the  living  environment  and  quality  of  life  for  local  residents,  particularly  for  the  poor,  women, \nand other vulnerable groups who live in the geohazard-prone areas and are isolated from urban services \nfor historic reasons.  \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis             Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues \n \nWuzhou  is  a  mountainous  city  originating  on  a  small  plain  at  the  intersection  of  two  major  rivers.  Geographic  and \ngeological  conditions  severely  constrain  sustained  development  of  Wuzhou.  The  mountains  in  Wuzhou  are  formed \nfrom loose earth that is highly vulnerable to geological disasters such as landslides, slope collapses, and mud and \ndebris  flows.  Because  of  the  lack  of  infrastructure  to  support  urban  expansion  into  geohazard-free  lands,  the  city \nused to be confined to a small urban center where many low-income families built houses on marginal lands on the \nmountain slopes along the major valleys around the old urban center. Many of these densely populated valleys are \nclassified as geohazard-prone areas of the city. \n \nThe Project will benefit more than 468,000 urban residents in Wuzhou, of which 4.2% (or 20,410 persons) are poor \nand  living  under  the  minimum  living  guarantee  (MLG)  at  CNY195  per  capita  per  month.  The  urban  poor  mostly \nconsist of people with job laid-offs or unemployment, sickness, disabled family members, elderly, and low education \nlevels.  The  social  analysis  showed  that  these  poor  are  mainly  living  in  the  geohazard-prone  valleys  with  poor \ninfrastructure facilities and community services, where the population is densely concentrated. The housing and living \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12         53        \n\nenvironment are poor because of a serious water and soil erosion problem, environmental pollution, and fumes from \nwastewater and garbage in the air, which make people sick. More seriously, they often suffer from the loss of human \nlife,  and  property  damage  and  associated  economic  losses,  because  of  geological  disasters  such  as  landslides, \nmountain collapses, and mud and debris flows. During the rainy season, they live in fear of a possible geohazards \nevent.  The  insufficient  road  network,  and  the  resulting  limited  access  to  community  services  and  facilities,  adds  to \ntheir  isolation  from  urban  development  opportunities  and  their  overall  poverty  situation.  The  poor  living  in  the \ngeohazard-prone  valleys  are  among  the  least  capable  of  avoiding  and  coping  with  the  geohazards.  They  rely  on \npublic investment to help free them from the long-lasting geohazard threats and catch up  with the safe and secure \nliving conditions that become available in the geohazard-free areas of the city. \n \nUnder  the  NSDW,  the  Government  has  made  substantial  investments  in  transport  development  around  Wuzhou, \nincluding  three  expressways,  two  railways,  and  one  updated  river  transportation  system  along  the  rivers  flowing \nthrough  the  city.  The  aim  of  these  investments  is  to  strengthen  the  connectivity  of  Guangxi  and  the  neighboring \nprovinces, through the gateway city of Wuzhou, with national and international markets. Wuzhou is at a critical stage \nas it develops into a regional multimodal transportation center for Guangxi and the neighboring provinces. To achieve \nthis  development  objective,  Wuzhou  needs  to  first  address  the  geohazard  constraint  to  ensure  sustained  urban \ndevelopment,  which  will  benefit  not  only  the  residents  of  Wuzhou  but  the  overall  poverty  reduction  strategy  for \nGuangxi and the neighboring western provinces supported under the NSDW. \n \n2. Design Features \n \nThe Project will help Wuzhou address the geohazard constraint through holistic urban planning and integrated public \ninvestment.  The  Project  will  have  three  components:  two  investment  components  and  one  capacity  development \ncomponent. Under the Pingminchong  geohazard and resettlement component, the  Project  will  build a  well-serviced \nresettlement  community  in  a  geohazard-free  area  to  receive  about  6,823  people  (or  1,816  households)  to  be \nevacuated  from  the  geohazard-prone  Pingminchong  valley.  Although  these  are  beneficiaries  of  the  Project,  the \nGovernment  has  agreed  that  relocation  under  this  component  will  be  arranged  in  accordance  with  the  ADB \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). A resettlement plan has been prepared for this component. \n \nUnder the other investment component for Hongling road network and related infrastructure, the Project will build a \ncomprehensive  36.2-kilometer  urban  road  network  together  with  related  municipal  infrastructure  to  promote  and \nfacilitate  the  urban  expansion  into  the  geohazard-free  Hongling\u2014a  new  urban  area  between  the  newly  constructed \nrailway station and the fully developed urban area. A separate resettlement plan has been developed in accordance \nwith  the  ADB  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy,  which  will  guide  the  resettlement  under  the  Project  not  only  for  the \npeople to be affected by the  road construction itself but also the people living  in the neighboring urban lands to be \ndeveloped together with the road network. \n \nUnder  the  capacity  development  component,  the  Project  will  help  the  city  to  establish  a  geographic  information \nsystem  (GIS)-compatible  geohazard  forecasting  and  early  warning  system  to  supplement  the  existing  mass-based \ngeohazard monitoring and early warning system in Wuzhou. Consulting services will also be provided to strengthen \nthe public awareness of geohazard risk and its management through appropriate education programs.  \n    \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  more  than  486,000  urban  residents  of  Wuzhou.  About  49%  of  the  beneficiary \npopulation are women, 4.2% are classified as poor living under the MLG at CNY195 per month, and 2.4% are ethnic \nminorities scattered in the city. \n \nEmployment  Benefits.  The  Project  will  create  2,260  person-years  of  direct  short-term  jobs  during  the  project \nconstruction  phase,  and  570  direct  long-term  jobs  during  the  operation  phase.  In  addition,  about  10,100  short-  to \nmedium-term new jobs will be created upon the completion of the road network and related infrastructure in Hongling. \nMore jobs are also to be created in the logistics service in support of the operation of the railway station and other \ntransport infrastructure.  \n \nThe  WMG  has  agreed  that  priority  in  filling  jobs  should  be  given  to  vulnerable  groups  including  the  poor,  ethnic \nminorities, and women. Under this arrangement, an estimated 40% of short-term jobs during the construction phase \nwill  be  filled  by  vulnerable  groups\u2014about  20%  for  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities,  and  about  20%  for  women.  This \nindicates total earnings of CNY15.6 million. The same arrangement will be adopted for the long-term jobs during the \noperation phase, representing a total earning of CNY7.0 million. ADB and the WMG have agreed that ensuring jobs \nfor  the  vulnerable  groups  will  be  included  in  the  project  design  and  monitoring  framework  (DMF)  and  closely \nmonitored under the project performance monitoring system (PPMS).  \n\n \n\n\f54        Appendix 12        \n\n \nImprovement  of  Living  Standards.  Under  the  Project,  1,816  households  (or  6,832  persons),  about  52%  of  which \nare  low-income  families,  will  be  moved  out  of  the  geohazard-prone  Pingminchong  valley.  These  families  will  be \nprovided with an opportunity to resettle in a safe, secure, and well-serviced resettlement community to be constructed \nunder  the  Project  in  a  geohazard-free  urban  area.  Development  of  the  new  urban  area  of  Hongling  will  provide \nsufficient  geohazard-free  urban  lands  to  accommodate  about  100,000  residents.  The  road  network  and  related \ninfrastructure  built  under  the  Project  will  increase  their  mobility  and  access  to  basic  urban  services  for  local \npopulations, and remove one major constraint to urban development. The geohazard forecasting and early warning \nsystem  to  be  introduced  under  the  Project  is  expected  to  improve  the  accuracy  of  the  geohazard  forecasting  and \nearly warning service by 50% from the 2007 baseline, reducing significantly the risks to Wuzhou residents imposed \ngeohazards.  \n \nSupport  Gender  Inclusion.  Social  analysis  showed  that  women  are  primarily  responsible  for  cleaning  up  the \ncommunities and repairing the households after geohazard incidents. The Project will address these burdens. Gender \ninclusion is also secured and promoted through the priority accorded to women for jobs. \n \nEthnic  Minorities.  A  small  percentage  of  ethnic  minorities  (2.4%)  are  living  throughout  Wuzhou  city.  The  social \nanalysis  determined  that  they  are  socially  and  economically  integrated  with  the  majority  population  and  will  not  be \nsubject to any adverse impacts of the Project, including land acquisition and resettlement. The Project will prioritize \nthem for jobs. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1. The Project was formulated using various participatory methods and approaches for the poverty and social impact \nassessment,  including  500  respondents  random  sampling  socioeconomic  survey  in  the  project  areas,  stakeholder \nconsultation workshops, meetings, seminars, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews on issues related \nto  geohazard  resettlement,  geohazard  prevention  and  control,  and  development  of  urban  road  network  and  related \ninfrastructure  in  Hongling.  The  development  of  the  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  involved  two  rounds  of  public  consultation.  The  formulation  of  the  two  resettlement  plans \ninvolved  separate  socioeconomic  surveys,  community  meetings,  opinion  surveys,  and  specific  impact  studies.  The \nEMP and resettlement plans have set out detailed ongoing public participation plans. \n\n \n\n \n Yes  \n\n2. What level of consultation and participation is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n Information sharing    \n\n Consultation   \n\n Collaborative decision making   \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n3. Was a consultation and participation plan prepared? \n \nProject documents publicly disclosed at the project management office (PMO) of the WMG and on the ADB website \ninclude the project information document, design and monitoring framework, resettlement plans, summary EIA, report \nand recommendation of the President, public sector legal agreement, project administration memorandum, and social \nand environmental monitoring reports. Information booklets outlining the resettlement plans will be distributed to each \naffected household, and disclosure meetings will be held. Copies of the booklets will be made available at the PMO \nand each affected village office. To enhance the geohazard preparedness and environmental benefits of the Project, \nspecialized  consulting  services  will  be  provided  under  the  Project  to  strengthen  the  geohazard  and  environmental \nawareness  in  communities  through  the  existing  mass-based  geohazard  monitoring  and  early  warning  system  in \nWuzhou.  \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues: \n \nResults  from  the  household  survey  and  focus  group  discussion  indicate  that  women  are  primarily  responsible  for \ncleaning up the community and the affected houses after geological disasters, as well as for taking care of the sick, \nwounded, and elders, and for household-related traveling and socializing activities.  \n \nThe  Project  will  help  reduce  the  energy,  time,  and  efforts  spent  by  women  on  these  activities,  allowing  them  to \nengage  more  actively  in  income-generating  activities,  family  entertainment,  or  leisure.  The  poverty  and  social \nassessment indicates that women strongly support the Project across all of the components. Women have perceived \nthat the Project will improve their quality of life and create jobs and income opportunities for them. \n2.  Key Actions.  \n \n\n Gender plan    \n\n  Other actions/measures   \n\n No action/measure \n\n \n\n \n\n\fA Government assurance has obtained that women will be prioritized for jobs and skills trainings to be provided under \nthe Project. Under this arrangement, about 20% of the jobs will be filled by women during the project construction and \noperation  phases.  At  the  beginning  of  employment,  job  training  will  be  provided  to  vulnerable  groups,  including \nwomen. Core labor standards and HIV/AIDS awareness training are included for all contracts under the Project, as \nprovided in the loan assurances.  \n\nIII. \n\n \nIssue \nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \nSignificant \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n \n\nNo Impact \n\nSignificant \n\nLabor \n\n Employment \n     Opportunities \n\n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor standards \n \n\nAffordability \n\nLimited \n\nNo Impact \n\nand/or \n\nRisks \nOther \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman trafficking \nOthers (conflict, political \n\ninstability, etc), please \nspecify \n\nAppendix 12         55        \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n Full Plan \n Short Plan \n Resettlement \n\n   Framework \n No Action \n\n Plan \n Other Action \n Indigenous Peoples  \n\n   Framework \n No Action \n\n Plan \n Other Action \n No Action \n\n Plan \n Other Action \n No Action \n\n Plan \n Other Action \n No Action \n\nA resettlement plan for each \ninvestment component has been \nprepared in accordance with the \nPRC laws and regulations, and \nthe ADB Involuntary \nResettlement Policy.  \nEthnic minorities account for is \nsmall proportion (2.4%) of \nWuzhou city.

The  implementing  agency  for  the  Project  will  be  Wuzhou  Dongtai  State  Assets \nOperations Corporation on behalf of the Wuzhou municipal government (WMG). However, the \nWMG,  as  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  Project,  will  be  responsible  for  providing  counterpart \nfunds  through  equity  contributions  and  borrowing  from  China  Construction  Bank  (CCB).  The \nWMG will be the owner and operator of the facilities constructed under the Project and will be \nresponsible  for  debt  servicing.  Dongtai  will  manage  the  construction  of  the  Project,  including \nprocuring goods and works, and contracting consulting services.  \n \n2. \n\nThis appendix  \n(i)  \n\nreviews the past financial performance of the WMG together with the projections \nfor  future  revenue  inflow  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  finances  of \nthe WMG and its ability to provide counterpart funds and to meet debt servicing \nobligations;  \nassesses  the  financial  management  system  and  procurement  capability  of \nDongtai to implement and manage the Project; and  \nanalyzes  the  potential  and  feasibility  of  the  Project  to  establish  a  revolving \nfinancing mechanism for additional geohazard mitigation projects in Wuzhou.  \n\n(ii)  \n\n(iii)  \n\n \nB. \n \n\nWuzhou Municipal Government \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n3. \nThe  WMG  has  several  sources  of  revenue,  including  (i)  taxes  and  charges,  and \n(ii) transfers  from  the  central  Government  and  the  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Region \ngovernment  (GZARG)  in  the  form  of  budgetary  support  and/or  project  financing.  Taxation \nrepresents the largest form of overall revenue generated by the municipality, but much of this is \ncollected for the central Government. In line with the sustained economic growth, the local tax \nrevenues  retained  by  the  WMG  have  grown  from  about  CNY232.2  million  in  2002  to \nCNY474.0 million in 2007\u2014an average annual rate of 15.3% over 6 years.  \n \n4. \nApart  from  the  local  share  of  taxation,  the  WMG  has  revenues  from  the  state-owned \nenterprises and from the fees collected for municipal services, including education levies. Land \nsales, another important source of income, have increased rapidly from CNY21.3 million in 2002 \nto CNY708.5 million in the first half of 2008. In addition, transfers the form of budgetary support \nfrom the central Government and GZARG has increased significantly from CNY169.3 million to \nCNY321.2 million in that same period. \n \n5. \nAt  the  same  time,  the  central  Government  and/or  GZARG  have  invested  in  programs \nand  projects  for  implementation  by  the  WMG.  Funded  directly  by  the  central  Government  or \nGZARG,  they  are  not  regarded  as  discretionary,  but  nevertheless  reflect  financial  inflows  into \nthe municipality.

This \nrepresents  about  5.4%  of  the  WMG\u2019s  discretionary  revenue  in  2009,  with  a  declining  trend  to \nabout 3.8% in 2013 in line with the continued growth in the WMG\u2019s retained revenues. In terms \nof the proportion in the capital expenditures of the WMG (Table A13.3), the equity contribution \nfor  the  Project  will  account  for  about  3.7%  of  the  overall  capital  expenditures  at  the  peak  in \n2009.

The debt servicing will start at the highest level of CNY211.6 million \nin 2014, and will gradually decline to CNY161.1 million by 2019. The debt service will represent \n6.8% of the WMG revenue in 2014, and will gradually decline to 3.7% in 2019. As a share of the \ntotal  operational  expenses  of  the  WMG,  which  include  its  debt  servicing  obligations  for  all  the \noutstanding loans  and  debt  servicing  requirement  for  the  loans  from  ADB  and  CCB  under  the \nProject, the debt servicing obligations from the Project will represent 7.6% in 2014, declining to \n4.5% in 2019. These payments will represent about 69.5% of the surplus of the WMG in 2014. \nBased  on  these  analyses,  the  WMG  is  considered  capable  of  meeting  the  debt  service \nrequirements of the Project, without placing undue pressure on its other expenditures. \n \n\nTable A13.4: Wuzhou Municipal Government Impact of Interest and Principal Repayments  \n(CNY million) \n2014 \n211.6\n\n2018 \n171.2 \n\n2017 \n181.3 \n\n2016 \n191.4\n\n2015 \n201.5\n\nItem \nTotal Interest and Principal (Debt Service)\nWuzhou municipal government income \nDebt Service/Income (%) \nOperational Expenses \nDebt Service/Expenses (%) \nAnnual Surplus \nDebt Service/Surplus (%) \n\n6.8\n\n2019 \n161.1\n3114.1 3,322.5 3,549.4 3,796.3  4,065.0  4,357.2\n3.7\n2,804.2 2,944.4 3,091.6 3,246.2  3,408.5  3,579.0\n4.5\n425.8\n37.8\n\n5.6 \n371.0 \n48.9 \n\n4.8 \n\n4.2 \n\n6.1\n\n5.4\n\n7.6\n304.3\n69.5\n\n6.8\n324.7\n61.1\n\n6.2\n346.9\n55.2\nSource: Wuzhou Municipal Government and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n10. \nThe  counterpart  funding  requirements  and  debt  servicing  obligations  under  the  Project \nare considered reasonable as a percentage of the income and overall operational expenditures \nof the WMG, and are not likely to crowd out other programs.  \n \n \n \n \n\n5.0 \n397.3 \n43.1 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13        59        \n\nDongtai State Assets Operations Corporation \n\nC. \n \n\nBusiness Activities  \n\n1. \n \n11. \nDongtai  is  a  state-owned  enterprise,  wholly  owned  by  the  WMG.  Dongtai\u2019s  major \nbusinesses include (i) undertaking municipal development projects for the WMG; (ii) supervising \nand  managing  development  projects;  (iii)  collecting  rent  for  shops,  markets,  and  offices  on \nproperties that it owns; and (iv) conducting procurement for other government agencies. Dongtai \nis designated by the WMG as the implementing agency, which will be responsible for carrying \nout  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  Project,  including  procuring  goods  and  works,  and \ncontracting consulting services.  \n \n\n2. \n\nAssessment of Financial Management and Procurement Capability \n\n \nFollowing  ADB  guidelines  for  financial  management  assessment,2 an  assessment  was \n12. \nconducted  for  Dongtai,  which  showed  that  Dongtai  has  an  adequate  computerized  financial \naccounting  system  and  established  financial  management  procedures  to  document,  monitor, \nmanage, and report the flow of funds, operation transactions, and project physical progress.  \n \n13. \nA  similar  assessment  was  conducted  to  assess  the  procurement  capacity  of  Dongtai. \nThe  assessment  noted  that  Dongtai  has  a  procurement  department,  which  serves  as  a \ngovernment procurement center mainly for goods and equipment. The procurement department \nis equipped with proper office and equipment, including a computerized system for a staff of five \nprofessionals with experience to undertake public procurement following the Procurement Law \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n \n14. \nHowever, Dongtai has no experience in implementing foreign-funded projects. As such, \nDongtai  will  need  specialized  training  and  technical  support,  particularly  in  policies  and \noperational and procedural requirements of ADB, to implement the Project. Given the capacity \ndevelopment  component  included  in  the  Project,  Dongtai  will  receive  technical  support  for \ncapacity development and institutional strengthening, which is considered sufficient to ensure a \nsmooth project implementation.  \n \nD. \n \n15. \nAs  a  special  benefit,  the  Project  will  use  the surplus  from the  sale  of  the  reengineered \nland, after deducting the redevelopment costs, to establish a revolving funding mechanism for \nfuture geohazard management projects in Wuzhou. Under the Pingminchong valley geohazard \nresettlement and prevention component, 19.27 hectares (ha) of geohazard-free urban land will \nbe developed. After deducting the allowance for public infrastructure, such as roads, footpaths, \nand  reserves,  a  total  area  of  13.49  ha  (or  202.3  mu),  plus  50  mu  of  land  on  top  of  the \nPingminchong ridge, will become available for sale. At the estimated cost of CNY367 million for \nredevelopment  and  resettlement,  the  Project  is  expected  to  generate  a  surplus  of  CNY43.7 \nmillion if the land sale is at the current price of CNY1.6 million per mu for similar urban land in \nWuzhou. \n \n16. \nTable  A13.5  indicates  that  the  amount  of  surplus  is  sensitive  to  the  land  sale  price \nachieved. A land sale of at least CNY1.43 million per mu will ensure that the WMG will achieve \na surplus that could be applied towards establishment of the revolving funding mechanism for \n\nEstablishment of a Revolving Financing Mechanism for Geohazard Management \n\n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2005.

The \nEIRR is calculated separately for each of the two investment components under the Project\u2014\nPingminchong  geohazard  resettlement  and  prevention  component  and  the  Hongling  road \nnetwork and related infrastructure component\u2014and for the Project as a whole. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nPingminchong  Component.  The  economic  benefits  of  the  Pingminchong  component \nare  derived  from  a  comparison  between  \u201cwith  project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  scenarios.  The \nbenefits of the \u201cwith project\u201d scenario include (i) the avoidance of property damage and loss of \nlife loss because people were relocated out of the geohazard-prone valley, and the savings in \nthe maintenance cost for slope protection and retaining walls; and (ii) an increase in land values \nin  Pingminchong  because  of  the  engineering  treatment  to  be  conducted  under  the  Project  for \ngeohazard prevention. The economic benefits for the Pingminchong component are estimated \nat CNY263 million, measured in net present value (NPV). \n  \n3. \nThe  Pingminchong  component  is  proposed  and  designed  as  a  social  development \nproject with an emphasis on improving the living conditions of the people who live in this poorly \nserviced  and  geohazard-prone  valley.  This  will  be  achieved  by  moving  the  geohazard-\nthreatened  community  out  of  the  valley  and  relocating  them  in  a  well-serviced  resettlement \ncommunity  to  be  constructed  at  the  geohazard-free  urban  area  of  Zaochong.  Although  the \nbenefits from better living conditions are not included in the calculation of EIRR, such benefits \nare  estimated  to  facilitate  a  better  understanding  of  the  other  benefits  to  be  generated  by  the \nProject.  Using  the  difference  in  rental  prices  between  the  housing  in  the  geohazard-prone \nPingminchong  valley  and  those  in  a  resettlement  community  under  similar  socioeconomic, \ngeographic, and geological conditions such as Zaochong as a surrogate indicator, the benefits \nfrom better living standards are estimated at CNY275 million.  \n \n4. \nHongling  Component.  The  economic  benefits  of  the  Hongling  component  include \n(i) time  savings,  fuel  savings,  vehicle  operating  cost  savings,  and  accident  cost  reductions \nthrough the provision of a systematic road network for the Hongling area; (ii) increases in land \nvalues because of the municipal infrastructure to be provided under the Project; and (iii) faster \ngross domestic product (GDP) growth because of the improvement in infrastructure. Since land \nvalue  increases  are  conceptually  included  in  the  GDP  spillover,  they  are  not  included  in  the \ncalculation of EIRR for this component.  \n\n \n\n5. \nUsing a rate of return at 26.7% established in the recent literature on economic analysis \nfor investments in road infrastructure in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the net benefits \nto  nonagricultural  GDP  from  the  Hongling  component  are  estimated  at  CNY2.17  billion, \nmeasured in NPV.  \n \nApart from the general economic benefits related to infrastructure development (para. 5), \n6. \nthe  Hongling  component  will  also  bring  in  some  itemized  benefits,  particularly  by  providing  (i) \nbadly  needed  geohazard-free  urban  lands  to  accommodate  continued  urban  expansion  away \n\n \n\n\f62      Appendix 14 \n\nEconomic Costs \n\nGeneral Parameters \n\nidentified  relationship, \n\nis  calculated  separately  using  an  empirically \n\nfrom the geohazard-prone areas; and (ii) counterpart infrastructure in support of the operation of \nthe newly constructed railway station, which would not be able to start normal operation without \na  properly  developed  surrounding  urban  area  in  Hongling.  Although  not  included  in  the  EIRR \ncalculation, these benefits are estimated to facilitate a better understanding of the other benefits \nto be generated by the Project. The impact of the railway station and related investment on local \nGDP,  which \nis \nconservatively estimated at CNY2.63 billion.  \n \nC. \n \n7. \nThe  economic  evaluation  is  based  on  2008  prices.  As  cost  estimates  are  provided  at \n2008 prices, they do not require an adjustment for inflation. A shadow exchange rate factor of \n1.013 has been used to convert border prices to domestic economic prices. Similarly a shadow \nexchange  rate  of  $1  =  CNY7.01  is  adopted  to  calculate  the  economic  cost  of  the  principal \ntradable items. \n \nAll  the  cost  items  are  valued  at  domestic  prices  after  deduction  of  taxes  and  duties, \n8. \nexcept  for  (i)  unskilled  labor,  (ii)  fuel,  and  (iii)  the  capital  cost  of  vehicles.  Unskilled  labor  is \nvalued at a shadow wage rate of 0.80 (i.e., 80% of the estimated wage rate on the Project). The \neconomic opportunity cost of capital at 12% per year is adopted as the social discount rate for \nthe economic evaluation.  \n \nD. \n \nThe economic costs for the Pingminchong component include (i) the cost to build a well-\n9. \nserviced resettlement community at the geohazard-free urban area at Zaochong, (ii) the cost to \nrelocate the current households living in Pingminchong valley into the resettlement community \nat Zaochong, and (iii) the engineering treatment cost at the evacuated Pingminchong valley for \ngeohazard prevention. The economic costs for the Hongling component include (i) construction \ncosts, including land acquisition and resettlement; and (ii) operation and maintenance costs.  \n \nE. \n \n10. \nPingminchong  Component.  To  help  the  people  living  in  the  geohazard-prone \nPingminchong  valley  get  rid  of  the  long-lasting  geohazard  threat,  an  alternative  analysis  has \nbeen carried out between two general options of geohazard management: (i) strengthening the \ntraditional  approach  by  building  stronger  retaining  walls  against  geohazard  incidents,  or \n(ii) moving  the  geohazard-threatened  community  out  of  the  geohazard-prone  valley  and \nrelocating  them  to  a  well-serviced  geohazard-free  urban  area.  Experience  has  shown  that  the \ntraditional approach could not provide adequate protection for the residents in geohazard-prone \nvalleys  against  geological  disasters.  Despite  continually  building  and  rehabilitating  slope \nprotections and retaining walls over the past 50 years, Wuzhou experiences more than a dozen \nlandslides  and  slope  collapses  every  year.  In  extreme  weather,  rainstorms  wash  away  the \nconcrete  retaining  walls  together  with  housing  structures  built  on  the  mountains  slopes. \nResidents living in the geohazard-prone valleys experience several emergency evacuations with \nsevere  interruption  to  their  daily  life  and  livelihood  during  the  raining  season  from  June  to \nAugust each year.  \n \nCompared with the low level of protection and high recurrent costs for maintenance and \n11. \nrehabilitation of slope protection and retaining walls under the traditional approach, relocation of \npeople  out  of  the  geohazard-prone  valley  is  a  more  cost-effective  approach  to  freeing  people \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14       63        \n\nfrom the geohazard threat for good\u2014although it involves a  larger one-time capital investment. \nFurthermore,  under  the  Project,  the  evacuated  Pingminchong  valley  will  be  converted  into \ngeohazard-free land for urban redevelopment. The investment for Pingminchong component will \nnot  only  help  people  cope  with  geohazard  incidents,  it  will  also  help  Wuzhou  to  achieve  the \ncombined  goals  of  disaster  avoidance  and  prevention,  human  settlement  improvement,  and \nurban redevelopment.   \n \n12. \nHongling Component. Given the geographic and geological conditions of Wuzhou, the \ncity has only two directions for a relatively large scale of urban expansion: (i) to the south across \nthe  Xunjiang  and/or  Xijiang  River,  and  (ii)  to  the  west  on  the  north  bank  of  Xunjiang  and/or \nXijiang River. Expansion first into the west along the northern bank is the least-cost approach \nbecause  of  (i) its  proximity  to  the  existing  urban  infrastructure  facilities  and  urban  service \nnetworks available, and (ii) the additional costs of building bridges to facilitate urban expansion \nacross the Xunjiang and/or Xijiang River.  \n \nF. \n \n13. \nThe EIRR calculation takes into account only the main benefits from the two investment \ncomponents, but includes all the project-related costs. The EIRR for Pingminchong component \nis 19.3%, while the EIRR for the Hongling component is 20.9%.  \n \n14. \nThe EIRR for the Project as a whole is 20.7%. Sensitivity analysis was conducted for the \nEIRR of the Project as a whole. The analysis showed that the EIRR will decrease to (i) 19.1% in \nthe case of 10% cost overrun; (ii) 18.8% in the case of 10% decrease in the benefits; (iii) 18.1% \nif project implementation is delayed by 1 year; or (iv) 15.2% if all the adverse impacts of (i), (ii), \nand (iii) take place together. Table 14.1 shows the summary of the EIRR; Table 14.2 provides \nthe analysis under different scenarios.  \n \n\nCalculation of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n\nTable A14.1: Summary of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n\nComponent \nHongling road networks \nPingminchong hazard resettlement and prevention \nWhole project  \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nNPV (CNY million) \n634 \n69 \n697 \n\nEIRR (%) \n20.9 \n19.3 \n20.7 \n\nTable A14.2: Sensitivity Analysis of Economic Internal Rate of Return  \nfor the Whole Project \n\nChange in Values  NPV (CNY million) \n\nChange in Variables \nBase Case  \n(i) Capital Cost Overrun  \n(ii) Benefit Reduction  \n(iii) Implementation Delay  \n(iv) Combination of i, ii, and iii  \n\n0 \n10% \n(10%) \n1 year \n\n \n\n697  \n600  \n521  \n530  \n278 \n\nEIRR (%) \n20.7 \n19.1 \n18.8 \n18.1 \n15.2 \n\n    ( ) = negative. \n  EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f64      Appendix 14 \n\nDistribution Analysis and Poverty Reduction Impact  \n\nG. \n \n15. \nA  distribution  analysis  was  conducted  to  assess  the  distribution  of  the  benefits  of  the \nProject  among  the  major  stakeholders:  (i)  the  Government  and/or  economy,  (ii)  laborers,  and \n(iii) local households and/or consumers. \n \n16. \nCNY1,242.4 million, which is distributed among the major stakeholders in the following pattern: \n\nAt  the  social  discount  rate  of  12%,  the  net  gain  of  the  Project  is  calculated  as \n\n \n(i)  \n(ii)  \n(iii)  \n\nThe Government: CNY355.6 million (28.6%).  \nLaborers: CNY6.3 million (0.5%).  \nLocal  households  and/or  consumers:  CNY880.4  million  (70.9%).  Given  the \ndominance  of  civil  works  in  the  Project,  a  significant  part  of  the  net  gain  for \nlaborers will accrue to the unskilled laborers.  \n\n \n17. \nThe distribution analysis found that 13.4% of the net economic benefits from the Project \nwill accrue to the poor, who account for 4.2% of the urban population in Wuzhou. The analysis \nconcludes that the Project will play a significant role in promoting pro-poor economic growth.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 18 November 2008) \n", "Currency Unit\nCNY1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "yuan (CNY) \n$0.1465 \nCNY6.83 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nCCB \nEIA \nEIRR \nEMP \nFYP \nFYP-PCG \nGDP \nGIS \nGZARG \nIA \nICB \nLIBOR \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  MLG \nNCB \n \nNPV \n \nNSDW \n \nPMO \n \nPPMS \n \nPRC \n \nRP \n \n \nSEIA \n  WLRB \n  WMG \n \n", "implementing agency \ninternational competitive bidding \nLondon interbank offered rate \n", "environmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nfive-year plan \nfive-year program for prevention and control of geohazard \ngross domestic product \ngeographic information system \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  China Construction Bank \n\u2013 \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region government \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  minimum living guarantee \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  National Strategy for Development of the West \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  People\u2019s Republic of China \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Wuzhou Land Resources Bureau \n\u2013  Wuzhou municipal government \n", "resettlement plan \nsummary environmental impact assessment \n", "project management office \nproject performance monitoring system \n", "national competitive bidding \nnet present value \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "km2\nm2\n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "square kilometer \nsquare meter \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.  \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", "(i) \n \n(ii) \n \n", " \nNOTES \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n \n", "C.
