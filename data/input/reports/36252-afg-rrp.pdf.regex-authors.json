The  Project  has  four  components:  (i) \nintegrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM),  (ii)  water \nresources and irrigation development, (iii) agriculture and livelihood \nservices, and (iv) capacity development and project management. \n \nThe IWRM component will support technical studies for surface and \ngroundwater  to  improve  the  knowledge  base  to  manage  water \nresources in the Hari Rud River Basin. The Project also seeks to \nstrengthen the institutional frameworks and capacity for surface water \nallocation and groundwater management as a part of river basin \nmanagement. It will support the eventual formation of a river basin \nauthority in line with the water resources policy of the Ministry of \nEnergy and Water (MEW). The Project will support development of \nplanning and management options through the river basin authority \nto  allocate  water  resources  efficiently  and  equitably  for  basin \ndevelopment. \n \nThe  water  resources  and  irrigation  development  component  will \nprovide  for  the  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  (R&U)  of  55,000  to \n65,000  hectares  (ha)  of  traditional  irrigation  systems.  Traditional \nirrigation makes up over 80% of the irrigated area in Afghanistan; the \nsystems were developed by communities as long as 700 years ago. \nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  entire  systems  and  enhance  system \nintakes improving their capture efficiency and increasing late season \nwater supplies. The Project will also provide capacity development \nfor   MEW   staff   (the Irrigation Department)  as  well   as for  mirabs,\n   \n ", "  iii\n  who are the traditional community managers of irrigation systems \nand responsible for overseeing system management and operation \nand maintenance (O&M). The Project will also support development \nof small-scale water resources infrastructure. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  agriculture  and  livelihood  services  component  will \nensure that the improved water supply from the irrigation system \nR&U is used most effectively to increase the productivity of irrigated \nagriculture and that project benefits are equitably distributed. This \ncomponent will also ensure that farmers have viable alternatives to \npoppy production, although poppy is not widely grown in the western \nbasins. On-farm water management training will be given for farmers \nand mirabs. Agricultural extension will be provided to improve wheat \nyields  (the  primary  staple  crop  grown  by  most  farmers)  and  to \nstimulate second season, higher value horticulture crops. The Project \nwill  support  farmer  training,  demonstration  plots,  and  community-\ndeveloped  trials.  The  Project  will  provide  income-generating \nopportunities targeted at women and the landless through training, \nstart-up materials, and ongoing technical support. Possible activities \nwill  include  mulberry  and  sericulture  (silkworm  raising),  poultry \nraising, and livestock programs. \n \nGiven Afghanistan\u2019s severe capacity constraints, the Project will \nfeature  an  important  and  cross-cutting  capacity  development \ncomponent. The Project will provide training, equipment, and other \nresource  materials  for  ministry  staff,  mirabs,  farmers,  and \nparticipants in the livelihoods services activities. Both domestic and \ninternational education will be supported through the Project. \n \nRationale  Water  resources  management  and  irrigated  agriculture  are \nfundamental to the well-being of the national economy, the rural \nsector, and poverty reduction. Irrigated agriculture produces up to \n80% of total agricultural output, with agriculture comprising between \n50% and 60% of the national economy and employing up to 80% of \nthe  country\u2019s  population.  Farmers  throughout  the  country  have \ncited  lack  of  irrigation  water  as  the  primary  constraint  to \nagricultural productivity. A drought in 2004 caused the  projected \n16% annual   growth  in  gross    domestic  product  to  be  revised\n \n   \n ", "iv   \n  downward  to  8%  and  resulted  in  some  2.5  million  Afghans \n  experiencing  food  insecurity.  Developing  water  resources  and \n  improving  the  productivity  of  irrigated  agriculture  thus  are \nparamount  to  sustaining  economic  growth  and  addressing  rural \npoverty.  Agriculture  uses  95%  of  developed  water  supplies,  so \nenhancement of irrigated agriculture must be pursued in parallel \nwith strengthening water resources management. \n \nDecades of civil unrest have impeded maintenance and repairs to the \nexisting irrigation systems of the western basins, and they are in \nurgent need of assistance, with the entire canal networks needing \nR&U. The irrigation systems can also be rationalized to operate more \nefficiently and increase the total irrigated area. Canal intakes can be \nupgraded to increase capture of low season flows and to prevent \nflood damage and sediment deposition. Because of the degraded \ncondition of systems, cropping intensity in the western basins was \nonly 40% at the end of the severe drought from 1999 to 2001. Mirabs \nand communities have traditionally provided management and O&M \nfor the systems. However, given the extremely dilapidated condition \nof the irrigation systems, additional resources and technical support \nare needed beyond what the mirabs and community can provide to \n(i) return the systems to good condition to ensure that communities \ncan sustain their operation, and (ii) enhance their performance for \nmore productive irrigated agriculture. R&U of the systems will provide \nmore  reliable  water  supply  thereby  increasing  the  irrigated  area, \nimproving  yields  for  first  season  crops,  and  providing  for  more \nopportunities and better yields for second season crops.  \n \nImproving  the  management  of  surface  water,  groundwater,  and \nwater quality in the Hari Rud River Basin is critical to agricultural \nintensification  and  economic  growth.  Although  traditional  water \nallocations among irrigation systems exist, these allocations need to \nbe  rationalized.  Significant  groundwater  potential  exists,  but \navailable  information  is  inadequate  to  manage  its  sustainable \nexploitation.  An  improved  institutional  framework  and  capacity \ndevelopment are also required to manage such activities. \n \nFarmers have been living with uncertain water supply and thus \nengaging  in  relatively  low  productivity  agriculture  for  centuries. \nWheat is mainly planted in the winter or spring and is the primary \nirrigated  crop  taken  in  the  spring.  Yields  of  irrigated  wheat  are \ntypically low at 2.0 tons/ha in the Hari Rud River Valley, although \nrainfed yields are even lower at less than 1 ton/ha. Limited summer \ncrops are taken when and where water is available; in upstream \nareas rice is taken as a second crop in addition to vegetables. The \noutput of   vineyards   and  orchards  has   declined   due  to neglect \nduring  the  civil  unrest as  well  as  recent drought.  With  improved \n \n   \n ", "  v\n  irrigation systems and water supply, significant opportunities exist \nfor farmers to improve agricultural productivity through better on-\nfarm  water  management  with  better  agricultural  practices  from \nextension activities. \n \nIn  summary,  the  western  basins  have  significant  potential  for \nagriculture  intensification  through  R&U  of  existing  irrigation \nsystems, and exploitation of groundwater. However, farmers need \nassistance  to  manage  water  most  effectively  and  agricultural \nsupport take advantage of cropping opportunities. \n \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  will  improve  rural  livelihoods  through  strengthened \nIWRM,  improved  irrigation  service  delivery,  and  enhanced \nagricultural  practices  to  increase  the  productivity  of  irrigated \nagriculture  in  the  western  basins.  The  primary  project  impacts \ninclude (i) improved IWRM and water management, (ii) R&U and \ndevelopment of irrigation and water resources infrastructure, (iii) \nenhanced support for improved agricultural productivity and rural \nlivelihoods,  and  (iv)  developed  capacity  and  strengthened \ninstitutional frameworks for IWRM and irrigated agriculture. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $87.6  million  equivalent \nincluding  taxes  and  duties  at  $4.8  million  and  interest  during \nimplementation  at  $1.9  million.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is \nestimated  at  $34.3  million  and the  local  currency  cost at  $53.3 \nmillion equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nAsian Development Bank Loan  29.7  30.8  60.5 \nAsian Development Bank Grant  4.6  9.9  14.5 \nProject Participantsa  0.0  7.8  7.8 \nGovernmentb  0.0  4.8  4.8 \n  Total  34.3  53.3  87.6 \na  Contribution of communities for labor. \nb  Local taxes and duties. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nLoan Amount and  A loan of $60.5 million and a grant of $14.5 million (total $75.0 \nTerms  million  equivalent)  will  be  provided  from  the  Special  Funds \nresources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The loan will \nhave a 40-year term including a grace period of 10 years, and \ninterest rate of 1%. \n ", "vi   \n  The ADB funding will finance $34.3 million of the foreign exchange \ncost and $40.7 million of the local currency cost. The community \nwill fund $7.8 million equivalent of the local costs through in-kind \nlabor. The Government is not required to directly contribute to the \nproject cost but will provide $4.8 million for taxes and duties. The \nADB ADF grant will be used to support (i) the mirab development \nand O&M subcomponent of the project, and (ii) the agricultural and \nlivelihood services component, which provide critical value addition \nto development impact and poverty reduction as part of the Project. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  30 September 2016 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance  \n   \nImplementation  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency. The \nArrangements  implementing agencies will be MEW; Ministry of Agriculture, Animal \nHusbandry,  and  Food;  and  Ministry  of  Mines  and  Industry.  Two \nproject committees will be formed: (i) a project steering committee in \nKabul, co-chaired by either the minister or deputy minister of MEW \nand  MOF,  to  provide  policy  guidance  and  review  project \nperformance; and (ii) a project implementation committee, chaired by \na representative from the governor\u2019s office in Herat and comprising \nhigh-ranking  technical  officers  from  line  agencies,  provincial \nauthorities,  project  consultants,  and  development  partners.  The \ncommittee  will  coordinate  project  implementation  and  technical \nissues.  MEW  will  establish  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  in \nHerat  to  direct  all  project  activities  and  reporting.  The  PMU  will \ninclude project consultants and staff of MEW and the ministries of \nagriculture,  animal husbandry, and  food; finance; and  mines and \nindustry. The PMU will be housed within the MEW office in Herat and \nwill serve as the base for project activities in the lower Hari Rud River \nBasin. In addition, the PMU will oversee all financial management, \ncontracting, reporting, and safeguard issues. A project office with a \ndeputy project director will be opened in Obe, Herat Province, for \nactivities in the upper Hari Rud River Basin and possibly in Badghis \nProvince for the Murghab Basin. The PMU will maintain an office in \nKabul with a deputy project director to coordinate project activities \nwith MEW headquarters until such capacity exists within MEW. \n   \n ", "  vii\nProcurement  Procurement financed from the ADB loan and grant proceeds will \nbe  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement. \nInternational competitive bidding (ICB) procedures will be used for \nprocuring  civil  works  costing  over  $1  million;  local  competitive \nbidding (LCB) procedures for works estimated to cost $1 million or \nless; and direct purchase/single tender procedures may be allowed \nfor  civil  works  costing  $100,000  or  less.  LCB  civil  works  will  be \nprocured from prequalified bidders based on the Government\u2019s \nexisting  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Subprojects  works \ninvolving numerous structures or activities may be bundled into \ncontract packages for procurement through ICB or LCB. Civil works \nless than $500,000 may be completed through in-kind contribution \nfrom local communities. Vehicles, equipment, and materials will be \nprocured under ICB procedures where the estimated cost is more \nthan $500,000, by international shopping where the estimated cost \nis between $300,000 and $500,000; and through LCB procedures \nacceptable to ADB where the estimated cost is $300,000 equivalent \nor less. Small or off-the-shelf goods and materials valued at less \nthan  $100,000  may  be  procured  using  direct  purchase \narrangements. \n \n  Retroactive approval procedures will be adopted for LCB civil works \ncontracts.  For  the  first  six  contract  packages  under  LCB  and \ninternational  shopping,  the  PMU  will  submit  the  procurement \ndocuments and bid evaluation for ADB review and approval before \nawarding the contract. If ADB finds the documents and evaluation \nsatisfactory,  procurement  and  contract  award  for  subsequent \ncontract packages can take place without prior ADB approval. The \nPMU  will  retain  a  record  of  all  procurement  documentation, \nincluding  copies  of  the  signed  contract  and  the  bid  evaluation \nreport, for inspection during ADB project supervision missions or on \nrequest. The procurement processes and contract awards will be \naudited annually as part of the performance audit. If any contract \naward  is  found  unacceptable,  ADB  may  refuse  to  finance  the \ncontract. \n   \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  require  an  estimated  892  person-months  of \nconsulting services: 468 international and 424 domestic. This input \nreflects the support required to implement the Project as well as to \nprovide  necessary  capacity  development.  Nongovernment \norganizations  will  be  contracted  as  needed  to  support  project \nactivities through procedures acceptable to ADB. Consultants will \nbe selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nselecting domestic consultants. Consulting firms will be recruited \nthrough full or simplified technical proposals using quality and cost-\nbased selection procedures. To the extent possible, prequalified \nnongovernment organizations will be contracted on the basis of \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n   \n ", "viii  \nProject Benefits and  The  project  benefits  include  (i)  improved  management  of  water \nBeneficiaries  resources in the western basins for sustainable economic growth; \n(ii) increased irrigated area for spring season wheat; (iii) increased \ncropping  intensity  for  second  season  horticulture;  (iv)  increased \nyields for wheat, fodder, and horticulture; (v) improved livelihoods to \nreduce  the  risk  of  poppy  cultivation;  (vi)  more  secure  irrigation \nsystems with reduced risk of structural failure; (vii) improved water \nresources  management  and  efficiency  at  all  levels;  and  (viii) \ncapacity development for ministry staff, mirabs, farmers, and other \nproject stakeholders. About 400,000 persons (about 20% of the \nwestern basins\u2019 population) are expected to benefit from Project; \nabout 80% of these are classified as poor or very poor. In addition, \nmany project participants will be landless sharecroppers. \n \nThe Project as a whole yields an economic internal rate of return of \n17%;  irrigation  subprojects  developed  during  project  preparation \nhad returns from 12% to 22%. For the average poor farmer whose \nlandholding  is  0.8  ha,  the  net  increase  in  annual  income  is \nestimated to be $234 or a 117% rise mainly from improved wheat \nproduction. For many families, the incremental production will be \nconsumed  directly  and  thus  will  significantly  improve  household \nfood security and nutrition. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Security. The overall political and security situation in Afghanistan \nremains not fully stable, although the majority of the western basins \nis one of the most secure areas in the country. The Project will \nrequire vigilant monitoring and close coordination with the United \nNations and local authorities to ensure project-related security. \n \nContracting of Civil Works. Due to the prolonged civil unrest and \nstagnation  of  construction  in  the  area,  concern  exists  that  local \ncontracting capacity will not be adequate to execute civil works \nwithin the time frame, costs, and required standards for the Project. \nThe  Project  will  use  a  variety  of  contracting  and  procurement \nmethods  including  ICB  packages  to  attract  contractors  with  the \nexperience needed to ensure timeliness and quality of construction. \nThese larger international firms are expected to partner with local \nfirms and thus develop capacity in the private sector. \n

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan, \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Western Basins Water \nResources Management Project (the Project). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Water resources management and irrigated agriculture are fundamental to the well-being of \nthe national economy, the rural sector, and poverty reduction in Afghanistan. Irrigated agriculture \nproduces up to 80% of agricultural output with agriculture comprising between 50% and 60% of the \nnational economy and employing about 80% of the population. Farmers throughout the country \nhave cited lack of irrigation water as the primary constraint to agricultural productivity, and deficit \nrainfall in 2004 caused the projected 16% annual growth in gross domestic product to be revised \ndownward to 8% and resulted in 2.5 million Afghans facing food insecurity. Developing water \nresources  and  improving  the  productivity  of  irrigated  agriculture  is  paramount  to  promoting \nAfghanistan\u2019s economic growth and addressing rural poverty(Appendix 2). Agriculture uses 95% of \ndeveloped water supplies, so enhancement of irrigated agriculture must be pursued in parallel with \nstrengthening water resources management.1 \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  The Western Basins. Badghis, Ghowr, and Herat provinces comprise the western basins. \nWith the exception of Herat City, the districts in the western basins are nearly 100% rural with over \n2 million people. Up to 30% of rural households are landless, up to 80% consider themselves poor \nor very poor, and the average farm size is less than 1 hectare (ha). The Hari Rud and Murghab \nRivers are the largest in western Afghanistan; together their basins cover 78,000 square kilometers \n(12% of Afghanistan). The two rivers provide 3 billion cubic meters of annual water runoff, split \nalmost equally between the two basins, and flow into Turkmenistan with the Hari Rud River Basin \nfirst traveling along the border with Iran. The Hari Rud River Basin is far more developed and \nincludes Herat City. Runoff comes from snowmelt with high flood flows from March to June and \nvery low flows from August to February. For irrigation, discharge is excess in the spring and deficit \nin the summer. Farmers have adapted their irrigation and agricultural practices to this flood regime. \nThe  Hari  Rud  River  Basin  has  significant  groundwater  potential,  which  has  been  largely \nunexploited. Installation of shallow and deep wells is increasing and will accelerate as incomes \nrise.  Although  the  use  of  groundwater  offers  tremendous  opportunity,  insufficient  information \ncurrently exists to quantify the impact of its development and to manage it. \n \n4.  Irrigated Agriculture. The Hari Rud River Basin contains some of the most extensive \nirrigated areas in Afghanistan. Local communities developed the irrigation systems to provide \nwater for irrigation, livestock, and domestic use over 500 years ago, and they have sophisticated \nwater allocation methods. The western basins have about 300,000 ha of irrigated area, of which \n170,000 ha are intensively irrigated with 110,000 ha (63% of intensive irrigation) found in the lower \nHari Rud River Basin.2 Most of the intermittently irrigated areas are located in the upper Hari Rud \nRiver Basin (62%). Smaller systems are scattered in the upper Hari Rud and Murghab River \nBasins. System size is mainly a function of water availability (accessibility and reliability) and land \nsuitability (soil type and topography).  \n                                                 \n1   The Project was prepared under TA 4420-AFG (Asian Development Bank. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Islamic \nRepublic of Afghanistan for Preparing the Western Basins Water Resources Management and Irrigated Agriculture \nDevelopment Project. Manila) cofinanced by the Government of Canada. \n2  Statistics used for Afghanistan are uncertain. \n ", "2   \n5.  Wheat is the primary crop grown in irrigated areas and is taken as the first season crop. \nFodder is the next most common crop, accounting for 10% of irrigated areas. In areas with secure \nwater supply, higher value second season or perennial crops are grown including rice, orchards, \nvineyards, and vegetables. In rainfed areas, opportunistic crops of winter wheat and fodder are \ngrown with little opportunity for anything else. Wheat yields are low in irrigated areas in the western \nbasins, with an average of about 2 tons per ha (t/ha), and even lower in rainfed areas. The low \nyields are related to insecurity of water supply, which directly limits yields, and also provides a \ndisincentive for farmers to invest in inputs. Currently, very little poppy is grown in the western \nbasins and improving productivity of irrigated agriculture and enhancing livelihood opportunities will \nensure poppy cultivation remains limited. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n6.  Ministry of Energy and Water. The Ministry of Energy and Water\u2019s (MEW\u2019s) Irrigation \nDepartment is responsible for irrigation development and managing the country\u2019s water resources. \nGiven the past 30 years of civil unrest, the capacity of the MEW is limited, especially in provinces \nand districts where few trained or experienced technical staff are available. As of mid-2005, the \nIrrigation Department in Herat had a technical staff of four engineers, all with limited experience \nand  training.  The  department  lacks  trained  administrative  and  management  staff,  has  little \nequipment such as computers or vehicles, and has essentially no operational capacity outside \nHerat  in  the  western  basins.  Rehabilitation  and  upgrading  (R&U)  of  irrigation  systems  and \ndevelopment of water resources in the western basins have tremendous potential to stimulate the \nlocal economy and improve rural livelihoods, yet this requires signification additional capacity and \nsound management to ensure sustainability and maximum development impact. \n \n7.  Irrigation Infrastructure. The irrigation systems of the western basins are in urgent need \nof assistance, with entire canal networks requiring major R&U due to decades of civil unrest that \nhave  impeded  routine  maintenance  and  repair.  The  deterioration  of  system  infrastructure  is \nexacerbated  by  the  area\u2019s  flood  hydrology,  which  creates  a  constant  need  to  protect  and \nrehabilitate canal intakes, canals, and adjacent farmland against floods, erosion, and sediment \ndeposition.  Because  of  the  traditional  nature  of  the  irrigation  systems,  few  modern  control \nstructures exist, and current water distribution is achieved through rudimentary diversion structures \nthat are often temporary and makeshift leading to inefficiencies. These irrigation systems can be \nrationalized to operate much more efficiently and to increase the irrigated area. Canal intakes can \nbe upgraded for greater capture of low season flows and to prevent flood damage and sediment \ndeposition. As a result of unreliable supply of water and the degraded condition of irrigation \nsystems, cropping intensity in the western basins was only 40% at the end of the severe drought \nfrom 1999 to 2001. R&U of the systems, especially the intakes, will provide more reliable water \nsupply,  increase  conveyance  efficiency,  and  improve  water  control  and  management,  thus \nincreasing  irrigation  intensity,  improving  yields  for  first  season  crops,  and  providing  more \nopportunities for second season and perennial crops. About 30 primary irrigation systems exist in \nthe lower Hari Rud River Basin with an average size of about 2,000 ha and many smaller schemes \nare found throughout the basin. \n \n8.  Traditional Irrigation Management. Traditional irrigation systems (all surface irrigation in \nthe western basins is traditional) comprise over 80% of the irrigated area in Afghanistan and \ncommunities continue to be responsible for management, and operation and maintenance (O&M). \nLocal communities select mirabs3 who manage the system, water distribution, and O&M with the \nsupport of community labor. Mirabs may serve for many years and the position may be passed \nfrom generation to generation. A hierarchy usually exists with one senior mirab responsible for the \n                                                 \n3  Mirabs are community water managers responsible for traditional irrigation schemes. \n ", "      3\nentire irrigation system and other lower-level mirabs responsible for distributaries and minor canals. \nThe role of the mirab may require full-time service for a large portion of the year, with mirabs \nusually receiving an in-kind fee from each year\u2019s harvest. The mirabs receive no formal assistance \nfrom  the  Government,  although  they  may  collaborate  with  the  Irrigation  Department  or  other \nauthorities on an ad-hoc basis to execute O&M or other rehabilitation projects. The financial and \nother resources at their disposal are meager. O&M is provided by community labor with hundreds \nor thousands of men in labor gangs undertaking annual irrigation system maintenance. Although \nthis management system has worked well for generations, the extremely dilapidated condition of \nthe irrigation systems necessitates additional resources and technical support to the mirabs and \ncommunities  in  order  to  (i)  return  the  systems  to  good  operating  condition  to  ensure  that \ncommunities can sustain their performance, and (ii) enhance their performance for more productive \nirrigated agriculture. Women play no direct role in irrigated agriculture and have very limited control \nover water or other productive resources due to the conservative patriarchal society. Women are \ntraditionally consigned to household tasks and may be involved with home gardens or livestock \nactivities. \n \n9.  The mirabs would benefit from training in areas of basic engineering to support O&M, \nimproved  water  management,  and  introduction  of  more  efficient  irrigation  technologies  and \nmethods.  Strengthening  the  mirabs  by  improving  accountability  and  transparency,  developing \nbusiness and financial management capacity, and establishing their legal status will help them to \nmobilize additional resources and to become more effective in their tasks. However, the mirabs \nhave provided robust irrigation management and O&M for centuries, and any proposed technical or \ninstitutional changes to traditional irrigation systems must explicitly recognize and accommodate \nthe mirab system to ensure success. \n \n10.  Water Resources Management. The policy framework for integrated water resources \nmanagement (IWRM) and irrigation is being developed. The Strategic Framework for the Water \nSector was finalized in May 2004 and approved by the Cabinet; it is consistent with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) water policy.4 In 2004, the Government also issued water resources and \nirrigation policies. The objective of the irrigation policy is to develop and manage irrigation systems \ncost-effectively;  ensure  technical,  social,  institutional,  and  environmental  sustainability;  and \npromote user participation in local water management to ensure an overall increase in production \nand productivity of agriculture. MEW is currently drafting a revised water law that will be approved \nin  2006.  Although  the  policy  framework  is  being  established  with  external  funding  support, \ndeveloping implementation arrangements and the capacity, especially at the regional level, to \napply the policies pose a challenge. MEW staff currently do not have adequate skills, and basic \nhydrological data has not been collected for the past 25 years.5 The Irrigation Department has \ndynamic leadership and is committed to capacity development and modern water management; \nhowever, establishing effective water management institutions requires a long-term commitment. \n \n11.  River Basin Management. Developing optimum approaches to river basin management is \nimportant to maximize investment benefits and assess equity trade-offs. Water allocation options \nneed to be evaluated and agreements reached regarding the sharing of water among irrigation \nschemes and water users. MEW has committed to develop river basin authorities (RBAs) to \nmanage Afghanistan\u2019s water resources. Adopting a river basin approach is essential for the Hari \nRud River Basin due to substantial investments, including development of the Salma Dam being \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n5  The hydro-meteorological network is currently being reestablished under the World Bank\u2019s Emergency Irrigation \nRehabilitation Project. \n ", "4   \nfinanced by the Government of India.6 Other agencies will need to be involved to ensure broad \nacceptance of water allocation; for example, the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and \nFood (MAAHF); Ministry of Mines and Industry (MMI); mirabs; and the wider community. The RBA \ncan provide a vehicle to develop consensus to manage water allocation, but the institutional \nframework and capacity need development. \n \n12.  ADB Framework and Rationale. ADB has provided strong support to irrigated agriculture \nand water resources using ADB\u2019s three-pronged approach for Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction: build \ncapacity, establish an appropriate institutional framework, and rehabilitate essential infrastructure. \nADB\u2019s Agriculture Sector Program7 loan provides the policy framework to manage and develop \nagriculture  and  natural  resources,  and  to  guide  ADB  sectoral  interventions.  The  Project  was \ndeveloped within and supports this policy framework. ADB\u2019s other sector interventions include (i) \nEmergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project,8 (ii) Balkh River Integrated \nWater Resources Management Project,9 (iii) component 1B.1 of the Technical Assistance (TA) for \nWater Resources Management and Planning,10 and (iv) the forthcoming advisory TA (December \n2005), Capacity Building for Water Resources Management (Appendix 3).11 \n \n13.  Lessons Learned. ADB, European Commission, United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, World Bank, and other development partners have irrigation and water resources \nprograms in Afghanistan that provide the following lessons: (i) MEW capacity is limited in both skills \nand  availability  of  personnel;  (ii)  contracting  procedures  and  the  contracting  industry  is \nunderdeveloped in parts of the country; (iii) although capacity development is critical to ensure \nproject  sustainability,  ample  resources  are  required  in  the  short  term  to  ensure  project \nimplementation; and (iv) continuous dialogue with MEW in Kabul is necessary to ensure project \ncoordination (Appendix 4). Experience in Afghanistan has demonstrated the importance of quickly \ndelivering  project  benefits,  while  the  preparation  of  more  complex  activities  ensues.  ADB\u2019s \nexperience with irrigation and water resources has demonstrated the importance of a participatory \napproach to project implementation. Given the strong tradition of community irrigation management \nin Afghanistan, lessons from ADB\u2019s Bali Irrigation Project12 demonstrate the importance of explicitly \nworking within and strengthening traditional irrigation management when introducing any project \nintervention. If this is not done, not only is project success jeopardized, but the traditional systems \nthemselves may be weakened, lowering overall sector performance. \n \n                                                 \n6 The Salma Dam is a multipurpose project financed by the Government of India to be built approximately 160 kilometers \neast of Herat City. \n7  ADB. 2004.

The Project will improve rural livelihoods through strengthened IWRM, improved irrigation \nservice  delivery,  and  enhanced  agricultural  practices  to  increase  the  productivity  of  irrigated \nagriculture in the western basins of Afghanistan. The primary project impacts include (i) improved \nIWRM  and  water  management,  (ii)  R&U  and  development  of  irrigation  and  water  resources \ninfrastructure,  (iii)  support  for  improved  agricultural  productivity  and  rural  livelihoods,  and  (iv) \ncapacity  development  and  strengthened  institutional  frameworks  for  IWRM  and  irrigated \nagriculture.  The  Project  has  four  components:  (i)  IWRM,  (ii)  water  resources  and  irrigation \ndevelopment, (iii) agriculture and livelihood services, and (iv) capacity development and project \nmanagement.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n1.  Integrated Water Resources Management  \n15.  Improving IWRM in the Hari Rud River Basin is critical to its development due to the \nimportance of water to basin livelihoods, deficiencies in data to support decision making, and lack \nof existing capacity for effective management. The IWRM component has three subcomponents: (i) \ntechnical investigations and studies, (ii) water allocation and planning, and (iii) IWRM institutional \nand capacity development.13 \n \n16.  Technical Investigations and Studies. Technical activities in support of IWRM and basin \nmanagement will include (i) surface water investigations, (ii) groundwater investigations, and (iii) \nestablishment of basin management information systems. The Project will review ongoing hydro-\nmeteorological programs to identify additional data requirements for improved basin management \nand project implementation. It will develop and apply methodologies and procedures to prepare \ninventories of surface water sources and their catchments, abstractions from the Hari Rud River \nBasin, and irrigated areas to provide the basis for the basin simulation modeling. The Project will \nprovide equipment and establish monitoring procedures for surface water quality consistent with \ninternational protocols and standards. \n \n17.  The Project will establish a groundwater exploration and monitoring network based on an \ninventory of existing groundwater wells, springs, and karez;14 and by installing monitoring wells \nthroughout the Hari Rud River Basin. This will support development of an integrated groundwater \nand surface water model for assessing sustainable groundwater yields and conjunctive use and to \nmaintain karez and spring flows. Alternative irrigation technologies such as drip, sprinkler, and \nplastic piping will be installed on plots associated with monitoring wells and at commercial farms to \ndemonstrate water-efficient irrigation options. \n \n18.  The Project will support establishment of information systems to manage technical and \nadministrative  data  for  management  of  basin  resources  (including  surface  and  groundwater). \nGeographic information system activities started during project preparation will be expanded to \nintegrate basin information including (i) water resources infrastructure, (ii) surface and groundwater \ninformation,  (iii)  environmental  data,  and  (iv)  land-use  data.  This  will  support  watershed \n                                                 \n13  IWRM activities will be fully established within the Hari Rud River Basin. They will be initiated within the Murghab River \nBasin to the degree necessary. Given the limited development and lack of infrastructure, the need for formal basin \nmanagement is less imperative in the Murghab River Basin. \n14  A karez is an indigenous water supply system that captures subsurface flow by tunneling horizontal shafts into the side \nof hills or mountains. \n ", "6   \nmanagement and basin planning. The Project will develop communications mechanisms to support \nbasin management objectives. \n \n19.  Water Allocation Planning. The Project will undertake water allocation planning studies \nthat  will  incorporate  additional  data  and  assessments  as  they  become  available  through  the \nProject. Project specialists will work with MEW and other stakeholders to define options for water \nallocation. Outcomes from the studies will support both technical options to optimize water use and \ndefine  institutional  and  management  options  to  allocate  water.  The  Project  will  support \ndevelopment of basin master plans. \n \n20.  IWRM Institutional and Capacity Development. Optimizing the use of Hari Rud water and \nfacilitating  agreements  among  basin  water  users  has  significant  productivity  and  equity \nimplications. Within 1 year, the Project will help MEW establish a management cell in Herat, \nsupported by a basin water committee (BWC) with representation from MEW, MMI, Ministry of \nFinance  (MOF),  Ministry  of  Rural  Reconstruction  and  Development  (MRRD),  provincial  and \nmunicipal authorities, mirabs, and other stakeholders to advise, plan, and execute the technical \nand  institutional  functions  for  basin  management.  With  project  support,  MEW  will  evaluate \ninstitutional arrangements, supported by staffing, physical plant, and resources to develop an RBA. \nThe BWC will develop a system of surface water entitlements based on traditional allocations and \nregister  the  entitlements  by  the  end  of  the  Project.  The  Project  will  develop  a  groundwater \nregulatory framework consistent with Government policy by the end of the Project to manage \nsustainable development of basin groundwater and to protect karez and spring water supplies. \n \n21.  Capacity development and expertise for technical and institutional aspects of IWRM will be \nsupported to ensure that basin management can be sustained after the Project. MEW staff will be \ntrained for technical and planning functions to serve as a secretariat to the BWC and eventual \nRBA. The IWRM component will include a public awareness subcomponent to (i) inform residents \nof water and basin issues, (ii) promote efficient water resource management and use, and (iii) \ncommunicate basin objectives to water users. \n \n2.  Water Resources and Irrigation Development \n22.  The Project will support R&U of irrigation, strengthening of irrigation service delivery and \naccountability consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy (footnote 4), and development of water resources \nthrough four subcomponents: (i) irrigation R&U in the Hari Rud River Basin, (ii) irrigation R&U in the \nMurghab Basin, (iii) water resources development, and (iv) mirab development and O&M. The \nProject will ensure that traditional allocations and distribution methods are preserved during the \nR&U unless otherwise supported by the community. R&U and development of all subprojects will \nbe  fully  participatory  with  mirabs  and  the  community  involved  in  the  identification,  design, \nmanagement, and O&M of the civil works. The community will provide in-kind contribution to \nsubprojects as well as agree to abstain from poppy cultivation and to sustain O&M. Women will be \nconsulted and confirm the positioning and design of nonirrigation infrastructure such as bridges. \nDue to Afghanistan\u2019s limited capacity, evolving policy framework, and weak investment planning, \nan ADB sector loan is not possible. However, given the number of irrigation schemes requiring \nR&U in the western basins and the need for flexibility with project implementation in Afghanistan, a \nsector-like approach will be used for subproject selection based on criteria with an indicative \ninvestment plan to be refined during the Project (Appendix 5). \n \n23.  Irrigation  R&U  in  the  Hari  Rud  River  Basin.  The  subprojects  for  irrigation  schemes \nprepared during the project preparatory TA provide a representative sample of the Project\u2019s R&U \n ", "      7\nactivities.15 The following are indicative types of R&U interventions to be financed under the Project: \n(i) improved intakes for greater capture efficiency, (ii) rehabilitated and improved control structures, \n(iii) bifurcations and drop structures, (iv) siphons, (v) aqueducts, (vi) cross drainages, (vii) canal R&U \nand rationalization, (viii) river training and bank protection, (ix) vehicle and pedestrian bridges and \nimproved access to canals for nonirrigation water needs, and (x) drainage. \n \n24.  Historically,  the  design  and  management  of  traditional  irrigation  systems  have  worked \nadequately; however, more efficient irrigation management control and water conveyance options \nexist. The Project will work with mirabs and communities to demonstrate options to enhance \nsystem  performance  including  (i)  improved  intakes,  control  structures,  and  canal  profiles;  (ii) \nenhanced flexibility of irrigation deliveries to meet demand; and (iii) better distribution and rotation \nscheduling. The Project will demonstrate the benefits of improved operational options while training \nmirabs and communities, so they can adopt and benefit from new technologies and management \ntechniques. However, community acceptance is necessary before any technical or management \nchanges  will  be  undertaken  through  the  Project.  Long-term  capacity  development  will  also \nempower mirabs and communities to execute ongoing system improvements themselves. \n \n25.  In year 1, project interventions will commence with detailed design and contracting of the \nthree core subprojects prepared during the TA and will be expanded to other systems throughout \nthe Hari Rud River Basin. During years 1 to 3, the Project will survey and inventory the larger \nsystems in the Hari Rud River Basin to facilitate prescreening of subprojects for R&U as well as to \nprovide data for the surface water investigations in component one. Following the surveys and \ncommunity consultations, final subproject selection will take place followed by detailed design and \nconstruction. An estimated 45,000 ha will receive R&U. \n \n26.  Irrigation  R&U  in  the  Murghab  River  Basin.  By  year  2  of  the  Project,  a  detailed \ninvestigation of the Murghab River Basin will be initiated to prioritize investment options and \ndevelop an implementation strategy. This investment plan will be finalized by year 5. The technical \ninterventions in the Murghab River Basin will be similar to the Hari Rud. The Murghab River Basin \nmay offer more opportunities to develop new irrigation and water resources infrastructure since it is \nless developed than the Hari Rud River Basin. An estimated 10,000 ha will receive R&U. \n \n27.  Water Resources Development. A number of possible subprojects were identified that \nhave potentially large benefits for communities such as new irrigated areas, flood control, water \nsupply, and small storage works. The Project will provide expertise to investigate and develop \nthese subprojects. An investment plan for subprojects under this subcomponent will be started in \nyear 2 and be completed by year 5. The Project will produce designs, contract packages, and work \nplans. Emphasis on a participatory process and the terms of community participation will be the \nsame under this subcomponent as with irrigation R&U.16 \n \n28.  Mirab Development and O&M. Strengthening mirabs and communities is necessary to \nimprove  irrigation  management  and  ensure  effective  and  sustainable  O&M.  However,  project \nactivities must not erode the effectiveness or legitimacy of the existing institutions. The Project will \npromote institutional strengthening with the following objectives: (i) increase capacity for O&M, (ii) \nprovide technically enhanced irrigation systems; (iii) improve agricultural productivity, (iv) increase \naccess to resources for system management and O&M (moving from an informal in-kind payment \nsystem to a fee-for-service approach), and (v) strengthen the legal status of mirabs. Although the \nmirabs and communities already serve as an autonomous irrigation service provider, the Project \n                                                 \n15  The three subprojects include rehabilitation of the Jui Nau Canal, and Sari Pul and Yahia Abad systems.  \n16  If viable subprojects cannot be identified, funds in this subcomponent will be used for additional irrigation R&U up to \n6,500 ha equivalent works. \n ", "8   \nwill work to enhance the transparency, equity of water distribution, and accountability of irrigation \nservice provision. The Project will establish a core technical training program and assistance \npackage for the mirabs to accompany the physical rehabilitation; it will include training for (i) O&M \nand minor repairs, (ii) water distribution and management, (iii) improved structures and basic \nirrigation system design principles, (iv) irrigation and crop scheduling, and (v) system monitoring \nand evaluation (M&E). In addition to the core program, mirabs and communities that complete the \ntraining will receive equipment for minor O&M and improved mobility and communications. Support \nwill also be available for initial incremental O&M expenditures and to strengthen mirab institutions \nwhile they develop O&M and financial plans. \n \n29.  The  Project  will  support  development  and  adoption  of  a  stronger  institutional  and  legal \nframework to underpin the mirabs based on traditional practices. The process will be gradual and \nundertaken only with the consent of the mirabs and communities.17 Actions will strengthen individual \nsystem development, yet will seek to federate mirab institutions and include their formal participation \nin river basin management. The Project will support development of enabling policies and training as \nneeded and desired by mirabs and communities to address (i) election procedures, (ii) bylaws and \nrules for differing  mirab levels within a federated structure, (iii)  methodologies for defining and \nmanaging irrigation service collections and payment, (iv) financial auditing, and (v) dispute resolution. \nExperience from international best practice with water user associations will help provide benchmarks \nand lessons for mirabs to adopt these more formalized procedures, as well as to ensure mirabs can \nprovide sustainable and accountable irrigation management. The Project will provide mirab training \nfor (i) financial management, (ii) business planning and marketing, and (iii) literacy. \n \n30.  After  training,  the  Project  will  offer  on-demand  technical  and  institutional  development \nassistance  to  meet  individual  community  needs  since  capacity  development  and  institutional \ngrowth are long-term activities. These services will help farmers with O&M problems as well as \nencourage new technical and management strategies after initial R&U and basic training. The \nservice  will  provide  backstopping  as  mirabs  take  on  a  broader  and  more  intensive  scope  of \nactivities. The project approach is to be flexible and iterative. The primary objective is to ensure the \nmirabs and communities maintain governance and authority over system O&M and management, \nwhile capacity, institutions, and the systems improve. Outputs from the mirab development and \nO&M subcomponent will include a (i) mirab capacity development program; (ii) policies, rules, and \nregulations to help strengthen the institutional framework for mirabs; and (iii) ongoing technical \nsupport to assist the mirabs.18 \n \n3.  Agriculture and Livelihood Services \n31.  The  agriculture  and  livelihood  services  component  will  (i)  assist  farmers  in  exploiting \nopportunities from a more reliable water supply, (ii) ensure that farmers have viable alternatives to \npoppy cultivation, and (iii) ensure equity in project benefits. The agriculture and livelihood services \ncomponent  has  three  subcomponents:  (i)  on-farm  water  management  (OFWM),  (ii)  enhanced \ncropping opportunities, and (iii) poverty and gender livelihood opportunities. In year 1, MAAHF, with \nproject support, will conduct a farm survey in the Hari Rud River Basin project area to analyze (i) \ncurrent  cropping  practices,  (ii)  yield  information,  (iii)  farm  budgets,  (iv)  irrigated  agriculture \npractices, (v) land tenure arrangements, (vi) on-farm irrigation practices, (vii) input and marketing \ninformation,  (viii)  women\u2019s  participation  in  rural  households,  and  (ix)  constraints  to  irrigated \nagriculture, among others. This information will be essential to (i) develop the OFWM program \n                                                 \n17  The National Water Law, which is currently being revised, provides for the development of legally established water \nuser associations. Project activities will be consistent with national policy; however, the project approach will be to \nallow mirabs and communities to determine their institutional and financial arrangements.  \n18  Indirect outputs will include O&M plans, irrigation schedules, and financial management and business plans. \n ", "      9\nsubcomponent  and  options  for  system  scheduling,  (ii)  identify  promising  options  and  delivery \nmechanisms for the enhanced cropping opportunities subcomponent, (iii) provide accurate baseline \ninformation for project M&E, (iv) stimulate awareness and provide information to farmers about the \nProject, and (v) assess demand for irrigation water. \n \n32.  On-Farm  Water  Management.  The  OFWM  subcomponent  provides  the  link  in  water \nmanagement between the canal and field, and will provide the following: (i) improved conveyance \nand application within the farm field; (ii) crop water requirements and the application implications \nunder a more reliable water supply; (iii) linkages to overall scheduling; (iv) options and technology \nto enhance demand responsiveness and flexibility of irrigation; and (v) orchard, vineyard, and \nvegetable water management. MAAHF has responsibility for OFWM and will lead implementation \nwith project support. Subcomponent activities will be closely integrated with the mirab development \nprogram and offered to farmers in subproject areas. The Project will provide (i) mobilization, \ntraining, and resource materials; (ii) technical and management demonstration activities with land \nleveling, furrow strips, farm storage, and other activities; and (iii) extension and support services. \n \n33.  Enhanced Cropping Opportunities. System rehabilitation and improved management will \nprovide more reliable irrigation supply that will provide opportunities for farmers to (i) increase \nwheat yields and cropping intensity, (ii) take advantage of second season or perennial crops, and \n(iii) diversify into higher value cropping. The subcomponent will target horticulture crops including \nsecond season vegetables, orchard and vineyard production, and fodder to increase livestock \nproduction which is vital to rural communities in the project area. Improved wheat production will be \ngiven emphasis since it is the most prevalent crop and will benefit the greatest number and poorest \nfarmers. The Project will provide information on input usage and other productive investments that \nfarmers may be more willing to make due to improved water supply, as well as provide training for \nmarketing and processing. The services will be offered to farmers, nurseries, and seed growers in \nsubproject areas.  Activities  will include  (i)  training  and  resources  materials,  (ii) demonstration \nactivities,  (iii)  farmer  extension,  and  (iv)  community-developed  trial  proposals.  Subcomponent \nactivities will be coordinated with the OFWM activities and the mirab training to (i) help mirabs and \ncommunities develop improved water and cropping scheduling, (ii) improve water use efficiency, \nand (iii) maximize crop productivity. \n \n34.  Livelihood Opportunities for Women and the Landless. This subcomponent will provide \nopportunities for poor individuals who do not own land and for women in subproject areas, targeting \nhouseholds headed by women. The Project will provide assistance for rural income-generating \nactivities. MAAHF, with project and nongovernment organization (NGO) support, will develop a \nmenu of options for delivery to communities. Some activities already have a history and proven \nsuccess in Afghanistan and include (i) mulberry and sericulture (silkworm raising), (ii) poultry \nproduction, and (iii) livestock assistance. The Project will provide (i) training, (ii) start-up materials, \nand (iii) extension and technical support services. \n \n4.  Capacity Development and Project Management \n35.  Capacity  Development.  Although  capacity  development  is  integral  for  all  project \ncomponents,  capacity  development  is  a  specific  subcomponent  to  ensure  it  is  appropriately \nresourced and managed in a coherent fashion. Capacity development activities will be provided for \n(i) MEW, MAAHF, and future RBA staff from the project area; (ii) select MEW staff from Kabul and \nother regions; (iii) trainers and NGOs that will deliver project services; (iv) mirabs; and (v) project \nparticipants. The capacity development subcomponent will provide the following: (i) formal training \nand educational courses of varying lengths in Afghanistan and abroad,19 (ii) on-the-job training, (iii) \n                                                 \n19  Up to 30 people are expected to be supported for international graduate training. \n ", "10   \ninstitutional strengthening and policy development, and (iv) physical resources and equipment to \nenhance capability and effectiveness. Initial domestic training will be provided for MEW and project \nstaff to ensure adequate skill levels to take advantage of more advanced training. Initial training will \nalso serve as a screening opportunity to select more qualified candidates for international training. \nHerat University will help facilitate, participate, and provide some of the capacity development \nactivities.  Capacity  development  not  only  includes  training,  but  is  much  broader  to  include \ninstitutional strengthening; policy development; structuring incentives; and helping to clarify the \nlong-term  roles,  responsibilities,  and  authorities  of  the  mirabs,  MEW,  and  other  sector \nstakeholders.  The  Project  will  work  to  define  the  most  effective  irrigation  sector  institutional \narrangements  including  a  provisional  long-term  staffing  plan  for  MEW,  and  provide  capacity \ndevelopment  to  support  the  various  roles  for  sector  stakeholders.  As  capacity  is  developed, \nnational ministry staff will play a more active role in project activities. \n \n36.  Project  Management.  This  subcomponent  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) that will be staffed with ministry/project professional and technical staff, \ninternational and domestic consultants, supporting NGO staff, and administrative and support staff. \nThe PMU will be responsible for (i) direction and coordination of project activities; (ii) procurement, \naccounting, and financial control; (iii) environment, social assessment, and resettlement; and (iv) \nM&E. The Project will include management and liaison staff in Kabul. \n \nC.  Asian Development Fund IX Grant Component \n37.  Afghanistan is a postconflict country where average per capita gross national income is less \nthan $1.00 a day. Providing grant assistance is essential to assist Afghanistan make the transition \nfrom postconflict to peace and stability. The Asian Development Fund (ADF) support for the ADB \ncontribution to the Project is a blend of $14.5 million grant and $60.5 million loan. The use of the \ngrant financing is vital to the redevelopment of irrigated agriculture and the national economy, and \nis  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  in  that  it  supports  natural  resource \nmanagement  and  relies  on  building  capacity,  establishing  appropriate  policy  and  institutional \nframeworks, and rehabilitating essential infrastructure. The Project first appeared in the country \nstrategy and program in 2003. Specifically, the grant will be used to support the agricultural and \nlivelihood  services  component,  and  the  mirab  development  and  O&M  subcomponent,  which \nprovide critical value addition to development impact and poverty reduction as part of the Project. \nThe grant funds will be managed with the same oversight as the ADB loan funds, and separate \nM&E of grant funded activities will be undertaken. \n \nD.  Special Features \n38.  Integrated Basin Approach. The Project takes an integrated approach. Components 1, 2, \nand 3, work together to improve water management from the basin to the farm by (i) creating an \nimproved knowledge base for optimal resource management, (ii) improving technical options and \ninfrastructure, and (iii) strengthening management and institutional frameworks at all levels. The \nProject  addresses  management  of  surface  water,  groundwater,  and  water  quality  to  ensure \nsustainable development. The integrated approach will achieve higher agricultural productivity, \nimproved water use efficiency and distribution equity, and sustainable water resource utilization.  \n \n39.  Capacity Building and Effective Implementation. Capacity building is integral to achieve \nand sustain project outcomes and is essential to ensure Afghanistan\u2019s development. The Project \nexplicitly addresses capacity development with both formal and informal training, TA, and provision \nof  necessary  resources  for  project  stakeholders.  However  effective  capacity  development  of \ntechnical skills to implement the Project will take time, and given that project activities must \ncommence upon loan effectiveness to ensure that early benefits are realized, resources will initially \nneed to be contracted locally and/or regionally to support technical services and implementation. \n ", "      11\nThese locally or regionally procured services will be phased out as capacity develops and MEW \ncan assume a greater share of project responsibilities. \n \n40.  Alternative  Livelihoods.  The  Project  provides  support  for  alternative  livelihoods  by \nproviding  TA  to  the  landless  and  women,  enabling  them  to  successfully  engage  in  income-\ngenerating activities. Although poppy is not currently cultivated in most of the project area, project \nactivities will provide farmers with viable livelihood opportunities to ensure they do not become \ninvolved in poppy production in the future. \n \n41.  Special Terms. Substantial continued aid assistance will be required for the recurrent \nbudget over the medium term. Recurrent Government expenditures for FY2005 amount to $609 \nmillion, while revenues are expected to amount to about $256 million, which means that almost \n60% of recurrent expenditures will have to be financed by foreign assistance. The capital and \ndevelopment budget for FY2005 of $4,068 million is to be financed entirely by external funding \nagencies. A recent International Monetary Fund report expressed serious concern about the fiscal \nsustainability of the Government payroll and security expenditures, and highlighted the importance \nof continued assistance from external funding agencies.20 The ADF lending terms from the ADB \nBoard of Directors, while generous, are not sufficient for sustainable development of Afghanistan. \nThe Government requested more concessional funding for its transition and reconstruction phase. \nThis loan is proposed to be made on the following concessional terms: (i) grandfathering pre-1999 \nADF lending terms so that the loan has a 40-year maturity including a 10-year grace period, with a \n1% interest charge throughout this period, and (ii) capitalizing interest during the grace period.21 \n \nE.  Cost Estimates \n42.  The total project cost is estimated at $87.6 million equivalent inclusive of taxes, and duties \nat $4.8 million, and interest during implementation at $1.9 million (Table 1). The foreign exchange \ncost (including interest) is estimated at $34.3 million, and the local currency cost at $53.3 million \nequivalent (Appendix 6 and Supplementary Appendix A). \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nForeign  Local   \nItem  Total Cost \nExchange  Currency  Percent \n1.

Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan Afghanistan for the Postconflict \nMultisector Program. Manila). \n ", "12   \nF.  Financing Plan \n43.  The Government has requested a loan of $60.5 million and a grant of $14.5 million (total \n$75.0 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the Project. The loan \nwill have a 40-year term, including a grace period of 10 years, and an interest charge of 1% per \nannum. The total amount of the interest charge during the grace period will be capitalized and \ncharged to the loan account. The ADB loan and grant will finance $34.3 million of the foreign \nexchange costs and $40.7 million of the local currency costs (Table 2). The community will fund $7.8 \nmillion equivalent of the local costs through in-kind labor. Under ADB\u2019s special lending terms, the \nGovernment is exempt from directly contributing to the project financing exclusive of local taxes and \nduties, which will be paid by the Government.22 The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Percent \nAsian Development Bank Loan  29.7  30.8  60.5  69 \nAsian Development Bank Grant  4.6  9.9  14.5  17 \nProject Participantsa  0.0  7.8  7.8    9 \nGovernmentb  0.0  4.8  4.8    5 \n  Total  34.3  53.3  87.6  100 \na  Contribution of communities for labor. \nb  Local taxes and duties. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n44.  Executing Agency. The MOF will be the Executing Agency for the Project. MEW (Irrigation \nDepartment), MAAHF, and MMI are the implementing agencies. MEW (Irrigation Department) will \nbe responsible for irrigation and water resources management and development. MAAHF will be \ninvolved in the delivery of the agricultural support services. MMI will collaborate with MEW in \ncarrying out groundwater activities. MEW, MAAHF, and MMI have few staff, most with limited \ncapacity and their ability to support the Project is minimal. However, the Project will require about \n75 technical and professional staff. Both MEW and MAAHF have agreed to work with ADB and the \nproject consultants to identify and depute professional and technical staff to not only support the \nProject,  but  to  establish  and  sustain  the  Irrigation  Department  and  the  RBA  after  project \ncompletion. If staff cannot be identified and deputed, they will be recruited and hired under the \nProject and by year 3 of the Project, MEW and MAAHF have agreed to sanction the posts and take \nthe staff on as permanent employees. The Project will train the staff for assignment to MEW and \nRBA staff positions in Herat or locations determined by the Government after project completion. \n \n45.  MEW will establish a PMU within 3 months of effectiveness in Herat with representation from \nMAAHA, MEW, MMI, MOF, and the project consultants.23 The PMU will be housed within MEW in \n                                                 \n22  Cofinancing is currently being pursued with the Government of Canada for a $15 million grant and with the Islamic \nDevelopment Bank for a $10 million interest free loan. Once this or other cofinancing is confirmed, ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds loan resources will be canceled and an equal amount substituted with cofinancing funds. The Government has \nbeen consulted and confirmed this arrangement. \n23  By project completion, the PMU will have been mainstreamed, and the Project will have established capacity and an \norganizational structure within the Irrigation Department in Herat to effectively execute its long-term role in the sector, \nwhich will be better defined through the Project.  \n ", "      13\nHerat, which will also serve as the base for project activities in the lower Hari Rud River Basin. By \nyear 1, the PMU will establish (i) a project office in Obe, Herat Province, for project activities and civil \nworks in the upper Hari Rud River Basin,24 and (ii) a project office in Kabul to coordinate activities \nwith MOF and MEW until MEW has sufficient capacity to do this. MEW will appoint a dedicated \nproject director in Herat within 3 months of effectiveness as well as deputy project directors in Obe \nand Kabul within 3 months of the opening of those offices.25 The project director will report to the \nMEW deputy minister. The PMU will provide overall interagency coordination for project activities and \nwill be responsible for consultants/NGO recruitment, procurement, financial management, reporting, \nsafeguard compliance with ADB policies, and M&E. Apart from the project director and two deputy \nproject directors, the Project is expected to have about 30 professional staff, 43 technical staff, and \n54 support staff unless otherwise agreed by ADB and the project steering committee. \n \n46.  Project Committees. A project steering committee (PSC), co-chaired by the minister or \ndeputy minister of MEW and MOF with deputy ministerial representation from MAAHF, the Ministry \nof Foreign Affairs, MMI, MRRD, and other relevant ministries, will be formed and meet at least \nyearly or more frequently at the request of the chair to provide policy guidance and review project \nperformance.  A  project  implementation  committee  (PIC)  chaired  by  a  representative  of  the \ngovernor\u2019s office in Herat and comprising high-ranking technical officers from MEW, MAAHF, MMI, \nMOF, MRRD, Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, other provincial authorities (including representatives of \nthe  governors\u2019  offices  of  Bhadghis  and  Ghowr  once  subprojects  are  located  there),  project \nconsultants, and development partners will be formed within 3 months of loan effectiveness to \ncoordinate project implementation and technical issues. The PIC will be based in Herat. The PIC \nwill have the project director as its secretary and will meet at least bimonthly or at the request of \nthe secretariat or chair. The PIC will have overall responsibility for resettlement, although the PMU \nwill manage the day-to-day activities and development and implementation of any resettlement \nplans. The PIC will have responsibility for subproject selection from potential subprojects that meet \nthe selection criteria. Evaluation of candidate subprojects will be supported by the PMU. ADB will \nreview and approve selection of the first five subprojects, and if satisfactory to ADB, prior approval \nby ADB will not be required except for subprojects expected to cost more than $3 million. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n47.  The Project will be implemented over 7 years (2006/2013). The first year will be largely \ndevoted to start-up activities, including staffing the PMU, procurement of goods and services \n(consultants,  office  facilities,  office  equipment,  etc),  and  various  other  preparatory  tasks. \nConstruction  of  subprojects  prepared  under  the  TA  will  be  initiated  in  year  1,  while  other \nsubprojects will be prepared in years 1 to 3 with construction commencing immediately thereafter. \nExperience from these early subprojects will serve as a basis to refine procedures and processes \nfor executing subsequent subprojects (Appendix 7). \n \n3.  Procurement \n48.  Procurement  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works costing over $1 million will be \nprocured under international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Civil works packages estimated \nto  cost  less  than  $1  million  will  be  procured  from  among  prequalified  bidders  under  local \ncompetitive bidding (LCB) based on the Government\u2019s existing procedures for prequalification and \naward of contracts acceptable to ADB. Rehabilitation works involving numerous structures or \n                                                 \n24  The Project will support construction of MEW office facilities in Obe and Herat. A project office may also be opened in \nBadghis Province for the Murghab Basin. \n25  Qualifications of the project director and the deputies will be acceptable to ADB. \n ", "14   \nactivities on subprojects may be bundled into contract packages for procurement either through \nICB or LCB. Civil works less than $500,000 may be done through community in-kind contribution to \nsubprojects to be coordinated through the PMU and MEW. Vehicles, equipment, and materials will \nbe  procured  under  ICB  procedures  where  the  estimated  cost  is  more  than  $500,000,  by \ninternational shopping where the estimated cost is between $300,000 and $500,000, and through \nLCB procedures acceptable to ADB where the estimated cost is $300,000 equivalent or less. \nContractors will be encouraged to hire local laborers from subproject areas. Small or off-the-shelf \ngoods and materials and civil works valued at less than $100,000 may be procured using direct \npurchase arrangements (Appendix 8). \n \n49.  To support timely contract approvals while ensuring sound practice and accountability, \nretroactive approval procedures will be adopted for LCB civil works contracts following award of the \ninitial three contracts. For the first three contract packages under LCB, the PMU will submit the \nprocurement documents and bid evaluation for ADB review and approval before awarding the \ncontracts. If ADB finds the documents and evaluation satisfactory, procurement and contract award \nfor subsequent contract packages can take place in the absence of prior ADB approval. MEW and \nthe PMU will retain a record of all procurement documentation, including copies of the signed \ncontract and the bid evaluation report, for inspection during subsequent ADB project supervision \nmissions or on request. The procurement processes and contract awards will be audited annually \nas part of the performance audit. If any contract award is found unacceptable, ADB may refuse to \nfinance the contract. \n \n4.  Consulting and Nongovernment Organization Services \n50.  To  ensure  successful  implementation,  consulting  services  are  required  in  all  areas  of \nexpertise related to the Project. The high input of consulting services is considered necessary in \nview of the minimal capacity and expertise currently available within MEW, MAAHF, and MMI. The \nProject will require an estimated 892 person-months of consulting services: 468 international and \n424  domestic  (Appendix  9  and  Supplementary  Appendix  B).  This  input  reflects  the  support \nnecessary for capacity development as well as to implement the Project. Consultants will be \nselected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  NGO services are \nneeded  to  support  project  activities  related  to  agriculture  and  livelihood  services,  mirab \ndevelopment,  and  other  activities  necessary  for  implementation  of  the  Project.  To  the  extent \npossible, prequalified NGOs will be contracted on the basis of procedures acceptable to ADB. \nWhere the number of qualified NGOs is limited, direct negotiation may be applied with the prior \napproval of ADB. Provision of the capacity-building package will be contracted to a prequalified \nfirm, institution, or university. Consulting firms will be recruited through full or simplified technical \nproposals, as appropriate, using quality- and cost-based selection procedures. \n \n  5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n51.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with MOF. Consistent with its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the bidding  documents  for  the \nProject. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MOF and \nall contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. All \nexternal costs related to the audits and investigations will be borne by the Project. \n \n ", "      15\n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n52.  Loan  and  grant  disbursements  and  maintenance  of  an  imprest  account  will  be  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001), as amended from time to \ntime and detailed arrangements agreed upon between ADB and the Government. MOF will open \nand maintain the imprest account in the Da Afghanistan Bank. The initial amount to be deposited \ninto the imprest account will not exceed the equivalent of 6 months expenditures or 10% of the \nproject loan and grant amount, whichever is lower. For individual payments not exceeding $50,000, \nMOF will adopt the statement of expenditure procedure for claiming reimbursement and liquidating \nadvances provided into the imprest account. Direct payment procedures may be used for large \nturnkey contracts and consulting services. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n53.  MOF, MEW, and the PMU will maintain separate records and accounts in accordance with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, and adequate to identify (i) goods \nand  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  (ii)  expenditures  incurred  for  the  Project  and \nsubprojects, (iii) use of ADF grant funds, and (iv) any Government expenditures. The account and \nrelated financial statements will be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards \nby  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PMU  will  submit  to  ADB,  through  MOF, \nconsolidated annual audited reports and related financial statements from the Project within 6 \nmonths after the end of each fiscal year. The audit of the imprest account and statement of \nexpenditures will be carried out as part of the regular annual audit. The auditor\u2019s assessment of the \nexamination relating to the imprest account and statement of expenditures should be separately \nset out in the auditor\u2019s report. In addition, ADB may conduct spot audits and random checks on the \nflow of funds and their use at any time during project implementation and the Government has \npledged its cooperation in these efforts. For sound financial management, the Project includes 14 \nperson-months for an international financial management specialist and 36 person-months for an \ninternational procurement specialist. The Project will train a local procurement officer, financial \ncontroller, and four accountants who will be stationed in the PMU. \n \n54.  MEW and the PMU will prepare monthly financial statements and quarterly progress reports \nthat detail the (i) physical and financial progress of activities against the targets, (ii) progress on the \ninstitutional and capacity aspects, (iii) issues affecting project implementation and their corrective \nmeasures, and (iv) other agreed upon monitoring parameters. MEW and the PMU will prepare a \ncomprehensive annual report and submit all reports to ADB through MOF not later than 2 months \nafter the reporting period. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the Government \nwill submit a comprehensive project completion report in ADB\u2019s standard format with additional \ndetails as may be requested by ADB. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n55.  Within  4  months  of  loan  and  grant  effectiveness,  MEW  and  the  PMU  will  establish \nperformance M&E procedures acceptable to ADB. The M&E parameters will be developed as a \npart of the project administration memorandum with assistance from ADB. The M&E system will be \ndeveloped  in  accordance  with  ADB's  project  performance  management  system.  Baseline \ninformation will be collected as part of the subproject feasibility assessment process. Thereafter, \nsurveys will be conducted regularly. The scope of the survey, quantity and quality of data, and \nfrequency of collection will be guided by project management needs for progressive feedback on \nimplementation  status  and  early  warning  on  situations  that  might  jeopardize  development \nobjectives. Subproject monitoring will be conducted by the PMU, MEW, mirabs, and others as \nneeded, and will be reviewed closely by ADB. \n \n ", "16   \n9.  Project Review \n56.  During the initial 3 years of the Project, ADB will carry out at least semiannual reviews to (i) \ndetermine if implementation arrangements are in place and appropriate, (ii) assess progress in \ncapacity  development,  (iii)  review  subproject  selection  and  implementation,  (iv)  ensure  ADB \nsafeguards,  and  (v)  assess  any  unforeseen  impacts.  By  December  2009,  ADB  and  the \nGovernment  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  to  identify  any  problems  in \nimplementation arrangements and define needed changes to achieve the project objectives. Two \nmonths before the midterm review, the PMU will submit a detailed progress report on project \nimplementation  to  ADB.  Terms  of  reference  for  the  review  will  be  included  in  the  project \nadministration memorandum to be prepared during ADB\u2019s inception mission for the Project. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits  \n57.  Economic and Financial Benefits. The economic benefits of the Project will result from \nthe irrigation system R&U investments to improve yields, expand irrigated areas, and increase \ncropping intensity. The economic returns are based on the analysis of 3 irrigation R&U subprojects \nprepared under the TA. The economic internal rates of return (EIRR) of the irrigation diversion \nschemes analyzed over 20 years are 12%, 20%, and 22% when all project management costs are \nincluded.26 The benefits for the irrigation schemes are based purely on productivity increases and \ndo not include benefits of improved mobility and market access from bridges and flood protection \nof canals.27 The assumed benefits from the irrigation R&U and agricultural support services include \nan increase in wheat yields of about 40% from low baseline yields of 2.0 t/ha to about 2.8 t/ha.28 \nThe area of horticultural activities increased from a low base of about 5% cropping intensity to \nabout 20% cropping intensity with yield increases of around 20%. Based on the subprojects \nprepared, the assumed cost was about $650/ha for the R&U works, agricultural support services, \nand mirab development assistance. The Project will complete R&U of about 45,000 ha in the Hari \nRud River Basin, 10,000 ha in the Murghab Basin, and an additional 6,500 ha equivalent in water \nresources development. The EIRR of the overall Project is 17%.29 \n \n58.  Household budgets were prepared for various incomes groups for the subprojects. In the \nJui Nau Canal subproject, the smallest farmers (assumed 0.8 ha landholding) realized an increase \nin net income of $234 or a 117% rise in household earnings. In many cases, much of the net \nincrease  will  be  consumed,  thus  improving  food  security  and  nutrition  (Appendix  10).  The \nincremental recurrent costs for O&M are estimated to be about $2.6/ha per year. This represents \nabout a 25% increase in the current community O&M contribution. Even for poor farmers, this \namount lies well within their ability to pay to ensure financial sustainability and cost recovery. Given \nthe average family size of seven and average landholding (or area farmed by sharecroppers) at 1 \n                                                 \n26  Some flood protection interventions were investigated during the TA but failed to exhibit economically viable returns. \nFlood protection benefits must be based on properly derived probabilities and damage functions; this being the case, \neconomically attractive flood control subprojects may exist in the western basins and must be evaluated on a case-by-\ncase basis during project implementation. \n27 The irrigation R&U activities will have an element of flood control works, which will yield substantial benefits. In most \nsystems, main canals are threatened due to flooding at the intake, cross drainage, or rivers, and if this occurs at a \ncritical structure, a substantial portion of the downstream crops could be lost for the season. The project analysis does \nnot quantify these benefits or include them into the economic or financial analysis. \n28 Irrigated wheat yields in Afghanistan range from 1.5 t/ha to 3.5 t/ha and higher in areas with good water supply. The \nnational average in 2003 was about 2.9 t/ha. \n29  The analysis does not include pure capacity-building activities, but does include all of the IWRM activity costs in \ncomponent 1, which do not yield quantified benefits.  \n ", "      17\nha or less, at least 400,000 people will directly benefit from the Project or about 20% of the western \nbasin\u2019s population. \n \nB.  Social and Other Benefits and Impacts \n59.  Social Impacts. In the districts where project preparation took place, approximately 54% of \nthe population classed themselves as very poor, 30% as poor, 16% as well-off, and none as rich. \nGiven that average landholdings are less than 1 ha and up to 30% of the population is landless and \nmany sharecrop, the Project will have a large impact on reducing poverty and improving food \nsecurity. For some farmers, the Project will provide increased opportunities for perennial crops, \nsecond season vegetables, and rice cultivation with substantial income impacts. The shift from \ngrain production to higher value cropping will be consistent with expected changes in food demand \nand  consumption.  The  improvement  and  change  in  production  will  be  achieved  through  the \nirrigation R&U, and through increasing the capacity of farmers, which will allow them to make better \nproduction decisions as irrigated agriculture continues to develop and intensify in the western \nbasins.  Marginalized  members  of  society  will  benefit  through  labor  opportunities  provided  by \nsecond season cropping; and the income-generating opportunities in component 3 are targeted \nspecifically at the women and the landless.  \n \n60.  IWRM and Improved Water Use Efficiency. The Project will support (i) increased water \nuse efficiency in terms of productivity and returns per unit volume of water, (ii) development of \nimproved intakes and capture efficiency for improved water supply, and (iii) greater efficiency and \nequity  of  water  distribution  within  irrigation  systems.  Physical  improvements  to  the  irrigation \nsystems will be augmented by institutional strengthening through the RBA at the basin level and \nthrough stronger mirabs and MEW for better management and O&M at the system level. Even \nthough the Project does not quantify financial or economic benefits from the IWRM component, it \nwill  provide  long-term  benefits  from  equitably  and  efficiently  managing  and  allocating  surface \nwater. Sustainable groundwater management will be especially important as pumped water use \nwill continue to grow, and water quality concerns will increase with population and economic \ngrowth. In an arid environment where water is essential to livelihoods, the IWRM activities will be \nabsolutely essential to maintain and sustain regional economic growth. \n \n61.  Resettlement. Project interventions will primarily consist of R&U of traditional irrigation \nsystems and small water resources development subprojects. Although a resettlement framework \nwas developed, the subprojects prepared during the TA did not indicate that resettlement activities \nwould be necessary. The most likely resettlement actions will be temporary compensation during \nconstruction; however, mirabs and communities will be consulted extensively during subproject \npreparation to develop a construction plan that minimizes disruptions. The majority of construction \nactivities will be executed when the irrigation systems are not in use. A resettlement framework \nwas prepared and in the event of resettlement impacts, resettlement plans will be prepared in \naccordance  with  the  resettlement  framework.  Procedures  and  consultant  support  to  develop \nresettlement plans are provided through the Project and will be in place 8 months after loan \neffectiveness. Any necessary resettlement activities will include external monitoring (Appendix 11, \nand Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n62.  Environmental Impacts. Environmental impacts from the Project are not anticipated to be \nsignificant and should not impact downstream users. The TA prepared an initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) for each of the three subprojects and for the entire Project (Appendix 12 and \nSupplementary Appendix D). The IEE for the subprojects did not predict impacts of significance \neither during R&U or after subproject completion. The IEE for the entire Project concluded that all \nthe components should provide environmental benefits in the medium- to long-term except for \nR&U, which is not anticipated to create any negative impacts. The IEE for the Jui Nau canal \nsubproject, along with the environmental assessment review procedures, provide an environmental \nframework to guide the PMU and the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), which will \n ", "18   \nsupport  environmental  activities  through  the  Project.  An  IEE  will  be  carried  out  for  all  new \nsubprojects and mitigating measures implemented if needed. An environmental monitoring plan will \nbe prepared for each subproject, with the participation of MEW, PMU, NEPA, mirabs, and the \ncommunity.  The  Project  has  a  budget  dedicated  to  support  development  of  environmental \nmonitoring plans and will provide consultant support to (i) develop capacity for the NEPA, MEW, \nand mirabs; and (ii) prepare IEEs and environmental monitoring plans (Supplementary Appendix \nE). \n \n63.  Capacity Development. Although no quantified economic benefits or costs are attributed \nto capacity development, it will have a significant impact in terms of sustainability of project benefits \nand  the  redevelopment  of  irrigated  agriculture  in  Afghanistan.  MEW  staff  trained  locally  and \ninternationally are expected to continue the R&U activities as well as contribute to development of \nnew  irrigation.  Mirabs,  ministry  staff,  and  farmers  trained  under  the  Project  will  provide  a \npermanent resource to foster agricultural and economic growth in the western basins. Professional \nand technical MEW staff having been trained, and gaining experience under the Project, will also \nserve as a core of institutional expertise benefiting water resource development and management \nactivities throughout Afghanistan in the years to come. \n \nC.  Risks \n64.  Security.  The  overall  political  and  security  situation  remains  unsettled  in  Afghanistan \nalthough the western region is one of the most secure areas in the country. Careful monitoring and \ncoordination with Government authorities and the United Nations will be needed. ADB\u2019s ongoing \nSecurity of ADB Financed Projects TA30 will provide advice to ensure a safe work environment for \non-site personnel. Under the prevailing conditions, however, the security risks cannot be mitigated \ncompletely, and minor delays in project implementation may be inevitable despite risk-mitigating \nmeasures should security problems arise. \n \n65.  Contracting of Civil Works. Due to the long period of civil unrest and stagnation of \nconstruction in the project area, a risk exists that the capacity of local contractors is inadequate to \nimplement the project civil works within the time frame and costs and to required quality standards. \nThe Project will use a variety of contracting methods including ICB for large contract packages to \nensure international or regional contractors with experience are able to complete a large number of \nworks in a timely manner and ensuring quality. The larger international contractor will subcontract \nportions of the work to local contractors thus developing their capacity through project experience. \nThe Project will also use local contractors, selected through LCB, and employing the following \nsafeguards:  (i)  training  for  contractors  on  best  practice  and  ADB  procedures;  (ii)  strict \nprequalification criteria with a test period; and (iii) contracts with penalties for late performance that \nwill  be  enforced.  Local  contracting  capacity  is  expected  to  become  sufficient  as  the  Project \ndevelops. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n66.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  The  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The PMU will be established by the Government, and appointment of the project \ndirector in Herat within 3 months of loan and grant effectiveness. Within 1 year of loan \nand grant effectiveness, the PMU shall establish (i) a project office in Obe, Herat \n                                                 \n30  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for Security of ADB-Financed Projects in \nAfghanistan. Manila. \n ", "      19\nprovince, to support project activities in the upper Hari Rud River Basin, and (ii) a \nproject office in Kabul to coordinate activities with MOF and MEW until MEW has the \ncapacity to manage activities without project support. Deputy directors in Obe and \nKabul will be appointed within 3 months of the opening of those offices. \n(ii)  Within 1 year of loan and grant effectiveness, MEW will set up a cell supported by a \nBWC comprising representatives from MEW, MOF, MMI, MAAHF, MRRD, provincial \nand municipal authorities, mirabs and other stakeholders to plan and execute technical \nfunctions associated with the IWRM component. \n(iii)  Within 6 years of loan and grant effectiveness, MEW will establish and develop the \nRBA,  funded  with  an  adequate  flow  of  resources  to  support  its  sustainability  in \nperpetuity. Within 5 years of loan and grant effectiveness, MEW with PMU support will \ncomplete a study and propose a funding mechanism to support the RBA based on cost \nrecovery from all Hari Rud River Basin water users. \n(iv)  The  Government  will  form  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC),  co-chaired  by  the \nminister or deputy minister of MEW and MOF with deputy ministerial representation \nfrom MAAHF, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, MMI, MRRD, and other relevant ministries \nthat will meet at least yearly or more frequently at the request of the chair to provide \npolicy guidance and review project performance. \n(v)  Within 3 months of loan and grant effectiveness, a project implementation committee \n(PIC) chaired by a representative of the governor\u2019s office in Herat and comprising high-\nranking technical officers from MEW, MAAHF, MMI, MOF, MRRD, Ministry of Women\u2019s \nAffairs, other provincial authorities (including representatives of the governors\u2019 offices \nof Bhadgis and Ghowr once subprojects are located there), project consultants, and \ndevelopment  partners  will  be  formed  to  coordinate  project  implementation  and \ntechnical issues. \n(vi)  The Government will depute staff to the Project in accordance with levels and positions \nagreed with ADB and the PSC. If staff cannot be deputed, local staff will be hired \nthrough the Project who will become MEW, and MAAHF staff under posts sanctioned \nby the Government by year 3 of the Project. The Government will ensure that staff \nhired for the Project and who receive international training through the Project will \nremain through the Project\u2019s duration and remain with  MEW, and  MAAHF for an \nadequate period of time to ensure the sustainability of project benefits. \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that all subprojects meet, to the satisfaction of ADB, the \nagreed selection criteria and implementation arrangements, and that all subprojects \nare properly monitored to the satisfaction of ADB. \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that, to the extent possible, subprojects will not entail any \nland acquisition and/or involuntary resettlement. In the event land acquisition and/or \ninvoluntary resettlement are unavoidable for any subproject, then the Government will \nensure that a resettlement plan is prepared in accordance with (a) the Government\u2019s \napplicable laws and regulations; (b) ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), as \namended from time to time; and (c) the agreed resettlement framework; and is based on \ndetailed design. The resettlement plans will be disclosed to those affected and project \nreporting will provide information on resettlement activities. \n(ix)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate  environmental  mitigation  measures,  in \naccordance  with  (a)  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002);  and  (b)  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental laws and regulations are incorporated into all subproject designs, and \nthat  these  measures  are  incorporated  during  subproject  implementation.  The \nGovernment will ensure that all subprojects for which an IEE is required include such \nIEE in the subproject proposal. \n(x)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  subprojects  will  not  negatively  affect  indigenous \npeoples.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Afghanistan: \nWater resources and irrigated agriculture are fundamental to the rural sector, poverty reduction, and the national \neconomy in Afghanistan. Agriculture makes up about 50% and 60% of Afghanistan's gross domestic product (GDP) \nand employs about 80% of the population. Irrigated Agriculture is responsible for up to 80% of all agricultural \nproduction in some years. Afghanistan has about 2.5\u20133.0 million hectares (ha) of agricultural land with some irrigation \nfacilities out of the total arable area of about 8 million ha.1 However, much of this land receives only intermittent \nirrigation and in some years may receive no irrigation at all due to poor condition of systems and variable rainfall. The \nNational Vulnerability Survey indicated that lack of irrigation water was the number one constraint to agriculture across \nthe county at 31%.2 Rainfed agriculture takes place on about 4.5\u20135.0 million ha but is unreliable for productivity due to \nvariability in rainfall including recurrent drought. \n \nUntil 2003, Afghanistan had not been self-sufficient in cereal production since 1976. From 1978 though the 1980s, \nproduction steadily fell due to civil unrest and associated deterioration of the agricultural sector and food insecurity \nwas widespread. In 1990, production was only 60% of previous levels, yet the sector recovered throughout the 1990s \ndue to improved security and better rainfall. However, a chronic drought from 1999 to 2001 devastated the agricultural \nsector with a near total failure of rainfed farming. Many traditionally irrigated lands were deprived of water, which \ndestroyed long-standing orchards and vineyard in many areas. Livestock was significantly impacted with substantially \nreduced herds with a corresponding drop in rural assets and wealth, especially affecting the landless and nomadic \nherdsmen. By 2004, 70% of all rural households had still not fully recovered income or asset losses from the drought \nfrom 1999 to 2001. As a drought coping strategy, 40% of rural families decreased food consumption from levels that \nwere  already  deficient  for  adequate  nutrition,  and  many  were  forced  to  sell  land  for  income  rendering  them \npermanently worse off and more prone to poverty. \n \nIncreased security and better rains in 2002 and 2003 improved agricultural performance with a record cereal harvest \nof about 5.4 million tons in 2003. Favorable conditions benefited other crops as well as livestock, and the strong \nrecovery of the agricultural sector was driving economic growth. In 2004, however, another deficit rainfall year \nbrought about drought conditions that were estimated to have caused a 20\u201325% decline in cereal production. \nBecause of the drought conditions, an estimated 16% GDP growth for 2003\u201304 was revised downwards to 8%, and \nan additional 2.5 million Afghans were faced with food insecurity. The recurrent droughts are not only detrimental to \nagricultural production but seriously impact drinking water supplies and health in many rural communities. To ensure \nfood security, reduce rural poverty, and ensure national economic growth, development of water resources and \nimproving irrigated agriculture are essential since the productivity and reliability of rainfed farming does not provide a \nsustainable basis to achieve these. \n \nIn December 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and World \nBank jointly undertook a preliminary needs assessment study of various sectors. The assessment recognized the \nneed for a comprehensive approach to water resources management, irrigation, and ensuring women and vulnerable \ngroups benefit from rural recovery initiatives.3 The National Development Framework4 was finalized by the Afghanistan \nInterim Administration in April 2002. Its development strategy is based on three pillars: (i) humanitarian and human \nand social capital, (ii) physical reconstruction and natural resources including emphasis on water resources, and (iii) \nprivate sector development. In March 2004, Securing Afghanistan\u2019s Future was formulated jointly between the \nGovernment of Afghanistan, ADB, United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan, UNDP, and World Bank for an \ninternational conference held in Berlin. This document set out the plans for the future of Afghanistan over the coming \n10\u201320 years, in line with the Afghanistan National Development Framework, including emphasis on development of \nwater resources and irrigation infrastructure and associated natural resource management, particularly the need for a \ncomprehensive approach to water management through basin management. The Afghanistan National Development \nStrategy  that  is  currently  under  preparation  also  highlights  the  development  of  water  resources  and  irrigated \nagriculture as key development elements to poverty reduction and growth of the national economy. Afghanistan\u2019s \ndevelopment strategies have all linked the importance of infrastructure development and strengthening institutional \nframework for water resources and irrigated agriculture as key objective\u2019s to reduce poverty. \n                                                 \n1  Statistics on the extent of irrigation, land-use, and other agricultural information are uncertain. \n2  World Food Program, and Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development. 2004.

Poverty Analysis                                                      Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nA.   Poverty \nInternationally, poverty levels are indicated by several means such as the rates for child mortality, maternal mortality, \naccess  to  water  and  sanitation  facilities,  adult  literacy  (particularly  in  females),  caloric  intake,  and  economic \nmeasurement.  The  gross  national  income  for  Afghanistan  is  estimated  at  $250.00  per  capita  per  year  and \napproximately 53% of the population is classified as living below the poverty line. About half the rural population in \nAfghanistan lack regular consumption of an adequate diet (2,100 calories per day). The poorest 20% of the rural \npopulation experience food insecurity in years of good harvest, and 70% of children do not receive sufficient food \nintake for normal development. Health indicators5 of poverty reveal that Afghanistan has an infant mortality rate of a \nhigh 165/1,000 and ranks the 4th highest under-5 infant mortality rate at 257 deaths/1,000. This compares with under-\n5 mortality rate ranking for Pakistan at 46th; Iran at 79th; and Tajikistan at 39th.   \n \nA participatory poverty analysis was conducted in selected communities within the Hari Rud River Basin. Where \nagriculture and livestock were essential parts of the local economy. Over half of the villages surveyed perceived their \ncommunities consisted of at least 50%, and up to 90% in some cases, of households living below a poverty line, \nbased upon their own characteristics of very poor, poor, and well-off. Characteristics of the very poor included being \nan unskilled laborer (many working outside of the community but within Afghanistan), suffering ill-health, being \nlandless, or sharecropping. Vulnerability was defined by communities as households headed by women or being \nelderly and given the years of fighting, many vulnerable households existed. In most communities surveyed, a majority \nof the households were classed as poor in which they had less than 2 ha landholding and were semiskilled with many \nreceiving remittance from family members, mostly working in Iran. Based on primary survey data covering Herat \nProvince, approximately 54% of the population are classed as very poor, 30% are poor, and 16% are well-off. In \naddition, data indicates that within the project area over 98% of the population has poor access to sanitation facilities \nand over 60% lack safe water supplies. \n \nB.  Impact \nThe Western Basins Water Resources Management Project (the Project) supports the following: (i) improved water \nresources management from the farm to the river basin level; (ii) improved irrigation system infrastructure and  \nmanagement and agricultural support service resulting in increased area and yields for first season wheat crops; (iii) \nincreased area and yields of second season, high value, diversified horticulture and perennial crops; and increased \narea and yields of fodder; (iv) income generating opportunities for the landless and women; and (v) capacity \ndevelopment  to  sustain  Project  benefits  and  to  continue  redevelopment  of  the  water  resources  and  irrigated \nagriculture in Afghanistan. The Project will enhance poverty reduction and benefit rural communities in the following \nmanner: \n(i)  Improved  irrigation  and  agricultural  support  services  will  increase  the  staple  crop  of  wheat \nproduction improving general nutrition and food security especially for poor farmers. Increased \nsecond season cropping will also support better nutrition and food security. Increased fodder \nproduction will improve livestock production, which is critical for maintenance of rural wealth. \n(ii)  All types of enhanced agricultural production will increase incomes. Poor households are anticipated \nto have an increase of incomes of $234 or 117%. As noted, much of the productivity increase will be \nconsumed by poorer households. \n(iii)  The increased agricultural production, especially second season cropping, will result in increased \ndemand for unskilled and semiskilled labor particularly from lower income groups and the landless.  \n(iv)  The Project will provide interventions that reduce risk of flooding and the impacts of drought, which \nwill mitigate significant poverty shocks. Many poor are living on marginal land washes that are prone \nto floods causing crop loss and erosion. Drought is the most pervasive poverty shock in Afghanistan \nand reducing drought impacts will have a significant impact on poverty reduction. These actions will \nprevent people from falling to poverty and needing to sell productive assets to get out of poverty. \n(v)  Project interventions will help provide viable alternatives to poppy cultivation especially for the poor \nwho have fewer options. \n(vi)  The Project will provide income generating opportunities for the landless and women who do not \nhave access to productive assets. The Project will provide resources and capacity development so \nthese marginalized members of society can develop skills and asset to sustain improved livelihoods. \n(vii)  Improved water flow rates, canal access, and groundwater management will improve the access to \nand the quality of potable water sources contributing to improved human health throughout the \nproject area.  Positive impacts on health  will  lead to more productive labor and potential for \n                                                 \n5  United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. 2005.

Capacity \ndevelopment for farmers will improve their skills for more productive agriculture, which they can use \nand adapt long after the Project closes. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                    \n \nA participatory survey, and secondary data collection approach was used to collect qualitative and quantitative data \ncovering a stratified selection of communities in a core subproject areas during the Project preparation to assess \npoverty  and  social  issues,  potential  positive  and  negative  social  impacts,  resettlement  and  land  acquisition \nrequirements, and stakeholder views. Women, men, and children (men and women in separate groups); different \nwealth  groups;  Government  and  ministry;  community  leaders;  agriculture  and  nonagriculture  sector;  and \nnongovernment organizations and businesses were all consulted. Consultation measures included: direct observation, \nkey  subproject  settlement  scoping  surveys,  participatory  poverty  analysis,  household  key  informant  surveys, \nconsultation and qualitative data collection (focus group discussions and community mapping), water vulnerability \nscoring and ranking, problem and solution discussion, and key informant interviews. A participation consultation \nstrategy was prepared as a part of the Project\u2019s implementation procedures. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nWomen in Afghanistan play a far less prominent role to males in social and economic decision making. They have \nbeen traditionally confined to household activities including taking care of children, home gardens, and some livestock \nactivities. Women\u2019s awareness of the role and function of water management is very limited, and they do not see \nthemselves as playing a part in water management decision making. Male stakeholders have limited perception of the \nrelevance of women\u2019s involvement in agricultural activities or natural resource use. Women landowners are not \nnormally involved in making decisions concerning use of their land, nor accessing revenues resulting from use of that \nland. Women landowners are not normally included in interactions with external agencies. Women often do not \nparticipate in activity discussions as social restrictions prevent them from sitting and discussing matters with men. \nWomen cannot be grouped as a single element, but will have different stakeholder perspectives as much as men. \nInstitutional policies and practices constrain women\u2019s participation in project activities and are not supportive of their \nrole in the agriculture sector. Women experience multiple time constraints due to multiple task responsibilities in \ndifferent ways than men, thus having implications for participation. Both men and women feel women need more \nsupport than they are currently receiving in order to successfully participate in natural resource management activities. \n \nThe Project\u2019s gender development activities to benefit women and men include the following: \n\u2022  Involvement in subproject development. Ensure that women are able to participate in the positioning and \ndesign of non-irrigation-related, micro-infrastructure and are included in the subproject rehabilitation and \nupgrading. Women village members will be consulted and confirm the positioning and design of bridges for \naccess to basic service and for other non-irrigation-related infrastructure developed with subprojects. This might \nalso include micro-infrastructure to support and enhance access to irrigation water for households or other \nnonirrigation uses. Every subproject will include consultation with women in the subproject area that will be a \npart of the overall subproject development process and facilitated by the Project\u2019s gender specialists. \n\u2022  Diversification of income sources. This will be accomplished through income generation opportunities and \nappropriate skills development for women supported by the agricultural and livelihoods services component.  \n\u2022  Strengthening of the asset base. Skills and material assets, particularly of poor women and households \nheaded by women will also be strengthened through the agriculture and livelihoods services component. \n\u2022  Gender disaggregation of data. This will assist gender mainstreaming and improve monitoring of project \nimpacts on women and men. \n\u2022  Gender integration. This can be accomplished by establishing good baseline, gender-sensitive entry points, \nand building an environment conducive to both male and females. \n \n \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nE.

Water resources management and irrigated agriculture are critical to the well-being of the \nrural sector, poverty reduction, and the national economy. Irrigated agriculture produces up to 80% \nof agricultural output, makes up 50\u201360% of the total national economy, and employs around 80% \nof the population. Deficit rainfall in 2004 had a devastating impact on the economy when the \nexpected 16% annual gross domestic product growth was revised downward to 8% and 2.5 million \nAfghans were faced with food insecurity. In the National Vulnerability Risk Assessment, farmers \nthroughout the country cited lack of irrigation water as the number one constraint to agriculture.1 \nAgriculture uses 95% of developed water supplies, thus improvement of irrigated agriculture and \nstrengthening of water resources management must be pursued in parallel to sustain Afghanistan\u2019s \neconomic growth and address rural poverty. \n \n2.  The Western Basins. Badghis, Ghowr, and Herat provinces comprise the western basins. \nWith the exception of Herat City, the second largest city in Afghanistan, most of the districts in the \nwestern  basins  are  nearly  100%  rural.  The  area  has  about  2  million  people,  or  8%  of  the \nAfghanistan\u2019s population, with Pashtuns and Tajiks being the most common ethnic groups. Up to \n30% of rural households are landless, the average farm size is no more than 1 hectare (ha), and \nincreasing numbers of the poorest households are farming on marginal land and in washes where \nrisk of drought and floods is high. These poorest households are highly vulnerable to livelihood \nshocks and thus have the most limited options to resist opium poppy cultivation in desperate times. \nPopulation growth will continue at nearly 2% per annum over the next 10 years; the area is a home \nto many returning refugees. Yet in spite of the challenges facing the western basins, the area has \nsome of the greatest potential for economic growth through intensification of irrigated agriculture \nand related services and industries. \n \n3.  The Hari Rud and Murghab rivers are the largest in western Afghanistan; together their \nbasins cover 78,000 square kilometers (km) (over 12% of Afghanistan). They provide 3 billion cubic \nmeters of annual water runoff, split almost equally between the two basins, although the Hari Rud \nRiver  Basin  is  far  more  developed.  The  rivers  flow  west  from  Afghanistan  and  drain  into \nTurkmenistan, with the Hari Rud first passing along the border with Iran. The majority of runoff \ncomes from snowmelt with high flood flows from March to June and very low flows from August to \nFebruary. Since most irrigation systems are river diversions, this means that discharge is excess in \nthe spring and deficit in the summer to meet crop water requirements, and farmers have adapted \ntheir irrigation and agricultural practices to this flood-flow water regime. The Salma Dam, which is a \nproposed  multipurpose  facility  to  be  constructed  160  km  east  of  Herat  and  financed  by  the \nGovernment of India, should mitigate spring floods and enhance dry season flows. \n \n1.  Irrigation \n4.  Irrigation in Afghanistan. Of the total land area of 65 million ha, only about 8 million ha is \nsuitable for cultivation. Hydrologic conditions confine most surface irrigation to the major river \nvalleys with seven provinces providing nearly one third the total irrigated area. Total irrigated area \nis  about  2.5\u20133.0  million  ha,  although  in  many  years  many  areas  may  only  have  intermittent \nirrigation.2 The country has five basic types of irrigation systems: (i) arhad or Persian wheel (about \n                                                 \n1 World Food Program, and Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development. 2004. National Risk and Vulnerability \nAssessment. Kabul. \n2  Data is uncertain for most statistics in Afghanistan.  \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \n1%), (ii) karez3 (about 5\u201310 %), (iii) traditional surface water systems (about 80\u201390%), (iv) modern \nor formal surface water systems (about 10%), and (v) pump systems (unknown). The scale and \ntechnical characteristics of each system type have different management implications. The vast \nmajority of irrigation is traditional. Of the irrigated area, only about 1.7 million ha (55%) is in the \nfunctional command of gravity systems. \n \n5.  The  Irrigation  Department.  Historically,  the  Government  has  played  a  limited  role  in \ndeveloping  and  managing  irrigation  systems,  and  the  majority  of  irrigation  has  always  been \ntraditional. The capacity of the Irrigation Department was significantly diminished during the recent \ncivil unrest leaving few qualified engineers or other staff. Limited resources have rendered the \nIrrigation Department a moribund agency with no field activities taking place and provincial offices \nfalling into dysfunction. In the post-Taliban period, the Irrigation Department moved to the newly \ncreated Ministry of Irrigation, Water Resources, and Environment. In December 2004 after the \npresidential election of Hamid Karzai, the ministries were reshuffled and consolidated, and the \nIrrigation Department (including water resources management responsibility) moved to the Ministry \nof Energy and Water (MEW).4 The task of rebuilding and developing irrigation and strengthening \nwater  resources  management  is  enormous;  however,  the  Irrigation  Department  has  dynamic \nleadership and is committed to capacity development. Crafting an effective institution will take a \nlong-term commitment. \n \n6.  Traditional Irrigation Systems. Traditional irrigation systems are the most common type \nof irrigation system in Afghanistan and are based on gravity surface water diversion systems or \nspring fed.5 They generally have few formal control structures and use earthen canals that rely on \nbrush, log, mud, stone, and some masonry water control structures. Intake structures are usually \nnot engineered or permanent, and rely on brush, logs, rock, and makeshift gabions. Given the \nannual flood hydrology and the fact that river channels often shift laterally and have lowering bed \nlevels, intake structures need to be rebuilt on a frequent basis. Large traditional systems may \nsupply thousands of hectares and have hundreds of kilometers of canals. In general, the size of \nthe traditional irrigation systems increases as one moves down the river valleys and out into the \nplains since the topography is more favorable for development, the land is more fertile, and flows \ngenerally larger. Larger systems have main, secondary, and smaller canals; may include numerous \nvillages in their command area; and may supply water for domestic use, livestock, and municipal \nsupply. Average irrigation efficiency is considered to be about 25\u201330% due to high conveyance \nlosses in traditional schemes and high on-farm distribution losses due to poor command area \ndevelopment. \n \n7.  Irrigated Agriculture in the Western Basins. About 18% of Afghanistan\u2019s irrigation is in the \nwestern basins; the lower Hari Rud River Basin contains nearly 10% of the country\u2019s functional \ncommand areas although it comprises only 3% of Afghanistan\u2019s surface area. Local communities \ndeveloped some canals over 500 years ago with a few able to irrigate up to 5000\u201310,000 ha. The \nsystems have sophisticated water allocation practices based on irrigated area and location within the \ncanal command. The western basins have 302,000 ha of irrigation, of which 173,000 ha (57%) are \nintensively irrigated and of this 109,000 ha (63% of intensive irrigation) are found in the lower Hari \nRud River Basin (Herat Province) (Table A3). Most of the intermittent irrigated lands were also in the \nHari Rud River Basin (62%) with the majority also in the lower Hari Rud River Basin. The existing \n                                                 \n3  A karez is an indigenous water supply system that captures subsurface flow by tunneling horizontal shafts into the side \nof hills or mountains. \n4  The ministry was dissolved and environment was made an autonomous agency. \n5  Artesian springs are common in many areas and a vital source of surface water that supplies about 5\u20137% of all \nirrigation. Although the water source is different from surface diversions of traditional systems, the distribution and \nsystem management are similar.  \n ", "Appendix 3  31\nland in farms is about 170,000 ha; about 110,000 ha have functional gravity command systems. In \nthe long irrigation history of the lower Hari Rud River Basin, virtually all land that could be irrigated by \ngravity flow has already been brought into command, and the opportunities for new gravity schemes \non uncommitted land are very limited. Although less developed, the incised river valleys of the upper \nHari Rud River Basin and Murghab River Basin may limit the opportunities for new gravity schemes. \n \nTable A3: Irrigated Area by Subbasin within the Western Basin \n  Intensive  Intermittent  Total \nSubbasin  hectares  %  hectares %  hectares  % \nBala Murghab  28,566  16  34,192  27  62,758  21 \nKuchk wa Kashan  10,924  6  13,398  10  24,322  8 \nRud \nLower Hari Rud  108,633  63  57,043  44  165,676  55 \nUpper Hari Rud  25,281  15  23,717  18  48,998  16 \n  Total  173,404  57  128,350  43  301,754  100 \nNote: The Kuchk wa Kash Rud is a small, separate basin with little flow compared with the others. \nSource: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 1997. \n \n8.  Condition of Irrigation Infrastructure. About one third of Afghanistan's villages were \ndamaged or destroyed during the first 10 years of war (1979/89), and the impact on irrigation \ninfrastructure stems partly from direct combat damage. However, degradation is mainly due to the \nexodus of farmers and dereliction of operation and maintenance (O&M). After the war in the 1990s, \nsome communities were able to rehabilitate small traditional irrigation systems. In larger and more \ncomplex schemes with intakes from bigger rivers, greater problems were encountered including \ncomplete sedimentation of larger canals and dilapidation of major structures and canals.6 An \nestimated 10% of systems were directly affected by combat, while another 40%, particularly large-\nscale schemes, were damaged due to lack of O&M and uncontrolled flows entering the systems. In \nsome areas, access to irrigation water may have been reduced by more than 50% since the pre-\nwar  era,  and  irrigated  area  has  declined  by  as  much  as  33%.  In  addition  to  the  need  for \nrehabilitation, many of the traditional schemes would benefit from upgrading including improved \nriver intakes, rationalization of canal networks, improved structures for water control and regulation, \nimproved cross drainage, canal protection, and other improvements consistent with modern design \nand construction. This will increase water use efficiency; improve control over water distribution; \nand reduce annual maintenance needs.7 Intensive irrigation as a proportion of functional command \nshrunk alarmingly in the western basins between 1995 and 2003, from 57% to less than 30%, as a \nresult of the prolonged drought. Significant investment in rehabilitation is needed and would yield \nsubstantial returns by bringing abandoned irrigated land back into intensive irrigation and improving \nwater supply reliability throughout the systems. \n \n9.  Traditional Irrigation Management under the Mirabs.8 In traditional systems, ongoing \ncommunity management continues to be responsible for most system O&M and management. \nCommunities select mirabs who are the local water masters responsible for managing the system, \nincluding  water  allocation  and  O&M  with  the  support  of  community  labor.  In  larger  irrigation \n                                                 \n6  Unexploded ordnance and land mines also pose challenges for irrigation development and rehabilitation in many \nareas. \n7  The last decades of civil unrest were particularly devastating for the karez with many falling into disservice due to the \ndisruption of traditional community O&M. The recent influx of groundwater pumps has also desiccated karez flows and \nwithout adequate groundwater management, this trend is likely to continue. This trend has significant equity concerns \nsince karez water, which is traditionally a community resource, is being usurped for private use by individuals who can \nafford pumps and their operation. \n8  Mirabs are traditionally community water managers responsible for traditional irrigation schemes. \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \nsystems, a mirab bashi is selected with responsibility for the entire irrigation system starting with \nthe intake for the primary canal. Additional mirabs are selected to manage the distribution from the \nsecondary  canals,  while  a  chak  bashi  is  selected  at  the  tertiary  level.  In  some  instances,  a \ntimekeeper (saatchi) or assistants may be selected to oversee rotation.9 \n \n10.  A village shura (council) usually selects the mirab for a 1-year term although no term limit \nexists, and in many cases, the mirab will serve the majority of his lifetime and sometimes pass the \nposition on to his children, so long as the community is satisfied with performance. The mirab's role \nmay require full-time service during a large portion of the year, and in-kind fee is received from the \nharvest.  The  mirabs  receive  no  formal  assistance  from  the  Government  although  they  may \ncollaborate with the Irrigation Department or other authorities to help execute projects. Generally, \nthe financial and other resources at their disposal are meager, and O&M support is provided \nentirely by the community. Mirabs are usually still able to mobilize significant community labor, \nsometimes hundreds or thousands of men in labor gangs, using manual methods for O&M in most \nsystems. \n \n11.  Dispute resolution within the irrigation network is addressed by the mirabs, yet concerns \nmay  be  referred  to  the  shura  for  decision  and  possible  sanction.  At  the  community  level, \nenforcement appears to be addressed through public reprimands with shame as the main coercive \nmeasure. In some instances, however, mirabs or irrigators may bring issues to the attention of the \nIrrigation Department or other district or provincial authorities, including the governor's office, for \nassistance to resolve a situation, especially allocation conflicts between different irrigation systems. \nIn these cases, the mirabs act as system advocates. \n \n12.  Current  State  of  Traditional  Management.  Like  the  physical  infrastructure,  the \ninstitutional structure for community management has degraded during the last 30 years of civil \nunrest. In some communities, mirabs have difficulty enforcing the water allocation schedules. The \nrise of local commanders in the rural power vacuum created after the fall of the Taliban along with \nthe  influx  of  weapons  over  the  last  two  decades  has  made  it  difficult  to  stop  unauthorized \nabstractions of irrigation water in some areas. Upstream users are more emboldened to take water \nbeyond their share and mirabs, even with the backing of provincial officials, have little recourse to \naddress the situation. The return of authority to local government officials and the rule of law \nsupported through the demilitarization and demobilization of former combatants will be necessary \nto fully restore irrigation management to mirabs and the community. Fortunately, the condition of \nthe mirab institutions in the lower Hari Rud River Basin is robust, and most of the mirabs are well-\nestablished and have good relations with MEW and provincial officials. Community support is \nstrong as witnessed by the thousands of laborers participating in canal maintenance during 2004 \nand  2005  in  the  western  basins  observed  by  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  missions  and \ntechnical assistance consultants. \n \n13.  Traditional Water Allocation. Traditional irrigation in Afghanistan has a water allocation \nsystem based on irrigated area that dates back several centuries. In Northern Afghanistan, the \npaikal is the basic unit for water allocation, and it corresponds to both a unit of land as well as the \nmeasure of a flow of water for irrigation.10 Paikal land also refers to the agricultural land type (i.e., \nirrigated  land),  and  historically  specific  taxes  were  paid  on  paikal  land.  The  taxes  paid \ncorresponded  to  the  size  of  the  landholding,  and  accordingly  the  water  allocation  was  also \n                                                 \n9  The discussion presents a generalized view based mainly on northern and western areas, and actual arrangements \nand terminology differ from system to system. In some areas, the term wakil is used to refer to the mirab bashi, or \nwakil will sometimes assist the mirab with defining allocation and distribution.  \n10 Paikal is used in northern Afghanistan, while in the west the basic unit for land and water is the juftgau, yet the concept \nand allocation methods are the same. \n ", "Appendix 3  33\ncontingent on the paikal tax paid. A paikal does not always appear to be uniform, but is usually \nbetween 350 to about 500 jeribs of land (one jerib equals 1,953 square meters), and its size may \ndepend on whether it is located in the head or the tail of the irrigation system. A paikal is converted \nto a unit water allocation through a corresponding unit-width that allows the water to pass through \na control structure to the corresponding irrigated area within the irrigation system, which is called a \npaikal width. \n \n14.  Water allocation is thus proportional among different off-takes from a river as well as within \nthe system at canal structures; each with a prescribed allocation that corresponds to the area to be \nirrigated and a width of intake or division structure. The allocation system is based on continuous \nflow and does not account for changes of level in the river or in the canal, so volume of delivery is \nnot  constant,  yet  is  roughly  proportional.  As  one  moves  down  the  canal  system,  rotation  is \npracticed in some systems with complex distribution schedules that involve hourly rotations on as \nhigh as a monthly rotation cycle in some lower level canals. In northern Afghanistan, current paikal \nallocations were formalized into law in 1925 and 1926, although the canals and practices date back \nseveral centuries commensurate with the irrigation systems. Strict adherence to the traditional \nallocation system has weakened in some cases, and even when the paikal system is adhered to it \nis still imprecise. However, all mirabs and irrigated landholders are aware of the system and at \nleast superficially acknowledge the system and their particular paikal allocations and rotations. \nMost importantly, most Afghan farmers understand how the system works and irrigate with the \nexpectation of a limited allocation. \n \n2.  Agriculture \n15.  Agriculture has always been vital to the national economy and plays a central role in \nAfghanistan\u2019s redevelopment efforts and poverty reduction. Agriculture, however, suffered during \nthe last 25 years due to deterioration of supporting infrastructure, including irrigation and prolonged \ndroughts. Afghans are assiduous farmers, and with recent stability complemented by better rains, \nthe agriculture sector is rebounding. Farmers have access to improved seed as well as fertilizer \nwhere  water  supplies  are  reliable;  however,  inadequate  knowledge  of  improved  agricultural \nproduction processes, lack of assured and timely irrigation, weak institutional capacity of the \nprivate and public sectors, and lack of credit and access to markets pose constraints in some \nlocations. The Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Food (MAAHF) is the Government \nagency responsible for agricultural development. ADB\u2019s Agriculture Sector Program loan11 provides \nguiding policy principles that were discussed in detail with the Government and lays out a road \nmap to sector reform and growth. \n \n16.  Agriculture in the Western Basins. Although a large ministry, MAAHF has weak capacity \nin Kabul and in the provinces. The MAAHF office in Herat does have a staff of over 400 employees \nincluding officers in the 16 districts of the province. However, the office has fewer than 100 \ntechnical  staff  and  their  competence  is  low.  MAAHF  resources  to  support  extension  work, \ntransport, or research are limited or nonexistent. Much of the support to MAAHF, including vehicles \nand equipment, has been provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \nwhich has been operating in Afghanistan continually through the Taliban time. Nongovernment \norganizations also provide some agricultural support services. \n \n17.  The western basins, especially the Hari Rud River Basin, have an agricultural history dating \nback centuries with traditional irrigation. Agriculture is based on a wheat and opportunistic summer \ncrop/fallow  rotation  with  increasing  importance  of  rice,  vegetables,  and  fruit  where  water  is \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Islamic \nRepublic of Afghanistan for the Agriculture Sector Program. Manila. \n ", "34  Appendix 3 \navailable. During the period of civil unrest, horticulture declined due to lack of investment and \ndrought. Dried fruits, such as raisins and apricots, and nuts, including almond and pistachios, have \ndiminished in importance, partly due to international competition. The disruption of conflict and \nreduced investment in these longer term crops has reduced volumes quantity and competitiveness. \nDespite this, vegetable production is now increasing close to population centers and new high-\nvalue  crops  such  as  saffron  are  slowly  emerging.  A  strong  agricultural  base  still  exists,  but \nproductivity is low and farmers need improved irrigation as well as extension services to help them \ntake advantage of higher value opportunities.  \n \n18.  Local Agriculture Demand. Substantial unmet demand currently exists for food in the \nwestern basins, and given population and income growth, the vast majority of additional food \nproduced through the intensification of agriculture in the western basins will be consumed locally. \nRainfall is insufficient and unreliable, so improved irrigated agriculture or imports must provide the \nincremental  volume,  quality,  and  diversity  of  regional  and  national  production.  The  expected \nincremental annual demand for vegetables and potatoes is expected to exceed 30,000 tons by \n2015, which could be met locally through increased production from improved irrigation. Regional \ndemand  for  an  incremental  90,000  tons  of  wheat  is  unlikely  to  be  fully  satisfied  from  local \nproduction,  so  increases  in  wheat  production  will  have  a  strong  local  market.  Some  of  the \nincremental productivity will be consumed within households and therefore help improve food \nsecurity. Economic growth by 2015 is estimated to cause a 30% increase in per capita demand for \nfood, which will strengthen demand for higher value crops. \n \n3.  Water Resources Management \n19.  Policy Framework. The Irrigation Department is responsible for integrated water resources \nmanagement (IWRM), and the policy framework for IWRM and irrigated agriculture is emerging. \nThe Strategic Framework for the Water Sector, approved by the Cabinet in May 2004, commits to \nthe following six principles which is consistent with ADB\u2019s Water Policy (i) decentralization of \nplanning, development, and management of water resources to river basins; (ii) delivery of water \nservices  by  autonomous  and  accountable  institutions;  (iii)  sustainable  water  use  within  a \ntransparent policy framework; (iv) participatory and consultative processes; (v) a program of long-\nterm capacity building, budget support, and research; and (vi) equitable treatment of international \nwaters. In accordance with these principles, the Government issued policies on water resources \nand irrigation during 2004. The specific objectives of the irrigation policy are \u201cto develop and \nmanage irrigation systems cost-effectively; ensure technical, social, institutional, and environmental \nsustainability; and promote user participation in local water management that can ensure overall \nincrease in production and productivity of agriculture.\" Based on the principles found in the various \npolicies, MEW is currently drafting a revised water law that was last amended in 1981. Although \nthe policy framework is being established with external assistance, developing the implementation \narrangements as well as the capacity (both human and technical) especially at the provincial and \nregional level to realize the policies poses a long-term challenge. \n \n20.  Groundwater.  Groundwater  falls  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Ministry  of  Mines  and \nIndustry, and a groundwater management strategy is currently under preparation through ADB\u2019s \nAgriculture Sector Program loan (footnote 9). However, applying and implementing the strategy in \na particular groundwater basin and developing a management plan will require time and capacity. \nInitial assessments indicate that the Hari Rud River Basin has significant groundwater potential \neven though it has remained largely unexploited. Both shallow and deep wells are increasing in the \narea and this trend is expected to accelerate as incomes rise. Although offering tremendous \nopportunity, insufficient information exists regarding sustainable groundwater yields. Once this \ninformation  is  known,  a  basin  management  plan  can  be  developed  to  support  sustainable \ndevelopment of groundwater. \n \n ", "Appendix 4  35\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO AFGHANISTAN FOR  \nWATER RESOURCES AND IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE \n \n \nProject  Duration  Source  Type  Amount \n($ million) \n1.

Types of Projects \n1.  The process for identifying subproject investments is based on experience gained in \ncore subproject selection and investigation. While the core subprojects prepared under the \nproject preparatory technical assistance (TA)1  focused on irrigation rehabilitation and upgrading \n(R&U), some subprojects executed under the Western Basins Water Resources Management \nProject (the Project) are expected to include a wider range and type of works. These may \ninclude  (i)  weirs  for  control  of  diversions  of  ephemeral  flows  and  increased  groundwater \nrecharge, (ii) other flood control activities, (iii) small storages for domestic and irrigation supply \npurposes,  and  (iv)  development  of  groundwater  resources  through  infiltration  galleries  or \npumping technology among others. \n \n2.  Overall Rationale and Spatial Disposition of Additional Investments. In selecting \nadditional  candidate  subprojects,  the  following  rationale  will  be  applied:  (i)  Irrigation  system \nrehabilitation is based on unit area (irrigable) cost of roughly from $300 to $700 per hectare (ha), \nalthough a 12% internal rate of return is the defining economic criterion. (ii) Approximately $3.5 \nmillion is to be invested in nonirrigation works, flood protection, small storage, and weirs. If these \nsubprojects are not viable, funds will be reinvested in irrigation R&U. (iii) Irrigation system R&U \nwithin  subbasins  are  to  be  roughly  pro  rata  by  irrigation  command  area  per  subbasin \n(requirements may also be included for district distribution) divided at about 80% to Hari Rud and \n20% to Murghab River Basin, subject to confirmation after investigation. Based on these criteria, \nan  estimated  45,000  ha  will  receive  R&U  under  the  Project,  of  which  approximately  15\u201325 \nschemes will be in the Hari Rud River Basin for about 55,000 ha and an additional 3\u201310 schemes \nin the Murghab River Basin for about 10,000 ha. This is approximately 50% of the area intensively \nirrigated in western basins.  \n \nB.  Criteria to Screen New Investments  \n3.  Based on the experience in the selection of the TA subprojects, and to facilitate timely \nacceptance or rejection of potential new subprojects, screening criteria (Table A5.1) will be used \nfor subprojects. They will be refined as the Project progresses. Given the poor quality of the \npresent  data  as  well  as  difficulty  in  defining  absolute  development  objectives  to  prioritize \nsubprojects (i.e., equity, efficiency, poverty), an exclusionary approach will be used versus a \nranking or weighting system. Many of the irrigation schemes and potential water resources \ndevelopment subprojects will meet the criteria (Table A5.1). Selection of subprojects will be \nundertaken  by  the  project  implementation  committee  with  the  support  from  the  project \nmanagement unit. Selection of the first five subprojects will be approved by Asian Development \nBank (ADB), and if found acceptable, further subproject selection will not require ADB approval \nexcept those over $3 million. \n \nC.  Investment Plan \n4.  The identification of new subprojects will initially focus on systems within the Hari Rud \nRiver Basin. This approach is based on the support from the project management unit, rationale \nof proximity, extension of lessons learned from core subprojects, and the distribution of systems \nwithin the project area.

The Western Basin Water Resources Management Project (the Project) will support the \nrehabilitation and upgrading (R&U) of traditional irrigation schemes under the Project and will \nbenefit about 55,000 irrigable hectares (ha).1 The civil works will be combined with agricultural \nand livelihood services, and institutional strengthening for the mirabs (traditional community \nwater managers), the Irrigation Department within Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW), and \nproject participants. The Project will also include income-generating activities for women and the \nlandless. The following analysis is based on the interventions proposed under the Project. \n \n2.  Project Costs. The total project financial cost is estimated at $87.6 million, including \ncontingencies, taxes and duties, and interest during implementation. The base cost (excluding \ntaxes and duties) for component 2, which includes irrigation R&U for the Hari Rud River Basin \nand Murghab River Basin, the water resources and development subcomponent, and mirab \ncapacity development and operation and maintenance (O&M), is $52.7 million. The assumed \ninvestment costs for irrigation R&U are about $565 per irrigable ha based on the estimated \nsubproject R&U costs. The base cost for component 1, integrated water resources management \nis $7.9 million; component 3, agriculture and livelihood services $8.5 million; and component 4, \ncapacity development and project management $8.6 million.  \n \n3.  Integrated  Water  Resources  Management.  Although  quantifiable  benefits  are  not \nattributed to this component, the activities will provide support for surface and groundwater \nmanagement  that  are  essential  for  long-term  development  and  economic  sustainability  of \nirrigated agriculture in the Hari Rud River Basin and Murghab River Basin. Improved surface \nwater allocation will not only ensure maximum productivity, but also equity among upstream and \ndownstream water users. \n \n4.  Capacity Development. Capacity development will help ensure long-term sustainability of \nproject  benefits  and  help  Afghanistan\u2019s  long-term  redevelopment;  however,  these  costs  are \nexcluded from the project analysis. Improved capacity of MEW will facilitate further irrigation R&U in \nthe region and throughout Afghanistan to extend project benefits. \n \nA.  Methodology and Main Assumptions \n \n5.  Economic and financial analyses were carried out for three core subprojects prepared \nunder the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) to assess economic viability and the \nfinancial impact on households. Economic analysis of the overall Project is also presented. \nSensitivity analysis on the subprojects and the Project as a whole were conducted. Farm \nbudgets  for  various  wealth  groups  were  estimated  to  assess  project  impacts  on  farm \nhouseholds.  With-project  and  without-project  scenarios  were  simulated  to  determine  the \nincremental project benefits. \n \n6.  Costs. Project financial costs were estimated in afghanis (AFs) using prices prevailing in \nthe first half of 2005, and expressed in constant prices over the project implementation period of \n7  years.  Financial  prices  were  derived  from  local  sources  and  include  taxes  and  duties. \nEconomic prices were derived based on the following criteria: (i) a domestic price numeraire; (ii) \nvalues expressed in constant 2005 prices to exclude inflation; (iii) a standard conversion factor \nof 0.9 for nontraded goods and services; (iv) a shadow value of 0.6 for unskilled and agricultural \nlabor to take account of the labor surplus in rural areas; (v) border parity pricing with standard \nmethods to derive farm-gate input/output prices for major tradable commodities and goods; and \n                                                 \n1  The Project also provides funds for an additional 6,500 ha of R&U of irrigated areas or an equivalent benefit in \nwater resources subprojects.  \n ", "  Appendix 10  45\n(vi) transfer payments, such as taxes and subsidies being excluded in calculating economic \nvalues. \n \n7.  The main agricultural inputs are labor, seeds, fertilizer, and animal and mechanical \npower. The prevailing wage rate of AF65 a day is adjusted by the opportunity cost of labor. \nSeeds are valued at their border price equivalent adjusted by a 20% premium to reflect storage \ncosts and higher quality. Animal and mechanical power is valued at financial prices adjusted by \nthe standard conversion factor. The economic prices of the main tradable agricultural outputs \n(rice, wheat) and inputs (fertilizers) are based on import price equivalents since the prospect of \ndomestic  cultivation/manufacture  for  export  is  limited.  Afghanistan  might  possibly  produce \ntemporary wheat surpluses in a good year, but it is currently importing and the implications of \npotential exports have been discounted. Raisins have been valued at their export-equivalent to \nrepresent a possible export opportunity. For nontraded commodities (most vegetables, grapes, \netc.)  the  local  financial  price  is  adjusted  by  the  standard  conversion  factor  to  reach  the \neconomic price. \n \nB.  Subproject Overview \n \n8.  Subprojects. For the three irrigation diversion subprojects, the economic and financial \nanalysis  is  based  on  costs  including  investment  costs  for  R&U,  agricultural  and  livelihood \nsupport  services,  management  and  O&M,  and  an  allocation  for  management  overheads. \nAgricultural benefits are derived from crop budgets, incorporating expected changes in yields, \ncropping patterns, and the extension of the irrigated area.2 The R&U costs for each subproject \nwere estimated based on the design of the proposed structures and R&U works prepared during \nthe TA. In addition to R&U, costs for agricultural and livelihood support services are included \nand distributed based on a per ha basis. Management overheads are derived and allocated on \na per hectare basis for both the subprojects and the overall project costing. \n \n9.  Overview of Subproject Costs. Costs for R&U among the subprojects (Jui Nau, Sare \nPul, and Yahia Abad) varied from just over $1,000 to about $360 per ha depending on the \nrequired works. Differing costs were more a function of the systems design and layout than of \nthe condition of the systems since all systems are extremely deteriorated and need R&U. The \narea of R&U in the subprojects varied from 900 to 5,200 ha. \n \n10.  Subproject Returns and Sensitivity Analysis. The expected internal rate of return \n(EIRR) from the subprojects, based on a 20-year life, varies from 21% to 15%.3 Sensitivity \nanalysis was carried out to test the impact of changes and main risks: (i) a 20% increase or \ndecrease  of  investment  costs,  (ii)  a  20%  increase  or  decrease  in  recurrent  costs  (i.e., \nmanagement  O&M),  (iii)  a  20%  increase  or  decrease  in  benefits,  (iv)  a  20%  increase  or \ndecrease in implementation management costs, or (v) an increase (25 years) or decrease (15 \nyears) in project life. Table A10 presents the findings from the analysis and sensitivity tests of \nthe diversion subprojects. The Sari Pul irrigation diversion system has the weakest financial \nreturns but also the highest investment costs at $1,006/ha. The most robust subproject is the \nYahia Abad subproject, which is viable except with a 20% reduction in benefits.  \n \n                                                 \n2  The irrigation diversion subprojects also include some works for flood control to protect the irrigation systems but \nthese benefits are not included in the analysis. \n3  Flood protection benefits varied widely with assumed probabilities and damage functions; economically attractive \nflood control subprojects may exist in the western basins, but they will require evaluation on an individual basis \nbefore being included as a subproject. \n ", "46  Appendix 10 \nTable A10: Subproject Economic Internal Rate of Return (%) and Sensitivity Tests \nScenario  Jui Nau  Sare Pul  Yahia Abad \nNo management cost  32  21  28 \nBase with management  21  15  19 \n+20% investment cost  18  12  16 \n-20% investment cost  23  17  22 \n+20% recurrent cost  21  14  18 \n-20% recurrent costs  21  15  19 \n+20% benefits  32  24  32 \n-20% benefits  10  6  7 \n+20% management cost  19  14  17 \n-20% management cost  22  16  20 \n15-year project life  19  12  17 \n25-year project life  21  16  19 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC.  The Jui Nau Canal Irrigation Scheme \n \n11.  Subproject Overview. The Jui Nau is typical of the larger irrigation systems in the lower \nHari Rud River Basin and provides an excellent example of the type and range of R&U activities \nto be executed under the Project. The Jui Nau main canal is 32 km and has five branch canals \nthat vary in length from 2.2 to 8.5 km for a total length of 22 km. All of the system\u2019s canals are \nseverely degraded and have poor profiles. The main canal has 101 discharge points; 45 occur \nat 17 major bifurcations, which account for nearly 70% of total discharge. The condition of \ndischarge points is very poor with need for R&U of structure and improved design. In some \ncases, the downstream sections and adjacent banks are severely undercut and eroded. Major \nstructures in the system include (i) a main canal 1.5 km inverted siphon; (ii) a 25 meter (m) \naqueduct where failure is imminent; (iii) two flood spillways; and (iv) 84 foot and vehicle bridges \nthat cross the main canal and vary widely in dimension, construction, and condition. The canal \nprovides domestic and livestock water supply; however, these uses are not included in the \nanalysis. \n \n12.  Subproject Cost. The total area within the canal network is about 7,500 ha however, \nonly about 5,200 ha are irrigable, and usually about 3,300 ha are irrigated for a spring wheat \ncrop with much less irrigated for summer crops.4 The total estimated cost of the R&U is about \n$1.8 million: (i) 45% for canal R&U, (ii) 23% to protect the canal network from flood damage, (iii) \n14% for upgrading intakes, (iv) 10% for bridges, and (v) 8% for R&U of minor and major control \nand conveyance structures. The cost is $355 per ha of R&U based on the 5,200 ha of irrigable \narea plus $55 for survey and design. An additional $90 per ha is the estimated cost of the \nagricultural support service, livelihood service, and income-generating activities, and training for \nthe farmers and the mirabs to accompany the irrigation R&U.5 \n \n13.  Subproject Benefits. The present cropping pattern in the Jui Nau is dominated by \nwheat planted in the spring. Of the remainder of the cropped area, feed and fodder, orchards, \nand  vineyards  account  for  10  to  20%;  and  vegetables,  cotton,  and  maize  make  up  the \nremainder. A small percentage of less than 5% is cropped in the summer. The Project will \nprovide the following (i) R&U to improve the equity and efficiency of water distribution, (ii) \nimproved water management through capacity development of the mirabs and communities, (iii) \nagricultural  support  services  and  capacity  development  for  farmers  to  improve  agricultural \n                                                 \n4  As with all of the traditional irrigation systems, they have no plans or design as they were built by communities and \nevolved over the centuries; so exact measurements or a \u201cdesign command area\u201d do not exist. \n5  Some of the training activities under the project analysis are included under capacity development and their costs \nexcluded from analysis of the overall Project. \n ", "  Appendix 10  47\npractices, and (iv) improved irrigation system intakes. The improved intakes with infiltration \ngalleries will increase water capture efficiency and provide more reliable summer flows with \nabout 40% more water entering the system; nearly 60% of this water will benefit tail-end \nfarmers. The cropped area for wheat is anticipated to increase from 3,300 ha to 4,100 ha in an \naverage  season  although  will  be  much  higher  in  years  of  good  rainfall.  Wheat  yields  are \nassumed to increase from a low base of 2.0 tons per ha (t/ha) to 2.8 t/ha.6 Of the incremental \n800 ha that will receive irrigation (3,300\u20134,100) in the without-project situation, one half is \nassumed to be fallow land and the other half rainfed wheat, with yields of 1.0 t/ha or less. \nHowever, in dry years, the yield is much lower or nothing at all. Given the increased summer \nflows and growing demand in the basin, second season cropping for vegetables is anticipated to \nincrease  from  100  ha  to  500  ha  or  about  10%  of  the  irrigable  area  with  average  yields \nincreasing from 8.0 to 9.5 t/ha. Vineyard area is anticipated to increase from an existing 50 ha to \n130 ha with yields rising from 6.5 to 8.0 t/ha. \n \n14.  Structural Failure. In addition to the yield increases, the civil works for Jui Nau provide \nflood protection for system structures and provide benefits through mitigation of risk of structural \nfailure. This risk is beyond normal deterioration due to lack of O&M since catastrophic incidents \nare possible with or without O&M. In the case of the Jui Nau, several failures are possible: (i) \nthe loss of the spring intake and/or major breach or loss of the main canal at the head of the \nsystem, which could result in a total loss in spring value-added from irrigation; (ii) the loss of the \nsiphon that traverses a major wash and could affect 75% of the irrigable area; (iii) the loss of the \naqueduct, which is imminent, and would affect about 60% of the irrigable area; and (iv) the loss \nof the main canal where it parallels a major wash, which would impact about 60% of the system. \nLoss of a major structure or a substantial portion of the main canal could result in the loss of \nboth spring and summer irrigation benefits and perennial crops such as vineyards.  \n \n15.  The loss from the wheat crop is greater than the other crops due to the much greater \nextent of wheat cultivation even if irrigation is lost throughout the year. As the Project supports \nincreased summer cropping and improved yields, the loss potential also increases from system \nfailure. Although these benefits are not included in the EIRR of the overall project assessment, \nthey provide strong support for project interventions.7 Similar risks of failure posed by the Jui \nNau are found in most of the schemes in the Hari Rud River Basin due to the intake technology, \nthe flood hydrology, and lack of flood protection improvements. \n  \n16.  Farmer Financial Benefits. About 7,000 families live in the total command area with a \ntotal farm area of 5,210 ha.8 Land ownership is heavily skewed, with about 15% of families who \nare self-classified as the \u201cmedium\u201d wealth group farming nearly 40% of the area in small farms \nof about 2 ha. Another 40% of the farmed area is held by \u201cpoor\u201d and \u201cvery poor\u201d families in very \nsmall holdings of less than 1 ha. Landlords rent out the remaining 20% for sharecropping to \npoor, very poor, and landless families.9 Landless families in the subproject area, number over \n3,000 although not all are engaged in farming activities. The poor farmer has an average \nlandholding of about 0.8 ha. The incremental benefits to the poor farmer are primarily from \nwheat production, and in some cases vegetables. The net margin to the poor farmer will be an \nannual increase income from AF8,564 ($200) to about AF18,555 ($434) or a gain of $234, \n                                                 \n6  The assumed yield increases are modest given the current low baseline. The national average yield for irrigated \nwheat in 2003 was 2.8 t/ha with many districts having yields of 3.0 to 3.7 t/ha. \n7  In the case of the Jui Nau, the failure of the intake leading to 100% loss of wheat crop with a 1 in 5 year probability \nwould lead to about 25% EIRR, if prevented through project activities. In the case of the loss of the aqueduct and \n50% of the cropped area for the entire year based on a 1 in 10 year probability would lead to an EIRR about 30% if \nprevented by the Project. \n8  As with all statistics in Afghanistan, a great deal of uncertainty exists. \n9  Income classification is based on the National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment, World Food Program and \nMinistry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, 2004. Figures should be seen as indicative since data in \nAfghanistan is sparse and of questionable reliability. \n ", "48  Appendix 10 \nabout 117%. In many cases, a large portion of the increased grain production will be consumed, \nwhich will provide a large benefit for food security and better nutrition in the region. \n \n17.  Recurrent and Incremental O&M Costs in the Jui Nau. O&M costs for the subproject \nhave traditionally been borne by the community, and the communities are expected to continue \nto carry out the majority of the O&M after R&U in the subproject area. In the case of the Jui Nau \nsubproject, which is typical of most O&M arrangements in traditional irrigation schemes, O&M \ncosts include (i) a current in-kind management fee for the mirab, (ii) labor donated by the \ncommunity for annual O&M, and (iii) incremental costs to maintain the system after R&U is \ncompleted under the Project. Currently, a farmer pays about AF45 (a little over $1) per ha \nthrough an in-kind wheat contribution by both active and absentee landlords at the end of the \nirrigation season. The contribution is in relation to their water allocation, which depends on their \nirrigated landholding. Based on the typical area of responsibility for a mirab, this amounts to \nabout $225 per mirab.10 The fees are generally considered to be low, and mirabs themselves \nare generally farmers or have other means of income. \n \n18.  The largest O&M cost is the annual desilting of the canals while the irrigation system is \nclosed prior to the spring season. In the Jui Nau, main canal maintenance is organized within \nsystem sections; upper (head), middle, and lower (tail). Landowners are required to supply their \nown or hired labor at the rate of 4 labor units per zoj (water allocation unit). The desilting takes \nabout 30 days with a workforce of about 1,000 laborers. Approximately 90,000 cubic meters of \nsediment is removed from the main canal at an equivalent cost of $40,000 to $50,000. Illegal \nbridges are also removed along other minor repairs. Individual communities maintain branch \nand lower canals and their structures in addition to main canal desilting. About $9 to $11 per ha \nis being supplied by farmers, which is equivalent to about 7\u201310 days of labor. This is in addition \nto the little over $1 management fee that is being paid to the mirabs. \n \n19.  Incremental O&M. The R&U under the Project implies incremental maintenance costs \nabove  current  desilting  requirements;  primarily  to  maintain  the  improved  intakes  and  the \ninfiltration galleries. It also includes works to maintain the bifurcations and other improved \ncontrol structures that will be a part of the R&U. These incremental costs will be about $2.6/ha \nper year, which represents about a 25% increase in the O&M contribution currently being made \nby the community. Given the net margins anticipated from the Project, even for the poor farmer, \nthis represents a little over 1% of the incremental income generated from the financial returns of \nthe Project, and well within the ability of the farmer to pay. The project approach will be to \nprovide  flexibility  so  the  mirabs  and  communities  have  the  options  to  accomplish  O&M; \nhowever,  a  community  agreement(s)  will  be  created  for  each  subproject  to  define  the \ncommunity\u2019s responsibilities and commitment to execute O&M and management. \n \n20.  Economic Return and Sensitivity. Sensitivity was conducted for the subproject (Table \nA10).  The  scheme  is  relatively  robust.  Management  costs  for  the  Project  and  recurrent \nmanagement and O&M costs have the least amount of influence on the subproject causing at \nmost a 1% positive or negative change in subproject returns. Investment cost also has little \nimpact and a 20% increase only causes the scheme to lose 3% on EIRR. The switching value is \nan  increase  of  120%. The  scheme  is  most susceptible to  a  reduction  in  benefits;  a  20% \ndecrease reduces the EIRR to 10%. The switching value is a 16% reduction in benefits. \n \nD.  Overall Project Economic and Sensitivity Analysis \n21.  Agricultural Benefits. The overall project benefits are based on the aggregate total of \nthe subproject benefits from the TA subprojects. The benefits include the following: (i) an \nincrease in wheat yields by about 40% from a low baseline yield from 1.7 to 2.0 t ha, (ii) an \n                                                 \n10  In larger systems such as the Jui Nau, the mirab structure is a federated system that has one mirab, responsible for \nthe entire system, with two tiers of mirabs managing the canal network below. \n ", "  Appendix 10  49\nincrease in cropped area for wheat ranging from about 20 to 45% depending on the system, (iii) \nan increase in cropped area for rice of about 30% to 40% in some of the upstream systems, (iv) \nincreases in rice yields of 30 to 40%, (v) an increase in vegetable cropping of about 300% to \n500% from the improved water availability due to enhanced intakes and agriculture support \nservices, (vi) increases in vegetable yields of around 18%, and (vii) increases in vineyards and \ntheir yields. Based on the assumed costs, the Project will provide R&U for about 55,000 ha of \nwhich approximately 15 to 25 schemes will be in the Hari Rud River Basin for about 45,000 ha \nand an additional 3\u201310 schemes in the Murghab River Basin for about 10,000 ha. In addition, \nthe water resources development subcomponent can provide an equivalent of 6,500 ha in \nirrigation R&U or will be used for other water resources projects. The buildup of benefits is \nassumed to take place over 5 years.  \n \n22.  Economic Analysis. Overall, the Project has an EIRR of 17%. Sensitivity analysis to \ntest the effects of changes in the main parameters affecting economic returns reveals the \nfollowing results. A 20% increase in invest costs only caused the EIRR to drop to 15% and the \nswitching value for this parameter was 71% or about $785 per ha based on the assumed R&U \ncost. The recurrent costs had negligible impact when raised or lowered by 20% with the EIRR \nremaining at 17%. Similarly, the management fee only resulted in a change to 15% or 19% \nwhen the management fees were raised or lowered by 20%. The most sensitive parameter that \nnegatively impacted project returns was a 20% decrease in benefits, which dropped the EIRR to \n8%. This finding highlights the importance agricultural support services and O&M.  \n \n23.  Project  Beneficiaries  and  Poverty  Impact.  Based  on  social  data  gathered  during \ndevelopment of the subprojects and basic demographic information in the project area, the \nProject will have a substantial impact on poverty. The average family size in the project area is \nabout seven persons (footnote 9). Farm holdings vary with slightly larger holdings in the upper \nHari Rud than in the lower Hari Rud River Basin, although far less irrigated area is found in the \nupper Hari Rud River Basin. Regardless of the difference, holdings are very small with medium \nwealth farmers holding around 2.5 ha, while in the lower Hari Rud River Basin the holdings for \nmedium income farmers are 1.8 ha. Poor farmers in both areas hold about 0.75 ha, while very \npoor farmers may have 0.2 ha. Sharecroppers typically farm no larger than 1 ha and comprise \naround 25\u201330% of the farmers in a given system. The vast majority of farmers fall into the \nlandless, poor, or very poor category, so that at least 75% of the farmers fall into the poor or \nvery poor group. For the project area, the average landholding is assumed to be no larger than \n1 ha and in many cases much smaller. Given the average family size and that the Project will \nrehabilitate 55,000 ha of irrigated land, the Project is anticipated to have the potential to reach at \nleast 400,000 to 500,000 people in the western basin or 20% to 25% of the population; and \noverwhelming majority of these people will be poor.  \n \n ", "50  Appendix 11 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Background to Framework \n1.  Although resettlement and rehabilitation activities are not anticipated under the Western \nBasin Water Resource Management Project (the Project), a resettlement framework has been \nprepared to mitigate any project-related resettlement impacts. The framework is based on the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Involuntary Resettlement, the Afghan Constitution of 2004, and the \nAfghan Land Acquisition Law of 2000. The ADB policy states that  \n \nThe  involuntary  resettlement  policy  objectives  are  (i)  to  avoid  involuntary  resettlement \nwherever  feasible;  (ii)  to  minimize  resettlement  where  population  displacement  is \nunavoidable  by  choosing  alternative  viable  project  options;  and  (iii)  where  involuntary \nresettlement is unavoidable, to ensure that affected people receive assistance, preferably \nunder the project, so that they will be at least as well off as they would have been in the \nabsence of the project. \n \nThis policy has been followed in the framework, especially in those matters where insufficient or no \nprovision is made in the laws of Afghanistan.  \n \n1.  Afghan Land Acquisition Law of 2000 \n2.  The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (the Government) currently has no formal national \ncompensation and resettlement policy in place. The current policy approach is reflected in the \nConstitution of Afghanistan 2004 and the Land Acquisition Law of 2000. This law provides that land \nacquisition for public use will only occur with prior and fair replacement at current market rates upon \napproval by the Cabinet. Part 2 of the law prescribes that replacements will be provided for (i) land \ncost, (ii) cost of all buildings on the land, (iii) cost of fruit trees, and (iv) other valuable plants on the \nland. It also provides that at the landowner\u2019s option, cropland of a similar value, and a house of \nsuitable standards may be provided instead of monetary compensation. A further article provides \nfor compensation to be paid for the input costs of unharvested crops. The law requires notification \nof amounts of compensation to be made 3 months in advance. This allows time for those affected \nto dispute any amount to a compensation committee (CC), which has been sanctioned by the \nMinistry of Energy and Water (MEW), or to follow the complaints and disputes procedures outlined \nhere. \n \n3.  Article  10  of  Land  Acquisition  Law  provides  for  the  compensation  for  all  land  to  be \ndetermined by the Cabinet, taking into account land quality and location, and this responsibility can \nbe delegated to a ministry. In the past, this has been implemented by the Cabinet setting a range of \ncompensation levels for different classes and locations of land with the CC being left to decide \nactual amounts for each individual parcel. Article 11 provides for the assessment of costs (not \nvalues) of buildings for compensation purposes to be based on a table of building prices to be \nproduced by the local authority. Landowners are permitted to salvage and remove materials from \nbuildings in addition to being paid compensation or being supplied with replacement land and \nhousing. The replacement costs of fruit trees are to be decided by the local authority and the \nMinistry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Food (MAAHF). \n \n4.  The Land Acquisition Law makes no specific provision for restoration of income of for \ncompensation for temporary use of land, yet the law does not appear to preclude the Government \nfrom recognizing and making compensation or rehabilitation payments for additional eligibilities. \nThe Land Acquisition Law makes no provision for compensation or rehabilitation assistance being \npaid to squatters or those without legal ownership documentation. However, it does not define legal \nownership documents. In Afghanistan, unregistered written deeds of sale and purchase of land \nhave been the most common form of ownership documentation for over 50 years and have come to  \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  51\nbe accepted by the courts and land administration officials if they are supported by testimony. Other \nrecognized documents are unregistered wills or statements from neighbors and elders of the \nrelevant village or town that the purported owner has inherited the land in accordance with the \nShari\u2019a law. Water rights allocations recorded by MEW in Herat and records of land tax payments in \nrespect of unregistered land held by the Taxation Department are also accepted as evidence of \nland ownership.  \n \n5.  As a result of the foregoing, the law will need to be supplemented in each resettlement plan \nby making provision for compensation to be paid to all occupants of land or replacement land to be \nmade available. Rehabilitation assistance must also be made available to all those affected in \naccordance  with  the  entitlement  matrix  regardless  of  the  legality  of  their  occupation  of  land \n(Supplementary Appendix C. As the capacity among local officials in all departments in the project \narea to carry out the implementation of resettlement plans is limited, the project management unit \n(PMU) and consultants will train local officials involved with implementation of the Project. \n \n2.  Land Ownership   \n6.  As  noted,  land  ownership  and  leasehold  tenures  are  sometimes  not  evidenced  by \nregistered legal documents, accepted methods of establishing ownership will enable the actual \nownership and lawful occupation of any affected land to be established. Time and effort in following \nalternative procedures to confirm actual ownership and lawful occupation of land and buildings will \nbe accommodated in the time frames prescribed in each resettlement plan. The CC and PMU will \nensure that sufficient resources are available to assist those affected, who may not have official \nlegal documents of ownership for all or part of their affected land, to prepare whatever other \nevidence of ownership may be available to them. \n \n3.  Entitlements \n7.  Compensation, rehabilitation assistance, and other allowances for losses are shown in the \nentitlement matrix. To ensure that compensation rates are equivalent to current replacement costs, \nthe headman, representatives of those affected, and other district officials must be consulted by the \nCC and the PMU before deciding compensation. Current market prices for property will be used. \n \nB.  Implementation \n1.  Preparation of Subproject Resettlement Plans \n8.  Subproject Preparation Identification. The initial social assessment (ISA) carried out \nduring the identification stage will determine the expected resettlement impact for each subproject. \nScoping and preparation for land acquisition, compensation, and resettlement and rehabilitation \nassistance  will  be  part  of  the  ISA.  The  following  defines  the  procedures:  (i)  Based  on  the \npreliminary subproject design, identify the impact class of the subproject: (a) no project impacts; (b) \nnonsignificant  project  impacts,  including  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  that  are  deemed \nsignificant but still require a short resettlement plan; and (c) significant project impacts\u2014200 or \nmore persons will be physically displaced for housing or lose more than 10% of their productive \nassets (income generating). (ii) In further refining of the subproject physical design, consultation \nmust be undertaken with potential officials representing those affected, PMU, and MEW to avoid or \nminimize adverse project affects as much as possible. (iii) In the case or impacts, carry out a \nsocioeconomic survey of potential people affected as part of the ISA. This should include the \nsocioeconomic data of those affected and measurement of type and level of loss. The follow-up \ncensus survey carried out after detail designs are available will establish the cut-off date for the \neligibility of entitlement. It must be carried out with representation of relevant local authorities. (iv) In \nparallel with the census survey of people affected, consultation must be continued with those \n ", "52  Appendix 11 \naffected to identify their preferences and any special needs that the resettlement plan needs to \naddress. In addition, information on market prices for land, crops, and other assets must be \ncollected. (v) Prepare a resettlement plan (a short plan would be prepared in the case of a \nsubproject with nonsignificant impact and a full plan for a project with significant impacts). The \nentitlement matrix must be used for each subproject by specifying in detail the number of people \naffected, area of land affected, number of other assets affected, and compensation amount for each \ncategory. Resettlement plans should include an inventory of those affected and a list of their \nentitlements, and other relevant detailed information. (vi) Present the draft resettlement plan at the \npublic meeting for the subproject. Any comments made during the meeting must be documented \nand addressed or incorporated in the draft resettlement plan. \n \n9.  Subproject Appraisal. The two principal issues to be addressed in the assessment of each \nsubproject are (i) whether or not, at the public hearing on the subproject proposal, the subproject \nwas shown to have no significant negative social impact and the meeting accepted this; and (ii) \nwhether or not adequate measures have been set out in the subproject feasibility study to prevent \nor resolve any impact or conflict identified. If either the short or full resettlement plan is prepared, it \nmust be submitted to the PMU and MEW as part of the social assessment, together with other \nstudies carried out for the subproject. All resettlement plans and associated reports will be sent to \nADB for review and approval. If the ISA and resettlement survey for subprojects identify new \ncategories of affected people and types of loss not represented in the entitlement matrix, it will be \nrevised accordingly by the PMU and CC and approved by MEW and ADB. \n \n2.  Organizational Framework for Implementation of Resettlement Plans  \n10.  MEW  will  establish  a  project  implementation  committee  (PIC),  which  will  have  overall \nresponsibility for executing resettlement plans and the payment of compensation and rehabilitation \nassistance by the CC to all those affected. However, the PMU will be responsible for oversight of \nsubproject  resettlement  plans  and  implementing  and  monitoring  day-to-day  activities  including \ncoordination with civil works, financial management regarding resettlement, and reporting to the \nPIC. The PMU will contract suitable individuals, firms, or nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to \ncarry out the preparation and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of any resettlement plan. The \nProject will support an input from an international resettlement specialist to recruit local assistance \nto execute resettlement activities and refine resettlement procedures. The PMU will work closely \nwith local authorities in preparing, implementing, and monitoring all land acquisition, compensation, \nand resettlement and rehabilitation assistance work. MEW in Herat will work with the PMU to (i) \nprepare the resettlement plan and its budget; (ii) establish CCs; and (iii) issue guidelines to mitigate \nadverse  project  affects,  including  land  acquisition,  compensation,  structures,  crops  and  other \nassets, resettlement activities, and rehabilitation assistance. The PIC will designate representatives \nfor the CC, identify and retain needed NGO support, and establish all necessary procedures within \n8 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n11.  Compensation Committee. A CC will be established for each subproject that includes \nresettlement, and will include representatives from the district governor\u2019s office (preferable the \ndistrict governor or deputy district governor), the village headmen, two representatives from the PIC \nincluding one of whom is a representative of the provincial governors office; a mirab1, or other \ncommunity irrigation official; those affected; and the PMU. In subprojects where more than one \nvillage is involved in resettlement activities, a separate CC should be created for each village \nalthough representation from the district, PIC, and PMU may be the same. The district governor's \n                                                 \n1  Mirabs are the traditionally selected community members who are responsible for the management and operations \nand maintenance of the irrigation systems. \n ", "  Appendix 11  53\noffice will chair the compensation committee. A standing CC can be established in each relevant \ndistrict comprising all of the above-listed members except the landowner or representative of the \nlandowner concerned in each case. The same representatives of the PMU and provincial officials \nshould be members of each standing compensation committee.  \n \n12.  Public Information, Consultation, and Participation. The PMU, in conjunction with \ndistrict and village authorities is responsible for ensuring that all potential people affected are \nproperly and timely informed of the subproject activities intended to be carried out. Information \nto be disseminated should include the type, timing, and scope of work to be implemented; \npotential  impacts;  bases  of  assessing  compensation;  and  rehabilitation  assistance  and \nschedules. The PMU will publish information in Dari (with an English translation to be held by \nthe PMU and included in its report to ADB) summarizing the entitlements to compensation, \nresettlement, and rehabilitation assistance as well as the procedures for making and resolving \ncomplaints and disputes. The PMU will distribute the information to all potentially affected \npeople and to relevant provincial and district officials for their information and use. Using the \ninformation, the PMU will ensure that all entitlements and provisions for resolving complaints \nand disputes are effectively disclosed to and carefully discussed with potential affected people \nincluding (i) entitlements to compensation, (ii) resettlement rehabilitation assistance as well as \nthe system and procedures for making complaints, (iii) initiating disputes, and (iv) obtaining fair \nand impartial consideration and resolution of such issues. \n \n13.  Information dissemination will be assisted by the use of posters in public places, government \noffices, shops, and other places frequented by potential people affected. Public and small group \nmeetings will be the most important feature of the information dissemination process due to the high \nlevel of illiteracy in the subproject areas. During the subproject feasibility ISA, extensive meetings with \npotentially  affected  communities  will  be  carried  out  to  identify  their  needs  and  preferences  for \ncompensation  and  rehabilitation  and  incorporated  into  the  final  resettlement  plan  if  feasible. \nConsultations with key stakeholders during the ISA will ensure a general understanding among \npeople potentially affected regarding the principles of compensation and rehabilitation. Resettlement \nplans and the framework will be disclosed and information made available in accordance with ADB\u2019s \npublic communications policy effective 1 September 2005. \n \n14.  Grievances and Disputes. ADB policy mandates that grievance redress mechanisms for \naffected people are to be established under the resettlement plan unless sufficient procedures are \navailable under the current law. Where those affected are a vulnerable group, resettlement planning \ndecisions  must  be  preceded  by  a  social  preparation  phase  to  enhance  their  participation  in \nnegotiation, planning, and implementation. Mechanisms for resolving grievances are either local \ncommittees  established  for  that  purpose  or  existing  formal  avenues  of  complaint  to  superior \nauthorities or to the courts. Under the Project, an affected person may make a grievance to the village \nheadman, or to the office of the provincial or district governor, the PMU, or MEW verbally or in written \nform. A meeting to address the grievance will be convened between the person and a grievance \nredress committee that will comprise the district governor offices, village headman, mirab, and other \nrepresentatives from the CC present as observers. A representative from the PMU and MEW must be \npresent to cooperate with the grievance redress committee by providing all relevant information and \nto ensure impartial consideration of the grievance. If the grievance redress committee cannot address \nthe person\u2019s concerns to his or her satisfaction within 3 weeks from the receipt of the grievance, the \nmatter can be taken to the district court or the provincial governor or deputy governor. If an application \nis made to the district court and satisfactory resolution is not achieved, the next level of appeal must \nbe the provincial court; not the provincial governor\u2019s office. \n \n15.  The district and provincial hearings of applications and disputes are of an inquisitorial nature \nas opposed to purely adversarial proceedings. Appeals from district courts are heard anew with any \n ", "54  Appendix 11 \nadditional evidence or arguments being considered. Affected people will be exempted from all \nadministrative  and  legal  fees  incurred  in  pursuing  grievances  under  the  grievance  redress \nprocedure. If such fees are payable by law or regulation then they are to be met by the PMU as part \nof the costs of implementing the resettlement plan.  \n \n16.  Implementation. Detailed schedules for resettlement implementation will be included as \npart of the resettlement plan and specific tasks will be enumerated with timelines. The time frame \nmay vary depending on the scope of impact and the number of people affected. \n \n17.  Budget and Support. Although resettlement compensation is not widely envisioned under \nthe Project, $225,000, about 0.6% of the estimated total cost of civil works, has been budgeted as \nthe provision for compensation that the Government may need to pay for compensation. The \nProject is has also set aside money to support consultants and NGOs to support preparation of \nresettlement plans and M&E. The PMU and compensation committee must ensure that the costs of \nland  acquisition  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  assistance  are  included  in  the \noverall  subproject  cost  estimate  and  its  periodic  plans  are  presented  to  the  PIC  and  MEW. \nRehabilitation assistance, survey, staff training, and external monitoring may be financed by the \nproject funds with ADB approval.  \n \n3.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n18.  Monitoring and Evaluation. The PMU with the assistance of consultants, NGOs, and in \ncollaboration with CCs will oversee monitoring of the implementation of resettlement plans. The \nPMU will supervise the compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation assistance, and prepare \nmonthly monitoring reports throughout preparation and execution of the resettlement plan and \ninclude their findings in its quarterly progress reporting. If significant problems are encountered, the \nPMU will notify ADB. The PMU will prepare a standard subproject reporting to monitoring and track \nprogress with resettlement plan implementation. In addition to internal monitoring, the PMU will \nengage a qualified independent external monitor to review and evaluate the subproject resettlement \nplan implementation. The independent monitor will carry out field visits and consultation with those \naffected  with  support  and  cooperation  of  MEW,  MAAHF,  compensation  committee,  and  local \nofficials as required. Monitoring reports will be prepared bimonthly for each subproject and will be \npresented to the PIC for review and provide a basis for any necessary remedial action to ensure \neffective and timely implementation of the resettlement plan. All monitoring and evaluation reports \nwill be sent to ADB for review. \n \n ", "  Appendix 12  55\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The Western Basins Water Resources Management Project (the Project) will operate in the \nmajor river basins in the western Afghanistan provinces of Herat, Ghowr, and Badghis. The Project \nwill target irrigation, agricultural support, and capacity building activities in about 55,000 to 65,000 \nhectares (ha) in the target basins and provide assistance to develop the capacities of stakeholders \nto manage the basins. Engineering activities will be combined with agricultural support services and \ncapacity-building activities aimed at enhancing land productivity and environmental quality. The \nProject takes a sector approach to improving basinwide water resources management and core \nsubproject selection. Using this approach, the Project first prepared criteria for selecting and costing \nan initial set of core subprojects consisting of existing irrigation systems for rehabilitation and \nupgrading (R&U). \n \nB.  Description of the Project  \n2.  The Project consists of four components: (i) integrated water resource management, (ii) \nwater resources and irrigation development, (iii) agricultural and livelihood services, and (iv) project \nmanagement and capacity building. The Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) is the Implementing \nAgency and the Ministry of Finance is the Executing Agency. An initial environmental examination \n(IEE) was conducted in accordance with Asian Develoment Bank (ADB) Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines.1 In addition, the environmental screening process followed the checklist format for \nirrigation projects set forth in ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Agricultural And Natural \nResources Development Projects.2 \n \n3.  The Jui Nau subproject is focused on the R&U of the Jui Nau irrigation system, and works \nshould be completed by year 3 of the Project. The Jui Nau is typical of the larger irrigation systems \nin the lower Hari Rud in terms of water supply and rehabilitation issues, and serves as an example \nof the type and range of rehabilitation measures required for these systems. It is located close to \nheart city. The principal objective of the subproject is the improvement of water availability, efficiency \nof use, and equity of distribution for improved agricultural productivity. It comprises two principle \nelements: (i) development of canal infrastructure and associated system management, and (ii) \nprovision of agricultural and livelihood services. In addition to improved water management an \nadditional benefit is that by rehabilitating permanent structures, operation and maintenance costs \nwill be reduced. The area involves 7,000 plus stakeholder households with an average of seven \npeople per family. Key features of the subproject are summarized in Table A12.1. \n \n4.  General Criteria. The selection criteria for subprojects evolved during the course of the \nproject preparatory technical assistance (TA).3 The final general selection criteria are summarized \nas (i) location within the lower Hari Rud, i.e., within the principal zone of irrigation development and \nwithin the zone of water and land availability; (ii) spatial distribution of works, both on the left and \nright banks as well as in the upper and lower reaches of the lower Hari Rud; (iii) systems that can \ndemonstrate a range of irrigation and water resource works (flood protection, etc.), and associated \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003.

Based on experiences with comparable rehabilitation works, the \nProject used the following environmental criteria for scheme selection to quickly exclude subprojects \nthat are unacceptable. The following criteria will be used to exclude subprojects that would (i) result \nin water rights conflicts that cannot be resolved with downstream water users, (ii) be in an area \nwhere unexploded ordnance cannot be cleared, (iii) have adverse environmental impacts and \nviolate any of ADB's environmental safeguard policies, and (iv) have adverse social effects and \nviolate ADB's social safeguard policies. \n \nTable A12.2: Irrigation Subproject Initial Selection Criteria \nItem  Criteria/Indicator  Yes  No \n1  Will the proposed subproject have a significant negative effect on other     \nestablished water or land users in the watershed?    \n2  Is the proposed subproject clear of encroachment or negative impacts     \nupon existing or proposed protected areas (parks, reserves), historical, \ncultural, or religious sites? \n3  Is the proposed subproject clear of encroachment or negative impacts     \nupon any and all existing biodiversity sites and/or endangered species of \nflora and fauna? \n4  Is the proposed subproject free from any significant negative effects to     \nsurface water hydrology and/or natural drainage in the area? \n5  Will the proposed subproject be free from any other significant negative     \nenvironmental effects such as river basin degradation, increased silt loads, \nwater pollution, etc.? \n     Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n ", "  Appendix 12  57\nC.  Description of the Environment \n6.  Primary  data  was  collected  by  personal  observation  of  the  river,  intakes,  canals,  and \nstructures and of the areas surrounding the subproject area. Observations in the field were made \nwith international consultants, national consultants, and Government officials in order that a range of \nopinions could be obtained. Primary data was also collected from reports and field work of other TA \nconsultants. Secondary data was obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations library in Kabul, which serves as the library for MEW. Secondary data was also obtained \nfrom aid agency reports, nongovernment organization (NGO) reports, and the internet. Anecdotal \ndata was provided through consultations and interviews with farmers, Government officials, NGO \nstaff, and stakeholders. \n \n7.  The lower Hari Rud River Basin surrounding the subproject area is relatively barren with little \nvegetation outside the subproject area. Although it has low rainfall, erosion exists in some areas \nbecause the hillsides are almost bare of vegetation and the numerous washes (intermittent, flash \nflood,  streams)  erode  the  hillsides.  High  population  growth  combined  with  high  poverty  is \naccelerating soil erosion, biodiversity loss, water pollution, and dust storms. The fuel crisis in the \nsubproject area has resulted in people not only cutting trees and shrubs but in digging out the root \nsystems so that there is no regrowth. The subproject area has been farmed for over 300 years.  \n \n8.  Except for summer sand and dust storms, the air quality is good. The climate is arid, with \ncold winters and hot, dry summers. The average rainfall at Herat is estimated to be about 310 \nmillimeters. The main source of surface and groundwater in the basin is snow melt, which is spread \nover about 2 months (February/March\u2013April). The flow in the Hari Rud and Murghab rivers is \nsufficient to sustain irrigation from February through mid-June and sometimes into later months in a \ngood precipitation year.  \n \n9.  Elevations within the subproject area average about 1,000 meters mean sea level with \nrelatively even relief after being irrigated for over 300 years. The subproject\u2019s landform is primarily \nriver valley where the soils are deep silt loams and fine sandy loams underlain by conglomerate or \ngravel. In depressions or in areas where drainage is impeded and a high water table occurs, salinity \nproblems may occur but none were observed. Soils are low in available phosphate, nitrogen, and \norganic matter. The subproject area is geologically and seismologically stable. \n \n10.  Biodiversity is very limited after years of conflict and severe drought, with few visible species. \nWithin the Jui Nau irrigation system, trees growing around homes and along the canals and rivers, \nprovide scattered vegetation clumps supporting some habitat for wildlife. More trees will be planted \nas wind breaks to minimize sand and dust storms.   \n \n11.  No mineral development or tourism facilities are within the subproject area. Outside of Herat, \nthere is no electricity grid. Health services are sparse, with a doctor to people ratio of 1/6,637 in \nHerat. The subproject area has no protected areas, or cultural or historical sites. All parts of the Jui \nNau system are away from the historic city of Herat. Recently, urban expansion has encroached on \nsome of the lower reaches of the main canal. Some ruins of water cisterns and bathhouses are \nabout 150 to 300 meters south of this portion of the main canal. These ruins are not within the \nsubproject area. However, to ensure that no buried ruins are within the construction zone, the \nproject design requires that prior to construction an archeological reconnaissance be made. All \npotential environmental impacts are positive. Mobility for people and animals will be improved in the \nsubproject through the improvement of bridges.  \n \n ", "58  Appendix 12 \nD.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n12.  The methodology for screening subproject activities by implementation activity was done in \nconsultation with the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) professionals. Potential \nimpacts were initially assessed using the checklist provided for irrigation projects in the ADB \nEnvironmental Guidelines for Selected Agricultural and Natural Resources Development Projects \n(Supplementary Appendix D). While conducting the public consultations, the NEPA professionals \nreviewed project activities and visited the project areas (except Obe because of security concerns). \nThey used the rapid environmental assessment checklist to evaluate the subproject. They found no \nsignificant impacts. The project strategy of rehabilitating and expanding existing systems to improve \nthe  reliability  of  diversions  and  efficiency  of  water  use,  combined  with  groundwater  resource \nevaluation and use, and institutional development is expected to result in positive environmental \nimpacts. \n \n13.  Potential  Environmental  Concerns  from  Project  Location.  Possible  concerns  from \nproject location include water-use conflicts and quality deterioration in areas of water scarcity, \nparticularly in the dry season. However, an analysis of groundwater recharge and of its return to the \nriver that will result from the increase in water diverted indicates that the gross volume of water \navailable downriver of Jui Nau through groundwater seepage into the river will increase by about \n44%, thus reducing water scarcity and conflicts. Groundwater activities will be monitored by the \nenvironmental monitoring unit. Unexploded ordnance and land mines are concerns throughout \nAfghanistan, yet in the case of the Jui Nau, these do not appear to pose threats.4 No negative \nimpacts are related to the location.  \n \n14.  Potential Environmental Concerns from Project Design. Design considerations relate to \nensuring that structures are designed for ease of farmer operation. This has been ensured with \nappropriate  design  standards.  Ease  of  use  will  be  monitored  by  the  Project\u2019s  environmental \nmonitoring unit and MEW. Thus no negative impacts are due to project design.  \n \n15.  Potential  Environmental  Concerns  from  Project  Construction.  Temporary  negative \nimpacts are related to noise, dust, silt, and temporary interference with irrigation. This latter concern \nwill be mitigated by scheduling construction in the off-season. When closing a canal is necessary, \nfarmers  have  agreed  to  dig  temporary  canals.  All  construction  contracts  will  require  qualified \npersonnel  and  proper  equipment,  and  organization  to  ensure  the  implementation  of  good \nengineering practices and the use environment-friendly products. Thus no long term negative \nimpacts are due to project construction. \n \n16.  Potential Environmental Concerns from Project Operations. Water and soil quality may \nbe affected as a result of using more agrichemicals in selected subprojects. The potential negative \neffects will be ameliorated by extension and awareness services provided by the Project and the \nMinistry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Food. Given that each subproject is small and \nconfined to existing agricultural lands, cumulative impacts will be small. The Project is not anticpated \nto result in any major downstream impacts. \n \n                                                 \n4  In areas where unexploded ordnance or mines are perceived to cause a threat, the Government will be responsible \nfor securing the area before any project activities can take place. \n ", "  Appendix 12  59\nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan  \n17.  Methodology.  All  relevant  laws,  regulations,  and  pending  legislation  will  need  to  be \nreviewed. During this review, consultations and interviews with relevant Government agencies, \ninternational organizations, NGOs, and individuals will be held to obtain a range of ideas and to \nobtain additional source material. After the legislative, regulatory, and source material review is \ncomplete, a second set of meetings should be held to discuss the knowledge gained. \n \n18.  Based on the IEEs, stakeholder consultation, and the ADB and NEPA guidelines and \nrequirements, a project-specific set of environmental assessment and review procedures were \nprepared. An environmental management plan (EMP) was prepared to ensure that the Project has \nno future significant negative environmental problems. The plan is an intrinsic part of all project \ncomponents. Initially, the EMP will focus on monitoring water quantity, soil and water quality, \nconstruction activities, and biodiversity as a function of land cover. As implementation proceeds the \nEMP will be refined, based on public consultations, ongoing data collection, and the monitoring of \ndesigns and construction activities. Satellite imagery will be used to monitor land use and hillside \nerosion. The EMP will also provide training. In the case of the Jui Nau subproject about $10,470 is \nprovided for environmental management to cover the costs of IEE and planning activities 31.2%, \nmitigation management and training 14.9%, consultants 27.5%, and equipment 26.4%. (a draft EMP \nis presented with the IEE in Supplementary Appendix D, and environmental assessment and review \nprocedures are included in Supplementary Appendix E). \n \n19.  Initially soil and water samples will be taken at larger than 2,000 ha subproject intakes and \nat no less than one canal tail within the system. The sampling network will be refined as knowledge \nis gained about the spatial variation of environmental variables. Environmental activities will be \ndescribed in project reports and specific reports will be prepared for sampling results and training \nactivities. IEs and a summary IEE will be reported. The Project will have an ongoing series of new \nsubprojects, MEW officials supported by project staff will prepare an IEE for each. To assist these \nlocal officials and staff to prepare the IEEs and to undertake the EMP, the Project will field an \nenvironment specialist for 12 person-months over the first 4 years of the Project. The specialist will \nbe  responsible  for  building  local  capacity,  working  with  Herat  officials  and  staff  to  design \nenvironmental studies and the M&E program, use and refining subproject environmental screening \ncriteria; and conducting IEEs for proposed subprojects. \n \n20.  Environmental monitoring is integrated into the project monitoring and evaluation program \nand will be put into effect by the project environmental unit staff with consultant support. The Project \nhas over $400,000 to support environmental activities and ensure monitoring and any mitigation is \nadequate. Monitoring is necessary to ensure that (i) the quality of water resources is not degraded, \nand (ii) the quantity of water available to tail end users within systems and to down river users \nbetween systems is not decreased. Resource requirements and costs include the provision for \nNEPA and for local staff to prepare IEE\u2019s in project years 4 through 7. \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n21.  Stakeholder consultations were conducted individually and jointly by the TA team members \nincluding  the  on-farm  irrigation  engineer,  irrigation  engineer,  gender  specialist,  watershed \nmanagement specialist, and social specialist and were held at subproject, district, and national \nlevels. After the completion of the draft final report and its presentation in Kabul, a final series of on-\nsite subproject public consultations were conducted by the project environmental specialist and the \ntwo NEPA officials. Stakeholders were notified 1 week in advance with written invitations sent to \nrelevant  NGOs.  These  consultations  were  held  at  the  district  headquarters  of Injil  District  for \n ", "60  Appendix 12 \nstakeholders from the Jui Nau on 26 June 2005. The proceedings of the consultation in Injil for the \nJui Nau were videotaped and televised on Herat television\u2019s evening news. This informed a larger \naudience about proposed project activities. \n \n22.  The  issues  raised  were  the  (i)  project  objectives;  (ii)  types  of  rehabilitation  for  each \nsubproject and the associated extension activities; (iii) potential environmental impacts, especially \nthose related to downstream water use and historic structures; (iv) proposed strengthening of the \nmirab system; and (v) proposed mitigation measures. The attending stakeholders were asked for \ntheir views and opinions. They raised no additional environmental considerations and indicated that \nthey did not consider the environmental issues discussed to be problems. They were unanimous in \nfavoring the interventions. Information on the number and categories of stakeholders present are \npresented  in  the  IEE  (Supplementary  Appendix  D).  Project  staff  will  undertake  future  public \nconsultations and disclosures. These will describe and discuss project components and activities, \nincluding the potential to improve soil and water conditions in the project areas. The first formal \nconsultations are to take place before the design phase. \n \nG.  Conclusions \n23.  The IEEs find that the Project provides for environment-friendly irrigation interventions \nand contributes to improving living conditions. The findings of this IEE are that a follow-up \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  or  further  detailed  environmental  impact  study  is  not \nrequired. The identified potential adverse effects will be addressed through proper site location, \nplanning,  design,  implementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance,  while  incorporating \nmitigation measures. The screening of future subprojects will be done in accordance with NEPA \nregulations  and  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures.  Monitoring  will  be \ncarried out throughout the subproject life to ensure that the guidelines are adhered to and that \nadequate capacity development is provided for all stakeholders. Although an environmental \nimpact assessment is not necessary, the fielding of an environmental specialist is required to \nprovide support to the project environmental monitoring unit, assist with the environmental \nscreening of future subprojects and the preparation of the required IEEs, and train communities \nin the early detection of environmental degradation. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20051223150124+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20051129195933+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R352-05cover.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "RSA", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 24 November 2005) \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  Afghanistan Afghani (AF) \n \nAF1.00 =  $ 0.0234 \n$1.00 =  AF42.79   \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB   \u2013  Asian Development Bank  \n  ADF  \u2013  Asian Development Fund \n  BWC  \u2013  basin water committee \n  EIRR  \u2013  economic internal rate of return  \n  EMP  \u2013  environmental management plan \n  ICB   \u2013  international competitive bidding  \n  IEE   \u2013  initial environmental examination  \n  ISA  \u2013  initial social assessment \n  IWRM   \u2013  integrated water resource management \n  LCB   \u2013  local competitive bidding  \n  M&E   \u2013  monitoring and evaluation  \n  MAAHF  \u2013  Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Food \n  MEW    \u2013  Ministry of Energy and Water \n  MMI   \u2013  Ministry of Mines and Industry  \n  MOF  \u2013  Ministry of Finance \n  MRRD  \u2013  Ministry of Rural Reconstruction and Development \n  NEPA  \u2013  National Environmental Protection Agency \n  NGO  \u2013  nongovernment organization  \n  O&M   \u2013  operation and maintenance  \n  OFWM  \u2013  on-farm water management \n  PIC  \u2013  project implementation committee \n  PMU  \u2013  project management unit \n  PSC  \u2013  project steering committee \n  R&U   \u2013  rehabilitation and upgrading \n  RBA   \u2013  river basin authority \n  TA   \u2013  technical assistance  \n  UNDP  \u2013  United Nations Development Programme \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year of the Government ends on 31 March. \n(ii)   In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \nVice President  L.
