The  project  will  include  a  component  to  build  the  institutional  capacity  of  the \nexecuting agency to ensure the sustainability of the project.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nBangladesh is a riverine country, and the major rivers flowing through it are the Ganges, \nJamuna,  Meghna,  and  Padma.  Historically,  this  river  system  has  split  Bangladesh  into  (i)  the \nnorthwest zone, bordered by the Ganges and Jamuna rivers; (ii) the east zone, which is east of \nthe Jamuna River, where the capital, Dhaka, and the major port, Chittagong, are situated; and \n(iii) the southwest zone, isolated by the Padma and Ganges rivers. The Padma River is formed \nby  the  confluence  of  the  Ganges  and  the  Jamuna  rivers.  The  river,  about  5  km  wide  with \nbraided, turbulent, and shifting flows, has been a major transport barrier between the southwest \nzone  and  the  northwest  and  east  zones.  At  present,  passengers  and  freight  are  transported \nacross the river by ferry and, to a lesser extent, by launches and rowboats. Their services are \ngrossly  inadequate  in  terms  of  both  capacity  and  service  level.  Existing  ferry  services  involve \nlong  and  unpredictable  waits  at  terminals  lacking  basic  amenities.  Flooding,  fog,  and  other \ndifficult weather conditions routinely cause services to be suspended or cancelled. \n \n4. \n The  completion  of  the  Jamuna  bridge  in  June  1998  improved  the  connectivity  of  the \nnorthwest  zone  to  the  economically  important  east  zone,  thus  accelerating  the  former\u2019s \nsocioeconomic development and alleviating poverty in the country as a whole.1 Similar impacts \nare expected with the opening of the proposed Padma bridge. The bridge is expected to have \nsubregional impacts by forming part of the Asian Highway Route A-1, the main Asian Highway \nroute connecting Asia to Europe. \n \n5. \nThe pre-feasibility study conducted with government financing in 1999\u20132000 established \nthe  technical  and  economic  viability  of  a  bridge  across  the  Padma  River. 2   A  more \nInternational \ncomprehensive \nCooperation Agency (JICA) reaffirmed the technical and economic viability of building the bridge \nat the Mawa\u2013Janjira crossing.3 During the feasibility study, the government requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and World Bank to extend \ntheir  support  for  constructing  the  bridge  through  a  cofinancing  arrangement  similar  to  that \nadopted for the Jamuna bridge.4 The development partners came to an understanding that (i) \nthe  project  is  too  large  to  be  financed  by  a  single  aid  agency,  (ii) the  exemplary  development \n\nfeasibility  study  undertaken \n\nin  2001\u20132005  by \n\nthe  Japan \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003.

ADB.  1994.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of \nDirectors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Jamuna  Bridge  Project.  Manila  (Loan \n1298-BAN). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\npartner  coordination  and  cooperation  achieved  for  constructing  the  Jamuna  bridge  should  be \nreplicated  for  the  Padma  bridge,  and  (iii)  subsequent  project  preparation  would  be  carried  out \njointly.  \n \nIn  2005,  ADB  provided  technical  assistance  (TA) 5   to  complement  JICA\u2019s  feasibility \n6. \nstudy, which confirmed the technical and economic viability of the Padma bridge. The TA aimed \nas well to develop a public\u2013private partnership (PPP) for the project, which would have required \nseveral preparatory measures and conditions such as (i) creating an enabling environment for \nwhat is a new concept in Bangladesh through a comprehensive fiscal, financial, and legal policy \nframework,  (ii) building  capacity  in  the  executing  agency;  and  (iii)  implementing  a  vast  public \ncommunication  plan.  The  TA  therefore  did  not  recommend  pursuing  PPP.  However,  it  is \nenvisaged that the operation and maintenance of the bridge will involve the private sector.  \n \nADB processed a TA loan of $17.6 million in 20076 to finance (i) consultants to prepare \n7. \ndetailed  design  and  help  the  Bangladesh  Bridge  Authority  (BBA)  with  tendering,  (ii)  an \nengineering  review  to  confirm  the  selected  deliverables  of  the  design  consultants,  and  (iii)  a \npanel  of  reputed  international  and  national  experts  to  provide  advisory  services  to  BBA.  The \nWorld Bank is assisting, under a $3 million project preparatory facility, with (i) an independent \nreview  of  social  and  environmental  safeguard  documents,  (ii) financial  due  diligence,  (iii)  the \nstrengthening of BBA, and (iv) additional financing for the panel of experts. \n\n8. \nThe  government  accords  very  high  priority  to  the  project,  which  is  included  in  ADB's \n2010\u20132012  country  operations  business  plan  for  Bangladesh  as  a  firm  loan  for  2010 \nprocessing. 7   Since  mobilizing  the  design  consultants,  ADB,  the  Islamic  Development  Bank, \nJICA,  and  the  World  Bank  have  fielded  joint  missions  to  deal  with  various  aspects  of  project \npreparation.  \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe  project  will  significantly  improve  the  country's  surface  transport  systems  and, \nbecause of its size, lift the nation's economy. Specifically, the project will accelerate economic \ngrowth in the southwest zone of Bangladesh. The direct outcome of the project will be improved \nsurface  transport  between  Dhaka  and  the  southwest  zone.  The  project\u2019s  institutional \nstrengthening component will ensure the sustainability of the project and other BBA investment \nprojects. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nThe key outputs will be (i) the first fixed crossing across the Padma River for road traffic \ncomprising  (a)  a  two-level  steel  truss  composite  bridge  6.15  km  long,  the  top  deck  to \naccommodate a four-lane highway and the lower deck to accommodate a single-track railway to \nbe added in the future; (b) 12.0 km of approach roads, 1.5 km on the Mawa side and 10.5 km on \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2005.

The  loan  will  have  a  27-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  7  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.9 The government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its \nown independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \nThe  government  has  requested  an  additional  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \n13. \nSDR 48,206,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will \nhave  a  32-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum \nduring  the  grace  period and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions \nset forth in the draft loan and project agreements (footnote 9).  \n                                                 \n8   Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9   Loan Agreements; Project Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fADB loans will be used to finance part of the cost of the civil works, financing charges \n14. \nduring the implementation of the ADB loans, and local taxes and duties estimated at $80 million \non ADB-financed expenditures. The taxes and duties are estimated to amount to 19.5% of the \ntotal  project  cost,  which  is  not  excessive  considering  the  high  share  of  imported  materials  for \nbridge  works.  The  government  will  finance  a  large  share  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \ncosts in addition to its share of civil works. ADB\u2019s financing of taxes and duties will be material \nto the success of the project. No taxes or duties in Bangladesh are considered unreasonable or \ndiscriminatory. \n \n15. \nThree  cofinanciers  will  provide  a  total  of  $1,640  million  through  parallel  cofinancing \n(Table  2).

For  this  to  happen,  a  waiver  from \nADB\u2019s country and source eligibility provision is necessary, and is being sought for this project. \nIn the absence of a waiver on country and source eligibility, implementation of the project as a \njoint  project  will  not  be  possible.  In  addition,  considering  the  joint  nature  of  the  financing  and \nsignificant  fiduciary  and  reputation  risks  involved,  firms  and  entities  sanctioned  by  any  of  the \ncofinanciers will be debarred from participating in contracts which are jointly financed by them.   \n \nFor effective coordination, ADB is developing, in consultation with other cofinanciers, a \n21. \nmemorandum  of  understanding  to  lay  out  the  basic  principles  and  procedural  aspects  of \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fcollaboration.10 The memorandum of understanding will be signed as quickly as possible, but in \nany event, by no later than the issue of any final bidding documents in respect of any contract to \nbe cofinanced by ADB under the project. \n\n \n\nIII.  \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical  \n\nA. \n \nThe ADB TA loan and its supplementary loan provide sufficient resources to conduct the \n22. \nnecessary surveys, tests, and studies (footnote 6). The panel of experts has met frequently to \ndiscuss design deliverables. Checking engineers are conducting further technical due diligence \nof the detailed engineering design. The detailed design has been informed by the country's past \nexperience  in  constructing  bridges  across  its  major  rivers  and  other  recent  projects  of  similar \nsize  and  nature  executed  elsewhere.  Climate  change  impacts  affecting  the  water  level, \ntemperature  regime,  rainfall,  river  discharge,  and  wind  speed  have  been  considered  in  the \ndesign parameters.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\n23. \nEstimates  of  the  benefits  accruing  to  road  users,  using  the  conventional  approach  of \nestimating  savings  in  vehicle  operating  and  travel  time  costs,  found  the  project  economically \nviable,  with  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  15%\u201320%  under  different  benefit  and  cost \nassumptions. 11   To  supplement  this  analysis,  a  comprehensive  impact  analysis  has  been \nconducted  using  social  accounting  matrix  and  computable  general  equilibrium  models.  The \nmain  results  from  the  models  indicate  that  rates  of  poverty  reduction  will  be  higher  than \nhistorical trends over the past 2 decades and yield an economic internal rate of return of 21%, in \nline with the results of the conventional approach. These models will be updated during project \nimplementation to estimate project impact and for ex-post evaluation of project impacts on the \nregion and the national economy.   \n\n24. \nFinancial  analysis  was  carried  out  to  identify  the  cash-flow  requirement  for  sustainably \nfinancing  the  project.  The  result  suggests  that  toll  rates  for  the  Padma  bridge  need  to  be \nsubstantially  higher  than  current  toll  rates  for  the  Jamuna  Bridge.  Considering  a  gradual \nincrease  of  toll  rates  to  reach  the  required  level,  as  agreed  by  the  government,  the  financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at  7.9%  for  the  base  case  and  at  6.5%  for  a  more \nconservative  traffic  scenario.  Although  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  may  appear  low,  it \ncaptures  only  a  minority  of  financial  flows  and  benefits  that  the  project  will  generate  in  the \nsouthwest  zone.  The  low  financial  internal  rate  of  return  demonstrates  the  necessity  of  public \nintervention and the inappropriateness of a PPP approach.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nBBA  needs  to  increase  its  staff  numbers  and  enhance  its  capacity  significantly  to \nmanage  the  project  and  then  properly  maintain  the  asset  created.  During  project  preparation, \n\n                                                 \n10  A  memorandum  of  understanding  with  similar  scope  was  entered  into  by  ADB,  the  Overseas  Economic \n\nCooperation Fund of Japan, and the World Bank for implementing the Jamuna Bridge Project. \n\n11  Although  the  Padma  bridge  is  designed  to  accommodate  a  railway  in  the  future,  and  the  benefits  of  a  railway \nconnection  across  the  river  will  be  significant,  the  economic  analysis  does  not  take  them  into  account.  This  is \nmainly because (i) the timing and cost of completing the  railway connection across the bridge is not immediately \navailable,  (ii)  the  increased  cost  of  accommodating  the  railway  is  marginal,  and  (iii)  excluding  potential  railway \nbenefits results in a suitably conservative estimate.   \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\nBBA  gradually  added  senior  staff,  mostly  through  deputation  from  other  government \norganizations. With the assistance of the World Bank, BBA developed a capacity development \naction  plan  on  the  basis  of  which  it  has  started  recruiting  staff  with  expertise  in  resettlement, \nenvironmental management, and financial management. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and BBA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual (footnote 8). \n \n27.  Measures to enhance governance and minimize procurement-related risks include (i) the \noversight  of  the  project  by  the  panel  of  experts  and  the  cofinanciers  monitoring  committee \n(CMC),  (ii)  assistance  from  the  design  consultants  in  civil  works  procurement,  (iii)  assistance \nfrom  experienced  procurement  consultants in consultant selection,  (iv)  a  project  website  to  be \nmaintained  by  BBA  to  disclose  information  including  on  procurement,  and  (v)  a  system  of \nhandling  complaints  related  to  project  implementation.  Further,  the  project  management  unit \nshall,  within  9  months  of  project  effectiveness,  prepare  a  grievance  redress  mechanism \nacceptable  to  ADB.  An  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB  will  annually  audit  all  project-\nrelated  accounts  and  revenues.  All  audit  reports  and  certified  financial  statements  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB within 6 months of the close of the year under audit. \n \nD. \n \n28. \nPoverty  reduction.  The  southwest  zone  has  one  of  the  highest  poverty  rates  in \nBangladesh,  according  to  the  household  income  and  expenditure  survey  conducted  in  2005. \nWhile  42%  of  the  population  of  the  whole  country  lived  below  the  absolute  poverty  line,  the \nsouthwest  zone  had  a  poverty  incidence  of  52%  in  Barishal  Division  and  46%  in  Khulna \nDivision.  During  construction,  local  unemployed  people  will  gain  employment,  and  increased \ncommercial activity will generate income. The country will be physically integrated through the \nfixed link, reducing economic disparity and deprivation. An estimate of multiplier effects on the \nproject investment shows the bridge increasing the gross domestic product growth rate by 1.2% \nand the regional growth rate in the southwest zone by 3.5%, generating 743,000 person-years \nof  additional  employment,  and  thereby  contributing  1.2%  of  the  total  labor  market  of \nBangladesh.  Over  the  long  term,  the  bridge\u2019s  impact  on  poverty  reduction  will  be  more \nsignificant,  as  the  share  of  economic  benefits  generated  by  the  bridge  that  will  accrue  to  the \npoor is larger than the share of the gross domestic product that goes to the poor.12  \n \nConsultation  and  participation. Public consultation began in the project area in 1999 \n29. \nas part of the first pre-feasibility study and continued throughout project preparation. Surveyed \nhouseholds  perceive  the  socioeconomic  benefits  of  the  project  as  (i)  improved  access  to \nsocioeconomic  services,  (ii)  increased  employment  opportunities,  and  (iii)  improved  transport \nservices that will reduce poverty in the region.  A public consultation and participation plan has \nbeen  developed  for  project  implementation  to  ensure  that  adequate  and  timely  information  is \nmade available to the affected people.  \n \nGender,  HIV/AIDS,  and  public  health.  The participation of both women and men was \n30. \nensured during the social study by undertaking gender analysis. Focus group discussions were \nundertaken with women and men belonging to different socioeconomic groups. The project will \nphysically displace 283 households headed by women. A gender action plan and public health \naction  plan  have  been  developed  for  the  following:  (i) entitlements  for  losses  suffered  by \n\n                                                 \n12  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nSafeguards \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement  and \n\nindigenous  peoples.  The  project \n\nwomen;  (ii)  livelihood  reconstruction  and  income  restoration  programs;  (iii)  the  employment  of \nunskilled  and  semi-skilled  laborers  in  civil  works  construction;  (iv) the  management  of  health \nand  sexually  transmitted  infections  to  address  public  health,  HIV/AIDS,  and  human  trafficking \nissues; (v) gender-equitable processes of consultation and information dissemination in relation \nto resettlement and rehabilitation; and (vi) gender-inclusive mechanisms to redress grievances. \n \n31. \nChars.  Hydraulic  studies  suggested  that  constructing  the  bridge  will  have  no  adverse \nimpacts  on  chars 13 upstream  and  downstream  from  the  bridge.  However,  in  extensive \nconsultation  with  char-dwelling  communities,  a  char  monitoring  and  management  framework \nwas developed to monitor any unanticipated impacts during and after construction and develop \nmitigation  plans  if  impacts  are  confirmed.  BBA  is  firmly  committed  to  providing  resources  for \nchar monitoring, protection, and development. \n \nE. \n \n32. \nis  classified \ninvoluntary  resettlement  category  A  and  indigenous  peoples  category  C  in  accordance  with \nADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  A  100%  census  based  on  the  detailed  design \nidentified 13,578 households that will suffer impacts on livelihoods and assets such as income \nfrom day labor, agricultural land, residential and commercial assets, and trees. Of this number, \n3,886  will  be  physically  displaced  and  9,692  will  be  economically  displaced.  A  resettlement \nframework 14  and  three  separate  resettlement  action  plans 15   have  been  prepared  based  on \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  other  cofinanciers'  safeguard  polices  to  address  all \nlosses.  The  complete  details  of  compensation  rates  for  the  loss  of  assets,  development  of \nresettlement sites, shifting and transitional assistance, and other income-restoration assistance, \nincluding  additional  support  for  vulnerable  groups,  are  in  the  entitlement  matrixes  of  the \nresettlement  action  plans.  Four  resettlement  sites  are  being  developed  for  displaced \nhouseholds. BBA will provide sufficient funds for the timely implementation of resettlement and \nsocial action plans. No impact on indigenous people is envisaged.  \n \n33. \nEnvironment.  Considering  that  this  is  a  large  project  involving  significant  changes  in \nland  use  and  impacts  on  wildlife,  the  project  has  been  classified  environmental  category  A  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  To  investigate  the  various \nenvironmental  impacts  in  the  project  area,  studies  have  included  an  (i)  initial  environmental \nexamination  of \n(including \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan [EMMP]),16 (iii) environmental quality baseline \nmonitoring survey, and (iv) ecological report. Further, climate change has been factored into the \ndesign of the project. The reports have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of \nADB,  JICA,  and  the  World  Bank.  To  ensure  proper  environmental  impact  monitoring,  the \nbaseline  data  provided  in  the  environmental  impact  assessment  report  will  be  further  verified \nand updated before the start of project implementation.  \n \n34. \nThe EMMP and environmental codes of practice for 19 environmental issues have been \ndeveloped  to  help  minimize  environmental  impacts.  These  cover  managing  waste  and \nhazardous materials, controlling erosion and sedimentation, and protecting fauna through such \nmeasures as timing and locating construction to avoid disturbing the migration and breeding of \n\nimpact  assessment \n\nresettlement  sites, \n\n(ii)  environmental \n\n                                                 \n13 Land located in an active river basin that is subject to erosion and accretion. \n14 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Resettlement Action Plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fRisks \nPoor design and \nengineering works \n\nGovernment lacking \ncapacity to manage \na large investment \n\nPoor coordination \nof development \npartners \n\nPoor governance of \nprocurement and \nfinancial \nmanagement \n\nDelay in project \nstart \n\nhilsa  fish.  Contractors  will  prepare  further  detailed  construction  environmental  action  plans \n(CEAPs) based on the EMMP and environmental codes of practice. The CEAPs will be contract \ndocuments used for monitoring by the construction supervision consultant and an independent \nexternal monitor. Quarterly and annual progress reports on the implementation of CEAPs will be \nsubmitted  to  ADB.  The  EMMP  will  be  revised  by  the  construction  supervision  consultant  and \ncontractors to reflect any changes in project components. Adequate budget provision has been \nmade for implementing CEAPs and EMMP.  \n  \nF. \n \n35.
