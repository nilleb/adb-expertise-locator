The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Capacity Development for School Sector Program Implementation, \nand if the Board approves the proposed grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, will approve the TA.1  \n \nThe program is a follow-on to the ongoing Education Sector Program, subprogram III,2 \n2. \nwhich  supports  the  Government  of  Nepal's  7-year  (FY2010\u2013FY2016)  School  Sector  Reform \nProgram  (SSRP).  The  SSRP  is  supported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  eight \nother  development  partners3  using  the  sector-wide  approach  (SWAp).  Building  on  the \nachievements  of  the  Education  for  All  Program  (2004\u20132009),  the  SSRP  aims  to  (i)  expand \naccess  and  equity,  (ii)  improve  quality  and  relevance,  and  (iii)  strengthen  the  institutional \ncapacity of the entire school education system. The Education Sector Program, subprogram III \nsupported the first 3 years of SSRP implementation, and this program will continue to support it \nlong-term  economic  and  social \nIt  will  contribute \nduring  FY2012\u2013FY2014. \ndevelopment through an equitable, efficient, and relevant education system. \n \n\nto  Nepal\u2019s \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nNepal is undergoing major change, mainly emanating from deep political changes over \nthe past two decades. This, in turn, is significantly impacting social transformation\u2014the clearest \nmanifestation of which is evident in the education sector, with rapid progress in participation and \ngender parity in school education. The sector may be characterized as having high demand, but \ninvestments have a long gestation period. The SSRP and this program must be viewed in this \ncontext. When the SSRP was designed (in the aftermath of the decade-long conflict), there was \na  high  level  of  optimism.  But  the  protracted  peace  and  constitutional  drafting  process  and \nfrequent changes in government have made full implementation of the SSRP challenging.  \n  \n4. \nImproving  equitable  access  to  quality  education  is  accorded  the  highest  priority  on \nNepal\u2019s  development  agenda.  Despite  the  challenging  environment,  successive  governments \nhave shown a strong commitment to implementing the SSRP, which is reflected in the periodic \ndevelopment plans as well as government spending for education. In the first 2 years of SSRP \nimplementation,  substantial  progress  has  been  made \nin  creating  an  enabling  policy \nenvironment.  The  government  has  approved  policies  for  free  basic  education,  minimum \nenabling  conditions  (MECs)  for  student  learning,  curriculum  reforms,  teacher  minimum \nqualification upgrading and equitable deployment, and capacity development at the district and \nschool  levels.  The  new  basic  education  cycle  (grades 1\u20138)  is  in place  and  piloting  of  the  new \nsecondary education cycle (grades 9-12) has been initiated in five districts. \n \n5. \nImpressive  progress  has  been  made  in  sector  performance,  particularly  in  access  to \neducation. Currently, about 95% of children have access to a primary school within 30 minutes\u2019 \n\n                                                      \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n\n3  The pooling partners include Australia, Denmark, the European Union, Finland, Norway, the United Kingdom, the \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund, and the World Bank including funds from the Fast Track Initiative. In addition, a \nnumber of non-pooling agencies support the SSRP. \n\n\f2 \n\nin  access  has  underscored \n\nwalking distance. In 2010, (i) the net enrollment rate (NER) in primary education reached 95%, \nand  Nepal  is  on  track  to  meet  Millennium  Development  Goal  2  (achieving  universal  primary \neducation by 2015); (ii) the NER  in basic education reached 86% and in secondary education \n27%; (iii) the share of grade 1 entrants with early childhood education and development (ECED) \nexperience  was  52%;  (iv)  the  percentage  of  fully  trained  teachers  was  77%  at  the  basic  and \n74%  at  the  secondary  levels;  and  (v)  literacy  programs  benefited  2.8  million  participants  in \n2008\u20132010.  Good  progress  was  also  evident  in  gender  equity  and  social  inclusion  (GESI):  (i) \nthe gender parity index in NER reached 0.98 at all levels of primary and secondary education; \n(ii) the literacy rate of the 15+ age group reached 60% and its gender parity index 0.92; and (iii) \nshares of (a) Dalit (so-called untouchable caste) students (as a percentage of total enrollment) \nreached  18%  in  ECED,  20%  in  basic  and  9%  in  secondary  education;  and  (b)  Janajati \n(indigenous  peoples)  students  39%  in  ECED,  39%  in  basic  and  38%  in  secondary  education, \nboth roughly in line with their share in the general population.4 \n \n6. \nThe  progress  in  school  education  demonstrates  the  resilience  built  up  through \nincremental  but  critical  reforms.  This  resilience  stems  mainly  from  the  decentralized  school \nsystem,  which  is  a  unique  feature  and  strength  of  the  education  system  in  Nepal.  However, \nrapid  expansion \nthe  urgency  of  ensuring  commensurate \nimprovements  in  quality,  efficiency,  and  institutional  capacity  to  manage  an  expanded  and \ninclusive  school  system.  In  particular,  the  school  sector  faces  continuing  challenges  in:  (i) \nproviding  quality  basic  education  to  hard-to-reach  children  from  disadvantaged  groups  and \nareas;  (ii)  ensuring  a  high  quality  of  education;  (iii)  creating  an  enabling  and  safe  school \nenvironment; (iv) implementing an effective teacher management and professional development \nsystem;  and  (v)  strengthening  procurement,  financial  management,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation (M&E) capacity. \n \n7. \nThe  lessons  from  the  Education  Sector  Program,  and  noted  in  2009  ADB  country \nassistance performance evaluation,5 indicate that (i) difficult reforms are feasible even during a \nfragile  political  transition,  through  sustained  support  to  the  decentralized  school  system  with \nschool-level  management  capacity  development;  (ii)  a  mature  SWAp  demonstrates  that \nsustained  support  to  country  systems  enhances  overall  capacity  of  the  government,  including \nstronger  program  leadership  and  ownership;  (iii)  enhancing  quality  and  efficiency  in  a  rapidly \nexpanding  system  requires  improvements  in  M&E  and  data  quality  to  produce  the  desired \nresults; (iv) equitable improvements in student learning outcomes, particularly for disadvantaged \nchildren, require an integrated system-wide approach to GESI and investments in implementing \nMECs; and (v) the capacity of relevant central and local bodies must be enhanced to strengthen \ninternal control mechanisms to improve transparency and mitigate fiduciary risks. \n \n8. \nThe program will build on these achievements and lessons by sharpening the focus on \nimplementation  of  key  policy  reforms,  including:  (i)  customized  strategies  for  reaching  out-of-\nschool  children;  (ii)  enhancing  student  learning  through  meeting  the  MECs  and  assessment \nreforms;  (iii)  improving  the  safety  of  school  buildings;  (iv)  strengthening  the  teaching  force \nthrough  better  management,  qualification  upgrading,  and  increasing  representation  of  women \nand  excluded  social  groups;  and  (v)  strengthening  institutional  capacity  for  effective  M&E, \nfinancial management, internal control and compliance, safeguards, and GESI implementation. \n                                                      \n4  Further information on sector performance is in Sector Assessment (Summary): Education (accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5   ADB. 2009. Country Assistance Program Evaluation: Nepal\u2014Delivering Assistance in a Challenging Environment. \nManila.  Further  information  on  lessons  from  ADB  engagement  in  Nepal\u2019s  education  sector  is  available  at: \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/PPARs/NEP/ppa-nep-18011.pdf \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nThe  program  will  also  make  necessary  adjustments,  including:  (i)  re-costing  and  revising  the \nSSRP  financial  plan  for  FY2012\u2013FY2014,  (ii)  assessing  the  fiduciary  risks  and  incorporating \nadditional mitigating measures, (iii) updating the gender and vulnerable communities action plan \n(GVCAP)6  for  coherent  implementation  throughout  the  entire  system,  and  (iv)  updating  the \nenvironmental management framework. \n \n9. \nThe  program  will  support  the  SSRP  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  set  forth  in  the \nJoint Financing Arrangement (JFA)7 mutually agreed upon by the government and development \npartners. To ensure SSRP implementation as envisaged, the program has developed a number \nof policy conditions with which the government must fully comply to receive the grant. In view of \nthe pooled funding, the government and development partners follow a common SSRP results \nframework  with  agreed  targets  and  performance  indicators  as  summarized  in  the  program \ndesign and monitoring framework  (Appendix  1).  Some  of  these targets  and  indicators  may  be \nrevised during the joint midterm review of SSRP in early 2012. \n \n10. \n\nThe program has four special features: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\nStronger focus on gender, social inclusion, and quality. The program will focus \non  equity  and  quality,  and  reinforce  efforts  to  extend  quality  education  to  girls  and \nchildren  from  vulnerable  communities  who  are  deprived  as  a  result  of  gender  and \nsocioeconomic  factors.  These  efforts  comprise  incentives  that  target  individuals \n(scholarships and incentives to needy students) and institutions (MECs to the most \ndisadvantaged basic education schools). \n\nStrengthened  institutional  capacity  and  fiduciary  risk  management.  The \ncapacity of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Department of Education (DOE) \nto  implement  the  program  effectively  is  critical  for  program  success,  and  requires \neffective  and  transparent  financial  management.  The  program  will  strengthen \ninstitutional  capacity  with  a  focus  on  program  management,  procurement,  financial \nmanagement, and reporting systems, thereby helping mitigate fiduciary risks. \n\nGreater focus on monitoring and evaluation. Good policy outcomes require policy \nmaking based on a robust understanding of what works and why. To achieve desired \nresults  and  address  governance  risks,  the  program  will  focus  on  establishing \nstronger  M&E  protocols.  Independent  validation  of  the  government\u2019s  education \nmanagement information system data will be undertaken, particularly in the areas of \nenrollments,  textbook  and  scholarship  distribution,  and  identification  of  schools  for \ntargeted support. This will enable evidence-based interventions for high quality and \ninclusive education. \n\nInnovative support for school safety. School buildings in Nepal are susceptible to \nmultiple hazards, such as earthquake, landslide, flood and storm, and those arising \nfrom  climate  change.  The  program  will  support  school  safety  as  an  essential \ncomponent of an enabling environment for student learning, a first for the education \nsector in Nepal. \n\n                                                      \n6  GVCAP is a detailed action plan with indicators and targets based on the Vulnerable Communities Development \n\nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7  Joint Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n\f4 \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe  impact  of  the  SSRP  will  be  enhanced  educational  attainment  and  livelihoods, \nparticularly  for  girls  and  disadvantaged  groups.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  access  to  and \nimproved  quality  of  school  education,  particularly  basic  education,  especially  for  girls  and \nchildren  from  disadvantaged  groups.  The  program  will  support  the  SSRP,  and  its  expected \nimpact and outcome will be consistent with the impact and outcome of the SSRP. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe  program  is  composed  of  five  crosscutting  outputs:  (i)  more  equitable  access  to \nquality  education,  (ii)  enhanced  student  learning,  (iii)  safer  schools,  (iv)  enhanced  teacher \nmanagement  and  development,  and  (v)  better  management  of  governance  risks  in  the \neducation sector. Social inclusion and quality are key objectives across the outputs. \n \n13. \nOutput 1: More equitable access to quality education. Despite substantial progress \nin  expanding  access  to  education,  there  are  gaps  in  reaching  the  remaining  out -of-school \nchildren  in  basic  education,  and  retaining  those  in  school.  The  program  will  support:  (i) \nidentification of out-of-school children and development of customized  interventions to bring \nthem  into  schools;  (ii)  scholarships  and  other  basic  and  secondary  education  incentives \nannually  for  more  than  3.8  million  girls  and  children  from  vulnerable  communities;  (iii) \nexpansion  of  ECED  provision  in  poverty  areas;  and  (iv)  construction  and  rehabilitation  of \nclassrooms and facilities in targeted schools to better serve disadvantaged students, especially \ngirls and students with disabilities. This output will help achieve the government\u2019s objective of a \nmore  inclusive  education  system.  Two  tranche  release  conditions  (TRCs)  are  included  to \nimplement strategic interventions to bring the out-of-school children to basic education schools. \n \n14. \nOutput 2: Enhanced student learning. The program will support quality improvement \nat the levels of inputs and processes. In terms of inputs, it will support government initiatives to: \n(i)  ensure  that  all  students  receive  the  full  set  of  textbooks  within  2  weeks  of  the  start  of  the \nacademic year, (ii) increase the percentage of new entrants in grade 1 with ECED experience, \nand  (iii)  implement  MECs  in  the  most  deprived  basic  education  schools.  The  program  has \nidentified five priority MECs: provision of adequate numbers of classrooms, separate toilets for \ngirls and boys, textbooks, learning materials and/or book corners, and adequate teachers based \non  the  standard  student\u2013teacher  ratio  (40:1).  With  respect  to  processes,  it  will  support  SSRP \ninitiatives to: (i) conduct the national assessment of student achievement for grades 3, 5, and 8; \n(ii)  implement  a  continuous  assessment  system  in  the  early  grades;  and  (iii)  scale  up  the \nprovision of multilingual education. The five TRCs in this output emphasize the implementation \nof priority MECs in needy schools, and national assessment of student achievement. \n \n15. \nOutput  3:  Safer  schools.  The  program  will  help  improve  school  safety,  especially  in \ndensely populated areas, through: (i) vulnerability assessments; (ii) retrofitting and/or rebuilding \nof schools; (iii) providing training to teachers and students on best school safety practices; and \n(iv) training for masons, engineers and sub-engineers in construction of safe schools. The three \nTRCs  in  this  output  will  require  MOE  to  approve  and  implement  the  pilot  school  safety  action \nplan and approve the comprehensive school safety action plan.  \n  \n16. \nOutput  4:  Enhanced  teacher  management  and  development.  A  well-managed  and \nqualified teaching force with role models for disadvantaged students is an essential component \nof  quality  improvement.  The  program  will  support  government  initiatives  to:  (i)  enhance  the \nqualification  upgrading  of  basic  school  teachers;  (ii)  redeploy  teachers  based  on  the  standard \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nstudent\u2013teacher ratio; and (iii) increase the proportional share of female, and Dalit and Janajati \nteachers as per the teacher service commission regulations. Decentralization poses significant \nchallenges  for  teacher  management,  and  the  program  will  also  support  the  design  and \nimplementation by the government of an effective teacher management system. The four TRCs \nin this output require MOE to (i) upgrade the academic qualifications of 7,000 teachers; and (ii) \ndevise and implement an action plan for effective teacher management. \n \n17. \nOutput  5:  Better  management  of  governance  risks  in  the  education  sector.  The \nprogram  will  support  the  government  to  improve  financial  management  and  procurement \nthrough  initiatives  to:  (i)  investigate  and  take  appropriate  actions  on  audit  observations;  (ii) \ninstitute  a  payroll  system  to  disburse teachers\u2019  salaries  through bank  accounts;  (iii)  undertake \ntracking survey to check the flow of funds, particularly in the areas of textbooks, scholarships, \nand per capita funds; (iv) provide procurement training to the relevant staff in accordance with \nthe  provisions  in  the  amended  Public  Procurement  Regulations;  and  (v)  implement  simplified \naccounting procedures and financial management training in all schools. The program will also \nstrengthen  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  through  initiatives  to:  (i)  improve  social \naccountability mechanisms; (ii) strengthen program implementation arrangements; (iii) enhance \nM&E,  and  educational  and  financial  management  information  systems;  and  (iv)  establish  an \nincentive mechanism to promote good practices and innovations in the sector. The nine TRCs in \nthis output will help strengthen the management of governance risks in these two areas. \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n18. \nThe  revised  estimated total  cost for the  SSRP for  FY2012\u2013FY2014  is  $2,705.8 million \nwhich  includes  all  recurrent  and  investment  costs  (Table  1).  This  amount  is  57%  higher  than \nwhat  was  originally  estimated  in  2009  for  the  same  period.  This  is  mainly  due  to  faster  than \nexpected  enrollment  growth,  significant  inflationary  pressures,  teacher  salary  adjustments, \nexpansion  of  the  scholarship  program,  and  the  provision  of  free  textbooks  up  to  grade  10 \n(instead of grade 8). The currently projected available funding over the same period is estimated \nat  $2,365  million,  leaving  a  financing  gap  of  $340.9  million,  excluding  ADB\u2019s  proposed \nassistance. This gap starts in FY2012, increasing substantially thereafter over the next 2 years.8 \n \nThe government has requested a grant not exceeding $65,000,000 from ADB's Special \n19. \nFunds  resources  to  help  finance  the  program.  With  this  grant,  the  total  ADB  support  to  the \nSSRP in FY2010\u2013FY2014 will be $160 million. The terms and conditions for the grant will be as \nset forth in the draft grant agreement.9 The size of the ADB grant has been determined based \non the overall estimated cost of SSRP, the amount the government plans to allocate (defined by \nits  fiscal  space  and  the  Medium  Term  Expenditure  Framework),  ADB\u2019s  overall  assistance \nprogram to Nepal, and the pledged contribution from other development partners (as specified \nin  the  agreements  signed  with  Ministry  of  Finance  to  date).  Given  the  SWAp  modality,  the \nresources  from  development  partners  and  the  government  are  pooled  and  then  allocated  to \ncompeting  needs  in  the  sector.  A  significant  portion  of  the  ADB  funding  will  be  spent  on \ntextbooks,  physical  infrastructure,  scholarships,  and  teacher  management  and  development \n(these  areas  represent  the  largest  share  of  SSRP  spending).  ADB  assistance  through  the \nprogram will narrow the financing gap from $340.9 million (12.6%) to $275.9 million (10.2%).  \n \n20. \nThe government is confident that it will be able to secure additional donor funding and \nincrease its own share to finance the gap. The World Bank is considering an additional grant of \n                                                      \n8  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  Grant Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nabout $75 million from 2012. The Government of Australia is also expected to provide additional \ngrant  cofinancing  equivalent  to  $4.1  million,  of  which $0.5 million  will  be  provided for  capacity \ndevelopment TA for output 3. The government accords high priority to the education sector as \nindicated  in its  budgetary  allocation,  which  has  doubled  during  FY2008\u2013FY2012,  although the \nrelative  share  of  education  has  cautiously  kept  at  16%\u201317%  in  the  same  period.  If  additional \ndonor funding  is  not  available,  the  government  is  committed  to increase its  share to  close  the \nfinancing gap to achieve the SSRP results.    \n\n \nTable 1: Financing Plan \n\nSource \n\nADB (A) \nDevelopment Partners (B) \n\nGovernment (C) \nTotal (A+B+C) \nTotal SSRP Cost \n\nAustralia: $15.6 million, Denmark: $17.9 million, EU/UK: $51.9 million, Finland: \n$13.2 million, FTI: $70.0 million, Norway: $22.4 million, UNICEF: $1.0 million, \nWorld Bank: $72.5 million \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nShare of  \nTotal Cost (%) \n\n65.0 \n264.5 \n\n2,100.5 \n2,430.0 \n2,705.8 \n\n2.4 \n9.8 \n\n77.6 \n89.8 \n100.0 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, EU = European Union, FTI = Fast Track Initiative, FY = fiscal year, SSRP = School \nSector Reform Program, UK = United Kingdom, UNICEF = United Nations Children's Fund. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Education estimates.  \n\n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nProgram management.  MOE  will  be  executing agency  and  DOE  will  be  implementing \n21. \nagency.  The program  will  follow  the  program  management  arrangements  specified  in the  JFA \nfor SSRP. The JFA details the responsibilities of the government and the development partners, \nthe \nfunding  mechanism,  procurement,  reporting,  monitoring  and  auditing,  and  other \nadministrative  requirements.  The  development  partners  meet  regularly  to  review  the  financial \nstatus  and  implementation  progress  of  the  SSRP,  and  to  commit  and  disburse  funds.  The \nprogram  will  focus  on  establishing  stronger  M&E  protocols,  strengthening  fiduciary  risk \nmanagement,  enhancing \nresults-based  consultative  decision  making  processes,  and \nimplementation of the governance and accountability action plan, and recommendations of the  \nperformance audits. \n \n22.  While  the  government  has  demonstrated  a  readiness  to  address  reported  financial \nirregularities  during  the  first  2  years  of  SSRP  implementation,  its  efforts  have  not  been  fully \neffective. This is primarily because of weak coordination and low capacity among MOE, DOE, \ndistrict education offices, and schools. As a result, the DOE has not been able to monitor district \nand school level expenditures and submit timely financial management reports (FMRs). Hence, \nin  addition  to  the  measures  described  in  output  5  (para.  17),  the  program  will  strengthen \ncoordination  between  the  central  and  local  levels,  and  enhance  their  capacity  to  improve \nprogram management.  \n \n23. \n2014. The expected completion date will be 15 July 2014 and closing date 31 December 2014. \n \n24. \nDisbursement  arrangements.  ADB  disbursements  to  the  government  will  depend  on \nthe  government  fulfilling  the  tranche  release  conditions  as  outlined  in  the  Policy  Matrix \n(Appendix 4). The disbursements will be made in three tranches: a first tranche of $10 million in \n\nImplementation period. The program will support the SSRP from January 2012 to July \n\n\f7 \n\nFebruary 2012, a second tranche of $35 million in December 2012, and a third tranche of $20 \nmillion in December 2013. The proceeds of the grant will be disbursed to the Ministry of Finance \nas  the  recipient  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.10 The grant proceeds will be used to \nfinance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items11 and imports financed by other \nbilateral and multilateral sources. No supporting import documentation will be required if, during \neach  year  that  policy-based  grant  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  total \nimports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed \nunder  other  official  development  assistance  is  greater  than  the  amount  expected  to  be \ndisbursed  during  that  year.  The  government  will  submit  with  each  withdrawal  request  a \ncertification  confirming  the  government\u2019s  compliance  with  the  above  formula  in  respect  of  the \nperiod covered by the withdrawal request. \n \n25. \nAll  withdrawals from the grant account will be deposited in the pooled foreign currency \naccount  (FCA)  of  the  government  established  at  the  Nepal  Rastra  Bank.  Under  the  JFA,  the \ndevelopment partners have agreed to use the existing government system for disbursement and \naccounting  of  the  pooled  government  and  development  partner  funds.  MOE  will  use  the \ngovernment\u2019s  reporting  system  to  submit  the  FMR  to  the  pooling  development  partners  each \ntrimester. Reimbursement of the funds from the FCA to the government\u2019s consolidated account \nwill be  contingent upon timely and accurate submission of the actual expenditures through the \nFMR.  The  funds  from  the  FCA  will  be  transferred  to  the  government\u2019s  consolidated  fund  only \nupon the approval of the FMR by the pooling development partners. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n26. \nCapacity development TA will be provided to MOE and DOE to assist them in effectively \nimplementing  the  program.  Support  will  be  provided  for  (i)  data  analysis;  (ii)  student  learning \nassessment;  (iii)  teacher  development;  (iv)  institutional  capacity  enhancement  (in  the  areas  of \nfinancial  management,  public  expenditure  tracking  survey,  procurement  training,  institutional \nanalysis, M&E, and social accountability mechanisms); and (v) program management.12 \n \nThe  government  has  requested  ADB  to  finance,  on  a  grant  basis,  TA  for  $500,000 \n27. \nequivalent  to  be  funded  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).  The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office,  domestic \ntransportation,  communication,  and  administrative  support.  The  TA  will  commence  in  January \n2012 and end in July 2014, and require 4 person-months of international and 37 person-months \nof national consulting services. Consultants will be recruited individually and through a national \nfirm in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from \ntime to time); TA disbursement will follow ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n\n                                                      \n10 ADB. 1998.

Three direct benefits resulting from the program can be identified: \n(i) an average 5% increase in the annual earnings of workers with 8 years of basic education; \n(ii) increased worker productivity; and (iii) improved internal efficiency and reduced educational \nwastage,  including  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  student  years  required  to  complete  basic \neducation, from 11.5 to 9.7.13 In addition, a number of indirect benefits can be expected that are \ndifficult  to  quantify,  including  improved  health  and  sanitation  outcomes,  improved  agricultural \nproductivity, and more informed civic participation. \n \n29. \nFiscal sustainability. The sustainability of SSRP will depend primarily  on two factors: \n(i) the ability of the government to allocate adequate budget to the education sector over time, \nand  (ii)  improvements  in  efficiency  in the  education  sector  as  envisaged.  As  elaborated  in the \nEconomic  and  Financial  Analysis,13  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  position  is  expected  to  improve  in \nthe  coming  years.  The  much-anticipated  conclusion  of  the  protracted  peace  process  and  a \ngradual improvement in the business climate will likely put Nepal on a sustained higher growth \ntrajectory. These positive changes, coupled with the various tax reform initiatives to expand the \ntax  base  and  eliminate  leakages  in  collection,  will  create  additional  fiscal  space  over  time \nenabling the government to increase the share of education spending in the total budget from \n16.3%  in  FY2010  to  19.8%  by  FY2016,  which  will  be  close  to  the  Fast  Track  Initiative\u2019s \nindicative target of 20%. The efficiency gains expected to accrue to Nepal\u2019s education sector as \na result of the reforms being supported by SSRP including restructuring of the school system, \nimproved financial management, and strengthened performance monitoring and evaluation will \nalso  keep  costs  down  while  improving  overall  education  outcomes.  This  will  in  turn  help  in \nreinforcing the long-term fiscal sustainability of Nepal\u2019s education sector. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n30. \nProgram-specific governance risks have been analyzed in line with the requirements of \nADB's  Second  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan.14  The  national  public  financial \nmanagement (PFM) system is generally well designed but unevenly implemented. There have \nbeen  significant  recent  improvements  in  the  public  procurement  system.  For  example,  the \nProcurement  Act,  2007  and  the  establishment  of  the  Public  Procurement  Monitoring  Office \nunder  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  Council  of  Ministers  have  given  direction  for  more \neffective  procurement  management,  but  require  capacity  enhancement  and  further  reforms  to \nminimize fiduciary risks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the program. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \nPoverty  incidence  in  Nepal  has  dropped  to  25%  in  2010  from  31%  in  2005,15  but  the \n31. \ndrop is less dramatic for vulnerable groups. The program will target disadvantaged groups and \npoverty  areas in  (i)  provision  of  education  of  an  acceptable quality,  (ii)  scholarships provision, \n\n                                                      \n13 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB. 2006.

Kathmandu.  \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\n(iii) ECED coverage, (iv) promotion of education in mother-tongue up to grade 3, (v) provision of \nmidday meals, and (vi) recruitment of teachers from excluded groups.16 \n \n32. \nGender  and  development.  Gender  parity  in  NER  reached  0.98  in  primary,  basic,  and \nsecondary  education  in  2010,  showing  the  contribution  of  SSRP  in achieving  gender  equity  in \naccess. However, efforts are required to improve retention and completion rates, and education \noutcomes for girls.  Further,  the  share of  women in the  teaching force  remains low.  A  GVCAP \nhas been developed to promote GESI across the system. Women\u2019s participation in teaching will \nbe  increased  as  a  result  of  the  reservation  policy  introduced  in  January  2011,  and  through  a \ngovernment  action  plan  to  encourage  admission  of  underrepresented  groups  in  teachers \ncolleges, and recruit and upgrade qualifications of under-qualified teachers from these groups. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n33. \nEnvironment.  The  program  falls  into  environmental  category  B.  An  environmental \nassessment  of  the  policy  interventions  shows  that  the  construction  and  operation  of  school \ninfrastructure  may  have  some  minor  impacts  on  the  environment,  all  of  which  can  be \nmitigated.17  The  government  follows  the  National  Environmental  Guidelines  for  School \nImprovement and Facility Management for site selection, design, and monitoring construction of \nschool  building  and sanitation facilities. The guidelines  also follow  the  National  Building  Code, \nwhich  aims  to  ensure  buildings  are  earthquake  safe.  The  program  has  prepared  an \nenvironmental management framework to ensure compliance with environmental safeguards. \n \n34. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  program  falls  into  involuntary  resettlement  category  C. \nThere  will  be  no  involuntary  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  Land  for  school  buildings,  if \nrequired, will be acquired only through either voluntary donation, or a willing buyer\u2013willing seller \napproach.  A  framework  is  in  place  to  (i)  establish  voluntary  donation  and  willing  buyer\u2013willing \nseller procedures, including record keeping of the process and relevant information disclosure; \nand (ii) ensure that the government will follow the stipulated approach.18 \n \nIndigenous peoples. The program falls into indigenous peoples category B because it \n35. \nwill  have  a  positive  impact  on  indigenous  peoples,  who  are  the  direct  program  beneficiaries. \nNepal currently has 59 officially recognized  Janajati groups (indigenous peoples) that together \nmake  up  about  38%  of  the  population.  A  separate  indigenous  peoples\u2019  plan  has  not  been \nprepared as indigenous peoples constitute the majority of program beneficiaries. The elements \nof  an  indigenous  peoples\u2019  plan  are  included  in  the  overall  program  design,  with  affirmative \naction in teacher recruitment, scholarship provision, multilingual education, and ECED provision. \nIndigenous  peoples  communities  were  consulted  during  the  SSRP  appraisal,  and  the  GVCAP \nensures that they are beneficiaries of program implementation. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nPolitical risks. The challenging security situation in some parts of the country makes \n36. \nit  difficult  to  deliver  educational  services,  and  the  program  uses  a  peace  building  tool  to  help \nimprove children\u2019s access to education in these areas.19  Moreover,  delays  in  writing  the  new \nconstitution have affected the approval of amendments to the Education Act, which in turn has \naffected  initiatives  to  formalize  secondary  education  restructuring.  Nonetheless,  while  the \n                                                      \n16 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 These are described in the Environmental Management Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n18 Framework  for  Land  Acquisition  through  Voluntary  Donation  or  Willing  Seller\u2013Willing  Buyer  Process  (accessible \n\nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n19 Peace Building Tool (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n\f10 \n\nfor \n\nin  an \n\nthe  groundwork \n\nincremental  manner  and  preparing \n\ngovernment  is  committed  to  the  amendments  of  the  Education  Act,  MOE  is  carrying  forward \nthe  reforms \nfull-scale \nimplementation once the required legislation is enacted. \n \n37.  Macroeconomic  risks.  Macroeconomic  stability  and  sustained  economic  growth  are \nkey to the government\u2019s ability to allocate sufficient resources to education. The government has \nreasonably maintained macroeconomic stability despite various challenges. Due to slower-than-\nexpected economic growth, continued support from development partners is essential to finance \nand  sustain  program  implementation.  Macroeconomic  risks  are  minimal  as  both  government \nand development partners have continued to accord high priority to education sector reforms. \n \n38. \nGovernance, including fiduciary, risks. An assessment undertaken by ADB indicates \nthat the program faces significant fiduciary risks.20 While a sound financial management policy \nis  in  place, and there are  increased fund flows to local bodies  in line  with Nepal\u2019s strength in \ncommunity involvement, risks include those that arise from the absence of elected local bodies, \na  rigorous  M&E  protocol,  publicly  available  program-related  information,  and  financial \nmanagement capacity. The risks and mitigation measures identified concern improving financial \nmanagement  and  procurement,  monitoring  expenditures  and  performance,  strengthening \ncapacity and internal control as well as compliance mechanisms so that audit irregularities are \naddressed  and  school  management  committees  receive  targeted  support.21  The  government \nhas  committed  to  address  financial  management  issues  by  preparing  an  action  plan  and \nimplementing it with immediate effect. ADB will provide TA to implement this action plan, which \nwill complement the World Bank\u2019s oversight function for fiduciary risk management. Macro-level \nsteps are also being taken to mitigate systemic risks in PFM, procurement, and corruption. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n39. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, PFM, audits, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the  JFA  and grant  documents. The government  has  agreed with ADB  on  the  covenants for \nthe program, which are set forth in the grant agreement. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n40. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, \nunder the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the \nBoard  approve  the  grant  not  exceeding  $65,000,000  to  Nepal  for  the  School  Sector  Program \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n \n \n\n31 October 2011\n\nUrsula Schaefer-Preuss  \nVice-President \n\n \n \n\n                                                      \n20 N.
