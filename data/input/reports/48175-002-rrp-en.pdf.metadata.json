The  GMS  EWEC  has \ncontributed to economic growth in the region since its launch in 1998 as a GMS flagship initiative. \nThe objective of developing the GMS corridor towns is to increase economic activities along these \neconomic  corridors  by  investing  in  urban  infrastructure.  Local  economic  development  in \nMawlamyine,  Hpa-An,  and  Myawaddy  is  indispensable  to  transform  Myanmar\u2019s  portion  of  the \nEWEC  into  a  full-fledged  economic  corridor.  International  tourist  visits  increased  from  about \n50,000 in 2011 to 170,000 in 2016 in Mon State and from 5,000 in 2011 to 90,000 in 2016 in Kayin \nState.3 Border trade at Myawaddy in Myanmar and Mae Sot in Thailand increased from about $1 \nbillion in 2010 to $3 billion in 2016 accounting for about 12% of Myanmar\u2019s border trade.4 The \nproject will be the third phase of the GMS corridor towns development initiative and will contribute \nto environmentally sustainable and inclusive growth of the region. \n \n4. \nCountry\u2019s  urbanization  and  urban  issues.  Although  66.0%  of  Myanmar\u2019s  population \nresides in rural areas, the urban population has grown by 2.5% per year, faster than the country\u2019s total \npopulation (0.8% per year). The percentage of the urban population in Myanmar increased from 27.0% \nof the total population in 2000 to 34.1% of the total population in 2015. It is expected to increase to \n36.9% in 2020 and 42.8% in 2030.5 On the other hand, chronic underinvestment in urban infrastructure \nhas resulted in seriously deficient municipal services throughout Myanmar. Lack of urban infrastructure \nand limited capacity to manage municipal services are major disincentives to external investments, \nwhich are critical to socioeconomic development and growth.6 \n \nRegional context. Kayin State and Mon State have significant potential for development \n5. \ndue to (i) an expected increase in trade with Thailand, (ii) better access to Yangon, (iii) its link to \nthe  Bay  of  Bengal,  (iv)  expected  increases  in  tourist  visits,  and  (v)  connection  with  a  new \ninternational airport in Bago. Upgrading urban infrastructure and developing urban management \ncapacity are essential to strengthen Kayin and Mon states\u2019 competitiveness and tie-in with wider \neconomic growth in the GMS.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for Preparing the Third Greater Mekong \n\nSubregion Corridor Towns Development Project (TA 8756-MYA).  \n\n3  Directorate of Hotels and Tourism of Myanmar. 2017.

New York. \n6  Sector Assessment (Summary): Water and Other Urban Infrastructure and Services (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nProject town profiles. Mawlamyine is the capital of Mon State with an urban population \n6. \nof about 254,000 and has been a hub for trade with Thailand. The town\u2019s history and built heritage \nare  a  major  attraction  for  tourists  but  the  built  environment  is  deteriorating  due  to  improper \nmaintenance. Hpa-An is the capital of Kayin State with an urban population of about 75,000. It is \nexpected to grow as a service center along the EWEC for small industries such as textiles and \nagro-processing.  The  town  also  attracts  tourists  to  its  beautiful  limestone  hills  and  Buddhist \nheritage sites. Myawaddy borders Thailand and has an urban population of about 113,000. The \nGMS  Regional  Investment  Framework  (2013\u20132022)  identified  the  border  crossing  between \nMyawaddy in Myanmar and Mae Sot in Thailand as one of the 17 key GMS border crossings.7 It \nis expected to boost cross-border trade with Thailand upon completion of the second Thailand\u2013\nMyanmar Friendship Bridge in 2019, which is supported by grant funds from the Government of \nThailand.  Development  partners  in  the  urban  sector  have  supported  mainly  Yangon  and \nMandalay, and the proposed project is the first effort to work in Myanmar\u2019s secondary cities in a \nholistic manner. \n \n7. \nCore  issues  and  binding  constraints  in  urban  service  delivery.  Although  the  state \ngovernments through town development committees are tasked with urban planning and urban \nservice  delivery,  they  do  not  effectively  carry  out  their  responsibilities  because  they  lack  staff, \nskills, funds, and data. The following provides an overview of core urban services in the project \ntowns:8  \n\n(i)  Water  supply.  In  Mawlamyine,  30%  of  the  population  has  access  to  piped  water \nsupply and nonrevenue water is estimated at about 80%, while in Hpa-An, only 13% \nof the population has access to piped water supply and nonrevenue water is estimated \nat  70%.  Myawaddy  has  no  public  water  supply  system  but  granted  two  private \noperators the right to distribute piped water for 54% of the population. The operators\u2019 \nnetworks are extended on an ad hoc basis without any formal planning in response to \ncustomer demands. None of the existing facilities in the three project towns treats the \nwater, apart from a natural sedimentation process in Mawlamyine.  \n\n(ii)  Solid waste management. Only about half of the generated waste are collected in \nthe three project towns. The remaining waste is illegally dumped or burned along roads, \nnearby watercourses, and the riverfront. It not only causes environmental degradation \nbut  also  increases  damages  from  seasonal  flooding.  Waste  is  also  taken  to \nuncontrolled  dump  sites  that  are  located  upstream  of  water  supply  river  intakes  in \nMawlamyine, near major tourist attractions in Hpa-An, and along the river bordering \nwith Thailand in Myawaddy.  \n\n \nStrategic  alignment.  The  proposed  project  supports  the  thrusts  of  the  GMS  Strategic \n8. \nFramework  2012\u20132022  in  facilitating  cross-border  trade,  investment,  and  tourism; 9  and  is \nincluded  in  the  GMS  Regional  Investment  Framework  (2013\u20132022). 10  The  development  of \nsustainable cities and reduction of pollution and environmental degradation are included in the \npolicy measures to achieve the government\u2019s overarching goals toward inclusive and sustainable \neconomic  development.11 The  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  country  partnership  strategy  for \nMyanmar 2017\u20132021 identifies infrastructure development as a main pillar of ADB operations.12 The \nproposed project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, and the urban and \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2015.

Key lessons from ongoing ADB-financed urban projects in Myanmar \nand other GMS countries, including the first phase14 and the second phase15 of the GMS corridor \ntowns  development  project,  are  that  (i)  creation  of  urban  and  spatial  development  plans  was \nimportant  to  inform  sector  master  plans  and  infrastructure  project  design;  (ii)  civil  society \nparticipation  and  demand-driven  development  activities  support  local  ownership;  (iii)  a \nstreamlined  approach  to  procurement  and  contract  packaging  secures  effective  project \nimplementation;  (iv)  capacity  development  on  ADB  procedures \nis  crucial  for  efficient \nimplementation;  and  (v)  start-up  assistance  for  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will \naccelerate  project \nthe  project  design  and \nimplementation arrangements.  \n \n10. \nValue added by ADB assistance. ADB added value by introducing new and innovative \napproaches to (i) conserving built heritage from the British colonial period and in traditional Mon \nstyle in Mawlamyine, and (ii) developing a joint spatial development plan for two border towns at \nthe Thailand\u2013Myanmar border. For heritage conservation, the project team prepared a knowledge \nproduct on heritage buildings in Mawlamyine as part of project preparation, and pilot renovation \nof one of the heritage buildings was included in the project. These activities are expected to help \nraise  awareness  on  conservation  and  effective  utilization  of  heritage  buildings,  and  thereby \npromote  opportunities  for  scale  up.  The  joint  spatial  development  plan  will  detail  the  future \ndevelopment strategy for the two linked towns of Mae Sot in Thailand and Myawaddy in Myanmar. \nDevelopment patterns of these two border towns will change substantially upon completion of the \nsecond Thailand\u2013Myanmar Friendship Bridge in 2019, which will bypass the urban center of both \ntowns. The plan will help inform urban management actions responding to rapid urbanization near \nand along the new bridge and access roads by controlling land use and providing urban services. \nThe plan could be a model for future GMS border area development. \n\ninformed \n\nlessons \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\nB. \n \n11. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: increased economic activities along the \nGMS  EWEC  (footnote  8).

The locations for project facilities \nwere  selected  in  consultation  with  the  KSG,  MSG,  and  other  stakeholders.  The  project  team \nanalyzed alternative technical options for each project facility and identified the optimum design \nsolutions.  In  reviewing  the  alternatives,  the  project  team  considered  the  improvement  of  the \noverall  efficiency  of  capital  investment  and  operational  expenditure,  the  use  of  appropriate \ntechnology  within  operating  agencies,  and  the  reduction  of  negative  social  and  environmental \nimpacts. The project will provide training to ensure the sustainable operation and maintenance of \nproject facilities. \n \n21. \nThe Khin Pon Chong dam in Mawlamyine, which was built in 1904, will be rehabilitated to \nadapt to the climate change impacts. The rehabilitation will reduce seepage losses during the dry \nseason and reservoir overflows during the monsoon season, thus the dam will be operated year-\nround, even considering detrimental changes of rainfall and temperature patterns in the future.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic analysis. The economic analysis assesses the economic viability of the project \n22. \nthrough standard cost\u2013benefit analysis.19 The analysis is undertaken separately for each of the \nwater supply and solid waste management components in each project town as well as for the \nbuilt-heritage conservation component in Mawlamyine. Since most of the project benefits cannot \nbe valued within traditional measures, they are assessed in terms of willingness to pay for the \n                                                 \n18  Provided that DUHD will negotiate and sign the consulting service contract. \n19  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fimproved services based on the contingent valuation survey for the water supply and solid waste \nmanagement components. Benefits for the built-heritage conservation component were based on \nincreases in international tourism. The economic analysis indicates that the overall project has an \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 13.1% and an economic net present value of MK1.13 \nbillion.  The  EIRRs  of  water  supply  are  17.6%  in  Mawlamyine,  3.0%  in  Hpa-An,  and  14.8%  in \nMyawaddy. The EIRRs of solid waste are 13.0% in Mawlamyine, 15.9% in Hpa-An, and 18.7% in \nMyawaddy. The heritage component has an EIRR of 35.5%. The high poverty rate in Hpa-An,20 \nvery low coverage of piped water supply,21 current availability of free river and spring water, lack \nof awareness of water quality, and unsanitary hygiene are the factors justifying the low willingness \nto pay for better water supply, which is needed as a basic service. \n \n23. \nFinancial analysis. The government will make the funds available to MSG and KSG. To \nenhance the sustainability of the water supply and solid waste management investments, KSG \nand MSG will prepare a tariff road map at the start of project implementation. The water tariff road \nmap  and  solid  waste  tariff  roadmap  will  be  implemented  for  each  project  town  prior  to  full \noperation, with regular tariff increases to ensure that operational costs are fully covered, while \nensuring affordability by low-income households. If the towns do not have sufficient funds to cover \noperation  expenditures,  the  union  government  and  the  states  will  jointly  undertake  to  balance \neach town\u2019s budget through increased financial support.22 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nThe  risk  rating  for  financial  management  is  high.  The  public  financial  management \nsystems  in  Myanmar  are  relatively  weak  because  of  insufficient  capacity  and  computerization. \nThe major risks are (i) limited capacity of the executing and implementing agencies to (a) conduct \nproject financial management, (b) prepare financial management reports, and (c) implement an \ninternal audit; and (ii) weak financial management system controls. The proposed risk mitigation \nmeasures involve (i) application of the direct payment procedure for all payments without using \nan imprest account; (ii) provision of training for the project management offices (PMOs) on ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement policies and procedures, and international best practices; and (iii) improvement of \nproject budgeting and accounting systems, including computerization. \n \nThe procurement risk is rated high. The executing and implementing agencies do not have \n25. \nexperience  in  implementing  externally  funded  infrastructure  development  projects.  To  mitigate \nprocurement  risks  (i)  the  number  of  contracts  was  reduced  to  a  minimum;  (ii) international \ncompetitive bidding will be used for most procurement packages; (iii) DUHD has requested ADB \nto  assist  in  selecting  the  project  implementation  support  consultant,23 provided  that  DUHD  will \nnegotiate and sign the consulting service contract; and (iv) ample training on ADB\u2019s procurement \nrequirements will be conducted under the project. \n \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  and  discussed \n26. \nwith the government and DUHD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n20  Based  on  the  results  of  the  contingent  valuation  survey  and  a  per  capita  income  of  $1.25/day  as  the  poverty  line,  the  poverty \n\nincidence is estimated at 65.1% for Mawlamyine, at 65.4% for Hpa-An, and at 60.1% for Myawaddy.  \n\n21  The results of the 2014 Household Census for Myanmar indicate that only 1.9% of urban residents of Hpa-An had access to piped \ntap water for drinking and 12.9% had access to piped tap water for other purposes; this compares with 23.1% access to piped tap \nwater for drinking and 53.5% access to piped tap water for other purposes for Myawaddy, and 9.2% access to piped tap water for \ndrinking and 29.7% access to piped tap water for other purposes for Mawlamyine. \n\n22  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23  This contract includes procurement expert inputs. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n27. \nThe  primary  beneficiaries  of  the  three  project  towns  are  the  residents  along  selected \ncorridors. They will benefit from the improved water system and better solid waste management, \nwhich  is  anticipated  to  yield  health  and  economic  gains.  The  stakeholder  strategy  and \nparticipation  plan  for  the  project  will  maximize  the  participation  of  stakeholders\u2014particularly \nwomen, the poor, and vulnerable groups\u2014by raising awareness of the project. As the project is \nin  former  conflict  areas,  PMOs  will  implement  a  detailed  communication  strategy  to  inform  all \nstakeholders of project progress and ensure meaningful dialogue throughout the implementation \nperiod.24 The  project  is categorized  effective  gender mainstreaming.  PMOs  will  implement  and \nmonitor  the  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  action  plan  at  regular  intervals  to  ensure  that \nwomen, the poor, and the vulnerable are included and involved in the project.25 PMOs will collect \nsex-disaggregated data and social and economic background information within a year to help \nestablish baseline figures to track social and gender equality results as the project progresses. \nThe project will establish pro-poor affordability measures through a system of deferred payments \nfor  water  connection  as  well  as  block  water-use  tariffs  with  the  best  rates  available  for  those \nconsuming less. The project will also modernize urban planning and management by building the \ncapacity for community consultation and engagement, which will improve the communication flow \nand trust between the government and residents. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \ncategories  are  as  follows.26 In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  information  disclosure  and  consultation \nrequirements, the safeguard documents for environment and involuntary resettlements have been \nposted on ADB\u2019s website in April 2017. \n \n29. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  team  prepared  an  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  for  both  Kayin  State  and  Mon  State,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement and the applicable environment regulations of the government.27 The project is \nnot expected to cause irreversible adverse environmental impacts. Environmental impacts will be \npredominantly positive; any negative impacts will be due to nuisances during construction. IEEs \nhave  identified  impacts  and  mitigations  with  particular  attention  to  (i)  occupational  health  and \nsafety in construction and operations, (ii) design of landfill sites to prevent leachate migration, and \n(iii)  closure  of  the  existing  dump  sites.  The  IEEs  also  prioritized  the  environment,  health,  and \nsecurity issue in terms of (i) capacity building for the PMOs and project implementation unit, (ii) \ndetailed  specifications  in  tender  documents,  and  (iii)  inspection  and  supervision  during \nconstruction. The project team recommended the integration of the potential impacts of climate \nchange  and  natural  hazards  into  the  detailed  engineering  design.  At  the  detailed  engineering \ndesign  stage,  PMOs  will  update  and  finalize  the  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs). \nEstimated costs to implement the EMPs were integrated into the project costs. The final EMPs, \ncleared  by  ADB,  will  form  part  of  the  bidding  documents.  PMOs  will  ensure  effective \nenvironmental  monitoring  at  all  stages  of  subproject  implementation.  From  March  to  October \n2016, the project team conducted meaningful stakeholder consultations through meetings, key \ninformant interviews, focused group discussions, and public consultations. The IEE also describes \nthe grievance redress mechanism for the project. \n\n                                                 \n24  The community strategy is included in the PAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26  ADB.

In Kayin State, a total area of 24.79 hectares (ha) \nwill be acquired and three households (17 persons) will be affected. The solid waste management \nsubproject  will  have  impacts  on  25  waste-picker  households  (119  persons)  that  will  be \neconomically displaced, of which one household (four persons) requires relocation. In Mon State, \na total area of 19.82 ha will be acquired and two households (10 persons) will be affected. The \nsolid  waste  management  subprojects  will  have  impacts  on  10  waste-picker  households \n(40 persons) that will be economically displaced. All other impacts in both Kayin and Mon states \nare  partial  and  temporary.  The  project  team  has  established  a  cutoff  date  with  extensive \nstakeholder consultation and participation. Counterpart funds will finance an estimated $485,105 \nfor  the  land  acquisition,  compensation,  and  income  restoration  program.  The  project  team \nprepared two resettlement plans for Kayin State and Mon State. The resettlement plans comply \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  consider  relevant  provisions  of  local  laws  and \nregulations. ADB will clear the resettlement plans at appraisal and the updated resettlement plans \nat  the  detailed  engineering  design.  KSG  and  MSG  have  disclosed  project  information  during \nproject preparation, and PMOs will update and distribute a project information booklet during a \ndetailed measurement survey. PMOs will ensure effective monitoring and public consultation with \nall  stakeholders  and  affected  people  at  all  stages  of  project  implementation.  Stakeholder \nconsultations will continue through formal and informal focus group discussions. KSG and MSG \ninformed  the  affected  people  that  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  established  to  help \nfacilitate resolution of complaints regarding project performance. \n \n31. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The population in the project area consists of Bamar \n(55.2%)  followed  by  Kayin  (15.7%)  and  Mon  (11.3%).  However,  no  communities  of  ethnic \nminorities  or  groups  live  separately  in  the  urban  area.  As  the  project  will  benefit  all  residents \nequally,  no  adverse  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  is  anticipated.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement, no separate indigenous peoples\u2019 plans are required. \n\n \n\nF. \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\n32. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.28  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nPoor households do not connect to \nthe centralized water networks. \n\nPMO and PIU staff do not have \nsufficient knowledge and experience \nin the implementation of externally \nfunded projects, thus risks to \nfinancial management and \nprocurement are rated high. \nRevenues of the KSG and MSG are \ninsufficient to cover the operation \nand maintenance of project facilities. \nProject implementation is delayed \nbecause of slow start-up in recruiting \n\nTargeted aid for low-income households will be introduced: \nflexible payment options for water connection or waiver of water \nconnection fees. \nThe number of procurement packages was minimized, and \nmost procurement packages will be procured using \ninternational competitive bidding.
