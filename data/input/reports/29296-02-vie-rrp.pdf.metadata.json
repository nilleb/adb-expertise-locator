High inflation in Viet \nNam  caused  cost  overruns  and  a  financing  gap  of  $131.6  million  (Table  1).  However, \nimplementation  progress  improved  markedly  with  the  mobilization  of  project  implementation \nconsultants  in  May  2006  and  the  transfer  of  project  management  to  the  Hydraulic  Project \nInvestment and Construction Management Board No. 9 (ICMB9) in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) in \nNovember 2006. \n \nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nThe  goal  of  the  project  is  to  contribute  to  sustainable  growth  in  rural,  urban,  and \n4. \nindustrial  areas  of  HCMC  and  surrounding  provinces  in  accordance  with  the  regional  master \nplan. The objective of the project is to provide additional water in the Saigon and Vam Co Dong \nriver basins for developing irrigated agriculture and to supplement existing supplies for salinity \ncontrol  and  domestic,  municipal,  and  industrial  (DMI)  use  in  HCMC  and  the  surrounding \nprovinces. The updated design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n5. \nThe  project  has  two  parts.  Part  A  recognizes  that  successful  project  implementation \nrequires  an  integrated  approach  to  develop  institutional  capacity  to  sustainably  manage  the \nsystem  at  all  levels  and  includes  (i)  managing  implementation  and  building  capacity  in \ngovernment  organizations  to  support  the  sustainable  management  of  project  facilities;  (ii)  the \ntimely  completion  of  on-farm  development,  support  for  organizing  water  users  groups,  and \nsocial support for groups with special needs; and (iii) the implementation of resettlement plans \nand an environmental management plan to mitigate adverse impacts. Part B will construct the \nPhuoc  Hoa  barrage  and  transfer  canal.  The  original  scope  of  the  project  included  developing \nthree new irrigation areas with a combined area of 48,130 hectares (ha): the Binh Long irrigation \nsystem  in  the  provinces  of  Binh  Phuoc  and  Binh  Duong,  Tan  Bien  irrigation  system  (TBIS)  in \nTay Ninh Province, and Duc Hoa irrigation system (DHIS) in Long An Province. \n \nC. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n\n6. \nThe  project  was  initially  estimated  to  cost  $164.6  million  equivalent.  It  is  financed  by \nloans from ADB and Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD). The ADB loan is scheduled \nto close on 31 March 2011. AFD loans were approved on 20 November 2003 for \u20ac29.6 million \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam for the Phuoc Hoa Water Resources Project. Manila (Loan 2025-VIE, $90 million, approved \non 27 November). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n($34  million  equivalent),  and  are  scheduled  to  close  on  30  June  2011.  The  government  was \nexpected  to  finance  $35.6  million  equivalent  in  local  currency,  and  beneficiaries  to  contribute \n$5.0 million in-kind. The actual financing of the initial phase of the project is shown in Table 2.  \n \nD. \n\nStatus of and Progress in Project Implementation  \n\n7. \nThe  original  arrangements  were  for  the  Central  Project  Office  of  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Rural Development (MARD) in Ha Noi to oversee project implementation and be \nresponsible for its management and administration. The Central Project Office was to establish \na project management unit to guide and support existing provincial project management boards \n(PPMBs) in each of the project provinces of Binh Phuoc, Binh Duong, Tay Ninh, and Long An. \n \nProject  implementation  was  initially  slow  and  effectively  commenced  only  with  the \n8. \nmobilization  of  project  implementation  consultants  in  May  2006,  almost  2  years  behind \nschedule.  The  transfer  of  project  management  responsibility  to  ICMB9  further  enabled  more \nefficient  project  implementation.  In  August  2007,  MARD  assigned  to  participating  provinces \nresponsibility  for  managing  the  design  and  construction  of  downstream  canal  systems, \ndeveloping irrigation subproject areas, and implementing the On-Farm and Social Development \nProgram (OSDP). \n \nBy November 2007, halfway through the loan period, implementation progress was still \n9. \nvery  low,  at  11%.  For  the  ADB  loan,  cumulative  contract  awards  were  only  12.1%  of  the  loan \namount and disbursements were 6.4%. For the AFD loans, there were still no contract awards \nor disbursements. An ADB review mission at that time identified significant capital cost overruns \ncaused by rapidly escalating costs for labor, materials, and supplies, which was exacerbated by \ncontinuing  delays  in  awarding  construction  contracts.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs \nalso substantially increased. \n \nA  joint  ADB  and  AFD  midterm  review  mission  in  May  2008  concluded  that  the  project \n10. \ncould  not  achieve  its  main  objectives  without  supplementary  financing.  It  was  agreed  that  the \nremaining funds would be used to complete infrastructure for the basin transfer component and \nfor  related  institutional  development.  With  this  focus,  the  project  would  be  able  achieve  its \npurpose of only providing additional water for DMI and salinity control in the Saigon River basin. \nThis was considered phase 1 of the project. \n \n11. \nAt the request of Binh Duong and Binh Phuoc provincial people\u2019s committees, the Binh \nLong irrigation scheme was cancelled, as the project areas were being converted for industrial \nand residential use or to grow rubber, which does not require irrigation. Phase 2 of the project \nwould  therefore  comprise  preparing  and  implementing  irrigation  development  in  Tay  Ninh  and \nLong  An  provinces.  It  was  subsequently  agreed,  in  November  2008,  that  resettlement  and \nconstruction  for  the  Tan  Bien  main  canal  would  proceed  with  phase  1  funding.2 The  design  of \nirrigation  systems  commenced  in  May  2009  for  Tan  Bien  and  May  2010  for  Duc  Hoa,  with \nOSDP  consultants  facilitating  farmer  consultation  during  design,  assisting  resettlement \npreparation, and helping plan agricultural and social support.  \n \n12. \nAll  basin  transfer  activities  and  Tan  Bien  main  canal  construction  are  expected  to  be \ncompleted on schedule by the end of March 2011. Basic designs were completed in July 2010 \nto  provide  the  layout  and  cost  estimates  for  phase  2.  After  MARD  approves  basic  designs, \n\n                                                 \n2   The  agreement  was  based  on  assurances  from  MARD  on  counterpart  funding,  associated  capital  investments \nbeing completed, resettlement preparation being carried out, and the anticipated economic viability of the TBIS. \n\n\fdetailed  designs  will  be  completed.  The  designs  for  the  TBIS  exclude  substantial  rubber \nplantations  that  will  not  need  irrigation.  Designs  for  the  DHIS  are  flexible  to  accommodate \npossible changes in land use from traditional wetland rice to high-value agricultural crops. \n \nOSDP  consultants  contracted  to  help  form  water  users  groups,  design  agricultural \n13. \nsupport programs, assist with resettlement planning and support to affected people, and monitor \nresettlement implementation initially performed poorly. Progress with OSDP implementation has \nimproved as staff members have been replaced with those who are full-time and fully committed \nto  the  OSDP  objectives.  Project  implementation  consultants  provide  guidance  and  support \ncapacity building. \n \n14. \nA total of 2,183 households (including 305 ethnic minority households) with 9,500 people  \nare affected by ongoing construction in phase 1 and covered by 11 resettlement plans approved \nby  ADB.  Four  resettlement  sites  have  been  established  to  accommodate  people  (including \nethnic  minorities)  wishing  to  relocate.  The  implementation  of  resettlement  and  compensation \nhas  complied  acceptably  with  the  resettlement  framework  and  resettlement  plans.  External \nresettlement is being monitored, with PPMBs addressing any grievances. \n \n15. \nAn  ADB  safeguard  review  mission  in  March  2008  noted  considerable  progress  in \nachieving  environmental  targets  at  a  rate  commensurate  with  the  needs  of  the  project.  Some \nenvironmental  safeguard  measures  that  were  delayed  but  have  since been  completed  include \nADB\u2019s  approval  of  the  revised  environmental  management  plan  and  the  approval  of  the \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  by  the  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment  in \nMarch 2008. The buffer zone management program that aims to protect natural habitats in Lo \nGo  Xa Mat  National Park and production forest reserves in Tay Ninh Province will commence \nimplementation in phase 2. \n \n16. \nProject  implementation  consultants  have  provided  effective  management  and  technical \nsupport to ICMB9 and PPMBs. They have supported the project task force in irrigation system \nmanagement  and  guided  OSDP  and  environmental  monitoring  consultants.  PPMBs  have \ngenerally  been  active  in  shouldering  their  management  responsibilities  despite  limited  staff \nresources  and  capacity  and,  initially,  a  lack  of  experience  with  the  social  requirements  of \nresettlement or the concept of participatory irrigation management (PIM).    \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Cost Overrun \n\n17. \nAs described in paras 25 and 26 below, increased costs have caused a funding gap of \n$131.6  million  that  will  require  supplementary  funding  from  ADB,  AFD  and  the  government. \nIncreased costs can be attributed to several factors, including higher inflation than was initially \nassumed \ninflation,  and  some \nunderestimation of unit rates and quantities for construction in the original feasibility study.3  \n \nB. \n\nimplementation  delays  compounding \n\nImpact on the Project \n\nin  cost  estimates, \n\nThe  impact  and  outcome  of  the  project  have  not  changed.4 The  outputs  have  been \n18. \nupdated  to  achieve  the  outcome  and  contribute  to  the  impact.  These  outputs  are  (i) \n\n                                                 \n3 Analysis of Cost Overruns (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4 The original \"goal\" is now the \"impact\" and the original \"objective\" is now the \"outcome\". \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nin \n\nthe  original  project  design,  which  emphasizes  creating \n\nstrengthened  capacity  of  water  related  organizations  in  the  Phuoc  Hoa  area;  (ii)  on-farm \nirrigation systems developed and intensified agricultural practices adopted; (iii) project affected \nhouseholds fully resettled and compensated; (iv) environmental management plan successfully \nimplemented; (v) basin transfer facilities operating, and irrigation and DMI water supplied; and \n(vi) irrigation facilities constructed and operating.  \n \n19.  Major developments in water resource management and irrigation since 2000 are (i) the \ntransfer  of  responsibility  for  state  management  of  water  resources  to  the  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources  and  Environment,  which  separates  state  management  and  service  functions  for \nwater  resources  that  were  formerly  MARD\u2019s  responsibility;  (ii)  responsibility  for  managing  on-\nfarm  irrigation  systems  being  assigned  to  water  users;  (iii)  and  the  promotion  of  PIM  to \nstrengthen  the  role  of  water  users  in  designing  and  operating  irrigation  systems.  These \nimportant developments, particularly those that decentralize irrigation system management, are \naccommodated \ninstitutional \narrangements  for  farmer-based  irrigation  management  and  building  capacity  in  irrigation \nmanagement  companies  (IMCs)  and  farmer  organizations  to  operate  and  maintain  project \nirrigation systems. These activities will be further supported during phase 2. \n \n20. \nPart A of the project substantially invested in sustainable systems management, which is \nalready  building  capacity  in  organizations  responsible  for  managing  the  basin  transfer  system \nthat will supply water for irrigation, DMI uses, and salinity control, as well as in IMCs to operate \nproject-funded  irrigation  systems.  A  task  force  created  by  MARD  to  guide  the  development  of \nmanagement objectives for the combined Dau Tieng\u2013Phuoc Hoa water resource management \nsystem  has  approved  an  action  plan  for  sustainable  systems  management,  which  is  under \nimplementation. The training and capacity building plan is being implemented with support from \nproject implementation consultants, and the formulation of operational management plans and \nmaintenance and asset management plans for IMCs is already well advanced. \n \nA  PIM  approach  to  irrigation  design  and  operation  strengthens  water  users\u2019  ownership \n21. \nand  commitment  to  take  responsibility  for  on-farm  irrigation  management  and  the  capacity  of \nIMCs to efficiently and responsively manage irrigation systems. Support for PIM is incorporated \ninto the OSDP and will be strengthened during phase 2 by a senior PIM adviser to the ICMB9, \nproject  steering  committee  (PSC),  task  force,  and  provincial  governments.  Ongoing  capacity \nbuilding  for  operating  the  basin  transfer  system  and  project-funded  irrigation  systems  will \naddress the management needs for water resource infrastructure established under the project.  \n \nC. \n\nRationale  \n\n22. \nThe proposed supplementary financing complies with ADB\u2019s criteria, as (i) it will ensure \nthe  successful  completion  of  an  ADB-financed  project  with  cost  overruns;  (ii)  the  project \ncontinues to be a priority in the government\u2019s development strategy; (iii) it will help achieve the \noriginal project objectives and benefits; (iv) the project has satisfactory implementation progress \nand appears likely to attain its development objectives; (v) the project is in an advanced stage of \nimplementation, enabling the ADB-funded components to be completed within 3 years; and (vi) \nthe  cofinancier,  AFD,  will  finance  a  substantial  part  of  the  cost  overrun  through  an  additional \nloan  to  be  processed  in  parallel  with  ADB\u2019s  supplementary  financing.  The  government \nrequested ADB and AFD to provide supplementary financing to complete the project and ensure \nachievement  of  its  original  objectives.  The  ADB  supplementary  loan  was  confirmed  in \nconsultations with government and is reflected in the country operations business plan.5 \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2008. Country Operations Business Plan: Viet Nam, 2009\u20132011. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n23.  Without supplementary financing, the project would not achieve its original objectives to \ndevelop irrigation in the TBIS and the DHIS on 20,545 ha. Further, without constructing the Duc \nHoa main canal, the project would not reliably supply water to existing irrigation systems in Tay \nNinh  Province  (2,657  ha  not  related  to  the  TBIS)  or  HCMC  (900  ha  in  Cu  Chi  district),  or  the \nplanned  4  cubic  meters  (m3)/second  of  DMI  water  to  Long  An  Province.  The  Tan  Bien  main \ncanal  would  remain  underutilized,  supplying  only  DMI  water  to  Tay  Ninh  Province.  Ongoing \ndesign work for the Duc Hoa main canal, TBIS, DHIS, and OSDP programs would be wasted. \n \nD. \n\nRevised Cost Estimates \n\n24. \nAlong  with  actual  expenditure,  the  total  funding  required  to  complete  phase  1  is \nestimated  at  $174.6  million.  Phase  2  expenditure  is  estimated  at  $154.9  million.  Total  project \nexpenditure to complete both phases 1 and 2 is estimated at $329.5 million.6  \n \n\nTable 1: Consolidated Total Project Costa \n($ million) \n\nOriginal Cost \nEstimates \n\nActual and \nEstimated \nPhase 1 Costsb \n\nEstimated \nPhase 2 \nCosts  \n\nTotal \nCostsc \n\n \nBase Cost \nPart A: Institutional development   \nPart B: Water resources infrastructure \nContingenciesd \nInterest During Implementation \n \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \nB. \nC. \n  \na  \nb   Actual expenditure up to supplementary loan appraisal in July 2010, and estimated costs to end of Phase 1. \nc   May not total exactly because of rounding. \nd   The  devaluation  of  the  dong  during  phase  1  meant  savings  in  US  dollar  terms;  thus  the  negative  price \ncontingency.

Supplementary  financing \nestimated  at  $131.6  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of  $8.4  million,  is  required  to  complete \nthe  project.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $60.0  million  from  ADB  Special  Funds \nresources  and  additional  cofinancing  of  \u20ac20  million  ($25.0  million  equivalent)  from  AFD  to \nsupplement the loans from ADB and AFD that  were agreed in 2003.  The ADB supplementary \nloan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest rate of 1% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the initial loan agreement, as amended for \nsupplementary financing. Interest charges on the loan will be capitalized. The AFD loan will be \nprovided as parallel collaborative cofinancing. Subject to negotiations, the AFD loan will be as \nconcessionary as possible, with an interest rate subject to change every 6 months, a long term, \nand  a  long  grace  period.  Interest  charges  on  the  AFD  loan  will  not  be  capitalized.  The \ngovernment\u2019s supplementary financing is $42.9 million, including local taxes and duties. Farmer \nbeneficiaries will contribute $3.7 million in services provided in kind.  \n                                                 \n6   Detailed Cost Estimates (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fSource \nAsian Development Bank \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \nFarmer beneficiaries \nGovernment \n\n \n\nTotal \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nActual \nFinancing \n95.0a \n36.0a \n0.0 \n66.9 \n197.9 \n\nOriginal \nFinancing \n90.0 \n34.0 \n  5.0 \n35.6 \n164.6 \n\nSupplementary \nFinancingb \n60.0 \n25.0 \n3.7 \n42.9 \n131.6 \n\nTotal \nFinancing \n\n155.0 \n61.0 \n3.7 \n109.8 \n329.5 \n\nShare of \nTotal (%)c \n47.0 \n18.5 \n1.1 \n33.3 \n100.0 \n\na   Funds  available  to  the  project  without  supplementary  financing.

ADB  will  also  finance  civil  works  construction  for  the  Duc  Hoa  main  canal \nand most of the packages for the DHIS. AFD will administer its loan and finance the OSDP, civil \nworks construction for the TBIS, and one of the packages for the DHIS.  \n \nF. \n\nRemedial Steps   \n\n27. \nThe  main  constraints  on  achieving  project  construction  as  scheduled  under  the \nsupplementary  loan  are  (i)  the  timely  conclusion  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  which, \naccording  to  ADB  requirements,  must  be  completed  before  commencing  construction  on  the \nrelevant  sections,  and  (ii)  delays  in  processing  construction  design  approvals  and  contracting \nconstruction.  To  accelerate  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  PPMBs  will,  under  ICMB9 \nsupervision,  ensure  that  detailed  measurement  surveys  are  completed  without  delay  following \nthe finalization of detailed design for project canals and irrigation systems, and that resettlement \nplans  are  updated  and  promptly  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval.  PPMBs  will  prepare  budget \nrequests,  and  ICMB9  will  facilitate  their  approval  by  MARD  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  The \nPSC will request provincial people\u2019s committees (PPCs) to ensure that (i) provincial and district \nresettlement  committees  are  active,  (ii)  funds  for  resettlement  are  disbursed  as  rapidly  as \npossible,  and  (iii)  grievances  are  urgently  addressed  according  to  agreed  procedures.  To \nfacilitate this, a representative from the PPC of HCMC will be added to the PSC.  \n \n28. \nDelays  in  preparing  and  implementing  construction  contracts  for  phase 2  could  require \nfurther extending the loan closing date and additional cost overruns. This risk will be mitigated \nby ensuring the timely completion of ongoing construction design and the advance preparation \nof phase 2 construction bidding documents and contracting procedures. ICMB9 will create and \nmaintain a database of all project contracts, including contract adjustments that can be included \nin project reports, to maintain up-to-date reconciliation of funds.  \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nCurrent  implementation  arrangements  will  be  maintained  for  supplementary  financing. \n29. \nMARD  has  delegated  project  management  responsibility  to  ICMB9,  including  construction  of \nDuc  Hoa  main  canal.  PPCs  in  Tay  Ninh  and  Long  An  provinces  and  HCMC  are  the \nimplementing  agencies  responsible  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  under  phase  2. \nProvincial  departments  of  agriculture  and  rural  development  and  their  PPMBs  are  responsible \nfor implementing and managing the design and construction of primary, secondary, tertiary, and \non-farm  canal  systems  in  the  irrigation  areas  and  for  implementing  the  OSDP.  Existing \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\farrangements  for  resettlement  monitoring,  environmental  management,  accounting,  auditing, \nand reporting will be maintained under supplementary financing.  \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement  \n\nArrangements \nApril 2011\u2013March 2014 \n31 March 2014 \n\nProject steering committee \nVice minister, MARD (chair)  \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development \nPPCs  and  departments  of  agriculture  and  rural  development  of  Binh  Duong,  Binh \nPhuoc, Tay Ninh and Long An provinces; and PPC of HCMC  \nICMB9, with 30 staffers located in HCMC  \n1 contract \nICB \n14 contracts \nNCB \n594 person-months \nSSS \nQCBS \n110 person-months \nFor detailed designs and the completion of resettlement plans based on them, up to \n$12 million, or 20% of the ADB loan, can be used for expenditures incurred before \nloan effectiveness but not more than 12 months before the signing of the loan \nagreement. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nupon between the government and ADB. \n\n$29.8 million \n$58.4 million \n$3.4 million \n$4.3 million \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  HCMC  =  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  ICB  =  international  competitive  bidding,  ICMB9  = \nHydraulic Project Investment and Construction Management Board No. 9, MARD = Ministry of Agriculture and Rural \nDevelopment, NCB = national competitive bidding, PPC = provincial people\u2019s committee, QCBS = quality- and cost-\nbased selection, SSS = single-source selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n30.  With ADB supplementary loan financing, the project will be extended by 3 years to 9.5 \nyears, with completion expected by 31 March 2014. AFD cofinancing will continue for a further 2 \nyears  until  31  March  2016  to  facilitate  farmers\u2019  completion  of  on-farm  irrigation  systems  and \nsupport the adoption of improved agricultural methods for irrigation systems. \n \n31. \nCivil works and related services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement under the AFD loan will follow \nAFD  guidelines.  State-owned  enterprises  will  be  eligible  to  bid  for  contracts  if  they  are  legally \nand financially autonomous, are independent of MARD and provincial departments, and operate \non the basis of commercial law and practice.  \n \n32. \nThe  civil  works  in  phase  2  are  small  canals  over  a  wide  expanse  in  isolated  areas. \nTechnical  designs  are  simple,  local  firms  are  experienced,  and  local  labor  is  expected  to  be \nused extensively. As it is highly unlikely that overseas firms would be interested, it is proposed \nthat the threshold for international competitive bidding be raised from $2 million to $5 million, so \nthat civil works estimated at $5 million or less will be procured by national competitive bidding \n(NCB) using ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents for small works. A grievance point person will \nbe designated for each contract. \n \n33. \nGoods will be procured through international competitive bidding if more than $500,000, \nNCB  if  $100,000\u2013$500,000,  and  shopping  if  less  than  $100,000.  The  government\u2019s  standard \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nbidding  documents  and  procedures  will  be  used  for  shopping  and  NCB  if  they  comply  closely \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.7  \n \n34. \nThe firm Black and Veatch International provided project implementation and integrated \nmanagement services during phase 1, and its performance was assessed as highly satisfactory. \nThe executing agency requested that the same firm be contracted by single-source selection for \nphase 2, as the work is a natural continuation of services commenced under phase 1.  \n \nNational  consultants  employed  in  phase  1  whose  performance  was  assessed  as \n35. \nsatisfactory will be contracted again following single-source selection, as these services are also \nnatural  continuation.  Otherwise,  replacement  consultants  will  be  selected  by  consultant \nqualification  selection.  Other  national  consultants  will  be  recruited  to  supervise  the  detailed \ndesign and construction of various components following quality- and cost-based selection with \nan 80:20 ratio of technical considerations to cost.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n36. \nThe  project  will  increase  water  supply,  make  it  more  reliable,  and  produce  benefits \nthrough  irrigation  and  DMI  water  use.  The  primary  irrigation  benefit  is  increased  agricultural \nproduction.  Secondary  benefits  that  cannot  necessarily  be  quantified  include  (i)  salinity \nabatement  in  the  Saigon  and  Vam  Co  Dong  rivers;  (ii)  improved  drainage  associated  with \nirrigation  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  other  multiple  use  and  domestic  use  benefits  such  as  the \nrecreational  use  of  reservoirs,  improved  water  supply  for  cleaning  and  drinking  in  rural \nhouseholds and watering home gardens, and impacts on health and livelihood.  \n \n37. \nEconomic analysis of phase 1, with estimated costs of $174.6 million and benefits from \n34  m3/second  of  DMI  water,  resulted  in  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  10.8%. \nEconomic analysis for both phases 1 and 2, with estimated costs of $329.5 million and including \nbenefits  from  20,545  ha  of  irrigation  in  the  TBIS  and  DHIS,  plus  benefits  from  supplying \nsupplementary  irrigation  water  to  a  further  3,557  ha  directly  from  the  Duc  Hoa  main  canal, \nresulted in an EIRR of 12.3%. DMI benefits arise from water distributed by the project in the four \nprovinces  and  HCMC.  The  economic  return  for  phase  2\u2014funded  by  supplementary  loans  to \ncomplete  the  TBIS  and  the  DHIS,  with  all  investment  in  phase  1  considered  a  sunk  cost,  and \nwith  agricultural  benefits  from  the  two  irrigation  areas,  supplementary  irrigation,  and  7.5 \nm3/second of DMI water\u2014generates an EIRR of 16.9%.8   \n \n38. \nThe economic analysis shows that continuing the investment in phase 2 to complete the \nproject  is  viable,  with  a  higher  economic  return  than  the  option  of  stopping  the  project  with \nphase 1. However, the economic return is sensitive to the timing of benefit realization, with any \ndelay in completing the infrastructure and the primary, secondary, tertiary, and on-farm irrigation \nnetwork  significantly  damaging  economic  performance.  Adequate  maintenance  of \nthe \ncompleted  infrastructure,  ongoing  support  to  farmers  in  irrigation  management,  and  the \nfunctioning of PIM are also important to achieving the full potential of the investment.  \n \n\n                                                 \n7  Revisions to the Project Administration Memorandum (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fFarm  budget  analysis  indicates  a  considerable  increase  in  annual  net  farm  income, \n39. \nranging from $1,150 to $1,682 per ha, increasing farm income by 102% to 258%.9 The financial \ngain  from  irrigation  development  will  give  farmer  beneficiaries  incentive  to  participate  in  the \nproject. Further, long-term demand for water for rural and DMI use seems assured, as studies of \nwater  resources  indicate  future  water  shortages  in  the  region  as  it  develops  economically, \nespecially industrially in Long An Province, so economic benefits appear to be sustainable.  \n \nB. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n40. \nA total of 4,683 households (including 14 ethnic minority households) with 21,537 people \nwill  be  affected  by  construction  in  phase  2.  Of  these,  1,151 households  are  expected  to \nexperience  severe  effects.  A  total  of  22  ha  of  residential  land  and  692  ha  of  agricultural  and \nother land will be permanently acquired. For the Duc Hoa main canal, 80 households will have \nto  relocate  their  houses  and  shops.  For  the  DHIS,  36 households  and  two  shops  will  be \nrelocated. For the TBIS, eight households will have to relocate. Preliminary inquiries reveal that \nmost affected households will take cash compensation and manage their own relocation. On top \nof  assistance  and  allowances  provided  to  affected  people,  social  support  programs  will  be \nimplemented  to  ensure  that  their  incomes  are  restored  and  their  livelihoods  developed.  Some \naffected people will seek government assistance to arrange a new settlement site.10  \n \nThe  government  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  a  resettlement  framework  that  sets  out \n41. \ncompensation  and  other  entitlements  for  any  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.11 It  has  been \nupdated  and  complies  with  current  government  policy  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009) and will be applied under supplementary financing. The project remains category A for \nresettlement.  Resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  for  the  TBIS,12 Duc  Hoa  main  canal,13 \nand DHIS.14 They will be updated upon the completion of detailed engineering designs and the \ncollection of data from detailed measurement surveys.  \n \nFourteen Khmer ethnic minority households with 60 people live in the Tan Bien irrigation \n42. \narea. None of them is severely affected by land acquisition or resettlement.15 The project will not \nnegatively  affect  (i)  customary  rights  to  use,  and  access  to,  land  and  natural  resources;  (ii) \nsocioeconomic status; (iii) cultural and communal integrity; (iv) health, education, livelihood, and \nsocial security status; or (v) the recognition of indigenous knowledge. Further, the vulnerability \nof  affected  ethnic  minorities  is  not  worsened. 16  There  are  10,553  females  living  in  4,683 \nhouseholds affected by the project.17  \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts  \n\n43. \nIn  accordance  with  ADB  policies  for  supplementary  financing,  an  addendum  to  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  has  been  prepared.18 As  the  project  scope  is  unchanged,  it \n\n                                                 \n9   The increase in farm income is higher in the DHIS than in the TBIS because more intensive agriculture is practiced \n\nin Duc Hoa and the impact of improved irrigation is greater. \n\n10  Resettlement Issues (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11  Resettlement Framework: Updated (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12  Resettlement Plan: Tan Bien Irrigation (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13  Resettlement Plan: Duc Hoa Main Canal (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  Resettlement Plan: Duc Hoa Irrigation (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15  Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy:  Updated  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n16  Updated Poverty and Social Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  Addendum to the Environment Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nremains environmental category A. Potentially significant impacts have been mitigated through \npreventive  measures  and  offsets  currently  under  implementation.  Impacts  pertaining  to  the \nsupplementary  loan  are  temporary,  reversible,  and  localized,  and  no  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impacts are foreseen.  \n \nD. \n\nRisks  \n\n44. \nFarmers\u2019  slow  adoption  of  irrigated  agriculture  has  the  potential  to  delay  benefits.  In \nprevious irrigation projects where only primary and secondary canals were completed, farmers \nwere  unable  to  mobilize  resources  to  complete  tertiary  and  on-farm  infrastructure. The  project \nwill adhere to provincial government policy and complete construction to the tertiary  level with \nassistance from counterpart funds. Farmers\u2019 contributions will be limited to constructing on-farm \nirrigation systems and providing labor for maintenance of tertiary canals. Further, the OSDP will \nfacilitate  the  formation  of  water  users  groups  and  the  extension  of  irrigated  agriculture \ntechnologies  based  on  market  demand.  With  this  support,  farmer  adoption  is  expected  to  be \nrapid.  \n \n45. \nAn  integrated  river  basin  approach  involving  all  government  agencies  active  in  water \nresources  management  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  needs  of  all  stakeholders  are \nconsidered. While the project design provides for organizational capacity building to manage the \nneeds  of  rural  and  DMI  water  users,  a  more  comprehensive  approach  will  be  adopted  by \ncooperating  with  related  initiatives  that  also  consider  the  operational  demands  of  upstream \nhydropower companies. AFD is providing a technical assistance grant to study integrated river \nbasin management and address these concerns.19 \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n46. \nThe government has assured ADB that the implementation of the project shall conform \nto all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  loan \ndocuments. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n47. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nsupplementary loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR38,594,000 to the Socialist Republic \nof Viet Nam for the Phuoc Hoa Water Resources Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nwith  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms \nand  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \n\n9 March 2011   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n                                                 \n19 Terms of Reference for Integrated River Basin Management Study (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK: UPDATED \n\nPerformance Targets \nand/or Indicators \n\nData Sources/ Reporting \nMechanisms  \n\n \nReal average economic \ngrowth rate in the project \narea increases from 6.4% to \n8.5% during the period 2016 \nto 2020  \n\n \nUpdates of the general \nmaster plan report for \nsocial economic \ndevelopment of the south \neast region \n\n \n55 cubic meters of water per \nsecond diverted from the Be \nRiver to the Dau Tieng \nReservoir on the Saigon \nRiver by 2014 \n\n \nDaily records of the \nsystem monitoring basin \ntransfers from Phuoc Hoa \nto Dau Tieng Reservoir  \n\nMonitoring reports of the \nIMCs \n\nAssumptions and Risks  \n\nAssumptions \nStable political and local security \nconditions \n\nRisks \nRapidly changing economic \nsituation and production patterns \n\nAdverse global climate change \n\nAssumptions \nDau Tieng IMC building capacity \nto efficiently manage basin \ntransfers \n\nSurplus supplies continuing to be \navailable in the Be River for \ndiversion to Dau Tieng Reservoir. \n\nRisks \nExtraordinary weather events \nsuch as prolonged drought and \ntyphoons \n\n \nDau Tieng IMC operates the \nbasin transfer facilities and \nmain canals efficiently and \nsustainably by 2014 \n\nProvincial IMCs operate the \nprimary and secondary \ncanals efficiently and reliably \ndeliver water to farmers by \n2014 \n\nWater users groups formed \nfor 90% of irrigable area by \n2016 \n\n50% of the farmers in the \nproject areas adopt \ndiversified farming practices \nand produce higher valued \ncrops by 2016 \n\n \nMaintenance plan and \nfinancial records of Dau \nTieng IMC \n\nAssumptions \nImplementing agencies with \nsufficient numbers of qualified \nstaff \n\nMaintenance plan and \nfinancial records of \nprovincial IMCs \n\nDau Tieng and provincial IMCs \nadopt modern techniques for \noperating the basin transfer \nfacilities and irrigation systems \n\nRisks \nInteragency conflicts threaten the \nintegrated operation of the system \n\nICMB9 progress reports  \n\nADB review mission \nreports \n\nProject completion report \n\nAssumptions \nAgricultural credit available to \nsupport on-farm investment \n\nMarkets and prices of farm \noutputs provide adequate \nincentives for farmers \n\n \n\n \n\n3.
