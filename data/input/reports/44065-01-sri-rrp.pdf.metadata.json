The conflict intensified from February 2007 and government forces gained full control \nof the entire land area by 18 May 2009. The conflict has had a devastating impact on the war-\naffected  northern  region  and  its  population;  much  of  the  infrastructure  has  been  damaged  or \ndestroyed,  access  to  basic  social  services  has  been  disrupted  and  the  livelihood  of  the \npopulation severely affected. The incidence of poverty in Northern Province is estimated at 37% \n(compared  with  15%  for  the  country  as  a  whole),  which  is  probably  an  underestimate  of  the \nactual poverty. The province contributed a mere 2.9% of the country's gross domestic product \nover 2005\u20132007, despite having 14% of the country's land mass, 40% of the coastal belt, and \n6%  of  the  population.  The  prolonged  conflict  has  caused  immense  human  suffering,  with \ncivilians getting internally displaced from their homes, thus creating an estimated 277,000 new \ninternally displaced persons (IDPs).2 With progress on de-mining of the affected area, the IDPs \nare  returning  to  their  original  areas  of  residence. 3  As  of  early  March  2010,  according  to \ngovernment  estimates,  about  85,000\u201390,000  IDPs  were  still  to  be  resettled  in  their  original \nplaces of residence.  \n \nThe  immediate  need  in  the  post-conflict  phase  is  to  resettle  the  IDPs  in  their  original \n3. \narea  of  residence,  provide  them  with  relief,  reestablish  basic  services,  revive  the  people\u2019s \nlivelihood,  and  restore  the  most  urgently  needed  damaged  infrastructure.  On  1  July  2009,  the \ngovernment  launched  a  180-day  plan  for  resettlement  of  IDPs  and  to  enable  them  to  restart \ntheir  livelihoods. 4\n   The  180-day  plan  includes  the  restoration  of  public  administration,  social \nservices,  and  community  and  social  infrastructure  to  meet  the  most  critical  basic  needs  of  the \nIDPs. To support the 180-day program, the government requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and other development partners to (i) assist with restarting stalled projects in the conflict-\naffected  areas,  (ii)  provide  additional  assistance  through  surplus  funds  and  loan  savings  from \n\n                                                 \n1   \"Internal  armed  conflict\"  refers  to  the  armed  conflict  between  the  government  and  the  Liberation  Tigers  of  Tamil \n\n2   The conflict also led to an estimated 70,000 people losing their lives. The IDPs were initially housed in 32 welfare \n\nEelam. \n\ncenters. \n\n3   The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is supporting the District Mine Action Office. The Sri Lankan \narmy  and  mining  clearing  agencies  (six  international  and  one  national)  are  involved  in  mine  clearing  activity  in \naccordance  with the International Mine Action Standards. The District Mine Action Office does the final check on \nthe  quality  of  de-mining  and  certifies  the  area  safe  for  return  of  IDPs.  Several  bilateral  development  partners\u2014\nAustralia, Denmark, India, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014are \nsupporting de-mining.  \n\n4  The plan is part of the Wadakkin Wasantham Development Program\u2014a plan of action for implementation of a 180-\nday program in the northern region. This program is also called the Northern Reawakening. Department of National \nPlanning.  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Planning.  October  2009.

A needs assessment was conducted by the government and a medium-term strategy \nwas formulated. The strategy focuses on (i) resettlement of displaced persons and protection of \ntheir  fundamental  rights;  (ii)  revitalization  of  basic  livelihood  through  revival  and  expansion  of \nproductive  sectors;  (iii)  accelerated  development  of  infrastructure  in  roads,  electricity,  ports, \ntransport,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and  housing;  (iv)  improvement  in  the  rural  economy \nthrough  technological  transformation;  (v)  sustainable  extraction  of  marine  resources;  (vi) \nimprovement in knowledge, skills, and talent of youth; (vii) institutional reform for upgrading the \nquality  and  performance  of  public  service;  and  (viii)  encouraging  private  investment  through \nestablishment of industrial estates. The total investment required for the program during 2010\u2013\n2012 is estimated at $2.68 billion.6 \n \n4. \nTo  meet  some  of  the  most  urgent  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  priorities,  the \ngovernment has requested ADB for emergency loan assistance for the Conflict-Affected Region \nEmergency  Project.  ADB  fielded  three  missions  to  the  conflict-affected  regions  in  Northern \nProvince,  Eastern  Province,  and  the  adjoining  areas  of  North  Central  Province.  Extensive \ndiscussions were held with district officials and representatives of the provincial councils, central \nline  ministries,  Ministry  of  Nation  Building  and  Estate  Infrastructure  Development,  and  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  and  Planning.  Due  to  security  concerns  in  the  post-conflict  period  and  the \ngradual  release  and  return  of  IDPs,  the  processing  of  the  project  was  delayed.  Based  on \ndiscussions  with  the  government,  preliminary  processing  began  in  November  2009.  Although \nthe formal request by the government for the emergency loan was made on 19 January 2010, \nthe actual processing took more than 12 weeks, exceeding the requirements of the Disaster and \nEmergency Assistance Policy.7 \n \n5. \nThe objective of the project is to significantly expand and strengthen the reconstruction \nof urgently needed essential infrastructure and administrative services, assist in meeting basic \nhuman  needs  and  create  livelihood  and  sustainable  employment  opportunities  in  the  conflict-\naffected  areas  by  supporting  the  recovery  of  the  region's  economy.  The  project  will  focus \nprimarily  on  the  war-affected  Northern  Province,  and  some  components  will  focus  on  Eastern \nProvince and some border villages in North Central Province, which were also affected by the \nconflict. \n \n6. \nThe  project  is  part  of  the  wider  assistance  being  provided  by  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment  partners  to  the  returning  IDPs  in  the  conflict-affected  areas. 8  The  Australian \nAgency  for  International  Development  has  provided  livelihood  grants  to  returning  IDPs \nchanneled through ADB and World Bank projects. India is supplying relief materials for shelter, \nagriculture,  medical  supplies,  and  temporary  hospital  facilities,  and  is  supporting  vocational \ntraining  center  rehabilitation  and  the  reconstruction  of  railways.  The  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency  (JICA)  is  assisting  in  rehabilitation  of  minor  irrigation  tanks,  agriculture, \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB,  together  with  the  United  Nations  and  the  World  Bank,  conducted  a  joint  needs  assessment  in  2003,  and \n\nongoing projects in Northern and Eastern provinces were formulated based on this assessment. \n\n6   Department of National Planning.

The  United  Nations  and  affiliated  agencies  and  a  number  of \nbilateral development partners have been providing humanitarian, rehabilitation, and livelihood \nassistance.10 The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is implementing the Access \nto  Justice  Project.  The  project  provides  legal  aid  and  documentation  to  IDPs  and  conflict-\naffected  persons,  training  of  justice  sector  officials,  alternate  dispute  resolution  services,  and \nlegal assistance to vulnerable groups. The United States Agency for International Development \nis supporting the Public\u2013Private Alliance Project and a program to reintegrate ex-combatants in \nNorthern  and  Eastern  provinces.  Immediate  rehabilitation  needs  and  creation  of  livelihood  are \nalso  being  met  through  the  World  Bank's  Emergency  Northern  Recovery  Project,  approved  in \nDecember 2009, and through its ongoing projects in housing, community livelihood, the health \nand education sectors, and provincial roads.  \n \n7. \nFor the last several years ADB has engaged in development work in the conflict-affected \nareas. Following cessation of hostilities in May 2009, ADB continued to address the immediate \nrehabilitation needs of IDPs through its ongoing projects in the north and the east of the country. \nThe North  East Community Restoration and Development  (NECORD)  II project is focusing on \nrepairing damaged schools, hospitals, and administrative buildings, providing tractors to farmers \nto  restart  agriculture,  and  providing  livelihood  grants  to  30,000  IDP  families.11 The  Conflict-\nAffected Areas Rehabilitation Project is expediting the ongoing road works in the area; a motor \nlaunch has been provided to connect outlying islands with the Jaffna Peninsula.12 Installation of \nthe  medium-sized  and  rural  electrification  schemes,  especially  in  Kilinochchi  and  Mullaitivu \ndistricts,  has  been  restarted.  Loan  savings  of  nearly  $5  million  from  the  Secondary  Education \nand Modernization Project II13 and Education for Knowledge Society Project14 are being used to \nfund rehabilitation of nearly 500 schools in Northern Province for urgent repairs to the buildings \nand  rehabilitation  of  computer  and  science  labs.  Under  the  Aquatic  Resources  Development \nand  Quality  Improvement  Project,  $410,000  has  been  allocated  to  restart  livelihoods  through \ndevelopment  of  inland  fisheries  in  reservoirs  in  Northern  Province. 15 Rehabilitation  activities \nhave  been  further  strengthened  with  provision  of  supplementary  finance  of  $12.8  million  from \nloan  savings  and  cancellation  to  the  NECORD  II  project.  In  addition,  further  loan  savings  and \ncancellations of around $13 million is expected to be used to provide a supplementary loan to \n\n                                                 \n9   JICA  is  processing  a  skills  training  program  for  frontline  officers  in  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces  to  undertake \ncommunity  development.  The  project  is  at  a  formulation  stage  and  is  expected  to  start  in  mid  2010.  The \nimplementation period is expected to be 3 years. \n\n10  The  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  is  providing  immediate  livelihood  assistance  such  as  provision  of  seeds, \nfarm equipment, garden tools, and fertilizers. It has also assisted in rice and paddy plantation on more than 4,000 \nhectares of land. \n\n11 Livelihood provision was through an Australian Agency for International Development grant of A$8 million. \n12 ADB.  2003.

Rehabilitation and reconstruction of essential infrastructure by this and other projects \nwill  make  private  investment  viable  and  result  in  accelerated  economic  growth  and  therefore \nincrease  employment  opportunities.  Along  with  improved  service  delivery  and  rapid  economic \ngrowth,  the  incidence  of  poverty  in  the  region  is  expected  to  fall  from  37%  in  2010  to  15%  in \n2020. Significant employment opportunities will also be created by the project itself. \n \n9. \nSeveral  key  outcomes  will  emerge  from  the  project.  Reestablishing  connectivity  by \nrepairing damaged roads in the municipal areas, provincial roads, and some national roads will \nimprove access to basic services and enable marketing and trade to resume, one of the keys to \nthe  reestablishment  of  livelihood.  It  will  also  reduce  travel  times  by  about  30%  and  reduce \nvehicle  operating  costs  by  20%.  With  better  connectivity,  private  sector  investment  will  be \nattracted to the region. \n \nBasic utilities such as drinking water and electricity are grossly inadequate in the region \n10. \ndue  to  a  long  period  of  underinvestment  because  of  the  prevailing  conflict  situation  and  poor \nmaintenance  of  existing  structures.  The  proportion  of  the  population  covered  by  piped  water \nvaries between 2% and 20% in different districts of the north. The project will provide improved \naccess  to  power  to  about  750,000  people  in  Northern  Province,  and  about  35,000  people  will \ngain access to safe drinking water in Northern and Eastern provinces. Sustainable and gainful \nmeans of employment requires that small and medium-sized irrigation works are rehabilitated so \nthat agricultural activities can be revived. By investing in such irrigation schemes, the project will \nenable 6,000 families to restart cultivation on about 6,500 hectares of land. The rebuilding and \nrehabilitation of three vocational training institutes, and providing them with related facilities, will \nhelp  to  meet  the  critical  skills  shortages,  generating  nonfarm  employment  for  about  1,200 \npeople  per  annum.  Prolonged  conflict  has  also  severely  affected  the  functioning  and \neffectiveness of the governance structure, including public administration and judicial services. \nThe  administrative  structure  has  been  weakened  due  to  the  war  and  damaged  buildings. \nRepairing  them  will  allow  effective  service  delivery  to  be  restored.  Prolonged  conflict  has  also \nhampered the effective functioning of institutions responsible for civil and judicial administration \nin Northern Province. Having a fully operational governance system is essential to support early \nrecovery  efforts  and  sustain  rehabilitation  and  rebuilding  initiatives.  This  component  of  the \nproject will provide about 1 million people with access to essential legal services. \n \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB.  2002.

Manila (Loan 1993-SRI[SF]). \n\n17 Muttur  is  in  the  Trincomalee  district  in  Eastern  Province.  The  area  is  largely  populated  by  IDPs  from  Eastern \n\nProvince, serving a population of 55,000 people. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nprovides more details.18  \n \n\nThe outputs of the project are summarized below while the project component analysis \n\n1. \n\nComponent A: Reestablishing Connectivity \n\n12. \nThis component will rehabilitate (i) 65 kilometers (km) of national roads (B category) in \nNorthern  Province,  (ii)  100  km  of  provincial  roads  in  Kilinochchi,  Mannar,  Mullaitivu  and \nVavuniya districts,19 and (iii) 100 km of municipal and urban council roads in Northern Province \nand rural roads in the adjoining villages of North Central Province. Rehabilitation of these roads \nwill increase connectivity for the returning IDPs,  facilitating the provision of basic services and \nlivelihood  recovery  and  encourage  increased  investment.  Local  and  provincial  council  roads \nserve communities located away from the centers of economic activity which have high poverty \nincidence and lack economic opportunities. This component will focus on some critical sections \nof the road network that will complement the work supported by other development partners as \nwell as future planned work, including work by ADB.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent B: Restoring Utilities \n\n13.  Most of the electricity infrastructure was destroyed during the conflict, and the remaining \ninfrastructure  has  deteriorated  due  to  lack  of  maintenance.  The  project  will  support  the \nreconstruction of the Chunnakam grid station and the Kilinochchi\u2013Chunnakam transmission line. \nThis  will  provide  the  essential  link  to  Jaffna,  as  JICA  is  supporting  the  reconstruction  of  the \ndamaged transmission line from Vavuniya to Kilinochchi.  \n \n14. \nthe  water  supply  schemes  at \nEchchalampattu  in  Trincomalee  district  and  Point  Pedro  in  Jaffna  district.  These  schemes  are \ndesigned  to  meet  the  needs  of  resettled  IDPs.  The  population  relies  mainly  on  dug  and  tube \nwells  for  their  water  needs;  this  water  is  not  always  fit  for  consumption,  nor  the  wells  easy  to \nuse.  Moreover,  development  activities  that  will  take  place  in  the  area  in  the  near  future  will \ncreate greater demand for water supply facilities.  \n \n\n The  water  supply  subcomponent  will  support \n\n3. \n\nComponent C: Improving Basic Social Services \n\n15. \nThis  component  will  restore  some  essential  basic  social  services  and  livelihood \nopportunities  of  the  population  by  (i) restoring  about  10  small  and  medium-sized  irrigation \nschemes as agriculture is the main source of livelihood;20 (ii) rebuilding 10 administrative offices \nand  providing  related  facilities;  and  (iii) rehabilitating  and  reconstructing  district  vocational \ntraining centers in Kilinochchi, Mannar, and Mullaitivu. \n \n16. \nAgriculture  is  the  key  economic  activity  for  a  majority  of  the  population  in  Northern \nProvince. The province is in the dry zone, and rains from the northwest monsoon are limited and \nirregular. The cropping intensity in the province remains low as a majority of tanks and canals \nare dilapidated due to limited or no investment since the early 1980s. ADB is also exploring the \n\n                                                 \n18 Project Component Analysis (Appendix 2). \n19 Rehabilitation of provincial roads in the Jaffna district is being undertaken by the World Bank under the Provincial \n\nRoads Project. \n\n20 Restoration and improvement of irrigation schemes is also being undertaken by the World Bank in its Emergency \nNorthern Recovery Project and its ongoing Reawakening Project. ADB has confined its operation to 10 high-impact \nsmall and medium-sized irrigation schemes. \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\npossibility of a grant project which will complement components A and C by rehabilitating 200 \nkm  of  field  irrigation  canals  and  about  150  km  of  rural  access  roads  with  extensive  IDP \nparticipation. \n \n17.  Most  of  the  district  and  divisional  administration  buildings  in  Northern  Province  have \nbeen  damaged;  in  Kilinochchi  and  Mullaitivu,  almost  all  district  and  divisional  secretariats  and \nlocal authority buildings have been destroyed. However, some offices are being repaired under \nthe 180-day program. These institutions have also lost most of the office furniture, equipment, \nmachinery, and vehicles. \n \n18. \nThere  are  16  technical  education  and  vocational  training  centers  in  Northern  Province, \nsome  of  which  have  been  closed  due  to  the  conflict.  The  youth  in  the  province  have  not \nacquired new skills; hence their employment prospects are low. Repair and refurbishment of the \nvocational  training  centers  is  essential  for  the  development  of  the  war-affected  region  in  the \nshort-to-medium term.   \n \n\n4. \n\nComponent D: Legal Infrastructure \n\n19. \nThis component will rehabilitate courthouses and related facilities in up to nine strategic \nlocations  in  Northern  Province.21 The  prolonged  conflict  has  prevented  institutions  responsible \nfor  civil  and  judicial  administration  in  Northern  Province  from  functioning  effectively.  With  the \nend  of  the  conflict,  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  the  judicial  infrastructure  is  urgently \nneeded, as its absence is negatively impacting the perceived personal and communal security \nof the war-affected communities and IDPs. Judicial officers have already been appointed and at \npresent most of the court proceedings take place under extremely difficult conditions in partially \ndamaged buildings.  \n \n20. \nThe project's support for reconstruction of physical legal infrastructure will be provided in \ncoordination  with  UNDP,  which  is  implementing  its  Access  to  Justice  Project.  A  letter  of \nunderstanding was signed with UNDP in March 2010 so that the two activities complement each \nother to ensure comprehensive development of the justice sector.  \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n \n21. \nThe  project  investment  plan  is  estimated  at  $168  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \n$18  million  to  be  financed  by  the  government.

There will be eight implementing agencies for the four components. A \nproject  coordination  and  quality  assurance  unit  (PCQAU)  will  be  created  at  the  MNBEID,  with \nexperienced  staff  to  supervise  the  overall  implementation  of  the  project  and  provide  oversight \nfor  standardization  of  bidding  documents,  procurement  evaluation  and  other  procurement \nmatters,  accounting,  quality  assurance,  and  safeguard  compliance  of  the  project.  Most  of  the \nimplementing  agencies  have  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects  and  will  use  existing  project \nimplement  projects. 23  Implementing  agencies  not  currently \nmanagement  structures \nimplementing  ADB-funded  projects  will  be  provided  with  full  support  by  the  PCQAU  and  will \n                                                 \n23 The  new  project  implementation  units  will  be  the  Northern  Provincial  Council  (Provincial  Irrigation  Department), \nNorth  Central  Province  (Provincial  Irrigation  Department),  and  the  Ministry  of  Public  Administration  and  Home \nAffairs (Table 3: Implementation Arrangements). \n\nto \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nestablish  a  core  implementing  unit  using  existing  staff.  The  proposed  implementation \narrangements are provided in Table 3. \n \n24. \nThe  basic  design,  bill  of  quantities  (including  specifications),  procurement,  and \nsupervision  of  works  will  be  undertaken  by  the  government  agencies  responsible  for  the \nrespective  components.  The  technical  personnel  in  each  of  the  line  agencies  will  be \nsupplemented with additional staff and paid from project funds. The government has agreed to \nexpedite approval from the Department of Management Services for recruiting additional staff.  \n \n25. \nA  national  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  the  MNBEID,  will  meet \nmonthly for the first 6 months, and bimonthly after that. The committee will provide guidance to \nthe implementing agencies on policy aspects and review the overall progress of the project. The \ncommittee  will  also  liaise  with  the  presidential  task  force  for  policy  guidance.  The  provincial \nproject  coordination  committees,  chaired  by  the  chief  secretary  of  the  Northern  Province  or \nNorth  Central  Province  respectively  and  with  representatives  from  the  line  agencies  of  the \nprovinces as members, will review and approve the projects identified and proposed by the line \nagencies and departments of the provinces. This will be relevant for the provincial roads, urban \nand local roads, irrigation schemes, administrative infrastructure, and training centers. \n \n26. \nThe  government  has  requested  ADB's  approval  of  advance  action  for  recruitment  of \nconsultants and procurement of goods and civil works, including inviting and receiving bids for \ncontracts  for  projects  that  might  be  approved  for  implementation  prior  to  loan  effectiveness, \nprovided the advance actions take place on or after 1 December 2009, the concluding date of \nproject's initial fact-finding.

Bilateral  development  partners  are  considering  providing \nadditional  support  in  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces  to  help  returning  IDPs  meet  their  basic \nneeds  and  reestablish  their  livelihood.  Some  development  partners  may  be  willing  to \ncomplement  ADB  funds  for  this  project  through  cofinancing.  ADB  has  typically  sought  Board \napproval  for  the  administration  of  loan  or  grant  funds  from  cofinanciers  only  when  cofinancing \ncommitments are in place. In light of the need for expediency and efficiency in ADB's response \nto  post-conflict  recovery  and  rehabilitation,  Management  requests  Board  approval  of  the \nadministration of any cofinanced funds obtained from development partners subsequent to the \ndate of Board approval, consistent with the objective, purpose or scope of the project. Approval \nof such cofinanced funds will be confirmed and approved by Management, and reported to the \nBoard in accordance with standard reporting procedures. \n \n\n                                                 \n24  The project administration manual describes the implementation arrangements in more detail (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nF. \n\nProject Selection Criteria \n\n30. \nIn  choosing  the  project  components,  discussions  were  held  with  provincial,  local,  and \nnational  government  officials  and  administrative  staff,  most  of  whom  were  directly  responsible \nfor delivering essential services to IDPs. With the process of resettlement of IDPs still ongoing \nand  de-mining  activities  also  in  progress  in  many  areas,  the  IDPs  (the  intended  beneficiaries) \ncould  not  be  consulted.  During  implementation,  discussions  will  be  held  with  the  IDPs, \ncommunity-based  organizations,  nongovernment  organizations,  user  groups  (e.g.,  farmer \norganizations),  and  local  political  leaders  to  ensure  ownership  and  maximize  project  benefits. \nThis will be particularly relevant to components relating to local, municipal, and provincial roads; \nirrigation works; administrative structures; and legal facilities.  \n \nProjects  will  be  selected  to  ensure  equitable  distribution  of  rehabilitation  works  across \n31. \nthe  entire  Northern  Province,  taking  into  account  geographic  and  sector  balance  along  with \nethnic  composition.  Project  selection  will  incorporate  conflict-sensitivity  guidelines. 25  Where \nnecessary for project selection, people in target villages will be consulted in a gender-sensitive \nway,  and  also  encouraged  to  participate  in  construction  work  as  wage  labor.  During  project \nimplementation,  contractors  will  ensure  that  there  is  wage  parity  for  male  and  female  labor. \nLessons  from  emergency  loans  such  as  the  NECORD,26 Conflict-Affected  Area  Rehabilitation \nProject,27 and  Tsunami-Affected  Area  Rehabilitation  Project28 have  been  incorporated  in  the \ndesign.  The  government  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  the  following  project  selection  and  criteria: \n(i) de-mining  is  completed  and  safe  access  is  assured  by  the  government  to  the  IDPs  and \nproject  staff;  (ii)  the  targeted  beneficiaries  have  either  returned  to  the  project  area  or  the \ngovernment  provides  a  plan  to  resettle  the  IDPs  in  the  area;  (iii)  there  is  balance  of  activities \nbetween districts and communities; and (iv) projects can be completed within the loan period.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n32. \nSince this project has been processed as an emergency intervention, in accordance with \nthe  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  (2004),  financial  and  economic  rates  have  not \nbeen  calculated  for  the  different  components  except  for  the  power  sector.  In  choosing  the \nproject  design,  emphasis  will  be  on  least-cost  solutions  without  being  prejudicial  to  quality \nassurance in rehabilitation or reconstruction work. In the power sector component, the economic \ninternal rate of return is estimated at 24.4%.29 \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n33. \nThe  implementing  agencies  comprise  both  central  and  provincial  agencies,  with  the \nprovincial  agencies  operating  in  a  devolved  governance  structure  introduced  by  the  13th \n\n                                                 \n25  Criteria, Identification and Selection of Projects (Appendix 2). \n26 ADB. 2005.

The use of provincial authorities as implementing agencies for \nproject  components  under  provincial  council  administration  will  enhance \ntheir  project \nmanagement capacity and strengthen devolution. The project coordinating committee structure \nwill facilitate stakeholder inputs at the provincial level in the prioritization and design of projects. \nAll  implementing  agencies  have  experience  in  implementing  projects  of  similar  nature  with \nexternal funding. \n \n34. \nThe  public  financial  management  system  of  Sri  Lanka  revolves  around  the  Ministry  of \nFinance  and  Planning,  with  key  departments  such  as  Budget,  Treasury  Operations,  External \nResources,  and  Planning.  Budgetary  allocations  for  provincial  councils  are  made  on  the \nrecommendations  of  the  Finance Commission,  a  constitutionally  created  independent  body.  In \nthis  project,  as  the  funds  are  for  immediate  reconstruction  activities,  funds  will  be  channeled \nthrough  the  MNBEID.  The  supervisory  role  of  the  PCQAU  will  enhance  the  integrity  of \nprocurement  and  flow  of  funds  along  with  procedural  safeguards  in  the  Treasury  Operations \nDepartment. Executing and implementing agencies are subject to regular independent audits by \nthe  auditor  general  whose  report  is  tabled  in  Parliament  and  is  subject  to  wide  and  public \ndiscussion  by  the  two  parliamentary  oversight  committees.  The  auditor  general  audits \ncompliance  with  procurement  guidelines  and  financial  regulations.  ADB  has  requested  the \nAuditor  General  for  a  separate  audit  opinion  on  compliance  with  financial  covenants  in  its \nprojects. Project procurement will be subject to ADB's Procurement Guidelines.  \n \n35. \nThe  Bribery  Act  No.  11  of  1954  (as  amended),  and  the  Declaration  of  Asset  and \nLiabilities Act No. 1 of 1975, are the principle legislative instruments dealing with anticorruption. \nThis  framework  is  applicable  to  public  officers.  As  key  project  staff  in  the  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies  are  existing  public  officials,  this  framework  will  provide  a  strong  legal \nbasis to deal with bribery and corruption. Use of open competitive bidding, transparency in the \nselection  of  projects,  and  the  oversight  role  of  ADB  will  ensure  integrity  in  procurement  and \nimplementation  activities.  The  executing  agency  will  maintain  a  project  website  that  will  be \nupdated regularly and will include (at a minimum) (i) bidding procedures, bidders, and contract \nawards;  (ii)  use  of  the  funds  disbursed  under  the  project;  and  (iii)  physical  progress.  ADB's \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with \ngovernment  and  the  executing  agency.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nlivelihoods, \n\nincomes,  and  property  has  resulted \n\nThe conflict has severely affected the communities in these areas. Loss of life, access to \n36. \nbasic  social  services, \nin  significant \nsocioeconomic and psychological stress. Essential investments have not been made for a long \ntime.  One  of  the  key  issues  identified  in  the  country  partnership  strategy  for  Sri  Lanka  is  that \nreduction of poverty is closely linked to infrastructure development. 30 The project will reestablish \nvital services such as roads, irrigation infrastructure, power, water supply, and public and legal \nservices to revive economic activities leading to employment, income generation, rehabilitation \nof  displaced  persons,  and  restoration  of  social  stability  in  these  areas.  The  return  and \nresettlement of IDPs in their original villages will require the provision of basic infrastructure and \nservices to enable them to reestablish their homes and restart livelihood activities, especially in \nthe traditional sectors of agriculture and fishing. \n \n\n                                                 \n30 ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: Sri Lanka, 2009 \u20132011. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\nDue to decades of conflict, the burdens on women to manage, care, and provide for the \n37. \nfamily  have  drastically  increased  and  their  roles  and  responsibilities  have  changed  with  the \ndeath, disappearance, or migration of male family members. The beneficiaries of the project will \nbe  people  affected  by  the  conflict,  which  includes  IDPs,  host  communities  (those  who  did  not \nmove  from  the  residences  due  to  conflict),  and  the  poor.  War  widows,  households  headed  by \nwomen,  and  single  women  with  elderly  and  war-disabled  family  members  will  require  special \nsupport  to  assist  them  in  resettlement  with  housing,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and  power \nfacilities, and reestablishment of livelihood-related activities for economic survival. 31 \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nD. \n\n38. \nThis project is not expected to require land acquisition or resettlement, as reconstruction \nwill occur at original sites or along existing corridors. However, since exact locations of projects \nhave not been identified at this stage, resettlement impacts of a specific project of the loan will \nonly  be  known  during  project  implementation,  and  as  a  result  the  resettlement  plans  will  be \nprepared, if necessary, in accordance with the resettlement framework in the course of project \nimplementation. No project component or project with potential involuntary resettlement impacts \nwill  be  implemented  until  an  appropriate  resettlement  planning  instrument  to  address  such \nimpacts  is  formulated,  approved  by  ADB  and  respective  authorities  in  the  government,  and \nimplemented  following  the  guidelines  given  in  the  resettlement  framework.32 The  resettlement \nframework sets out the policy and procedures for screening project components and projects to \nidentify resettlement impacts, if any, and to guide the executing and implementing agencies on \nhow to prepare resettlement plans to address such impacts adequately and to implement them \neffectively.  \n \n39. \nFrom  an  environmental  standpoint,  the  project  is  classified  category  B  as  it  is  unlikely \nthat  any  proposed  projects  will  lead  to  any  adverse  irreversible  impacts.  Initial  environmental \nexaminations will be conducted for the transmission line and grid substation, roads, and water \nsupply  components.  Contracts  for  these  components  will  be  awarded  only  after  approval  of \ninitial  environmental  examinations  and  environmental  management  plans  by  ADB  and  the \ngovernment  (if  required),  and  the  plans  will  form  part  of  the  contract  documents.  All  other \nprojects  will  follow  environmental  assessment  procedures  stipulated  in  the  environmental \nassessment framework. The framework has been developed to ensure compliance with ADB's \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009).33 \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n40.  Major  risks  are  (i)  tensions  arising  from  beneficiaries  due  to  perceived  inequities  in \ndistribution  of  project  benefits  and/or  dispute  over  land,  (ii)  dominance  of  outside  contractors \nand  labor  in  project  civil  works,  (iii)  delay  in  clearing  land  mines  leading  to  delay  in  project \nimplementation,  (iv)  inadequate  institutional  capacity  among  national  and  provincial  agencies \nand \nlocal  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based  organizations,  and  (v) \ninadequate  coordination  among  development  partners.  The  government  and  ADB  are  actively \nengaged  in  implementing  measures  to  mitigate  these  risks.  The  project  design  incorporates \nfeatures to mitigate some of these risks, such as adopting the conflict-sensitivity guidelines and \nencouraging the use of local labor through the bidding documents. Training will also be provided \nto  local  contractors  on  ADB's  policies  and  procedures.  The  Government,  in  collaboration  with \n\n                                                 \n31  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n32  Involuntary Resettlement Assessment and Measures (Appendix 2). \n33  Environmental Assessment and Measures (Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n13\n\nbilateral  development  partners,  is  making  good  progress  in  clearing  mines  but  the  completion \nwill  still  take  time  given  the  need  to  proceed  carefully.  To  overcome  capacity  constraints, \nadditional technical staff and consulting services, as required, will be recruited by the executing \nand  the  implementing  agencies.
