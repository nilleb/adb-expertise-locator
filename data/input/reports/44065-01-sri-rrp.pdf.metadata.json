I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Conflict-Affected Region Emergency \nProject. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  For nearly three decades, Sri Lanka has been severely affected by an internal armed \nconflict.1 While the entire country suffered because of the conflict, Northern Province bore the \nbrunt of it. The conflict intensified from February 2007 and government forces gained full control \nof the entire land area by 18 May 2009. The conflict has had a devastating impact on the war-\naffected northern region and its population; much of the infrastructure has been damaged or \ndestroyed,  access  to  basic  social  services  has  been  disrupted  and  the  livelihood  of  the \npopulation severely affected. The incidence of poverty in Northern Province is estimated at 37% \n(compared with 15% for the country as a whole), which is probably an underestimate of the \nactual poverty. The province contributed a mere 2.9% of the country's gross domestic product \nover 2005\u20132007, despite having 14% of the country's land mass, 40% of the coastal belt, and \n6%  of  the  population.  The  prolonged  conflict  has  caused  immense  human  suffering,  with \ncivilians getting internally displaced from their homes, thus creating an estimated 277,000 new \ninternally displaced persons (IDPs).2 With progress on de-mining of the affected area, the IDPs \nare  returning  to  their  original  areas  of  residence.3 As  of  early  March  2010,  according  to \ngovernment estimates, about 85,000\u201390,000 IDPs were still to be resettled in their original \nplaces of residence.  \n \n3.  The immediate need in the post-conflict phase is to resettle the IDPs in their original \narea of residence, provide them with relief, reestablish basic services, revive the people\u2019s \nlivelihood, and restore the most urgently needed damaged infrastructure. On 1 July 2009, the \ngovernment launched a 180-day plan for resettlement of IDPs and to enable them to restart \ntheir livelihoods.4 The 180-day plan includes the restoration of public administration, social \n  \nservices, and community and social infrastructure to meet the most critical basic needs of the \nIDPs.To support the 180-day program, the government requested the Asian Development Bank \n \n(ADB) and other development partners to (i) assist with restarting stalled projects in the conflict-\naffected areas, (ii) provide additional assistance through surplus funds and loan savings from \n                                                 \n1  \"Internal armed conflict\" refers to the armed conflict between the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil \nEelam. \n2  The conflict also led to an estimated 70,000 people losing their lives. The IDPs were initially housed in 32 welfare \ncenters. \n3  The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is supporting the District Mine Action Office. The Sri Lankan \narmy and mining clearing agencies (six international and one national) are involved in mine clearing activity in \naccordance with the International Mine Action Standards. The District Mine Action Office does the final check on \nthe quality of de-mining and certifies the area safe for return of IDPs. Several bilateral development partners\u2014\nAustralia, Denmark, India, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014are \nsupporting de-mining.  \n4  The plan is part of the Wadakkin Wasantham Development Program\u2014a plan of action for implementation of a 180-\nday program in the northern region. This program is also called the Northern Reawakening. Department of National \nPlanning. Ministry of Finance and Planning. October 2009.

Colombo.  \n ", " 2 \nthe existing portfolio, and (iii) provide additional emergency financing. 5 A presidential task force \nwas appointed in July 2009 with the task of formulating a strategic framework for revitalizing the \neconomy of the northern region to ensure livelihood recovery and a sustained reduction in \npoverty. A needs assessment was conducted by the government and a medium-term strategy \nwas formulated. The strategy focuses on (i) resettlement of displaced persons and protection of \ntheir fundamental rights; (ii) revitalization of basic livelihood through revival and expansion of \nproductive sectors; (iii) accelerated development of infrastructure in roads, electricity, ports, \ntransport, water supply and sanitation, and housing; (iv) improvement in the rural economy \nthrough  technological  transformation;  (v)  sustainable  extraction  of  marine  resources;  (vi) \nimprovement in knowledge, skills, and talent of youth; (vii) institutional reform for upgrading the \nquality and performance of public service; and (viii) encouraging private investment through \nestablishment of industrial estates. The total investment required for the program during 2010\u2013\n2012 is estimated at $2.68 billion.6 \n \n4.  To  meet  some  of  the  most  urgent  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  priorities,  the \ngovernment has requested ADB for emergency loan assistance for the Conflict-Affected Region \nEmergency Project. ADB fielded three missions to the conflict-affected regions in Northern \nProvince,  Eastern  Province,  and  the  adjoining  areas  of  North  Central  Province.  Extensive \ndiscussions were held with district officials and representatives of the provincial councils, central \nline  ministries,  Ministry  of  Nation  Building  and  Estate  Infrastructure  Development,  and  the \nMinistry of Finance and Planning. Due to security concerns in the post-conflict period and the \ngradual release and return of IDPs, the processing of the project was delayed. Based on \ndiscussions with the government, preliminary processing began in November 2009. Although \nthe formal request by the government for the emergency loan was made on 19 January 2010, \nthe actual processing took more than 12 weeks, exceeding the requirements of the Disaster and \nEmergency Assistance Policy.7 \n \n5.  The objective of the project is to significantly expand and strengthen the reconstruction \nof urgently needed essential infrastructure and administrative services, assist in meeting basic \nhuman needs and create livelihood and sustainable employment opportunities in the conflict-\naffected areas by supporting the recovery of the region's economy. The project will focus \nprimarily on the war-affected Northern Province, and some components will focus on Eastern \nProvince and some border villages in North Central Province, which were also affected by the \nconflict. \n \n6.  The  project  is  part  of  the  wider  assistance  being  provided  by  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment  partners  to  the  returning  IDPs  in  the  conflict-affected  areas.8 The  Australian \nAgency  for  International  Development  has  provided  livelihood  grants  to  returning  IDPs \nchanneled through ADB and World Bank projects. India is supplying relief materials for shelter, \nagriculture, medical supplies, and temporary hospital facilities, and is supporting vocational \ntraining  center  rehabilitation  and  the  reconstruction  of  railways.  The  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency (JICA) is assisting in rehabilitation of minor irrigation tanks, agriculture, \n                                                 \n5  ADB, together with the United Nations and the World Bank, conducted a joint needs assessment in 2003, and \nongoing projects in Northern and Eastern provinces were formulated based on this assessment. \n6  Department of National Planning.

", "      3\nrural and provincial roads and the power sector.9 The People's Republic of China has provided \nhumanitarian assistance and construction equipment, and is also providing substantial support \nfor the rehabilitation of roads. The United Nations and affiliated agencies and a number of \nbilateral development partners have been providing humanitarian, rehabilitation, and livelihood \nassistance.10 The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is implementing the Access \nto Justice Project. The project provides legal aid and documentation to IDPs and conflict-\naffected persons, training of justice sector officials, alternate dispute resolution services, and \nlegal assistance to vulnerable groups. The United States Agency for International Development \nis supporting the Public\u2013Private Alliance Project and a program to reintegrate ex-combatants in \nNorthern and Eastern provinces. Immediate rehabilitation needs and creation of livelihood are \nalso being met through the World Bank's Emergency Northern Recovery Project, approved in \nDecember 2009, and through its ongoing projects in housing, community livelihood, the health \nand education sectors, and provincial roads.  \n \n7.  For the last several years ADB has engaged in development work in the conflict-affected \nareas. Following cessation of hostilities in May 2009, ADB continued to address the immediate \nrehabilitation needs of IDPs through its ongoing projects in the north and the east of the country. \nThe North East Community Restoration and Development (NECORD) II project is focusing on \nrepairing damaged schools, hospitals, and administrative buildings, providing tractors to farmers \nto restart agriculture, and providing livelihood grants to 30,000 IDP families.11 The Conflict-\nAffected Areas Rehabilitation Project is expediting the ongoing road works in the area; a motor \nlaunch has been provided to connect outlying islands with the Jaffna Peninsula.12 Installation of \nthe medium-sized and rural electrification schemes, especially in Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu \ndistricts, has been restarted. Loan savings of nearly $5 million from the Secondary Education \nand Modernization Project II13 and Education for Knowledge Society Project14 are being used to \nfund rehabilitation of nearly 500 schools in Northern Province for urgent repairs to the buildings \nand rehabilitation of computer and science labs. Under the Aquatic Resources Development \nand Quality Improvement Project, $410,000 has been allocated to restart livelihoods through \ndevelopment of inland fisheries in reservoirs in Northern Province.15 Rehabilitation activities \nhave been further strengthened with provision of supplementary finance of $12.8 million from \nloan savings and cancellation to the NECORD II project. In addition, further loan savings and \ncancellations of around $13 million is expected to be used to provide a supplementary loan to \n                                                 \n9  JICA is processing a skills training program for frontline officers in Northern and Eastern provinces to undertake \ncommunity development. The project is at a formulation stage and is expected to start in mid 2010. The \nimplementation period is expected to be 3 years. \n10  The Food and Agriculture Organization is providing immediate livelihood assistance such as provision of seeds, \nfarm equipment, garden tools, and fertilizers. It has also assisted in rice and paddy plantation on more than 4,000 \nhectares of land. \n11 Livelihood provision was through an Australian Agency for International Development grant of A$8 million. \n12 ADB. 2003.

Impact and Outcomes \n8.  The project's main impact will be to reduce poverty and help meet basic needs by \nimproving  the  living  conditions  and  sustainable  livelihood  prospects  of  the  war-affected \npopulation in Northern Province, Eastern Province, and some adjoining villages in North Central \nProvince. Rehabilitation and reconstruction of essential infrastructure by this and other projects \nwill make private investment viable and result in accelerated economic growth and therefore \nincrease employment opportunities. Along with improved service delivery and rapid economic \ngrowth, the incidence of poverty in the region is expected to fall from 37% in 2010 to 15% in \n2020. Significant employment opportunities will also be created by the project itself. \n \n9.  Several  key  outcomes  will  emerge  from  the  project.  Reestablishing  connectivity  by \nrepairing damaged roads in the municipal areas, provincial roads, and some national roads will \nimprove access to basic services and enable marketing and trade to resume, one of the keys to \nthe reestablishment of livelihood. It will also reduce travel times by about 30% and reduce \nvehicle operating costs by 20%. With better connectivity, private sector investment will be \nattracted to the region. \n \n10.  Basic utilities such as drinking water and electricity are grossly inadequate in the region \ndue to a long period of underinvestment because of the prevailing conflict situation and poor \nmaintenance of existing structures. The proportion of the population covered by piped water \nvaries between 2% and 20% in different districts of the north. The project will provide improved \naccess to power to about 750,000 people in Northern Province, and about 35,000 people will \ngain access to safe drinking water in Northern and Eastern provinces. Sustainable and gainful \nmeans of employment requires that small and medium-sized irrigation works are rehabilitated so \nthat agricultural activities can be revived. By investing in such irrigation schemes, the project will \nenable 6,000 families to restart cultivation on about 6,500 hectares of land. The rebuilding and \nrehabilitation of three vocational training institutes, and providing them with related facilities, will \nhelp to meet the critical skills shortages, generating nonfarm employment for about 1,200 \npeople  per  annum.  Prolonged  conflict  has  also  severely  affected  the  functioning  and \neffectiveness of the governance structure, including public administration and judicial services. \nThe  administrative  structure  has  been  weakened  due  to  the  war  and  damaged  buildings. \nRepairing them will allow effective service delivery to be restored. Prolonged conflict has also \nhampered the effective functioning of institutions responsible for civil and judicial administration \nin Northern Province. Having a fully operational governance system is essential to support early \nrecovery efforts and sustain rehabilitation and rebuilding initiatives. This component of the \nproject will provide about 1 million people with access to essential legal services. \n \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2002.

Manila (Loan 1993-SRI[SF]). \n17 Muttur is in the Trincomalee district in Eastern Province. The area is largely populated by IDPs from Eastern \nProvince, serving a population of 55,000 people. ", "      5\nC.  Outputs \n11.  The outputs of the project are summarized below while the project component analysis \nprovides more details.18  \n \n1.  Component A: Reestablishing Connectivity \n12.  This component will rehabilitate (i) 65 kilometers (km) of national roads (B category) in \nNorthern  Province,  (ii)  100  km  of  provincial  roads  in  Kilinochchi,  Mannar,  Mullaitivu  and \nVavuniya districts,19 and (iii) 100 km of municipal and urban council roads in Northern Province \nand rural roads in the adjoining villages of North Central Province. Rehabilitation of these roads \nwill increase connectivity for the returning IDPs, facilitating the provision of basic services and \nlivelihood recovery and encourage increased investment. Local and provincial council roads \nserve communities located away from the centers of economic activity which have high poverty \nincidence and lack economic opportunities. This component will focus on some critical sections \nof the road network that will complement the work supported by other development partners as \nwell as future planned work, including work by ADB.  \n \n2.  Component B: Restoring Utilities \n13.  Most of the electricity infrastructure was destroyed during the conflict, and the remaining \ninfrastructure  has  deteriorated  due  to  lack  of  maintenance.  The  project  will  support  the \nreconstruction of the Chunnakam grid station and the Kilinochchi\u2013Chunnakam transmission line. \nThis will provide the essential link to Jaffna, as JICA is supporting the reconstruction of the \ndamaged transmission line from Vavuniya to Kilinochchi.  \n \n14.   The  water  supply  subcomponent  will  support  the  water  supply  schemes  at \nEchchalampattu in Trincomalee district and Point Pedro in Jaffna district. These schemes are \ndesigned to meet the needs of resettled IDPs. The population relies mainly on dug and tube \nwells for their water needs; this water is not always fit for consumption, nor the wells easy to \nuse. Moreover, development activities that will take place in the area in the near future will \ncreate greater demand for water supply facilities.  \n \n3.  Component C: Improving Basic Social Services \n15.  This  component  will  restore  some  essential  basic  social  services  and  livelihood \nopportunities  of  the  population  by  (i) restoring  about  10  small  and  medium-sized  irrigation \nschemes as agriculture is the main source of livelihood;20 (ii) rebuilding 10 administrative offices \nand  providing  related  facilities;  and  (iii) rehabilitating  and  reconstructing  district  vocational \ntraining centers in Kilinochchi, Mannar, and Mullaitivu. \n \n16.  Agriculture is the key economic activity for a majority of the population in Northern \nProvince. The province is in the dry zone, and rains from the northwest monsoon are limited and \nirregular. The cropping intensity in the province remains low as a majority of tanks and canals \nare dilapidated due to limited or no investment since the early 1980s. ADB is also exploring the \n                                                 \n18 Project Component Analysis (Appendix 2). \n19 Rehabilitation of provincial roads in the Jaffna district is being undertaken by the World Bank under the Provincial \nRoads Project. \n20 Restoration and improvement of irrigation schemes is also being undertaken by the World Bank in its Emergency \nNorthern Recovery Project and its ongoing Reawakening Project. ADB has confined its operation to 10 high-impact \nsmall and medium-sized irrigation schemes. \n ", " 6 \npossibility of a grant project which will complement components A and C by rehabilitating 200 \nkm  of  field  irrigation  canals  and  about  150  km  of  rural  access  roads  with  extensive  IDP \nparticipation. \n \n17.  Most of the district and divisional administration buildings in Northern Province have \nbeen damaged; in Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu, almost all district and divisional secretariats and \nlocal authority buildings have been destroyed. However, some offices are being repaired under \nthe 180-day program. These institutions have also lost most of the office furniture, equipment, \nmachinery, and vehicles. \n \n18.  There are 16 technical education and vocational training centers in Northern Province, \nsome of which have been closed due to the conflict. The youth in the province have not \nacquired new skills; hence their employment prospects are low. Repair and refurbishment of the \nvocational training centers is essential for the development of the war-affected region in the \nshort-to-medium term.   \n \n4.  Component D: Legal Infrastructure \n19.  This component will rehabilitate courthouses and related facilities in up to nine strategic \nlocations in Northern Province.21 The prolonged conflict has prevented institutions responsible \nfor civil and judicial administration in Northern Province from functioning effectively. With the \nend of the conflict, rehabilitation and reconstruction of the judicial infrastructure is urgently \nneeded, as its absence is negatively impacting the perceived personal and communal security \nof the war-affected communities and IDPs. Judicial officers have already been appointed and at \npresent most of the court proceedings take place under extremely difficult conditions in partially \ndamaged buildings.  \n \n20.  The project's support for reconstruction of physical legal infrastructure will be provided in \ncoordination  with  UNDP,  which  is  implementing  its  Access  to  Justice  Project.  A  letter  of \nunderstanding was signed with UNDP in March 2010 so that the two activities complement each \nother to ensure comprehensive development of the justice sector.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n21.  The project investment plan is estimated at $168 million, including taxes and duties of \n$18 million to be financed by the government.

The government has requested an emergency loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the project. In accordance with ADB's Disaster and Emergency \nPolicy (2004), the loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offer rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and other such terms and conditions \nset forth in the loan and project agreements. The government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility based on these \nterms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The government \nwill  make  available  the  loan  proceeds  to  the  implementing  agencies  through  budgetary \nallocations, except to Ceylon Electricity Board and National Water Supply and Drainage Board, \nto whom the respective portions of the loan proceeds will be on lent on terms and conditions \nsatisfactory to ADB.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \n89.00 \nAsian Development Bank  150.00   \n18.24  11.00 \nGovernment of Sri Lanka   \nTotal  168.24    100.00 \n \nE.

The government has agreed to \nexpedite approval from the Department of Management Services for recruiting additional staff.  \n \n25.  A  national  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  the  MNBEID,  will  meet \nmonthly for the first 6 months, and bimonthly after that. The committee will provide guidance to \nthe implementing agencies on policy aspects and review the overall progress of the project. The \ncommittee will also liaise with the presidential task force for policy guidance. The provincial \nproject coordination committees, chaired by the chief secretary of the Northern Province or \nNorth Central Province respectively and with representatives from the line agencies of the \nprovinces as members, will review and approve the projects identified and proposed by the line \nagencies and departments of the provinces. This will be relevant for the provincial roads, urban \nand local roads, irrigation schemes, administrative infrastructure, and training centers. \n \n26.  The government has requested ADB's approval of advance action for recruitment of \nconsultants and procurement of goods and civil works, including inviting and receiving bids for \ncontracts for projects that might be approved for implementation prior to loan effectiveness, \nprovided the advance actions take place on or after 1 December 2009, the concluding date of \nproject's initial fact-finding. The government has been advised that ADB's approval of advance \naction does not commit ADB to finance any part of this project.   \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n \nAspect  Arrangements \nImplementation period  3 years \nEstimated project completion date  30 June 2013 \nProject management   \n(i)  Oversight body   \u2212 National Steering Committee \n  \u2212 Secretary, MNBEID (chair)  \n\u2212 Representatives from the Ministry of Finance and Planning (External \nResource and National Planning departments), implementing agencies, \nand chief secretaries of Northern and North Central provinces (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  MNBEID  \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies   \n(a)  Component A (reestablishing  \u2212 Northern Provincial Council through the Provincial Road Development \nconnectivity) will be  Department using the project management unit of the proposed Northern \nimplemented by three  Connectivity Road Project  \nimplementing agencies  \u2212 North Central Provincial Council through the Roads Development \nAuthority using the project management unit of the ongoing Eastern and \nNorth Central Provincial Road Project \n\u2212 The Ministry of Highways and Roads Development through the Roads \nDevelopment Authority using the project management unit of the proposed \nNorthern Connectivity Road Project \n(b)  Component B (restoring  \u2212 Power component by the Ministry of Power and Energy through the \nutilities)  Ceylon Electricity Board \n\u2212 Water supply component by the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage \nthrough the project management unit of the ongoing Secondary Towns \nand Rural Community Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project, under \nthe National Water Supply and Drainage Board \n(c)  Component C (improving  \u2212 Irrigation schemes by the Northern and North Central provincial councils ", "      9\nAspect  Arrangements \nbasic social services)  through their provincial irrigation departments \n\u2212 Administrative infrastructure by the Ministry of Public Administration and \nHome Affairs \n\u2212 Vocational training centers by Ministry of Vocational Training and \nTechnical Education through Vocational Training Authority \n\u2212 All three agencies will create dedicated project implementation units \n(d)  Component D (legal  Ministry of Justice and Law Reforms  \ninfrastructure) \n(iv)  Project implementation unit   Located at MNBEID (nine core staff) \nProcurement   International  5 contracts  $57.1 million \n  competitive bidding   \n  National competitive  27 contracts  $33.4 million \nbidding \nShopping  Multiple contracts   $40.3 million \nConsulting services   Quality- and cost-based  1,258 person-months (48  $5.0 million \n  selection  international, 1,210 \nnational)  \nIndividual consultants   Depending upon  $1.4 million \nrequirement \nRetroactive financing and/or advance  Both requested  \ncontracting   Explained in para. 26 and 27 \nDisbursement   Direct payment   Minimum value of $100,000 per application \n  Reimbursement   Statement of expenditure ceiling of $100,000 for \n  each payment \nImprest account   Lower of 10% of loan amount (of each \n - Imprest advance  component) or ADB's share of eligible project \n - Replenishment  expenditures to be financed through the imprest \n - Commitment letter  account for the next 6 months.

Project implementation will be completed by 30 June 2013, and loan closing will be 30 \nSeptember 2013.24  \n \n29.  Potential  for  cofinancing. Bilateral development partners are considering providing \nadditional support in Northern and Eastern provinces to help returning IDPs meet their basic \nneeds  and  reestablish  their  livelihood.  Some  development  partners  may  be  willing  to \ncomplement ADB funds for this project through cofinancing. ADB has typically sought Board \napproval for the administration of loan or grant funds from cofinanciers only when cofinancing \ncommitments are in place. In light of the need for expediency and efficiency in ADB's response \nto  post-conflict  recovery  and  rehabilitation,  Management  requests  Board  approval  of  the \nadministration of any cofinanced funds obtained from development partners subsequent to the \ndate of Board approval, consistent with the objective, purpose or scope of the project. Approval \nof such cofinanced funds will be confirmed and approved by Management, and reported to the \nBoard in accordance with standard reporting procedures. \n \n                                                 \n24  The project administration manual describes the implementation arrangements in more detail (Appendix 2). \n ", " 10 \nF.  Project Selection Criteria \n30.  In choosing the project components, discussions were held with provincial, local, and \nnational government officials and administrative staff, most of whom were directly responsible \nfor delivering essential services to IDPs. With the process of resettlement of IDPs still ongoing \nand de-mining activities also in progress in many areas, the IDPs (the intended beneficiaries) \ncould  not  be  consulted.  During  implementation,  discussions  will  be  held  with  the  IDPs, \ncommunity-based  organizations,  nongovernment  organizations,  user  groups  (e.g.,  farmer \norganizations), and local political leaders to ensure ownership and maximize project benefits. \nThis will be particularly relevant to components relating to local, municipal, and provincial roads; \nirrigation works; administrative structures; and legal facilities.  \n \n31.  Projects will be selected to ensure equitable distribution of rehabilitation works across \nthe entire Northern Province, taking into account geographic and sector balance along with \nethnic  composition.  Project  selection  will  incorporate  conflict-sensitivity  guidelines.25 Where \nnecessary for project selection, people in target villages will be consulted in a gender-sensitive \nway, and also encouraged to participate in construction work as wage labor. During project \nimplementation, contractors will ensure that there is wage parity for male and female labor. \nLessons from emergency loans such as the NECORD,26 Conflict-Affected Area Rehabilitation \nProject,27 and Tsunami-Affected Area Rehabilitation Project28 have been incorporated in the \ndesign. The government and ADB have agreed on the following project selection and criteria: \n(i) de-mining is completed and safe access is assured by the government to the IDPs and \nproject  staff;  (ii)  the  targeted  beneficiaries  have  either  returned  to the  project area  or  the \ngovernment provides a plan to resettle the IDPs in the area; (iii) there is balance of activities \nbetween districts and communities; and (iv) projects can be completed within the loan period.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n32.  Since this project has been processed as an emergency intervention, in accordance with \nthe Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004), financial and economic rates have not \nbeen calculated for the different components except for the power sector. In choosing the \nproject design, emphasis will be on least-cost solutions without being prejudicial to quality \nassurance in rehabilitation or reconstruction work. In the power sector component, the economic \ninternal rate of return is estimated at 24.4%.29 \n \nB.  Governance \n33.  The implementing agencies comprise both central and provincial agencies, with the \nprovincial  agencies  operating  in  a  devolved  governance  structure  introduced  by  the  13th \n                                                 \n25  Criteria, Identification and Selection of Projects (Appendix 2). \n26 ADB. 2005.

The use of provincial authorities as implementing agencies for \nproject  components  under  provincial  council  administration  will  enhance  their  project \nmanagement capacity and strengthen devolution. The project coordinating committee structure \nwill facilitate stakeholder inputs at the provincial level in the prioritization and design of projects. \nAll implementing agencies have experience in implementing projects of similar nature with \nexternal funding. \n \n34.  The public financial management system of Sri Lanka revolves around the Ministry of \nFinance and Planning, with key departments such as Budget, Treasury Operations, External \nResources,  and  Planning.  Budgetary  allocations  for  provincial  councils  are  made  on  the \nrecommendations of the Finance Commission, a constitutionally created independent body. In \nthis project, as the funds are for immediate reconstruction activities, funds will be channeled \nthrough  the  MNBEID.  The  supervisory  role  of  the  PCQAU  will  enhance  the  integrity  of \nprocurement and flow of funds along with procedural safeguards in the Treasury Operations \nDepartment. Executing and implementing agencies are subject to regular independent audits by \nthe auditor general whose report is tabled in Parliament and is subject to wide and public \ndiscussion  by  the  two  parliamentary  oversight  committees.  The  auditor  general  audits \ncompliance  with  procurement  guidelines  and  financial  regulations.  ADB  has  requested  the \nAuditor General for a separate audit opinion on compliance with financial covenants in its \nprojects. Project procurement will be subject to ADB's Procurement Guidelines.  \n \n35.  The  Bribery  Act  No.  11  of  1954  (as  amended),  and  the  Declaration  of  Asset  and \nLiabilities Act No. 1 of 1975, are the principle legislative instruments dealing with anticorruption. \nThis  framework  is  applicable  to  public  officers.  As  key  project  staff  in  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies are existing public officials, this framework will provide a strong legal \nbasis to deal with bribery and corruption. Use of open competitive bidding, transparency in the \nselection of projects, and the oversight role of ADB will ensure integrity in procurement and \nimplementation activities. The executing agency will maintain a project website that will be \nupdated regularly and will include (at a minimum) (i) bidding procedures, bidders, and contract \nawards; (ii) use of the funds disbursed under the project; and (iii) physical progress. ADB's \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with \ngovernment and the executing agency. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n36.  The conflict has severely affected the communities in these areas. Loss of life, access to \nbasic  social  services,  livelihoods,  incomes,  and  property  has  resulted  in  significant \nsocioeconomic and psychological stress. Essential investments have not been made for a long \ntime. One of the key issues identified in the country partnership strategy for Sri Lanka is that \nreduction of poverty is closely linked to infrastructure development. 30 The project will reestablish \nvital services such as roads, irrigation infrastructure, power, water supply, and public and legal \nservices to revive economic activities leading to employment, income generation, rehabilitation \nof  displaced  persons,  and  restoration  of  social  stability  in  these  areas.  The  return  and \nresettlement of IDPs in their original villages will require the provision of basic infrastructure and \nservices to enable them to reestablish their homes and restart livelihood activities, especially in \nthe traditional sectors of agriculture and fishing. \n \n                                                 \n30 ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: Sri Lanka, 2009 \u20132011. Manila. \n ", " 12 \n37.  Due to decades of conflict, the burdens on women to manage, care, and provide for the \nfamily have drastically increased and their roles and responsibilities have changed with the \ndeath, disappearance, or migration of male family members. The beneficiaries of the project will \nbe people affected by the conflict, which includes IDPs, host communities (those who did not \nmove from the residences due to conflict), and the poor. War widows, households headed by \nwomen, and single women with elderly and war-disabled family members will require special \nsupport to assist them in resettlement with housing, water supply and sanitation, and power \nfacilities, and reestablishment of livelihood-related activities for economic survival. 31 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n38.  This project is not expected to require land acquisition or resettlement, as reconstruction \nwill occur at original sites or along existing corridors. However, since exact locations of projects \nhave not been identified at this stage, resettlement impacts of a specific project of the loan will \nonly be known during project implementation, and as a result the resettlement plans will be \nprepared, if necessary, in accordance with the resettlement framework in the course of project \nimplementation. No project component or project with potential involuntary resettlement impacts \nwill be implemented until an appropriate resettlement planning instrument to address such \nimpacts is formulated, approved by ADB and respective authorities in the government, and \nimplemented following the guidelines given in the resettlement framework.32 The resettlement \nframework sets out the policy and procedures for screening project components and projects to \nidentify resettlement impacts, if any, and to guide the executing and implementing agencies on \nhow to prepare resettlement plans to address such impacts adequately and to implement them \neffectively.  \n \n39.  From an environmental standpoint, the project is classified category B as it is unlikely \nthat any proposed projects will lead to any adverse irreversible impacts. Initial environmental \nexaminations will be conducted for the transmission line and grid substation, roads, and water \nsupply components. Contracts for these components will be awarded only after approval of \ninitial  environmental  examinations  and  environmental  management  plans  by  ADB  and  the \ngovernment (if required), and the plans will form part of the contract documents. All other \nprojects  will  follow  environmental  assessment  procedures  stipulated  in  the  environmental \nassessment framework. The framework has been developed to ensure compliance with ADB's \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009).33 \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n40.  Major risks are (i) tensions arising from beneficiaries due to perceived inequities in \ndistribution of project benefits and/or dispute over land, (ii) dominance of outside contractors \nand labor in project civil works, (iii) delay in clearing land mines leading to delay in project \nimplementation, (iv) inadequate institutional capacity among national and provincial agencies \nand  local  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based  organizations,  and  (v) \ninadequate coordination among development partners. The government and ADB are actively \nengaged in implementing measures to mitigate these risks. The project design incorporates \nfeatures to mitigate some of these risks, such as adopting the conflict-sensitivity guidelines and \nencouraging the use of local labor through the bidding documents. Training will also be provided \nto local contractors on ADB's policies and procedures. The Government, in collaboration with \n                                                 \n31  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n32  Involuntary Resettlement Assessment and Measures (Appendix 2). \n33  Environmental Assessment and Measures (Appendix 2). ", "      13\nbilateral development partners, is making good progress in clearing mines but the completion \nwill  still  take  time  given  the  need  to  proceed  carefully. To  overcome  capacity  constraints, \nadditional technical staff and consulting services, as required, will be recruited by the executing \nand the implementing agencies. The executing agency, which has a lead role in many of the \nprograms in Northern Province, including the World Bank's Emergency Northern Recovery \nProject and ADB's NECORD II, is also taking an increasingly proactive role together with the \npresidential task force in coordinating with development partners. ADB is closely coordinating \nwith development partners to ensure that assistance to the war-affected area is complementary \nand there are no overlaps. The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs \nof these risks.34 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n41.  The government and the MNBEID have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n42.  The government and the MNBEID have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n43.
