The  overall  project  will  also  help  improve  the  livelihood  of  project-\naffected  people  and  reduce  the  prevalence  of  HIV  in  Lae  and  surrounding  localities.  This  involves \nfinancing (i) construction of port facilities including a tidal basin, a multipurpose berth, and terminal \nworks; (ii) resettlement and livelihood improvement and social improvement for affected people; (iii) \nconsulting  services  for  project  management,  construction  supervision,  financial  management, \nresettlement,  and  socioeconomic  monitoring;  and  (iv)  gender-responsive  programs  for  HIV \nawareness  and  prevention.  Current  project  implementation  preconstruction  activities  are  mostly \ncomplete, including the relocation of 3,200 people from the project site.2 \n \n3. \nAs  a  result  of  input  price  increases,  the  devaluation  of  the  US  dollar  against  the  kina,  and \ndesign modifications, the total current project cost has increased from $154.0 million at appraisal in \n2007  to  $291.4  million  in  2011.  The  current  project  rationale  is  valid  and  remains  applicable.  The \ncurrent  project  scope  has  been  revised  to  include  some  improvements  to  construction  solutions. \nAdditional financing is requested for 65% of the total overall project cost increase, the balance to be \nprovided from government resources. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n1. \n\nDevelopment Need \n\n4. \nLae  port  is  PNG\u2019s  largest,  busiest,  and  most  important  port.  It  is  a  gateway  linking  world \nmarkets  with  PNG  and  a  large  hinterland  containing  40%  of  PNG\u2019s  population  and  half  of  PNG\u2019s \neconomic  capacity,  including  hydrocarbon  and mineral  resources.  Lae port\u2019s  cargo throughput  has \nincreased by 7.8% annually since 2006. In 2011, the cargo through Lae port is estimated to reach \n3.3  million  revenue  tons,  stretching  the  port  to  the  limit  of  its  capacity.  PNG  Ports  Corporation \nLimited  (PPCL)  is  increasing  the  operational  efficiency  of  Lae  port,  which  will  help  cope  with  the \nexisting cargo traffic. However, the need for additional berth space is now critical. A larger and more \nefficient Lae port will ease a nationally significant infrastructure bottleneck that is impeding economic \ngrowth. The overall project is a high priority of the Government of PNG.3 \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Current Project \n\n5. \nThe overall project will expand the capacity of Lae port by building a tidal basin (700 x 400 \nmeters [m]) northwest of the present port facilities with a dredged depth of 13 m below sea level, a \nmultipurpose  berth  (240  m  long  and  45\u201350  m  wide),  and  terminal  works  including  all  buildings, \nstorage areas, roads, drainage, water, electricity, and sewerage services. The tidal basin and berth \nare  designed  to  accommodate  vessels  with  an  overall  length  of  200  m,  beam  of  32.2  m,  and fully \nladen draft of 12 m. The procurement of these works is at an advanced stage. \n \n\n                                                \n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on \nProposed Loans, Administration of a Loan from the OPEC Fund for International Development, and Administration of a \nGrant from the Cooperation Fund for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific to Papua New Guinea for the Lae Port \nDevelopment  Project.  Manila  (Loan  nos.  2398-PNG  and  2399-PNG)  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  supplementary \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n2  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Update of the Port Sector Analysis (accessible from the list of linked supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n6.  \nThe  overall  project  involves  the  relocation  and  livelihood  and  social  improvement  of  about \n3,200 people living on the project site. The government has financed and completed the relocation, \nand  a  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction 4  grant  is  now  financing  the  livelihood  and  social \nimprovement program (footnote 1). To minimize the potential risk of new HIV infections, the overall \nproject includes support for an effective and sustainable response to the HIV epidemic in and around \nLae  port  and  Morobe  province.  The  Lae  Chamber  of  Commerce  is  the  implementing  agency  and \nactivities  include  (i)  developing  an  HIV  and  AIDS  code  of  conduct  for  businesses;  (ii)  improving \nseafarers\u2019 \n(iv)  strengthening \nnongovernment organizations, AIDS site committees, and the Lae police; and (v) caring for people \nwith HIV.5 \n\n(iii)  strengthening  clinical \n\ninstitutional  structures; \n\nfacilities; \n\n \n3. \n\nAdditional Financing Required and Eligibility \n\nAdditional  financing:  The  required  additional  financing  results  from  cost  overruns  (input \n7. \nprice increases and US dollar depreciation) and from design modifications to the current project. The \ntotal  cost  of  the  overall  project  has  increased  by  $137.4  million,  from  $154.0  million  in  2007  to \n$291.4  million  in  2010  (89%).  The  increase  comprises  $124.44  million  relating  to  civil  and  other \nworks, $9.33 million for contingencies, and $3.63 million for financial charges. The cost of civil  and \nrelated works has increased from $109.4 million in 2007 to $233.7 million in 2010. The 2010 costs \nhave  been  confirmed  by  the  four  conforming  tender  bids  received  and  evaluated  by  the  project \nexecuting  agency,  the  Independent  Public  Business  Corporation  (IPBC).  The  cost  increases \nexcluding  contingencies and financial  charges result from  several factors,  as summarized  in Table \n1.6 \n\nTable 1: Cost Increase Factors \n($ million) \n\nFactors \nInput price increasesa \nUS dollar depreciationb \nDesign modifications \n \na  Design items included in the 2007 RRP. \nb  Depreciation of US dollar against  kina: $1 = K2.797 in the 2007 report and recommendation of the  President \n\nAmount \n62.46 \n38.17 \n23.81 \n124.44 \n\nPercent \n50.00 \n31.00 \n19.00 \n100.00 \n\nTotal \n\ncompared with $1 = K2.299 as of 30 June 2011. \n\nSources: Government of Papua New Guinea and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nInput price increases. Since project appraisal in 2007, historically unprecedented economic \n8. \ndevelopments  in  PNG  as  well  as  extreme  economic  fluctuations  globally  have  combined  to  inflate \nthe  US  dollar  costs  of  port facility  construction.  Cost  inflation  during the  3  years  of preconstruction \nproject implementation raised the cost of the current project as designed in 2007 by $62.46 million. \nPrice  increases  relate  to  inputs  such  as  structural  steel  and  concrete  and  non-imported  items \nincluding  labor,  materials,  and  energy  (footnote  6).  The  current  project  implementation  delay  was \ndue to relocation  negotiations  with people living  on  the  project  site  (para.  17). The  time needed  to \nreach agreement and execute the relocation plan coincided with a period of unusual growth and cost \nescalation in PNG. \n \n9. \nThe  buoyant  PNG  economy,  which  grew  at  an  average  rate  of  7%  from  2007  to  2010  is \nfacing  severe  supply-side  constraints  that  are  inflating  prices  across  the  economy.  Cumulative \ninflation  in PNG  between  the  end  of  2007  and  the  end  of  2010  is  officially  estimated  to  be  around \n25%  but  it  is  widely  recognized  that  official  consumer  price  index  data  significantly  underestimate \n\n                                                \n4  ADB.  2007.

Manila (Grant 9113-PNG) (accessible from the list of linked supplementary \ndocuments in Appendix 2).  \n\n5  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  Revised Project Cost Estimates (accessible from the list of linked supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f3 \n\n \nactual  inflation.7 Inflationary  pressures  have  been particularly  acute  in  the construction  sector,  with \nofficial figures showing that construction prices grew by 35% between the end of 2007 and the end \nof 2010.8 \n  \n10. \nCapacity constraints in the construction sector result largely from the ongoing construction of \na  $15  billion  liquefied  natural  gas  project  and  its  spillover  effects  across  the  economy.  The  sector \nhas  shown  limited  capacity  to  expand  in  response  to  the  massive  increases  in  demand  resulting \nfrom port congestion, regulatory impediments, and perceptions that PNG offers a high-risk operating \nenvironment  because of  the  country\u2019s  poor  law  and order situation.  Employers  report shortages  of \nskilled  labor,  and  port  and  construction  companies  are  operating  at  close  to  full  capacity.  In \nparticular, strong demand for the limited supply of contractors in PNG is leading to rising contractor \nrates  for  engineering,  construction,  and  transport  services.  These  effects  are  particularly  strong  in \nthe Lae area through which most supplies of construction material, equipment, and processing pass \nto  the  gas  extraction  plant  and  pipeline.  The  official  consumer  price  index  in  the  Lae  urban  area \ngrew by 33% between the end of 2007 and the end of 2010, well above the national average.9 \n \n11. \nUS  dollar  depreciation.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  global  economic  crisis,  the  US  dollar  has \ndepreciated against other currencies. It devalued 17.8% against the kina between the beginning of \n2007  and  the  end  of  2010.10 This  depreciation  has  increased  the  overall  project  cost  by  $38.17 \nmillion.  \n\nDesign modifications. Modifications to the current project design relate to (i) site clearance \n12. \nand site investigations, (ii) wharf structures, (iii) slope protection, and (iv) the diversion of Mai Creek. \nAppraisal  cost  estimates  were  based  on  preliminary  engineering  designs.  IPBC  was  diligent  and \nprudent  in  requiring  additional  geotechnical  surveys  to  guide  detailed  engineering  and  design. \nDesign changes respond to this additional information and exploit other opportunities to improve the \ntechnical quality of construction solutions.11  \n \n13. \nEligibility  for  additional  financing.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  may  provide \nadditional  financing  to  projects  that  (i)  remain  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and \nfinancially  sound;  (ii)  are  accorded  high  priority  by  the  government;  (iii)  are  consistent  with  the \ncurrent project\u2019s development objectives; and (iv) are consistent with the current country partnership \nstrategy. 12  These  eligibility  criteria  are  met  for  the  proposed  additional  financing.  The  current \nproject\u2019s technical feasibility has been strengthened and higher-than-original economic and financial \nreturns are expected. The government has confirmed that the overall project is a nationally important \nstrategic  investment  and  the  current  project\u2019s  development  objectives  are  unchanged.  The  PNG \ncountry partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 confirms sea transport infrastructure as a strategic priority \nfor ADB.13 \n \n14. \nThe Lae Port Development Project meets the eligibility conditions for additional financing for \ncost  overruns  because  of  (i)  specific  input  price  increases  or  overall  inflation,  (ii)  exchange  rate \n                                                \n7  International Monetary Fund. 2011.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \nfluctuations, (iii) underestimated costs, and (iv) delays. The current project also meets the eligibility \nconditions for additional financing resulting from project modifications: (i) the changes are needed to \naccommodate  changed  (engineering  design)  implementation  conditions  and  to  respond  to \ninnovations;  and  (ii)  the  changes  are  consistent  with  government  priorities,  the  development \nobjectives of the current project, and the country partnership strategy. \n \n15. \nThe current project has addressed all design and most implementation problems, and it has \nbeen  performing  well  for  most  of  the  past  12  months.  The  cost  overruns  result  primarily  from  a  2-\nyear implementation delay caused by the need for complex relocation negotiations with people living \non the current project site.14 IPBC, the Morobe Provincial Government, and ADB worked closely to \nachieve  a  successful  outcome,  but  the  time  needed  to  agree  and  execute  the  relocation  plan  was \nunderestimated at appraisal. \n \nAlthough  the  current  project  has  been  delayed,  it meets four  out  of six  of the standards for \n16. \nadditional  financing  for  a  project  not  performing  well:  (i)  the  overall  project  will  likely  deliver  its \nexpected outputs; (ii) implementation progress has been satisfactory in the last 12 months, though \ncontract  awards  and  disbursements  were  delayed;  (iii)  compliance  with  safeguard  policy \nrequirements  is  satisfactory;  and  (iv)  risks  have  been  managed  successfully.  With  the  successful \nrelocation of affected people off the project site, no further significant implementation problems are \nforeseen.  The  current  project  is  rated  actual  problem  in  the  project  performance  report,  but  this  is \nonly due to contract awards and disbursements being significantly behind schedule because of the \nimplementation  delay  caused  by  the  relocation  negotiations.  The  rating  results  from  the  delayed \naward  of  the  port facilities civil  works  contract, which is  the  single principal  contract for the  overall \nproject. The contract was successfully tendered in May 2011 and is expected to be awarded either \nin late 2011 or early 2012, at which point the current project is expected to be rated on track. \n \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Progress \n\n17. \nProgress. Preconstruction activities are mostly complete, including detailed engineering and \ndesign  and  the  revision  of  engineers\u2019  cost  estimates.  The  construction  supervision  consultant \ncontract has been awarded, the civil works contract has been successfully tendered, and ADB has \nissued  no  objection  for  the  contract  award.  The  project  site  is  cleared  and  contractors  can  be \nmobilized  immediately  after  the  contract  is  signed.  Affected  people  are  receiving  livelihood  and \nsocial improvement support, and many businesses and communities in Lae are participating in the \ngender-responsive HIV awareness and prevention program (footnote 5). \n \n18. \nLessons  learned. The lesson learned is that project implementation schedules for complex \nprojects need to be conservative. Additionally, price contingencies in a natural resource-driven high-\ngrowth  situation  should  be  generous.  Ideally  for  port  facilities  projects,  all  necessary  geotechnical \nsurveys and detailed engineering and design should be completed during project preparation. \n \nPolicy dialogue. The current project is underpinned by strong policy dialogue between ADB \n19. \nand  the  government.  The  dialogue  has  continued  during  implementation  and  focuses  on  (i) \nresettlement  plan  arrangements  and  ongoing  monitoring;  (ii)  IPBC  responsibilities  and  project \nmanagement arrangements and capacity building; (iii) PPCL tariff and revenue generation, including \nIndependent  Consumer  and  Competition \nannual \nCommission; and (iv) public\u2013private partnership (PPP) opportunities for future port development and \noperation.15 ADB  completed  a  preliminary  assessment  of  Lae  port  PPP  potential,  which  is  being \nused by IPBC to prepare a time-bound PPP strategy and action plan. \n                                                \n14 Summary of Project Performance and Revised  Project Cost Estimates (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nthe  regulator, \n\ntariff  reviews \n\nthrough \n\nthe \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n15 ADB helped the government prepare a national PPP policy, which was approved by the cabinet in December 2009. The \nnext phase of ADB support has helped produce a PPP bill and regulations, which are likely to be tabled in Parliament in \nNovember 2011 or early 2012. \n\n\f5 \n\n5. \n\nSafeguard Compliance \n\n20. \nActivities  under  the  resettlement  plan  prepared  for  the  original  loan  have  been  mostly \ncompleted  and  the  livelihood  support  programs  and  resettlement  monitoring  are  in  progress. \nRelocation from the project site of a canoe landing site and fish market for a local clan, the Labu, will \nbe completed before the start of port facility civil works. \n \n21. \nThe  current  project  was  categorized  environmental  category  A  and  a  full  environmental \nimpact  assessment  of  the  current  project  was  carried  out  under  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance.  The  environmental  impact  assessment  and  environmental  management  plan  were \nposted on the ADB website in compliance with the disclosure requirements of ADB\u2019s Environmental \nPolicy (2002). \n \n\n6. \n\nManagement of Risks \n\n22. \nResettlement was considered the greatest risk to the current project and IPBC has managed \nthis  risk  effectively.  To  date,  contract  packages  and  procurement  methods  have  been  properly \ndefined  and  closely  followed  to  ensure  that  capable,  reputable,  and  reliable  suppliers,  contractors, \nand nongovernment organizations are hired. \n \n23. \nThe  other  identified  major  risk  was  corruption.  Recruitment  of  consultants  and  contractors \nhas  closely  followed  ADB  recruitment  and  procurement  procedures.  To  mitigate  the  risk  of \ncorruption:  (i)  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  management  and  all  staff  have  been  trained  in \nADB\u2019s and the government\u2019s anticorruption policies, the concept of whistle-blowing, and methods of \nreducing vulnerability to corruption; (ii) IPBC will develop and maintain a project website to disclose \nthe audited project financial accounts, overall project progress, and procurement activities; (iii) direct \npayment  procedures  will  predominate;  (iv)  imprest  accounts  will  be  prudently  used  and  closely \nmonitored by ADB; (v) ADB has participated in the selection of key consultants in consultation with \nIPBC, and reviewed beforehand the bidding documents and contract awards for all international and \nnational competitive bidding contracts; and (vi) financial management is centralized in the PMU for \ninternal control. Identifying IPBC as the executing agency further mitigates the risk of corruption, as \nTransparency  International  is  represented  on  the IPBC  board  of  directors,  and IPBC  is  among the \norganizations  that  are  PNG\u2019s  most  closely  watched.  Other  overall  project  risks  pertain  to  law  and \norder,  project  management,  construction  quality,  and  HIV  prevalence.  The  overall  project  design \ntakes these potential risks into account. The government will be required to provide security during \noverall project implementation and IPBC continues to maintain a team of qualified counterpart staff \nin the PMU. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n24. \nThe  impact  and  outcome  of  the  overall  project  remain  unchanged.  The  overall  project  will \ncatalyze  industrial  and  commercial  development and promote  trade for  PNG by  relieving  a  binding \nconstraint on key port infrastructure in Lae. \n \n\nThe outputs of the current project remain unchanged, and have been partly achieved.

The  subsidiary  loan \nagreement shall be executed on the same financial and other terms and conditions as set out in the \nadditional finance loan agreements. The government will bear the foreign exchange and interest rate \nvariation risk of the additional finance loans. \n \nThe  government  is  requesting  ADB  to  finance  the  increased  overall  project  cost  for  the \n31. \nfollowing reasons: (i) the resettlement program has been successfully completed and the project site \nis  available  for  civil  works  to  commence  immediately;  (ii)  switching  funding  sources  of  the  overall \nproject  would disrupt the awarding of the port facilities civil works contract package and may result \nin significant delay in completion of the overall project; (iii) the overall project is urgent and critical for \nthe  economic  development  of  the  entire  Highlands  region  and  Morobe  province  as  a  result  of \nongoing congestion problems at the port, and the impending commencement of the liquefied natural \ngas  project  and  other  extractive  industries  projects;  (iv)  the  government  does  not  have  readily \navailable  similarly  priced  funding  that  can  accommodate  the  identified  cost  increase;  and  (v)  tidal \nbasin  and  facilities  construction  financing  under  a  PPP  arrangement  is  not  viable  because  of \nperceived construction risks.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n32. \nThere  are  no  changes  to  the  implementation  arrangements  for  the  original  loan,  which  are \nsummarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  project  administration  manual  (PAM).16 The \nPAM for existing loans (footnote 1) was confirmed by the government.  \n \n\nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body \n\nArrangements \nOctober 2008\u2013June 2014 \n30 June 2014 \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing \nagencies \n(iv) Implementation unit \nProcurement \nConsulting services \nDisbursement \n\nProject  Steering  Committee;  IPBC  managing  director  (chair);  IPBC  director,  Planning  and \nInfrastructure  Division  (secretary);  Senior  representatives  from  departments  of  National \nPlanning  and  Monitoring,  Treasury,  Justice  and  Attorney  General,  Lands  and  Physical \nIndependent  Consumer  and  Competition \nPlanning,  Environment  and  Conservation, \nCommission, Morobe Provincial Administration, and PNG Ports Corporation Limited (members) \nIndependent Public Business Corporation \nMorobe  Provincial  Administration  (JFPR-funded  component)  and  Lae  Chamber  of  Commerce \nIncorporated (for the HIV and AIDS and gender components) \nLae, 10 staff \nInternational competitive bidding \nConstruction supervision \nAll  disbursements  under  the  loans,  ADB  OCR-loan,  ADB  ADF-loan,  OFID,  and  JFPR  grant \nproceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as \namended from time to time); a copy was provided to IPBC.

The tidal basin \nand wharf will be able to berth \u201cpanamax\u201d container vessels of a maximum 50,000 deadweight tons. \nA  container  yard  of  12.7  hectares  will  be  provided  behind  the  wharf  structure.  Additional  design \nelements  include  (i)  an  administration  building,  (ii)  cargo  shed,  (iii)  navigation  aid  towers,  (iv) \nservices infrastructure and security fencing, (v) Mai Creek diversion channel, and (vi) port link road \npavement.  The  design  life  conforms  with  IPBC  requirements,  current  good  practice,  and \ninternational  codes.  The  marine  structures  will  be  designed  to  remain  fully  operational  within  the \ndesign life period. Technical aspects of the design remain largely unchanged since appraisal for the \noriginal loans and the overall project remains technically feasible. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic, Financial, and Public\u2013Private Partnership Opportunities \n\n34. \nEconomic evaluation. The 2007 forecasts for port traffic to 2030 for overseas and domestic \ncoastal  cargo  for  Lae  port  were  updated  taking  into  account  data  on  the  actual  traffic  handled  in \n2006\u20132011, which increased at an average annual rate of 7.8%, almost twice the rate assumed in \n2007. The revised cargo traffic forecasts used in the economic analysis for the additional financing \napplied the actual rate up to 2011, and after 2011 assumed an average annual cargo growth rate of \n6% (compared with 4% reducing to 3% assumed in the 2007 forecasts). The modest increase in the \nrevised  forecast  cargo  traffic  reflects  the  continuing  strong  economic  growth  in  the  Lae  port \nhinterland  and  the  multiplier  impacts  of  increased  consumption  expenditure  generated  by  new \ndevelopment projects.17 \n \n35. \nThe  2007  economic  analysis  was  updated  using  the  same  methodology  and  assumptions, \nrevising the costs and benefits in line with the latest data, and actual experience since 2007. Capital \ncosts  were  updated  to reflect  actual  expenditure  to  date  and  the  revised  design  costs  for  the  tidal \nbasin, while economic benefits were adjusted to reflect the increased cargo forecasted. \n \n36. \nAt  a 12%  discount  rate,  the  overall  project  is  economically  viable.  The  net  present  value  is \nabout  K248  million  (compared  with  K104  million  in  the  2007  report  and  recommendation  of  the \nPresident  [RRP])  and  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  18.7%  (compared  with  15.8%  in  the \n2007 RRP). The economic internal rate of return calculation was subjected to sensitivity analysis to \ntest the effects of negative changes in the key parameters that determine the benefits and costs of \nthe  overall  project.  The  sensitivity  analysis  showed  the  overall  project  to  be  economically  viable \ndespite a 20% increase in costs, a 20% decrease in benefits, or a 1-year delay in the construction \nperiod.  \n \n37. \nFinancial  evaluation.  Tariffs  for  essential  services  continue  to  be  regulated  by  a  contract \nbetween  PPCL  and  the  Independent  Consumer  and  Competition  Commission,  and  measured  in \nterms of revenue earned per revenue ton of cargo have increased at an average annual rate of 14% \nbetween 2006 and 2011 (K24.09 per revenue ton in 2011 compared with K12.55 in the 2007 RRP). \n \nThe  2007 financial  evaluation  was  updated  using the  same methodology and assumptions, \n38. \nrevising costs and revenues in line with actual experience since 2007. Capital costs were updated to \nreflect the revised design costs for the tidal basin, while revenue estimates were adjusted to reflect \nthe increased cargo forecasts and increased tariff rates. The financial analysis assumes that PPCL \nwill operate the new port facilities built under the overall project. \n \n\n                                                \n17 Updated Traffic Forecast and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\nPublic\u2013private  partnership  opportunities. \n\n \n39. \nAssuming  existing  revenue  items  remain  the  only  revenue  sources,  real  growth  in  revenue \nper cargo revenue ton continues in line with that experienced in 2006\u20132011 (5% annual real growth), \nand removing 50% of the excavation and/or dredging and reclamation costs for phase 2, the after-\ntax financial internal rate of return is 7.8% (compared with 6.8% in the 2007 RRP), which compares \nfavorably  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  5.1%  in  the  2007  RRP.  The  results  of  the \nsensitivity analyses (10% reduction in demand, 1-year delay in construction, 10% increase in project \ncosts, and 10% reduction in tariffs) confirm the robustness of the overall project\u2019s financial viability, \nalthough a 1-year delay in benefits lowers the financial internal rate of return to 3.3%.18 \n \nIn  2011,  ADB  studied  and  assessed \n40. \nopportunities for private involvement in the financing and operation of the tidal basin and facilities.19 \nThe  overall  project  was  assessed  not  to  be  financially  viable  for  whole  or  partial  private  financing \nthrough  a  PPP  model  at  this  stage  because  of  perceived  high  project  construction  risks.  It  was \nassessed that PPP potential will increase as the tidal basin phase 1 construction nears completion. \nPhase 2 construction risks will be lower and PPP/private financing may be financially viable. PPCL is \ncurrently undertaking a 20-year Lae Port Masterplan study to identify key infrastructure and service \nrequirements  to  support  future  growth.  The  Masterplan  will  be  used  to  identify  and  develop  PPP \nopportunities. \n \nC. \n \nSince  its  incorporation  in  2006,  PPCL  has  improved  corporate  governance  and  financial \n41. \nmanagement,  particularly \nfinancial  reporting.  The  project  management \narrangements  established  by  IPBC,  including  the  PMU  and  project  steering  committee,  are \nconsidered to be operating effectively and no change to those arrangements is needed as a result of \nthe additional finance. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social Safeguards \n\nin  budgeting  and \n\nGovernance \n\nlocations \n\nThe  additional  financing  does  not  include  additional  works  involving  issues  of  involuntary \n42. \nresettlement,  indigenous  peoples,  and  gender;  and  has  been  classified  category  C  for  involuntary \nresettlement,  indigenous  peoples,  and  some  gender  benefits.  All  civil  works  will  be  undertaken  in \nexisting \nthe  current  project.  Additional  safeguard \ndocumentation  on  involuntary  resettlement  is  not  required.  The  resettlement  implementation, \nmonitoring,  grievance  redress,  and  livelihood  support  programs  will  be  continued  during  overall \nproject implementation according to the resettlement plan prepared under the current project. \n \nE. \n\nidentified  or  acquired  under \n\nEnvironmental Safeguards \n\n43. \nThe  proposed  additional  finance  loan  is  classified  category  B.  The  additional  financing  will \ninclude provision of additional quarry materials to build slope protection, a small creek diversion, and \nan  access  road.  Environmental  impacts  caused  by  the  additional  financing  would  be  short-term, \nlocalized,  and  can  be  mitigated.  An  updated  draft \ninitial  environmental  examination  and \nenvironmental management plan is being finalized by IPBC and will be posted on the ADB website \nin compliance with disclosure requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n44. \nThe  current  project  risks  will  continue  to  be  managed  through  mechanisms  already \nestablished  within  IPBC  to  ensure  ADB  recruitment  and  procurement  procedures  are  closely \nfollowed,  particularly  in  relation  to  disbursement  and  audited  project  financial  accounts.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \nremaining  resettlement  risk  is  minor  and  will  continue  to  be  monitored  by  IPBC.  Other  risks \npertaining  to  law  and  order,  project  management,  construction  quality,  and  HIV  and  AIDS \nprevalence  will  continue  to  be  managed  by  IPBC  through  mechanisms  already  established.  The \ngovernment  will  provide  security  during  overall  project  implementation  and  IPBC  continues  to \nmaintain  a  team  of  qualified  counterpart  staff  in  the  PMU.  Provided  the  port  facilities  civil  works \ncontract  is  awarded  within  the  bid  validity  period,  there  is  minimal  risk  of  further  significant  cost \noverruns  although  future  contract  variations  resulting  from  unforeseen  engineering  and  other \nimplementation issues cannot be ruled out. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n45. \nThe government and IPBC have assured ADB that implementation of the overall project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in \nthe  PAM  and  the  loan  documents.  All  major  loan  covenants  under  the  original  loans  have  been \ncomplied with, except the requirement for the preparation of the time-bound action plan for PPP for \noperation of new port facilities constructed under the overall project. This will be done within 1 year \nfrom completion of the overall project.20 \n \n46. \nThe  government  and  IPBC  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  overall \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreements and project agreement.
