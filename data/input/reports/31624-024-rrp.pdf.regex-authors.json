I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Nepal for the additional financing of the Melamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP).1 \n \n2.  The MWSP supports infrastructure and institutional reforms that are critical to improving \nthe Kathmandu Valley\u2019s water supply. The Melamchi tunnel, a key component of the MWSP, is \ncritical for supplying bulk water to the Kathmandu Valley,  and its performance affects the \nprogress of several other downstream water supply and wastewater projects in the valley. The \nadditional financing, which is needed to meet cost overruns resulting from the higher amount of \nthe new contract for the Melamchi tunnel, is important to achieve the expected outcomes of the \nMWSP. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of Directors approved the MWSP on 21 \nDecember  2000,  and  the  project  became  effective  on  28  November  2001. 2  It  is  a \ncomprehensive water supply project to improve the health and wellbeing of the people in the \nKathmandu Valley. It aims to alleviate the shortage of potable water in the valley by diverting \nwater from the Melamchi River to the Kathmandu Valley.  \n \n4.  Since 2004, major events and changing circumstances in Nepal have hampered the \nimplementation of the MWSP. The government\u2019s efforts to secure private sector participation to \nmanage water services in the Kathmandu Valley were unsuccessful. During the initial years of \nthe MWSP, private sector bidders were not interested in a lease contract, supported by the \nWorld Bank, for water services delivery. When this led to significant delays in project start-up, \nthe  World  Bank  canceled  its  funding.  A  subsequent  ADB-supported  performance-based \nmanagement  contract  also failed to  attract  private  sector  interest  despite  several  years  of \nfocused efforts. The government and ADB realized that private sector engagement in Nepal\u2019s \nurban water sector was too difficult in the unpredictable sociopolitical environment of that time. \nConsequently,  the  biggest civil  works  package  under the  MWSP\u2014the  27.5 kilometer  (km) \nMelamchi tunnel\u2014was put on hold because the loan covenants included a condition that the \nperformance-based  management  contract  had  to  be  awarded  before  the  contract  for  the \nMelamchi tunnel. Furthermore, three development partners withdrew from the MWSP because \nof political developments in that period,3 leaving a funding gap of $133 million equivalent. \n \n5.  The  MWSP  experienced  additional  challenges.  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  the  Special  Project \nFacilitator, and later the Compliance Review Panel, initiated investigations in May 2004 into a \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Nepal for the Melamchi Water Supply Project. Manila. The total project cost was estimated at $464 \nmillion equivalent in 2000 prices, which was to be funded by the Government of Nepal ($118 million) and a \nconsortium of development partners: ADB ($120 million), the World Bank ($80 million), the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation ($52 million), the Japan International Cooperation Agency ($18 million), the Norwegian \nAgency for Development Cooperation ($28 million), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency \n($25 million), the Nordic Development Fund ($9 million), and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \nFund for International Development ($14 million). \n3  World  Bank in  2002,  Norwegian  Agency  for  Development  Cooperation  in 2005,  and  Swedish  International \nDevelopment Cooperation Agency in 2006.  ", "2   \ncomplaint regarding resettlement issues from a nongovernment organization. In June 2005, the \nintegrity division of the Office of the Auditor General initiated an investigation into allegations of \ncorruption in the procurement process of a contract for the access road.4 Although neither of \nthese  investigations  uncovered  any  irregularities,  these  two  cases  delayed  project \nimplementation  and  affected  the  decision-making  process  of  the  government  and  the \nimplementing agency. \n \n6.  In 2008, ADB approved a major change in the scope and implementation arrangements \nof the loan and associated projects to restructure the project design, optimize the available \nfunding, and suit the changed institutional environment.5 The most important change was the \nremoval  of  the  loan  covenant  requiring  a  performance-based  management  contract  as  a \ncondition for awarding the contract for the Melamchi tunnel. The restructuring of the projects \nallowed construction of the tunnel, which had been on hold from 2000 to 2008, to begin. The \nchange in scope did not alter the MWSP\u2019s development benefits or impact. Moreover, the \nMWSP was divided into two subprojects with different implementing agencies, which enhanced \nimplementation  efficiency  by  distributing  responsibilities.  The  Melamchi  Water  Supply \nDevelopment Board (MWSDB) continued to implement the Melamchi River water diversion \nsubproject (subproject 1), which includes the Melamchi tunnel. The newly established water \nutility Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL) became the implementing agency for \nthe Kathmandu Valley water supply and sanitation subproject (subproject 2), which includes \ndistribution network improvements in the valley.  \n \n7.  Following the restructuring of the MWSP, the MWSDB awarded the contract for the \nMelamchi tunnel to China Railway 15 Bureau Group Corporation on 19 February 2009 for \nNRs4,288 million. The tunnel was scheduled for completion by 2 September 2013. Physical \nworks started in April 2010 because of the time required for preparations, including handing \nover  the  sites  to  the  contractor  and  addressing  social  problems  encountered  in  contract \nimplementation. The MWSDB terminated the contract on 25 September 2012 because of the \nunsatisfactory performance of the contractor. As of the termination date, only 23% of tunnel \nexcavation\u20146.3 km of 27.5 km\u2014had been completed.   \n \n8.  The MWSDB rebid the tunnel contract, which was awarded to Cooperativa Muratori e \nCementisti di Ravenna of Italy on 15 July 2013 for NRs8,727 million. The new contract is \nscheduled for completion on 30 September 2016. Additional financing of $25 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources,  which  is  proposed  to  meet  this  cost  overrun,  will  support  the \ncompletion of the Melamchi tunnel and the achievement of the original project\u2019s outcomes. The \nproposed additional financing will not change the scope of the restructured project. \n \n9.  While the MWSP is not performing well, both the original and the restructured projects \nremain the most critical components of the water supply system in the Kathmandu Valley. As \nthe Melamchi tunnel is essential to achieving the full benefits of an improved water supply \n                                                \n4  The Royal Commission for Corruption Control, formed after the royal takeover of 1 February 2005, led the \ninvestigation. As a result of the commission\u2019s investigation, several high-level government officials\u2014both politicians \nand bureaucrats, including the executive director of the MWSP implementing agency\u2014were imprisoned. This was \nfollowed by substantial changes in the implementing agency\u2019s top management. After the abolishment of the \ncommission following the end of the royal regime, all charges were dropped. \n5  ADB. 2000.

A reduction or cancellation of the project at this stage (i) would result in a waste of \nproject expenditures, (ii) would be detrimental to the achievement of the government\u2019s sector \npriorities, and (iii) could cause potential reputational risk for ADB. The project continues to be \ntechnically  feasible  and  economically  sound,  and  the  net  benefits  of  providing  additional \nfinancing to complete the project far outweigh any other option. \n \n10.  Despite the difficulties, the government has consistently maintained its commitment to \nthe  MWSP.  In  addition  to  continuing  infrastructure  development  under  the  MWSP,  the \ngovernment  has  slowly  initiated  institutional  reforms.  The  most  important  reforms  include \nseparation of asset ownership from management; establishment of an independent commission \nfor regulating water tariffs; and establishment of an autonomous water operator company under \nthe Companies Act (1996). Three key entities have been established: (i) the Kathmandu Valley \nWater Supply Management Board, asset owner of water and wastewater systems within the \nvalley; (ii) the Water Supply Tariff Fixation Commission, which is responsible for the economic \nregulation of the sector; and (iii) the KUKL, which is in charge of operating the assets under \nlease and license from Kathmandu Valley Water Supply Management Board. Laws have been \namended or enacted to allow the implementation of these institutional reforms and the private \nsector participation scheme.6 This level of institutional reform in the urban water sector has few \nparallels in South Asia. Moreover, the government and ADB are implementing downstream \nimprovement in the water supply distribution network and wastewater management projects in \nthe Kathmandu Valley to improve the delivery of water supply and wastewater services.7 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The aggregate impact and outcome of the project as a result of the additional financing \nremain the same as those of the current project. The impact will be the improved health and \nwell-being of the people of the Kathmandu Valley. The outcome will be the alleviation of the \nshortage of potable water in the valley. The performance targets and indicators for the impact \nhave been revised to reflect the sector-specific impact and are in the design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1).  \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The additional financing will be provided for the Melamchi Valley Subproject (subproject \n1). The aggregate outputs of the MWSP\u2019s two subprojects as a result of the additional financing \nwill broadly remain the same as those of the current project. The minor corrections, mainly \neditorial, are in the design and monitoring framework.  \n \n13.  The subproject 1 outputs will be as follows: \n \n(i)  Output 1: Raw water diverted from Melamchi Valley to Kathmandu Valley. \nThis output will include (a) a 27.5 km Melamchi diversion tunnel completed and \n170 million liters per day (MLD) of bulk water provided to Kathmandu Valley, (b) \n                                                \n6  The Water Supply Management Board Act (Act No. 21, 2063 [2006]).

The  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  the  overall \nproject including the additional financing is 18.92%; the net present value is $225.62 million.10 \nThe economic internal rate of return is higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital of \n12%, indicating a sufficient economic return. The results from a sensitivity analysis, which range \nfrom 17.47% to 18.92%, are satisfactory against downside risks, including a 10% increase in \ncapital expenditure, a 10% increase in operating costs, a 10% decrease in benefits, and a 1-\nyear delay in project completion.  \n \n22.  Financial analysis. The estimated financial internal rate of return of the overall project \nincluding the additional financing is 7.93%; the net present value is $1.6 million.11 The financial \ninternal rate of return is slightly higher than the weighted average cost of capital, estimated at \n7.90%, indicating an adequate financial return. The sensitivity analysis reveals that financial \nviability of the project is most vulnerable to decreases in revenues, and efforts will be made by \nKUKL  to  rationalize  tariffs  and  enhance revenues. The future  profitability  of  KUKL  will  be \nevaluated  once  the  water  utility  provides  accurate  financial  projections,  which  are  a \ndisbursement condition for the Kathmandu Valley Wastewater Management Project (footnote 7). \nTariff levels were increased in July 2013 by more than 80% and are expected to increase further \nwhen water becomes available from the Melamchi tunnel. The government also agreed in July \n2013 to shoulder KUKL\u2019s tax burden through a grant to the utility. With support from the ongoing \nloans  (footnotes  5  and  7),  KUKL  will  continually  work  to  make  operational  and  financial \nimprovements, including significant reductions in nonrevenue water. These elements are likely \nto improve financial performance soon after the completion of the MWSP.  \n \n                                                \n10 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \nC.  Governance \n23.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MWSDB.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 8). Based on these \nassessments, some of the mitigation measures incorporated in the project design aim to (i) \nestablish a mechanism for regular voluntary disclosure of project-related information to citizens; \n(ii) regularly update the project website to enhance transparency in project implementation, \nprocurement, and safeguards; and (iii) establish a grievance redress mechanism to ensure \nquick and effective resolution. The financial management assessment of the MWSDB, which \nhas been updated since 2008, does not indicate that any additional risks or mitigating measures \nwill  be  required.12 Detailed  accounting  and  auditing  arrangements  are given  in  the  project \nadministration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n24.  A poverty and social analysis has been completed, and the additional financing project is \nclassified as no gender elements.13 While the additional financing has limited impact on the \nsocial and gender aspects of the people in the Kathmandu Valley, the downstream water supply \nand wastewater projects (footnote 7) prioritize connecting all poor households and households \nheaded by women to the water supply and sewerage network in the Kathmandu Valley. Under \nthese projects, the government and KUKL have committed to reform current water supply and \nsewerage connection policies to facilitate individual connections to the poor, socially excluded, \nand households headed by women. Connection fees will be reduced for poor households under \nthese projects. A social uplift program (SUP) under the MWSP is being implemented to promote \nwidespread, ongoing, and meaningful participation of key stakeholders. 14 These projects will \ncomplement KUKL's ongoing efforts to strengthen its pro-poor and gender-inclusive sanitation \nservices.   \n \nE.  Safeguards \n25.  Social safeguards. The additional financing is classified category C for both involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).15 The additional financing for the MWSP will not change the safeguards requirements \nfrom the original project as there will be no additional scope or civil works to be implemented. \nThe PMU submits regular social safeguard monitoring reports to ADB, and these are reviewed \nand disclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). No significant \nsocial safeguard implementation issues have arisen, and the PMU is capable of effectively \nimplementing all safeguards. SUP activities will be continued for Melamchi Valley in line with the \noriginal scope and will cover five areas: buffer zone development, health, education, income \ngeneration, and community development. The inputs of the safeguard and social development \nsupport consultant will be continued to (i) build capacity of the Melamchi Valley Development \nCommittee, MWSDB, and relevant stakeholders; (ii) support the development committee in \n                                                \n12 Draft Financial Management Assessment: Melamchi Water Supply Development Board (accessible from the list of \nsupplementary linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 The SUP is a program under the MWSP\u2019s social and environmental support component to mitigate direct and \nindirect  project  impacts  and  improve  the living conditions of  the local  population  in  project-affected  village \ndevelopment committees.  \n15 The original project was classified category A for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. \n ", "9 \nimplementing SUP activities and create community ownership; and (iii) ensure the subproject is \nimplemented in accordance with social and environmental safeguard requirements, and monitor \nsafeguard compliance. \n \n26.  Environmental safeguards. The additional financing is classified category C for the \nenvironment.16  An environmental management plan was prepared and disclosed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The PMU submits regular environmental safeguard \nmonitoring reports to ADB, and these are reviewed and disclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. No significant environmental safeguard implementation issues has \narisen, and the PMU is capable of effectively implementing all safeguards. Appropriate clauses \nare incorporated in the tunnel contract to control the adverse impacts of construction. This is \nexpected  to  mitigate  environmental  impacts  such  as  (i)  damage  to  the  water  quality  of \nwaterways, (ii) increased erosion, (iii) deterioration of air quality at the construction site, (iv) loud \nsounds from blasting or machines, and (v) failure to rehabilitate land temporarily occupied by \nthe contractor. The tunnel supervision consultant is responsible for ensuring that contractors \nfollow contract specifications, particularly for environmental mitigation. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.17 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nadditional financing are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nCost  and  time  overruns  caused  by  poor  The engineer will closely monitor mobilization and \nmobilization of the contractor or procedural delays  performance  of  the  contractor  for  the  Melamchi \ntunnel to ensure that progress stays on schedule, \nand  will  take  action  according  to  contractual \nprovisions for any delay. Provisions for bonus for \nearly completion and penalties for the delays, as \nincorporated  in  the  bidding  documents,  will  be \nenforced.  The  MWSDB  will  prepare  timelines  for \ndecisions for handing over the sites and approving \ndesigns,  drawings,  variations,  claims,  and  other \ncontractual  matters;  and  will  strictly  monitor \ncompliance with the timelines. The MOUD and ADB \nwill also regularly monitor the progress, quality, and \ncompliance with safeguards. The DSC will support \nproject  management,  safeguards,  reporting,  and \ntraining on FIDIC contracts. ADB will field frequent \nmissions to oversee project performance. \nLoss of life and property because of uncertain  The MWSDB and the engineer will ensure that the \ngeological  conditions  and  hazardous  site  contractor takes adequate safety measures.

ASSURANCES  \n28.  The government and the MOUD have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n29.  The government and the MOUD have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement.     \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n30.
