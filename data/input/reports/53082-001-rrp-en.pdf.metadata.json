The  project  will  help  prevent  the  spread  of  transmissible \ndiseases,  including  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  and  waterborne  diseases,  through \nimproved  medical  waste  disposal  and  strengthened  medical  waste  management  capacity.  A \nproject-readiness financing grant was approved in 2019 to prepare the project and expedite the \nsmooth transition to project implementation.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe RMI, in the northern Pacific Ocean, is composed of 29 coral atolls and 5 coral islands \nand has a population of about 53,000. The RMI is highly vulnerable to natural hazards and climate \nchange impacts. It is classified as a fragile and conflict-affected situation.2 Unemployment is high \nand human development indicators are generally low. The RMI is heavily dependent on external \nassistance, with annual grants averaging about 60% of gross domestic product, mostly from the \nUnited States (US). RMI citizens can live and work in the US without a visa under the RMI\u2019s Compact \nof Free Association with the US, and a significant portion of the working-age population leaves the \nRMI to pursue opportunities in the US. As a result, the RMI has a younger population than the rest \nof the Pacific. Ebeye, on Kwajalein Atoll, is the second-largest urban center in the RMI and one \nof the most densely populated places in the world, with about 10,000 people living in 0.31 square \nkilometers,  placing  pressures  on  urban  services  and  creating  social  challenges.3 Because  of \nsubstantial migration to the US, the population of Ebeye increased by only 0.4% per annum in 1999\u2013\n2011.4 The island has no airport and most visitors arrive through the US Army Garrison Kwajalein \nAtoll. The US base is the major employer of Ebeye residents; other jobs are limited because of the \nlack  of  any  industry.  With  the  ongoing  support  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  Ebeye \nresidents  receive  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation  services.5 Municipal  SWM,  however, \nremains one of the most serious challenges. \n \nWaste generation and collection. Kwajalein Atoll Local Government (KALGOV) collects \n4. \nmunicipal solid waste (household, commercial, and office) 6 days a week. At least one garbage \nbin is provided to each household and waste from a household is collected 2\u20133 times a week. \nThe solid waste is a mixture of food and organic waste, plastic, paper, metal, diapers, textile, and \n\n \n\n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nother  waste.6 KALGOV  collects  about  8\u201312  tons  per  day  of  municipal  solid  waste,  or  0.8\u20131.2 \nkilograms per person, and transports it to the only dump site in the island, without charging the \nusers.7 KALGOV collects and disposes of most generated waste (90%); only a small portion is \nreused, as feed for livestock or  as firewood. With financial support from donors,  KALGOV has \nmanaged to provide basic municipal solid waste collection services, and it is planning to develop \nan SWM tariff framework to collect fees for SWM.8  \n \n5. \nDump site and equipment. Operated by KALGOV since 2005, the only dump site covers \n1.6 hectares in the north end of the island or about 5% of Ebeye. However, collected waste is \npiled  randomly  inside  the  site  without  any  compacting.  The  dump  site  is  a  prime  location  for \nmosquito breeding, which led to a major outbreak of dengue fever in 2019.9 It is an environmental \nnuisance and leachate pollutes the lagoon. The dump site is in danger of being inundated because \nof sea-level rise resulting from climate change. It needs to be upgraded to a managed landfill if \nits life is to be extended. Waste collection and management vehicles and equipment operated by \nKALGOV are inadequate, and often severely damaged or not functional. The operating lifetime of \nsuch equipment is shortened by the harsh marine environment and lack of adequate and timely \nmaintenance. The lack of replacement parts exacerbates the problem. KALGOV needs to develop \nand implement asset management with sufficient financing to maintain equipment performance. \n \n6. \nRecycling in Ebeye and the solid waste management plan. To encourage recycling \nand reduce littering, the RMI introduced the Container Disposal Legislation (CDL) system in 2018. \nThe CDL bans some single-use plastic products and introduced a refunding system for beverage \ncontainers  so  they  can  be  sent  to  the  Majuro  Atoll  Waste  Company  for  recycling.  While  the \nnecessary law and regulations are in place, KALGOV has not been able to implement the CDL.10 \nKALGOV approved the Kwajalein Atoll SWM Plan in 2018, which includes an integrated action \nplan for 2019\u20132023, to (i) improve waste reduction and recycling through the CDL, (ii) manage \nand  improve  the  current  final  disposal  dump  site,  (iii)  sustain  the  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M) of waste collection services, and (iv) improve the financial sustainability of SWM services. \nThese  actions  require  substantial  investment.  Given  the  scarcity  of  land  available  for  a  new \nlandfill,  KALGOV  should  take  measures  to  reduce  waste  volume,  extend  the  lifetime  of  the \nexisting dump site, and achieve sustainable and effective SWM. \n \nMedical waste management. Ebeye Hospital is the only hospital in Ebeye, with 45 beds \n7. \nand 80 staff members, serving the population of the Kwajalein Atoll.11 In 2014, the Secretariat of \nthe  Pacific  Regional  Environment  Programme  conducted  a  detailed  study  on  medical  waste \nmanagement in the hospital, and the result showed that the system failed to meet most standards, \nsuch  as  having  a  waste  management  policy  or  a  training  plan  for  the  staff.12 To  improve  its \n\n \n\n6  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency.  2016.

Apia. \n\n\fperformance,  Ebeye  Hospital  hired  a  private  contractor  in  2019  to  manage  and  process  its \nmedical  waste.  While  medical  waste  is  segregated  and  managed  by  the  contractor  at  a  small \ntemporary incineration unit, safety standards for handling and transporting medical waste need to \nbe improved. The incinerator has limited capacity and performs to low environmental standards. \nThe hospital needs assistance to reduce environmental and health hazards. \n \n8. \nCOVID-19  outbreak  and  impact.  The  RMI  imposed  strict  travel  restrictions  and \nquarantine requirements early on that had been effective in keeping the country free of COVID-\n19 until the end of October. However, the country\u2019s first two border cases of COVID-19 have been \nidentified in the US base on the Kwajalein Atoll on 27 October 2020. Once the country reopens, \nthe RMI will be further at risk of the rapid spread of COVID-19 because of the weak public health \nsystem.  The  RMI  has  received  a  large  amount  of  personal  protective  equipment  and  medical \ngoods for precautions and testing. In Ebeye, medical waste has increased significantly because \nof COVID-19 testing and prevention; globally, the amount of infectious medical waste has been \nincreasing rapidly, overwhelming medical transport and disposal infrastructure.13 Additional waste \nmanagement  systems  must  be  put  in  place  to  help  manage  the  impact  of  COVID-19  and  the \nemergence of other diseases. \n \nB. \n \nThe government requested assistance from ADB to implement the Kwajalein Atoll SWM \n9. \nPlan for the proposed project, which is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for \n11 small Pacific island countries, 2020\u20132022.14 The project will contribute to goals 5, 10, 11, 12, \nand  13  of  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  by  reducing  waste  pollution  in  Ebeye  and \nprotecting  the  ocean  from  waste  pollution.15 The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030, \nspecifically  operational  priorities  (OPs)  1,  2,  3,  4,  and  6.16 The  project  is  consistent  with  the \nstrategic  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Approach  2016\u20132020  to  manage  risk  and  enable  value \ncreation  through  urban  infrastructure  investment  and  ADB\u2019s  Oceans  Financing  Initiative. 17 \nFollowing  other  ADB  support  to  the  RMI  in  response to  COVID-19,  the  project  will  reduce  the \nenvironmental and health hazard of increased medical waste during the COVID-19 pandemic.18 \n \n10. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: efficient, effective, resilient, sustainable, \nand affordable services and facilities that promote sustainable economic growth provided.19 The \nproject will have the following outcome: coverage and sustainability of integrated SWM service \ndelivery improved in Ebeye. The project aims to improve the coverage of the sustainable SWM \nservices to at least 8,400 people (85% of the population) in Ebeye, including at least 4,200 women \n(85%  of  the  female  population).  Focusing  on  integrated  municipal  SWM  and  aligned  with  the \nKwajalein Atoll SWM Plan, the project will have three outputs: 20 \n\nProject Description \n\n \n\n13  ADB. 2020.

Existing \nsolid waste will be shaped into a mound and covered with a layer of material in \naccordance with the RMI SWM regulations. The seawall to be constructed in the \nwestern and northern part of the dump site will be about 270 meters long and stop \ninundation and prevent solid waste from polluting the lagoon.  \nConstruct a high-temperature incinerator capable of burning 9\u201313 tons a day in the \nlandfill site using a design\u2013build\u2013manage contract. The incinerator will process all \nthe municipal solid waste in Ebeye and generate bottom ash. The contractor will \nbe  responsible  for  the  performance  of  the  incinerator  and  the  training  of  the \nKALGOV staff. KALGOV will undertake the daily operation and the contractor will \nprovide remote monitoring and management. In response to COVID-19, the project \nwill  ensure  that  the  incinerator  will  process  hazardous  medical  waste  and \nmenstrual waste properly. \n\n(iii)   Construct a recycling facility house in the landfill site to store recycling equipment \n\nprocured by KALGOV.  \n\n \n12. \nOutput  2:  Municipal  solid  waste  collection,  transport,  and  disposal  operations \nimproved.  The  project  will  (i)  upgrade  and  replace  vehicles  and  equipment  for  solid  waste \ncollection, transport, and disposal; and (ii) replace waste collection containers for more efficient \noperation. KALGOV will adopt cost-effective procurement to ensure the sustainability of vehicles \nand equipment, such as a multiyear maintenance and repair service agreement for the purchased \nequipment. In response to COVID-19, specific equipment and supplies will be procured in a timely \nmanner for safe medical waste management, including waste classification, segregation, storage, \ntransport,  and  disposal.  The  project  will  help  Ebeye  Hospital  and  its  contractor  strengthen the \nexisting medical waste management system, starting from the period before construction until the \noperation of the incinerator, including the first 12 months of project implementation. \n \n13. \nand local engagement strengthened. The project will accomplish the following:  \n\nOutput 3: Institutional capacity to sustain solid waste management service delivery \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nImprove  the  technical  capacity  of  KALGOV,  develop  and  implement  a  waste \ncollection and transport plan,21 develop and implement an operation plan for the \nmanaged waste landfill, and formulate and implement an asset management plan \nfor vehicles and equipment for waste management. The asset management plan \nwill cover O&M of equipment and provisions to secure funding for O&M and capital \nequipment replacement, and build KALGOV\u2019s capacity KALGOV to implement the \nCDL.  \nImprove  KALGOV\u2019s  financial  sustainability  to  maintain  the  services.  The  project \nwill  develop  and  implement  a  gender-sensitive  institutional  reform  plan  for \nKALGOV,  including  actions  to  support  women  in  leadership  and/or  technical \npositions, and help KALGOV develop and implement the SWM tariff framework. \nAs practiced in many countries, an SMW tariff can be charged and collected with \nthe electricity tariff, which exists in Ebeye and has a high collection ratio.  \n\n21 Collection  operations  to  be  reviewed  include  operational  and  safety  procedures  for  collection  workers.

The project will review the current medical waste management procedures, roles \nand  responsibilities,  and  budget  of  Ebeye  Hospital;  develop  new  medical  waste  management \nprocedures  for  the  hospital;  and  design  and  implement  training  for  the  hospital  staff  and \ncontractors who handle medical waste. \n \nC. \n \n15. \nADB\u2019s value added includes (i) bringing project-readiness financing to accelerate project \nreadiness  and  build  the  project  implementation  capacity  of  KALGOV  and  Ministry  of  Works, \nInfrastructure,  and  Utilities  (MWIU);  (ii)  strengthening  gender  mainstreaming  and  KALGOV \ncapacity building; and (iii) dealing with medical waste related to COVID-19 in a timely manner. \nLessons  from  previous  ADB  operations  in  the  urban  sector  have  been  incorporated  into  the \nproject design, including the importance of (i) highlighting financial and technical sustainability,  \n(ii) ensuring that climate-proof designs are adopted, and (iii) ensuring urban service demand and \nwillingness  to  pay.  SWM  is  a  major  issue  in  most  island  countries.  The  project  will  set  up \nintegrated SWM, including waste recycling and a pilot sustainable small-scale incinerator. If the \nproject is successful, ADB will work with island country governments to expand integrated SWM \nin the Pacific, covering ocean waste management and contributing to ocean health initiatives. \n \nD. \n \n16. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $7.067  million  (Table  1).

The incinerator will reduce solid waste \nvolume by about 95% and weight by 80%. As the thermal combustion of the waste in a controlled \nenvironment  prevents  the  release  of  methane  into  the  atmosphere,  which  occurs  during \ndecomposition of organic waste at the dump site, incineration will significantly reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions (GHG) and, therefore, has considerable environmental benefits. The incinerator\u2019s \ncapacity will be greater than existing solid waste production. Such capacity will provide flexibility \nto combust more solid waste if the urban population increases or it becomes necessary to reduce \nvolume of existing waste at the site. Comparing the current disposal at the dump site, Incineration \nof the present quantity of waste will reduce GHG emissions by about 73% or 2,688 tons carbon \ndioxide equivalent annually.24 \n \nB. \n \n22. \nEconomic analysis. The economic rationale for the government\u2019s intervention is solid, as \nthe  project  will  provide  sustainable  urban  basic  SWM  services.  A  least-cost  analysis  was \nconducted instead of a cost\u2013benefit analysis because quantifying the project\u2019s economic benefits \nwas difficult.25 The assumed alternative was that KALGOV would transport waste to Majuro as \nthe  Ebeye  dump  site  could  no  longer  take  in  additional  waste.  This  option  presupposes  that \nMajuro has either a managed landfill or a high-temperature incinerator, although it has neither. \nUsing  a  6.0%  discount  rate  deemed  appropriate  for  a  project  with  significant  environmental \nbenefits and in a small, fragile island economy, the least-cost analysis indicated that the project \nis  the  least-cost  option.  The  analysis  noted  that  the  project  will  yield  significant  unquantifiable \nbenefits  such  as  reduced  incidence  of  diseases,  translating  to  avoided medical  costs  and  lost \nproductivity; environmental improvements, including greenhouse gas emissions and benefits from \nupgraded handling of hazardous medical waste; and additional income from service charges and \nresale of recyclable materials recovered during waste collection. \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n24 KfW\u2019s Solid Waste Management Greenhouse Gas Calculator was used to estimate GHG emissions for incineration \n\nand to compare the emissions with the current situation base case.  \n\n25 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nSustainability and Climate Change \n\n \n23. \nFinancial analysis. A financial analysis was conducted for the project in accordance with \nADB\u2019s guidelines.26 While the project will support the establishment of a waste tariff framework \nenabling  KALGOV  to  collect  fees  and  cover  part  of  O&M  costs,  KALGOV  can  fully  cover  the \nincremental  O&M  costs  over  the  incinerator\u2019s  15-year  useful  life  only  assuming  that  KALGOV \nreceives continued financial support from the national government (sourced from US grants under \nthe  Compact  of  Free  Association),  the  Kwajalein  Impact  Fund,  and  other  potential  funding \nsources.27 Substantial risk  accrues to  project financial  sustainability,  arising from  (i)  insufficient \ntariff revenue for O&M; and (ii) dependence on limited national budgetary allocations and external \ngrants, and changing national priorities. To mitigate this risk, regular annual budget allocations \nfor  O&M  costs  need  to  be  allocated  by  the  central  government.  ADB  will  provide  continuous \nsupport under the project to build KALGOV\u2019s financial management capacity. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nSustainable operation and maintenance. The O&M responsibility for the incinerator will \nbe shared by KALGOV and the contractor, which will build KALGOV\u2019s capacity and minimize the \ncontractor\u2019s personnel requirement. Building the KALGOV staff\u2019s capacity related to, and raising \nthe  public\u2019s  awareness  of,  integrated  SWM  will  strengthen  the  SWM  chain  for  long-term \nsustainability.  The  government  will  undertake  regular  and  periodic  maintenance  of  the  project \nfacilities in accordance with the project\u2019s asset management plan and make adequate resources \navailable through budgetary allocations for O&M of the project facilities. \n \n25. \nClimate and  climate  change  resilience.  Given the  island\u2019s  exposure  to  the  sea, sea-\nlevel  rise,  and  climatic  hazards,  a  climate  risk  assessment  was  prepared. 28  To  ensure  the \ntechnical sustainability of the infrastructure, climate and climate change\u2013proofed approaches will \nbe embedded in the project. A seawall will be built to adapt to sea-level rise, protect infrastructure, \nand prevent solid waste from sliding into the lagoon. Climate and climate change hazards will be \nthoroughly analyzed as part of the detailed design. Climate and disaster risk measures will be \nincorporated into the waste collection and transport plan under output 3. If successful, the project \nwill help expand integrated SWM to the Pacific and contribute to ADB\u2019s Action Plan for Healthy \nOceans and Sustainable Blue Economies.29 \n \nD. \n \n26. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in  June  and  July  2020,  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  Technical  Guidance  Note  and  Financial  Due \nDiligence: A Methodology Note.30 The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is high \nmainly because of the key risks for project implementation, such as limited staff resources, high \nstaff turnover, weak capacity, inadequate financial management system, and lack of internal audit \ncapacity.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  a  dedicated  PIU  will  be  established  for  day-to-day  project \nimplementation and management. The MWIU secretary will be the PIU head and certify all eligible \npayments  (invoices  and  progress  claims).  A  project  implementation  assistance  consultant,  a \nfinancial management specialist, and a construction monitoring consultant will be recruited to staff \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\n26 ADB. 2019.

The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 22). \n \n \nE. \n \nThe project is classified as having effective gender mainstreaming. Overall, women are \n28. \nlargely  responsible for managing  household  waste  and the  negative health and environmental \nimpacts of poor waste management (e.g., caring for sick family members). Menstrual hygiene and \nmenstrual  waste  disposal  are  considered  taboo  and  rarely  discussed.  Women\u2019s  labor  force \nparticipation is low, with only 26% of women working for pay compared with 48% of men. Women \nare largely employed in finance and administrative roles and few in technical roles. No women \nwork in technical roles in KALGOV. A gender action plan has been developed to ensure women\u2019s \nparticipation  in  the  project  and  access  to  project  benefits. 31 Gender  design  features  include \nprovision  of  continuous  solid  waste  collection  services  for  at  least  8,400  people  in  Ebeye  and \nsurrounding  communities,  including  at  least  4,200  women  and  200  households  headed  by \nwomen. A new solid waste collection and disposal operation plan will deal with women\u2019s and girls\u2019 \nissues and recommendations, including menstrual hygiene and waste management. The gender \naction plan will include women in SWM training, encourage them to apply for new positions, and \nhire  and  train  them  in  KALGOV  during  project  operations.  Raising  high  school  girl  students\u2019 \nawareness of menstrual health and hygiene will be emphasized. \n \nF. \n \n29. \ncategories are as follow:32 \n \n30. \nEnvironment (category B). The project is expected to bring significant positive impacts, \nincluding improved public health, because of reduced odor and vector-borne diseases; cleaner \nnear-field marine waters because of better managed stormwater runoff and reduced waste at the \ndump site; and improved integrated waste management through better operational control and \ndisposal of solid waste. The project\u2019s major civil works components, comprising improved landfill \noperations  and  introduction  of  a  high-temperature  incinerator  system,  are  consistent  with  the \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  RMI  environmental  regulations. 33 \nThe impacts of civil works are site-specific, largely limited to the construction footprint, and can \nbe  mitigated  and  managed  to  acceptable  levels,  provided  the  measures  identified  in  the  initial \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n31 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 ADB.
