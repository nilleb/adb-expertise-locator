The World Economic Forum already ranks Bangladesh 135th out \nof  142  countries  measured  against  the  quality  and  constancy  of  electricity  supply.2 This  is  not \nsurprising since more than half of the country\u2019s population does not have access to electricity, \nand many of those who do have access only receive intermittent supply. During peak periods, \nup  to  30%  of  demand  is  unmet  (a  deficit  of  nearly  2,000  megawatts  [MW]).  In  2011  and  the \nsummer of 2012 there was load shedding for 5 hours a day in Dhaka city, and in other cities and \nmost  rural  areas  the  situation  is  much  worse.  Clearly,  this  situation  stunts  economic \nperformance,  cuts  into  business  competitiveness  and  productivity,  and  seriously  affects  the \nquality  of  life  of  people and  delivery  of  basic  public  services.  The  government  wants  to  arrest \nthis problem and is trying to do so through both physical investments and reforms. A first wave \nof investments and reforms was started a few years ago, and the results so far are reasonable. \nHowever,  the  job  is  far  from  done.  A  new  investment  and  reform  program  is  required.  The \ngovernment has developed an investment program for the next 5 years (2011\u20132015). The goal \nremains  of  increasing  energy  security  through  a  combination  of  sequenced  interventions, \nincluding  supply-  and  demand-side  efficiency  measures;  new  capital  outlays  in  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution; investments to raise electrification rates to 68% by the end of the \nperiod;  and  the  acceleration  of  reforms  to  improve efficiency,  accountability,  and effectiveness \nof  sector  institutions.  The  government  wants  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  be  its \npartner  in  this  endeavor,  and  it  is  in  this  context  that  it  requested  financial  and  advisory  help \nthrough the proposed MFF.3  \n \n\nII. \n\n THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM  \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nSector  performance.  Sector  performance  is  low  but  there  have  been  notable \nimprovements  in  the  last  decade.  Electrification  rates  have  risen  from  10%  in  1994  to  50%  in \n2012\u2014an  improvement  made  against  rapidly  rising  demand  of  more  than  160%  during      \n2002\u20132012.  Transmission  and  distribution  losses  have  been  cut  sharply,  mainly  due  to \ninvestment  and better  management. The financial  performance of  most sector companies has \nalso  improved  due  to  higher  tariffs,  better  collection,  improved  financial  transparency,  and \nincreased  metering.  However,  much  remains  to  be  done.  Supplies  are  still  irregular  and  the \nsystem is overreliant on natural gas. Half the population does not have access to electricity (with \nrural areas being worse off than urban areas). Load shedding remains high and there are high \nlosses  in  the  transmission  and  distribution  system.  The  financial  performance  of  some \ncompanies needs substantial improvement. Total available generation capacity is 4,890 MW but \ndemand  is  about  7,000  MW.  Power  shortages  remain  commonplace,  and  the  cost  to  the \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  World Economic Forum. 2011.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\neconomy  is  close  to  0.5%  of  gross  domestic  product.4 Moreover,  the  problem  is  set  to  get \nworse, with the additional supply requirement in 2015 to meet projected demand being 12,500 \nMW.  This  implies  the  need  for  major  investment  in  generation,  efficiency  measures,  and \ntransmission and distribution. \n \n4. \nPolicy framework. Bangladesh has a comprehensive energy policy. The 2008 National \nEnergy Policy focuses on energy security and efficiency, financial transparency, cost recovery, \nand a much greater role for the private sector. The  government\u2019s Vision for 2021 provides the \nbroad  context  for  this  policy,  setting  universal  access  to  electricity  as  a target.  The  Sixth  Five \nYear  Plan,  FY2011\u2013FY2015  breaks  down  this  strategy  into  specific  investments  and  reforms \n(footnote  4).  ADB  and  other  development  partners  have  been  helping  the  government  further \nrefine  the  policy  and  the  investment  frameworks.  The  reforms  are  captured  under  the  Power \nSector Reform in Bangladesh program,5 which includes (i) setting up an independent regulatory \nbody  (the  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory  Commission),  (ii)  unbundling  power  sector  agencies \nand  adopting  a  better  corporate  governance \nthe  business \nenvironment  for  private  sector  investment,  and  (iv)  expanding  rural  electrification.  ADB  has \nextended technical  assistance to help  with vertical  unbundling,  and  private  sector  participation \nproposals.  ADB  is  also  helping  with  the  development  of  a  public\u2013private  partnership  program \nand analytical studies on gas and power tariff changes.  \n \nRoad  map.  The  policy  framework  for  the  sector  is  backed  by  a  plan  to  execute \n5. \ninvestments  and  reforms  in  a  sequenced  manner.  These  investments  are  physical  and \nnonphysical, as well as private and public in nature. ADB funding to the sector so far exceeds \n$2.2  billion.  An energy  sector  assessment  program  evaluation  undertaken  by  the Independent \nEvaluation  Department  in  2009  concluded  that  ADB\u2019s  work  has  been  significant  and \nsuccessful. 6  The  future  program  will  raise  capacity  to  12,567  MW,  with  the  private  sector \naccounting  for  more  than  half  of  this.

It  allows  the  parties  to  dedicate  more  resources  to  implementation.  Second,  the \nmodality  supports  high  project  readiness  (such  as  design  work  and  safeguard  plans  being \nexecuted  up  front)  and  offers  critical  mass,  continuity,  and  predictability  in  relation  to  funding. \nThird, the MFF creates a platform for development partners to work with ADB in the sector, and \neach tranche has room for cofinanciers to partner with ADB. This means greater opportunities \nfor leveraging finance but also knowledge. Indeed, ADB will showcase the investment program \nto others for this purpose. Finally, all the basic preconditions for the use of the MFF are in place, \nincluding a sound policy framework and road map, a clear investment and financing plan, and \nan  agreement  on  the  treatment  of  safeguards  policies  and  procedures  and  a  governance \nframework.  The  governance  framework  will  be  underpinned  by  tight  fiduciary  oversight. \nProcurement  work  will  be  \u2015ring-fenced\u2016  through  the  use  of  specialized  and  independent \nconsultants (to support the evaluation process and contract negotiations). ADB itself will play an \nactive facilitation role in both  cases.  Consultants  engaged  to  support  the  government  with this \nwork  will  have  a  dual  reporting  role  to  ADB.  Contracts  will  be  audited  on  a  regular  basis.  In \naddition to providing strong oversight, these arrangements will also improve the timelines for the \nengagement of consultants and contractors.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact will be increased energy sector contribution to low-carbon economic growth. \n7. \nThis  growth  will  be  achieved \nimproved  energy  efficiency,  productivity  and \ncompetitiveness,  and  will  create  more  jobs.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  access  to  a  clean \nand reliable supply of electricity in Bangladesh. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nthrough \n\n8. \nInvestments  will  be  sequenced  and  cover  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution. \nUnder a pilot program, up to 200 solar-energy-supported irrigation pumps benefitting 4,000 poor \nfarming families will be installed. A capacity building input will focus on project readiness, new \ntranche preparation, and contract supervision. Staff in various institutions will also be trained on \npower system management and help given with auditing, financial management and reporting.  \n \n9. \nThe  investments  will  focus  on  supply-side  energy  efficiency  and  transmission  and \ndistribution,  and  will  increase  generation  capacity  by  up  to  700  MW.  The  program  will  convert \nopen cycle gas-fired power plants into combined cycle plants. This is an environmentally friendly \napproach  as  it  will  increase  power  supply  by  50%  without  consuming  extra  gas.  Under  the \nprogram,  up  to  470  kilometers  (km)  of  transmission  lines  and  associated  facilities  will  then  be \nconstructed.  Finally,  there  will  be  upstream  improvements  to  the  33  kilovolt  (kV)  network \n(including  up  to  500  km  of  distribution  lines  and  associated  facilities  and  up  to  39  new  or \nupgraded 33/11 kV substations).  \n \n10. \nTranche  1  will  convert  the  Khulna  power  plant  (225  MW)  into  a  combined  cycle  plant. \nCofinanciers  will  focus  on  converting  the  Baghabari  (150  MW),  Sylhet  (225  MW),  and \nShahjibazar (105 MW) power plants.7 Tranche 1 will also invest in the transmission system by \nconstructing three transmission  lines  and  associated  substations:  (i)  100 km  of 132 kV  double \ncircuit  transmission  line  for  Mynmensingh\u2013Tangail,  (ii)  80  km  of  132  kV  double  circuit \ntransmission line for Chandraghona\u2013Rangamati\u2013Khagrachari, and (iii) 50 km of 132 kV double \n\n                                                \n7  Technical details of the power plants are provided in Technical Assessment on Tranche 1 Subprojects (accessible \n\nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The indicated capacity is the capacity after conversion. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ncircuit transmission line for Brahmanbaria\u2013Narsingdi. The rest of the funds under tranche 1 will \ncover capacity building work.  The  EIB will finance the Baghabari and Shahjibazar power plant \nconversions,  and  the  Islamic  Development  Bank  will  finance  the  Sylhet  plant  conversion. \nTranche  2  will  focus  on  expanding  transmission,  improving  distribution,  and  a  pilot  solar \nirrigation scheme. Tranche 3 will focus again on modernizing and converting generation plants. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe government has an ambitious investment plan for the medium-to-long term, but not \n11. \nenough  funds  to  support  it.  The  private  sector  and  development  partners  will  be  the  main \nfunding  sources  for  this  plan.  In  the  meantime,  and  in  the  context  of  the  shorter-term \ninvestments, the government has requested ADB and other development partners to provide a \ntotal financing of $1.6 billion (Table 2).  \n \n\nTable 2: Investment Program \n\nAmount ($ million) \n\nFacility \n \n\n1.

The  EIB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $7  million,  which  will  be  fully \nadministered by ADB. \n \n\n                                                \n8   Includes  a  maturity  premium  of  10  basis  points.  This  is  based  on  the  above  loan  terms  and  the  government\u2019s \n\nchoice of repayment option and date. \n\n \n\n\fTable 3: Financing Plan  \n\nInvestment Program Funding ($ million) \n\nTranche 1 \n(2012) \n   185.0  \n\nTranche 2a \n(2013) \n   310.0  \n\nTranche 3 \n(2015) \n   205.0  \n\n     0.0  \n91.0 \n    7.0  \n    85.0  \n    32.0  \n   400.0  \n\n   100.0  \n0.0 \n0.0 \n   195.0  \n   105.0  \n   710.0  \n\n     0.0 \n100.0 \n   0.0  \n   100.0  \n    85.0  \n   490.0  \n\n5 \n\nTotal \n  700.0  \n\n  100.0  \n191.0 \n  7.0  \n  380.0  \n  222.0  \n 1,600.0  \n\nSource  \nAsian Development Bank [ordinary capital \nresources (loan)]  \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (loan) \nEuropean Investment Bank (loan) \nEuropean Investment Bank (grant) \nIslamic Development Bank (loan) \nGovernment of Bangladesh \nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n\n Implementation Arrangements \n\na  Trnche  2  and  3  cofinancing  arrangement  were  discussed    with  cofinanciers  and  broadly  agreed.  Confirmation  of \n\ntranche 2 and 3 cofinancing is subject to the board approvals of the cofinancing partners.  \n\nThe  investments  cover  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  and  as  such  will \n14. \nrequire  several  executing  agencies:  Bangladesh  Power  Development  Board  (BPDB);  Dhaka \nPower Distribution Company (DPDC); and Dhaka Electricity Supply Company (DESCO); North-\nWest  Power  Generation  Company  Limited  (NWPGCL);  Power  Division,  Ministry  of  Power, \nEnergy, and Mineral Resources (MPEMR); Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB); Rural \nElectrification  Board  (REB).  Coordination  will  be  a  challenge  and  will  be  outsourced  to \nspecialized  consultants,  with  ADB  playing  a  facilitation  role  throughout.  The  investments  are \nreasonably self-contained and the agencies understand ADB procedures. The Power Division at \nthe  MPEMR  will  implement  the  capacity  building  component,  the  BPDB  and  NWPGCL  will \nimplement the  energy  efficiency  work, the  PGCB  will  implement  the transmission  investments, \nthe  DPDC  and  DESCO  will  implement  the  distribution  work,  and  the  REB  will  implement  the \npilot  solar  irrigation  scheme.  A  project  management  unit  will  be  established  within  each \nexecuting agency. The Power Division at  the MPEMR will set up a project coordination unit to \noversee all the work and report to ADB. The implementation arrangements are summarized in \nTable 4 and described in detail in the facility administration manual.9  \n \n15. \nEuropean  Investment  Bank  requested  ADB  to  administer  $7  million  grant  for  capacity \nbuilding  component  because  of  ADB\u2019s  strong  physical  presence  in  Bangladesh  and  its  better \nunderstanding  of  the  power  sector  capacity  building  needs.    Capacity  building  component \nundertake  training  activities  of  all  the  power  sector  agencies  and  it  is  an  integral  part  of  the \nentire investment program.  Success of the capacity building component is necessary to ensure \ndelivering the outcomes of the investment program.   Because EIB is providing the grant to be \nadministered by ADB, it is proposed to expand country eligibility for procurement or recruitment \nof consultants to be made using the EIB grant by allowing firms, subcontractors, and sourcing of \nmaterials from any country eligible under ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and EIB's procurement \nguidelines.  Such  an  expansion  of  country  and  source  eligibility  is  required  for  efficient \nimplementation  of  the  investment  program  and would  require  a  waiver  under  Article  14  (ix)  of \nthe Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank. \n\n                                                \n9   Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nJune 2013\u2013June 2019 \n31 December 2020 \n\n(ii)  Executing agencies \n\n(iii)  Implementation units \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nCoordinating committee: \nSecretary of the Power Division, MPEMR (chair) \nChairs of BPDB and REB; managing directors of PGCB, NWPGCL, \nDESCO, DPDC, Representatives from Economic Relations Division, Finance \nDivision, Planning Commission, and  Implementation, Monitoring and \nEvaluation Division. \nBPDB, PGCB, NWPGCL, DESCO, DPDC, REB, Power Division at \nMPEMR  \nProject management units in BPDB, PGCB, NWPGCL, DESCO, \nDPDC, Power Division at MPEMR \nAll works and goods to be financed by ADB under the MFF will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as \namended from time to time).a \nAll consultancy services to be financed by ADB under the MFF will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \nUnder each tranche, ADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, \nallow on request advance contracting. Retroactive financing will be \nrequested for one contract package in the capacity building component \nfor tranche preparation.  \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and \nADB. \n\na Procurement plan in periodic financing request provides details. (Accessible in the link documents in Appendix 2). \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  BPDB  =  Bangladesh  Power  Development  Board;  DESCO  =  Dhaka  Electricity \nSupply  Company;  DPDC  =  Dhaka  Power  Distribution  Company;  MFF  =  multitranche  financing  facility;  MPEMR  = \nMinistry  of  Power,  Energy,  and  Mineral  Resources;  NWPGCL  =  North-West  Power  Generation  Company  Limited; \nPGCB = Power Grid Company of Bangladesh; REB = Rural Electrification Board. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n16. \nGoods  and  works  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive \nbidding  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).  Project  preparation,  implementation,  and  management  support  will  require  consultants, \nwhich will be engaged in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). All consulting services, except implementation consultants, will be \nrecruited  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection,  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20. 10 \nConsultancy  firms  will  be  required  to  use  in-house  staff  for  the  key  tasks  under  the  mandates \nand have a dual reporting function to ADB. Taxes and duties of ADB-funded packages will be \npaid by ADB. \n \n17. \nThe evaluation of bids will be carried out by government agency staff with support from \nspecialized  and  independent  consultants. The same  will  apply  with contract  negotiations.  ADB \nwill play an active facilitation role, and will engage its own consultants to help it with this work. \nThe facilitation role will cover the process, timelines, and quality.  \n \n\n                                                \n10 Implementation consultants will be selected using 90:10 quality\u2013cost ratio. \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nA. \n \nTechnical due diligence was conducted on all tranche 1 investments. The work focused \n18. \non the investment plan, operating cost structures, and the feasibility of the technology solutions. \nThe work was undertaken by independent consultants and was reviewed by ADB technical staff. \nADB is satisfied that the proposals are sound and meet appropriate technical standards.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n19. \nThe  proposal  is  backed  by  due  diligence  on  economic  and  financial  matters.  About \n450,000  households  will  directly  benefit  from  the  investments.  Energy  efficiency  improvement \nand system loss reduction will reduce carbon emissions by 2.48 million tons per year. System \nloss  reduction  represents  233  gigawatt-hours  in  energy  savings  every  year.  This  investment \nalso cuts air pollution. The economic internal rate of return of tranche 1 investments is estimated \nat  56.6%.  The  financial  internal  rates  of  return  have  been  estimated  for  the  power  plant \nconversions  (4.0%)  and  transmission  lines  (4.5%),  exceeding  their  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital values of 1.9% for power plant conversion and 2.1% for transmission lines. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n20. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  executing  agencies.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, implementation of the projects under the MFF will \nadhere to ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy. ADB reserves the right to review and examine, directly or \nthrough  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to \nprojects  under  the  MFF.  In  this  regard,  investigation  of  government  officials,  if  any,  will  be \nrequested  by  ADB  to  be  undertaken  by  the  government.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  agreement  and  the  bidding \ndocuments.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  will  include  provisions  specifying  the \nright  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  projects  under  the  MFF. \nGovernance  assessment  shows  that  reasonably  good  systems  are  in  place  but  training \nprograms will be required. As an additional measure, ADB will facilitate the work related to bid \nevaluation and contract negotiation processes of ADB-funded contract packages.11  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n21. \nPoor and vulnerable consumers, as well as public utilities such as hospitals and schools, \nare  often  particularly  disadvantaged  by  inadequate  power  supplies,  load  shedding,  and  poor \npower quality. They will therefore benefit directly from the investment program. The investment \nprogram  is  expected  to  generate  jobs  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  during  construction  and \nbeyond.  Increasing  access  and  improving  reliability  of  electricity  will  disproportionately  benefit \nwomen  by  saving  their  time  and  allowing  them  to  have  more  leisure  time.  Children  will  also \ndirectly benefit from the reliable power supply as they can extend their study hours. Tranche 1 is \nclassified  as  having  no  gender  elements  but  tranche  2  will  have  opportunities  for  gender \nmainstreaming. \n \n\n                                                \n11 ADB\u2019s role as a facilitator is fully described in the Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nimplementation  of \n\n22. \nAn  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  and  a  resettlement  framework \nwere  prepared  outlining  the  environmental  and  social  safeguard  principles  and  requirements. \nThe  executing  agencies  will  undertake  environmental  and  social  safeguard  due  diligence  on \nsubprojects  based  on  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  and  resettlement \nframework,  and  submit  semiannual  reports  on \nthe  environmental \nmanagement plan and resettlement plan for subprojects. Tranche 1 is classified category B for \nthe  environment.  The  proposed  project  has  no  potential  for  significant  air,  water,  or  noise \npollution  and  it  has  positive  environmental  effects  of  reducing  local  air  pollution  and  carbon \nemissions.  It  does  not  fall  in  the  vicinity  of  any  natural  ecosystems,  reserve forests,  protected \nareas, and cultural sites. It has temporary minor impacts during construction that can be readily \nmitigated. An initial environmental examination and environmental management plan have been \nprepared  for  tranche  1  components  based  on  selected  representative  subproject  sites. \nTranches 2 and 3 are likely to be classified category B for environment. \n \nTranche  1  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Its  transmission \n23. \ncomponents  will  not  require  land  acquisition.  Construction  of  new  transmission  lines  will  have \nminor temporary impacts on standing crops on about 300 ha. Only a very small amount of land \n(0.3  ha)  will  be  permanently  affected.  Compensation  for  temporary  crop  damage  was \nincorporated  in  the  resettlement  plan.  No  land  acquisition  is  required  for  power  plant \nconversions.  Site  visits  were  made  to  all  tranche  1  power  plants  and  necessary  due  diligence \nwas  undertaken,  with  17  consultation  meetings  held  during  8\u201328  May  2012.  A  total  of  267 \npeople attended the meetings, 44% of whom were women. Seven separate meetings were held \nwith women and four with ethnic minorities. No major issues were raised in these meetings and \nthe communities extended their support for the project.  \n \n24. \nTranche  1  is  classified  under  indigenous  peoples  category  C.  According  to  social \nassessments, no indigenous peoples are expected to be significantly affected by the investment \nprogram. In the event of impacts on indigenous peoples, the investment program will apply the \nmitigation  measures  provided  in  the  resettlement  framework,  which  include  specific  measures \nthat  provide  entitlements  to  vulnerable  groups,  including  indigenous  peoples.  Transmission \nproject construction activities are expected to be small in scale, with the possible involvement of \nlocal  people  in  construction  activities,  and  are  not  considered  to  pose  a  threat  to  the  existing \nsociocultural  system  of  indigenous  peoples.  No  tribal  lands  will  be  acquired  or  affected. \nTranche 2 might be classified category A, and tranche 3 is likely to be classified category B for \ninvoluntary  resettlement.  All  the  safeguard  documents  are  endorsed  by  the  government  and \ndisclosed in the ADB website.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\n25.
