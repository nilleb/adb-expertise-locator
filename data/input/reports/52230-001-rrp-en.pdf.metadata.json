The  project  loan  will  demonstrate \ninfrastructure transformation through the integration  of transport, building, energy, and climate-\nresilience  solutions,  complemented  by  information  and  knowledge  systems.  The  PBL  will \nreinforce the project through reforms and promote low-carbon behavior changes by creating an \nenabling  environment  with  appropriate  incentives.  The  XSDP  is  the  first  sector  development \nprogram in the PRC with integrated and multisector solutions.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nEconomic  performance  of the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and its  commitment  to \nclimate change. Since the PRC\u2019s economic reforms began in 1978, its gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth has averaged almost 10% a year, and more than 850 million people have been \nlifted out of poverty. Income inequality has improved but the PRC lags in labor productivity and \nhuman capital.2 Its high growth is based on energy- and resource-intensive manufacturing. Rapid \ngrowth has exceeded the pace of institutional development, which has led to economic, social, \nand  environmental  imbalances.  The  PRC  is  the  world\u2019s  largest  emitter  of  greenhouse  gases \n(GHG), so its engagement with climate change issues is necessary. The PRC is a signatory to \nthe  Paris  Agreement,  which  was  adopted  at  the  21st  Conference  of  the  Parties  to  the  United \nNations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change. As such, the PRC is committed to its \nnationally determined contribution, with the ambitious target to peak carbon emissions by 2030. \nWitnessing  rapid  urbanization  and  recognizing  the  strategic  role  that  cities  can  play  in  GHG \nreduction, the PRC implemented its Low-Carbon Cities Initiative (LCCI). The LCCI encourages \ncities  to  create  new  development  models  for  inclusive,  environmentally  sustainable,  and \nprosperous cities, and to share their learning. \n \n4. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessment indicated that real GDP contracted by \n6.8%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  compared  to  the  first  quarter  of  2019  due  to  the  coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic.3 The IMF predicted that domestic activity will recover from March \n2020 onward, projecting real GDP to grow at 1.2% in 2020 and at 9.2% in 2021 (footnote 3), while \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) predicted the GDP growth at 1.8% in 2020 and 7.4% in 2021.4 \n \n5. \nXiangtan\u2019s commitment to low-carbon development. Xiangtan is an old industrial city \nundergoing rapid urbanization and industrial transformation. It is located 40 kilometers (km) south \nof Hunan\u2019s capital, Changsha, and had a population of about 3 million and an urbanization rate \nof 62% in 2019. Situated within the Changsha\u2013Zhuzhou\u2013Xiangtan (CZT) city cluster, Xiangtan \nwith least population among them has been a key economic driver for Hunan province. Its growth \n\n \n\n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Detailed economic performance of the PRC is provided in the Fiscal and Debt Management Assessment (accessible \n\nfrom the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3   IMF Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). This letter refers to the PRC \n\nassessment letter for the Asian Development Bank, issued on 1 May 2020. \n\n4   ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook Supplement (June2020). Manila. \n\n \n\n\fhas also led to GHG emissions increasing by 4.5% per year during 2005\u20132016, reaching 39.69 \nmillion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e). Xiangtan has a higher GHG intensity \nper unit of GDP than the average for Hunan province or the PRC. In 2018 Xiangtan became a \nlow-carbon city under the LCCI and is committed to achieving carbon peaking by 2028 to localize \nthe  PRC\u2019s  nationally  determined  contribution  target.  The  XMG\u2019s  measures  to  reduce  carbon \nemissions have included allocation of financial support for industrial transformation, promotion of \nlow-carbon technologies, deployment of clean vehicles, expansion of a public bicycle program, \nrestoration of wetland and forests, and expansion of green areas.5 However, much more effort \nneeds  to  be  done  to  substantially  reduce  GHG  in  a  very  limited  time  frame  without  impacting \neconomic growth. \n \n6. \nXiangtan\u2019s development challenges. In 2016, GHG emissions in Xiangtan were from \nthe  following  sources:  industry  (52%),  energy  processing  (18%),  building  (12%),  agriculture \n(10%), transport (8%),  waste (1%),  and  carbon sink from  land-use  change and forestry  (1%).6  \nAs  part  of  its  industrial  transformation  support  by  policy,  the  XMG  has  closed  down  heavily \npolluting industrial plants and taken measures to attract high-tech, information and communication \ntechnology  (ICT),  and  research  and  development-oriented  industries.  Energy  and  resource-\nintensive industries remain as the critical economic drivers, but knowledge and technology-based \nindustries are expected to grow. Coal contributes to 96% of the energy source supplied to the grid \nfrom  Xiangtan.7  Solar  and wind  energy  resources  are limited  in  Xiangtan,  but  other  alternative \nenergy  sources,  particularly  industrial  waste  heat,  show  great  potential  to  transition  to  a  low-\ncarbon urban energy system. Emissions from the energy used in buildings grew by 330% during \n2005\u20132016, reflecting Xiangtan\u2019s rapid urbanization. As the total floor area of urban buildings is \nexpected  to  grow  further,  substantial  GHG  emissions  growth  is  expected  if  green  building \ninterventions are not in place. Emissions from transport increased by 400% from 2005 to 2016 \nand passenger car ownership increased by 467% during 2008\u20132018. The urban road network in \nXiangtan grew by 43% in 3 years to 500 km, and further expansion is planned. The use of public \ntransport in Xiangtan is low, and without transforming mobility patterns, transport emissions from \ngrowing number of private cars will continue to grow rapidly. Xiangtan has worked closely with \nChangsha and Zhuzhou for better cluster city planning while controlling urban sprawl.8 Xiangtan \nexperiences annual flood events that cause significant economic losses and distress.9 Recovery, \nreconstruction,  and  rehabilitation  of  infrastructure  and  systems  damaged  by  floods  require \nsubstantial  resources  and  energy,  resulting  in  additional  GHG  emissions.  Improved  flood \nresilience  of the city  will  avoid  such  GHG  increases.  The  XMG  initiated sponge city  works  but \nneeds better knowledge and capacity to integrate more progressive resilience measures into its \ncity development plan.  \n \n7. \nAsian Development Bank engagements and lessons. ADB has provided support on \nlow-carbon city development in the PRC through technical assistance (TA), knowledge-sharing \nevents,  and  publications.  ADB  provided  TA  to  Xiangtan  during  2015\u20132017  and  initiated  GHG \ninventory development, prepared a city profile covering sector performance and vulnerability to \n\n \n\n5  Public expenditure on initial low-carbon works was CNY951.6 million ($135 million) during 2017\u20132019. \n6  XMG. 2017. Xiangtan 2016 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory Report. (internal). \n7  The  Central  China  Grid  Co.  Ltd.  run  by  the  State  Grid  Corporation  of  China  covering  Chongqing,  Hunan,  Hubei, \nHenan, Jiangxi, and Sichuan provinces is fed by 55% coal, 42% hydro, and 3% wind and solar energy. Xiangtan\u2019s \nenergy supply to the grid is mainly coal, while others supply more renewable energy to the grid. \n\n8    Xiangtan  created  \u201cgreen  hearts\u201d  with  reforestation  to  control  city  expansion  using  the  compact  city  development \n\nprinciple; this increased the carbon sink capacity from zero in 2005 to 465 tCO2e in 2016. \n\n9  During 2011\u20132017, the total direct economic loss was CNY17 billion ($2.4 billion). These floods affected almost 2.4 \n\nmillion people, including 143,791 who needed relocation. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fclimate change, and provided in-depth assessment and recommendations.10 Two follow-up TA \nprojects  emphasized  the  critical  roles  of  local  experts  and  the  Hunan  Provincial  Government \n(HPG).11 Through extensive dialogues and discussions over two years, ADB carried out effective \nknowledge  transfer  and  supported  the  XMG  to  design  and  own  its  unique  low-carbon \ndevelopment  model.  The  program  incorporates  lessons  from  the  ADB-financed  TA  and  loan \nprojects in Xiangtan and the PRC, such as (i) ADB\u2019s knowledge transfer should be continued to \nempower  a  local  government  and  stakeholders  for  better  planning  and  development  of \ntransformative  measures;  (ii)  integrated  solutions  that  are  cost-effective  and  have  multiple \nbenefits should be strengthened to make visible impacts in GHG emission reductions and also \nmake a city livable; (ii) the wider use of smart technologies should be pursued as they can improve \nthe  operational  efficiency  and  generate  knowledge  for  continuous  improvement;  (iii)  climate \nadaptation  measures  are  equally  important  to  avoid  or  lessen  the  impacts  of  flooding  and \nassociated  losses;  (iv)  infrastructure  provision  alone  would  not  incentivize  the  change  of  low-\ncarbon behaviors and practice and secure the long-term low-carbon transformation.  \n \n8. \nChoice of modality. The XMG chose a sector development program modality because \nthe investment project will not be sustainable without having relevant reforms in place. The PBL \nis  necessary  to  create  low-carbon  norms,  reduce  sector  incoherency,  and  institutionalize  new \nways  of  doing  low-carbon  business.  As  well-designed  physical  infrastructure  can  make  low-\ncarbon  actions  easy,  and  information  and  knowledge  can  expand  low-carbon  know-how,  the \nproject loan will demonstrate integrated and multisector solutions to transform infrastructure and \ninstall ICT and knowledge platforms. The PBL will reinforce the project and ensure the replication \nand continuity of low-carbon transformations. \n \nThe XSDP is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.12 It is directly linked to the following \n9. \noperational  priorities:  (i)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality;  (ii)  tackling  climate  change, \nbuilding climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (iii) making \ncities more livable; and (iv) strengthening governance and institutional capacity. The XSDP also \nfollows  the  Strategy  2030  approaches  promoting  integrated  solutions,  multisector  approaches, \ndigital  development  and  technologies,  private  sector  participation,  and  innovative  features  for \nvalue addition. By combining all these approaches, the SDP exercises a differentiated approach \nto the PRC. The XSDP is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u2013\n2020  and  the  PRC\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020  to  support  more  inclusive  and \nenvironmentally sustainable growth.13 \n\n \n\n10. \nThe COVID-19 had significantly restrained economic activities in Xiangtan and led to the \nsudden  decrease  in  GHG  emissions.  With  the  lowering  of  COVID-19  related  risks,  economic \nactivities  have  been  slowly  resumed  in  Xiangtan  and  carbon  emissions  are  increasing  again.  \nBy  demonstrating \ninterlinked  solutions  across  physical \ninfrastructure and knowledge-based system provision, the XSDP will create a new green and low-\ncarbon growth model that is resilient to future shocks, while making the city more livable.   \n\nintegrated  and \n\ntransformative \n\n \n\n10  ADB. 2015.

The XSDP is also fully aligned with the G20 principles of quality infrastructure. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fProgram Description \n\nB. \n \n11. \nThe  XSDP  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  Xiangtan\u2019s  target  of  carbon  emission \npeaking by 2028 achieved. The XSDP will have the following outcome: use of low-carbon enabling \nsystems  in  Xiangtan  increased.  The  XSDP  will  have  four  outputs  based  on  Xiangtan\u2019s  GHG \nprofile, trends, structural challenges, and opportunities for effective carbon reduction. The project \nloan will support outputs 1, 2, and 3 and the PBL will support output 4. \n \nOutput  1:  Low-carbon  and  resilient  infrastructure  transformation  demonstrated. \n12. \nThrough the project, the XMG will transform the transport system from car-centered infrastructure \nto  people-centered  mobility  systems,  enhancing  safety,14  inclusiveness,15  and  resilience.  \nThe XMG will transform more than 60 km of urban roads by installing medians and peak-hour \ncurbside bus priority lanes; upgrading bus stops using safe, inclusive design; and providing digital \nbus information integrated with improved walking and cycling facilities for seamless access across \nmodes. The transformation of streets through layout changes, improved facilities, and ecosystem-\nbased  adaptation  (EBA)  measures  installed  will  demonstrate  how  streets  can function  as  both \nflood-mitigating measures and enjoyable urban living spaces.16 The XMG will modify the access \nlayout  at  two  railway  stations  using  enhanced,  user-friendly,  and  inclusive  design  to  facilitate \ntransitions  between  public  low-carbon  mobility  modes.  The  school  zone  transformation  at  five \nprimary schools will raise road safety awareness while exceeding the requirements for the highest \nsafety rating for walking and cycling under the International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP) \nStar Rating for Schools.17 The XMG will deploy clean energy buses equipped with inclusive and \ngender-sensitive features, and expand electric vehicle charging infrastructure. \n \nThe XMG will demonstrate building transformation integrated with advanced technologies \n13. \nand resilience measures. First, the XMG will construct a new hospital with integrated solutions of \npassive building  design;  water-saving  features; distributed  energy  systems  to  generate power, \nheating, and cooling; and intelligent building energy (and utility) management systems (BEMS). \nAs  it  is  located  in  a  flood-prone  zone,  the  new  hospital  will  be  equipped  with  extensive  EBA \nmeasures  for  flood resilience,  resulting  in  enhanced  resilience  capacity  compared  to the  PRC \nsponge city technical standards.18 Second, the XMG will retrofit an unused government building \nto  house  the  Asia  Low-Carbon  Training  Center,  showcasing  green  and  low-carbon  building \ntechniques.  With  support from the  HPG  and  the LCCI, the  XMG  will  run the  Asia  Low-Carbon \nTraining  Center  to  share  its  experience  on  low-carbon  transformations  and  to  support  the \nreplication  of  their  low-carbon  models  of  Xiangtan  in  other  cities  in  the  PRC  and  in  other \ndeveloping countries in Asia and the Pacific that share similar challenges.19 Both buildings (i.e., \nthe  hospital  and  the  Asia  Low-Carbon  Training  Center)  will  obtain  Excellence  in  Design  for \n\n \n\n14 Road safety, particularly for pedestrians and cyclists, is a critical factor in promoting low-carbon transportation. \n15 Inclusive design features include tactile paving on sidewalks and at bus stops; designated spaces and seats at bus \nstops; buses that can accommodate wheelchairs, prams, pregnant women, the elderly, and children; and wide curb \nramps and elevated crossings for seamless access for all residents. \n\n16 EBA with green and blue assets is an effective measure for flood control, drought mitigation, heat stress reduction, \nand carbon sink, with co-benefits like aesthetic quality, recreational capacity, better air quality, and health benefits. \n17  Safety  features  include  elevated  crossings,  curb  extensions,  extensive  signs,  and  road  markings  for  speed  and \npedestrian crossings. The iRAP provides tools to assess road safety and support safer road infrastructure for casualty \nreduction. iRAP. \n\n18 The 2014 sponge city construction technical guide in the PRC describes the volume capture ratio of annual rainfall \n(VCRa)  to  quantify  a minimum  storage volume  for drought.  The  VCRa  is  set  as  per  the  land use and ecological \ndamage sensitivity of a region. As Xiangtan has a VCRa of 75%\u201385%, the hospital was initially designed to have \n740 cubic meters of water detention capacity, but the capacity has since been increased to 6,000 cubic meters. \n19  The  program  team  is  preparing  a  publication  titled  Xiangtan  Climate  Actions  and  Low-Carbon  Transformation  to \n\nsupport knowledge sharing. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fGreater  Efficiencies  (EDGE)  certification  developed  by  the  International  Finance  Corporation \n(IFC), achieving more than 20% savings each in energy, the energy embedded in the buildings\u2019 \ndesign and materials, and water compared to the relevant PRC standards.20 Under this output, \nthe XMG will transform 20 aging urban communities into livable low-carbon exemplars.21 \n \n14. \nOutput 2: Information and knowledge platforms for informed decision-making and \nbehavioral changes enabled. The XMG will develop integrated urban catchment management \nplans and design for three identified flood-prone zones, which will enhance the XMG\u2019s climate \nresilient city planning knowledge and development.22 Also, the XMG will install, upgrade, and/or \nreprogram  several  sector  ICT  platforms  to  complement  output  1  and  provide  information \nnecessary  for  better  decision-making  and  actions.  Actions  under  output  2  will  include  the \nfollowing: \n(i) \n\nThe  intelligent  transport  system  will  be  reprogrammed  to  switch  its  main  purpose \nfrom  easing  car  congestion  to  enhancing  pedestrians\u2019  road  safety  and  prioritizing \nmass transportation over private vehicles.23 \n\n(ii)  A smart bus information platform will be installed for better operations and improved \n\npredictability for users. \n\n(iii)  A BEMS connecting 200 public buildings will be installed for operational efficiency \n\nand building energy data management. \n\n(iv)  A  community-scale  multi-energy  and  utility  management  system  will  be  installed \nconnecting more than 1,300 companies in an industrial zone to optimize operational \nefficiency and drive a culture of collaboration among companies within the zone.  \n\n(v)  An intelligent early flood warning system will be built for quick data processing and \nrapid forecasting to achieve early and improved flood response management. \n(vi)  A comprehensive environmental monitoring and assessment system (EMAS) will be \nintelligent  data  processing  and \n\ninstalled  with  automated  monitoring  and \nmanagement to support science-based decision-making.  \n\n(vii)  All these will be consolidated into an open and scalable citywide ICT platform that \n\ncan continuously expand with new functionalities.  \n\n \n15. \nOutput  3:  Capacity  building  and  program  management  enhanced.  The  XMG  will \nengage a program management consultant (PMC) firm consisting of highly experienced sector, \nsafeguards,  and  project  management  consultants  to  improve  the  XMG\u2019s  technical  expertise.  \nThe  PMC  firm  will  (i)  support  the  XMG  with  the  successful  implementation  of  the  XSDP,  and  \n\n \n\n20  EDGE  certification  and  its  online  platform  are  designed  to  determine  the  most  cost-effective  options  for  green \nbuildings. EDGE makes it easy to quantify savings, while the PRC\u2019s green building labeling system (using points) \ncannot  do so  in a  straightforward  manner.  EDGE  ensures more  than  20%  savings in  each  of  the  three  areas  of \nenergy, water, and materials savings compared to the relevant PRC standards. The PRC\u2019s 3-star (highest) green \nbuilding label cannot guarantee 20% savings in all three areas. Compared to the PRC building energy efficiency \nstandards, the new hospital has 26% energy savings and the retrofitted government building will have 23% energy \nsavings.  Two  EDGE-certified  building  cases  will  be  shared  globally  through  the  EDGE  and  Green  Building \nCertification Inc. websites. EDGE; and Green Business Certification Inc. \n\n21 Low-carbon and resilient features include building insulation, rooftop solar systems for hot water, light-emitting diode \nlighting,  e-bicycle  sharing,  EBAs  at  parking  lots,  drainage  improvement,  improved  streets  for  safer  walking  and \ncycling, and installation of natural gas for cooking. \n\n22 Three identified flood-prone zones are: (i) Railway station block, (ii) Yaowan Park, and (iii) Yangmeizhou Island. \n23  The  reprogramming,  which  does  not  require  additional  components  or  cost  increases,  will  include  the  following \nfeatures: pedestrian crossing lights will always be turned on, and self-optimized traffic lights will give green wave \n(priority) signals to buses. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f(ii)  implement  a  range  of  capacity  building  activities  so  the  XMG  can  sustain  its  low-carbon \ntransformations and successfully manage the Asia Low-Carbon Training Center in Xiangtan.24 \n \n16. \nOutput 4: Low-carbon transformation policy reforms adopted. Policy actions under \ntranche 1 and tranche 2 of the PBL are grouped into the following reform areas: (i) low-carbon, \nresilient, and smart city development strategy and policies issued; (ii) low-carbon mobility systems \nenhanced; and (iii) low-carbon energy and building systems enhanced. Tranche 1 has 11 policy \nactions and tranche 2 has 9 policy actions, which will reinforce outputs 1 and 2 and drive low-\ncarbon  innovations  and  system  transformation.  Under  the  first  reform  area,  the  Xiangtan  low-\ncarbon development plan, 2018\u20132030 (policy action 1) has set a clear vision and target for the \nXMG\u2019s  low-carbon  development.  The  plan  provides  clear  directions  on  sector  relevance  and \npriority  areas,  bind  the  responsibilities of  all the XMG  bureaus to plan  and  implement relevant \nlow-carbon works, institutionalize an integrated and holistic approach, and support cross-sector \ncollaboration  and  cooperation.  Policy  actions  on  sponge  city-promoting  EBA  measures  will \nadvance city resilience beyond the national sponge city standards (footnote 18). The policy action \non smart city development will highlight the integrated approach and cross-sector consolidation \nfor efficient use of public investment. Green procurement policy (GPP) actions, adopted for the \nfirst  time  in  the  PRC,  will  lower  GHG  emissions  in  the  public  sector;  generate  environmental, \nhealth,  and  economic  co-benefits;  and  develop  the  market  for  green  products  and  service \ninnovations.25  Under  the  second  and  third  reform  areas,  sector  policies  will  create  the  right \nincentives,  financing  models,  and  other  enabling  mechanisms  to  mobilize  private  sector \ninvestments and activate wide participation from all economic actors, including the public. Policy \nactions under tranche 1 focus on the XMG\u2019s policies, which include sector-specific plans.26 Policy \nactions under  tranche  2 will  include management  rules for  operational  reforms,  regulations for \nlow-carbon \ndeveloping  better \ntechnologies, and design guides to improve urban infrastructure that supports low-carbon actions \nand  practices  of  people,  and  an  improved  resilience  capacity.  By  August  2020,  all  the  policy \nactions under tranche 1 have been completed.  \n  \nC. \n \n17. \nThrough  early  involvement  at  the  concept  stage,  ADB  helped  the  XMG  to  define  low-\ncarbon  development,  highlighting  \u2018system  thinking\u2019  with  holistic  and  integrated  approaches \ncorrecting  the  siloed  development  of  each  sector.27  ADB  assisted  the  XMG  in redesigning  the \nproject and selecting an effective loan modality considering the XMG\u2019s challenges and ambitious \ncarbon peaking target. ADB supported the XMG (i) in developing appropriate and well-articulated \nincentive  mechanisms  to  activate  all  stakeholders  for  low-carbon  decisions  and  behavior \nchanges; and (ii) in creating effective policies (a) to mobilize domestic financing and private sector \ninvestment in low-carbon businesses, and (b) to stimulate the market for low-carbon products and \n\nincentive  mechanisms, \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\ntechnical  standards \n\nto  promote \n\n \n\n24 Capacity building activities include trainings on integrated city planning, compact and transit-oriented development \nplanning,  bus  priority  and  traffic  light  system  integration  and  operation,  EDGE  tools,  district  energy  systems, \noperation  of  a  range  of  ICT  platforms,  GHG  inventory  and  calculation,  procurement,  financial  management,  and \nsafeguards. \n\n25  GPPs  institutionalize  the  process  of  public  authorities  in  procuring  goods,  services,  and  works  that  lower  GHG \nemissions and other negative environmental impacts when compared to goods, services, and works with the same \nprimary functions that would otherwise be procured. \n\n26 These sector-specific plans describe mandates and institutional reforms at the bureau and provide rationale to secure \n\nappropriate budget and human resources for the relevant works. \n\n27 Low-carbon development refers to sustainable development grounded in systems thinking and guided by quantifiable \nindicators  of  GHG  emissions.  This  type  of  development  encourages  integrated  city  planning,  collaborative  and \ncoherent  sector  development,  resilience  improvement  by  taking  a  preventive  approach,  and  active  governance \nthrough engaging and activating all stakeholders by providing the right incentives. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\finnovations through TA.28 ADB engaged (i) an iRAP assessor to evaluate the road safety in five \nschool  zones  and  to  recommend  safety  features;  (ii)  green  building  and  energy  experts  to \nredesign two buildings to secure EDGE certification; and (iii) climate adaptation experts to develop \nthe Xiangtan Climate Resilient City Toolbox (XCRCT), a customized touch-table and web-based \nplatform.  Using  the  XCRCT,  ADB  facilitated  collaborative  planning  among  the  XMG\u2019s  bureaus \nand the consensus-based selection of EBA measures for the project. ADB engaged GPP experts \nto support the XMG with GPP training and policy drafting, which led to the XMG\u2019s commitment to \nadopt GPP. \n \n18. \nDevelopment partner coordination and collaboration. The XSDP benefits from past \nand ongoing coordination and collaboration with development partners and other organizations, \nincluding  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW,  ICLEI  \u2013  Local  Governments  for \nSustainability, IFC, the United Nations (UN), and the World Bank.29 IFC provided several rounds \nof training on EDGE, which led to the XMG\u2019s commitment to achieving EDGE certification for new \nand retrofitted buildings under the project loan. Through coordination with the UN and ICLEI \u2013 \nLocal  Governments  for  Sustainability,  the  XMG  and  the  HPG  received  GPP  training.30  ADB \ncarried out additional due diligence on the XMG\u2019s fiscal management sustainability with support \nfrom the HPG and the World Bank. \n \nD. \n \n19. \n$150.00 million for the project and $50.00 million for the PBL. \n \n\nThe  XSDP  is  estimated  to  cost  $395.88  million  (Table  1),  of  which  ADB  will  provide \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs, Investment Cost Estimates, and Financing Plan  \n\nTable 1: Summary Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n\nOrdinary capital resources (policy-based loan) \nOrdinary capital resources (project loan) \n\nGovernmenta \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n \n\n50.00 \n150.00 \n195.88 \n395.88 \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n\nShare of \nProject (%) \n\n \n\n12.63 \n37.89 \n49.48 \n100.00 \n\n \n \n\n43.37 \n56.63 \n100.00 \n\na Government counterpart funding applies only to the project loan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n20. \nDevelopment financing needs and plan.

These districts have not officially adopted GPP. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nTo achieve the successful demonstration of Xiangtan\u2019s low-carbon development model, \n21. \npolicy  reforms  are  equally  important  as  infrastructure  investment.  Under  the  PRC\u2019s  highly \nregulated public finance framework, the public finance budget of a local government is funded \nmostly by local taxes and fees, and its deficit is covered by the central government\u2019s tax rebates \nand transfers. Infrastructure investment under the government fund budget can be funded by land \nuse revenues, bonds, and foreign loans. Expenditure for additional reforms like the XMG\u2019s low-\ncarbon  development  policy  reforms  becomes  a  financing  gap.31  In  2020,  the  XMG\u2019s  financing \nneeds are estimated to be CNY10.5 billion, of which 55% is derived from the consolidated fiscal \ndeficit and 45% results from the amortization payments of maturing liabilities. The PBL component \nreflects  the  XMG\u2019s  overall  financing  needs, the strength  of the  policy  reform  package,  and  net \neconomic  benefits  of  the  government  reform  agenda.  For  2020,  the  government\u2019s  total  gross \nborrowing  requirement  is  estimated  at  CNY5.5  billion  ($780.0  million).  To  meet  the  financing \ndemand, the government plans to raise about CNY5.1 billion ($730.0 million) from the issuance \nof securities, and about CNY352.0 million ($50.0 million) from official foreign loans.

A  flexible \ndistrict energy system at the EDGE-certified hospital is considered the best technical and most \nfinancially viable option to ensure sustainable operations regardless of power outages. The EBA \nmeasures that are extensively incorporated in the project streets and in the hospital have sufficient \nwater retention and detention capacity and generate environmental co-benefits. The open and \nflexible architecture of the Smart City ICT Platform, which can consolidate all sector-based ICT \nplatforms  and  add  new  functionality,  is  a  resource-efficient  and  technically  viable  solution  for \nsmart city development. \n \nB. \n \n25. \nEconomic  analysis.  To  conduct  the  economic  analysis,  the  economic  benefits  arising \nfrom  the  project  were  grouped  into  four  categories:  urban  transport,  flood  prevention,  energy \nsavings, and the hospital. The PBL is intended to have a range of effects covering all aspects of \nthe project loan and beyond. The project team did not conduct a separate economic analysis for \nthe PBL since its impact is interdependent with that of the project loan and will be captured through \nthe project benefits. The economic analysis shows that all benefit categories are  economically \nviable, with energy savings having the highest economic internal rate of return, followed by flood \nprevention.  The  economic  internal rate  of  return for  the  overall  program  is  14.6%,  and the  net \npresent value at a 9.0% discount rate is $163.1 million. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the \nprogram will maintain its economic viability under most plausible scenarios. \n \nFinancial  analysis.  The  financial  analysis  was  carried  out  following  ADB  guidelines.33  \n26. \nAll project components are nonrevenue generating, and thus the analysis focuses on the financial \nsustainability of the project. The financial sustainability analysis assessed the financial capacity \nof  the  XMG  to  cover  the  incremental  recurrent  costs,  including  operation  and  maintenance \nexpenditures required to ensure the sustainability of the project. The fiscal analysis showed that \nthe  total  project  incremental  costs  will  have  a  negligible  impact  on  the  budget  of  the  XMG, \nconfirming the project\u2019s sustainability.34 \n \nC. \n \n27. \nThe sustainability of the XSDP is supported by a solid institutional setup at the XMG as \nthe PMO is led by the secretary-general of XMG who is directly reporting to the Xiangtan Mayor, \nand  has  full-time  designated  staff  from  all  the  relevant  bureaus  as  PMO  members;  close \ninvolvement of the HPG as an oversight and supervision authority since the SDP concept stage; \nand  the  following  measures  to  improve  sustainability  of  the  project.  The  design  of  the  XSDP \nincorporates cost-recovery and revenue-generation aspects by enhancing energy and resource-\nefficient measures and technologies under the project. The XSDP also includes policy actions, \n\nSustainability \n\n33 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 The impact of the incremental costs from 2021 to 2045 is estimated to be 0.14%\u20131.52% of the XMG\u2019s annual fiscal \n\n \n\nrevenue. \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\ncreating a range of market-oriented fees and charges that generate revenue, improve the quality \nof public services, and direct low-carbon behavior.35  \n \n28. \nThe XMG remains committed to low-carbon transformation and will support other cities to \nreplicate  a  low-carbon  city  model  through  the  establishment  of  the  Asia  Low-Carbon  Training \nCenter. The fiscal and debt management assessment that was carried out as part of the XSDP\u2019s \ndue diligence concluded that the XMG\u2019s public finances, including debt service obligations, are \nsustainable in the medium to long term.36 The debt service-to-revenue ratio is projected to decline \nfrom 48% in 2016\u20132018 to 35% by 2030. The project will have a limited impact on  the XMG\u2019s \nfiscal and debt position; the XMG\u2019s debt position remains sustainable and debt service obligations \ncontinue to be affordable. The analysis (footnote 36) covered projections for 2019\u20132030 and was \npredicated upon the XMG\u2019s current fiscal and debt policies, the HPG\u2019s debt management strategy, \nand ADB\u2019s estimates of economic growth in Xiangtan city. COVID-19 could deteriorate the short-\nterm prospects for economic growth in Xiangtan and the fiscal revenue of the XMG, but it is not \nexpected to affect the medium- to long-term prospects,37 as confirmed by the IMF (footnote 3). \n \nD. \n \n29. \nThe ADB program team carried out the financial management and procurement capacity \nassessments  per  ADB  requirements.  The  overall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  is \nassessed as satisfactory, with the XMG capable of funds flow arrangements, staffing, accounting, \nfinancial reporting systems, internal and external auditing arrangements, and financial information \nsystems. The overall financial management risk rating of the project without mitigating measures \nis moderate. The program team conducted strategic procurement planning to ensure that fit-for-\npurpose procurement approaches are developed  to achieve value for money and the project\u2019s \ndevelopment  objectives.  The  overall  procurement  risk  is  moderate  and  relevant  mitigation \nmeasures are in the risk assessment and risk management plan.38 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the XMG. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. To enhance procurement \ncapacity,  the  XMG  initiated  the  engagement  process  of  a  qualified  and  experienced tendering \nagency  for  procurement  support.  Qualified  staff  from  relevant  bureaus  were  designated  in the \nPMO. The PMC firm will provide continuous hands-on project management support and capacity \nbuilding training to the PMO staff and other relevant government staff. \n \nE. \n \nThe project will benefit an urban population of about 1.08 million, including 16,171 poor \n30. \npeople (of whom 7,223 are female, 1,161 elderly, and 2,273 disabled) through (i) enhanced quality \nof bus service and customer satisfaction with improved trunk roads, feeder roads, bus stops, and \nnew  electric  buses;  (ii)  safer  travel  and  inclusive  access  for  pedestrians  and  cyclists  through \nimproved  bikeways  and  sidewalks;  and  (iii)  reduced  economic  losses  with  increased  flood-\n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n \n\n35  Advanced  technologies and measures  to  improve  resource  and  energy  efficiency at  the  hospital  will significantly \nlower the operational costs. The XMG will introduce the following policy actions: (i) vehicle parking fees in Xiangtan, \n(ii) demand-driven bus services (e.g., a peak-hour express bus) with increased bus fares, (iii) new neighborhood bus \nservices, and (iv) market-based shared bicycle fees with upgraded bicycle services. \n\n36 Fiscal and Debt Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 While the COVID-19 pandemic may impact on the economic activity and taxes collected, its effects are likely to be \nrestricted to late 2019 and 2020, thus implying a downward risk for the short-term outlook underpinning the baseline \nscenario. No effects are to be expected in the medium to long term. The baseline scenario\u2019s projections extending \nfor more than a decade still hold despite the short-term effect of the pandemic. \n\n38 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fresilient measures. The new hospital will be flood resilient and will provide uninterrupted services \nduring  flooding  events.  Low-carbon  and  resilient  features  in  20  aging  urban  communities  will \nprovide a cleaner, greener, safer, and more livable environment to 179,806 residents, including \n88,530 female, 49,616 elderly, and 3,672 poor residents. The project will create more than 2,000 \njob opportunities during construction and more than 700 during operation. Indirectly, the program \nwill promote economic growth and related employment generation. \n \n31. \nGender. The project is categorized some gender elements. Even though surveys done \nduring the program due diligence show no significant difference between males and females on \ndistance,  frequency,  and  mode  choice  of  travel,  females  are  more  worried  about  road  safety, \nparticularly children\u2019s safety. Older females, or those escorting children or the elderly, expressed \ntheir concern on safe and easy access to sidewalks and road crossings. Females are much more \nconscious  about  energy,  water,  and  gas  savings  as  well  as  low-carbon  practices,  but  show  a \nlower level of survey participation. The majority of the female respondents support the project, as \nit will enhance their quality of life through an improved urban environment and the generation of \njob opportunities. The XMG developed the social and gender action plan and will implement it to \nensure  women\u2019s  participation  in  public  hearings;  awareness  raising;  and  public  consultations \nrelated to the program, targeting at least 40% women\u2019s participation.39 The XMG will engage a \nsocial  and  gender  development  consultant  as  a  part  of  the  PMC  firm  to  support  the  XMG  in \nimplementing and monitoring gender-sensitive actions. \n \nF. \n \n32. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  XMG  prepared  an  initial  environmental  examination \n(IEE),  including  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  per  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009).  Construction  dust,  noise,  wastewater,  and  solid  wastes;  community  and \nworker\u2019s health and safety risks; and traffic disruptions will be the primary adverse impacts during \nconstruction. Potential negative operation phase impacts include air pollution, noise, wastewater, \nand  waste.  As  they  are  short  term  and  localized,  good  construction  practices  and  measures \nindicated in the EMP will reduce impacts to acceptable levels. The XMG will establish a project-\nspecific  grievance  redress  mechanism.  The  XMG  has  committed  to  implementing  the  EMP, \ngrievance  redress  mechanism,  and  relevant  training,  with  support  from  a  loan  implementation \nenvironment  consultant.  Despite  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  XMG  carried  out  consultations \nusing  a  popular  social  network  application  and  the  XMG  will  conduct  in-person  public \nconsultations during implementation.40 The XMG prepared the environmental impact matrix of the \npolicy  actions  under  the  PBL  and  included  in  the  IEE,  confirming  no  adverse  environmental \nimpacts. The program team disclosed the IEE and EMP on the ADB website on 17 April 2020.  \nAs  the  climate  risk  screening  was  medium,  the  program  team  performed  a  climate  risk  and \nvulnerability assessment confirming that the increased rainfall intensity of individual storm events \nmay result in peak flows with flood risks to Xiangtan, particularly in areas with insufficient drainage \ncapacity. The program team conducted a more detailed risk assessment on pluvial flooding and \nfed into the XCRCT.41 The XCRCT was used for the project design as it allows users to select \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n39 The social and gender action plan is included in the PAM. It includes an action that gives priority to qualified female \n\ndrivers over male drivers for new positions. \n\n40  The  XMG  bureaus  and  offices  reached  out  through  a  social  network  application  and  obtained  more  than  1,000 \nresponses  from  project-affected  people,  satisfying  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements  on  meaningful \npublic consultation. \n\n41  It  included  analysis  of  flood  hazards,  topography  analysis,  land  use  assessment,  and  damage  sensitivity;  and \nassessment of the required retention, detention, and/or storage capacity against floods. The Xiangtan pluvial flood \nhazards map was developed for a rainstorm with a 100-year return period. \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\fspecific  EBA  interventions  in  specific  areas  immediately,  and  to  see  the  estimated  resilience \ncapacity improvement and the associated costs. \n \n33. \nInvoluntary resettlement  (category C)  and indigenous peoples (category C).  Land \nrequired for the construction of the hospital (80.03 mu) and the Liwei Substation (8.03 mu) was \nacquired  by  the  XMG  for  local  area  development  in  2017  and  2013,  respectively  without \nanticipating ADB financing. Due diligence confirmed that there is no outstanding or legacy issue \non the land allocated for the project. Other components will not induce any physical or economic \ndisplacement. The population of scattered ethnic minorities in Xiangtan municipality accounts for \n0.49% of the total municipal population. The program will benefit all residents and will not have \ndifferential impacts on any specific ethnic minority communities that will trigger ADB\u2019s indigenous \npeoples\u2019  policy  requirements.  For  the  PBL,  the  safeguards  assessment  confirmed  that  policy \nactions will not result in involuntary resettlement or impacts on indigenous peoples\u2019 communities. \nOn 17 April 2020, the program team disclosed the social safeguard due diligence report on the \nADB website, including the safeguards assessment matrix. \n \nImpacts  on  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  program  team  used  the  integrated \n34. \nassessment models presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change after being \nscaled down for Xiangtan to develop the worst-case and best-case GHG trajectories for 2020\u2013\n2045. In the first year after project completion, GHG emissions reduction will be more than 337 \nkilotons of carbon dioxide equivalent (ktCO2e). Combining the project and the PBL will lead to a \nreduction of more than 770 ktCO2e in 2026. The total amount of GHG reduction over the project \nlifetime to 2045 will be more than 7 MtCO2e with an annual average of 378 ktCO2e. During the \nprogram  lifetime  to  2045,  total  GHG  reduction  will  be  more  than  48  MtCO2e  with  an  annual \naverage of  2.4  MtCO2e. The  project  will  contribute  5%  and  the  combined project  and  PBL  will \ncontribute 29% to the required cumulative abatement.42  \n \nG. \n \n35. \nSignificant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. All other risks and \nmitigation measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.43 \n \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nRisks \nThe COVID-19 pandemic impacts \non the local economy, public fiscal \nmanagement, and the XMG\u2019s \npriorities \nLack of experience in undertaking \nprocurement, consultant \nrecruitment, and disbursement \nprocedures using ADB guidelines \nand policies \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigation Measures \nThe implementation schedule has been adjusted. The XMG will \nclosely communicate with ADB to discuss priority measures \nrelating to COVID-19 impacts on people\u2019s livelihoods and \npotential impacts on program implementation. \nADB provided training on the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, \nas amended from time to time) and procedures from the Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) \nduring project processing and will continue during \nimplementation. The XMG will engage highly qualified \npersonnel with experience in relevant policies and procedures  \n\n \n\n42 Including  the  methodology  and  models,  the  program  team  prepared  the  following:  Xiangtan  Greenhouse  Gas \nEmissions  Scenarios  and  Program  Impacts  Analysis;  Xiangtan  Greenhouse  Gas  Calculation  Summary  (Excel); \nXiangtan Low-Carbon Transport Greenhouse Gas Calculation Model (Excel); Xiangtan District Heating Greenhouse \nGas Calculation Model (Excel); and Xiangtan Green Building Greenhouse Gas Calculation Model (Excel) (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The program team shared and discussed the modeling results and \nGHG calculation with the XMG, helping the XMG reassess the carbon peaking commitment and monitor the low-\ncarbon development progress. \n\n43 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nRisks \n \n\nInadequate technical knowledge to \noperate clean energy and BEMS at \nthe hospital \n\nMitigation Measures \nof ADB or other multilateral development banks prior to program \neffectiveness. \nXMG will outsource the operation and maintenance of clean \nenergy systems\u2014such as trigeneration (combined cooling, \nheating, and power) systems, solar PV systems, and BEMS\u2014to \nan experienced energy service contractor. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, BEMS = building and utility energy management systems, COVID-19 = coronavirus \ndisease, PV = photovoltaic, XMG = Xiangtan Municipal Government.  \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \nThe  government  and  the  XMG  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  program \n36. \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  requirements,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  financial  management,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents.
