INTRODUCTION\n2.\t The Bank's Economic-cum-Reconnaissance Mission\nwhich visited Bangladesh in November-December 1972 noted that\nthe power sector needed expansion and development and that it\nwarranted further detailed investigation. Accordingly, a\nFact-Finding Mission visited Bangladesh in March 1973 and\nidentified a priority project for the augmentation of electrical\nenergy availability in Eastern Bangladesh by the installation\nof a gas turbine. Subsequently, an Appraisal Mission visited\nBangladesh from 8 Nay to 22 May 1973. A Supplementary Appraisal\nMission visited Bangladesh to follow-up a number of items\ninitiated by the previous Mission. Formal negotiations were\nheld in Manila on 5 and 6 September 1973 with representatives\nof the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh and\nthe Bangladesh Power Development Board, the designated Execu-\nting Agency of the Project. If approved, the proposed Project\nwill be the third Bank-financed project in Bangladesh for which\nloan financing has been executed by the Bank.\n110 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE\n3.\t The main features of the proposed loans are as\nfollows:\nBorrower\t : People's Republic of Bangladesh\nExecuting Agency\t : Bangladesh Power Development Board", "-2-\nPurpose\t : To finance the foreign exchange\ncost of construction of a 40 MW\ngas turbine power plant at\nBheramara and associated\nequipment\nAmount\t : The equivalent in various cur-\nrencies of $l0.45 million to be\nprovided as follows:\n(i) $1.20 million equivalent\nfrom the ordinary capital\nresources of the Baik.\n(ii) $9.25 million equivalent\nfrom the Special Funds\nresources of the Bank.\nPeriod of\nUtilization Until 31 December 1975 (assuming\nthat this permits 1 year warranty)\nTerms and\nAmortization (i) for the loan from the\nordinary capital reso1.-ces:\n20 years including a grace\nperiod of 4 years; and\n(ii) for the loan from the Special\nFunds resources:\n40 years including a grace\nperiod of 10 years.\nPrincipal, interest and other\ncharges are payable semi-annually.\nCommitment Charge,\n!nterest, and\nCommission (i) for the loan from the\nordinary capital resources:", "-3-\n3/4 of I per cent commit-\nment charge and interest\nrate of 7-1/2 per cent per\nannum (including commission)\n(ii) for the loan from the\nSpecial Funds resources:\n1 per cent interest\n(including service fee)\n4. Technical assistance in an amount not exceeding\n$250,000 is also proposed to be given on grant basis to the\nPeople's Republic of Bangladesh and the Bangladesh Power  Deve-\nlopment Board for assisting the latter in the improvement of\nthe management, financial and accounting systems.\nIII. ThE PROJECT\n5. An Appraisal Report entitled \"Appraisal of the\nBangladesh West Zone Power Project't (Report No. BAN:Ap-3) is\ncirculated herewith.\n6. The development of the power sector in Bangladesh\nbegan in the 1960's, mainly to support the  industrializaticn\nefforts under the Second and Third Five-Year Plans of the then\nEast Pakistan. The power system in Bangladesh is divided into\ntwo separate networks, namely, the East Zone and the West Zone,\ndivided by the Ganges-Brahxnaputra river system. Of the 546 MW\ncapacity available, or shortly to be available when a current\nrepair program is completed (the system suffered considerable\ndamage during the events of 1971), about 50 per cent is steam\nturbine powered, 25 per cent gas turbine, 15 per cent hydropower\nand 10 per cent diesel units. The steam and gas turbines in\nthe East Zone rely on piped natural gas for their fuel from\nnortheastern Bangladesh.\n7. During 1962-1970, the maximum demand for power grew\nat an average rate of 16 per cent per annum. The expansion of\ngeneration facilities however, increased at a rate of 23 per\ncent per annum during this period thus resulting in excess gene-\nrating capacity in the country as a whole. While the growth in", "demand in the West has been at a higher rate (20 per cent)\nthan in the East, the additions to the generating capacity,\non the other hand, increased at a slower pace. Consequently,\nthe growth in demand in the West Zone exceeded the available\nfirm capacity.\n8. Peak demand in both the zones is approaching the\npre-1971 levels. In the East Zone, the firm generating\ncapacity (380 MW) is well in excess of present demand; in\nthe West Zone, however, even the present peak demand of\n45 MW cannot be met by the existing firm capacity of 43 MW\nStudies have been made on the feasibility of 230 kV trans-\nmission line to interconnect the East and the West Zones;\nthe interconnector presents formidable technical problems.\nIt is accordingly envisaged that, for sometime to come, the\ntwo zones will continue as independent units. It is also\nestimated that maximum demand in the West Zone will increase\nat an average annual rate of 17 per cent from 1972/73 to\n1980/81, with the rate rising sharply in the early 1970's\nas pent up demands are met and tapering off to 10 per cent\nper annum later in the period. Increased generating capa-\ncity for the West Zone, is, therefore, urgently required..\nIn the East Zone, however, investment in generation capa-\ncity is not immediately needed.\n9. The power development program for the First\nFive-Year Plan (1973/74 to 1977/78) is under preparation.\nThe major thrust of this plan, aside from the reconstruc-\ntion and rehabilitation of works, will be to provide better\nbalance between the generating and distribution facilities\nin the power system. The five-year investment in the power\nsector is estimated at Tk. 4,235 million ($581 million).\n10. The proposed Project consists of the following:\n(i) a 40 MW gas turbine station to be installed at\nBheramara in the West Zone; (ii) spare parts for the\nexisting gas turbine installation at Khulna; (iii) sub-\nstation and communication equipment to permit the effective\noperation of the Project station on the West Zone Grid;\nand (iv) consultant and training services for project\nimplementation. The total cost of the Project is estimated\nat $17.5 million including a foreign exchange component of\n$10.45 million and a local currency component of $7.05\nmillion. The local costs of the Project will be met by\nthe Government.", "-5-\n11. The technical aspects of the Project have been\nthoroughly reviewed by the Mission, in consu1taticn with the\nBangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), and the size,\ntype and location of the gas turbine units proposed provide\nthe least cost and technically the most appropriate solution\nto the additional generation facilities required0 The cost\nestimates for the Project are realistic0 The BPDB staff will\nbe assisted and supported by consultants in the implementa\ntion of the Project and in the training of staff in the use\nof the new facilities. The Bank's Guidelines for Procurement\nfor goods and consultant services will be followed, with the\nexception of the procurement of spare parts (amounting to\n$250,000) of the existing gas turbines which must come from\nthe original manufacturer (Fiat of Italy).\n12. The Project will help the West Zone ystem meet the\nprojected load growth, permit the more orderly and efficient\nuse of other generation facilities by supplying peaking and\nstand-by capacity, and provide industries in the West Zone\n(which account for more than two-thirds of the load with a\nreliable and adequate supply of energy. The economic rate of\nreturn on the Project is estimated at 12 per cent. The Project\nalso has important technical benefits in that it will improve\nreliability of the system in the West Zone and provide greater\nflexibility in its operations.\n13. BPDB will be the Executing Agency for the Project.\nBPDB was established in 1972 by the President's Order No 59\nof 1972 reconstituting the former East Pakistan Water and\nPower Development Authority (EPWAPDA) into two distinct and\nindependent entities, namely, Water Development Board and\nPower Development Board. BPDB is a statutory corporate body\nwhich functions under the close supervision of the Ministry\nof Pow2r, Flood Control and Water Resources. BPDB is res-\npceible for planning and operation of all power facilities\nin Bangladesh; it is governed by a Board consisting of a\nchairman and not more than five members, all of whom are\nappointed by the Government. The Minister for Power, Flood\nControl and Water Resources is the Chairman and the Secretary\nof the said Ministry is also a member. There are at present\nthree full-time members of the Board: for administration,\nengineering and finance.", "-6-\n14. BPDB has certain operating problems. The supply of\npower to consumers has been erratic and unreliable, the coinpila-\ntion of necessary records and data on operations is delayed in\nthe head office, and systems planning has been weak and has\ncontributed to the creation of substantial excess generating\ncapacity. BPDB (and its predecessor organizations) has under-\ngone In the last ten years a period of rapid growth which has\nincluded the incorporation of many smaller less efficient\nutilities under its organization, as well as the commissioning\nof larger new generating un in the systems. Moreover, BPDB\nreliance in the past for external financial and technical\nassistance on ten bilateral donors has presented a formidable\nproblem of coordination to he organization.\n15. The operating rules and regulations of BPDB are still\nunder preparation and fr the present, former EPWAPDA rules and\nregulations are relied upon. The Government has also to finalize\nthe basic policy regarding the organizational set up and the\nresponsibilities of entities such as BPDB. The Bangladesh\nGovernment recognizes these problems. It is in evidence that\nit has taken action in some areas andas other remedial measures\nunder consideration. The Government has requested that the\nBank provide a suitable senior expert, experienced in the\noperation and management of electric utilities, to help BPDB\nin initiating and implementing such organizational and manage-\nment reforms that are being considered and/or would be necessary.\n16. The financial position of BPDB, which was rargina1\nprior to 1971, has been weakendconsiderab1y as a result of\nthe events of 1971/72, devaluation, domestic inflation, and\nrising depreciation and interest charges. BPDB and the Govern-\nment have agreed that the Bank should provide technical assist-\nance consisting of a team of consultants specialized in electric\nutility accounting and finance to review and initiate implemen-\ntation of measures to improve the accounting system; revalue\nthe assets and reconstruct the current accounts of BPDB; examine\nspecial aspects of its systems and prGcdures; and prepare\nfinancial projections, under alternative assumptions for the\ncoming decade. This work will provide a sound basis for con-\nsultations between the Bank, EPDB and the Government regarding\nsuitable measures to be taken including a raticnalization of\ntariff structure to nabie BPDB to operate on a sound financial\nbasis.", "-7-\n17. The Project is technically feasible and economically\njustified and is suitable for Bank financing. In view of the\nunprecedented setbacks recently experienced by the Bangladesh\neconomy and the weak balance of payments position of the country,\nthe Mission considers financing on concessional terms justified.\nThe loan from Bangladesh Fisheries Development (Loan No. 129-BAN\nSF) made earlier in 1973 had a grant element of about 60 per cent.\nHowever, in the light of the case that Bangladesh has for more\nconcessional terms due to its very difficult economic situation,\na grant element of 64 per cent is judged appropriate. In this\nspecific Project, hciwever,procurement considerations and the\nindivisibility of the major project component, the gas turbine\nstation, has meant that the blend from Special Funds and ordinary\nresources required results in grant element of 74 per cent. In\norder to maintain the desired overall grant element of 64 per\ncent for Bangladesh under the Sre cial Funds Supplementation\nScheme recently adopted by the Bank, the grant element for this\nProject (74 per cent) has been compensated for in the (separately)\nproposed Chittagong Port Project which has a grant element of\n49 per cent.\n18. The Mission recommends that under the Special Funds\nSupplementation Scheme, a loan for $9.25 million from Special\nFunds resources and a loan of $1.20 million from ordinary capital\nresources be provided. The loan from Special Funds would be at\n1 per cent interest, 40-year term including a 10-year grace period;\nthe loan from ordinary capital resources would be 7-1/2 per cent\ninterest, 20-year term includinga 4.-year grace period. It is also\nrecommended that the services of the management, accounting and\nfinancial consultants \nbe provided to BPDB in the form of a grant\nof $250,000 since this advisory technical assistance is for the\npurpose of strengthening the institutional and financial aspects\nof BPDB.\nIV. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUThORITIES\n19. Drafts of the following loan and technical assistance\ndocuments are circulated herewith:\n(i) Loan Agreement (Ordinary Operations)\nbetween the Government of the Pop1e's\nRepublic of Bangladesh and the Bank;", "-8-\n(ii) Loan Agreement (Special Operations)\nbetween the Government of the People's\nRepublic of Bangladesh and the Bank;\n(iii) Project Agreement (Ordinary and Special\nOperations) between the Bank and BPDB;\n(iv) Side Letters Nos. 1-5; and\n(v) Technical Assistance Agreement between\nthe Government of the People's Republic\nof Bangladesh, BPDB and the Bank.\nThe Bank's Loan Regulations No. 1 dated 28 November 1967 are\nincorporated in the draft Loan Agreement (Ordinary Operations)\nsubject to the modifications referred to in Section 1.01. of\nthe draft Ln Agreement (Ordinary Operations). The Bank's\nSpecial Operations Loan Regulations dated 6 May 1969 are in-\ncorporated in the draft Loan Agreement (Special Operations),\nsubject to the modifications referred to in Section 1.01 of\nthe draft Lcan Agreement (Special Operations).\n20. Under the Constitution of the People's Republic\nof Bangladesh, the Government is authorized to borrow from\nthe Bank. Under the BPDB Order, BPDB is empowered to enter\ninto and implement its obligations under the Project Agreement.\nV. ThE ECONOMY\n21. A Report entitled \"Economic Report on Bangladesh\"\n(BAN:Ec-1) had been circulated to the Board in February 1973.\n22. Bangladesh, with 75 million people and a per capita\nincome of around $70 is one of the world's most densely popula-\nted countries. More tha 80 per cent of the population is\ndependent on agriculture which accotints for 55 per cent of the\nGross Domestic Product (GDP). Agricultural productivity,\nspecially for the !najor crop -- rice -- is very low; about\none-third of the world average.", "23. During the 1960's, while rice production increased\nat an average annual rate of 2 per cent, population grew by\n3 per cent. The result has been a steadily increasing gap\nbetween rice production and requirements0 The cyclone of 1970\nand the events of 1971 resulted in substantial declines in\nagricultural output. The disruption in transport and distri-\nbution of inputs, coupled with drought, affected the major\n(Axnan) rice crop (July-September) in 1972. This has widened\nthe earlier estimated gap in food supplies in 1972/73 from\n2.5 million tons to about 3.0 million tons. Jute production,\nhowever, was at a satisfactory level,\n24. The manufacturing sector contributes about 9 per\ncent of GDP. Two-thirds of industry is agro-based, Jute\nand cotton textiles provide employment for about half the\ntotal industrial labor force. Jute and cotton textiles are\nby far the most important industries, in terms of value-added,\nemployment and foreign exchange earnings. Sugar, tea proces\nsing, tobacco, and leather are some of the other established\nindustries. In the latter half of 1960's, plants for produc-\ntion of fertilizer, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, cement,\npaper, steel, and engineering goods and a petroleum refinery\nwere set up. Except for natural gas, Bangladesh has no signi-\nficant proven mineral deposits.\n25. A major problem seems to be the rapidly rising\nprices. During the last 12 months, the cost of living has\nincreased by 60 per cent, which is at least 100 per cent above\nthe 1969/70 level. Failure of the major Aman crop in 1972,\nand the non-realization of about 70 per cent of the planned\ngovernment revenue collection during June-December 1972 with\nthe consequent reliance on deficit financing are mainly res-\nponsible for the price rises.\n26. The Five-year Plan for Bangladesh (1973-74 - 1977/78)\nis in the process of being finalized for implementation in\nlate 1973. Preliminary indications suggest that the size of\nthe Plan may be around Tk, 50,000 million. At least half of\nthia amount will have to come from external sources, It is\nrecognized by the Government that great efforts would be needed\nto mobilize domestic resources to meet the requirements in", "\t\t\n- 10 -\nthe Plan. A shortfall in the expected external assistance\nand/or failure of crops is likely to affect seriously the\nimplementation of the Plan. The Plan is expected to allocate\nover one-third of the resources to agricultural programs,\nseek self-sufficiency in food and industrial raw materials,\nand obtain adequate export earnings. Investment in other\nsectors would be geared to the major strategy for the agri-\ncultural and export sectors.\nVI. COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT\n27. I am satisfied that the proposed loans and technical\nassistance would comply with the Articles of Agreement of  the\nBank.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\n28.
