The environmental implications of the Program were reviewed \nand no adverse impact was identified. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement: Category C \nImpact on indigenous people: Category C \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  people  is  expected \nfrom implementation of the Program. \n \nIn recognition of its importance in sustaining economic growth and thereby \nhelping to reduce poverty, infrastructure development is a key pillar of the \nGovernment\u2019s  medium-term  development  framework  (MTDF)  for  2005\u2013\n2010.  The  MTDF  aims  to  (i)  deliver  more  reliable  and  affordable  power \nsupplies  to  industrial,  commercial,  and  household  customers,  meet  the \nincreasing  demand  for  electricity,  and  enhance  the  operational  efficiency \nof the power sector; (ii) establish an efficient and well-integrated transport \nand  logistics  system  that  will  facilitate  the  development  of  a  competitive \neconomy  by  increasing  access  to  and  the  quality  of  transport  services \nwhile  reducing  their  cost  and  ensuring  their  safety;  and  (iii)  enhance \naccess to drinking water and ensure drinking water security.  \n \nAddressing  the  serious  bottlenecks  in  infrastructure  will  require  the \ninvestment of substantive resources during the MTDF period and beyond. \nGiven  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  situation,  these  investments  cannot  be \nfinanced  by  the  public  sector  alone,  hence  alternative  approaches  are \nneeded, \ninfrastructure  (PPI).  The \nGovernment not only acknowledges the imperative of PPI from the point of \nview  of  capital  mobilization,  but  also  in  terms  of  ensuring  the  economic \nefficiency and effectiveness of investments.  \n\nincluding  private  participation \n\nin \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nRecognizing  that  the  Government  is  aiming  for  substantial  increases  in \nmedium-term  growth  rates  supported  by  infrastructure  development,  the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) country strategy and program update \n2006\u20132008  for  Pakistan  placed  renewed  emphasis  on  infrastructure \ndevelopment. As such, the country strategy and program encompasses a \nseries  of  interventions  in  the  infrastructure  subsectors  of  (i)  energy; \n(ii) transport,  logistics,  and  communication;  (iii)  irrigation  and  water \nresource development; and (iv) urban development and renewal.   \n \nThe  proposed  Program  would  help  fill  an  important  gap  in  implementing \nthe  Government\u2019s  strategic  agenda  as  articulated  under  the  MTDF  by \nstrengthening  the  enabling  environment  for  PPI.  By  doing  so,  the \noperation  will  help  the  Government  to  leverage  more  financial  resources \ninto infrastructure by using the private sector as an intermediary. This will \nhelp fill the gap between the infrastructure that the Government can afford \nand  the  infrastructure  needed  for  economic  development  and  poverty \nreduction as articulated in the MTDF. \n \nSubprogram  1  aims  to  enhance  economic  growth  through  improved \ninfrastructure services. The outcome will be enhanced PPI in infrastructure \ninvestment  and  maintenance  to  reduce  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  burden \nand  provide  better  infrastructure  services  to  the  population  and  to \nenterprises.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  Subprogram  1  will  address  key \nconstraints to PPI by (i) establishing an overall policy, legal, and regulatory \nframework  for  PPI;  and  (ii)  deepening  policy,  legal,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional reforms in priority subsectors, including power, highways, and \nwater.  \n \nKey  constraints  to  PPI  are  (i)  insufficient  institutional  arrangements  for \nbuilding  consensus  between  federal  and  provincial  authorities  on  PPI, \n(ii) weak  institutional  capacity  to  facilitate  PPI,  (iii)  inadequate  legal \nprotection for investors, and (iv) lack of standard bidding procedures and \ndocuments  for  PPI.  To  address  these  constraints,  Subprogram  1  will \n(i) establish  a  comprehensive  PPI  policy  providing  a  coherent  framework \nfor PPI, (ii) establish a PPI policy task force, (iii) strengthen the capacity of \nPPI  project-facilitating  state  agencies  to  build  a  strong  pipeline  of  PPI \nprojects, (iv) provide a legal and institutional basis for arbitration to protect \ninvestors,  and  (v)  standardize  bidding  procedures  and  documents  to \nincrease transparency. \n \nADB will support the Government\u2019s PPI policy reforms under Subprogram \n1  by  providing  a  program  loan  of  $400  million  from  the  ordinary  capital \nresources  of  ADB  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per \nyear,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement.  Subprogram  2,  which  is  expected  to  require  a  loan  of  $200 \nmillion from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, will be presented separately \nand will depend on the progress achieved under Subprogram 1. \n \n\nImpact and \nOutcome \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nThe  period  of  Subprogram  1  will  be  3  years.  Subprogram  1  will  be \ncompleted  by  31  December  2009  and  the  closing  date  is  30  June  2010. \nThe  loan  under  Subprogram  1  will  be  released  in  two  tranches.  The  first \ntranche  of  $200  million  will  be  released  upon  loan  effectiveness.  The \nsecond  tranche  of  $200 million  will  be  released  18  months  after  the \nrelease  of  the  first  tranche  subject  to  the  Government  meeting  the \nconditions specified for its release. \n \nThe Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency for Subprogram 1. \n \n\nThe  Government  has  established  the  Program  Coordination  Unit  in  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  to  coordinate  program  implementation.  The  Program \nCoordination  Unit  will  cooperate  closely  with  the  PPI  Policy  Task  Force, \nwhich  comprises  high-level  officials  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the \nPlanning  Commission,  and  other  state  bodies  relevant  to  PPI  policy \nreforms and is chaired by the adviser to the prime minister on finance. The \ntask  force  is  mandated  to  establish  working  groups  to  advance  specific \nareas of the policy reforms supported under Subprogram 1. The task force \nwill be supported by a technical and administrative secretariat. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs  of \nitems  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  other  than  the \nitems specified in the negative list of ineligible items and imports financed \nby other bilateral and multilateral sources. \n \nThe Borrower shall ensure that the local currency funds generated by the \nSubprogram 1 loan shall be used (i) to support the costs of reforms to be \ninitiated  and  implemented  under  Subprogram  1,  and  (ii)  to  finance \nexpenditures for the general development purposes of the Borrower. \n \nThe  Program  will  support  the  Government  in  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  PPI  rather  than  building  the  needed  infrastructure \nexclusively with public funds. Given its scarcity of financial resources, this \nis the only feasible approach for addressing the mismatch between limited \nsupply  and  increasing  demand  for  infrastructure,  thereby  promoting  long-\nterm economic growth for poverty reduction and directly enhancing access \nby the poor to essential services. \n \nThe policies, procedures, standards, and best practices for PPI developed \nunder  Subprogram  1  will  (i)  provide  more  planning  certainty  and  legal \nprotection  for  potential  investors,  and  (ii)  reduce  the  period  required  for \nproject  development  and  closure  of  transactions.  This  will  reduce  costs \nand help mobilize PPI. More transparent, competitive, and fair tenders for \nPPI  projects  will  also  help  attract  more  competitive  private  investors.  All \nthese undertakings will, in turn, free up public resources needed to provide \nother public services, including social services. \n \nPilot  PPI  projects  developed  under  Subprogram  1  will  directly  leverage \nprivate resources into infrastructure investment and generate opportunities \nfor  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  and  other  financial  institutions.  The \n\nProgram Period \nand Tranching \n\nExecuting \nAgency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement \n\nCounterpart \nFunds \n\nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\npilot projects will also demonstrate that PPI can be successfully prepared \nand  implemented  in  previously  unregulated  infrastructure  subsectors. \nExpectations  are  that  about  40  PPI  projects  will  materialize  under \nSubprogram  1  and  that  private  resources  will  finance  more  than  80%  of \noverall investment costs. The preparation and implementation of these PPI \nprojects  will  generate  valuable  feedback  that  will  help  develop  and \nstrengthen the enabling environment for PPI. \n \nMacroeconomic  stability  is  essential  for  PPI.  Macroeconomic  risks  are \nmitigated  by  prudent  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  and  high  expected \neconomic  growth.  It  is  assumed  that  Pakistan  will  not  suffer  from  any \nadverse  geopolitical  changes  affecting  its  external  and  internal  stability. \nFurthermore,  it  is  assumed  that  the  Government  will  remain  strongly \ncommitted to its reform program, which is firmly embedded in the MTDF. \n \nPPI entails risks for both customers and taxpayers. When the viability of a \nPPI project is worse than anticipated and the Government does not want \nto see the company involved go bankrupt, the regulator will have to permit \nan unscheduled price increase for the services provided. Alternatively, the \nGovernment  will  have  to  inject  taxpayers'  money.  From  an  economic \ndevelopment  perspective,  these  risks  are  frequently  worth  taking,  as  the \nGovernment  alone  does  not  have  the  resources  to  build  essential \ninfrastructure.  However,  to  mitigate  this  type  of  risk,  Subprogram  1  will \nstrengthen the preparation of PPI projects through capacity building in PPI \nproject-facilitating  agencies  such  as  the  Private  Power  and  Infrastructure \nBoard,  the  National  Highway  Authority,  and  the  Infrastructure  Project \nDevelopment  Facility.  Furthermore,  Subprogram  1  will  help  develop \nstandard \nthat \nforesee a fair and sustainable distribution of subproject benefits and risks. \n \nThe reforms supported under Subprogram 1 involve a number of agencies \nat  different  levels  of  government,  which  entails  implementation  risks. \nThese risks are mitigated through the establishment of the high-level PPI \nPolicy  Task  Force. \nfor \nSubprogram  1  emphasizes  a  collaborative  and  consultative  approach  to \nensure  that  the  reforms  are  homegrown  and  broadly  understood. \nFurthermore, Subprogram 1 focuses on PPI reforms that are mainly under \nfederal jurisdiction and on subsectors with a high potential for PPI. \n \nThe accompanying TA for $1,000,000 will help the Government implement \nthe reforms called for under Subprogram 1. The TA will (i) support the PPI \nPolicy Task Force in implementing its work program, and (ii) support key \nreforms  through  capacity  building  and  assessment  work.  The  TA  will  be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan.  \n\nincluding  concession  agreements \n\ntender  documents, \n\nimplementation \n\nIn  addition, \n\nframework \n\nthe \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nTechnical \nAssistance \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  the  Private \nParticipation in Infrastructure Program (the Program) in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which \ncomprises  (i) a  proposed  program  cluster  of  loans  to  develop  an  enabling  environment  for \nprivate participation in infrastructure (PPI), and (ii) a proposed program loan for Subprogram 1 \nof the cluster. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for supporting the \nProgram  and,  if  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  Board  of  Directors  approves  the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT1 \n\nFollowing  a  foreign  exchange  crisis  in  1998,  Pakistan  has  managed  an  economic \n2. \nturnaround.  Despite  regional  instability,  the  economy  appears  to  be  on  a  strong  growth \ntrajectory: growth of gross domestic product (GDP) increased sharply from 1.8% in fiscal year \n(FY) 2001 to 8.4% in FY2005; the Pakistan rupee has stabilized against the US dollar; the fiscal \ndeficit fell from 5.4% of GDP in FY2000 to 3.3% in FY2005; and the external debt-GDP ratio had \ndropped from 49.5% at the end of June 2001 to 31% by June 2005.  \n\n3. \nThis impressive turnaround was achieved through prudent fiscal and monetary policies in \ncombination  with  structural  reforms,  including  deregulation  and  privatization.  The  reforms  were \nguided by the Government\u2019s recognition that the production of goods and the provision of services \nare best carried out in the private sector, and that the private sector should be the main engine for \ngrowth  and  employment  generation.  Deregulation  and  privatization,  particularly  in  banking, \ntelecommunications,  and  the  oil  and  gas  sectors,  has  had  a  positive  effect  on  the  economy. \nFollowing privatization, these three sectors, together with manufacturing, have expanded rapidly \nand  attracted  substantial  foreign  investment.  In  FY2004  and  FY2005,  completed  privatization \ntransactions amounted to the equivalent of $0.5 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively. In the first 10 \nmonths  of  FY2006,  $3.6  billion  of  Government  equity  was  sold.  As  a  result,  the  quality  and \noutreach of banking and telecommunications services has improved substantially. \n\n4. \nNevertheless, recent challenges underline the need to continue prudent macroeconomic \nmanagement. While consumer price inflation averaged 3.9% in FY2001\u2013FY2004, it accelerated \nsharply from 4.6% in FY2004 to 9.3% in FY2005, mainly because of higher prices for food, oil, \nand housing. The cost of raising capital has also increased with the increase in interest rates for \n6-month  Government  securities  by  5.86  percentage  points  during  FY2005.  Given  inflationary \nexpectations,  long-term  debt  markets  remain  largely  illiquid.  The  country\u2019s  current  account \nbalance, after registering substantial surpluses since 2001, turned into a deficit of $1.8 billion in \nFY2005, or 1.6% of GDP (excluding official transfers). This amount more than tripled in FY2006 \nto  $4.4  billion  or  4.4%  of  GDP.  These  developments  pose  risks  to  the  country\u2019s  medium-term \neconomic outlook. \n\n5. \nThere  is  also  a  need  to  continue  structural  reforms.  Underinvestment  in  new \ninfrastructure  and  poor  maintenance  of  existing  infrastructure  resulting  from  low  development \nexpenditure  in  the  1980s  and  1990s  have  created  infrastructural  bottlenecks  that  are \nundermining  Pakistan\u2019s  economic  growth.  While  the  Government  has  managed  to  expand \ndevelopment expenditures since 2000, the macroeconomic risks outlined earlier point to a need \nto contain Government expenditures. Under these conditions, and to meet the growing demand \nfor  infrastructure  and  utilities,  the  Government  has  recognized  the  need  to  leverage  private \n\n                                                 \n1  This section should be read in conjunction with the country information provided in the following publication: ADB. \n\n2006. Asian Development Outlook. Manila.  \n\n\f \n\n2 \n\n \n\ninvestment  to  finance  infrastructure  development.  The  Government  has  also  undertaken \nreforms to open the sector to the private sector and to facilitate PPI.  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE INFRASTRUCTURE AND UTILITIES SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, \n\nAND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n6. \nDespite ongoing reforms, the mismatch between limited supply and increasing demand \nfor  infrastructure  and  utilities  is  particularly  severe  in  three  key  subsectors  of  the  economy: \npower, transport, and water. Appendix 1 presents a sector analysis. \n\n1. \n\nPower Subsector \n\n7. \nPower subsector reforms foresee gradual corporatization of the state-owned Water and \nPower  Development  Authority  into  power  generating,  transmission,  and  distribution  entities. \nNotable progress has been made in implementing these reforms, including the establishment of \n21  independent  power  producers,  the  corporatization  and  partial  privatization  of  the  Karachi \nElectricity Supply Company, and the establishment of the National Transmission and Dispatch \nCompany.  The  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority  has  been  established  to  regulate \nand supervise the sector. This regulatory authority issues licenses to generation, transmission, \nand distribution companies and determines the tariff for each distribution company. The Ministry \nof  Water  and  Power  implements  the  Government\u2019s  power  policies,  together  with  the  Private \nPower and Infrastructure Board (PPIB). To facilitate private investment, PPIB serves as a one-\nstop shop for PPI in the subsector.  \n\n8. \nDespite these reforms and a substantial increase in energy generation, the subsector is \nstill  characterized  by  insufficient  generation  capacity  and  operational  inefficiencies,  including \ntransmission  and  distributions  losses  (estimated  at  25%).  Operational  inefficiencies  lead  to \nfinancial  losses  for  the  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  and  the  Karachi  Electricity \nSupply  Company.  Furthermore,  about  45%  of  the  population  lacks  access  to  electricity  and \nenterprises lose a significant share of their revenues because of power outages.  \n\n9. \nTo  address  these  issues  and  support  an  annual  GDP  growth  target  of  6  to  8%, \nsubstantive  public  and  private  investment  is  required.  The  government\u2019s  medium-term \ndevelopment framework (MTDF) for 2005\u201320102 estimates that $8 billion of private investment \nwill be needed in the power sector during the MTDF period.  \n\n2. \n\nTransport Subsector \n\n10. \nRoads. Road transport accounts for 91% of passenger traffic and 95% of freight traffic. \nA  2005  survey  indicates  that  47%  of  national  highways  and  a  large  proportion  of  provincial \nroads are in poor to very poor condition. As a result, travel time along the north\u2013south Lahore\u2013\nKarachi  transport  corridor,  which  serves  80%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  land  trade  and  95%  of  its  external \ntrade, takes twice as long as travel along an equivalent-length highway in Europe or East Asia. \nIn  addition,  despite  significant  competition  in  road  freight  transport  services,  freight  rates  are \nsubstantially  higher  than  in  Brazil  or  India,  for  instance,  and  the  same  as  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China,  where  service  quality  is  higher.  The  existing  transport  capacity  cannot \n\n                                                 \n2  Planning Commission. 2005. Medium-Term Development Framework 2005\u20132010. Islamabad.  \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nsupport  the  projected  GDP  growth.  Freight  volume  is  estimated  to  surpass  road  transport \ncapacity by 2008 or 2009. \n\n11. \nThe  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA)  under  the  Ministry  of  Communications  is  the \ncustodian  of  Pakistan\u2019s  national  highways,  which  carry  an  estimated  90%  of  commercial  road \ntraffic.  Efforts  have  been  made  to  commercialize  NHA.  By  introducing  a  fee-for-service \napproach,  NHA  has  managed  to  increase  its  direct  revenues;  however,  annual  revenues \ncollected are about PRs3.6 billion, whereas maintenance requirements alone are PRs5 billion to \nPRs10  billion  per  year.  As  such,  substantial  public  and  private  investment  funds  have  to  be \nmobilized for road maintenance and development. The MTDF estimates that $2 billion of private \ninvestment  in  transport  and  communication  (including  railways  and  ports,  but  excluding \ntelecommunications)  will  be  required  over  the  MTDF  period.  Few  instances  of  private \ninvestment in roads have materialized so far. \n\n12. \nRailways.  State-owned  Pakistan  Railways  now  carries  less  than  5%  of  freight  traffic. \nRailway  infrastructure  and  the  rolling  stock  have  deteriorated  because  of  a  lack  of  investment \nand maintenance. Pakistan Railways is overstaffed, operates at a loss, and requires about $340 \nmillion  in  subsidies  per  year.  Pakistan  Railways  has  been  unable  to  adapt  to  the  increasing \ndemand for door-to-door transport services and has failed to introduce up-to-date logistics. Rail \nfreight  transport  takes  two  to  three  times  longer  than  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  The \nboard  of  Pakistan  Railways  was  restructured  in  2000  and  more  responsibility  was  given  to \nmanagers of the main business lines. As a result, commercial performance has been enhanced. \nIn  addition,  a  financial  advisory  team  has  drawn  up  measures  for  modernizing  Pakistan \nRailways.  Subsequently,  the  Government  decided  to  corporatize  Pakistan  Railways.  In  2002, \nwith  a  view  to  supporting  PPI  in  railways,  legislation  was  approved  for  establishing  a  rail \nregulatory authority, but this authority has yet to be established. \n\n13. \nPorts.  Pakistan  has  two  operational  overseas  ports:  Karachi  Port,  which  is  run  by  the \nKarachi  Port  Trust,  and  Qasim  Port,  which  is  run  by  the  Port  Qasim  Authority.  Ninety-five \npercent  of  Pakistan\u2019s  foreign  trade  passes  through  these  two  ports.  Despite  recent  efficiency \ngains,  which  were  due  mainly  to  commercialization,  Pakistan\u2019s  ports  are  still  expensive  by \ninternational standards, for example, estimates indicate that freight handling costs are 1.5 times \nthose in Mumbai and 4.5 times those in Colombo. The Government has embarked on a policy of \nimplementing the landlord model3 for its oversea ports to facilitate PPI. Small PPI projects have \nbeen  undertaken  in  the  port  sector  on  a  build-operate-transfer  basis,  but  these  have  not \ninvolved significant funding. \n\n3. \n\nWater Subsector \n\n14. \nThe  underdevelopment  of  water  and  sanitation  facilities  impairs  economic  growth  and \naggravates poverty. Only 39% of the population has access to piped water and most people are \nexposed  to  unsafe  and  polluted  water.  As  little  as  42%  of  the  population  has  access  to \nsanitation facilities. With the exception of a few big cities, sewerage facilities do not exist, which \ncauses  serious  health  problems.  Massive  investment  is  required  to  upgrade  water  and \nsanitation  services:  the  cost  of  upgrading  water  infrastructure  alone  is  estimated  to  range \nbetween  $60  billion  and  $70  billion.  Even  though  the  MTDF  emphasizes  the  potential  role  of \nprivate  investment  in  the  water  subsector,  few  investments  have  been  made  or  are  being \nprepared.  To  promote  PPI,  the  Government  has  established  the  Infrastructure  Project \n\n                                                 \n3 The landlord model foresees that a port authority retains the port infrastructure and regulatory functions,  whereas \n\nthe port services are provided by private operators. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nDevelopment  Facility  (IPDF)  as  a  special-purpose  vehicle  with  a  mandate  to  identify  and \nfacilitate PPI projects in the water sector and in other utilities.4  \n\nthe  water  sector \n\n15.  While  the  power  sector  and  national  roads  are  the  exclusive  domain  of  the  federal \njurisdictions.5  Provincial \nGovernment, \ninfrastructure  regulatory  authorities  have  been  established  to  regulate  the  water  sector  and \nother areas that fall under provincial jurisdiction, such as urban transport. IPDF will, therefore, \nhave to interact closely with provincial and subprovincial authorities. \n\nlargely  under  provincial \n\nfalls \n\nB. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n16. \nInfrastructure development is a key pillar of the MTDF in recognition of its importance for \nsustaining economic growth and reducing poverty. The MTDF indicates that annual GDP growth \nof 7.6% over the framework period requires the equivalent of $123.7 billion in fixed investments, \nof  which  only  35%  can  be  provided  by  traditional  public  sector  assistance.  Public  investment \nwould mainly be provided through the Public Sector Development Program, 48.2% of which is \nearmarked  for  upgrading  physical  infrastructure  in  the  power  subsector  (19.8%),  transport \nsubsector  (14.9%),  and  water  resources  (13.5%).  Public  investment  is  expected  to  increase \nfrom 5.3% of GDP in FY2005 to 6.8% of GDP in FY2010, but to achieve the MTDF\u2019s objectives, \nprivate investment has to rise drastically from 12.8% to 17.8% of GDP during the same period. \nWhile  nearly  70%  of  private  investment  would  be  in  manufacturing,  agriculture,  and  housing, \nsignificant  private  investment  would  also  be  required  in  services  and  infrastructure.  The  table \nillustrates the massive needs for private investment. \n\nProjected Private Sector Fixed Investment, 2005\u20132010 \n\nSector \n\nPRs Billion \n\n$ Billion \n\nShare (%) \n\nManufacturing  \nAgriculture \nHousing \nEnergy \nTelecommunications \nTransport and Communication \nKnowledge and Information Technology \nWater and Sanitation \nOthers \nTotal Private Sector  \nSource:  Planning Commission. 2005.

The  Government  also  recognizes  that  PPI  will  require  a \nconducive  policy,  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  environment  together  with  access  to  long-\nterm financing as typically required by infrastructure projects. \n\n                                                 \n4 IPDF is also mandated to facilitate PPI in those parts of the power and highway and/or roads subsectors that are \n\nnot covered by PPIB or NHA, respectively.  \n\n5 The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (1973) provides for a federal parliamentary system in which the \nfour  provinces  enjoy  a  degree  of  autonomy.  Legislative  and  regulatory  responsibilities  are  divided  between  the \nfederation and the provinces. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nPower  Subsector.  The  Government\u2019s  policy  objectives  for  the  power  subsector  are  to \n18. \ndeliver  more  reliable  and  affordable  electricity  to  industrial,  commercial,  and  household \ncustomers  nationwide  and  to  meet  increased  demand  while  simultaneously  improving \noperational  efficiency.  This  will  require  making  substantial  investments  in  generation  facilities \nand  augmenting  and  expanding  transmission  and  distribution  systems.  To  achieve  these \nobjectives, \nto  accelerate  power  subsector  reforms  and \nrestructuring, including privatization. The Government is also increasingly encouraging the use \nof PPI to mobilize investment funding. Furthermore, the Government is planning to increase the \nshare of energy generated from renewable resources.  \n\nthe  Government \n\nis  planning \n\n19. \nTransport  Subsector.  The  objective  of  the  Government\u2019s  transport  subsector  strategy \nis to establish an efficient and well-integrated transport system that facilitates the development \nof  a  competitive  economy.  Increasing  the  quality  of  transport  services  and  reducing  their  cost \ncontribute  to  poverty  reduction  while  ensuring  their  safety.  To  achieve  this  objective,  the \nGovernment  intends  to  (i)  strengthen  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  the  subsector, \n(ii) increase  and  strategically  sequence  its  investments  in  infrastructure,  and  (iii)  increasingly \nuse PPI to finance investment and outsource maintenance. The Government is also committed \nto building institutional capacity for facilitating private investment. The national highway program \nfor  2005\u20132010  includes  PPI  projects  totaling  $819  million.  NHA  is  planning  to  enhance  this \npipeline to mobilize the $2 billion in private investment in the road sector deemed necessary by \nthe MTDF.  \n\n20. \nTo  realize  the  economic  potential  of  railways,  the  Government  plans  to  transform \nPakistan  Railways  into  a  more  commercially-oriented  entity  while  retaining  ownership  of  the \nrailway  track  network.  The  Government  intends  to  (i)  attract  private  sector  capital  and \nmanagement expertise, particularly into railway support industries and train operations; and (ii) \nintroduce competition into rail service delivery.  \n\n21.  Water Subsector. The MTDF articulates the need to address the shortage of water and \nensure reliable services for irrigation, drinking water supply, and sanitation (including sewerage \nand  waste  disposal).  The  MTDF  expects  modest  private  investments  and  participation,  which \nmay start with easier to manage service and bulk water supply contracts.    \n\nC. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\nThe  Government  is  committed  to  undertaking  substantive  sector  reforms  to  encourage \n\n22. \nPPI projects. Nonetheless, constraints to PPI persist. \n\n1. \n\nEnabling Environment \n\na. \n\nPPI Policy Framework \n\n23. \nPakistan\u2019s  experience  with  PPI  since  the  early  1990s  underlines  the  importance  of \nreaching equitable agreements with private sector investors that carefully balance investors\u2019 and \npublic interests while taking into account such issues as concentration of market power, pricing, \nservice quality, protection of property and of users\u2019 rights, and management of foreign exchange \nrisks. This experience has helped develop a policy and regulatory framework and best practice \nfor PPI in those sectors in which projects were primarily focused, namely, telecommunications, \noil  and  gas,  and  some  areas  of  the  power  subsector.  However,  no  such  framework  exists  for \nPPI in other areas of the power subsector, such as renewable energy generation, and in other \nsubsectors,  including  transport  and  water  supply  and  sanitation.  Thus  private  investors  face \nhigh risks and incur substantial costs when developing projects in these sectors. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nThis issue is compounded by complexities across various levels of government that blur \n24. \nthe assignment of ownership, accountability, and regulatory responsibility in relation to service \ndelivery  functions  and  legal  enforcement  powers.  Even  though  the  Ordinance  on  Local \nGovernment  (2001)  assigns  accountability  for  provincial  and  local  roads,  water,  and  other \nutilities to local governments, in practice, agencies at a higher level still control many services. \nThis result in additional uncertainty, risks, and costs for private investors, which has effectively \nprevented  them  from  participating in  subsectors  that  are mainly  under  provincial or  communal \njurisdiction. \n\n25. \nPrivate  investors  require  firm  legal  protection  for  their  investments  and  a  well-defined \nenvironment  within  which  to  cooperate.  Concession  agreements  between  public  and  private \ninvestors do exist in the form of concession notifications, which are enforceable under current \ntax and customs legislation; however, there is no legal basis that defines general standards for \nconcession agreements. This is an impediment for PPI, particularly in areas where investments \ndo not generate high revenues in the short to medium term.  \n\n26.  While the overall legal and regulatory framework for environmental safeguards for public \nand  private  infrastructure  projects  has  been  established,6  the  Government  has  yet  to  adopt \nenvironmental  protection  policies.  Similarly,  social  safeguard  policies  have  yet  to  be  adopted.  \nAs  such,  investors  face  considerable  uncertainty  relating  to  the  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard policies and standards with which they have to comply.  \n\nb. \n\nViability of Infrastructure Projects  \n\n27.  Many infrastructure projects, particularly those in the water subsector, are economically \njustifiable,  but  fall  short  of  financial  viability.  As  a  result,  these  projects  fail  to  attract  private \ninvestors.  The  lack  of  financial  viability  usually  arises  from  long  gestation  periods  and  the \ninability  to  increase  user  charges  to  commercial  levels.  Infrastructure  projects  also  frequently \ninvolve  externalities  that  are  not  adequately  captured  in  direct  financial  returns  to  the  project \nsponsors.  Unless  financial  assistance  in  the  form  of  a  capital  grant  is  provided  to  make  the \nprojects viable, private investors are unlikely to participate in these projects. \n\nc. \n\nDispute Resolution \n\n28.  Weaknesses  in  the  court  system  constrain  contract  enforcement.  This  deters  investors \nfrom entering into PPI arrangements, which are contractual by definition. While judicial reforms \nare  ongoing,  addressing  weaknesses  in  the  judiciary  may  take  a  long  time.7  Moreover,  even \nwithin  a  court  system  that  is  efficient  overall,  contract  enforcement  through  the  courts  can  be \ncostly and time-consuming. A need to establish alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, such \nas  mediation  or  conciliation  for  smaller  technical  disputes  or  arbitration  for  larger  disputes, \ntherefore exists. Alternative dispute resolution modalities permit the disputing parties to choose \ntheir own arbiters. As this enables the involvement of technical experts, it is often the mode of \ndispute  resolution  preferred  by  investors  in  complex  commercial  cases,  even  in  industrial \neconomies. \n\n                                                 \n6  The Environmental Protection Law (1997) provides the overall legal framework for environmental protection in line \nwith international standards and for environmental impact assessments. Detailed regulatory guidelines have been \nadopted  under  the  law  to  outline  the  content  of  environmental  impact  assessments  and  minimum  environmental \nstandards for specific sectors and projects. \n\n7  For  a  description  of  the  weaknesses  of  the  judiciary,  see  the  report  on  ADB.  1998.  Technical  Assistance  to  the \n\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for Legal and Judicial Reform. Manila (TA 3015-PAK, approved on 7 May 1998). \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nEven  though  the  Pakistan  Civil  Procedures  Code  includes  a  provision  that  allows  the \n29. \nauthorities to develop a policy and regulatory framework for mediation and conciliation, no such \noperational framework exists as yet. As a result, judges and practitioners are not knowledgeable \nin conducting mediation and conciliation proceedings efficiently and expeditiously.  \n\n30. \nThe Law on Arbitration was enacted in 1940, but it has substantial weaknesses, such as \nthe ability to approach a court for settling an award, which defeats the purpose of arbitration. As \na result, the law has not worked in practice. Furthermore, in 2005 the President promulgated the \nOrdinance on the Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards to ratify the 1958 New York \nConvention.  While  this was  a  noteworthy  development  that  sent  a  positive  signal  to  investors, \nthe ordinance is merely an emergency law with limited tenure: ordinances lapse after 120 days \nunless extended or superseded by a new law. \n\n2. \n\nSector-Specific Issues \n\na. \n\nPower Subsector \n\n31.  While  the  corporatization  of  the  power  sector  operations  of  the  Water  and  Power \nDevelopment Authority  has been legally completed, its divestiture continues to be slower than \nanticipated. This limits opportunities for private investment. While decisions to privatize the two \nremaining  state-owned  gas  companies  have  been  made,  a  privatization  tender  has  yet  to  be \nannounced. \n\n32. \nPredictability  and  risk  mitigation  are  crucial  success  factors  for  PPI.  Private  investors \nrequire a framework that can assure them of a market-driven return at reasonable levels of risk, \nwhile  at  the  same  time,  consumers  demand  adequate  service  quality  at  an  affordable  cost. \nThese  preconditions  are  difficult  to  establish,  as  the  terms  of  project  agreements,  as  well  as \ntendering  arrangements,  are  usually  complex,  involving  detailed  legal  and  contractual \nagreements that clearly set forth the risks, rewards, and obligations of various parties. Reaching \nmutually  acceptable  and  sustainable  solutions  is  more  difficult,  time-consuming,  and  costly \nwithout  a  clear  policy  that  sets  the  framework  for  tender  procedures  and  contractual \narrangements.  Unfortunately,  no  such  policy  framework  exists  for  PPI  in  renewable  energy \ngeneration,  despite  the  high  priority  given  by  the  Government  to  private  participation  in  this \nparticular subsector. \n\n33. \nAs the Government\u2019s one-stop shop for PPI in the power subsector, PPIB has started to \nmake  substantial  contributions  to  attracting  private  investment,  but  is  constrained  by  weak \ncapacity.  PPIB  currently  has  34  professional  staff  for  processing  45  new  PPI  projects  and \nsupervising  the  implementation  of  16  ongoing  projects.  Capacities  need  strengthening  in  the \nareas  of  (i)  the  technical  know-how  needed  to  review  prefeasibility  studies  and  safeguard \nassessments, and (ii) the legal know-how needed to negotiate and implement power purchase \nagreements and facilitate dispute resolution. These weaknesses tend to substantially slow down \nthe  processing  of  PPI  projects  and/or  lead  to  agreements  that  are  difficult  to  implement.  The \nproblem is aggravated by the absence of standard bidding procedures and model contracts for \nprojects  in  renewable  energy  generation.  As  a result,  tender  documents  and  negotiations  with \ninvestors are frequently ad hoc. \n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nb. \n\nTransport Subsector \n \ni. \n\nRoads  \n\n \nPrivate investors have expressed their interest in road development and maintenance to \n34. \nnational and provincial authorities. However, the lack of a policy and regulatory framework and \nweak  capacity  on  the  part  of  the  state  agencies  involved  are  major  impediments  to  private \nparticipation. As a result, only one PPI project has materialized so far (at the provincial level), \nalthough six projects were tendered between 1991 and 2005. In light of this experience, there is \nbroad consensus about the main constraints to PPI in the subsector.8 \n \nCurrently, Pakistan has no formal policy regarding PPI projects in the roads subsector.9 \n35. \nAs a result, private investors and the staff of NHA face considerable uncertainty in relation to the \nframework and conditions for PPI in the roads subsector.  \n\n36. \nNHA  has  yet  to  adopt  standard  documents  and  procedures,  such  as  for  tenders, \nincluding  prequalification  invitations,  applications,  and  forms;  requests  for  proposals;  and \nconcession  agreements.  Due  to  inadequate  prequalification  criteria,  too  many  bidders  are \nusually  invited  to  participate  in  a  tender.  This  increases  costs  for  the  private  sector  and  the \nworkload  for  NHA.  Complex  procedures  and  unclear  criteria  for  financial  evaluations  result  in \nlack  of  transparency  and  lengthy  evaluation  periods.  The  absence  of  a  standard  concession \nagreement leads to unclear provisions that can make implementation of an agreement difficult, \nand thus frequently deters parties from entering into such an agreement. \n\nNHA is a professional highway engineering and planning organization and few NHA staff \n37. \nhave  in-depth  or  practical  experience  in  financial  issues.  NHA  also  lacks  the  administrative \ncapacity  to  handle  a  tender  process.  The  outcome  is  substantial  difficulty  in  undertaking \nfinancial  feasibility  or  prefeasibility  studies  (to  identify  and  prioritize  PPI  projects)  and  in \nreviewing and evaluating prequalification applications and financial plans produced by bidders. \nAs  a  result,  tender  processes  experience  inordinate  delays.  Few  NHA  employees  are  clear \nabout the concept of concession agreements or have technical knowledge in this field, making \nnegotiations  with  bidders  difficult,  if  not  impossible.  Conditions  and  terms  imposed  on  bidders \nare  frequently  ad  hoc,  are  often  unreasonable,  and  are  therefore  not  negotiable  or \nunenforceable. \n\nii. \n\nRailways  \n\n38. \nSlow progress with the commercialization of Pakistan Railways is the main constraint to \nprivate  investment  and  management.  This  applies  even  to  areas  that  could  be  realistic  entry \npoints for the private sector, such as railway support industries and train operations.  \n\n39. \nDespite  the  decision  to  allow  PPI  in  the  railway  subsector,  there  is  still  no  legal  and \nregulatory framework for PPI in this subsector. Further constraints include the weak institutional \ncapacity  in  Pakistan  Railways  and  the  Ministry  of  Railways  to  deal  with  potential  private \ninvestors,  the  absence  of  standard  tender  documents,  and  a  lack  of  experience  in  developing \nPPI projects.  \n                                                 \n8 These constraints were analyzed in detail with ADB support under ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Islamic \nRepublic of Pakistan for Facilitating Public\u2013Private Partnership Initiative in National Highway Development. Manila \n(TA 4508-PAK, approved on 20 December 2004).  \n\n9  Policy documents for PPI in the roads subsector were drafted in 1996 and again in 1999; however, neither set of \ndocuments  has  been  adopted,  as  none  of  the  drafts  included  specific  provisions  on  concession  agreements, \ntermination of contracts, and dispute resolution. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\niii. \n\nPorts \n\n40. \nPorts  are  revenue-generating  entities  than  can  usually  demonstrate  strong  cash  flows, \nmaking  them  more  attractive  to  private  creditors  and  investors  than  roads  and  railways. \nProgress has been made in the commercialization of ports, which could be further accelerated \nto  attract  private  investment  and  management  more  quickly  and  comprehensively  than  is \ncurrently the case.  \n\nc. \n\nWater Subsector \n\n41. \nThe  operating  environment  for  PPI  in  the  water  subsector  is  complex,  because  the \nsubsector is largely unregulated. Moreover, the water subsector is mainly under the jurisdiction \nand administration of provincial and other local governments, which are ill-equipped to manage \ninvestment.  The  provincial  infrastructure  regulatory  authorities  have  yet  to  function  as \nindependent regulatory bodies, and like many other provincial authorities, they lack the human \nresources and funding to carry out their responsibilities. Before meaningful capacity building can \nbe  undertaken,  a  decision  must  be  made  whether  these  agencies  should  regulate  various \nsubsectors \ntogether  as \n\u201cinfrastructure\u201d under a single, unified regulator. \n\nthese  subsectors  should  be  grouped \n\nindividually  or  whether \n\nD. \n\nExternal Assistance and Lessons  \n\n42. \nRecognizing  that  the  Government  is  aiming  for  substantial  increases  in  medium-term \ngrowth rates supported by infrastructure development, ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for \nPakistan reiterated its emphasis on infrastructure development.10 The strategy includes a series \nof  interventions  in  energy,  transport  and  communication,  irrigation  and  water  resource \ndevelopment, and urban development and renewal. \n\nSince  1997,  ADB  has  focused  its  engagement  in  the  power  subsector  on  supporting \n43. \nregulatory  reforms  and  enterprise  restructuring.  In  2000,  ABB  provided  program  and  project \nloans  for  energy  subsector  restructuring11  and  TA  to  support  privatization  of  the  Karachi \nElectricity  Supply  Company.12  In  2000  and  2001,  ADB  provided  institutional  capacity-building \nsupport to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority.13 In 2005, ADB provided a TA loan \nof  $25.00  million,  which  included  $6.75  million  for  the  power  subsector,14  and  undertook  a \nprivate sector investment in the New Bong Escape Hydropower Project in the amount of $37.30 \nmillion.15  In  the  transport  subsector,  ADB  is  providing  funding  for  public  investment  projects \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2005.

Appendix  2  provides  an  overview  of  the  substantial \nassistance  provided  by  external  funding  agencies  in  the  areas  of  infrastructure,  utilities,  and \nprivate sector development since 2000. \n\nRelevant  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  program  and  project  lending  in  general, \n45. \nand with private sector infrastructure development in particular, were incorporated in designing \nthe Program.  \n\nEffective  development  requires  strong  government  ownership.  Subprogram  1  will \n46. \ntherefore focus on areas where ownership is strongest, as reflected in the MTDF and subsector \nroad  maps,  and  where  reforms  have  substantially  been  initiated.  Furthermore,  Subprogram  1 \nwill support the establishment of a high-level task force as an institutional mechanism to sustain \nthe broad consensus for reforms and build ownership of new reforms at an early stage of policy \ndevelopment.  Policy  development  and  pilot  testing  of  transactions  will  proceed  in  parallel  to \nimprove credibility and establish practical experience, thereby helping to generate and sustain \ncritical ownership for reforms.  \n\n47. \nDevelopment of infrastructure through PPI requires, among other things, a multitude of \nconducive  policy,  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reforms  that  have  to  be  gradually \nundertaken over a long period of time. This can be done most effectively through various rounds \nof  reforms.  Every  new  round  has  to  advance  the  unfinished  agenda  while  making  necessary \nadjustments to past reforms to conform to changing economic and political developments. The \nProgram will build on a first round of reforms that has already taken place in the infrastructure \nand  utilities  sector.  To  allow  sufficient  flexibility  for  adjustments,  the  Program  will  support  a \nsecond and third round of policy reforms through subprograms 1 and 2. \n\n48. \nAn  important  lesson  from  ADB  program  lending  is  that  policy  actions  requiring  the \npassage  of  legislation  can  hamper  program  implementation,  notwithstanding  a  government\u2019s \nstrong support for a program. While strong commitment of the executive branch of government \nfor the legal reforms supported under the Capital Market Development Program19 was helpful in \nmaintaining  Parliament\u2019s  focus  on  the  proposed  legal  reforms,  it  could  not  ensure  the  timely \npassage  of  legislation\u2014such  as  the  Capital  Market  Law  or  the  Insurance  Law\u2014by  the \nlegislature. The proposed legislation involved complex technical issues and dealt with a range of \nvested  interests.  The  result  was  a  protracted  deliberation  period  during  which  draft  laws  were \nsubstantially changed. Drawing from this lesson, Subprogram 1 will minimize the need for legal \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB.  2005.

Manila \n\n(Loans 1576-PAK and 1577-PAK[SF]).  \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nreforms,  as  Pakistan\u2019s  experience  has  shown  that  clear  policy  statements  in  combination  with \nwell-prepared contractual arrangements are frequently sufficient for involving the private sector \nin  infrastructure  and  utilities.  Legal  reforms,  where  necessary  in  light  of  experience  under \nSubprogram 1, can be front-loaded in Subprogram 2 to minimize the risk of noncompliance. \n\nthe  participating \n\nA  specific  lesson  for  the  applicability  of  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policy  is  that  implementing \n49. \nagencies,  such  as \nthe  Financial  Sector \nIntermediation  Loan,  may  not  submit  adequate  information  on  the  environmental  aspects  of \nprojects if the required scope of environmental reports has not been sufficiently specified.20 To \nensure  the  diligent  application  of  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies, \nSubprogram 1 calls for the Government to further enhance its policy and regulatory framework \nfor environmental safeguards and to adopt specific application guidelines for PPI projects. \n\ninstitutions  under \n\nfinancial \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n50. \nThe  impact  of  the  Program  will  be  enhanced  economic  growth  through  better \ninfrastructure and utilities. The Program\u2019s outcome will be enhanced private sector participation \nin  infrastructure  and  utility  investment  and  maintenance  to  reduce  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal \nburden  and  provide  better  infrastructure  services  to  the  population  and  to  enterprises.  The \ndesign  and  monitoring  framework  for  Subprogram  1  is  in  Appendix  3.  By  promoting  PPI,  the \nProgram  will  help  the  Government  leverage  more  financial  resources  for  infrastructure  and \nutilities by using the private sector as an intermediary. This will help fill the gap between (i) the \ninfrastructure  the  Government  can  afford;  and  (ii) the  infrastructure  needed  for  economic \ndevelopment and poverty reduction, as articulated under the MTDF. \n\n51. \nThe Program is a cluster program that will consist of Subprogram 1 and Subprogram 2 \n(the  design  of  which  will  depend  on  the  outcome  of  Subprogram  1  and  the  Government\u2019s \nemerging  priorities).  This  report  discusses  Subprogram  1  and  refers  to  areas  that  may  be \ncovered  under  Subprogram  2.  A  TA  grant  will  support  implementation  of  Subprogram  1  and \ncapacity-building  initiatives  required  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  PPI  initiatives  over  the \nmedium and long term.21 \n\nB. \n\nImportant Features \n\nCluster  Modality  for  the  Program.  This  modality  allows  a  thorough  assessment  of \n52. \nSubprogram  1  before  embarking  on  Subprogram  2.  This  sequencing  is  particularly  important \ngiven that the Program supports long-term reforms, the success of which depends significantly \non strong and sustained political support and the direction and magnitude of private responses \nto the reforms. \n\n53. \nSupport  for  Subsector-Specific  Reforms.  Given  the  different  pace  of  reforms  in \ndifferent sectors and subsectors of the economy and the different roles and technical nature of \nPPI  projects  in  different  areas  of  infrastructure,  constraints  to  PPI  are,  in  part,  sector  and/or \nsubsector  specific.  Thus  in  addition  to  establishing  an  overall  policy  framework  for  PPI, \nSubprogram  1  will  address  specific  constraints  to  PPI  in  priority  subsectors.  The  subsector-\n\n                                                 \n20  ADB.  2005.  Project  Performance  Audit  Report  on  the  Financial  Sector  Intermediation  Loan  in  Pakistan.

However,  given  the  Program\u2019s  focus  on  addressing \npolicy  constraints  to  PPI  and  on  leveraging  private  resources  into  infrastructure,  it  will  clearly \ncomplement ADB\u2019s support for the Government\u2019s public investment program. \n\n54. \nCross-Subsector Transfer of PPI Experience. Subprogram 1 will support the transfer \nof positive PPI experience from those subsectors where PPI has progressed markedly, such as \npower generation and port logistics, into areas that are lagging behind, such as roads, railways, \nand  water  resources  and  sanitation.  Subprogram  2  will  continue  this  transfer  to  other \nsubsectors. \n\n55. \nLinkage  between  Policy  Reforms  and  PPI  Project  Experience.  Policy  reforms  and \npilot PPI transactions will proceed in parallel under the Program. While policy reforms supported \nunder  Subprogram  1  will  increasingly  facilitate  PPI  project  development,  the  hands-on \nexperience  gained  in  developing  and  negotiating  pilot  PPI  projects  will,  in  turn,  serve  as  a \nvaluable input into the policy reform process.  \n\nC. \n\nThe Proposed Subprogram 1 \n\n1. \n\nOutputs \n\n56. \nThe  objectives  of  Subprogram  1  are  to  enhance  the  enabling  environment  for  PPI  by \n(i) establishing  an  overall  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  framework  for  PPI;  and  (ii)  deepening \npolicy,  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reforms  in  priority  subsectors,  including  power, \ntransport, and water. The development policy letter and the policy matrix for Subprogram 1 are \nin Appendixes 4 and 5, respectively. \n\n2. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\na. \n\nEstablish a Policy, Legal, and Regulatory Framework for PPI \n\ni. \n\nEstablish the PPI Policy Task Force to Prepare PPI Policies \n\n57. \nGiven the crosscutting nature and the complexity of developing an enabling environment \nfor  PPI  in  various  subsectors  of  the  economy  that  fall,  in  part,  under  different  jurisdictions, \nSubprogram  1  calls  for  the  Government  to  create  the  PPI  Policy  Task  Force  to  facilitate  the \ndevelopment  of  PPI  policies.  The  task  force  will  form  working  groups,  as  needed,  to  review \noptions  and  prepare  policy  proposals.  The  task  force  will  also  provide  an  institutional \nmechanism  for  authorities  from  all  levels  of  government  to  build  consensus  on  standards, \nprocedures,  and  policies  in  support  of  PPI  in  line  with  best  practices.  The  establishment  of \nworking groups under the task force will allow experts and stakeholders to be involved, including \nthe  private  sector  and  users  of  infrastructure  and  utilities,  which  will  further  facilitate  the \ndevelopment  of  a  suitable  framework  for  PPI.  The  task  force  will  assign  qualified  staff  to  the \nworking groups and to a secretariat to be established under the task force to provide logistical \nsupport as needed. IPDF will act as the secretariat to the task force.  \n\nii. \n \n\nEstablish  a  Comprehensive  PPI  Policy  and  Regulatory \nFramework Consistent with International Best Practice \n\n58. \nUnder  Subprogram  1,  the  task  force  will  prepare  an  overall  PPI  policy  consistent  with \ninternational best practice that provides the framework for key aspects of PPI promotion across \nvarious  subsectors  of  the  economy.  Specifically,  the  PPI  policy  will  outline  the  types  of \n\n\f \n\n13\n\ninfrastructure  and  utilities  identified  for  private  participation,  establish  the  respective  approval \nauthorities  for  PPI  projects,  and  provide  for  investor  protection  through  a  framework  for  risk-\nsharing  arrangements  and  guarantees.  The  policy  will  also  establish  a  framework  for  financial \nand fiscal incentives for PPI and guarantees for PPI projects to be adopted by the Government. \nThe PPI policy will reduce uncertainty for both private investors and state agencies involved in \ndeveloping and implementing PPI projects. The policy will provide a framework for detailed and \nsubsector-specific  arrangements  that  will  ultimately  be  enshrined  into  contracts  that  are \nenforceable  under  the  Contract  Law.  In  the  past,  such  subsector-specific  policies  adopted  for \ntelecommunications  and  oil  exploration  have  helped  to  increase  the  confidence  of  private \ninvestors and to attract private capital.  \n\n59. \nUnder  Subprogram  1,  the  task  force  will  assess  the  impact  of  the  Government\u2019s  PPI \npolicy. Based on this assessment and lessons learned, the task force will propose measures to \nfurther  strengthen  the  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  PPI  to  be  adopted  and \nimplemented under Subprogram 2. The task force will also review the Government\u2019s concession \npolicies  and  assess  whether  legislation  on  concessions  is  needed  or  whether  contractual \narrangements  under  the  new  PPI  policy  will  suffice.  If  needed,  the  task  force  would  draft \nlegislation on concessions under Subprogram 1 that could be enacted under Subprogram 2. \n\n60. \nIn  addition,  Subprogram  1  calls  for  the  Government  to  adopt  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard  policies  and  to  disseminate  detailed  guidelines  clarifying  their  applicability  to  PPI \nprojects in the power and road transport subsectors. Projects in these subsectors are frequently \nenvironmentally and socially sensitive.  \n\nTo ensure the financial viability of economically justifiable projects, where necessary, the \n61. \nGovernment  will  establish  a  policy  and  institutional  mechanism  to  provide  financing  for  PPI \nprojects  in  the  form  of  a  capital  grant,  one-time  or  deferred,  that  will  not  exceed  a  subsector \nspecific  ceiling  set  in  line  with  international  best  practice.  This  ceiling  will  ensure  that  private \ninvestment  is  the  dominant  mode  of  financing  for  each  selected  project.  To  maximize  private \ninvestment  across  all  PPI  projects,  the  Government  will  develop  a  process  for  selecting  and \nprioritizing  PPI  projects  and  clear  eligibility  criteria  for  this  type  of  financing  in  line  with \ninternational  best  practice  under  Subprogram  1.  The  policy  to  provide  such  financing  will  be \nparticularly  relevant  in  areas  such  as  the  water  subsector,  in  which,  under  current \ncircumstances  (para.  63),  investors  cannot  establish  tariffs  or  user  charges  high  enough  to \nmake projects financially viable in the short and medium term. \n\nSubprogram  1  calls  for  the  Government  to  establish  an  empowered  committee \n62. \ncomprising the minister of finance and/or adviser to the prime minister on finance, the secretary \nof  the  Planning  Commission,  the  additional  secretary  on  budget  from  the  ministry  of  finance, \nand  a  high-level  representative  of  the  ministry  dealing  with  the  subsector  in  which  the \ninvestment  falls.  The  empowered  committee  will  (i)  review  approval  applications  for  such \nviability  financing  submitted  by  such  PPI  project  facilitators  as  IPDF,  NHA,  and  PPIB;  (ii) \nestablish  whether  a  project  complies  with  the  eligibility  criteria  for  such  financing;  and  (iii) \napprove  such  financing  for  a  project,  if  appropriate,  subject  to  budgetary  ceilings  indicated  by \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance.  The  empowered  committee  will  also  establish  an  appropriate  formula \nthat  balances  needs  across  subsectors  in  a  manner  that  ensures  broad  coverage  across  the \nsubsectors and avoids the pre-empting of funds by a few large projects.   \n\nApplications  for  financing  a  PPI  project  under  the  scheme  will  be  submitted  by  IPDF, \n63. \nNHA, or PPIB after a prefeasibility study has been undertaken. The applications will be based \non a prioritization of PPI projects to minimize the need for financing under this scheme and will \ninclude  the  requisite  information  needed  to  satisfy  eligibility  criteria  for  such  financing.  IPDF, \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nNHA, or PPIB, respectively, will certify that (i) the tariff and/or user charge for the service to be \nprovided under the PPI project cannot be increased to eliminate or reduce the need for viability \nfinancing, (ii) the project term cannot be increased to reduce the need for financing under this \nscheme,  and  (iii)  the  capital  costs  are  reasonable  and  are  based  on  standards  and \nspecifications normally applicable to such projects and cannot be further cut back to reduce the \nfinancing  gap.  This  certification  will  help  ensure  that  this  type  of  financing  will  only  be  made \navailable  as  a  second-best  solution  if  no  other  solution  is  feasible  under  the  circumstances  to \nmake an economically justified project viable.  \n\n64. \nBased on its review, and in light of the eligibility criteria, the empowered committee will \nconfirm  the  availability  of  financing  under  this  scheme  for  a  given  project,  if  suitable. \nSubsequently, the Government agency or statutory entity in charge of tendering the PPI project \nwill design the tender in a manner that ensures selection of the bidder who asks for the smallest \namount of financing. In other countries, this approach has helped minimize the share of actual \nfinancing  under  this  kind  of  scheme  in  total  project  investment,  and  therefore  constitutes \ninternational best practice. The empowered committee will provide final approval of the funding \nafter the successful bidder has been selected, and the funding will be disbursed at the project \nconstruction stage only after the successful bidder has extended the equity contribution required \nfor the project. \n\niii. \n\nEnhance Investor Protection \n\n65. \nSubprogram  1  calls  for  the  Government  to  undertake  legal  and  regulatory  initiatives  to \npromote  arbitration,  mediation,  and  conciliation  as  alternative  ways  of  commercial  dispute \nresolution. This will help protect investors\u2019 interests and thereby reduce the risks associated with \nentering into contractual arrangements for a PPI project. Under Subprogram 1, the Government \nwill  submit  legislation  to  Parliament  to  ratify  and  implement  the  New  York  Convention  on  the \nRecognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958). This will provide a legal basis \nfor recognizing and enforcing foreign arbitral awards. In addition, the Government will draft and \nsubmit  to  Parliament  a  new  arbitration  law  that  will  address  the  main  weakness  of  existing \nlegislation by limiting the grounds for approaching a court to set aside arbitral awards, thereby \nfacilitating the use of arbitration. The development of infrastructure for domestic arbitration can \nbe  supported  under  Subprogram  2.  Subprogram  1  will  also  recommend  developing  and \nadopting regulations that set forth the rules and procedures for alternative dispute resolution so \nas to provide competing, out-of-court alternatives to the contracting parties under a PPI should \nthey chose to make use of them. \n\nb. \n \n\nDeepen Policy, Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Reforms in \nPriority Subsectors \n\ni. \n\nPower Subsector \n\n66. \nTo  open  up  new  areas  for  PPI  in  the  power  subsector,  Subprogram  1  calls  for  the \nGovernment  to  adopt  a  policy  for  developing  renewable  energy.  The  policy  will  outline  the \ndetermination of tariffs and purchase arrangements for PPI projects in hydro, wind, and waste-\nto-energy generation and will establish a framework for incentives and guarantees.  \n\nTo  reduce \n\ntransaction  costs  and  accelerate \n\n67. \nflows,  Subprogram  1 \nrecommends  that  PPIB  adopt  and  disseminate  standard  processing  procedures,  model \ndocumentation, and standard contract documents for PPI projects in thermal power generation \nand\u2014as a second tranche condition\u2014for hydro and coal-fired power generation. The approval \n\ninvestment \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nprocess will also be standardized to expedite the planning, approval, and implementation of PPI \nprojects.  \n\n68. \nGiven the importance of appropriate tariffs for the viability of PPI projects, Subprogram 1 \ncalls  for  the  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority  to  develop  and  disseminate  detailed \ntariff  guidelines  for  PPI  projects  in  renewable  energy  generation.  Given  the  limitations  of \nregulation  by  contract,  systems  and  procedures  for  regulating  and  supervising  PPI  projects  in \nthe power subsector could be developed under Subprogram 2.  \n\n69. \nTo  build  a  strong  pipeline  of  PPI  projects  under  Subprogram  1,  the  Government  has \nagreed  to  approve  at  least  10  PPI  projects  in  power  generation  and  mandate  PPIB  to  tender \nthese  projects  as  a  first  tranche  condition.  Furthermore,  PPIB  is  encouraged  to  complete \ninternational competitive tenders for at least three of these projects by issuing letters of approval \nto the successful bidder. The Government will subsequently approve at least another seven PPI \nprojects in power generation, and PPIB will issue letters of approval for at least another seven \nPPI projects. Moreover, to allow greater private sector participation in the power subsector, the \nGovernment  will  privatize  the  two  remaining  state-owned  gas  supply  companies,  the  Sui \nSouthern Gas Company and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited, under Subprogram 1.  \n\n70. \nSubprogram  1  also  recommends  that  the  Government  establish  an  energy  working \ngroup or commission comprising representatives from the Planning Commission, the Ministry of \nWater  and  Power,  the  Ministry  of  Petroleum  and  Natural  Resources,  and  provincial \ngovernments and other energy specialists to develop an integrated (technical) energy model for \nthe  power  subsector.  This  model,  to  be  completed  during  the  Subprogram  1  period,  will  help \ndetermine the optimum use of energy resources, which will provide the basis for identifying and \nprioritizing  additional  PPI  projects.  By  the  end  of  Subprogram  1,  the  Government  will  have \ndetermined  the  host  agency  in  charge  of  maintaining  the  energy  model  and  published  project \nbriefs  outlining  the  scope  of  investment  and  the  implementation  schedule  for  suitable  PPI \nprojects identified by means of the model. \n\n71. \nSatisfied  with  PPIB\u2019s  role  thus  far,  the  Government  has  decided  to  corporatize  the \ninstitution and further enhance its capacity. For that purpose, the board of PPIB has agreed to \napprove  a  corporate  development  plan  for  PPIB.  The  plan  will  specify  the  legal  structure, \ngovernance, and resources required to support the development and monitoring of PPI projects \nin  the  power  subsector.  Subsequently,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  provide  an  initial  PRs  300 \nmillion to PPIB to meet its operating expenses. The Government has agreed to commission an \nindependent  strategic  review  of  PPIB\u2019s  performance  and  disseminate  the  review\u2019s  findings \nthrough  a  high-level  stakeholder  seminar.  The  key  recommendations  articulated  could  be \nadopted under Subprogram 2. \n\nii. \n\nRoads Subsector \n\n72. \nUnder  Subprogram  1,  the  Government  will  establish  a  policy  framework  for  PPI  in  the \nnational  highway  subsector,  including  highways,  bridges,  and  tunnels.  As  a  first  step,  the \nMinistry of Communications will submit a draft policy for PPI in the national highway subsector \nto the Government. The policy will include specific provisions on criteria for private participation, \nprequalification procedures, concession agreements and limits for public grants and subsidies, \ntermination  of  contracts,  and  dispute  resolution.  Subsequently,  the  Government  will  adopt  this \npolicy  while  ensuring  that  it  is  consistent  with  its  overall  policy  for  PPI  projects in  the  highway \nsubsector.  To  disseminate  its  experience  in  promoting  PPI  in  national  highways  and  facilitate \nthe harmonization of PPI policies in the roads subsector nationwide, Subprogram 1 calls for the \nMinistry of Communications to provide training to development and regulatory authorities from \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nthe  four  provinces.  Under  Subprogram  2,  new  areas  can  be  opened  up  for  PPI  in  close \ncooperation  with  provincial  authorities  that  may  include  dry  ports,  transport  systems  and \nservices, and provincial and municipal roads. \n\nAs  one  of  the  key  mechanisms  for  accelerating  road  subsector  development  through \n73. \nincreased  private  sector  finance,  Subprogram  1  calls  for  NHA  to  develop  comprehensive, \nreplicable tender procedures and documents, including concession agreements. Subprogram 1 \nalso  recommends  that  the  Government  commission  an  independent  performance  assessment \nof  concession  agreements  in  the  national  highway  subsector.  Based  on  lessons  learned,  the \nstandard  tender  procedures  and  documents  could  be  enhanced  under  Subprogram  2  if \nnecessary. \n\nUnder Subprogram 1, NHA will also improve its institutional structure and build capacity \n74. \nto attract large-scale PPI projects and handle them successfully. A key feature of this effort will \nbe the establishment of a PPI unit and its staffing with well-trained professionals. This unit will \nbe NHA\u2019s interface with private investors and have a mandate to review design and engineering \nwork, draft and enhance model concession agreements, and assist with concession agreement \nnegotiations. As such, the unit will be modeled after PPIB, which has successfully promoted PPI \nprojects in the power subsector.  \n\nAs  private  sector  bidders  will  conduct  their  own  feasibility  studies,  the  PPI  unit  in  NHA \n75. \nwill only undertake prefeasibility studies. Without knowing the likely financial performance of a \nPPI  project,  NHA  faces  difficulty  in  selecting  and  ranking  projects  and  in  negotiating  with \nbidders.  NHA  must  therefore  have  sufficient  technical  and  financial  data  on  a  project  before \ntendering  and  should  gather  such  data  by  means  of  the  prefeasibility  study,  which  should \ninclude establishing the project\u2019s financial feasibility and identifying options to make PPI viable \nwhere needed.  \n\nUnder  Subprogram  1,  NHA  will  identify  PPI  projects  in  the  national  highway  subsector \n76. \nwith  a  value  of  at  least  PRs  55  billion  as  a  first  tranche  condition.  The  total  value  of  the  PPI \npipeline  will  be  increased  to  PRs  100  billion  as  a  second  tranche  condition.  NHA  will  open \ninternational tenders for PPI projects with a total value of at least PRs 7 billion as a first tranche \ncondition  and  an  additional  PRs  30  billion  as  a  second  tranche  condition.  Finally,  NHA  will \ncomplete the tender process for PPI projects with a total value of at least PRs 20 billion as an \nend  of  Program  condition.  Building  up  a  pipeline  of  PPI  projects  at  various  stages  of \ndevelopment  and  tendering  will  not  only  facilitate  PPI  projects,  but  will  also  avoid  unsolicited \nprojects and provide investors with various opportunities to bid.  \n\niii. \n\nPorts and Railways \n\nTo  accelerate  PPI  in  national  seaports,  Subprogram  1  calls  for  the  Government  to \n77. \ncommercialize  the  ports  in  Karachi  and  Qasim.  Subprogram  1  also  calls  for  the  Karachi  Port \nAuthority  to  invite  private  sector  applications  for  leasing  the  cargo  berths  at  Karachi  Port,  and \nsubsequently, to select the successful bidder.  \n\n78. \nTo  generate  opportunities  for  PPI  in  the  railway  subsector,  the  Government  will \n(i) prepare a policy statement announcing its intent to corporatize and commercialize Pakistan \nRailways, (ii) draft a long-term commercialization and corporatization plan for Pakistan Railways \nthat foresees the corporatization of core railway activities and the conversion of manufacturing \nunits into independent commercial entities, (iii) draft legislation to provide for the establishment \nof  the  Pakistan  Railways  Corporation,  and  (iv)  allow  private  sector  participation  in  operating \nfreight  and  passenger  trains  on  Pakistan  Railways\u2019  track  infrastructure.  As  recommended  by \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nSubprogram  1,  the  Government  will  also  approve  a  policy  on  private  freight  and  passenger \nrailway  transport  services.  Other  monitorable  conditions  are  the  submission  to  Parliament  of \nlegislation  to  provide  for  the  establishment  of  the  Pakistan  Railways  Corporation  and  the \nelaboration  of  procedures  for  interacting  with  private  investors  and  building  capacity  for  that \npurpose  in  line  with  the  experience  of  PPIB  and  NHA,  including  the  establishment  of  a  focal \npoint for PPI in the railway subsector. \n\niv.  Water Subsector and Other Communal Services \n\n79. \nIPDF has been established to facilitate private sector investment in communal services, \nincluding  water  supply  and  sanitation,  especially  at  the  provincial  and  municipal  levels.  Under \nSubprogram 1, IPDF will develop standard tender procedures and documents, including model \nconcession  agreements  for  PPI  projects.  IPDF  will  also  assist  provincial  and  municipal \nauthorities and entities, where necessary, in analyzing PPI projects and undertaking concession \nagreement  negotiations.  To  expand  PPI  in  the  water  subsector,  Subprogram  1  calls  for  the \nGovernment  to  develop  a  national  water  policy  with  specific  provisions  pertaining  to  PPI  as  a \nfirst tranche condition. The Government will subsequently establish a working group to draft  a \nconcept paper on how to develop procedures and build capacity to deal with private investors in \ncommunal services. \n\n3. \n\nLoan Size \n\n80. \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  finance  $600  million  equivalent  under  the \nProgram, of which $400 million is under Subprogram 1. The loan under Subprogram 1 will be \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3 \nyears, an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per year, and such other terms \nand  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  The  closing  date  for  Subprogram  1  is  30 \nJune 2010.  \n\n81. \nThe  following  factors  have  been  taken  into  account  in  determining  the  loan  size:  the \nimportance  of  the  infrastructure  sector  for  sustaining  economic  growth  and  reducing  poverty \n(paras. 5 and 16), the strength of the Program and the financial and political costs associated \nwith implementing it, and the Government\u2019s overall development financing needs. \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\na. \n\nProgram Management \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  Subprogram  1.  The  financial \n82. \nin \nmanagement  arrangements  are  assessed  as  adequate.  Accumulated  experience \nimplementing a large number of program loans demonstrates the Ministry of Finance\u2019s proven \ncompetence and capacity to effectively carry out the financial management of Subprogram 1.  \n\nThe  Government  has  established  the  Program  Coordination  Unit  in  the  Ministry  of \n83. \nFinance  under  the  joint  secretary  (Prime  Minister\u2019s  Special  Program)  to  coordinate  program \nimplementation.22 The Program Coordination Unit will coordinate closely with IPDF, PPIB, NHA, \nand the PPI Policy Task Force, which comprises high-level officials from the Ministry of Finance, \nthe Planning Commission, and other state bodies relevant to PPI policy reforms. The task force \nwill  be  chaired  by  the  adviser  to  the  prime  minister  on  finance  or  any  other  person  with \n\n                                                 \n22 Currently, the prime minister is also the minister of finance. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nequivalent authority as agreed with ADB. The task force has the mandate to establish working \ngroups to advance specific areas of the policy reforms supported under the Program. The task \nforce  is  supported  by  a  permanent  technical  and  administrative  secretariat  that  reports  to  the \nhead  of  the  task  force.  ADB  will  closely  monitor  program  implementation  to  ensure  that  the \nenvisaged outputs are achieved.  \n\nb. \n\nPeriod of Implementation  \n\nThe implementation period of Subprogram 1 will be 3 years. It will be completed by 31 \n\n84. \nDecember 2009. Subprogram 2 will be completed by December 2014. \n\nc. \n\nProcurement and Withdrawal Procedures \n\n85. \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced \nand  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  other  than  the  items  specified  in  the  negative  list  of \nineligible  items  (Appendix  6)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  Subprogram  1  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  Pakistan  as  the  Borrower  in \naccordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related \nrequirements for program loans. Loan proceeds will be disbursed for a broad range of imports \non  the  basis  of  a  certificate  provided  by  the  Government  stipulating  that  the  value  of  the  total \nimports  of  Pakistan,  minus  its  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports  financed  under  other  official  development  assistance,  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the \namount of the loan expected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB reserves the right to \naudit the use of loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n\nADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained \n\n86. \nthe \nGovernment.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to Subprogram 1. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations. \n\nto  and  discussed  with \n\nd. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n87. \nThe Borrower shall ensure that the local currency funds generated by the Subprogram 1 \nloan  shall  be  used  first,  to  support  the  adjustment  costs  of  reforms  to  be  initiated  and \nimplemented  under  Subprogram  1,  and  second,  to  finance  expenditures  for  the  Borrower\u2019s \ngeneral development purposes. \n\ne. \n\nTranching \n\nThe  loan  will  be  released  in  two  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $200  million  will  be \n88. \nreleased  upon  loan  effectiveness.  The  second  tranche  of  $200  million  will  be  released  18 \nmonths  after  the  release  of  the  first  tranche,  provided  that  ADB  is  satisfied  that  sufficient \nprogress  has  been  made  in  implementing  Subprogram  1  and,  in  particular,  that  all  second \ntranche release conditions set forth in bold in the policy matrix have been met. In addition, the \nGovernment  must  take  all  the  monitorable  actions  listed  in  the  policy  matrix  during  the \nSubprogram  1  period.  While  these  actions  are  not  conditions  for  the  release  of  the  first  or \nsecond  tranches,  they  are  crucial  steps  toward  achieving  the  objectives  set  forth  in  the  policy \nmatrix. Following release of the second tranche, activities (including grant support) will focus on \nlaying the foundations for Subprogram 2. \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nf. \n\nMonitoring and Reporting \n\n89. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  will  (i)  establish,  within  3  months  after  loan  effectiveness,  and \nmaintain a performance evaluation system for Subprogram 1, which will include a database on \nthe status of policy measures and program indicators based on the policy matrix; (ii) monitor the \nimplementation of Subprogram 1 and its impacts; and (iii) submit reports to ADB semiannually \non the implementation of Subprogram 1, including accomplishment of the measures set forth in \nthe  development  policy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix.  ADB  will  monitor  the  implementation  of \nSubprogram  1  through  regular  reviews  and  progress  reports  throughout  the  implementation \nperiod.    Based  on  these  reviews,  modifications  and  improvements  will  be  considered.  To \nfacilitate such reviews, the Borrower shall assist ADB by providing relevant data and information \nin  such  detail  as  ADB  may  reasonably  request.  Approximately  6  weeks  before  the  anticipated \nwithdrawal  of  the  second  tranche,  ADB  will  undertake  a  review  of  progress  made  in \nimplementing the policy reforms under Subprogram 1.  \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nThe TA for the Supporting the Private Participation in Infrastructure Program will help the \n90. \nGovernment  implement  the  reforms  called  for  under  Subprogram  1.  In  particular,  the  TA  will \n(i) support the PPI Policy Task Force in implementing its work program; and (ii) support key PPI \nreforms through training, capacity building, and assessment work. \n\n91. \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,320,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide  $1,000,000 \n(financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan). \nThe Government\u2019s contribution of $320,000 equivalent will cover office accommodation, training \nand workshop facilities, and counterpart support. Procurement of goods under the TA will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n\nThe Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency for the TA. The task force will be the \n92. \nimplementing agency. The TA will be implemented over a period of 3 years, starting in November \n2006. The TA is estimated to require 38 person-months of consulting services: 13 person-months \nby international consultants and 25 person-months by national consultants. All consultants will be \nselected on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe key activities, cost estimate, and outline terms of reference for the TA are in Appendix 7. \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n93. \nThe Program will help leverage the use of private sector resources for the development \nof infrastructure and utilities, and thereby address a critical constraint to sustainable economic \ngrowth. Well-guided economic growth should benefit Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic position as well \nas  help  reduce  poverty.  The  loan  proceeds  will  also  help  implement  the  Government\u2019s  overall \ndebt reduction and fiscal consolidation policies.  \n\n94. \n\nSpecific benefits are as follows: \n(i) \n\nThe  Program  will  support  the  Government  in  creating  an  enabling  environment \nfor PPI rather than building the needed infrastructure and utilities exclusively with \npublic  funds.  Given  the  scarcity  of  financial  resources,  this  is  the  only  feasible \napproach  for  addressing  the  mismatch  between  limited  supply  and  increasing \ndemand  for  infrastructure  and  utilities,  thereby  promoting  long-term  economic \ngrowth and directly enhancing access by the poor to essential services. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe policies, procedures, standards, and best practices for PPI developed under \nthe Program will provide more planning certainty and legal protection for potential \ninvestors and will reduce the period required for project development and closure \nof transactions. This will reduce costs and help mobilize PPI. More transparent, \ncompetitive,  and  fair  tenders  for  PPI  projects  will  also  help  attract  more \ncompetitive  private  investors.  All  these  actions  will,  in  turn,  free  up  public \nresources needed to provide other public services, including social services. \nThe pilot PPI projects facilitated under Subprogram 1 directly leverage the use of \nprivate  resources  for  developing  infrastructure  and  utilities  and  will  generate \nopportunities for ADB\u2019s private sector operations23 and other financial institutions. \nThe  pilot  projects  will  also  demonstrate  that  PPI  can  be  successfully  prepared \nand \ninfrastructure  subsectors. \nExpectations are that about 40 PPI projects will materialize under Subprogram 1 \nand  that  private  resources  will  finance  more  than  80%  of  overall  investment \ncosts.  The  preparation  and  implementation  of  projects  will  generate  valuable \nfeedback for developing and strengthening the enabling environment for PPI.   \n\nin  previously  unregulated \n\nimplemented \n\n \nImpacts \n\nB. \n\n95. \nA summary poverty reduction and social strategy for the Program is in Appendix 8. The \nProgram  will  support  the  Government  in  implementing  its  MTDF,  which  acknowledges  the \nimportance  of  promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  through  PPI.  The  Program  will \nstrengthen the enabling environment for PPI, and in doing so will leverage financial resources \ninto  infrastructure  by  using  the  private  sector  as  an  intermediary.  This  will  help  provide  the \npopulation  with  infrastructure  services  and  free  up  public  resources  needed  to  provide  social \nservices. As such, the Program is pro-poor in its direct impact in the short term and pro-poor in \nits  indirect  impact  in  the  short  and  medium  term.  No  involuntary  resettlement  or  impact  on \nindigenous  people  is  expected  from  implementation  of  the  Program  (category  C).  The \nenvironmental implications of the Program were assessed, and no significant adverse impact was \nidentified. Both fall under category C in ADB\u2019s environmental classification system.  \n\nC. \n\nRisks \n\n96. \nEmpirical  findings  suggest  that  macroeconomic  stability  is  essential  to  attract  and \nsuccessfully  implement  PPI  projects.  Macroeconomic  risks  are  mitigated  by  prudent  fiscal  and \nmonetary policies and high expected economic growth rates; however, the Program has to assume \nthat Pakistan will not suffer from any adverse geopolitical changes affecting its external and internal \nstability. Furthermore, the Program assumes that the Government will remain strongly committed to \nits reform program, which is firmly embedded in the Government\u2019s MTDF for 2005\u20132010. \n\nPPI involves risks for both customers and taxpayers. When the viability of a PPI project is \n97. \nworse  than  anticipated  and  the  Government  does  not  want  to  see  the  company  involved  go \nbankrupt, the regulator will have to permit an unscheduled price increase for the services provided. \nAlternatively, the Government will have to inject taxpayers' money. From an economic development \nperspective,  these  risks  are  frequently  worth  taking,  as  the Government  alone  does  not  have  the \nresources to build essential infrastructure. However, to mitigate this type of risk, Subprogram 1 will \nstrengthen  the  preparation  of  PPI  projects  through  capacity  building  in  PPIB,  NHA,  and  IPDF. \nSubprogram 1 will also help develop standard tender documents, including concession agreements \nthat foresee a fair and sustainable distribution of project benefits and risks. \n\n                                                 \n23 ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department has been closely consulted throughout loan processing and informed \n\nabout potential investment opportunities. \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nThe  reforms  supported  under  the  Program  involve  a  number  of  agencies  at  different \n98. \nlevels of government. Collaboration among federal, provincial, and local levels of government, \nand vertically among agencies at the same level of government, involves implementation risks. \nThese risks are mitigated through the establishment of the high-level task force that is chaired \nby the adviser to the prime minister on finance and comprises representatives of line agencies, \nregional  governments,  and  the  private  sector.  Furthermore,  the  implementation  framework  for \nSubprogram  1  also  emphasizes  a  collaborative  and  consultative  approach  to  ensure  that  the \nreforms  are  homegrown  and  broadly  understood.  In  addition,  Subprogram  1  focuses  on  PPI \nreforms that are mainly under federal jurisdiction and subsectors with a high potential for PPI. \n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n99. \nassurances, which are incorporated into the loan document: \n \n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of Subprogram 1 loan, \nas described in the Development Policy Letter and the policy matrix, will continue \nin effect for the duration of Subprogram 1 and subsequently. \nThe Government will promptly adopt the other policies and take the other actions \nincluded  in  Subprogram  1  as  specified  in  the  Development  Policy  Letter  and  the \npolicy matrix for the Program  to ensure that such policies and actions continue in \neffect for the duration of Subprogram 1 and subsequently. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n \nB. \n \n100.  The conditions of the effectiveness of the loan agreement are: (i) the preparation by the \nPPI Policy Task Force of its work program for a period of at least 2 years, (ii) the initiation of the \npreparation  of  an  overall  PPI  policy  by  the  task  force,  and  (iii)  the  establishment  by  the \nGovernment of a working group to develop an integrated energy model. \n \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n \n101. \nADB and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe program cluster of loans concept of $600,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of \nPakistan for the Private Participation in Infrastructure Program; and \nthe  loan  of  $400,000,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  Private \nParticipation  in  Infrastructure  Subprogram  1,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  15  years, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Program  Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board. \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \n      President \n\n5 October 2006 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n1. \n\nPower Subsector1 \n\n1. \nPower subsector reforms foresee gradual corporatization of the state-owned Water and \nPower  Development  Authority  into  power  generating,  transmission,  and  distribution  entities. \nNotable  progress  has  been  made  in  implementing  these  reforms  over  the  last  10  years, \nincluding the establishment of 21 independent power producers, the corporatization and partial \nprivatization  of  the  Karachi  Electricity  Supply  Company,  and  the  establishment  of  the  National \nTransmission  and  Dispatch  Company,  the  single  buyer  of  generated  power,  transmitter,  and \nwholesale distributor. The subsector also includes two nuclear power plants. The total installed \npower  generation  capacity  is  19,404  megawatts,  of  which  the  Water  and  Power  Development \nAuthority accounts for 55%, the Karachi Electricity Supply Company for 10%, the independent \npower producers for 32%, and the nuclear power plants for 3%. Hydropower accounts for 31% \nof generation capacity. The Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) is implementing the \nGovernment\u2019s  power  policies  together  with  the  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power.  The  National \nElectric Power Regulatory Authority is in charge of implementing power subsector legislation by \nregulating  and  supervising  the  subsector.  This  regulatory  body  issues  licenses  to  generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution  companies  and  determines  the  tariff  for  each  distribution \ncompany. The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority is gradually increasing tariffs toward \nfull  cost  recovery  to  eliminate  the  need  for  subsidies.  The  Oil  and  Gas  Regulatory  Authority \nsupervises the oil and gas subsector, with authority comparable to that of the National Electric \nPower Regulatory Authority. \n\n2. \nDespite  these  reforms  and  a  substantial  increase  in  energy  generation,  the  power \nsubsector is still characterized by insufficient generation capacity and operational inefficiencies, \nincluding  unreasonable  levels  of  transmission  and  distribution  losses  (estimated  at  25%). \nOperational  inefficiencies  lead  to  financial  losses  by  the  Water  and  Power  Development \nAuthority and the Karachi Electricity Supply Company. These losses, which amounted to 1% of \ngross  domestic  product  in  2003,  have  to  be  covered  by  the  state  budget.  Furthermore,  about \n45% of the population lacks access to electricity. A reported 42% of manufacturing businesses \nin  Pakistan  use  costly  captive  power  units,  compared  with  16%  in  the  Peoples  Republic  of \nChina.2 Regional benchmarking studies show that enterprises in Karachi lose more than 6% of \ntheir  sales  revenues  because  of  power  outages,  while  the  equivalent  figure  for  enterprises  in \nGuangzhou  and  Shanghai  is  less  than  2%.  Existing  bottlenecks  in  the  power  transmission \nnetwork  are  expected  to  result  in  significant  system  capacity  shortfalls,  which  in  turn  could \nrestrict GDP growth by almost 0.8% in fiscal year 2008, for instance. \n\nEnergy generation for industrial and commercial use alone would have to increase by an \n3. \nestimated 2,000 megawatts annually to support a GDP growth target of about 8%. There is also \nan  urgent  need  to  increase  the  population\u2019s  access  to  energy  and  enhance  the  transmission \nand  distribution  network.  For  these  purposes,  a  substantial  volume  of  public  and  private \ninvestment  is  needed.  The  Government\u2019s  medium-term  development  framework  (MTDF)  for \n2005\u201320103 estimates that $8 billion of private investment will be required in the power sector \n                                                 \n1 A description  of the power sector is in ADB. 2005.

Medium-Term Development Framework 2005\u20132010. Islamabad. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n23 \n\nover the MTDF period. A legal framework for public\u2013private partnerships in the power subsector \nwas  established  in  the  mid-1990s.  PPIB  provides  a  one-window  facility  to  potential  private \nsector  investors.  In  addition  to  other  functions,  PPIB  signs  implementation  agreements  with \nprivate  power  producers  on  behalf  of  the  Government  and  acts  as  the  legal  custodian  of  PPI \nprojects in the power sector.  \n\n2. \n\nTransport Subsector4  \n\nRoads.  Road  transport  is  the  dominant  mode  of  transport,  accounting  for  91%  of \n4. \npassenger  and  96%  of  freight  traffic.  The  total  length  of  the  road  network  is  some  260,000 \nkilometers, 60% of which are paved. A 2005 survey indicates that 47% of the national highway \nnetwork and a large proportion of the provincial road network are in poor to very poor condition. \nAs  a  result,  travel  time  along  the  north\u2013south  Lahore\u2013Karachi  transport  corridor,  for  instance, \nwhich serves 80% of Pakistan\u2019s land trade and 95% of its external trade, takes twice as long as \ntravel  along  an  equivalent-length  highway  in  Europe  or  East  Asia.  There  are  also  delays  in \nconnectivity  between  highways.  As  a  result,  and  despite  significant  competition  in  road  freight \ntransport services, which are predominantly private, freight rates are substantially higher than in \nBrazil  or  India  and  the  same  as  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  where  service  quality  is \nhigher.  Furthermore,  existing  transport  capacity  cannot  support  the  projected  gross  domestic \nproduct growth. The number of vehicles is growing at 9% per year, passenger traffic at 12.6% \nper year, and freight traffic at 6.1% per year. The volume of freight will surpass the capacity of \nroad  transport  by  2008  or  2009.  Overall,  rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  the  road  network  is \nurgently needed to remove a major obstacle to sustainable economic growth. \n\nfalls  under \n\n(NHA),  which \n\nThe  National  Highway  Authority \n\nthe  Ministry  of \n5. \nCommunications,  is  the  custodian  of  Pakistan\u2019s  national  highways,  which  carry  an  estimated \n90% of commercial road traffic.5 NHA is responsible for managing the design, development, and \noperation  of  national  highways,  including  tunnels,  and  bridges.  Efforts  have  been  made  to \nreorganize  and  commercialize  NHA.  By  introducing  a  fee-for-service  approach,  NHA  has \nmanaged to increase its direct revenues. In addition, NHA has reprioritized and reprogrammed \nits  investment  program,  paying  more  attention  and  devoting  more  resources  to  conserving \nhighways.  However,  annual  revenues  collected  by  NHA  are  about  PRs  3.6  billion,  whereas \nmaintenance  requirements  alone  are  PRs  5  billion  to  PRs  10  billion  per  year.  As  a  result, \nsubstantial public and private funds have to be invested in road maintenance and development. \nThe  MTDF  for  2005\u20132010  estimates  that  $8  billion  of  private  investment  in  transport  and \ncommunication (including railways and ports, but excluding telecommunications) will be required \nover  the  MTDF  period.  Nevertheless,  despite  NHA\u2019s  encouragement  to  participate  in  a \nsignificant  number  of  road,  tunnel,  and  bridge  developments,  few  examples  of  private \ninvolvement in the road subsector have materialized so far. \n\nRailways. Having once been the leading mode of transport, railways now carry less than \n6. \n5% of freight traffic. Railway infrastructure and the rolling stock have deteriorated because of a \nlack  of  investment  and  maintenance.  State-owned  Pakistan  Railways,  which  falls  under  the \ndirection of the Ministry of Railways, is overstaffed, operates at a loss, and requires about $340 \n\n                                                 \n4 A description of the roads subsector is in ADB. 2005.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Technical \nAssistance  Loan  and  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  Infrastructure \nDevelopment. Manila. \n\n5  Provincial  communication  and  works  departments  and  other  local  government  entities  are  responsible  for  other \n\nroads. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nmillion  in  Government  subsidies  per  year.  Pakistan  Railways  has  been  unable  to  adapt  to  the \nincreasing  demand  for  door-to-door  transport  services  and  has  failed  to  introduce  modern \nlogistics. Rail freight transport takes two to three times longer than in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina. \n\n7. \nSince  2000,  the  board  of  Pakistan  Railways  has  been  restructured,  an  executive \ncommittee  has  been  established,  and  efforts  have  been  made  to  give  more  responsibility  to \nmanagers  of  the  main  business  lines.  The  executive  committee  has  been  authorized  to  raise \ntariffs, and commercial performance could be enhanced. In addition, a financial advisory team \nwas  hired  to  suggest  measures  for  modernizing  Pakistan  Railways.  Subsequently,  the \nGovernment  has  decided  to  corporatize  Pakistan  Railways.  With  a  view  to  supporting  private \nsector participation in railways, in 2002, an ordinance for establishing a rail regulatory authority \nwas approved, although this is not yet operational.  \n\n8. \nPorts.  Pakistan  has  two  operational  overseas  ports,  Karachi  Port,  run  by  the  Karachi \nPort  Trust,  which  includes  private  sector  representation,  and  Qasim  Port,  which  is  run  by  the \nPort Qasim Authority. Ninety-five percent of Pakistani\u2019s foreign trade passes through these two \nports, although the Government is currently developing a third port in Gwadar.6 Despite recent \nefficiency  gains,  which  were  due  mainly  to  commercialization,  Pakistan\u2019s  ports  are  still \nexpensive  and  inefficient  by  international  standards.  Estimates  indicate  that  freight  handling \ncosts are 1.5 times those in Mumbai and 4.5 times those in Colombo. \n\n9. \nIn 1990, the Government embarked on a policy of implementing the landlord model for \nthe Karachi and Qasim ports. Under this model, port services are provided by private operators, \nwhereas  the  port  authority  retains  the  port  infra-structure  and  regulatory  functions.  In  line  with \nthis model, the container terminal operations have been privatized, and applications for leasing \nthe general cargo berths at Karachi Port have already been invited. Once the successful bidder \nhas been selected, the private sector will handle 90% of terminal operations at Karachi Port. A \nsimilar  approach  is  planned  for  Gwadar  Port,  and  the  Government  is  holding  preliminary \ndiscussions  with  potential  terminal  operators.  Small  projects  on  a  build-operate-transfer  basis \nhave been undertaken in the ports subsector, but these have not involved significant funding.   \n\n3. \n\nWater Subsector \n\n10. \nThe underdeveloped state of water and sanitation facilities impairs economic growth and \naggravates poverty. Only 39% of the population has access to piped water and most people are \nexposed  to  unsafe  and  polluted  water.  Only  42%  of  the  population  has  access  to  sanitation \nfacilities.7 With the exception of a few big cities, sewerage facilities do not exist, causing serious \npublic health problems. Recent surveys point to the high prevalence of infant diarrhea, and the \nresultant  infant  mortality,  due  to  polluted  water.8  Massive  investment  is  required  to  upgrade \nwater  and  sanitation  services.  A  recent  study  states  that  major  water  structures  are  operating \n\n                                                 \n6 In 2003, the total cargo throughput was 26 million tons at Karachi Port and 16 million tons at Qasim Port. Karachi \nPort  has  a  container  capacity  of  1.1  million  20-foot  equivalent  units,  that  of  Qasim  Port  is  0.5  million  20-foot \nequivalent units, and that of Gwadar Port will be 54,000 20-foot equivalent units. \n\n7  The  National  Water  Quality  Monitoring  Program  notes  that  in  2004,  bacterial  contamination  of  household  water \n\nsources ranged from 48 to 100%. \n\n8  The  Pakistan  social  and  living  standards  survey  undertaken  in  FY2004  indicates  that  16%  of  children  under  5 \n\nsuffered from diarrhea in the 30-day period prior to the survey. \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n25 \n\nwell  beyond  their  intended  lifetimes  and  estimates  the  cost  of  upgrading  Pakistan's  water \ninfrastructure at between $60 billion and $70 billion.9 \n\n11. \nThe  MTDF  articulates  the  need  to  address  the  shortage  of  water  and  improve  reliable \nservices  for  irrigation  and  drinking  water  supply  and  for  sanitation  (including  sewerage  and \nwaste  disposal).  It  also  emphasizes  the  potential  role  of  private  investment.  So  far,  however, \nfew private investments have been made or are being prepared. \n\nThe  Constitution  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  (1973)  provides  for  a  federal \n12. \nparliamentary system in which the four provinces enjoy a degree of autonomy, with legislative \nand  regulatory  responsibilities  divided  between  the  federation  and  the  provinces.  While  the \npower  subsector  and  national  highways  and  roads  are  the  exclusive  domain  of  the  federal \nGovernment, the water subsector falls largely within the jurisdiction of provincial governments. \nProvincial  infrastructure  regulatory  authorities  have  been  established  to  regulate  the  water \nsubsector and other areas that fall under provincial jurisdiction, such as urban transport. \n\n                                                 \n9  World  Bank.  2005.

This focus is \nevident in the medium-term development framework for 2005\u20132010 published in May 2005. The absence of adequate \ninfrastructure has been one of the main bottlenecks to achieving all-around growth and reducing poverty. Promoting \nprivate participation in infrastructure (PPI) will create fiscal space for the Government to invest in the social sector.     \n \nThe provision  of infrastructure  will also  boost construction, manufacturing, services, and agriculture. This in turn  will \ngenerate  employment  opportunities.  The  initiative  is  a  high  priority  for  promoting  sustainable  economic  growth.  To \nprovide  infrastructure  services,  institutional  mechanisms  are  being  put  into  place  that  address  the  concerns  of  both \ninfrastructure providers and users, including a proper enabling environment in terms of a policy, legal, regulatory, and \ninstitutional framework. \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                       Targeting Classification: General intervention  \n \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nHigh-quality  and  reasonably  priced  infrastructure  will  benefit  the  overall  economy  in  several  ways.  For  example, \naround-the-clock  availability  of  power  at  reasonable  prices  will  improve  the  productivity  of  the  manufacturing  sector \nand lead to job expansion. At the same time, reduced operating costs through low-cost infrastructure will improve the \nperformance of manufacturing units, services, and agriculture and could potentially lead to additional investment.       \n \nWhile the provision of infrastructure has an immediate impact on productivity and growth, the creation of an enabling \nenvironment  for  providing  and  operating  infrastructure  units  is  essential;  however,  the  impact  of  policy  reform  to \npromote PPI will be indirect and not immediately measurable.  \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n No  \n\n  Yes \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nUnder  the  Private  Participation  in  Infrastructure  Program  (the  Program),  a  task  force  has  been  established  that \nincludes  representatives  of  the  Government,  professional  bodies,  regulatory  institutions,  and  the  private  sector  and \nhas  been  directed  to  develop  a  PPI  policy  framework  and  oversee  its  implementation  by  means  of  a  consultative \nprocess.  An  iterative  dialogue  between  the  task  force  and  topic-specific  specialist  working  groups,  along  with \nconsultations  with  provincial  authorities,  will  ensure  that  the  policy  framework  will  reflect  the  concerns  of  all \nstakeholders.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe consultative process between the task force and the working groups will be designed to ensure that the process \nof  policy  formulation  is  participatory.  Stakeholder  participation  will  be  a  key  element  of  the  design  of  the  processes \nwhereby  the  task  force,  the  topic-specific  working  groups,  and  the  consultants  take  the  process  forward.  The  task \nforce, which is envisaged as an apex body, will be consulted during the policy formulation process. This process is a \ncritical part of developing the enabling environment for PPI projects.  \n\n   Yes               \n\n No \n\nD. Gender Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe technical assistance is not designed to specifically address issues related to women. Nevertheless, Subprogram \n1 is expected to be beneficial for women in that, for example, improvements in water supply and sanitation will have a \npositive impact on women.   \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n  No \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n51 \n\n \nPlan Required \n \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None  \n\n \n \nE.

The Program will also \nsupport policy development and capacity building in key \ninstitutions to support PPI, and thus will have no \nresettlement impact. Capacity building in the Private \nPower and Infrastructure Board (PPIB), the National \nHighway Authority (NHA), and the Infrastructure Project \nDevelopment Facility (IPDF) will support the \nestablishment of functions to assess and address \nresettlement related to PPI projects. Measures will build \non systems already established in Pakistan, and the \ndesign of standard operating procedures will take relevant \nAsian Development Bank policy guidelines into account.   \n \nThe policy and regulatory improvements and financing \narrangements will likely result in better access to and \nimproved quality of infrastructure services. Eventual \naffordability issues will be addressed at the PPI project \nlevel and may require certain capital subsidies. \n \nA positive labor impact is expected as a result of direct \nand indirect employment generation through better \nprovision of infrastructure and related services. \n \n\nUnder the Program, the Government will adopt safeguard \npolicies for indigenous peoples and specific guidelines for \ntheir application to PPI projects. The Program will also \nsupport policy development and capacity building to \nsupport PPI in key institutions. The Program will therefore \nhave no negative impact on indigenous peoples. The \ncapacity building in PPIB, NHA, and IPDF will support the \nestablishment of functions to assess and address issues \npertinent to indigenous peoples related to PPI projects. \nMeasures will build on systems established in Pakistan, \nand the design of standard operating procedures will take \nrelevant Asian Development Bank policy guidelines into \naccount.   \n\nEnvironment. The Program will support policy \ndevelopment and capacity building of key institutions to \nsupport PPI and, therefore, have no impact on the \nenvironment. The capacity building in IPDF, NHA, and \nPPIB, will support the establishment of functions to \nassess and address environmental issues related to PPI \nprojects. Measures will build on systems established in \nPakistan, and the design of standard operating \nprocedures will take relevant Asian Development Bank \npolicy guidelines into account.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 September 2006) \n", "Currency Unit \u2013  Pakistan rupee/s (PRe/PRs) \n", "PRe1.00 =  $0.01651  \n$1.00 =  PRs60.56 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ADB \nFY \nGDP \nIPDF \nLIBOR \nMTDF \nNHA \nOCR \nPPI \nPPIB \nTA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \nAsian Development Bank \nfiscal year \ngross domestic product \nInfrastructure Project Development Facility \nLondon interbank offered rate  \nMedium-Term Development Framework \nNational Highway Authority \nordinary capital resources \nprivate participation in infrastructure \nPrivate Power and Infrastructure Board \ntechnical assistance \n", "NOTES \n \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 30 June.
