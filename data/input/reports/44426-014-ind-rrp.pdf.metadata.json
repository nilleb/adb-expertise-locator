The  Indian  power  sector  has  a  history  of  growing  demand  for  and \nchronic shortages of electricity.2 During FY2010, the country\u2019s peak power deficit was at 12.7% \nand  the  average  energy  deficit  at  10.1%.  The  country  is  in  constant  need  of  additional  power \nsupply and the power sector suffers the shortfalls in both generation and transmission capacity. \nAchieving efficient delivery of all the power that the growing economy needs is a national priority \nand critical to sustaining India\u2019s long-term development. \n \n4. \nTo  alleviate  the  country\u2019s  acute  power  shortage,  the  Government  of  India  has \ntraditionally  focused  on  increasing  power  generation.  The  private  sector  has  joined  this  effort \nand has added greatly to generation capacity over the last 4 years,3 but transmission investment \nhas lagged. India has an installed generation capacity of 173,626 megawatts (MW) at present \nbut its interregional transmission capacity of about 23,800 MW is 13.7% of this total. Based on \nincreasing  generation  capacity,  commensurate  improvements  in  the  transmission  system \nexpansion are urgently needed.   \n \n5. \nTo optimize the transfer and use of power throughout the country, the government aims \nto  integrate  its  five  regional  power  grids,  which  serve  the  northern,  northeastern,  eastern, \nwestern, and southern regions. Although individual regions try to connect and synchronize the \nstate power systems within their grids, limited interregional transmission capacity has restricted \nthe  transfer  of  power  between  them.  Interregional  transmission  superhighways  are  needed \nbecause India\u2019s natural energy resources and generation sites are unevenly distributed. Without \nthese highways, regions with surplus power at a given time cannot effectively transfer electricity \nto regions facing power deficits. To use energy efficiently through the nation and overcome this \nregional disparity, the government\u2019s five-year plans seek to increase interregional transmission \ncapacity from 23,800 MW to 27,950 MW by FY2012, 57,000 MW by FY2015, and 75,000 MW \nby  FY2017.  Strengthening  the  interregional  transmission  network  will  promote  open  access  to \npower  supply,  increase  investment  in  both  generation  and  distribution,  help  integrate  the \nelectricity market, and encourage power trading and competitive electricity prices. \n \n6. \nBorrower. As the country\u2019s central transmission utility, POWERGRID is responsible for \nplanning, developing, and operating India\u2019s national transmission network, operating more than \n95%  of  interregional  and  interstate  power  transmission. 4 POWERGRID  was  incorporated  in \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Sector Assessment (Summary): Energy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n3  After  adding  1,931  MW  in  additional  capacity  during  the  Tenth  Five  Year  Plan  (FY2003\u2013FY2007),  private \ninvestment  had  already  raised  capacity  by  11,040  MW  as  of  31  January  2011  under  the  current  plan  (FY2008\u2013\nFY2012).  \n\n4  Unlike interregional and interstate transmission, intrastate transmission is owned by state utilities. \n\n\f2 \n\n1989 as a public limited company wholly owned by the central government. The company was \ninitially  listed  in  the  domestic  stock  markets  in  October  2007  with  an  initial  float  of  11%  of  its \nshares.  In  2010,  the  government  reduced  its  shareholdings  to  69%.  By  the  end  of  the  twelfth \nfive-year plan up to FY2017, POWERGRID plans to invest about $22 billion to more than double \nthe size of its network. This will be crucial to making effective use of the new power generation \nbeing  developed  by  public  and  private  utilities.  To  support  its  ambitious  investment  plan,  the \ncompany  proposes  to  diversify  its  sources  of  debt  capital  by  tapping  the  commercial  lending \nmarket. POWERGRID now relies predominantly on two sources of debt: domestic bond issues \n(67% of total debt outstanding) and sovereign guaranteed loans from multilateral banks (27%).5 \nTo  help  strengthen  and  diversify  POWERGRID\u2019s  ability  to  raise  funding  for  future  investment, \nthe  government  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  include  a  unique  financing \nstructure  in  the  2010  country  program,  combining  a  nonsovereign  loan  and  a  sovereign \nguaranteed loan in a single financing package. The government wants to demonstrate this novel \nfinancing  package  as  a  transitional  arrangement  for  large  publicly  owned  entities,  including \ncentral  public  sector  undertakings  (CPSUs)  that  must  increasingly  become  capable  of  raising \nmarket  funds  on  their  own  account.  Doing  so  will  enable  the  CPSUs  to  meet  their  sizable \ninvestment  requirements  independently  while  gradually  reducing  dependence  on  government \nguarantees.  \n \n7. \nProject design. POWERGRID\u2019s immediate investment plans focus on the transmission \nprojects required to deliver electricity from 55 new IPP power generation plants to primary load \ncenters.  Known  collectively  as  the  high  capacity  power  transmission  corridors  program,  these \nprojects  include  nine  major  transmission  schemes  approved  by  the  Central  Electricity \nRegulatory  Commission  (CERC)  with  an  estimated  total  cost  of  more  than  $12.9  billion.  The \nproject proposed for ADB financing is the biggest of these transmission schemes and involves \n14  IPPs  and  a  public  power  trading  company  in  Chhattisgarh.  It  will  strengthen  interregional \ntransmission  between  the  western  and  the  northern  regional  grids  and  supply  additional  bulk \npower to the north from generation of IPPs in Chhattisgarh, which will generate over 15,000 MW \nin total.6 The project will create a high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system using \nsmart grid technology to support stable, efficient, flexible, and economical long-distance power \ntransfer  among  its  interconnected  systems.  HVDC  is  a  least-cost  and  low-carbon  investment \noption. \n \nAlignment  of  ADB  strategy  and  operations.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \n8. \nStrategy 20207 and the 2009\u20132012 India country partnership strategy. The country partnership \nstrategy  includes  continuous  support  for  interstate  and  interregional  transmission  networks  as \npart  of  the  national  level  sector  development  strategy.  It  also  directs  ADB  to  leverage  the \nfinancing  capacity  of  CPSUs  through  its  nonsovereign  lending  modality  to  help  them  meet \nsubstantial borrowing requirements under the government\u2019s five-year plans.8 \n \n9. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  sector  policy  directive,  which  highlights  the \nenhancement  of  energy  efficiency  in  transmission  systems.  Since  1995,  ADB  has  provided \nPOWERGRID with five sovereign guaranteed loans to help strengthen the transmission system \nnationally.  Three  ongoing  loans  comprise  a  sector  loan  and  two  loan  tranches  from  a \n\n                                                \n5  The  balance  6%  of  debt  is  mostly  from  legacy  domestic  bank  facilities,  suppliers\u2019  credit  transactions,  and \n\nsovereign-guaranteed facilities from bilateral agencies dating from the 1990s to the early 2000s. \n\n6  HVDC transmission technology will improve efficiency and reduce transmission loss when compared with existing \ninterregional alternating current transmission system. The new system  is to deliver 3,000 MW initially and will be \nincreased to 6,000 MW by adding upgraded terminals later. The rest of power generated from IPPs will be supplied \nwithin the western region. \n\n7  ADB.  2008.  Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n8  The  2010  country  program  for  India  confirmed  the  government\u2019s  aim  to  graduate  strong  CPSUs  from  use  of \n\nsovereign facilities in a phased manner, in favor of funding other development programs. \n\n\fmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF). 9  These  facilities  have  had  satisfactory  performance, \nwarranting  continued  ADB  engagement  with  POWERGRID. 10  The  Independent  Evaluation \nDepartment 2010 validation report for the second loan rated POWERGRID\u2019s performance highly \nsuccessful.11 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe project impact will be to accelerate the development of the interregional grid system \nto  deliver  increased  power  supply  to  sustain  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth.  The  project \noutcome,  strengthened  transmission  capacity  and  more  efficient  operations,  will  increase \nreliable power supply from private IPPs and public utilities through the interconnected grid. The \nproject  will  facilitate  integration  of  electricity  markets  and  create  power  trading  opportunities \nthrough  open  access  and  competition  among  private  and  public  utilities.  It  will  expand  the \nmarket  for  potential  power  sellers  and  buyers  beyond  their  own  regional  grids.  This  will  help \npromote private investment in generation and distribution. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nThe  project  outputs  will  include  (i)  a  strengthened  interregional  transmission  network \nbetween  the  northern  and  western  grid  regions  through  physical  investment;  and  (ii) \nimprovements  in  POWERGRID\u2019s  access  to  and  management  of  financial  credit  by  the \npromotion  of  diversification  of  its  funding  sources  through  combined  nonsovereign  loan  and \nsovereign  guaranteed  loan  of  ADB.  The  physical  output  will  comprise  (i)  800  kilovolts  (kV) \nHVDC  transmission  line between Champa  in  Chhattisgarh  and  Kurukshetra  in  Haryana (about \n1,365 kilometers); and (ii) establishment of HVDC terminals at Champa and Kurukshetra. \n \nD. \n \n12. \n \n\nThe total investment cost is estimated at the equivalent of $2,250 million (Table 1).12 \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \nItem \nBase Costa \nA. \n1.

The  ADB  loans  will  be  used \nprimarily  to  implement  the  HVDC  terminals  on  a  turnkey  basis.  To  assure  that  funds  are \nefficiently deployed and available for this portion of the project,  the sovereign loan will only be \nmade  available  upon  the  closure  and  availability  of  the  nonsovereign  loan.  The  remaining \nproject cost will be financed from proceeds from POWERGRID\u2019s regular domestic bond issues \nand/or other financiers.14 Table 2 summarizes the financing plan. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\n  \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank (sovereign guaranteed loan) \nAsian Development Bank (nonsovereign corporate loan)  \nPOWERGRID (internal resources) \nPOWERGRID (other sources)a \n\n Total \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n500.0 \n250.0 \n675.0 \n825.1 \n2,250.1 \n\nShare of  \nTotal (%) \n\n22.2 \n11.1 \n30.0 \n36.7 \n100.0 \n\nPOWERGRID = Power Grid Corporation of India. \na   Expected  to  be  POWERGRID\u2019s  domestic  bond  issuance  and/or  parallel  financing  from  the \n\ncommercial banking sector and/or other financial institutions.  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n14. \nSovereign  guaranteed  loan.  The  government  and  POWERGRID  have  requested  a \nsovereign guaranteed loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance \nthe  project. The  loan will  have a 25-year  term,  including  a grace  period of  5 years,  an  annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with the ADB loan facility based on the London interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR),  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  guarantee  agreements.  The  government  and \nPOWERGRID  have  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that \nthese  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \nNonsovereign loan. A parallel loan to POWERGRID is proposed for up to $250 million \n15. \nwithout sovereign guarantee, with a maturity of 15 years, including a grace period 4 years. The \nloan  will  carry  an  interest  rate,  commitment  and  front-end  fees  to  be  determined  by  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment committee. The loan will be supported by the strength of POWERGRID\u2019s corporate \ncredit.15 The  loan  is  proposed  to  be  secured  by  a  pari  passu  floating  charge  on  the  corporate \nassets of POWERGRID, details of which will be agreed during loan negotiations. \n \n16. \nRisk  participation. ADB is exploring a range of risk-sharing arrangements with eligible \ncommercial cofinanciers to transfer a portion of the commercial and political risks in respect of \nthe nonsovereign loan. \n \n17. \nindustry, group, and single project exposure limits for ADB nonsovereign investments. \n \n\nInvestment  limitations.

All \nprocurement  under the project  will  follow  International  Competitive  Bidding  in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \nDisbursement.  The  sovereign  and  nonsovereign  loan  proceeds  will  jointly  finance  the \n20. \nprocurement of equipment. The financing and disbursements for each contract package will be \non a pro rata basis.18 \n \nOther arrangements. The project was approved for implementation by the government \n21. \nunder  the  Electricity  Act,  2003.  POWERGRID  has  already  signed  bulk  power  transmission \nagreements  (BPTA)  for  the  project  with  14  IPPs  and  the  Chhattisgarh  State  Power  Trading \nCompany to ensure offtake arrangements as defined by the CERC regulations. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n22. \n \n\nValue added by ADB assistance. The project is innovative in the following respects:  \n\n(i) \n\nEnergy  efficient  technology.  The  project  will  adopt  advanced  800  kV  HVDC \ntransmission lines that have so far been used only elsewhere in India and in the \n\n                                                \n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 The procurement capacity assessment report has identified no substantial issues on project implementation. \n18 Debt funding for the project will be disbursed from the sovereign and nonsovereign loan proceeds simultaneously. \nFunds  from  the  sovereign  facility  will  only  be  disbursable  upon  the  availability  of  funds  from  the  nonsovereign \nfacility. Disbursements from the two loans will be maintained, at minimum, on specific weighted percentages. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China. This technology  will  significantly  reduce  power  loss \nand  support  low-carbon  growth. 19 A  large-scale  HVDC  supergrid  network  can \nalso  help  stabilize  power  supply  frequencies  and  voltages,  which  in  turn  will \nsupport development of smart grid operations. \nPromotion of private sector development. Through public sector\u2019s support for \nthe  improvement  of  interregional  transmission,  the  project  will  promote  private \nsector  development  in  power  generation  by  facilitating  the  access  of  IPPs  to \nmarkets. Public and private investment will be combined through the entire power \nsector  value  chain  to  leverage  project  benefits.  Better  interregional  grid \nconnectivity  will  greatly  expand  power  trading  opportunities  and  consequently \nboost  IPP  businesses.  Because  the  government  has  opened  investment  in \ninterregional transmission to competitive bidding, the project is also expected to \nattract private developers to similar transmission projects in other regions.20 \nPOWERGRID\u2019s self-financing capacity improvement. This will be the first time \nADB has combined sovereign and nonsovereign facilities for a single borrower. A \nforeign  commercial  term  loan  without  credit  support  from  governments  will  also \nbe  a  first  for  POWERGRID.  The  government  encouraged  ADB  to  provide  the \nnonsovereign  loan  to  help  POWERGRID  transition  to  and  gain  experience  with \nmore  commercial  forms  of  funding.  POWERGRID  is  now  nearly  completely \nreliant  on  the  domestic  bond  markets  and  recognizes  the  need  to  diversify  its \nsources  of  debt. 21  During  the  loan  process  and  through  ongoing  capacity \ndevelopment  technical  assistance,22 ADB  will  help  POWERGRID  strengthen  its \ncorporate  credit  capabilities  to  promote  access  to  international  capital  markets \nand improve its fiscal planning and risk management. The nonsovereign loan will \nhelp  POWERGRID  (a)  establish  a  much-needed  benchmark \nforeign \ncommercial  borrowing,  and  (b)  enhance  its  capacity  for  dealing  with  foreign \ncommercial \nfuture  commercial \nborrowing program, such as an offshore syndicated loan or an international bond \nd\u00e9but.23 The nonsovereign loan facility will demonstrate to other financially viable \nCPSUs how to go about raising funds for the country\u2019s economic development in \na  more  autonomous  manner.  It  will  thereby  serve  as  a  catalyst  for  sustainable \neconomic  growth  while  reducing  strain  on  government  finances  and  increasing \nfiscal space for other priority social programs. \n\ninstitutions  before \n\nlaunching  any \n\nlending \n\nfor \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n23. \nThe  800  kV  HVDC  transmission  system  is  state-of-the-art,  commercially  proven \ntechnology.  The  first  such  system  in  India  is  being  implemented  by  POWERGRID  under  the \nADB-financed  MFF  (footnote  9).  The  project  is  expected  to  enhance  energy  efficiency  by \nreducing  transmission  losses  of  approximately  3%  below  levels  of  typical  conventional \n\n                                                \n19  The  project  will  support  a  reduction  in  carbon  dioxide  emissions  quantified  by  the  efficiency  gained  from \ntransmitting  a  fixed  amount  of  energy  across  an  HVDC  transmission  system  versus  a  conventional  alternating \ncurrent transmission system of equivalent length. \n\n20 To meet sizable investment requirements in interstate transmission, POWERGRID will also be required to consider \nexpanding  the  transmission  network  strategically  through  structures  such  as  public\u2013private  partnership  in  a \ncompetitive environment. POWERGRID has established nine joint ventures with private and public companies. \n21 This  is  to  promote  funding  sustainability  and  mitigate  risks  from  any  adverse  changes  in  the  bond  markets  that \n\ncould impair the investment plans. The domestic market has been constrained for large funding. \n\n22 ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Innovative Financing Instruments for Power Grid. Manila. With support from \n\nADB, POWERGRID formulated the debt financing strategy. \n\n23 To diversify its funding sources, POWERGRID has explored other nonsovereign funding to finance a portion of the \nproject. For the ongoing project financed by ADB, POWERGRID is also pursuing the equivalent of combined $720 \nmillion in buyer\u2019s export credits and nonsovereign commercial borrowing. \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\ntransmission systems. This in turn could result in the lowering of carbon dioxide emissions from \npower systems by an estimated 536,000 tons per year.24 \n \nB. \n \nThe  project\u2019s  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  9.54%, 25  higher  than  the  weighted \n24. \naverage cost of capital. Its economic internal rate of return is  estimated to be 22.10%.26 Thus, \nthe project is financially viable and economically sustainable. \n \nThe  government  has  accorded  POWERGRID  \u201cNavratna\u201d  (jewel)  status,  which  gives  a \n25. \nCPSU  managerial  and  financial  autonomy  despite  majority  government  ownership.  While \nPOWERGRID  does  not  currently  have  an  international  credit  rating,  it  has  top  domestic  credit \nratings. 27  Based  on  the  cost-plus  nature  of  the  tariff  setting  process  and  POWERGRID\u2019s \nsuperior  operating  efficiency,  it  has  increased  revenues  and  net  profits  consistently,  28 \nmaintaining a robust financial position with stable cash flows to cover its cost of services, capital \ninvestment, and debt payments. Over the last 3 years, it achieved a post-tax return on equity of \nover 10% and a debt service coverage ratio of 1.5. In FY2011, return on equity rose to 12.6% \nand  the  debt  service  coverage  ratio  improved  to  1.8.  POWERGRID\u2019s  debt\u2013equity  ratio  has \nremained  below  70:30.  Based  on  its  strong  credit,  POWERGRID  has  frequently  raised  large \namounts  by  issuing  domestic  bonds  and  equity.29 Although  POWERGRID  has  an  aggressive \ninvestment plan and a large need for additional borrowings, financial projections show that it will \nmaintain a sound financial position even under stress scenarios. \n \nC. \n \n26.   Enterprise  risk  management.  Through  public  offerings  for  shares  and  bond  issues, \nPOWERGRID  has  established  a  sound  corporate  governance  system.  In  February  2011, \nPOWERGRID  introduced  an  enterprise  risk  management  (ERM)  framework  to  strengthen  its \ncorporate governance. The framework has identified risks under four categories: (i) strategic, (ii) \noperational,  (iii)  financial,  and  (iv)  others  (e.g.,  human  resources).  The  ERM  also  envisages \nappointment of a chief risk officer and a risk management committee. The ERM framework has \nbeen put in place and staff training began in June 2011. \n \nAnticorruption  policy.  POWERGRID  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \n27. \n(1998, as amended to date) and its Policy on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing \nof  Terrorism  (2003).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  ADB  will  require  POWERGRID  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal \nprocedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism and covenant \nwith ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The financing documentation between ADB \nand  POWERGRID  will  allow  ADB  to  review  and  examine  any  violation or  potential  violation of \nthese  undertakings.  As  a  listed  company,  POWERGRID  is  subject  to  extensive  disclosure \nrequirements under the laws of India. \n \n                                                \n24 Clean Development Mechanism Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Financial  Analysis  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  The  weighted  average  cost  of \n\nGovernance \n\ncapital is 3.92%. \n\n26 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Since 2001, POWERGRID\u2019s domestic bonds have been rated AAA by CRISIL and LAAA by ICRA. From 2008, the \n\nCredit Analysis & Research has also given these bonds a rating of AAA. \n\n28 In FY2011, POWERGRID generated Rs91 billion in revenue, resulting in Rs27 billion in net profit, up 32% over the \n\nprevious financial year. \n\n29 Since FY2008, POWERGRID has issued new equity shares and the government has disposed of shares in equal \namounts. In FY2011, POWERGRID raised equity of Rs74.4 billion. POWERGRID has regularly issued bonds in the \ndomestic market since FY2001, raising more than Rs100 billion in FY2011 alone. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nSafeguards \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n \n28. \nThe power sector plays a key role in improving economic development and social well-\nbeing.30 The  project  has  developed  an  implementation  strategy  to  avoid  or  minimize  negative \nimpacts  on  affected  people,  with  a  focus  on  women  and  vulnerable  groups. 31 Key  social  and \ngender-related design features include (i) gender-inclusive consultative processes, (ii) additional \nassistance  for  affected  households  headed  by  women  in  a  resettlement  framework,  (iii)  equal \nopportunities for women to access employment and equal pay under civil works contracts, and \n(iv) ensuring the incorporation of women's needs and concerns in all aspects related to project \ndesign and development (e.g., sanitation). \n \nE. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment, 32  category  B  for  involuntary \n29. \nresettlement,33 and  category  C  for  indigenous  people.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009), the potential environmental and social impacts and risks of the project \nhave  been  identified.  Effective  measures  to  avoid, minimize, mitigate,  and compensate for the \nadverse impacts are incorporated in a resettlement plan and initial environmental examination, \nincluding  the  environmental  monitoring  and  management  plan.34 The  institutional  capacity  and \ncommitment  of  POWERGRID  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  risks  are \ndeemed  adequate. 35  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  are \nconducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nF. \n \nCounterparty  risk. POWERGRID is exposed to counterparty risk both in (i) completion \n30. \nof  generation  projects,  and  (ii)  offtake  of  electricity  from  those  projects  upon  commercial \noperations.  However,  POWERGRID  is  well  protected  by  regulations.  BPTAs  are  signed \nbetween  generators  and  POWERGRID  on  terms  defined  by  regulation.  Each  generator \nconstructing  a  new  power  plant  must  post  a  performance  bond  with  POWERGRID  to  cover \nliquidated  damages  in  the  event  of  delayed  completion. 37  After  power  generation  begins, \ntransmission  charge  liability  shifts  from  the  generators  to  the  designated  offtakers,  who  are \nusually state distribution utilities. While the credit quality of the offtakers varies significantly, all \nofftakers  must  post  a  letter  of  credit  covering  105%  of  2  month\u2019s  projected  dues  to \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures36 \n\n                                                \n30 Three  of  the  five  states  crossed  by  the  project  have  poverty  levels  above  the  national  average  of  26.1% \n(Chhattisgarh, 44%; Madhya Pradesh, 37.4%; and Uttar Pradesh, 31.2%). Transmission extension and efficiency  \ngains will indirectly enhance electricity access through the distribution network to end users, including the poor. \n31 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 The  project  avoided  routing  transmission  lines  through  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  While  the  government \nexempted  transmission  projects  from  environmental  clearances,  POWERGRID  will  secure  all  necessary  forest \nclearances prior to construction and installation, in accordance with the Forest Conservation Act 1980. \n\n33 None  of  the  affected  people  will  be  physically  relocated  from  their  homes.  However,  two  substations  for  the \nterminals will acquire about 102 acres of private land and impact 190 persons, 170 persons of whom (34 families) \nwill  be  significantly  affected  due  to  land  loss.  They  will  be  duly  compensated  for  their  economic  losses,  in \naccordance with the specific entitlements, compensation rates, and livelihood restoration defined for the project. \n34 Initial Environmental Examination and Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). POWERGRID ensures contractor\u2019s liabilities for safeguards in bid documents and will submit progress reports \non safeguard implementation to ADB. \n\n35 POWERGRID  has  established  its  corporate  environmental  and  social  policy  and  procedures  (ESPP),  which  is  a \ncomprehensive environmental and social management system. The ESPP was developed in 1998 and revised in \n2009,  integrating  key  guidance  and  best  practices  from  the  World  Bank  through  a  multi-stakeholder  and \nparticipatory consultation process. \n\n36 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) is based \n\non the project-specific level instead of the POWERGRID corporate level. \n\n37 In the event of an incurable default by a given offtaker, the BPTAs require that remaining customers are liable pro \n\nrata for making POWERGRID whole on transmission charges on a joint basis. \n\n\fPOWERGRID. The large number of generators and offtakers to which POWERGRID is exposed \nprovides a diversification benefit from supply and sales arrangements, thus mitigating payment \nrisks.  Since  the  above  mechanisms  were  introduced,  POWERGRID  has  not  experienced  a \ncustomer default.  \n \nCompletion  risk.  There  are  two  types  of  completion  risks:  (i)  delay  in  completion  by \n31. \ngenerators  while  the  transmission  line  is  ready,  and  (ii)  a  completion  delay  by  POWERGRID \nwhile  the  generators  are  ready  to  connect.  POWERGRID  is  protected  from  the  first  risk  by \nperformance  bonds  and  transmission  charge  coverage  under  the  BPTAs.  Under  the  second \nrisk, POWERGRID is liable to generators for payment of liquidated damages equivalent to the \ntransmission  charge  only  if  POWERGRID  cannot  arrange  an  alternative  route  of  evacuation. \nTypically, alternative transmission routes are available in the national grid network and very few \ntransmission  projects  of  POWERGRID  have  been  delayed  beyond  1  year.  Sensitivity  analysis \nindicates  that  a  1-year  delay  of  all  projects  in  POWERGRID\u2019s  development  program  would \nresult in limited impact on the company\u2019s financial position.38 POWERGRID and the generators \nregularly hold coordination meetings to harmonize progress on their respective projects. \n \nPolitical  and  regulatory  risk.  POWERGRID\u2019s  transmission  tariffs  and  revenues  are \n32. \ndefined  under  CERC  regulations. 39  Because  the  framework  is  adjusted  every  5  years, \nPOWERGRID\u2019s revenues are subject to some uncertainty. Despite this, CERC has historically \nprovided  reasonable  adjustments  and  incentives  to  promote  the  stable  performance  of  the \ntransmission sector to ensure a climate of sustainable investment and fiscal health in line with \nthe  National Tariff Policy.  As the  designated  central  transmission  utility,  POWERGRID  plays  a \npivotal  role  in  national  transmission  system  planning,  grid  development,  and  stability  in \noperations. As a corporate entity, it invests in and operates transmission systems according to \ncommercial  business  principles.  In  POWERGRID\u2019s  role  as  the  country\u2019s  central  transmission \nutility, the government could in theory direct the public sector entity to undertake activities that \nmay  be  commercially  disadvantageous  but  are  deemed  by  government  to  be  in  the  national \ninterest.  This  possibility  is  mitigated  by  the  fact  that,  as  a  publicly  traded  company, \nPOWERGRID must operate in compliance with requirements of the Securities Exchange Board \nof India under the listing rules of the national stock exchanges. In addition, since POWERGRID \nis  a  substantial  source  of  dividends  for  the  government,  it  is  likely  that  the  government  will \ncontinue to support sound commercial operations for POWERGRID to maintain or increase the \nvalue of the government's shareholding. \n \n33. \nCompetitive  risk.  POWERGRID  has  participated  as  a minority joint  venture  party  with \nprivate  or  other  public  utilities  in  nine  projects.  This  reflects  their  partners\u2019  nascent  skills  in \nundertaking  transmission  activities  and  their  consequent  need  to  align  with  an  experienced \nparty. POWERGRID\u2019s participation in these joint ventures has helped build its experience in a \ncompetitive  environment.  Per  CERC  order,  some  transmission  projects  are  now  subject  to \ncompetitive bidding,  and  14  projects  have been selected  by  a  CERC  sanctioned committee  to \ndate.40 In the future, as competition from the private sector increases, there is a possibility that \nthe company\u2019s role may be limited to pure transmission operations, which may affect its revenue \ngrowth and market share. Should this occur, however, POWERGRID\u2019s financial position would \n                                                \n38 Financial  Analysis  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  One-year  delay  of  all  projects \n\nwould be an extreme scenario. \n\n39 Tariff  regulations  permit  POWERGRID  to  pass  through  to  customers,  without  need  for  any  further  regulatory \napproval,  any  increase  in  debt  servicing  cost  due  to  changes  in  interest  rates  or  exchange  rates  on  foreign \ncurrency borrowing and increases in operating costs due to inflation or real price changes. Tariffs are determined \nbased on total final investment costs incurred to implement the project and are recovered via a fixed depreciation \nformula and a fixed return on equity. To date, the regulated tariff structures have adequately provided for recovery \nof all costs of investment and operations of transmission projects while providing a reasonable return on equity. \n40 To attract increased investment in interregional transmission from the private sector, the government issued tariff-\nbased competitive bidding guidelines with effect from January 2011. They provide two forms of private participation \nthrough joint ventures or independent private transmission companies. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nbe maintained due to reduced capital expenditures in such a scenario. High barriers to entry in \nthe transmission business would also give POWERGRID the first-mover advantage and its wide \ntransmission  network  could  mitigate  competitive threats.  While more  competitively  bid  projects \nmay  be  promoted,  stress  testing  under  the  corporate  financial  projection  indicates  that  this  is \nunlikely to have a material impact on POWERGRID\u2019s long-term financial performance.41 \n \n34. \nThe  obligor  risk  rating  for  POWERGRID  is  NSO  5,  equivalent  to  the  sovereign.  The \nnonsovereign facility risk rating is NSO 7, adjusted down two notches from the obligor risk rating \ndue to the proposed tenor of the loan.  Nonsovereign loan pricing will ensure recovery of ADB's \ncost  of  funds  plus  a  reasonable  margin  to  compensate  for  risk.  Margin  and  fees  will  be \nbenchmarked to market pricing. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n35. \nThe  government  and  POWERGRID  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed  in  detail  in  the  project  administration  manual  and  loan  documents.  The  government \nand  POWERGRID  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are  set \nforth in the loan and guarantee agreements for the proposed sovereign loan. \n \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 42  the \n36. \nGovernment of India has confirmed that it has no objection to the proposed nonsovereign loan \nto  POWERGRID.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and  substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by its Board of Directors. \n \n37. \nThe effectiveness of the sovereign loan will be subject to satisfaction of all requirements \nprecedent for disbursement under the nonsovereign loan. Likewise, the nonsovereign loan will \nbe disbursable upon satisfaction of all conditions for disbursements under the sovereign loan. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n \n38. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  of  $500,000,000  to  the  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India  Limited,  to  be \nguaranteed  by  India,  for  the  National  Grid  Improvement  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of \n25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nand guarantee agreements presented to the Board; and \nthe loan of $250,000,000 to the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, without \na  sovereign  guarantee,  for  the  National  Grid  Improvement  Project  in  India  from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  this  report,  and  as  may  be \nreported to the Board. \n\n \n\n9 September 2011 \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n                                                \n41 The scenario assumed that 50% of future POWERGRID projects would be lost due to competition. \n42 ADB. 1966.
