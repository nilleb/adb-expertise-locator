Coal-fired power plants provide secure, inexpensive base-load power \nin many countries. The project introduces supercritical coal-fired power generation, which is the \nbest  available  technology  for  Pakistan.  The  environmental  impact  of  this  technology  would  be \nless than  that  of the  existing  heavy  fuel  oil  (HFO)-fired  power  plants,  and  the  more commonly \nused subcritical coal-fired power generation technology. The project, which is the first stage of a \nmulti-stage government plan for this site,3 has three components: (i) construction and 5 years of \noperational  support  for  a  600-megawatt  (MW)  (net)/660-MW  (nominal)  supercritical  coal-fired \nunit,  with  state-of-the-art  emission  control  devices  at  the  Jamshoro  Thermal  Power  Station \n(TPS)  in  Sindh  province;  (ii)  capacity  development  for  coal-fired  plant  operations;  and  (iii) \nenvironmental remediation of the existing power generation units and site. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \n Pakistan is exploring all options to reduce power load shedding and power cost but has \nfew  medium-term  options  for  affordable,  dependable  power  supply.  Natural  gas  was  the  main \nfuel  used  for  Pakistan\u2019s  base-load  power  plants,4 but  the  country\u2019s  dwindling  reserves  of  gas \nhave  resulted  in  increasing  use  of  high-cost  imported  fuel  oil  for  power  generation.  This  has \nincreased  power  generation  costs  and  exacerbated  the  existing  financial  shortfall,  both  within \nthe  sector  and  the  national  economy.  Compared  to  existing,  inefficient  HFO-fired  plants,  the \nhigher efficiency supercritical generation units and diversification away from imported fuel oil will \nenable  Pakistan  to  increase  its  reliable  supply  of  electricity  and  lower  both  costs  and \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.5 \n \nEnergy  crisis.  Pakistan\u2019s  energy  crisis  depresses  its  economic  performance  and fuels \n4. \nsocial instability. Power shortages equaled about one-third of total demand (4,000\u20135,000 MW) \nduring  most  of  fiscal  year  (FY)  2012.6 Increasing,  unpredictable  load  shedding  is  estimated  to \nconstrain  annual  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  by  at  least  two  percentage  points. \nSmall-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  that  employ  the  largest  number  of  people,  but  cannot \nafford  back-up  electricity  generators  and  fuel,  experience  the  largest  impact.  GDP  growth  has \naveraged 3% since 2007, while GDP growth of 7% is required to generate enough employment \nto absorb new labor market entrants. Poverty reduction and provision of basic necessities to the \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The project is included in the country operations business \n\nplan (2013-2014) for Pakistan. \n\n2   ADB. 2013. Asian Development Outlook 2013. Manila. \n3  The government plans additional 600-MW supercritical coal-fired unit and conversion of existing units to coal.  \n4   Gas-fired  power  generation  overtook  hydropower  in  1996  as  the  main  power  source.  The  share  of  gas  in  the \nthermal generation fuel mix has fallen from 56% (2006) to 44% (2011), while HFO increased from 42% to 54%.     \n5  The existing units at Jamshoro TPS use HFO and emit 930 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilowatt-hour (kWh). \nThe  project  would  emit  750  grams  of  CO2  per  kWh  and  a  subcritical  unit  850  grams  of  CO2  per  kWh.  Backup \ngenerators used to reduce power shortages are substantially less efficient and emit higher volume of CO2.  \n\n6  Ending June 2012. Government of Pakistan, National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). 2012. State of \n\nIndustry Report 2012. Islamabad. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\npoor are immediate challenges for Pakistan. Low economic growth creates an environment for \nrecruitment  by  society\u2019s  radical  elements.  The  government  introduced,  as  a  priority,  the  new \nNational Power Policy to tackle these issues. PRs480 billion (about $4.5 billion) was paid to fuel \ncompanies  and  independent  power  producers  to  clear  payment  arrears.  The  government  is \npursuing  gas  and  power  tariff  rationalization  and  energy  efficiency  measures  such  as \nconservation, transmission and distribution loss reduction, and rehabilitation of power plants.7 \n \n5. \nHigh-power  generation  cost.  Pakistan  has  23,538  MW  of  installed  power  generation \ncapacity  and  14,000  MW  of  available  capacity  on  average.  Even  for  the  available  capacity, \nHFO-fired  power  plants  are  not  fully  utilized  because  of  a  shortage  of  funds  for  fuel.  The \nincrease  in  HFO-fired  power  generation  (high  production  cost)  is  the  major  reason  the  cost-\nrecovery tariff (average tariff) has continuously increased.8 The government has raised the base \ntariff by 106% from February 2008 to June 2013, despite this subsidy has increased to PRs5.79 \nper kilowatt-hour (kWh).9 This puts enormous pressure on the public finances and the country\u2019s \nbalance  of  payments.  For  fiscal  and  economic  sustainability,  the  government  must  lower \nelectricity generation costs and increase supply to reduce adverse impact from power shortages.  \n \n6. \nLowering  the  generation  cost.  The  government  aims  to  increase  coal-based  power \ngeneration  while  decreasing  expensive  HFO  generation.  This  will  require  converting  existing \nHFO  generation  units  and  constructing  new  plants.10 The  imported  HFO  costs  several  times \nmore than domestic or imported coal, and has higher sulfur content.11 Electricity generated from \ncoal,  through  medium-term  fuel  supply  contracts,  will  also  help  stabilize  the  power  price.  The \nNational Power Policy includes plans to diversify the energy mix.  \n \nRenewable and gas-based generation. Improving energy security and affordability, the \n7. \ngovernment  is  pursuing  large  hydropower,  gas,  and  other  projects  using  domestic  resources. \nPakistan  has  a  low  carbon  footprint  because  of  the  large  amount  of  hydropower  and  natural \ngas-based  power  generation.  However,  hydropower\u2019s  contribution  to  total  generation  has \ndeclined,12 and  accounted  for  just  32%  of  power  generated  in  2012.13 Only  6,716  MW  of  a \npotential of over 40,000 MW of hydropower has been tapped, making large hydropower plants \nthe ideal solution. Although large hydropower is the least cost solution, the high capital cost, the \nlong  implementation  period,  and  complex  safeguard  issues  mean  this  is  a  long-term  option. \nSmall  and  medium  sized  run-of-the-river  hydropower  plants  have  shorter  construction  periods \nbut  have  seasonal  and  daily  output  variation  which  makes  them  unsuitable  for  base-load.14 \n\n                                                \n7   Measures in the National Power Policy are reinforced through agreement with International Monetary Fund (IMF). \nIMF. 2013. Pakistan: 2013 Article IV Consultation and Request for an Extended Arrangement Under the Extended \nFund Facility. Washington D.C. \n\n8   HFO-fired power accounts for 34% of the energy mix; at PRs15.94 per kWh, it makes up 77% of total generation \ncosts.  In  comparison,  the  hydropower  cost  was  PRs0.16  per  kWh,  and  gas  PRs4.24  per  kWh  (footnote  6).  The \ncost-recovery tariff has risen from PRs5.5 per kWh in 2008 to PRs14.51 per kWh in 2013. \n\n9   The  subsidies  vary  monthly  according  to  the  consumer  mix,  load  factor,  and  whether  a  periodic  fuel  price \nadjustment was applied during the period. The average tariff increased from PRs4.26 per kWh to PRs8.81 per kWh \nin May 2012, and further to PRs 11.11 per kWh in August 2013.  \n\n10 Emissions for conversion from HFO to gas fired plants would vary according to the state of the existing equipment. \nFor  the  Jamshoro  TPS  oil-fired  units,  after  conversion  the  emissions  would  increase  to  1,172  grams  of  CO2  per \nkWh using imported sub-bituminus coal.   \n\n11 Fuel cost savings between a new HFO fired power generation plant and the project would be $535 million annually.  \n12 Hydropower\u2019s share declined as follows: 72% (1980), 54% (1990), 35% (2000), 32% (2012). \n13 Government of Pakistan, National Transmission and Despatch Company. 2012. Power System Statistics 2011\u201312. \n14 Summer and  winter  output  varies  by around  3,000  MW.  The  government  has spent  $20  million for the  feasibility \nstudy of 4,500MW Diamer  Basha  Dam.  The cost is  estimated  at  $12  billion and  construction  period  of  10  years. \nRanking of priority projects and sector roadmap are set out in Friends of Democratic Pakistan. 2012. A Productive \nand Water-Secure Pakistan. Islamabad. \n\n\f3 \n\nDomestic  gas-fired  generation  will  decline  from  the  current  26%  with  the  depletion  of  existing \ngas  fields,  and  competing  demand  from  industry,  transport,  and  retail  customers  unless \ndomestic  gas  supplies  are  increased. 15 The  abundant  wind  and  solar  resources  are  being \ndeveloped, but their outputs are variable and would not meet the base-load requirements.  \n \n8. \nPower generation mix. Oil-fired power generation is expensive, and used for less than \n5%  of  world  generation.  To  be  competitive  economically,  Pakistan  cannot  afford  continued \nreliance on expensive imported oil for 34% of power generation. Pakistan has one of the lowest \ncarbon  emissions,  19%  of  the  world\u2019s  average. 16  Coal  reserves  in  Pakistan  may  generate \n10,000 MW of power for 350 years. Globally, coal-based power plants generate 40% of power,17 \nbut account for just 0.07% of generation in Pakistan.18  \n \nADB  interventions.  ADB  is  engaged  in  the  energy  sector  through  its  four  multitranche \n9. \nfinancing  facilities  and  private  sector  investments,  which  fund  energy  efficiency,  transmission, \ndistribution,  and  renewable  energy  projects  including  eight  hydropower  and  two  wind  power \nprojects.19 As the sector\u2019s largest donor, ADB conducts policy dialogue on reforms, planning, and \nprovides  sector  assessments  to  the  International  Monetary  Fund.  Ongoing  reforms  follow  the \nrecommendations of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan Energy  Sector Task Force, which ADB \nco-chaired with the government. The report addresses diversification of existing fuel sources.20  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe project\u2019s impact will be an enhanced energy supply in Pakistan. The outcome will be \na more efficient energy mix through diversification from expensive HFO to less expensive coal.    \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nThe project will (i) increase capacity of the Jamshoro TPS by installing a 600-MW (net) \nsupercritical coal-fired unit, using an 80/20 blend of imported sub-bituminous coal and domestic \nlignite when available,21 and provide 5 years of operation and maintenance (O&M) support; (ii) \nensure  compliance  with the  national  environmental  standards  (install  emission  control  devices \nfor  the  existing  units  and  remediating  the  site); 22 (iii)  enhance  capacity  of  GENCO  Holding \nCompany  Limited  (GHCL)  and  Jamshoro  Power  Company  Limited  (JPCL)  by  providing \nfinancial,  technical,  and  operational  training;  and  (iv)  introduce  education  on  coal-fired  plant \noperation. The infrastructure will support government\u2019s plan to have an additional 600-MW unit \nat the same site. The design includes a flue duct interface that will allow adding carbon capture \nand storage (CCS) when the technology is available.23   \n\n                                                \n15 Natural  gas  imports  are  being  explored  through  pipeline  gas  and  liquefied  natural  gas.  The  projects  have  faced \n\ndelays. ADB has been the secretariat for the project to pipe gas from Turkmenistan to Pakistan since 2003. \n\n16  Pakistan\u2018s carbon emission per capita is 0.81 tons per  year according to the International Energy Agency. 2012.  \n\nCO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion.

The first loan of $840 million (OCR Loan 1) \nwill  have a 30-year term,  including  a grace  period of 5  years,  and  will  finance civil  works. The \nsecond loan of $30 million (OCR Loan 2) will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of \n10  years,  and  will  finance  O&M,  and  consulting  services  during  the  construction  phase.  The \nOCR  loans  will  have  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,24 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(the  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction  to  be  capitalized  in  the  loans),  and  such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project  agreements. The government \nalso  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR19,380,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources to help finance the remaining portion of the project. The loan will have a 25-\nyear  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  of  2%  per  annum  during  the \ngrace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. The loan will finance consulting services during the implementation phase \nand  for  capacity  development.

However, the government portion will not be less than 15%. The government will \nrelend to JPCL the OCR Loan 1 and IDB loan proceeds at LIBOR+450 basis points, which is in \nline  with the rate previously allowed by the regulator for passing the tariff onto customers.  For \nOCR Loan 1, the term of the relending will be 30 years, including a grace period of 5 years.  The \ngovernment  will  also  relend  to  JPCL  the  OCR  Loan  2  proceeds,  in  local  currency  equivalent, \nwith interest at the rate of 15% per annum inclusive of foreign exchange risk, and a term of 20 \nyears, including a grace period of 10 years. The government will relend to JPCL the ADF loan \nproceeds,  in local  currency  equivalent,  with interest  at  the  rate  of  15% per  annum  inclusive of \nforeign exchange risk, and a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years.    \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n \n14. \n GHCL will be the executing agency, JPCL the implementing agency, and the Ministry of \nWater  and  Power  the  oversight  body.25 A  project  management  unit  with  sufficient  staff  will  be \nestablished within GHCL, with a project implementation unit established in Jamshoro TPS. The \nengineering,  procurement,  and  construction  (EPC)  contractor  selected  to  build  the  plant  will \nprovide 5 years O&M support after commissioning as part of its contract.26 In order to facilitate \nthe  government\u2019s  plan  for  a  second  unit  (for  which  there  is  currently  insufficient  financing), \nbidders will be required to bid for an optional second unit on same terms, conditions, and price. \nThis option will be valid for 30 months after award of the first unit. Should actual costs for output \n1 of the project be lower than the estimate, residual funds from OCR Loan 1 may be used for a \nsecond  600-MW  supercritical  unit  at  the  same  site  that  meets  all  ADB  policies  and \nrequirements.  At  that  stage,  suitable  due  diligence  will  be  carried  out  and  approval  sought. \nInternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  will  be  used  to  select  contractors  for  installation  of  flue \ngas  desulfurization  (FGD)  for  existing  plants  and  remediation  of  the  site.  A  contractor  for  site \npreparation  will  be  selected  through  national  competitive  bidding.  A  project  implementation \nconsultant  (PIC)  firm  will  be  recruited  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method.27 The \ncoal  supplier(s)  will  be  selected  through  ICB,  with  assistance  from  the  PIC.  The  project \nenvisages  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  of  up  to  20%  of  total  financing.

It is proposed to expand country eligibility for procurement of the EPC contract to build \nthe coal-fired power plant by allowing this procurement in both ADB and IDB member countries. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical  \n\n \nA. \n \n16. \n Jamshoro TPS was selected because of its proximity to Bin Qasim Port and the existing \nrail  system  for  importation  of  coal,  land  availability,  and  construction  access.  Jamshoro  TPS \ncurrently has one oil-fired and three oil and gas dual-fired power generation units, with 850 MW \ninstalled of which 700 MW is available.30 Coal will be delivered by ship and then transported by \ntrain from Bin Qasim Port (160 kilometers from Jamshoro TPS). The railway tracks are in good \ncondition  and  there  are sufficient facilities at the  port  to  handle  the  amount  of coal  needed for \nthe  project.  Moreover,  the  railway  line  will  be  rehabilitated  and  new  locomotives  will  be \npurchased  for  the  project  to  ensure  reliable  delivery.31 A  medium-term  coal  supply  agreement \nwill be signed before EPC contract award.32 Water is supplied via intake pipelines in the Indus \nRiver;  an  additional  pump  station  and  pipelines  will  be  constructed  for  the  new  unit,  with \nwastewater returned to the river after treatment. A new 500-kilovolt transmission line with 1,500-\nMW  transmission  capacity,  financed  through  tranche  3  of  ADB\u2019s  Power  Transmission \nEnhancement Investment Program, will evacuate the generated power.33  \n \n17. \nTo  achieve  affordability,  energy  security,  reliable  base-load  and  diversification  from \nHFO,  coal-fired  power  plants  are  the  optimal  medium  term  option.  Most  countries  begin  coal-\nfired  generation  with  subcritical  plants;  these  are  easier  to  operate,  more  rugged,  and  more \n\n                                                \n29 This cofinancing will be provided on parallel basis and will not be administered by ADB.  \n30 In 2012, Jamshoro TPS generated only 20% of its installed capacity because of a lack of fuel. \n31 A coal transport agreement that includes coal unloading and satisfactory safety measures will be signed prior to the \n\ncoal supply contract award. A private sector concession will be considered by the Pakistan Railway Authority. \n\n32 The coal supply contract (minimum 3 years) has been advertised in local and international newspapers. \n33 The power purchase agreement will include penalties for the transmission company if the transmission line is not \navailable  when  the  project  is  commissioned.  An  additional  1,320  MW  of  power  can  be  reliably  transmitted  from \nJamshoro to the national grid according to the transmission load study. ADB. 2006.

As envisioned \nin  ADB's  Energy  Policy,34 during  project  development  supercritical  technology  was  introduced \nby ADB ensuring cleaner technology to Pakistan. The CO2 emission savings comparing the two \ntechnologies is estimated at 400,000 tons of CO2 per year.35  \n \n18. \nA  mix  of  20%  domestic  lignite  and  80%  imported  sub-bituminous  coal  is  the  optimal \ndesign,  based  on  the  technological,  economic,  and  environmental  analysis.  The  boiler  system \nwith single reheater will perform at no less than 93.5% efficiency at low heating value with this \nblend. The unit will be equipped with a wet scrubber with limestone FGD, which will remove at \nleast  95%  of  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2)  from  exhaust  flue  gases.  A  highly  efficient  (>99.9%) \nelectrostatic  precipitator  will  be  installed  to  remove  fine  particles  from  the  exhaust  gases  and \nminimize the particulates. A low nitrogen oxides (NOx) burner combined with stage combustion \nwill  be  used  and  a  selective  catalytic  reduction  process  will  be  used  to  further  reduce  NOx \nemissions. The project will finance FGDs for existing oil-fired units at Jamshoro TPS to further \nreduce SO2 emissions if necessary to meet environmental standards.36  \n \nThe  project  will  reduce  power  shortage  and  replace  informal  sources  of  power \n19. \ngeneration,  which  is  expected  to  offset  about  503,000  tons  of  the  plant\u2019s  CO2  emissions \nannually.37  Compared with subcritical coal-fired power generation and existing Jamshoro units \nusing  HFO,  the  project  would  emit  388,000  tons  and  639,000  tons  less  CO2  (footnote  5) \nannually.  Reflecting  ADB\u2019s  broad-based  involvement  in  the  sector,  ADB\u2019s  overall  Pakistan \nenergy  portfolio  is  CO2  negative  with  an  expected  reduction  of  3.5  million  tons  from  existing \nprojects  annually.  To  further  reduce  the  carbon  footprint,  the  PIC  will  also  assess  additional \noptions to offset GHG emissions through reforestation. Ash produced from the unit is expected \nto be recycled; however, 100 acres of available land will be purchased for a lined ash disposal \npond to store the ash in case there is a lag in demand from cement plants and other potential \ncustomers.  If  ash  recycling  agreements  cannot  be  signed  by  the  commissioning,  JPCL  will \npurchase  additional  200  acres  of  land  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009) and resettlement plan. Ash Management Plan is detailed in the PAM (footnote 28).  The \ncooling  system  will  need  to  withstand  extreme  hot  summer  weather,  and  the  bidders  will \npropose  optimal  solutions  including  an  air,  wet,  or  hybrid  cooling  system.  The  system  will  be \ndesigned, supplied, and installed by an EPC contractor. Construction will take 40\u201248 months. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\n20. \nThe  project  adopts  a  least-cost  approach  to  enhancing  power  generation  capacity. \nProject  economic  viability  was  assessed  based  on  expected  benefits  and  costs  over  the \nproject\u2019s  economic  life.  The  project  is  economically  viable,  with  an  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  of  36.3%,  exceeding  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%.  Incremental \nrevenues arising from sale of electricity were calculated based on willingness to pay, estimated \n\n                                                \n34 ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n35 The  supercritical  technology  is  well  established  but  is  slightly  less  efficient  than  ultra-supercritical  plants.  Ultra-\nsupercritical  plants  require  experienced  operators  because  of  their  exacting  design.  At  a  low  heating  value,  an \nultra-supercritical plant can reach an efficiency of 45%, a supercritical plant 44%, and subcritical technology 38%. \n36 If the existing units are shut down after commissioning of the new supercritical units, FGD will not be necessary. If \n\nthey are run on high-sulfur HFO or converted to coal-fired units, FGD is required.  \n\n37 Estimated 31% of the electricity generated from the project will replace informal power generation. Ash recycling \nwill result in offsetting 115,000 tons of CO2 emissions. The project\u2019s comprehensive monitoring program for GHG \nemissions will include the installation of a continuous emission monitoring system and third-party monitoring. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nGovernance \n\nat  PRs21  per  kWh  based  on  a  survey. 38  In  the  financial  analysis  the  project  benefit  was \ncalculated as per NEPRA guidelines for coal-fired generation projects. By applying the financing \nterms  and  other  commercial  parameters  of  the  project,39 the  tariff  was  PRs8.88  per  kWh.  The \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  of  the  project  in  real  terms  is  8.7%,  which  compares  favorably \nwith  the  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  6.7%,  indicating  that  the  project  is \nfinancially viable. Sensitivity analysis shows robustness under unfavorable circumstances.  \n \nC. \n \n21. \nProcurement.  The  implementing  agency\u2019s  capacity  to  implement  procurement  of  this \ntype is low, and the inherent procurement risks are high due to the contract value and technical \ncomplexity.  The  PIC  consultant  will  undertake  day-to-day  management  of  the  procurement \nprocess, including ensuring that due diligence is conducted on the proposals, and the findings \nare included in the bid evaluation and recommendations. Based on PIC\u2019s recommendation, the \nproject steering committee will consider (i) evaluation reports and award recommendations, (ii) \nplant  design  and  any  changes  during  implementation,  (iii)  the  implementation  plan,  and  (iv) \ncontract variations. ADB\u2019s concurrence is requested after project steering committee\u2019s approval.  \n \nThe  financial  management  assessment  of  the  implementing  agency  is  generally \n22. \nsatisfactory,  with  accepted  accounting  principles  and  conventions \nin  compliance  with \ninternational  financial  reporting  standards  being  applied.  The  implementing  agency  has  been \naudited by external international audit firms. The company suffers from losses primarily because \nof the sector\u2019s liquidity crisis. The financial rehabilitation roadmap with specific milestones was \ndeveloped  to  improve  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  implementing  agency  (footnote  28). \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with \nthe executing and implementing agencies. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 28). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social  \n\n23. \nThe project will result in a more reliable electric power supply, and help in meeting peak \ndemand,  which  is  expected  to  benefit  industrial  productivity.  Industrial  production  and \nmanufacturing  contribute  about  25%  of  GDP,  and  are  responsible  for  18%  of  formal \nemployment.  Opportunities  for  women\u2019s  employment  in  manufacturing  are  important,  with \nwomen holding 30% of formal jobs in the textile industry. The project will employ 1,600 people \nfor construction and equipment installation. In line with international norms, about 175 staff will \nbe hired for O&M of the new unit.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards  \n\nEnvironment.  This  project  is  categorized  as  \u201cA\u201d  for  environment.  The  project  will  benefit \n24. \nthe environment by addressing the existing environmental damage and restoring the site, and by \nsignificantly  reducing  the  sulfur  emissions  of  power  generated  (per  kWh)  in  comparison  with \nexisting generation using high-sulfur HFO. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009), an environmental audit of the existing facility and environmental impact assessment study \nof the planned two new units were prepared, with the drafts disclosed on 26 June 2013. The new \n                                                \n38 Four consumer categories were surveyed: residential, agricultural, commercial, and industrial. For a 12% economic \n\ninternal rate of return, the willingness to pay would be PRs8.71 per kWh, which is below the average tariff.  \n\n39 A 6% interest rate and 17.45% return on equity was applied. The per-unit price of indigenous coal was assumed to \nbe the same as the per-unit price of imported coal. $120.6 per ton was used. There is no domestic market for the \nquantity of coal needed. \n\n\f9 \n\ncoal-fired unit will produce ash and soot, requiring specific handling (para. 19). Site remediation will \naddress existing contamination issues, such as oil-contaminated soil, waste metals, and asbestos \ndisposal. Mitigation measures supported under this project include (i) effluent water management, \n(ii) construction of a hazardous waste storage facility, (iii) development of a landfill site for colony \nwaste,  (iv)  rehabilitation  of  evaporation  ponds,  (v)  emissions  control  measures  to  address \nexcessive SO2 emissions, and (vi) ash disposal and traffic management. The implementing agency \nwill  implement  an  annual  comprehensive  monitoring  program  to  measure  GHG  emissions  and \neffluent. Training will be held for engineers to mainstream environmental safeguards. The project is \nestimated to emit 3.3 million tons of CO2 annually using an 80/20 blend of imported sub-bituminous \ncoal  and  domestic  lignite.  Background  levels  of  fine  particulate  matter  (less  than  2.5  microns  in \ndiameter [PM2.5]) in the project area exceed the applicable standards.40 The high levels of PM2.5 are \nattributed to informal power generation41 using dirty fuels and less efficient generation,42 and are at \npresent widely used to meet the country\u2019s power shortages. An offset for the plant\u2019s emissions of \nPM2.5 will be designed and implemented, under technical assistance, through further assessment \nof air quality and pollution sources within the airshed.   \n \nSocial.  The  project  is  categorized  as  \u201cB\u201d  for  resettlement  and  \u201cC\u201d  for  indigenous \n25. \npeoples. Approximately 100 acres of land belonging to 18 landowners (with a total of 106 family \nmembers)  is  required  for  an  ash  pond  at  Jamshoro  TPS.  Consultations  were  held  with  the \nowners  and  they  are  willing  to  negotiate  with  JPCL  on  the  price.  A  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement plan was prepared and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 19 September 2013; it will \nbe updated to reflect the final list of owners and price agreed between the owners and JPCL. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n26.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. These and other risks \nare described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.43 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks  \nJamshoro Power Company \nLimited is not paid sufficient \namounts for operations. \nGovernment decides to \nchange to cheaper dirtier \ncoal. \n\nEnvironmental benefits not \nrealized due to \nmismanagement. \n\nLack of cost recovery in the \nenergy and power sectors \ncosts render operations \nunsustainable. \n\nMitigating Measures \nAt  least  1  month  of  fuel  cost  and  1  year  of  maintenance  cost  will  be  kept  in \nseparate escrow accounts by Jamshoro Power Company Limited.    \n\nMedium-term coal supply agreements (minimum 3-year duration) will be signed. \nUse  of  imported  low  sulfur  coal  will  be  a  covenant  in  the  loan  agreement.
