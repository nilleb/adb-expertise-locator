I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $40,200,000 ($28,900,000 to be disbursed in Kazakhstani tenge equivalent\u2014unless the \ncross currency swap market is unavailable, in which case ADB will disburse this amount in US \ndollar\u2014and $11,300,000 to be disbursed in US dollar) to LLP RG Brands Kazakhstan for the \nRG Brands Agribusiness Project in Kazakhstan. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Kazakhstan is an upper middle-income country.From 2000 to 2008, the economy grew \n \nat an average annual growth rate of 9%, one of the highest rates in the world. The share of the \npopulation living below the subsistence line, however, is still at 5% nationwide and 9% in rural \nareas.1The global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009, which interrupted Kazakhstan\u2019s growth, was a \n \nreminder  of  the  need  to  sustain  gains  of  the  past  to  improve  prospects  for  the  future. \nKazakhstan  needs  to  diversify  its  economy  and  reduce  its  dependence  on  oil  and  other \nextractive minerals, which accounted for 22% of gross domestic product (GDP) and 63% of \nexports in 2010. To diversify and transcend its middle-income-country challenge, Kazakhstan \nneeds to increase its productivity and competitiveness.The private sector will ultimately lead the \n \ntransformation  of  the  economy  by  increasing  productivity  and  diversity  via  innovation  and \nentrepreneurship.2 \n \n3.  The  government\u2019s  industrial  development  program  for  2010\u20132016  lists  the  \u2015agro-\nindustrial complex\u2016 as a priority sector for the diversification of the economy and a sector with \nstrong export potential.3 Agriculture has a huge growth potential in Kazakhstan thanks to its vast \nterritory and its proximity to large growth markets (People\u2019s Republic of China, Russia, and \nIndia). Total agricultural land is about 2.1 million square kilometers, of which 89% is pasture \nland and 11% is arable land. Grains, meat, dairy products, and processed food have great \npotential to successfully compete in the global market. Although agriculture contributed only \nabout 5% of GDP, its employment contribution was about 25% of the total working population in \n2010.4  \n \n4.  In December 2011, ADB staff met the top management of the RG Brands group (RG \nBrands)\u2014one of the leading producers of milk, juice, and tea in Kazakhstan\u2014and assessed the \nfinancing needs and strategic fit. RG Brands was found suitable for ADB assistance based on \nits solid operational and financial track record. In 2007, RG Brands received a $50 million loan \nfrom the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) for the construction of a \nproduction site in Aksengir, near Almaty. In February 2012, RG Brands applied for ADB\u2019s \nassistance to fund its capital expenditures over the 2013\u20132015 period (including the expansion \nof milk and juice production facilities and the purchase of coolers and delivery trucks) and to \nrefinance a portion of its debt maturing in the short term. \n                                                \n1  Government  of  Kazakhstan.  Agency  of  Statistics  website:  www.eng.stat.kz  (accessed  on  18  March  2013). \nAccording to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which defines the poverty \nline as 60% of the national median-equalized household income, the poverty rate is 17% nationwide and exceeds \n25% in some rural areas (source: OECD. 2011. Kazakhstan Sector Competitiveness Strategy. Paris.).    \n2  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Kazakhstan, 2012\u20132016. Manila. \n3  Government of Kazakhstan. 2010. State Program of Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development of the \nRepublic of Kazakhstan, 2010\u20132014. Astana. \n4  OECD. 2011. Kazakhstan Sector Competitiveness Strategy. Paris. \n ", "2 \n5.  The project is central to RG Brands' strategy of increasing the local content of its \nproducts, improving production and distribution efficiency, maintaining and expanding direct \naccess to customers, and increasing exports to neighboring countries. The project is also \nconsistent  with  the  objectives  of  the  government\u2019s  industrial  development  program  for  the \nagribusiness industry, which include securing national food independence, increasing added \nvalue by 16%, increasing per capita productivity from $3,000 to $6,000, and increasing the \nshare of agriculture products in the country\u2019s total exports from 3.5% in 2010 to 8.0% by 2015. \n \n2.  Project Design \n6.  The project consists of (i) the expansion of RG Brands\u2019 ultra-high temperature (UHT) \nmilk  and  juice  production  facilities  ($14.9  million),  (ii)  investments  to  boost  efficiency  in \nproduction and distribution ($15.3 million), and (iii) the refinancing of debt maturing in the short \nterm ($10.0 million) to compensate for the lack of long-term debt financing in the market. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s financing will help improve UHT milk production in the Kostanay plant (in the \nnorth of Kazakhstan). The funds will be invested in milk collection systems, particularly in trucks \nthat will collect raw milk from dairy farms and households in different parts of the Kostanay \nregion and deliver it directly to the plant. The investment will also enhance production and \nstorage facilities in Kostanay. Finally, RG Brands will build a similar UHT milk production unit in \nAksengir, within the existing Aksengir production center. \n \n8.  RG Brands sources raw milk from farmers in the Kostanay region. In 2011, the group \nstarted implementing a new system of working with dairy farms by providing long-term contracts \nto dairy farms, which in turn can use these to obtain financing from local banks. RG Brands \nworks with 11 dairy farms and eight villages where small household farmers supply their milk to \nthe plant. As a pilot project, RG Brands invested $500,000 in the Turar Dairy Farm in Kostanay \nto help it purchase milk equipment and provide working capital. As a result, RG Brands secured \na reliable supply of high-quality milk. The farm created 150 new jobs and included new water \ntreatment and a water supply system for the Turar village. ADB financing would help RG Brands \nfurther expand such initiatives. \n \n9.  To help sustain the growth of the juice business, RG Brands plans to invest in the \nimprovement of its juice production facilities in Aksengir (e.g., pasteurization, blending, and \nsyrup preparation), as well as in a new juice production line in Kostanay. About 25% of the \nconcentrates  and  purees  used  by  RG  Brands  are  sourced  from  farmers  in  Kazakhstan, \nsupplying peaches, tomatoes, and apples. RG Brands works closely with two juice concentrate \nfactories from the Almaty region. Additional investment in similar facilities will be required to \nmeet RG Brands\u2019 increasing demand in the coming years while sustaining the level of quality. \nRG Brands\u2019 parent, Resmi Group, is planning to launch an agribusiness private equity fund that \nwould invest in juice concentrate factories and fruit farms, thus helping increase the proportion \nof locally made concentrates used in the production of RG Brands juices. \n \n10.  Given the large territory of Kazakhstan, efficient distribution is critical. RG Brands works \nwith about 40,000 small convenience stores, more than half of which are in rural areas. Usually, \nthese convenience stores are owned and run by families that lack the financial resources to buy \ntheir own equipment, such as coolers and racks for store products like milk and juices. RG \nBrands plans to maintain its annual investment in coolers for these shops. To further increase \ndistribution efficiency, it is launching a new pilot project to finance delivery trucks that will be \nleased to individual entrepreneurs. Finally, RG Brands\u2019 investment plan includes investment in \npower system modernization, required to ensure production efficiency.  \n \n ", "3 \n11.  RG Brands has about $60 million of debt maturing in 2013 and 2014, out of its total debt \nof about $75 million as of December 2012. To extend the maturity profile of this debt, it is \nseeking long-term funding from ADB to refinance $10 million of bonds and loans maturing in \n2013 and 2014. The extension of its debt maturity profile will enable RG Brands to increase its \nannual investment levels and ensure continuous growth. \n \n3.  The Borrower \n12.  RG Brands, established in 1994, is one of the leading producers of milk, juice, tea, and \nother food and beverage products in Kazakhstan. With leading brands and dominant market \nshares in key market segments, a modern production base and world-class management team, \nRG Brands is focused on becoming the largest and most efficient food and beverage group in \nCentral Asia by 2017. In 2012, its total assets reached $194 million; total revenues were \n$245 million; earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) amounted \nto $36 million; and net profit was $27 million. The group is targeting revenues of more than \n$600 million and an EBITDA margin greater than 15% by 2017. \n \n13.  RG Brands has two main production centers: Kostanay and Aksengir. The Kostanay \nplant, which RG Brands acquired from Nestl\u00e9 in 2004 for a total consideration of $2.3 million, is \nits only milk production facility. The Kostanay region is known as an agricultural center of \nKazakhstan thanks to its favorable climate and availability of agricultural land. In 2007, RG \nBrands, along with EBRD and Kazakhstan Development Bank, invested $75 million in the \nconstruction of a modern production facility in Aksengir to consolidate the production processes \nin the Almaty region into a single site.  \n \n14.  RG  Brands  has  its  own  extensive,  nationwide  sales  and  distribution  platform.  Its \n10 regional sales offices are located in the largest cities of Kazakhstan and account for about \n75% of total sales. RG Brands also works with eight third-party distributors, each operating \nexclusively in a dedicated region, which account for 25% of total sales. RG Brands holds the top \nthree  market  positions  in  all  segments  of  operations:  UHT  milk  (23.0%),  juices  (15.3%), \npackaged tea (8.2%), carbonated soft drinks (14.8%), and ice tea (14.0%). Its exports (mainly to \nthe Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) reached 10.5% of its gross \nsales in 2012. RG Brands plans to triple its exports by 2017.  \n \n15.  RG  Brands\u2019  founder  and  major  shareholder  is  a  well-known  businessman,  Kairat \nMazhibayev, who owns the business through Resmi Group, an investment holding company \nthat is also engaged in real estate, retail, and asset management. Resmi Group successfully \ninvested in and exited several businesses. \n \n16.  RG Brands directly employs about 1,600 staff, who each receive benefits in compliance \nwith local labor law (e.g., RG Brands pays 10% of the gross monthly salary directly to a pension \nfund of the employee's choice). In addition, about 1,500 households indirectly depend on the \nRG Brands business for their livelihood (e.g., milk farmers, juice concentrate factory workers, \nand fruit farmers). \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Output \n1.  Impacts \n17.  The project will contribute to (i) sustained contribution of the agriculture sector to GDP, \n(ii) increased exports of agriculture and food products, and (iii) private sector development. The \n ", "4 \nagriculture sector\u2019s contribution to GDP is expected to remain above 5% from 2012 to 2019.5 \nThe share of agriculture and food products in total exports is expected to increase from 3.5% in \n2010 to 8.0% by 2019, in line with the objective of the government\u2019s industrial development \nprogram.6 The project is expected to have a demonstration effect, inducing commercial banks to \nlend  more  to  private  companies  involved  in  the  sector.  Nonsovereign  loans  granted  by \ncommercial banks to agribusinesses is expected to increase from T300 billion in 2012 to at least \nT800 billion by 2020, in line with the government\u2019s plan of a cumulative T2 trillion increase in \nnonsovereign loans to agribusinesses over the 2013\u20132020 period.7 \n \n18.  The project will also strengthen national food security and food safety. It is expected to \nhelp  increase  the  consumption  of  safe  and  nutritious  beverage.8 Specifically,  per  capita \nconsumption of UHT milk is expected to increase from 12 liters per annum in 2011 to 17 liters in \n2017 and per capita consumption of juices from 12 liters per annum in 2011 to 20 liters in 2017.  \n \n2.  Outcome \n19.  The project\u2019s expected outcome will be the efficient production and distribution of quality \nfood products, with greater inputs from local farmers. Production of UHT milk is expected to \nincrease from 25 million liters per annum in 2011 to at least 50 million liters in 2017. Production \nof juices is expected to increase from 60 million liters per annum in 2011 to at least 120 million \nliters in 2017. The average time to deliver products to retailers is expected to decrease from 2 to \n3 days to 1 day. Raw milk sourced locally is expected to increase from about 20 million liters per \nannum in 2011 to at least 45 million liters in 2017. Juice concentrate sourced locally should \nincrease from 0.5 million kilograms per annum in 2011 to 2.0 million kilograms in 2017. \n \n3.  Output \n20.  The output of the project is the successful completion of the investment plan by 2015. \nThe investment plan compromises the expansion of the UHT milk and juice production facilities \nin Aksengir and Kostanay, investments to boost distribution efficiency (coolers and juice racks to \nbe  installed  at  small  convenient  stores,  and  delivery  trucks  to  be  leased  to  individual \nentrepreneurs), and investments to boost production efficiency. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n21.  The project is consistent with Strategy 2020. Supporting agriculture and rural areas is an \n\u2015underlying component of the inclusive growth strategy\u2016 because \u2015the majority of the poor still \nlive in rural areas, and agriculture remains a source of productivity improvement, seasonal \nemployment, and income growth\u2014especially when connected to urban, industrial, and export \nmarkets.\u2016 By connecting agricultural production to food processing and export markets, the \nproject will contribute to economic growth and the reduction of rural poverty in Kazakhstan. The \nproject  is  also  consistent  with  Strategy  2020\u2019s  objective  of  scaling  up  private  sector \ndevelopment and private sector operations in all operational areas.9 \n                                                \n5  Economist Intelligence Unit. 2012. Country Forecast\u2013Kazakhstan. London. \n6  Footnote 3. \n7  Government of Kazakhstan. 2012. Agribusiness 2020 (2013\u20132020). Astana. \n8  Fruit juices are a good source of vitamin C and fiber. UHT milk is safer than fresh milk, as bacterial spores are \nkilled in the heating process, but has the same nutritional value (calcium and vitamins A, B, and D). UHT milk is \neasier to transport, allowing for a wider distribution to regions with low raw milk production. It has a long shelf life of \n6\u20139 months, which means that it can be stored for winter, when milk production is very low.  \n9  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020. Manila. \n ", "5 \n22.  Under ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 for Kazakhstan, agribusiness is \none of the sectors to be supported by ADB\u2019s private sector operations. The strategy recognizes \nKazakhstan\u2019s strong prospects in agriculture, stemming from its vast arable land area. The \nproject is consistent with two of the main drivers of the strategy\u2014private sector development \nand greater regional integration\u2014since it will support exports of high-quality food products from \nKazakhstan to neighboring Central Asian countries. Through its demonstration effect on local \nbanks, the project will also contribute to the strategy outcome indicator targeting an increase in \noverall bank loans as a proportion of GDP from 39% in 2011 to 50% in 2016.10 \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n23.  The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  agriculture  sector  strategy.  In  particular,  the \nOperational Plan for Sustainable Food Security (2009) recommends an \u2015expanded partnership \nwith the private sector\u2016 in order to attract \u2015more direct investments in productivity enhancement, \nagro-processing,  agro-retailing  and  other  nonfarm  rural  business.\u2016  Assistance  to  a  food \nprocessor also incorporates the operational plan\u2019s objective of \u2015increasing synergy and value \naddition in the backward and forward linkages along the food and agriculture value chain.\u2016 \nStronger links along the value chain boost productivity, jobs, exports and regional trade, as well \nas food security for the poor in both rural and urban areas.11  \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n24.  The project, including the proposed refinancing of existing debt, is estimated to cost \naround T6.0 billion, or $40.2 million, over 2013\u20132015. Given its current asset base ($194 million \nas of December 2012) and its low leverage ratios (debt\u2013equity of 0.8 times and debt\u2013EBITDA of \n1.9 times as of December 2012), RG Brands intends to finance the project solely with long-term \ncorporate debt from ADB. \n \nTable 1: Project Cost \nAmount  Amount  Share \nProject Description \n(T million)  ($ million)  (%) \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n25.  Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  The  project  will  operate  under  the  general  regulatory  framework  applicable  to \nmanufacturing  companies  in  Kazakhstan.  The  project  does  not  operate  under a \nconcession agreement and its tariffs are not regulated. \nManagement  RG Brands is led by a team of expatriates and locally experienced managers, with \nextensive experience in leading international food and beverage companies. \nImplementation period  Equipment chosen for ADB financing will be purchased and installed in 2013\u20132015. \nConstruction  The  equipment  required  for  the  project  will  be  procured  from  international \nmanufacturers that will be selected based on competitive bidding. For the milk and \narrangements  \njuice processing lines, RG Brands works with world-renowned equipment suppliers \nsuch as Krones, Sidel, Tetra Pak, and Van Der Molen. \nOperations arrangements  The project will rely on RG Brands for its successful operation. RG Brands has \nrelevant and extensive experience in milk and juice production. Under already existing \nsupply arrangements, raw milk is sourced from local farmers and an increasing \nproportion of juice concentrate is sourced from local producers. The project will also \nbenefit from RG Brands\u2019 sales and distribution platform and marketing expertise. \nPerformance monitoring  RG Brands will report on key performance indicators, including output and outcome \nindicators. \nSource: RG Brands.  \n \nF.  Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n26.   RG Brands\u2019 return on invested capital is expected to increase from 19.0% in 2012 to \nabove 22.5% from 2016 onward. The company is financially viable because the return on \ninvested capital is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 11.8%. The company is \nalso economically sustainable, as the economic return on invested capital is 24.7%, higher than \nthe social discount rate of 12%. \n \nG.  Unique Features \n27.  The project promotes inclusive agricultural value chain development in innovative ways. \nRG Brands will enter into long-term procurement contracts with local dairy farmers and will \nprovide critical equipment to small retailers, enabling them to participate in the high-quality \nbeverage value chain. This project will be ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign agribusiness project in \nCentral and West Asia. This is also the first direct nonsovereign assistance in Kazakhstan (as \nopposed to assistance through a financial intermediary). \n \n ", "7 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n28.   The proposed assistance is a senior loan of up to $40.2 million to LLP RG Brands \nKazakhstan. The loan will comprise two tranches: (i) tranche A in the amount of $30.2 million for \nthe purpose of financing the borrower\u2019s capital expenditures, and (ii) tranche B in the amount of \n$10.0 million for the purpose of refinancing the borrower\u2019s debt. \n  \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n29.   ADB  will  support  a  \u2015national  champion\u2016  in  a  strategic  industry  for  Kazakhstan. \nAgribusiness is not only increasingly contributing to GDP and export growth, it is also a labor-\nintensive sector that will continue to create jobs. The ADB loan will help RG Brands finance \nlong-life productive assets and reduce its exposure to debt maturing in the short term, freeing it \nto reinvest more annual earnings in annual capital expenditures to support its growth. RG \nBrands\u2019 suppliers will also expand their businesses in response to the company\u2019s growth, which \nin turn will generate indirect employment. \n \n30.   ADB will add value by providing long-tenor financing, which is not readily available for \nprivate sector companies in Kazakhstan. Accessing long-term debt has become a challenge for \ncompanies of the size of RG Brands since the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis. Only the government \nand large conglomerates are now able to raise bonds, as pension funds (the main bond buyers) \nare  subject  to  new  prudential  norms.  The  commercial  bank  market  has  become  almost \nexclusively short term, since the proportion of short-term funds on banks\u2019 balance sheets has \nalso increased as a reaction to the crisis, which caused several Kazakh banks to default on their \nlong-term obligations. Nonetheless, well-run medium-sized private sector companies like RG \nBrands still need long-term funding to support their growth. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory B for environment and category C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples. A corporate and compliance audit conducted on RG Brands\u2019 environmental and social \nmanagement system (ESMS) and existing facilities showed that the company\u2019s systems on \noccupational health and safety and food safety are satisfactory. However, waste management \nand pollution control need to be improved. A corrective action plan has been prepared, which \nthe company has committed to implement and which will be incorporated in the company's \nrevised  ESMS.  An  initial  environmental  examination  and  corresponding  environmental \nmanagement  plan  have  been  prepared for the  proposed  investment plan.  RG  Brands  will \nensure that the potential environmental and social impacts of the overall project are recognized, \nand that effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard plans. RG Brands has committed to step up its \ninstitutional capability to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts, adopt an \nESMS agreed on with ADB before the first disbursement, and submit annual monitoring reports. \nInformation disclosure and consultations with affected people are conducted in accordance with \nADB requirements. \n \n32.   ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions \nrequiring RG Brands to comply with national labor laws and the internationally recognized core \n ", "8 \nlabor standards for the ADB-financed portion of the project, in compliance with ADB\u2019s Social \nProtection Strategy.12  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy and Anti-Money Laundering Policies \n33.  RG Brands was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption policy (1998, as amended to date), and \npolicy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to governance, accountability and transparency, ADB requires \nthat RG Brands institute, maintain and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  and  money \nlaundering activities and the financing of terrorism and to covenant with ADB to refrain from \nengaging in such activities. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations  \n34.  The proposed loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n35.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of Kazakhstan\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance to RG Brands will be \nobtained. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory \nto ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan of up to $40,200,000 ($28,900,000 to be disbursed in Kazakhstani tenge \nequivalent\u2014unless the cross currency swap market is unavailable, in which case ADB will \ndisburse this amount in US dollar\u2014and $11,300,000 to be disbursed in US dollar) to LLP RG \nBrands Kazakhstan for the RG Brands Agribusiness Project in Kazakhstan from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \nBindu N.
