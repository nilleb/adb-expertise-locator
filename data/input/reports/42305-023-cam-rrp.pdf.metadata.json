The  10-year \nthe \nstrategy  was  recently  updated  as \nrecommendations  of  the  Financial  Sector  Assessment  Program  (FSAP),  2010  of  the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  and  the  World  Bank.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nmeets regularly with all development partners in the finance sector to discuss current issues and \ncoordinate  activities.  Development  partner  coordination  was  further  strengthened  during  the \nupdate of the FSDS. As per the Government of Cambodia\u2019s request, the proposed policy-based \nloan for subprogram 2 is part of three subprograms to implement the first phase of the FSDS, \n2011\u20132020.  These  reforms  have  been  discussed  with  all  relevant  government  agencies, \nindustry associations, and development partners. \n \n\nthe  FSDS,  2011\u20132020. 2 It  has \n\nfinance  sector \n\nis  based  on \n\nincorporated \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  export-led  garment  and footwear  industries  are  still  the  main  engines  of  economic \ngrowth in Cambodia, despite the government's efforts to diversify the economic base, including \nthe  services,  agriculture,  and  manufacturing  sectors.  The  recent  uncertainty  around  the \neconomic  outlook  for  the  European  Union  and  the  United  States\u2014Cambodia\u2019s  major  export \nmarkets\u2014has  softened  the  demand  for  these  items.  Expected  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \ngrowth has fallen to 6.5%  in  2012  and  6.7%  in 2013. The  impact  of  slower  growth in garment \nand  footwear  exports  should  be  largely  offset  by  higher  than  expected  growth  in  the  services \nsector,  supported  by  a  strong  increase  in  value  of  approved  construction  projects.  Approved \ninvestment  in  construction  activities  went  up  by  almost  85%  in  the  first  7  months  of  2012  to \n$1.38 billion,  from  $747  million  during  the  same  period  of  2011.  Together  with  foreign  direct \ninvestment in property development, a 27% increase in bank credit to construction activities to \n$349.3  million  by  the  end  of  June  2012  also  helped  compensate  for  reduced  exports.  Overall \ngrowth  in  bank  credit  was  about  31%  in  June  2012.  The  presence  of  a  robust  finance  sector \nwhich  supports  efficient  resource  mobilization  for  a  broad-based  economy  is  essential  for \nsustainable development. \n \n4. \nThe  FSDS,  2011\u20132020  is  aligned  with  Cambodia\u2019s  updated  National  Strategy  and \nDevelopment  Plan  (NSDP),  2009\u20132013,  and  Rectangular  Strategy  on  Growth,  Employment, \nEquity, and Efficiency, as well as with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Cambodia, 2011\u2013\n2013. 3  The  government  launched  the  NSDP,  2009\u20132013  update  in  mid-2010,  with  the \noverarching objective of reducing poverty to 19.5% by 2015. The policy priorities of  the NSDP \nupdate intersect closely with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, especially in the core areas of infrastructure, \n\n                                                \n1   ADB.  2011.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\neducation,  and  finance.4 The  government  seeks  a  new  development  paradigm  to  respond  to \nchanges  in the  global  economy,  strengthen  resilience  to  external  shocks,  and  achieve  higher-\nquality growth. \n \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Cambodia, 2011\u20132013 has identified the finance \n5. \nsector  as  one  of  the  five  priority  sectors  (footnote  3).  The  finance  sector  assessment  in  the \nstrategy  also  identified  the  lack  of  public  confidence  in  the  overall  financial  system  as  a \nbottleneck  to  further  finance  sector  development  in  Cambodia.  The  following  have  been \nidentified  as  challenges:  (i)  potential  systemic  risk  (weak  financial  structure  meaning  highly \ndollarized economy, concentration of activities in few banks, and asset exposure for vulnerable \nsector including real estate), (ii) high information costs (with limited transparency and availability \nin  terms  of  financial  statements  and  credit  information),  (iii) moderate  to  high  operating  costs \n(rural  and  informal  nature  of  the  economy),  and  (iv)  weak  human  and  technical  capacity \n(scarcity  of qualified  staff for  regulator  and  industry).  As  a result,  access  to finance  to  support \nthe  country\u2019s  growing  economy  has  remained  well  below  potential.  Although  the  data  in  the \nsector assessment has been updated, the assessment remains relevant. \n \n6. \nIn designing the program, the following past lessons have been incorporated: (i) a set of \nlong-term  objectives  is  required  to  guide  and  shape  medium-term  policy  design  and \nimplementation;  (ii)  flexibility  in  design  is  important  to  accommodate  changes  in  economic, \nsocial,  and  political  circumstances;  (iii)  the  time  lag  between  adoption  of  reforms  and  their \neffective  enforcement  needs  to  be  shortened;  (iv)  substantial  technical  assistance  (TA) \nresources are required to build technical capacity. In addition, through the updating process of \nthe  FSDS,  2011\u20132020,  the  importance  of  early  establishment  of  the  government  coordinating \nbody covering consultation and translation was recognized as a lesson for future updates. This \nis  important  in  maintaining  the  major  concepts  between  the  English  version  and  Khmer  (local \nlanguage) version of the FSDS, 2011-2020. \n \nADB has supported government reform efforts in the finance sector with the approval of \n7. \nthe first financial sector program for Cambodia.5 ADB\u2019s contributions are duly recognized in the \nfollowing  areas:  (i)  modernizing  the  national  payment,  clearance,  and  settlement  system;  \n(ii)  improving  access  to  domestic  deposits  and  credit  for  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs);  \n(iii) strengthening bank and MFI regulations and supervision; (iv) introducing higher standards of \naccounting, auditing, and financial reporting for financial institutions; (v) setting up a registry that \nrecords the assets that banks take as security for loans; (vi) drafting and passing the securities \nlaw;  (vii)  setting  up  a  financial  intelligence  unit  in  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC)  to \ncounter money laundering and prevent the financing of terrorism; (viii) setting up the Securities \nExchange  Commission  of  Cambodia  (SECC)  and  the  stock  exchange;  and  (ix) launching  a \ncredit information bureau covering the banking industry and MFIs. \n \nBased on successful implementation of the programs with effective and flexible ways of \n8. \nconverting  complex  policy  objectives  into  implementable  policy  actions,  the  government \nrequested continuing ADB support to the finance sector, which led to the design and approval of \nthe  third  program.  Subprogram  1  for  $15  million  was  approved  in  November  2011  and  fully \ndisbursed  in  March  2012.  Implementation  of  subprogram  2,  estimated  at  $15  million, \ncommenced  in  December  2011.  Subprogram  2  was  successfully  completed  and  significant \n\n                                                \n4   ADB.  2008.

The  outcome  will  be  a growing,  resilient,  and  efficient  financial  system. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nThe program comprises a series of three single-tranche subprograms to be implemented \nfrom  December  2010  to  December  2013.  Subprogram  2  originally  had  22  policy  triggers  and \n10 milestones.  With  changing  domestic  circumstances  and  development  priorities, \nthe \ngovernment  requested  minor  modifications  to  three  policy  triggers  and  three  milestones.  An \nalternative  approach  has  been  proposed  for  two  policy  triggers  and  deferral  of  two  policy \ntriggers to subprogram 3 (Appendix 4). The impact of proposed changes is within the medium-\nterm  program  framework  and  will  not  have  any  adverse  implications  for  the  program  outcome \nand  outputs.  The  program  has  four  outputs:  (i)  improved  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional \nframework,  (ii)  improved  financial  infrastructure,  (iii)  strengthened  finance  sector  governance, \nand  (iv)  enhanced  finance  sector  efficiency.  Key  activities  for  each  output  are  described  in \nparas.11\u201324. \n \n \n \n11. \nUpdate and enhance the legal foundation for banks and microfinance institutions. \nUnder  the  Second  Financial  Sector  Program,6  the  NBC  strengthened  prudential  supervision, \nupdated regulations, and ensured the stability of the banking system. A comprehensive review \non the Law on Banking and Financial Institutions, 1999 (LBFI) conducted with ADB TA support \nunder the second program addressed the issues relating to consumer protection, bank secrecy \nprovisions  to  support  the  development  of  a  credit  information-sharing  system,  administrative \nprocedures for insolvent or distressed banks, and protection or immunity of bank regulators. In \n2010,  the  FSAP  proposed  specific  areas  to  be  amended  in  the  Law  on  the  Organization  and \nConduct of the NBC and the LBFI. Although a draft revised LBFI reflecting the issues identified \nwas  submitted  to  the  Council  of  Ministers  (COM),  the  NBC  decided  to  incorporate  the  inputs \nfrom the FSAP. With NBC oversight, legal experts fielded under support from First Initiatives (a \ntrust  fund  administered  by  the World  Bank)  will  undertake  the  consultation  process  with  other \nconcerned  government  agencies  where  additional  changes  may  be  identified,  and  the  NBC \nplans  to  submit  the  revised  laws  to  the  COM  during  subprogram  3.  Under  subprogram  2, \nsupport for initial assessment of the two laws was provided because of the delay in fielding legal \nexperts from the World Bank. \n \n12. \nStrengthen  bank  supervision  capacity  and  adopt  measures  to  sustain  financial \nstability.  The  memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  between  the  NBC,  the  Ministry  of \nEconomy and Finance (MEF), and the SECC is part of the 2010 FSAP recommendations and it \nwas considered  crucial  because  of  Cambodia\u2019s  highly  dollarized  economy.  Under  subprogram \n2,  dialogue  on  the  MOU  which  establishes  procedures  for  practical  information  exchange, \n\nImproved Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Framework \n\n1.  \n\n                                                \n6  ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Program Loan and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Second  Financial  Sector  Program  Cluster \n(Subprogram 1). Manila (Loan 2378-CAM and TA 4999-CAM).  \n\n  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\ncoordination  and  accountability  among  domestic  supervisors  for  financial  crisis  was  initiated. \nBecause of slow progress, the IMF Article IV mission in September 2012 proposed a two-phase \napproach, starting with work on the MOU for information sharing. In due course, a second MOU \nwill  be  signed,  which  sets  out  a  time-bound  process  for  instituting  a  comprehensive  crisis \nmanagement  framework.  The  NBC  has  (i)  issued  instructions  to  banks  that  are  performing \nadditional  non-bank-related  activities  to  provide  consolidated  financial  statements,  (ii)  signed \nbilateral  agreements  covering  supervision  cooperation  with  countries  that  have  banks  with \nsubsidiaries licensed in Cambodia, and (iii) issued regulations to cover some of the Basel I core \nprinciples.  The  NBC  also  produced  audiovisual  materials  to  promote  wider  use  of  the  riel  and \nwill  continue  this  effort  under  subprogram  3,  as  well  as  the  work  on  updating  the  corporate \nprofile of each licensed bank. \n \nStrengthen  prudential  supervision  and  regulations  of  microfinance  institutions. \n13. \nThe NBC has achieved significant progress in terms of a regulatory framework for licensing and \nsupervising  MFIs.  The  Economist  Intelligence  Unit  report  on  microfinance  in  20107  ranked \nCambodia  first  in  the  category  of  regulatory  framework  together  with  Pakistan  and  the \nPhilippines. Based on the fully implemented microfinance information system for improving the \nquality  of  off-site  supervision  under  subprogram  1,  the  NBC  also  reorganized  the  supervision \ndirectorate into four departments in 2011, which helped improve its interactions with banks and \nMFIs.  The  NBC  worked  on  improvement  of  the  onsite  supervision  methodology  under \nsubprogram  2,  including  reporting  arrangements  based  on  the  new  organization  and  new \napproaches that contribute to improved supervision. Capacity development continued and NBC \nmanagement  provided  10  additional  staff  positions  (against  the  current  total  of  80  staff \nmembers) before the end of 2012 for supervision of financial institutions. Under subprogram 3, \nthe  NBC  will  conduct  an  assessment  of  compliance  with  the  Microfinance  Activities  and  the \nCore Principles for Effective Banking Supervision.8 \n \n14. \nEnhance  legal  foundation  to  support  financial  and  commercial  transactions.  A \nstrong legal foundation to support Cambodia\u2019s financial and commercial activities is essential for \nsound economic development. A review of potential conflicts between the Civil Code supported \nby  Ministry  of  Justice  and  other  commercial  related  laws  by  other  government  agencies  was \nconducted  under  subprogram  1.  Subprogram  2  supported  upgrade  of  the  financial  legal \ninfrastructure,  including  the  proposed  law  for  a  commercial  court,  adoption  of  a  consumer \nprotection  policy,  drafting  of  a  consumer  protection  law,  and  drafting  of  a  comprehensive \nfinancial  trust  law.  The  council  of  jurists  at  the  COM  decided  that,  rather  than  establish  one \ncentralized  commercial  court,  each  existing  civil  court  will  have  its  own  chamber-specific \njurisdiction  of  commerce.  The  MEF\u2019s  priority  is  to  (i)  introduce  the  legal  framework  covering \npublic trust, first by inserting provisions covering public trust arrangements in the 2013 Budget \nLaw;  and  (ii)  draft  a  subdecree  for  its  implementation.  The  consultation  process  to  develop  a \ncomprehensive financial trust law will continue with TA support from ADB under subprogram 3. \nThe  consultation  process  and  the  review  of  draft  laws  with  the  COM  took  much  longer  than \nanticipated  and  therefore  caused  the  delay.  Under  subprogram  3,  both  a  draft  consumer \nprotection law and a draft financial trust law will be submitted to the  COM, as well as the new \nLaw on Insurance to the National Assembly, which is proposed to be deferred from subprogram \n2 because of the provisions on compulsory motor vehicle cover. \n \n \n\n                                                \n7  Economist Intelligence Unit.  2010.

The process \nfor modernizing the national payments, clearance, and settlement system started in 2006 when \nthe NBC established the payments policy unit. With TA support from ADB,9 the NBC developed \na plan to modernize the system. Under subprogram 2, the NBC has been working on upgrading \nthe  interim  solution,  developed  by  the  NBC  Information  Technology  Division  in  2009,  to  a \ncentralized  full-solution software  system for clearance and  settlement  of payment  instruments. \nThe hardware has been procured and installed, and software development completed the final \nstage of full system tests before the market rehearsal with participating banks. The full-solution \nphase was commissioned in December 2012. Part of the restructuring of the NBC in 2011 was \nthe upgrade of the payments policy unit to the Payments System Division, and the Information \nTechnology Division to a department. The procurement arrangement for the shared switch will \ncommence after the full solution is in operation, although the funding has been committed by the \nMEF.  The  consultation  process  to  review  the  draft  e-commerce  law  is  ongoing  and  will  be \nsubmitted to the COM under subprogram 3. \n \n16. \nto  credit,  consumer  protection,  and  market \nconfidence. Under the initiative of the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Program,10 a \npilot  online  credit  information  system  offering  negative  data  was  developed  in  2006  with \ncooperation  between  the  NBC  and  the  Association  of  Banks  in  Cambodia.  The  initiative  was \ntaken  over  by  the  Second  Financial  Sector  Program  and  the  plan  to  upgrade  the  system  to \ninclude credit data covering both banks and MFIs has been implemented. Under subprogram 1, \na privately owned credit information bureau\u2014the Credit Bureau Cambodia\u2014was established in \n2011 as a joint venture involving the Association of Banks in Cambodia, Cambodia microfinance \nassociation,  and  an  international  service  provider.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  Credit  Bureau \nCambodia  commenced  operation  in  March  2012.  Both  the  banking  industry  and  MFIs  have \ngiven  positive  feedback  on  the  benefits  of  online  credit  data  of  loan  applicants.  Under \nsubprogram  3,  the  NBC  will  work  on  improving  the  operation  of  Credit  Bureau  Cambodia  in \nterms  of  governance,  including  confidentiality  of  data  and  fee  structures  to  support  financial \nsustainability. \n \nDevelop  interbank  market  and  government  securities  markets.  Under  subprogram \n17. \n1, the NBC introduced the negotiable certificate of deposit that can be used as collateral for an \ninterbank  market.  Under  subprogram  2,  in  cooperation  with  the  NBC  the  MEF  has  completed \nthe study on (i) developing capacity; (ii) considering the timing for issuance of Treasury bills in \nriel based on a predetermined borrowing program; and (iii) establishing a system for accrediting \nprimary market dealers of government securities. Under subprogram 3, the MEF and NBC will \ndevelop market procedures on the Treasury bills. \n \nDevelop domestic securities market.    The development of capital markets for equity \n18. \nsecurities will improve domestic resource mobilization and help domestic firms to directly access \nfunds for business development. The legal framework for capital markets was developed under \nthe  Second  Financial  Sector  Program  and,  under  subprogram  1,  the  SECC  issued  the \nimplementing  regulations  and  officially  launched  the  Cambodia  Securities  Exchange.  Under \n\n                                                \n9  ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  Preparing  the  Financial  Sector  Development \n\nProgram.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance  Grant  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Development  Program. \nManila. (Loan 2129-CAM). \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fsubprogram  2,  the  SECC  (i)  prepared  a  subdecree  on  bankruptcy  relating  to  market \nparticipants, (ii) formulated a capacity building program for its staff, and  (iii) consulted with the \nNBC  and  MEF  to  undertake  a  self-assessment  on  the  SECC\u2019s  compliance  with  the  core \nprinciples  of  the  International  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions.  In  April  2012,  a  major \nmilestone  in  Cambodia\u2019s  capital  market  development  was  reached  when  trading  at  the \nCambodia  Securities  Exchange  started;  the  first  issue  involved  the  state-owned  Phnom  Penh \nWater  Supply  Authority;  15%  of  the  total  shares  were  offered  to  the  market  and  it  was  fully \nsubscribed.  The  SECC  is  taking  measures  raising  financial  literacy  on  capital  markets  to \nbroaden  the  investor  base  and  promote  investor  protection.  In  addition,  the  SECC  initiated  a \nstudy  for  development  of  a  corporate  bond  market,  with  a  target  of  starting  trading  in  2013\u2013\n2014, while the government bond market is still under consideration. Under subprogram 3, the \nSECC  will  submit  the  draft  subdecree  on  bankruptcy  to  the  COM  and  initiate  an  evaluation  of \nthe  legal  framework  for  new  markets,  including  collective  investment  schemes  and  securities \nborrowing and lending. \n \n19. \nDevelop  insurance  industry.  In  Cambodia,  the  insurance  sector  started  with  the \ngeneral  insurance  business.  Under  the  Second  Financial  Sector  Program  the  MEF  worked  on \ndeveloping  implementing  regulations  on  licensing,  a  tariff  on  premium  rates,  corporate \ngovernance, and solvency. To align with regional and international practices, a draft insurance \nlaw  was  submitted  to  the  COM,  including  provision  for  (i)  compulsory  third-party  liability \nautomobile  insurance  to  address  the  increasing  traffic  accidents,  (ii)  life  insurance,  and  \n(iii)  micro  insurance.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  MEF  issued  life  insurance  licenses  to  two \ncompanies\u2014one  foreign  company  and  one  state-majority-owned  joint  venture.  The  MEF  also \nprepared  a  plan  for  an  insurance  promotion  campaign  to  increase  market  awareness  and  led \nvarious  awareness  workshops.  The  MEF  will  complete  the  actuarial  study  on  life  insurance  to \ndevelop a mortality table during subprogram 3. \n \n \n \n20. \nPromote  international  initiatives  on  anti-money-laundering  and  combating  the \nfinancing of terrorism. Cambodia has gained membership in the Asia Pacific Group on Money \nLaundering  and  is  committed  to  complying  with  the  Financial  Action  Task  Force  (FATF) \nrecommendations,  international  conventions,  and  United  Nations  Security  Council  resolutions. \nCambodia  is  currently  under  the  FATF  International  Co-operation  Review  Group  process  and \nsince  July  2011  has  been  on  a  grey  list  of  jurisdictions  which  have  strategic  anti-money-\nlaundering  and  combating  the  financing  of  terrorism  (AML/CFT)  deficiencies  but  have  given \nhigh-level  political  commitment  to  address  the  shortcomings  through  an  action  plan  with  the \nFATF. Cambodia issued a subdecree on establishment of a national coordination committee on \nAML/CFT in April 2012. Under subprogram 2, a national risk assessment framework and a draft \nnational  AML/CFT  strategy  have  been  prepared  for  committee  approval.  Eight  AML/CFT \nseminars have been conducted in Cambodia during 2012. Under subprogram 3, the Cambodian \nFinancial  Intelligence  Unit  will  adopt  the  national  risk  assessment  framework  and  commence \nimplementation. \n \nEnhance  corporate  governance  and  transparency  in  the  finance  sector.  To  build \n21. \nconsumer confidence in the sector, formal financial institutions have to be more transparent in \nhow  they  conduct  business  and  consistently  implement  good  governance  practices.  Under \nsubprogram  1,  the  SECC  developed  a  framework  for  implementing  a  code  of  corporate \ngovernance practices for listed companies. Under subprogram 2, the NBC required banks and \nMFIs  to  disclose  loan  terms  and  conditions  according  to  a  uniform  framework  that  will  help \ninform and protect clients, as well as addressing a program to align accounting and prudential \n\nStrengthened Finance Sector Governance \n\n3.  \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fto \n\nthe  subdecree \n\nstandards with international financial reporting standards. Further, the SECC introduced a code \nof  corporate  governance  practices  for  listed  companies.  Under  subprogram  3,  the  SECC  will \npromote  use  of  the  code  of  corporate  governance  for  nonlisted  companies  and  conduct  an \neducational  campaign  with  emphasis  on  responsibilities  of  board  directors,  corporate \nsecretaries, and management. \n \n22. \nEstablish  commercial  dispute  resolution  mechanism. The government adopted the \nlaw  on  commercial  arbitration  in  2006  and  a  subdecree  was  issued  in  July  2009.  Following \nestablishment of the legal and regulatory framework, examinations were conducted in 2011 and, \nupon  passing  those  examinations,  qualified  arbitrators  were  registered  as  founding  members. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  made  efforts  to  make  the  national \narbitration  center  operational,  but  revision \nto  allow  private  sector \nrepresentatives  caused  some  delays.  The  first  general  assembly  meeting  of  the  national \narbitration  center  for  election  of  the  first  board  of  directors,  including  representatives  from  the \nprivate sector, was held in January 2013 and directors were duly appointed. Under subprogram \n3,  recruitment  of  and  training  for  new  arbitrators  will  continue,  while  the  business  plan  for  the \nnational arbitration center to ensure its operational and financial sustainability will be finalized. \n \n23. \nImprove accounting and auditing profession. Efforts to increase the national capacity \nfor  accounting  and  auditing  (the  infrastructure  that  supports  economic  development  with \ngovernance) started under the Second Financial Sector Program. The scholarship program for \ncertified  public  accountants  was initially  restricted to government  officials,  but  results  were  not \nencouraging  so  it  was  offered  to  the  public  on  merit.  Since  then,  the  results  have  improved. \nUnder the program, the focus has been redirected to development of an International Financial \nReporting  Standards-based  curriculum  for  universities  to  provide  accounting  degrees  that  are \naffordable  to  the  public  while  maintaining  financial  support  for  ongoing  scholarship  holders. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  MEF  revised  the  Accounting  and  Auditing  Law,  2002  to  reflect \ninternational developments. In addition, the MEF worked on reviewing and updating the chart of \naccounts for public financial management, in line with the International Public Sector Accounting \nStandard,  along  with  upgrading  the  government  accounting  system.  Many  senior  government \nofficials  have  realized  the  importance  of  accounting  standards  for  government  financial \nmanagement  through  the  operation  of  the  upgraded  government  accounting  system.  Under \nsubprogram 3, the MEF will submit the Accounting and Auditing Law to the National Assembly \nwhile continuing the financial support for an International Financial Reporting Standards-based \ncurriculum for universities and the existing scholarship program. \n \n \n \n24.  Modernize  the  business  registration  system.  The  MOC  corporate  registry  system \nneeds to be consolidated and upgraded to improve the national database of corporate entities \nand  make  corporate  information  more  accessible  to  stakeholders  in  the  financial  market \nincluding investors, lenders, and the public. This will reduce the transaction costs and improve \nefficiency.  Following  the  review  of  current  systems  for  improvement  under  subprogram  1, \nsubprogram  2  supported  the  consolidation  of  current  systems.  However,  limited  technical \ncapacity for system development within the MOC and insufficient available MOC budget in 2012 \ncaused a delay in implementation. The MOC requested TA support from ADB in this regard and \nsubmitted  a  full  budget  proposal  that  will  be  reviewed  by  the  MEF  together  with  the  2013 \nbudget. With ADB TA support and the approval of adequate budget funds, this work is expected \nto be deferred but will be completed during subprogram 3. \n \n \n\nEnhanced Finance Sector Efficiency \n\n \n4.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\floan \n\nrequested  a \n\nThe  government  has \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nin  various  currencies  equivalent \n\n \nD. \n \n25. \nA  total  of  $45  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Fund  resources  was  programmed \nfor the Third Financial Sector Program, which will comprise three subprograms. The size of the \nbudget support program is based on (i) development financing needs for the sector as identified \nduring  country  programming  and  strategy  formulation,  (ii)  the  importance  the  government \nattaches to the reform program, and (iii) the estimated costs of designing and implementing the \nmedium-term reform program minus estimated financial support provided by other development \npartners.11 Each successive subprogram will be processed following the successful completion \nof the subprogram preceding it. The loan for subprogram 2 will be disbursed in a single tranche \nupon  satisfactory  completion  of  all  subprogram  triggers  and  following  loan  effectiveness.  The \nproceeds of the loan will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB's Simplification \nof Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.12 \n \n26. \nto  \nSDR9,887,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan will \nhave  a  24-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions \nset  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange cost of items produced and procured in ADB member countries.13 ADB will retain the \nright to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of withdrawal application \ncertification. The closing date of the loan is 31 December 2013, by which date all proceeds of \nthe loan will have been fully disbursed. \n \nE. \n \n27. \nThe  NBC  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  the  MEF,  MOC,  and  SECC  will  be  the \nimplementing agencies. The finance sector steering committee and the technical working group \n(TWG),  as  updated  under  regulation  393  of  21  June  2011,  will  oversee  implementation  of  the \nFSDS, 2011\u20132020 and coordinate with the government ministries and agencies concerned. To \nensure  timely  program  implementation,  the  TWG,  chaired  by  a  senior  official  of  the  MEF  and \ncomprising  senior  officers  of  the  MEF,  MOC,  NBC,  SECC,  and  other  government  agencies \nconcerned, will meet as needed to review progress and consider pending issues. The TWG will \nreport to the steering committee, chaired by the governor of the NBC, and will propose concrete \nactions  to  resolve  any  issues  that  arise.  A  senior  officer  of  the  NBC  has  been  appointed  as \nprogram  director  and  will  assist  ADB  in  coordinating  day-to-day  program  implementation  with \nthe  MEF,  MOC,  NBC,  SECC,  and  other  agencies.  The  program  director  will  be  required  to \nsubmit  quarterly  progress  reports  and  an  annual  report  on  the  progress  of  subprogram \nimplementation  and,  in  particular,  on  progress  in  implementing  policy  actions  adopted  for  the \nprogram. Implementation period of subprogram 2 is from December 2011 to December 2012. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n28. \nThe      program  will  generate  economic    gains    through    successful    implementation    of \nmedium-term policy actions.

Improved financial infrastructure \nwill support further development of access to finance and other financial services. Strengthened \nfinance  sector  governance  will  lead  to  the  improvement  of  quality  of  financial  reporting  and \neffective  AML/CFT  measures.  Enhanced  financial  sector  efficiency  will  reduce  the  information \nand transaction costs related to commercial activities.  \n \nB. \n \n29. \nAn assessment of the country\u2019s public financial management systems was carried out to \nbetter  understand  fiduciary  risks  and  determine  appropriate  fiduciary  arrangements  for \nsubprogram  2.  The  assessment  took  the  sector  work  of  ADB\u2019s  report  on  Cambodia\u2019s  country \ngovernance  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan  into  consideration.14  The  government \ncontinues to emphasize strengthening the public financial management system, internal control \nsystems, and the functions of the National Audit Authority,15 which have mitigated the fiduciary \nrisk  of  the  public  financial  management  system  as  a  whole.16  According  to  the  2010  public \nexpenditure  financial  accountability  (PEFA)  report,  the  report  indicated  mixed  results  but \nimproving performance since the 2002 PEFA report. Due to significant improvement with budget \nformulation,  internal  controls,  treasury  operations  and  cash  management,  accounting  system, \nand internal and external auditing, Cambodia is rated by the 2010 PEFA report to be at par with \nother low-income countries at similar stages of development. Under subprogram 2, efforts have \ncontinued to (i) improve the management information system and reporting standards within the \nNBC, banks, insurance firms, and MFIs; (ii) promote transparency in the information released by \nbanks,  MFIs,  insurance  firms,  and  listed  companies;  (iii)  support  the  operation  of  the  Credit \nBureau of Cambodia; and (iv) strengthen the enforcement of AML/CFT regulations. \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  NBC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  the  government  will  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with \ninternal  procedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practices  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing corruption, money laundering, or the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to \nrefrain from engaging in such activities. \n \nC. \n \n31. \nSubprogram 2 is categorized as a general intervention to support sustainable economic \ngrowth and is  expected to  contribute to  poverty reduction  in  an  indirect manner.17  Further,  the \npromotion of inclusive finance facilitated by finance sector development expands the outreach of \naffordable  formal  financial  services  for  the  poor  and  rural  micro  enterprises  and  so  has  direct \nimpacts  on  poverty  reduction.  While  implementing  finance  sector  reforms  based  on  market \nprinciples has been gender neutral, the results show that improved access to financial services \nhas brought more benefits to women in rural areas. During subprogram 2, the NBC reported that \nlending by MFIs to women increased from 21% of loans in 2002 to 83% in June 2012.

Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  described  in  detail  in \nthe  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.18  The  main  risks  are  external  challenges  to \nsustaining  economic  growth,  weak  governance  and  corruption  in  the  sector,  and  weak \ninstitutional  and  human  capacity.  With  the  design  safeguards,  the  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to far outweigh any costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n34. \nThe  government  and  the  NBC  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan agreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n35. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and acting in the absence of the President, \nunder the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I  recommend that the \nBoard  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR9,887,000  to  the  Kingdom  of \nCambodia for subprogram 2 of the Third Financial Sector Program, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources,  with an  interest  charge  at the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during the grace  period  and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nloan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nBindu N.

As an interim \narrangement, MEF, while committed to lead the \nconsultation process towards the submission of the draft \ncomprehensive trust law to the Council of Ministers (CoM) \nin 2013, proposed to insert the relevant provisions covering \npublic trust into the 2013 budget law that was approved in \nDecember 2012. The legal provisions will empower MEF to \nissue regulations on public trust area as interim measure.  \nThe Mission agreed that the TA support from ADB will \nassist the MEF with the interim arrangements and also \nwork with MEF towards completion of and the submission \nof the comprehensive financial trust law to the CoM in \n2013. \nThe draft insurance law has been with the CoM for more \nthan a year. MEF has made all the efforts to get it through \nthe various Committees of the CoM. It is now with the inter-\nministerial Committee of the CoM before being submitted to \nthe plenary session. The provision covering compulsory \nthird party liability automobile insurance to extend coverage \nfrom commercial motor vehicles to cover non-commercial \nvehicles has been proven very challenging.  Despite the \nprovision of data to support the increased number of road \naccidents and the technical support from ADB TA \nconsultants to help MEF\u2019s briefing that compulsory motor \nvehicle is generally accepted internationally, there appears \nto be more political reluctance because of the public \nconcern due to the general election scheduled for July \n2013.  One of the options offered from those opposing the \ncompulsory provision is for the insurance law to drop the \ncompulsory provision. However, MEF\u2019s view is to retain the \nexpanded compulsory coverage in the proposed law \nbecause of the increased number of traffic accidents and it \nis generally considered as international practice.  MEF is \ncontinuing to put pressure for clearance of the draft law \nwithout any changes by the CoM for submission to the \nNational Assembly between now and the end of 2013. \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\n2\n9\n\n \n\n \n\nxiii.
