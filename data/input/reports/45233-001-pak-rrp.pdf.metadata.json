The project will enable the expansion of the cash \ntransfer program (paid to the female head of targeted poor families) by registering an additional \n2.4  million  eligible  families  and  contributing  to  financing  their  cash  transfers.  In  addition,  it  will \nsupport  the  strengthening  and  phased  expansion  of  the  pilot  health  insurance  and  skills \ndevelopment  programs  to  increase  income  and  good  health  for  targeted  families.  The  project \nwill provide technical support and finance part of the scaling-up costs of both programs using a \nperformance-based  allocation.  The  substantial  fiduciary  risk  of  the  project  will  be  mitigated \nthrough the strengthening of BISP financial management systems and capacity.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  latest  official  estimates  of  poverty  incidence  were  released  in  Pakistan  in \n2005/2006,  with  the  headcount  index  for  poverty  reported  at  22.3%.3 Since  2007,  Pakistan\u2019s \neconomy  has  faced  difficult  challenges,  including  external  and  domestic  economic  shocks, \neconomic  uncertainty,  and  security  problems.  Annual  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth \nrates  post-2007  averaged  about  3%,  while  inflation  averaged  13.8%,  resulting  in  lower  living \nstandards. A recent study, using district-based poverty profiles, estimated poverty incidence for \nall households in the country may have risen up to 33%.4 \n \n4. \nStarting  in  2007,  the  government  significantly  increased  its  spending  on  social \nprotection,  established  a  new  institutional  framework,  and  approved  the  National  Social \nProtection Strategy.5 In October 2008, the government launched the BISP as the national social \nsafety net program. The immediate objective was to decrease the adverse impact of food, fuel, \nand  financial  crises  on  low-income  families.  The  broader  goal  was  to  implement  the \ngovernment\u2019s  redistributive  policy  by  providing  regular  cash  income  support  to  the  poor.  The \nmain BISP intervention is a cash transfer program providing PRs1,000 per month to the female \nhead of the family.6 The government\u2019s social safety net spending increased from 0.3% of GDP \nin FY2004 to 0.9% in FY2011 after introducing the BISP.7  \n \nThe  BISP  uses  a  transparent  and  objective  methodology  to  select  beneficiaries.  It \n5. \nidentified  7.2  million  eligible  poor  families  (23%  of  the  total  population)  on  the  basis  of  a \nnationwide  poverty  scorecard  survey  using  a  proxy-means  test  approach.  Initial  evaluation \nfindings demonstrate that it is a credible targeting system, covering a substantial number of the \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

The \nwoman in the family holds a computerized national identity card (CNIC) or has applied for one. \n7   World Bank. 2012. Pakistan. Towards an Integrated National Safety Net System. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\f2  \n\npoorest  in Pakistan. 8 However,  2.4  million  eligible  poor families  are  not  yet receiving  the  cash \ntransfer  because  the  female  head  does  not  hold  a  CNIC,  which  is  the  key  eligibility  criterion \n(footnote 6). Pending families are the most difficult to reach and likely to be the most destitute.9  \n \nThe  introduction  of  a  national  safety  net  program  and  the  availability  of  the  poverty \n6. \nscorecard database can potentially lead to more efficient use of resources and better targeting \nand  coordination  with  the  provincial  social  safety  net  programs.  A  well-managed  targeting \nsystem  will  enable  the  replacement,  over  time,  of  other  inefficient  social  safety  net  programs \nand untargeted subsidies that are still pervasive in Pakistan. 10 \n \n7. \nThe  BISP  piloted  several  initiatives  to  help  the  poor  graduate  from  poverty,  including \nhealth  insurance,  skills  development  training,  small  business  development  loans,  and  primary \nto  support  human \neducation  co-responsibility  cash \ndevelopment  and  economic  opportunities  for  beneficiaries,  and  reduce  the  likelihood  of \nintergenerational  transfer  of  poverty. The first two  of these graduation  initiatives are  of  special \nrelevance for social protection: \n\ntransfers. 11  These  programs  aim \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nAlmost  70%  of  total  health  expenditures  are  paid  out-of-pocket  by  families, \ndriving about 4% of the population into poverty every year.12 Unexpected severe \nhealth problems are the most prevalent shock for families. In addition to income \nloss  from  being  unable  to  work,  medical  costs  alone  can  push  households  into \npoverty.  Health  insurance  for  the  poor  that  covers  catastrophic  risks  and  major \ncosts  such  as  births  can  provide  significant  financial  relief  and  protection  to  the \nmost vulnerable families, while improving access to health facilities.  \nMore than 53% of the target population depends on casual labor as their major \nsource  of  income\u2014it  is  insecure  and  risky.13 Beneficiary  family  members  have \nextremely \nliteracy  and  numeracy,  affecting  confidence  and  social \nparticipation.  Rural  employment  opportunities  (both  wage  employment  and  self-\nemployment)  could  be  enhanced  through  skills  training.  This  will  improve  poor \nfamilies\u2019 income-generating capacity and boost their resilience to shocks.  \n\nlow \n\n \n8. \nIn April 2012, the BISP launched a health insurance program, Waseela-e-Sehet (WES), \non  a  pilot  basis  to  provide  protection  against  catastrophic  health  expenditure  to  registered \nbeneficiary  families  in  Faisalabad  district  in  Punjab  Province  through  the  State  Life  Insurance \nCorporation. The insurance package covers full hospitalization for all age groups with an annual \nmaximum  benefit  cap  of  PRs25,000  per  family.  It  covers  preexisting  conditions  as  well  as \nhospitalization  for  maternity  and  child  health.  So  far,  37,575  families  have  been  insured  and \nprovided  access  to  WES  registered  private  hospitals  on  a  cashless  and  paperless  basis.  Of \nthese expenditures, 40% were maternity related. \n\n                                                \n8   BISP. 2011. Baseline Survey Report of the Benazir Income Support Program. Islamabad. Of the total number of \neligible households, 73% are below the national poverty line; 27% are between 100% and 125% of the poverty line. \n9   Other  major  achievements  of  the  BISP  are  (i) creation of  the  National  Socio-Economic  Registry  to  manage  data \nsharing of the poverty scorecard survey results using a data-sharing protocol; (ii) application of technology-based \nsolutions for verification and payment to ensure efficiency and transparency; and (iii) establishment of a nationwide \ntechnology-based  network  of  grievance  redressal  offices.  Every  process  is  independently  monitored  and  results \nare evaluated annually. \n\n10  For example, power subsidies were PRs464 billion (2.25% of GDP) in FY2012. The largest share of the subsidy \n\nwent to the richest sections of society, and only PRs4 billion went to lifeline consumers. \n\n11  These \u201cgraduation\u201d programs are not to be understood as following the \u201cgraduation model\u201d being piloted in different \ndeveloping  economies  to  target  the  extreme  poor,  which  follows  a  specific  sequence  of  (i)  nutrition  support,  \n(ii) productive asset transfer (on a grant basis), (iii) skills training and self-confidence building, (iv) financial literacy \ntraining, and (v) credit support (if needed by the targeted family, and if the family has \u201cgraduated\u201d). \n\n12  World Bank. 2010.

Islamabad. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nThe  Waseela-e-Rozgar  (WER)  was  launched  in  July  2011  to  provide  center-based \n9. \nformal skills training to any selected family member of a beneficiary. In FY2013, 56,600 trainees \ngraduated from both public and private training centers providing 4\u20136 month programs out of a \nlist  of  52  pre-selected  professions,  including  welder,  auto  mechanic  and  receptionist.  The \ncurrent  WER  is  very  costly.  The  average  cost  of  PRs53,000  limits  outreach  of  the  program. \nMost  courses are taught  beyond  the  absorptive  capacity  of  BISP  potential  nominees,  who  are \nlargely illiterate or semiliterate. Training delivery  and competency assessment and certification \nhave  fundamental  problems.  While  the  impact  of  current  training  provision  on  employability  is \nlimited, the reputational risks of current training delivery arrangements and weak monitoring are \nhigh. \n \n10. \nUnder  the  18th  Constitutional  Amendment  (30  June  2011),  several  subjects\u2014including \nhealth,  education,  and  social  welfare\u2014became  a  shared  responsibility  of  the  federal \ngovernment  and  the  provinces.  The  federal  government  continues  to  play  a  critical  role  in \nensuring  that  long-term  poverty  reduction  and  social  protection  goals  are  met.  A  centrally \noperated safety net program is better placed to ensure equal chances for the poor to qualify for \nthe  cash  transfer  program,  and  to  coordinate  consistent  program  standards  for  provincial \ngraduation programs. The provinces play a key role to develop and implement complementary \ngraduation programs, especially highly customized graduation interventions (footnote 11). \n \nSeveral development partners are supporting the BISP in the design and implementation \n11. \nof its programs. The World Bank provided a $60 million technical assistance (TA) credit for the \ndevelopment of a transparent targeting and delivery mechanism. The United States Agency for \nInternational  Development  provided  $160  million  of  budget  support  for  the  payment  of  cash \ngrants  to  beneficiaries  identified  using  the  poverty  scorecard  survey.  The  World  Bank  is \nproviding  $150  million  and  the  Department for International  Development (DFID)  of the  United \nKingdom  \u00a3300  million  to  support  expansion  of  the  cash  transfer  program  coverage  to  up  to  \n5.5 million beneficiary families by sharing a small part of the total cost of the cash transfer, and \nthe introduction of a co-responsibility cash transfer program on education. GIZ is providing TA \nfor the health insurance pilot program. \n \n12. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been a BISP partner since its inception. Under \nthe Accelerating Economic Transformation Program (AETP) Subprogram 1, ADB supported the \nlaunching  of  the  BISP  to  mitigate  the  social  impact  of  the  food  and  fuel  crises  of  2007  and \n2008.14 Under  the  AETP  Subprogram  2,  ADB  allocated  $150  million  equivalent  in  counterpart \nfunds for the BISP to provide cash transfers to beneficiaries identified by the poverty scorecard \nsurvey.15 The  Office  of  the  Auditor  General  of  Pakistan  (AGP)  audited  the  FY2012  financial \nstatements for this subprogram and issued a modified audit opinion.16 The BISP contested the \naudit  opinion  and  clarified  the  payment  process  through  partner  banks.17 In  response,  AGP \nindicated that the audit opinion could be revisited in light of any additional information provided \n                                                \n14 ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Program  Cluster \nand  Loans  for  Subprogram  1  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Accelerating  Economic  Transformation \nProgram. Manila. \n\n15  ADB.  2009.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loans  for \nSubprogram 2 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Accelerating Economic Transformation Program. Manila. \n16  The  AGP  audit  opinion  states  that  approximately  16.78%  of  the  counterpart  funds  were  paid  to  ineligible \n\nbeneficiaries who did not possess a CNIC or a valid CNIC. \n\n17  Transfers  to  partner  banks  for  eligible  beneficiaries  include  a  buffer  sum  for  those  who  are  awaiting  CNIC \nregistration. An initial review of the audit report commissioned by ADB confirmed that payments under ADB funding \nwere  made  to  eligible  beneficiaries  in  line  with  the  eligibility  definition  in  the  BISP  Operations  Manual.  As  an \nadditional  mitigating  measure  for  the  project,  ADB  commissioned  an  additional  review  of  the  payments  to \nbeneficiaries  to  provide  further  confirmation  that  ADB  funds  were  released  to  eligible,  registered,  and  verified \nbeneficiaries. This review is currently ongoing. \n\n \n\n\f4  \n\nby  the  BISP.  The  BISP  provided  further  documentation  supporting  the  payments  in  question. \nADB  is  working  closely  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  the  BISP  to  seek  AGP  review  of  the \nadditional  supporting  documentation.  Resolution of this  issue  within a specified timeframe  is a \ncovenant for the proposed loan for the project requiring either the revision of the audit opinion or \nthe repayment of the transfers made to the ineligible beneficiaries by the government to ADB, if \nany.  In addition,  DFID and  the World Bank  are providing  substantial  strengthening  of financial \nmanagement systems under their ongoing  and concurrent projects, and further support will be \nprovided by the project (see paras. 33 and 40). Strengthening of the social safety net system is \nincluded  in  the  ADB  country  partnership  strategy,  as  support  for  the  transition  from  inefficient \nsubsidy  schemes  to  targeted  cash  transfer  programs.18 The  project  is  included  in  the  country \noperations business plan.19 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n The impact of the project will be reduced income and nonincome poverty. The outcome \n\n13. \nwill be increased resilience for BISP female beneficiaries and their families.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n14. \nThe project will support the full expansion of the BISP\u2019s cash transfer program to eligible \nfamilies, and the improvement and expansion of two graduation programs: the health insurance \nprogram and the skills development program. Expansion of the three programs will be rigorously \nmonitored  and  evaluated  at  regular  intervals  to  encourage  improvements  based  on  lessons \nidentified. BISP financial management and control systems will be strengthened. \n \nOutput  1:  Cash  transfer  program  coverage  expanded.  The  output  will  support  the \n15. \nenrollment  of  all  traceable,  female  headed,  eligible  beneficiary  families.  The  provision  of  the \ncash  transfer  through  the  female  head  and  linking  the  benefit  to  possession  of  and \nunderstanding  the  CNIC  empowers  the  role  of  women  in  the  family.  Currently,  approximately \none-third  of  eligible  beneficiaries  do  not  receive  the  cash  transfer  because  registration  is \npending. The case management system and appeals process have been adding an average of \n100,000 eligible beneficiaries per month to the program since September 2012. This rate of new \nenrollments will slow as case management teams work with eligible beneficiaries who are more \ndifficult to locate and enroll. Eligible beneficiaries will be reevaluated and rescored as part of a \nrecertification process by May 2016.  \n \n16. \nThe  project  will  finance  the  first  5  quarters  (at  PRs3,000  per  quarter)  of  the  cash \ntransfers to all newly enrolled beneficiaries.20 The project will mobilize survey teams to sensitize \nand  complete  the  information  on  pending  beneficiaries.  The  National  Database  Registration \nAuthority  will  field  mobile  and  semimobile  teams  to  issue  the  CNICs.  The  BISP  subdistrict \n(tehsil)  offices  will  ensure  clear  beneficiary  understanding  of  their  CNIC  and  BISP  rights  and \nresponsibilities. The  project  will  closely  monitor  the  timely  delivery  of the  cash  transfers to the \nnew  beneficiaries,  using  regular  spot  checks.  The  payment  release  for  cash  transfers  will \ndepend on the results of the spot checks and other financial and performance monitoring. \n \nOutput 2: Health insurance program refined and rolled out. This output will support \n17. \nthe  strengthening  and  expansion  of  the  WES  health  insurance  program  in  a  phased  manner. \nBISP beneficiaries in pilot districts will receive health insurance protection against catastrophic \n                                                \n18  ADB. 2009.

The medium-term expansion is divided into two phases. In the first phase, the WES will \nbe  expanded  to  5  more  districts,  and  information  will  be  gathered  on  the  actual  cost  of  the \ninsurance  package  as  utilization  increases.  A  more  detailed,  preparatory  design  will  be \ncompleted by mid-2014 and the expansion will be launched to 10 more districts by late 2016. A \npotential  third  phase  may  be  prepared  at  the  end  of  the  project,  based  on  the  findings  of  the \nmonitoring and evaluation reports and other related studies. \n \n19. \nThe project will provide technical support under an ADB, GIZ and WES common detailed \nimplementation  plan.  The  project  will  finance  the  development  and  implementation  of  a \nmonitoring and evaluation system for stakeholders through a web-based information technology \nplatform.  The  platform  will  interface  with  the  National  Database  Registration  Authority\u2019s  CNIC \ndatabase and allow insurers to track claims, investigate suspicious claims, and transfer funds to \nproviders. The project will support capacity building for the WES and its partners, and help raise \nawareness  in  the  expansion  districts  through  communication  campaigns  and  a  call  center  to \nmanage  complaints  and  contact  beneficiaries  after  discharge.  The  project  will  provide  cash \npayment to beneficiaries for transport upon discharge from hospital. The project will support an \nimpact evaluation near the end of each phase. Based on the findings of the midterm review, the \nproject may provide cofinancing for the actual premium (para. 24). \n \n20. \nOutput 3: Skills development program strengthened. This output will help implement \nimportant  modifications  to  the  WER  skills  development  program  to  increase  beneficiaries\u2019 \nemployability  and  make \ntransparent,  and \naccountable.  The  target  beneficiaries  will  be  offered  improved,  targeted  skills  training  in forms \nthat  match  their  personal  circumstances,  and  provide  better  matches  to  wage  and  self-\nemployment  opportunities  that  exist  within  their  districts.  The  training  will  be  provided  to \nbeneficiaries  or  their  family  members  in  communities,  companies,  and  training  centers, \ndepending on the needs and abilities of trainees and skill demands in their locations.  \n \n21. \nDuring phase 1, the project will finance a survey of employment opportunities and skills \nneeds in the 13 districts identified by the BISP for pilot programs during 2014\u20132016. The project \nwill develop and implement a complete monitoring and evaluation framework (including external \nmonitoring  arrangements),  with  a  dedicated  management  information  system  for  the  WER  to \nenhance BISP oversight and control capabilities. The project will strengthen the existing center-\nbased  modality  on  a  priority  basis  by  addressing  current  contractual  and  delivery  flaws.  The \nproject  will  also  support  training  course  standardization  for  high-demand  skills,  and  the \nengagement  of  a  social  mobilization  organization  to  match  BISP  nominees  with  training \nopportunities.  In  parallel  two  additional  modalities,  community-based  and  enterprise-based \ntraining,  will  be  added  to  the WER.  They  will  provide  shorter  and  less  expensive  courses  that \nare more relevant to beneficiaries\u2019 circumstances, especially female beneficiaries in rural areas.  \n \n22. \nImplementation  of  the  two  new  modalities  will  start  during  phase  2  in  2015.  The  new \ntraining methods will be rolled out based on a strategic road map, which will be presented first to \nthe  BISP  board.  The  gradual  redistribution  of  resources  will  allow  the  training  of  many  more \nbeneficiaries  within  the  existing  WER  budget.  In  phase  3,  the  program  can  be  gradually \nexpanded to cover more districts. Depending on the findings of the first impact evaluation and a \nmidterm review, the project could provide additional cofinancing support (para. 24).  \n\nthe  program  more  cost-effective, \n\nfinancially \n\n \n\n\f6  \n\nOutput  4:  Financial  management  and  control  systems,  and  policy  research \n23. \nimproved.  This  output  will  help  develop  transparent  financial  management  and  adequate \nmonitoring systems in the BISP. It will strengthen the financial management wing, and introduce \nmodern  tools  and  practices  in  the  area  of  budget  preparation,  cash  forecasting,  and  financial \nreporting.  It  will  support the  internal  audit  wing  by  providing resources  and training  on modern \ninternal  audit  tools  and  practices.  It  will  strengthen  the  social  policy  research  unit,  providing \nsupport for engendered (gender focused), evidence-based policy and planning. \n \nPerformance  allocation  for  graduation  programs.  This  allocation  will  enable  the \n24. \nproject  to  finance  the  scaling-up  challenges  that  the  programs  supported  by  outputs  2 (health \ninsurance)  and  3  (skills  development)  will  eventually  face.  Resources  will  remain  unallocated \nuntil a thorough midterm review is conducted. The performance allocation enables the project to \n(i)  provide  additional  support  for  related  procurement  or  fiduciary  risks  in  the  two  pilots  before \ncommitting to fund part of the main costs involved in scaling-up WER and WES activities (actual \npremium  or  training  delivery  fees);  (ii)  encourage  good  implementation  performance  in  both \ncomponents  toward  agreed  targets;  and  (iii)  base  conditions  for  project  financing  of  actual \ninsurance and training service delivery on efficient, effective, and transparent implementation of \nboth programs during the first part of the project. \n \n25.  Midterm  project  review.  The  midterm  review,  scheduled  for  the  third  quarter  of  2016 \nwill  assess  the  progress  of  project  activities,  outputs,  and  outcomes.  The  performance  of  \noutputs  2  (health  insurance)  and  3  (skills  development)  will  be  reviewed  in detail  to  determine \nachievement  of  quantitative  targets  indicated  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework,  and \nqualitative  goals  described  in  detail  in  the  project  administration  manual. 21  Based  on  the \nfindings, the midterm review will recommend use of the performance allocation fund designated \nfor  the  two  graduation  programs  during  the  second  part  of  the  project.  The  $40  million \nperformance  allocation  fund  will  only  be  used  after  the  midterm  review  is  successfully \ncompleted;  and  the  government,  BISP,  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  the  use  of  the  loan  for  this \ncomponent and its implementation arrangements. \n \nD. \n \n26. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $578.3 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nExpansion of coverage of cash transfer program \nRefinement and rollout of health insurance program \nStrengthening of skills development program \nSupport to financial management and control \nPerformance allocation for graduation programs \nSubtotal (A) \n\nBase Costb \n1.  \n2.  \n3.  \n4.  \n5. \n \nContingenciesc \nFinancing Charges During Implementation \nTotal (A+B+C) \n \n\nItem \nA.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB.  \nC.  \n \na  Includes taxes and duties of $1.8 million to be financed by government resources. \nb  In mid-2013 prices. \nc  Physical contingencies computed at 5% for field research and development, training, surveys, and studies.

The  cash  transfer  program \nand the health insurance program smooth family consumption and mitigate the impact of health-\nrelated  shocks.  Cash  transfers  will  improve  the  nutritional  status  of  the  family,  particularly  of \nchildren.  Better  nutrition  for  children  is  an  important  determinant  of  cognitive  development, \nschool  attainment,  and  return  to  schooling.  In  the  long  term,  skills  training  can  significantly \nincrease beneficiaries\u2019 earning potential, especially in Pakistan where the unskilled\u2013skilled labor \nwage  gap  is  significant.  In  the  longer  term,  investments  in  social  protection  can  yield \ngovernment savings, as the poorest households become more resilient to shocks and build their \nhuman capital; they are able to improve their employment potential, thus graduating from BISP \nprograms.  \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe ADB financial management assessment rates the premitigation risk substantial and \n32. \nidentifies  several  weaknesses  in  the  BISP  financial  management  system.  The  following  were \nfound to be of direct relevance for the project: (i) weak processes for reconciliation with Pakistan \nPost  and  no  regular  reconciliation  of  beneficiary  payments  made  through  the  banking  system; \n(ii)  absence  of  audited  financial  statements;  (iii)  weak  institutional  capacity;  and  (iv)  delays  in \nreleases  from  the  federal  government.  The  BISP  is  required,  through  the  BISP  Act  2010,  to \nhave  its  financial  statements  audited  on  an  annual  basis  by  AGP.  To  date,  the  BISP  has  not \nprepared annual financial statements. At the request of ADB, DFID, and World Bank, the BISP \nis preparing its financial statements for FY2012 and FY2013. The FY2013 financial statements \nwill  be  audited  by  AGP  and  provided  to  ADB  prior  to  the  loan  being  declared  effective.  For \nconcerns about financial management and reporting, the corruption risk is rated substantial. \n \n33. \nADB, DFID, and World Bank are working closely with the BISP on an ongoing basis to \nidentify and mitigate fiduciary risks. The BISP now processes quarterly cash payments using a \nmanagement  information  system-based  payment  mechanism  that  avoids  duplication  of \npayments. TA provided by the World Bank (which is significantly involved in day-to-day financial \nmanagement operations) helps mitigate the fiduciary risks. Ongoing ADB TA helped to resolve \nbank and Pakistan Post reconciliations and other issues. Initially all payments were transferred \nthrough Pakistan Post. Since 2012, the BISP has been issuing debit cards, and by the start of \nthe  project  most  payments  will  be  made  through  private  banks.  This  allows  for  management \ninformation system-based account reconciliation on a monthly basis. The project will reimburse \nthe BISP for payments through Pakistan Post and through banks for the first quarterly payment \nto new beneficiaries after reconciliation. To reduce corruption risk, the BISP maintains a website \nwhere individual beneficiaries can log in and check their entitlements and payment status. The \nBISP is partnering with Transparency International to monitor BISP procurement processes.  \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n34. \nwith  the  government  and  the  BISP.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 21). \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n35. \nPoverty and social impacts. The cash transfer program is highly successful in reaching \nthe  poorest  families  (footnote  8).  The  quarterly  payments  provide  a  regular  income  to  poor \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nfamilies  and  help  smooth  consumption.  The  transfer  amounts  to  around  7%  of  monthly  family \nexpenditure, and would require an increase to substantially change consumption patterns. While \nthe  cash  transfer  bridges  some  of  the  gap  between  actual  income  and the  amount  needed  to \nmove out of poverty, the payment does not create any undesirable dependency. \n \n36. \nGender impacts. The project contributes to gender empowerment as the major thematic \npurpose of the intervention. The project design is based on gender analysis from many sources \nincluding an extensive BISP baseline evaluation study and focus group discussions. Women in \neach eligible household are the recipients of the cash transfers. The necessary preconditions of \nthe  CNIC  and  the  provision  of  a  dedicated  bank  account  add  to  the  empowerment  potential. \nWomen  are  the  primary  health  insurance  cardholders,  with  family  member  eligibility  linked  to \nthem.  Community-based  training  is  more  likely  to  draw  women  participants.  All  of  these \narrangements have been shown to increase the \u201cfelt worth\u201d of women in poor households, and \nhave the potential to improve women\u2019s role in intrahousehold management of resources, ability \nto make decisions, and contribution to the household economy. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n37. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples in accordance with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The BISP \nis  an  inclusive  program  that  does  not  discriminate  based  on  indigenous  status.  The  program \nbeneficiaries  are  selected  based  on  the  results  of  a  poverty  scorecard  survey  using  proxy \nmeans  testing.  No  questions  are  included  on  religion,  language,  or  ethnicity,  to  ensure \nparticipation and inclusion of all poor irrespective of tribe, subtribe, or minority status. Since the \nproject will not support any physical intervention, no land acquisition will be required. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n38.  While  systems  are  in  place  to  ensure  transparency  and  funds  delivery  to  the \nbeneficiaries  in  a  timely  manner,  institutional  capacity  will  need  to  be  strengthened  to  make \npayments  a  low-risk  intervention.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  as \nfollows, and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.22  \n \nThe  overall  risk  rating  is  substantial.  The  key  risks  are  specific  weaknesses  in  BISP \n39. \nfinancial management: (i) lack of regular reconciliation of the cash transfer program, (ii) absence \nof  annual  financial  statements  for  the  program,  (iii)  absence  of  annual  audit  of  the  program \nfinancial  statements,  (iv)  outstanding  issues  arising  from  the  audit  of  the  project  financial \nstatements of the AETP Subprogram 2, (v) weak institutional capacity (including weaknesses in \nfinancial reporting and internal audit), and (vi) delays in releases from the federal government.  \n \nIn  consultation  with  DFID  and  World  Bank,  risk  mitigation  actions  were  identified  to \n40. \naddress  financial  management  weaknesses:  (i)  ADB,  DFID  and  World  Bank  assisted  in  the \nreconciliation of all funds transferred through FY2013 by Pakistan Post and partner banks; the \nBISP  adopted  a  timely  and  acceptable  reconciliation  process  for  future  transfers;  (ii)  the  BISP \nwill  prepare  annual  financial  statements  for  audit  starting  with  FY2012  and  FY2013;  (iii)  the \nBISP will have audited financial statements prepared from FY2013 onward; (iv) the resolution of \nthe issue with the AETP Subprogram 2 audit opinion within a specified timeframe is a covenant \nfor  the  loan;  (v)  ADB,  DFID,  and World  Bank  are  providing  support  for  financial  management \n\n                                                \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10  \n\nand internal audit, and helping to ensure a sufficient number of qualified staff for long-term risk \nmitigation; and (vi) the timely release of government funds is listed as a covenant.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n41. \nThe  government  and  the  BISP  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n42. \nThe  government  and  the  BISP  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. The government and \nthe BISP also agreed to the following conditions for effectiveness:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  BISP  board  will  establish  an  audit  committee  of  the  board  to  oversee  the \nfinancial  reporting  and  audit  of  the  BISP,  which  includes  the  review  of  internal \naudit  reports.  Such  a  committee  will  include  a  nongovernment  member  of  the \nboard, preferably with audit oversight experience.  \nThe  BISP  will  provide  to  ADB  (a)  BISP\u2019s  unaudited  financial  statements  for \nFY2012  and  FY2013  by  30  September  2013  and  (b)  BISP\u2019s  audited  financial \nstatements for FY2013 (with the associated audit report and management letter) \ntogether  with  an  action  plan,  satisfactory  to  ADB,  to  address  any  deficiencies \nidentified in the audit. \n\n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n43. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR283,776,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Social \nProtection Development Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge \nat  the  rate  of  2%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  thereafter;  for  a  term  of  25  years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \n     President \n\n27 September 2013 \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks  \n\nAssumption \nEconomic growth is \nsustained. \n\nRisk \nFiscal policy constrains \ngovernment \nexpenditure \n\n \n\n \n\nAssumption \nLabor market (wage \nand self-employment) is \nable to absorb skilled \nlabor trained under the \nproject. \n \nRisk  \nSpecific weaknesses in \nfinancial management \nlead to \nunderachievement of \ntargets, high transaction \ncost, and unsatisfied \nbeneficiaries. \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \nPakistan social and \nliving standards \nmeasurement survey \n\nPakistan social and \nliving standards \nmeasurement survey  \nMultiple indicator cluster \nsurvey \n\n \n\nHousehold integrated \neconomic survey \nBISP impact evaluation  \n\nInternal monitoring  \nImpact evaluation of \nhealth insurance \nprogram \n\nSurvey on economic \nopportunities and skills \nneeds \nImpact evaluation of \nskills development \nprogram \n\n \nQuarterly internal \nmonitoring reports \nNADRA reports \n\nRisk \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nReduced income \npoverty and \nnonincome poverty \nfor poor families in \nPakistan \n\nOutcome \n\nIncreased resilience \nof female BISP \nbeneficiaries and \ntheir families \n\nOutputs \n1.
