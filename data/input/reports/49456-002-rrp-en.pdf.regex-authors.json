THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed grant \nto the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and (ii) a proposed grant to the Federated States of \nMicronesia (FSM) for the Improving the Quality of Basic Education in the North Pacific Project. The \nreport also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Government of \nAustralia, and if the Board approves the proposed grants, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n2.  The proposed project will assist the governments of the RMI and FSM to improve the quality \nof basic education in the remote and dispersed island countries, while ensuring efficiency and \neffectiveness  through  shared  solutions  to  common  challenges  across  the  two  neighboring \ncountries. The project will build on the successes and lessons learned under previous regional \ntechnical assistance (TA) in the North Pacific.1 It takes a comprehensive and sustainable approach \nfor effective reforms, rooted in strengthening existing institutions until 2023 when the United States \n(US) Compact of Free Association ends.2 The project will improve learning outcomes for primary \nschool students, with a focus on literacy and numeracy, through improvements to teacher quality, \nassessment for learning, access to bilingual teaching and learning resources for literacy and \nnumeracy, and improved educational leadership and management including parent and community \nengagement in education.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Both the RMI and FSM recognize the need to improve the quality of basic education, even \nwith the gains made in increasing access to education. Student performance is alarmingly low, with \nonly 21% of sixth graders meeting or exceeding the minimum competency in mathematics and 32% \nmeeting or exceeding the minimum competency in reading in the FSM.3 In the RMI, 20% of sixth \ngraders meet or exceed proficiency levels in mathematics and 19% meet or exceed proficiency \nlevels in reading.4 \n \n4.  Weak education outcomes stem from many factors, notably poor teacher quality. The \nminimum qualification for teaching, the 2-year associate\u2019s degree, has not been met by 17% of \nteachers in the FSM and 38% in the RMI (footnotes 2 and 3). In addition, only the second year of \nthe  associate\u2019s  degree  focuses  on  teacher  education  courses,  and  professional  learning \nopportunities are not continuous or necessarily coherent. Urban teachers and schools receive more \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Quality Primary Education in the North Pacific. Manila. The Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction-financed TA piloted early grade learning assessments, teacher training, and teaching and learning \nresource materials. Results from a comparative baseline of early grade learning assessment conducted 1 year apart \nindicate an increase in literacy and numeracy performance by an overall average ranging from 24% to 32% for both \ngroups of randomly selected students from grade 3 and 5 in three different project sites in RMI and FSM.  \n2  The Compact of Free Association is an international agreement establishing and governing the relationships of free \nassociation between the United States and the three Pacific Island nations: the Federated States of Micronesia, \nthe Marshall Islands, and Palau. In the FSM and the RMI, compact funds comprise the majority of expenditures in \neducation, health, and infrastructure. In FSM annual Compact Sector Grants to education are around $25 million, and \nin RMI around $11 million.  \n3  Government of the Federated States of Micronesia, National Department of Education. 2015.

Low student learning outcomes at the primary \neducation level become magnified and more expensive to resolve at higher levels of education, \nwhen disenfranchised youth create larger societal issues. A young population in both countries \noffers a substantial labor force that must be capitalized on to maximize potential growth. \n \n5.  A major challenge for RMI and FSM is adjusting to regular cuts in the US Compact of Free \nAssociation  grants,  which  fund  most  of  the  operating  budgets  in  education,  health,  and \ninfrastructure. The urgency of improving education is heightened by the end of the Compact and \nthe US supplemental education grant funds in 2023, which compromise 100% of state education \nbudgets in the FSM and about 69% of the national education budget in the RMI. Compact funds \nsupport recurrent costs but are insufficient to address significant training needs or teaching and \nlearning resources. The potential cessation of supplemental education grant funds (estimated at \n$10 million annually for FSM and $5 million for RMI) after 2023 is a larger issue, as these are not \nincluded in the projections for sustainable disbursement from the established trust fund after 2023 \nsince the trust fund is modeled on education sector grant funds only. This 6-year project is critically \npositioned  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  local  educational  institutions,  which  provide  strong \nfoundations to work together more effectively and efficiently to build resiliency following 2023. \n \n6.  The project is included in the ADB Pacific Department\u2019s Regional Operations Business \nPlan, 2017\u20132019; and education is a core area under the Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020.5 The \nproject aligns with both countries\u2019 national development plans and education sector plans, and the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) is providing support to review and develop the next sector strategic \nplan for each country in 2017.6 Demand for education support from ADB in the North Pacific is very \nstrong, as ADB is the major education donor aside from the Government of the United States. The \nGovernment  of  Australia\u2019s  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade,  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency volunteers, and the US Peace Corps volunteer program operate in the \neducation  sector,  mainly  at  primary  level,  and  synergies  between  those  initiatives  will  be \nharmonized with the project as was done under the previous TA. The Government of Australia has \nbeen supporting the education sector and ADB TA in the RMI and FSM through the Pacific \nTechnical Assistance Mechanism advisors and volunteers in both countries. The Government of \nAustralia is also a co-financier on the project for the FSM. \n \n7.  The project will build on the previous TA, which worked in a small number of schools, and \nwill be most effective where supportive institutional backing exists. In the FSM, it will work in the \nstates of Pohnpei and Kosrae (where a preceding TA was piloted) and Yap state, which has shown \nstrong institutional backing. After mobilization, the project will consider the most strategic entry \npoints to Chuuk, which has the largest education and development challenges7. As the project \nbecomes embedded in the other states, it will be better positioned to take on Chuuk\u2019s more serious \neducation challenges. In the RMI, the project will focus on Majuro, Ebeye, Jaluit and Wotje outer \nislands. \n \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020.

ADB is providing support with additional grant cofinancing from \nthe Global Partnership for Education to develop sector strategic plans for the RMI and FSM. \n7  Chuuk is the most populous state of FSM with lowest rates of education performance historically. The US Department \nof Interior in partnership with the FSM National Government and Chuuk State Government completed a 10-point reform \naction plan to help the state get to a basic level of functional education services. A new permanent director was \nconfirmed in April 2017 and should help to address the delayed progress due to a lack of leadership for the past 4 \nyears. \n \n ", "3 \n8.  Improving the quality of basic education in the RMI and FSM requires strengthening the \ncollaborative and collective efforts of existing stakeholders to work together more effectively and \nefficiently. Primary partners and stakeholders include tertiary institutions responsible for educating \nRMI and FSM teachers and principals; FSM national department of education (NDOE), state \ndepartments  of  education  (SDOEs),  and  the  RMI  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE);  relevant \nnongovernment organizations; and above all, parents and community. It is anticipated that all \nprimary school students and primary school teachers (29,236 students and 2,485 primary school \nteachers) will benefit from the project (footnotes 2 and 3). This represents about 20% of the \ncombined total population of 157,450 people across the RMI and FSM.8 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The project is aligned with the following impact: improved quality of basic education in the \nFSM and the RMI. The project will have the following outcome: improved primary education \nlearning outcomes in literacy and numeracy, with 50% of grade 6 students meeting or exceeding \nthe minimum competency for reading and mathematics.9 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n10.  The project will deliver four outputs: (i) teachers in primary education are better prepared; \n(ii) capacity to use student assessment to improve learning strengthened; (iii) access to and usage \nof teaching and learning resources and materials for literacy and numeracy expanded; and \n(iv) educational  leadership  and  management  of  schools,  including  parent  and  community \nengagement, strengthened.  \n \n11.  Output 1: Teachers in primary education are better prepared. Under the project, \nteaching  quality  will  be  enhanced  through  strengthened  teacher  in-service  programs  and \npreservice programs. A total of 400 teachers will be trained in quality pedagogy in RMI and 800 \nteachers will be trained in the FSM. The project will support implementation of a quality teacher \neducation program that includes experiential and project-based learning, use of Open Education \nResources,10 and ensures a foundation for all teachers in Quality Pedagogy Framework.11 The \nproject holds student learning as the driving emphasis of teacher practice, drawing on local \nevidence of what works and responding to cultural differences.  \n \n12.  Activities  that  will  support  better  prepared  teachers  in  primary  education 12 include \n(i) developing  professional  learning  policy  frameworks;  (ii)  training  teachers  on  literacy  and \nnumeracy across the curriculum within a quality pedagogy framework; (iii) improving alignment \nbetween preservice teacher education and in-service teacher education; (iv) establishing a new \n                                                \n8  World Bank Data, 2015. http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL  \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n10  Open educational resources. https://www.oercommons.org/  \n11  The quality pedagogy framework uses evidence-based factors required for improving student learning: social \ninteraction, prior knowledge, learning outcomes and success criteria, time and varied opportunities for learning, active \nprocesses, relevant and meaningful activities, assessment for learning, reflection, and teacher expectations. These \nkey components need to be understood and modeled in all lessons in college courses by teacher educators, and by \nall trainees in their classroom practice, so that the processes become internalized. The framework is also central to \nall professional learning offered by the MOE and/or the National Department of Education (NDOE) and explicit in all \nmaterials and templates used for preservice and in-service teacher education. \n12  Primary education in both the RMI and FSM generally includes grades 1\u20138, with kindergarten classes attached to \nprimary schools. The project will place greater emphasis on kindergarten to grade 6. High school comprises grades \n9\u201312. \n ", "4 \nsystem  of  lead  teachers  and  induction  that  at  least  40%  of  schools  will  implement;  and \n(v) developing career pathways for teachers. \n \n13.  Output 2: Capacity to use student assessment to improve learning strengthened. The \nquality, validity, and utility of current student assessment tools raise some concerns, and the \npolicies and practices that enable their successful implementation need to be reviewed. The project \nwill expand the knowledge base of DOE and MOE staff and schools about principles and guidelines \nfrom current research on student learning assessment systems. DOE and MOE officials and \nstakeholders  will  be  provided  with  a  framework  for  discussion  and,  with  technical  support, \nparticipate in the development of a sound and sustainable student assessment system that will \nsupport improved education, quality, and learning for all.13 \n \n14.  The project will support a review and exploration of student assessment systems, including \nthe  use  of  alternative  assessments,  to  inform  the  development  of  a  new  national  student \nassessment  policy framework  in  each  country.14 The frameworks  will  comprise  policies  and \nprocesses that will strengthen the capacity of the system to use assessment to improve learning. \nThrough government teachers\u2019 academy and institute training programs, the project will support \nclassroom assessment practices that inform teaching and learning. At least 50% of teachers will \nuse student assessment data to tailor teaching practice to meet student learning needs, and at \nleast 50% of teachers will use alternative assessments such as early grade learning assessment \nand short assessments in literacy and mathematics. Activities will include strengthening policy and \npractice by (i) establishing a student assessment policy framework, and (ii) training teachers on \nalternative assessments for learning. \n \n15.  Output 3: Access to and usage of teaching and learning resources and materials for \nliteracy and numeracy expanded. The project will support the RMI and FSM to strengthen their \ninventory of existing resources and materials for teaching and learning. Many types of resources \nbeyond textbooks\u2014such as readers in the vernacular language, hands-on manipulatives for \nnumeracy skills, e-resources, open education resources, and low-cost mobile learning tools\u2014will \nbe used to address a range of learners, including in more rural and/or remote outer islands without \ninternet services. At least 75% of teachers will access resources through flash drives, online \ncatalogues, or a resource center; and at least 90% of teachers will participate in professional \nlearning on using resources to improve learning. Activities will include (i) the establishment of a \nnew resource center in the RMI and, possibly, the FSM; (ii) the development of multiple types of \nteaching and learning resources including prints, digital, and hands-on manipulative resources; and \n(iii) supporting community and school partnerships in developing teaching and learning resources. \n \n16.  Output 4: Educational leadership and management of schools, including parent and \ncommunity engagement, strengthened. Strong leadership and management in schools is critical \nto enable effective teaching and learning to occur. The professional learning framework described \nin output 1 will include important policies, process, and structures developed during the project that \nwill support principals as well as teachers. New principal performance standards developed by the \nNDOE and MOE that highlight educational leadership will guide professional learning opportunities \nto strengthen effective management skills and capabilities to be a leader of learning, including \ncommunity participation. At least 90% of principals will participate in such professional learning. \n                                                \n13  M. Clarke. 2012.

They measure performance in forms other than traditional paper-and-pencil and multiple choice \nand short answer tests. The early grade learning assessment and short assessments for literacy and short \nassessments for mathematics are examples of alternative assessments. \n ", "5 \n \n17.  Parental engagement is critical to supporting and ensuring the key areas of teacher quality \nand school leadership. The project will conduct wide stakeholder consultations with parents and \ncivil society to develop and support the implementation of strategies to promote broad public \nawareness of the importance of education and increased parental engagement in education as \nfundamental  to  improving  the  school  readiness  of  students.  Churches  and  nongovernment \norganizations, as strong community mobilizers, have the potential to strengthen literacy and \nnumeracy significantly through parent and community education workshops, and will contribute to \nproject  efforts.  The  principals\u2019  training  programs  will  integrate  and  strengthen  parent  and \ncommunity engagement as a key aspect of educational leadership. Activities include (i) the \nestablishment of principal performance standards (the RMI only); (ii) the training of school leaders \nin educational leadership; (iii) supporting the development of parents as partners in the school \neducation program; and (iv) the expansion of school-based sustainable development projects. \n \nD.

The financing \nplan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to teaching supplies and resources, \ntraining and capacity building, equipment and consulting services.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  Regional initiative. Project management and implementation involves two countries in a \nregional  initiative  that will  address their  common  educational  challenges.  The  project  brings \ntogether multiple agencies working closely together to provide needed resources and expertise to \nimprove  the  quality  of  education,  while  allowing  for  synergies  and  cost  efficiencies  and \neffectiveness through a regional approach. The project administration manual (PAM) details the \nimplementation, procurement, and financial arrangements at the country level, but countries will \nshare lessons, experts, and resources on a regular basis\u2014meeting annually and developing \nregional expertise, approaches, and solutions.15 The procurement plan details each country\u2019s \nprocurement packages following country budget allocations. Both countries will have project start-\nup support, focusing on procurement and financial management. The project will also support \npartnership agreements between the DOE and MOE and two colleges and a university\u2014the \nCollege of the Marshall Islands, the University of the South Pacific (RMI), and the College of \nMicronesia (FSM). These will be service providers to improve preservice, in-service education, and \nrelated project activities; and will be capacitated along with DOE and MOE from project-supported \ninternational consulting expertise where gaps exist in technical expertise. \n \n21.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  The economic benefits of the project result mainly from improved literacy and numeracy \nfoundational skills in primary education, and the higher levels of education and training students \n ", "8 \ncan access with those skills. It is reasonable to expect that system-wide improvements in quality \neducation in bilingual and multilingual contexts will benefit all students in public education in the \nRMI and FSM. Such benefits will be quantified as incremental benefits of basic education, resulting \nfrom improved student learning outcomes as measured by national assessments. \n \n24.  The economic analysis confirms that the economic rationale for the project is sound, the \ncase for ADB involvement in the project is sound, and the project design represents a cost-effective \noption for reaching project objectives. The project is nonrevenue generating, so a financial internal \nrate of return and financial net present value cannot be calculated. Since no investments will be \nmade in tangible assets such as civil works, it is not necessary to demonstrate ability to allocate \nfunds for maintenance of assets through the government budget. The financial commitment \nrequired  from  government  is  to  allocate  funds  in  the  budget  during  each  year  of  project \nimplementation as counterpart funding for the project. \n  \n25.  The financial analysis assessed the sustainability of the project at national and project \nlevels, and evaluated the impact of the proposed investment given current and projected public \neducation subsector funding levels. The analysis concluded that the government has the capacity \nto absorb and sustain the costs of the project, but that institutional strengthening of both the RMI \nMOE and the FSM national and state departments of education is required. \n \n26.  The project will not impose unsustainable costs on the system after it ends, as it is designed \nto minimize downstream recurrent costs. The medium-term fiscal outlook for both countries is not \nencouraging, however, and with the end of the Compact sector grants in FY2023, the delivery of \nbasic social services could be problematic without significant reforms  being implemented or \nalternative external support identified. \n \n27.  The project is based on several assumptions about the determinants of early grade learning \noutcomes. To mitigate risks, it is proposed to (i) monitor progress in reforms targeted at providing \nfiscal space; (ii) conduct a robust demand analysis early in project implementation; (iii) strengthen \nMOE and DOE capacity to conduct research and policy analyses related to key assumptions; and \n(iv) include a mid-project review and exit strategy if outstanding risks have not been addressed. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n28.  Financial management and procurement capacity assessments were carried out at the \ncountry and executing agency levels in both countries. Assessment of financial management \ncapacity included accounting, internal control, disbursement, cash flow management, financial \nreporting,  and  auditing.  Procurement  capacity  assessment  included  rules  and  regulations \ngoverning procurement practices, staff capacity, knowledge and experience of procurement staff, \nprocedures, transparency, and integrity of procurement practices. Findings indicate that legal and \nregulatory frameworks as well as standard operating procedures are in place for financial and \nprocurement management, and are followed by ministries and departments concerned in each \ncountry. The executing agency in each country has staff to handle financial and procurement \nmanagement under the project. Computerized accounting and reporting systems (FundWare and \n4-Gov Fund Accounting) are used in the RMI for financial management, but some functions such \nas  bank  reconciliation  and  fixed  assets  management  are  still  being  done  manually.  These \nweaknesses will be strengthened during project implementation. Periodic financial reporting needs \nto be improved and some internal audit oversight needs to be established to assess and develop \ninternal controls. Retention of experienced staff remains the most important factor for good financial \nmanagement. The overall inherent risk and control risk have been assessed moderate. \n \n ", "9 \n29.  Both  countries  have  a  well-established  public  procurement  system,  governed  by  the \nProcurement Code for the RMI and the Financial Management Regulations for the FSM. The public \nprocurement  systems  in  both  countries  ensure  transparency,  accountability,  efficiency,  and \nresponsibilities, among others, of government agencies and individuals involved in carrying out \nprocurement activities. The overall procurement risks in both countries have been assessed \naverage. All procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time \nto time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernments  and,  as  executing  agencies,  the  FSM  National  Department  of  Finance  and \nAdministration, and RMI Ministry of Finance. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  A social, poverty, and gender analysis undertaken determined that the project\u2019s objectives \nand goals are consistent with ADB\u2019s Pacific regional strategies and both countries\u2019 national \ndevelopment  plans.  A  gender  action  plan  (GAP),  stakeholder  communication  strategy,  and \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy inputs were prepared. At the initial poverty and \nsocial analysis stage, the project was classified general intervention. The project is categorized \neffective gender mainstreaming, and includes sex-disaggregated data in the project design and \nmonitoring framework and GAP for targets and baselines where possible. The GAP addresses \npotential gender inequality risks and promotes women\u2019s empowerment through targets for equal \nparticipation in project activities. \n \n31.  Implementing agencies and PIUs will be responsible for ensuring that social and gender-\nrelated design measures and targets are implemented, properly resourced, and monitored. The \nGAP provides for training on gender awareness to be incorporated into training workshops for \nteachers, principals, and parent and community. The Pacific Community gender specialist in the \nFSM and the Women\u2019s Affairs Unit in Majuro will also support gender focal points identified in the \nPIU and implementing agency of each country. The PIUs will collect sex-disaggregated baseline \ndata, and all project reports will contain sex-disaggregated data. \n \nD.  Safeguards  \n \n32.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.16 \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). No civil works are planned during the project, and \nno potential exists to involve involuntary land acquisition resulting in physical and economic \ndisplacement.  \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples (category C). As the dominant populations of both the RMI and FSM \nare indigenous to the islands. Project activities are designed to include all students and teachers \nas well as parents and communities, with no differentiation in benefits accruing to any group. \n \n35.  Environment (category C). No negative environmental impacts will occur as no civil works \nwill take place. No environmental management plan is required. \n \n \n                                                \n16  ADB.
