I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Secondary Cities Development Project.1 \n \n2.  The project cities\u2014Buon Ma Thuot (Dak Lak province), Ha Tinh (Ha Tinh province), and \nTam Ky (Quang Nam province)\u2014are provincial capitals representative of Viet Nam\u2019s rapidly \ndeveloping secondary cities.2 Buon Ma Thuot contributes one-third of Viet Nam\u2019s total coffee \nexports.3 Ha Tinh provides strategic connectivity within the Greater Mekong Subregion.4 Tam Ky \ncomprises  the  Chu  Lai  special  economic  zone.5 Limited  urban  infrastructure,  degraded \nenvironment quality, and vulnerability to storms and typhoons in the coastal cities constrain \nthese  cities\u2019  growth  potential.  The  project  will  finance  urban  environment  improvement \ninfrastructure through 11 subprojects.6 These will cover (i) solid waste management (SWM) for \nimproved  environmental  quality;  (ii)  urban  road  upgrading  for  improved  connectivity  and \nevacuation  during  disasters;  and  (iii)  completion  of  flood  dikes,  drainage  channels,  and \nregulating basins for flood protection. The project optimizes development impact by adding to \nthe flood protection and drainage infrastructure initiated through a previous Asian Development \nBank (ADB) project for Ha Tinh and Tam Ky.7 Project management skills and mechanisms will \nbe  improved for  integrated  urban  development,  environment  planning,  and  climate change \nadaptation. Interventions for women, disadvantaged groups, and community awareness have \nbeen integrated into the project design.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Core urban growth issues. Viet Nam\u2019s population and economy are rapidly urbanizing \nwith a structural shift from agriculture to industry and services, which account for nearly 80% of \nthe economy since 2005.8 These sectors are key contributors to urban expansion and the rural \nto urban transition. Although urban poverty is significantly reduced, inequality in income and \naccess to basic services remain. Natural disasters and climate-induced impacts add to the \nassociated social, economic, and environment costs of rapid urbanization, especially in the \nsecondary cities with limited capacity to address consequences of rapid urbanization.9 This is \nrecognized in the Framework Master Plan for Urban Development in Viet Nam to 2025 and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2011. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing \nthe Secondary Cities Development Project. Manila (TA 7856-VIE). \n3  Buon Ma Thuot is strategic for transport connectivity in the central highlands. It is class I, with population (about \n311,965) growing at 3.17% per year. \n4  Ha Tinh in the north\u2013central region has a population of 94,022 with expected annual growth of 8%. It is currently \nclass III, to be upgraded to class II by 2015.  It is prone to flooding because of its flat terrain and surrounding \nnatural river courses, with limited drainage capacity of streams and ponds. \n5  Tam Ky has a population of about 109,000, projected to increase to 150,000 by 2015 with annual growth of 1.15%. \nCurrently class III to be upgraded to a class II city by 2015, it is affected by an average of five typhoons each year. \nIt has high annual precipitation with average annual rainfall of 3,448 millimeters. \n6  Key criteria is to improve climate resilience, environmental quality, and climate change adaptation by communities. \n7  ADB. 2013. Completion Report: Central Region Urban Environmental Improvement Project in Viet Nam. Manila.  \n8  Government of Viet Nam, Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2011. Socio-Economic Development Strategy, \n2011\u20132020. Ha Noi (January). \n9  According  to  the  National  Climate  Change  Strategy  (approved  through  Decision  No.2139/QD-TTg,  dated \n5 December 2011), since 1963, Viet Nam has experienced an average temperature rise of 0.5oC\u20130.7oC; a sea \nlevel rise of 20 centimeters; and worsening floods, storms, and droughts.  ", "2   \nVision to 2050.10 The master plan aims to achieve balanced and strategic growth through a \nnational system of capably managed urban centers, envisaging secondary and tertiary cities as \ndevelopment hubs within the provincial context. Developing provincial capital cities as pilots in \ndifferent  geographic  regions  will  boost  the  local  economy,  balance  regional  development, \nstrengthen rural\u2013urban links, and address overcrowding in primary urban centers.   \n \n4.  Improved  climate  resilience  of  infrastructure.  The  challenge  for  Viet  Nam  is  to \nmaintain its long-term development prospects by minimizing risks associated with urbanization. \nAdapting critical infrastructure by building climate resilience in coastal and low-lying areas will \nsafeguard vulnerable populations and productive sectors of the economy, including its natural \nresources.11 The project responds to stakeholder priorities for improving climate resilience and \nenvironmental quality by (i) upgrading road links for connectivity within the urban areas and as \nconduits for evacuation during storms and typhoons; (ii) completing and upgrading flood dikes \nand regulating basins for improved drainage and storm water management; and (iii) providing \nan integrated SWM road map in Buon Ma Thuot for an improved urban environment. The \nsubprojects  will  provide  employment  potential,  including  among  the  urban  poor  and  other \nvulnerable groups. The project will enable the cities to transition into regional economic centers \nwith improved resilience and liveability. \n \n5.  Support related policies and strategies. The project will catalyze the implementation \nof Viet Nam\u2019s overarching policies contained in the Socio-Economic Development Strategy, \n2011\u20132020 and the Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2011\u20132015.12 The Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan, 2011\u20132015 emphasizes the need to (i) use natural resources efficiently, \n(ii) enhance environmental protection, (iii) prevent and limit adverse impacts of natural disasters, \nand (iv) respond effectively to climate change. The selected subprojects are enabled by sector \npolicies, including the Viet Nam National Green Growth Strategy and the National Action Plan \non  Climate  Change;  and  key  sector  orientation  plans  related  to  land  drainage  and  flood \nprotection, SWM, and roads infrastructure.13 The subprojects comply with each city\u2019s master \nplan and are aligned with ADB\u2019s policies and sector priorities; urban operational plan, 2012\u2013\n2020;  and  the  Viet  Nam  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132015,  which  promotes \ncomprehensive socioeconomic development in urban areas, fostering balanced growth and \nsocial  stability.14 ADB\u2019s  urban  sector  assessment,  strategy,  and  road  map  for  Viet  Nam \nidentifies  other  ADB  priorities  on  climate  change,  social  inclusion,  and  stakeholder \n                                                \n10  Government of Viet Nam, Ministry of Construction. 2009.

Lessons. The project responds to the lessons learned from ADB-financed urban sector \nprojects  in  Viet  Nam. 17  These  include  (i)  alignment  of  the  project  preparation  and \nimplementation schedule with the government\u2019s approval procedures; (ii) selecting qualified \nproject management consultants familiar with local rules and regulations; (iii) minimizing the \nnumber of procurement packages for efficient contract management; (iv) allocating sufficient \nfunds to contingencies due to high price escalation and possible design changes; (v) selecting a \ncoordinating  project  management  unit  (PMU);  and  (vi)  facilitating  advance  action  for  land \nacquisition, resettlement, and detailed engineering design.  \n  \n7.  Special  features.  The  project  optimizes  development  impact  by  adding  to  climate \nadaptation infrastructure in Ha Tinh and Tam Ky. Upgrading the dike in Tam Ky to improve \nViet Nam\u2019s standards for climate resilience will significantly increase the number of people, land, \nand assets protected. 18 Storm water management will be improved by additions to the major \nchannels  and  regulating  basins  to  strengthen  the  implementation  of  the  drainage  (urban \nwatershed based) master plan for Ha Tinh. All subprojects will enable local area regeneration \nand provide livelihood opportunities. The road map for community-based integrated SWM in \nBuon Ma Thuot will focus on source segregation; recycling; reducing waste that reaches the \nlandfill;  and  improving  community  awareness  through  information,  education,  and \ncommunication (IEC) campaigns, along with associated livelihood opportunities in composting, \nmaterials  recovery,  and  other  options.  This  complements  Buon  Ma  Thuot\u2019s  \u201cgreen  city\u201d \ncredentials  through  sustainable  environmental  practice.  Buon  Ma  Thuot  has  committed  to \ncharging a tariff to ensure continued operation and maintenance (O&M). The project cities have \ndemonstrated a high level of commitment by allocating their own budgets for advance actions \nfor detailed engineering design, land acquisition, and resettlement under the recently approved \nofficial development assistance (ODA) Decree 38.19 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the project will be an improved urban environment and climate resilient \ninfrastructure in Buon Ma Thuot in the central highland region and in the coastal cities of Ha \nTinh and Tam Ky. The outcome will be an increased coverage of resilient urban infrastructure \nand climate change adaptation in the participating cities. \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The  outputs  include  (i)  new  and  improved  urban  infrastructure  and climate  change \nadaptation; (ii) increased community awareness for sustainable environmental management \n                                                \n15  ADB.

DUE DILIGENCE  \nA.  Technical \n15.  The subprojects on flood and drainage management, SWM, and upgrading of strategic \nurban  roads  are  technically  feasible  and  use  optimum  design  solutions  and  standards  for \n                                                \n23  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "    7 \nclimate resilience. The need to raise design standards for flood protection and land drainage \nwas confirmed during feasibility studies.24 Subproject designs in Tam Ky and Ha Tinh for flood \nprotection  and  land  drainage  will  complete,  extend,  and  upgrade  the  dike  and  drainage \nchannels that commenced as part of the Central Region Urban Environmental Improvement \nProject  for  Viet  Nam.25 Provincial  and  district  authorities  have  the  capacity  and  skill  for \nundertaking all types of civil works, O&M, and construction management.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n16.  Economic analysis was done for all subprojects with computation of economic internal \nrate of return, net present value, and benefit\u2013cost ratio. The base case results indicate all \ncomponents  are  economically  viable  with  an  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return \nexceeding the assumed economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. Results ranged from \n13.5% to 18.3% for urban roads, 15.2% to 17.5% for flood control and drainage, and 18.1% for \nlandfill. All subprojects were also viable under adverse scenarios wherein costs were higher or \nbenefits lower by 10% than the base case.26 \n \n17.  A financial management assessment confirmed that all implementing agencies have \nsound accounting and financial management capacity. The PMUs have experience in managing \nlarge ODA-funded projects except for the PMU of Buon Ma Thuot, which will require support \nthrough the capacity development component. Based on existing policy, project assets are \nturned over to the provincial urban environmental companies (URENCOs), which will operate \nand maintain the assets.27 The financial soundness of the URENCOs was established. 28 A \nfinancial  sustainability  analysis  was  conducted  for  all  subprojects  by  city  to  confirm  the \navailability of sufficient counterpart funds. Ha Tinh and Buon Ma Thuot have sufficient funds to \ncover the ongoing O&M costs of all its nonrevenue subprojects. Increased funds to support \nO&M  responsibilities  for  the  Quang  Nam  URENCO  are  ensured  through  loan  agreement \nassurances. For the SWM subproject in Buon Ma Thuot, the financial analysis confirmed that \nthe proposed solid waste collection tariffs will be sufficient to cover the O&M cost DAKURENCO \nwill incur.29  \n \nC.  Governance \n18.  The PPCs of Dak Lak, Ha Tinh, and Quang Nam will adhere to the transparency and \naccountability elements of good governance for financial management and fund disbursements. \nThrough their direct participation in undertaking procurement procedures of the ongoing and \nproposed ADB-financed project, the PPCs and PMUs will develop institutional capacity for \ninternational and national competitive bidding for civil works. They will be supported by the \nproposed capacity development component on financial management, fund disbursement, and \nprocurement procedures of ADB and the government.  \n \n                                                \n24  Climate change factors changed from a 1:5 years to a 1:40 years storm event as a minimum standard to comply \nwith targets and standards set by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Ministry of Natural \nResources and Environment. \n25  ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Central Region Urban Environmental Improvement Project. Manila. \n26  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27  The  Ministry of Construction decisions cover guidelines for O&M rates for sanitary landfill, drainage, flood \nprotection, regulating basins, and environmental improvement. The Ministry of Transportation covers O&M for \nroads. \n28  No debt service assumption was reflected in the projections. \n29  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "8   \n19.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the PPCs of Dak Lak, Ha Tinh, and Quang Nam. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n20.  The project is categorized as general intervention benefitting the total populations of the \nthree cities including the poor, women, ethnic, and vulnerable groups. Interventions to reduce \npoverty and promote inclusive development will directly benefit affected groups. The social \nimpacts will be positive, contributing to better living conditions, welfare, and health of the \nbeneficiaries. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy includes measures to address \nsocial impacts and enhance distribution of project benefits.30  \n \n21.  Construction  of  the  flood  management  and  drainage  system  will  protect  the \nbeneficiaries, especially the poor and vulnerable households, from possible losses in assets, \nincome, and livelihood, and resultant health risks from floods and stagnant storm water. The \nengineered landfill and community awareness campaign will improve the SWM practice, to \nincrease the number of households with access to proper waste collection and disposal, in \nturn improving health and sanitation conditions. Road development will improve connectivity \nand help in evacuation during floods. Subprojects will create employment opportunities, during \nconstruction and O&M, for local people, especially the poor and vulnerable groups.   \n \n22.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming, and a gender action plan \nhas been prepared. The gender action plan ensures (i) 50% female participation in decision \nmaking related to planning and design of local urban infrastructure investments; (ii) 35% female \nparticipation in construction supervision boards; (iii) DAKURENCO employing 25% female staff \nin the new SWM facility; (iv) 50% female trainees in training related to SWM, flood protection, \ndisaster risk reduction and management, and road safety; (v) 30% target for training of PMU \nfemale staff on urban planning, environmental management, and financial management and \nprocurement; (vi) 1,100 women from subproject areas are provided vocational training and \ncredit  for  income  generation;  and  (vii)  inclusion  of  sex-disaggregated  data  in  the  project \nperformance management system, monitoring, and evaluation indicators, and regular project \nreporting.31 \n  \nE.  Safeguards \n23.  Environment  (category  B).  Initial  environmental  examinations  pertaining  to  the \nsubprojects were conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and \ngovernment regulations.32 The subprojects will improve environment quality in urban areas \nthrough improved SWM, drainage, storm water management, and area regeneration; and will \nnot cause any irreversible environment impacts. Mitigation measures for identified impacts are \nincluded in the environmental management plan (EMP). Initial costs for implementing the EMPs \nare integrated in the project cost. The EMPs will be updated and finalized at the detailed design \nstage.33 Final EMPs will be cleared by ADB and form part of the contract bidding documents. \nEnvironmental considerations during design and allocation of sufficient O&M budget will help \nmitigate adverse impacts during operation. Environmental monitoring during implementation will \nbe ensured. Endorsements from executing agencies and government environment clearances \n                                                \n30  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32  Initial Environmental Examinations (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Recipient environments for the landfill will be reviewed to ensure that local groundwater is not adversely affected. ", "    9 \nwill  be  obtained  before  contract  award.  The  PMU\u2019s  environment  officer  will  monitor  the \nimplementation of EMPs, and any critical environment matter will be resolved by the provincial \nproject steering committee.    \n \n24.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). Resettlement plans were prepared for each city \nfor the subprojects to address resettlement impacts associated with the land acquisition in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. A total area of 118.24 hectares (ha) will be \nacquired (comprising 23.6 ha in Tam Ky, 31.5 ha in Ha Tinh, and 63.14 ha in Buon Ma Thuot). A \ntotal of 2,417 households (10,737 affected persons) will be affected in the three project cities. A \ntotal of 452 households (2,104 affected persons) will have significant impacts, with loss of more \nthan 10% of their productive land, while 116 households (533 affected persons) will require \nrelocation.  All  other  impacts  are  partial  and  temporary.  The  total  estimated  cost  is \n$22.21 million, including base costs, allowances, and management fee. A project information \nbooklet was distributed to affected persons in February 2013, to be updated and distributed \nduring the detailed measurement survey. A designated social development officer in each PMU \nwill ensure that resettlement plans are implemented.34 \n \n25.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No ethnic minority household is affected in Tam Ky \nand Ha Tinh subprojects. In Buon Ma Thuot, 16.4% of the population belongs to an ethnic \nminority group (mainly Ede) and 42 households (223 affected persons) of that group will be \naffected by loss of agricultural land (18 households affected by urban roads components and \n24 households affected by the landfill site in rural areas). The Ede have lived in this ancient \ncommunity for several generations. In the landfill site, the Ede households live in two separate \nhamlets. However, the surveys assessed that they are well integrated with the Kinh majority. All \n42 households own their agricultural land or are considered legal. The 42 households have the \nsame source and level of income as Kinh and do not require any relocation. The mitigation \nmeasures for land acquisition-related impacts, including income restoration for the 42 affected \nhouseholds,  are  included  in  the  Buon  Ma  Thuot  resettlement  plan.  Hence,  a  separate \nindigenous peoples plan was not required.  \n \n26.  Consultations and disclosure. Resettlement and environment documents, prepared in \nconsultation with stakeholders and local communities, are in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  and  Vietnamese  laws.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  disclosure  policy,  the \ndocuments have been posted on the ADB website. A grievance redress mechanism agreed with \nthe  executing  agencies  will  facilitate  resolution  of  complaints  on  project  performance.  The \nupdated resettlement plans and EMPs will be disclosed after ADB clears detailed design prior to \ncontract award.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n27.  The integrated benefits and impacts of the project are expected to outweigh the costs.   \nKey risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.35  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n34 Resettlement Plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "10   \nTable 5: Summary of Key Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInfrastructure built through the project is damaged by  Detailed engineering design of the proposed flood control \ntyphoons and flooding.  dikes,  road  networks,  sanitary  landfill,  and  other \ncommunity  facilities  will  follow  climate-resilient  design \nstandards and specifications. \nTechnical and administrative capacities of project staff  A specific capacity building component is designed to \nare inadequate for project management and continued  strengthen competencies in integrated urban planning \noperation and maintenance.
