The  IBAs  will  guide  the  new \nboards and management through a major program of operational \nrestructuring, \nimproved  governance  policies, \nprocedures  for  resolving  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs),  and  cost \nreduction.  An  information  technology  (IT)  upgrade  will  support \nthese  new  governance  structures  by  enabling  improved  financial \nreporting  to  management,  the  shareholder,  and  the  supervisory \nauthority  through  more  efficient  and  reliable  processing  of,  and \nreporting on, transactions throughout the nationwide systems. \n \nThe Government is embarking on a broad reform program aimed \nat  macrostability,  improved  financial  management  throughout  the \neconomy,  and  strengthened  private  sector  orientation.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  program  is  supported  by  a  number  of  instruments \nincluding an International Monetary Fund (IMF) poverty reduction \nand  growth  facility  (PRGF),  a  World  Bank  financial  management \nadjustment credit (FMAC) and capacity-building credit. In addition, \na Banking Sector  Reform  Program  Loan  has  been  proposed  for \nconsideration by the Board of Directors of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) in November 2002. The goal of all intensive efforts is \nto reform the SOCBs. \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  to \ncompensate  for  and  strengthen  the  limited  capacity  of  SOCB \nmanagement  and  staff  to  apply  and  enforce  good  commercial \npractice  and  behavior.  The  TA  loan  is  an  integral  part  of  the \nbanking  sector  reform  effort  in  that  it  seeks  to  implement \nprinciples  of  good  governance  throughout  SOCB  operations. \nUnder the TA  loan,  the  consultants  will  support  banking  sector \nreform  by  introducing  sound  commercial  banking  policies  and \nprocedures,  particularly  in  relation  to  the  credit  approval  process \nand  NPL  collection.  On-the-job  experience  coupled  with \nsimultaneous formal and informal training by the IBAs will sustain \nthe impact of the restructuring program. IT upgrades and training \nwill  support  better  control  and  more  efficient  operations  and \nfacilitate a well-implemented restructuring effort. \n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n\fObjectives and Scope  \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\niii \n\nThe TA will foster improvements in governance of the SOCBs and \nin  their  financial  performance  by  introducing  modern  banking \npolicies  and  procedures.  This  objective  will  be  achieved  by  (i) \nresolving  NPLs  through  a  case-by-case  focus  on  cash  recovery \nand legal action; (ii) ensuring that new flows of credit are secured \nby cash flows; (iii) introducing a client-and-business orientation in \nbanking  relationships,  particularly  in  assisting  small  and  medium \nenterprises  (SMEs) \nto  present  bankable  projects;  and  (iv) \nreducing costs through better economies of scale. \n \nThe total cost of the project is $4.83 million equivalent, comprising \nforeign  exchange  costs  of  $3.51  million  and  local  currency  costs \nof $1.32 million equivalent. \n \nThe  proposed  financing  is  for  an  ADB  TA  loan  of  $4  million \nequivalent, including $0.49 million equivalent of the local currency \ncost.  The  Government  will  finance  a  minimum  of  $0.83  million \nequivalent of local currency costs. \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  loan  will  be  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  3.024 \nmillion from ADB's Special Funds resources, with a maturity of 32 \nyears including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. The Borrower will be the Lao PDR.  \n \nUntil 30 June 2006 \n \n31 December 2005 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nA  bank  restructuring  implementation  committee  (BRIC),  chaired \nby  the  deputy  governor  of  Bank  of  Lao  PDR  (BOL),  will  be \nestablished  to  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  TA  loan.  The \nBRIC will include the BOL director and deputy directors who were \nin  charge  of  project  design.  The  BRIC  will  coordinate  with other \nGovernment departments and agencies and with all aid agencies \nparticipating in the banking reform program. A senior official from \nthe  BRIC  will  be  appointed  as  project  director  to  guide  TA \nimplementation. BOL will establish an implementation unit (PIU) to \ncoordinate the day-to-day implementation of the components; and \nwill  provide  adequate  office  space,  secretarial  support, \ninterpreters  and  translators,  other  qualified  local  counterpart  staff \nas needed, and local transportation. \n \nBank of Lao PDR \n \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \n\n\fiv \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nfor  domestic  consultants.  The \n\nIBA.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited \n\nThe  IT  system,  including  training,  will  be  procured  as  a  single \npackage of $0.55 million to ensure compatibility of the customized \nIT  systems  training  for  the  staff.  Procurement  will  be  by \ninternational  competitive  bidding \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement,  or  any  other  procurement  method \nacceptable to ADB. \n \nConsultants  will  provide  240  person-months  of  consulting \nservices: 108 person-months for international consultants and 132 \nperson-months \ninternational \nconsultants  will  have  expertise \nin  bank  management  and \nturnaround,  credit  assessment,  asset/liability  management, \nIT,  and  NPL \naccounting  and  auditing,  human  resources, \nresolution.  The  international  consultants  will  be  four  resident \nbanking  advisors,  each  working  9  months  per  year  for  3  years, \neach  supported  by  local  research  assistants.  The  domestic \nconsultants will be bilingual banking assistants, each assigned to \none \nin \nindividually \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \nThe  principal  benefit  will  be  greater  transparency,  certainty,  and \npredictability  in  commercial  bank  transactions,  particularly  the \ninitiation  of  loans  and  the  enforcement  of  loan  and  security \nobligations.  The  changes  will  foster  a  better  environment  for \ncommercial  transactions  and  will  allow  the  banks  to  attract  a \nstronger  set  of  borrowers.  A  second  benefit  is  support  for \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  poverty  reduction  by  reducing  the \nrisk  of  banking  sector  instability.  The  lower  risk  premium  of \nlending  rates  will  allow  a  greater  range  of  borrowers  to  gain \naccess  to  loan  financing.  Moreover,  reduced  losses  in  SOCB \ncapital  will  enable  the  Government  to  reorient  its  expenditure \nframework  toward  higher  priority  social  expenditures.  Another \nimportant  long-term  benefit  will  be  the  capacity  for  future \ndevelopment  of  the  commercial  system  built  into  the  SOCB \nmanagement and staff.  The  project  beneficiaries  will  include  the \nSOCB management and staff, their potential clients, and the wider \nrange  of  the  population,  including  the  poor,  who  will  benefit  from \ngreater stability and economic growth. \n \nThe  first  risk  is  the  potential  reemergence  of  macroeconomic \ninstability, which would undermine the banking sector reform. This \nmacroeconomic  risk  will  be  minimized \ntightly \nmonitored fiscal and monetary framework under the IMF\u2019s PRGF, \nand the budget and state-owned enterprise reforms supported by \nthe World Bank\u2019s FMAC. \n \n\nthrough \n\nthe \n\n\fv \n\nSecond,  resistance  from  defaulting  borrowers  and  other  former \nbeneficiaries of noncommercial banking activity, particularly in the \nprovinces,  could  erode  the  political  will  to  sustain  the  medium-\nterm  reform  program.  This  risk  is  being  mitigated  by  a  program \ninitiated more than a year ago in which the Government achieved \na  sense  of  ownership  and  facilitated  strong  coordination  among \nthe  international  financial  institutions  (IFIs)  in  dialogue  and \ninstruments.  This  effort  will  continually  strengthen  throughout \nprogram implementation. \n \nThe  third  risk  is  that  restructuring  the  SOCBs  may  result  in \nredundancies  and  this  could  lead  to  resentment  and  grassroots \nresistance. Consultation and awareness building have begun and \nwill  continue  throughout  implementation.  The  Government,  in \nconsultation with the stakeholders and as agreed upon with ADB, \nhas also committed that a mitigation plan will be an integral part of \nthe  restructuring  program  should  the  program  have  adverse \neffects on vulnerable SOCB staff.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  loan  to  the  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for the \nBanking Sector Reform Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nFollowing high inflation and currency depreciation in 1998/99, the Government has been \n2. \nsuccessful  in  stabilizing  the  economy.  In  April  2001,  the  In ternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) \napproved  a  three-year  arrangement  under  a  poverty  reduction  and  growth  facility  (PRGF). \nDuring the first year of the PRGF, inflation remained at around 7% and the economy expanded \nat  5.2%.  However,  stability  is  fragile  and  financial  sector  restructuring  and  reforms  of  state-\nowned enterprises are needed to ensure that problems in the banking sector do not contribute \nto macroeconomic instability. \n \nThe  financial  sector  in  the  Lao  PDR  needs  to  become  considerably  deeper  through \n3. \nimproved  intermediation  and  outreach  to  promote  the  higher  growth  required  for  sustained \npoverty  reduction.  Currently  the  sector  is  dominated  by  three  state-owned commercial banks \n(SOCBs)  which  collectively  account  for  about  70%  of  the  total  assets  of  the  banking  system.1 \nBranches  of  several  foreign  banks  operate  in  Vientiane,  but  deficiencies  in  the  banking \nenvironment, particularly the legal and judicial framework in which they operate, and limitations \non their activities have so far limited their contribution to the domestic economy.  \n \nIn recent years nonperforming loans (NPLs) have risen significantly and other assets of \n4. \nquestionable  quality  have  shown  worrisome  growth.  This  performance  reflects  factors  external \nto  the  banks,  such  as  the  hangover  from  the  macroeconomic  instability  prior  to  2000, \ndeficiencies  in  the  judicial  and  security  system,  and  borrowers  with  limited  capacity  to  present \nbankable  projects.  But  there  are  also  fundamental  institutional  weaknesses,  including  limited \nhuman  resource  capacity,  inadequate  information  technology  (IT),  overstaffing,  inadequate \nattention  to  prudent  risk  management,  and  poorly  functioning  governance  structures  (e.g., \nboards,  committees,  policies  and  procedures).  As  a  result,  losses  in  the  SOCB sector totaled \naround $27 million in 1998-2001.  \n \n5. \nThe Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide financial and \ntechnical  support  for  its  program  to  address  the  policy  environment  for,  and  institutional \nweaknesses  in,  the  banking  and  financial  sector.  A  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \n(PPTA) (i) conducted an operational and financial diagnosis of the SOCBs; (ii) gave additional \ninformation on SOCB classification and reporting of the credit portfolio; (iii) prepared operational \nand financial restructuring plans for the SOCBs, with special emphasis on strengthening credit \nculture through case-by-case NPL resolution; and (iv) proposed a legal and judicial framework \nto  support  good  banking.  The  PPTA  was  completed  in  June,  2002  and  the  Government  has \nprepared  a  program  aimed  at  fostering  efficient  intermediation  of  depositor  resources  and \nensuring a sound banking sector. \n \n6. \nThe  TA  loan  is  a  key  instrument  supporting  Government\u2019s  banking  reform  program.  In \naddition, a proposed banking sector reform program loan has been prepared for consideration \nby the Board. The Government\u2019s program will foster efficient financial intermediation through the \n\n                                                 \n1   The  SOCBs  are  currently  Banque  pour  le  Commerce  Exterieur  [BCEL],  which  has  about  45% of banking sector \nassets; Lane Xang Bank, which holds about 13% of banking sector assets, and Lao May Bank, with about 12%.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ncreation  of  a  sound  banking  sector  capable  of  supporting  private-sector-led  growth  and \nextending  outreach  to  rural  areas.  The  program  would  involve  (i)  introducing  commercial \nprinciples  in  SOCB  operations;  (ii)  adopting  improved  internal  incentives  and  governance \nstructures  in  the  SOCBs;  (iii)  setting  up  a  legal  judicial  and prudential regulation system that \nbrings  failed  borrowers,  strategic  defaulters,  and  unsound  banks  to  account;  (iv)  creating  a \nrange of institutional models and methodologies for extending financial services; and (v) giving \ncreditworthy private sector firms a better access to commercial finance. \n \nUnder the program, the Government will reduce the number of SOCBs from three to two, \n7. \nand modern governance policies and procedures will be introduced to the principal risk areas of \nthe  banks:  credit  approvals,  asset/liability  management,  and  internal  audit.  Operational \nrestructuring will also involve downgrading or disposing of unprofitable branches accompanied \nby  appropriate  deployment  of  the  best  fixed  assets  and  staff,  with  particular  emphasis  on  top \nand middle management.  \n \n8. \nThe  SOCB  restructuring  program  will  require  complex  skills  and  expertise  not  readily \navailable in the Lao PDR. The Government requested a TA loan to support 3 years of work of \ninternational  banking  advisors  (IBAs)  and  an  IT  program  to  assist  SOCBs\u2019  boards  of  directors \nand  management  teams  achieve  their  objectives.  The  TA  loan  forms  an  integral  part  of  the \nreform program by ensuring three key objectives are achieved: (i) implementation of the recently \nreiterated  commercial  mandate  of  the  SOCBs,  (ii)  strengthened  credit  discipline  in  banks  and \nborrowers through a case-by-case approach to NPL resolution, and (iii) a banking sector that is \nmore  responsive  to  the  needs  of  the  private  commercial  sector.  The  project  framework  is in \nAppendix 1. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n9. \nThe  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  foster  improvements  in  the  governance  of  the  SOCBs  by \nintroducing modern banking policies and procedures and reversing the financial performance of \nthe SOCBs. The objective will be achieved by (i) resolving NPLs through a case-by-case focus \non  cash  recovery  and  legal  action;  (ii)  ensuring  that  new  flows  of  credit  are  secured  by  cash \nflows; (iii) introducing a client-and-business orientation in banking relationships, for example by \nassisting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to present bankable projects; and (iv) reducing \ncosts through better economies of scale.  \n  \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n10. \nThe  TA  loan  will  finance  two  resident  IBAs  in  each  of  the  two  remaining SOCBs for 3 \nyears, to build capacity while helping to implement the specific restructuring activities. Detailed \nterms  of  reference  for  the  advisors  are  in  Appendix  2.  To  support  the  implementation  of  new \ngovernance  policies  and  procedures,  the  TA  will  also  finance  IT  systems  that  allow  more \naccurate reporting to management, the shareholder, and the supervisor, and increase efficiency \nand control in processing transactions, particularly for the nationwide branch network. \n \n\n1. \n\nImplementation of Operational Restructuring Modules \n\nThe  SOCBs  will  undergo  full  governance  reform  as  the  centerpiece  of  the  operational \n11. \nrestructuring. The reform will be initiated at the top with the installation of new board chairmen, \nboard members, and management teams willing and able to take on the challenge of managing \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\na restructuring effort while absorbing intensive training required to implement new policies and \nprocedures.  \n \n12. \nThe principles, terms and conditions associated with operational restructuring have been \nagreed upon in advance in memoranda of understanding between the owner represented by the \nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF),  the  Bank  of  the  Lao  PDR  (BOL)  as  regulator,  and  the  SOCB  that \ncommit  all  parties  to  a  specified  program.  Included  are  measurable  targets and goals against \nwhich SOCB performance will be assessed. The Program will be closely supervised and will be \nupdated  annually  on  the  basis  of  current  conditions  and  external  audits  that  (i)  report  on \nperformance indicators, (ii) provide operational audits of key areas, and (iii) provide guidance in \nrevising the following year\u2019s program.  \n \nThe  first  year  of  operational  restructuring  will  focus  on  a  comprehensive  program  to \n13. \nintroduce, implement, and maintain new governance systems including board and management \ncommittees. Initially, there will be stringent interim operational policies2 that are to be gradually \nreplaced  with  full  board-approved  policies  under  the  guidance  of  the  IBAs  covering  the  key \nareas of portfolio management, new credit  extension,  asset/liability  management,  and  internal \naudit. These more effective operational policies and procedures, supported by better systems, \nIT,  and  reporting  methodology  will  be  implemented  throughout  the  SOCBs,  with  special \nemphasis  on  branches.  As  a result, decisions will be more transparent, based on commercial \nprinciples, and accurately recorded. \n \n14. \nIBAs will play a critical role in the restructuring activities.  Their principal duties will be to \n(i)  help  banks  implement  the  governance  reforms,  particularly  the  board-approved operational \npolicies;  (ii)  oversee  improvements  in  systems  and  procedures  to  support  these  policies;  (iii) \nsupport the comprehensive program of NPL resolution; (iv) assist in downsizing the institutions; \nand (v) continuously monitor key activities, particularly credit origination and NPL resolution.  \n \nA  key  aspect  of  the  Government\u2019s  reform  program  is  the  emphasis  on  development  of \n15. \nhuman  resource  capacity  within  the  SOCBs.  The  IBAs  will  play  a  critical  role  in  training  and \ncoaching  the  bank  staff.  The  on-the-job  training  provided  by  the  IBAs  will  complement  and \nreinforce a formal human resource development program involving (i) an effort to match existing \nstaff skills to job requirements; and (ii) tailored training programs, including scholarships based \non the assessed needs in key areas such as accounting, auditing, and IT.3  \n \n16. \nTo strengthen credit discipline for the future, special emphasis will be given to the NPLs. \nA  specific  plan  to  address  these  NPLs  has  been  prepared  and  will  be  implemented  under  the \nguidance of the IBAs. The plan will be based on a case-by-case analysis of each NPL account \nin the portfolio and will include a strategy and detailed implementation procedures, focusing on \ncash collection  and  court  action.  Active  implementation  will  be  facilitated  through  performance \ntargets  on  banks  and  on  the  judiciary,  which  is  being  strengthened  under  a  part  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s program.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2   Interim operational policies will include (i) interim credit policies to fully document and closely monitor any new loan \napprovals  to  curtail  NPLs,  (ii)  interim  portfolio  policies  to  closely  monitor  portfolios  and  accelerate  NPL  cash \ncollection, (iii) interim asset/liability management policies to maximize returns from existing assets, and (iv) interim \ninternal audit policies to establish an internal audit function. \n\n3   A  program  sponsored  by  the  European  Union,  Euro-TAL:Bank Training Program  \u2013 will provide 2 years of formal \ntraining for all SOCB staff and scholarships for exceptional performers. The program will be coordinated with the \nhuman resource module of the restructuring program. \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nUpgrade of Information Technology  \n\n17. \nCurrently all SOCBs in the Lao PDR use the same limited-function back office software \nconsisting of a simple general ledger and chart of accounts system. It was developed locally in \n1997, and is limited and outdated.4 The inability to generate accurate and timely  management \nand  supervisory  information  hinders  any  ability  to  implement  good  oversight  and  control \nfunctions. \n \nHowever, the skill level of IT staff in both BOL and SOCBs is low, and it would be difficult \n18. \nto  introduce  a  complex  international  standard  banking  software  system.  The  TA  loan  will \ntherefore  assist  the  SOCBs  to  implement  an  intermediate-level  software  package  for  the \nbanking system which integrates the front and back offices, provides a low-cost solution and is \naccompanied  by  an  IT  training  program  to  ensure  a  cadre  of  some  20  well-trained  IT  staff \nthroughout BOL and the SOCBs.5  \n \n19. \n \n\nThe scope of the new system will allow SOCBs to \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nimprove customer service levels for current products and services \nexpand a range of products and services as the banks\u2019 develop and mature \ntarget services through more efficient operations \nimprove management information and control processes, and \nmanage cash flows more effectively. \n\n \nC. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  project  is  $4.83  million  equivalent,  comprising  foreign  exchange \n\n20. \ncosts of $3.51 million and local currency costs of $1.32 million equivalent.  \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n21. \nThe proposed financing is for an ADB TA loan of $4.0 million equivalent, including $0.49 \nmillion equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance the balance of $0.83 \nmillion equivalent of local currency costs. The TA loan will be from the Special Funds resources \nwith a maturity of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years. The annual interest charge will \nbe 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The loan will be utilized over a 42-month \nperiod from loan effectiveness. A summary of the costs and the financing plan is in Table 1, and \nthe detailed table of cost estimates and financing plan is in Appendix 3. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n22. \nBOL will be the Executing Agency for the TA loan and will have overall responsibility for \nensuring  timely  project  implementation  and  reporting  to  ADB  on  progress  made,  problems \nencountered,  remedial  actions  taken  during  the  previous  quarter,  and  proposed  activities  and \nthe  next  quarter.  BOL  will  establish  a  bank  restructuring \nexpected  progress  during \n\n                                                 \n4   In particular, there is no real-time interface for transaction input to the back office system. Customer transactions \nare initiated and approved using standard paper documents. The bank staff then manually input the transaction to \nthe back office accounting system for record keeping. \n\n5   Comprehensive training will be organized for the IT staff in BOL and the SOCBs in the course of procurement so \n\nthat their IT skill can be elevated to undertake future support and development of banking system software. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\nimplementation  committee  (BRIC),  chaired  by  the  deputy  governor  of  BOL,  to  oversee \nimplementation  of  the  TA  loan,  and  ensure  that  the  proposed  reforms  and  TA  activities  follow \nthe  agreed-upon  timetable.  In  particular,  the  BRIC  will  meet  quarterly,  establish  performance \ncriteria  with  which  to  monitor  the  performance  of  IBAs,  and  lead  the  annual  tripartite \nperformance  reviews.  A  member  of  the  BRIC  will  be  appointed  as  TA  project  director. \nImplementing  agencies  for  the  TA  loan  will  include  the  SOCBs  and  BOL,  which  will  be \nresponsible  for  effective  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  TA  loan  components.  MOF  will  be \nresponsible for monitoring the use of the loan proceeds. \n \n\nTABLE 1: COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN  \n($\u2019000) \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\n     Subtotal I \n\nI.

BOL  will  provide  adequate  office  space, \nsecretarial  support,  interpreters  and  translators,  other  qualified  local  counterpart  staff  as \nneeded,  and \nthe \nimplementation arrangements. \n \n\ntransportation.  Appendix  4  shows \n\nthe  organization  chart \n\nlocal \n\nfor \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  TA  project  loan  will  start  in  January  2003  and  will  be  implemented  over  a  3-year \n\n24. \nperiod until end-2005. (Appendix 5). \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n25. \nThe IT system, including training, will be procured as a single package of $0.55 million to \nensure  compatibility  of  the  customized  IT  systems  training  for  the  staff.  Procurement  will  be \n\n                                                 \n6   Temporarily,  staff  from  BOL\u2019s  Economic  Research  Department,  with  the  assistance  of  ADB,  are  carrying  out \n\nadvance procurement actions for the IBAs and the IT packages. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nconducted  through  international  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for \nProcurement, or any other procurement method acceptable to ADB. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n26. \nConsultants will provide 240 person-months of consulting services: 108 person-months \nfor international consultants and 132 person-months for domestic consultants. The international \nconsultants  will  have  expertise  in  bank  management  and  turnaround,  credit  assessment, \nasset/liability management, accounting and auditing, human resources, IT, and NPL resolution. \nThe international consultants will be four resident banking advisors, each working 9 months per \nyear for 3 years, each supported by local research assistants. The domestic consultants will be \nbilingual  banking  assistants,  each  assigned  to  one  IBA.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited \nindividually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n27. \nTo  expedite  project  implementation,  the  Government  is  pursuing  advance  action  in \nengaging  consultants.  Selection  is  expected  to  advance  up  to  the  ranking  of  candidates.  The \nGovernment  has  been  informed  that  approval  of  advance  action  does  not in any way commit \nADB to finance the relevant expenditures under the Project or the Project itself. To enhance the \nperformance  of  the  IBAs,  contracts  with  each  individual  will  be  renewed  annually,  subject  to \nsatisfactory  performance  measured  through  regular  comprehensive  tripartite  performance \nreviews. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nEligible expenditures from the loan proceeds will be paid either through direct payment \n28. \nprocedure,  commitment  procedure,  and/or  imprest  fund  procedure  in  accordance  with ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook,  January  2001,  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  Loan \ndisbursements  for  the  consulting  services  contracts  will  make  use  of  the  direct  payment \nprocedure, while IT equipment and software will be procured using the commitment procedure. \nThe  Government  will  establish  an  imprest  account  for  the  PIU  to  manage,  replenish,  and \nliquidate \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  any  detailed \narrangements  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  initial  amount  to  be  advanced  to the \nimprest  account  will  be  based  on  the  estimated  expenditures  for  3  months  or  $20,000, \nwhichever  is  less.  The  ceiling  on  the  imprest  account  will  be  $50,000  and  any  individual \npayment  will  not  exceed  $10,000.  The  account  will  be  established  with  BOL  or  a  reputable \ncommercial bank acceptable to ADB. PIU will be responsible for ensuring proper accounting for \neligible expenditures incurred and paid out from the imprest account. PIU will also ensure that \nADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  followed  when  liquidating  and  replenishing \nthe account. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n29. \nBOL  through  the  PIU  will  submit  quarterly  and  semiannual  progress  reports  to  ADB  to \nprovide  information  on  the  TA  performance  along  with  a  review  of  bank  performance targets. \nThe  performance  of  IBAs  will  be  closely  monitored  and  specifically  covered  in  the  progress \nreports. BOL will ensure that the SOCBs have their accounts audited annually by independent \nand  competent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB,  with  signed  audits  submitted  to  ADB  within  6 \nmonths of the end of the fiscal year. The audited financial statements will be in English and will \ninclude  at  a  minimum  income  and  expenditures,  assets  and  liabilities,  with  the  accompanying \nnotes  to  the  accounts.  BOL  should  also  submit  an  audited  financial  report  annually  within  9 \nmonths of the end of the fiscal year. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n30.  When  submission  of  audited  financial  statements  is  delayed  by  more  than  12  months \nafter the due date, ADB can suspend loan disbursements.  The PIU will submit to ADB, within 3 \nmonths of the Project's physical completion, a project completion report that will give the details \nof project implementation, costs, benefit monitoring and evaluation activities, and other relevant \ninformation. \n \n\n7. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n31. \nThe Government and ADB will closely monitor the implementation of the project through \nongoing  review  of  the  quarterly  and  semiannual  progress  reports  and  regular  loan  review \nmissions.  ADB  monitoring  will  include  ongoing  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  the  overall \neffectiveness  of  the  Program  and  the  TA  loan  in  improving  the  financial  sector.  ADB  will \nregularly  review  the  progress  of  the  proposed  loan  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  quarterly  and \nsemiannual progress reports, participate in the regular reviews, and require agreement on any \nrevisions.  \n \n32. \nADB and the Government jointly will conduct a comprehensive midterm review within 18 \nmonths of the Project\u2019s start. The review will assess Government progress in implementing and \nadherence  to  procurement  arrangements.  From  all  the  assessments,  the  midterm  review  will \nformulate,  within  the  updated  sector  setting  and  other  changing  circumstances,  the  necessary \ncourses  of  action  for  the  Government  and  ADB  to  ensure  successful  implementation  and \neffectiveness in achieving the Project\u2019s objectives.  \n \nThe PIU will submit a detailed implementation plan for monitoring benefits and preparing \n33. \nbenchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness. \nThe project performance monitoring system (PPMS)  will be applied to each project component \nto  ensure  that  project  facilities  are  managed  efficiently  and  benefits  are  realized.  The  PIU  will \ndevelop  a  comprehensive  set  of  indicators  with  a  separate  financed  TA.  The  PIU  will  be \nresponsible for carrying out the PPMS activities, including establishing of benchmarks through \ninitial  surveys,  data  collection,  and  analysis.  Impacts  to  be  measured  are  compliance  with \nprocedures,  enhancement  of  governance  practices,  improved  cost  structures,  and  more \naccurate financial reporting and controls.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n34. \nThe  principal  benefit  of  the  Project  will  be  greater  transparency,  certainty,  and \npredictability  in  commercial  bank  transactions,  particularly  the  initiation  of  loans  and  the \nenforcement of loan and security obligations. Such a change will foster a better environment for \ncommercial transactions and support a stronger set of borrowers.  \n \n35. \nA  second  benefit  is  support  for  macroeconomic  stability  and  poverty  reduction  by \nstrengthening the country\u2019s ability to grow without the attendant risk of banking-sector-instigated \nmacroinstability. The lower risk premium of lending rates will give  a greater range of borrowers \naccess to loan financing. Moreover, reduced SOCB losses will enable the Government to focus \nits  expenditures  on  reducing  poverty.  The  channels  for  poverty  reduction  are  described  in \nAppendix 6. \n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nAnother  important  long-term  benefit  will  be  the  capacity  for  future  development  of  the \n36. \ncommercial  system  built  in  to  the  SOCB  management  and  staff.  The  project  beneficiaries \ninclude  SOCB  management  and  staff,  their  potential  clients,  and  the  wider  range  of  the \npopulation, including the poor, who benefit from greater stability and economic growth. \n \nB. \n\nRisks \n\n37. \nThe  first  risk  is  the  potential  re-emergence  of  macroeconomic  instability,  which  would \nundermine the banking sector reform. These macroeconomic risks are being minimized through \nthe  tightly  monitored  fiscal  and  monetary  framework  under  the  IMF\u2019s  PRGF  supported  by \nbudget and state-owned enterprise reforms supported by the World Bank\u2019s FMAC. \n \nSecond,  resistance  from  defaulting  borrowers  and  other  former  beneficiaries  of \n38. \nnoncommercial  banking  activity,  particularly  in  the  provinces,  could  erode  the  political  will  to \nsustain  the  medium-term  reform  program.  This  risk  is  being  mitigated  by  a  program  initiated \nmore than a year ago in which the Government achieved a sense of ownership and facilitated \nstrong  coordination  among  the  international  financial  institutions  (IFIs)  in  dialogue  and \ninstruments. This effort will continually strengthen throughout program implementation. \n \n39. \nThe third risk is that  restructuring the SOCBs may result in redundancies and this could \nlead to resentment and grassroots resistance. Consultation and awareness building have begun \nand  will  continue  throughout  implementation.  The  Government,  in  consultation  with  the \nstakeholders and as agreed upon with ADB, has also committed that a mitigation plan will be an \nintegral  part  of  the  restructuring  program  should  the  program  have  adverse  effects  on \nvulnerable SOCB staff.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n40.  Within 30 days of loan effectiveness, the  PIU will be established and its project director \nwill have been appointed. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n41. \nI am satisfied that the proposed technical assistance loan would comply with the Articles \nof  Agreement  of  ADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent to Special Drawing Rights 3,024,000 to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the \nBanking Sector Reform Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at \nthe rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter;

The  international  consultants  will  be  two \nsenior international banking advisors (IBAs; 27 person-months each), and two operational IBAs \n(27  person-months  each).  The  domestic  Consultants  (33  person-months  each)  will  be  a  bi-\nlingual  banking  assistants  assigned  to  the  IBAs.  The  IBAs  will  maintain,  as  a  minimum,  the \nsame  working  days  and  hours  as  the  Lao  bankers,  but  should  be  prepared  to  work  on  week-\nends, as needed to carryout their tasks effectively. The IBAs are expected to each spend nine-\nperson months a year. The schedule of residency in Lao PDR will be worked out in a manner \nthat, to the extent possible, there would always be at least an IBA in Vientiane, with the possible \nexception  of  the  year-end  holiday  season.  The  Domestic  Consultants  will  be  in  residence  12 \nmonths a year. Each team of 2 IBAs and 2 domestic consultants will be dedicated to one SOCB. \n \nA. \n\nInternational Consultants  \n\nThe  role  of  IBAs  is  to  support  the  state-owned commercial bank (SOCB) restructuring \n2. \nprogram as outlined in the governance agreement for each SOCB agreed between the Ministry \nof  Finance  (MOF),  the  Bank  of  Lao  PDR  (BOL)  and  the  board  members  and  the  managing \ndirector of each SOCB (both singularly and collectively). While the consultants will have neither \nline-management  responsibilities  nor  any  decision-making  rights,  they  will  have  mandated \nresponsibilities  to  develop  modern  banking  policies  and  implementation  systems  and \nprocedures that will allow Bank management to make commercially oriented banking decisions \nin the best interests of the bank. The governance agreement will be revised annually to reflect \nupdated performance targets and other factors, which may necessitate some minor refinements \nin the consultants\u2019 advisory responsibilities. \n \n3. \nInitially,  the  SOCB  will  be  operating  under  a  restricted  banking  regime,  codified  in  the \nInterim Operational Policies to be adopted on 1 January 2003. The IBAs\u2019 first tasks will be to (a) \nbecome familiar with key BOL regulations; (b) meet with and become familiar with the reporting \nand  performance  requirements  for  the  banks  and  the  BOL  under  the  agreements  entered  into \nby  the  GOL;  (c)  conduct  diagnostics  of  the  Bank,  which  will  build  on  diagnostics  and  audit \nreports  already  prepared;  (d)  put  in  place  procedures  to  ensure  early  compliance  with  the \nInterim  Operational  Policies  and  checklists  to  document  compliance  that  should  enable  the \nBank  to  meet  its  performance  targets;  and  (e)  assist  the  Bank  to  monitor  and  report  on \ncompliance  and  performance  to  BOL.  If  diagnostics  reveal  specific  activities  necessary  to \nachieve  the  performance  targets,  the  consultants  should  recommend  any  required  steps  in \nwriting  to  the  managing  director  and  the  board  members  with  copies  to  BOL,  MOF  and  the \ninternational  financial  institutions  (IFIs).  Once  these  early  diagnostics  are  completed  and  the \ninterim policies are operational, the IBAs will develop a work plan for the remainder of the first \nyear that should encompass obtaining board approved policies for the principal banking areas \nand  development  of  initial  restructuring  and  business plans (RBPs). In the first year, the RBP \nshould  focus  on  operational  improvements,  organizational  and  branch  rationalization,  human \nresource development (HRD) and upgrading, and information technology (IT).   \n \n4. \nIn the initial operational phase, the IBAs will concentrate on stopping loss making activity \nin  two  areas:  the  speed  and  quality  of  resolving  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  and  the  amount \nand quality of new risk activity (on and off balance sheet) under interim operational policies. This \ntask  will  require  the  IBAs  to  recommend  policies,  organizational  structures  and  operational \nsystems, and procedures for a dedicated NPL collection unit. The unit will report monthly on its \nprogress in NPL collections and prepare a number of cases for mediation and court resolution in \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n13 \n\nthe  first  year.  As  part  of  the  HRD  program  all  bank  officers  should  be  required  to  have  some \nexposure to the processes involved in NPL collection. \n \n\n1. \n\nScope of Advisory Services \n\nto \n\nthe  proposed  action  or \n\nrecommendation  and  making  all \n\n5. \nAs  mandated  under  the  governance  agreement,  the  IBAs  are  to  provide commercial \nbank  advisory  services  in  major  areas  of  banking  activities  in  the  Lao  PDR.  This  will  involve \ndeveloping  policies  for  board  approval  and,  providing  the  necessary  policy  implementation \nassistance  in  terms  of  (i)  establishing  the  needed  delegation  of  authority,  (ii)  formulating  the \nrequired systems and procedures, (iii) confirming the assignment of responsibilities, (iv) training \nand  mentoring  in  applying  policies,  and  (v)  monitoring  policy  implementation.  Bank  officer \nresponsibility  will  be  enhanced  by  having  every  officer  acting  on  a  file  or  other  action  to  sign \nthose \nrelative \nactions/recommendations  and  the  full  file  with  signatures  subject  to  review  by  higher  bank \nofficials and ultimately by the board members for decisions requiring board approval. \n \nThe IBAs will work directly with the SOCB, but cooperate fully with the BOL and MOF. A \n6. \nkey  aspect  of  IBAs\u2019  tasks  is  monitoring  key  decision-making areas to ensure compliance with \ncommercial  banking  standards  and  procedures,  particularly  interim  operational  policies  under \nthe restricted banking regime and with an initial focus on loss making activity. Specifically, in the \ncredit  approval  process  relative  to  all  large  loan  proposals,  the  IBAs  will,  prior  to  formal \nconsideration  and  approval  by  the  SOCBs,  review  the  files  to  ascertain  that  the  procedural \naspects of the credit approval process are being fully respected relative to each proposed credit. \nWhen  the  loan  proposal  is  in  full  procedural  compliance  and  meets  sound  commercial \nunderwriting criteria, the IBA will issue a \u201ccompliance certification\u201d finding on the file relative to \nits further processing for approval. The underwriting criteria will include measures and analysis \ndemonstrating adequate cash flow to cover debt service and adequate collateral as a secondary \nsource of repayment. The compliance certification will distinguish clearly between a judgement \nregarding procedural compliance from the assessment of the underwriting criteria. Where there \nare  deficiencies  in  either  procedural  compliance  or  underwriting  criteria,  written  comments  on \nthe shortcoming in each category are to be made available to all relevant parties and included in \nthe  file  for  review  by  management  or  the  board  of  directors,  should  that  loan  proposal  be \nbrought for approval.  \n \n7. \nIn  addition  to  developing,  implementing  and  monitoring  the  application  of  board \napproved  banking  policies,  the  international  consultants  will  develop  and  revise  annually  the \nRBPs  that  will  encompass  (i)  operational  plans,  (ii)  NPL  resolution,  (iii)  organizational  and \nbranch rationalization plans, (iv) HRD plans, (v) fixed asset plans, (vi) technology plans, and (vii) \nfinancial and capital-build up plans.  \n \nThe IBAs will strongly emphasize the training and mentoring aspects of the assistance to \n8. \nmanagement.  On-the-job  training  will  be  complemented  with  formal  course  work  and \nscholarships. It is anticipated that the formal training and scholarships will take place in 2003/04 \nunder the European Union Bank Training Project and the study tour will begin in 2004. \n \n\n2. \n\nQualifications Scope of Advisory Services \n\n9. \nThe  IBAs  should  have  leadership,  technical,  and  coaching  skills,  with  a  demonstrated \nprofessional  track  record  in  banking.  The  IBAs  are  expected  to  be  fully  equipped  with \ndocumented governance policies, systems and procedures obtained from previous experience \nor their affiliated firms. They will adapt these policies, systems, and procedures so as to assist in \n\n\f14 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nattaining  performance  indicators  under  this  governance  agreement.  The  IBAs  will  bring  their \nown computer notebook for the engagement. \n \n10. \n \n\nThe senior IBA should have \n\ni. \n\nii. \niii. \n\niv. \n\nv. \n\nvi. \nvii. \nviii. \n\ni. \n\nii. \niii. \n\niv. \n\nv. \nvi. \nvii. \n\nat least 5 years of varied experience in top or senior management positions in a \nreputable international banks, of which  3 years were spend in an oversight role \nfor  major  banking  functions,  particularly  in  credit  approval  and  asset-liability \nmanagement functions; \nprofessional experience of at least 5 years in emerging economies; \nleadership  skills  including:  (a)  a  clear  vision  of  the  Bank  at  the  end  of  the \nrestructuring  period;  (b)  an  understanding  of  the  key  elements  and  processes \nrequired  for  the  successful  turnaround  of  the  Bank;  and  (c)  the  ability  to \novercome  constraints  posed  by  the  local  environment,  as  well  as  sensitivity to \ncultural and political considerations; \nspecialized  skills  in  several  of  the  major  areas  of  bank  management,  including   \ncredit  risk  management,  asset/liability  management,  international  banking, \nbranch  banking,    operations,  legal  practices,  accounting  or  audit  and  human \nresource management; \ndemonstrated interpersonal skills, with the ability and interest to effectively coach \nLao PDR bank officers; \nappropriate university degree; \nability to interface with high-level officials; and \nexcellent command of written and spoken English. Knowledge of the Lao or Thai \nlanguage would be an advantage. \n\nat least 10 years\u2019 experience in management for reputable international banks, of \nwhich  at  least  3  years  were  as  a  senior  officer  supervising  a  major  functional \narea;  \nprofessional experience, with at least 5 years in emerging economies; \nspecialized  skills  in  several  of  the  major  areas  of  bank  management,  including \ncredit  risk  management,  asset/liability  management,  international  banking, \nbranch  banking,  operations,  legal  practices,  accounting  or  audit  and  human \nresource management;  \ndemonstrated interpersonal skills with the ability and interest to effectively coach \nLao PDR bank officers; \nskills that complement the skills of the senior IBA;  \nappropriate university degree; and \nexcellent command of written and spoken English.  Knowledge of the Lao or Thai \nlanguage would be an advantage. \n\n11. \n \n\nThe operational IBA should have  \n\n3. \n\nCollective Terms of Reference for the IBAs \n\nThe IBAs will work in teams of two, with each team comprising a senior and operational \n12. \nIBA. Collectively, they will assist Bank management to attain the objectives in the governance \nagreement of developing and implementing the Bank\u2019s operational policies and RBPs, thereby \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n15 \n\nturning  the  Bank  around  operationally  and  financially.  They  will  assist  and  advise  Bank \nmanagement  to  develop  and  implement  the  restructuring  business  plans  (RBPs)  relating  to \noperations,  NPL  resolution,  organization  and  branch  rationalization,  human  resource \ndevelopment  (HRD),  fixed  asset  rationalization,  technology  development,  and  financial  and \ncapital build-up. \n \n13. \nThe  IBAs  will  prepare  comprehensive  operational  policies  for  board  approval  in  the \nareas  of  credit,  asset/liability  policies,  portfolio  management,  accounting,  foreign  exchange \ntransactions,  delegation  of  authority,  and  HRD  policies.  Priorities  will  be  policies  necessary  to \nstop  loss  making  activity  (NPL  resolution  and  new  risk  activity,  on  and  off  balance  sheet).   \nAdditional consulting services in areas such as IT, NPLs and HRD policies and training under \nrelated  programs  will  be  available  to  assist  the  IBAs  in  these  tasks  and  will  need  to  be \ncoordinated by the IBAs.  While these comprehensive operational policies are being developed, \nthe  IBAs  will  review,  assist,  and  coach  relative  to  the  implementation  of  the  interim  policies. \nDuring  the  initial  phase  of  Bank  restructuring,  the  IBAs  will  also  develop  the  details  of  the \nturnaround  plans  that  are  integral  parts  of  the  RBPs,  in  close  collaboration  with  Bank \nmanagement.  The  RBPs  are  the  strategies  or  road  maps,  embodied  in  one  single  set  of \ndocuments, which would enable the state-owned  commercial  banks  to  attain  the  objectives  of \nbanking sector restructuring. The turnaround plans are components of the RBPs that will have \nto  be  separately  fleshed  out,  depending  on  the  turnaround  plan.  The  major  elements  of  the \nRBPs will also be subject to the approval of the Boards of the respective Bank, MOF, BOL, and \nIFIs.  During  the  initial  phase,  the  IBAs  will  be  required  to  conduct  bank-wide  training  and \nworkshops to explain the importance of the turnaround plans and the new operational policies, \nand how to effectively implement them. \n \n14.  With respect to the periodic performance targets, the IBAs will assist Bank management \nto  ensure  compliance  and  to  prepare  the  requisite  data  and  the  self-assessment  required. \nSpecifically,  in  the  assessment  of  senior  staff  members,  including  branch  managers  the  IBAs \nwill  provide  the  basic  guidelines  which  will  include  observance  of  the  approved  operational \npolicies, effective implementation of the RBPs and the contribution in meeting the performance \ntargets.  \n \nIn the light of the limited commercial orientation and bank management skills in the Lao \n15. \nbanks,  the  IBAs  will  play  a  pro-active  role  in  actively  advising  in  relation  to  the  business  and \noperations of the Bank. In the process, on-the-job training will be offered and augmented to the \nextent possible through workshops on specialized banking topics and formal training  in related \nprograms  -  accounting  processes  and  financial  reports,  internal  auditing,  and  credit  appraisal \nusing  commercial  criteria.  The  workshops  will  be  extended  to  include  the  Bank\u2019s  corporate \nclients,  especially  relative  to  the  use  of  the  standard  financial  reporting  template  that  will  be \nadopted. The key task of the IBAs is to coach their Lao counterparts in the banks while making \nclear  recommendations  and  identifying  deficiencies  in  operational  procedures.  Assisting  bank \nstaff  to  eliminate  such  deficiencies  is  a  key  role  of  the  IBAs  and  one that best enhances staff \ndevelopment. \n  \n16. \nstandards in all key areas.

According  to  the  most  recently  prepared  estimates  for  1997-98,1  22.1%  of  the  urban  population  and \n42.5% of the rural population (39.1% of the total population) were poor. Since 83.3% of the population resided in rural \nareas in 1997-98,  these  estimates  imply  that  91%  of  the  poor  reside  in  the  rural  areas.  Within  the  rural  areas,  the \npoor reside in relatively remote villages, tend to be illiterate or poorly educated, own or have access to limited land \nand other assets, depend largely on subsistence farming both for employment and as a source of income, and live in \nrelatively large households with relatively high dependency burdens. \n \nRecently prepared poverty estimates suggest that the poor have benefited from rapid economic growth taking place \nbefore the economic crises in 1997. Overall, the poor population declined at an annual rate of 3.1% between 1993 \nand 1998. However, reductions in poverty have been geographically uneven and urban-rural disparities are widening. \nIn  particular,  those  who  live  outside  the  monetized  economy  (i.e.,  most  of  the  rural  poor)  have  not  been  able  to \nparticipate in the benefits of economic growth. The banking sector\u2019s contribution to poverty reduction in Lao PDR. \n \nEstimates suggest that in order for the government to reach its poverty reduction goals, economic growth needs to be \nat least 7%.  A sound financial sector  \u2013 in this case dominated by the state-owned banks \u2013 will be an indispensable \npart of this growth rate, as growth is directly linked to a deepening in the financial sector. Further, the soundness of \nbanks reflects the general confidence level in the system and can provide the needed price and exchange stability for \nthe real economy to expand in a sustainable and broad-based manner.     \n \nThe banking system is also an important channel through which domestic savings are allocated to support the good \nprojects  in  the  private  sector,  particularly  small  and  medium -size  enterprises  (SMEs).  Currently,  many  businesses \nsuffer  from  limited  access  to  commercial  credit,  and  the  development  of  the  private  sector  will  benefit  from  the \nincreased  availability  of  appropriately  priced  financial  products,  which  in  turn,  will  encourage employment creation \nassociated with the expected growth of SMEs. \n \nOn a more fundamental level, an overall effective financial system can provide services that are equally available to \nthe urban and rural population, the financially well-off and the poor.  Expansion of the financial sector, particularly in \nthe  Lao  PDR,  is  a  key  requirement  for  a  more  equitable  distribution  of  the  benefits  from  rising  growth  rates  and  a \nmore robust business sector. Efforts to reach out to all regions and facilitate access to credit on commercial terms will \nbe  critical  to  narrowing  the  gap  in  the  Lao  PDR.  Improving  access  to  financial  services  will  boost  widespread \nproductivity growth and employment creation. \n \nIn  the  Lao  PDR,  there  are  five  main  channels  by  which  banking  sys tem  reform  can  contribute  to  further  poverty \nreduction: \nMacroeconomic stability and economic growth \nFiscal space \nDistribution of income and wealth \nEmployment creation \nExtension of sustainable financial services  \n1   Nanak Kakwani, Gaurav Datt, Bounthavy Siousphanhthong, Phonesaly Souksavath, and Limin Wang. 2002. \n\n\u201cPoverty in Lao PDR During the 1990s,\u201d Revised May 31,2002.

Further, given the current lack of investments in areas such as rural infrastructure, education, and \nhealth, improvement in bank performance frees fiscal resources to provide a much-needed boost in the social portion \nof the budget. Lastly, increased confidence in the banking system and enhanced macrostability can be expected to \nlead,  in  turn,  to  a  lower  risk  premium  on  domestic  financial  assets  (lowering  the  costs  of  borrowing),  increased \ndomestic  savings,  increased  foreign  investment,  significantly  diminished  pressures  on  the  Lao  currency  and  a \nreduced risk of a fiscal and monetary crisis. \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nreduced risk of a fiscal and monetary crisis. \nImpact on access of the poor to finance \nWhile the poor may not benefit directly from this loan component in the short term, they are likely to receive indirect \nbenefits as a result of higher rates of economic growth, which should lead to increased employment.  In the medium \nterm, with lower costs of financial services and price levels, the poor\u2019s access to credit and asset accumulation will \nalso improve.   \nImpact on rural areas  \nAlong with the inaccessibility to credit to the poor, there is also a significant urban/rural divide.  Because the current \nbanking system is inefficient and biased toward urban areas , it creates substantial obstacles for the development of \nrural  finance.  Reform  in  the  banking  system  may  increase  the  supply  of  credit  to  rural  households.  The  program\u2019s \nobjective  is,  among  others,  to  develop  a  more  diversified  and  commercial-oriented  rural credit system.
