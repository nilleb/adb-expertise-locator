The  Lao  PDR  has  made  notable  achievements  in  health \n3. \noutcomes  since  the  1990s.  However,  significant  challenges  remain  to  meet  key  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goal  (MDG)  targets.  The  maternal  mortality  ratio  (MMR)  decreased  from  405 \nmaternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1995 to an MMR of 357, still well short of the MDG \nMMR target of 260. The infant mortality rate has fallen to 68 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2012 \ncompared with the MDG target of 45 deaths per 1,000 live births. The child mortality rate (under \n5 years) was 79 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2012, while the MDG target is 70. Only 37% of \npregnant  mothers  have  adequate  anti-natal  care  (four  visits  to  a  health  practitioner  prior  to \nbirth). Further, only 41.5% of mothers have a skilled birth attendant at birth, and 37.5% have an \ninstitution-based delivery.3 \n \n4. \nLao PDR\u2019s challenge in achieving its MDG targets in health arises because utilization of \nhealth services in the Lao PDR is relatively low; ambulatory care visits per capita per year have \nbeen below 1 in most areas of the country. Poor utilization of health services is due in part to the \npoor quality  of  health facilities,  lack of  staff,  and  low  operational  budget for  outreach  services. \nHigh  user  fees,  including  the  cost  of  pharmaceuticals,  constitute  another  major  barrier \npreventing  the  poor,  mothers  and  children  from  accessing  health  services.  Fiscal  year  (FY) \n2012  national  health  accounts  (NHAs)  report  that  out-of-pocket  expenses  constitute  44.5%  of \ntotal health expenditures, amounting to $35.5 per capita.4 \n \nBinding  constraints. The key binding constraints to improving utilization and quality of \n5. \nhealth  services  relate  to  insufficient  funding  of  healthcare  facilities,  which  in  turn  impedes \naccess to healthcare facilities by the poor; weak public financial management in the healthcare \nsector  (budget  planning,  execution,  and  reporting);  and  weak  human  resources  in  the  sector.  \nFor  example,  while  the  number  of  health  workers  increased  significantly  in  2013\u20132014,  but \nprimary  health  care  facilities  often  lack  health  staff.  In  2013,  33%  of  health  centers  had  a \ncommunity midwife (compared with a target of 100%), and 90% of health centers had less than \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The World Health Organization (WHO) defines UHC as \u201censuring that all people can use the promotive, preventive, \ncurative,  rehabilitative,  and  palliative  health  services  they  need,  of  sufficient  quality  to  be  effective,  while  also \nensuring that the use of these services does not expose the user to financial hardship.\u201d WHO.

There  is  no  functioning \nregulatory  system  for  licensing  and  registration  of  health  professionals.  Private  sector  health \ncare providers are concentrated in Vientiane and other major cities, and provide health services \nfor the higher-income segment of the population. The regulation of the private health providers \nneeds  to  be  strengthened.  Furthermore,  while  the  planning  and  budgeting  capacity  of  the \nMinistry  of  Health  (MOH)  has  improved,  the  linkage  between  health  service  performance  and \nbudget  allocation  remains  weak.  Financial  management  systems  do  not  capture  the  revenues \ngenerated  by  the  sale of  medicines  and fees for services,  which constitute about  50%  of  total \nrevenues  in  health  facilities  (footnote  4).  The  development  budget,  including  all  budgets  from \naid-financed projects, is not disaggregated, and there is no institutionalized system of NHAs.5 \n \n6. \nGovernment\u2019s  sector  strategy.  Since  2000,  the  government  has  introduced  policies \nand  strategies  to  guide  health  sector  reforms  aimed  at  achieving  the  MDGs,  improving  health \nfinancing  and  systems,  setting  standards,  and  strengthening  health  sector  coordination.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  Seventh  National  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015  reflects  its \ncommitment  to  improve  human  development  outcomes.  To  address  key  health  sector \nconstraints,  in  2013  the  National  Assembly  approved  the  HSRS,  which  aims  to  provide \naffordable,  reliable,  and  accessible  health  services  for  all.  A  key  objective  of  the  HSRS  is  to \nimprove (i) social protection for the poor, mothers, and children; and (ii) health service delivery. \nHSRS  has  identified  a  range  of  key  governance,  public  sector  management,  and  health \nprogram reforms to improve the performance and coverage of the health sector. It includes five \npriority  areas:  (i)  health  human  resources  development;  (ii)  health  financing;  (iii)  organization \nand  management;  (iv)  service  delivery,  with  an  emphasis  on  maternal  and  child  care;  and  (v) \ninformation,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  The  objectives for  2025  UHC  include  (i)  skilled  health \nworkers deployed in all health facilities according to needs, (ii) out of pocket expenses amount \nto less than 40% of total health expenditures, (iii) performance-based funding mechanisms are \nintroduced, and (iv) health care quality assurance is introduced in all health facilities. \n \n7. \nThe  National  Assembly  has  committed  to  a  target  of  9%  of  general  government \nexpenditure  for  health.  Expenditure  for  health  increased  to  7.5%  of  total  government \nexpenditure  in  FY2013,  from  3%  in  FY2012;  subsequently,  the  budget  has  fallen  to  an \nestimated  7%  in  FY2015.  Critically,  non-salary  recurrent  budgets  at  the  provincial  level  have \ngrown substantially (by a factor of 5\u20136) since FY2011. However, the system remains generally \nunderfunded.  External  development  assistance  accounted  for  35%  of  the  total  health \nexpenditures in FY2014. \n \n8. \nTo make health services accessible to the poor, the government has  introduced Health \nEquity Fund (HEF) schemes across the country.6 HEF is a social protection scheme, targeting \nthe  poor  as  identified  by  village  and  district  authorities.  In  2014,  the  HEF  schemes  covered \n46,870 poor families, or about 45% of all poor households.7 The government uses the revenues \ngenerated  by  major  hydroelectric  investments  to  finance  the  social  protection  schemes,  in \nconjunction with development partners. The government has also implemented a free maternal, \nneonatal,  and  child  health  care  (MNCH)  scheme,  financed  by  a  combination  of  government \nrevenues  and  external  assistance.  However,  the  implementation,  financial  management,  and \n\n                                                \n5  NHAs describe the sources, uses, and channels for both public and private funds used in the health sector and are \n\nessential to optimize allocation and mobilization of health sector resources. \n\n6  The HEF, established in 2007, provides free public health care services for the poor by removing major barriers to \nhealth facility and/or health service access, such as transportation, the cost of pharmaceuticals, and other health \ncare costs paid by those seeking care. \n\n7  Ministry of Health. 2014. Summary Report on Implementation of Health Activities. Vientiane. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fmonitoring  mechanisms  for  these  schemes  differ,  depending  on  the  funding  source.  The \ngovernment  has  established  common  rules,  procedures,  and  management  systems  for  the \nschemes  to  harmonize  their  implementation.  It  has  created  the  National  Health  Insurance \nBureau, which manages and coordinates the existing health insurance programs, HEF, and free \nMNCH. The government will progressively increase the number of beneficiaries of social health \nprotection  schemes  and  health  insurance  programs,  which  is  the  first  step  in  moving  towards \nproviding health insurance to 80% of the population, one of the targets of the HSRS. \n \n9. \nAsian  Development  Bank  value  added  in  health  sector.  The midterm  review  of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2020 recommends expanding operations in the health \nsector to 3%\u20135% of ADB\u2019s annual approvals.8 ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016, \nfor  the  Lao  PDR  includes  support  to  public  financial  management  in  the  health  sector.9 The \nprogram  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2015\u20132017  for  the  Lao  PDR, \nand  is  aligned  with  the  operational  plan  for  health,  2015\u20132020.10 ADB  has  supported  health \nsystem  development  through  several  TA  projects  and  programs  focusing  on  governance  and \npublic  financial  management. 11  Previous  ADB  health  projects  and  programs  focused  on \ninfrastructure and staff capacity development in selected provinces, and helped to improve the \nhealth  facility  network  and  access  to  health  services  in  these  areas.  Those  interventions \ncontributed  to  (i)  establishing  health  service  standards,  (ii)  provincial  planning  and  budgeting, \n(iii) increasing the recurrent budget, (iv) human resource development, (v) MNCH policies, and \n(vi) financial management; ADB also has supported the HSRS through policy advisory TA that \nhelped MOH develop a draft plan to implement health sector reforms.12 \n \n10. \nLessons.  Lessons  from  ADB  engagement  show  the  need  for  the  government  and \ndevelopment partners to develop and jointly finance national programs that focus on key health \nsystem constraints, rather than focusing on stand-alone projects. The design of the program will \nbuild on this previous work, informed by considerations of (i) alignment with government public \nsector  management  and  health  system  reform  priorities,  and  (ii)  support  to  sustain  ADB \nengagement on public sector management. \n \n11. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  Major  development  partners  in  the  health  sector \nare  the  Global  Fund  for  Malaria,  AIDS,  and Tuberculosis,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency,  the  Luxembourg  Development  Agency,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  World  Health \nOrganization.  The  World  Bank  will  support  the  HSRS  through  its  Health,  Governance,  and \nNutrition  Development  Program,  a  $13.2  million  credit  and  $13.2  million  grant  in  the  form  of \nparallel collaborative cofinancing, not administered by ADB.13 It will coordinate with the program \nand  will  focus  on  health  service  delivery,  including  (i)  strengthening  the  district  health \n\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2014.

The  program  is  part  of  ADB\u2019s \nconsolidated support to the Lao PDR to help overcome major developmental challenges in the \nhealth  sector  and  to  lift  health  performance  indicators  as  specified  by  the  key  MDGs  targets. \nThe use of a programmatic approach with a policy-based loan providing budget support and a \nTA  loan  for  capacity  development  included  in  subprogram  1  leverages  a  longer  term  policy \nreform  program  in  the  health  sector  at  the  national  and  subnational  levels.  The  programmatic \napproach comprises two subprograms that facilitate a concerted policy dialogue on the basis of \nan  agreed  policy  matrix  related  to  key  health  governance  reforms  and  sector  priorities.  It  will \nprovide  more  effective  and  flexible  ways  to  translate  complex  structural  reform  objectives  into \nimplementable  policy  actions.  The  program  will  improve  the  targeting  accuracy  and  the \ncoverage  of  poor  families  benefitting  from  the  HEF  scheme,  increase  the  number  of \nbeneficiaries of the free MNCH scheme, and improve the financial management of the schemes \nto ensure value for money. The program focuses on chronologically sequenced reforms in line \nwith  the  HSRS  implementation  plan,  which  includes  reforms  to  improve  health-related  human \nresource  management  and  overall  public  financial  management  of  the  health  sector.  The \nprogram  achieves  important  socio-economic  impacts.  The  first  is  the  improvement  in  poor \nfamilies access to healthcare through increased HEF scheme coverage. Second, improvement \nin public financial management will lead to gains from allocative efficiency. Third, improvement \nin  human  resources  management  will  lead  to  better  quality  of  health  services.  This  should \ndirectly contribute to improve health outcomes. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe  impact  will  be  UHC  achieved  by  2025.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  delivery  of \nhealth services, particularly for the poor, women, and children. Subprogram 1 contains 15 policy \nactions  of  which  eight  are  triggers,  all  of  which  have  been  accomplished.  Subprogram  2  will \ncontinue  and  deepen  reforms  and  contain  17  policy  actions  of  which  11  are  triggers,  to  be \ncompleted by July 2018. \n \nC. \n \n14. \nOutput  1:  Health  sector  reform  process  improved.  Under  subprogram  1,  the \ngovernment has established the National Commission on Health Sector Reform chaired by the \nvice-prime  minister.  The  commission  will  oversee  reform  progress  and  remove  or  resolve  any \nimpediments to sustained implementation of reforms. The MOH has prepared a draft road map \nfor  HSRS  implementation  that  details  the  key  governance  and  public  sector  management \nreforms  required \nfinancial \nmanagement.  The  draft  road  map  also  sets  out  the  TA  and  capacity  development  needed  to \ndesign and implement the health reforms. \n \n15. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  ensure  that  the  National  Commission  on \nHealth  Sector  Reform  is  fully  resourced  and  continues  to  oversee  and  monitor  HSRS \nimplementation.  The  commission  will  approve  and  subsequently  monitor  annual  HSRS \nimplementation plans. The commission will approve the draft reform road map for strengthening \nhealth  human  resources  and  health  system  financial  management  and  establish  reform \nmonitoring mechanisms for 2015\u20132025. \n\nto  strengthen  health  human  resource  and  health  system \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n14 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f16. \nOutput  2:  Implementation  of  the  Health  Equity  Fund  and  free  maternal,  neonatal, \nand  child  health  care  schemes  improved.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government  has \nexpanded  the  number  of  beneficiaries  of  HEF  and  free  MNCH.  By  2014,  the  HEF  scheme \ncovers  43%  of  poor  families.  The  free  MNCH  scheme  had  been  initiated  in  88  districts  for \nmaternal  care  (out  of  a  total  of  146  districts).  The  MOH  has  harmonized  the  implementation \nguidelines  for  these  social  protection  schemes.  The  National  Health  Insurance  Bureau  (under \nthe MOH Department of Finance) will administer, coordinate, and develop the existing insurance \nprogram and social health protection schemes. \n \nUnder subprogram 2, the government will further implement these critical service delivery \n17. \nreforms  and  ensure  their  sustainability.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  mobilize  additional \nresources (government and official development assistance) to  expand provision of free MNCH \nand HEF across the country. The target is that free MNCH services and HEF will be implemented \nin  at least 131 districts by June 2018; by  June 2019, HEF  will  cover  80% of poor families. The \nMOH  will  also  undertake  an  impact  assessment  of  the  coverage,  benefits,  utilization,  financial \nmanagement,  and  provider-payment  mechanism  of  the  two  social  protection  schemes  after  2 \nyears of program operation. The MOH will revise their implementation guidelines by July 2018 as \nappropriate. \n \n18. \nOutput 3: Human resource management capacity strengthened. Under subprogram \n1,  in  2014  the  government  increased  the  health  workforce  by  4,000  staff.  The  MOH  has \nimplemented  a  computerized  provincial  health  personnel  information  system  for  better  human \nresources management and  planning. In recognition  of the  need for  improved regulation  of the \nhealth work force, the MOH has developed a competency framework for medical professions. \n \n19. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  (i)  improve  the  accuracy  and  enhance  the \ncapacity of the personnel information system with respect to information on training, gender, and \nethnicity;  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  PHOs  to  use  the  information  for  management \ndecision  making.  Each  PHO  will  formulate  and  implement  provincial  workforce  development \nplans designed to guide the training and deployment of staff in remote and hard-to-reach areas. \nIn  addition,  the  government,  through  the  MOH,  will  issue  appropriate  decree(s)  defining  (i)  a \nlicensing  and  registration  process  for  health  professionals,  including  private  sector  health \nproviders; and (ii) requirements for maintaining registration and accreditation. \n \n20. \nOutput  4:  Health  sector  financial  management  system  strengthened.  Under \nsubprogram  1,  the  MOH  has  developed  staff  capacity  to  adopt  multiyear  budgeting  and  a \nmultiyear  budget  framework  in  preparation  for  implementation  across  the  health  sector.  The \nMOH  has  issued  implementation  guidelines  for  Prime  Minister  Decree  349  that  regulates  use \nand accounting of health facility user fees. To improve information on mobilization and allocation \nof  financial  resources  to  the  health  sector,  the  MOH  has  produced  and  published  NHAs  for \nFY2011 and FY2012. To ensure timely and adequate allocation of funds to the PHOs and MOH \ndepartments, the MOF and the MOH are establishing a mechanism for adequate allocation and \ntimely funding of free MNCH and HEF schemes, and of health service delivery. \n \nFor subprogram 2, the government, through the MOH, will adopt a system to monitor the \n21. \nsource and application  of funds at the health facility  level; implementation  will  initially focus on \ndistrict  and  provincial  hospitals.  The  MOH  will  also  establish  a  budget  expenditure  and \ndisbursement  monitoring  system \nto  document  annual  and  quarterly  expenditures  and \ndisbursement  of  provincial  and  central-level  health  department  budgets.  To  improve  decision \nmaking  and  transparency,  the  MOH  will  establish  a  new  system  for  budgeting  and  monitoring \ndevelopment  budget  expenditures,  including  for  all  aid-financed  projects.  The  MOH  will  also \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment Financing Needs \n\ninstitutionalize the production, publication, and distribution of NHAs for FY2013 and FY2014. \n \nD. \n \n22. \nTo  support  its  reform  initiatives,  the  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR12,204,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources to  help finance \nsubprogram  1.  The  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an \ninterest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \n23. \nThe  loan  amount  for  subprogram  1  takes  into  account  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  increased  fiscal \nspace  constraints  and  financing  needs  for  development  expenditure  programs.15   The  size  of \nthe  loan  is  based  on  the  costs  incurred  by  the  government  in  implementing  reforms.  The \ngovernment will use the local currency counterpart funds generated from this policy-based loan \nto support full implementation of the policy actions contained in the policy matrix and to ensure \nsustainability  of  the  health  reforms,  with  a  focus  on  public  financing  for  HEF  and  free  MNCH \nschemes,  health  human  resource  management,  and  financial  management  improvements.16 \nPara.  28  summarizes  expected  costs  and  benefits  of  the  reforms,  and  the  program  impact \nassessment provides details. 17 \n \nE. \n \nThe  executing  agency  for  the  program  will  be  the  MOH,  Department  of  Planning  and \n24. \nInternational  Cooperation,  which  will  be  responsible \nthe  overall  coordination  and \ndisbursement  of  resources  under  the  programmatic  approach.  The  MOH  departments  of \nFinance, Training and Research, and Personnel, and the 18 provincial health departments will \nbe  the  implementing  agencies.  As  the  executing  agency,  the  MOH  will  be  responsible  for  the \noverall  implementation  of  subprogram  1  including  disbursements,  maintenance  of  all  program \nrecords,  and  communicating  with  ADB  on  behalf  of  the  government.  The  MOH  steering \ncommittee, chaired by the minister of health and comprising vice ministers and representatives \nof  MOH  departments  including  the  cabinet  (which  is  responsible for  oversight  of  health  sector \nreform implementation) will provide overall guidance on program implementation. \n \n25. \nfor \nsubprogram  1  will  be  provided  in  a  single  tranche  and  the  proceeds  may  be  withdrawn  upon \nloan  effectiveness.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nsimplified disbursement procedures for policy-based loans.18 The loan proceeds will be used to \nfinance the foreign  exchange  cost  of  items  produced and  procured  in ADB  member  countries, \nexcluding items included in a list of ineligible items, and imports financed by other bilateral and \nmultilateral  sources.19 The  implementation  period  of  subprogram  1  is  August  2013\u2013July  2015. \nThe loan closing date is 31 March 2016.

There  should  be  significant  gains  through  improved  allocative  efficiency,  and \nincreased government budget allocations to health that are expected to provide higher rates of \nsocioeconomic  return  than  most  other  potential  uses  of  budgetary  resources.  The  potential \nbenefits  include (i)  removal  of financial  barriers to health service access as a consequence  of \nnational implementation of the HEF and MNCH  schemes; and (ii) improved quality of services \nresulting from (a) better distribution of key staff through the health system; and (b) an improved \nnonsalary budget, which will enable improved outreach and better-quality facilities to support the \nhealth services provided. The policy costs to the government are conservatively estimated as a \nlump  sum  of  $141  million.  The  costs  of  the  reforms  estimated  are  primarily  (i)  the  short  to \nmedium-term costs to the government of administering and enforcing reforms ($12 million); and \n(ii)  the  direct  fiscal  costs  of  selected  reforms,  including  the  costs  of  service  delivery  reforms \nimplementation, in concert with governance and public sector management reforms designed to \nensure improved service delivery ($129 million).22 \n                                                \n21 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Including the expansion of the workforce by 4,000 ($60 million), additional administrative staff in the provinces ($3 \nmillion),  implementation  of  free  MNCH  and  HEF  schemes  ($33  million),  and  sustained,  improved  service  quality \n($33 million). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fthe \n\nGovernance \n\nimproving  budgetary  management;  (ii)  strengthened \n\nB. \n \n29. \nThe overall assessment of fiduciary risk, including for the health sector in the Lao PDR, \nhas  been  assessed  as  high  to  medium,  due  mainly  to  (i)  insufficient  control  over  revenue \ncollected  and  expenditures  undertaken  by  provincial  governments;  (ii)  inadequate  resources \nindependence  and \nand  capacity  of  state  audit  organizations,  which  undermines \neffectiveness  of  oversight  institutions;  (iii)  a  weak  procurement  framework,  and  lack  of \nregulations  for  implementation;  (iv)  corruption  (the  United  Nations  Convention  Against \nCorruption is insufficient as a deterrent); and (v) lack of effectiveness of the Inspection Authority. \nTo  address  these  risks,  the  government  has  (i)  set  out  the  law,  implementing  decree, \nframework,  and  timetable  for \nthe \nindependence  and  capacity  of  the  state  audit  organization;  (iii)  issued  a  new  procurement \ndecree and implementing rules and regulations, a standard procurement manual, and standard \nbidding documents; and (iv) adopted the Law on Anti-Corruption, Law on State Inspection, and \nLaw  on  Complaints  and  State  Audit.  The  TA  loan  will  provide  support  for  the  introduction  and \ndevelopment  of  results-based  planning,  budgeting,  financial  management  systems,  reporting, \nand verification as part of health sector reform at national and subnational levels. \n \n30. \nThe  ADB  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  government  and  the  MOH,  who  are  familiar  with  it.  The  government  Anti-\nCorruption  Unit  has  made  some  progress  but  faces  challenges  with  regard  to  operational \neffectiveness,  carrying  out  anticorruption  activities,  and  implementing  the  Anti-Corruption  Law \nsystematically.  The program will support specific human resource and planning, budgeting, and \nexpenditure-monitoring  reforms  that  will  improve  information  and  the  transparency  of  finance \nand human resource allocations within the health sector. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nC. \n \n31. \nThe reforms supported by the  program are expected to lower the incidence of poverty, \nparticularly among women and children, by expanding the provision of free health services for \nthe  poor  and  free  MNCH  services.  In  addition,  financial  and  human  resource  management \nreforms  will  increase  deployment  of  health  staff  to  remote  areas  with  the  greatest  needs  in \nsupport  of  quality  service  delivery.  The  program  will  support  gender  and  equity  policies  to  (i) \nensure access by poor women to the HEF, and (ii) promote recruitment and retention of female \nand ethnic group staff in remote and disadvantaged rural areas. It is classified as gender equity. \n \nD. \n \n32. \nThe program is expected to have no environmental impact and will not include new land \nacquisition.  Therefore,  it  is  classified  category  C  for  environment  and  involuntary  resettlement \nsafeguards.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  to  screen  program  activities  that \nwould  cause  involuntary  resettlement  impacts,  including  temporary  land  acquisition  and/or \neconomic  displacement  of  people.  Similarly,  an  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework  includes  a  checklist  to  exclude  activities  with  negative  environment  impacts.  The \nprogram includes positive impacts on ethnic groups and is classified category B for indigenous \npeoples. An indigenous peoples planning framework ensures that (i) ethnic peoples\u2019 needs will \nbe analyzed, and (ii) ethnic peoples will fully participate in the project and have equal access to \nits  benefits.  A  matrix  of  the  potential  impacts  of  each  policy  action  on  indigenous  people, \ntogether with appropriate mitigation measures, has been prepared. \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nSafeguards \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nE. \n \n33. \nThe risk for subprogram 1 is assessed as medium. Major risks include macroeconomic \nimbalances, poor public financial management and accountability mechanisms, limited capacity \nfor public procurement, and corruption. Responsibilities of MOH departments and the PHOs are \noverlapping and MOH has limited capacity to implement the reforms at all levels.  The capacity \nwithin  the  MOF  and  sector  ministries  to  prepare  budgets  is  not  yet  fully  developed,  and  the \nbudget\u2013policy  linkage  is  weak.  The  MOH,  and  the  government  more  generally,  have  shown \nsignificant  commitment  to health sector  reform through the  development  of the  HSRS  and the \nprogram. An ADB-funded project supports the MOF and other line ministries in budget planning \nand in improving the intergovernmental fiscal transfer systems. The program will strengthen key \npublic  finance  management  systems  within  MOH,  including  planning  and  budgeting.  The \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs of the program. Major risks \nand  mitigating  measures  are  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management \nplan.23  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n34. \nThe  government  and the  MOH  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and the loan agreements. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n35. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  loans  would  comply  with \nthe  Articles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the \nBoard approve \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nthe programmatic approach for the Health Sector Governance Program; \nthe  policy-based  loan  in  various currencies equivalent  to SDR12,204,000  to  the \nLao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Health  Sector \nGovernance  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest \ncharge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum thereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; and \nthe  technical  assistance  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR4,307,000 \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for subprogram 1 of the Health  Sector \nGovernance  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest \ncharge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n\n(iii) \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n                                                \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n25 August 2015 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nImpact the Health Sector Governance Program is aligned with: \n \nUniversal health coverage achieved by 2025 (Health Sector Reform Strategy)a \n\n \n \nResults Chain \nOutcome \nHealth service delivery, \nparticularly for the poor, \nwomen, and children, \nimproved \n\n \n\nPerformance Indicators \nwith Targets and Baselines \n \na.
