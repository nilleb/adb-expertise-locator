An initial environmental examination was undertaken. \nAssessment \n   \nProject Description  The Project follows a sector lending approach and supports sector \npolicies on urban development, including the Government\u2019s Action \nPlan for 2004\u20132008 and program to provide 40,000 households \nwith opportunities to live in housing with improved basic services. \nThe Project will consist of four components: (i) A: improvement of \nbasic urban services, (ii) B: urban road improvement, (iii) C: small \nloans for water connections and on-plot facility improvements, and \n(iv) D: institutional development and training. \n \nProject  implementation  will  start  with  two  core  subprojects: \n(i) improvement of the Hailaast road section in Ulaanbaatar; and \n(ii)  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management  in \nErdenet.  The  remaining  subprojects  will  be  identified  and \nformulated  during  project  implementation  in  accordance  with \nrigorous  procedures  for  screening,  identification,  selection,  and \nappraisal of the subprojects. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nreviewed the two core subprojects and found that they are viable \nfrom  a  technical,  institutional,  social,  financial,  economic,  and \nenvironmental perspective. For each of the remaining subprojects, \nthe  Ulaanbaatar  municipal  government  and  concerned  aimag \n(province) governments and public urban services organizations \n(PUSOs) will prepare a feasibility study, including a resettlement \nplan and environmental impact assessment. For the water supply \nsubcomponent, concerned aimag governments will be required to \nindicate strong political commitment to implement the tariff reforms \nto ensure repayment to the Government.  \n   \nRationale  Mongolia experienced rapid urbanization during the second half of \nthe 20th century, mainly because of rural-to-urban migration. The \nurban  population  is  now  60%  of  the  national  population  of \n2.56 million. Urban areas in Mongolia present two very different \nand  distinct  patterns  of  residential  accommodation:  apartment \nareas and ger (traditional tent) areas. Apartment areas are formally \nlaid out to include permanent housing based on socialist planning \n ", "vi \npractices  and  featuring  multi-family  housing  surrounded  by \n(vaguely defined) open space. These areas have the benefit of full \nutility services, including heating and hot water. By contrast, ger \nareas are typically long strips of large, unserviced plots with wide \nunpaved roads on one or two sides. Both types of layout are found \nin virtually all of the country\u2019s urban settlements. Following the \nwithdrawal of Soviet support at the start of the 1990s, there has \nbeen relatively little extension of apartment areas but ger areas \nhave  experienced  continued  growth  in  most  cities  as  most  in-\nmigrants live in ger areas. \n \nUrban  areas  in  Ulaanbaatar  are  growing  rapidly  because  of \nsubstantial  population  migration  from  rural  areas.  The  total \npopulation in Ulaanbaatar is estimated at over 1 million, including \nabout 80,000 students and 60,000 non-registered residents. Some \n60%  of  the  total  population  lives  in  ger  areas.  In  2004, \nUlaanbaatar\u2019s  road  network  totaled  about  376  kilometers  (km), \ncomprising 77 km (20.5%) of national roads, 190 km (50.5%) of \ncity roads, and 109 km (29.0%) of district or municipal roads. Road \nconstruction has been increasing slowly by 1.2% per annum for the \npast 5 years. Most roads in Ulaanbaatar are poorly maintained \nasphalt or gravel roads. About 288 km of roads in the city need to \nbe reconstructed or rehabilitated. Only 10% of the city roads have \ndrainage systems, which often are clogged with trash. \n \nThe major issues in the urban development sector in Mongolia are \n(i) deficiency in the quality of urban infrastructure and services, \nespecially in ger areas; (ii) lack of community participation in the \nmanagement and operation of urban services; (iii) lack of cost \nrecovery and inadequate financial management in public services; \n(iv) lack of financial and organizational autonomy of the PUSOs; \n(v) lack of capacity of local governments, through the PUSOs, to \nprovide  and  operate  urban  infrastructure  and  facilities; \n(vi) reluctance of the Government to acknowledge the permanent \nstatus of gers or hashaas (residential plots); (vii) inadequate urban \nroads in Ulaanbaatar; (viii) poor management and maintenance of \nurban  roads  in  Ulaanbaatar;  and  (ix)  health  problems  and \nassociated economic loss. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project is to improve the living conditions and \nquality of life of the urban population, especially in ger areas. The \noutcome  of  the  Project  will  be  upgraded  basic  urban  services, \nurban roads, and on-plot facilities. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $37.6 million \nequivalent, including taxes and duties of $2.6 million. \n   \n ", "vii \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n \nSource  Total   Percent \nA.

The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The  major  portion  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  relent  by  the \nTerms  Borrower,  through  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  to  the  participating \naimag governments and Ulaanbaatar municipal government under \nsubsidiary  loan  agreements  (SLAs)  based  on  the  size  of  the \nsubprojects under components A and B. Aimag governments will \nenter  into  onlending  agreements  (OLAs)  with  the  respective \nPUSOs. SLAs and OLAs will carry an interest rate of ADB rate not \nexceeding  3.25  (1.50%  plus  1.75%)  per  annum,  a  repayment \nperiod of 22 years including a 6-year grace period. For component \nC, the Borrower, through the Ministry of Finance, will relend funds \nto participating financial institutions (PFIs) under a series of SLAs. \nThe SLAs to the PFIs will carry an interest rate determined on cost \nof the loan, foreign exchange and interest variation risks and the \nProject  pro-poor  objective  and  affordability  of  the  poor \nsubborrowers.  The  PFIs  will  onlend  the  loan  proceeds  to  the \nsubborrowers on the terms of an interest rate not exceeding 10% \nper annum a repayment period of two to ten years including a \ngrace period of one year. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  A project steering committee chaired by the state secretary of the \nArrangements  Ministry  of  Construction  and  Urban  Development  will  be \nresponsible for project coordination and providing policy guidance \nduring  implementation.  A  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will \nserve as the secretariat of the project steering committee and will \nbe  responsible  for  coordinating  the  implementation  of  project \nactivities.  A  working  group  will  be  established  to  stimulate \nparticipation of the principal stakeholders for each subproject. A \n ", "viii \nproject  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  established  in  each \nproject town and Ulaanbaatar to coordinate the preparation and \ndevelopment  of  subprojects  and  support  their  implementation \nunder the general direction of the PMU. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Construction and Urban Development \n   \nProcurement  ADB-financed  civil  works,  equipment,  and  materials  will  be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April \n2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Major  contracts  for \nequipment  and  materials  will  be  tendered  through  international \ncompetitive  bidding,  national  competitive  bidding,  or  shopping \nprocedures,  depending  on  the  contract  amount.  Civil  works \ncontracts will be procured through national competitive bidding or \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines,  foreign  contractors  may  participate  in \nbidding for local competitive bidding contracts. \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will require about 195 person-months of international \nand 82 person-months of national consulting services to support \nthe PMU and PIUs in project implementation and management, the \nfeasibility  study  for  the  urban  road  improvement  component, \ndetailed  design  and  survey,  institutional  development,  and \neducation  and  training.  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  31  person-\nmonths  of  international  and  82  person-months  of  national \nconsultants. The international consultants will have expertise in \n(i) project  management  and  procurement,  (ii)  finance  and \nmicrofinance,  (iii)  institutional  development  and  financial \nmanagement,  and  (iv)  sanitation.  The  national  consultants  will \nhave  expertise  in  (i)  resettlement;  (ii)  environment;  (iii)  legal \naspects;  (iv)  database  development;  (v)  financial  management; \nand  (vi)  construction  supervision,  feasibility  studies  for  the \nremaining subprojects under component B, and detailed designs of \ncomponents  A  and  B.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (April  2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All \ninternational consultants and the national consultants for project \nmanagement will be selected and contracted individually. National \nconsultants  for  feasibility  studies  and  detailed  designs  will  be \nselected and contracted as firms using ADB\u2019s quality and cost-\nbased selection procedure among short-listed national consulting \nfirms.  German  development  cooperation  through  the  German \nDevelopment  Service  (DED)  will  provide  144 person-months  of \nlong-term  international  experts  in  community  engineering  (2 \npositions)  and  community  development  and  training.  German \ndevelopment  cooperation  through  the  German  Agency  for \nTechnical  Cooperation  (GTZ)  will  provide  a  maximum  of \n20 person-months  of  short-term  experts.  These  experts  will  be \nassigned at the PMU and PIUs, and guided by and report to the \nrespective PMU and PIU directors. DED and GTZ will select these \nexperts in accordance with their own guidelines. \n ", "ix \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  is  designed  to  have  multidimensional  impacts  on \nBeneficiaries  poverty  reduction.  The  Project  will  provide  or  upgrade \ninfrastructure, but will simultaneously (i) increase access to small \nloans for households and neighborhood improvements, (ii) create \ndirect short-term employment for construction and indirect long-\nterm  income  opportunities,  and  (iii)  empower  poor  residents  in \ndecision-making  processes  through  the  establishment  of \ncommunity-based organizations to plan and implement community \ninfrastructure improvements. The Project will have positive health \nbenefits. Residents are expected to experience a reduction in the \nincidence of water- and vector-borne diseases\u2014related to unsafe \ndrinking water and poor sanitation\u2014as well as medical costs and \nlost earnings incurred as a result of these diseases. Community \nparticipation is at the core of the project design. During project \npreparation, local communities were extensively involved in the \ndesign of the Project through a series of public consultation, focus \ngroup discussion, and surveys. The formation and participation of \ncommunity-based organizations in the Project will be essential in \nachieving the outputs of the Project. Nongovernment organizations \nwill play a facilitating role in the mobilization of communities and \nformation  of  community-based  organizations.  Capacity  building \nand training needs will also be identified and where appropriate, \ntraining will be conducted by nongovernment organizations. \n \nThe  Project  will  greatly  improve  community  health  and  living \nconditions and reduce environmental pollution. On a per capita \nbasis, the Project will decrease the demands on energy resources \nby replacing truck water tankers with a piped system. The adoption \nof composting toilets will reduce groundwater pollution and, with \ncorrect  management,  will  produce  organic  compost  for  small \nfarmers.   \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Two potential risks have been identified. The first is the possibility \nof  delays  in  the  formulation  of  the  remaining  subprojects  and \nproject implementation caused by weak institutional capacity of the \nPIUs. Considerable preparatory work has been undertaken for the \nsubprojects,  and  institutional  development  for  the  PIUs  will  be \nprovided during project implementation to mitigate this risk. The \nsecond risk is the possibility of delays in undertaking operational \nimprovements along with revision of the tariff structure for water \nsupply  and  wastewater  collection.  To  facilitate  tariff  collection \nbased on the proposed tariff structure, a substantial number of \nwater  meters  will  be  installed  under  the  Project  for  apartment \ndwellers, public and private organizations, ger area water kiosks, \nand ger area households when they are connected. In addition, the \nproject management consultants will assist the aimag governments \nin institutionalizing the tariff review process and conducting regular \ntariff reviews. \n \nAssumptions include (i) the Government will remain committed to \nimplement the Project, (ii) ger area communities and local banks \n ", "x \nand non-banking financial institutions are willing to participate in \nthe Project, (iii) ger area households are able and willing to save in \norder  to  establish creditworthiness  and/or  develop  collateral  for \nsmall  loans,  and  (iv)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be \nimplemented in a timely matter. \n ", "96o  00'E 111o  00'E\nR  U  S  S  I  A  N        F  E  D  E  R  A  T  I  O  N MONGOLIA\nURBAN DEVELOPMENT SECTOR PROJECT\nHanh\n50 o 00'N 50 o 00'N\nUlaangom Hatgal\nUVS Altanbulag\nNogoonnuur HOVSGOL\nDayaTnsengel Naranbulag Tes Tsagaan-Uul Moron BULGANSuhbaatar SELENGE Ereentsav\nBAYAN- Olgiy Olgiy Hutag-Ondor Selenge Darhan\nOLGIY Tudevtey Erdenet DARHAN-UUL Bayan-Uul\nDORNOD Havirga\nHovd ZAVHAN Bulgan ORHONSumber\nARHANGAY ULAANBAATAR HENTIY Choybalsan\nManhan Tsahir BattsHeisnhgiegl Ondor Lun ULAANBAATAR Batnorov\nUliastay\nDariv TOV Nalayh Baganuur Tamsagbulag\nHOVD Tayshir Tsetserleg Zuunmod Maanit Ondorhaan Monhhaan Matad\nYarantay Harhorin GOVISUMBER\nUyench Altay Bayanhongor Choyr Baruun-Urt\nTogrog Buutsagaan Arvayheer Erdenetsagaan\nBichigt\nMandalgovi\nNariynteel SUHBAATAR\nGOVI-ALTAY\nOVORHANGAY\nDUNDGOVI Saynshand\nBurgastay BAYANHONGOR\nTsogt-Ovoo DORNOGOVI\nZamyn-Uud\nDalanzadgad\nMONGOLIA\n42 o 00'N OMNOGOVI Bayan-Ovoo Project Town 42 o 00'N\nNational Capital\nGashuun Suhayt\nProvincial Capital\nCity/Town\nN Main Road\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA  Provincial Road\nRailway\n0 50 100150200250 River\nProvincial Boundary\nKilometers\nInternational Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n0\n6\n-2\n5\n0\n7 H 96o  00'E 111o  00'E\nR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nMongolia for the Urban Development Sector Project (the Project). The Project will help Mongolia \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals of environmental sustainability and increased access \nto safe drinking water and basic sanitation. This report is based on the findings of the loan \nAppraisal Mission and discussions with the central and local governments, relevant agencies, and \ncommunity organizations. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Mongolia experienced rapid urbanization during the second half of the 20th century. This \ntrend accelerated during the transition from central planning to a market-based economy. The \nurban population is about 1.54 million, equivalent to 60% of the national population of 2.56 million. \nThe urban population is growing by about 2.4% annually while total annual population growth is \nabout 1.4%. Urbanization is mainly due to rural-to-urban migration.  \n \n3.  Urban areas in Mongolia present two very different and distinct patterns of residential \naccommodation: apartment areas and ger (traditional tent) areas. Apartment areas are formally \nlaid out to include permanent housing based on socialist planning practices, featuring multi-family \nhousing surrounded by (vaguely defined) open space. These areas have the benefit of full utility \nservices, including heating and hot water. By contrast, ger areas are typically long strips of large, \nunserviced plots with wide unpaved roads on one or two sides. Both types of layout are found in \nvirtually all of the country\u2019s urban settlements. Following the withdrawal of Soviet support at the \nstart of the 1990s, there has been relatively little extension of apartment areas, but growth of ger \nareas has continued in most cities since most in-migrants live in ger areas. \n \n4.  The result is a growing disparity in the proportion of population benefiting from basic urban \ninfrastructure. Water is mostly trucked into ger areas and supplied through sales kiosks located up \nto 1 kilometer (km) or more from the farthest households. Water use is limited by having to carry \nwater over long distances and difficult terrain, often in adverse weather conditions. Consequently, \nthe average quantity of water used by ger area residents is typically 4\u201310 liters per capita per day. \nMoreover, the cost of water obtained from sales kiosks is up to 20 times more than that paid by \napartment dwellers for piped central supply. For sanitation, virtually all ger area households use \nbasic pit latrines that are inconvenient and a growing hazard to human and environmental health. \nOver 70% of ger area households lack access to solid waste removal points.  \n \n5.  Urban areas in Ulaanbaatar are growing rapidly because of substantial population migration \nfrom rural areas. The total population in Ulaanbaatar is estimated at over 1 million, including about \n80,000 students and 60,000 non-registered residents. Some 60% of the total population lives in ger \nareas. In 2004, Ulaanbaatar\u2019s road network totaled about 380 km, comprising 77 km (22.4%) of \nnational roads, 190 km (50.5%) of city roads, and 109 km (29.1%) of district or municipal roads. \nRoad construction has been increasing slowly by 1.2% per annum for the past 5 years. Most of the \nroads in Ulaanbaatar are poorly maintained asphalt or gravel roads. About 288 km of roads in the \ncity need to be reconstructed or rehabilitated. Only 10% of the city roads have drainage systems, \nwhich often are clogged with trash.  \n \n ", "2     \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n6.  The major issues in the urban development sector in Mongolia are (i) deficiency in the \nquality  of  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  especially  in  ger  areas;  (ii)  lack  of  community \nparticipation in the management and operation of urban services; (iii) lack of cost recovery and \ninadequate  financial  management  of  public  services;  (iv)  lack  of  financial  and  organizational \nautonomy  of  the  public  urban  services  organizations  (PUSOs);  (v)  lack  of  capacity  of  local \ngovernments,  through  the  PUSOs,  to  provide  and  operate  urban  infrastructure  and  facilities; \n(vi) reluctance  of  the  Government  to  acknowledge  the  permanent  status  of  gers  or  hashaas \n(residential plots); (vii) inadequate urban road infrastructure facilities and services in Ulaanbaatar; \n(viii) poor management and maintenance of urban roads in Ulaanbaatar; and (ix) health problems \nand associated economic loss. The Government has requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide assistance to achieve Goal 71 and Target 102 of the Millennium Development \nGoals. \n \n  1.  Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  The Project addresses the growing concern for the effects of population and economic \ngrowth on the inadequacy of public services in the aimag (provincial) centers, particularly ger \nareas.  Continuing  urbanization  has  resulted  in  increasing  water  shortage  as  well  as  major \ndeficiencies  in  other  urban  services.  The  1995  medium-term  strategy  was  the  first  important \nstatement on urban development in Mongolia which recognized that the Government does not \nhave the necessary resources to replace the growing number of ger area houses with subsidized \napartments.  The  Government\u2019s  2003  Strategy  for  Economic  Growth  Support  and  Poverty \nReduction called for reducing disparities in living conditions, and creating an enabling environment \nto support small and medium-sized enterprise development for both urban and rural settlements. \n \n8.  The Government\u2019s Action Plan for 2004\u20132008 has prescribed upgrading the quality of \npublic services by (i) strengthening the capacity and accountability of public service institutions and \ncivil  servants;  (ii)  expanding  civil  participation  at  all  levels  of  decision  making;  (iii)  ensuring \ntransparency; (iv) conducting social policy to improve living standards; (v) providing a favorable \nlegal environment, adequate infrastructure, and financial environment to accumulate savings, and \nto own, possess, and dispose of immovable property such as land and houses; (vi) intensifying \nresidential  construction  based  on  standards;  and  (vii)  reducing  harmful  waste  and  providing \necological education to residents. Within the framework of this action plan, the Government has \ndeveloped a program to provide 40,000 families with opportunities to live in housing with improved \nbasic services (the 40,000 Houses Program). The Government has developed a series of plans to \nachieve its urban development objectives, estimated at a total of about MNT50 billion for 2006\u2013\n2009. The Government\u2019s urban development sector policy and investment plan is in Appendix 2. \n \n9.  The Executing Agency for the Project, the Ministry of Construction and Urban Development \n(MCUD),  has  significant  experience  gained  from  the  implementation  of  ADB-funded  projects \n(Provincial Towns Basic Urban Services and Integrated Development of Basic Urban Services in \nProvincial Towns Project)3 and has the technical, financial, and managerial capability to implement \nthe Project (para. 20). Management of the project facilities will be delegated to the implementing \n                                                 \n1  Ensure environmental sustainability. \n2  Halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. \nMongolia\u2019s total water supply and sanitation coverage was 62% and 59% in 2002. \n3  ADB. 1997.

MCUD is equipped to provide the necessary \ncapacity  building  programs  for  the  aimag  governments  and  PUSOs.  UMG  has  the  technical, \nfinancial, and managerial capacity to implement the urban road improvement component of the \nProject. MCUD currently satisfies ADB\u2019s financial management requirements and has the financial \nmanagement  capability  to  satisfactorily  record  all  transactions  and  balances,  support  the \npreparation  of  regular  and  reliable  financial  statements  and  financial  monitoring  reports,  and \narrange for annual audits to be carried out in a manner acceptable to ADB. \n \n2.  Project Rationale \n10.  The Project will initially focus on Ulaanbaatar and Erdenet, the country\u2019s two large and \nrapidly growing urban centers. Subsequently, consideration will be given to relatively small towns \nor  aimag  centers.  The  Project  will  focus  on  providing  improved  urban  services  for  growing \npopulation in the large urban centers. At the same time, it will selectively provide support for \nimproving  living  conditions  in  the  smaller  towns,  which  would  attract  rural  people  and  thus \ncontribute to reduce further migration to the large urban centers. \n \n11.  The  1999  Ulaanbaatar  Road  Master  Plan  Study  financed  by  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency (JICA)4 set out a road development master plan up to 2020. The master plan \nrecommends major improvements to the capital city\u2019s road network, road maintenance system, \ntraffic circulation system, public transport services, and institutional strengthening. The master plan \nused a population figure of 925,000 for 2020 and motor vehicle population levels significantly lower \nthan current levels. The urban road improvement component under the Project is expected to \ncontribute to improving access within the city, in particular for ger areas. Selection and design of \nthe  road  sections  will be  determined  in  close  coordination  with  UMG,  considering  future  city \ndevelopment, to ensure compatibility with the updated master plan. \n \n12.  ADB has assisted the Government in developing a sustainable housing finance system in \nMongolia.5 However, access to such loans by low-income households is still limited. According to \nthe  demand  survey  conducted  as  part  of  the  poverty  and  social  analysis,  the  majority  of \nhouseholds  expressed  interest  in  taking  a  small  loan.  About  half  of  households  surveyed \nexpressed interest in using the loan for on-plot facility improvements. Those households that have \ntaken loans in the past indicated that the loans were primarily used for income generation or \ngeneral consumption. Thus, the Project is expected to fill a gap in loan demand by providing \naccess to small loans for low-income households in ger areas for on-plot facility improvements. \n \n  3.  Policy Dialogue \n13.  Tariff Policy and Reform. The Government and ADB agree that tariff reforms for water \nsupply are necessary to enable the PUSOs to be financially sustainable. The tariff reforms aim to: \n(i) reduce differences in tariffs between beneficiaries, (ii) achieve full cost recovery of operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) and depreciation, and (iii) establish a structured scheme to allow for minimum \nwater consumption to guarantee basic living standards for the poor. The Government supports the \ndecentralization  of  responsibility  for  tariff  setting  to  aimag  governments.  MCUD  will  request \nparticipating aimag governments to provide MCUD with letters that indicate their commitment to \nimplement the proposed tariff reforms in a timely manner, and enable the PUSOs to undertake \nmanagement and operational improvements. Further, the aimag governments will request Ministry \nof  Finance  (MOF)  to  allocate  the  required  tariff  increases  for  the  public  organizations.  Each \n                                                 \n4  JICA. 1999. The Master Plan Study on Improved and Rehabilitation of Road Network in Ulaanbaatar. Tokyo. \n5  ADB. 2001.

Manila (Loan 1847-MON). \n ", "4     \nparticipating aimag government will institutionalize a tariff review process and conduct regular tariff \nreviews.  The  Project  will  provide  education  and  training  for  local  communities  to  increase \nawareness and understanding on the need for tariff reforms. It is important that (i) water tariff for \nboth ger areas and apartment areas, including institutions, will be revised to a parity level to \nrecover full cost; (ii) water meters will be installed in all apartment households, public and private \norganizations, water kiosks in ger areas, and ger area households when they are connected; and \n(iii) the aimag government\u2019s commitment to tariff reform will be included in the subsidiary loan \nagreement (SLA) between the Government and the aimag government. In particular, the Project \nwill closely monitor implementation of the tariff reform in the smaller project towns, and provide \nguidance to ensure timely implementation of the tariff reforms. \n \n14.  City Master Plans and Ger Area Development Planning. Preparation and updating of \ncity master plans is under the responsibility of aimag governments, but budget limitations often \nconstrain their timely production. The Government considers that planning for cities, including ger \nareas, is necessary. To ensure that ger areas do not continue to be considered temporary in \nnature,  the  Government  has  adopted  a  structured  planning  approach  based  on  projected \npopulation, economic activities and employment forecast, land zoning and land use, and demand \nfor  infrastructure  support.  This  will  allow  infrastructure  investments  to  play  a  proactive  and \nfacilitating role rather than being delayed reactive measures. \n \n15.  Community and Private Sector Participation. Government policy concerning community \nparticipation in urban development is still being formed. Community participation has been initiated \nunder the Project through the social survey and public consultations conducted during project \npreparation. This process will continue and a feedback mechanism will be established during \nproject implementation. Opportunities for private sector participation exist in recycling of rejected \nmaterials such as fuel ash, metals, plastics, and glass. Community and private sector participation \nwill be supported by the proposed Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) project6 which will be \nimplemented in parallel with the Project. \n \n  4.  External Assistance \n16.  ADB has provided support for the urban development sector since 1998 through loan, \ntechnical assistance (TA), and grant projects for improvements to basic urban services in the \nprovincial  capitals,  housing  finance,  living  environment  improvements  in  ger  areas,  cadastral \nsurvey and land registration, and regional development planning (footnotes 3 and 5).7 ADB is one \nof the main sources of external assistance for the sector. The World Bank is also a major source of \nassistance in this sector. It has worked primarily in Ulaanbaatar and has provided two loans to \nupgrade basic urban services in ger areas there. The United Nations Development Programme is \nimplementing  a  grant  program  for  superinsulated,  energy  efficient  houses.  Among  bilateral \nagencies,  Germany  is  conducting  an  integrated  urban  development  program,  mainly  in \nUlaanbaatar. Japan is developing a master plan for solid waste management in Ulaanbaatar and \nrehabilitating  the  water  source  of  Ulaanbaatar.  Australia,  France,  and  Sweden  are  also \nimplementing projects with urban implications. Donor coordination in the urban development sector \nhas  been  undertaken  during  project  preparation  through  seminars  and  workshops.  External \nassistance for urban development is described in Appendix 3. \n \n                                                 \n6  Proposed Grant Assistance to Mongolia for Community-Driven Development for Urban Poor in Ger Areas.

Lessons learned from ADB\u2019s experience in the urban development sector are reflected in \nthe project design and policy dialogue with the Government. They will also be reflected in the \nengineering design of the project facilities and in institutional development programs.  \n \n18.  The Project will be the first sector loan project for urban development in Mongolia. ADB\u2019s \nexperience in other countries indicates that sector loans tend to be implemented more slowly than \nproject  loans.  Lessons  learned  include  the  following:  (i)  subproject  formulation  needs  to  be \nundertaken during the project preparatory stage as much as possible, (ii) simple and affordable \ntechnologies should be applied for construction and improvement of facilities, and (iii) institutional \ndevelopment and training need to be provided during project implementation. \n \n19.  Small loans operations in ger areas are emerging initiatives in Mongolia. ADB has been \nsupporting housing finance through the Housing Finance (Sector) Project (footnote 5) and the \nproject for Improving the Living Environment of the Poor in Ger Areas of Mongolia\u2019s Cities (footnote \n7). Lessons from these ongoing projects include the following: (i) a sound legal and regulatory \nenvironment is needed; (ii) individual savings before receiving loans help facilitate repayments;8 \nand (iii) careful vetting and selection of participating financial institutions, based on comprehensive \nselection criteria, is important. \n \n6.  Sector Loan Approach \n20.  The Project has been formulated to support the Government\u2019s sector policies on urban \ndevelopment, including the Government\u2019s Action Plan for 2004\u20132008 and the 40,000 Houses \nProgram. MCUD has demonstrated its capacity to implement externally funded projects supported \nby ADB (footnotes 3, 5, and 7). ADB has also provided advisory TA to help MCUD develop a \nstrategy for the urban development and housing sector,9 which helped to establish the policy \nfoundation for this Project. Based on its experience in implementing sector activities, including \nexternally funded projects, MCUD has the capacity to implement the sector investment plan. \nBuilding  on  MCUD\u2019s  established  implementation  capacity,  the  Project  will  provide  training for \nrelevant government agencies to further strengthen their capacities to plan and implement the \nsector  policies  and  plans.  The  Government  meets  the  three  requirements  for  sector  lending: \n(i) appropriate sector policies, (ii) a sector investment plan, and (iii) the institutional capacity to \nimplement the plan.  \n \n21.  Project implementation will start with two core subprojects: (i) improvement of the Hailaast \nroad section in Ulaanbaatar; and (ii) water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management in \nErdenet. The Erdenet subproject will provide (i) improved water supply for about 6,600 ger area \nhouseholds, (ii) piped water supply and sewerage for public institutions, (iii) improved solid waste \ncollection and disposal, and (iv) small loans for on-plot facility improvement for about 1,800 ger \narea households. The Hailaast subproject will upgrade 4.1 km of the existing road in ger areas, \nincluding drainage to improve (i) public transportation from Hailaast ger areas to the city center in \nUlaanbaatar, and (ii) access to public services in Hailaast ger areas. The remaining subprojects will \nbe identified and formulated during project implementation in accordance with rigorous procedures \nfor screening, identification, selection, and appraisal of the subprojects described in Appendix 4. \nADB  reviewed  the  two  core  subprojects  and  found  that  they  are  viable  from  a  technical, \ninstitutional, social, financial, economic, and environmental perspective. For each of the remaining \nsubprojects, UMG and the concerned aimag governments and PUSOs will prepare a feasibility \n                                                 \n8  Land privatization is being implemented, but not all households can use their land as collateral for a loan. \n9  ADB. 2005.

For the water \nsupply  subcomponent,  the  aimag  governments  concerned  will  be  required  to  indicate  strong \npolitical commitment to implement the tariff reforms to ensure repayment to the Government (para. \n13). The project management unit (PMU) will be responsible for the appraisal of the subprojects \nand will prepare subproject appraisal reports for consideration by the project steering committee \n(PSC). The subproject appraisal reports will then be sent to ADB for approval. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n22.  The impact of the Project is to improve the living conditions and quality of life of the urban \npopulation, especially in ger areas. The outcome of the Project will be upgraded basic urban \nservices, urban roads, and on-plot facilities.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n23.  The  Project  comprises  four  components:  (i)  A:  improvement  of  basic  urban  services, \n(ii) B: improvement of urban roads, (iii) C: small loans for water connections and on-plot facility \nimprovements, and (iv) D: institutional development and training. \n \n24.  Component A will rehabilitate and/or construct basic urban infrastructure in the project \ntowns and includes subcomponents for water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management. \nThe water supply subcomponent will improve the centralized water supply systems. It will include \ninstallation of new and repair of existing pumps and pipes, development of new boreholes and \nreservoirs, improved control of bulk water supply, and expansion of distribution networks in ger \nareas to connect existing and new water kiosks within 200 meters from the plots, and to provide \nconnection boxes for future individual and kiosk connections. The sanitation subcomponent will \nrehabilitate  existing  pumps  and  pipelines,  improve  existing  wastewater  treatment  plants  and \ntreatment lagoons, and connect public institutions such as schools and hospitals in ger areas to the \ncentralized sewerage system. The solid waste management subcomponent will improve collection, \ntransportation, and disposal of domestic solid waste through the provision of solid waste collection \nand transport trucks and basic landfill management equipment.  \n \n25.  Component B will upgrade (i) existing unpaved roads that serve as the main access routes \nto ger areas and connect to the trunk roads to the city center, and (ii) street sections that hinder \nsmooth traffic flow because of poor pavement conditions caused by lack of proper maintenance. It \nwill include improvement of pavements; construction and rehabilitation of drainage; provision of \nsurfaced sidewalks; and installation of streetlights, traffic signs, and road markings. Creation of a \nbetter environment for pedestrians to improve road safety and smooth movement of vehicles will \nbe considered during detailed design. \n \n26.  Component  C  will  make  loans  available  to  participating  financial  institutions  (PFIs) \n(nonbanking financial institutions and commercial banks) so that they can establish small loans \nfacilities to individuals and communities in ger areas. The individuals and communities will be the \nultimate beneficiaries of small loans. The loans will be made available for three types of individual \nand community investments. First, loans will be offered to enable individual households to connect \nto the piped water supply system. Second, loans will be made available to purchase and install \nwater meters in all apartments and ger area households when they are connected. Third, small \nloans will be offered to allow individual households to install on-plot or decentralized sanitation \nfacilities,  energy  efficient  stoves,  and  housing  improvements  (such  as  better  insulation)  and \nadditions (such as bathrooms and extra rooms). Sanitation facilities will include septic tanks, \n ", "  7\ncompost toilets, and other innovative solutions. Interested ger area households can select from \namong all available options for on-plot sanitation. Initial eligibility criteria of the PFIs and lending \nmechanisms and conditions were established to ensure that poor households will not be excluded. \n \n27.  Component D will comprise three subcomponents. The project management subcomponent \nwill support increasing the efficiency and strengthening the capacity of implementing agencies in \nimplementing the Project. The institutional reform subcomponent will assist the PUSOs to (i) be \nautonomous  and  financially  sustainable  operating  entities,  (ii)  implement  the  proposed  tariff \nreforms and operational improvements, and (iii) develop sound O&M plans for future service \nprovision. This subcomponent will also assist the RD of UMG to (i) develop a road maintenance \nmaster plan; (ii) develop a road safety strategy, including a safety audit program; (iii) develop a \ncomprehensive traffic management and control strategy; and (iv) update the 1999 Ulaanbaatar \nroad master plan. The education and training subcomponent will help government agencies and \nlocal communities increase awareness of public health, environmental management, traffic safety, \nthe need for tariff reforms, and alternative technologies for urban infrastructure and services. \n \nC.  Special Features \n28.  The Project will be the first ADB project to focus on comprehensive ger area development. \nPast and ongoing ADB support, including the Provincial Towns Basic Urban Services Project and \nIntegrated  Development  of  Basic  Urban  Services  in  Provincial  Towns  Project  (footnote  3), \nrenovated infrastructure that serves mainly apartment areas. This Project will focus on expanding \ninfrastructure networks into the surrounding ger areas. Further, the Project will improve access to \nfunds  for  ger  area  residents  to  construct  individual  water  connections  and  on-plot  facilities. \nOngoing  land  privatization  by  the  Government  and  infrastructure  upgrading  by  the  Project  is \nexpected to give greater incentives to ger area residents to further invest in the improvement of \ntheir individual houses and neighborhood environment. In urban areas, 30% of the population is \npoor and 80\u201390% of the urban poor live in ger areas. Considering the high incidence of poverty in \nger areas, the Project is expected to contribute substantially to poverty reduction. \n \n29.  The reduction of urban waste and its conversion into a useful and potentially marketable \nresource through ecologically sound, on-plot sanitation will be an important feature of the Project. It \nwill potentially contribute to improved sanitation techniques through eliminating pit latrines and \npollution of groundwater, reducing the infrastructure burden on public authorities, and turning \nhuman waste into a marketable commodity.10 This approach will be piloted first and expanded later \nwhen the approach is confirmed to be feasible. \n \n30.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  in  cooperation  and  coordination  with  other  external \nassistance agencies. German development cooperation through the German Development Service \n(DED) will provide grant parallel cofinancing for long-term experts to support the project activities. \nThe experts will have expertise in training of trainers for community participation and in practical \napplications  of  improved  technologies  for  service  and  housing  improvements.  German \ndevelopment  cooperation  through  the  German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  (GTZ)  has \nagreed to work closely with ADB to coordinate and harmonize the approaches of the ADB project \nand the GTZ integrated urban development program. GTZ will also provide grant parallel cofinance \nfor short-term experts in community participation.  \n \n                                                 \n10  This issue is also included in the model terms of reference prepared by ADB on planning urban sanitation and \nwastewater management. \n ", "8     \nD.

The major portion of the proceeds of the loan will be relent by the Borrower, through MOF, \nto participating aimag governments and UMG under SLAs based on the size of the subproject \nunder components A and B. Aimag governments will enter into onlending agreements (OLAs) with \nthe respective PUSOs in the project towns to implement the subprojects under component A. The \nSLAs and subsequent OLAs will carry an interest rate not exceeding 3.25 (1.50% plus 1.75%) per \nannum. The term of the subsidiary loans to the aimag governments, PUSOs, and UMG will be 22 \nyears, including a 6-year grace period, during which only interest payments will be required. For \ncomponent C, the Borrower, through MOF, will relend funds to the PFIs under a series of SLAs. \nThe SLAs to the PFIs will carry an interest rate determined on cost of the loan, foreign exchange \nand  interest  variation  risks  and  the  Project  pro-poor  objective  and  affordability  of  the  poor \nsubborrowers. The PFIs will onlend the loan proceeds to the subborrowers on the terms of an \ninterest rate not exceeding 10% per annum a repayment period of two to ten years including a \ngrace period of one year..11 The cost estimates do not include any additional investments made by \nindividual households and communities receiving loans through component C. It is expected that, \nin addition to the loans, both households and communities will invest significant amounts in cash, \nkind, and labor. Appendix 6 illustrates the flow of funds and onlending arrangements. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n34.  MCUD will be the Executing Agency for the Project. A PSC chaired by the state secretary of \nMCUD  will  be  responsible  for  project  coordination  and  will  provide  policy  guidance  during \nimplementation. The PSC will comprise representatives from MOF; MCUD; Ministry of Nature and \nEnvironment; Ministry of Road, Transport and Tourism; National Center for Construction, Urban \nDevelopment, and Public Utilities; participating aimag governments; and UMG. A PMU will be \nestablished under MCUD to serve as the secretariat of the PSC and will be responsible for \ncoordinating  the  implementation  of  project  activities.  The  PMU  will  (i)  ensure  adequate \ninterdepartmental cooperation and interagency coordination, (ii) monitor and report on the progress \nof project implementation, and (iii) coordinate communication with ADB and agencies concerned. \n \n35.

The working \ngroup for component B will comprise representatives from the RD of UMG, PIU, and participating \ndistrict governments. A PIU will be established in each project town and Ulaanbaatar to coordinate \nthe preparation and development of subprojects under the general direction of the PMU. The PIUs \nwill be responsible for assisting and monitoring the PUSOs and the RD of UMG regarding all \naspects of subproject implementation  including  working with  project  stakeholders,  maintaining \nsubproject accounts, clearing environmental examination, implementing resettlement, monitoring \nsubproject performance, and submitting progress reports. All staff of the PMU and PIUs will be \nselected  and  contracted  individually  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. Detailed implementation arrangements are in Appendix 7. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n36.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years from 2007 to 2012. The implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Procurement \n37.  The  procurement  of  goods  and  works  financed  under  the  loan  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time). \nInternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  will  be  applied  to  supply  contracts  estimated  to  cost \n$500,000 or more. Supply contracts with a value less than $500,000 will follow national competitive \nbidding (NCB), and those less than $100,000 will follow shopping procedures as reflected by \nparticular circumstances of the contract packages. ICB will be used for civil works contracts valued \nat $1 million or more. Civil works contracts valued less than $1 million will be procured using NCB \nprocedures. The selection and engagement of contractors will be subject to ADB approval. Before \ncommencement  of  NCB  procurement,  ADB  and  the  Borrower  will  review  the  Borrower\u2019s \nprocurement  procedures  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB  requirements.  Any  necessary \nmodifications or clarifications to the Borrower\u2019s procedures will be documented in the procurement \nplan. The internationally tendered equipment packages will include the necessary technical support \nfor ensuring proper installation, testing, commissioning, and training of operational staff as part of \nthe related contracts. In accordance with ADB requirements, foreign contractors may participate in \nbidding for NCB contracts. The procurement plan is in Appendix 9. \n \n38.  Because of the severe and long winters, the construction season in Mongolia is short \n(April\u2013October). ADB approved MCUD\u2019s request for advance contracting for procurement and \nconsultants to expedite project implementation. Advance contracting for procurement will include: \n(i) prequalification of contractors, tendering, and bid evaluation for civil works packages; and \n(ii) preparation of tender documents to procure materials and equipment. Advance contracting for \nconsulting services will include short-listing of qualified consultants. MCUD also requested ADB for \nretroactive financing up to $500,000 equivalent for expenditures incurred in establishing the PMU. \nAll eligible expenditures should have been incurred no earlier than 12 months before the signing of \nthe loan agreement. The issuance of invitations to bid or to prequalify under advance contracting \nand retroactive financing will be subject to ADB approval. All advance contracting and retroactive \nfinancing will be undertaken in conformity with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). The Government was advised \nthat approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the \nProject. \n \n ", " 11\n4.  Consulting Services \n39.  The Project will require a total of about 195 person-months of international and 82 person-\nmonths of national consulting services to support the PMU and PIUs in project implementation and \nmanagement, feasibility study for the urban road improvement component, detailed design and \nsurvey,  institutional  development,  and  education  and  training.  The  ADB  loan  will  finance \n31 person-months of international and 82 person-months of national consultants. The international \nconsultants  will  have  expertise  in  (i)  project  management  and  procurement,  (ii)  finance  and \nmicrofinance, (iii) institutional development and financial management, and (iv) sanitation. The \nnational consultants will have expertise in (i) resettlement; (ii) environment; (iii) legal aspects; \n(iv) database development; (v) financial management; and (vi) construction supervision, feasibility \nstudies for the remaining subprojects under component B, and detailed designs of components A \nand B. The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). All international consultants and \nthe  national  consultants  for  project  management  will  be  selected  and  contracted  individually. \nNational consultants for feasibility studies and detailed designs will be selected and contracted as \nfirms  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedure  among  short-listed  national \nconsulting firms. German development cooperation through DED will provide 144 person-months \nof  long-term  international  experts  in  community  engineering  (2  positions)  and  community \ndevelopment and training. German development cooperation through GTZ will provide a maximum \nof 20 person-months of short-term experts. These experts will be assigned at the PMU and the \nPIUs, and will be guided by and report to the respective PMU and PIU directors. DED and GTZ will \nselect these experts in accordance with their own guidelines. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n40.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the Government and \nMCUD. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions \nof ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for \nthe Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MCUD; \nIAs; and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the \nProject.  Good  governance  in  selecting  subprojects  will  also  be  ensured  by  well-defined  and \ncarefully  monitored  selection  criteria  and  process.  For  the  Project,  MCUD  will  undertake  the \nfollowing anticorruption actions: (i) introduce a dual-signing system in which the civil works contract \nwinner also signs an anticorruption contract with the employer, and (ii) periodically inspect the \ncontractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n41.  The loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2001). \nTo expedite project implementation through timely release of loan proceeds, the PMU will establish \ntwo imprest accounts for components A, C, and D, and for component B promptly after loan \neffectiveness at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. Disbursements from the imprest account \nwill  be  supported  by  an  appropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related  documentation.  Such \ndocumentation  will  demonstrate,  among  other  things,  that  the  goods  and/or  services  are \n(i) procured from ADB\u2019s member countries, and (ii) eligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to \nbe deposited in the imprest account will not exceed the estimated expenditures for the next \n6 months,  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedure may be used to reimburse, liquidate, or replenish eligible expenditures. \n ", "12    \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n42.  The Government, through the PMU and PIUs, will: (i) maintain separate financial accounts \nfor the Project, and (ii) have such accounts and related financial statements audited annually by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement \nand as specified in ADB\u2019s Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the Bank.12 \nThe auditors should have qualifications, experience, and terms of reference acceptable to ADB. \nThe use of the imprest accounts and statement of expenditures will also be part of the annual audit \nand a separate audit opinion will be submitted. The Government will submit to ADB certified copies \n(in English) of such audited accounts and financial statements, and the related reports and auditors, \nwithin 6 months after the close of each fiscal year. \n \n43.  For  the  purpose  of  complying  with  the  requirements  for  the  annual  audited  financial \nstatements, the proceeds of this loan may be used to finance expenditures for private financial \nstatements, sector auditors, and translations of auditor\u2019s reports into English. The PMU will submit \nconsolidated quarterly progress reports to ADB (in English) and to the Government on all aspects \nof project implementation. The reports will include details on overall implementation progress, \nproblems encountered during the reporting period, measures taken or proposed to be taken to \nremedy these problems, and the proposed program of activities for the following quarter. Within \n3 months of project completion, the PMU will prepare and submit to ADB, in a format acceptable to \nADB, a project completion report on (i) the utilization and impact of the loan; (ii) performance of the \nProject; (iii) economic and social benefits generated; and (iv) details about implementation, costs, \nresettlement, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n44.  The project performance monitoring system (PPMS) will focus on targets and indicators \nidentified  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  including  (i)  public  satisfaction  with  the \nneighborhood environment; (ii) relevant economic and health data to monitor project impacts; \n(iii) number of households served by the improved water supply; (iv) number of public institutions \nserved by the improved water supply and sewerage; (v) improvements in solid waste collection and \nlandfill  site  management;  (vi)  improvement  in  PUSO  performance;  (vii)  reduction  of  traffic \ncongestion; (viii) reduction of vehicle emissions; (ix) activities of CBOs; (x) number of ger area \nhouseholds and CBOs utilizing small loans; (xi) increase in public awareness of public health, \nenvironmental management, and road safety; and (xii) environmental compliance and monitoring \nreporting and National Inspection Agency reporting.  \n \n45.  At the beginning of the Project, the PMU and PIUs, with assistance from the consultants, \nwill develop PPMS procedures to generate data systematically on the inputs and outputs of the \nsubprojects, as well as the agreed socioeconomic, environmental, and health indicators to be used \nto measure the project impacts; and obtain ADB\u2019s approval within the first 3 months after loan \neffectiveness. The PMU will (i) refine the PPMS framework, (ii) confirm achievable targets, (iii) firm \nup monitoring and recording arrangements, and (iv) establish systems and procedures no later \nthan 6 months after loan effectiveness. \n \n46.  The  PPMS\u2014including  the  establishment  of  benchmarks,  collection  of  baseline  and \nprogress data, monitoring of benefits, and evaluation of social impact\u2014will be implemented by the \nPIUs  in  collaboration  with  the  aimag  governments,  PUSOs,  and  RD  of  UMG.  Data  will  be \npresented in simple formats that allow local inputs and respond to reporting formats. The PMU will \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 1989.

The PPMS will be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial \naction regarding project design, schedules, and activities. The PMU will report to ADB quarterly on \nboth the physical implementation and financial aspects of the Project, to ensure that impacts are \nmonitored and reported in line with ADB requirements. \n \n9.  Project Review \n47.  The Government and ADB will jointly review implementation progress at least once a year. \nIn addition, the Government and ADB will undertake a comprehensive midterm review after 2 years \nof project implementation. The midterm review will include a detailed assessment of (i) scope, \n(ii) implementation arrangements, (iii) achievement of scheduled targets, (iv) progress made in \npolicy and tariff reform, and (v) capacity building measures. A detailed assessment of component A \nwill  be  undertaken,  including  the  implementation  status  of  the  tariff  reforms,  institutional \nstrengthening  of  the  PUSOs,  and  unaccounted  for  water  reduction  programs.  The  relative \nproportion of the loan used for components A and B will also be reassessed at midterm review. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Social Dimensions \n  1.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n48.  It is anticipated that land acquisition and resettlement will not be very significant13 and can \nbe avoided for many subprojects. Some houses, gers, and fences will need to be relocated to \nnearby plots of land. To ensure that ADB policies on involuntary resettlement will be applied and \naffected people compensated, a resettlement framework has been prepared which sets out (i) the \nresettlement  policy  and  Mongolian  legal  framework  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement, \n(ii) compensation  standards  and  entitlements,  (iii)  procedures  for  formulating  RPs,  (iv) \nimplementation arrangements, (v) consultation and participation, (vi) eligibility provision, (vii) a \ngrievance  redress  mechanism,  (viii)  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  (ix)  provision  of  the \nresettlement  budget.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  overall  resettlement  management  and \ncoordination,  internal  monitoring,  and  quarterly  reporting  to  ADB.  The  PIUs  will  take  primary \nresponsibility for any resettlement consultation, notices, implementation, and timely delivery of \nentitlements.  Because  of  limited  experience  with  involuntary  resettlement,  some  training  and \ncapacity building will be conducted under component D, and it was endorsed by the Government \nand disclosed to the affected people. \n \n49.  The draft RP was prepared for one of two core subprojects for the Hailaast road section.14 \nMCUD and UMG implemented The Public Communications Policy of the Asian Development \nBank.15 During implementation, the PMU will prepare the RPs for the remaining subprojects that \nhave  resettlement  impacts,  based  on  the  RF  and  detailed  design.  The  PMU  will  review  the \nremaining  subprojects  before  the  award  of  the  civil  works  contracts  to  ensure  there  are  no \ninvoluntary  resettlement  effects  that  would  require  compensation  and  other  assistance  under \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995). If impacts are identified and cannot be avoided, an RP will be \nrequired. The summary RF is in Appendix 10. \n \n \n                                                 \n13 \u201cSignificant\u201d means 200 or more people will experience major impacts, which are defined as (i) being physically \ndisplaced from housing, or (ii) losing 10% or more of their productive assets (income generating). \n14  The Erdenet subproject does not require land acquisition or resettlement. \n15  ADB. 2005. Public Communications Policy: Disclosure and Exchange of Information. Manila. \n ", "14    \n2.  Poverty Reduction, Health Benefits, Gender, and Community Participation \n50.  The Project is designed to have multidimensional impacts on poverty reduction. The Project \nwill provide or upgrade infrastructure, but will simultaneously (i) increase access to small loans for \nwater connections and on-plot facility improvements, (ii) create direct short-term employment for \nconstruction  and  indirect  long-term  income  generating  opportunities,  and  (iii)  empower  poor \nresidents in decision-making processes through the establishment of CBOs to plan and implement \ncommunity infrastructure improvements. The Project will have positive health benefits. Residents \nare expected to experience a reduction in the incidence of water- and vector-borne diseases\u2014\nrelated to unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation\u2014as well as medical costs and lost earning \nincurred as a result of these diseases. The Project will not increase the income gap between poor \nand affluent sectors, and is expected to reduce it. Community participation is at the core of the \nproject design. During project preparation, local communities were extensively involved in the \ndesign of the Project through a series of public consultation, focus group discussion, and surveys. \nThe formation and participation of CBOs in the Project will be essential in achieving the outputs of \nthe  Project.  Nongovernment  organizations  will  play  a  facilitating  role  in  the  mobilization  of \ncommunities and formation of CBOs. The proposed JFPR project (footnote 6) will assist the \nGovernment to determine the legal aspects of the CBOs. Capacity building and training needs will \nalso  be  identified,  and  where  appropriate  training  will  be  conducted  by  nongovernment \norganizations. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy and the gender action plan are \nin Appendix 11 and 12. \n \nB.  Environmental Impacts and Benefits  \n51.  Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  carried  out  for  the  core  subprojects  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines.16 It \nwas determined that the Project will not have significant adverse environmental impacts. The \nProject will not adversely affect natural resources and will greatly improve community health and \nliving conditions. The Project will reduce environmental pollution. No detrimental effects will be \ncaused on the flora and fauna. On a per capita basis, the Project will decrease the demands on \nenergy resources by replacing truck water tankers with a piped system. Negative environmental \nimpact  will  occur  during  construction,  but  its  extent  will  be  minimized  by  careful  design  and \nspecification of project construction through mitigation measures identified in the IEE. The adoption \nof composting toilets will reduce groundwater pollution and, with correct management, will produce \norganic compost for small farmers. Improvement of the urban roads will reduce dust and noise. \nHighlights of the summary IEE are in Appendix 13. The summary IEE includes the environmental \nassessment and review procedures. \n \nC.  Institutional Aspects \n52.  There is a need for institutional strengthening, especially at the local government level, \nfocusing on: (i) planning and financial management, (ii) O&M of basic urban infrastructure and \nfacilities, (iii) maintenance planning for urban roads, (iv) community participatory structures and \nprocess,  (v)  environmental  monitoring,  and  (vi)  handling  of  resettlement  issues.  Institutional \nstrengthening incorporated in the Project through component D includes training and awareness \nprograms,  consulting  services  for  project  management  support,  and  institutional  and  financial \nstrengthening of the PUSOs and RD of UMG. \n \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n ", " 15\nD.  Financial Evaluation \n53.  The financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken for the water supply and sanitation \nsubcomponents in Erdenet in real terms using constant 2006 prices. The project cost estimates \nand  financial  projections  in  nominal  terms  were  converted  to  real  terms  by  adjusting  for  the \nprojected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuation. Incremental revenue \nand cost were derived by evaluating the financial position of the PUSO under with- and without-\nproject scenarios.17 The financial projections take into account impact on receivables and costs of \noperational improvements, reduction in unaccounted-for water, and charging and receiving full cost \nrecovery tariffs. The financial internal rate of return was computed on an after-tax basis of 8.10%, \nwhich compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital in real terms of 0.25%. The \nfinancial analysis is in Appendix 14.  \n \n54.  The sensitivity analysis for the subproject includes examination of the risk that project cost \nwill increase by 10%, or that revenue will decrease by 10% without implementation of required tariff \nreform; the resulting financial internal rate of returns are 6.5% and 6.3%. An affordability analysis \nof  the  subproject  showed  that  the  proposed  water  supply  tariffs  should  be  set  at  the  level \naffordable to average and poor households. These tariffs are 3.25% of the average poor household \nincome of MNT82,923.18  \n \n55.  Financial  projections  were  prepared  for  the  Erdenet  PUSO  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by \nADB19 to assess the financial viability and sustainability of the subproject. The projected financial \nstatements  indicate  that  financial  revenue  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  the  O&M  costs  and \ndepreciation and debt service, whichever is greater, and provide a reasonable rate of return. Based \non the financial projections, the PUSO will be in a position to maintain a minimum debt-service \ncoverage ratio of 1.2:1.0, a maximum debt-equity ratio of 70:30, and a minimum current ratio of \n2:1. The PUSO has agreed to minimum levels of financial performance, and these will be included \nas loan covenants covering capital structure (debt to equity), debt service cover, and liquidity. \nFinancial projections estimate the tariff required for an appropriate level of financial performance. \nPeriodic tariff reviews and approval of appropriate tariff reforms by the aimag government will be \nrequired to reduce the risk of poor financial performance. The Project is considered both financially \nviable and sustainable. \n \nE.  Financial Management Assessment  \n56.  The financial management assessment of MCUD, the PUSO in Erdenet, and the RD of \nUMG has been undertaken using the financial management assessment questionnaire provided by \nADB. It determined the accounting and financial capacity needs of MCUD, the Erdenet PUSO, and \nthe  RD  of  UMG  during  project  implementation  and  operations  after  project  completion.  The \nquestionnaire was administered to MCUD, the finance departments of the Erdenet PUSO, and the \nfinance division of the RD of UMG. \n \n57.  The assessment of MCUD\u2019s previous experience managing ADB-funded projects confirms \nthat their financial management practices are fully adequate for implementation of the Project. In \nthe case of the Erdenet PUSO and the RD of UMG, staff will need training in project management \n                                                 \n17  The without-project scenario assumes that phased tariff restructuring, full metering, and unaccounted-for water \nreduction targets have not been implemented successfully. The with-project scenario assumes that they have been \nimplemented successfully. \n18  Based on the socioeconomic survey conducted during project preparation. \n19 ADB. 2001. Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank. Manila.  \n ", "16    \nand relevant ADB procedures during implementation of the Project. With the help of international \nand national consultants, capacity of the Erdenet PUSO and the RD of UMG will be strengthened \nin: (i) efficient operations of the physical facilities; (ii) functional areas covering administration, \nfinance, accounting, and business planning; and (iii) management information system, and cost \nmanagement and control.  \n \nF.  Economic Aspects  \n58.  The  economic  analysis  covers  both  the  Project  as  a  whole,  and  the  individual  core \nsubprojects in Erdenet and Hailaast in Ulaanbaatar. For the Project as a whole, the analysis covers \nthe  economic  rationale  for  public  intervention,  and  goals  and  general  design  of  the  public \ninvestment plan. The economic rationale is sound, based on managing natural monopolies (water \nsupply, wastewater management, and urban roads). The goals of the investment plan are to meet \ntargets for water supply, sewerage, and sanitation coverage in the ger areas, and urban road \nimprovement in Ulaanbaatar. Centralized water supply and sewerage facilities are part of a least-\ncost  plan  to  achieve  water  service  coverage  targets  under  three  basic  conditions:  (i)  water \nconnections and metering are to be provided in the ger and apartment areas, including budget and \nprivate organizations; (ii) water tariffs are to provide appropriate economic incentives for water \nconservation; and (iii) water supply and sanitation facilities are designed as least cost. The Project \naddresses the first two conditions through its assurances as well as policy dialogue. The third \ncondition is part of the appraisal criteria for representative water supply and sanitation subprojects. \nUrban road improvement is a priority investment to ease traffic flow and reduce accidents, and \ndesigned as least cost in terms of physical improvements. \n \n59.  A quantitative economic analysis also demonstrated the value of the Project. The economic \nanalysis was conducted for the core subprojects over a 25-year period inclusive of the project \nconstruction period, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.20 \nThe economic benefits and costs for the water supply subcomponent in Erdenet were estimated on \na without- and with-project basis appropriately apportioned on the basis of being tradable or non-\ntradable,  and  with  adjustments  to  the  non-incremental  and  incremental  project  benefits. \nIncremental benefits were valued on the basis of willingness to pay and non-incremental benefits \nwere valued on the basis of cost savings. The economic costs of urban road improvement reflect \nthe incremental costs for investment and O&M under the with-project situation, and the costs \ninvolved in operating the existing facility under the without-project situation. The major economic \nbenefits are savings in vehicle operating cost, including reduced maintenance costs and savings in \ntravel time for passengers and goods. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Erdenet \nwater  supply  subcomponent  is  29.4%,  higher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital \nassumed at 12.0%. The overall EIRR of all subcomponents, including sanitation and on-plot facility \nimprovements for Erdenet, is estimated at 40.9%, which includes water supply benefits as well as \nhealth and employment benefits. The EIRR for the Hailaast subproject for urban road improvement \nin Ulaanbaatar is 18.0%. The economic analysis is in Appendix 15.   \n \nG.  Project Risks and Mitigation Measures \n60.  The Project does not have any unusual technical risks. Conventional engineering designs \nwith  proven  records  of  reliable  performance  are  adopted  for  water  supply,  wastewater \nmanagement, solid waste management, and roads. The ICB equipment procurement will include \ntechnical  support  for  installation,  testing,  and  commissioning  as  recommended  by  the \nmanufacturer.  During  project  implementation,  the  PMU  will  support  the  PIUs  to  ensure  that \nequipment and civil works comply with design requirements and quality standards. \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", " 17\n61.  Two  potential  risks  have  been  identified.  The  first  is  the  possibility  of  delays  in  the \nformulation of the remaining subprojects and project implementation caused by weak institutional \ncapacity of the PIUs. Considerable preparatory work has been undertaken for the subprojects and \ninstitutional development for the PIUs will be provided during project implementation to mitigate \nthis risk. The second risk is the possibility of delays in undertaking operational improvements along \nwith revision of the tariff structure for water supply and wastewater collection. To facilitate tariff \ncollection based on the proposed tariff structure, a substantial number of water meters will be \ninstalled under the Project for apartment dwellers, public and private organizations, ger area water \nkiosks, and ger area households when they are connected. In addition, the project management \nconsultants will assist the aimag governments in institutionalizing the tariff review process and \nconducting regular tariff reviews.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n62.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n63.  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, MCUD will cause the relevant aimag governments, \nin consultation with ADB to commence a review and provide recommendations on the revision of \nlocal regulations relating to management of the water supply and sanitation systems, effective tariff \ncollection, and water loss reduction and metering. \n \n64.  Prior to entering into an OLA with a PUSO, the Government will cause, through the SLAs, \neach aimag government to improve each PUSO\u2019s overall effectiveness by developing a priority \nreform and efficiency policy, including such matters agreed between the Government and ADB. \nDuring project implementation, MCUD will review each current management contract between a \nPUSO and the relevant aimag government, and its surrounding policy and legal framework, and \nbased upon such review make recommendations for reform. \n \n65.  MCUD will cause each aimag government to ensure that (i) water supply and wastewater \ntariffs  for  all  users  are  restructured  to cover  all  costs  associated  with  the services  provided; \n(ii) each PUSO undertakes annual reviews of tariffs and fees; (iii) no entity receiving water supply \nand wastewater collection services is exempt from payment of the tariff or excused for delays in \npayments without penalty; and (iv) a review is conducted of the impact of increased water and \nwastewater tariffs on the poor, taking into account the ability of consumers, particularly vulnerable \npeople, to pay for such increases. After the review, MCUD will make recommendations on lifeline \nwater tariffs to the poor.  \n \n66.  For the Erdenet subproject, the Government will cause the aimag government to cause the \nCity Maintenance Local State-owned Entity to (i) prepare an action plan and budget for improving \nsolid waste collection and disposal in compliance with all environmental laws, and (ii) apply the \nsolid waste collection trucks to be supplied under the Project to the action plan. \n \n67.  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, UMG will commence preparation of the UMG road \nsafety guidelines and action plan. UMG will implement such guidelines and action plan during \nproject implementation.

\n   \nURBAN DEVELOPMENT SECTOR POLICY AND INVESTMENT PLAN \n \nA.  Urban Development Sector Policy \n1.  The Government\u2019s urban development policies are expressed in a number of documents \nthat relate to human settlement issues. The 1995 medium term strategy was the first important \npost-socialist statement on urban development in Mongolia. It recognized that the Government \ndoes not have the necessary resources to replace the growing number of ger (traditional tent) area \nhouses  with  subsidized  apartments,  and  concluded  that  greater  encouragement  of  individual \ninitiative in the urban development sector is needed if Mongolia\u2019s urban problems are to be \naddressed. The Government\u2019s 2003 strategy for economic growth support and poverty reduction \ncalled for narrowing income gaps, reducing disparities in living conditions, and creating enabling \nenvironments to support small and medium-sized enterprise development for both urban and rural \nsettlements.   \n \n2.  The urban policy implications from the Government\u2019s action plan for 2004\u20132008 call for: \n(i) upgrading the quality of public service by strengthening the capacity and accountability of public \nservice institutions and civil servants, expanding civil participation at all levels of decision making, \nand ensuring transparency; (ii) deepening legal reforms in all spheres of political, economic, and \nsocial life; and substantially improving the standards to ensure human rights and create a safe \nliving  environment;  (iii)  sustaining  private  sector  led,  stable,  and  higher  economic  growth; \n(iv) conducting social policy targeted at improving the living standards of families and households, \nand providing them with a favorable legal environment, adequate infrastructure, and financial \nenvironment to accumulate savings; and to own, possess, and dispose of immovable property \n(such as land and houses); (v) carrying out human development policy aimed at educating citizens \nwho respect education, culture, and national traditional heritage, and are highly conscious about \nprotection of the environment; and (vi) intensifying residential construction based on standards, \nreducing harmful waste, and providing ecological education to residents.  \n \n3.  Within the framework of the action plan, the Government has developed a program to \nprovide 40,000 families with opportunities to live in houses with proper facilities (40,000 Houses \nProgram).  The  program  has  three  main  components:  (i)  new  apartments  (10,000  units), \n(ii) moderately  priced  housing  (15,000  units),  and  (iii)  improvement  in  ger  area  housing  and \ninfrastructure (15,000 units). The Ministry of Construction and Urban Development has accorded \nhigh priority to the 40,000 Houses Program and plans to implement it through domestic resources \nand  external  assistance.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  achieving  the  target  of  improving \ninfrastructure for 15,000 ger area households, but will also help achieve the 15,000 target of \nmoderately priced housing through small loans for on-plot facility improvements. \n \n4.  The  urban  development  and  housing  strategy,  developed  under  technical  assistance \nfinanced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB),1 provides direct support to the Government\u2019s \nAction Program for 2004\u20132008 and its achievement of the 40,000 Houses Program. Both the \nstrategy and the Government\u2019s program provide the basis for the Project, with particular focus on \nger area upgrading. Ger area upgrading proposed under the strategy is expected to initiate a \nmethodology that can be replicated across urban centers throughout Mongolia. The methodology \naims to encourage local initiative, support public and private collaboration, share costs in an \naffordable  and  equitable  manner,  and  enable  the  greatest  physical  improvement  to  be \naccomplished at the lowest possible cost. It links infrastructure and on-plot facility improvement in a \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Sector Legal Aspects \n5.  To broaden and increase public participation in the budgetary process, the Government \npassed the public sector management and finance law in June 2002, and implementation began in \nJanuary 2003. The law took over 4 years to design under the public administration reform program, \nand marks a watershed in the national finance and budgeting process. It replaces the former \nbottom-up budgeting process from the soum (district) to aimag (province) to central Government, \nwith  a  combined  bottom-up  and  top-down  approach.  There  are  two  main  parts  to  the  law: \n(i) improvement of the national finance and budgeting process, and (ii) overall improvement of \npublic administration. \n \n6.  Under the law, the budgeting process is essentially a two-stage iterative process. The first \nstage is based on a national fiscal framework statement containing preliminary budget proposals. \nThe second stage is comprised of final budget estimates and based on strategic business plans, \nthe investment components of which are the budget organizations\u2019 Public Investment Programs \n(PIPs) and portfolio ministries\u2019 budgets approved by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The first phase \nbegins before 1 March of each year preceding the budget year, after MOF has developed a fiscal \nframework statement containing draft budget limitations based on macroeconomic indicators (e.g., \nconsumer  price  inflation,  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  growth,  etc.).  The  draft  budget \nlimitations are submitted to the portfolio ministries, aimag governments, the Prime Minister\u2019s office, \nand the governor of the Bank of Mongolia. Draft strategic business plans are also developed by all \nbudget organizations and submitted to their respective portfolio ministries. After checking and \nrefining the various strategic business plans, the portfolio ministries submit them to MOF along with \ntheir own budget proposals. MOF negotiates with each portfolio ministry on their draft strategic \nbusiness plans and proposed budget, including their PIPs; finalizes the draft medium-term draft \ndocument of the fiscal framework statement and appreciation requests; and submits them to the \nCabinet. After approval by the Cabinet, the medium-term fiscal framework statement is submitted \nto parliament no later than 1 May, parliament spring session. Once the fiscal framework statement \nand financial indicators are approved by parliament, they are sent back to the portfolio ministries. \n \n7.  The second phase begins when general managers of all budget organizations submit next \nyear\u2019s appropriation estimates and draft strategic business plans to the portfolio ministries no later \nthan 1 July. After negotiating with their budget organizations, portfolio ministries submit next year\u2019s \nfinal appropriation estimates and draft strategic business plans to MOF no later than 15 August. \nRelevant departments of MOF review the appropriation estimates and negotiate with each portfolio \nministry.  MOF  subsequently  compiles  the  portfolio  appropriation  estimates  and  medium-term \neconomic and financial objectives, and submits them to Cabinet no later than 15 September. After \nit approves, Cabinet submits the draft general guidelines for socioeconomic development, and the \nstate budget proposal and appropriation estimates for each portfolio ministry to Parliament no later \nthan 1 October of the preceding fiscal year. Parliament must pass the budget no later than \n1 December. Article 33.2.4 of the law also states that each component of the approved budget by \nParliament must be approved. \n \nC.  Urban Development Sector Strategy for 2004\u20132008 \n8.  The  primary  objective  of  the  urban  development  sector  strategy  is  to  support  the \ngovernment action plan for 2004\u20132008 and its goal of the 40,000 Houses Program. A major effort \nof the strategy is aimed at making visible, tangible, and affordable improvements in the living \n ", "    Appendix 2       25  \n   \nconditions of urban households, especially ger area households. A multifaceted approach will be \nintroduced, tested, and expanded by the application of the strategy. It will provide affordable and \nquality improvements to ger areas that meet legal requirements, and provide households with a \nrecognized financial asset that can be used as collateral for obtaining a small loan. It will also \nsupport  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  privatize  urban  land  and  improve  the  quality  of  urban \ndevelopment through understandable and affordable regulations. Simple, illustrated codes and \nzoning regulations will be applied, and local builders will be trained in their use. Finally, the strategy \nwill target housing finance to moderate income households that are eager to improve their housing. \n \n9.  The  five  goals  were  established  under  the  strategy:  (i)  implementation  of  the  40,000 \nHouses Program, (ii) restructuring ger area neighborhoods and their urban services, (iii) low cost \nalternative  infrastructure  and  services,  (iv)  infill  and  mixed  income  housing  areas,  and \n(v) establishment of an independent housing finance institution. \n \nD.

Step 1: Identification and Selection \n1.  The Ministry of Construction and Urban Development (MCUD) will invite aimag (province) \ngovernments  and  the  Ulaanbaatar  municipal  government  (UMG)  to  express  their  interest  in \nparticipating in the Project to be financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and to propose \nsubprojects for financing. In issuing this invitation, MCUD will refer to the following basic selection \ncriteria:  \n \n(i)  Component A: Improvement of Basic Urban Services \n \n(a)  There is a prospect for rapid population growth or significant population lives \nin ger areas in the proposed subproject town. \n(b)  The subproject\u2019s components are included in city of sector master plans for \nthe relevant aimag. \n(c)  The  subproject  is  not  categorized  as  category  A  or  category  B \nenvironmentally sensitive under ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy (2002). \n(d)  The subproject avoids or minimizes resettlement temporary or permanent. \n(e)  Plots in ger areas have been privatized or the legal right for residents to \nacquire legal title to such plots exists. \n(f)  Raw water sources are or will be available from an aquifer with a reliable and \nadequate yield and acceptable quality of supply, except to the extent it \nrequires disinfection. \n(g)  The  relevant  PUSO  delivers  a  certificate  of  incorporation,  or  equivalent \nestablishment document (including an explanation of its ownership). \n(h)  The  relevant  aimag  government  provides  a  demonstrated  ability  and \nwillingness  to  implement  tariff  reforms  that  ensure  cost  recovery  and \naffordability for poor households. \n(i)  The  relevant  aimag  government  provides  a  demonstrated  ability  and \nwillingness  to  finance  and  provide  adequate  funds  for  operation  and \nmaintenance of the project facilities. \n \n(ii)  Component B: Urban Road Improvement \n \n(a)  The subproject\u2019s components are included in city or sector master plans for \nUlaanbaatar city. \n(b)  The  subproject  is  not  categorized  as  category  A  or  category  B \nenvironmentally sensitive under ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy (2002). \n(c)  The subproject avoids or minimizes resettlement temporary or permanent. \n(d)  The proposed subproject connects a ger area in the outskirts of the city with \nthe city center or is located in the city center. \n(e)  The proposed road section has sufficient road users to justify the economic \nviability of the proposed subproject and is expected to have a significant \ntraffic volume upon completion, sufficient for its economic viability. \n(f)  UMG is committed to finance to provide adequate funds to operate and \nmaintain the project roads. \n \n2.  For those subprojects meeting all of the above selection criteria, MCUD will ask the relevant \nlocal aimag governments and UMG to undertake detailed subproject preparation as follows: \n \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \nB.  Step 2: Subproject Preparation \n3.  Selected  aimag  governments  and  UMG  will  prepare  a  detailed  subproject  proposal, \nfeasibility study, initial environmental examination, and resettlement plan, where applicable, to \nstandards necessary to meet both domestic and ADB requirements. Aimag governments and UMG \nwill also determine suitable institutional arrangements for subproject implementation and prepare \ncost estimates and a detailed financing plan. To facilitate an orderly and consistent appraisal of the \nsubprojects,  MCUD  will  require  an  integrated  feasibility  study  in  a  common  format  for  each \nproposed subproject. Such format has been used for preparation of the core subprojects and \nincludes  (i)  a  deficiency  analysis  and  options  study  for  sustainable  solutions;  (ii)  preliminary \nengineering designs and cost estimates; (iii) an assessment of financial and economic viability and \nsustainability; (iv) the identification of necessary reforms; (v) environmental screening, and the \npreparation of an initial environmental examination where necessary; and (vi) a social impact \nassessment and resettlement plans where necessary. \n \nC.  Step 3: Appraisal and Approval \n4.  Separate evaluation criteria were developed for water supply, wastewater, and solid waste \nmanagement  subprojects,  and  urban  road  improvement  subprojects, to  ensure  that  individual \nsubproject appraisal is conducted in accordance with ADB standards. The evaluation criteria are \ndescribed below. \n \n1.  Component A: Improvement of Basic Urban Services \n5.  The criteria include the following: \n \n(i)  The  proposed  subproject  responds  to  major  project  policy  dialogue  issues  of \n(a) promoting improved infrastructure in ger areas; (b) raising living conditions in ger \nareas; (c) providing institutional strengthening, public awareness, and training; and \n(d) conserving water resources and reducing environmental pollution.  \n(ii)  Institutional  arrangements  to  implement  the  proposed  subproject,  that  are \nsatisfactory to the Government and ADB have been proposed.  \n(iii)  The proposed subproject\u2019s technical plans and designs respond to the Project\u2019s \nobjectives and anticipated benefits.  \n(iv)  The proposed subproject\u2019s preliminary engineering design applies the least-cost \nsolution.  \n(v)  The  proposed  subproject  complies  with  (a)  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  and \nassociated operational procedures, (b) the Government\u2019s environmental laws and \nregulations, and (c) the environmental assessment review framework.  \n(vi)  An initial environmental examination has been prepared for the proposed subproject \nin  accordance  with  (a)  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  and  associated  operational \nprocedures, (b) the Government\u2019s environmental laws and regulations; and (c) the \nproject\u2019s  environmental  assessment  review  framework;  and  approved  by  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  Appropriate  and  adequate  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring plans are established to avoid, minimize, mitigate and/or compensate for \nany environmental impacts.  \n(vii)  The proposed subproject will not have a significant1 involuntary resettlement impact, \nand if land acquisition is required for a proposed subproject, a Resettlement Impact \nPlan will be prepared for the subproject in accordance with (a) ADB\u2019s Involuntary \n                                                 \n1  \u201cSignificant\u201d means 200 or more people will experience major impacts, which are defined as (i) having physically \ndisplaced from housing, or (ii) losing 10% or more of their productive assets (income generating). \n ", "Appendix 4       29 \nResettlement  and  associated  operational  procedures,  (b)  Mongolia\u2019s  laws  and \nregulations,  and  (c)  the  resettlement  framework,  in  order  to  avoid,  minimize, \ncompensate, or rehabilitate any non-resettlement related impacts.  \n(viii)  The proposed subproject has viable economic cost-benefit and economic internal \nrates of return.  \n(ix)  The proposed subproject has a viable financial internal rate of return.  \n(x)  The financial sustainability of the proposed subproject has been established by a \nfinancial  management  assessment  of  the  relevant  public  urban  services \norganization. \n(xi)  The sustainable operation and management of the proposed subproject has been \nestablished by an institutional capacity assessment of the relevant public urban \nservices organization. \n \n2.

Project Steering Committee \n3.  A project steering committee (PSC), under the leadership of MCUD, will be established to \nprovide policy guidance during project implementation, and to ensure close coordination of the \nProject  with  ongoing  urban  infrastructure  projects  in  Mongolia.  The  PSC  will  comprise \nrepresentatives from MCUD; Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Nature and Environment; National \nCenter  for  Construction,  Urban  Development,  and  Public  Utilities;  Ulaanbaatar  municipal \ngovernment (UMG); and participating aimag (province) governments. In particular, the PSC will be \nresponsible for (i) setting policy guidelines for improving project implementation, (ii) coordinating at \nthe  policy  level  with  other  government  departments,  (iii)  reviewing  and  approving  annual \nimplementation  plans,  (iv)  monitoring  project  implementation  progress,  and  (v)  overseeing \nprocurement activities and awarding of contacts.    \n \n3.  Project Management Unit \n4.  A project management unit (PMU) will be established in MCUD to manage the Project as a \nwhole and to coordinate the work of the project implementation units (PIUs) for each subproject. \nThe PMU will comprise a staff of six full-time professionals and three support staff, based in \nUlaanbaatar.  Professional  staff  will  include  (i)  a  project  manager  and  urban  planner,  (ii)  a \nmicrofinance specialist, (iii) a construction and supervising engineer, (iv) a community organizer \nand trainer, (v) a procurement specialist, and (vi) an accountant. Primary functions of the PMU will \nbe to provide the focal point for reporting to the Government and ADB on project implementation; \nto guide and monitor the performance and outputs of the PIUs; and to arrange procurement \nprocessing for civil works and equipment, particularly in respect of goods required under the \nProject. \n \n4.   Project Implementation Units \n5.  PIUs will be established in each project town and UMG to coordinate the preparation and \ndevelopment  of  the  subprojects  under  the  general  direction  of  the  PMU.  The  PIUs  will  be \nresponsible  for  all  aspects  of  subproject  implementation,  including  working  with  project \nstakeholders, maintaining subproject accounts, clearing environmental examinations, monitoring \nsubproject performance, and submitting timely progress reports. The PIU in Erdenet will be staffed \nby  (i)  a  director  and  construction  manager,  (ii)  a  finance  and  accounting  specialist,  (iii)  a \nconstruction supervisor and inspector, (iv) a community development specialist, and (v) a secretary \n ", "34  Appendix 7 \nand translator. The PIU for the urban road improvement component in Ulaanbaatar will comprise \n(i) a  director  and  roads  engineer,  (ii)  a  construction  engineer,  (iii)  an  accountant,  and  (iv)  a \nsecretary and translator. \n \n6.  The PIUs will be supported by international and national consultants to (i) carry out public \nawareness and education campaigns, (ii) provide technical and practical training, (iii) establish and \nsupport  the  development  and  operation  of  community  groups,  (iv)  promote  community \nparticipation,  (v)  encourage  financial  planning,  and  (vi)  conduct  participatory  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  \n \n5.   Subproject Working Groups \n7.  Each  subproject  will  involve  continuous  participation  by  the  principal  stakeholders.  A \nworking  group  will  be  formed  to  facilitate  communication  among  subproject  participants  and \ninterface with the local government on a regular basis. The working group for components A and C \nwill be chaired by the aimag governor and includes representatives from the aimag government, \nPIU, public urban services organization (PUSO), local governments, nongovernment organizations, \ncommunity-based organizations, and local banks and nonbanking financial institutions (NBFIs). \nThe working group for component B will be chaired by the mayor of Ulaanbaatar and includes \nrepresentatives from the Road Department of UMG, PIU, and participating district governments. \nThe working groups will report on subproject progress and resolve any minor difficulties that might \noccur during implementation. The working groups will also serve as the first arbiter to address and \nresolve  any  problems  or  grievances  with  residents,  including  issues  related  to  temporary \nresettlement.   \n \n6.   Local Governments \n8.  The Road Department of UMG and aimag governments in the subproject towns will be \nresponsible for timely disbursements from the ADB loan to implement their subprojects and for \nproviding local government support and counterpart staff to work with the PIUs. Local governments \nwill also be responsible for maintaining an open dialogue with the community and for increasing \npublic awareness about the subproject.  \n \n7.   Public Urban Service Organizations \n9.  The local PUSOs will be responsible for all water resource, supply and distribution, and \nsewerage and wastewater treatment subcomponents of the subprojects, and, in some cases, \nmanagement of solid waste. They will be the ultimate borrowers of funds for the facilities improved \nunder component A of the Project. The capacity of these local institutions to implement their parts \nof the subprojects will be strengthened under component D of the Project.  \n \n8.   Community-Based Organizations \n10.  Implementation of community and household initiatives under component C will require a \nlead time of 1\u20132 years to allow time for the mobilization and strengthening of the participating \ninstitutions  (community-based  organizations,  NBFIs,  nongovernment  organizations,  savings \ngroups, etc.). Time will also be required to instill community awareness and responsibility for small-\nscale  improvements  to  be  financed  by  the  community  and  individual  loans  (individual  water \nconnections,  minor  housing  improvements,  on-plot  sanitation  and  heating  improvements, \ngreenhouses, etc.).  \n \n \n ", "Appendix 7       35 \n9.  Savings Groups \n11.  Savings  groups  are  a  recent  and  growing  phenomenon  in  ger  (traditional  tent)  area \ncommunities. They provide an important new vehicle through which to empower women and \nfinance very small scale housing improvements. They will be instrumental in making the small \nloans for energy efficient stoves and compost toilets.  \n \n  10.  Commercial Banks and Nonbanking Financial Institutions \n12.  Under component C, loans will be made available to commercial banks and NBFIs to \nestablish small loan facilities to individuals and communities in ger areas. The PMU will determine \nand finalize initial eligibility criteria for the participating banks and NBFIs, and terms and conditions \nof small loans for end users during project implementation. They will be reviewed and endorsed by \nthe Ministry of Finance and MCUD, and submitted to ADB for approval. \n \nB.   Stakeholder Organization Chart \n13.  The following (Figure A7.1) indicates the basic relationships among stakeholders at both \nthe national and local levels. The PIUs will help form the bridge between the national and local \nlevels through regular communication with the PMU. They will be responsible for much of the \nsubproject level monitoring. Both the PMU and PIUs will have designated staff responsible for the \nProject. The working groups will ensure that subproject issues and progress are addressed on a \nregular basis, communicated to local government authorities, and any disputes are resolved. They \nwill also help ensure the coordination of activities among all stakeholders.   \n \n \n \nFigure A7.1:   Stakeholder Organization Chart \n \n \n \nADB  MOF\n \nMCUD  \nNational Level\n \nProject Steering Committee \n                                                \n \nInternational Consultants \n           P  M   U                                                                               \n                       \nNational Consultants \n \n \n                                   \n \n \nAimag Government  PIU PIU PIU\n \nUlaanbaatar Municipal Government \n \nPIU PIU\n \nWorking Group \nLocal Level\n \nBanks/NBFIs\n \n   \nPUSO  NGOs\n      \n   \nResidents  CBOs\n     \n \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CBO = community-based  organization, MCUD = Ministry of Construction and \nUrb an Development, MOF = Ministry of Finance, NBFI = non-bank financial institution, NGO = nongovernment \norganization, PIU = project implementation unit, PMU = project management unit, PUSO = public urban services \n \norganization. \n ", "36  Appendix 8 \n                                          \n2                                            \n1\n0\n2\n                                          \n                                          \n                                          \n1                                            \n1\n0\n2\n                                           nt.  \ne\n                                           m\ne\ne\n                                           gr\na\n0                                             n \n1 a\n0 o\n2                                            y l\nar\ndi\n                                           si\nb\n                                           u\ns\n E 09                                             A = \nL 20                                            SL\nDU nt, \nE                                            me\nH\ne\nC                                            e\nS 8                                             gr\nON  200                                            ng a\nTI                                            ndi\nA e\nT                                            onl\nN 7  = \nEME 200                                                                                 OLA \nPL                                            nit, \nIM 006                                             ent u\n2 m\n                                           e\ng\na\nn\n   Item  Activity Project Preparation   -  Establish PMU & PIU   -  Recruit Consultants   -  Complete SLA and OLAs   -  Preliminary Study for Ulaanbaatar Roads Component A: Basic Urban Services Component B: Urban Roads Erdenet and Hailaast in Ulaanbaatar 1.

Introduction \n1.  The resettlement framework (RF) sets out compensation and other entitlements for all \naffected  persons.  It  also  outlines  the  necessary  steps  to  prepare  satisfactory  subproject \nresettlement plans (RPs). Core subprojects have been conceived and planned to avoid or minimize \nresettlement. All resettlement impacts for the core subprojects will be updated based on the \ndetailed engineering design. RPs for noncore subprojects will be prepared based on detailed \ndesign. \n \nB.  Resettlement Impacts \n2.  It is anticipated that land acquisition and resettlement will not be very significant. Some \nhouses, gers (traditional tents), and fences will need to be relocated for the core subproject in \nHailaast for the urban road improvement component in Ulaanbaatar. The Hailaast core subproject \nwill affect 38 households in total. There will be no resettlement in the core subproject in Erdenet for \nthe  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management  subcomponents.  For  the  noncore \nsubprojects, some will require RPs to address minor resettlement impacts.  \n \nC.  Policy and Legal Framework \n3.  The RF has been prepared in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995) and the Government\u2019s two recent laws related to land: (i) the Law \nof Mongolia on Land, effective 7 June 2002; and (ii) the Law on the Allocation of Land to Mongolian \nCitizens for Ownership, effective 27 June 2002. Neither existing legislation in Mongolia nor ADB\u2019s \npolicy  require  formal  legal  title  to land  for affected  persons  to be  eligible for  entitlements or \nassistance.  Market  values  will  be  used  to  compensate  for  acquiring  plots  and  buildings.  A \nparticipatory approach will be adopted to grievance resolution through information disclosure and \ndiscussions with affected communities. \n \nD.  Entitlements \n4.  The household occupying the plot will be entitled to full compensation from resettlement. \nThe households will be compensated for their relocation costs, given assistance to find suitable \nhousing, or allocated a plot without charge. Local governments will identify, consult with, and \nformulate special measures for vulnerable residents; and include these in the RPs. \n \nE.  Procedures for Formulating Resettlement Plans \n5.  The key procedures and steps for preparation of the RPs for the noncore subprojects \ninclude  the  following:  (i)  identify  scope  (check  categorization);  (ii)  conduct  investigation  and \ninventory survey; (iii) prepare draft RP; (iv) disclose the draft RP and consult with the affected \npersons; (v) finalize the RP, obtain local government endorsement, and submit to ADB for review \nand  approval;  (vi)  disclose  the  approved  RP  (locally  and  on  ADB\u2019s  website);  and  (vii)  pay \ncompensation and relocate people to new plots prior to award of civil works. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n6.  The project management unit (PMU) will ensure that participating local governments and \nUlaanbaatar municipal government (UMG) formulate satisfactory RPs, and are responsible for \noverall resettlement management and coordination, internal monitoring, and quarterly reporting to \n   ", "40  Appendix 10 \nADB. The project implementation units (PIUs) will take primary responsibility for any resettlement \nconsultation, notices, implementation, and timely delivery of entitlements. \n \nG.  Consultation and Participation \n7.  Local  governments  and  UMG  will  meet  and  consult  with  the  affected  households  to \nincorporate their concerns and suggestions into the RPs. Decisions reached by these consultations \nwill be recorded with responsibility and timelines for their implementation. Each RP will include a \nlist of the public consultations conducted and planned. Resettlement information will be disclosed \nto all affected households during RP preparation, and their views and opinions will be incorporated \nin finalizing the RPs. Affected persons will be closely consulted and will participate in the selection \nof new plots and restoration of livelihoods. \n \nH.  Eligibility Provisions \n8.  All  affected  persons  will  be  entitled  to  compensation  and  rehabilitation.  Nevertheless, \neligibility to receive compensation and other assistance will be limited by a cutoff date. This date \nwill correspond to the approval date by the Citizen\u2019s Representative Khural (assembly) for each \nsubproject. Notification of the cutoff date, which defines \u201celigibility\u201d and \u201caffected persons\u201d, will be \nposted in the affected neighborhoods. \n \nI.  Grievance Redress Mechanism \n9.  Related  Mongolian  laws  provide  a  mechanism  for  affected  persons  to  present  their \ngrievances. The working group to be established in each project town and Ulaanbaatar will serve \nas the initial committee for grievance redress, and will provide an open forum for raising objections \nand holding discussions to resolve conflicts. The working group will record its deliberations and \ninform the concerned parties within 1 week of its findings and recommendations. These findings \nwill be presented for action to the aimag (province) and soum (district) governors for the water \nsupply, sanitation, and solid waste management subcomponents; and the city mayor and district \ngovernors for the urban road improvement component in Ulaanbaatar. \n \nJ.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n10.  The  PIUs will  monitor  implementation  of  the  RPs.  Each  RP  will include indicators  for \ninternal  and  external  monitoring.  The  PIUs  will  conduct  their  own  internal  monitoring  of \nresettlement implementation and submit monthly reports to the PMU. The PMU will include the \nresults of the internal monitoring in its quarterly reports to ADB. The PMU will engage a private firm \nor  nongovernment  organization  as  an  external  monitor.  External  monitoring  reports  will  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB  semiannually.  Investigation  should  be  carried  out  during  resettlement \nimplementation and evaluations should be conducted 1 year after the affected households have \nbeen resettled.  \n \nK.  Resettlement Budget \n11.  Local governments and UMG will be responsible for providing adequate funds for land \nacquisition and resettlement related to the Project. Detailed estimates will be prepared during \ndetailed subproject design, verified by the PMU, and included in the budget of local governments \nand UMG as part of their contributions to the Project. The resettlement budget will include the \ncosts for land acquisition, compensation, relocation, and livelihood and income restoration and \nimprovement. The estimate of resettlement costs for the Hailaast core subproject at the time of \nappraisal is about $89,000. \n ", "    Appendix 11       41  \n   \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \nContribution of the urban development sector to reduce poverty in Mongolia: \n \nGiven that the majority of poor urban households live in ger (traditional tent) areas, the Project will have a significant \nimpact on poverty reduction. To reduce poverty, the primary objective of the Project is to improve the living conditions \nand quality of life for the poor living in ger areas. The Project will do so through the (i) expansion and provision of basic \nurban services to ger areas where well over half of Mongolia\u2019s urban poor residents live; (ii) tariff reform to lower service \ncharges to affordable levels for ger area residents; and (iii) promotion of low-cost, alternative infrastructure solutions, \nincluding compost toilet systems and energy efficient stoves, which are affordable to poor ger area residents. The \nProject is designed to have multidimensional impacts on poverty reduction. While infrastructure is provided, the Project \nwill simultaneously (i) increase access to micro-credit for on-plot improvements, (ii) create direct short-term employment \nfor construction and indirect long-term income generating opportunities, and (iii) empower poor residents in decision-\nmaking  processes  through  the  establishment  of  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  to  plan  and  implement \ncommunity infrastructure projects. \n \nThe expected outcomes of the Project satisfy several of the goals for poverty reduction of the Government and Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Mongolia (2006\u20132008)a adopts the Government\u2019s \ntwo key objectives of higher private sector led growth and inclusive social development, the latter of which encompasses \nthe Government\u2019s priority goals of improving the quality of public services and their accessibility for the poor. These \ngoals derive from the Economic Growth Support and Poverty Reduction Strategy, finalized in 2003. Improved access to \nurban services is among the immediate targets that the Project will help to realize. Specifically, the Project will (i) reduce \nthe numbers of urban poor in substandard housing by 2008; and (ii) increase coverage of water, improved sanitation, \nheating, and improved transportation.  \n \nThe proposed Project will also contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, to which the \nGovernment and ADB are committed. In particular, the Project will move Mongolia closer towards achieving Millennium \nDevelopment Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability. The Project will help achieve the three main targets of Goal 7: \n(i) Target 9: Provide information, education, and communication in the proper use of water and sanitation; (ii) Target 10: \nExtend safe water supply networks to underserved urban areas, benefiting ger area households without proper water \nsupply; and (iii) Target 11: Achieve a significant improvement in the lives of the ger area population by implementing a \ncomprehensive and coordinated public and private investment approach, and subproject towns will undergo a major \ntransformation of their ger areas. \n \nThe use of small loans to buy or improve existing stoves, following on the experience of the World Bank project for \nsmokeless stoves, will reduce fuel consumption and have a direct impact on reducing poverty by increasing the \ndisposable income of poor households. The World Bank\u2019s Improved Stove Project demonstrated that low-cost stove \nimprovements can reduce carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions by 54% and coal consumption by 35\u201340%. Households \n2\ncurrently consume 5\u201310 tons of coal per year for an average cost of $22 per ton. With an improved stove, annual coal \nconsumption will be reduced to 3\u20136 tons, which will result in a savings of $44\u2013$88 per year per family, or overall annual \nsavings of $1.82 million. \n \nLabor Savings: Improvement in water supply under component A will ensure the availability of water on a daily basis \nand eliminate the need for an additional two hours to fetch water per family per week. On an annual basis, the time \nsavings would amount to approximately 0.43 person-months for each household, which translates to an economic value \nof $40 per family. These labor savings would be felt most acutely by children and women, who are primarily responsible \nfor gathering water. Households will also experience labor savings with improved stoves. They currently spend on \naverage 6.9 hours per week collecting and preparing fuel for heating. Assuming that reduction in fuel consumption by \n40% equates to a comparable reduction in the time spent collecting and preparing fuel, the improved stoves would result \nin an estimated labor saving of 0.59 person-months per family per year. Assuming that the amount of time saved is used \nfor productive purposes, the resulting 0.59 person-months of saved labor could generate an average earning of $54 per \nfamily. \n \nDirect Employment:  Under components A and B of the Project, an estimated 30% of $20 million (about $6.0 million) \nwill be used for construction-related labor. Given the average annual salary of $1,100 for an unskilled laborer, an \nexpected 5,455 person-years will be created for components A and B. For component C of the Project, about 30% of the \n$3.8 million investment (about $1.1 million) will be used for labor; this amounts to 993 person-years of employment, of \nwhich about 20% will be unpaid labor of homeowners to construct individual water connections. The direct economic \nvalue of the 3,631 person-years of wage employment is thus equivalent to approximately $4.0 million, or roughly $145 \nper household.   \n ", "42  Appendix 11 \nHealth Benefits: Assuming that the project improvements could result in a 40% reduction in morbidity starting in 2012,b \nthe net present value of savings in the medical costs and foregone income associated with the absence from work for \nthe beneficiary population as a whole is an estimated $3.35 million, or roughly $122 per household (Supplementary \nAppendix K: Health Benefits and Monitoring Plan). Women and, in particular, children, who are more susceptible to \ninfectious diseases, will benefit greatly from the improved water supply and sanitation.c \n \nIndirect Employment: Improved basic infrastructure and services, and provision of small loans through the Project can \nhave a direct impact on reducing poverty by helping to increase household income and productivity through home-based \nwork. About 62% of surveyed households expressed the desire for on-plot income generating activities. The estimated \nmultiplier for income generation is $8 for every $1 of investment.d Given total ADB investment of $28.2 million, an \nestimated $226 million in income generation will result, or $581 per household. It is expected that these benefits will \naccrue equally to working age men and women, which means that each working age woman can realize an estimated \n$2,892 in income generation.   \n \nQuality of Life: In addition to the quantifiable benefits, many intangible improvements in the overall quality of life can \nalso result from the Project. These benefits will include but not be limited to reduced overcrowding, better health, \nincreased productive capacity, better prospects for education and employment for children, enhanced sense of personal \nand community safety, and enhanced sense of social and economic participation.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                    Proposed Classification: General Intervention \nMore than 36% of the total population of Mongolia lives below the poverty line, which varies from $18.58 to $25.00 per \ncapita per month.e While Ulaanbaatar has the lowest percentage of poor\u201427.3%\u2014of the urban centers, it has the \ngreatest number of poor people in the capital city. The average incidence of poverty in all aimag (province) centers is \n33.9%. In Mongolia, housing is highly correlated with poverty in urban areas. Almost 90% of the poor live in ger areas in \nUlaanbaatar and the figure is just over 80% in aimag centers. An average of 78.3% of the cities\u2019 poor residents lives in \nger areas.  \n \nIn urban areas, only a quarter of the poor have access to piped water from central sources compared with half of the \nnonpoor. Among project beneficiaries, 88% rely on trucked water (either to kiosks or delivered to houses) as their \nprimary source of water, which is lower quality and less reliable than the central piped water supply. Ger area residents \npay disproportionately high tariffs for water\u2014anywhere from MNT0.5 to MNT2.0 per liter of water, compared with \nMNT0.10 to MNT0.20 per liter among apartment dwellers. Meanwhile, per capita water consumption in ger areas is \nsignificantly lower\u2014about 4.7 liters per day (lpd) compared with the normative 240 lpd among apartment dwellers.f \nMoreover, ger area residents spend from 12\u201334 minutes on average gathering water from kiosks located an average of \n284 meters away. \n \nHeating is another differentiating factor for the rich and poor. Ger area residents primarily use highly-polluting stoves for \nheating and cooking, burning 5\u201310 tons of coal per year at an average cost of $21.67 per ton and 4\u201316 cubic meter (m3) \nof wood at an average cost of $12.14 per m3. Average household monthly expenditure on heating is about 6% of \nexpenditure or $10.36 in Erdenet.g By contrast, nonpoor families, which are predominantly apartment dwellers, spend 3\u2013\n4% of their expenditure on heating.h In addition, ger area residents also spend about 7 hours per week on average to \ncollect and prepare their fuel.   \n \nOther basic infrastructure lacking in ger areas includes sanitation, paved roads, street lighting, and drainage. Virtually all \nhouseholds use unimproved, and in many cases, dilapidated pit latrines. Ger area households suffer the negative health \nconsequences associated with unsafe drinking water, poor sanitation, little to no solid waste management, and air \npollution created by the stoves.   \n \nThe average income of poor households in aimag centers is an estimated $84.25, compared to nonpoor households, \nwhose incomes are about $221.77 on average. A breakdown of monthly income shows that households rely extensively \non informal sector income\u2014sale of agricultural and nonagricultural products together comprise almost half (48%) of \naverage income. Formal sector wages comprise just 12% of income, followed by noncash income (9%) and pension \n(8%). The unemployment rate is about 23% among the working age beneficiary population.   \n \nAlmost all interviewed households agreed that infrastructure improvements are required in the community. The top \npriority for neighborhood improvement among all subproject areas is water supply, which is the primary intervention \nproposed under component A. Other main priorities include roads, street lighting, solid waste, and sanitation. Focus \ngroup discussions reaffirmed the results of the survey. An overwhelming majority (93%) of households expressed \nwillingness to join a CBO to help plan and manage neighborhood improvements.\n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?                   Yes                   No \n ", "    Appendix 11       43  \n   \nAn analysis of the key stakeholders informed both the project preparation and design. These include: (i) ger area \nresidents, (ii) CBOs, (iii) savings groups, (iv) local governments, (v) public urban service organizations (PUSOs), \n(vi) Ministry of Construction and Urban Development, and (vii) Ministry of Finance. The stakeholder analysis defined the \nroles of each of the stakeholders and established the framework for participation at the local level of authorities and \ncommunities from the subproject selection stage through implementation.   \n \nThe Project adopted a bottom-up approach in which local governments and communities were requested to confirm their \nwillingness to participate in the Project by fulfilling a series of pre-project conditions. The submission of a project \nproposal that included ger area improvement and community participation was essential to be selected as one of the \ncore subprojects. Once core subprojects were selected, communities were engaged in project preparation through a \nhousehold survey and focus group discussions, which revealed community needs, priorities, and willingness to pay for \nimproved infrastructure and services. Other stakeholders\u2014including local government officials, community leaders, and \nthe local PUSOs\u2014were consulted extensively during field visits to develop subproject proposals that reflect the priorities \nand capacities of all key stakeholders.  \n \nThe  project  design  is  based  on  a  community-driven  approach,  at  the  core  of  which  is  the  establishment  and \nstrengthening of CBOs under component C of the Project. The primary role of the CBOs will be to serve as the \ncommunity representative to the local government, the PUSO, and the project implementation unit. The CBOs will be the \nessential facilitator for the block loans available under component C. They will serve as the intermediary between blocks \nof households that wish to take a loan from the Project for the installation of individual water connections (and on-plot \nsanitation facilities and energy efficient stoves for the individual households if desired) and the local PUSO, which will \ninstall the tertiary pipelines.   \n \nThe Project will strengthen the CBOs\u2019 capacity to plan and implement community infrastructure and income generation \nprojects. The CBOs will empower community members to make decisions about the type, location, and design of \ncommunity amenities\u2014including, initially, water kiosks, and later, income generation activities, such as community \ncenters, greenhouses, and compost facilities. As the capacity of the CBOs grows, each will evolve over time and adopt \nfurther roles based on the demands of its members. Public awareness activities and community trainings under \ncomponent D of the Project related to micro-finance, alternative sanitation and heating solutions, and improved health \nand hygiene will further engage community members and enhance the sustainability of the Project. Community \nmobilizers in each project implementation unit will assist in implementing the community participation and public \nawareness subcomponents of the Project.   \n \nD.   Gender and Development \nThe provision of potable water and other basic infrastructure will have a direct positive impact on women and children, \nand will reduce women\u2019s labor inputs and promote more effective time budgeting. Women and children, who are more \nsusceptible to infectious diseases, will experience significant health benefits with improved water supply and sanitation. \nWomen will become empowered decision makers at the household and community levels with access to credit to make \nhousing and other on-plot improvements and representation through CBOs to improve neighborhood amenities. Specific \nsteps in the Project to ensure that the intended benefits will accrue to women and that they participate fully in the Project \ninclude: (i) ensuring equal representation of women on the CBO Council to ensure that women are empowered decision \nmakers in the community, (ii) promoting health and hygiene awareness equally among men and women, (iii) ensuring \nthat qualified women have the same opportunity for construction-related labor, (iv) providing training to women in \nentrepreneurial activities on a demand-driven basis, and (v) engaging a community and gender specialist to help monitor \nand evaluate implementation of the gender action plan. \n                                                                                              \nHas an output been prepared?

Background \n1.  The Urban Development Sector Project (the Project) will benefit ger (traditional tent) area \nhouseholds that live in aimag (province) centers and are largely poor. Based on the socioeconomic \nsurvey, there is no significant evidence that female-headed households are poorer than male-\nheaded households. However, there is evidence that women share a disproportionate load of \nhousehold responsibilities. In addition to financial contributions, women are also responsible for \nmost of the household work, including cooking, cleaning, washing, shopping, and looking after \nchildren and the elderly. Men have taken a lesser role in household activities, usually fetching fuel \nand doing some minor repairs in ger areas.1 This demonstrated that women are the main users of \ninfrastructure services. In ger areas, the burden on women is compounded by a lack of basic \ninfrastructure that would normally make household work easier and more efficient. A gender action \nplan (GAP) is prepared to maximize the project impact on women. \n  \nB.  Preparation \n2.  The primary users of infrastructure will maintain it more effectively and should therefore be \ninvolved in design, operation, and management of upgrading activities. Women were actively \nengaged in the planning processes of the Project. Based on the issues identified by the gender \nassessment of project preparation, gender concerns were woven into two main components of the \npoverty and social analysis: (i) household survey; and (ii) focus group discussions, to establish a \nbaseline on gender disaggregated data that is related to informal settlement (ger area) upgrading \nand to help determine how gender concerns should be incorporated into the project design. The \nhousehold questionnaire included several questions intended to elicit specific information related to \ngender  roles,  perceptions,  and  expectations.  Focus  group  discussions  among  women  in  the \ncommunity allowed the study team to disaggregate responses by gender and ensure that the \nvoices of women in target beneficiary communities were heard.   \n \nC.  Project Benefit to Women \n3.  Women are expected derive particular benefit from the Project\u2019s proposed improvements in \ncommunity infrastructure and services as they and their children spend most of their time at home \nand in the neighborhood. The proposed Project will provide opportunities to (i) relieve time and \nlabor burdens on women created by the lack of access to basic infrastructure and services; (ii) \nimprove  women\u2019s  living  conditions,  health,  and  hygiene;  (iii)  create  employment  and  income \ngeneration opportunities for women; and (iv) empower women as decision makers through access \nto finance and active involvement in community-based organizations (CBOs).  \n \n4.  The improved daily living environment, as a result of the Project, will reduce the risk of \ninfectious diseases for women and children, while time and labor savings will result in reduced \nhousehold workloads for women and children. In turn, they will have more time to engage in \nproductive income-generating activities, home-based work, and caring for family members. Female \nheads of household will derive particular benefit from the Project. \n \n5.  Sanitation in ger area is a big challenge for women, who are primarily responsible for \nmaintaining hygiene in the home. New sanitation solutions proposed by the Project will ease the \nburdens faced by women in undertaking their household duties. By engaging men equally in \n                                                 \n1  National Statistical Office. 2004. Main Labor Force Survey Report, 2004. Ulaanbaatar. \n ", "46  Appendix 12 \ntraining related to sanitation, health, and hygiene, the Project will also attempt to alleviate the \nimbalance between women and men in bearing the burden of household responsibilities.   \n \n6.  Access  to  affordable  loans  for  on-plot  facility  improvements  will  provide  women  with \nimportant physical and financial assets that will substantially increase their status and security \nwithin the household as well as within the community. Women will become empowered decision \nmakers at the household and community levels with access to credit to make housing and other \non-plot improvements and representation through CBOs to improve neighborhood amenities.   \n \nD.

Introduction \n1.  The Project will support the Government\u2019s strategy for improvement of ger (traditional tent)1 \nareas and will be financed under a sector loan; a similar approach will be replicated across a \nnumber of  secondary towns. Erdenet has been selected as a representative core subproject \nlocation where the subcomponents of water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management will be \ndeveloped. The primary road to Hailaast ger district of Ulaanbaatar has been chosen as the core \nsubproject for improvement of urban roads. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) have been \ncarried out to assess the potential environmental impacts and risks that may arise through project \npreparation, implementation, and operation.  \n \nB.  Sector Assessment \n2.  The Government\u2019s medium term strategy adopted in 1995 recognized that the necessary \nresources are not available to replace the growing number of ger area houses with subsidized \napartments.  It  concluded  that  greater  encouragement  of  individual  initiative  in  the  urban \ndevelopment  sector  is  needed  if  Mongolia\u2019s  urban  problems  are  to  be  addressed.  The \nGovernment\u2019s action plan 2004\u20132008 has developed a program to provide 40,000 families with \nopportunities to live in houses with proper facilities. The Project will focus on urban development in \nurban areas scattered across Mongolia, characterized by open landscapes with minimal vegetation \nin steppe or desert locations. Different climatic zones result in annual precipitation varying from \n400  millimeter  to  120\u2013200  millimeter.  The  dominant  physical  environment  is  summarized  as \nmoderate to harsh.  \n \n3.  Towns  typically  comprise  a  formal  urban  centre  with  institutional  buildings,  residential \napartment blocks, roads, and service infrastructure. They also include extensive and sprawling ger \nareas  of  informal  hashaas  (residential  plots)  which  are  provided  with  only  rudimentary \ninfrastructure. Up to 90% of the total population of a town is, or in the medium term will be, resident \nin such ger areas, and approximately 70% of total households are considered poor.2 The urban \nenvironment is degrading as a result of low density of dwellings\u2014leaving much open space which \nis  not  maintained,  lack  of  sufficient  infrastructural  amenities  and  facilities,  unconfined  animal \nhusbandry, unemployment, and poor socioeconomic conditions. The primary source of potable \nwater is tanker-supplied kiosks. The average distance to collect water is 275 meter and queuing \ntimes of up to 1 hour are experienced. Ger plots typically include a simple pit latrine. Apart from \ninconvenience,  the  latrines  cause  groundwater  pollution.  The  incidence  rate  for  housing  and \nsanitation related diseases in Mongolian is 4,276 persons per 10,000.3  \n \n4.  A total of 12 species of wildlife have been registered as potentially endangered but none of \ntheir habitats is located near project areas. There are no adjacent cultural or historic sites.  \n \nC.  Overview of Sector Loan \n5.  The strategy for the Project will be to fully support the urban upgrading policies of the \nGovernment by addressing those aspects of urban infrastructure most in need of attention to \n                                                 \n1  Ger refers to the Mongolian circular tent but the term is also applied to nonformal areas of residential accommodation \nin which tents and timber structures predominate. \n2  Poverty is defined as a per capita income of not greater than $30 per month.  \n3  2005  data  from  National  Center  Health  Development,  Ministry  of  Health  include  digestive  (741  per  10,000), \ngenitourinary (676 per 10,000), and hepatitis (2,185 per 10,000).  \n ", "    Appendix 13       49  \n   \n(i) arrest further decline in conditions, and (ii) introduce basic services where there are none. The \nprimary objective of the loan will be to maintain at least current levels of service and, thus, \nincorporate the means whereby residents have the choice and facility for self-help improvements. \n \n6.  Components under the sector loan will support themes which target the following:  \n(i)  Potable water supply by (a) ensuring the source is good quality and sustainable, \n(b) providing  a  piped  connection  to  each  sales  kiosk  and  major  institutional \nestablishment to ensure continuous supply and prevent reliance on tanker trucks \nthat are old and costly to maintain, (c) providing numerous connection points from \nwhich individuals or groups of residents may construct direct plot connections, and \n(d) reducing losses and wastage through repair and metering.  \n(ii)  Sewerage connections for main institutional buildings (schools, clinics, etc.) where \nthis can be achieved by extending existing municipal wastewater systems. \n(iii)  Solid waste collection and transport to landfill in order to reduce or eliminate fly-\ntipping. \n(iv)  On-plot sanitation by suitable technologies and training to prevent reliance on pit \nlatrines. \n(v)  Creation of mechanisms for small loans for house improvements which will improve \nthermal efficiencies and reduce heating costs.  \n(vi)  Improvements to main access routes in Ulaanbaatar to improve access to public \nservices for urban residents.  \n7.  The project funds will be allocated according to individual subproject components and have \na total budgeted value of $37.6 million. \n \nD.  Summary Initial Environmental Examinations \n8.  The potential environmental consequences of each subproject have been screened to \nassess the likely impacts that should be monitored and which form the basis for the environmental \nmanagement plan. This screening was assessed under stages of project development: (i) project \npreparation and design phase; (ii) project construction phase, and (iii) operation and management \nof  the  completed  works.  The  environmental  assessment  included  consideration  of  alternative \ntechnologies and options for solution, including water resources, the means of water distribution in \nger areas, domestic sanitation and grey water disposal, sanitation and sewerage to institutional \nestablishments, and the disposal of domestic solid wastes. Least-cost solutions compatible with \neffective and sustainable service provision were selected. The IEEs also assessed the impacts that \nwere most likely to cause construction problems. These considered the creation of dust; noise; \nconflicts  of  traffic  movements;  restricted  access;  and  the  impact  on  the  town  of  numerous \nconstruction workers, including health and safety requirements. Mitigating measures are required \nmainly during the construction period and these have been identified and costed in the IEEs. The \ntotal cost allocated for these measures under the construction budgets is $342,000. \n \nE.  Environmental Assessment and Review Procedures \n9.  The environmental assessment and review procedures of potential subprojects will, among \nother things, ascertain if the subproject:  \n \n(i)  involves either water supply, wastewater, or solid waste management for the aimag \n(province) capitals, and urban roads connecting ger area with the city center or \nlocated in the city center in Ulaanbaatar; \n(ii)  conforms to an adopted relevant city or sector master plans; \n(iii)  does not have potential for significant adverse environmental impact; \n ", "50  Appendix 13 \n(iv)  is  not  environmentally  sensitive  and  will  not  result  in  increased  generation  of \nwastewater or solid waste; and \n(v)  does not require any significant resettlement, either temporary or permanent, and in \nany case not greater than 200 affected persons. \n \n10.  The Ministry of Nature and Environment is responsible for screening and approvals during \nthe subproject preparation and implementation stage while that for subsequent inspection and \nenforcement lies with the State Inspection Agency. The Asian Development Bank will review the \nIEEs and summary initial environmental examination.  \n \nF.  Environmental Management Program \n11.  The environmental management program (EMP) covers all phases of the Project from \npreparation  and  construction  to  commissioning  and  operation,  and  aims  to  ensure  control  of \npotential environmental impacts through monitoring and mitigation implementation. Separate EMPs \nwill be prepared for each subproject and will be incorporated into the construction and operation \nmanagement plans of the subproject as appropriate. The project management unit will ensure that \nthe Project\u2019s progress and impacts are monitored. Costs related to mitigation measures for the \nconstruction phase will be borne by contractors while costs for the operation phase will be borne by \nthe implementing agencies. \n \n12.  Direct public and stakeholder participation was conducted as an ongoing element of project \npreparation. Three workshops were held in Ulaanbaatar and one in Erdenet. Plans for public \ninvolvement during the design, construction, and operation phases have been developed during \nthe project preparation stage. These plans include public participation in: (i) monitoring impacts \nand  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  and  operation  stages;  (ii)  evaluating \nenvironmental and economic benefits and social impacts; and (iii) interviewing the public after the \nProject is completed.  \n \nG.  Conclusions \n13.  On a per capita basis, the Project will decrease the demands upon energy resources by the \nreplacement of a truck tanker by a piped system. The Project will specifically not increase the \nincome gap between poor and affluent sectors. It is concluded that the sector Project comprises \nsubprojects  that  may  be  classified  as  category  B  for  the  purpose  of  environmental  impact. \nHowever, because of the environmentally sensitive components such as potential for raw water \nquality,  wastewater  treatment,  and  solid  waste  management  aspects,  the  EMP  will  be  fully \nimplemented. \n ", "    Appendix 14       51  \n   \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.   Introduction \n1.  The financial analysis was prepared in accordance with the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed \nby  ADB.1 Details  of  the  financial  analysis  and  financial  projections  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix P. An assessment of financial performance was completed for the public urban services \norganizations  (PUSOs)  which  currently  operate  as  enterprises  providing  water  supply  and \nsanitation services in the urban areas. The analysis was undertaken for the core subproject in \nErdenet.  For  the  urban  roads  which  are  non-revenue  generating,  financial  sustainability  was \nassessed  based  on  the  financial  capacity  of  the  Road  Department,  Ulaanbaatar  municipal \ngovernment (UMG) to provide sufficient funds for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the \nproject roads in the future. \n   \nB.   Financial Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis \n1.   Objective and Approach \n2.  The  financial  evaluation  assessed  the  financial  performance  of  the  PUSO  following \nimplementation of the water supply and sanitation subcomponents. The evaluation determines the \nlevel of cost recovery from water users that is required to service the ADB loan and achieve \nfinancial sustainability. The financial evaluations of the subproject were carried out in real terms \nusing 2006 prices over 27 years of operations, including a 6-year implementation period. The \nresidual value of physical assets is assumed to equal the remaining book or depreciated value at \nthe end of the evaluation period.   \n \n2.   Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n3.  The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was calculated in real terms for the Project. \nFunding  sources  for  the  water  infrastructure  subcomponent  are  the  ADB  loan  (72%)  and \ncounterpart funds from the Government (28%).2 The Ministry of Finance will relend the ADB loan to \nPUSOs at 3.25% (ADB rate of 1.5% plus 1.75%).3 The local inflation rate is 6.0% per annum and \nthe international inflation rate is 2.4%. The WACC was determined to be 0.25% for the base case \nanalysis. \n \n3.   Tariffs and Affordability \n4.  The Government has a decree that provides guidelines to PUSOs on water tariff calculation \nand setting.4 However, there are no established tariff setting bodies that will review and undertake \nconsultations with users on the appropriateness of any proposed tariff increase. Hence, whenever \nPUSOs request aimag (province) approval for tariff changes, in most cases the required tariff \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. \nManila. \n2  The water infrastructure cost includes well fields, booster pumping stations, water distribution lines and water mains. \nThe ADB loan has interest rate of 1.5%, payable in 32 years with grace period of 8 years. \n3  Based on onlending terms of the Ministry of Finance to public enterprises such as PUSOs, contained in Guidelines on \nOnlending of Foreign Loans. Ministry of Finance. 26 July 2006. The onlending is the ADB rate + 1.75% minimum to \n3.00% maximum. \n4  Based on Decree on Methodology for Tariff Calculation and Setting by Ministry of Infrastructure in 2004, the \nGovernment has provided guidance on tariff calculations that PUSOs have to follow. However, their proposed tariff \nincreases have not been fully implemented by aimags, mainly for political reasons.  \n ", "52  Appendix 14 \nincreases  have  not  been  fully  implemented.  Thus,  aimags  have  to  subsidize  any  shortfall  in \nPUSOs\u2019 tariff revenues to sustain operations or pay debt obligations. \n \n5.  In Erdenet, the Erdenet PUSO currently obtains water from Erdenet Mining Corporation\u2019s \nwell field and transmission lines to supply apartments and public and private organizations, which \nconsume approximately 1,193,896 cubic meters (m3) (2005).5 The ger (traditional tent) areas are \nsupplied from small deep wells, with annual supply of about 78,191 m3. Private organizations (39% \nof  total  consumption)  and  apartments  (35%)  are  the  largest  consumers,  followed  by  budget \norganizations (20%) and ger areas (6%). Based on the tariff schedule, people in ger areas pay \nabout MNT2,000/m3 or about 10 times more than those in apartments who pay MNT210/m3.6 While \nthe high tariff is due in part to the high cost of transporting water to ger areas by tanker trucks, the \npattern  of  ger  area  households  paying  on  average  14  times  more  for  water  than  apartment \ndwellers is common in all provincial towns. \n \n6.  As shown in Table A14.1, according to existing tariffs and consumption data, the PUSO\u2019s \ngross  tariff  revenues  are  highest  for  private  organizations  with  MNT235  million  (with  highest \nconsumption) and ger areas of MNT156.38 million (with highest tariff but lowest consumption). \nApartment users consume 5.7 times more than people in ger areas but pay only MNT93.5 million. \nSince  the  PUSO  pays  MNT196.6  million  to  Erdenet  Mining  Corporation  for  apartment  water \nconsumption, about MNT103 million is subsidized by the aimag, or some MNT230/m3.   \n \nTable A14.1: Existing Tariffs and Projected Tariffs for the FIRR Analysis (MNT/m3) \nItem  Erdenet   \nActual Tariff     \nApartments       210.0  (230 lpcd) \nPublic Organizations  449.3   \nPrivate Organizations  479.3   \nGer (traditional tent) Areas  2,000.0   \nPayment to Mining Company     \nApartments  440.3   Aimag (province) subsidizes about MNT230/m3 \nPublic Organizations  383.0   \nPrivate Organizations  408.6   \nGer Areas                                                  \u2014   \nApartments  484.3      (100 lpcd) \nApartments  500.0   \nPublic Organizations  500.0   \nPrivate Organizations                            500.0   \nGer Areas                                              500.0     \nTariff Based on Full Cost Recovery   2,012.0   \nApartments  500.0   \nPublic Organizations  600.0   \nPrivate Organizations  700.0   \nGer Areas                                                500.0   \n     lpcd = liter per capita per day, m3 = cubic meter. \n     Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n7.  Existing  PUSO  tariff  revenues  are  not  adequate  to  support  services  considering  that \n(i) apartment users are subsidized at rate of about MNT230/m3; (ii) institutions and apartment \ndwellers do not fully pay the water bills to PUSOs, resulting in high accounts receivables; and \n                                                 \n5  Data used is 2005 consumption levels in Erdenet. Budget organizations are schools, hospitals, and government \noffices. They obtain their budget (including payment for water bills) directly from the state budget.  \n6  Water  billing  is  based  on  normative  consumption  for  apartments  of  230  liters  per  capita  per  day  (MNT1,453 \nperson/month). Budget and private organizations are billed based on individual contracts (e.g., schools based on \nschool population, etc.). Estimated consumption per person is 6.9 m3/month. Budget organizations and apartments are \ncharged lower water rates than private organizations. \n ", "    Appendix 14       53  \n   \n(iii) the unaccounted for water is estimated at 60% since water is not metered and billing is based \non normative consumption rates for apartment users. \n \n8.  Under the Project, a new water supply source will be developed, and water mains and \ndistribution lines will connect the major apartment areas and water kiosks in ger areas.7 Project \ncompletion will be 2012, and it is anticipated that it will lower the cost of supplying water to ger \nareas and other water users. Considering the current distortions in tariff setting, with apartments \nheavily subsidized, apartment tariffs will be gradually increased during project implementation to \neliminate subsidies and adjust tariffs to full cost recovery levels for O&M and depreciation during \nconstruction. By 2009, when loan repayment begins, tariffs must cover interest repayments. After \n2012, tariffs should cover principal repayments (or depreciation, whichever is higher) to ensure that \nthe  PUSO  can  finance  operations  and  debt  repayment  and  become  commercially  viable \nenterprises. This is reasonable since the Project will improve (i) service delivery, (ii) efficiency \ngains, (iii) tariff restructuring and reforms, and (vi) education and awareness of tariff increases. The \naffordability of households in ger areas and apartments are analyzed based on the socioeconomic \nsurvey results of household income and estimated water consumption in ger areas. Table A14.2 \nshows that poor households in ger areas with an average income of MNT82,923/month ($71.5) \npay about 2.7% of their income for water while nonpoor households with MNT270,300/month \n($232.8) pay less than 1% of their income based on actual low water consumption. Willingness to \npay is up to MNT3,000/m3 if better service, in terms of water quantity and quality, is provided. \n \nTable A14.2: Tariffs and Affordability \nItem  Erdenet \nExisting: Ger area   \nHH monthly consumption                                                1 m3 at 4.7 lpcd \nHH monthly water expense    MNT2,000 \nNonpoor HH income  MNT270,030 \nPoor HH Income  MNT82,923 \nNonpoor affordability (5% of income)                  MNT13,500 \nPoor affordability (5% of income)                              MNT4,150 \nWillingness to pay  Up to MNT3/m3 \nAffordability based on current water expense/ month   \nNonpoor HH  <1% \nPoor HH  2.4% \nGer Area Proposed Minimum, Monthly Consumption   \nHH proposed minimum monthly consumption                                      4.5 m3 at 30 lpcd \nHH monthly water expense (MNT)  MNT2,250 \n% to poor HH Income  2.7% \nApartments   \nExisting monthly expense on water@MNT210/m3 and 230 lpcd  MNT7,245 \n% of water expense to average HH income  2.7% \nHH proposed average water consumption    15m3 at 100 lpcd \nHH monthly water expense   MNT7,500 \n% of water expense to average HH Income  2.8% \n  HH = household, lpcd = liters per capita per day, m3 = cubic meter. \n  Source:  Asian Development Bank project preparatory technical assistance Socioeconomic Survey, 2006. \n \n9.  People in apartments who have higher affordability and can pay up to MNT13,500/month \n(5% of household income) are paying MNT7,245/month or 2.7% of their affordability but consuming \nmore than three times the liters per capita per day (lpcd) as people in ger areas.8 \n \n                                                 \n7  For sanitation, PUSO will connect schools, hospitals, and private organizations to main sewerage and PUSO will \ncontinue to pay to the mining company which owns the sewerage treatment plant.  \n8  With the water supply improvements, people in ger areas are assumed to consume a minimum of 30 lpcd at \nMNT500/m3 or MNT2,250/month) which is 2.7% of their monthly income. \n ", "54  Appendix 14 \n  4.  Financial Rate of Return \n10.  Estimates of the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) were made for base case and \nsensitivity scenarios which assume the required gradual tariff increases at the outset of project \nimplementation (Table A14.1). The recommended tariff increases are required to ensure that they \ncover the full cost of O&M and depreciation, interest, and principal during loan repayment. The \naimag\u2019s  tariff  review  committee  will  institute  public  consultations  to  meet  the  required  tariff \nincreases of the PUSO. The financial analysis assumes that the PUSO will be able to charge the \nfull cost recovery tariffs and undertake the operational improvements, such as reducing system \nlosses and unaccounted for water to increase water revenue, reduce accounts receivable, and \nundertake individual connections and metering during project implementation. These measures \nmust be initiated prior to project implementation to ensure the financial sustainability of the PUSO\u2019s \noperations.  Base case FIRR and financial performance indicators for the subproject are provided \nin Table A14.3. The after-tax FIRR results for Erdenet water supply compare favorably to the \nWACC of 0.25%. The subprojects are therefore financially viable based on returns to net assets, \nand the debt-service coverage ratios are adequate. \n \nTable A14.3: Summary of Financial Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis (%) \nItem  Erdenet \nBase Case  8.1 \nProject Costs, and Operation and Maintenance Costs +10%  6.5 \nRevenues -10%  6.3 \nCost +10% and Revenue -10%  4.7 \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC.

Financial Sustainability of the Road Department, Ulaanbaatar Municipal Government \n12.  The construction and rehabilitation of urban roads in Ulaanbaatar is principally financed by \nthe road fund that was established in 1991 to deposit a portion of user taxes and appropriations \nfrom the state budget, which consists of funds from fuel taxes on gasoline and diesel, state budget \nallocations, other donations and contributions, fines and fees, and miscellaneous revenues. The \nroad fund increased from MNT2.59 billion in 2000 to MNT2.82 billion in 2005; the allocation from \nthe state budget accounted for about 3% and road users\u2019 taxes accounted for about 97%. The road \nfund revenues are mainly used for road construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance of city roads; \nand partly to form part of counterpart funds for foreign-assisted road projects. In 2006, MNT3.03 \nbillion (about $2.6 million) has been requested by Road Department of UMG, of which MNT2.12 \n ", "    Appendix 14       55  \n   \nbillion is earmarked for road construction and rehabilitation while MNT909 million is earmarked for \nroad maintenance. UMG will ensure that road maintenance funding from the road fund is increased \nby at least 5% per annum from MNT909 million in 2006 to MNT1.22 billion in 2012 to be able to \nmeet the projected increase in O&M costs of the project roads, which is estimated at about \nMNT40.70 million per year (about $41,000). \n ", "56  Appendix 15 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The  economic  analysis  covers  both  the  Project  as  a  whole  and  the  individual  key \nsubprojects. It was undertaken in accordance with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Guidelines \nfor the Economic Analysis of Projects, the Handbook for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply \nProjects, and Framework for Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector \nProjects.1 For the Project as a whole, the analysis covers (i) the rationale for public intervention; \n(ii) the goals of the investment plan; and (iii) the general design of the plan, including selection \ncriteria for subprojects. The economic analysis then evaluates the typical key subprojects relative \nto the selection criteria, focusing on the least-cost analysis. During the design of the Project, \nalternative locations and specifications for the water supply and urban roads components were \nconsidered within the project area. The detailed economic analysis and least-cost analysis are in \nSupplementary Appendix L. \n \nB.  Rationale for Public Intervention \n2.  The primary motivation for the Project results from increasing concern over the effects of \npopulation  and  economic  growth  on  the  inadequacy  of  public  services  in  provincial  towns, \nparticularly the ger (traditional tent) areas. Continuing urbanization has resulted in increasing water \nshortages as well as major deficiencies in urban road network and services. The 1995 medium-\nterm  strategy  was  the  first  important  statement  on  urban  development  in  Mongolia  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  2003  Strategy  for  Economic  Growth  Support  and  Poverty  Reduction  called for \nreducing disparities in living conditions, and creating enabling environments to support small and \nmedium-sized enterprise development for both urban and rural settlements.   \n \n3.  The Government\u2019s Action Plan for 2004\u20132008 has prescribed upgrading the quality of \npublic services by strengthening the capacity and accountability of public service institutions and \ncivil  servants,  expanding  civil  participation  at  all  levels  of  decision  making  and  ensuring \ntransparency and conducting social policy targeted at improving living standards of families and \nhouseholds, providing adequate infrastructure, reducing harmful waste, and providing ecological \neducation to residents.2 In support of this plan, ADB and the Ministry of Construction and Urban \nDevelopment (MCUD) developed the Urban Development and Housing Strategy which focused on \nger upgrading that can be replicated across urban centers throughout Mongolia. The strategy links \ninfrastructure and on-plot facility improvement in a more cost-effective manner, encourages local \ninitiatives, and supports public and private collaboration in sharing improvement costs in a more \nequitable and affordable manner.3 \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila; ADB. 1999. Handbook for the Economic \nAnalysis of Water Supply Projects. Manila; and ADB. 1994. Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of \nUrban Development Sector Projects. Manila.  \n2  A consultative approach to urban development has been introduced in Ulaanbaatar and five secondary cities and \nsponsored by Cities Alliance and the World Bank. Cities Alliance and the United Nations Human Settlements \nProgramme (UN HABITAT) are currently undertaking a second project for Ulaanbaatar that will focus on developing \nthe guidelines for upgrading ger areas based on a collaborative, community driven approach. \n3  Targets  10,  11,  and  12  of  Mongolia\u2019s  Millennium  Development  Goal  Number  7,  to  \u201cEnsure  Environmental \nSustainability\u201d impact on housing and urban development, e.g., the use of smokeless stoves to reduce air pollution, \npromotion of energy efficient housing, provision of safe and dependable piped water supply, and environmentally \nsound means of sanitation. \n ", "    Appendix 15       57  \n   \nC.  Sector Policies, Sector Investment Plan, and Institutional Capacity   \n3.  Sector Policies \n4.  Within the framework of the 2004\u20132008 Action Plan, the Government has developed a \nprogram to provide 40,000 families with opportunities to live in houses with proper facilities. The \nprogram has three main components: (i) new apartments (10,000 units), (ii) moderately priced \nhousing (15,000 units), and (iii) improvement of ger area housing and infrastructure (15,000 units). \nMCUD has accorded high priority to the program and plans to implement it through domestic \nresources and external assistance. On 27 June 2005, parliament passed the \u201c40,000 Houses\u201d \nProgram Law approving the 40,000 Houses Program and making it official sector policy. The law \nsets out in detail the rationale for the Program and how it will be implemented. While previous \ngovernment strategies voiced support for investment in urban development, including the 1999 \nHousing  Policy  Law,  the  40,000  Houses  Law  provides  a  detailed  program  for  provision  and \nimprovement of on-plot facilities and urban infrastructure with particular focus on ger areas. By \nproviding water supply and sanitation facilities to 27,000 plots, the Project will overachieve the \ntarget of improving the infrastructure and housing for 15,000 ger area units and, through small \nloans for on-plot facility improvement, go a long way towards achieving the 15,000 target of \nmoderately priced housing. \n \n  2.  Sector Investment Plan \n5.  From 2006 to 2009, the Government laid out the required budget requirements for urban \ndevelopment sector, which include key improvements in urban infrastructure and services in the \nprovincial towns. The goals most directly relevant to the investment plan were formulated by the \nGovernment and approved by provincial governments in 2004. As called for in the Public Sector \nManagement and Finance Law, 2003, all provincial governments have developed three-year action \nplans under the public investment program, which have become the basis for urban infrastructure \ninvestments. MCUD has proposed allotments for MCUD under the Public Investment Program for \nspecific urban investments from 2006\u20132009 are shown in Appendix 2. Within the Plan, the Project \nis an integrated urban improvement project for the ger areas and will bring about affordable and \nquality improvements to ger households that can: (i) provide households with a sustainable and \nrecognized financial asset, (ii) support government efforts to privatize land, (iii) improve the quality \nof urban services in water supply, sanitation and road networks, and (iv) stimulate increased local \nprivate investment. \n \n6.  The Project involves government intervention at several different levels. The Government \nthrough MCUD is promoting urban development in the provincial towns in a more coordinated and \ncost-effective  manner,  and  integrating  local  government  and  beneficiary  efforts  for  more \nsustainable investments in public infrastructure. Involvement of the Government is justified since \nthe urban development program spans several provinces. The local aimag (province) governments \nare coordinating and implementing the elements of the urban master plans. The public urban \nservices  organizations  (PUSOs)  are  making  individual  investments  in  the  water  supply  and \nsanitation works, and will be involved in owning and managing the completed facilities.4 Further, \nthe  Project  promotes  a  multifaceted  effort  that  combines  city  level  improvement  in  urban \ninfrastructure with community and household initiatives that are largely financed through small \nloans. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4 The  Company  Law  (1999)  provided  for  the  corporatization  of  PUSOs  to  become  financially  and  managerially \nautonomous enterprises. \n ", "58  Appendix 15 \n  3.  Institutional Capacity \n7.  Since MCUD is a central government ministry, the investment plan will be implemented \nmainly through Ulaanbaatar municipal government (UMG) and aimag governments through local \nPUSOs. Since construction capacity is limited in outlying aimags, project implementation is usually \ncarried out by Ulaanbaatar-based construction firms. Through the system of aimag government \nand PUSOs, private contractors, and engineering consultants, MCUD has adequate capacity and \nexperience to implement the investment plan. However, for the investment plan as well as the \nProject, there is a need for institutional strengthening at the local government level, especially in: (i) \noperation  and  maintenance  of  urban  infrastructure  and  facilities;  (ii)  community  participatory \nstructures  and  process;  (iii)  environmental  monitoring  issues;  (iv)  functional  areas  covering \nadministration,  finance,  accounting,  and  business  planning;  and  (v)  management  information \nsystem, and cost management and control. Institutional strengthening incorporated in the Project \nthrough component D (institutional development and training) will include training and awareness \nprograms,  consulting  services  for  project  management  support,  and  institutional  and  financial \nstrengthening of the PUSOs and UMG Road Department. \n \nD.  Analysis of Individual Subprojects \n1.  Least-Cost Analysis of Individual Subprojects \n8.  The least-cost analysis ensures that each subproject is optimally designed to meet the \ngoals of the subproject and does not involve unnecessary extra costs. Since there is no unique, \nleast-cost  plan  to  achieve  the  urban  development  targets,  any  plan  that  minimizes  cost  is \nacceptable,  in  principle.  The  water  improvements  will  be  achieved  at  least  cost  through  a \ncentralized water supply for ger area communities, which will be connected to the main water \nsystem. To vastly reduce unaccounted for water and eliminate subsidies over time, all customers in \neach of the subprojects will have metered connections. The least-cost analysis covers all feasible \nalternatives for a given subproject, including variations in location and technology, and covers the \nplanning horizon or capacity of the system.5 For each subproject, about four alternatives were \nassessed based on the options presented in the feasibility study reports, with various additions and \nvariations by the project preparatory technical assistance study team. \n   \n9.  In addition to being least-cost, each individual subproject must be economically justified \nthrough  applying  standard  benefit-cost  analysis.  Therefore,  economic  internal  rates  of  return \n(EIRRs)  were  derived  for  the  representative  subprojects  in  water  supply  and  urban  roads \ncomponents. The main benefits for water supply were quantified under the following categories: \n(i) water supply: (a) non-incremental benefits, (b) beneficiaries\u2019 willingness to pay for improved and \nexpanded (incremental) water services, (c) user cost savings, (d) user time savings;6 and (ii) urban \nroads: (a) vehicle operating costs (VOC), (b) time savings, and (c) maintenance cost savings. \n \nE.  Economic Parameters and Assumptions \n10.  Economic  analysis  of  the  Project  was  conducted  over  25  years  inclusive  of  project \nconstruction. Project construction will commence in 2007 and be completed in 2012. Economic \nbenefits and costs were denominated in terms of the domestic price numeraire and expressed in \n                                                 \n5  Based on the least-cost analysis, major decisions were made to revise the overall design of the Bayankhongor \nsubproject to account for lower cost electricity rates at night and drop a proposed booster pumping station. The high \ncost of buying water from the Erdenet Mining Corporation in Erdenet also led to a lower cost solution to develop a new \nwell field closer to the subproject. \n6  Other indirect benefits include (i) beneficiaries\u2019 willingness to pay for improved and expanded (incremental) water \nservices, (ii) employment generation, and (iii) health benefits. \n ", "    Appendix 15       59  \n   \nconstant  2006  prices.  International  costs  were  converted  to  local  currency  costs  using  an \nexchange rate that started at MNT1,200 per $1. Tradable components were adjusted to economic \nprices using a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.017, and nontraded components were valued at \ndomestic market prices.7 A shadow wage rate factor of 1.2 and 0.8 was applied to the wages of \nskilled and unskilled labor, respectively, at the domestic price level. \n \n11.  Base costs plus physical contingencies of the representative subprojects were estimated \nand apportioned on the basis of tradable, non-tradable, and skilled and unskilled labor costs. \nSimilarly, operation and maintenance costs for each subproject were estimated on the basis of \nskilled and unskilled labor valued in economic prices, i.e., shadow wage rate factors. \n \n12.  Water Supply. Major benefits associated with improved water sources and distribution \nservices include reduced water costs for ger area households, the provision of more water kiosks \nto ger areas as well as the opportunity to obtain individual connections in the future. Water system \nimprovements  also  include  significant  reductions  in  unaccounted  for  water,  enhanced  system \npressure,  increased  security  of  supply,  improved  drinking  water  quality,  and  reduced  risk  of \nexposure to waterborne pathogens. Indirect benefits of the overall Project for ger area beneficiaries \ninclude increased employment and productivity because of subproject construction and operation. \nTime savings from improved water accessibility are also substantial. Direct and indirect health \nbenefits of the Project are significant because less days are lost at work and school, and there is a \ngeneral increase in the overall quality of living. \n \n13.  Urban  Roads.  Economic  benefits  comprise  savings  in  VOCs,  including  reduced  road \nmaintenance costs and travel time savings for both passengers and cargoes for existing and \npotential road users. VOC savings used are from the Road Department under UMG: MNT42,000 \nfor cars, MNT15,000 for minibuses, MNT39,000 for buses, MNT65,000 for trucks, and MNT13,000 \nfor  other  vehicle  types.  The  VOCs  include  fuel,  lubricants,  tires,  maintenance  labor  cost, \ndepreciation,  wages  of  driver,  and  other  costs  (overhead,  administration,  and  interest).  VOC \nsavings accruing from generated traffic have been evaluated at half of the existing traffic benefits. \nVarious road users and businesses will benefit from better mobility and access to work, and \nmarkets;  and  better  social  integration  with  institutions  such  as  schools,  hospitals,  and \ncommunication centers. There will be employment creation during project implementation. The \ngenerated time savings are estimated based on the passengers\u2019 annual average wage and interest \ncost of the average cargo value; half converted to $0.5 per hour and applied to the actual driving \ntime saved by using the project road. Travel time from Hailaast to Ulaanbaatar City will be reduced \nby about 15 minutes for light vehicles. Maintenance cost savings are also considered as benefits \nonce the proposed roads are improved. Unquantifiable benefits include health and environmental \nbenefits to commuters and residents. \n \n14.  Sanitation. The Project is pioneering an on-plot, inside sewage disposal technique through \nsimple compost toilets, which can be built and sold in the community. The indoor compost toilet will \nbe a vast improvement over the present, unimproved pit latrines, which are not only unsanitary but \nalso barely accessible in the winter months. Ger residents will be able to purchase those toilets \nwith the proposed loans under component C of the Project. It is evident that the improvement over \nthe existing pit latrines will have significant health benefits for the project population. \n \n                                                 \n7  Since the shadow exchange rate factor is so close to unity, it does not appear that project costing, which is presently at \na preliminary engineering stage, is very sensitive to shadow exchange rates. This assessment is supported by the fact \nthat the difference between the official exchange rate and the \u201dstreet rate\u201d over the past year has been an average of \nonly 3%. \n ", "60  Appendix 15 \n15.  Heating. Individual heating stoves will also be improved under the subproject. Small loans \nprovided under component C will finance the purchase or improvement of existing stoves to \n\u201csmokeless\u201d stoves either through retrofitting existing stoves or purchasing new ones in the project \nareas. Such stoves will not only improve heating in the winter time, but will reduce overall smoke \npollution in the core towns, providing significant health benefits, improving fuel efficiency, and \nreducing the cost of heating for poor households. \n \n16.  Solid Waste. The provision of more convenient collection points by the local governments \nand a people managed solid waste collection system will substantially improve the quality of \npeople\u2019s lives in the subproject area. Through the efforts of community-based organizations under \nthe Project, a decline in casually discarded waste will lead to a cleaner and higher standard urban \nenvironment. In addition, fencing and separation of toxic waste at the solid waste landfill will vastly \nreduce environmental pollution in and around existing landfills. \n \nF.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n17.  The basic rates of return for the representative water supply subproject is 29.4% in Erdenet. \nIn the case of Hailaast Road subproject, the EIRR is estimated to be 18.0% and is economically \nviable under various sensitivity scenarios (Table A15.1). Sensitivity analyses of the subprojects \nindicate that simultaneous increases in costs and reduction in benefits as well as substantial \nincreases in project costs (20%) have the greatest impact on the EIRR. Delaying implementation \nby 1 year does not have a significant impact. In general, these factors are not enough to overturn \nthe judgment that the Project is socially beneficial. \n \nTable A15.1: Estimated EIRR for Water Supply and Road Components  \nEIRRs and Sensitivity Analysis  Erdenet Water Supply  Hailaast Road \nBase Case EIRR  29.4  18.0 \n10% increase in capital costs (1)  26.0  16.3 \n10% decrease in benefits (2)  25.6  16.1 \nCombination of 1 and 2  22.7  14.6 \nImplementation delay \u2013 1 year  29.3  15.3 \n20% increase in capital costs  23.2  14.9 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20061127130544+08'00'", "Author": "AG4", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20070104094448+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - RRP after LN _24Nov06_ CLEARED Printing copy.doc"}, "author_page": " \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n \n  lpcd  \u2013  liters per capita per day \n  lpd  \u2013  liters per day \n  m3  \u2013  cubic meter \n \nGLOSSARY \n \n  aimag  \u2013  province/provincial \n  ger  \u2013  traditional tent \n  hashaa  \u2013  residential plot \n  soum  \u2013  district \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \nVice President  C.
