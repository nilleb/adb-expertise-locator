Nepal\u2019s economic growth is robust, reaching 7.1% in fiscal year \n(FY) 2019, which is much higher than the 10-year average of 4.3% during FY2009\u2013FY2018. The \nbudget  balance  had  been  in  surplus  before  FY2016.  However,  increased  government \nexpenditures and fiscal transfers to subnational governments rapidly widened the fiscal deficit to \n6.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2018. The deficit for FY2019 had been projected at \naround 8% of GDP but was actually 4.6% mainly because of under-execution and back-loading \nof  spending  resulting  from  federal  and  subregional  government  capacity  constraints.  External \nsector stability is vulnerable over the medium term because of a rapidly rising trade deficit. This \nmay only be partially offset by inflows of remittances from overseas, which declined from 29.5% \nof  GDP  in  FY2016  to  about  25.3%  of  GDP  in  FY2019.  The  current  account  deficit  reached \n$2.4 billion, or 7.7% of GDP, in FY2019\u2014significantly higher than the $95.7 million (0.4% of GDP) \nfigure for FY2017.2 Based on the scenario before the outbreak of the new coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19)\u2014despite some balance-of-payment pressure, financial stability risk, slower growth \nin  neighboring  countries,  and  sluggish  remittance  inflows\u2014the  near-term  outlook  for  growth  is \nmoderate (about 6%), attributed to a stable political environment, a robust tourism industry, and \nongoing reconstruction from the earthquake in 2015. Public debt is estimated at 30.1% of GDP \nas  of  mid-2019,  which  remains  lower  than  in  other  low-income  countries.  Debt  sustainability \nanalysis indicates that none of the debt burden indicators breach the indicative threshold values, \nthough Nepal\u2019s public debt is projected to gradually increase over the medium term. Development \nspending  financed  by  concessional  inflow  should  be  accommodated  since  it  keeps  the  debt \nburden  in  check  while  allowing  for  needed  development  expenditures.  The  COVID-19  shock, \nhowever, is expected to severely impact economic activities and lower growth to 1.0% in FY2020 \nthrough a significant reduction in remittances and tourism, and broader disruptions brought by the \npandemic.3 Nepal  continues  to  be  assessed  at  low  risk  of  debt  distress  for  both  external  and \n\n1  ADB.  2018.

Nepal is a landlocked country of \ntremendous  geographic  diversity,  with  the  northern rim  of  the  Gangetic  Plain  in  the  south,  the \nHimalaya Mountains in the north, and rugged and hilly terrain in between. Civil aviation is crucial \nto transport, trade, and tourism, and provides indispensable links to hilly and mountainous areas \nthat are inaccessible by other transport modes. Tourism is one of the major economic activities in \nNepal and a top government priority. It is estimated that tourism brought in $651 million in foreign \nexchange in FY2019, equivalent to 65% of goods exports (footnote 2). Travel and tourism in Nepal \ngenerated  an  estimated  $1.92  billion  (7.8%  of  GDP)  in  2018,  including  indirect  and  induced \ncontributions.5 Considering  that  more  than  80%  of  international  tourists  come  to  Nepal  by  air, \nimprovement of the civil aviation sector is essential for tourism to support the country\u2019s economic \ndevelopment. \n \n5. \nChallenges in the civil aviation sector. Nepal has a large airport network, albeit with \nlow  capacity,  comprising  one  international  airport,  Tribhuvan  International  Airport  (TIA)  in \nKathmandu,  and  53  domestic  airports. 6 TIA  is  the  sole  gateway  airport  to  Nepal.  It  handled \n4.1 million  international  passengers  in  2019,  up  from  1.8  million  in  2008.  It  also  serves  as  the \nlargest domestic airport, handling 3.2 million domestic passengers in 2019\u2014accounting for about \nhalf of the country\u2019s domestic air traffic.7 TIA handled 32,439 international and 91,816 domestic \nflights in 2019. With the tourism industry expected to continue to grow, it is expected under pre-\nCOVID scenario that air traffic will steadily increase 3%\u20135% annually (para. 9).8  \n \nAlthough  TIA plays a critical  role as an  international  gateway and domestic  air  hub,  its \n6. \nclose  proximity  to  Kathmandu\u2019s  city  center  restrains  expansion  beyond  the  current  airport \nboundary. Aircraft need to occupy the runway for 2\u20133 additional minutes for takeoff and landing \nbecause  the  inefficient  taxiway  caps  aircraft  movements,  particularly  during  peak  hours.  The \nnumber of parking spots at aprons (international: 9 and domestic: 17) is not sufficient to handle \npeak-hour parking demand, causing unnecessary waiting time for spot allocation. It also restricts \nthe  number  of  domestic  operating  aircrafts  based  in  TIA  for  nighttime  parking.  Combined  with \nlimited  airspace  in  the  Kathmandu  Valley,  the  insufficient  capacity  of  airside  facilities  forces \nairplanes to remain on hold in the sky, leading to frequent flight delays and risks. For landside \nfacilities,  the  current  international  terminal  building  handled  4.1  million  passengers  in  2019, \nbeyond  its  annual  capacity  of  3.2  million.  Heavy  congestion  and  lower  quality  of  services  are \nobserved  during  peak  hours; \nthan \n2,200 passengers per hour, about 70% more than its per-hour capacity of 1,350. The number of \ninternational passengers is projected to further increase to 6.1 million by 2028. TIA will have to \nuse its existing space more efficiently, while more flights must be routed through other airports.9 \n \nAviation  safety  in  Nepal  is  another  challenge.  The  Universal  Safety  Oversight  Audit \n7. \nProgramme under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of \n\nterminal  building  handles  more \n\ninternational \n\nthe \n\n \n\n4  International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  World Travel & Tourism Council. 2018.

The CAAN has achieved significant progress in improving its \nsafety oversight capability. In its 2017 audit of the CAAN, the Universal Safety Oversight Audit \nProgramme  raised  the  rate  of  effective  implementation  of  the  CAAN  from  46.96%  in  2009  to \n66.76%  in  2017,  above  the  Global  Aviation  Safety  Plan  (GASP)  benchmark  of  60%. 10 \nNonetheless,  negative  safety  oversight  margins  were  still  identified  in  (i)  air  navigation;  and \n(ii) support  in  organization,  legislation,  and  accident  and  incident  investigation.11 During  2009\u2013\n2018,  21 accidents  involving  Nepalese-registered  aircrafts  claimed  164  lives.  These  accidents \nand fatalities were mainly because of controlled flight into terrain (74% of fatalities), loss of control \nin  flight  (24%  of  fatalities),  and  runway  excursion.  There  were  192  incidents  in  2016  and \n159 incidents in 2017, in which air operation and maintenance were found to be the predominant \nreason.12 The CAAN prepared the Nepal Aviation Safety Plan (NASP), 2018\u20132022 in congruence \nwith ICAO\u2019s GASP to continually enhance aviation safety performance by reducing fatalities and \nthe  risk  of  fatalities  through  the  development  of  a  harmonized  aviation  safety  strategy  and  its \nimplementation.13 \n \nThe global civil aviation sector is heavily regulated, particularly in maintaining high-level \n8. \nsafety  and  security  to  be  applied  across  the  countries.  ICAO  is  responsible  for  ensuring \nstandardized global procedures and processes with respect to civil aviation. As a signatory to the \nConvention on International Civil Aviation, Nepal is generally bound by the requirements of the \nconvention. There are 19 annexes to the convention, divided into specific areas of civil aviation \nover  which  ICAO  has  authority.  These  include  Security  (Annex  17)  and  Safety  Management \n(Annex 19).  The  annexes  provide  details  of the standards  and procedures that  ICAO member \nstates  must  follow  to  ensure  safe  and  efficient  civil  aviation  operations.  With  regard  to  safety \nmanagement, the standards and recommended practices (SARPs) in Annex 19 are intended to \nassist  the  states  in  managing  aviation  safety  risks.  The  GASP  is  a  means  for  ICAO  member \nstates,  including  Nepal,  to  achieve  compliance  with  the  ICAO  safety-related  SARPs,  and  the \nGASP assists the states in strengthening their capabilities in the management of safety through \na structural process. \n \n9. \nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of the tourism industry to the Nepalese \neconomy will remain unchanged over the medium term though its character and business models \nmight be adjusted accordingly under the new normal. As such, directing well-targeted investments \ninto the key airports and creating an enabling environment for the improvement of the civil aviation \nsector  are  still  critical  to  support  Nepal\u2019s  long-term  economic  development.14 The  outbreak  of \nCOVID-19  has  serious  negative  impacts  on  Nepalese  aviation  and  tourism  sectors.  All \ninternational  flights  were  temporarily  suspended  in  March  2020,  and  the  government  had  to \ncancel the Visit Nepal 2020 campaign, which was just launched in January 2020 to attract two \nmillion  visitors.  The  depth  and  duration  of  the  shock  are  uncertain.  There  could  be  several \nscenarios on how soon international connectivity will be restored, depending partly on the length \nof containment measures adopted by Nepal and other major economies. Nonetheless, continuous \nperformance  improvement  of  the  civil  aviation  sector  needs to  underpin  tourism to  prepare  for \n\n \n\n10 ICAO. 2019. Global Aviation Safety Plan, 2020\u20132022.

This was originally in the pipeline as the \nTribhuvan International Airport Capacity Expansion Sector Development Program. The sector loan was split into this \npolicy-based lending and an investment loan after the concept clearance because of differences in loan processing \ntimelines. A stand-alone investment loan under the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Airport Capacity \nEnhancement Project that will finance the improvement of airport facilities, including TIA, is being processed.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\naccommodating the future bounce-back of international travelers and kickstarting the economy \nafter the pandemic.  \n \n10. \nGovernment reform agenda in civil aviation sector. Nepal has maintained a traditional \ncivil aviation sector structure whereby the functions of regulation, safety oversight, and service \nprovision  are  carried  out  by one entity: the  CAAN.  The roles of regulator  and service provider \nlodged  in  a  single  organization  create  a  conflict  of  interest.  The  regulatory  function  may  not \nprovide  adequate  oversight  on  service  provision,  may  raise  operating  costs,  and  result  in \nsuboptimal performance as a service provider. There are also repercussions on aviation safety, \nwhich have been noted and highlighted by international aviation agencies. ICAO\u2019s GASP, 2020\u2013\n2022 states that an independent regulatory authority should be established and maintained, which \nincludes  separation  of  oversight  functions  from  service  provision  functions  where  these  exist \nwithin the authority (footnote 10). The European Commission has banned Nepalese airlines from \nflying  to the  European  Union  because  of  a  lack of safety  oversight  by the aviation  authority  of \nNepal.15 To remedy this situation, the NASP (footnote 13) has named the bifurcation of CAAN as \na priority measure to comply with international standards. The change of the governance structure \nin the civil aviation sector is the most fundamental and imminent reform requirement. While the \npreparation  of  bills  on  the  reforms  was  initially  supported  by  the  ADB-funded  Air  Transport \nCapacity Enhancement Project, the government continued working on finalizing the bills until their \nsubmission to the Parliament.16 The main objective of the new bills is to reform the civil aviation \nsector in Nepal by bifurcating the roles of the regulator and the operator (CAAN) into separate \nentities. \n \n11. \nADB assistance to the sector. ADB is Nepal\u2019s key partner in the civil aviation sector to \nsupport  various  aspects  of  its  development,  including  planning,  physical  investment,  and \ninstitutional reform. ADB\u2019s involvement in Nepal\u2019s aviation sector started with a $70 million loan \nand a $10 million grant to Nepal through the 2009 Air Transport Capacity Enhancement Project \n(footnote  16).  The  project  aimed  to  enhance  safety  and  capacity  at  TIA  and  three  regional \nairports.17 The draft bills to bifurcate CAAN, as per ICAO\u2019s guidance materials and international \nbest  practices,  were  prepared  under  the  project,  based  on  which  ADB  has  conducted  policy \ndialogues  with  the  government  to  strengthen  aviation  safety  from  an  oversight  function \nperspective. The Transport Project Preparatory Facility assisted CAAN in (i) preparing the TIA \nmaster plan to guide future investments for the airport, and (ii) developing the designs of required \nairside  and  landside  facilities. 18 Through  the  South  Asia  Tourism  Infrastructure  Development \nProject,  ADB  is funding the  upgrade  of Gautam Buddha Airport,  one of the  four  domestic  hub \nairports  in  Nepal,  to  accommodate  the  increasing  number  of  tourists  to  Lumbini. 19  Review \nmissions  of  the  ADB-funded  projects  observed  that  the  CAAN\u2019s  capacity  for  (i)  contract \nmanagement  and  procurement;  and  (ii)  investment  preparation  needs  to  be  strengthened  to \nimprove  implementation performance.  Lessons from  the reviews  are  incorporated  in the  policy \nactions  of  the  program.

The  ADB  program  team  has  closely  coordinated \nwith  other  development  partners  and  diplomatic  communities  in  Nepal,  including  through  the \nInternational Development Partner Group. Because of the ban on Nepalese airlines flying to the \nEuropean  Union,  its  member  states  theoretically  have  a  strong  interest  in  the  proposed  civil \naviation sector reforms to enhance the oversight function, and they could provide various support \nfor the reforms if called upon. ICAO provides oversight authorities and service providers in Nepal \nwith the SARPs, relevant guidance materials, and trainings, as required. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nPolicy  reform.  A  two-tranche  stand-alone  PBL  is  proposed.  The  first  tranche,  to  be \nreleased on loan effectiveness, includes the legal framework for the reforms to bifurcate the CAAN \ninto a regulator, which is the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAANepal), and a service provider, \nwhich is the ASAN. The draft bills include fundamental elements of the new organizations such \nas  mandate;  governance  structure;  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  board;  executive  bodies; \ninternal and external audits; decision-making process including appointment of executive heads, \nstaff management, remuneration and benefits; funding sources; and accounting. 20 The two first \ntranche  policy  actions  on  submission  of  the  bills  to  the  Parliament  have  been  achieved.  The \nsecond  tranche  has  11  policy  actions  that  will  support  the  establishment  of  high-quality \norganizations.  To  support  this,  the  tranche  2  policy  actions  cover  more  advanced  elements  of \norganizational  development  such  as  preparation  of  an  integrated  institutional  management \nstrategy,  development  of  key  performance  indicators,  and  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion \n(GESI) initiatives. There are three reform areas: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nReform  area  1:  Legal  and  implementation  framework  of  the  civil  aviation \nsector reforms approved. A critical step to bifurcate CAAN into a regulator and \na  service  provider  is  to  provide  the  legal  basis  for  the  establishment  of  the  two \nauthorities. In tranche 1, the program will support the government in approving the \ntwo draft bills for the establishment of the CAANepal and the ASAN, and submitting \nthese  to  the  Parliament  for  consideration  (footnote  20).  The  draft  bills  stipulate \n(a) duties, responsibilities, and rights of the new entities; (b) establishment, duties, \nresponsibilities, and rights of boards; (c) appointment, duties, responsibilities, and \nrights of executive heads; (d) staff management, including staff numbers, gratuity \nfund,  principles  of  staff  transfer,  remuneration,  and  benefits;  (e)  transfer  of \nproperties, assets, and liabilities; (f) separated fund sources; (g) accounting rules, \nincluding internal audit; (h) provisions on conflicts of interest; and (i) procedures to \nset rules to implement the acts (footnote 20). The act for the ASAN also allows the \nprivate sector, subject to government approval, to be involved in the construction, \ndevelopment, operation, and management of airports in Nepal. Under tranche 2, \nthe program will support the implementation and enforcement of the laws once the \nbills are approved and enacted. \n \nReform area 2: Independent regulatory body for the civil aviation established \nand  functionalized.  To  establish  and  maintain  an  independent  regulatory \n\n20 The bills are (i) a bill (that will become the Nepal Civil Aviation Authority Act) to amend and consolidate laws regarding \nCAAN, and (ii) a bill (that will become the Nepal Air Service Authority Act) for the establishment and management of \nASAN. Both bills were endorsed by the Cabinet in January 2020, and submitted to the Parliament in February 2020. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n(iii) \n\noversight authority, which should be separated from a service provision function, \nis an important safety enhancement initiative to avoid conflicts of interest following \nICAO\u2019s  GASP,  2020\u20132022.  The  program  will  support  the  establishment  of  the \nCAANepal as a regulator with appropriate oversight functions as stipulated in the \nbill.  The  CAANepal  shall  develop  an  effective  system  to  promulgate  technical \nguidance  and  tools  to  effectively  perform  the  safety  oversight  functions,  and  to \nrecruit,  train,  and  retain  qualified  and  sufficient  technical  personnel  to  support \nregulatory oversight. Under the program, key performance indicators to measure \nthe regulatory functions will be developed following ICAO\u2019s SARPs in the areas of \n(a)  aviation  safety;  (b)  aviation  security;  (c)  licensing  and  certification  of  service \nproviders;  (d)  authorization  and  approval  of  aviation  activities;  (e)  surveillance, \ninspection,  and  audits  of  service  providers;  and  (f)  capacity  development \nrequirements.  The  program  will  also  support  improvement  of  the  CAANepal\u2019s \norganizational structure to comply with ICAO\u2019s SARPs.21 An updated NASP will be \napproved based on ICAO\u2019s latest safety audit to Nepal, ICAO\u2019s GASP, and other \nsafety standards. \n \nReform area 3: Independent service provider for the civil aviation established \nand  functionalized.  The  ASAN  will  be  established  as  an  independent  service \nprovider  to  focus  its  business  domain  on  the  construction,  operation,  and \nmanagement  of  airports.  The  newly  established  service  provider  will  need  to \nimprove its operational efficiency to provide better services to airport users and to \npromote  efficient \ninstitutional \nmanagement. The new service provider will remain a government authority as per \nthe bill for the establishment and management of the ASAN, but it allows for private \nsector  involvement,  subject  to  government  approval,  in  the  construction, \ndevelopment, operation, and management of airports.22 The program will support \nthe establishment of the ASAN and its transformation into a high-quality entity with \nmore  accountable  management  and  efficient  operations.  The  program  includes \ndevelopment  of  (a)  a  medium-term  business  plan;  (b)  a  medium-term  financial \nframework  and  forecast  financial  statements;  and  (c)  a  financial  management \nimprovement  plan  comprising \nfinancial \nstatements,  an  enterprise  resource  planning  system,  and  a  management \naccounting  system.  Under  the  program, key performance indicators to measure \nthe service provider functions will be developed in the areas of (a) core business \nand  functions,  (b)  aviation  safety,  (c)  aviation  security,  (d)  service  quality, \n(e) productivity  and  cost-effectiveness,  (f)  financial  management,  and  (g)  social \nand  environmental  performance.  The  program  will  also  support  GESI  initiatives \nthrough a GESI audit of the ASAN and a GESI operational plan. To strengthen the \ncapacity  of  the  ASAN,  the  program  will  further  support  the  (a) creation  of  new \nseparate units for environmental and social, as well as legal and/or procurement \nservices; and (b) development of an operational capacity program. \n\nintroduction  of  accrual-based \n\nthrough  more  accountable \n\nresource  use \n\nthe \n\n \nADB\u2019s  value  addition.  The  program  will  (i)  build  on  outputs  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance  and \n14. \ninitiatives to align with international good practices and ADB\u2019s strategic objectives; (ii) add value \nby creating an institutional environment for enhanced civil aviation safety and sector efficiency; \n\n \n\n21 The CAANepal shall comply with Annex 19 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Safety Management); \n\nICAO Doc 9859, Safety Management Manual; and ICAO Doc 9734, Safety Oversight Manual. \n\n22 Article  12  (Joint  Investment)  of  the  bill  stipulates  that  the  authority  (ASAN),  after  obtaining  approval  from  the \n\nGovernment of Nepal, can construct, operate, or manage airports under public, private, or joint partnership. \n\n\f7 \n\nand (iii) facilitate other interventions of the government, development partners, and the private \nsector in improving civil aviation as well as further developing the tourism sector in the country. \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership strategy  for  Nepal,  2020\u20132024  aims  to  address  major  development \nconstraints by pursuing three objectives: (i) improved infrastructure for private sector-led growth, \n(ii) improved access to devolved services, and (iii) environmental sustainability and resilience.23 \nThe transport sector is a key area for implementing the strategy, and ADB places high value on \nimproving the infrastructure and operational capacity of TIA and increasing air safety through the \ncivil aviation reforms. The program is listed in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Nepal, \n2020\u20132022 (footnote 14). This will be the first ADB transport sector policy-based loan for Nepal, \nand it will complement infrastructure investment, which is in line with recommendations made by \nthe 2020 sector-wide evaluation of ADB support for transport.24 \n \nEffect  of  COVID-19  on  program  implementation.  Since  the  proposed  policy  reform \n15. \nfocuses  specifically  on  the  governance  structure  of  the  civil  aviation  sector  in  line  with  the \nestablished international safety standards and practices, the COVID-19 pandemic will not affect \nthe policy actions under the program. The proposed program to be implemented over the next \n2 years  will  provide  more  air  travel  opportunities  with higher  safety  and service  standards  and \nsupport  the  quick  recovery  of  the  Nepalese  economy  once  the  pandemic  is  contained.  The \nadverse  impact  of  the  pandemic  on  program  implementation  is  considered  limited  since  the \nprogram does not involve physical activities such as construction and transportation of equipment \nand materials. However, the progress of the reform will be closely monitored especially in terms \nof  necessary  resource  allocation  for  implementation.  From  another  perspective,  the  quick-\ndisbursing  proposed  PBL,  particularly  with  $25  million  of  tranche  1  to  be  released  upon \neffectiveness,  will  also  assist  the  government  in  securing  external  fiscal  financing  to  mitigate \neconomic and social shocks caused by COVID-19 (para. 17). \n \nC. \n \nThe program is aligned with ICAO\u2019s GASP (footnote 10) and NASP (footnote 13) to avoid \n16. \npotential conflicts of interest within the CAAN (which has both oversight and operation functions), \nand to secure the effective safety oversight of the service provider. The operational functions of \nthe CAAN will be transformed into the ASAN with (i) clearly defined objectives and duties, and \n(ii) independent  management  and  funding  structures  to  improve  the  operational  efficiency  and \naccountability of airports in Nepal. The civil aviation reforms under the program will also allow the \nASAN,  the  service  provider,  to  involve  the  private  sector  in  construction,  operation,  and \nmanagement  of  airports,  which  could  achieve  efficiency  gains  in  airport  operations. 25 \nStrengthened  oversight  functions  and  airport  management  capacity  through  the  civil  aviation \nreforms will help the government address constraints on air travel to and from Nepal and improve \nsubstandard  airport  services,  contributing  to  international  tourism  development  that  will  ripple \nacross the whole economy. \n \n \n \n \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\nResilience.

ADB Support for Transport. 2010\u20132018. Manila: ADB. \n25 Private sector involvement is subject to government approval in consideration of the following factors: security and \nsafety  of  the  civil  aviation  sector,  social  impacts  on  stakeholders,  country  context  of  possibility  of  private  sector \ninvolvement, modalities of the participation, market conditions, and potential economic benefits. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\nD. \n \n17. \nNepal faces a rising deficit\u2014from 3.1% of GDP in FY2017 to 4.6% of GDP in FY2019\u2014\nlargely  because  of  increasing  expenditures  on  grants,  land,  buildings,  and  civil  works.26 In  the \noriginal  FY2020  budget,  the  government\u2019s  total  gross  borrowing  requirement  is  estimated  at \n$4.1 billion, of which $2.5 billion will be from external borrowing. External borrowing will comprise \nmostly concessional official development assistance and export\u2013import loans, of which program \nloans are about $350 million. In addition, the outbreak of COVID-19 will negatively affect Nepal\u2019s \neconomy  through  lower tourism  demand  and  possible  declines  in  exports  as  well  as  overseas \nworkers\u2019 remittances. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that COVID-19 will lower \ngrowth in Nepal to 1.0% and widen the country\u2019s fiscal deficit to 7.2% of GDP in FY2020 (footnote \n3). The COVID-19 shock has given rise to an urgent external financing need of 3.0% of GDP and \na fiscal financing need of 2.6% of GDP in FY2020. The government is therefore seeking budget \nsupport  from  development  partners  to fill  these  gaps.  ADB  closely  coordinated  with the  World \nBank  and  IMF  through  the  government  to  respond  to  public  health  emergencies  and  mitigate \nadverse economic and social impacts caused by COVID-19, and provided in May 2020 a loan of \n$250 million for COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program.27 The proposed \nloan will not only secure fiscal headroom to cover additional expenses on the civil aviation reforms \nbut also contribute to addressing the government\u2019s urgent fiscal needs. \n \nFor the proposed PBL to the civil aviation sector, the Government of Nepal has requested \n18. \na  concessional  loan  of  $50  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help \nfinance the program. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The funds will be released in two \ntranches\u2014$25  million  at  loan  effectiveness  and  $25 million  about  24  months  later\u2014once  the \ngovernment has complied with the policy actions. \n \nE. \n \n19. \nThe  executing  agency  for  the  program  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  the \nimplementing agencies will be the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation and the CAAN \nestablished under the Nepal Civil Aviation Authority Act, 2053 (1996). After the bifurcation of the \nCAAN, the implementation responsibility under the CAAN shall be transferred to the CAANepal, \nwhich  will  be  established  under  the  Nepal  Civil  Aviation  Act,  and  the  ASAN,  which  will  be \nestablished under Air Service Authority of Nepal Act. The CAAN will appoint a transition team to \nlead  the  implementation  of  activities required for  its  bifurcation,  and  the  transition team  will  be \ntransferred to the CAANepal and the ASAN after they are established to assist the CAANepal\u2019s \ndirector  general  and  the  ASAN\u2019s  managing  director  in  setting  up  the  new  entities,  including \nimplementation of the policy actions in tranche 2. \n \n20. \nADB will undertake periodic review missions to (i) confirm progress and fulfillment of policy \nactions  for  tranche  release;  (ii)  monitor  continued  applicability  of  the  assumptions  that  might \nimpact program success, as well as specified risks and their mitigating measures; and (iii) advise \non actions to maintain effective implementation within the program period. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n26 ADB. 2019.

The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n23. \nThe implementation arrangements for the TA will be aligned with those of the PBL. ADB \nwill administer the TA. The executing agencies will be the CAAN, the CAANepal, and the ASAN. \nThe  transition  teams  of  the  executing  agencies  will  implement  the  TA  components.  A  total  of \n10.5 person-months of international and 23 person-months of national consultancy inputs will be \nrequired.

In addition, since the PBL includes \nthe bifurcation of the implementing agency itself (CAAN, which is responsible for uninterrupted \ncivil  aviation  safety  and  airport  operations),  special  attention  needs  to  be  paid  to  the  smooth \ntransition to the two new authorities (ASAN and CAANepal) to ensure that both entities commence \ntheir respective operations having already met governance, management, staffing, financial, and \nbusiness  requirements.  The  transitions  will  be  closely  monitored  through  ADB\u2019s  continued \nengagement with the government along with TA support and implementation monitoring by ADB. \n \nC. \n \n26. \nNepal derives significant income from tourism activities, and this has become one of the \nkey  sectors  driving  national  development.  Considering  that  an  overwhelming  majority  of \ninternational tourists come to Nepal by air, improvement of the civil aviation sector is essential for \ntourism  to  flourish  and  contribute  to  the  economic  development  of  the  country.  The  proposed \nimprovements in the regulatory and policy sphere will remove concerns about Nepal\u2019s oversight \nfunctions relating to civil aviation safety and create an enabling business environment for better \nair connectivity with the rest of the world. Better aviation will also enhance associated commercial \nbusiness  activities  and  will  have  a  positive  ripple  effect  on  other  sectors  such  as  agriculture, \nindustry, energy, and transport. Overall, the economic impact of an improved civil aviation sector \nwill have substantial impact on the country\u2019s poverty alleviation programs. \n \n27. \nThe proposed  reforms  under the  PBL  to  bifurcate CAAN  into  a regulator  and  a  service \nprovider may have negative impacts on the working conditions of CAAN employees. The draft \nbills  (footnote  20),  however,  provide  relevant  clauses  to  safeguard  CAAN  employees  through \n(i) employees\u2019 submitting applications to transfer to the new entities, (ii) keeping at least the same \nlevel of remuneration and benefits after the transfer, (iii) providing a necessary retirement scheme \nin consideration of the previous working records in CAAN, and (iv) establishing a gratuity fund in \neach  authority.  The  CAAN  and  its  successors  (CAANepal  and  ASAN)  will  communicate  with \nstakeholders, especially employees, about the transformation and its impacts; the attached TA \nwill help with these communication efforts. \n \nThere  are pressing  needs  in the  global  civil  aviation  sector to  advance gender  equality \n28. \nand the empowerment of women. ICAO made commitments, in Resolution A39-30: ICAO Gender \nEquality Programme Promoting Participation of Women in the Global Aviation Sector, to enhance \ngender equality by 2030 at all professional and higher levels of employment in the sector. In line \nwith  global  trends  and  requirements,  the  civil  aviation  sector  in  Nepal  needs  to  transform  its \ninstitutions, particularly the service provider, to be more advanced and forward- looking in terms \nof  gender  inclusion.  The  program  will  support  GESI  initiatives  of  the  ASAN  by  (i) conducting  a \nGESI  audit  of  the  ASAN,  (ii)  developing  a  GESI  operational  plan,  and  (iii) increasing  the \npercentage  of  women  and  the  socially  excluded  in  the  ASAN\u2019s  workforce.  The  program  is \ncategorized some gender elements. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nThe program is confined to policy reforms and will not involve any physical activities. None \nof the policy actions will result in or lead to involuntary resettlement or adversely affect indigenous \npeoples.34 No adverse environmental impacts have been identified and, as such, the program is \n\nSafeguards \n\n34 Matrix of Potential Environmental and Social Impacts and Measures (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\ncategorized C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Meanwhile, \nthe PBL will support the establishment of an environmental and social unit in the ASAN to enhance \ncapacity  in  safeguard  compliance  and  social  inclusion  in  the  implementation  of  investment \nprojects.  The  ASAN  is  expected  to  be  the  executing  agency  for  airport  projects  funded  by \ndevelopment partners, including ADB. \n \nE. \n \n30.
