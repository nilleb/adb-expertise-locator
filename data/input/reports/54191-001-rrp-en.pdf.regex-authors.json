THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nCountercyclical  Support  Facility  loan  to  Georgia  for  the  COVID-19  Active  Response  and \nExpenditure  Support  (CARES)  Program  under  the  COVID-19  pandemic  response  option \n(CPRO).1  \n \n2.  The Government of Georgia responded to the public health threat posed by coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) in a timely and effective manner by introducing a comprehensive package \nof containment measures. However, while these strict containment efforts have shielded a \nvulnerable public health system from overburden, they disrupt a trajectory of strong and inclusive \neconomic growth, threatening the development gains achieved in the period between 2012 and \n2019.  To  mitigate  the  adverse  public  health  and  socioeconomic  effects  of  the  crisis,  the \ngovernment adopted a sizable countercyclical expenditure program. The proposed CARES \nProgram2 aims to support the government in implementing its response package to protect the \nlives and livelihoods of Georgians, especially the poor and vulnerable segments of the population, \nwomen, and children.  \n \nTable 1. Compliance with Access Criteria for CPRO \nCPRO Access  ADB Staff Assessment \nCriteria \n1. Adverse Impact  The IMF projects GDP growth in Georgia to decline to -4% in 2020 against the original estimate \nof Exogenous  of 4.3% because of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a $3.6 billion loss in economic output. \nShocks  The economic slowdown, led by a contraction in domestic demand and investment\u2014and a sharp \ncontraction in tourism, foreign direct investment, trade, and remittances\u2014is threatening the \ndevelopment gains Georgia achieved in the period 2011\u20132019. The number of unemployed \npeople could triple which, in addition to an expected increase in loss of income by people in the \ninformal sector, would significantly threaten the livelihoods of 47% of Georgians who are \nconsidered vulnerable to poverty. A protracted crisis is limiting the fiscal space needed to mitigate \nhealth and economic impacts. A decline of 23.3% in revenue collection against the original \nestimate for 2020-led by a reduction of 1.6% in the tax\u2013GDP ratio\u2013combined with increased \nexpenditure under the government\u2019s Anti-Crisis Plan will widen the fiscal deficit to 8.1% against \nthe original estimate of 2.2% of GDP.  \n2.Countercyclical  The government announced a GEL3.5 billion ($1.1 billion) plan, to cover higher spending in the \ndevelopment  health sector; provide assistance to affected private sector entities; and support the unemployed, \nexpenditures   poor and vulnerable with a GEL1.035 billion ($329 million)social assistance package. The total \nexpenditure package amounts to 7.4% of GDP, one of the highest in the region. The government \nhas also adopted a range of countercyclical monetary policy measures for price stability and \nadequate liquidity in the financial system.   \n3. Pre-shock  Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Georgia\u2019s economy expanded at an average of 4.7% during \nRecord of sound  2011\u20132019 and was expected to grow by 4.3% in 2020. According to ADB and IMF forecasts for \nmacroeconomic  2020, all key macro fiscal aggregates were expected to remain below their maximum target \nManagement  ceilings, with public debt\u2013GDP a 44.5%, the fiscal deficit at 2.2% and total expenditure as a share \nof GDP at 28.3%. Reforms to tax administration led to higher-than-anticipated tax revenue \ncollection, reaching 23.7% of GDP in 2019. The only significant risk faced by the authorities before \nCOVID-19 stemmed from inflationary pressures, which the National Bank of Georgia targeted \nthrough tightened monetary policy. The banking industry\u2019s performance was also expected to \nremain robust, with an increase in credit to the private sector, improved asset quality and higher \nliquidity despite marginally lower profitability. The IMF\u2019s favorable assessment letter confirm ADB \nstaff\u2019s assessment that the economic downturn is because of the COVID-19 pandemic, not \nbecause of previous macroeconomic mismanagement.  \n4. Structural  Georgia has made credible commitments to continue its ambitious reform path despite the \nCOVID-19 crisis under IMF and World Bank policy-based operationsb and planned policy reforms \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

The IACC has taken decisive and credible steps \nresponse plan  to contain the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate the recessionary impact on the economy. The \ndeclaration of a national State of Emergency in March 2020 was followed by the publication of an \nextensive  list  of  containment  measures  and,  on  24  April  2020,  the  announcement  of  a \ncomprehensive response package supporting health sector resilience, affected businesses, and \nthe poor and vulnerable during the crisis.  \n5. Debt  The public debt\u2013GDP ratio has been stable in recent years, hovering below 45% of GDP. \nsustainability  Widening fiscal imbalances because of COVID-19 are expected to push the public debt\u2013GDP \nratio to 62.4% in 2020 but will resume a downward trend starting in 2021 towards a 51% ratio by \n2024. Despite the sharp increase in 2020, the ADB\u2019s DSAd concludes that public debt remains \nsustainable in the medium term. Financial assistance from the ADB will not aggravate Georgia\u2019s \ndebt vulnerabilities in the medium term.  \n6. Coordination  ADB has consulted with IMF and is in close contact with its relevant staff on macroeconomic \nwith the  monitoring. IMF has provided a favorable assessment letter.

Since its outbreak in December 2019, \nCOVID-19 has spread rapidly across the world. World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a \nglobal pandemic on 11 March 2020. The number of cases worldwide soared to 2,912,421 with \n203,432 deaths worldwide as of 26 April 2020.3 Georgia, with a population of 3.723 million \npeople,4 began the fight against COVID-19 on 28 January, 1 month before the first confirmed \ncase of infection was reported on 26 February, imported by a citizen returning from Iran via \nAzerbaijan.  A  state  of  emergency  was  declared  on  21  March,  2  days  before  community \ntransmission was confirmed. As of 19 April 2020, 388 cases had been reported and four deaths \nconfirmed.5 Some 5,094 people are in a 14-day mandatory quarantine, while 547 patients remain \nunder observation in hospitals.6 If no mitigation and containment measures were adopted,  it is \nestimated that 114,804 people could require hospitalization and nearly 29,500 could require \nintensive  care,  which  would  overwhelm  the  health  system. 7  The  increasing  burden  of \nnoncommunicable diseases8 poses an additional risk to the populations\u2019 vulnerability to the \nCOVID-19  pandemic  as  evidence  from  other  countries  suggests.

Public health system\u2019s vulnerability to COVID-19. Despite significant improvements in \nrecent years, Georgia\u2019s public health system remains vulnerable to the health burden posed by \nthe COVID-19 pandemic and crisis. According to the Global Health Security Index, Georgia\u2019s \nhealth capacity in clinics, hospitals and community care centers scored low: 18.3 out of 100.9 This \nis in part driven by the country\u2019s low nursing staff and hospital bed density.10 Georgia has only \n47.3 nurses per 10,000 population and 26 hospital beds per 10,000 population compared with \nneighboring countries such as Armenia which has 42 beds per 10,000 population.11 Some 62% \nof frontline medical doctors, who are higher risk of contagion, are women.12  \n \n5.  Pre-shock  strong  economic  performance  recorded.  The  outbreak  of  COVID-19 \ndisrupted a trajectory of strong economic performance and robust macroeconomic fundamentals \nin Georgia. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, economic performance was expected to remain \nstrong, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecasted at 4.3% for 2020 on account of \ngood macroeconomic management. Georgia\u2019s demonstrable commitment to fiscal discipline \ntranslated into robust macroeconomic fundamentals between 2014 and 2020. In 2019, Georgia \nachieved the lowest fiscal deficit in 10 years (at 2.2% of GDP), a historically low current account \ndeficit (at 5.1% of GDP), the lowest unemployment rate since the country\u2019s foundation (at 11.6%), \nand the lowest rate of poverty (still high at 20.1 percent, but nearly halved in comparison to 2007). \nPublic debt\u2013GDP remained under its 60% ceiling, at 44.5% and expenditure as a share of GDP \nat 28.3%. Reforms to revenue administration had led to overperformance in revenue collection, \nreaching 23.7% of GDP in 2019, and helped maintain the government\u2019s strong fiscal position even \nas it pursued ambitious public investment and social sector spending. 13 As a result, all three main \ncredit rating agencies upgraded Georgia\u2019s sovereign credit rating to BB/Ba2 from BB\u2013/Ba3 \nreferring to improved economic resilience and sound macroeconomic management as the main \ndriver. Monetary policy interventions and exchange rate flexibility were expected to remain \neffective in curbing inflationary pressures. The banking sector\u2019s performance was expected to \nremain robust, with an increase in credit to the private sector, improved asset quality and higher \nliquidity despite marginally lower profitability.14 \n \n6.  Impact of COVID-19 on the economy. Global travel restrictions, nonpharmaceutical \ninterventions (NPIs), and the anticipation of a global economic crisis because of the COVID-19 \npandemic caused an immediate exogenous shock on the Georgian economy through four main \ntransmission channels: (i) a slowdown in tourism, (ii) trade disruptions, (iii) capital outflow, and \n(iv) an increase in the cost of finance.

Public debt and budget \nbalance rules have been adhered to since their introduction.

Imports will reduce \nby 29.3% and affect the availability of intermediary goods for manufacturing. Foreign direct \ninvestment is expected to decline by 20.8% in 2020, compared with 2019. Remittances are \nexpected to reduce by 15% in 2020 compared with 2019, having contracted by 9.0% in March \n2020 compared with March 2019.18 The contagion effects of the global recessionary shock \ncaused by COVID-19 will be significantly compounded by the effect of containment measures and \nlockdown imposed by the government since the declaration of the state of emergency in March \n2020. These are likely to lead to a sharp decline in aggregate domestic demand,19 which \naccounted for 65% of GDP in 2019, and are expected to cause cancellation and delays of \ninvestments, affecting the business environment and investor confidence. Domestic production \nwill also suffer, because of NPIs and disruptions to global value chains, trade, and investment, \nthus exacerbating the recessionary economic and social impact of the crisis. Updated estimates \nby the IMF and the MOF predict the current account deficit to widen to -11.3% of GDP in 2020, \nfrom a record low of -5.1% in 2019 and an estimated -4.9% in 2020. Real GDP is expected to \ncontract by 4% in 2020\u2013a sharp downturn from the previous estimate of 4.3% growth. \n \n7.  Impact of COVID-19 on public finances. The impact on state finances is expected to be \nsignificant. Recent estimates suggest that state revenues will decrease by $452 million in 2020 \nbecause of COVID-19. This sharp decline is driven by an expected fall in the tax\u2013GDP ratio from \n23.7% to 21.4% due to slowdown in economic activity. In turn, public expenditure will increase to \n32.9% of GDP, compared with the original estimate of 28.3% for 2020. Increases in public \nexpenditure, combined with a sharp decline in public revenue as a result of COVID-19, will widen \nthe fiscal deficit, from 2.2% to 8.1% of GDP in 2020. The public debt\u2013GDP ratio will, as a result, \nrise from 44.5% in 2019 to 62.4% in 2020 to help meet the estimated financing gap of $1.533 \nbillion that will emerge as a result of COVID-19, its impact on the economy and the cost of the \ngovernment  response.  Deteriorating  external  balances  are  already  resulting  in  increased \npressure on exchange rates and higher yield spreads with US Treasury bonds, making access to \ninternational financing more expensive.20  \n \n8.  Impact of COVID-19 on unemployment, poverty, and gender equality.

Some 29.9% of hired workers and 14.0% of self-employed workers are at high risk of job loss (totaling \n381,548 jobs). Y. Babych, D. Keshelava, and G. Mzhavanadze. 2020. The Economic Response to COVID-19: How \nis Georgia Handling the Challenge? Tbilisi: International School of Economics at TSU Policy Institute. \n ", "5 \nalmost  all  industries  place  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  at  risk,  either  by  downward \nadjustments to income or working hours, or by losing their jobs. A total of 381,548 workers, or \n23% of all hired and self-employed workers, are at high risk of job loss  as a result of the COVID-\n19 crisis.23 Such sharp increases in unemployment could eradicate years of inclusive economic \ngrowth, reversing a decade-long decline in absolute poverty.24 While absolute poverty ($1.90/day) \nhas declined sharply from 12.2% in 2010 to 3.7% estimated for 2020, the effects of COVID-19 \nare expected to lead to a rise in poverty incidence to 4.3%, in a best case scenario, or 6.8%, in a \nworst case scenario.25 Further, the national poverty line indicates that one in five Georgians \n(20.1% in 2018) still lives in poverty. As of 2018, 47% of Georgians were estimated to remain \nvulnerable to poverty, with monthly incomes precariously close to the national poverty line.26 High \ndependence on labor income implies that even a small increase in the unemployment rate could \npush many households into poverty, starting with already vulnerable households.27 The loss of \nlabor income, combined with a reduction in remittances, will have a direct bearing on domestic \nconsumption and further threaten employment and incomes. The 23% of Georgians who depend \non income from informal labor for their livelihoods28 are also expected to suffer from the impact of \nCOVID-19.  \n \n9.  The economic impact of COVID-19 is also expected to contribute to gender economic \nimbalances. As of December 2019, Georgia had 1.66 million hired and self-employed workers, \n46% of which were women.29 Recent estimates suggest that 40.6% of all female hired workers \nand 22.6% of female self-employed workers are at high risk of job loss.30 With women earning \nonly 64% of men\u2019s average earnings in 2017, potential downward adjustments to income or work \nhours would likely affect women more severely.31 Further, women comprise an estimated 60% of \nall workers in tourism, one of the most affected industries in Georgia, which accounts for 7.8% of \ntotal employment. The low average salaries for women in tourism, which were about a third of the \nnational average salaries in 2017, exacerbate the impact of a reduction in income in this industry \non women (footnote 31). 32 Finally, the expected 15% reduction in remittances is likely to impact \nwomen disproportionately, as they represent 61.8% of all remittance recipients in Georgia.33  \n \n10.  Immediate and effective response to contain the spread of COVID-19. Acknowledging \nthe fragility of its public health system and the difficulties in handling the COVID-19 pandemic, \nGeorgia implemented strict containment measures very early. On 21 March 2020, with 47 \nconfirmed  cases  of  COVID-19,  Georgia  declared  a  state  of  emergency  and  published  a \ncomprehensive list of NPIs, including restrictions on the movement of people, public gatherings, \ncultural and sports events, as well as restrictions on the types of economic activities that are \n \n23 L.

Government\u2019s Anti-Crisis Plan. To mitigate the expected socioeconomic impacts of \nCOVID-19, the government adopted a comprehensive countercyclical development expenditure \nprogram. Costed at GEL3.5 billion ($1.1 billion), or 7.4% of GDP, the response program has a \nthreefold objective: (i) increase the public health sector\u2019s capacity to respond to the pandemic in \nthe short and medium term; (ii) minimize losses to be incurred by affected private sector entities; \nand (iii) limit socioeconomic costs on the poor and vulnerable through expanded assistance \nprograms. The government\u2019s countercyclical expenditure program has been drafted within a \ndemonstrably  sustainable  macroeconomic  background  and  will  be  implemented  through  a \nprudent budgetary framework (footnote 15). \n \n12.  Public health sector response to COVID-19 (GEL350 million or $111 million). The \nhealth system\u2019s capacity to cope with an increasing number of COVID-19 cases is limited. While \nthe strict containment measures adopted by the government have been widely effective in \nminimizing  the  number  of  cumulative  cases,  the  government  acknowledges  the  need  to \nstrengthen the health system\u2019s capacity in the medium-term. The health sector response revolves \naround five key areas of intervention:  \ni)  Case  detection  and  confirmation:  The  government  will  procure  necessary \nmedical hygiene materials, COVID-19 test kits, laboratory reagents, polymerase \nchain reaction equipment, and specimen transport kits. It will be supported by \ninvestment  in  information  technology  systems  for  disease  surveillance  and \ncontract tracing.35  \nii)  Isolation of high-risk individuals: The government will ensure that high risk \nindividuals36 are placed in specially organized quarantine facilities. \niii)  Improving the quality of medical care: To improve the quality of medical care \nprovided and minimize risks of infection to health personnel, the government will \ntrain at least 2,000 medical staff, procure essential medical goods and carry out \nrapid conditioning of designated public health facilities.  \niv)  Patient  care  and  case  management:  The  government  has  committed  to \nproviding free access to all diagnostic, laboratory and treatment costs of COVID-\n19 patients in public and private facilities.37 \nv)  Infrastructure investment: Government is investing in capacity improvements of \ndesignated  public  facilities,  including  hospitals  that  serve  a  large  internally \ndisplaced people (IDP). \n \n13.  Support to affected businesses (GEL2.11 billion or $671 million). The government \nhas committed a GEL2.11 billion ($671 million) to support most affected businesses, with a focus \non small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This support is expected to contain mass layoffs \nand, therefore, alleviate the socioeconomic severity of the crisis. It will also facilitate recovery \n \n34 Government of Georgia. 2020.

The government has tailored its support package to benefit \nSMEs and firms in the agriculture sector.  \n \n14.  Support to small and medium-sized enterprises. According to Enterprise Georgia,38 an \nestimated 99.7% of all registered firms in Georgia in 2017 were SMEs, which employed 62% of \nall formal workers and 67% of all female hired workers. 39 To avoid mass retrenchment of workers, \nthe government adopted three measures aimed specifically at improving access to finance to \nSMEs: (i) increasing the budgetary allocation to the Credit Guarantee Scheme by GEL300 \nmillion($111 million) to raise the total value of co-financed loans to SMEs to GEL2 billion ($636 \nmillion);  (ii)  expanding  and  upgrading  existing  credit  enhancement  mechanisms  under  the \n\u201cProduce in Georgia\u201d program, 40 which is expected to benefit at least 300 SMEs; and (iii) \nextending GEL40 million ($12.7 million) in grants to micro-entrepreneurs,41 which is expected to \nbenefit up to 5,000 entrepreneurs. In addition to these multi-sectoral measures, the government \nwill provide tax credits to SMEs in the tourism industry\u2014one of the most affected segments, where \n60% of workers are women, many of whom at high risk of job loss. This includes the deferral of \nproperty and income tax until November 2020, which is expected to benefit up to 4,500 SMEs, \nthe provision of an 80% subsidy on interest rate payments for small and medium-sized hotels42 \nfor a period of 6 months, which is expected to benefit up to 2,000 small and medium-sized hotels.  \n \n15.  Support to firms in the agriculture sector. Despite its relatively low contribution to GDP \n(7% in 2019), 40.9%43 of all active working age persons in Georgia work in agriculture\u201497% of \nwhom are self-employed and fall outside existing support systems.44 Further, low baseline \nincomes in the sector suggest that loss of economic activity could have a disproportionately higher \nimpact on the rise in poverty incidence compared with other sectors. As a result, measures to \nsupport firms in the agriculture sector are expected to be effective in mitigating the resurgence in \npoverty incidence. They also complement the government\u2019s efforts to increase domestic food \nproduction, with a view to protecting food insecure households.45 To this end, the government \nadopted a measure ensuring the provision of a 100% subsidy for interest payments on loans \nobtained through the government\u2019s agrocredit project. This measure will benefit up to 5,000 firms \nin the sector, most of which are expected to be SMEs. In addition to this, government will exempt \nagriculture sector firms from paying amelioration fees and will write off any accumulated arrears \non such fees. This measure is expected to benefit up to 40,000 small-holder farmers and \ncontribute toward increasing domestic food production.  \n \n16.  Provision of ample liquidity to all firms. The National Bank of Georgia has adopted a \nrange of countercyclical measures that will ensure the provision of liquidity to the real economy. \nImplementation of additional capital requirements planned for March 2020 were postponed and \ncommercial banks are now allowed to use capital conversion, countercyclical, and related buffers. \n \n38 Enterprise Georgia is an agency of the Ministry of Economy and Development responsible for business support, \nexport promotion and investment in Georgia sectors.

The central bank stands ready to ease credit regulations \nand remove restrictions on lending. It has decreased liquidity coverage ratio limits as well as \nmandatory foreign exchange reserve requirements. Furthermore, criteria for security or pledging \nof repurchase agreements to support local currency liquidity have been updated. Altogether, \nthese measures are expected to free up additional resources of around GEL1.6 billion ($500 \nmillion). \n \n17.  Social Assistance Package (GEL1.035 billion or $329 million). The government has \ncommitted to reducing the negative effects of job and income loss, increasing its support to the \npoor and vulnerable.47 To this end, it has adopted a range of measures that attempt to preserve \njobs and support the livelihoods of people who lose their source of income as a result of the \nCOVID-19 crisis.  \n \n18.  Employment preservation measures. To avoid mass layoffs in the formal sector, the \ngovernment will exempt businesses from income tax charged over GEL750 ($238) of income for \nworkers with incomes up to GEL1,500 ($477) for 6 months, provided these worker\u2019s jobs are \nretained. Up to 300,000 employees are estimated to be covered by this assistance measure. \nWorkers who lose their jobs or who are put on unpaid leave will receive temporary unemployment \nassistance equivalent to GEL200 per month ($63.5) for up to six months. For informal workers, \n50% of whom are estimated to be women,48 and self-employed workers who lose their source of \nincome, the government will provide access to a one-time benefit of GEL300. An estimated \n250,000 workers are expected to benefit from this scheme. The State Employment Support \nAgency in the Ministry of Internally Displaced People from the Occupied Territories, Labour, \nHealth and Social Affairs (MOILHSA) will verify eligibility, avoiding overlaps with the other \nemergency programs. \n \n19.  Cash transfers to vulnerable groups. The government has adopted a wide range of \ntemporary social protection cash transfer measures to alleviate the impact of the crisis on the \npoor and vulnerable, especially women and people living with disabilities. The Targeted Social \nAssistance (TSA) delivery system provides a solid basis to address the temporary shock, with a \nsocial registry (accounting for 30% of the total population) that can facilitate a rapid expansion. \nApplication and registration procedures have been temporarily simplified to facilitate access to \nthe TSA. The threshold has been temporarily expanded from 65,000 to 100,000 (proxy-means \ntest score), with 70,000 households (190,000 citizens) expected to be eligible for GEL600 ($191) \non average in the next 6 months. Households with three or more children under the age of 16, \nare entitled to a top-up benefit of GEL100 per household for 6 months. Household with persons \nwith severe disabilities and disabled children are entitled to an additional GEL200 ($63.5) for  \n6 months. In addition to the expansion of the TSA system, government will also provide a cash \ntransfer of GEL600 ($191) for adults living with acute disabilities and children living with any type \nof disability over 6 months. As many as 41,500 people are expected to benefit from this scheme. \nIn addition to cash transfers to the vulnerable and poor, government will also ensure that the basic \n \n46 The Basel III countercyclical capital buffer is calculated as the weighted average of the buffers in effect in the \njurisdictions to which banks have a credit exposure. \n47 A total of 381,548 jobs\u2014257,365 employees and 124,183 self-employed\u2014are at high risk of job loss because of the \nCOVID-19 crisis. In addition, 23% of the population, or 45% of the total work force, is in the informal sector and at \nhigh risk of loss of income. Most of the self-employed work in agriculture. While this sector is expected to be only \nmoderately affected, the impact on the self-employed will still be substantial, given their low earnings, putting them \nat risk of falling into poverty. L.

To this end, government will subsidize utility fees for three months \n(March, April, May) for electricity and gas, and water bills for households that consume less than \n200 kWh of electricity and 200 cubic meters of natural gas per month. \n \n20.  Ensuring food security. Georgia is a net food importer49 and highly import-dependent \nfor most food categories.50 This puts food security at risk through food export restrictions. Food \nprices had already risen before the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching 13.4% year on year in March \n2020 compared with 6.1% headline inflation, because of exchange rate depreciation.51 The \naverage share of food consumption expenditure was 43% in 2018, which underlines the social \nimportance of food prices. The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Agriculture (MEPA) has \nadopted a range of measures to ensure food security and spur domestic production.52 These \ninclude: (i) ensuring prices for basic foodstuffs;53 (ii) providing crop loans;54 (iii) increasing the \nmaximum  government  contribution  to  finance  fixed  agricultural  assets  from  8%  to  11%;  \n(iv) subsidizing interest rates of up to 10% for food industry;55 (v) securing collateral of up to 50% \nfor livestock working capital loans; (vi) supporting smallholder milk production with GEL3 million \n($0.95  million); 56  (vii)  subsidizing  wheat  imports  with  GEL5.2  million  ($1.65  million);  \n(viii) expanding the Agriculture Insurance Program by GEL9 million ($2.86 million);57 and (ix) \nrenewing the Agricultural Support Program with GEL10 million ($3.18 million).58 The government \nwill focus on SMEs in the agriculture sector, relying on the registry of support schemes to identify \nbeneficiaries. In addition, MEPA, together with the European Union, and the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations, awarded 50 matching grants for a total amount of GEL2.2 \nmillion ($0.7 million) to support food production and security.59 \n \n21.

By increasing health spending, the MOILHSA will help protect all frontline \nmedical workers from contagion, 62% of whom are women. By ensuring that all COVID-19 related \ndiagnosis and treatment are provided free of charge, the government is also safeguarding the \npoorest from a potential increase in out-of-pocket expenditure on health. This is likely to benefit \nwomen-headed households, which spent, an average of 1% more on health care than men-\nheaded households in 2016.60 Under its private sector support package, the government will \nprotect all the 40% of Georgians living near the poverty line, who rely on labor income for their \n \n49 A.

Targeted support to firms in the tourism industry is \nparticularly important to safeguard the economic well-being of Georgian women, who constitute \n60% of hired workers in the sector. Support to SMEs is also of critical importance to safeguard \nprogress made in the economic empowerment of women in recent years. As of 2018, 67% of all \nwomen employed in the private sector worked for SMEs, and 33% of them are now owned or \nmanaged by women (paragraph 14).61 The government\u2019s social assistance package has been \ntailored to mitigate the adverse effects of the COVID-19 crisis on the poor and vulnerable. The \ntemporary unemployment subsidy put in place will help newly laid-off Georgians to sustain their \nlivelihoods until they are able to seek employment opportunities (paragraph 18). This will help \nmitigate resurgence in poverty incidence as a result of frictional unemployment. The package also \nincludes increases in the coverage of the TSA, of which 55% of beneficiaries are women.  This \nwill ensure that individuals who fall into poverty because of COVID-19 are provided adequate \nfinancial support to meet their basic needs (paragraph 19). Finally, the government\u2019s Anti-Crisis \nPlan also includes measures to assist large families as well as people living with acute disabilities.  \n \n22.  Structural Reforms. Georgia\u2019s response to COVID-19 follows a two-pronged approach: \nan initial temporary emergency relief package and the continuation of critical structural reforms to \nensure the adequacy of its social welfare and public health systems within a sustainable macro-\nfiscal framework. As an immediate response to the COVID-19 crisis, the government established \nthe IACC under the direction of the Prime Minister in February 2020. The IACC has taken decisive \nand credible steps to contain the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate the recessionary impact on \nthe economy. The declaration of a national State of Emergency in March 2020 was followed by \nthe publication of an extensive list of containment measures and, in April 2020, the announcement \nof a comprehensive response package supporting health sector resilience, affected businesses, \nand the poor and vulnerable during the crisis. In the medium term, the government is committed \nto pursuing a comprehensive fiscal management and social protection reform program with ADB \nto strengthen inclusive economic growth in the long run within macroprudential limits. This forms \npart of the government\u2019s recovery program. In addition to these reforms, the government remains \ncommitted  to  (i)  structural  policy  reform  in  public  sector management  to  ensure  the fiscal \nsustainability of government operations in the medium term; (ii) capital market reforms to support \nthe de-dollarization of the financial sector and reduce external vulnerabilities; (iii) reforms to the \neducation system to improve job matching, productivity, and wages; (iv) operationalizing pension \nreforms;62 (v) continuing business environment reforms, e.g., requiring corporations to publish \naudited  financial  statements  based  on  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS);  \n(vi) developing land cadasters to help protect property rights and simplify land transactions; and \n(vii) reforms to benefit from Georgia\u2019s free trade agreements (FTAs).63  \n \nB.  Proposed Program and ADB\u2019s Value Addition  \n \n23.  The proposed CARES Program will be a critical component of the government\u2019s efforts to \nmitigate the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the health and welfare of Georgians. It is aligned \nwith the following overarching development objective of the Anti-Crisis Plan: health and economic \nimpacts of COVID-19 in Georgia are mitigated, protecting the most vulnerable. The program will \nhave the following effect: rate of spread of the disease managed, burden on affected businesses \nmitigated  and  poverty  contained.  The  program  is  structured  around  three  output  areas:  \n \n61 ADB staff calculations based on Geostat Gender.

ADB\u2019s  value  addition.  ADB  has  been  a  trusted  partner  of  Georgia  in  emergency \nresponse, public sector management reform, social protection and infrastructure development. \nThe proposed program builds on more than a decade of close cooperation across key policy \nreform areas such as fiscal management and social protection, which will be critical elements of \nthe  government\u2019s  post-pandemic  recovery  response.  Starting  in  2014,  ADB  has  been \ncontinuously engaged in policy dialogue with the government regarding fiscal management and \nsocial protection reform. 64 Under the Second Domestic Resource Mobilization Program,65 ADB is \nstrengthening public sector management and fiscal responsibility while supporting government \nefforts to reform its public pension system\u2014the largest social protection program in the country. \nTo this end, ADB is strengthening the capacity of key government institutions through a carefully \ndesigned  capacity  building  plan  under  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Second  Domestic \nResource Mobilization Program. It is also processing a policy-based loan with a focus on reforms \nin fiscal management and social protection. Underpinning the CARES Program, ADB is providing \ngrant  support to procure medical supplies and equipment, capacity building for the COVID-19 \nhealth response and a platform to share and learn from the response of other countries in the \nregion, funded under the regional technical assistance project Regional Support to Address the \nOutbreak of Coronavirus Disease.66 In addition to the strong base of country knowledge, the \nCARES Program is also informed by lessons learnt through previous policy-based program \nsupport provided to Georgia. Experience through this program provided useful lessons, especially \nthe importance of a clear but realistic DMF, with measurable targets and provision of adequate \nmonitoring support to the government. The Program has drafted the DMF in close coordination \nwith government and has also set up a Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) team to ensure \ntight feedback loops and enhance ADB\u2019s capacity to support the government in overcoming \nemerging challenges throughout the implementation period.  \n \n25.  Alignment with Strategy 2030. The Program is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, \nspecifically the operational priorities on addressing poverty and reducing inequality (through its \nsupport  for  social  programs  that  will  mitigate the  expected  increase  in  poverty  incidence), \naccelerating progress in gender equality (through its gender sensitive targets), and strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity (through support for strengthening the public health sector \nand  social  welfare  system),  and  fostering  regional  cooperation  and  integration  (through \ncomplementarities with the regional TA being provided to help inform health responses based on \nexperience from other countries in the region).67 \n \nC.

The proposed CARES Program provides for about 6.5% of gross \nfinancing requirements for 2020. The remaining gap will be addressed by loans and grants from \ndevelopment partners as well as domestic borrowing, with government deposits available to \nweather against downside risks, if necessary. The IMF, World Bank, the Asian Infrastructure \nInvestment Bank and selected bilateral partners have committed to assist Georgia in accessing \nfinance (Table 2). Total ADB budget support in 2020 will tentatively amount to $630 million, or \n41% of gross financing requirements. This support will help finance Georgia\u2019s countercyclical \neconomic  response  efforts.  Given  the  rise  in  the  yield  spreads  to  US  Treasury  bonds  in \ninternational markets, Georgia aims to reduce its reliance on international capital markets to the \nextent possible. It will also avoid drawing on its international gross reserves, which it has \naccumulated over recent years and amount to $3.5 billion.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Need and Tentative Budget Support by Development Partners 2020  \n($ millions) \nItem  2020 pre- 2020  Thematic Focus \nCOVID-19  COVID-19 \nadjusted \nGross financing requirement  261  1,533a   \nGross foreign financing  234  1,150   \nADB    280b   \n  CARES Program (CPRO)    100   \n  Fiscal Management and Social Protection PBL    TBDc   \n  Modern Skills for Better Jobs (SDP)d    50   \n  Sustainable Water Sanitation Services (SDP)d    50   \n  State Electro System Corporatization (SDP)d    80   \nAIIB    100  Joint DPO World Bank \nEuropean Union     95  Rural development, Education \nFrance (AFD)    205  Social Protection \nGermany (KfW)    100  Energy policy \nIMF    200  Extended Fund Facility \nWorld Bank    180  Health, Education, Emergency Response \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AIIB = Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement, CARES = COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support, CPRO = COVID-19 Pandemic \nResponse Option, DPO = development policy operation, EU = European Union, IMF = International Monetary Fund, \nKfW = Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, PBL = policy-based loan, SDP = sector development program. \na Subject to revision. \nb Amount to be confirmed. \nc Subject to availability of resources and co-financing.  \nd Policy-based component only (budget support).  \nSource: Government of Georgia, Ministry of Finance. \n \n27.  The government has requested a regular loan of \u20ac92,302,000 ($100,000,000 equivalent) \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to provide countercyclical budgetary support for Anti-Crisis \nPlan. The loan will have a 10-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 6.75 years \nand there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n28.  Development Partner Coordination. The government is actively coordinating health, \nsocial, and economic responses with development partners to overcome the pandemic with \ndecisive policy measures. Since February 2020, it has conducted regular IACC meetings on \nCOVID-19 related issues, chaired by the Prime Minister. The IACC is actively cooperating with \n ", "13 \nthe WHO on preparedness and response measures to keep the situation under control. In \npreparing the proposed CARES Program, the ADB team has consulted and coordinated closely \nwith the IMF on Georgia\u2019s macroeconomic situation, and with other multilateral and bilateral \ndevelopment partners on potential financial support packages aimed at mitigating the negative \nimpact caused by COVID-19. The thematic focus of each development partner\u2019s budget support \nprograms  is  described  in  Table  2.  The  proposed  program  provides  critical  support  to  the \ngovernment and complements other stakeholders\u2019 responses. As economic impact of COVID-19 \nbecomes clearer, ADB will consider providing further support to the government and explore co-\nfinancing opportunities. ADB has also begun liaising with relevant development partners involved \nin social protection to coordinate future assistance. These include the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement and the World Bank. ADB will also remain involved in fiscal management reform \nareas, working closely with the IMF to monitor the macroeconomic situation. \n \n29.  Coordination with the IMF. In December 2019, the IMF and the government agreed to \nan extension of the Extended Fund Facility until April 2021 (footnote 14). The IMF will supervise \nthe compliance with performance criteria and structural benchmarks that help sustain medium-\nterm macroeconomic stability. ADB has consistently liaised with the IMF as part of its engagement \nin  public  financial  management  (PFM)  in  Georgia,  under  the  Second  Domestic  Resource \nMobilization  Program  and  associated  technical  assistance  project  (footnote  65).  Recently, \ncoordination with the IMF and other development partners has strengthened to converge around \na coordinated response to the COVID-19 crisis. The IMF welcomes ADB\u2019s financial support to \nGeorgia, which will help prevent the accumulation of more onerous financing. The assessment \nletter from the IMF68 and the debt sustainability assessment from ADB69 confirm that the proposed \nProgram would not worsen the country\u2019s debt sustainability situation. Coordination with the IMF \nand other development partners on the long-term implementation of macroeconomic and financial \nreforms  is  ensured  regionally  through  activities  of  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation program, whose economic and financial stability cluster holds regular high-level \ndialogues on macroeconomic policy design and management.70  \n \n30.  Debt is sustainable in the medium term. Public debt\u2013GDP in Georgia has remained \nstable between 2014\u20132019, consistently below 45%. Although it is expected to rise sharply from \n42.7% of GDP in 2019 to 62.4% in 2020, ADB expects it to remain sustainable over the medium \nterm. The increase in 2020 is largely because of the fiscal stimulus package to mitigate the impact \nof COVID-19 compounded by a decline of 23.3% in revenue collection against the original \nestimate for 2020. The resulting gross financing requirement will be closed primarily through loans \nand grants from development partners and domestic borrowing to accommodate a higher level of \nfiscal deficit to mitigate further downside risks to economic and social development. From 2021 \nonwards, the public debt\u2013GDP ratio is projected to decline as one-off spending measures wane \nand economic growth recovers. It is expected to reach 50.8% of GDP by 2025. Financial \nassistance from ADB will not aggravate Georgia\u2019s debt vulnerabilities and fiscal risks in the \nmedium term. While providing critical countercyclical support to the economy, the proposed ADB \nbudget support loans in 2020 represent just 8.3% of Georgia\u2019s public debt stock of nearly $7.6 \nbillion. Additional loans approved or under proposal by other development partners would jointly \nadd another 11.6% to the public debt stock. Together, lending from all these institutions would lift \npublic debt initially to 72% of GDP in 2020, and to 58% of GDP by 2024. These loans, on broadly \nconcessional terms, will not add significantly to the government\u2019s annual debt service obligations. \n \n \n68 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n69 ADB debt sustainability analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n70 Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program.

The government \nand  ADB  have  agreed  on  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  to  support  effective \nimplementation of Georgia\u2019s COVID-19 response plan. ADB has committed to establishing a \nMonitoring, Evaluation and Learning Lab, which will work closely with MOF and other relevant \ngovernment agencies responsible for the implementation of the program, and support with \nmonitoring and reporting to ADB. The MEL Lab will liaise with the IACC and optimize feedback \nloops  throughout  the  implementation  process  to  allow  for  timely  learning  and  adaptive \nmanagement to the implementing agencies. ADB, through the MOF and the MEL Lab, has \ncommitted  to  mobilizing  TA  resources  to  help  the  government  respond  to  any  emerging \nchallenges in a flexible and agile manner. Ongoing TA project on fiscal management reforms will \nensure policy dialogue with government on the evolution of the macroeconomic situation (footnote \n69). ADB\u2019s regional TA support to the health sector will help contribute to capacity building and \nsharing of regional experiences and lessons (footnote 66). The MOF will monitor budget execution \nand flow of funds for countercyclical measures. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \nThe program implementation period is June 2020 to June 2021.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n32.  Governance.  PFM  systems  have  improved  significantly  in  Georgia  with  the \nimplementation of the PFM reform action plan\u2014minimizing the risks associated with poor financial \nmanagement of this CPRO. According to the most recent Public Expenditure and Financial \nAccountability Assessment (2018) Georgia has sound systems in place for strategic budget \nplanning, execution and accounting and reporting.71 Notable improvements in fiscal discipline are \nreflected in a reduction of variance of expenditure outturn when compared with the budget \n(decreased use of virements) and robust execution rates for revenue and stronger oversight of \naggregate fiscal risk from state-owned enterprises and public-private partnerships. Georgia has \nimproved its strategic allocation of resources through its multi-year budgeting tool and preparation \nof costed sector strategies. Finally, Georgia has witnessed an increase in the efficiency of the use \nof resources for service delivery, with increased effectiveness of payroll controls; internal audit; \ntimelier and more regular reconciliation of accounts; and expansion of the scope and nature of \nfollow-up audits.  \n \n33.  Poverty and Gender. Despite substantial gains, households in Georgia remain highly \nvulnerable to shocks, including those associated with the outbreak of COVID-19. Georgia\u2019s \ncurrent social welfare system covers a relatively high share of the population but may not be \nsufficient to address the needs of its poorest citizens. While 24% of Georgians are beneficiaries \nof at least one social assistance program\u2014with women constituting 64.9% of all recipients\u2014only \n11.7% of Georgians receive a subsistence allowance under the TSA, against 20.1% of people \nliving under the national poverty line. Nevertheless, the high share of women beneficiaries of both \nthe TSA (55%) and the pension fund (71%) suggest that women receive wider coverage from \nsocial welfare programs than men. As of 2018, the share of women living under the relative \npoverty line in Georgia (20.5%) was only marginally lower than that of men (20.6%). Most of the \n61,000 women who received social benefits from government were aged 18\u201359 years (footnote \n12). Of the 61,000 women who received social benefits, 81% received disability pension, while \n18% received survivors\u2019 pension, and 1% received state compensation.

The  proposed  design  and  monitoring \nframework and gender monitoring matrix encourage a gender responsive Anti-Crisis Plan, with \nspecific measures to protect the welfare and livelihoods of women.  \n \n34.  Safeguards. The loan is categorized C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous peoples. The loan funds are not expected to cause land acquisition or adverse impacts \nto  the  environment  or  indigenous  peoples.

Adverse Impact of  The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Georgia was reported on 26 February, imported by a citizen \nExogenous Shocks  returning from Iran via Azerbaijan. As of 19 April 2020, 394 cases had been reported and four deaths \nconfirmed.  The doubling time of total confirmed COVID-19 cases stood at 8.76 days. a The relatively low \nnumber of confirmed cases, deaths and doubling time attests to the effectiveness of the strict containment \nmeasures adopted by the Government on 21 March 2020, as it declared state of emergency. The pandemic \nand ensuing containment and behavioral responses are dampening potential GDP growth in Georgia, \nlowering tax revenues, and putting pressure on the lari (11.2% depreciation against the USD between \nFebruary and April 2020).b Lower growth in trading partners is expected to significantly lower exports  \n(-24%) and remittances (-15%). Heightened global uncertainty will hamper confidence, reduce capital \ninflows (-19% growth in FDI), and delay investment. High headline inflation in 2019\u2014at 7% as a result of \nnominal depreciation\u2014is expected to decrease to 3.5% in 2020 because of lower commodity prices and \nsubdued domestic demand. c According to recent IMF and MOF estimates, reduction in economic activity \nis expected to bring growth to -4 percent in 2020, against the original estimate of 4% growth in 2020 and \nin sharp contrast with the 4.9% growth average in the period 2016\u20132019. c  \n \nGeorgia\u2019s external position in 2019 was favorable. The current account deficit narrowed to a record low \n(5.1 percent of GDP) driven by a favorable trade balance. The completion of significant FDI projects helped \ncontain imports and the NIIP. Gross international reserves reached $3.5 billion in 2019, boosted by the \nforeign exchange interventions by the National Bank of Georgia, larger-than-expected inflows, and lower-\nthan-expected government foreign exchange expenditures. c The COVID-19 shock is expected to widen \nthe current account to 11.3% in 2020, exacerbating pressures on the NIIP and reserves, and weakening \nthe external position. Continued prudent fiscal policy, exchange rate flexibility, and structural reforms \nimplementation  remain  essential  to  safeguarding  external  sustainability  over  the  medium-term.  A \nprotracted crisis is limiting the fiscal space needed to mitigate health and economic impacts. A decline of \n23.3% in revenue collection against the original estimate for 2020, led by a reduction of 1.6% in the  \ntax\u2013GDP ratio, will widen the fiscal deficit to 8.1% against the original estimate of 2.2% of GDP.d The \ngovernment\u2019s ability to meet gross financing needs is further constrained by growing uncertainty in the \nfinancial markets resulting in higher costs of borrowing.  \n \nEconomic  slowdown  in  2020  threatens  the  development  gains  Georgia  achieved  since  2012.  The \nunemployment rate, which reached a record low in 2019 at 11.6% in 2019, could triple if no public \nintervention is adopted to avoid mass layoffs.e Taking into account the measures put in place by the \n ", "Appendix 4       23 \n \nAccess Criteria  Asian Development Bank Assessment \ngovernment to avoid spikes in unemployment, the rate of unemployment is expected to rise to 19% in \n2020. d Such sharp increases in unemployment could eradicate years of inclusive economic growth, \nreversing a decade-long decline in absolute poverty.  While absolute poverty ($1.90/day) has declined \nsharply from 12.2% in 2010 to 3.7% in 2019, the effects of COVID-19 are expected to lead to a rise in \npoverty incidence to 4.3%, in a best-case scenario, or 6.8%, in a worst-case scenario.  Further, as of 2018, \n47% of Georgians were estimated to remain vulnerable to poverty, with monthly incomes precariously \nclose to the poverty line, placing a significant share of the population at risk of poverty due to decline in \ni ncomes and a rise in unemployment.f \n2. Countercyclical  The government announced a GEL3.5 billion ($1.1 billion) Anti-Crisis Plan, to cover higher spending in the \ndevelopment  health sector amounting to GEL350 million ($111 million), provide assistance to affected private sector \nexpenditures   entities worth GEL2,110 million  ($671 million), and support the unemployed, poor and vulnerable with a \nGEL1.035 billion ($329 million) social assistance package. The total expenditure package amounts to 7.4% \nof GDP, one of the highest in the region. The government has also adopted a range of countercyclical \nmonetary policy measures for price stability and adequate liquidity in the financial system. Georgia\u2019s Anti-\nCrisis Plan effectively addresses the needs of the poor and vulnerable including women, children and \npeople living with disabilities across its three areas of focus: (i) health intervention; (ii) support to affected \nbusinesses; and (iii) support to social programs. It\u2019s support to the health system will help protect frontline \nmedical doctors, 62% of which are women, through the procurement of adequate PPEs. Under this Plan, \nthe  government  plans  to  ensure  that  health  services  related  to  COVID-19  are  provided  for  free, \nsafeguarding the poorest in society from increased health expenditure and out-of-pocket payments, and \nwill ensure that it provides COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment services in areas with high density of \nInternally Displaced Persons from the occupied territories.  \n \nUnder its private sector support package, the government will protect all the 40% of Georgians living near \nthe poverty line, who rely on labor income for their livelihoods, by containing mass layoffs. Targeted support \nto firms in the tourism industry is particularly important to safeguard the economic well-being of Georgian \nwomen, who constitute 60% of hired workers in the sector. Support to SMEs is also of critical importance \nto safeguard progress made in the economic empowerment of women in recent years. As of 2018, 67% of \nall women employed in the private sector worked for SMEs, and 33% of them are now owned or managed \nby women. g  \n3.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Georgia\u2019s economy \nmacroeconomic  expanded at an average of 4.7% between 2011\u20132019 and was expected to grow by 4.3% in 2020. Public \nManagement  debt\u2013GDP, the fiscal deficit and total expenditure as a share of GDP were all expected to remain below \ntheir maximum ceilings, at 44.5%, 2.2% and 28.3% respectively. Reforms to tax administration led to a \n ", "24  Appendix 4 \n \nAccess Criteria  Asian Development Bank Assessment \nhigher-than anticipated tax revenue collection, reaching 23.7% of GDP in 2019. g The only significant risk \nfaced by the authorities prior to COVID-19 stemmed from inflationary pressures, which the National Bank \nof Georgia targeted appropriately through tightened monetary policy. The banking sector\u2019s performance \nwas also expected to remain robust, with an increase in credit to the private sector, improved asset quality \nand higher liquidity despite marginally lower profitability. Previous assessment letters and Reviews under \nthe Extended Financing Agreement suggested gradual and continuous improvement of macroeconomic \nmanagement in Georgia. The IMF\u2019s favorable assessment letter confirm ADB staff\u2019s assessment that the \neconomic downturn is due to the COVID-19 pandemic, not to previous macroeconomic mismanagement.  \n4. Structural reforms  38.  Georgia\u2019s response to COVID-19 follows a two-pronged approach: an initial temporary emergency \nand pandemic  relief package and the continuation of critical structural reforms to ensure the adequacy of its social welfare \nresponse plan  and public health systems within a sustainable macro-fiscal framework. As an immediate response to the \nCOVID-19 crisis, the government established the IACC under the direction of the Prime Minister in \nFebruary 2020. The IACC has taken decisive and credible steps to contain the spread of COVID-19 and \nmitigate the recessionary impact on the economy. The declaration of a national state of emergency in \nMarch 2020 was followed by the publication of an extensive list of containment measures and, in April \n2020, the announcement of a comprehensive response package supporting health sector resilience in the \nmedium-term. The health sector response revolves around five key areas of intervention:  \nCase detection and confirmation: The government will procure necessary medical hygiene materials, \nCOVID-19 test kits, laboratory reagents, polymerase chain reaction equipment, and specimen transport \nkits. It will be supported by investment in information technology systems for disease surveillance and \ncontract tracing. \nIsolation of high-risk individuals: The government will ensure that high risk individualsh are placed in \nspecially organized quarantine facilities. \nImproving the quality of medical care: To improve the quality of medical care provided and minimize \nrisks of infection to health personnel, the government will train at least 2,000 medical staff, procure essential \nmedical goods and carry out rapid conditioning of designated public health facilities.  \nPatient care and case management: The government has committed to providing free access to all \ndiagnostic, laboratory and treatment costs of COVID-19 patients in public and private facilities. \nInfrastructure investment: Government is investing in capacity improvements of designated public \nfacilities, including hospitals that serve a large internally displaced persons (IDP). \n \nIn addition to its medium-term health response plan, Georgia has made credible commitments to continue \npursuing structural reforms under International Monetary Fund Extended Fund Facility as well as planned \npolicy reforms supported by ADB. These reforms include (i) structural policy reform in public sector \nmanagement to ensure the fiscal sustainability of government operations in the medium term; (ii) capital \n ", "Appendix 4       25 \n \nAccess Criteria  Asian Development Bank Assessment \nmarket reforms to support the de-dollarization of the financial sector and reduce external vulnerabilities; (iii) \nreforms to the education system to improve job matching, productivity, and wages; (iv) operationalizing \npension reforms; (v) continuing business environment reforms, e.g., requiring corporations to publish \naudited financial statements based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); (vi) developing \nland cadasters to help protect property rights and simplify land transactions; and (vii) reforms to benefit \nfrom Georgia\u2019s free trade agreements (FTAs). \n5. Debt sustainability  Public debt\u2013GDP ratio has been stable in recent years, hovering below 45% of GDP. Despite an expected \nsubstantial increase in 2020, led by temporary spending financed by development partners and domestic \nborrowing, ADB assessment concludes public debt remains stable in all standardized stress tests and is \nexpected to remain sustainable over the medium-term.d The CARES Program will have a minimal impact \non Georgia\u2019s debt\u2013GDP ratio and will amount to 1.03% of public debt in 2020. With the CARES Program, \npublic debt\u2013GDP ratio will increase from 61.6% to 62.4% of GDP. Financial assistance from the ADB will \nnot aggravate Georgia\u2019s debt vulnerabilities and fiscal risks in the medium term. While providing critical \ncountercyclical support to the economy, the proposed ADB loans in the amount of $100 million represent \njust 1.3% percent of Georgia\u2019s public debt stock of nearly $7.6 billion. The planned total amount of ADB \nbudget support for 2020, in the amount of $630 million, represents just 8.3% of Georgia\u2019s public debt stock. \nThese loans will not add significantly to the annual debt service obligations facing the Government. \nAdditional loans approved or under proposal by the World Bank ($180 million), the International Monetary \nFund ($200 million), the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement ($205 million), the KfW ($100 million), the \nEuropean Union ($95 million), and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ($100 million) would jointly \nadd another 11.6% to the public debt stock. Together, lending from all these institutions would lift public \ndebt initially to 72% of GDP in 2020, and to 58% of GDP by 2024. \n6. Coordination the  ADB has consulted with IMF and is in close contact with its relevant staff on macroeconomic monitoring. \nInternational Monetary  IMF has a favorable assessment letter (linked documents 9). In the Assessment Letter, the IMF share ADB \nFund  staff\u2019s assessment that the government\u2019s fiscal response to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic \non the economy is appropriate. The IMF considers that despite a spite a sharp increase in the public debt\u2013\nGDP ratio in 2020, medium-term fiscal consolidation will bring public debt (net of government deposits) \nbelow 45% of GDP by 2024 and is sustainable in the medium-term. The IMF has reached staff-level \nagreement on an augmentation of access of 130% of quota under the Extended Fund Facility, helping the \ngovernment meet shock-related needs, and build buffers. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; CARES = COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease; FTA = free trade agreement; \nGDP = gross domestic product; IACC = Inter Agency Coordination Council; IDP = internally displaced person; IFRS = International Financial Reporting Standards; IMF \n= International Monetary Fund; KfW = Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau; MOF = Ministry of Finance; NIIP = net international investment position; PPE = personal protective \nequipment; SME = small and medium-sized enterprise. \na Information retried from StopCov.ge on 20 April 2020. \nb National Bank of Georgia.
