The study highlighted the adverse impact of rising food prices on \npoverty,  and  the  attendant  negative  effects  of  food  price  volatility  on  population  and  health. 2 \nADB\u2019s  support  in  agriculture  will  help  create  and  expand  economic  opportunities  and  promote \nbroader  access  to  these  opportunities  to  support  inclusive  economic  growth  and  reduce \nvulnerability and inequality.3 \n \n3. \nResponding  to  the  decision  to  expand  operations  in  agricultural  businesses,  ADB \nidentified Le Gaga, a greenhouse vegetable producer in the PRC, as having a proven business \nmodel and proprietary technology to (i) increase the productivity of agriculture, (ii) promote food \nsafety  and  quality  standards,  and  (iii)  improve  the  resilience  of  agriculture  to  the  impacts  of \ndisasters  and  climate  change,  all  of  which  are  ADB  aims  according  to  its  Midterm  Review  of \nStrategy 2020.3 \n \n4. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  a  key  goal  of  the  PRC\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  (2011\u2013\n2015), i.e., to boost the agriculture sector and farmers\u2019 benefits.4 The plan calls for (i) speeding \nup  the  development  of  modern  agriculture,  (ii)  increasing  farmers\u2019  income,  (iii)  improving  the \nliving  and  production  conditions  in  rural  areas,  and  (iv)  improving  rural  development \nmechanisms and institutions. The project is selected for its satisfactory fit with ADB\u2019s strategic, \ncountry,  and  sector  approaches  to  poverty  reduction.  The  project  represents  the  first  private \nsector opportunity for ADB to provide direct assistance to the farming industry in the PRC. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n \nThe  project  will  support  Le  Gaga  in  establishing  and  expanding  a  series  of  modern \n5. \ngreenhouse  operations  in  Guangdong  and  Fujian  provinces,  which  have  optimal  weather  and \nadequate  infrastructure  for  vegetable  production,  particularly  for  providing  (mainly  in  winter)  \noff-season vegetables to the entire PRC and some neighboring countries. All the greenhouses \nare built on leased farmland and operated by PRC companies owned and controlled 100% by \nLe Gaga. \n \n6. \nLe Gaga maximizes its greenhouse operations by (i) customizing them to mitigate local \nweather risk and disease pressure; (ii) building structures that are more efficiently laid out, taller, \nand connected to create a uniform growing environment; (iii) adopting temperature and airflow \ncontrol,  and  (iv)  using  advanced  drip  irrigation  systems.  Le  Gaga  is  also  accelerating  the \n\n                                                      \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2013.

Beijing. \n\n\f 2\n\nconversion  to  soilless  greenhouse  production,  which  has  been  proved  to  further  increase \nproductivity, enhance efficiency, and improve quality. \n \n7. \nThe project is designed to be a least-cost solution to financing agricultural development, \nwhich  on  a  stand-alone  site-specific  basis  could  involve  relatively  high  transaction  costs.  ADB \nand  Le  Gaga  aim  to  expand  the  operations  under  a  portfolio  approach  (financing  multiple  \nsub-projects with common natures under one facility) to reduce transaction costs and diversify \nthe  risk  of  adverse  natural  conditions.  The  portfolio  approach,  which  is  broader  in  reach,  will \nimpact \nenable  ADB\u2019s  assistance \ndissemination. \n \n\nin  geographic  coverage  and \n\nincrease  efficiency \n\nto \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsor \n\n \n8. \nThe  project  sponsor  and  borrower,  Le  Gaga  Holdings  Limited,  is  a  holding  company \nincorporated in Cayman Islands. Its subsidiaries operate as greenhouse vegetable producers in \nthe  PRC.  Since  its  initial  public  offering  in October  2010,  Le  Gaga  has  been  publicly  listed  on \nthe NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ). \n \n9. \nLe Gaga specializes in modern greenhouse farming (as opposed to traditional open-field \nfarming)  with  multi-arched,  steel-framed  structures  that  have  retractable  walls  and  head \nwindows and use only natural sunlight and natural ventilation to create a favorable microclimate \nconducive  to  off-season  vegetable  production.  To  cultivate  the  farms,  Le  Gaga  hires  farmers, \nmostly  women,  and  both  local  and  migrant  workers.  Le  Gaga  grows  mainly  solanaceous \nvegetables  during  off-seasons,  which  command  higher  selling  prices,  but  complements  its \nproduct mix with leafy and cruciferous vegetables.5 \n \n10. \nLe  Gaga\u2019s  competitive  edge  lies  in  its  unique  greenhouse-based  production  process. \nSince its inception in 2004, it has developed a comprehensive database in planning each stage \nfrom seed selection to crop production to harvesting, including information on weather patterns \nand  historical  vegetable  price  movements \nresearch, \nexperimentation, and experience, Le Gaga\u2019s farming technology has evolved to (i) customizing \nits  greenhouse  structure  and  layout;  and  (ii)  using  a  soilless  production  system  that  promotes \nresource conservation and efficiency and improves product yield and quality. \n \n11. \nThe  vegetables  of  Le  Gaga  are  sold  mainly  to  wholesalers  in  the  PRC  for  distribution \nacross  the  country,  including  urban  cities  with  increasingly  high  demand  for  quality  produce. \nSome  of  the  wholesalers  export  the  produce  to  neighboring  countries  such  as  Japan  and  the \nRepublic of Korea. By selling primarily to these market segments, Le Gaga is able to focus on \nits core business of growing high-quality off-season vegetables. Le Gaga is able to capitalize on \nits greenhouse technology, market positioning, and superior quality, which allows it to take full \nadvantage of seasonal pricing differences and avoid selling into a highly commoditized market. \n \nB. \n \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n\nregions.  Through \n\nin  various \n\n1. \n\nImpacts \n\n \n12. \nThe development impact of the project will be the increased availability of quality, fresh, \nand  nutritious  food  all  year around,  which  helps  increase the  awareness  about and satisfy \nthe    demand  for  high-quality  and  safe  food  products  in  the  PRC.  The  project  is  essential  in \n                                                      \n5  Solanaceous vegetables include tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, pumpkins, and cucumbers. Leafy vegetables include bok \n\nchoy, shanghai greens, and choi sum. Cruciferous vegetables include broccoli, Chinese cabbage, and lettuce.  \n\n\fdeveloping  an  efficient  and  sustainable  venue for the  upstream  agricultural  value  chain,  which \nhelps the country realize the economic, social, and ecological benefits of sector modernization \nand seek the full potential of agriculture for inclusive and sustainable growth. \n \nAgricultural  development  in  the  PRC  is  still  in  transition  to  modernization,  and  food \n13. \nsecurity, food safety, and efficient supply of primary products are yet to be fully achieved. The \nrapid  growth  of  the  national  economy,  an  accelerated  level  of  urbanization,  and  continued  \nimprovement  of  people\u2019s  living  standards  mean  that  awareness  of  health,  nutrition,  and  food \nsafety  issues  as  well  as  demand  for  quality  vegetables  are  also  steadily  rising.  Greenhouse \nfarming is acknowledged as an effective solution to these issues. As a critical source of quality \nsupply,  which  stably  supplements  traditional  farming,  it  can  better  serve  the  national  and \nneighboring  markets  by  helping  alleviate  the  demand\u2013supply  gap  and  price  volatility  of  key \nnutritious produce all year around. \n \n14. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  serve  as  a  catalyst  for  private  sector  development  and \nparticipation,  which  is  still  limited  to  upstream  productivity  enhancement  in  the  agriculture \nsector.  As  outlined  in  Le  Gaga\u2019s growth  plan,  increased  agricultural  involvement  of the  private \nsector will lead to the expansion of related industries such as food processing and distribution. \nThe project\u2019s forward and backward links between agriculture and non-agriculture industries will \ncatalyze  broader  economic  transition  by  stimulating  growth  in  the  secondary  and  tertiary \nsectors,  which  are  the  primary  domain  of  the  private  sector.  Growth  outside  agriculture  also \nhelps stimulate the agriculture sector, particularly through the reverse-link effects of urbanization \non demand for high-value agricultural products, which is the project\u2019s focus. \n \nIncreasing  scarcity  of  water  and  arable  land  and  weather  volatility  threaten  the  PRC\u2019s \n15. \nefforts to meet its objectives for food security and safety, rural livelihoods, and natural resource \nmanagement.  The  project\u2019s  modern  agricultural  production  helps  the  country  achieve  these \nobjectives  because  it  supports  high  yields  of  quality  produce,  resource  conservation,  and \nenvironmental protection at the same time. \n \n16. \nVegetable  farming  still  is  a  fragmented  industry,  and  modern  greenhouse  know-how  is \nnot widely available to most producers in the PRC. Le Gaga achieves the highest greenhouse \ncoverage  ratio  in  the  industry  and  is  leading  its  peers  through  its  effective  combination  of \nintensive research and development, comprehensive market intelligence, advanced horticultural \ntechnologies, cost control, and marketing and distribution networks to build its brand. Le Gaga\u2019s \nexpanded greenhouse operations will strongly demonstrate a proven approach, which Le Gaga \nwill keep upgrading. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n \nThe  project\u2019s  expected  outcome  is  demonstrated  viability  and  productivity  gains  in \n17. \ngreenhouse farming. By accelerating agriculture modernization through industrialized production \nmanagement, the project will contribute to the transformation to and growth of competitive and \ndynamic  greenhouse  farming  that  achieves  higher  productivity  and  integration  of  industry  and \nmarkets,  increases  farm  and  nonfarm  employment,  and  improves  rural  livelihoods  of  farmers \nand  vulnerable  groups,  including  women  and  the  aged.  On-farm  employment  is  critically \nimportant  to  the  rural  farmers  as  well  as  the  landless  and  vulnerable  people,  who  are  usually \npoor  and  unskilled.  Greenhouse  farming  is  labor-intensive  in  nature  and  the  increasing \nagricultural  yield  realized  by  the  project  will  boost  the  demand  for  labor  and  increase \nemployment and wages. \n \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f 4\n\nThe project\u2019s impact comes not only in direct forms, but also from its off-farm activities. \n18. \nIn  addition  to  expanded  demand  for  manufactured  products  such  as  greenhouse  materials, \nfertilizers,  and  packaging  goods,  rising  agricultural  labor  incomes  will  be  spent  on  off-farm \nproducts and services like household goods and rural and urban services, including education, \nhealth  care,  and  financial  and  domestic  services.  Many  of  these  demands  can  be  efficiently \ncaptured by local small and medium-sized enterprises. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput \n\n \n19. \nThe output of the project is the successful completion of Le Gaga\u2019s expansion of modern \ngreenhouse  facilities  in  Guangdong  and  Fujian  provinces.  Direct  benefits  brought  by  the \nexpansion include the procurement of local goods and services for construction. \n \nC. \n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 \n\n \n20. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  which  strongly \nemphasizes  food  security  and  agricultural  productivity,  and  committed  about  $2  billion  in  new \nfunding annually to remove country-specific and regional constraints to food security and reduce \nthe vulnerability of poor populations to food price increases (footnote 3). The project fully meets \nthe  strategic  objective  for  poverty  reduction  by  promoting  inclusive  economic  growth  through \nincreased  productivity.  The  project  also  aligns  with  the  objective  of  promoting  private  sector \ndevelopment and private sector operations, and the focus on inclusive growth. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Country Strategy \n\n \n21. \nADB\u2019s  PRC  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015  identifies  agriculture  and  natural \nresources  as  one  of  four  priority  sectors  of  ADB  support  for  inclusive  and  environmentally \nsustainable  development. 6 Private  sector  development  remains  a  key  driver  of  change.  The \nTwelfth  Five-Year  Plan  (2011\u20132015)  of  the  PRC  shares  this  development  agenda  and  places \nnational  priority  on  agricultural  and  rural  development  with  specific  emphasis  on  agricultural \nmodernization and improvement of farmers\u2019 living standards, along with resource conservation, \nenvironmental  protection,  and  social  inclusion  elements. The  project  is fully  aligned  with  these \nnational priorities by promoting industrial management of agriculture with advanced horticultural \ntechniques and increasing productivity and income opportunities for rural farmers. \n \n\n3. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy \n\n \n22. \nADB\u2019s  operational  plan  for  sustainable  food  security  supports  its  intervention  in \nagriculture  and  rural  development,  particularly the  aim to  boost  primary production, strengthen \nlinks along food and agricultural value chains, ensure food security for the poor and vulnerable, \nand increase their participation in economic activities.7 The plan suggests expanded partnership \nwith  the  private  sector  to  attract  more  direct  investments  in  productivity  enhancement.  The \nproject  fully  meets  the  sector  strategy  by  seeking  to  upgrade  inclusive  food  and  agricultural \nvalue chains, which enhance agricultural productivity, broaden the rural economy with expanded \nincome  channels,  promote  sector  integration  and  efficiency,  and  improve  food  security  for  the \nurban and rural poor. \n \n                                                      \n6  ADB. 2012.

Materials  such  as  plastic  film,  cement,  steel,  and  tubing  are  all \nsourced locally and will be procured in a transparent manner. \nEach farm is led by a management team with extensive experience in agricultural production \nand  in  managing  modern  farms. Local and migrant  workers  are hired  for  planting, sowing, \nand harvesting. Le Gaga has long-standing relationships with its suppliers.a \nLe  Gaga sells  its  produce  primarily  to  various  wholesalers in  the  PRC.  These  wholesalers \ntypically pick up vegetables at the farms to distribute them to retailers and traders. \nLe Gaga will report on its operations and financial performance, including key indicators and \nrelevant  ratios,  to  measure  its  performance,  including  information  relating  to  development \neffectiveness and environmental and social issues. \n\nOperational \narrangements \n\nPerformance \nmonitoring \n\nSales \n\na  Le  Gaga  will  follow  applicable  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)    for \n\nprocurement of goods and services from ADB member countries. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nADB\u2019s proposed assistance to Le Gaga comprises (i) a direct loan of up to $80 million, \n25. \nand  (ii)  a  B-loan  of  up  to  $60  million  equivalent  in  US  dollars  and/or  euros.  ADB  will  fund  the \ndirect  loan  from  its  ordinary  capital  resources;  the  B-loan  will  be  funded  by  participating \ncommercial banks. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nwill support the government\u2019s development plan and ADB\u2019s operation strategies. \n\nADB\u2019s  assistance  is  justified  by  its  development  impacts  and  demonstration  effects.  It \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  long-term  debt  financing  to  private-sector  agriculture  projects  almost  does \nnot exist in the PRC.8 The project will have a significant demonstration effect as it \nfeatures  a  strong  model  for  minimizing  the  transaction  costs  for  agricultural \nfinancing, which is disproportionately high due to perceived risks among potential \nlenders without sufficient sector experience. \nThe  project  will  directly  provide  thousands  of  jobs  to  poor,  unskilled  farmers, \nmost of whom are women and/or aged people from poor rural areas. \n\n                                                      \n8 The lending to agriculture sector is not a main focus of commercial banks in the PRC while the support from policy banks is \n\nlimited. Most of the loans in the sector are for short-term working capital purpose. \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f 6\n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  project  will  tremendously  increase  productivity  on  Le  Gaga\u2019s  farms;  help \nconserve  arable  land,  water,  and  energy;  improve  product  quality;  protect  the \nenvironment; and increase employment opportunities for women. \nThe prospect of the project\u2019s financial success is promising under the proposed \ntransaction structure. \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n27. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment  because  the  potential  adverse \nenvironmental impacts of the group\u2019s subprojects are site-specific and reversible based on the \nnature  of  the  project.  The  initial  environmental  examination  will  include  an  environmental \nmanagement  plan  to  manage  possible  environmental  impacts  during  construction  and \noperation. The ESMS will also include a screening checklist to avoid environmentally sensitive \nareas and potential significant adverse impacts. \n \nThe project is classified as category C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous \n28. \npeoples. The project is not expected to entail any involuntary resettlement. Land acquisition is \nbased  on  the  willing  lessor\u2013willing  lessee  principle  and  involves  only  existing  farmland. \nConstruction  and  operation  of  greenhouse  facilities  will  be  mainly  on  existing  farmland  in  the \ncoastal  provinces,  and  therefore  the  project  will  not  have  any  adverse  impact  on  ethnic \nminorities. \n \n29. \nThe social corrective action plan for the ESMS includes the design and implementation \nof  (i)  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  screening  and  categorization  procedures;  (ii)  involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples policy principles and procedures, including those for land \nleasing  arrangement,  to  make  sure  that  subprojects  using  ADB  funds  are  screened  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement; and (iii) an effective grievance mechanism \nwith proper documentation. Le Gaga will recruit capable staff and/or consultants to ensure that \nthe ESMS is duly implemented. \n \n30. \nOther  social  dimensions.  The  project  is  categorized  as  some  gender  elements.  Le \nGaga  upholds gender  equality,  and  provides  equal  benefits  and  training  opportunities for  both \nmen and women employees. Jobs to be created by farms will be offered to the local labor force \nregardless of gender, and priority will be given to the female labor force where interest is high in \nagricultural  production.  Le  Gaga  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  and  shall \ntake  measures  to  comply  with  the  national  labor  laws  and  relevant  internationally  recognized \ncore labor standards.9 \n \nB. \n \n31. \nLe  Gaga  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best  international  practice  in \ncombating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.
