The  report  also  describes  proposed technical  assistance  (TA)  to  be  provided  by  the \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the \nRepublic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund for Developing the Capital Market, \nand  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  policy-based  loans,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2. \nThe  program  will  provide  budget  support  to  enhance  the  role  of  capital  markets  in \nfinancial  intermediation  and  resource  mobilization  in  the  economy  by  improving  the  allocative \nefficiency  between  savings  and  investment  through  expanding  as  well  as  diversifying  the \ninvestor base.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  government\u2019s  Vision  2021  lays  out  a  roadmap  for  Bangladesh  to  attain  middle-\nincome status by 2021.3 It sets targets of reaching 8% gross domestic product annual growth by \nFY2015  and  10%  by  FY2021.  The  government\u2019s  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan,  FY2011\u2013FY2015 \nincludes a growth strategy to boost the rate of private investment and foster structural change. 4 \nIf  Bangladesh  is  to  attain  its  gross  domestic  product  growth  targets,  it  will  have  to  address \nstructural deficiencies in the capital markets\u2014by deregulating the financial system to support the \nreal economy and promote private sector investment to reduce the infrastructure deficit, which is a \nmajor constraint to its sustainable and higher economic growth. \n \nGovernment  efforts  and  ADB  policy  dialogues.  Building on ADB\u2019s experience in the \n4. \nsector, 5  the  government  and  ADB  pursued  a  two-track  approach  to  address  structural \ndeficiencies  in  the  capital  markets  under  the  recently  concluded  Second  Capital  Market \nDevelopment Program: market stabilization and sustainable market development.6  \n \n5. \nFollowing the stock market debacle in December 2010, where massive sell-off occurred \nas investors lost trust in the market and the regulatory agencies, the government implemented \nstabilization  reforms  under  the  second  program,  such  as  regulations  on  margin  lending  and \nequity  exposure  of  banks,  as  well as  enhanced  oversight  and  policy  coordination.  The  market \nhas gradually regained confidence, reflecting increasing traction from the policies and regulatory \nreforms. The market has stabilized, as evidenced by the 31% increase in market capitalization \nfrom $33.0 billion in February 2011 to $43.2 billion (as of September 2015). The contribution of \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Third  Capital  Market  Development  Program  (TA \n\n8512-BAN). \n\nFY2015.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nthe  banking  sector  has  shown  a  well-received  significant  reduction  of  exposure  to  the  stock \nmarket, and declined from 28.8% in December 2010 to 14.4% at the end of August 2015. The \nturnover ratios in 2014 and 2015 are comparable with levels recorded from 2004 to 2006, when \nthe  market  was  functioning  in  a  stable  environment.  Dhaka  Stock  Exchange\u2019s  average  daily \nturnover  as  a  percentage  of  market  capitalization  from  January  2014  to  September  2015  was \n0.15% compared with a high of 0.73% on 6 December 2010.7 \n \n6. \nThe second program also brought about reforms that set the foundation for sustainable \nmarket development through the passage of critical legislation, which included amendments to \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission Act, 1993; the Securities and Exchange Ordinance, \n1969;  the  Bank  Companies  Act,  2013;  the  Income  Tax  Ordinance,  1984;  and  the  Stamp  Act, \n1899; as well as enactment of the Demutualization Act, 2013 and the Financial Reporting Act, \n2015.  The  operational  and  financial  efficiency  of  the  Bangladesh  Securities  and  Exchange \nCommission (BSEC) was enhanced by allowing unhindered access to the BSEC Fund as well \nas  removing  government  approval  of  the  BSEC  budget  or  expenditures  from  the  BSEC  Fund. \nThe  operationalization  of  a  state-of-the-art  market  surveillance  system  at  BSEC  increased  the \ntransparency  of  market  transactions  and  contributed  significantly  to  enhanced  investor \nconfidence.  Stock  exchanges  were  identified  as  critical  drivers  of  change  under  the  second \nprogram.  The  governance  structure  was  corrected  through  demutualization  of  the  Dhaka  and \nChittagong stock exchanges, which aligned the broader incentives of market development with \nthose  of  the  \u201cclub  members,\u201d  mainly  the  brokers  and  dealers.  Bond  market  development  was \nalso  supported  by  implementing  a  fast-track  regulatory  process  for  private  placements  that \nbalanced investor protection with ease of approval, and removing tax distortions to trigger bond \nmarket activity. \n \n7. \nmajor strides toward strengthening its capital markets, the following constraints remain:8 \n \n\nRemaining  sustainable  market  development  constraints.  Despite  Bangladesh\u2019s \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nBSEC staffing remains inadequate, which restricts the regulator from carrying out \nits  mandate  effectively.  Furthermore,  the  absence  of  an  information  and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT)  system  at  BSEC  limits  the  effectiveness  of  the \nregulator. These organizational constraints affect market confidence. \nThe  entry  of  strategic  investors  as  key  shareholders  in  both  stock  exchanges  is \nrequired  to  ensure  successful  completion  of  the  demutualization  process.  The \nabsence  of  such  strategic  investors  prevents  the  development  of  necessary  new \ntechnology  infrastructure  and  constrains  the  drive  for  innovation  and  overall \ndevelopment of the capital market. \nThe  capital  market  participation  of  institutional  investors,  such  as  insurance \ncompanies, is limited. Most of the regulatory legislation under the Insurance Act, \n2010 is yet to be adopted by the Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority \n(IDRA), such as asset investment regulations and recapitalization measures. With \nregard  to  mutual  fund  demand,  impediments  curtail  growth  such  as  an  uneven \nplaying  field  between  different  types  of  mutual  funds,  and  a  limited  range  of \nmutual fund types. \n\n(iv)  Supply  of  equities  is  deterred  by  the  current  initial  public  offering  (IPO)  book-\nbuilding method, which restricts price discovery. Demand for equities is hampered \n\n                                                 \n7  Second  Capital  Market  Development  Program:  Impact  and  Results  Assessment  (accessible  from  the  list  of \n\n8  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Finance  (Capital  Markets)  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n\f3 \n\nby unreliable accounting and auditing standards of listed companies, which prevent \ninformed  investment  decisions,  as  well  as  an  IPO  lock-in  period  of  3  years  for \nlicensed private equity investor, which hinders private equity fund activity. Demand \nfor  bonds  is  constrained  by  the  prevalence  of  fiscal  dominance,  which  prevents \ncompetitive  auctioning  of  government  securities  based  on  market  prices. \nConsequently,  primary  dealers  hold  their  portfolio  of  government  securities  until \nmaturity  to  minimize  losses,  which  impedes  the  development  of  a  secondary \ngovernment  bond  market.  The  corporate  bond  market,  therefore,  hardly  exists \nbecause of the absence of a credible government yield curve. \nThe  absence  of  alternative  financial  instruments  limits  the  depth  and  breadth  of \nBangladesh\u2019s  capital  markets.  The  lack  of  a  regulatory  framework  for  alternative \nfinancial instruments, such as derivatives and sukuks (Sharia-compliant bonds), is a \nmajor  factor  for  the  absence  of  such  instruments.  The  absence  of  a  clearing  and \nsettlement company also prevents the promotion of derivatives because of the lack \nof critical market infrastructure required for netting of transactions. \n\n(v) \n\n \nTo  address  the  constraints,  the  government  and  ADB  agreed  to  build  on  stabilization \n8. \nmeasures  introduced  by  the  second  program  and  implement  the  road  map  in  the  long-term \nnational capital market master plan that was formulated as a second program policy action. The \nprogram will deepen and broaden the outreach of the second program reforms by (i) extending \nthe  government  yield  curve  and,  therefore,  promoting  a  more  liquid  government  bond  market \nand  eventually  corporate  bond  market;  (ii)  catalyzing  institutional  investor  demand  by \nbroadening,  deepening,  and  diversifying  the  investor  base;  and  (iii)  enhancing  the  supply  of \nalternative financial instruments. \n \n9. \nLinkage between reform program and budget support. The structural reforms under \nthe program include costly measures, such as a significant enhancement in the regulatory and \nenforcement capacity of BSEC and IDRA, as well as an upward shift in the rates of treasury bills \nand bonds to be more aligned with market rates. Budget support is crucial to support costs to \nimplement the reform program. Since the reforms are an integral part of a government-owned \nlong-term  development  strategy  (i.e.,  the  long-term  national  capital  market  master  plan),  the \ngovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  institute  the  capital  market  reform  program,  as  well  as  its  ability \nand political will to implement the needed reforms, are firm (Appendix 3). \n \n10. \nADB\u2019s  value  additions.  Since  the  late  1980s,  the  government  and  ADB  have \nconducted  extensive  policy  dialogues  on  capital  market  development.9 The  dialogue  provided \nthe basis for project support that improved good governance practices in the capital market and \nthe insurance sector, which led to the establishment of a new insurance regulatory authority in \n2010.10 The  Improvement  of  Capital  Market  and  Insurance  Governance  Project  (footnote  10) \nalso contributed to the formulation of the second program, which was built from other key inputs, \nsuch  as  project  preparatory  TA  in  2011,  a  study  of  the  role  of  banks  in  Bangladesh\u2019s  stock \nmarket  volatility  in  June  2011,  and  a  study  on  demutualization  of  stock  exchanges  in \nBangladesh in 2012. The program includes reforms that are part of the national capital market \n\n                                                 \n9  Since  1993,  ADB  has  approved  two  major  programs  that  includes  the  Capital  Market  Development  Program  in \n1997 as well as 18 TA projects in capital market development, which have built the reform momentum leading to \nthe  proposed  program.  Through  these  programs,  ADB  has  uniquely  gained  an  in-depth  understanding  of \nBangladesh\u2019s capital markets for effectively managing reforms. Development Coordination (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Improvement  of  Capital  Market  and  Insurance  Governance  Project. \nManila. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nto  develop  Bangladesh\u2019s  primary  dealer  system \n\nmaster plan approved by the government under the second program, and is built from diverse \ninputs that include its project preparatory TA in 2014, the second program attached TA in 2013\u2013\n2014,  and  a  study \nin  2013\u20132014. \nComprehensive  stakeholder  consultations  were  held  through  numerous  national  workshops  to \nanalyze  the  issues  effectively.11 A  major  outcome  of  ADB\u2019s  deep  involvement  in  Bangladesh\u2019s \ncapital  markets  is  the  promotion  of  BSEC  to  category  A  membership  of  the  International \nOrganization of Securities Commissions in December 2013. \n \nADB\u2019s intensive engagement with the government over the past 25 years has ensured \n11. \nthat  it  is  the  lead  development  partner  for  capital  market  development  in  Bangladesh.  ADB\u2019s  \nstrength lies in its integrated policy support, which focuses on \u201chow to do it\u201d and covers (i) policy \ndialogue,  (ii)  structure  and  design  of  tailor-made  policy  reforms,  (iii)  policy  implementation \nsupport, (iv) capacity development through TA to ensure sustainability, and (v) procurement of \ninformation technology systems to strengthen operations. Few development partners have the \nsame level of credibility, the means, or the capacity to offer this solutions-based approach that \ncan  effectively  and  consistently  tailor  these  best  practices  to  the  needs  and  conditions  of \nBangladesh\u2019s  capital  markets.  In  the  absence  of  ADB  involvement  in  capital  market  reforms, \nand given the complexities, resources, and expertise, such reforms would not have happened. \n \n12. \nDevelopment  coordination.  The  development  partner  coordination  arrangement  is \nguided by the Bangladesh Joint Cooperation Strategy, 2010\u20132015.12 The International Monetary \nFund, the World Bank, and ADB are the key development partners supporting the government \nin undertaking finance sector reforms. In April 2012, the International Monetary Fund approved \nan  Extended  Credit  Facility  of  about  $1  billion  for  Bangladesh  with  the  objective  of  restoring \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  strengthening  the  external  position.  Two  tranches  (about \n$140 million  each)  remain  for  completion  of  the  Extended  Credit  Facility.  The  World  Bank\u2019s \nproposed  $300  million  Financial  Sector  Support  Project  in  2015  will  emphasize  strengthening \nthe regulatory capacity of Bangladesh Bank and developing the insurance sector in areas that \ncomplement  ADB\u2019s  program.  ADB  is  the  lead  development  partner  for  capital  market \ndevelopment and retains this role under the program. \n \n13. \nAlignment  with  ADB\u2019s  strategy  and  lessons  learned.  ADB\u2019s  finance  sector  strategy \nfor  Bangladesh,  which  is  included  in  the  country  partnership  strategy  and  the  new  country \noperations  business  plan,  is  based  on  the  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan,  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  previous \nfinance sector interventions, and coordination with other development partners.13 In line with the \nSixth  Five-Year  Plan  and  the  Midterm  Review  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  priorities,  capital  market \ndevelopment and bond market development focusing on the provision of long-term infrastructure \nis  one  of  ADB\u2019s  focus  areas  in  its  Bangladesh  public  sector  operations.14 The  program  is  fully \naligned  with  the  government\u2019s  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan,  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020,  and  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy for Bangladesh. \n \n14. \nThe  program  (Appendix  4)  will  build  on  lessons  from  the  second  program  completion, \nthe  first  program  performance  audit  report,  and  the  review  by  ADB\u2019s  Independent  Evaluation \n\n                                                 \n11 Eight  national  stakeholder  and  dissemination  workshops  were  held  for  demutualizing  the  stock  exchanges, \n\ndeveloping the primary dealer system, and formulating the second program and the proposed third program. \n\n12 Government  of  Bangladesh.  2010.

The outcome will \nbe enhanced capacity and size of the capital market in a strong legal and regulatory framework. \nThe  program  has  8  first  tranche  policy  actions  and  18  second  tranche  policy  actions.  All  first \ntranche policy actions are fully complied. \n \nC. \n \n16. \nStrengthened  market  stability.  The  output  will  promote  more  robust,  resilient,  and \nstable capital markets by enhancing BSEC\u2019s role to develop and monitor the market, strengthen \nregulatory measures, and develop a clearing and settlement company. The approval of BSEC\u2019s \norganogram  will  significantly  enhance  its  regulatory  and  enforcement  capacity  as  well  as \npromote market stability through the induction of additional full-time staff. The installation of an \nICT  system  at  BSEC  will  create  synergistic  effects  at  the  regulatory  agency  by  raising \nproductivity levels. In line with international best practice, amendment of the IPO book-building \nrules  to  make  the  price  discovery  method  more  effective  will  promote  equity  financing.  The \noutput  will  facilitate  the  establishment  of  a  clearing  and  settlement  company,  which  will \neventually  enable  a  central  counterparty  entity  to  be  guarantor  for  settlement  of  derivative \ncontracts. \n \n17. \nEnhanced  market  facilitation.  The  output  will  support  more  efficient  mobilization  and \nallocation  of  resources  in  the  economy  by  expediting  adjudication  of  enforcement  actions, \nupgrading  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  and  pursuing  demutualization  of  the  stock \nexchanges. The enhanced enforcement capacity at BSEC will be complemented by expedited \nadjudication  of  enforcement  actions  through  the  operationalization  of  a  special  tribunal  for \ncapital  market-related  cases.  The  establishment  of  an  adequately  funded  financial  reporting \ncouncil (i.e., an independent audit oversight authority) will lead to adoption of the International \nAccounting  Standards  and  International  Standards  on  Auditing,  which  will  enhance  market \nconfidence and allow for informed investment decisions. The demutualization will also facilitate \nthe development of crucial new technology infrastructure through the entry of strategic investors \ninto both stock exchanges by the end of 2016. \n \n18. \nEnhanced  supply  measures. The output will increase the supply of quality bonds and \nalternative  financial  instruments  through  the  capital  markets.  Numerous  measures  will  be \nintroduced to catalyze the corporate bond market such as removal of  the 60:40 debt-to-equity \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB.  2015.

A reduction in the IPO lock-in period for licensed private equity investors will spur \nprivate equity fund activity in the capital markets and increase demand for equities. Alternative \nfinancial instruments (derivatives and sukuks) will be promoted to develop a deeper and broader \ncapital market by focusing on the enabling regulatory framework. The issuance of sukuk rules \nwill  promote  Islamic  finance  and  increase  the  number  of  sukuk  issues.  The  introduction  of \nregulations  for  issuing  derivatives  will  encourage  the  development  of  instruments  such  as \ninterest rate swaps and currency swaps. \n \nEnhanced  demand  measures.  The  output  will  support  the  mobilization  of  capital \n19. \nmarket  financing  by  developing  liquid  bond  markets,  enhancing  institutional  investor  demand, \nand  promoting  mutual  funds.  A  strategy  of  creating  liquid  benchmark  issues  will  be  pursued \nthrough the introduction of floating rate notes in the government bond auction system on a pilot \nbasis and allowing for short selling of primary dealer-owned government securities that permit \npositions to be hedged, thereby generating secondary bond market activity. Insurance industry \nparticipation in the capital market will be enhanced by first introducing measures to promote the \nindustry\u2019s growth and stability, such as compliance with the minimum capital requirements of the \nInsurance  Act,  2010,  and  then  encouraging  investor  demand  through  issuing  investment \nguidelines  by  IDRA.  Approval  of  the  IDRA  organogram  will  significantly  enhance  IDRA\u2019s \nregulatory  capacity.  A  robust  mutual  fund  industry  will  be  promoted  by  rule  changes  that \n(i) ensure  a  level-playing  field  between  the  Investment  Corporation  of  Bangladesh  (ICB)  and \nnon-ICB funds by removing the exemption that allows ICB and its Asset Management Company \nto act as trustee of the new funds where ICB itself is the sponsor, (ii) allow investors in fixed-\nincome mutual funds the same tax treatment as equity mutual funds, and (iii) promote exchange \ntraded funds. \n \nD. \n \n20. \nThe program loan size is $250 million, which will be made available in two tranches: $80 \nmillion in tranche 1 and $170 million in tranche 2, to be released approximately 18 months after \nfirst  tranche  disbursement.  The  proposed  tranche  amounts  mirror  the  number  of  substantive \npolicy  actions  required  for  release  of  each  respective  tranche,  i.e.,  eight  policy  actions  for \ntranche 1 release and 18 policy actions for tranche 2 release. The first tranche will be available \nupon loan effectiveness.  \n \n21. \nADB\u2019s  financial  support  addresses  the  development  financing  needs.  In  particular,  the \ncounterpart fund generated out of the loan proceeds finances development expenditures in the \nform  of  cost  of  adjustment  under  the  proposed  reforms.  The  estimated  cost  of  adjustment \nacross program outputs is (i) $110 million for market stability (BSEC additional staff, operation \nand  maintenance  cost  of  BSEC  ICT  equipment,  establishment  of  a  clearing  and  settlement \ncompany,  and  intermediaries\u2019  recapitalization  costs);  (ii)  $20  million  for  market  facilitation  and \nsupply  measures  (costs  of  demutualization,  operationalization  of  capital  market  tribunal,  and \nestablishment  of  the  financial  reporting  council);  and  (iii)  $155  million  for  demand  measures \n(cost of paying market prices for government securities, IDRA additional staff and training, and \ninsurance recapitalization costs).17 \n \n22. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  finance  the  program.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n                                                 \n17 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f7 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and program agreements. Based \non this, the average loan maturity is 10.39 years and no maturity premium is payable to ADB. \nThe government has also requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR71,683,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 25-year \nterm,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  of  2%  per  annum  during  the  grace \nperiod  and  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and \nprogram agreements. \n \nE. \n \n23. \nThe executing agency will be the Bank and Financial Institutions Division (BFID) of the \nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF).  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  the  BSEC,  Bangladesh  Bank, \nand  IDRA.  The  program  will  be  supported  by  other  key  government  agencies  that  are \nresponsible for undertaking numerous policy actions. It is being implemented from January 2015 \nto December 2017. An interagency program steering committee, chaired by the BFID secretary, \nhelped  drive  the  reforms  in  preparation  of  the  first  tranche  policy  reform  measures.  The \nagencies  under  the  committee  include  the  MOF,  Bangladesh  Bank,  the  National  Board  of \nRevenue,  BSEC,  and  IDRA.  The  interagency  program  steering  committee  will  also  supervise \nimplementation  of  the  remaining  program.  The  committee  will  be  supported  by  a  secretariat \ncomposed of staff with the requisite technical skills. \n \n24. \nTranches,  disbursement,  and  counterpart  funds.  The  loans  will  be  provided  in  two \ntranches  and  will  be  disbursed  upon  fulfillment  of  the  respective  program  policy  actions \n(Appendix 4).  The  proceeds  of  the  loans  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nsimplification  of  disbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  policy-based  grants.18 \nThe proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  items  included  in  a  list  of  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources.19 ADB will have the right to audit the use of \nthe loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \nAttached  TA  for  Developing  the  Capital  Market  will  support  the  implementation  of  key \n25. \nreform  actions  under  the  program. 20  The  major  outputs  and  activities  of  the  TA  include \n(i) installation and operationalization of BSEC\u2019s new ICT system, (ii) draft rules for derivatives by \nBSEC,  (iii)  facilitation  of  the  establishment  of  a  clearing  and  settlement  company,  (iv)  draft \nregulations for the issuance of sukuks by BSEC, and (v) provision of training to IDRA additional \nstaff  that  will  be  mobilized  after  IDRA  organogram  approval.  Training  areas  will  include \nsupervisory  and  regulatory  mechanisms  to  oversee  insurance  companies,  monitoring  and \nevaluation  procedures,  ICT  management,  corporate  management  of  insurance  companies, \nidentification and management of governance issues, as well as the study of actuarial analysis. \nADB will provide $400,000 on a grant basis for the TA from its TASF-V and will administer an \nadditional  $300,000  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and \nKnowledge  Partnership  Fund  to  support  BSEC\u2019s  ICT  system.  The  TA  to  be  provided  by  ADB \nand  the  Republic  of  Korea  for  BSEC-related  activities  will  be  part  of  wider  capacity  and \ninstitutional  development  initiatives  being  contemplated  by  the  government,  which  includes \ninstallation  of  the  entire  BSEC  ICT  system  and  strengthening  of  the  Bangladesh  Institute  of \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB. 1998.

The  executing agency  for  the  TA  will  be \nthe  BFID  of  the  MOF.  The  BSEC  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  the  TA,  which  will  be \nimplemented  over  2.5 years,  starting  in  January  2016.  ADB  will  engage  consultants  through a \nconsulting firm in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office,  office \nsupplies, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n26. \nThe  program  will  facilitate  the  mobilization  of  financial  resources  for  productive \ninvestment  and  employment  generation  by  supporting  the  development  of  bond  and  equity \ncapital  markets.  It  will  help  ensure  balanced  development  of  the  finance  sector,  which  will \nreduce systemic vulnerabilities in the bank-dominated financial system. Specific benefits are as \nfollows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nBy  addressing  policy  and  regulatory  constraints  to  the  issues  of  corporate \nsecurities, the program will help increase the number of bond and equity issues, \nboth primary and secondary. This will facilitate the mobilization of scarce financial \nresources  for  long-term  private  sector  investment,  including  infrastructure \ninvestment. \nBy  promoting  the  development  of  corporate  securities  markets  and  institutional \ninvestors,  thereby  diversifying  financial  instruments  and  broadening  the  investor \nbase,  the  program  will  reduce  market  volatility  and  improve  the  resilience  of  the \nfinance sector to external shocks. \nBy  strengthening  market  governance  in  capital  markets,  the  program  will \nenhance market efficiency and transparency, and improve investor protection. \n\nGovernance \n\n \nB. \n \nPublic  financial  management  reform  has  been  undertaken  to  make  resource  allocation \n27. \nmore  effective,  prioritize  spending,  and  increase  budget  execution  capability.  The  government \nimplemented comprehensive governance reforms including the establishment of an independent \nAnti Corruption Commission in 2004; separation of the judiciary from the executive in 2007, which \nrendered  the  Supreme  Court  independent  and  brought  magistrates  exercising  judicial  functions \nunder  the  control  of  the  Supreme  Court;  enactment  of  the  Right  to  Information  Act,  2009  and \nimmediate establishment of the Information Commission; as well as the Whistleblower Protection \nAct, 2011. The government adopted a new approach to budget planning, with the introduction of \nthe medium-term budget framework in all line ministries, and the establishment of an integrated \nbudget and accounting system in 2009 that connected accounting offices in all districts and chief \naccounts  offices  of  the  line  ministries  with  the  MOF.  Under  the  Public  Money  and  Budget \nManagement  Act,  2009,  the  finance  minister  is  required  to  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to \nParliament  on  the  utilization  of  budgeted  appropriations  and  progress  in  public  expenditure \nmanagement. Furthermore, greater responsibility and accountability was assigned to BSEC under \nthe  second  program  through  clear  rules  of  engagement  under  the  amended  Securities  and \nExchange  Commission  Act,  1993,  which  contributed  to  improved  governance  in  the  financial \nsystem.  In  October  2012,  the  National  Integrity  Strategy  was  approved  by  the  government  and \nsupported by ADB\u2019s Good Governance Program, which represents a comprehensive institutional \n\n\f9 \n\napproach  to  fight  corruption.  21 ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the BFID of the MOF. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n \n28. \nThe capital market reforms under the program will play an important role in raising funds \ncost-effectively and in enabling investors to gain access to alternative investment opportunities, \nas well as mitigating the negative impact that financial market instability has on the plight of the \npoor. Diversification away from a predominantly bank-based system of financial intermediation \nexpands alternative sources of credit, helping to limit the systemic impacts of economic shocks. \nCapital markets can stimulate healthy competition with the banking sector that results in lower \nfinancing  costs  for  all  borrowers.  The  program,  therefore,  emphasizes  specific  capital  market \nreforms  to  help  Bangladesh  diversify  its  financial  system  so  that  the  country  can  realize  its \nbroad-based  economic  growth  and  socioeconomic  development  objectives,  including  poverty \nreduction. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nCapital market reforms supported by the program have been evaluated by the borrower \nand/or client and ADB. The evaluation shows that the reforms will have no anticipated direct or \nindirect environmental impacts, will not cause involuntary resettlement, and will have no impacts \non indigenous peoples. In this regard, the program is categorized C for environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n\nSafeguards \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nE. \n \n30. \nThe  program\u2019s  risk  assessment  is  rated  low  since  (i)  ADB  has  solid  experience  in  the \nsector  in  Bangladesh;  (ii)  the  BFID,  the  proposed  executing  agency,  has  a  good  performance \nrecord in externally financed project implementation; and (iii) the program is unlikely to have any \nimpact on safeguards. Major risks that could affect the program implementation and mitigating \nmeasures are summarized in the following table and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.22 \n \n\nSummary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n\nRisks \nResistance to reforms from vested interests \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe chairperson of the steering committee will have \nthe authority to enforce progress and ensure strong \ncommitment among stakeholders and strong \nownership of reforms through approval of the \nnational capital market master plan. \n\nThe technical assistance provided will facilitate the \nimplementation of second tranche actions by \ngovernment agencies. \n\nWeak implementation capacity of government \nagencies \n\nInadequate coordination among government \nagencies \n\nA program steering committee established for \nproper coordination. \n\n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2007.
