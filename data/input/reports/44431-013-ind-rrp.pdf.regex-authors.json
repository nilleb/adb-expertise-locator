I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Gujarat Solar Power Transmission Project.  \n \n2.  The project will develop the transmission infrastructure to evacuate power in a reliable \nmanner from solar power generation plants to be located in the Charanka solar park located in \nPatan district of Gujarat. The solar park will site over 500 megawatts (MW) of solar photovoltaic \nand concentrated solar power plants.1  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  India is bestowed with solar irradiation ranging from 4 to 7 kilowatt-hours (kWh)/square \nmeter/day across the country, with western and southern regions having higher solar incidence.2 \nWith rapid growing electricity demand, decreasing availability of land, and increasing reliance on \nimported sources of fossil fuel, India has initiated steps to develop the large potential for solar \nenergy-based  power  generation.  In  2010,  the  government  launched  the  Jawaharlal  Nehru \nNational Solar Mission (JNNSM) to facilitate extensive solar power development.3 Achieving the \nambitious  target  for  2022  of  20,000  MW  will  be  dependent  on  lessons  identified  during \nimplementation of the first two phases, which if successful could lead to conditions of grid-\ncompetitive solar power. The transition to mainstreaming solar energy could be appropriately \nscaled up through capacity development of all stakeholders related to issues of technology, \nfinance, project management, and policy development. JNNSM envisages setting up utility-\nscale solar power generation plants through the promotion and establishment of solar parks with \ndedicated  infrastructure  by  state  governments,  including  the  governments  of  Gujarat  and \nRajasthan.  \n \n4.  The Government of Gujarat (GOG), taking advantage of the favorable policy regime and \nhigh solar irradiation in the state, launched the Solar Power Policy in 2009 and proposed to \nestablish a number of large-scale solar parks starting with the Charanka solar park in Patan \ndistrict in the sparsely populated northern part of the state. The development of solar parks will \nstreamline  the  development  timeline  for  solar  power  generation  projects  with  government \nagencies undertaking land acquisition and obtaining necessary permits, as well as providing \ncommon infrastructure necessary to set up such power generation projects plants. Common \ninfrastructure for the solar park includes site preparation and leveling, construction power, \npower evacuation and water infrastructure, access roads, security, and related services.  This \napproach  will  facilitate  the  accelerated  installation  of  solar  power  generation  capacity, \nparticularly in the private sector and reduce costs by addressing the issues faced by stand-\nalone projects. The Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) has announced a feed-\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is for the project is in Appendix 1. \n2  In comparison, most of Europe receives 0.5 \u2013 4.0 kilowatt-hours/square meter/day  of solar energy. \n3  The major focus of JNNSM is to (i) create an enabling policy framework for deployment of 20,000 MW of solar \npower by 2022; (ii) increase capacity of grid-connected solar power generation to 1,000 MW within 3 years in the \nfirst phase, i.e., by 2013, and an additional 3,000 MW by 2017 in the second phase through the mandatory use of \nthe renewable purchase obligation by utilities backed with a preferential tariff; (iii) deploy 20 million solar lighting \nsystems for rural areas by 2022; and (iv) create favorable conditions to enhance solar manufacturing capability, \nparticularly solar thermal for indigenous production and market leadership. ", "2 \nin-tariff4 to mainstream solar power generation. Gujarat Power Corporation Limited (GPCL), the \nagency responsible for developing the 500 MW solar park, will lease the land to the project \ndevelopers to generate solar power. Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation (GETCO), with \nthe mandate to develop transmission infrastructure in Gujarat, is one of the executing agencies \nfor the project and will develop the transmission evacuation from the identified interconnection \npoints with the solar developer. The developer will fund the connection from the solar power \nplant to the interconnection point.  \n \n5.  In May 2010, ADB announced the Asia Solar Energy Initiative (ASEI) to catalyze the \ndevelopment of 3,000 MW of solar power generation projects from 2010 to 2013 in ADB \ndeveloping member countries. Under the ASEI, ADB is taking a holistic approach under the \nproject  to  catalyze  development  of  an  innovative  public\u2013private  partnership  model  of  a  \n500 MW solar park (17% of the ASEI target) through its public and private sector windows. \nADB, through technical assistance (TA) for the Integrated Renewable Energy Development \nProject, 5  supported  the  development  of  commercial  agreements  between  solar  power \ndevelopers and power purchasers under JNNSM. ADB also processed a guarantee facility6 for \ncommercial banks to lend to private sector solar developers. In India, transmission expansion, \nand optimization has been an area of focus for ADB operations7 and through the development \nof this power evacuation line from the Charanka solar park, ADB will be able to facilitate private \nsector participation and develop a model that can be replicated to scale up solar power in a \nsignificant manner in India. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome  \n6.  The project's impact will be large-scale development of reliable solar power projects in a \ncost-effective manner in India. The project outcome will be the development of reliable solar \npower transmission infrastructure for the successful operation of the solar park. \n \nC.  Outputs \n7.  The physical outputs will be the procurement, installation, and commissioning of (i) one \n400/220/66  kilovolt  (kV)  substation  comprising  of  two  315  megavolt  amperes  (MVA) \ntransformers and one 125 MVAR bus reactor, (ii) eight 100 MVA transformers at 220/66 kV \nvoltage level, (iii) a 66 kV underground cable grid of about 137 kilometers (km) within the solar \npark, (iv) about 110 km of 400 kV double circuit transmission line from the solar park to \nSankhari, Patan District, Gujarat, (v) about 109 km of 220 kV double circuit transmission line \nfrom the solar park to Jangral, Patan District, Gujarat and (vi) two feeder bays at the substations \nlocated at Sankhari and Jangral, Patan District, Gujarat. Nonphysical investment outputs include \nvocational training for skilled employment for up to 300 people with at least 30% women, and \nenergy-based livelihood enhancement training to 100 women.8  \n                                                 \n4  Rs15.00/kWh for the first 12 years and Rs5.00/kWh from year 13 to 25, to be applied for solar photovoltaic \noperation.

GOG will be the joint executing agency with GETCO, the power transmission utility \nlicensed to operate in Gujarat. GETCO will also act as the implementing agency for the project. \nGOG will constitute a steering committee, chaired by the principal secretary of Gujarat\u2019s Energy \nand Petrochemicals Department. The committee will meet every quarter to (i) promote and \nfacilitate overall coordination between GETCO and other agencies and stakeholders to ensure \nsmooth implementation of the project; and (ii) review the progress and achievements of the \nproject. GETCO will arrange monthly coordination meetings among developers in the solar park \nand other stakeholders. GETCO will be responsible for supervising project implementation and \nmonitoring the project\u2019s operating performance. It will establish a project management unit \nheaded by a project director and supported by a project manager and specialists in substation \nimplementation;  transmission  implementation;  engineering;  procurement  and  contract \nmanagement; finance and accounts; and environment, social safeguards, right-of-way, and \nsafety. \n \n12.  All procurement to be financed under the loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). ADB has approved \nadvance procurement action. GOG and GETCO have been advised that approval of advance \nprocurement  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  project.  The  transmission  lines,  the \nsubstation,  and  the  transmission  cables  within  the  solar  park  will  be  procured  following \ninternational competitive bidding procedures.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n13.  As per GOG\u2019s Solar Power Policy, 2009, GETCO has the responsibility to construct the \nevacuation facilities from the switchyards of developers\u2019 substations. The solar park has been \nproposed with a mix of photovoltaic (with a range of 5\u201325 MW) and concentrated solar power \n(with  a  range  of  25\u201350  MW)  totaling  500  MW.  Technical  studies  undertaken  by  GPCL \nconcluded the best option to evacuate power from the interconnection points of the generation \nprojects to the substation in the solar park would be through 66 kV underground cables. As the \ntotal output from the solar park will ultimately be 500 MW, GETCO proposes to construct a 220 \nkV transmission line from the substation in the solar park to the existing Jangral substation and \na 400 kV transmission line to the new Sankhari substation. Both transmission lines will be \ndouble circuit and the routing is been designed to maintain adequate system reliability. However, \nthe interconnection aspects between the solar power plants and the main electrical grid will \nneed  to  be  carefully  assessed.  The  ADB  TA\u2014Integrated  Renewable  Energy  Development \nProject\u2014is  undertaking  this  needs  assessment  (footnote  5).  In  addition,  a  TA11 has  been \napproved  for  a  detailed  system  study  and  a  joint  pilot  study  is  being  explored  with  the \nInternational Smart Grid Action Network. GETCO is to install special modular equipment in the \nADB-financed substation. In addition, ADB\u2019s Carbon Market Program would carry out studies to \nreview potential to secure carbon credits from clean power generation in the solar park.12 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n14.  Financial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (footnote  8).  All  financial  costs  and  benefits  are \nexpressed at constant 2010 prices. Financial viability was assessed by comparing the project\u2019s \nincremental costs and benefits. The calculation of incremental benefits is based on GETCO\u2019s \nrevenue  stream  and  currently  applicable  GERC  regulations.  Costs  used  to  determine  the \nfinancial internal rate of return include capital investments, operation and maintenance costs, \nand taxes incurred to install and operate the project.  \n \n15.  The financial internal rate of return is 8.8%, which compares favorably with the estimated \ncost of capital at 1.4%, indicating that the project will be financially viable. Sensitivity analyses \nshows that the results are robust to a range of project-related sensitivities covering a 10% \nincrease in capital cost, 10% increase in operation and maintenance costs, and a 1-year delay \nin project execution.13  \n \n16.  The economic analysis was undertaken using the systems approach, taking the solar \npark and transmission line together. Benefits considered include consumer benefits, prevented \nclimate change benefits, and prevented local air pollution benefits. The local air pollution costs \nwere incorporated using the benefit transfer method. The renewable energy certificate price for \nsolar was used as a proxy for the climate change benefits. Incremental costs and benefits were \nconsidered in estimating the economic internal rate of return of 13.4% in the base case. The \nsensitivity analysis shows that the project\u2019s rate of return is stable against changes in relevant \nparameters, i.e., 10% increase of costs, reduction in renewable energy certificate price and 1-\nyear delay of project implementation.   \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2011.

Governance \n17.  Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) are included in \nthe loan regulations and the bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the project will be subject to prior ADB approval and will \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe executing agencies and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers \nas they relate to the project. GOG will ensure that GETCO and other associated power entities \nhave operating autonomy and no organizational changes are carried out that would affect their \nability to perform their obligations under the project. In addition, financial management and \nprocurement capacity assessments were completed. GETCO will maintain separate accounts \nfor the project and its operations. Table 4 summarizes the specific governance measures.   \n \nTable 4: Governance Measures \n \nArea  Measures \nProcurement  (i)  A project management unit is in place, headed by a project director reporting \ndirectly to the managing director of GETCO. \n(ii)  Bid specifications and packaging were prepared to ensure maximum competition \nunder international competitive bidding procedures. \n(iii) Information on procurement will be disclosed on the GETCO and ADB websites. \n(iv) Procurement capacity support will be available at the India Resident Mission to \nexpedite action on procurement issues. \nFinancial management   (i)  Expenditures, other financial transactions, and safe custody of project-financed \nand audit  assets will be monitored by the accounting and control systems of GETCO. \n (ii) The internal audit reports will be provided to the audit committee of the GETCO \nboard. \n (iii) Financial statements will be audited by auditors acceptable to ADB and regularly \npublished and reported to shareholders. \nInstitutional and  (i)  A steering committee chaired by principal secretary, energy and petrochemical \ncorporate governance  department has been setup to facilitate and promote overall coordination \n(ii)  A  coordination  mechanism  has  been  established  among  relevant  agencies \nincluding GPCL. \n(iii) GETCO will regularly file tariff petitions with the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory \nCommission. \n(iv) The solar policy and regulatory framework to support the development of solar \npower in Gujarat has been setup.  \nAnticorruption  ADB will review and examine any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices relating to the project. \nGrievance review  A grievance redress mechanism will be established to address issues relating to \nproject implementation. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GETCO = Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation, MW = megawatt. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n ", "7 \n18.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  GETCO.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender  \n19.  In Gujarat, industry and services sectors constitute over 80% of the state\u2019s net domestic \nproduct and have maintained high growth rates of over 10% in recent years resulting in a \nsignificant growth in electricity demand. The power subsector plays a key role to economic \ndevelopment and social well-being. The project is consistent with the poverty reduction strategy \nunder India\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India. While \nGujarat enjoys high household electrification (more than 95%) and diversified industrial activity \nmaking it one of the richest states in India, areas adjacent to the project are prone to poor basic \ninfrastructure, primarily sanitation and water supply systems; and economic activity and growth \ndue to a lack of income-generating opportunities and wider access to markets. A socioeconomic \nand poverty assessment was carried out in communities along the transmission lines and in the \nvicinity of the proposed solar park. Overall, villages are characterized by their remoteness, \nsubsistence-based  economies,  and  often  by  inhospitable  living  conditions  due  to  extreme \nweather conditions and generalized scarcity of water. Host communities are primarily rural, \nagriculture-based (irrigated and non-irrigated) with relatively high incidence of poverty (less than \n$1  per  day),  illiteracy,  and  poor  standards  of  living  and  well-being  (as  noted  in  the \nsocioeconomic analysis14). A gender action plan was prepared for the project.15 The loan \nagreement includes a confirmation from the executing agency to implement the gender action \nplan as designed.   \n \n20.  To alleviate some of the challenges and constraints that perpetrate poverty and social \nexclusion in the area, the project incorporates a selected number of value added interventions \ndesigned to enhance and meet a range of varied basic but specific needs across targeted \npopulations in the project area. Interventions combine project-specific outcomes (e.g., local \njobs) with associated outputs conceived specifically to complement and support the loan. All \ninterventions  are  gender  inclusive  and  aim  to  promote  gender  equality  through  the \nempowerment of women in decision-making roles and by enabling them to actively participate in \nemployment, skills training (education), and energy-based alternative livelihoods.  \n \n21.  Pro-poor, socially inclusive, and gender equitable and enhancing activities associated \nwith the project include (i) the generation of a significant number of local jobs requiring different \nskill sets;16 they will have a direct socioeconomic impact on host communities and contribute to \nimproved livelihoods; (ii) provision of skilled vocational training to local people (30% women) to \nfill the labor demands created from the development of the solar park and transmission project; \n(iii) provision of livelihood energy-based skills training for up to 100 poor women in target areas \nin the project area of influence; (iv) as part of GETCO\u2019s corporate social responsibility, the \nexecuting agency will invest for the provision of basic infrastructure improvements in Charanka \nvillage, where sanitation, water supply systems, and street lighting have been identified to be of \nparticular  need.  The  partnership  will  support  and  enhance  the  outputs  of  the  ADB  loan, \nparticularly by improving the quality of life of villagers who will also benefit from local jobs, and \nvocational and livelihood skills training. Though not financed by the loan, the results will be \nmonitored and reported in the project performance monitoring system.

The TA will offer vocational training and \nlivelihood enhancement opportunities in Patan district with the objective of generating (i) a \nqualified labor force to meet the employment demands of the proposed solar park development \nprojects, and (ii) empower the roles and increase the incomes of poor local women. The TA will \nhave a gender focus and enhance the project by qualifying it for effective gender mainstreaming \nstatus. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy prepared for the project notes that the \nproject will contribute to poverty reduction locally and in the region through (i) the creation of \ntemporary and permanent jobs; (ii) public and private sector economic investment and growth; \n(iii) improvements to local basic infrastructure, including roads, sanitation, and water supplies; \n(iv) provision of skilled and unskilled employment; (v) capacity development training; and (vi) \ngender mainstreaming interventions.17  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n22.  The assessment of potential environmental impacts of the transmission indicates the \nproject is to be classified as category B for environment, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009).  A  draft  initial  environmental  examination  for  the  transmission \nsubprojects was prepared.18 Draft environmental management plans (EMPs) were prepared and \ninformal public consultations carried out along the transmission corridor. The results indicate \nbroad support for the project based on perceived economic and social benefits. Most impacts \nare expected to occur during construction and are deemed as temporary and reversible in \nnature.  The  transmission  corridor  was  carefully  selected  after  undergoing  an  options \nassessment. This enabled the right-of-way alignment to bypass nearby sensitive ecological \nareas, villages, and important water supplies and resources. The main environmental impacts of \nthe project will be the clearing of shrub vegetation, waste management, and excavation and \nmovement of soil. From this perspective, the project is expected to have a small environmental \nfootprint. No endangered or protected species of flora or fauna are reported at any of the \nsubproject sites. The substation sites are located on land owned by GOG, characterized as \nmostly barren, uninhabited, and unused lands, removed from populated areas. An EMP with \nspecific management, mitigation, and monitoring activities and measures was prepared for the \nproject. Adverse impacts will be mitigated using appropriate design and management measures \nand through the provision of fair compensation for the loss of physical and/or productive assets. \nMitigation measures related to construction, as specified in the EMP, will be incorporated into \ncivil  works contracts,  the  implementation  of which  will be  the  primary  responsibility  of  the \ncontractors. GETCO will, however, be responsible for overseeing overall implementation and \nauditing of the site-specific EMP. The National Environment Engineering Research Institute \nprepared a rapid environmental impact assessment, as per GOG norms.19  \n \n23.  The  project  is  classified  as  a  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  per  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The transmission component will not require land acquisition. The \nland identified for the three substations (Charanka, Jangral, and Sankhari) is government-\nowned wasteland, hence no permanent land acquisition or displacement will be required for \nthese facilities. A resettlement plan was prepared for the project with specific provisions and \nentitlements for compensating affected people, although presently only minimal and temporary \n                                                 \n17 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Development of the solar park will follow the EMP requirements of the environmental impact assessment, per local \ngovernment environmental laws and regulations acceptable to ADB. ADB assessed the documents and recognized \nthat the proposed action is relevant for additional provisions for development of buffer zones to eliminate any \nimpact on the wild ass in the wildlife sanctuary located in the northern end of the park (10 km from the project \nboundary). \n ", "9 \nimpacts, such as temporary loss of crops and/or trees, are expected. According to site surveys, \nno households headed by women or vulnerable groups such as scheduled tribes will be directly \naffected by the project. GETCO will review and update the RP based on the finalized detailed \ndesign of the transmission lines and in case of any impact on land and structures, the same \nwould be included in the updated RP. In the event of unforeseen adverse impacts on these, \nassistance will be taken up on a case-by-case basis per the entitlements, eligibility criteria, and \ncompensation identified in the project resettlement plan. Gender considerations, specifically \ngender equitable consultation, compensation, and the impact on households headed by women, \nare also considered in the resettlement plan. The plan complies with national laws and ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. GPCL is preparing a separate resettlement plan for the solar park \ncomponent; it is consistent with ADB requirements. No indigenous peoples are expected to be \naffected. This is reflected in the category C classification for indigenous peoples. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n24.  The two major risks are (i) possible uncoordinated development of the solar power \ngeneration plants and the associated transmission system; and (ii) possible instability of the grid \nin terms of frequency, current, and voltage due to large-scale solar generation at a single point. \nThe government will establish a steering committee with senior representatives from GOG, \nGPCL,  and  GETCO;  and  representatives  of  the  project  developers 20 to  review  project \nimplementation and ensure coordinated development of the park, the power plants, and power \nevacuation system. A coordination committee mechanism will also be set up. Under the ASEI, \nADB  has  been  actively  facilitating  private  sector  participation  in  the  solar  park  taking  a \nsystematic approach.21 Recognizing comparative advantages to locate solar power generation \nplants  in  the  solar  park  rather  than  outside,  project  developers  have  entered  into  leasing \nagreements and power purchase agreements for over 200 MW, 40% of the total expected \ninstalled capacity of the solar park while several developers are in final stages of entering into \nsuch contracts. The first unit may be commissioned before completion of the transmission line. \nIn such a case, GETCO will be prepared to provide an evacuation solution using the temporary \nline for construction power to the solar park. Further, possible instability of the grid due to \ninconsistent voltage and frequency needs to be examined in detail and ways identified to ensure \nuninterrupted grid management. GETCO recognizes the need to install specialized equipment \nbetween the solar power plants and the main electrical grid. A TA has been approved is being \nprepared for detailed system study and a joint pilot study is being explored with the International \nSmart Grid Action Network (para. 13). \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPossible uncoordinated development of the solar  A steering committee to be established comprising \npower generation plants and the transmission  representatives of GOG, GPCL, GETCO, and other \nsystem  stakeholders to ensure that the transmission facility \nis developed. \n \nA coordination committee comprising \nrepresentatives from GETCO and solar plant \n                                                 \n20 In view of the substantial investments made, GOG is committed to solar power development in the state. Penalty \nclauses in the power purchase agreements will require developers to adhere to the agreed schedule. \n21 Workshops were jointly held by ADB and GOG in December 2010 in Tokyo, Japan at the second meeting of the \nAsia Solar Energy Forum and in January 2011 in Gujarat, India inviting financiers and, technology providers to \ndiscuss financial, technology, and capacity development aspects. \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \ndevelopers to meet regularly to manage \nimplementation coordination. \n \nPPA and land lease agreements already signed for \nover 200 MW and other applications being \nprocessed.  \n \nThe Asia Solar Energy Forum facilitates \ncommunication between government agencies and \nsolar power park developers. \nPossible instability of the grid in terms of frequency,  GETCO is to conduct technical studies with ADB \ncurrent, and voltage due to large-scale solar  support. \ngeneration at a single point    \nInternational best practices through the \nInternational Smart Grid Action Network.  \n \nGETCO (with ADB TA) is to undertake suitable \ncountermeasures and/or technical solutions as \nidentified under the ADB-funded TA. These are to \nbe in place well in advance of commissioning of the \ntransmission system with possible development \npartner support. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GETCO = Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation, GOG = Government of \nGujarat, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n25.  The Government of India, GOG and GETCO have assured ADB that implementation of \nthe project will conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents.  \n \n26.  The  Government  of  India,  GOG  and  GETCO  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \nEffectiveness  of  the  loan  agreement  is  conditional  upon  the  execution  and  delivery  of  a \nsubsidiary loan agreement, between GOG and GETCO, satisfactory to ADB, under which the \nloan proceeds are to be onlent from GOG to GETCO.  \n \nV.
