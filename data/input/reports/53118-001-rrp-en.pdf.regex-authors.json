I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nGeorgia for the Livable Cities Investment Project for Balanced Development (LCIP).  \n \n2.  The sector loan project for a total loan amount of \u20ac101 million will improve livability and \ninclusive  economic  growth  in  Georgia  including  the  seven  lagging  regions\u2014Kvemo  Kartli, \nSamegrelo-Zemo Svaneti, Kakheti, Samtskhe-Javakheti, Shida Kartli, Imereti, and Guria\u2014and \nthe capital city Tbilisi.1 The project will improve the quality of life of at least 1.5 million people (of \nwhich 52% are women) across Georgia through integrated urban solutions for inclusive and \nclimate-resilient  urban  infrastructure  and  services;  improved  accessibility,  connectivity,  and \neconomic competitiveness; and enhanced institutional capacity. The project will upgrade urban \ncenters and other settlements, public spaces, and parks; restore cultural heritage buildings and \nnatural  heritage  sites;  upgrade  roads;  and  construct  community  infrastructure  such  as \nkindergartens, libraries, e-learning centers, and sports and tourism facilities. Universal design and \naccessibility standards and gender-responsive design will be applied for all project components.2 \n  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Country context. Georgia is located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, rich in natural \nresources and cultural heritage. Despite these comparative advantages, the country needs to \novercome substantial infrastructure, urban services, and capacity gaps to unlock its economic \ngrowth potential. Although Georgia is an upper middle-income country, 20.1% of the population \nstill lives below the poverty line.3 Economic growth has been unevenly distributed between Tbilisi \nand the regions. Georgia has a population of 3.7 million people (of which 1.9 million are women), \nwith about 59% living in urban areas. More than 30% of the population lives in Tbilisi, which \naccounted for 52% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. The total population \nof Georgia has been declining steadily\u2014from 4.12 million in 2000 to 3.72 million in 2020.4 The \npopulation  in  Tbilisi  increased  from  1,100,000  to  1,184,800  from  2010  to  2020,  while  the \npopulations declined during the same period in the regions\u2014from 369,800 to 310,000 in Kakheti, \nand from 413,200 to 311,100 in Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti. The reverse demographic highlights \nissues such as out-migration, limited job opportunities, and poor quality of life in the regions.5 \n \n4.  Economic outlook. The government has implemented progressive structural reforms \nsince 2014 to support international economic integration; as a result, Georgia averaged 4% \nannual GDP growth during 2015\u20132019.6 The service industry represents more than 65% of GDP \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: Georgia, 2020\u20132022. Manila. The sector \nproject consolidates two proposed projects in the previous country operations business plan: (i) Livable Cities \nInvestment Project for Balanced Regional Development and (ii) Livable Cities Investment Project for Tbilisi. In July \n2020, the government asked ADB to process the two projects together. The project was prepared under ADB. 2019. \nTechnical Assistance to Georgia for Preparing Integrated Solutions for Livable Cities. Manila (amount: $2,600,000). \n2  ADB. 2021.

Manila (guidelines prepared in 2017\u20132020).  \n3  ADB. Poverty Data: Georgia (accessed 6 July 2020). Georgia ranked 70th out of 189 countries and territories in the \nHuman Development Index and ranked 75th in the Gini Index, which measures income inequality, in 2019. \n4  National Statistics Office of Georgia. Population (accessed 28 May 2020 and 26 June 2020). \n5  State Commission on Migration Issues. 2015. 2015 Migration Profile of Georgia. Tbilisi. \n6  National Statistics Office of Georgia. GDP Real Growth Rate (accessed 30 May 2020). Georgia signed an \nAssociation Agreement with the European Union in 2014, and implemented anticorruption strategies as well as public \nadministration and tax reforms, liberalized trade policies, and streamlined business regulations. \n   ", "2 \nand employs half of Georgia's workforce.7 Most employed women are in the service industry. The \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the resulting halt in international tourism and \nslowdown in domestic consumer spending are having severe impacts on the Georgian economy. \nThe fiscal deficit widened as COVID-19 relief and mitigation spending placed pressure on the \nstate budget. Current account deficit is expected to narrow from 9% of GDP in 2021 to 6.5% of \nGDP in 2022 as growth is projected to return to 8.5%\u20136.5% in 2021\u20132022 with the revival of \ndomestic consumer spending and as the global recovery boosts tourism.8 The International \nMonetary Fund assessed Georgia\u2019s public debt sustainability as stable over the medium term.9 \n \n5.  Untapped economic potential. Tourism is a fast-growing industry and a key driver of \nGeorgia\u2019s economic growth, accounting for 26.3% of GDP in 2019.10 Tourism accounted for \n27.7% of total employment in 2019 in Georgia, the highest in the Central and West Asia region. \nInternational visitors increased by 345% from 2010 to 2019, to 7.7 million, with international \ntourism receipts directly contributing $3.2 billion in 2019.11 Most trips (76.3% or 5.5 million) were \nfrom neighboring countries, while only 23.7% (1.7 million) were from other parts of the world. \nDespite a high number of visitors prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, associated tourism revenues \nhave lagged. Low visitor spending is a result of a shortage of high-quality tourism experiences \nand skills deficiencies to manage and market tourism assets (footnote 10). The Georgia National \nTourism Strategy, 2015\u20132025 aims to create unique, high-quality visitor experiences based on \nthe country\u2019s inherent natural and cultural assets.12 Despite promising prospects for tourism, basic \nurban services and associated tourism infrastructure remain outdated. Climate change impacts \nsuch as increased frequency of heat waves and floods put additional pressure on urban services \nand livability. Older persons and persons with disabilities (PWDs) also require accessible tourist \nsites and facilities. Integrated investments in urban services and tourism infrastructure will help \nimprove livability for citizens and create jobs. The project will meet increasing demand for quality \ntourism in Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) countries as the project cities \nare strategically located along CAREC corridors 2a, 2b, and 2c and the CAREC designated rail \ncorridors, and will help unlock Georgia's economic potential through corridor development.13 \n \n6.  Sector strategy and plan. The Regional Development Program (RDP) 2018\u20132021, which \nis aligned with the Social-economic Development Strategy of Georgia (Georgia 2020), identifies \nthe  priority  development  needs  of  the  urban  development  sector  as  (i) balanced  regional \ndevelopment  through  provision  of  key  infrastructure;  and  (ii) local  economic  development, \naccessible tourism, cultural and historical heritage conservation, and development of micro, small, \nand medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).14 The government's Renovated Regions Program, \nlaunched on 26 April 2021 targets 63 municipalities for rehabilitation of cultural and heritage sites, \nmunicipality centers, parks, and public facilities, and creation of green and recreational spaces \nand tourist infrastructure.15 Set to employ about 15,000 citizens, the initiative is projected to cost \nGEL500 million in its first phase. The project will support the implementation of this program. \n \n7  ADB. Data Library (accessed 28 April 2020). \n8  ADB. 2021. Asian Development Outlook Update: Transforming Agriculture in Asia.

In 2019, Tbilisi City Municipality (TCM) endorsed the Local Economy Development Plan \nand the Land Use Master Plan, which set out the city\u2019s vision to create a more livable, green, and \ninclusive city, ensuring affordable and safe mobility, and equal access for all, through provision of \nrecreational public spaces and parks; redevelopment of neighborhoods; improved public transport \nand sports facilities; and opportunities for the elderly, children, youth, and PWDs to participate in \nactive  city  life,  especially  post\u2013COVID-19.16  The  government  aims  to  build  on  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)-funded projects including the Sustainable Urban Transport Strategy, \ncompleted in 2015, under the multitranche financing facility for the Sustainable Urban Transport \nInvestment Program (SUTIP) to improve mobility.17 A sustainable urban mobility plan (SUMP) \nfollowing on from the strategy is being finalized under the ongoing project readiness financing \n(PRF) for the Livable Cities Investment Program.18 The SUMP outlines the city's long-term \ninvestment plan for integrated urban development and public transport to be implemented under \nthe LCIP. The Green City Action Plan, developed in 2017 focuses on improving urban services, \nclimate resilience, mobility, and energy efficiency measures.19  \n \n8.  Alignment with country priorities. The government reoriented urban sector operations \nin November 2016 under ADB's Livable Urban Areas technical assistance (TA) project.20 The TA \nexpanded  ADB\u2019s  \"3E\"  approach  (economy,  environment,  and  equity)  to  \"5E\"  livable  cities \napproach (including enablers and engagement). ADB\u2019s 5E approach puts people at the center of \nurban development to make cities competitive, environmentally resilient, and inclusive.21 The \nLivable Urban Areas TA project prepared 10-year integrated urban action plans (IUAPs) through \nvisioning to identify priority subprojects for the tourism clusters.22 The LCIP complements the \nregional tourism work under the CAREC Tourism Strategy 2030 (footnote 13). The LCIP is aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s strategic objectives as described in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Georgia, \n2019\u22122023, and as aligned with all seven operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.23 \n \n9.  The deterioration of sport facilities and swimming pools built during Soviet times has led \nto a decline of a once rich sports culture. During consultations, citizens highlighted a need for \nimproved  social  infrastructure,  including  kindergartens  (for  children  aged  2\u20135  years),  and \neducational facilities, community facilities such as sports complexes, and recreational areas \n(footnote 20). Such facilities can boost healthy lifestyles and improve youth focus. Deteriorating \nkindergartens pose a high health and safety risk for children. Given the limited number of \nkindergartens, parents face long travel times to drop off and pick up their children. Mothers face \nlimited work options because of caregiving responsibilities. Provision of community facilities will \nimprove daily living conditions, create employment opportunities, and reduce out-migration. \n \n \n16  Tbilisi City Municipality. 2019.

Sector loan modality. The project meets the criteria for a sector loan because:  \n(i)  The government has a clear urban and regional development sector plan. The \nRDP 2018\u20132021 and the Renovated Regions Program together with the IUAPs \nprovide targets, benchmarking, and an investment plan for the regions, while the \nLand Use Master Plan, the SUMP, and the Green City Action Plan provide a clear \ninvestment plan for Tbilisi.24  \n(ii)  Institutional capacity is sufficient to implement the sector development plan. The \nexecuting agencies\u2014the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure of \nGeorgia  (MRDI)  and  TCM\u2014have  experience  in  planning  and  implementing \nprojects and reforms. The Municipal Development Fund of Georgia (MDF), as one \nof the implementing agencies, has experience implementing ADB projects and is \nresponsible for implementing 75% of the project. The other implementing agency, \nTbilisi Development Fund (TDF), has less experience, so the project will provide \nsupport to strengthen the institutional capacity of TDF (para. 29).  \n(iii)  Supporting urban sector policies are in place and will be further strengthened \nthrough the project. MRDI made good progress toward achieving RDP objectives \nduring  2018\u20132019.  However,  the  plan  has  faced  considerable  budgetary \nchallenges since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. The sector loan modality \nenables an integrated focus on urban sector policies and development.  \n(iv)  The modality is also suitable given the large number of subprojects to be financed. \nDetailed subproject selection criteria are included in the project administration \nmanual (PAM) to ensure that subprojects are identified, designed, prioritized, and \napproved according to clear and consistent specifications.25 These include criteria \nsuch as strategic justification and rationale aligned with the project outcome, local \ndemand, economic and financial viability, and safeguards categorization. \n \n11.  Institutional  context.  MRDI  coordinates  the  work  of  ministries,  national  agencies, \nregional institutions, and municipalities involved in regional development. MDF, established in \n1997  under  MRDI,  is  tasked  with  enhancing  the  institutional  and  financial  capacity  of \nmunicipalities, investing in infrastructure and services, and improving socioeconomic conditions \nfor the population. Municipalities in the regions have weak capacity to plan and implement \ninfrastructure, and are weak in budgeting, e-procurement, and conducting state tenders and bid \nevaluations. Municipal revenues are generally sufficient to cover operation and maintenance \n(O&M) costs, and rely on financial transfers from the national budget for capital investments. \nMRDI has initiated decentralization through a strategy and action plan (2020\u20132025).26 \n \n12.  Lessons. The government reform agenda for livable cities is consistent with ADB\u2019s \nongoing projects and engagement in the country. The project builds on the following lessons from \npast  ADB-funded  projects:  (i)  enhanced  project  readiness  reduces  implementation  delays; \n(ii) compliance with social and environmental safeguards, including a robust grievance redress \nmechanism (GRM) and effective communication with affected persons, is essential; and (iii) a \nhigh level of ownership and commitment to action crucial to avoid changing investment priorities \nand delayed decision-making.27 A remedial action plan is being implemented with regards to \nSUTIP Tranche 3 (footnote 17).

The pandemic\u2019s economic impact has been severe, \nespecially for households, small businesses, and the tourism industry. The project is a timely \nresponse  to  stimulate  the  local  economy  in  the  regions  and  adopt  vital  health-related \nprecautionary measures. Provision of tourism and community infrastructure in regional clusters \nacross the country can support balanced growth and provide economic stimulus, as Georgia is \nwell  positioned  to  emerge  as  a  global  tourist  destination  post\u2013COVID-19.28  The  project \ncomplements ADB's Sustainable Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Development Program as \nwell as ADB\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine Support Project under the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility \nfor mitigating the impact of COVID-19.29 \n \n14.  Development coordination. ADB is uniquely positioned to support livable cities as the \nlargest development partner in the urban development sector in terms of lending volumes, and \nhaving the longest engagement with MRDI. Other development partners that support urban and \nregional development include Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, the World Bank, Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), and the European Investment Bank.30 \nMRDI and TCM coordinate with development partners to avoid duplication of efforts.  \n \nB.  Project Description \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: Sustainable economic growth, improved \nlivability, and balanced development promoted in Georgia.31 The project will have the following \noutcome: Livability and inclusive economic activity in Georgia improved.32 The project will improve \nlivability, accessibility, mobility, and the quality of public spaces with the application of the \ninclusive cities guidelines\u2014Georgia's first-ever gender-responsive and accessibility standards, \ndeveloped by ADB and adopted by the government to adapt the built environment for older \npersons, PWDs, women, and children (footnote 2).  \n \n16.  Output  1:  Inclusive  and  climate-resilient  urban  infrastructure rehabilitated  and \nconstructed, and services improved. The output, which will cover all of Georgia, will target \nupgrading of urban centers, other settlements and neighborhoods, improvement of public spaces \nand parks, pedestrian paths, roads, and stormwater drainage; rehabilitation of the Mtkvari River \nin Tbilisi; and construction of community buildings such as libraries, kindergartens, and sports \ncomplexes.

Value Added by ADB \n19.  ADB value addition and innovation. This is a flagship project for livable cities under \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, with several innovative features that add value. The project is piloting \nparticipatory  and  integrated  urban  planning,  with  strong  citizen  ownership.  It  will  leverage \ninvestments to stimulate economic activity and livelihood opportunities, and create direct co-\nbenefits by supporting MSME development. The project will initiate innovative urban management \npartnerships for urban planning and governance. The project promotes climate adaptation and \nnature-based solutions, enhancing cultural and natural heritage assets, and regional tourism \n(footnote 4). All subprojects will apply the first-of-its-kind in Asia and the Pacific, inclusive cities \nguidelines for accessibility audits, universal design standards, and gender-responsive design. \nThese guidelines were applied for an accessibility audit in the first nonsovereign housing project \nin the South Caucasus region\u2014M Square Affordable Housing Project, which will partially finance \nan  affordable  housing  development  for  3,700  households\u2014showcasing  strong  market \ndemonstration by the private sector and resulting in the One ADB collaboration with LCIP.35  \n \nD.

ADB will finance 100% of both mitigation and adaptation costs. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n24.  MRDI and TCM are the executing agencies responsible for overall guidance, strategic \ndecisions, and oversight of project implementation; MRDI is responsible for subprojects across \nGeorgia covering all regions, and TCM is responsible for subprojects in Tbilisi City. MDF is the \nimplementing  agency  under  MRDI.  MRDI  will  coordinate  with  other  national  agencies  and \norganizations as required for regional transport and business development facility. TDF is the \nimplementing agency under TCM and will coordinate with other departments under TCM and \nagencies such as Tbilisi Transport Company for smooth implementation of Tbilisi City subprojects. \nProject management units (PMUs) were established within MDF and TDF under the ongoing PRF \nfor the Livable Cities Investment Program, and are supported by project management consultants \n(footnote 18). Procurement of consultants, civil works, and goods will be carried out following the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n   ", "8 \n25.

Technical \n26.  The sector loan modality requires an appraisal of a sample of subprojects of a certain type \n   ", "9 \nto inform selection of future subprojects.36 ADB conducted technical due diligence of selected \nsubprojects across Telavi, Velistsikhe in Gurjaani, Sighnaghi, Lagodekhi (in Kakheti); Mestia, \nZugdidi, Martvili, Senaki, Poti (Samagrelo-Zemo Svaneti); Rustavi (Kvemo Kartli); Akhaltsikhe \n(Samtskhe\u2013Javakheti); Kutaisi (Imereti); and Lanchkhuti (Guria). Regional subprojects comprised \nsmall (75 students), medium (90 students), and large (180 students) kindergartens across the \ncountry; one swimming pool in Kutaisi; sports complexes in Zugdidi, Akhaltsikhe, and Rustavi; \nthe historic center of Velistsikhe; a touristic route for Telavi; an e-learning center and library in \nZugdidi; and renovating cultural heritage structures in Ushguli, and Laghami near Mestia. All \nsubprojects underwent reviews of detailed engineering designs, specifications, bill of quantities, \nand cost estimates to ensure compliance with national and international standards. Design \nrevisions included energy efficiency, disabled access, and gender inclusivity. The Digmis Chalebi \nPark design was revised to include a nature-based solution for riverbank stabilization.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n27.  Economic analysis. The economic analysis was completed for several representative \nsubprojects  including  a  selected  sample  of  kindergarten  (Kutaisi)  and  community  facilities \n(Zugdidi and Kutaisi), and the heritage tourism\u2013oriented upgrades in Mestia and Velistsikhe, in \naccordance with the ADB Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and the approach of \nother ADB-financed projects.37 The economic analysis suggests that all subprojects have positive \nnet present values, with economic internal rates of return ranging from 11.7% to 18.8%, which \nexceed the ADB threshold value of 9% economic opportunity cost of capital. Sensitivity analysis \nof identified risks (increase in construction costs, increase in recurrent costs, and lower-than-\nexpected economic benefits) show that subprojects are generally robust to potential adverse \nscenarios, with economic internal rates of return surpassing the 9% threshold in all cases. \n \n28.  Financial analysis. The financial analysis was completed for two revenue-generating \nsubprojects,  and  for  all  subproject  municipalities  to  assess  their  financial  sustainability. \nA sensitivity analysis was performed on the two revenue-earning subprojects\u2014the swimming pool \nin Kutaisi and the sports facilities in Zugdidi; the financial internal rate of return ranged from 7.8% \nto 9.4%\u2014above the weighted average cost of capital of 1.93%\u2014in all sensitivity tests. A financial \nsustainability assessment of six of the 14 municipalities, including Tbilisi, indicated a substantial \nrisk for securing adequate budget for subproject O&M. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n29.  Institutional assessment. The success of sector lending depends on the investment \nplanning capacity of executing and implementing agencies and their ability to coordinate and \nimplement projects and carry out O&M. MRDI and MDF have been involved with ADB-funded \nprojects since 2008. MRDI needs to improve its internal auditing practices. MDF PMU staff have \nextensive experience with ADB project implementation and were involved in project preparation, \nbut  will  require  support  to  ensure  safeguards  compliance.  The  project  team  will  provide \ninstitutional strengthening support to municipalities in budgeting and financial management to \nensure sustainable O&M of the assets. TCM (the second executing agency) and TDF (the second \nimplementing agency) have no experience with ADB-funded projects and limited experience with \nother international financial institutions. A PMU has been established under TDF to manage \nimplementation of international financial institution\u2013funded projects. Institutional strengthening \nconsultant support will be provided. TCM, through its Environmental Protection Department, \n \n36 About $40 million of the loan amount is not fully scoped. Indicative subprojects are being preparation under the PRF. \n37 ADB. 2017.

The financial management assessment rated the project pre-\nmitigation risk substantial because of identified financial management risks associated with both \nTCM and TDF. Proposed risk mitigation measures include (i) training TCM and TDF staff in ADB \nmonitoring, financial reporting, and disbursement procedures; (ii) on-the-job training of TDF PMU \nstaff by the financial management consultant; (iii) annual monitoring of executing agencies\u2019 and \nimplementing agencies\u2019 financial statements; (iv) liquidating the advance account quarterly and \ndepositing funds in the Treasury Department; (v) quarterly provision by TDF of advance account \nreconciliation  statements  and  interim  semi-annual  project  financial  statements  to  ADB; \n(vi) strengthening internal audit processes at TCM and performance of an independent annual \nproject audit by an audit firm acceptable to ADB; and (vii) implementing a backup plan and system \nfor accounting data. \n \n31.  Procurement.  Strategic  procurement  planning  included  a  project  procurement  risk \nassessment. The overall procurement risk for the project is medium. ADB assessed MDF's \nprocurement risk as low. TDF is not familiar with ADB procurement policies, and its capacity to \nhandle contract management issues has gaps. Thus, TDF\u2019s procurement risk was assessed as \nmedium. COVID-19-related supply constraints affect market conditions and may make it more \ndifficult to attract international bidders. Identified procurement risks will be mitigated through \nengagement of external procurement experts. Procurement readiness for the project is high, with \n58% of the civil works packages advertised and 15 contracts with total contract amount of $18.58 \nmillion (11% of ADB financing) awarded under advance contracting. \n \n32.  Anticorruption. The 2009 Law of Georgia on the Conflict of Interests and Corruption in \nPublic Service outlines the anticorruption regulatory framework. Georgia ranked 41st (out of 180 \ncountries) in the 2018 corruption perception index of Transparency International, suggesting that \nthere is scope for improving governance.38 Integrity due diligence was conducted on MDF and \nTDF, including on the members of their supervisory boards and management teams.39 They do \nnot appear to constitute a significant or potentially significant integrity risk. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n33.  The project will improve quality of life in Georgia and will stimulate local economic \ndevelopment. The project will (i) create jobs and business opportunities in tourism for local people, \nensuring social protection and improving livelihoods; (ii) increase citizens participation in urban \nplanning; (iii) promote universal design and accessible infrastructure; and (iv) develop social \ninfrastructure and community facilities for all ages like parks, and sports facilities to incentivize a \nhealthy lifestyle for citizens and build immunity to combat the spread of COVID-19. \n \n34.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming and a gender action plan has \nbeen prepared.

Safeguards \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguards \ncategories are outlined in paras. 36\u201338.40 TCM established a GRM and formed a grievance \nredress committee in June 2021. MDF has had a GRM in place for ADB-funded projects since \n2010. The PMUs will designate staff to ensure compliance with safeguards, implementation \nprogress reporting, and disclosure requirements.  \n \n36.  Environment (category B). The project is classified category B for environment. Initial \nenvironmental examinations conducted on five sample subprojects indicate that the project is \nunlikely to have any significant adverse environmental impacts that are irreversible, diverse, or \nunprecedented.41 Potential impacts are mainly from construction activities and are site-specific \nand temporary in nature, and can be mitigated to standard levels without difficulty through proper \nengineering design and incorporation or application of recommended mitigation measures and \nprocedures. Expected impacts include noise, dust, and exhaust emissions from equipment and \nconstruction vehicles; river or other surface water impacts; and impacts associated with waste \nmanagement, occupational health and safety, site accessibility, community health and safety, and \ntraffic related to construction. In general, impacts of the rehabilitation works will be positive. An \nenvironmental  assessment  and review  framework  has  been  developed  in  accordance  with \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the Government of Georgia, and local \nenvironmental regulations. \n \n37.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for \ninvoluntary resettlement. A land acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF) was developed \nto  (i)  guide  screening  and  categorization,  impact  assessment,  and  preparation  and \nimplementation of the social safeguards requirements; and (ii) facilitate compliance with the \nrequirements specified in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The LARF will be reviewed from \ntime to time and, if necessary, updated during project implementation, especially if unanticipated \nimpacts arise or if there is any change in scope or change in legal and regulatory frameworks. No \nprovisions of the LARF will be eased in subsequent revisions and updates. A land acquisition and \nresettlement  plan  (LARP)  was  prepared  for  the  three  sample  subprojects  with  involuntary \nresettlement impacts, while a social safeguards due diligence report was prepared for the \nsubprojects not likely to have involuntary resettlement impacts (footnote 41). Training will be \nprovided to TDF to strengthen its capacity for safeguards implementation.  \n \n38.  Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no indigenous peoples as defined by ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement in the project areas. \n \n39.  Public disclosure. Initial environmental examinations, including environment monitoring \nplans, LARF, LARPs, and social safeguards due diligence reports, were cleared and disclosed \non the ADB website on 30 August 2021.
