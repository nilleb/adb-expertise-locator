A  zone  that  usually  surrounds  or  adjoins  core  areas,  and  is  used  for  cooperative \nactivities  compatible  with  sound  ecological  practices,  including  environmental  education, \nrecreation,  ecotourism,  and  research.  In  Tonle  Sap  Biosphere  Reserve,  a  buffer  zone  of  about \n5,400 square kilometers (km2) surrounds the core areas up to the outer limit of the flooded forest. \n \nCommune. The lowest level of administrative unit in Cambodia, consisting of several villages. \n \nCommune  Council.  An  elected  body  that  governs  commune  administration  in  Cambodia.  In \naddition  to  fulfilling  its  administrative  tasks,  commune  councils  participate  in  informal  dispute \nresolution,  plan  and  implement  development  projects,  perform  some  agency  functions  for  the \ncentral and provincial governments, and conduct advocacy. Development activities consist mainly \nof small-scale infrastructure and public goods projects.  \n \nCore  Areas. Securely protected sites for conserving biodiversity, monitoring minimally disturbed \necosystems,  and  undertaking  research  and  other  low-impact  uses  such  as  education.  In  Tonle \nSap  Biosphere  Reserve,  core  areas  are  in  Prek  Toal  (213  km2),  Battambang;  Boeng  Tonle \nChhmar (Moat Kla) (145.6 km2), Kampong Thom; and Stung Sen (63.5 km2), Kampong Thom.  \n \nFlooded  Forest.  A  descriptive  term  for  the  particular  natural  vegetation  that  originally  covered \nmost  of  the  Tonle  Sap\u2019s  floodplains.  It  is  now  characterized  by  low  forest  and  shrubs  that  still \naccount for the productivity of Tonle Sap. \n \nHuman  Development  Index.  The  Human  Development  Report  ranks  countries  according  to  a \nscore between 0 and 1 on the Human Development Index (HDI). A country\u2019s HDI score depends \non life expectancy at birth; adult literacy; combined gross primary, secondary, and tertiary school \nenrollment; and real per capita income in purchasing power parity dollars. (United Nations. 1999. \nHuman Development Report 1999. Available: http://www.undp.org/hdro/pp.htm). \n \nLivelihood. The capabilities, assets, and activities required for a means of living. A livelihood is \nsustainable  when  it  can  cope  with  stresses  and  shocks,  and  maintain  or  enhance  itself  in  the \npresent and future without undermining the natural resource base. \n \nLowlands.  The  land  area  that  is  presently  under  predominantly  agricultural  (cropping  and \ngrazing)  use  on  the  flat-lying  colluvial-alluvial  plain  around  Tonle  Sap  Lake  (also  known  as  the \nGreat  Lake  or  Tonle  Sap).  The  lower  or  innermost  limit  is  determined  by  the  boundary  of  the \nbuffer zone. \n \nProvincial  Support  Team.  Provincial  support  teams  will  comprise  the  following:  (i)  community-\ndriven \nrural \ninfrastructure/irrigation engineer, (iv) procurement specialist, (v) quality assurance engineer, and \n(vi)  an  accountant.  The  team  members  will  work  in  line  department  offices,  coordinated  by  the \ncommunity-driven development specialist in each province. \n \nSeila Program. An aid mobilization and coordination framework providing support to Cambodia's \ndecentralization and deconcentration reforms. Under the Government\u2019s overall reform program, a \nthree-tiered system of planning and budgeting is emerging\u2014focused on commune, province, and \nnational levels.  The  Seila  program ended  in  December  2006.  The  activities  carried  out  by  Seila \nare  now  under  the  mandate  of  the  National  Committee  for  Management  of  the  Decentralization \nand Deconcentration Reform and within the Ministry of the Interior. \n \nTransition Zone. An area in which stakeholders work together in a variety of economic and other \nactivities  to  manage  and  develop  a  biosphere  reserve\u2019s  natural  resources  in  a  sustainable \n\ninfrastructure/road \n\ndevelopment \n\nspecialist, \n\nengineer, \n\nrural \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n\fmanner.

An initial environmental examination was undertaken \nand  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was \nprepared. \n \nThe Tonle Sap Lowlands Rural Development Project (the Project) \nwill  support  40  communes  in  the  development  and  upgrading  of \nrural  infrastructure  through  a  combination  of  community  led  and \nimplemented \nexecuted  activities;  and  government  agency \ninfrastructure development in the provinces of Kampong Chhang, \nKampong Thom, and Pursat in the Tonle Sap basin (Component \n1). It will also assist in the creation of new and improved livelihood \nthese  communes  (Component 2);  and  will \nopportunities \nstrengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  commune,  provincial,  and \nnational organizations (Component 3).  \n \nIt  will  benefit  people  in  the  communes  on  the  lowlands  that  lie \noutside the buffer zone surrounding the Tonle Sap Lake. Poverty \nrates  in  these  communes  average  38%,  which  is  slightly  higher \nthan  the  national  average  of  36%.  About  50%  of  villages  in  the \nselected communes have 40\u201360% of households living below the \nnational poverty line, with peak levels about 80% of households in \nKampong Chhnang. \n\nin \n\n \n\nAgriculture  accounts  for  one  third  of  Cambodia\u2019s  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) and is the main source of livelihood for nearly 80% \nof  the  population.  Many  of  the  people  in  the  lowland  rural \ncommunities  that  surround  Tonle  Sap  depend  on  agriculture,  but \nthey  are  vulnerable  to  shocks.  Accidents  and  ill  health,  seasonal \nshortages  of  rainfall  (especially  at  the  beginning  of  the  rainy \nseason),  seasonal  shortages  of  water  (especially  drinking  water \nduring  the  dry  season),  and  food  shortages  resulting  from \nshortfalls  in  the  rice  harvest  (caused  by  an  unreliable  supply  of \nwater  at  the  start  and  finish  of  both  wet  and  dry  rice  crops)  all \nincrease the vulnerability of people in the lowlands.  \n \nDespite  the  richness  of  the  lake,  poverty  rates  in  the  basin  are \nhigher than in the country as a whole. Over 50% of households do \nnot  grow  enough  rice  to  meet  their  needs.  Seasonal  migration \nfrom lowland communities into the lake buffer zone, to supplement \ndiets,  risks  overexploiting  the  lake  and  exacerbating  existing \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nis  one  of \n\nthe  16  strategic  priorities \n\npressures on its resources.  \n \nIrrigation \nfor  national \ndevelopment,  as  a  remedial  measure  to  earlier  developments \nwhich tend to be poorly designed or constructed on a scale that is \ndifficult  for  communal  maintenance.  Many  schemes  now  need \nurgent  upgrading  to  support  the  needs  of  the  communities. \nFurthermore, \ntransport  and  water  supply  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure also require upgrading. Adoption of new agricultural \npractices  and  opportunities  for  off-farm  employment  in  the \nlowlands  are  restricted  by  limited  vocational  education,  poor \nfinancial services, and poor rural infrastructure.  \n \nThe proposed Asian Development Fund (ADF) IX combined loan \nand  grant  will  enable  the  Project  to  focus  on  community-driven \ndevelopment, \ninfrastructure \ninvestments and creation of new opportunities for on and off-farm \nemployment  to  reduce  poverty  and  vulnerability  in  one  of  the \npoorest regions of Cambodia. \n \nThe  Project  will \nin \n40 lowlands  communes  located  from  the  outer  limit  of  the  buffer \nzone  to  the  foothills  of  the  upper  watershed  area.  It  will  improve \naccess \nthree  provinces \nfactors \nsurrounding  Tonle  Sap  and  diversify \nincome-generating \nopportunities. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $24  million  equivalent, \nincluding contingencies, taxes, and duties.  \n \n\nlivelihoods  of  households \n\nlinked  with  provincial \n\nimportant  production \n\nimprove \n\nlevel \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nin \n\n ($ million) \n\n \n\nItem \nAsian Development Bank Loan \nAsian Development Bank Grant \nGovernment \nCommune Beneficiaries \n    Total \n\nTotal \n10.10 \n9.90 \n3.00 \n1.00 \n24.00 \n\nPercent \n42.00 \n41.00 \n12.50 \n4.50 \n100.00 \n\n \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of \n$10,100,000 equivalent in SDR and a grant of $9,900,000 from its \nADF. \n \nUntil 30 June 2015 \n \n31 December 2014 \n\n \nMinistry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) \n \nSeveral government agencies (at national and subnational levels) \nwill  be  directly  engaged  in  implementation,  including  MOWRAM; \nMinistry of Rural Development (MRD); and Ministry of Agriculture, \nForestry  and  Fisheries  (MAFF).  Provincial  Local  Administration \n\n\frequired \n\nUnits  (PLAUs)  of  Ministry  of  Interior  (MOI)  in  collaboration  with \ncommune councils will facilitate community-led developments.  \n \nEffective communication among these agencies will be essential, \nso  a  project  steering  committee  with  membership  drawn  from \nparticipating  agencies  and  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  state  of \nMOWRAM  is  proposed  to  oversee  implementation.  Provincial \ncoordination  committees  in  participating  provinces  will  facilitate \ninteragency  coordination.  Project  management  in  Phnom  Penh \nwill  consist  of  a  project  director  (senior  professional  staff, \nMOWRAM)  and  four  deputy  directors  provided  by  MOWRAM, \nMAFF, MOI and MRD. \n \nCivil  works,  goods,  and  related  services  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time).  \n \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). The project management office (PMO)  will be \nresponsible  for  the  recruitment  of  a  consulting  firm  using  quality \nand cost-based selection (80:20). A total of 489 person-months of \nconsulting  services  will  be \n(55  person-months \ninternational  and  434  person-months  national).  Total  consulting \ninputs  include  individual  consultants  to  be  recruited  for  specified \nto \ntasks\u20149  person-months \ncoordinate Tonle Sap Initiative activities and 11 person-months of \npost-harvest  management \nperson-months \ninternational, 9 person-months national). \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  direct  and  indirect  economic  benefits  to \nabout  68,000  households  with  a  population  of  about \n354,000 persons in 40 communes selected in the three provinces \naround  the  lake.  It  will  improve  extension  services  to  9,600 \nhectares  (ha) \ninfrastructure \ndevelopment. In addition to irrigation, benefits will be derived from \ninvestments \nincreasing \nagricultural productivity and off-farm business development.  \n \nThe  Project  will  generate  substantial \nthe \nlivelihoods of people in communes surrounding the buffer zone of \nTonle  Sap  Lake,  resulting  in  environmental  benefits  in  the  buffer \nand  core  zones  by  reducing  the  need  for  these  communities  to \nenter the buffer zone to make up for shortfalls in food production \nin the dry season. Creation of new jobs and livelihood activities in \nthe lowland communities will reduce pressure on agricultural lands \nand diminish the incidence of temporary migration to the lake and \nmore  distant  locations. The  Project  will increase  social capital  by \nstrengthening  the  capacity  for  communal  action,  increasing \nwomen\u2019s participation, and providing communal infrastructure.  \n \n\ninternational  consultant \n\nin  small-scale  village \n\nthat  will  benefit \n\nimprovements \n\ninfrastructure, \n\nspecialists \n\nirrigation \n\nfor  an \n\nfrom \n\n(2 \n\nto \n\n \n\niii\n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n \n \n\nof \n\n(ii) \n\npurchase \n\nto  support \n\nthe  capacity \n\n(i) procurement; \n\nfor  strengthening \n\nfinancial  management \n\nThe Project includes measures to avoid or mitigate environmental, \ninstitutional,  and  financial  risks.  The  principal  assumption  is  that \nthe Government will continue the program of decentralization and \ndeconcentration \nfor  decision \nmaking  at  the  local  level.  Recent  governance  risks  identified \ninclude \nexpendable \nmaterials/services;  and  (iii)  quality  assurance  of  works  being \nsubject  to  risks  of  corrupt  practices,  with  existing  financial  and \naccountability  systems  not  providing  expected  standards  of \nfiduciary control. The Government is committed to public financial \nmanagement  reform.  ADB  has  previously  assisted  with  public \nfinancial  management  in  the  Ministry  of  Education,    Youth  and \nSport,,  Ministry  of  Health,  and  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance \n(MEF). The Government has requested ADB technical assistance \n(TA) \nin \nimproved  public \nMOWRAM,  MAFF,  and  MRD.  The  proposed  TA \nis  being \nprocessed  by  ADB  for  approval  in  2008.  The  project  consulting \nservices  include  inputs  for  procurement  and  quality  assurance \nspecialists  at  provincial  level.  ADB  and  the  Government  have \nagreed  a  good  governance  framework  that  will  guide  executing \nand implementing agency staff during project implementation. \n \nIt is assumed that effective rural financial services will be available \nin  all  project  areas  through  existing  commercial  banks  and \nlicensed microfinance institutions. Active coordination between the \noperations of financial service providers and project interventions \nwill  enable  project  beneficiaries  to  access  the  required  services, \nincluding micro-credit loans.  \n \nThe  Project  will  involve  activities  implemented  through  different \nministries,  so  the  project  steering  committee  and  provincial \ncoordination  committees  will  provide  guidance  and  leadership  in \nensuring effective coordination of work programs. \n \n \n\n\fo\n103  30'E\n\nBANTEAY\nMEANCHEY\n\nSisophon\n\nTa Lam\n\nTHAILAND\n\nC A M B O D I A\n\nTONLE SAP LOWLANDS\nRURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\n\nPoipet\n\nSIEM  REAP\n\no13  30'N\n\nMongkol Borey\n\nSambur\n\nPrasat\n\nBansay Traeng\n\nKouk Khmum\n\nPAILIN\n\nPailin\n\nOu Ta Ki\n\nBattambang\n\nPrek Toal\n\nBATTAMBANG\n\nSiem Reap\n\nTonle\nSap\n\nSang Vaeuy\n\nKouk Thiok Leu\n\nLvexeng Ruessei\n\nPralay\n\nSpean Tnaoi\n\no105  30'N\n\no\n103  00'E\n\nTHAILAND\n\n14  00'No\n\nBANTEAY\nMEANCHEY\n\nODDAR  MEANCHEY\n\nSIEM  REAP\n\nTbeng Meanchey\n\nPAILIN\n\nBATTAMBANG\n\nTonle\nSap\n\n107  00'Eo\n\nLAO PEOPLE\u2019S\nDEMOCRATIC\nREPUBLIC\n\nPREAH   VIHEAR\n\nSTUNG TRENG\n\nRATANAKIRI\n\n14  00'No\n\nC A M B O D I A\nKOMPONG\nTHOM\n\nM\n\ne\n\nMONDULKIRI\n\nk\n\no\n\nn\n\ng\n\n \n\nR\n\n.\n\nKRATIE\n\nPREAH   VIHEAR\n\no13  30'N\n\nGulf  of\nThailand\n11  00'No\n\nPURSAT\n\nKOMPONG\nCHHNANG\n\nPHNOM PENH\n\nKOH  KONG\n\nKOMPONG\nSPEU\n\nKANDAL\n\nKOMPONG\nCHAM\n\nPREY\nVENG SVAY\nRIENG\n\nVIET NAM\n\n11  00'No\n\nTAKEO\n\nKAMPOT\n\nKEP\n\nSIHANOUKVILLE\n\no\n103  00'E\n\nB\n\na\n\ns\n\ns\n\na\n\nc\n \n\nR\n\n.\n\nMekong R.\n\n107  00'Eo\n\nSouth\nChina  Sea\n\nMoung Roessei\n\nBoeng\nTonle Chhmar\n\nSrae Sdok\n\nAnlong Vil\n\nRumlech\n\nKhnar\nTotueng\n\nKbal Trach\n\nPursat\n\nTnaot Chum\n\nTonle Sap Biosphere Reserve - Core Areas\n\nSelected Communes of TSLSP\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nCommune Center\n\nNational Road\n\nOther Road\n\nRiver\n\nTransition Zone\n\nBuffer Zone\n\nTSLSP Area\n\n12  00'No\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nPURSAT\n\nN\n\nSamprouch\n\nSan Kor\n\nKOMPONG\nTHOM\n\nKompong Kou\n\nKompong Thom\n\nKompong\nPreah Koki\n\nKhon Rang\n\nMelum\n\nDar\n\nSamraong Saen\n\nKompong Chhnang\n\nChong Doung\n\nBoeng\n\nSralau\n\nPrek Kak\n\nSaeb\n\nKOMPONG\nCHHNANG\n\nAmpil Tuek\n\nAmpil Tuek\n\nKOMPONG CHAM\n\nKompong Cham\n\n12  00'No\n\nPhuni\nTonle Bet\n\n0\n7\n-\n1\n8\n7\n1\n \nR\nM\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\nKilometers\n\nKOMPONG\nSPEU\n\no\n103  30'E\n\no105  30'N\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \n1. \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Tonle Sap Lowlands \nRural Development Project.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nTonle Sap Lake and Lowlands \n\n2. \nTonle Sap is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia, covering an area of 2,500\u2013\n3,000  square  kilometers  (km2)  in  the  dry  season.  Tonle  Sap  River,  which  drains  the  lake, \nreverses its flow in the wet season when the waters of the Mekong River flow into the lake to \ninundate  10,000\u201316,000  km2  for  months.  The  fisheries  of  the  lake,  together  with  the  flooded \nforest  and  agricultural  lands  of  the  inundated  area,  have  underpinned  human  activity  since \nancient  times.1 Tonle  Sap  and  the  associated  heritage  of  Angkor  have  defined  Cambodia's \nidentity.  Today,  the  land,  water,  and  biotic  resources  of  Tonle  Sap  directly  benefit  40%  of  the \npopulation  of  the  provinces  adjoining  the  lake;  and  underpin  food  security  and  employment \nelsewhere.  The  lake  benefits  the  lower  Mekong  basin  as  a  feeding  and  spawning  area  for \nmigratory fish, and is of global significance for biodiversity conservation.  \n \n3. \nThe lowland areas of Tonle Sap basin are the flat low-lying areas that extend beyond the \nbiosphere  reserve  buffer  zone  to  the  foothills  of  the  upper  watershed.  There  is  no  precise \nboundary between the lowland and the buffer zone, but livelihood activities in the lowland area \nare predominantly based on a single wet season rice crop. The lowland areas are characterized \nby soils of low fertility, a climate of pronounced wet and dry seasons, and few income-earning \nactivities or off-farm employment opportunities.2 \n \n\n2. \n\nThreats to Tonle Sap \n\n4. \nIn  Cambodia,  high  population  growth  is  increasing  the  number  of  people  to  feed,  and \nconsumptive  use  of  the  Tonle  Sap  basin\u2019s  natural  resources  is  intense.3 Major  threats  to  the \nTonle  Sap  include  overexploitation  of  fisheries  and  wildlife  resources, particularly  through  the \nfishing lot system, conversion of the flooded forest to agriculture, and collection of fuelwood from \nthe remaining flooded forest. Widespread deforestation in the watersheds is destroying habitats, \nimpairing water and soil quality, and increasing siltation rates. As a result, despite the richness \nof the lake, indicators of poverty in the basin are more severe than in the country as a whole. \nSeasonal migration from lowland communities to the buffer zone and the lake\u2014to supplement \ndiets and exploit lake resources\u2014exacerbates existing pressures on these resources. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  These resources are believed to contribute more to national food security in Cambodia than in the other countries \nof  the  Mekong.  (Their  contribution  to  gross  domestic  product  [GDP]  has  been  reassessed  at  16%.  The  annual \nvalue of the catch is estimated at $200 million\u2013$300 million). \n\n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2005. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Preparing the Tonle \n\nSap Lowland Stabilization Project. Manila (TA No. 4756-CAM, approved on 21 December, for $1,000,000).  \n\n3 \u201cThe  rapid  degradation  of  natural  resources  in  the  Basin  has  resulted  in  high  poverty  incidence  in  the  region  and \nreinforced the pressure on the lake\u2019s resources. As a result, the lake is facing a serious threat of over-exploitation \nand its ecosystem has turned quite fragile. If this problem is not addressed decisively and soon, Cambodia could \nface  an  environmental  disaster  of  enormous  proportions.\u201d  Prime  Minister  Hun  Sen.  2007.  Keynote  speech  at  the \nopening of Tonle Sap Forum, Phnom Penh, 5\u20136 March 2007. \n\n \n \n\n\f3. \n\nPoverty and Vulnerability \n\n \n\nThe  rural  sector  in  Cambodia  accounts  for  the  majority  of  population,  production,  and \n5. \nemployment in the Cambodian economy as well as the great majority of poor people. The sector \ncontinues  to  struggle  under  the  consequences  of  war-torn  infrastructure  and  displaced \ncommunities. Many of the people in the rural communities in the lowlands that surround Tonle \nSap  remain  vulnerable  to  shocks.  These  include  (i)  shortages  of  rainfall  (especially  at  the \nbeginning of the rainy season); and (ii) shortages of water, especially drinking water during the \ndry season, and for cropping at the start and finish of both wet and dry rice crops\u2014leading to \nshortfalls in the rice harvest. On average, over 50% of rural people do not grow enough rice to \nmeet their needs.  \n \n6. \nIn national terms, the Tonle Sap region has the highest incidence of poverty (38%), the \nsecond  highest  average  population  density  (52  persons  per  km2),  and  31%  of  the  population \n(Table A1.1). About 50% of villages have 40\u201360% of households living below the poverty line, \nwith a peak of 80% in parts of Siem Reap and Kampong Chhnang. The poor, as defined by low \nincomes  and  low  consumption  bundles,  generally  tends  to  have  less  access  to  productive \nresources. For example, poorer villages tend to be located where there is less access to natural \nresources or where there are lower quality natural resources (e.g., less productive land in areas \nmore  vulnerable  to  flood  and  drought).  Cambodia  Human  Development  Report  1999  reports \nthat poorer villages have less access to markets (14% of villages have a market), infrastructure \n(43%  of  villages  have  access  to  electricity  and  23%  have  access  to  piped  water),  economic \nservices  (11%  of  villages  have  a  bank  or  credit  organization  and  4%  have  an  agricultural \nextension worker), and political power (the average village is 9 km from the district town). As a \nresult, poorer villages tend to depend more on agriculture activities whereas richer villages are \nmore  diversified,  with  trading  as  the  most  important  economic  activity.  About  90%  of  the  poor \nbelong  to  households  that  rely  on  agriculture  as  the  primary  source  of  income.  These  people \noften suffer from basic food insecurity, manifested as seasonal hunger in the months prior to the \nmajor  harvest,  sometimes  leading  to  a  cycle  of  indebtedness  that  ends  in  loss  of  farm  assets \nsuch as land. The poor tend to have larger families living under one roof, with younger children \nand higher dependency ratios (nonworking to working household members). \n \n7. \nEighty-five  percent  of  Cambodians  are  dependent  on  agriculture  and  non-timber  forest \nextraction for the major part of their livelihoods, although these activities only account for about \none third of gross domestic product (GDP). Opportunities in other sectors, while promising, are \ninadequate  to  absorb  the  250,000  new  entrants  into  the  job  market  each  year,  and  there  are \nsignificant  opportunities  to  improve  the  productivity  and  sustainability  of  traditional  activities  in \nthe  rural  sector.  However,  productive  infrastructure,  technology,  markets,  and  commercial \nservices  remain  weak  in  the  rural  sector;  and  agricultural  output  retains  the  volatility  and \nweather dependence characteristic of a subsistence production pattern.  \n \n8. \nWomen  and  ethnic  minorities  are  vulnerable.  Although  women  have  rights  to  land \nownership, they have less access than men to credit, paid employment, education, and health \nservices. They also have fewer opportunities for self-development or participation in community \ndecision  making4 since  Khmer  tradition  ascribes  a  passive  role  to  women.  Nevertheless,  the \ngender division of labor is changing overall: women and men play progressively interchangeable \nroles  because  women  are  increasingly  called  on  to  meet  household  needs  as  men  migrate  to \nseek paid employment. Ethnic minorities living in the Tonle Sap basin are the Vietnamese and \nMuslim  Cham;  and  small  communities  of  indigenous  peoples  such  as  Kuy,  Por  and  Phnong. \nThe indigenous peoples are the only ethnic minorities that are officially recognized. Even though \nmost of the Vietnamese were born in Cambodia, they are not Khmer people and are classified \n\n                                                 \n4   Currently,  only  about  3\u20135%  of  women  participate  in  committees  such  as  farmer  water  user  groups  (FWUGs). \nHowever, the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) has set a target for women's participation \nin decision-making bodies at commune level of a minimum of 10% by 2010. \n\n2\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nas  immigrants.  This  status  limits  their  participation  in  community-based  natural  resource \nmanagement.  The  Vietnamese  are  further  deprived  by  lack  of  property  rights  and  language \nbarriers. The Cham experience less severe segregation than other minority communities, but all \nethnic minorities are disadvantaged because of inadequate representation at management and \nlegislative levels. There are also many displaced or disabled persons, who suffer from poverty \nand other forms of social deprivation to a greater extent than the rest of the population. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n9. \nAgricultural  Water  Management.  Agriculture  accounts  for  one  third  of  Cambodia\u2019s \nGDP and is the main source of livelihood for nearly 80% of the population. It is widely believed \nthat  lack  of  availability  of  sufficient  water  is  the  critical  constraint  on  rice  production.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  for  Growth,  Employment,  Equity  and  Efficiency  (2004\u2013\n2008)  identifies  irrigation  as  one  of  16  strategic  priorities  for  national  development.  However, \nabout 80% of irrigation schemes in Cambodia were built during the Khmer Rouge era, and even \nschemes  built  prior  to  this  were  often  altered  at  that  time.  Such  schemes  tend  to  be  poorly \ndesigned  and  were  constructed  on  a  large  scale  that  is  difficult  for  communal  maintenance. \nSome  never  operated  and  other  better-designed  systems  that  worked  previously  have  failed \nbecause  of  lack  of  maintenance  (Appendix  1). 5  Inventories  provided  by  the  Provincial \nDepartment  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology  (PDWRAM)  in  provinces  in  the  Tonle  Sap \nbasin  list  200  existing  water  management/irrigation  schemes  in  different  states  of  disrepair, \nvarying in size from about 10 hectares (ha) to 13,000 ha. Many of the small-scale schemes are \nsubsections  of  large  schemes,  but  few  are  functioning  effectively  because  of  inadequate \nstructures,  land  leveling,  field  bunds, 6  and  drainage,  combined  with  poor  crop  husbandry. \nSeveral large schemes in the project area have been rehabilitated in recent years or are being \nupgraded at present, but still lack secondary and tertiary systems to provide effective irrigation.  \n \n10. \nRural  Roads.  Rural  infrastructure  in  Cambodia  is  still  far  from  adequate  because  of \nseveral  decades  of  war  and  the  Government\u2019s  lack  of  resources.  Despite  having  received \nsubstantial external assistance (Appendix 2), the rural road network is still poor, resulting in high \ntransport  costs  and  restricted  access  to  markets.  Improving  access  to  production  factors  and \ninputs, as well as to markets and market information (especially for smallholders), is a key factor \nin turning agriculture into the driving force of pro-poor growth. In some cases, roads proposed \nfor rehabilitation also function as embankments to retain water for crops.  \n \n11. \nOpportunities for New Rural Livelihoods. Economically, Cambodia is at a crossroads \nand a major effort is needed to focus on agriculture as the main driver of broad-based and pro-\npoor  growth.  While  food  security  and  better  nutrition  continue  to  be  core  sector  development \ngoals,  a  move  toward  commercialization  is  required  to  create  economic  opportunities  and \nenable the sector, especially small-scale farmers, to benefit from new economic activities. Value \nchain  analyses  indicate  that  the  largest  losses  to  agricultural  producers  occur  in  post-harvest \nstorage,  processing,  and  marketing.  Numerous  obstacles  make  a  transition  from  low-level \nsubsistence  agriculture  difficult.  However,  improved  agricultural  technologies  and  post-harvest \nvalue  addition,  including  agro-processing  enterprises,  offer  new  opportunities  for  rural \nemployment. Rural off-farm activities and the integration of agriculture in a rural, private sector \nled development framework are needed. \n \n12. \nRural  Financial  Services.  Capacity  building  and  training  can  prepare  individuals  and \ngroups to adopt new on-farm and off-farm enterprises. However, without access to appropriate \nfinancial services, the rural poor is unable to take up these opportunities to increase household \nincome. Numerous microfinance institutions (MFIs) are operating in the Tonle Sap area, so it is \nnot  necessary  to  set  up  a  new  financial  organization  to  provide  financial  services  (including \n                                                 \n5 Halcrow, W.1994.

(April).   \n\n6  Field bunds are the embankments around paddy fields. \n\n \n\n\f4\n \naccess  to  savings;  credits  for  micro,  small,  and  medium  borrowers;  remittances;  and  money \ntransfer)  to  the  project  area.  However,  access  to  and  use  of  formal  financial  services  in  rural \nareas7 remains  limited;  and  constrains  the  use  of  knowledge  about  more  advanced  farming \ntechniques, new markets, and business opportunities. Many MFIs tend to specialize in restricted \nareas  in  a  few  provinces,  so  outreach  is  limited  in  more  remote  rural  regions.  This  results  in \npoor delivery of financial services, and unrealized potential in agriculture and the rural economy \nbecause  of  the  lack  of  access  to  seasonal  working  capital  for  crop  production  and  off-farm \nenterprise development. Expansion of outreach programs will require innovative approaches to \nbusiness skills development in cooperation with financial service providers. \n \n\n \n\n1. \n\nThe Government\u2019s Response \n\n13. \nThe  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  (NSDP),  2006\u20132010,  is  the  formal  means  of \nimplementing  the  Government\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy.  It  sets  national  priorities  of  alleviating \npoverty and enhancing economic growth. Enhancement of the agricultural sector is emphasized \nin order to increase agricultural productivity to boost the incomes of a large portion of the rural \npoor.  Immediate  objectives  include  increased  public  investment  in  rural  infrastructure, \nexpansion of extension services to support crop and livestock production, legal and regulatory \nreform  to  improve  security  of  and  access  to  agricultural  inputs  such  as  land  and  materials, \nimproved  natural  resource  management,  and  increased  availability  of  rural  financial  services. \nRehabilitation  and  construction  of  physical  infrastructure  is  a  second  emphasis.  This  includes \nstructures for management of water resources and irrigation as one of its four components. The \nGovernment recognizes the importance of ensuring sustainability of irrigation infrastructure and \nis  committed  to  (i)  establishing  and  strengthening  farmer  water  user  committees  (FWUC)  and \nfarmer  water  user  groups  (FWUGs)  to  improve  cooperation  for  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M),  and  (ii)  the  introduction  of  an  irrigation  management  transfer  process  to  increase \nparticipatory  management  and  to  implement  a  rational  sharing  of  O&M  between  the \nGovernment and beneficiary communities.  \n \n14. \nNational  Strategy  for  Agriculture  and  Water  (2006\u20132010).  The  NSDP  encourages \nministries  to  plan  in  a  coordinated  manner.  The  Government\u2019s  Strategic  Framework  for \nDecentralization and Deconcentration (D&D) reforms promotes a transfer of responsibilities and \nresources  to  subnational  levels.  During  the  next  5\u20136  years,  the  D&D  reforms  are  expected  to \nradically change the way in which government agencies function. In response to the NDSP, the \nNational  Strategy  for  Agriculture  and  Water  includes  five  main  components:  (i) strengthening \ninstitutional  capacity  for  management  for  the  agriculture  and  water  sectors;  (ii)  improving  food \nsecurity;  (iii)  improving  agriculture  and  agribusiness  (value  chain);  (iv)  improving  water \nresources, irrigation, and land management; and (v) improving agricultural and water research, \neducation, and extension.  \n \n15. \nDevelopment  of  water  management  is  guided  by  the  strategy  of  the  Ministry  of  Water \nResources  and  Meteorology  (MOWRAM),  which  is  based  on  the  recognition  that  the \nGovernment  is  unable  to  finance  and  manage  the  large  number  of  irrigation  systems  in  the \ncountry. In 2000, the Government adopted the policy of participatory irrigation management and \ndevelopment,  which  mandates  the  establishment,  empowerment,  and  transfer  of  responsibility \nof  the  management,  financing,  and  development  of  irrigation  systems  to  FWUCs  and \nsubordinate  FWUGs.  With  this  policy,  the  Government  shifted  its  emphasis  from  directly \nmanaging irrigation systems to building the capacity of FWUCs to manage their own systems.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLessons  \n\n16. \nNumerous  development  agencies,  including  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), \nprovide  external  assistance  to  the  agriculture  sector  in  Tonle  Sap  (Appendix  2).  Key  lessons \n                                                 \n7   Commercial  banks  and  licensed  MFIs  are  expanding  their  branch  networks  in  provincial  and  district  centers, \n\nmaking access less difficult for rural communities. \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nfrom ADB\u2019s experience in the sector in Cambodia include: (i) the decisive role of improved water \nresources  management  as  a  prerequisite  to  stabilizing  and  increasing  agricultural  production; \n(ii) the advantage, in the medium term, of a focus on small to medium-sized irrigation schemes \nwithin an integrated river-basin water management framework, where design and management \nare  based  on  community  participation;  (iii)  the  crucial  importance  of  a  sustainable  financing \nmechanism  for  maintenance  linked  to  increased  farm  incomes;  (iv)  the  need  for  pro-poor \nsustainable growth; and (v) improved access to livelihood assets. \n \n17. \nAn extended period of civil disruption has left Cambodia with a severe shortage of skilled \nand  experienced  professionals.  The  proposed  executing  and  implementing  agencies  are  no \nexception, and previous ADB projects have suffered implementation delays because of limited \nprofessional staff to lead the projects. Capacity building is required at all levels of the agencies, \nparticularly  in  project  management,  fiduciary  control,  and  participatory  development.  However, \nthe  Northern  Rural  Development  Project  and  the  CCDP  (I&II)  have  successfully  implemented \ninvestment  projects  in  a  decentralized  mode,  working  with  provincial  line  agencies  and \ncommune councils.8  \n \n18. \nEfficiency  and  effectiveness  of  resource  management  in  the  Ministry  of  Rural \nDevelopment (MRD); Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF); and MOWRAM are \ncritical to successful rural development. Governance risk assessments9 of MRD and MOWRAM \nprovide  a  detailed  diagnosis  of  key  constraints  in  these  institutions,  and  have  underlined  the \nneed  for  a  substantial  improvement  in  performance  audit  and  fiduciary  control  processes  and \ncapabilities. 10  Work  on  the  Tonle  Sap  Sustainable  Livelihoods  Project  has  been  delayed \nbecause of slow recruitment of consulting services. 11 \n \n19. \nThe  recently  completed  Agricultural  Development  Support  to  Seila  (ADESS)  Project \nfunded  by  the  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD),  shows  that  a  group \napproach  can  enable  very  poor  farmers  to  adopt  new  or  improved  farming  techniques  and \ntechnologies.  The  ADESS  Production  Start-Up  Program  assisted extremely  poor  rural  families \nto take the first step to break out of the poverty cycle. Although the results are encouraging, only \nabout  15%  of  poor  families  in  Pursat,  Banteay  Meanchey,  Battambang,  and  Siem  Reap \nbenefited  from  the  project.  Nevertheless,  the  approach  provides  a  working  model  that  can  be \napplied more widely.  \n \n\n3. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Objectives and Strategies \n\n20. \nADB\u2019s  sector  strategy,  which  is  consistent  with  national  strategies  and  other  external \nassistance,  focuses  on:  (i)  improving  farmers\u2019  ability  to  raise  productivity,  diversify  toward \nhigher-value products, and connect to markets; (ii) improving the market environment for private \nagro-based  enterprise  growth;  and  (iii)  strengthening  institutional  capacity  for  competitive \n\n                                                 \n8 ADB.  2001.

The  Tonle  Sap  Initiative  (TSI)  and  associated  Tonle  Sap  Basin \nStrategy12 form a core element of the sector strategy. Consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy,13 the \nTSI supports basin management organizations, and the worldwide trend toward managing land, \nwater,  and  biotic  resources  within  a  framework  of  basin  planning.  It  involves  an  integrated \nprogram  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  and  investments  to  overcome  binding  constraints  on \npoverty  reduction  while  protecting  vital  ecosystem  services  in  the  basin.  Without  adequate \naccess  to  water,  human  health  deteriorates  and  long  periods  are  spent  on  nonproductive \nactivities such as collection of fuelwood and water.   \n \n21. \nThe  TSI  also  gives  a  geographical  focus  to  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for \nCambodia,  2005\u20132009,14 forming  the  basis  for  effective  and  efficient  setting  of  priorities  and \nplanning  assistance  in  Tonle  Sap  basin.  It  provides  the  framework  for  ADB  assistance  to  the \nGovernment  in  its  efforts  to  balance  demands  for  accelerated  development  with  international \ncommitments  to  protect  and  conserve  the  unique  environment  of  Tonle  Sap  basin.  The \nframework is a 15-year program of integrated TA and investment projects that provide support \nfor:  (i)  capacity  development  for  environmental  protect  and  development  management; \n(ii) strengthening  of  environmental  protection  by  the  Government,  line  agencies,  and  people \nliving in the basin; and (iii) investments in infrastructure, which open new opportunities that bring \nsustainable  and  inclusive  growth  to  some  of  the  poorest  communities  of  one  of  the  poorest \ncountries  in  the  region.  Cambodia  is  ranked  137  of  174  countries  in  the  Human  Development \nIndex (HDI) in the Human Development Report (1999).15  \n \nThe  TSI  is  helping  to  (i)  strengthen  capacity  for  management  of  the  core  areas  of  the \n22. \nbiosphere  reserve  (Tonle  Sap  Environmental  Management  Project);  (ii) improve  water  supply \nand  sanitation  in  basin communities  (Tonle  Sap  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project);16 \nand  (iii)  improve  livelihood  opportunities  in  buffer  zone  communes  (Tonle  Sap  Sustainable \nLivelihoods  Project).  ADB  is  also  financing  the  Northwest  Irrigation  Sector  Project  and  the \nNorthwestern  Rural  Development  Project.  Future  projects  will  include  support  for  participatory \nmanagement  of  the  upper  watersheds  to  promote  improved  livelihoods,  protect  globally \nsignificant biodiversity, and sustain water resources for uses throughout the basin.  \n \n23. \nThe  Project  is  the  fourth  investment  project  in  the  TSI  and  builds  on  approaches  to \ncommunity  driven  development  being  developed  in  the  buffer  zone  under  the  Tonle  Sap \nSustainable  Livelihoods  Project  (footnote  11).  The  Project  will  combine \ninfrastructure \ninvestments, training, and capacity building to improve the performance of on-farm and off-farm \nenterprises  with  the  objective  of  reducing  the  need  for  communities  to  migrate  seasonally  to \nexploit resources in the watershed and the buffer and core areas of the Great Lake.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  Project  will  improve  livelihoods  in  three  provinces  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin,  as \n24. \nsummarized  in  the  project  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  3).  Rural  communities \nwill use the improved coverage and quality of rural infrastructure (irrigation, roads, village level \npost-harvest facilities, and markets) and new opportunities resulting from the application of new \nskills in the pursuit of on-farm and off-farm enterprises to improve their livelihoods. \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2006.

Without roads, essential agricultural inputs cannot be distributed effectively, agricultural \nyields remain low, and it is difficult and expensive to move produce to market. Therefore, rural \ninfrastructure \nlivelihoods,  including:  (i)  small-scale \ninfrastructure  developed  through  activities  managed  by  commune  councils  to  increase \ncommune  and  village  assets;  and  (ii)  larger-scale  irrigation  and  rural  road  infrastructure  to \nsupport  increased  economic  activities,  including  on-farm  and  off-farm  enterprises.  Improved \ninfrastructure  also  attracts  commercial  financial  services  organizations  necessary  to  support \nincreased economic activities and other essential social services such as health and education. \n \n\n \n\na. \n\nImprovement and Development of Social Infrastructure \n\n \nThe  Project  will  provide  block  grants  in  the  form  of  the  Commune  Development  Fund \n27. \n(CDF) to be used for the development, rehabilitation, or upgrading of small-scale infrastructure. \nSocial  infrastructure  needs  at  commune  and  village  level  will  be  identified  and  prioritized \nthrough the decentralized planning process used to prepare commune investment plans (CIP) \nsummarized in Supplementary Appendix B and included in the Project\u2019s annual work plan and \nbudget. Categories to be funded include civil works for: (i) village markets and other commercial \nsupport  infrastructure;  (ii)  communal  grain  dryers;  (iii)  rural  roads,  including  drainage,  bridges, \nand  culverts\u2014linking  villages  within  the  commune  or  linking  inter-commune  roads; 17  (iv) \nirrigation  water  conveyance  and  distribution  facilities; 18 (v)  commune  council  buildings; 19 (vi) \nvillage  water  supply  and  sanitation  schemes;20 and  (vii)  classrooms  at  existing  schools.21 Only \ninfrastructure that is accessible to the poor will be funded under the Project, which implies basic \nstructures  with  low  O&M  costs.  Beneficiaries  of  communal  grain  dryers  and  irrigation  systems \nwill contribute in cash or in kind to share a portion of the construction costs. The maximum cost \nof  an  individual  activity  funded  through  the  CDF  will  be  $20,000  with  an  average  allocation  of \nabout  $75,000  per  commune,  including  the  salary  and  overheads  of  commune  council \nsupporters, over the life of the Project. \n  \n\n                                                 \n17  Road  sections  that  extend  into  the  buffer  zone  of  Tonle  Sap  within  1,000  meters  will  not  be  eligible  for \n\nrehabilitation. \n\n18  The  Project  will  assist  FWUGs  in  the  design  and  layout  of  field  channel  reticulation  but  earthworks  will  be \nperformed by volunteer labor. This will not require involuntary resettlement in principle. Land required for channels \nmay  be  through  voluntary  donation,  if  necessary.  All  farmers  giving  up  land  for  the  channel  must  confirm  the \ndonation  before  construction/rehabilitation  of  the  channel  will  commence. The  Project will  support  construction  of \nregulation  and  crossing  structures  identified  in  the  CIP  and  funded  through  the  CDF  for  improvement  and \ndevelopment of social infrastructure. \n\n19  Commune  council  buildings  will  be  excluded  where  these  are  provided  through  the  Commune  Council \n\nDevelopment Project (footnote 8). \n\n20 Village  water  supply  and  sanitation  schemes  will  only  be  accepted  in  communes  not  covered  by  the  Tonle  Sap \n\nRural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (footnote 16). \n\n21  Proposals  for  school  classrooms  will  only  be  accepted  in  communes  not  covered  by  the  Education  Sector \nDevelopment Program.

The  maximum  cost  of  an  individual  water  management  scheme  will  be \n$100,000  at  an  estimated  cost  not  to  exceed  $550/ha  for  secondary  and  tertiary  canal \ninfrastructure,  including  costs  of  surveys,  design,  resettlement,  civil  works,  and  mitigation  of \nenvironmental impacts. \n\n \n   \n\nc. \n\nImprovement of Rural Roads  \n\n \n30. \nThe  Project  will  support  subprojects  to  improve  the  connection  of  villages  to  commune \ncenters  and  main  highways.  Recognizing  the  importance  of  good  transportation  links,  the \nGovernment has put considerable resources into rehabilitation and reconstruction of rural roads \nthroughout Cambodia.24 Improved maintenance of roads is a key government objective. Villages \nin  the  project  area  are  mostly  clustered  close  to  highways  5  or  6,  and  the  main  scope  is  for \nrehabilitation  of  roads  up  to  10  km  long  (but  mostly  5  km  or  less)  linking  the  communes  to \nhighways 5 and 6.  \n \n31. \nProject support will be limited to improving rural roads and associated structures that are \nimportant  to  the  success  of  development  activities  of  the  Project  or  other  agencies  working  in \nthe communes. Activities will include rehabilitation of strategic rural roads, including upgrading \nor provision of essential bridges, culverts, and fords; and limited assistance with maintenance. \nExisting road alignments will be retained except for specific problem areas. Road sections that \nwould extend into the buffer zone of Tonle Sap within 1,000 meters will not be eligible for project \nsupport. \n \n32. \nThe  Project  will  support:  (i)  rehabilitation  of  about  230  km  of  rural  roads,  according  to \nMRD rural road standards including (a) resurfacing and spot repairs; (b) provision of individual \nbridges  and  ford  crossings;  and  (ii)  organization  and  training  of  rural  road  maintenance \ncommittees,  including  provision  of  basic  road  maintenance  tools.25 The  maximum  cost  of  an \nindividual  road  subproject  will  be  $100,000.  Local  communities  will  contribute  labor  for \nconstruction and maintenance. \n \n\n2. \n\nRural Livelihoods Improvement and Employment Options Enhancement  \n\n33. \nThe Project will support development of new livelihood options for rural communities in \nproject  communes  aimed  at  expanding  on-farm  and  off-farm  agricultural  and  nonagricultural \nincome-generating activities. It will support:  \n \n\n                                                 \n22  Larger schemes may be considered on a case-by-case basis. \n23  Voluntary contribution of labor will be equivalent to one person day per beneficiary household; or a maximum of the \nequivalent  of  15%  of  the  scheme  cost.  Additional  labor  will  be  paid  at  the  unskilled  labor  rate,  agreed  by  the \nProvincial administration. \n\n24  National  and  provincial  (primary  and  secondary)  roads  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and \nTransport  (MPW&T),  but  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  (MRD)  has  sole  responsibility  for  tertiary  and  sub-\ntertiary roads (generally referred to as rural roads). \n\n25 Road maintenance committees may be  established in communes  where the road is  not subject to through traffic \n\nand the commune accepts responsibility for maintenance of the upgraded roads.  \n\n8\n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nintensification  of  rain-fed  and  irrigated  agriculture  through  (a)  organization  of \nfarmer  groups  (for  technology  dissemination,  mutual  learning  and  support,  and \naccess  to financial services); (b) development and implementation of technology \nimprovement  packages,  establishment  of  demonstration  farms,26 and  training  of \nfarmers;  and  (c) facilitating  farmer  group  access  to  existing  rural  financial \ninstitutions for farm credit; and \ndevelopment  of  off-farm  livelihoods through  (a)  organization  of  solidarity  groups \nfor  development  of  small-scale  business  enterprises,  (b)  identification  of  market \nopportunities  and  viable  business  activities,  (c)  training  for  development  of \ntechnical  skills  and  business  management  and  record  keeping,  and  (d) \nassistance  in  development  of  business  plans  and  facilitating  access  to  existing \nfinancial services.  \n\n \nThe  Project  will  use \n\nlevel \n\ninvestments.

It  will  build  on  the  existing  framework \nand  institutional  capacity  for  provision  of  vocational  training.  It  will  support  technical  and \nvocational training provided at the provincial level through government departments such as the \nRural Economic Development Office, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and private sector \nprograms. \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Management \n\nThe Project will support coordination and day-to-day management of the Project through \n36. \n(i)  capacity  strengthening  at  the  executing  agency  (EA),  implementing  agency  (IA),  and \ncommune  council  level  with  provision  for  a  limited  number  of  incremental  technical  staff  at \nselected  offices;  (ii) consulting  services  (national  and  international);  (iii)  provision  of  office \nequipment  and  facilities;  and  (iv)  provision  of  supervision  vehicles  (four-wheel  drive  vehicles, \nmotorbikes,  and  bicycles).  The  Project  will  support  the  recruitment  and  remuneration  of  two \ncommune  council  supporters,  one  female  and  one  male,  to  be  appointed  by  each  commune \ncouncil for a period of 48 months, a total of 3,840 person-months  of support in the 40 selected \ncommunes (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \nC. \n\nADF IX Grant Component  \n\nAs  a  poor,  debt-stressed  country,  Cambodia  is  eligible  for  Asian  Development  Fund \n37. \n(ADF) grant financing of up to 50% of its ADB lending program.27 It is recommended that ADB \nprovide  the  Project  with  $9,900,000  grant  financing  from  the  ADF  IX  grant  facilities.  Special \njustifications include the poverty alleviation focus and the Project\u2019s close alignment with the TSI \nand  the  Government\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy.  The  ADF  IX  grant  will  support  focused  capacity \nbuilding at commune level, aimed at strengthening local decision making and opening access to \nnew  business  and \nfocus  on  community-driven \ndevelopment  will  accelerate  the  reduction  of  poverty  and  vulnerability  in  one  of  the  poorest \nregions  of  Cambodia  as  a  basis  for  sustainable  improvements  to  livelihoods  in  the  Tonle  Sap \n\nlivelihood  opportunities.

The  grant  will  support  project  implementation  consultants,  including  inputs  at \nprovincial  level  to  strengthen  capacity  in  line  departments  to  further  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration efforts. \n \nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n\nirrigation \n\n(designed  and \n\nfinance  upgrading  of \n\nAn  important  feature  of  the  Project  will  be  alignment  with  the  Strategic  Framework  for  \n38. \nDecentralization  and  Deconcentration  Reforms,  which  promotes  major  reforms  of  the  current \nsubnational  governance  system.  The  framework  is  a  5-year  national  program  to  establish \ninstitutional  capacity  at  provincial  level,  establishing  provincial/municipal  and  district  councils, \nand  channeling  development  spending  and  capacity  building  to  all  levels  of  the  subnational \ngovernance system and phasing out of project implementation units.28 In line with the objectives \nof  harmonization  and  the  Government\u2019s  wish  to  empower  communes  to  plan  and  implement \nsubprojects in collaboration with provincial technical departments, the implementation structure \nof the Project will be fully consistent with the framework. Consulting services inputs will mainly \nbe deployed in the selected provinces, and will work in line departments to support and develop \nexisting  offices.  A  minimum  of  incremental  staff  will  be seconded  to these  departments  during \nthe project period to assist with the additional works involved. \n \n39. \nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  intention  that  a  substantial  amount  of \ndomestic  resources  and  external  aid  be  channeled  directly  to  support  newly  empowered  sub-\nnational  units  of  planning  and  budgeting.  The  CDF,  managed  by  the  commune  councils,  will \nfinance  component  elements  of  the  5-year  commune  development  plans  (Supplementary \nAppendix  B)  that  are  prioritized  in  the  commune  investment  plan  annual  planning  cycle.  The \nProject  will  also \nimplemented  by \nMOWRAM/PDWRAM)  and  road  infrastructure  (designed  and  implemented  by  MRD/Provincial \nDepartment  of  Rural  Development  [PDRD]),  identified  in  the  annual  district  integration \nworkshops and provincial investment plan. \n \n40. \nThe  Project  will  support  provincial  implementation  through  provision  of  consulting \nservices  in  each  participating  province  to  assist  line  agency  staff  to  develop  the  capacity  to \nimplement  new  standard  operating  procedures  as  modified  in  agreement  with  ADB. 29  The \nprovincial  support  team  will  provide  training  and  backstopping  to  the  commune  council \nsupporters appointed by the commune councils in project communes, and assist the provincial \nlocal  administration  units  to  monitor  and  report  the  activities  undertaken  by  the  commune \ncouncils. \n \n41. \nAccess  to  rural  financial  services  is  necessary  to  enable  adoption  of  new  technologies \nand to establish small-scale rural enterprises. These services are potentially available through \nexisting  commercial  banking  and  licensed  MFIs  in  all  project  communes.  The  Project  will \nsupport  consulting  services  to:  (i)  strengthen  the  identification  of  new  business  opportunities; \n(ii) coordinate \ntraining,  capacity  development,  and  pilot  demonstration  activities;  and \n(iii) facilitate  access  to  financial  services  in  the  participating  communes,  provided  by  existing \nfinancial  institutions.  It  will  facilitate  individuals  and  groups  to  access  financial  services  at \ncommune level by helping identify viable business opportunities, providing training, developing \nbusiness  plans,  and  making  links  between  financial  service  providers  and  interested \nparticipants.  The  use  of  existing  commercial  and  licensed  service  providers  will  provide  an \ninnovative solution to ensuring sustainable access to financial services in rural areas beyond the \n                                                 \n28  Many project implementation units are of a semi-parallel nature, not fully integrated into government structures.

Project IAs \nwill have the following responsibilities: \n \n\nProvincial Local Administration Units (PLAUs) in project provinces: improvement \nand development of social infrastructure (Component 1a). \nMOWRAM:  improvement  of  agriculture  and  water  management  infrastructure \n(Component 1b). \nMRD: improvement of rural roads (Component 1c).  \n\nrural \n\nlivelihoods \n\nimprovement  and \n\nincome-generating  options \n\n(iii) \n(iv)  MAFF: \n\nenhancement (Component 2). \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n  \n\n47.  MOWRAM will establish a PMO at the national level, headed by a project director. The \nPMO will have four deputy directors (one each from MOWRAM, MRD, Ministry of Interior [MOI], \nand  MAFF)  who  will  be  responsible  for  management  and  supervision  of  the  activities  of  their \nrespective IAs. The PMO will include technical and accounting staff who have had experience \nwith  ADB  procedures,  rules,  and  guidelines;  and  who  will  be  responsible  for  consultant \nfunds  withdrawal,  disbursement,  and  reimbursement.  Project \nrecruitment,  procurement, \nimplementation arrangements are in Appendix 5. \n \n48. \nThe  Government  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  to  oversee  and \ncoordinate project  implementation.  The  PSC  will  be  chaired  by  a  minister  of  MOWRAM  or  his \ndelegate,  with  membership  at  an  appropriate  level  from  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance \n(MEF), MAFF, Ministry of Environment, MOI, Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, and MRD. The PSC \nwill meet on a quarterly basis for the first 12 months after loan and grant effectiveness and at \nleast  every  6  months  thereafter,  or  more  frequently  as  needed.  Within  2  weeks  after  each \nmeeting,  the  PSC 30  will  submit  a  copy  of  the  meeting\u2019s  minutes  to  ADB.  A  provincial \ncoordination committee, to be chaired by the governor or his delegate with membership of the \ndirectors  of  PDWRAM,  Provincial  Department  of  Agriculture  (PDA),  PDRD,  Provincial \nDepartment  of  Environment,  and  chief  of  the  PLAU  will  be  responsible  for  successful \ncoordination of the Project at provincial level. \n \n49. \nPLAUs  and  PDWRAM,  PDRD,  and  PDA  will  assist  in  project  implementation  at  the \nprovincial  level.  Each  department  head  will  designate  department  staff  to  assist  in  day-to-day \nproject implementation. Subprojects meeting project requirements (Supplementary Appendix A) \nwill  be  identified  and  selected  through  the  decentralized  planning  process  currently  used  to \nprepare  5-year  commune  development  plans,  annual  commune  investment  plans,  and  annual \nprovincial  investment  plans.  The  relevant  provincial  departments  will  assist  the  commune \ncouncils  to  carry  out  the  pre-investment  studies  needed  to  (i)  assess  the  feasibility  of  the \n\n                                                 \n30  The  royal  decree  approving  the  formation  of  Tonle  Sap  Basin  Authority  was  signed  by  the  King  of  Cambodia  in \nSeptember  2007.  When  operational,  the  Government  may  consider  assigning  steering  committee  tasks  for  the \nProject to the new authority. \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nproposed  infrastructure  investment;  (ii)  prepare  the  design  and  cost  estimates;  (iii)  assess  the \nlikelihood  of  damage  to  the  environment;  (iv)  assess  the  resettlement  impact,  if  any;  and \n(v) prepare  an  O&M  plan.  Selected  social  infrastructure  subprojects  (under  Component  1a, \nfunded  by  the  CDF)  will  be  implemented  by  commune  councils  with  the  technical  support  of \nappropriate  provincial  departments.  Subprojects  under  Components  1b,  1c,  and  2  will  be \nimplemented  by  the  appropriate  provincial  departments  with  guidance  from  the  line  ministries \nconcerned.   \n \n50. \nThe  Project  will  provide  for  strengthening  the  capacity  of  participating  provincial \ndepartments  and  commune  councils  in  subproject  design  and  implementation,  and  financial \nmanagement  through  incremental  staff  support  and  staff  training.  A  team  of  international  and \nnational consultants will assist the provincial departments and commune councils in the overall \nplanning,  design,  and  implementation;  and  in  addressing  specific  institutional  and  technical \nissues.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n51. \nThe Project will be implemented over 6 years from mid-2008 to mid-2014 (Appendix 6). \nSince  the  subproject  investments  will  be  relatively  small  in  size,  and  many  interventions \nidentified  during  project  design  are  already  identified  in  the  commune  investment  plan, \npreparation work in most commune level subprojects is expected to begin within the first year.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n52. \nGoods and works financed partly or wholly by ADB will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Equipment  to  be \nprocured  under  the  Project  will  consist  primarily  of  office  and  training  equipment,  bicycles, \nmotorbikes, utility vehicles, and minor construction equipment and tools. No contract package is \nexpected to exceed $500,000 and international competitive bidding is not envisaged under the \nProject.  Each  contract  costing  between  $100,000  and  $500,000  will  be  awarded  through \nnational competitive bidding (NCB). Minor equipment and materials costing less than $100,000 \nwill be procured through shopping.  \n \n53. \nNo works contract packages are expected to exceed $100,000. Works contracts under \nComponent  1b,  1c,  and 2  will  be  awarded  by  IAs  on  the  basis  of  NCB.  The  procedures  to  be \nfollowed for NCB, for goods and works, will be those set forth in the Government\u2019s Procurement \nManual  (footnote  34)  with  clarifications  and  modifications  to  be  described  in  the  financing \nagreement between the Government and ADB.  \n\nIndividual works contracts under Component 1a using the CDF will not exceed $20,000 \n54. \nand  may  be  awarded  to  contractors  selected  through  shopping  or  direct  contracting. \nProcurement  and  contract  management  procedures  developed  under  Seila  will  be  used. 31 \nWorks  contracts  under  the  CDF  may  also  be  awarded  to  community  groups  following \nprocedures for community participation in procurement in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines.  The  first  civil  works  contract  in  each  province  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval. \nSubsequently, the PLAU will maintain documents32\n for review by ADB. The project procurement \nplan is in Appendix 7 and the financial management assessment is in Supplementary Appendix \nE. \n \n55. \nAll  procurement  contracts  for  office  equipment  over  $5,000  and  vehicles  will  be \nprocessed and awarded by the PMO. Works contracts under Component 1a will be processed \n\n                                                 \n31National  Committee  for  Support  to  Communes/Sangkats.  2005.  Commune/Sangkat  Fund  Project  Implementation \n\nManual.  \n\n32 These include the commune development plan, bid invitation letters, bid opening statements, bid evaluation reports \nor approval documents, and signed contracts between the commune council and contractors, where applicable. \n\n \n\n\f14\n \nand awarded by respective commune councils. Works contracts under Components 1b, 1c, and \n2 will be processed and awarded by the respective provincial departments.  \n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n56. \nThe Project will require a total of 489 person-months of consulting services (55 person-\nmonths of international specialists and 434 person-months of national specialists). An indicative \nstaffing  schedule  is  in  Appendix  8  and  outline  terms  of  reference  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  F.  All  consultants  except  the  postharvest  management  specialists  and  the  TSI \ncoordinator will be selected and engaged as a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). In selecting the firm, the quality and \ncost-based  selection  method  (80:20)  will  be  used  and  the  short-listed  firms  will  be  required  to \nsubmit  full  technical  proposals.  Provision  has  been  made  for  postharvest  management \nspecialists  (international  and  national)  with  expertise  in  postharvest  technology  to  be  selected \nas  individual  consultants.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  recruit  the  individual  consultants  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s procedure for recruiting individual consultants. The TSI coordinator will \nbe  recruited  by  ADB  to  support  and  coordinate  project  implementation  under  the  TSI,  and \nimprove communication between the EAs of TSI projects and ADB. These arrangements will be \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n57. \nwith  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  and  grant \nregulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the \nright  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. To \nencourage  greater  stakeholder  participation  and  vigilance  and  to  ensure  greater  transparency \nand accountability the Project will do the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\nBuild capacity within the EA to understand and comply with ADB and government \nprocedures as outlined in the project administration manual. \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii)  Widely publicize the existence of the integrity division within ADB\u2019s Office of the \nAuditor General as the initial point of contact for allegations of fraud, corruption, \nand abuse among ADB-financed projects or its staff. \nEstablish  a  project  website  to  disclose  information  about  various  project-related \nissues,  including  procurement.  The  website  will  include  information  on,  among \nothers, the list of participating bidders, name of the winning bidder, basic details \non  bidding  procedures  adopted,  amount  of  contract  awarded,  and  the  list  of \ngoods/services procured. Any bidder may request an explanation from the EA/IA \nas  to  why  a  bid  was  unsuccessful.  The  EA/IA  will  respond  within  20  working \ndays. \nEstablish a reporting system at commune council offices to disclose information \nabout  various  project-related  issues,  including  procurement.  A  public  notice \nboard will display information on, among others, the list of participating bidders, \nname  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding  procedures  adopted, \namount of contract awarded, and the list of goods/services procured.  \nNotify civil society organizations of the date and location of selected events in the \nprocurement process, including public bid openings, contract signings, progress \nreviews, and handover ceremonies. \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\n(vi) \n\nSet  up  a  complaints  and  action  task  force  at  the  PMO  to  receive  and  resolve \ncomplaints/grievances  or  act  on  reports  from  stakeholders  on  misuse  of  funds \nand other irregularities. \n\n \n58. \nDisbursement  to  individual  communes,  provinces,  or  IAs  will  be  suspended  if \nmisprocurement  or  other  irregular  procurement  action  occurs  and  is  not  resolved  to  the \nsatisfaction of ADB. Individual staff of the EA/IAs will be removed from the Project in the event \nof their confirmed participation in cases of corrupt practices. ADB is processing a TA on Public \nFinancial  Management  to  assist  MAFF,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD  to  strengthen  internal  audit \nprocedures  and  ensure  improved  financial  management  and  transparency  in  operations.  The \nTA is expected to be implemented in 2008, coinciding with implementation of the Project, and it \nis anticipated that relevant findings of the TA will be incorporated in the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n59. \nThe  Government,  through  MEF,  will  open  a  US  dollar  denominated  account  at  the \nNational  Bank  of  Cambodia  with  separate  accounts  for  the  project  loan  and  grants  proceeds \nimmediately  after  loan  and  grant  effectiveness.  MOWRAM  will  open  US  dollar  denominated \nimprest  accounts  in  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  immediately  after  loan  and  grant \neffectiveness.  The  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nProject advances will be deposited into the imprest accounts on the basis of the estimated next \n6 months of project expenditures or a maximum of 10% of the loan/grant amount, whichever is \nlower.  MOWRAM  will  transfer  part  of  the  imprest  account  funds  to  second  generation  imprest \naccounts  held  by  PDWRAM,  PDRD,  and  PDA  with  a  commercial  bank  to  finance  activities \nunder  Components  1b,  1c,  and  2,  respectively.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  replenished  and \nliquidated  on  a  monthly  basis  or  when  the  accounts  are  drawn  down  by  20%  of  the  initial \ndeposits. MOWRAM will also transfer part of the imprest account fund to the CDF accounts held \nby  participating  commune  councils  with  a  commercial  bank  to  finance  activities  under \nComponent 1a. MOWRAM will disburse $1,000 to each commune CDF to enable recruitment of \ncommune  council  supporters  to  assist  the  councils  in  preparing  projects  for  approval. \nAppendix 9 shows project accounts and fund flows. \n \n60. \nThe  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  used  to  liquidate  and  replenish  the \nimprest  accounts  for  eligible  expenditures.  Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or \nliquidated  under  this  procedure  shall  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  $50,000.  Statement  of \nexpenditures  documentation  will  be  retained  at \nthe  PMO  and  participating  provincial \ndepartments. Imprest account and statement of expenditures records will be audited during the \nannual audit process.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe  Project  will  be  administered  in  accord  with  the  Financial  Management  Manual  for \n61. \nInvestment  Projects  (footnote  29),  which  describes  the  Government\u2019s  financial  management \npolicies  and  procedures  for  efficient  and  effective  implementation  of  ADB  and  World  Bank \nprojects, and achievement of the objectives. MOWRAM, MRD, MAFF, PLAU, and participating \nprovincial  departments  and  communes  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  loan  and  grant \nproceeds for the Project. Operating advances to EA/IA staff will be reconciled within 1 week of \nthe  end  of  each  month  and  before  further  advances  are  made.  IAs  will  prepare  and  submit \nmonthly financial reports to PMO by the 15th day of the following month. The PMO will submit a \nconsolidated quarterly report to ADB, MEF, and the PSC not later than 1 month after the end of \nthe reporting quarter. \n \n62. \nThe  project  accounts  will  be  audited  each  year  by  independent  external  auditors \nacceptable to ADB. The audited accounts, together with the auditor\u2019s report, will be submitted to \n\n \n\n\f16\n \nADB not more than 6 months after each financial year. The imprest accounts and statement of \nexpenditures  will  be  audited  as  part  of  the  regular  audit  of  project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements,  and  the  audit  report  will  include  auditor\u2019s  opinions  on  the  imprest  account  and \nstatement of expenditures.  \n \n\n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n\n63. \nThree  different  kinds  of  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  during  project  implementation: \n(i) progress monitoring, (ii) safeguard monitoring, and (iii) benefit monitoring and evaluation. The \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 3) will be used by the PMO, assisted by the project \nconsultants, to prepare and implement a project performance management system (PPMS) to \n(i)  examine  the  Project\u2019s  technical  performance;  (ii)  evaluate  delivery  of  project  facilities; \n(iii) assess  achievement  of  the  Project\u2019s  objectives;  and  (iv)  measure  the  Project\u2019s  social, \neconomic,  financial,  and  institutional  impacts.  Socioeconomic  data  shall  be  disaggregated  by \nincome group, gender, and ethnic group where applicable. Gender-disaggregated indicators will \nbe  established  for  the  PPMS,  and  monitoring  will  be  continued  to  ensure  that  activities  are \ncarried out effectively and targets reached. The EA and IAs will be responsible for carrying out \nPPMS  activities.  IAs  will  provide  the  PMO  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  their  activities, \ncompliance with safeguard requirements, and achievement of outputs. These will be reflected in \na consolidated quarterly progress report.33 Quarterly reports will be submitted to ADB, the PSC, \nIAs,  and  MOWRAM\u2019s  Gender  Mainstreaming  Action  Group  within  1  month  of  the  end  of  each \nquarter.  Baseline  data  for  each  commune  will  be  assembled  from  government  sources  and \nthrough  household  surveys  and  participatory  monitoring  activities.  The  PMO  will  establish  a \nbaseline data set for each commune within 6 months of loan and grant effectiveness. Detailed \nanalysis  of  project  impacts  will  be  presented  in  a  final  monitoring  report  before  project \ncompletion.  A  project  completion  report  will  be  prepared  by  the  PMO  and  submitted  to  ADB \nwithin  3  months  after  completion  of  the  Project.  MOWRAM  agreed  to  ensure  that  a  qualified \nsocial  science  or  other  suitably  qualified  institution  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  contracted  to \nconduct  independent  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  resettlement  process  and \nimpacts, with reports provided to ADB and EA every 6 months. Key indicators are identified in \nSupplementary Appendix G. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\nADB and the Government will undertake semiannual reviews facilitated by the PMO. The \n64. \nreviews will: (i) examine the appropriateness of implementation arrangements and schedules of \nactivities, (ii) assess the procedures for commune development and infrastructure development \nplans, (iii) review compliance with agreed procurement procedures, (iv) analyze the outcomes of \ncapacity  building  and  training  programs,  and  (v)  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  safeguard \nprocedures. A comprehensive midterm review will be jointly undertaken by the Government and \nADB within 36 months of loan and grant effectiveness to identify any problems and constraints \nencountered, and assess the need for midcourse modification of the project scope and financing \nand implementation arrangements. Technical and budgetary changes to the project documents, \nincluding reallocation of loan and grant proceeds, will also be considered. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n65. \n\nInvestment  in  rural  infrastructure,  combined  with  delivery  of  technical  services,  will \n\n                                                 \n33  Quarterly  reports  will  include:  (i)  description  of  progress  by  component  and  the  Project  as  a  whole  during  the \nperiod;  (ii)  changes  to  implementation  plans;  (iii)  details  of  resettlement;  (iv)  implementation  of  the  environment \nassessment  and  review  framework;  (v)  major  project  activities  by  the  PMO,  EA,  and  IAs;  (vi) financial  and \nprocurement-related information; (vii) problem summaries and proposed remedial action; and (viii) the work plan for \nthe next period.  Second and fourth quarter reports will include assessments of impacts on targeted beneficiaries. \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\ndirectly  benefit  about  68,000  households,  including  354,000  people  in  40  communes \n(Supplementary  Appendix  A)  in  three  provinces  around  Tonle  Sap,  and  will  strengthen  local \ngovernment authorities in facilitating and delivering services to these communities. Benefits will \ninclude: (i) a reduction in poverty in the target districts, (ii) increased agricultural production and \nother  livelihood  activities,  (iii) community  empowerment,  and  (iv)  increased  local  government \ncapacity. \n\n66.   Economic  Benefits.  The  cumulative  and  multiplier  effects  of \nimproved  rural \ninfrastructure, increased household incomes, and reduced poverty will enable greater economic \nactivity in the target communes. The Project will assist beneficiary families to start up livelihood \nactivities  or  enjoy  greater  participation  in  them.  Project  outcomes  that  will  enhance  economic \nactivity  include  (i)  increased  employment;  (ii)  increased  wealth  as  a  result  of  accumulation  of \nagricultural  assets;  (iii)  improved  access  to  financial  services  for  poor  rural  households; \n(iv) higher  food  security;  (v)  value  addition  at  household  and  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises levels; (vi) improved yields, resulting in tradable surpluses; (vii) greater use of farm \ninputs,  resulting  in  higher  turnover  for  suppliers;  (viii)  small-scale  infrastructure  improvements, \nincluding roads and irrigation rehabilitation; and (ix) in the medium and long term, higher levels \nof tax revenue to the Government, which should lead to improved government services. \n\n67. \nThe Project adopts a sector approach, where the entire scope of project activities is not \nknown at the project preparation stage. Five core subprojects34 were analyzed as representative \nevaluations of the Project\u2019s economic viability and financial sustainability. The economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) was calculated for these subprojects to determine their economic viability \nand  serve  as  benchmarks  for  selection  of  subprojects  at  the  time  of  project  implementation. \nBase case EIRRs range between 19.0% and 22.1%; economic net present values (ENPVs) are \nin  the  range  of  $419,000  and  $520,000;  and  benefit-cost  ratios  are  estimated  in  the  range  of \n1.49\u20131.70.  These  indicators  suggest  that,  other  things  being  equal,  all  five  core  subprojects \nexamined are economically viable since EIRRs are above the cutoff rate of 12%. \n\n68. \nThe  five  core  subprojects  selected  for  the  analysis  covered  a  population  of  about \n60,000 people  (11,000  households),  63%  of  which  are  categorized  poor  compared  to  the \nnational average of 36%. Major benefits for target beneficiaries will come from net incremental \nincome generated by livelihood models as a result of the Project\u2019s support to increase cropping \nintensities,  access  to  finance,  and  extension  service  schemes,  among  others  (Supplementary \nAppendix  K  includes  estimates  of  livelihood  models).  Project  investment  in  new  infrastructure, \nas well as upgrading and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, will bring about a wide range of \nother  benefits\u2014mainly  via  cost  savings.  Numerous  types  of  cost  savings  are  expected, \nincluding savings from reduced damages from floods, travel time/cost savings for potable water, \nand health and medical cost savings.  \n\n69. \nA  number  of  other  benefits  cannot  be  readily  quantified,  including  (i)  reduced  food \npoverty  via  better  food  security;  (ii)  enhanced  local  capacity  through  TA  in  planning  and \nmanagement  of  infrastructure;  (iii)  increased  exchanges  of  experience,  skills,  and  farming \ntechniques;  (iv)  local  savings  promotion;  (v)  empowerment  of  women;  (vi)  improved  teaching \nand  learning  quality  through  school  improvements  (new  construction  and  rehabilitation); \n(vii) increased awareness and adjusted mindset in natural resource protection; and (viii) a wide \nrange of benefits and cost savings attributed to rural infrastructure that are not readily quantified \nsuch  as  travel  time  and  vehicle  cost  savings,  transport  services  development  at  communes, \nincreased  utility  of  land  frontages  created  by  improved  intervillage  and  inter-commune  roads, \nand road links to provincial and national highways. Economic analyses are in Appendix 10 and \nSupplementary Appendix K. \n\n                                                 \n34 These are (i) Ampil Tuek Commune, Kampong Tralach District, Kampong Chhnang Province; (ii) Pralay Commune, \nStoung  District,  Kampong  Thom;  (iii)  Rumlech  Commune,  Banan  District,  Pursat  Province;  (iv)  Srae  Sdok \nCommune,  Kandieng  District,  Pursat  Province  (subsequently  dropped  because  of  overlap  with  Tonle  Sap \nSustainable Livelihoods Project); and (v) San Kor Commune, Kampong Svay District, Kampong Thom Province. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n18\n \n70. \nSocial Impacts. The major social impacts of the Project are expected to be positive, and \nwill  entail  improved  livelihoods  and  reduced  levels  of  poverty  for  the  population  of  the  project \narea.  Annual  household  expenditure  is  estimated  to  increase  by  26%  from  $300  to  $378  and \nincremental  employment  of  about  1,000  person-years  per  annum.  The  majority  (67%)  of  the \nbenefits will go to farmers, the Government will receive about 36% (mostly in the form of duties \nand taxes), while new businesses will receive 5%, and hired labor 3%. The estimated poverty \nimpact ratio will be 41%. No involuntary resettlement is foreseen under subprojects funded from \nthe  CDF.  Safeguards  are  built  into  the  community  decision-making  process  to  deal  with  any \nlosses that may arise. Significant resettlement impacts are not expected from agricultural water \nmanagement  infrastructure  and  rural  road  infrastructure  because  the  works  will  be  improved \nalong existing rights-of-way and will mainly require, if any, the acquisition of minor amounts of \nland  plus  compensation  for  roadside  trees,  crops,  or  possibly  small  buildings.  Subproject \nselection criteria  will  exclude  any  activities  that  cause  significant  involuntary  resettlement.  The \nsummary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  11.  The  Government  and  ADB \nhave  agreed  on  a  resettlement  framework  (Appendix  12  and  Supplementary  Appendix  H).35 \nAllowances,  operational  and  administration  costs,  surveys,  monitoring,  and  reporting  will  be \nfinanced  from  loan  and  grant  funds.  The  resettlement  entitlement  matrix  is  shown  in \nSupplementary Appendix M. \n \n71. \nThe Government and ADB have agreed that the Project will ensure the participation of \nindigenous people, if these communities are located in the project communes. Special attention \nwill be given during planning and implementation of subprojects so that indigenous people will \nderive maximum benefit from the subproject. The preparation of ethnic minority specific actions \nwill form a part of subproject design in communes where indigenous people live. The Cham is \nthe major group of non-Khmer living in the Project\u2019s target districts and communes. Throughout \nthe  target  provinces,  Cham  live  in  all-Cham  and  mixed  Cham-Khmer  villages.  Although  the \nCham are Muslim and form communities based on religious, social, and cultural practices, their \nlivelihoods are similar to the majority Khmer population. \n  \n72. \nThe  rapid  rural  appraisal  under  the  project  preparatory  TA  (footnote  2)  concluded  that \nwomen will be beneficiaries of subprojects. Women comprise around half of all workers in the \nagriculture sector; and contribute more hours of labor to cultivation, agricultural processing, and \nmarketing of agricultural produce than men. In the project communes, the proportion of female-\nheaded  households  ranges  from  8%  to  36%  based  on  data  from  the  2005  Commune  Data \nBase. Female-headed households are poorer\u2014they constitute 41% of the poor and 32% of the \npoorest  wealth  categories  compared  with  18%  of  rich  households  and  24%  of  middle  wealth \nhouseholds.  The  Project\u2019s  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  ensures  that  women  will  benefit  equally \nfrom  the  Project  compared  with  men  (Appendix  13).  It  is  designed  to  address  the  negative \nimpacts  of  resettlement,  if  any;  and  it  will  ensure  that  gender  issues  are  mainstreamed  into \nsubproject selection, resettlement plans, and environmental assessments.  \n \n73. \nSpecial  measures  have  been  built  into  the  project  design  to  deal  with  potential  social \nimpacts  and  promote  community  participation.  These  include  (i)  the  appointment  of  male  and \nfemale  commune  council  supporters  by  each  commune council;  (ii)  a  resettlement  framework; \n(iii)  detailed  description  of  participatory  practices \nidentification,  design, \nimplementation, and O&M; and (iv) capacity building training for PLAU, PDWRAM, PDRD, PDA, \nin  social  safeguards  and  community  participation.  Community-driven \nand  PMO  staff \ndevelopment specialists will be located in each participating province.  \n \n74. \nEnvironmental  Concerns.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  conducted \nfor  the  Project  as  a  whole  and  for  the  sample  subprojects  to  identify  potential  impacts, \nappropriate mitigation measures, and monitoring mechanisms. The environmental assessment \n                                                 \n35  The Government approved the resettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix H) on 7 September 2007. ADB \nfunds  can  be  used  for  compensation  to  project-affected  persons  for  loss  of  income,  loss  of  crops,  and  economic \nrehabilitation. Acquisition of land is not eligible for ADB funds. \n\nfor  subproject \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\nis  summarized  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I.  The  IEE  confirms  that  the  Project  is not  likely  to \ncause  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  since  investments  are  small  in  scale  and \nmainly focus on rehabilitation or upgrade of existing structures. Subproject screening criteria will \nexclude subprojects that will be located within or adjacent to environmentally sensitive areas or \nwould  cause  negative  environmental  impacts.  Projected  minor  impacts  can  be  minimized  with \nthe  proposed  mitigation  measures,  and  an  adequate  budget  is  allocated  in  the  overall  project \ncosts  for  this  cost.  Subprojects  will  follow  environmental  assessment  procedures  stipulated  in \nthe environmental assessment and review framework (Supplementary Appendix J) developed to \nensure  compliance  with  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy (2002). \n \nB. \n\nRisks and Mitigation \n\nRisks  associated  with  rural  infrastructure  activities  include limited  capacity  of  provincial \n75. \nand  district  staff,  lack  of  adherence  to  technical  and  environmental  standards  during \nconstruction,  and  the  inability  of  beneficiaries  to  operate  and  maintain  investments  after \ncompletion. The infrastructure to be provided is small-scale, and most of these concerns will be \naddressed through rigorous supervision, training, and the creation of responsive user groups to \nensure  maintenance.  The  consulting  services  will  include  community  development  specialists \nlocated in each province, designated as deputy team leaders and leading the provincial support \nteam,  to  assist  line  agencies  in  implementing  the  Project  in  accordance  with  the  project \nadministration manual through the existing provincial offices.  \n \n76. \nRecent  governance  risk  assessments  have  identified  (i)  procurement,  (ii)  purchase  of \nexpendable materials/services, and (iii) quality assurance of works as being subject to high risk \nof corrupt practices (footnote 12).  Financial and accountability systems do not currently provide \nan  acceptable  standard  of  fiduciary  control.  The  Government  is  committed  to  public  financial \nmanagement  reform;  and  has  requested  ADB  assistance  for  TA  to  support  improved  public \nfinancial management in MOWRAM, MAFF, and MRD  (para. 58). This is expected to become \navailable  within  9  months  of  the  project  loan  and  grant  effectiveness.  A  good  governance \nframework has been developed for the Project and agreed with Government to guide EA and IA \nstaff during implementation (Supplementary Appendix N). \n \n77. \nThe  Government\u2019s  decentralization  and  deconcentration  program  is  radically  changing \nthe  way  in  which  government  agencies  function.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  during  a \nperiod  of  evolving  decentralization.  As  a  result,  it  might  face  coordination  problems  between \nnational  sector  agencies  and  province,  district,  and  commune  governments.  This  risk  will  be \nmitigated through the PSC as a forum for interagency coordination of action plans, and regular \nmeetings between the PMO, provincial IAs, and the provincial support teams.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n78. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  only  subprojects  without  significant  resettlement \nimpacts, as defined in ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), will be financed \nby the Project. Subproject short resettlement plans, prepared in accordance with the \nprocedures given in the resettlement framework, will be disclosed to people affected \nprior to submitting to ADB for review. Approval of the resettlement plan by ADB will \nbe a precondition to award of contracts for civil works. \nThe Government will ensure that appropriately qualified and experienced personnel \nare appointed to the PMO. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n(iii)  Within  three  (3)  months  of  the  loan  and  grant  effective  date,  the  Government  will \nestablish a provincial coordination committee in each participating province, chaired \nby  the  provincial  governor  or  his  delegate,  with  membership  consisting  of  the \nprovincial  directors  of  PDWRAM,  PDA,  PDRD,  and  Provincial  Department  of \nEnvironment, and the chief of the PLAU, and which shall be responsible for overall \ncoordination of the Project at the provincial level.  \n\n(v) \n\n(iv)  Within  six  months  of  the  loan  and  grant  effective  date,  the  Government  will  ensure \nthe PMO has established a project specific web-site for public disclosure about the \nuse  of  the  loan  and  grant  funds;  including  details  of  procurement  and  contract \nawards, and reports of the independent monitor. The web site will be updated within \nfour  weeks  of  contract  awards.  Arrangements  for  display  of  project  information  on \ncommune notice boards will be made. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  provincial  director  of  each  IA  and  the  chief  of \nthe PLAU will identify the technical staff responsible for implementing the Project. All \nProject  staff  will  be  knowledgeable  about  ADB  procedures, \n(i) \nimplementation,  (ii)  procurement,  (iii)  use  of  consultants,  (iv)  disbursement,  and  (v)  \nprevention of fraud and corruption. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  Project  staff  are  aware  of  the  requirements  of \nthe Project\u2019s Good Governance Framework.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  MOWRAM  establishes  a  Complaints  and  Action \nTask Force to receive and resolve complaints or grievances related to the project.  \n\nincluding \n\n(vii) \n\n(vi) \n\n(viii)  The Government will ensure MOWRAM publicizes the existence and role of the ADB \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\nIntegrity Division.  \nCivil society organizations will be notified and invited to observe selected events (bid \nopenings, contract signings, and meetings to review Project progress).  \nSelection of subprojects will be carried out in accordance with the agreed selection \ncriteria  and  that  subprojects  are  included  in  the  provincial  investment  plan  or \ncommune investment plan as appropriate and integrated to the annual work plan and \nbudget. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  each  IA  in  the  participating  provinces  carries  out \nenvironmental screening for all proposed subprojects to determine the environmental \ncategorization  and  prepare  the  necessary  environmental  safeguard  documents  for \ninclusion  in the  Project\u2019s  annual  work  plan  and budget.  MOWRAM  will  ensure  that: \n(a) environmental assessment documents are based on the environmental screening \nchecklists  and  on  the  sample  IEE  prepared  during  project  preparation;  (b)  the \nenvironmental  assessment  documents  meet  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \nrequirements; (c) IEEs include details of local consultation carried out; and (d) IEEs \nare  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  prior  to  commencing  activities  under  a  works \ncontract  for  a  subproject  if  any  critical  environmental  issues  have  been  identified. \nThe Government will ensure that all civil works contracts include specific measures \nto mitigate negative environmental impacts and will monitor their implementation. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that,  in  the  event  unexploded  ordnance  clearance  is \nneeded, the Government and MOWRAM will remove, at its own cost, all unexploded \nordnances  suspected  to  exist  on  subproject  sites  by  engaging  the  services  of  a \nreputable  and  experienced  mine  security  organization,  acceptable  to  ADB,  to  carry \nout and then certify subproject area clearance.  \n\n(xiii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  EA  and  IAs  utilize  the  agreed  environmental \nassessment  review  framework  to  implement  the  Project;  the  EA  will  monitor  the \ncontractors\u2019  implementation  of  civil  works  and  ensure  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures identified in the IEE are employed.   \n\n(xiv)  Tender documents will include provisions to ensure contractors\u2019 preferential hiring of \nlocal  labor,  and  to  comply  with  the  labor  law/code  including  guaranteeing  equal \nopportunities  for  female  workers  to  work  with  the  principle  of  equal  pay  for  work  of \n\n20\n \n\n \n\n\fequal value. Contractors will be required to recruit women as a minimum of 35% of \nthe paid unskilled labor. \nIn  the  event  that  indigenous  people  are  affected  by,  or  are  beneficiaries  of,  any \nsubproject,  the  provincial  rural  development  committee  will  ensure  that  ethnic \nminority specific actions will be prepared and implemented in each subproject area. \n\n(xvi)  The Government will ensure that the Project is implemented in accordance with the \nagreed GAP (Appendix 13) and shall include, but not be limited to the following: \n\n(xv) \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nCommune  council  supporters  (1  female  and  1  male  per  commune)  will  be \nhired to enable women\u2019s participation during subproject preparation.  \nAt  least  30%  of  the  management  committee  of  each  group  (e.g.,  FWUG, \nFWUC, road maintenance committee, etc.) will be female and all groups will \nhave 30% female members. \nOn aggregate, at least 30% of the participants of all the training programs will \nbe female. A minimum of 15% of participants at all training programs will be \nfemale. \n\n \nB. \n\nConditions for Loan and Grant Effectiveness \n\n79. \nAs a condition for declaring the loan and grant effective, the membership and mandate \nof the PSC will be confirmed by the Government; and the PMO will have been established and \nprofessional staff appointed. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n80. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 6,466,000 to \nthe  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Tonle  Sap  Lowlands  Rural  Development \nProject from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nFinancing Agreement presented to the Board; and \nthe  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $9,900,000  to  the  Kingdom  of \nCambodia  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  for  the  Tonle  Sap  Lowlands \nRural Development Project. \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n  \n14 November 2007\n\n21 \n\n \n\n\f22  \n\nAppendix 1     \n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nTonle Sap Basin in Transition \n\n \nA. \n \nThe Tonle Sap Initiative (TSI)1 is a response to severe pressure on Tonle Sap Lake (also \n1. \nknown  as  the  Great  Lake  or  Tonle  Sap),  caused  particularly  by  increasing  population  and \neconomic  development.  In  the  provinces  surrounding  the  lake\u2014Kampong  Chhnang,  Pursat, \nBattambang,  Banteay  Meanchey,  Siem  Reap,  and  Kampong  Thom\u2014about  38%  of  the \npopulation  falls  under  the  official  poverty  line,  and  half  of  the  villages  have  40\u201360%  of  their \nhouseholds living below the poverty line (Table A1). Many poor households migrate seasonally \nto the lake and upland forests to exploit natural resources and supplement the livelihood gained \nin their own village. This adds to the pressures placed on the lake by resident communities, and \nresults  in  rapid  overexploitation  of  fisheries  and  wildlife,  encroachment  on  the  lakeshores  for \nagriculture  during  the  dry  season,  pollution,  and  cutting  of  the  remaining  areas  of  seasonally \nflooded forests. \n\nTable A1: Geographic Distribution of Poverty in Cambodia \n\n \n \nProvince \nKompong Cham \nKandal \nPhnom Penh \nPrey Veng \nBattambangb \nTakeo \nSiem Reapd \nKompong Speu \nBanteay Meanchey \nKompong Thom \nKampotf \nSvay Rieng \nKompong Chhnang \nPursat \nKratie \nKrong Prean Sihanouk \nKoh Kong \nPreah Vihear \nRatanak Kiri \nStung Treng \nMondul Kiri \nTotal \n\nLevel \n1,608,914 \n1,075,125 \n   999,804 \n   946,042 \n   816,035 \n  790,168 \n  764,443 \n   598,882 \n577,772 \n569,060 \n557,065 \n478,252 \n417,693 \n360,445 \n263,175 \n155,690 \n132,106 \n119,261 \n  94,243 \n  81,074 \n  32,407 \n  \n11,437,656 \n\nPopulation \nPercent \n14.1 \n9.4 \n8.7 \n8.3 \n7.1 \n6.9 \n6.7 \n5.2 \n5.1 \n5.0 \n4.9 \n4.2 \n3.7 \n3.2 \n2.3 \n1.4 \n1.2 \n1.0 \n0.8 \n0.7 \n0.3 \n100.0 \n\nDensitya \n  164 \n  301 \n3448 \n   194 \n    68c \n 222 \n    68e \n  85 \n  87 \n 41 \n108g \n161 \n  76 \n    28 \n 24 \n179 \n 12 \n  9 \n 9 \n 7 \n 2 \n64 \n\nHDI \n\nScore \n0.475 \n0.496 \n0.936 \n0.419 \n0.456 \n0.432 \n0.325 \n0.456 \n0.409 \n0.336 \n0.448 \n0.429 \n0.453 \n0.401 \n0.506 \n0.659 \n0.374 \n \n0.375 \n0.371 \n0.216 \n0.472 \n\nRank \n5 \n4 \n1 \n12 \n6 \n10 \n19 \n7 \n13 \n18 \n9 \n11 \n8 \n14 \n3 \n2 \n16 \n \n15 \n17 \n20 \n \n\nHDI = human development index. \na Persons per square kilometer. \nb Includes Krong Pailin. \nc Battambang only.

In  response  to  the  NSDP,  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology \n(MOWRAM) considers that its principal focus must be on extending the irrigated area. There are \nmany  uncertainties  regarding  definitions  and  actual  areas,  but  MOWRAM  set  a  goal  in  its \nStrategic Development Plan for the Water Sector, 2006\u20132010, that farmers of irrigable cropland \nare better able to manage water over an area that is increasing by at least 10,000 hectares (ha) \nper  year.  A  similar  goal  has  also  been  set  for  rain-fed  croplands.  These  are  extremely \nchallenging,  but  considered  necessary  if  the  Government\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  is  to  be \nachieved  in  practice.  Inevitably,  MOWRAM  must  allocate  considerable  resources  and  effort  to \nirrigation systems.  \n \nC. \n \n4. \nAgriculture  accounts  for  one  third  of  Cambodia\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  is \nthe main source of livelihood for nearly 80% of the population. In 2005/2006, the total cultivated \narea  of  rice  was  2.44  million  ha  (2.12  million  ha  in  the  wet  season),  with  0.23  million  ha  of \nindustrial crops and 0.23 million ha of secondary crops. Total rice production in 2005 was 5.99 \nmillion  tons,  giving  a  national  surplus  of  over  1.30  million  tons.  Average  rice  yields  have \nincreased markedly to an average of 2.48 tons/ha in 2005. Yields of rice grown during the dry \nseason  (December\u2013March)  on  average  are  higher  than  during  the  wet  season  (May\u2013\nSeptember): 3.09 tons/ha versus 2.26 tons/ha in 2005. Total 2005 dry season production was \n1.25 million tons (21% of the total). Yield and total production are very dependent on weather \nconditions and flooding, so recent increases may not necessarily be sustained.   \n \n5. \nLack of availability of sufficient water is widely perceived as the critical constraint on rice \nproduction.  The  Government\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  identifies  irrigation  as  one  of  16  strategic \nthe  Food  and  Agricultural \npriorities \nOrganization  of  the  United  Nations  (FAO),  only  20%  of  Cambodia\u2019s  croplands  are  potentially \nirrigable  because  of  unfavorable  topography,  lack  of  a  water  source,  or  unsuitable  soil  types.2 \nThis  means  that  a  large  percentage  of  Cambodia\u2019s  croplands  will  remain  rain-fed.  Even  for \ncroplands that are irrigable, rainfall and stream flow are so variable from year to year that water \nfor supplementary irrigation3 may not be available when it is most needed. The critical time is at \nthe beginning of the growing season (April\u2013May) when the soil must be softened in readiness \nfor ground preparation and rice seedlings must be established. Other times are during the \u201csmall \ndry season\u201d which tends to occur in June\u2013July, and toward the end of the cropping cycle when \ngrain is filling out.  \n \n6. \nMOWRAM\u2019s hydrometeorological databases demonstrate that stream flow in Tonle Sap \nbasin  cannot  be  relied  on  for  supplementary  irrigation.  Consequently,  supplementary  irrigation \nsystems  dependent  on  run-of-river  water  supplies  may  be  of  little  help  at  critical  times.  Some \nform  of  storage\u2014with  volumes  sufficient  to  supply  water  during  the  relatively  short  critical \nperiods when rainfall and stream flow are insufficient\u2014is desirable. It is not necessary to rely on \nrivers  and  streams  as  sources  of  irrigation  water.  Indeed,  in  view  of  in-stream  values  (fish \nproduction,  navigation,  domestic  water  supply,  social  uses),  it  may  not  be  desirable.  People \nincreasingly  recognize  the  need  to  leave  sufficient  water  in  a  river  for  human  uses  other  than \nagriculture,  as  well  as  for  maintenance  of  aquatic  ecosystems  and  fisheries.  In  many  other \ncountries with unreliable rainfall, water harvesting is widely used to provide water for tree crops, \n\nfor  national  development.  However,  according \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n2 Source: www.fao.org/ag/agl/aglw/aquastat/cambodia/  accessed 15 August 2007. \n3   The greater part of irrigated cropland in Cambodia receives most of its water from rainfall and natural overland flow, \n\nand irrigation systems supply additional (supplementary) water to provide better growing conditions. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nThe National Strategy for Agriculture and Water, 2006\u20132010 \n\nvegetables,  other  high  value  crops,  home  gardens,  and  supplementary  irrigation. 4  Water \nharvesting  and  storage  has  been  widespread  in  Cambodia  in  the  past,  and  there  are  still \nthousands  of  ponds  throughout  the  country.5 However,  traditional  techniques  appear  to  have \nfallen into disuse, partly as a result of Khmer Rouge efforts to build standardized systems based \non diversion structures and distribution canals. \n \n7. \nAlthough  Cambodia  has  recently  returned  to  national  self-sufficiency  in  rice,  food \nsecurity is still a major issue for a large percentage of the population, particularly in Tonle Sap \nbasin. For many households\u2014those with small or no landholdings, infertile soils, or insufficient \nmoney to buy fertilizer and high quality seed\u2014their own production does not meet their needs \nfor  the  entire  year.  Their  hungry  season  may  last  for  some  months,  and  income-generating \nactivities are essential so that rice can be purchased. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nThe  NSDP  encourages  ministries  to  plan  in  a  sectoral  and  coordinated  manner.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  Strategic  Framework  for  Decentralization  and  Deconcentration  Reforms  also \npromotes  a  transfer  of  responsibilities  and  resources  to  subnational  levels.  During  the  coming \n5\u20136  years,  it  can  be  expected  to  radically  change  the  way  in  which  government  agencies \nfunction. The NDSP required that a Strategy for Agriculture and Water be developed by the end \nof 2006. \n \n9. \nDuring  2006,  a  task  force  of  the  Technical  Working  Group  on  Agriculture  and  Water \nworked on the Strategy on Agriculture and Water, which was expected to be signed off by the  \nMinistry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries  (MAFF)  and  MOWRAM  ministers  by  the  end  of \nthe  year.  The  goal  of  the  strategy  is  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction,  food  security,  and \neconomic growth by (i) enhancing agricultural productivity and diversification, and (ii) improving \nwater  resources  development  and  management.  This  will  be  achieved  principally  through \n(i) more efficient use and management of water and land, (ii) increased agricultural productivity, \nand (iii) enhanced agribusiness processes, (iv) institutional capacity building, and (v) improved \naccess  to  knowledge  and  technology.  The  specific  objectives  and  actions,  to  be  finalized  in \nearly 2007, will address the five types of capital already referred to above. Key components of \nthe strategy are pertinent to the proposed Project because they show the range of interventions \nthat could be considered. \n \nStrengthen  the  Enabling  Environment. The enabling environment for agriculture and \n10. \nwater \ninstitutional  capacity,  etc.  Ongoing \nincludes  relevant  policies, \nstrengthening is required, e.g., to develop MAFF and MOWRAM capacities to enforce laws and \nassociated  sub-decrees  related  to  water  use,  watershed  management,  and  other  natural \nresources. \n \n11.  Mobilize  Natural  Resources:  Water,  Land,  and  Soil.  The  strategy  will  include,  as \nexamples,  promoting  improved  crop  water  management  through  water  harvesting/storage, \ngravity-fed  irrigation  systems,  and  technology  such  as  drip  irrigation  of  vegetables;  promoting \nsoil fertility management; protecting water resources from pollution and degradation so that they \ncontinue to be available for fisheries, ecosystem maintenance, etc.; promoting rice field fisheries \nand  aquaculture;  and  promoting  settlement  of  cultivable  land  and  securing  land  ownership \nagainst land theft. \n                                                 \n4 Critchley,  W.  Siegert,  K.  And  Chapman,  C.  Finkel,  M.  1991.  Water  harvesting.  A  manual  for  the  design  and \n\nlaws/regulations, \n\nconstruction of water harvesting schemes for plant production. Rome: FAO. \n\n5   Rice  farmers  in  the  seasonally  flooded  area  around  Tonle  Sap  and  on  the  Mekong\u2013Tonle  Sap  floodplains  store \nfloodwater behind bunds. As water level drops, recession rice is planted on the newly exposed land, and the stored \nfloodwaters  are  progressively  released  to  provide  supplementary  irrigation  when  required.  This  technique  of \nsupplementary irrigation is in some respects more reliable, but enables farmers to encroach into the buffer zone. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n          Appendix 1 \n\n \n25\n\n \n12.  Mobilize  Human  and  Financial  Resources.  The  strategy  must  mobilize  and  make \nbetter  use  of  people  and  money,  including  as  examples  promoting  education,  training  and \nextension in agriculture and water, development of appropriate technology, more efficient use of \nskilled  people  such  as  extension  workers  and  engineers,  better  access  to  money  needed  for \ninvestment and operation and maintenance (O&M), greater engagement of the private sector in \nagriculture, and water management and agribusiness. \n \n13. \nEmpower  People  and  Communities. The strategy will seek to empower communities \nto  work  together  and  be  more  self-reliant.  This  includes,  as  examples,  establishing  and \nsupporting farmer water user committees; assisting farmers to establish cooperatives to market \ncrops and purchase inputs; promoting the availability of micro-credit and other funding sources \nto  allow  people  to  invest  in  crop  production  and  agribusiness  development;  and  encouraging \ncommunity  organizations  (commune  councils,  village  development  committees,  etc.,  with \naccess  to  Commune  Development  Funds)  to  participate  in  the  planning  and  operation  of \ncommunity  projects  for  water  supply,  water  management  infrastructure,  communal  rice  drying \nfacilities, etc. \n \n14. \nIncrease  Productivity  of  Agriculture.  This  element  of  the  strategy  aims  to  increase \nproduction, reduce production costs per unit of output, and assist in assuring product quality. It \nwill  help  to  achieve  increased  production  of  high  quality  products,  thus  achieving  both  food \nsecurity  and  commercial  goals.  Elements  of  the  strategy  will  include,  as  examples,  improving \nthe quality of inputs such as seeds and fertilizers; reducing harvesting and postharvest losses; \nand introducing innovative agricultural and water management practices.  \n \nExtend  Commercial  Agriculture.  The  strategy  will  assist  farmers  to  engage  in \n15. \ncommercial  production by,  as  examples,  providing  information  and  forecasts  regarding  market \ndemand;  promoting  new  product  opportunities;  establishing  value-added  processing  facilities; \nadministering arrangements for product quality assurance and food safety; and facilitating entry \ninto  profitable  markets,  particularly  via  improved  transport  and  storage  facilities,  marketing \ninfrastructure, bulking/wholesaling arrangements, etc. \n \nE. \n \nA livelihood includes the capabilities, assets, and activities required to maintain a means \n16. \nof living. A livelihood is sustainable when the assets on which it is based\u2014including human and \nnatural resources\u2014are not being diminished, and a household is able to absorb adversity such \nas  drought  or  illness  without  long-term  harm.  A  rapid  rural  appraisal  carried  out  in  2006  in \n32 selected  villages  of  the  six  provinces  confirmed  that  most  households  do  not  have \nsustainable  livelihoods,  and  are  vulnerable  to  shocks.6 Their  physical  resources  (land,  water, \nnatural  products)  and  human  resources  (skills,  knowledge,  and  healthy  labor)  are  insufficient \nand/or are deteriorating. A natural response by such a household is to exploit common property \nresources,  which  is  increasingly  leading  to  the  \u201ctragedy  of  the  commons\u201d  in  Tonle  Sap  basin. \nHence,  the  urgent  need  to  stabilize  and  then  improve  the  livelihoods  of  the  lowland \ncommunities. \n \n\nStabilizing Livelihoods \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2006. Rapid Rural Appraisal Summary Report. Manila. TA 4756-CAM consultants\u2019 report (unpublished). The \nrapid  rural  appraisal  concluded  that  91%  of  the  surveyed  households  cannot  rely  on  the  land  they  farm  and/or \nresources locally available to survive. In villages  with  reasonable access, up to 20% of households send at least \none member to find wage labor in nearby towns. The future of rural people around Tonle Sap will increasingly rely \non a prosperous urban sector. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nResources crucial to sustainable livelihoods for rural populations around Tonle Sap are \n17. \nas follows:7 (i) natural capital\u2014land, water, fish, and other living resources; (ii) human capital\u2014\nhealthy  and  strong  members  of  the  household,  with  the  skills  and  knowledge  necessary  to \nprovide  for  their  needs;  (iii)  financial  capital\u2014the  funds  needed  to  purchase  the  goods  and \nservices they are not able to provide (e.g., fertilizer, seeds, fuel) to cope with unforeseen events \n(e.g.,  ill  health,  marriages);  (iv)  social  capital\u2014the  community  relationships  and  institutions \nneeded  to  enable  cooperation  and  mutual  support;  and  (v)  physical  capital  or  infrastructure\u2014\nhousehold  equipment  (boats,  ploughs,  etc.)  and  facilities  (roads,  markets,  and  water \nmanagement facilities) that are of a public good nature, and must be provided by the community \nrather than the individual household. \n \n18. \nThe  rapid  rural  appraisal  found  that  villagers  ranked  the  top  10  livelihood  issues  as \nfollows:8 (i) water management for agriculture (30 villages); (ii) roads and bridges (28 villages); \n(iii)  health  and  hygiene  (28  villages);  (iv)  wells  and  drinking  water  (26  villages);  (v)  seeds, \nfertilizer,  pest  control,  farming  equipment  (21  villages);  (vi)  access  to  education;  (vii)  livestock \nservices (17 villages); (viii) off-farm income generation and training (16 villages); (ix) improved \nfisheries  management  (12  villages);  and  (x)  food  security  (10  villages).  Occupational  training, \nvillage  pond  water  supplies,  and  access  to  credit  were  ranked  slightly  lower.  These  results \nclearly  show  the  importance  of  physical  capital  (infrastructure  and  equipment),  human  capital \n(both health and knowledge), natural capital (especially water and fish), and financial capital (to \npurchase inputs and pay for health and other services). Social capital is not explicitly mentioned, \nbut is essential for the other issues to be addressed successfully.9 \n \n19. \nExternal  support  agencies  are  converging  on  a  model  of  rural/community  development \nthat provide a package of complementary interventions. Examples are the Northwestern Rural \nDevelopment  Project,  Tonle  Sap  Sustainable  Livelihoods  Project,  and  Area  Development \nProgram  approach  employed  by  World  Vision  Cambodia.10 A  strong  emphasis  is  placed  on \ncommunity  empowerment  (social  capital).  Capacity  building,  technical/vocational  training, \neducation  and  extension  services,  provision  of  credit,  etc.  (human  and  financial  capital)  are \nchanneled \nthrough  village  development  committees,  commune  councils,  and/or  other \ncommunity-based  organizations,  to  engage  communities  in  addressing  their  needs  for  natural \nand physical capital. \n \nF. \n \n20. \nAn  underlying  theme  of  the  Strategy  for  Agriculture  and  Water  is  that  increased \ninvolvement  in  the  cash  economy  is  essential  for  people  to  lift  themselves  out  of  poverty. \nSubsistence agriculture is not able to do so or even meet basic food security needs. The rural \n\nLink between Private Enterprise and Project Interventions \n\n                                                 \n7  A fuller description of the five types of capital is in Appendix 1 to ADB. 2005.

This \nmodel  is  a  single  stage,  single  envelope  model  with  postqualification.  In  each  province,  the \nresponsible implementing agency (IA) will submit the first draft English language version of the \nprocurement documents for the first works contract to ADB for review and approval regardless \nof  the  estimated  contract  amount.  For  subsequent  contracts,  ADB  will  review  the  documents \nafter  the  award.  ADB-approved  procurement  documents  will  be  used  as  a  model  for  all \nsucceeding NCB  contracts  financed  by  ADB  for  the  Project.  For  all  contracts,  ADB will  review \nthe bid evaluation report and proposal for award of contract on a prior review basis.  \n \n2. \nCommunity  Participation  in  Procurement.  Small-scale  works  contracts  under  the \nCommune  Development  Fund  (CDF),  with  a  maximum  value  of  $20,000,  may  be  awarded  to \ncommunity groups following procedures for community participation in procurement contained in \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  first  civil  works \ncontract in each commune will be subject to ADB approval. Subsequently, the Provincial Local \nAdministration Unit (PLAU) will maintain specified documents for review by ADB. Documents to \nbe  retained  include  the  commune  development  plan,  bid  invitation  letters,  bid  opening \nstatements,  bid  evaluation  reports  or  approval  documents,  and  signed  contracts  between  the \ncommune council and the contractors, where applicable. \n \n\nb. \n\nRecruitment of Consultants  \n\n \n3. \nFor  ADB-funded  contracts,  either  quality  and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  or \nindependent  consultant  selection  (ICS)  will  be  applied.  For  QCBS,  full  technical  proposals  will \nbe required. To calculate the firms\u2019 total scores, the technical proposals will be given a weight of \n80% and the financial proposals 20%. For recruitment of individual consultants recruited by the \nGovernment,  ICS  will  be  applied.  For  contracts  fully  funded  by  the  Government,  recruitment \ndocuments and procedures will follow government guidelines. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nTable A7: Proposed Detailed Contract Packages (greater than $100,000)a \n\n \n\n \n\nDescription \n \n\n1.

Financial \nand economic analyses were conducted to evaluate the viability of five core subprojects1 selected \nfor feasibility studies rather than for the whole Project (Supplementary Appendix K). The financial \nand  economic  analyses  of  core  subprojects  serve  dual  objectives:  (i)  as  a  representative \nevaluation  of  the  whole  Project\u2019s  economic  viability  and  financial  sustainability;  and  (ii)  more \nimportantly,  as  a  set  of  benchmarking  criteria  for  the  selection  of  future  subprojects  eligible  for \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing  as  far  as  financial  and  economic  aspects  are \nconcerned.  The  analyses  placed  more  emphasis  on  the  second  objective  because  only  when \nappropriate  subprojects  are  selected  will  the  whole  Project  become  financially  sustainable  and \neconomically viable. \n\n2. \nThe  financial  and  economic  analyses  were  consistent  with  relevant  ADB  guidelines, \nhandbooks, and technical notes.2 The analyses also incorporated best-practice dimensions in the \nfinancial and economic analyses of interventions in the livelihood sector. \n\n3. \nThe Project has an implementation period of 6 years (2008\u20132014) and the economic life of \nthe  project  interventions  has  been  assumed  to  be  20  years  (2008\u20132027).  For  the  present \nanalysis,  the  prevailing  interbank  exchange  rate  of  KR4,000  per  US  dollar3 has  been  used.  A \ndiscount rate of 12% has been used to estimate the net present value and serve as a cutoff point \nfor the economic internal rate of return (EIRR).  \n\nThe  economic  analysis  determined \n\nto  project \n4. \ninterventions  in  the  five  core  subprojects,  including:  (i)  benefits  from  an  expected  increase  in \nagricultural  production  (economic-converted  financial  revenue);  and  (ii)  realizable  cost  savings \ncaused  by  investment  in  new  infrastructure  and  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  existing  rural \ninfrastructure.  The  economic  viability  of  each  core  subproject  is  evaluated  against  standard \nbenchmarks  (i.e.,  EIRR  >12%,  benefit-cost  ratio  >1.0,  and  economic  net  present  value  (ENPV) \n>0). \n\nincremental  benefits  attributable \n\nFinancial  revenue  and  costs  were estimated  using  constant  2007  prices.  Financial  farm-\n5. \ngate prices are based on findings of the surveys undertaken by the PPTA team for the feasibility \nstudy during 2006. The analyses use a world price numeraire where economic prices for traded \ncrop  outputs  and  inputs  have  been  based  on  World  Bank  commodity  price  projections.  Labor \ncosts have been shadow-priced at 0.80 of the wage rates while other inputs have been adjusted \nby the standard conversion factor of 0.90 as applicable for Cambodia.  \n\n6. \nProject  investments  are  assumed  to  increase  productive  agricultural  areas  by  improved \nwater management and extension services, enabling increased cropping intensity in all terraces. \nTable A10.1 outlines the cropping intensity by core subproject and land category. The dry season \nirrigated  area  will  increase  from  effectively  zero  in  all  subprojects  to  6\u20139%  in  the  with-Project \nscenario. The cropping intensity for the rain-fed and supplementary irrigation areas also increases \n\n                                                 \n1 These are: (i) Ampil Tuek Commune, Kampong Tralach District, Kampong Chhnang Province; (ii) Pralay Commune, \nStoung District, Kampong Thom; (iii) Rumlech Commune, Banan District, Pursat Province; (iv) Srae Sdok Commune, \nKandieng District, Pursat Province; and (v) San Kor Commune, Kampong Svay District, Kampong Thom Province. \n2 Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  1997.

As a result, farm and household models were identified as possible livelihood \nmodels  (on-farm  and  off-farm)  to  assist  local  residents  in  target  areas  to  improve  their  living \nstandards.  Land-use  profiles\u2014classified  lowland  lower  terrace,  lowland  middle  terrace,  and \nlowland  upper  terrace\u2014were  used  to  identify  appropriate  on-farm  livelihood  models.  Survey \nresults  and  information  gathered  during  site  visits  were  used  to  determine  possible  off-farm \nlivelihood models.  \n\nIdentified  livelihood  models  (on-farm  and  off-farm)  were  analyzed  individually  to \n8. \n(i) simulate the future income-generating profile for the model owners/operators in the with- and \nwithout-Project scenario; and (ii) estimate incremental income attributable to project interventions. \nIt  is  assumed  that  all  investment  and  operating  costs,  as  well  as  the  associated  revenues \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n49 \n\ngenerated  by  these  models,  are  incremental  and  would  not  have  been  realized  without  the \nProject\u2019s interventions.  \n\n9. \nThe  livelihood  models  were  selected  as  representative  models  for  analysis  and \nrecommended for future implementation because (i) they are considered affordable to start with \nreasonable  capital  investments;  (ii)  they  are  easy  to  implement,  taking  into  account  local  skills, \nexpertise,  available  resources,  education  level,  and  farming  culture;  and  (iii)  more  importantly, \nthey have reasonable market demand for outputs.  \n\nThe list of livelihood models is not exhaustive and the mixture of livelihood models in each \n10. \ncore  subproject  may  not  be  identical  at  the  time  of  project  implementation.  Therefore,  further \nassessment needs to be made in close consultation with local residents to ensure that activities of \nhigh value added are selected for implementation by local households and microenterprises. This \nis  to  ensure  that  risks  of  inappropriateness  of  the  models  are  minimized  at  the  time  of  project \nimplementation.  \n\nB.  \n\nProject Benefits \n\n11. \nThe  Project\u2019s  goal  is  to  improve  livelihoods  in  three  provinces  (Kampong  Chhnang; \nKampong Thom; and Pursat) around Tonle Sap basin. Target rural communities will benefit from \nthe  improved  coverage  and  quality  of  rural  infrastructure  (irrigation,  roads,  village  level \npostharvest facilities, and markets) as well as new opportunities resulting from the application of \nnew  skills  in  the  pursuit  of  on-farm  and  off-farm  enterprises  to  improve  their  livelihoods.  In \nparticular,  target  rural  communities  will  benefit  from  (i) improved  rural  infrastructure,  including \nsocial infrastructure; (ii) rehabilitated and upgraded agriculture water management infrastructure \nand increased rice production and productivity, and reduced susceptibility to droughts and floods; \n(iii)  improvement  of  inter-village/commune  roads  and  road  links  to  main  provincial  and  national \nhighways; and (iv) increased income from the creation and development of diversified livelihood \noptions (i.e., on-farm and off-farm agricultural and nonagricultural income-generating activities). \n\nBeneficiaries.  The  five  core  subprojects  will  cover  a  population  of  about  60,000  people \n12. \n(11,000 households), 63% of which is categorized poor. The poverty incidence is the highest in \nthe  San  Kor  subproject  (76%),  and  the  Srae  Sdok  subproject  has  the  lowest  poverty  incidence \n(51%). However, all the five core subprojects selected have poverty ratios substantially above the \nnational  poverty  ratio  of  36%.  Table  A10.3  outlines  the  target  beneficiary  population  in  the  five \ncore  subprojects.  The  majority  of  the  target  beneficiaries  are  involved  in  agriculture  production \nand  local  small-scale  commercial  activities.  The  Project\u2019s  support  will  help  increase  cropping \nintensity  to  enable  local  residents  to  expand  agricultural  production  (rice  and  non-rice  crops), \nensure food security in the short term, and reduce poverty in the medium term. \n\nTable A10.3: Target Beneficiary Population \n\n \n\nPopulation \n\nPoverty Profile \n\nSubproject \n\n# Persons \n\n# Households \n\n# Poor Households \n\n% of Total \n\nAmpil Tuek Subproject \n\nPralay Subproject \n\nRumlech Subproject \n\nSrae Sdok Subproject \n\nSan Kor Subproject \n\n      Total (estimate) \n\n \n\nSources: Project preparatory technical assistance reports. \n\n12,370 \n\n12,634 \n\n  8,404 \n\n11,103 \n\n15,383 \n\n59,894 \n\n2,379 \n\n2,304 \n\n1,562 \n\n1,960 \n\n2,802 \n\n11,007 \n\n1,642 \n\n1,198 \n\n937 \n\n1,000 \n\n2,130 \n\n6,906 \n\n69 \n\n52 \n\n60 \n\n51 \n\n76 \n\n63 \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\n1. \n\nQuantifiable Benefits \n\n13. \nThe major benefits will be net incremental income from the livelihood models as a result of \nthe  Project\u2019s  effort  to  increase  the  cropping  intensities,  micro-credit  support,  and  extension \nservice  support  schemes.  Supplementary  Appendix  K  outlines  the  results  of  individual  model \nanalysis in each of the five core subprojects. The financial benefit stream is derived by estimating \nthe net incremental income for each representative livelihood model multiplied by (i) the projected \nland  area  in  case  the  model  involves  agriculture  production,  and  (ii)  the  number  of  model \nreplicators  in  case  the  model  involves  off-farm  activities  and  where  the  number  of  micro-  and \nhousehold  businesses  is  identifiable.  The  financial  benefit  stream 4 is  then  converted  into  the \neconomic benefit stream using the standard conversion factor. Annual household expenditure is \nestimated to increase by 26% from $300 to $378. \n\n14. \nProject  investment  in  new  infrastructure,  and  upgrading  and  rehabilitation  of  existing \ninfrastructure,  bring  about  a  wide  range  of  other  benefits  through  cost  savings.  The  economic \nanalysis quantifies the cost savings the Project is expected to generate. Numerous types of cost \nsavings are expected, including cost savings from cleaning up and damages after floods, travel \ntime/cost  savings  for  potable  water  (to  and  from  the  river/lake),  and  health  and  medical  cost \nsavings  (formal  and  informal  hospital  fees  and  medical  treatments).  These  benefits  from  cost \nsavings were estimated for three out of five core subprojects (Ampil Tuek, Pralay, and Rumlech) \nas  they  are  evident  from  the  scope  of  priority  infrastructure  investments.  For  Srae  Sdok  and \nSan Kor  subprojects,  the  target  population  will  probably  enjoy  these  benefits,  but  further \nassessment  will  be  needed  at  the  beginning  of  subproject  implementation  when  the  commune \npriorities are confirmed. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nNonquantifiable Benefits \n\n15. \nA  number  of  other  benefits  cannot  be  readily  quantified.  First,  food  poverty  is  a  critical \nproblem  in  the  majority  of  communes  around  Tonle  Sap  basin.  The  Project  will  contribute \nsignificantly to ensure food security and gradually eradicate food poverty. While benefits of food \npoor reduction can quantifiable, these benefits may also be attributed to factors other than project \ninterventions.  Second,  the  Project  will  help  build  capacity  for  local  stakeholders,  including \ncommune  councils  and  public  utility  entities  in  charge  of  irrigation,  roads,  and  other  rural \ninfrastructure. Benefits will mainly come from Project TA in planning, management, operation, and \nmaintenance of irrigation schemes, and social and technical infrastructure. Improved planning will \nbe  the  key  to  increase  efficiency  because  the  investment  in  fixed  assets  (infrastructure)  is \nnormally expensive. If investment is not well planned, the level of wastage may be expected to be \nvery high. Improvement in management of operation and maintenance (O&M) activities will also \ngenerate  benefits  from  annual  cost  savings  and  hence  reduce/minimize  government  budget \nrequirements and enable participatory O&M. \n\n16. \nThird,  in  addition  to  financial  benefits,  livelihood  improvement  activities  will  be  a  local \nforum  (commune  halls)5 for  farmers  to  exchanges  experience,  skills,  and  farming  techniques  to \nhelp  move  away  from  traditional  and  backward  farming  techniques.  This  forum,  together  with \nmicro-credit  and  savings  groups,  will  promote  local  savings  for  reinvestment  and  empower \nwomen\u2019s roles and positions in society. Fourth, school improvements (both new construction and \n                                                 \n4   The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  each  core  subproject  is  not  very  useful  in  the  context  where  the  mix  of \n\nlivelihood activities to be undertaken in each commune is highly uncertain. \n\n5 The Project may support upgrading of commune meeting halls if the commune is not included under the Commune \nCouncil Development Project (ADB. 2002.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors \non  a  Proposed  Loan  and  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Commune  Council \nDevelopment Project. Manila. (Grant 4007, for $3.0 million approved on 3 December). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n51 \n\nrehabilitation)  will  significantly  improve  the  teaching  and  learning  quality  of  commune  schools. \nIndirect  benefits  will  include  lower  dropouts,  increased  net  enrolment  rates,  and  an  increased \ntransition rate to lower and upper secondary schools. Fifth, the Project will contribute to increase \nawareness and change the mindsets of local people in natural resource protection.  \n\n17. \nSixth,  cost  savings  that  are  not  readily  quantifiable  include  travel  time  and  vehicle  cost \nsavings, transport services development at communes, increased utility of land frontages created \nby  improved  intervillage  and  inter-commune  roads,  and  road  links  to  provincial  and  national \nhighways. Cost savings may also occur from additional classrooms that may be constructed 6 in \nthe immediate neighborhood. By not having to travel to other villages or communes for schooling \nto  avoid  overcrowding,  children\u2019s  travel  time  is  saved,  and  parents  save  financial  contributions \n(formal and informal) to schools outside their home communes. \n\nC.  \n\nSummary Economic Analysis \n\nThe EIRR was calculated for the five core subprojects to determine their economic viability \n\n18. \nand serve as benchmarks for selection of subprojects at the time of project implementation.  \n\n19. \nThe  results  of  the  economic  analysis  for  the  five  core  subprojects  are  summarized  in \nTable  A10.4.  Base  case  EIRRs  range  between  19.0%  and  22.1%;  ENPVs  are  in  the  range  of \n$419,000  and  $520,000;  and  benefit-cost  ratios  are  estimated  at  1.49\u20131.70.  These  indicators \nsuggest  that,  other  things  being  equal,  all  five  core  subprojects  are  economically  viable,7 since \nEIRRs in base cases are well above the cutoff rate of 12%. As the economic analysis of the five \ncore  subprojects  serves  as  an  evaluation  of  the  whole  Project,  it  is  considered  economically \nviable  since  the  EIRRs  exceed  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  benefits  quantified. \nBesides quantifiable benefits, other social, environmental, and capacity building benefits have not \nbeen  quantified  because  of  measurement  difficulties  and  lack  of  data.  Therefore,  the  analyses \ncan be regarded as a conservative estimate of the overall benefits. \n\n20. \nSensitivity  analysis  was  undertaken  to  test  the  robustness  of  the  analysis  and  the \nconsequences of changes in the following (combinations of) variables: (i) capital cost increase by \n10%; (ii) O&M cost increase by 10%; (iii) benefit decrease by 10%; (iv) benefit delay of 2 years; \n(v)  benefit  delay  of  4  years;  (vi)  a  combination  of  capital  cost  increase  by  10%  and  O&M  costs \nincrease by 10%; and (vii) a combination of capital cost increase by 10%, O&M cost increase by \n10%,  and  benefit  decrease  by  10%.  The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  for  the  five  core \nsubprojects are summarized in Table A10.4. \n\n21. \nThe results of the sensitivity analysis show that all core subprojects under examination are \nhighly sensitive to delays in project implementation and hence realization of benefits, particularly \nwhen  benefits  delay  4  years  (Table  A10.4  \u201clow\u201d  column).  Field  experience  in  Cambodia  has \nrecorded  significant  delays  in  project  implementation  with  regard  to  livelihood  improvement \nprojects because of limited local capacity, delaying realization of benefits. As such, it is strongly \nrecommended that the project operating entities of the three project provinces pay due attention \nto capacity building for responsible staff and strictly follow the project implementation schedules. \nFactors delaying project implementation should be well under control and minimized to ensure the \nProject\u2019s  economic  viability.  Results  of  economic  and  sensitivity  analyses  for  each  core \nsubproject are outlined in Supplementary Appendix K. \n\n                                                 \n6 The proposed project plan will allow assistance for classroom construction, upgrading, and rehabilitation in communes \nnot  covered  by  the  Education  Sector  Development  Program.

The \nfollowing  beneficiaries  can  be  identified  in  the  Project:  (i)  micro-  and  household  enterprises  will \ngain because of positive net financial benefits from livelihood activities; (ii) the Government and/or \neconomy will benefit where financial costs exceed economic costs; (iii) labor will gain where the \nfinancial costs of labor exceed its opportunity costs, both in implementation and operation phases \nof  the  subproject;  and  (iv)  utility  services  (mainly  irrigation  services  entities)  will  lose  because \ndirect cost recovery from beneficiaries is lower than required.  \n\n23. \nDistribution of benefits and poverty impact analysis for the five core subprojects is in Table \nA10.5. Total net benefits are estimated at about $1.9 million. The proportion of benefits accruing \nto the poor is estimated at $771,000, producing an overall poverty impact ratio of 40.8% of total \nnet  benefits,  suggesting  the  Project  would  make  a  significant  contribution  to  local  poverty \nreduction.

In \npractice,  rural  livelihood  improvement  projects  often  support  capital  and  recurrent  cost  outlays, \nmaking the recurrent cost sustainability issue one of central importance in the economic analysis. \nThe  impact  on  the  overall  budget  after  the  Project  is  completed  often  determines  whether  the \nproject objectives will be sustained in the long run. Key issues to be addressed include the project \ninvestment\u2019s  impacts  on  fiscal  indicators  such  as  annual  state  budget  allocation,  capital \nreplacement, and recurrent expenditure for during and after the project implementation period.  \n\n25. \nTable A10.6 presents recurrent cost outlays estimated for the whole Project. The essential \npart  is  the  cost  to  finance  O&M  activities  to  be  borne  by  public  utility  entities  with  regard  to \nirrigation,  rural  water  and  sanitation,  and  other  civil  works.  When  the  project  implementation \nperiod is completed, the annual cost to be borne by public utility entities is estimated at $274,000 \nwhile  annual  cost  recovery  (mainly  from  the  irrigation  service  fee)  is  estimated  at  $114,000\u2014\nleaving  an  annual  deficit  of  $160,000  to  be  allocated  by  the  Government.  This  level  of \ngovernment  contribution  (subsidy)  is  considered  affordable  in  the  context  of  development  in \nCambodia.  However,  the  project  operating  entities  should  prepare  a  realistic  cost  recovery \nschedule bearing in mind that (i) the level of subsidies should be made in a transparent manner; \nand (ii) the more revenue collected via the user pays principle, the lower the subsidy required. \n\nTable A10.6: Summary Fiscal Impact Analysis \n\nItem/Year \n\nYear 1 \n\nYear 2 \n\nYear 3 \n\nYear 4 \n\nYear 5 \n\nYear 6 \n\nYear 7 \n\nYear 8 \n\n344,368 \n\n431,617 \n\n509,745 \n\n577,278 \n\n652,147 \n\n661,912 \n\n696,945 \n\n696,945 \n\n258 \n\n4,646 \n\n36,348 \n\n108,894 \n\n186,065 \n\n244,907 \n\n273,916 \n\n273,916 \n\n \n \n\nB.

Cambodia\u2019s  recent  growth  has  been  concentrated  in \nurban areas, and based around the garment and tourism sectors. Poverty in Cambodia remains predominantly rural, \nand the majority of the poor live in rural areas and rely on agriculture for their livelihoods. The poverty rate ranges \nfrom a low of 10\u201315% in Phnom Penh to 40\u201345% in rural areas, reaching 70\u201380% in some areas around Tonle Sap \nbasin. Against this background, the current Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program, 2005\u2013\n2009,  focuses  on  Tonle  Sap  Basin  to  support  poverty  reduction  in  one  of  the  poorest  and  most  environmentally \nsensitive regions of Cambodia.  \n  \nThe need for accelerating rural development to achieve poverty reduction is well recognized and is given priority in \nthe  (i)  Second  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDP  II),  2001\u20132005,  which  is  the  basis  of  the  Poverty \nReduction  Partnership  Agreement  between  the  Government  of  Cambodia  and  ADB,  2005;  (ii)  National  Poverty \nReduction  Strategy,  2003;  (iii)  Rectangular  Strategy  for  Growth,  Employment,  Equity  and  Efficiency,  2004;  and \n(iv) National  Strategic  Development  Plan  (NSDP),  2006,  which  replaces  the  Second  Socioeconomic  Development \nPlan  and  the  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy,  and  incorporates  long-term  targets  in  Cambodia\u2019s  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, 2003 (updated in 2005). The NSDP has six pillars: (i) good governance, (ii) environment for the \nimplementation of the Rectangular Strategy, (iii) enhancement of the agricultural sector, (iv) continued rehabilitation \nand construction of physical infrastructure, (v) private sector growth and employment, and (iv) capacity building and \nhuman  resources  development.  The  NSDP  places  particular  emphasis  on  agriculture,  rural  development,  and \ninfrastructure. According to its indicative budget allocation, the NDSP allocates over 20% to the agriculture and rural \ndevelopment sector and 60% to rural areas. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  decentralization  is  a  key  underlying  theme  of  the  above  strategies/policies.  An \nimportant feature of the Project will be increased alignment with the Strategic Framework for Decentralization and \nDeconcentration  Reforms,  2005,  which  aims  to  channel  a  substantial  amount  of  domestic  resources  and  external \naid  directly  to  support  newly  empowered  subnational  planning  and  budgeting  units.  The  framework  is  a  5-year \nnational  program  to  establish  institutional  capacity  at  provincial  level,  establishing  provincial/municipal  and  district \ncouncils,  and  channeling  development  spending  and  capacity  building  to  all  levels  of  the  subnational  governance \nsystem. In line with the objectives of harmonization and the Government\u2019s wish to empower communes to plan and \nimplement  subprojects,  in  collaboration  with  provincial  technical  departments,  the  implementation  structure  of  the \nProject will be fully consistent with the framework.  \n \nB. Poverty Analysis                                                Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe proposed Project is an integral part of the Tonle Sap Initiative, an integrated program of technical assistance \n(TA),  loan,  and  grant  projects  designed  to  assist  Cambodia  achieve  the  twin  goals  of  improving  the  lives  and \nlivelihoods of the population while protecting and conserving the unique biodiversity and environment of Tonle Sap.  \n \nThe  proposed  project  design  focuses  on  improving  the  livelihoods  options  for  households  inhabiting  the  lowland \narea stretching from the outer limit of the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve\u2019s buffer zone to the foothills of the upper \nwatershed  area.  It  will  target  40  poor  communes  on  the  Tonle  Sap  lowlandsa  in  the  three  lakeside  provinces  of \nKampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, and Pursat where about 38% of the population falls under the official poverty \nline\u2014the highest proportion in the country. Some 50% of villages in these provinces have 40\u201360% of households \nliving  below  the  poverty  line,  with  a  peak  of  80%  in  parts  of  Kampong  Chhnang.  Many  people  in  the  rural \ncommunities reviewed during the rapid rural appraisal and participatory rural appraisal were found to be extremely \npoor and vulnerable to shocks. On average, over 50% of rural people do not grow enough rice to meet their needs; \nof  these,  half  have  to  make  up  shortfalls  of  3  or  4  months\u2019  supply,  and  shortfalls  of  6  months  or  more  are  not \nuncommon  for  the  remainder.  They  are  also  vulnerable  to  a  variety  of  shocks:  seasonal  shortages  of  rainfall \n(especially at the beginning of the rainy season); seasonal shortages of water (especially drinking water during the \ndry season) and at the start and finish of both wet and dry rice crops; food shortages (especially shortfalls in the rice \nharvest caused by an unreliable supply of water); and seasonal trends that  work against them (such as having to \nsell rice immediately after the harvest on a buyers\u2019 market). \nThe Project will support community mobilization for formulation of development plans and implementation of small-\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n55 \n\nscale infrastructure (irrigation, roads, village level postharvest facilities, and markets). It will also increase options for \npeople to develop the necessary skills and access additional financial resources to enable pursuit of new livelihood \nactivities.  This  will  allow  them  to  increase  and  stabilize  rural  incomes,  and  reduce  the  need  for  people  to  migrate \ninto the buffer zone and lake during the dry season. The ability of people living in the lowland communes to improve \ntheir  livelihoods  is  constrained  by:  (i)  poor  rural  infrastructure;  and  (ii)  limited  knowledge  and  access  to  improved \ntechnologies  and  techniques.  The  Government  and  farmers  consider  improvements  to  agricultural  water \nmanagement systems crucial to increasing agricultural, primarily rice, production; reducing susceptibility to droughts \nand  floods;  ensuring  food  security;  and  enabling  agricultural  diversification.  Access  to  many  villages  is  difficult, \nparticularly  during  the  wet  season,  because  the  condition  of  rural  roads  is  poor.  Good  access  would  enable \ngovernment services to be delivered to rural communities, farmers to buy agricultural inputs and to market surplus \nproduce, and rural people to access health services, education, and other amenities more easily. Other small-scale \ninfrastructure (such as schools, village offices, village meeting halls, markets, produce stores, and crop processing \nand  packaging  facilities)  will  improve  the  standard  of  living,  support  local  livelihood  activities,  and  aid  community \ncohesion.  \n \nC. Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\nIs there a participation strategy? \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\nRural  infrastructure  needs  at  commune  and  village  level  will  be  identified  and  prioritized  through  the  five-step \nCommune/Sangkat  b  planning  process  currently  used  to  prepare  5-year  commune  development  plans  and  annual \ncommune investment plans. This is a participatory process that involves communities in identifying their needs; and \nprovides for their direct involvement in resource allocation, decision making, implementation, and monitoring at the \nlocal  level.  With  the  exception  of  larger  roads,  communities  will  also  have  ownership  of  completed  works,  and \nresponsibility  for  their  subsequent  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  Social  infrastructure  subprojects  seeking \nsupport from the Project will be identified by the commune council, included in the commune investment plan, and \nverified at the district integration workshop held in October each year. \n \nSupport  will  be  provided  to  ensure  full  participation  by  all  stakeholders  (including  intended  beneficiaries)  in  the \nplanning, design, implementation, and operation of subprojects. The Project will utilize commune council supporters \nrecruited  by  the  commune  councils  and  trained  by  the  Project  to  assist  commune  councils  in  designing  and \nmanaging interventions funded through the Commune Development Fund (CDF). Commune council supporters are \nexpected to be the primary liaison with government departments within the province, facilitating their involvement in \nadvisory TA to the commune councils, village committees, and farmer water user committees (FWUCs).  \n \nD. Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen in the project area are very vulnerable. They have less access to land ownership and other property rights, \ncredit, paid employment, education, and health services. They also have few opportunities for self-development or \nparticipation in community decision making since Khmer tradition ascribes a passive role to women. Nevertheless, \nthe gender division of labor is changing overall: women and men play progressively interchangeable roles because \nwomen are increasingly called upon to meet all household needs as men migrate for paid employment.  \n \nThere are also many displaced or disabled persons, who suffer from poverty and other forms of social deprivation \nmore  than  the  rest  of  the  population.  At  present,  only  about  3\u20135%  of  women  participate  in  the  committee  farmer \nwater user group (FWUG). The Ministry  of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) is promoting  women's \nparticipation in decision-making bodies at commune level to about 10% by 2010.  \n \nA gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared to ensure gender equality in the distribution of project benefits and \nto  enable  active  engagement  by  women  in  subproject  design  and  implementation.  The  implementation \narrangements and estimated costs of the GAP have been incorporated into the overall project design and costing. \nThe implementation schedule of the GAP will be in line with overall implementation of the Project.   \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n \n \n\n  Yes\n  No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nE.

Significant resettlement impacts \nare  not  expected  by  agricultural  water  management \ninfrastructure  and  rural  roads  and  communication \ninfrastructure (less than $100,000 per project) because \nthe  majority  will  be  improved  along  existing  rights-of-\nway  and  will  require,  if  any,  the  acquisition  of  minor \namounts of land plus compensation for roadside trees, \ncrops, or small buildings. A short resettlement plan will \nbe prepared for each subproject has a land acquisition \nthe \nand  resettlement \nresettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix H). \nFor  improvement  of  agricultural  water  management \ninfrastructure,  farmers  will  be  expected  to  contribute \n15%  of  the  cost  of  scheme  development,  in  labor  for \non-farm  works  digging  field  and  farm  channels,  and \nO&M.  For  rural  roads,  where  a  commune  expresses \nwillingness  to  undertake  maintenance,  the  Project  will \nassist  commune  councils \nroad \nmaintenance  committees,  and  provide  a  basic  set  of \nto  establish \nroad  maintenance \nmechanisms  to  raise  funds  for  routine  maintenance \nlocally.  Communities  are  not  expected  to  contribute  to \nthe cost of construction, as it is difficult to establish the \nidentity of the users. \nNo  adverse  impact  is  anticipated.  The  Project  will \ncreate  employment  opportunities  in  construction  and \nmaintenance,  mainly  for  poor  unskilled  laborers  (35% \nof  paid  unskilled  laborers  will  be  women),  and  ensure \nthat  equal  pay  for  women  and  men  for  work  of  equal \nvalue and all labor laws and regulations are adhered to \nby all subproject contractors (see Affordability).  \nThe Cham is the major group of non-Khmer living in the \nproject  target  districts  and  communes.

It was endorsed by the Government and guides the preparation of resettlement \nplans, if required during project implementation. In all instances where subprojects require land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  the  provisions  and  principles  adopted  in  the  resettlement \nframework for the Project will supersede the provisions of relevant decrees currently in force in \nCambodia wherever a gap exists between government laws and regulations and ADB policies. \n\nThe  entitlement  matrix  (Supplementary  Appendix  M)  summarizes  the  main  types  of \n3. \nlosses  and  the  corresponding  nature  and  scope  of  entitlement.  The  extent  of  impact  on \nvulnerable  groups\u2014including  poor  households,  ethnic  minority  groups, \nfemale-headed \nhouseholds,  landless  households,  disabled-headed  households,  and  elderly  people  without \nsupport structures\u2014will be determined during subproject preparation. The Project will pay due \nattention so that those vulnerable people will become subproject beneficiaries.   \n\nC. \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n4. \n The Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM), the Executing Agency \n(EA),  through  its  project  management  office  (PMO),  will  assure  overall  planning,  coordination, \nand reporting of this resettlement framework. The EA will guide, support, endorse, and monitor \nthe work of the provincial resettlement subcommittee (PRS) in six participating provinces under \nthe  guidance  from  the  inter-ministerial  resettlement  committee.  A  PRS1 will  be  established  in \neach of the three project target provinces. \n\n                                                 \n1  Membership will include directors of provincial departments involved in the project (provincial departments of water  \nresources  and  meteorology,  rural  development,  and  environment,)  and  a  permanent  deputy  from  target  districts \n(district governors or deputy district governors).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n59 \n\nIn  each  province,  the  Provincial  Department  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology \n5. \n(PDWRAM)  and  Provincial  Department  of  Rural  Development  (PDRD)  will  appoint  a \nresettlement focal point with responsibility to screen resettlement impact. The resettlement focal \npoint, under guidance from the provincial resettlement subcommittee, will recruit contractors to \nprepare subproject resettlement plans. In each of the 40 target project communes, a commune \nland  acquisition  committee  (CLAC) 2  will  be  established,  which  will  (i)  confirm  that  no \nresettlement impact is foreseen in subprojects prepared under Commune Development Funds; \nand (ii) assist the resettlement focal point to consult, disclose, and monitor resettlement plans at \ncommune/village level.  \n\nPreparation and Implementation of Resettlement Plans \n\nSubproject screening will be undertaken through the following steps:  \n\nD. \n\n6. \n\n(i) \n\nIn \n\nfunds). \n\n(commune \n\nlivelihoods \n\ninfrastructure \n\nSocial \nthe  commune \ninvestment  plans,  the  commune  council  will  confirm\u2014based  on  the  technical \noption selected on the preliminary subproject design and subproject categorization \nform\u2014that  the  subproject  falls  under  category  C  (no  resettlement  impact).  The \nresettlement  impact  categorization  form  must  be  attached  to  the  commune \ninvestment plan. The commune council chief has to certify that new facilities would \nbe  constructed  on  unused  public  lands.  In  case  it  is  decided  that  the  subproject \nwould only require voluntary donation from the commune and/or any individual and \nnot  require  involuntary  resettlement,  the  commune  council  chief  also  has  to \ndescribe  safeguard  measures  in  the  commune  investment  plan.  For  category  B \nsubprojects, follow the procedure in para. 7. \n\n(ii)  Water  management \n\ninfrastructure/rural \n\nroads  and  communication \ninfrastructure.  Based  on  the  technical  option  selected  and  the  preliminary \nsubproject  design,  the  subproject  falls  under  either  category  B  (not  significant \nresettlement  impact)  or  C.  The  provincial  level  units  PDWRAM  and  PDRD  will \nscreen subprojects under this component and ensure that only subprojects whose \nresettlement  impacts  remain  within  the  limits  of  a  category  B  subproject  will  be \nfinanced by the Project.  \n\n7. \nIn  each  province,  resettlement  planning  for  all  subprojects  under  category  B  that  are \nprepared  at  the  same  time  will  be  consolidated  into  a  single  commune  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  plan  (LARP)  prepared  by  the  PDWRAM  and  PDRD  with  assistance  from  the \nresettlement specialists and CLACs under the guidance of MOWRAM and PRS. The procedure \nfor preparation, finalization, and approval is as follows. \n\n(i)  PRS will recruit a professional appraiser to conduct a replacement cost survey in the \nsubproject  areas  once  a  year,  to  determine  current  market  prices  for  agricultural, \nresidential, and commercial land; different types of structures; and crops and trees.  \n\n(ii) \n\nIn line with subproject (under Components 1 and 2) planning, the resettlement focal \npoint  from  the  PDWRAM  and  PDRD  with  assistance  from  resettlement  specialists \n(consultants), CLAC and village representatives under the guidance of PRS, will (a) \nundertake  a  census  of  all  affected  persons;  (b)  conduct  a  detailed  measurement \nsurvey  following  the  detailed  design  of  the  subproject  and  demarcation  of  land \n\n                                                 \n2  Membership of the commune land acquisition committee will include district, commune, and village representatives; \nrepresentatives of affected persons for subprojects; and a resettlement focal point from each implementing agency. \nTo  address  issues  of  vulnerable  affected  persons  adequately,  membership  of  the  committee  will  include  female \nand, as relevant, ethnic minority representatives. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nacquisition requirements; and (c) undertake a socioeconomic survey of at least 10% \nof all affected persons, and 20% of severely affected persons.  \n\n(iii)  Following the detailed measurement survey/socioeconomic survey or in conjunction \nwith  it,  the  resettlement  focal  point  from  the  PDWRAM  and  PDRD,  assisted  by \nresettlement  specialists,  will  prepare  a  draft  commune  LARP,  and  compensation \nrates  and  amounts  from  the  replacement  cost  survey.  The  official  lists  of  affected \npersons, their losses, and compensation and assistance amounts will be appended \nto  the  draft  commune  LARP.  If  the  subproject  will  not  require  involuntary \nresettlement, a voluntary land donation report will be prepared and information will \nbe included in the commune LARP.  \n\n(iv)  The draft commune LARP will be presented to affected persons by the PDRAM and \nPDRD  and  other  stakeholders  in  public  meetings  in  villages  and  communes  in  the \nsubproject  areas.  Affected  persons  will  be  encouraged  to  raise  issues  and  make \nsuggestions about land acquisition requirements, compensation rates and amounts, \nand  other  aspects  of  resettlement  activities.  Copies  of  the  draft  commune  LARP \nand/or  summary  brochures  will  be  available  during  these  consultations.  The  draft \ncommune LARP will be made available to affected persons at village and commune \noffices in target communes.  \n\n(v)  The PDRAM and PDRD, assisted by resettlement specialists, will prepare the final \ncommune  LARP,  incorporating  comments  from  affected  persons  and  other \ndocuments;  and  submit  it  for  review  and  approval  to  the  provincial  rural \ndevelopment  committee  and  PRS/interministerial  resettlement  committee  (IRC).  At \nthis stage, the PDRAM and PDRD or MOWRAM may consolidate several commune \nLARP into one provincial LARP to facilitate the review. MOWRAM and the PRS/IRC \nwill  submit  the  commune  or  provincial  LARP  to  IRC  and  ADB  for  review  and \napproval.  The  commune  or  provincial  LARP  will  be  disclosed  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005) to the affected communities and on the \nADB website after it has been approved. \n\n(vi)  Land  acquisition,  compensation,  and  relocation  of  affected  persons  cannot \ncommence  until  the  LARP  has  been  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  IRC,  and \napproval or no objection given by ADB. All resettlement activities will be coordinated \nwith  the civil  works  schedule.  Civil works  contractors  will  not  be issued  a  notice of \npossession  of  the  site  until  (a)  compensation  and  relocation  of  affected  persons \nhave been satisfactorily completed, (b) agreed rehabilitation assistance is in place, \nand (c) the site is free of all encumbrances. \n\nE. \n\nConsultation, Grievance Redress, and Disclosure \n\n8. \nConsultation with affected persons will take place from the subproject preparation stage, \nand will be completed prior to finalization of detailed designs and resettlement plan so that their \nneeds  and  preferences  can  be  incorporated  into  the  design  arrangements  where  practicable. \nThey will also participate in the various resettlement plan processes, including preparation of the \ninventory of losses, validation of compensation rates and entitlements, handover of entitlements, \nmonitoring of impacts and benefits, and discussion and settlement of grievances.  \n\nTo  ensure  that  all  grievances  of  those  affected  on  any  aspect  of  land  acquisition, \n9. \ncompensation,  relocation,  and  determination  and  payment  of  entitlements  are  resolved  in  a \ntimely  and  satisfactory  manner,  and  that  all  avenues  for  airing  grievances  are  available,  the \nProject will set up a mechanism to deal with any such grievances during project implementation. \nThe  affected  individuals  will  be  made  fully  aware  of  their  rights  (both  verbally  and  in  writing) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n61 \n\nduring  consultations  and  at  each  phase  of  the  resettlement  process.  Detailed  procedures  for \nhearing and redressing grievances, including appeal processes, will be made public through an \neffective  public  information  campaign.  The  CLAC  will  record  and  report  on  all  complaints  and \ntheir  resolution.  The  independent  monitoring  agency  will  be  responsible  for  checking  the \nprocedures for and resolutions of grievances and complaints. \n\n10. \nThe  EA,  assisted  by  the  CLAC,  will  disclose  (i)  draft  resettlement  plans  prior  to \nsubmission for review and approval by ADB; (ii) final resettlement plans approved by ADB, and \n(iii)  any  revisions  to  the  resettlement  plans  as  a  result  of  changes  in  scope  or  design  layout. \nFinal and revised resettlement plans will be posted on ADB\u2019s website following ADB approval. \nKey information in the resettlement plans, including compensation and rehabilitation options, will \nbe  disclosed  to  those  affected  before  commencement  of  civil  works.  The  information  will  be \nmade publicly available in a readily accessible location such as village and commune halls and \nbe  in  the  form  of  an  information  leaflet  or  brochure\u2014all  in  a  form  and  language  that  can  be \nreadily understood by those affected.  \n\nF. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe  resettlement  focal  point  from  the  PDWRAM  and  provincial  rural  development \n11. \ncommittee,  assisted  by  consultants  and  CLACs,  will  supervise \nthe  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  the  subproject  resettlement  plan  and  will  monitor  and  report  on  all \nresettlement activities. The EA will consolidate all provincial reports into the project performance \nmonitoring  system,  which  will  be  used  to  prepare  regular  progress  reports  for  submission  to \nADB.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  will  focus  on  social  impacts  and  whether  the  people  affected \nare able to restore, and preferably improve on, their pre-project living standards, incomes, and \nproductive capacity. \n\n12. \nThe  EA  will  recruit  an  independent  monitoring  organization  to  conduct  external \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of  resettlement,  focusing  on  the  social  impacts  of  the  Project  and \nwhether  affected  persons  are  able  to  restore,  and  preferably  improve,  their  pre-project  living \nstandards,  incomes,  and  productive  capacity  about  12  months  after  compensation  and \nrelocation  are  completed.  All  independent  monitoring  organization  reports  will  be  submitted  to \nADB. \n\nG. \n\nBudget \n\n13. \nAll  compensation  for  land  and  other  affected  assets  will  be  paid  at  replacement  cost \nbased  on  current  market  prices.  Compensation  rates  will  be  established  for  each  project \nprovince  and  approved  by  the  PRS  at  replacement  cost  based  on  market  prices  during  the \nreplacement  cost  survey.  All  costs  for  subproject  resettlement  programs  under  the  Project, \nincluding  compensation  and  allowances,  operation  and  administration  costs,  surveys, \nmonitoring, and reporting will be financed by grant funds, with the exception of land acquisition. \nIf ADB funds are utilized, the resettlement plans will identify key activities for which the funds will \nbe used, any disbursal milestones, and auditing requirements that will facilitate appropriate and \ntimely delivery. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n\n \n1. \nIn Cambodia, women play vital roles in the economic activities of rural households. They \ncontribute significantly to the agricultural labor force, estimated to represent about 74% of male \nand  77%  of  female  employment,  mainly  in  rice  production  and  fishery.  They  also  engage  in  a \nwide range of livelihood activities, typically including collecting firewood for sale, running small \nbusinesses, and raising and selling livestock, which contribute to household income. In addition, \nwomen  are  predominately  responsible  for  domestic  chores  such  as  cooking,  taking  care  of \nchildren, and fetching water and fuel often from great distances. \n \n2. \nDespite  women\u2019s  high  contribution  to  household  income,  there  is  a  continuing  gender \ninequality  in  their  access  to  paid  employment,  financial  capital,  and  skills  training.  Women\u2019s \nparticipation  in  community  decision  making  is  also  limited  as  Khmer  tradition  (Chbap  Srey) \nascribes  a  passive  role  to  women.  At  present,  only  about  3\u20135%  of  members  of  farmer  water \nuser group (FWUG) committees are female. The Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology \n(MOWRAM)  is  attempting  to  increase  women\u2019s  participation  in  decision-making  bodies  at \ncommune level to about 10% by 2010. \n \n3. \nPoverty  in  the  project  area  has  strong  gender  dimensions.  In  the  project  target \ncommunes, the proportion of female-headed households ranges from 8% to 36% based on data \nfrom  the  2005  Commune  Database.  Female-headed  households  are  poorer\u2014they  constitute \n41%  of  the  poor  and  32%  of  the  poorest  wealth  categories  compared  with  18%  of  rich \nhouseholds  and  24%  of  middle  wealth  households.  The  Tonle  Sap  participatory  poverty \nassessment also indicates that they are more vulnerable to external shocks and social stigma \nbecause of the lack of male labor in the household.   \n \n4. \nThis  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  has  been  prepared  to  ensure  gender  equality  in  the \ndistribution of project benefits and to enable active engagement by women in subproject design \nand implementation. Gender responsive interventions will be selected to respond to the specific \nneeds of women in the project area. The implementation arrangements and estimated costs of \nthe GAP have been incorporated in the overall project design and costing. The implementation \nschedule  of  the  GAP  will  be  in  line  with  the  overall  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  key \nprinciples underlining the GAP are as follows.  \n \n\n(i)  Subproject  preparation.  The  Project  will  engage  both  female  and  male  commune \nfacilitators  to  the  extent  possible.  Separate  meetings  for  men  and  women  will  be  held \nduring subproject preparation so that women will be fully informed about the Project and \ncan  express  their  needs  and  preferred  technical  options.  Women  will  be  consulted \nbefore  deciding  on  infrastructure  locations  and  design.  The  Project  will  recruit  an \ninternational  community  development  specialist  (6  person-months,  intermittent)  with \ngender  background  and  expertise  to  ensure  that  this  GAP  will  be  appropriately \nimplemented by commune facilitators. \n\n(ii)  Subproject  implementation.  The  Project  will  engage  female  trainers  to  the  extent \npossible.  During  subproject  construction,  the  Project  will  also  hire  women,  particularly \nfemale-headed  households  and  poor  women  (at  least  35%  of  unskilled  laborers  on \nproject investments are expected to be women because men migrate to work outside the \ncommunes),  and  ensure  equal  pay  for  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  The \nProject will work to increase the participation of women in commune decision making: a \nminimum of 30% female representation in all commune committees and groups will be \ntargeted in project communes.  \n\n(iii)  Training. The Project will recruit a national gender specialist (12 months, intermittent) so \nthat gender sensitization and training in gender-sensitive design will be provided during \n\n \n\n\f                                 Appendix 13       63 \n\nproject  orientation  in  the  inception  phase  for  all  levels  of  project  staff,  implementation \nconsultants,  contractors,  commune \nfacilitators,  commune  councilors,  and  other \nstakeholders in order to emphasize the link between the GAP and project performance. \nThe  sessions  on  gender  analysis  and  gender-sensitive  monitoring  indicators  will  be \nincluded  in  project  management  training  for  project  staff  and  commune  councilors  to \npromote  gender-responsive  subproject  preparation,  implementation,  monitoring,  and \nreporting. \n\n(iv)  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Gender-disaggregated  data  will  be  collected  during \nsubproject  preparatory  surveys  (e.g.,  baseline  survey  and  household  surveys). \nSubproject  feasibility  studies  will  include  gender-disaggregated  and/or  gender-specific \ntargets  and  indicators,  and  those  indicators  will  be  monitored  and  reported  in  project \nquarterly  progress  monitoring  reports.  MOWRAM\u2019s  Gender  Unit  will  be  involved  during \nproject  review  missions.
