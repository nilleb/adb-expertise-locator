The  loans  will  be  used\nas  lines  of  credit  for  directing  housing  finance  to  low-\nincome  households  through  different  lending  channels,\nand \nreduction\nfinancing  housing-related  poverty \nsubprojects.

Although \u201cshelter for all\u201d is the overarching goal of\nthe  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan,  this  was  not  achieved  by  2000\nand  will  not  be  achieved  by  the  end  of  the  Ninth  Plan\nperiod in 2002. Since over 90 percent of the housing need\nis  from  low-income  families,  these  families  are  most\ndirectly impacted by unacceptable living standards and the\npoor  quality  of  life  in  all  of  India\u2019s  urban  centers.  Lack  of\nbasic  services  such  as  water  supply,  drainage,  sanitation,\nand  electricity  also  negatively  impact  the  productivity  and\nincomes of poor households, especially those who work in\ntheir homes.\n\n\fiii\n\nSince the major source of housing finance for low-income\nhouseholds is their own meager savings and family assets,\nthe principal constraint to the ability of low-income families\nto  improve  their  housing  and  living  conditions  is  the\nabsence of affordable credit for housing. Although various\nCFIs  and  NGOs  have  assisted  low-income  families  to\nmobilize  their  savings  and  have  extended  loans  for\nhousing  construction  and  improvement,  these  efforts  are\nextremely  small  when  compared  with  the  total  housing\nfinance  demand  of \nlow-income  households.  Project\nresources  will  therefore  be  focused  on  assisting  poor\nfamilies with one or more income earners to gain access to\nhousing  finance  from  formal  and  informal  housing  finance\ninstitutions,  especially  CFIs  and  NGOs.  In  doing  so,  the\nProject  will  promote  market-based  lending,  as  these\nfamilies  would  otherwise  have  to  pay  higher  than  market\ninterest  rates  to  money  lenders  to  access  small  housing\nloans.  For  the  poorest  families,  the  Project  will  support\nsubprojects such as slum networking and home workplace\nschemes \nincome  earning\nto \ninfrastructure  and\npotential,  and  access \ncommunity services.\n\ntheir  housing, \nto  basic \n\nimprove \n\nThe objectives of the Project are to (i) increase access of\nlow-income  households  to  market-based  housing  finance\nby increasing and broadening the finance channels of both\ninformal  and  formal  housing  finance  institutions  (HFIs);\n(ii) reduce poverty by improving infrastructure and services\nlow-income\nfinancing \nin  slum  areas,  and \nlending\nhousing  subprojects;  and \noperations  of  housing \nto\ninclude  a  greater  proportion  of  loans  to  low-income\nhouseholds.

Project preparatory TA1 was approved\nin  November  1999  with  the  objective  of  identifying  sustainable,  market-based  channels  and\ninstitutional  arrangements  for  the  delivery  of  housing  finance  to  meet  the  borrowing  needs  of\nlow-income  households.  The  loan  Fact-finding  Mission  visited  India  in  April  2000  and  the\nAppraisal  Mission2  in  June  2000.  The  missions  reviewed  the  results  and  recommendations  of\nthe  project  feasibility  study  with  the  Government,  bilateral  funding  agencies,  housing  finance\nlow-income\ninstitutions,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  community  groups,  and \nbeneficiaries,  and  reached  an  understanding  on \nfinancing,\nimplementation  arrangements,  and  policy  reform  initiatives.  This  report  is  based  on  these\ndiscussions and the reports prepared by the TA consultants. The project framework is shown in\nAppendix 1.\n\nthe  project  scope,  cost, \n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1.\n\nHousing Situation\n\n \n3.\nRapid  population  growth  coupled  with  rapidly  increasing  urbanization  and  widespread\npoverty  have  created  a  serious  shelter  problem  in  India,  contributing  to  the  proliferation  of\nslums, increased demand for urban infrastructure and services, and declining quality of life for\nlow-income  households.  Additional  key  factors  that  have  aggravated  India\u2019s  critical  housing\nsituation  include  institutional  deficiencies,  especially  among  state  and  local  housing  agencies,\nand regulatory constraints to new housing development and investment such as the Urban Land\nCeiling (and Regulation) Act of 1976 and the state rent control acts. In terms of the magnitude\nof India\u2019s housing shortage, the demand-supply gap in 1991 was 31 million units, according to a\nstudy  prepared  by  the  National  Building  Organization.3  Urban  areas  account  for  about  30\npercent of the shortage. Although reliable statistical data on the existing housing deficit are not\nreadily  available,  the  study  concluded  that  the  annual  demand  for  housing  across  the  country\nwas about 4.5 million units, whereas the annual supply was about 3.5 million units. Based on a\nnet increase of housing demand of 1 million units per year since 1991, today\u2019s housing shortage\nis estimated to be as high as 40 million units. While these estimates suggest that more than 200\nmillion  people  across  India  are  living  in  abject  housing  conditions  or  on  the  streets,  millions\nmore are without decent, safe, and affordable housing.\n\n                                                \n 1 TA 3288 IND: Housing Finance II, for $405,000, approved on 8 November 1999.\n2  The Mission comprised J. Lynch, Urban Development Specialist and Mission Leader; A. Goswami, Counsel; and V.\n\nV. Subramanian, Investment Officer.\n\n 3 National Building Organization. 1997. Prominent Facts on Housing. New Delhi.\n\n\f2\n\n4.\nOne  critical  indication  of  the  housing  shortage  in  urban  areas  is  the  proliferation  of\nslums. In the 23 Indian cities with populations in excess of 1 million, approximately 28 percent of\nthe  urban  population  live  in  slums.  Since  1981,  the  slum  population  has  been  increasing  at  a\nrate  of  about  7  percent  per  year,  more  than  twice  as  high  as  the  average  annual  urban\npopulation  growth  rate  over  the  same  period.  The  health  and  environmental  implications  of\nhouseholds\u2019 lack of access to potable water, sanitation facilities, adequate drainage, and proper\nsolid  waste  collection  and  disposal  services  are  overwhelming,  especially  for  women  and\nchildren who spend proportionally more time at home than men. It is estimated that upward of\n25  percent  of  slum  residents  are  home-based  workers,  mostly  women.  For  these  families,\naccess  to  decent  living  conditions  and  basic  urban  infrastructure  and  services  is  extremely\nimportant, as they are primary factors of production as well as productivity.\n \n5.\nIn terms of investment requirements to meet India\u2019s housing shortage, the 33 million unit\ntarget  of  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan  (1997-2002)  was  estimated  to  require  over  Rs1,500  billion\n($37.5  billion).  However,  not  more  than  25  percent  of  funding  required  to  meet  India\u2019s\nstaggering  housing  deficit  is  expected  to  flow  from  formal  sources  such  as  banks;  financial\nlocal\ninstitutions;  government-directed \ngovernments.4 With the exception of government-sponsored housing programs, formal housing\nfinance  institutions  (HFIs)5  are  reluctant  to  lend  to  low-income  households  because  of  factors\nsuch as the relatively high transaction and servicing costs, irregular and unsubstantiated income\nsources,  and  the  absence  of  collateral  in  the  form  of  title  to  real  property.  Consequently,  the\nremaining  funding  requirements  will  derive  from  informal  sources  that  largely  consist  of\nindividual  efforts  with  the  help  of  community-based  financial  institutions  (CFIs),6  NGOs,\nemployer  financing,  and  moneylenders.  Since  most  of  the  housing  needs  of  the  middle-  and\nupper-income groups will be met through more formal channels, the shortfalls of the Ninth Plan\nwill  mainly  impact  low-income  households.  Therefore,  increasing  funding  through  the  informal\nsector is an essential and integral means to meet the housing needs of low-income families in\nIndia.\n\ninsurance  companies;  and  central,  state,  and \n\n2.\n\nHousing Finance\n\n \n6.\nThe  formal  housing  finance  sector  in  India  had  its  beginnings  in  the  1960s  when  the\nGovernment,  through  its  various  schemes  for  public  and  low-cost  housing,  was  the  sole\nprovider of housing finance. The Government implemented many of its schemes through state\nhousing boards that allocated serviced land and housing to individuals based on social welfare\nobjectives, not commercial considerations. The 1970s marked two significant developments in\nthe  housing  finance  sector.  A  public  sector  housing  company,  HUDCO,  was  established  in\n1970,  and  the  first  private  housing  finance  company  (HFC),7  HDFC,  was  established  in  1977.\nHUDCO served as the principal institution to finance Government-supported housing programs,\nwhereas  HDFC  introduced  mortgage  financing  to  India  and  has  become  the  largest  and  most\nsuccessful HFC in the country.\n \n7.\nThe late 1980s heralded a number of important events, beginning with the formation of\nNHB in 1988 as an apex bank for housing finance. NHB\u2019s responsibilities include establishing\n\n                                                \n 4 Government of India. 1998. National Housing and Habitat Policy. Ministry of Urban Affairs and Employment, New\n\n 5 HFIs include any organization, public or private, that is established with the primary intention of facilitating housing\n\n 6 CFIs are registered or unregistered agencies involved in savings and credit activities with direct participation and\n\ncontrol by a community, such as a neighborhood or a common occupation or place of employment.\n\n 7 HFCs  are  public  or  private  sector  nonbank  finance  companies  with  the  primary  objective  of  providing  housing\n\nDelhi.\n\nfinance.\n\nfinance.\n\n\f3\n\nguidelines  for  HFIs  to  ensure  sound  financial  management,  refinancing  mortgage  loans  made\nby  qualified  HFIs,  and  mobilizing  formal  sector  resources  into  housing  finance.  The  draft\nNational Housing Policy (NHP), calling for the removal of many legal and regulatory constraints\nin  the  housing  sector,  was  also  tabled  in  Parliament  in  1988,  and  ultimately  adopted  in  1994.\nAlso  in  the  late  1980s,  the  Government  directed  insurance  companies,  commercial  banks,\nprovident funds, and other agencies to invest a part of their incremental resources in housing.\nBased on the success of HDFC, a number of new HFCs were subsequently established during\nthe 1980s to enter into the mortgage lending market.\n \nThe 1990s witnessed significant changes in housing policy starting with the NHP, which\n8.\nenvisaged the Government\u2019s role as a facilitator of housing activity, rather than one of provider;\nthis position was reiterated and elaborated in the National Housing and Habitat Policy (NHHP)\nof  1998.  As  a  result,  Government  contributions  to  housing  finance  have  fallen  to  less  than  9\npercent, compared with 23 percent four decades ago. The liberalization of the financial sector\nhas  also  accounted  for  an  increase  in  mortgage  lending  by  formal  finance  institutions  not\ntraditionally  in  the  housing  sector,  most  notably  commercial  banks  and  nonbank  financial\ninstitutions. Based on data from the National Sample Survey Organization, however, the share\nof  formal  sector  housing  finance  varies  from  only  about  22  percent  for  new  houses  in  urban\nareas to less than 8 percent for additions and alterations in rural areas. By comparison, informal\nsources  contribute  as  much  as  79  percent  of  the  finance  for  new  construction  in  urban  areas\nand 88 percent in rural areas. Another important event in the late 1990s, which has significant\nimplications for the future development of India\u2019s housing finance sector, was the structuring of\na pilot mortgage securitization issue that is expected to raise about Rs600 million ($14 million).\n\nDespite the relatively recent and rapid evolution of the formal housing finance sector in\n9.\nIndia,  the  informal  sector  continues  to  play  a  significant  and  sustained  role  in  the  provision  of\nhousing finance, particularly to low-income households. Although the informal sector accounts\nfor more than 80 percent of housing finance in India, its unregulated nature makes it difficult to\nascertain  how  much  comes  from  household  savings  versus  loans  from  different  sources  such\nas  family  members,  friends,  employers,  suppliers\u2019  credits,  moneylenders,  CFIs,  and  NGOs.\nSurveys suggest that household savings, including incremental stockpiling of building materials,\nrepresent  the  principal  means  by  which  low-income  households  finance  housing  construction\nand improvements. Besides loans from family members and friends, the most preferred source\nof credit is from CFIs, including self-help groups and NGOs. Interest rates from these sources\nrange from 15 to 18 percent per annum for loans up to five years, which are significantly lower\nthan  rates  charged  by  moneylenders  who  charge  5  to  10  percent  per  month.  Borrowing  from\nreputable  CFIs  and  NGOs  also  provides  low-income  households  with  the  means  to  establish\ncredit  as  well  as  open  savings  accounts.  The  majority  of  CFIs  are  commercially  viable  and\nfinancially  sustainable,  achieving  high  rates  of  cost  recovery  in  the  upper  90th  percentiles,\nlargely due to community and peer group pressure, as well as the borrower\u2019s desire to access\nadditional  credit  in  the  future.  However,  CFIs  and  NGOs  suffer  from  a  problem  also  faced  by\ntheir borrowers: lack of access to sustainable, longer-term sources of credit for relending as well\nas  expanding  their  operations.  The  roles  and  responsibilities  of  key  participants  in  housing\nfinance,  and  the  organization  and  functioning  of  the  housing  market  in  India  are  described  in\nAppendix 2.\n \nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\nIndia  has  traditionally  assigned  a  relatively  low  priority  to  housing  finance  in  policy\n10.\nformulation  compared  with  other  sectors.  Housing  finance  constitutes  a  small  percentage  of\ngross  domestic  product  and  the  share  of  mortgage  finance  in  total  housing  investment  is\nestimated to be only about 10 percent. However, the 1994 NHP marked a significant transition\n\n\f4\n\nin  the  Government\u2019s  position  on  housing  policy  by  stressing  the  importance  of  housing  as  an\nintegral  part  of  the  national  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  and  employment  generation  in  the\ncontext  of  overall  economic  development.  It  advocated  increased  participation  by  the  private\nsector  and  emphasized  that  the  role  of  government  agencies  was  to  create  conditions  for  the\nexpansion  of  housing  supply  by  removing  legal  and  regulatory  constraints  and  supporting\nappropriate infrastructure investments. The policy also recognized the need for the continuation\nof  Government-supported  programs  for  vulnerable  sections  of  society.  In  accordance  with  the\nincreased  priority  for  housing,  the  Government  formulated  the  NHHP  in  1998  to  promote  the\ncreation  of  an  enabling  environment  and  to  encourage  the  nongovernment  sector  to  take  up\nland assembly, housing development, and infrastructure investments. The central theme of the\nNHHP  is  the  development  of  strong  public-private  partnerships  for  tackling  housing  and\ninfrastructure  problems.  In  emphasizing  an  enabling  environment,  the  role  of  Government  is\ndefined to provide fiscal concessions and to carry out legal and regulatory reforms. For housing\nschemes,  the  policy  marks  a  shift  away  from  purely  subsidized  schemes  to  schemes  where\ncosts can be recovered with minimal subsidies. The policy also emphasizes the importance of\nsecuritization in the development of a dynamic and sustainable housing finance system in India.\n\n11.\nBased  on  the  NHHP,  a  number  of  housing  investment  incentives  were  provided  in  the\ncentral  budgets  of  1998/99  and  1999/2000:  (i)  deductions  for  interest  on  housing  loans  were\nraised from Rs30,000 to Rs100,000; (ii) commercial banks were required to invest 3 percent of\nincremental  deposits  in  housing  versus  1.5  percent  previously;  (iii)  company  depreciation\nallowances were raised from 20 percent  to 40 percent on new housing stock provided to their\nemployees;  and  (iv)  foreclosure  and  transfer  of  property  laws  were  amended  to  facilitate  the\nforeclosure  of  mortgages.  In  addition,  the  targets  of  the  Ninth  Plan  were  modified  in  the  final\nplan  document  to  include  a  special  action  plan  for  the  construction  of  2  million  housing  units\n(700,000 in urban areas) annually over five years. The overall housing target of 10 million units,\nincluding  3.5  million  units  in  urban  areas,  over  the  NHHP  period,  however,  falls  far  short  of\nmeeting the total estimated housing shortage of 40 million units.\n\n12.\nRecent  Government  actions  are  indicative  of  the  steps  being  taken  implement  policy\nreforms in line with the continuing policy dialogue with the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The\nUrban Land Ceiling (and Regulation) Act has been repealed at the central level allowing states\nto repeal the act within their respective jurisdictions. Parliament has passed amendments to the\nNHB  Act  to  enable  registered  HFIs  to  foreclose  on  defaulting  loans.  Several  states  have\ninitiated  actions  to  amend  their  rent  control  acts  in  line  with  model  legislation  prepared  by  the\ncentral Government. NHB has expanded the national housing finance system by increasing the\nnumber of HFCs eligible for refinancing from 26 to 29. NHB is also in the process of launching\nthe  first  pilot  issue  of  mortgage-backed  securities  (MBS),  the  initial  step  in  establishing  a\nsecondary mortgage market.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n13.\nExternal assistance to India\u2019s housing sector is summarized in Appendix 3. In addition to\nADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  sector,  external  assistance  has  come  from  Germany,  Japan,\nNetherlands,  United  Kingdom,  United  States,  and  the  World  Bank.  Germany  has  extended\nseveral  lines  of  credit  through  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW)  to  HUDCO  and  HDFC  for\nlow-income  housing  schemes  and  the  establishment  of  rural  building  centers  throughout  the\ncountry. The United Kingdom has extended grant assistance for habitat improvement projects in\nsix  cities  nationwide.  Under  its  Housing  Guarantee  Program,  the  United  States  Agency  for\nInternational  Development  (USAID)  began  lending  to  HDFC  in  1983  to  help  HDFC  expand  its\noperations as the first private sector housing finance organization in India. USAID also entered\ninto  an  agreement  with  NHB  under  which  NHB  borrowed  $25  million  of  an  authorized  $40\n\n\f5\n\nmillion  to  expand  its  refinancing  operations.  In  addition,  the  USAID  Housing  Finance  System\nExpansion  Program  from  1992  to  1996  laid  the  groundwork  for  establishing  financial  linkages\nbetween  formal  and  informal  housing  finance  institutions  by  assessing  the  housing  finance\noperations of key CFIs and NGOs in the country.\n\nAlthough  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  India\u2019s  housing  sector  has  been  relatively  recent,  it  is\n14.\nnow  the  major  international  lender  in  the  sector  and  plays  a  leading  role  in  supporting  the\nGovernment\u2019s  policy  and  institutional  reform  agenda.  ADB\u2019s  first  loan  for  housing  was  a  $20\nmillion line of credit to HDFC under the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Project,8\nwhich targeted lending for low-income housing and slum improvement schemes. ADB has also\nsupported  two  TAs  for  capacity  building:  Strengthening  Housing  Finance  Institutions9  and  the\nongoing  Restructuring  State  Level  Housing  Finance  Institutions.10  The  Housing  Finance\nProject11 (HFP) represented a major intervention in the sector by supporting (i) lending to HFIs,\nHFCs,  CFIs,  and  households;  (ii)  lending  for  slum  improvement  and  low-  income  subprojects;\nand  (iii)  expanding  the  national  housing  finance  system  by  injecting  equity  and  debt  capital  to\nstrengthen existing HFCs and establish new ones. The HFP was implemented through a $100\nmillion line of credit for each of the three Borrowers: HUDCO, NHB, and HDFC. The HFP was\nextremely  fast  disbursing  in  that,  after  taking  the  first  drawdown  in  December  1997,  all  three\nBorrowers had completely drawn down their loans by December 1999.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n15.\nThe  HFP  provided  many  lessons,  which  serve  as  the  foundation  for  the  proposed\nProject as well as ADB\u2019s future role in the sector. First, the HFP highlighted the importance of\nestablishing  minimum  onlending  targets  for  each  of  the  different  lending  channels  and\nsubprojects.  The  fast-disbursing  nature  of  the  HFP  is  largely  attributed  to  the  Borrowers\nonlending  funds  through  more  traditional  or  familiar  channels  rather  than  adopting  innovative\nlending  schemes  that  require  more  time  for  project  design,  appraisal,  and  implementation.\nSecond,  the  channeling  of  funds  from  HFCs  to  CFIs  was  not  a  preferred  lending  modality  for\nHFCs,  as  HFCs  were  unfamiliar  with  CFIs  and  such  loans  often  need  to  be  reported  as\n\u201cunsecured\u201d  on  HFCs\u2019  balance  sheets  due  to  the  absence  of  collateral.  This  experience\nsuggests  that  a  specialized  HFI  with  a  social  mandate,  such  as  HUDCO,  is  best  suited  to\ndownmarket  housing  finance  through  CFIs.  Third,  the  HFP  did  not  stipulate  that  the  proceeds\nfrom  the  repayments  of  loans  financed  with  project  proceeds  should  be  re-lent  for  similar\npurposes;  such  a  stipulation  could  have  increased  the  multiplier  effect  of  targeted  lending.\nFourth, required Borrower contributions were not clearly defined to ensure maximum leveraging\nof ADB funds. Fifth, most lending for slum networking and low-income housing subprojects were\nsimply directed to state slum improvement and housing boards, thereby mitigating the need for\nthe Borrowers to appraise subprojects and monitor the use of funds. Sixth, many of the policy\nreform  measures  under  the  HFP  were  not  within  the  purview  of  the  three  Borrowers;  this\nhighlights  the  need  to  ensure  that  recommended  policy  reforms  can  be  undertaken  or\nimplemented  by  the  borrowing  institutions.  Lastly,  the  HFP  permitted  50  percent  of  the  loan\nproceeds  to  be  lent  to  middle-  and  upper-income  households.  The  rapid  disbursement  rate  of\nthe  HFP  and  the  removal  of  Government-defined  interest  rate  ceilings  for  different  loan  sizes\nsuggests  that  financially  viable  and  sustainable  lending  programs  targeted  entirely  to  low-\nincome households can be supported.\n\n                                                \n8 Loan  1415/1416-IND:  Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Project,  for  $105  million,  approved  on  14\n\nDecember 1995.\n\n9 TA 2833-IND: Strengthening Housing Finance Institutions, for $600,000, approved on 24 July 1997.\n10 TA 3067-IND: Restructuring State Level Housing Institutions, for $500,000, approved on 11 September 1997.\n11 Loan 1549/1550/1551-IND: Housing Finance Project, for $300 million, approved on 25 September 1997.\n\n\fE. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n6\n\n16.\nIn  India,  ADB\u2019s  overall  strategic  focus  is  to  assist  the  Government  in  achieving  its\nobjectives  of  increasing  employment  and  reducing  poverty  by  supporting  improved  economic\nefficiency  and  higher  levels  of  sustainable  economic  growth.  This  is  to  be  achieved  through\nsupport  for  structural  reforms,  promotion  of  increased  competition  and  greater  private  sector\nparticipation, development of a supportive regulatory environment, strengthening of institutional\ncapacities,  and  enhancing  resource  mobilization  through  financial  sector  and  capital  market\nreforms.\n\n17.\nADB is integrating social welfare concerns into its strategy, with particular emphasis on\npoverty reduction, by supporting the development of urban infrastructure, including the provision\nfor  housing  finance,  and  developing  sustainable  mechanisms  for  the  financing  and  delivery  of\nessential  social  services  at  the  municipal  level.  ADB\u2019s  Urban  Sector  Strategy12  for  India  is\ndefined  according  to  the  two  urban  subsectors  of  infrastructure  and  housing.  For  housing,\nADB's  strategic  goals  in  India  are  to  (i)  strengthen  linkages  between  formal  and  informal\nhousing finance as a means to increase the availability and affordability of housing loans to low-\nincome  households;  (ii)  promote  microcredit  programs  for  housing  loans  and  home-based,\nincome-generating  activities,  and  support  low-income  shelter  schemes;  and  (iii)  provide\ntechnical  advice  and  expertise  in  the  establishment  of  a  secondary  mortgage  market  as  a\nmeans to increase the availability of capital for housing finance.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nADB, through its lending and TA program, has been engaged in policy dialogue with the\n18.\nGovernment on a wide range of issues in the housing and financial sectors.13 Under the HFP,\nthe  policy  dialogue  focused  on  (i)  removing  major  legal  and  regulatory  impediments  to\ndeveloping  a  sustainable  housing  sector;  (ii)  promoting  greater  cost  recovery  and  community\nparticipation  for  slum  improvement  and  low-income  housing  subprojects;  (iii)  strengthening\nfinancial  management  capacities  of  state-level  housing  institutions;  (iv)  supporting  market-\nbased  lending  to  low-income  households;  and  (v)  expanding  the  national  housing  finance\nsystem. Throughout implementation of the HFP and support for related TA activities, ADB has\ncontinued  in  its  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  and  progress  has  been  made  in  several\nkey areas.\n\n19.\nThe  existing  situation  and  agreed  upon  policy  reform  measures  to  be  linked  to  the\nProject  are  presented  in  a  time-bound  action  plan  contained  in  Appendix  4,  the  Policy  and\nInstitutional Action Plan. The plan incorporates reforms that focus on establishing a conducive\nenvironment  for  housing  investment,  setting  up  appropriate  and  sustainable  mechanisms  for\nhousing  finance,  and  strengthening  institutional  capacities  of  formal  and  informal  sector  HFIs.\nSome  reforms  require  support  from  institutions  other  than  the  Borrowers.  For  such  cases,  the\nGovernment as Guarantor of the loan will be responsible for supporting the reforms. The critical\nissues,  which  form  the  basis  of  the  ongoing  and  long-term  policy  dialogue  between    ADB,\nBorrowers, and Government, are summarized in the following sections.\n\n                                                \n12 Asian Development Bank. 1998. India: Urban Sector Strategy. Manila.\n13  ADB\u2019s  support  for  developing  India\u2019s  capital  markets  through  Loan  1408-IND:  Capital Market Development\nProgram, for $250 million, approved on 25 November 1995;  and  TA 3473-IND: Development of Secondary Debt\nMarket,  for  $600,000,  approved  on  28  July  2000  are  also  directly  relevant  to  the  housing  sector,  particularly  in\naddressing the legal, regulatory, and financial reforms required for the securitization of home mortgages.\n\n\f1.\n\nLegislative and Regulatory Reforms\n\n7\n\n20.\nSince approval of the HFP in 1997, the Government has initiated a number of important\nlegislative  and  policy  reform  measures,  many  of  which  are  designed  to  remove  constraints  to\nincreased private sector investment in India's housing sector. Parliamentary approval of the Bill\nto  Amend  the  NHB  Act  in  May  2000  represents  significant  legislative  reform,  which  clarifies\nforeclosure  provisions  and  authorizes  the  NHB  to  play  a  major  role  in  promoting  mortgage\nsecuritization.  In  January  1999,  the  Government  repealed  the  Urban  Land  Ceiling  (and\nRegulation) Act of 1976, which served as a key impediment to private development of land in\nurban areas; several states are now taking steps to pass separate legislation repealing the act\nin  their  respective  jurisdictions.  In  an  effort  to  address  the  negative  effects  of  India's  Rent\nControl  Act  on  the  development  of  new  housing  and  maintenance  of  existing  units,  the\nGovernment has also prepared model rent control legislation that exempts new rental units from\nrent controls, permits rent revisions based on market trends, and expedites the judicial process\nfor  settling  disputes.  Several  states  and  union  territories  are  preparing  new  legislation  in  line\nwith the model act.\n\n2.\n\nSubsidized Housing Schemes\n\n21.\nUp  to  now  the  Government  has  maintained  the  policy  of  heavily  subsidizing  slum\nimprovement  and  low-income  housing  projects  implemented  through  state  slum  improvement\nboards, state housing boards, and municipal corporations. This is also the case for housing loan\nschemes to low-income families. These highly subsidized schemes have increased the burden\non  state  finances  and  have  hindered  the  development  of  sustainable  slum  improvement\nsubprojects. Given the poor condition of state finances, many states are becoming reluctant to\nissue loan guarantees and are instead issuing comfort letters.  From a financial perspective, this\nshift suggests that more rigorous project appraisal and due diligence criteria must be applied to\nproposed subprojects so that they are structured to ensure adequate levels of cost recovery.\n\n3.\n\nMarket-Based Lending Rates\n\nAt present HUDCO lending to economically weaker section (EWS)14 households is at a\n22.\nGovernment-mandated  ceiling  of  10.5  percent.  ADB  has  continually  emphasized  the  need  to\nrationalize  HUDCO\u2019s  interest  rates  to  better  align  them  with  the  market.  This  effort  has  been\nsupported  by  KfW,  which  has  stressed  the  importance  of  raising  interest  rates  to  minimize\nsubsidies as well as market distortions. HUDCO agrees that rates should be increased, but the\nEWS  lending  rate  is  set  by  an  empowered  committee  of  the  Government.  Based  on  its  policy\nobjective of minimizing subsidies in the sector, ADB will continue to discuss this issue with the\nGovernment so that HUDCO\u2019s EWS lending rate could, over time, move toward market levels.\nSimilarly, onlending of funds to CFIs should be market-based to minimize market distortions and\npromote long-term financial viability and sustainability of these financial intermediaries.\n\n                                                \n14 For  purposes  of  designating  beneficiaries  of  housing  and  related  poverty  reduction  assistance,  the  Government\nclassifies households according to income levels. EWS households represent the poorest of the poor with monthly\nincomes less than Rs2,500 ($65).\n\n\f4.\n\nRole of State and Local Housing Agencies\n\n8\n\n23.\nAlthough  central  Government  policy  has  become  more  amenable  to  the  needs  of  low-\nincome  households,  state  and  local  housing  agencies  such  as  state  housing  boards,  slum\nimprovement boards, and municipal urban development authorities, continue to be major public\nproviders of housing. To this extent, they have not assumed the role of facilitator as called for in\nthe  NHP  or  the  NHHP.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the  traditional  role  of  these  agencies  as  public\nhousing developers, the substantial number of employees involved, and the lack of institutional\nwill  and  capacity  to  change.  As  part  of  the  Restructuring  State  Level  Housing  Institutions  TA,\nADB  is  providing  capacity-building  assistance  to  state  housing  boards  in  Gujarat,  Kerala,\nMadhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal. The transition of the housing sector from one\nthat  is  highly  regulated  to  an  increasingly  market-oriented  one  will  pose  significant  challenges\nfor these agencies. Their operational and financial performance in an environment of increasing\ncompetition will determine whether they will survive in their present form.\n\n5.\n\nExpanding the Capital Market for Housing Finance\n\n24.\nAfter a great deal of effort by NHB and HDFC, the mechanics of mortgage securitization\nare being tried out through the first pilot issue of MBS. Although securitization is one of the best\nways to raise capital and manage the risks of fixed-rate lending, its viability depends primarily\non  the  cost  of  shedding  various  risks,  including  credit,  liquidity,  interest  rate,  and  prepayment\ncompared with other forms of debt and equity fund-raising. As major financial institutions such\nas  ICICI  enter  the  housing  finance  market,  ADB  will  continue  to  emphasize  the  issues  of  risk\nmanagement and the potential role of mortgage securitization in expanding the capital market\nfor housing finance.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n25.\nIn  spite  of  the  recent  liberalization  of  the  financial  sector  and  associated  policy  and\nregulatory  reforms  to  promote  increased  private  sector  participation  in  housing  finance  and\ndevelopment,  the  housing  shortage  in  India  remains  critical,  especially  for  low-income\nhouseholds.  Although  \u201cshelter  for  all\u201d  is  the  overarching  goal  of  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan,  this\nhas not been achieved by 2000 and will not be achieved by the end of the Ninth Plan period in\n2002. Since over 90 percent of the housing need is that of low-income families, these families\nare the ones who are most directly impacted by low living standards and poor quality of life in all\nof India\u2019s urban centers, as well as its small towns and villages. Lack of basic services, such as\nwater  supply,  drainage,  sanitation,  and  electricity,  also  impacts  negatively  on  the  productivity\nand incomes of poor households, especially those who work in their homes.\n\n26.\nSince  the  major  source  of  housing  finance  for  low-income  households  is  their  own\nmeager savings and family assets, the principal constraint to improving housing conditions for\nthese  families  is  their  lack  of  access  to  market-based  housing  finance.  Although  various  CFIs\nand  NGOs  have  helped  low-income  families  to  mobilize  their  savings  and  extended  loans  for\nhousing construction and improvement, these efforts are extremely small when compared with\nthe  total  housing  finance  demand  of  low-income  households.  Based  on  international\nexperience,  it  has  been  found  that  once  low-income  families  obtain  sufficient  income,  their\nhighest  priority  becomes  improving  their  house  or  building  a  new  one.  Project  resources  will,\ntherefore,  be  focused  on  assisting  poor  families  with  one  or  more  income  earners  to  gain\naccess to housing finance from formal and informal housing finance institutions, especially CFIs\nand NGOs. In doing so, the Project will promote market-based lending, as these families would\n\n\f9\n\notherwise have to pay higher than market interest rates to access housing finance. It must be\nacknowledged,  however,  that  the  poorest  families,  which  do  not  have  sufficient  incomes  to\nafford  even  small  housing  loans,  need  targeted,  subsidized  assistance  to  improve  their  living\nconditions.  For  the  poorest  families,  the  Project  will  support  subprojects  such  as  slum\nnetworking  and  home  workplace  schemes  to  improve  their  housing,  income-earning  potential,\nand access to basic infrastructure and services.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nThe objectives of the Project are to (i) increase the access of low-income households to\n27.\nmarket-based  housing  finance  by  increasing  and  broadening  the  finance  channels  of  both\ninformal  and  formal  HFIs;  (ii)  reduce  poverty  by  improving  infrastructure  and  services  in  slum\nareas  and  financing  innovative  low-income  housing  subprojects;  and  (iii)  expand  the  lending\noperations  of  HFCs  to  include  a  greater  proportion  of  loans  to  low-income  households.  The\noverall thrust of the Project is to promote market-based lending without subsidies, and the target\nbeneficiary  group  is  low-income  households.15  In  relation  to  the  Government's  classification  of\nhouseholds by income levels, low-income households encompass the EWS, low-income group\nhouseholds,  and  the  lower  one  third  of  middle-income  group  households.  A  profile  of  low-\nincome households based on income levels is presented in Appendix 5. Unlike under the HFP,\nthe proposed Project will not provide for lending to higher income groups.\n\n28.\nThe design of the Project draws upon many of the lessons learned under the HFP and\nresponds  to  the  rapid  policy  and  institutional  changes  taking  place  in  India\u2019s  housing  finance\nsector. First, the lending channels have been clearly defined and the respective loan allocations\nalso  represent  lending  targets  to  be  achieved  during  implementation.  Second,  recent\nexperience  has  demonstrated  the  financial  viability  of  CFI  lending  and  the  Reserve  Bank  of\nIndia is strongly encouraging formal HFIs to increase the flow of microcredit for housing. Third,\nthe  Project  will  maximize  the  leveraging  impact  of  ADB  funds  by  (i)  requiring  that  Borrowers\nmake  contributions  from  their  own  sources  to  support  different  lending  modalities;  and  (ii)\nstipulating that subloan repayments, net of ADB loan repayments, be re-lent or recycled through\nthe same lending channels and to the same beneficiary group(s) over the life of the ADB loan.\nFourth,  lending  for  slum  networking  and  low-income  housing  subprojects  will  not  be  through\nslum  improvement  boards,  but  will  be  based  on  detailed  subproject  appraisals  and  include\ninnovative  partnership  arrangements  with  CFIs,  NGOs,  municipal  corporations,  private\nenterprises,  and  slum  residents,  Fifth,  the  policy  reform  initiatives  are  within  the  scope  and\npurview  of  the  Borrowers  and  not  government  institutions  with  no  direct  role  in  the  Project.\nFinally,  all  lending  will  be  directed  to  low-income  households  and  no  funds  will  flow  to  higher\nincome households.\n\n29.\nThe  Project  consists  of  three  parts:  part  A:  lending  to  low-income  households  through\nintermediaries such as CFIs, NGOs, public and private enterprises, and state and local bodies;\npart B: reducing poverty through slum networking and home workplace subprojects; and part C:\nincreasing lending to low-income households through formal HFIs. The four primary Borrowers\ninclude  HUDCO,  NHB,  HDFC,  and  ICICI.  A  description  of  the  three  project  parts,  their\nrespective  mechanisms  for  the  delivery  of  housing  finance,  and  the  relationships  of  the\nBorrowers, the intermediaries or subborrowers, and low-income beneficiaries follows.\n\n                                                \n15 Low-income  households  are  defined  as  households  with  monthly  incomes  of  Rs7,000  (about  $165)  or  less.  This\n\ndefinition is approximately equivalent to an income of $1/capita/day at current exchange rates (Appendix 5).\n\n\f10\n\n1.\n\nPart A: Lending to Low-Income Households through Intermediaries\n\n30.\nGiven  the  limited  availability  of  housing  finance  through  formal  HFIs,  intermediaries\nrepresent  important  and  viable  conduits  for  responding  to  the  housing  finance  needs  of  low-\nincome  households.  By  promoting  and  establishing  linkages  between  formal  HFIs  and\nintermediaries,  such  intermediaries  can  onlend  funds  to  low-income  households  for  housing\npurposes. Experience has demonstrated that the intermediaries\u2019 onlending modalities are best\nsuited  to  meet  the  special  needs  and  economic  situations  of  low-income  households,  namely\nsmall,  short-term  housing  construction,  extension,  and  improvement  loans  that  do  not  always\nrequire collateral in the form of clear title to real property. The three categories of intermediaries\nthat will serve as the primary onlenders to low-income households under part A of the Project\ninclude (i) CFIs and NGOs, (ii) public and private enterprises, and (iii) state and local bodies. To\nincrease  the  lending  impact  on  low-income  households,  the  Project  will  provide  that  all\nrepayments  under  each  component  will  be  re-lent  to  households  in  the  same  income  group\nthrough  similar  intermediaries  over  the  life  of  the  ADB  loan.  Additionally,  to  maximize  the\nleveraging of ADB funds and to promote own-source contributions on behalf of the Borrowers,\nADB will finance 80 percent of all lending to public and private enterprises and state and local\nbodies; ADB will finance 100 percent of all lending to CFIs and NGOs.\n\na.\n\nCommunity Finance Institutions and NGOs\n\n31.\nThis  component  will  improve  access  by  low-income  households  to  housing  finance  by\nexpanding the volume of lending to CFIs and NGOs to onlend to low-income households. More\nthan  100  CFIs  and  NGOs  have  been  identified  as  potential  subborrowers  under  the  Project,\nincluding the Self Employed Women\u2019s Association, Society for Integral Development Action, Sri\nPadmavathy  Mahila  Abyudaya  Sangam,  Society  for  Promotion  of  Area  Resource  Centre,  and\nFriends of Women\u2019s World Banking. CFIs exclude state apex cooperative housing federations,\nstate  agricultural  rural  development  banks,  and  state  cooperative  banks.  Eligibility  criteria  for\nsubborrowers  under  this  component,  to  be  applied  by  the  participating  Borrowers,  will  include\ntheir \ntechnical  expertise,  outreach  potential,\nknowledge of target communities, reputation, and loan repayment track record.\n\nlending  experience,  operational  capacity, \n\nLending  under  this  component,  as  well  as  under  the  remaining  components  of  Part  A,\n32.\nwill  be  market-based  to  ensure  commercial  viability.  The  participating  Borrowers,  namely\nHUDCO,  HDFC,  and  ICICI,  will  onlend  funds  to  eligible  CFIs  and  NGOs  at  interest  rates  that\ninclude  a  spread  to  cover  their  loan  processing  expenses  and  a  risk  premium,  based  on  an\nassessment of the credit rating of the recipient CFI or NGO.  Likewise, the CFIs and NGOs will\nprovide  housing  loans  to  eligible  low-income  households  at  interest  rates  that  include  an\nadditional  spread  for  the  CFIs  or  NGOs  to  cover  similar  expenses.  As  the  survey  of  CFI  and\nNGO lending practices indicates, the average loan size is Rs35,000 with interest rates ranging\nfrom 15 to 18 percent per annum for a term of four years. Based on a detailed assessment of\nthe  absorptive  capacity  of  CFIs  and  NGOs,  conservative  estimates  indicate  that  at  least  $50\nmillion can be channeled through these subborrowers over the five-year project implementation\nperiod. A total allocation of $40 million is provided for this component for HUDCO, HDFC, and\nICICI to onlend to qualified CFIs and NGOs.\n\nb.\n\nPublic and Private Enterprises\n\nDrawing from the lending procedures pioneered by HUDCO and HDFC under the HFP,\n33.\npublic  and  private  enterprises  represent  another  important  and  financially  viable  channel  for\ndirecting housing finance to low-income households. Under this arrangement, HFIs provide bulk\nloans  to  public  and  private  enterprises  for  onlending  to  their  employees.  The  enterprise\n\n\f11\n\nguarantees repayment of the bulk loan and, in turn, deducts the individual loan repayments from\nthe borrowers\u2019 salaries. Representative public enterprises include state power corporations and\nport  authorities,  as  well  as  local  water  and  sanitation  authorities.  Additionally,  associations  of\npolice,  teachers,  and  nurses  can  be  considered,  along  with  other  types  of  employee\nassociations.  Private  enterprises  include  industrial  estates;  nongovernment  cooperatives  such\nas  those  in  the  textiles,  milk,  and  sugar  industries;  cottage  industry  associations;  and  the\nSarvodaya  Sangh  societies,  which  operate  department  stores  across  India  selling  textiles,\nhandicrafts, leather goods, and food items. As distinct from the bulk lending modality, up to 50\npercent of lending under this component can be in the form of direct housing loans to enterprise\nemployees when the enterprise is used as a means to market loans and to consolidate potential\nlow-income  borrowers.  A  total  of  $60  million  is  allocated  for  this  component  to  finance  80\npercent of disbursements through HUDCO, HDFC, and ICICI.\n\nc.\n\nState and Local Bodies\n\n34.\nThis  component  will  promote  lending  through  state  and  local  bodies  to  respond  to  the\nhousing  finance  needs  of  low-income  households  in  their  respective  states  and  local\njurisdictions.  Lending  under  this  component  will  be  restricted  to  state  governments  (and  the\nrespective local bodies) that have undertaken various sector reforms initiatives such as putting\ninto  place  progressive  urban  land  ceiling  laws  and/or  amending  state  rent  control  legislation.\nBased  on  these  criteria,  the  eligible  states  and  union  territories  (and  local  bodies  located\ntherein)  include  Andhra  Pradesh,  Delhi,  Gujarat,  Harayana,  Karnataka,  Kerala,  Madhya\nPradesh,  Maharastra,  Punjab,  Rajasthan,  Tamil  Nadu,  Uttar  Pradesh  and  West  Bengal.  In\naddition to the state governments, lending will only be permitted to the five state housing boards\nthat  have  (or  are  in  the  process  of)  undertaking  improvements  to  their  financial  management\nand  accounting  systems  under  the  ADB  Restructuring  State  Level  Housing  Institutions  TA\n(footnote  10),  namely  Gujarat,  Kerala,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Tamil  Nadu,  and  West  Bengal.  The\neligibility  of  other  state  housing  boards  will  be  considered  on  a  case-by-case  basis  upon\ndemonstration  that  they  are  initiating  reform  measures  in  accordance  with  recommendations\nand  guidelines  of  the  TA.  Given  the  poor  financial  performance  of  state  slum  improvement\nboards, state apex cooperative housing societies, state housing improvement trusts, as well as\nmunicipal  development  authorities,  no  lending  will  be  permitted  to  these  institutions  under  the\nProject. However, exceptions will be considered when the Borrowers can present a convincing\ncase that the subborrower\u2019s financial position is acceptable and that adequate financial controls\nwill be in place to ensure proper accounting of the sources and uses of funds. The $30 million\nallocation under this component will finance 80 percent of all funds channeled through HUDCO,\nHDFC, and ICICI to state and local bodies.\n\n2.\n\nPart B: Reducing Poverty through Innovative Subprojects\n\n35.\nThe  poverty  reduction  component  of  the  Project  includes  support  for  innovative\nsubprojects falling into two categories: (i) slum networking, and (ii) home workplace schemes.\nThe beneficiaries of these subprojects are predominately the urban poor or EWS households,\nand  given  their  limited  repayment  capacities,  subsidies  are  required  to  support  subproject\nimplementation and the operation and maintenance of basic urban infrastructure and services,\nsuch as water supply, sanitation, drainage, and solid waste management. HUDCO will serve as\nthe  Implementing  Agency  for  all  of  the  Part  B  subprojects  and  assume  full  responsibility  for\nproject identification, appraisal, implementation, and monitoring. Selection of subprojects will be\non  a  case-by-case  basis  and  based  on  criteria  aimed  at  achieving  substantial  development\nimpacts.  Subproject  proposals  will  need  to  include  (i)  mechanisms  to  ensure  community  and\nprivate  sector  participation  in  subproject  planning,  design,  financing,  implementation,  and\noperation  and  maintenance;  (ii)  a  clear  quantification  of  subsidies  and  description  of  payment\n\n\f12\n\narrangements; and (iii) simple cost-recovery mechanisms. As in part A, the Project will provide\nthat  all  repayments  under  this  component  be  re-lent  for  additional  slum  networking  and  home\nworkplace schemes, over the term of the ADB loan. Additionally, both components are eligible\nfor 100 percent financing through the ADB loan.\n\na.\n\nSlum Networking\n\n36.\nSlum  networking  subprojects  require  the  formation  of  partnerships  among  community\nresidents,  municipal  corporations,  CFIs,  NGOs,  and  often  times  private  businesses  and\nindustries.  The  approach  focuses  on  improving  all  essential  services  such  as  water  supply,\ndrainage, sanitation, access, and solid waste management within defined slum communities. It\nis estimated that 25 to 30 percent of slum dwellers have home-based production activities, and\nimprovements to water supply, electricity, and sanitation have a direct positive impact on their\nproductivity and incomes. Slum networking also includes a guarantee of tenure, which provides\nthe  slum  dwellers  with  the  necessary  assurance  to  improve  their  housing  conditions  and  to\ncontribute  financial  resources  and  labor  to  community-wide  improvements.  This  has  proven\nmuch more effective than providing households with title certificates that allow them to sell the\nproperty  and  move  to  or  establish  new  slums.  The  slum  networking  project  in  Ahmedabad  is\ncited  as  an  example  of  a  successful  partnership  involving  the  Ahmedabad  municipal\ncorporation,  community  residents,  CFIs,  and  local  industries  to  deliver  essential  municipal\nservices to more than 300,000 slum dwellers in the municipality. More than 10 slum networking\nsubprojects have already been identified for consideration under the Project; all are to be based\nupon  a  strong  partnership  approach  from  design  through  implementation.  The  partnership\napproach  represents  a  radical  departure \nfor  slum\nimprovement  schemes  whereby  HUDCO  provided  loans  directly  to  slum  improvement  boards\nwith minimal involvement in subproject appraisal, implementation, or monitoring. Subborrowers\nunder  this  component  will  include  municipal  authorities  and  CFIs.    A  total  of  $10  million  is\nallocated to HUDCO for financing subprojects under this component, with the maximum subloan\nfor any given subproject to be limited to $2 million.\n\ntraditional  support \n\nfrom  HUDCO\u2019s \n\nb.\n\nHome Workplace\n\nHome workplace subprojects are designed to provide financial resources to low-income\n37.\nhouseholds that operate cottage industries from their houses for the purpose of improving their\npremises,  resulting  in  increased  income  potential.  It  is  estimated  that  20  million  to  30  million\npeople  across  India  are  home-based  workers;  80  percent  are  women.16  The  subborrowers  for\nhome  workplace  subprojects  will  consist  of  handloom  and  handicraft  cooperative  societies,  as\nwell  as  various  public  and  private  companies  that  out-source  their  operations  such  as  beedi\n(tobacco) rolling, weaving, pottery, brass works, footwear, and so on. Due to the low incomes of\nhome-based workers, Government-sponsored home workplace schemes contain an element of\nsubsidy that is released through the state government when an agreement is reached between\nHUDCO  and  the  implementing  agency  on  the  financing  arrangements,  use  of  funds,  and\nrepayment  capacities  of  the  beneficiaries.  The  state  government  also  obtains  a  written\nundertaking from the beneficiaries that the home worksheds financed under the scheme will not\nbe  sold  or  rented  to  any  other  person  for  at  least  10  years.  HUDCO  funds  are  subsequently\nreleased based on a staged payment schedule, following a review of the physical and financial\nstatus  of  the  schemes.  HUDCO  has  successful  ongoing  programs  for  such  subprojects  with\nworker  societies  and  cooperatives  such  as  the  Tamil  Nadu  Handloom  and  Weavers\nCooperative  Society,  Rajasthan  State  Handloom  Development  Corporation,  and  Rajasthan\n\n                                                \n16 Mahila  Housing  SEWA  Trust  and  UNDP-World  Bank  Water  and  Sanitation  Program.  1999.  Credit Connections.\n\nNew Delhi.\n\n\f13\n\nRajya  Bunkar  Sahakry  Sangh  Ltd.  As  the  sole  Implementing  Agency  for  this  component,\nHUDCO will be responsible for onlending $5 million to support home workplace subprojects; the\nmaximum subloan size for any given subproject will be $500,000.\n\n3.\n\nPart  C:  Lending  to  Low-Income  Households  through  Housing  Finance\nInstitutions\n\n38.\nThis  part  of  the  Project  is  designed  to  increase  share  of  HFI  lending  to  low-income\nhouseholds.  This  objective  is  to  be  achieved  through  two  channels:  (i)  expanding  the  housing\nfinance  operations  of  three  HFCs,  namely  HUDCO,  HDFC,  and  ICICI,  to  lend  directly  to  low-\nincome  households  through  mortgages  with  market  interest  rates;  and  (ii)  expanding  the\nrefinancing  operations  of  NHB  so  that  smaller  HFCs,  which  will  not  be  Borrowers  under  the\nProject, will be able to increase their lending to low-income households as well as to CFIs and\nNGOs.  As  distinct  from  the  low-income  households  targeted  under  part  A,  the  low-income\nbeneficiaries of part C are those who do have title to real property to support a mortgage loan.\nSimilar to part A, the Borrowers will make adequate provisions to ensure that repayments under\nthis component are used to refinance loans to low-income households over the life of the ADB\nloan.    ADB  funds  will  refinance  80  percent  of  all  lending  under  this  part  to  maximize  the\nleveraging of the ADB loan and Borrowers' own-source contributions.\n\na.\n\nDirect Lending to Low-Income Households\n\n39.\nLow-income households are an unserved segment of the formal housing finance market,\nas  HFCs  have  traditionally  focused  on  lending  to  middle-  and  high-income  borrowers.  The\ntargeted  beneficiaries  of  this  component  will  have  average  household  incomes  ranging  from\nRs5,000  to  Rs7,000  per  month.  These  households  can  afford  a  mortgage  loan  of  over\nRs165,000  at  market-rate  terms.17  Combined  with  family  savings  and  in-kind  contributions,\nwhich often amount to the size of the loan, a moderate two- to three-room house could be built\nor purchased. Since the HFP, increased competition in the sector combined with deregulation\nhave resulted in virtual elimination of interest rate differentials by loan size, except for loans by\nHUDCO  to  EWS  households,  which  currently  carry  a  Government-mandated  annual  interest\nrate ceiling of 10.5 percent. This situation indicates that the downmarketing of housing finance\nto  low-income  households  is  financially  viable  for  HFCs.  A  total  of  $115  million  has  been\ntargeted for this component under the Project to be implemented by HUDCO, HDFC, and ICICI.\n\nb.\n\nRefinancing Loans to Low-Income Households\n\nAnother means to promote increased lending by HFCs to low-income households is to\n40.\nprovide  NHB  with  financial  resources  specifically  earmarked  to  refinance  HFC  mortgage\nportfolios  comprised  of  housing  loans  to  low-income  households.  This  component  will  be\nimplemented solely by NHB, which has the only refinancing facility among the Borrowers. The\ninstitutions eligible for participation under this component include all HFCs approved by NHB for\nrefinancing, with the exception of HUDCO, HDFC, and ICICI. Given the desired focus on HFCs,\nrefinancing  of  mortgage  loans  to  low-income  households  by  state  apex  cooperative  housing\nsocieties,  state  agricultural  rural  development  banks,  and  state  cooperative  banks  will  not  be\nfinanced  under  the  Project;  however,  exceptions  may  be  considered  when  NHB  can\ndemonstrate  that  a  given  institution's  financial  position  is  acceptable  and  adequate  financial\ncontrols are in place to ensure proper accounting of the sources and uses of funds. NHB can\nalso refinance HFC loans to CFIs and NGOs under the CFI refinance scheme; this scheme was\ndeveloped  under  the  ADB  TA  for  Strengthening  Housing  Finance  Institutions  (footnote  9)  and\n                                                \n17 Assuming a mortgage repayment capacity of 30 percent of a monthly income of Rs7,000 per month and a 15-year\n\nmortgage at 13 percent (HDFC\u2019s unified annual interest rate), the maximum affordable loan size is Rs165,976.\n\n\f14\n\nlaunched in January 1999. While only one loan has been refinanced under the scheme thus far,\nthe Project will encourage more HFCs to lend to CFIs by requiring that NHB direct 20 percent of\nthe  funds  under  this  component  for  CFI  refinancing.  The  total  allocation  for  this  component,\ncomprising  both  the  refinancing  of  low-income  housing  loans  by  HFCs  and  the  refinancing  of\nHFC loans to CFIs, is $40 million.\n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n41.\nThe project cost estimates, presented in Table 1, include all the investments in housing\nand related infrastructure improvements expected to be generated through the catalytic effect of\nthe ADB loans. The cost estimates assume that individual households receiving housing loans\nthrough  the  Project  will  invest  an  amount  roughly  equal  to  50  percent  of  each  loan  amount\n(Appendix  6).    This  assumed  beneficiary  contribution  is  very  conservative,  and  based  on  CFI\nlending  records  as  well  as  surveys  of  low-income  borrowers.  The  contribution  of  household\nsavings,  land,  and  labor  often  exceeds  two  times  the  original  loan  amount,  especially  when\nhousehold  contributions  are  tracked  over  time.  This  tendency  for  low-income  households  to\ncontinue to invest a significant proportion of their disposable income for housing improvements\nis attributed to the economic and social benefits of home ownership. As well as constituting a\nhousehold's  most  valuable  asset,  a  home  provides  the  physical  environment  to  raise  a  family\nand  membership  within  a  local  community,  and  often  times  a  place  to  support  income-\ngenerating  activities.  In  addition  to  the  beneficiary  contributions,  the  provision  to  refinance  80\npercent of all lending under part C, as well as lending to public and private enterprises and state\nand local bodies under part A, will stimulate the Borrowers to contribute own-source funds in an\namount equal to 25 percent of the ADB loan for these components.\n\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nItem\nA.

It  is\nproposed  that  ADB  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $61  million  and  $239  million\nequivalent (52 percent) of the local currency cost. The balance of the project cost will be borne\nby  the  Borrowers  as  well  as  the  beneficiary  households  from  their  own  resources.  Table  2\nshows the financing plan.\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nForeign\n\nLocal\n\nExchange\n\nCurrency\n\n        61\n\nSource\n\nADB\n\nHUDCO\n\nNHB\n\nHDFC\n\nICICI\n\nBeneficiaries\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nTotal\n\n        61\n\nTotal\n\nCost\n\n300\n\n21\n\n10\n\n20\n\n20\n\n146\n\n517\n\nPercent\n\n58\n\n4\n\n2\n\n4\n\n4\n\n28\n\n100\n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  HDFC  =  Housing  Development  Finance  Corporation,  HUDCO  =  Housing  and\nUrban Development Corporation, NHB = National Housing Bank.\n\nThe  proposed  loans  will  be  provided  as  lines  of  credit  to  finance  the  entire  foreign\n43.\nexchange  cost,  and  part  of  the  local  currency  costs  (58  percent  of  the  total  project  cost).  The\nactual  use  of  the  loans,  each  of  which  will  be  in  a  fixed  amount  and  guaranteed  by  the\nGovernment,  will  be  periodically  reviewed  by  ADB  missions  to  assess  the  efficiency  and\neffectiveness  of  use  by  the  Borrowers.  To  stimulate  financial  contributions  by  the  Borrowers,\nADB will finance 80 percent of the total amount disbursed under part C as well as 80 percent of\nall loans channeled through public and private enterprises and state and local bodies under part\nA.\n\n44.\nThe proposed loan utilization for each Borrower is as follows: HUDCO will receive $100\nmillion and onlend $25 million to CFIs and NGOs, $20 million to public and private enterprises,\n$10  million  to  state  and  local  bodies,  and  $30  million  to  individual  low-income  households\nthrough  retail  lending,  and  use  $15  million  to  support  slum  networking  and  home  workplace\nsubprojects.  NHB will receive $40 million for refinancing HFC loans to low-income households\nand CFIs.  HDFC will receive $80 million and onlend $5 million to CFIs and NGOs, $20 million\nto  public  and  private  enterprises,  $10  million  to  state  and  local  bodies,  and  $45  million  to\nindividual low-income households.  ICICI will receive $80 million and onlend $10 million to CFIs\nand  NGOs,  $20  million  to  public  and  private  enterprises,  $10  million  to  state  and  local  bodies\nand  $40  million  to  individual  low-income  households.  These  allocations  are  based  on  several\ncriteria, including development objectives and impacts, each Borrower's capability to implement\nthe different lending modalities and subprojects, and an assessment of the absorptive capacity\nof  the  different  financial  intermediaries  to  onlend  funds  to  low-income  households.  Such\nallocations  also  represent  lending  targets  to  be  achieved  by  the  Borrowers  during  the  project\n\n\f16\n\nimplementation period. Lending targets by project parts and primary Borrowers are detailed in\nAppendix 7.\n\n45.\nThe four loans will carry interest in accordance with ADB's market-based lending window\nand  a  front-end  fee  of  1  percent  of  the  loan  amount.  In  view  of  the  development  project\norientation of part B, and the desire to improve the matching of assets and liabilities among the\nHFCs,  the  loans  will  have  an  amortization  period  of  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5\nyears. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Borrowers.\n\nThe provision for financing local currency costs is considered justified under ADB\u2019s local\n46.\ncurrency financing policy.18 With a low per capita income, India is classified as a less developed\ncountry  under  the  United  Nations  system,  and  such  ADB  member  countries  are  to  be  given\npriority  in  ADB's  local  currency  financing  policy.  The  public  sector  saving  rate  is  very  low,  the\nhousing  finance  sector  in  general  is  weak,  and  consequently,  financing  is  constrained,\nparticularly for the poorest. The central Government and several state governments are taking\nsteps  to  (i)  improve  savings  performance  through  fiscal  consolidation  and  public  sector\nrestructuring, and (ii) improve access to housing through legislative amendments and improved\ntaxation systems and tax administration. Private sector participation in housing finance is being\nstimulated  by  the  implementation  of  conducive  policy  reforms  including  appropriate  incentives\nand  ongoing  liberalization  of  the  financial  sector  and  capital  markets.  Finally,  the  Government\nhas  initiated  a  program  to  ensure  availability  of  shelter  for  the  lower  income  groups  by\nencouraging  public  and  private  lending  through  CFIs  and  NGOs,  incorporating  livelihood\nelements  and  other  participatory  approaches,  and  thus  resulting  in  gradual  reduction  of  grant\nelements and improvements in loan repayment rates.\n\n47.\nThe local currency component of the Project is high because most housing construction\nmaterials  are  produced  locally;  this  is  particularly  true  for  low-income  houses.  The  Project  is\nexpected  to  have  a  high  demonstration  and  catalytic  value  in  reforming  the  housing  finance\nsector to make it more effective and efficient in improving access of low-income households to\nsources  of  finance  for  shelter.  It  thus  has  high  economic,  human  development,  and  poverty-\nreduction  values  and  merits  and  a  relatively  high  level  of  local  currency  financing  support,  as\nthere  is  insufficient  opportunity  for  ADB  to  achieve  its  objectives  by  foreign  currency  lending\nalone.\n\n48.\nHUDCO,  NHB,  HDFC,  and  ICICI  will  onlend  the  loan  proceeds  in  local  currency  to\nsubborrowers. Accordingly HUDCO, NHB, HDFC, and ICICI will hedge ADB's foreign currency\nloans  against  foreign-exchange  risk  through  either  a  foreign-exchange  risk  cover  under  an\nappropriate  facility  available  in  the  market  or  a  currency  swap  or  forward  cover,  or  both,\nsatisfactory to ADB. A representative financing structure under a currency swap arrangement,\nsimilar to the arrangement under the HFP, is described in Appendix 8.\n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n49.\nEach of the four Borrowers will be responsible for implementing their respective project\ncomponents  and  subprojects  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines  and  procedures.  Lending\nthrough intermediaries under part A will be implemented by HUDCO, HDFC, and, in the case of\nICICI,  through  ICICI  Home  Finance  Company.  Implementation  of  part  B  will  be  the  sole\nresponsibility  of  HUDCO.  Given  HUDCO's  significant  role  under  parts  A  and  B,  HUDCO  will\ncreate  a  full-time  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  to  ensure  proper  subproject  identification,\nappraisal, implementation, financial reporting, and monitoring. The direct lending to low-income\n\n                                                \n18 R1-95: Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditures on Projects, 3 January.\n\n\f17\n\nhouseholds  component  of  part  C  will  be  implemented  by  HUDCO,  HDFC,  and,  in  the  case  of\nICICI,  through  ICICI  Home  Finance  Company.  NHB  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the\nrefinancing  component  of  part  C.  The  four  borrowing  institutions  must  assume  the  dollar  to\nrupee  conversion  cost,  the  associated  cost  of  mitigating  the  risk  of  foreign  exchange  rate\nfluctuations,  and  the  Government  guarantee  fee.  However,  it  is  expected  that  the  longer\nmaturity of the ADB loan will allow the Borrowers to better balance the maturities of their assets\nand liabilities. Each of the Borrowers will be responsible for maintaining separate accounts on\nthe various uses of the loan proceeds.\n\n1. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n \n50.\nThe Project will be implemented over five years (2000/01 \u2013 2005/06). To ensure timely\nimplementation and in-line with the Government\u2019s emphasis on the disbursement readiness of\napproved loans, each Borrower will prepare a detailed disbursement plan for the first year of the\nProject including associated draft subloan agreements with intermediaries. The closing date for\nsubmission  of  an  application  for  subproject  approval  will  be  four  years  from  the  date  of\neffectiveness of each loan agreement, and for disbursement it will be the loan closing date.\n\n2. \n\nApproval of Subprojects\n\nto  ensure \n\n \n51.\nAll four Borrowers are required to submit the first two subprojects under each applicable\nonlending channel or component to ADB for review and approval. All subprojects to be financed\nunder  the  slum  networking  and  home  workplace  components  of  part  B  will  require  ADB\napproval \nthat  procurement,  environmental,  resettlement,  and  compensation\nprocedures,  as  well  as  other  ADB  conditions,  are  met.  Each  slum  networking  subproject\nproposal  will  include  a  detailed  description  of  the  inputs  and  their  cost;  partnership\narrangements  of  CFIs,  NGOs,  municipalities,  slum  residents,  and  the  private  sector;  financing\nand cost recovery mechanisms; extent of subsidies involved; any resettlement or compensation\nissues,  and  a  plan  to  address  such  issues;  and  the  implementation  plan  including  institutional\nand beneficiary responsibilities, an initial environmental examination of the subproject, and the\nlong-term  management  and  financing  plan.  Equally  important,  the  subproject  description  will\ndiscuss the measures incorporated to ensure its sustainability and demonstration value.\n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement\n\n \n52.\nProcurement  under  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for\nProcurement.  For procurement of goods and services to be financed by the subloans out of the\nloan proceeds, the Borrowers will satisfy ADB that the procurement procedures they applied are\nappropriate in the circumstances. Moreover, they will ensure, and certify to ADB, if requested,\nthat  the  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  by  such  subloans  are  purchased  at  reasonable\nprices, account being taken of relevant factors such as time of delivery, efficiency, and reliability\nof  goods;  their  suitability  for  the  qualified  housing  proposals  and  slum  subprojects;  the\navailability  of  maintenance  facilities  and  spare  parts;  and  in  the  case  of  services,  their  quality\nand the competence of the parties rendering them.\n \n\n4. \n\nDisbursement\n\n \n53.\nThe  Borrowers  will  disburse  subloans  under  the  Project  through  (i)  a  separate  imprest\naccount of each Borrower, to be established immediately after the effective date of each Loan\nAgreement;  or  (ii)  ADB's  direct  payment,  commitment,  or  reimbursement  procedures.  The\nimprest accounts, which will receive initial advances equivalent to each Borrower\u2019s anticipated\ndisbursements to subborrowers over a six-month period must be set up with local commercial\nbanks  acceptable  to  ADB.    The  Borrowers  may,  from  these  accounts,  make  swap  or  other\n\n\f18\n\nhedging  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  to  cover  the  foreign  exchange  rate  risk  for  project-\nrelated  expenditures.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and\nliquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook,  as  amended  from  time  to\ntime.  ADB's  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  used  to  liquidate  advances  provided\ninto the imprest accounts. However, each individual payment reimbursed or liquidated using the\nstatement of expenditure procedure will not exceed $2.0 million equivalent. Other disbursement\nprocedures will be in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook.\n \n\n 5.\n\nProject Supervision and Reporting Requirements\n\n \n54.\nEach  Borrower  will  assign  a  project  manager  who  will  be  responsible  for  project\nsupervision,  monitoring,  accounting,  and  reporting.    Each  Borrower  will  also  submit  to  ADB  a\nquarterly  progress  report  on  commitments  and  disbursements,  implementation  status  of\napproved subprojects, any problems encountered during the quarter under review including any\nmaterial or adverse change in the Borrower\u2019s activities, actions taken or proposed to be taken to\nremedy  those  problems,  and  the  expected  progress  during  the  following  quarter.    The\nBorrowers  will  establish  and  maintain  accounts  and  records  in  such  a  manner  as  to  facilitate\nidentification of income and expenditures related to the Project. The Borrowers will keep proper\nrecords of all onlending activities under part A, identifying the subborrower or intermediary; the\nsize, term, and interest rate of the loan(s) to subborrowers; the estimated number and income\nlevels of beneficiaries; the purpose(s) and use(s) of loans to the beneficiaries; and the average\nsize, term, and interest rate of loans to the beneficiaries.  Under part B, HUDCO will (i) record\nthe lending terms of subloans for slum networking and home workplace subprojects, as well as\nprepare an assessment of the financial position of the subborrowers; and (ii) ensure that it has\naccess to the list of beneficiaries. For part C, the Borrowers will maintain proper lending records\nthat indicate the monthly household income levels of the borrowers, the purpose(s) of the loan\n(i.e.,  new  house  construction,  home  improvement,  etc.),  the  security  held  for  each  mortgage,\nand  the  size,  term,  and  interest  rate  of  each  loan.  For  part  C,  as  well  as  for  the  onlending  to\npublic  and  private  enterprises  and  state  and  local  bodies  under  part  A,  the  Borrowers  will\nmaintain  adequate  records  to  show  that  ADB  funds  were  used  to  finance  80  percent  of  total\nlending through these channels.\n\n6.\n\nAccounts and Audit\n\n \n55.\nEach  Borrower  will  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  of  its  annual  audited  financial\nstatements  and  the  auditor\u2019s  report  within  nine  months  of  completion  of  the  fiscal  year.    All  of\nthe accounts and statements of expenditures and revenues will be audited annually by auditors\nacceptable  to  ADB.  Audited  project  accounts,  together  with  the  report  of  the  auditor,  will  be\nsubmitted to ADB within nine months of the close of the financial year. In addition to the audited\nproject accounts, the Borrowers will submit audited annual financial statements through the life\nof the loan. Each Borrower will also submit to ADB, not later than three months after the loan\nclosing  date,  a  completion  report  on  loan  utilization,  subproject  implementation,  and  the\nperformance of intermediaries and subborrowers with respect to onlending funds to low-income\nhouseholds for housing purchase, construction, or improvement.\n \n\n7.\n\nPeriodic Reviews\n\n \n56.\nAt  its  discretion,  but  at  least  once  every  six  months,  ADB  will  conduct  reviews  of  the\nmanagement,  financial,  and  operational  performance  of  the  Borrowers  with  respect  to  project\nactivities  and  their  compliance  with  implementation  of  the  Policy  and  Institutional  Action  Plan\n(Appendix  4).  The  plan  may  be  modified  during  project  implementation  by  agreement  of  the\nGovernment,  Borrowers,  and  ADB,  and  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the\n\n\f19\n\nrequirements and schedules set forth therein. A midterm review will be conducted by the end of\n2003  with  participation  of  the  involved  parties.  The  objectives  of  the  midterm  review  are  to\n(i) review  the  progress  achieved  relative  to  the  targets  set  for  each  project  component;\n(ii) assess  the  degree  of  accomplishments  in  meeting  the  Policy  and  Institutional  Action  Plan\ntargets  and  revise  targets  as  appropriate;  (iii)  reexamine  the  project  design,  implementation\narrangements, and other relevant aspects; and (iv) formulate, within the updated sector setting\nand  other  changes  in  circumstances  at  the  time  of  the  review,  any  changes  to  ensure\nsuccessful  project  implementation,  achievement  of  project  objectives,  and  sustainability  of\nproject  benefits.  In  addition,  independent  project  impact  evaluations  will  be  organized  by  the\nGovernment in the second and fourth years following commencement.\n \n\n8.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nTo ensure that the target beneficiaries are realizing the anticipated benefits, the Project\n57.\nincludes  a  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME)  program  to  be  undertaken  by  the\nBorrowers.  The BME program will (i) monitor the Project\u2019s implementation performance, which\nwill mainly deal with the efficiency and effectiveness of the different onlending arrangements; (ii)\nmonitor the Project\u2019s operational performance, mainly in terms of the Borrowers achieving their\nrespective lending targets; and (iii) evaluate the Borrowers' performance during and after project\nimplementation.  The  key  monitoring  indices,  in  addition  to  targets  and  actions  set  forth  in  the\nproject framework (Appendix 1) and policy and institutional action plan (Appendix 4), will be (i)\ninternal  efficiency  of  sublending  operations,  (ii)  satisfaction  of  demand  for  finance,  (iii) level  of\nbeneficiary  participation,  (iv)  ability  to  service  target  groups,  (v)  financial  impact  on  Borrowers\nand subborrowers, (vi) sustainability of strengthened linkages between HFIs and CFIs, and (vii)\nsocioeconomic impact on low-income beneficiaries. The BME information system design will be\nbased on ADB\u2019s Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation Handbook and carefully tailored to meet the\nconditions in the Project.  The Borrowers will provide ADB with the information produced under\nthe BME program in the first quarterly report for each calendar year.\n\nF.\n\nThe Borrowers\n\n58.\nThe Borrowers represent Government-sponsored, regulatory, and private sector housing\nfinance  institutions.  All  four  institutions  have  borrowed  from  ADB  in  the  past,  and  their  sound\nfinancial management and performance qualifies them to participate in the Project as Borrowers\nand Executing Agencies. A brief description of each of the four Borrowers follows.\n\n1.\n\nHousing and Urban Development Corporation\n\n59.\nHUDCO  was  incorporated  in  April  1970  as  a  wholly  Government-owned  company  to\npromote  housing  and  urban  development,  particularly  for  the  low-income  and  economically\nweaker sections of society. As the first financial institution dealing exclusively with the housing\nsector,  its  establishment  marked  the  beginning  of  formal  housing  finance  in  India.  HUDCO  is\nregistered under the Companies Act as a public limited company and run by a board of directors\nconsisting  of  professionals  appointed  by  Government.  Its  corporate  office  is  located  in  New\nDelhi,  and  it  has  5  zonal,  16  regional,  and  12  development  offices  throughout  the  country.  Its\ncurrent  operations  are  divided  between  housing  and  infrastructure  finance  through  state  and\nlocal  agencies.  In  the  past  year  it  began  to  lend  directly  to  individuals  for  housing  through  its\nHUDCO Niwas retail lending window.\n\n60.\nHUDCO  currently  has  authorized  capital  of  Rs12.5  billion  ($290.7  million)  and  paid-in\ncapital  of  Rs5.8  billion  ($135  million).  The  cumulative  number  of  housing  and  infrastructure\nschemes sanctioned through 31 March 1999 is 14,623. Loans sanctioned total Rs230.55 billion,\n\n\f20\n\nof  which  housing  comprises  Rs146.04  billion.  Cumulative  disbursements  through  31  March\n1999 were Rs154.73 billion, and the total number of dwelling units financed through the same\nperiod are almost 8.6 million. As a wholly owned Government institution, HUDCO is mandated\nto lend at least 55 percent of its funds to low-income groups and the EWS. Since the majority of\nits lending is through state and local bodies for which cost recovery from borrowers has been\npoor, HUDCO has required state guarantees for such lending. Hence, prior to the early 1990s,\ncost  recovery  and  rigid  appraisal  were  not  vigorously  pursued.  Recent  economic  reforms  and\nthe decline of Government funds for such schemes have made states increasingly reluctant to\nissue guarantees. HUDCO has therefore undergone fundamental changes in recent years; it is\nassisting  its  borrowers  to  achieve  improved  cost  recovery  techniques,  and  assisting  state  and\nlocal  bodies  to  adopt  reforms  such  as  commercialization  of  selected  urban  infrastructure\nprojects. The ongoing ADB TA to strengthen state-level housing finance agencies (footnote 10)\nwill also serve to improve HUDCO\u2019s lending and cost recovery.\n\n2. \n\nNational Housing Bank\n\nNHB was established in July 1988 to function as the apex body for the housing finance\n61.\nsector. It is wholly owned by the Reserve Bank of India, and has an authorized and fully paid-up\nshare capital of Rs3.5 billion ($81.4 million). NHB\u2019s three primary responsibilities are to mobilize\nresources  for  the  housing  sector,  promote  the  development  of  HFCs,  and  regulate  the\noperations  of  HFCs.  As  a  promoter,  NHB  provides  financial  support  to  HFCs  and  facilitates\naccess to institutional credit. It provides refinancing to 29 HFCs and other entities according to a\nrefinancing  schedule  whereby  refinance  rates  are  based  on  loan  sizes.    As  a  regulator,  NHB\nsets prudential norms for HFCs based on required capital adequacy ratios, income recognition,\nasset classification, and acceptable levels of nonperforming assets.\n\n62.\nAs  of  December  1999,  NHB  had  refinanced  a  total  of  Rs47.6  billion  ($1.11  billion)  for\nthree categories of approved borrowers: HFCs, scheduled banks, and cooperative institutions.\nHFCs  account  for  77  percent  of  all  refinancing;  cooperative  institutions  for  18  percent,  and\nscheduled  banks  for  5  percent.  Lately,  due  to  the  decline  in  interest  rates  in  the  country,\nscheduled banks have not taken any refinancing from NHB, although they have increased their\nlending for housing. In January 1999, the NHB board approved a new refinancing scheme for\nCFIs  under  which  any  approved  institution,  mainly  HFCs,  could  avail  of  refinancing  for  loans\nmade to CFIs. Only one HFC has accessed this facility. Over the past few years, NHB has been\npreparing to undertake a pilot issue of MBS. It has obtained approval from the Reserve Bank of\nIndia for such an issue, drafted the necessary legal documents, appointed merchant bankers for\nthe  offer,  prepared  an  operations  and  accounting  manual,  and  discussed  the  issue  with\ninterested investors. The pilot issue is expected to come to market in the near future.\n\n3.\n\nHousing Development Finance Corporation\n\n63.\nHDFC was established in 1977 as the first specialized housing finance institution in the\ncountry. The company was promoted by ICICI with initial equity investments by the International\nFinance Corporation and his Royal Highness, the Aga Khan. HDFC is a public limited company\nspecializing  in  the  provision  of  housing  finance  to  individual  borrowers.  As  the  only  private\nhousing finance institution at the time, it grew rapidly and is still considered the market leader in\nthe  retail  housing  finance  business.  The  majority  of  HDFC\u2019s  loans  are  to  individuals  who\ncurrently  number  over  800,000.  To  reach  lower  income  borrowers,  HDFC  has  utilized  several\nlines of credit from KfW to finance various projects for low-income households as well as loans\nto CFIs.\n\n\f21\n\n64.\nAs of 31 March 2000, HDFC\u2019s paid-up capital was Rs1.20 billion ($27.60 million); its net\nworth  was  Rs20.96  billion  ($481.84  million).  As  a  publicly  listed  company,  its  shares  are\nregularly  traded  on  the  stock  exchange.  As  of  March  2000  the  company  had  116,000\nshareholders. It has 67 branches throughout the country, and some 47,000 agents who collect\ndeposits  and  submit  loan  applications  where  there  are  no  branches.  HDFC\u2019s  major  source  of\nfunds  is  deposits  through  various  deposit  schemes  tailored  to  different  types  of  depositors.  It\nalso  raises  funds  through  bond  and  debenture  issues,  long-term  loans  from  domestic  and\ninternational finance institutions, and NHB refinancing. A new source of finance will be through\nthe    pilot  securitization  issue  of  HDFC  mortgages.  In  its  efforts  to  diversify,  HDFC  has  also\nestablished  an  infrastructure  finance  services  company,  a  credit-rating  company,  consumer\nfinance companies, a property management company, and a bank.\n\n4.\n\nICICI\n\n65.\nICICI  was  established  in  1955  under  an  initiative  of  the  Government,  the  World  Bank,\nand representatives of Indian industries. Since that time, ICICI has developed into a universal\nbanking  group  with  18  subsidiaries  and  affiliates.  ICICI  operations  include  medium-  and  long-\nterm  project  finance,  corporate  finance,  leasing,  and  other  types  of  financial  and  advisory\nservices.  Until  recent  years,  ICICI\u2019s  operations  concentrated  on  project-based  lending  to  the\nmanufacturing  sector.  In  response  to  the  changing  economic  and  financial  environment,  ICICI\nhas  taken  steps  to  diversify  its  operations  with  an  increasing  focus  on  corporate  and\ninfrastructure financing.  As a result of this diversification, ICICI\u2019s asset base has continued to\ngrow. Disbursements increased by 34 percent from Rs192.25 billion ($4.42 billion) in FY1999 to\nRs258.36 billion ($5.94 billion) in FY2000, while total assets increased by 11.16 percent, from\nRs538.57  billion  ($12.38  billion)  in  FY1999  to  Rs598.659  billion  ($13.76  billion)  in  FY2000.\nDuring  the  same  period  loan  approvals  increased  by  38  percent  from  Rs323.17  billion  ($7.43\nbillion) in FY1999 to Rs447.79 billion ($10.29 billion) in FY2000 indicating a strong pipeline of\nbusiness.\n\nICICI was not a Borrower under the HFP, and the primary justification for its inclusion in\n66.\nthe Project is to promote greater competition, especially given ICICI's size and its ability to have\na  significant  impact  on  India's  housing  finance  sector.  In  1998/99  ICICI  began  to  provide  the\nentire  range  of  personal  loans  to  individuals,  including  housing  finance,  automobile  financing,\nand  consumer  durable  finance.  ICICI  Home  Finance  Company  was  established  during  this\nperiod as a 100 percent subsidiary to provide focus to ICICI's housing finance initiative. As of\nMarch 2000, ICICI Home Finance Company approved housing loans for Rs2.57 billion ($59.08\nmillion), while disbursements total Rs0.765 billion ($17.60 million). ICICI\u2019s corporate recognition\nas well as the group\u2019s large retail customer base and wide distribution network give it a strategic\nadvantage  in  entering  the  housing  finance  sector.  Utilizing  its  corporate  relationships,  ICICI\u2019s\ngeographic reach is nationwide, with 90 branches, 55 service centers, and 9 locations serviced\nby  direct  marketing  agents.  Cumulative  disbursements  of  ICICI  Home  Finance  Company\nprojects are projected to be Rs123 million ($2.83 million) by FY2006.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\n67.\nAll  three  parts  of  the  Project  will  increase  the  availability  of  housing  finance  for  the\npurchase,  improvement,  extension,  and  construction  of  housing  for  low-income  families.\nImproved housing and living conditions also mean better environmental conditions, both at the\nhousehold and community levels, thereby contributing to a better quality of life, improved family\nhealth,  and  greater  environmental  awareness  and  pride  of  community.  In  the  long  run,  better\neconomic  conditions,  resulting  from  the  associated  benefits  of  improved  housing  and\n\n\f22\n\nneighborhood  infrastructure,  will  enable  communities  to  sustain  additional  environmental\nimprovements.\n\n68.\nHousing improvements financed under the Project will have a strong positive impact on\nthe  immediate  living  environment  for  women  and  children  who  spend  much  of  their  time  at\nhome.  Better  ventilation,  increased  usable  space,  and  adequate  lighting  will  have  a  positive\nimpact  on  conditions  within  the  house  itself.  The  use  of  solid,  better  quality  building  materials\nand construction practices will reduce household vulnerability to fire, building collapse, rodents,\nand in many cases, flooding or standing water.\n\n69.\nUnder the slum networking component of part B, the Project will finance improvements\nin selected urban slums. Access to clean water in these areas is scarce and many households\nhave either no toilet facilities or use latrines that discharge directly into drains and open water\nbodies.  Exposure  to  human  waste  is  exacerbated  by  the  inadequacy  of  drainage  and  by  the\nimproper disposal of solid waste. In addition, slums are often situated in low-lying areas that are\nsubject  to  flooding  during  the  monsoon  season.  Without  adequate  drainage  and  sewage,\nwastewater  mixes  with  storm  water  and  creates  conditions  for  the  spread  of  waterborne\ndiseases.\n\n70.\nThe slum networking component will also have direct positive impacts on family health\nand  the  surrounding  environment  by  improving  community  water  supply  and  sanitation,  solid\nwaste management, and drainage. All of these efforts will reduce the incidence of waterborne\ndisease.  The  active  involvement  of  local  communities  in  the  conception,  implementation,\nfinancing,  and  maintenance  of  slum  networking  projects  will  complement  and  reinforce  these\nbenefits,  ensure  greater  cost  recovery  and  sustainability,  create  subproject  ownership,  and\npromote greater awareness of environmental issues.\n\n71.\nThe only potential adverse environmental impact of the Project could be the disruption of\npublic  services  and  transportation  during  the  construction  phase  for  slum  networking\nsubprojects;  however,  given  the  relatively  small  scale  and  labor-intensive  nature  of  such\nsubprojects,  these  disruptions  are  expected  to  be  minor  and  can  be  easily  mitigated  through\nappropriate  measures.  Initial  environmental  examinations  will  be  prepared  for  each  slum\nnetworking  subproject  to  identify  and  minimize  any  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts.\nThese  assessments  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  to  ensure  that  they  comply  with  its\nenvironmental guidelines.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\n72.\nSocial aspects of lending to low-income households are presented in Appendix 9, which\nsummarizes the results of a comprehensive survey of CFIs, NGOs, and low-income borrowers.\nThe Project will focus on extending loans to low-income households that are currently unable to\naccess  housing  finance  from  the  formal  sector.  It  will  involve  CFI  and  NGO  networking,\ncommunity participation, and the education and empowerment of low-income groups to support\nsustainable  improvements  in  their  social  well-being.    With  the  exception  of  the  direct  lending\ncomponent of part C, the Project will have a high degree of community engagement in all of its\ncomponents and strong positive social impacts.\n\n\f23\n\na.\n\nProfile of Project Beneficiaries\n\n73.\nProject beneficiaries will be low-income households with monthly incomes of Rs7,000 or\nless. Under the CFI and NGO lending component of part A, beneficiaries, for the most part, will\nbe  members  of  self-help  groups  in  urban  and  peri-urban  areas  with  a  positive  record  of\nborrowing and repaying small loans. The majority of these households will be able to afford loan\nrepayments  between  Rs250  and  Rs500  per  month.  Most  of  the  beneficiaries  will  be  women.\nThe  beneficiaries  under  other  project  parts  will  include  slum  dwellers,  low-income  employees\nfrom  public  and  private  sector  enterprises,  state  and  local  government  workers,  home-based\nworkers,  and  individual  borrowers.  All  of  these  beneficiaries  will  be  part  of  households\ninterested  in  building  or  improving  individual  housing,  but  unable  to  access  market-based\nhousing finance through formal channels.\n\nb.\n\nBeneficiary Impacts\n\n74.\nThe  Project  will  have  a  strong  positive  impact  on  three  levels  of  beneficiaries.  First,\nindividual  low-income  households  will  benefit  directly  from  increased  access  to  market-based\nhousing finance that, in turn, will provide for  (i) a safe, secure, and more comfortable place in\nwhich to live and raise a family; (ii) a higher standard of living that enhances a family\u2019s social\nstatus and improves its children\u2019s prospects for marriage; and (iii) a greater degree of residential\nand  household  stability  due  to  the  possession,  in  many  cases  by  women,  of  a  valuable  fixed\nasset. Also at the household level, improved housing will have several economic impacts that\ninclude  savings  in  rent;  ownership  of  a  long-term  asset  with  a  generally  appreciating  value;\nimproved infrastructure and services resulting in more time for productive activities; a healthier\nenvironment,  particularly  for  home-based  workers  and  children;  and  the  establishment  of\nacceptable collateral that can be used to obtain additional credit. Second, self-help groups and\nslum  neighborhoods  will  be  organized  and  trained  to  work  closely  with  CFIs  and  other\ndevelopment partners. Finally, the capacities of HFIs, CFIs, and NGOs  will be strengthened to\nincrease and sustain their lending to low-income households.\n\nc.\n\nImpact on Women\n\n75. Women  will  constitute  the  majority  of  subborrowers  from  CFIs  and  NGOs  for  housing\nloans under part A, as well as for home workplace improvement loans under part B. Their active\nparticipation  in  self-help  groups  provides  opportunities  to  empower  them  in  household  and\ncommunity  decision  making  and  to  address  their  immediate  housing  and  neighborhood\nconcerns.  The  use  of  project  funds  for  housing  will  provide  women  with  an  important  physical\nand financial asset that will substantially increase their status and security within the household\nas  well  as  in  their  communities.  Since  women  have  the  ultimate  child-rearing  responsibilities,\nthe right and security to land and property will also help safeguard the family\u2019s interests. Women\nand  children  are  particularly  affected  by  poor    housing  conditions  and  the  lack  of  clean  water\nand proper sanitation facilities. Better living conditions, and improved community services and\nfacilities will reduce the vulnerability of women and children to disease, diminish the drudgery of\nmany household tasks, and provide more time for income-generating activities.\n\nd.\n\nCommunity Participation\n\n76.\nMany  components  of  the  Project  will  be  community-driven,  not  only  in  terms  of\ntraditional  levels  of  participation,  but  also  in  terms  of  developing  community  ownership  and\nproviding support to people-driven initiatives. Support for CFI lending, for instance,  will catalyze\nthe development of savings groups and other forms of community participation. Emphasis will\nbe  placed  not  only  on  delivering  basic  housing  and  services  to  the  poor,  but  also  on\n\n\f24\n\nempowering the low-income segment of the population through the establishment of sustainable\ngrassroots processes and institutions. The creation of working partnerships among CFIs, slum\nneighborhoods, and municipal authorities will be one of the primary conditions for the selection\nof  slum  networking  subprojects.  These  subprojects  will  provide  a  legitimate  arena  for  local\ncommunity  institutions  to  act  as  civic  institutions  and  to  establish  viable  partnerships  with\nmainstream agencies for housing and infrastructure development, as well as ongoing operation\nand maintenance activities.\n\nH.\n\nPolicy Issues\n\n77.\nThe  Project  emphasizes  the  establishment  of  a  comprehensive  and  conducive  policy,\ninstitutional,  and  regulatory  environment  to  foster  the  development  of  sustainable  housing\nfinance  mechanisms  to  meet  the  housing  finance  needs  of  low-income  households.    During\nproject  preparation,  a  number  of  policy  reform  measures  to  improve  the  efficiency  and\ncompetitiveness  of  the  housing  finance  delivery  system  were  identified.  These  policy  reform\nmeasures,  presented  in  Appendix  4,  will  be  periodically  and  jointly  reviewed  by  ADB\nadministration  missions,  the  Borrowers,  and  the  Government  against  progress  achieved.\nFollowing  such  reviews,  actions  and  schedules  will  be  amended,  if  deemed  appropriate.  The\nprincipal project-related policy reform measures and initiatives are outlined here.\n\n1.\n\nStrengthen Linkages between the Formal and Informal Sectors\n\n78.\nThe  informal  sector  represents  the  primary  means  for  low-income  households  without\ncollateral to access loans for housing. Experience clearly demonstrates that CFIs are important\nand viable channels for lending to low-income households on a market-based and sustainable\nbasis.  However,  CFIs  also  suffer  from  a  lack  of  capital  to  expand  their  lending  operations.  To\nbridge this gap between the demand for housing loans and the financial resources available to\nCFIs, formal finance sector linkages with CFIs must be financially viable. Toward this objective,\nHFIs need to develop in-house expertise in microcredit lending, develop rating criteria for CFIs\nbased  on  their  lending  records  and  repayment  capacities,  standardize  and  streamline  loan\nprocessing procedures, and develop innovative financing structures such as escrow accounts,\nguarantee  funds,  and  revolving  funds  to  mitigate  the  potential  risks  associated  with  lending\nthrough  CFIs.  Additionally,  NHB  needs  to  encourage  HFCs  to  extend  credit  to  CFIs  by\nexpanding its CFI refinancing window. To strengthen linkages between the formal and informal\nhousing  finance  sectors,  TA  will  be  provided  for  CFIs  to  inform  and  educate  the  Borrowers\nabout  microfinance  and  specifically  the  lending  operations,  systems,  and  procedures  of  CFIs\ninvolved in housing finance.\n\n2.\n\nSupport Market-Based Housing Finance\n\nThe  Government  must  come  to  recognize  that  mandated  interest  rates  serve  as  a\n79.\ndisincentive  for  lending  to  lower  income  groups.  The  due  diligence  costs  for  smaller  loans\ncoupled  with  the  higher  risks  of  uncollateralized  lending  result  in  an  interest  rate  premium\nrelative  to  larger,  collateralized  loans.  Failure  to  recognize  this  basic  market  principle  has\nresulted in a severe shortage of financing available to lower income groups, and the financing\nthat is available commands usurious interest rates from informal moneylenders. While it is true\nthat  increased  competition  in  the  housing  finance  sector  has  contributed  to  the  virtual\nelimination  of  a  Government-defined  tiered  interest  rate  structure,  as  well  as  the  interest  rate\ncap of 12 percent for loans to microfinance institutions, mandated interest rates remain for EWS\nhouseholds.  Acknowledging  the  Government\u2019s  desire  to  ensure  that  housing  loans  are\naffordable  to  the  poorest  of  the  poor,  the  gap  between  existing  mandated  interest  rates  and\nmarket interest rates for EWS loans should be narrowed. The Project will also promote market-\n\n\f25\n\nbased  lending  to  CFIs  to  ensure  the  commercial  and  financial  viability  and  sustainability  of\nlinkages between formal and informal sector HFIs.\n\n3.\n\nRaise Corporate Governance Standards for Public Institutions\n\nLiberalization  of  India\u2019s  financial  sector  has  highlighted  the  need  for  public  sector\n80.\ninstitutions  to  raise  their  corporate  governance  standards  to  improve  their  financial  conditions,\nmanagement  practices,  and  operational  efficiencies.  For  HUDCO  and  NHB,  the  Project  will\nrequire that each institution take specific steps to improve corporate governance by establishing\nan  independent  board  audit  committee  with  specified  composition,  powers,  and  functions,\nboard-specified code of conduct and ethics, and reporting on corporate governance compliance\nas part of the annual report. As such HDFC and ICICI will be required to demonstrate that they\nare in compliance with the corporate governance standards prescribed in the Kumar Mangalam\nCommittee's Report.\n\n4.\n\nImprove Subproject Appraisal and Implementation\n\n81.\nThe financial condition of states across India is generally poor and consequently many\nstates are reluctant to offer guarantees on loans from both public and private sector institutions.\nGiven  the  significant  volume  of  state  lending  by  HUDCO,  this  situation  has  significant\nimplications  for  how  HUDCO  needs  to  improve  its  internal  appraisal  procedures  for  its  state-\nlevel  lending  operations.  In  addition,  at  the  subproject  level,  greater  attention  needs  to  be\ndirected by HUDCO to ensuring the financial viability of slum improvement schemes as well as\nincorporating  the  requisite  degree  of  community  participation  to  promote  greater  subproject\nownership,  cost  recovery,  and  sustainability.  The  requirement  that  HUDCO  establish  a  fully\noperational  PIU  is  expected  to  increase  HUDCO's  capacity  in  these  areas.  Additionally,\nassistance  is  envisaged  for  the  design,  appraisal,  and  implementation  of  slum  networking\nsubprojects,  with  particular  attention  directed  at  ensuring  that  the  preparation  of  such\nsubprojects is in accordance with ADB's social, environmental, and economic guidelines.\n\n5.\n\nImplement Foreclosure Regulations and Provisions\n\nAn  important  provision  of  the  amendment  to  the  NHB  Act,  enacted  in  May  2000,  is  to\n82.\nenable  HFIs  to  foreclose  on  mortgages  for  defaulting  loans  in  an  expeditious  manner  through\nmortgagee power of sale without  intervention.  However, to make these provisions operational\nrequires regulations under the amended NHB Act on procedures for mortgagee power of sale\nwithout  court  intervention,  HFI  debt  recovery  appellate  tribunals,  and  preservation  of  the\nexercise  of  mortgagee  power  of  sale  without  court  intervention  notwithstanding  judicial  review\nunder the NHB Act as amended.  As the apex regulatory body for the housing sector, NHB will\ntake  the  lead  in  preparing  these  regulations  for  the  concurrence  of  the  Government  and\nReserve Bank of India, as these are to be issued under the NHB Act, as amended.\n\n6.\n\nImprove the Mortgage Registration System\n\nTo  avoid  stamp  duties,  HFCs  across  India  have  increasingly  been  using  equitable\n83.\nmortgages  rather  than  the  traditional  or  standard  \"English\"  mortgage.  Equitable  mortgages,\nwhich  may  comprise  as  much  as  80  percent  of  the  market  for  new  mortgages  in  India,  are\nlegally recognized and enforceable under the Transfer of Property Act of 1882. Such mortgage\ninstruments  were  originally  created  to  facilitate  merchant  transactions  without  being  burdened\nby  high  stamp  duties.  Equitable  mortgages  are  not  registered,  but  the  original  title  deeds  are\ndeposited  with  the  mortgagee  who,  in  turn,  typically  provides  the  mortgagor  with  a  record  of\nreceipt. Potential issues or problems with the proliferation of equitable mortgages include (i) the\n\n\f26\n\npossibility  that  states  could  take  action  to  recoup  stamp  duties;  (ii)  their  use  is  restricted  to\ncertain geographic areas per the Transfer of Property Act; (iii) they do not allow for appointment\nof receivers or any foreclosure remedy without court intervention; (iv) there is lack of registration\nand  consequent  lack  of  public  notice;  and  (v)  they  cannot  be  securitized  without  being\nregistered  and  thereby  subjected  to  stamp  duties.  Given  the  complex  legal,  financial,  and\npolitical issues involved in addressing equitable mortgages, registration, and stamp duties, the\nProject  requires  that  a  working  group  comprising  representatives  of  Government,  NHB,\nHUDCO, HDFC, and ICICI be established to prepare a policy paper on improving the mortgage\nregistration system in India.\n\n7.\n\nExpand the Capital Market for Housing Finance\n\n84.\nNHB has played an important and essential role in addressing the many complex legal,\nregulatory, and financing issues associated with structuring the first pilot mortgage securitization\nissue  in  India.  To  build  upon  this  process,  NHB  must  assess  the  lessons  learned  from  this\nexperience  in  the  context  of  other  MBS  markets  in  Asia  as  well  as  in  developed  market\neconomies,  and  define  the  requisite  reform  measures  that  are  necessary  to  develop  India\u2019s\nMBS  market.  The  progressive  development  of  the  MBS  market  in  India  also  presents  some\nfundamental  questions  regarding  NHB\u2019s  future  role  in  the  sector.  NHB\u2019s  traditional  role  in\nrefinancing  HFC  mortgages,  for  example,  will  undoubtedly  change,  and  NHB  should  take\ndefinitive steps to operationalize and expand its CFI refinancing scheme. Whether NHB should\nassume the role of \u201cmarket maker,\u201d given its regulatory mandate, needs further consideration to\nensure  an  efficient  and  competitive  housing  finance  sector  in  India.  ADB  will  assist  NHB\naddress  many  of  these  complex  yet  fundamental  issues  related  to  the  future  growth  and\ndevelopment of India's housing finance sector.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nThe  shortage  of  housing  in  India  is  severe.  It  is  estimated  to  be  as  high  as  40  million\n85.\nunits. This directly impacts on the quality of life of low-income households, and the economically\nweaker sections of society. The lack of access to affordable housing finance is the most serious\nproblem  facing  low-income  households  in  India  who  wish  to  improve  their  living  conditions.\nThrough  the  different  lending  modalities,  the  Project  is  expected  to  directly  benefit  more  than\n270,000 low-income households, or more than 1.3 million people. The recycling or relending of\nADB  funds  will  maximize  the  impact  of  the  loan,  resulting  in  a  total  of  more  than  500,000\nhousing  loans  benefiting  approximately  2.7  million  people  over  the  loan  period.    Additionally,\nADB  funds  will  serve  to  leverage  financial  contributions  on  behalf  of  the  Borrowers  as  well  as\nthe low-income beneficiaries who will contribute land, labor, and household savings to housing\nimprovements. Once low-income families, who already have  stable incomes, obtain access to\nhousing  credit,  they  invest  several  times  the  original  loan  amount  in  improving  their  housing\nover time. This is in contrast to the conventional provision of housing finance to higher income\ngroups who move into a completed house and amortize the debt over time. From the financial\nperspective, the onlending arrangements are designed to be financially viable and sustainable\nthrough market-based lending whereby the financial intermediaries obtain a sufficient spread to\ncover their associated cost of operations.\n\n86.\nGiven  the  basic  linkage  between  improved  housing  and  human  welfare,  human\ndevelopment  will  be  enhanced  through  increased  availability  of  market-based  housing  finance\nto support new construction, home improvements, or home workplace activities. Although many\nof the benefits that will accrue as a result of improved housing conditions are difficult to quantify,\nmost are based on the connection to improved health and its relation to increased productivity.\nThe availability of loans for housing from CFIs and other financial intermediaries will also enable\n\n\f27\n\nlow-income  households  to  establish  credit.  In  addition,  basic  infrastructure  and  essential\nservices provided as part of the slum networking subprojects will improve the living and health\nconditions  of  slum  dwellers,  as  well  as  promote  partnerships  of  community  residents,  CFIs,\nNGOs, private enterprises, and municipal authorities.\n\nA.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n87.\nDetailed economic internal rate of return analyses have not been carried out for the slum\nnetworking or home workplace subprojects as neither their precise subproject locations nor final\nterms  and  uses  of  funds  is  available.  Additionally,  the  benefits  associated  with  these  types  of\nsubprojects  are  difficult  to  quantify.  Among  these  are  health  benefits  resulting  from  improved\nwater  supply,  sanitation,  drainage,  and  solid  waste  management;  safety  benefits  and  less\nproperty  damage  due  to  reduced  flooding  and  fires;  land  tenure  benefits  associated  with  the\nenhanced  security  of  tenure;  and  increased  productivity  and  access  to  education  due  to\nimproved  health  and  access  to  work  and  schools.  For  home  workplace  subprojects,  there  is\nalso  the  financial  benefit  to  the  individual  household  deriving  from  home  improvements  to\nsupport  income-generating  activities.  Although  property  value  increases  associated  with  slum\nnetworking  subprojects  are  often  used  to  calculate  improved  economic  opportunities  and\nbenefits, this methodology is not appropriate given that (i) property value increases are subject\nto various influences, including speculation; (ii) these increases may be regarded as a transfer\nbetween buyer and seller; and (iii) Government could impose a windfall tax on the increase, and\nsuch a tax, as a transfer, would not be measured as an economic benefit.\n\nB.\n\nFinancing Justification\n\n88.\nThe justification for lending long-term dollars to finance the rupee costs and cash flows\nrequired  in  India\u2019s  housing  finance  sector  is  based  on  a  number  of  considerations.  Housing\nfinance,  to  be  sustainable  and  available  to  all  segments  of  society,  requires  an  efficient  and\nfunctioning  long-term  debt  (bond)  market.    Such  a  market  does  not  exist  in  India  today.\nCurrently, long-term debt maturities in the private sector range from 3 to 7 years, and up to a\nmaximum  of  10  years  for  government  institutions.  However,  sufficient  investor  appetite  for\nsecurities over five years is lacking, and even the best issuers cannot count on raising funds on\na  sustainable  basis  for  maturities  over  3  to  5  years.  HFIs  are  forced  to  rely  on  short-term\ndeposits  (typically  with  a  36-month  maximum  term)  for  more  than  50  percent  of  their  funding,\nwith the balance coming from 3- to 5-year borrowings and some multilateral assistance. At the\nsame  time,  mortgages  are  normally  for  a  period  of  15,  sometimes  20,  years.  This  situation\ncreates an asset-liability mismatch for these financing institutions, exacerbated by the absence\nof  prepayment  penalties  and  the  lack  of  adjustable  rate  lending.  As  a  result,  virtually  all  HFIs\nwithout  proper  in-house  asset-liability  management  expertise  and  access  to  long-term  funding\nare at significant risk.\n\n89.\nThe  ADB  loan  is  not  providing  long-term  rupees  for  housing  finance.  Rather,  by  its\nstructure,  the  loan  is  creating  the  means  to  allow  commercial  sources  of  local  currency  to\nprovide  long-term  rupee  financing  to  the  participating  Borrowers.  The  long-term  rupee  funds\nallow  the  Borrowers  to  offer  affordable  interest  rates  and  longer  maturities.  The  \u201cswap\u201d\narrangement  achieves  this  by  removing  both  the  present  and  future  potential  adverse  risks  of\nforeign  exchange  rate  fluctuations,  interest  and  principle  repayments,  and  asset-liability\nmismatch. The underlying value of the ADB loan lies in its ability to generate long-term rupee\nfinancing  for  housing  and  the  associated  demonstration  value  of  the  need  to  create  domestic\nlong-term debt markets, given that foreign sources of finance are neither sustainable nor long-\nterm solution.\n\n\fC.\n\nSubsidies\n\n28\n\n90.\nSubsidies represent a very small part of the overall Project. The majority of project funds\nare  targeted  to  low-income  households  at  market  rates  of  interest.  Subsidies  are  not  required\nfor project funds that will be onlent through CFIs, enterprises, state and local bodies, or under\ndirect  lending.  Onlending  arrangements  are  structured  to  provide  the  Borrowers  and\nsubborrowers with sufficient spreads to cover their operational costs, risk premiums, and project\nmargins.  Subsidies  are  only  required,  in  part,  for  the  slum  networking  and  home  workplace\ncomponents of part B.\n\n91.\nFor  the  slum  networking  component,  capital  investments  will  be  financed  through  a\ncombination of loans from HUDCO to local government bodies, usually municipal corporations;\ncontributions  from  beneficiary  households;  and  grant  financing  from  central  and  state\ngovernments,  international  funding  agencies,  and  private  sector  sources.  Slum  networking\nsubprojects  are  typically  structured  to  include  approximately  70  percent  subsidization  of  the\ncapital  costs  associated  with  basic  infrastructure  improvements  including  water  supply,\nsanitation,  drainage,  street  lighting,  and  solid  waste  management;  government  grants  and\ncontributions from international funding agencies and the private sector constitute the principal\nsource  of  such  subsidies.  The  remaining  30  percent  of  capital  costs  is  borne  by  the  slum\nresidents who are organized into associations by CFIs, and contribute through a combination of\nan  up-front  payment  and  weekly  or  monthly  installments.  Depending  upon  the  financing\narrangements,  operation  and  maintenance  costs  are  often  partially  subsidized  with  provisions\nthat the local communities will assume an increasing share of operation and maintenance costs\nover time through different cost-recovery mechanisms. This cost-sharing arrangement will only\nbe possible, however, if communities feel they have ownership of the subprojects.\n\n92.\nFor  the  home  workplace  component  of  part  B,  subsidies  are  provided  by  state\ngovernments.  A  large  number  of  organized  workers  are  involved  in  weaving,  beedi  rolling,\nhandicrafts,  and  other  types  of  home-based  work  in  rural  and  semirural  India.  Virtually  all  of\nthese workers belong to unions or cooperatives, and are in the lowest income category. To be\neligible under the government-supported home workplace program, beneficiaries must earn at\nleast  50  percent  of  their  income  from  home-based  work.  The  current  program  provides\nsubsidies  from  state  governments  to  specified  implementing  agencies  that  include  unions,\ncooperatives,  and  other  state  apex  institutions.  The  cost  of  an  eligible  housing  unit,  whether\nbuilt by the implementing agency or by the individual, is estimated at Rs44,000 in urban areas\nand Rs35,000 in rural areas. The subsidy component is generally Rs20,000 per unit or about 45\npercent  of  its  cost.  The  beneficiary  contribution,  through  any  combination  of  cash,  land,\nmaterials,  and  labor,  is  about  10  percent.  HUDCO  provides  loans  through  cooperatives  to\nindividual  households  for  the  remaining  45  percent.  State  subsidies  are  released  only  upon\nissuance of the HUDCO loan. The subsidies under the home workplace component are justified\ndue  to  the  very  low  incomes  of  the  beneficiaries,  and  the  fact  that  a  great  number  of  home\nworkers are women.\n\nD.\n\nAffordability\n\n93.\nAn affordability analysis was conducted for parts A and C of the Project to ensure that\nthe  loans  provided  under  the  different  project  components  will  not  create  an  undue  financial\nburden  on  the  ultimate  beneficiaries.  The  results  of  the  analysis  are  summarized  in  Appendix\n10.  Loan  repayment  schedules  for  different  loan  sizes  were  calculated  on  a  monthly  basis  for\neach  of  the  components  and  compared  with  the  maximum  household  income  of  EWS,  low-\nincome  group  (LIG)  and  middle-income  group  (MIG)  households.  Affordability  limits  were\ndefined as the maximum percentage of monthly household income that households could apply\n\n\f29\n\nto  repay  the  loan,  namely  15  percent  for  EWS,  20  percent  for  LIG,  and  30  percent  for  MIG\nhouseholds. The graduated scale is due to the fact that very low-income households have less\ndisposable  income  for  housing  expenses,  as  a  percentage  of  their  total  incomes,  than  higher\nincome households.\n\nUnder  part  A,  which  will  facilitate  access  to  housing  finance  through  financial\n94.\nintermediaries,  a  repayment  period  of  five  years  and  an  annual  interest  rate  of  18  percent  is\nassumed. The interest rate is a conservative estimate and includes the interest rate charged by\nthe  Borrowers  to  the  intermediary  plus  the  spread  charged  from  the  intermediary  to  the  final\nborrowers.  The  results  of  the  analysis  demonstrate  that  borrowers  of  the  EWS  group  will  be\nable to afford a loan up to Rs15,000. LIG borrowers will be able to borrow up to Rs45,000 and\nMIG  households  with  an  income  of  up  to  Rs7,000  per  month  will  be  able  to  borrow  up  to\nRs80,000.\n\n95.\nFor the direct lending component of part C, the interest rate is assumed to be 13 percent\nper  annum  with  a  15-year  repayment  period.  While  the  affordable  percentages  of  income  for\neach  income  group  are  assumed  to  be  the  same  as  those  in  part  A,  in  practice  many  HFCs\napply a flat rate of 30 percent of income when they analyze the repayment capacity of potential\nborrowers. The resulting analysis shows that EWS households will not be able to access loans\nunder  this  component.  LIG  households  will  be  able  to  afford  loans  up  to  Rs90,000,  and  MIG\nhouseholds  earning  up  to  Rs7,000  per  month  will  be  able  to  access  loans  of  up  to  about\nRs165,000. The results of the analysis demonstrates that part C of the Project will allow many\nlow- and moderate-income households direct access to market rate loans for construction and\nimprovement of their houses.\n\nE.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n96.\nLending  to  low-income  households  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  reduction  of\npoverty. Access to housing finance will reinforce a process of steady incremental improvements\nin household incomes by providing the means to finance the construction of better living, as well\nas home workplace conditions that, in turn, will increase household stability by providing a fixed\nasset  of  considerable  value  that  can  be  used  to  safeguard  household  interests.  To  the  extent\nthat housing loans are made to households with home- based workers (in most cases women),\nthe  impact  on  poverty  reduction  will  be  significant.    Lending  through  worker  cooperatives  and\nsocieties under part B, such as the Sarvodaya Sangh network of handicraft workers, will have a\nsimilarly  strong  impact  on  reducing  poverty.  Low-income  state  and  local  employees,  such  as\nnurses  and  teachers  who  need  to  live  close  to  their  work,  will  benefit  from  savings  in\ntransportation  costs  and  time  spent  commuting.    Improved  water  supply,  sanitation,  drainage,\nand  footpaths  under  the  slum  networking  component  will  improve  the  health,  safety,  and\nproductivity  of  slum  residents.  Individual  direct  lending  will  have  positive  impacts  on  poverty\nreduction  to  the  extent  that  household  living  conditions,  health,  productivity,  and  access  to\nemployment are improved.\n\nF.\n\nRisks\n\n97.\nOne of the potential risks related to the ability of HUDCO, ICICI, and HDFC to increase\ntheir lending to CFIs is the absence of bankable collateral for loan security. The majority of CFIs\ndo  not  have  substantial  real  collateral,  nor  do  their  members  have  registered  titles  to  land.\nWhere individual or group land titles are not available, HUDCO has required an interest- bearing\ncash  deposit  from  10  to  15  percent  of  the  loan,  depending  on  the  track  record,  loan  recovery\nmechanisms,  and  experience  of  the  CFI.  These  funds  must  come  from  the  savings  of  their\nmembers,  which  is  a  burden  on  the  CFI  membership.  In  contrast  to  the  present  policy,  the\n\n\f30\n\nProject is proposing that superior lending and repayment track records be taken as the principal\ncriteria for extending loans to established CFIs.  The Borrowers must therefore closely monitor\nthe financial positions as well as the absorptive capacities of partner CFIs.\n\n98.\nRegarding  slum  networking  schemes,  although  most  states  in  India  have  slum\nimprovement  or  slum  clearance  boards,  they  have  a  poor  performance  record  in  terms  of\npromoting community participation and establishing partnerships with CFIs, NGOs, community\nresidents, local government authorities, and the private sector.  Additionally, their ability to use\nand  leverage  financial  resources  efficiently,  and  to  promote  cost  recovery  has  largely  been\nunsuccessful.    The  Project\u2019s  partnership  slum  networking  approach  is  therefore  a  significant\ndeparture  from  the  traditional  approach  to  slum  improvement.  However,  selected  subprojects\nwill  take  more  time  to  appraise,  design,  and  implement.  The  success  of  this  component  will\ntherefore require a major commitment and educational effort on behalf of HUDCO.\n\n99.\nEach  of  the  Borrowers  must  cover  the  foreign  exchange  risk  associated  with  their\nrespective  loans.  To  avoid  a  negative  spread  on  their  loans,  the  Borrowers  will  have  to\nnegotiate beneficial agreements with swap partners. There is a risk associated with interest rate\nmovements  in  the  domestic  capital  markets  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  cost  of  ADB  funds.  However,  a\nmitigating  factor  is  the  relatively  long  maturity  of  the  ADB  funds  which  will  allow  all  the\nBorrowers to better balance the maturities of their assets and liabilities.\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  and  the  Borrowers  have  given  the  following  specific  assurances,  in\n\n100.\naddition to the standard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  Government  and  the  Borrowers  will  execute  the  policy  and  institutional\naction plan as agreed to by the Government, Borrowers, and ADB.\n\nEach Borrower will ensure that it is in compliance at all times with the prudential\nnorms  issued  by  the  regulatory  authorities,  including  capital  adequacy,  income\nrecognition, classification, and provisioning for nonperforming assets.\n\nEach Borrower will maintain a debt-equity ratio no higher than 12 to 1 and a debt\nservice  coverage  ratio  of  at  least  1.1,  and  confirm  that  it  has  no  arrears  in\nrepayment of its current debt obligations.\n\nNo  withdrawals  will  be  made  from  the  loan  account  of  a  Borrower,  until  an\nopinion  is  received  by  ADB  from  an  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB,  in  form  and\nsubstance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  that  certifies  that  the  Borrower  is  in  compliance\nwith  prudential  norms,  debt  service  coverage  ratio,  and  debt-equity  ratio\nspecified in the assurances.\n\nEach  Borrower  will  select  subprojects  and  subborrowers  for  purposes  of\nonlending to state and local bodies under part A of the Project only in states and\nunion territories which have undertaken or are undertaking measures to put into\nplace  progressive  urban  land  ceiling  laws  and/or  amend  state  rent  control\nlegislation.\n\n\f(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n31\n\nEach  Borrower  will  ensure  that  subloans  are  only  made  available  to  eligible\nsubborrowers, including those who are not in default, individually or collectively,\non any prior loan.\n\nEach  Borrower  will  submit  to  ADB,  for  prior  approval,  its  first  two  subprojects\nunder  each  project  component  to  be  financed  under  the  loan;  and  HUDCO  will\nsubmit to ADB for prior approval all subprojects under part B of the Project.\n\n(viii)  Each  Borrower  will  ensure  that  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  loan  shall\nmeet  the  requirements  of  ADB's  guidelines  on  environmental  and  social\nassessment and management measures.\n\nEach Borrower will ensure that subprojects involving involuntary resettlement are\neither  eliminated,  or  subloans  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB's\ninvoluntary  resettlement  policy  and  ADB's  Handbook  on  Resettlement,  as\namended from time to time.\n\nEach  Borrower  will  ensure  that  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  loan\nobserve  subloan  agreements,  criteria,  and  subloan  application  procedures\nacceptable  to  ADB,  and  no  sublending  is  based  on  comfort  letters  unless  such\ncriteria is approved by the Government and is acceptable to ADB.\n\nEach Borrower will observe subloan financing criteria that include maximum ADB\nfinancing  of  80  percent  of  the  subloan(s)  provided  by  the  Borrower  for  lending\nand  refinancing  under  part  C,  and  for  lending  to  public  and  private  enterprises\nand to state and local bodies under part A of the Project; the remaining Project\ncomponents will be eligible for 100 percent ADB financing.\n\n(xii)  NHB  will  ensure  that  all  refinancing  under  part  C  of  the  Project  is  directed  to\nhousing finance companies approved by NHB for refinancing, with the exception\nof HUDCO, HDFC, and ICICI.\n\n(xiii)  NHB will ensure that 20 percent of the loan to NHB, equivalent to $8 million, is\n\ndirected to refinancing HFC lending to CFIs.\n\n(xiv)  Each  Borrower  will  take  all  necessary  measures  satisfactory  to  ADB  to  ensure\nthat  subloan  repayments,  net  of  ADB  loan  repayments,  are  relent  through  the\nsame lending  channels and to the same beneficiary groups specified under  the\nProject, during the loan period.\n\n(xv)  Each  Borrower  will  ensure  that  the  foreign  exchange  risk  under  the  Loan\nthrough  an  appropriate  swap  or  other  hedging\n\nAgreement \narrangement in form and substance satisfactory to ADB.\n\nis  hedged \n\nB.\n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness\n\n101.

Studies  in  the  1980s  showed  that  only  10  to  15  percent  of  housing  finance  in\ndeveloping countries came from formal institutions,  as such institutions cater mainly to middle-\nand  high-income  households.  Although  there  is  evidence  suggesting  that  the  availability  of\nhousing finance from formal sources has increased, formal institutions in India are not likely to\naccount for much over 20 percent. Estimates of the share of various sources of finance in India\nfor the construction of new buildings or for financing additions to existing buildings are provided\nin tables A2.1 and A2.2.\n\nOne striking feature of these data is that people largely depend on their own funds for\n2.\nfinancing  new  housing  construction  and  home  improvements.  The  dependence  on  own  funds\nranges from about 65 to 70 percent in the case of new houses and from about 75 to 85 percent\nin  the  case  of  additions  to  existing  buildings.  Although  the  dependence  on  own  funds  is\ngenerally  higher  in    rural  areas,  this  is  not  true  in  the  case  of  kutcha  (temporary)  dwellings.\nThose  building  kutcha  dwellings  are  the  poorest  segment  of  the  population  with  low  personal\nsavings  and  thus  are  more  dependent  on  moneylenders.  In  the  case  of  new  kutcha  buildings\nthe dependence on moneylenders is as high as 20 percent. According to these data, the share\nof formal sector finance varies from about 22 percent (for new buildings) in urban areas to less\nthan 8 percent (for additions and alterations) in rural areas. For the numbers presented in tables\nA2.1  and  A2.2,  it  is  assumed  \"other  sources  of  finance\"  are  from  the  \"formal\"  sector.    To  the\nextent that these are \"informal\" sources, the share of the formal sector is even lower.\n\nB.\n\nFormal and Informal Sources of Finance\n\nOf  the  estimated  Rs1,500  billion  required  for  housing  during  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan,\n3.\nonly about Rs380 billion (about 25 percent) is expected to come from the formal sector. Sources\nof housing finance can broadly be classified into formal and informal. Informal sources comprise\nself-finance,  including  money  from  friends  and  relatives,  moneylenders,  suppliers'  credit  and\nrotating credit societies (chit funds/vishis).\n\n4.\nThe  formal  housing  finance  sector  in  India  consists  of  specialized  housing  finance\ninstitutions  such  as  National  Housing  Bank  (NHB),  Housing  and  Urban  Development\nCorporation (HUDCO), housing finance companies (HFCs), and cooperative housing societies;\ngeneral  financing  institutions  such  as  insurance  companies,  commercial  banks,  and  provident\nfunds;  and  budgetary  allocations  of  the  central  and  state  governments.  Due  to  the  earlier\nwelfare  approach  to  housing  and  to  financial    regulations,  many  of  the  providers  and  users  of\nhousing  finance  were  government  and/or  public  sector  agencies.  Somewhere  between  these\ntwo  categories  are  the  microfinance  or  community-based  finance  institutions  (CFIs).    For  the\npurpose of this analysis we will classify these as informal sector institutions.\n\nC.\n\nThe Informal Housing Finance Sector\n\nAs  indicated  in  tables  A2.1  and  A2.2,  informal  sources  account  for  the  majority  of\n\n5.\nhousing finance in India. A description of four different informal sources of finance follows.\n\n\fTable A2.1: Shares of Different Sources of Finance  for New Buildings\n(percent)\n\nNew Buildings\n\nSource\n\nPuccaa\n\nSemi-puccab\n\nKutchac\n\nAll\n\nTotal\n\nUrban\n\nRural\n\nUrban\n\nRural\n\nUrban\n\nRural\n\nUrban\n\nRural\n\n69.0\n\n72.6\n\n68.9\n\n72.2\n\n70.1\n\nOwn sources\n\nMoney lenders\n\nFriends and relatives\n\nOther sources\n\nCooperative\n\n1.4\n\n7.1\n\n4.0\n\n1.8\n\n2.7\n\n1.9\n\n0.9\n\n7.2\n\n6.7\n\n4.9\n\n2.4\n\n4.2\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.2\n\nGovt. financial institutions\n\n11.1\n\nNon Govt. financial institutions\n\nGovt. non financial institutions\n\nNon Govt. nonfinancial\ninstitutions\n\nInformal\n\nFormal\n\n77.5\n\n22.5\n\n86.4\n\n13.6\n\na = permanent, b = semi-permanent, c = temporary.\nSource: Sarvekshana. 1999.

This  imposes  an  obvious  constraint  on  translating  the  potential\ndemand for housing. At the lower income levels, the amount of money, on  average, that people\nneed to acquire or improve a house, is relatively small and cannot be economically provided by\nlarge,  formal  HFCs.  Channeling  housing  finance  to  low-income  households  often  requires\ncommunity-based financial intermediaries that can afford to issue and service small loans.\n\n2.\n\nSuppliers' Credits\n\n7.\nUnder this arrangement, the household constructs the house on credit, and is charged\ninterest rates, typically between 24 percent and 36 percent per year, by the supplier of building\nmaterials.  The  repayment  period  is  very  short,  usually  between  12  and  20  months.  Physical\nassets  such  as  gold  and  land  are  often  used  as  collateral.  With  these  high  interest  rates  and\nshort  repayment  periods,  the  ability  to  meet  monthly  payments,  even  for  very  small  loans,  is\nlimited.\n\n3.\n\nRotating Credit Societies   \n\n8.\nThese go by various names in different parts of the country, such as chit funds or vishis,\nbut the principle is essentially the same. A group of people regularly subscribe to the scheme,\nand  await  their  turn  to  access  the  accumulated  pool.  Clearly,  the  viability  of  such  schemes\ndepends heavily on the mutual trust  among the members of the group. For that reason, these\ninstitutions tend to be exclusive and limited to groups of people who have a strong social affinity\nto each other. Their role in the  provision of housing finance is therefore limited.\n\n4.\n\nCommunity-Based Financial Institutions\n\nCFIs provide small loans with market-based interest rates to low-income households. As\n9.\ninstitutions, they combine the lending approach of the formal HFCs, but with the monitoring and\nenforcement mechanisms of communities. This allows them to keep default rates, and therefore\ntheir  interest  rates  relatively  low.  Some  of  the  larger  CFIs,  such  as  the  SEWA  Bank  of\nAhmedabad,  are  able  to  directly  mobilize  funds  through  their  deposit  schemes,  as  well  as\nthrough equity capital. In general, CFIs have problems mobilizing funds. However, because of\ntheir potential strengths in the lending aspect of the business, CFIs can be an effective channel\nof funds from the formal sector to low-income borrowers.\n\n5.\n\nInterest Rates in the Informal Sector\n\n10.\nThere is quite a variation across the CFIs as well as within a particular CFI with respect\nto different interest rate schemes. According to the project survey, interest rates were found to\nrange  between  15  and  18  percent  per  annum,  with  some  CFIs  charging  interest  rates  of  24\npercent  or  more;  the  most  common  among  CFI  lending  were  15  percent,  18  percent,  24\npercent,  and  more  than  24  percent.  More  than  half  of  the  economically  weaker  section\nborrowers  and  29  percent  of  low-income  group  borrowers  had  obtained  loans  at  15  percent.\nThe highest percentage of loans to middle-income group borrowers was made at rates greater\nthan  24  percent.  The  most  common  loan  maturity  periods  were  from  3-5  years.  Despite  the\nshort  maturity  and  high  interest  rates,  repayment  records  are  extremely  high.  The  lowest\nrepayment rate among mature CFIs was 96 percent.\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 3\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE HOUSING SECTOR IN INDIA, 1983 \u2013 2000\n($ million)\n\nYear\nApproved\n\nSource\n\nAmount\n\nProject\nA.\n\nB.\n\nC.\n\nHousing Projects-Loan Financed\nUSAID Program \u2013 HDFC\nUSAID \u2013 NHB\nUSAID-FIRE \u2013 HUDCO\nKfW I \u2013 HDFC & HUDCO\nKfW II \u2013 HUDCO\nWorld Bank \u2013 HDFC\nInternational Finance Corp. \u2013 HDFC\nOECF \u2013 NHB\nCDC \u2013 HDFC\nKarnataka Urban Infras.

In  January  1999,  the  Planning  Commission  updated  the  income\nbrackets for the respective groups as follows: EWS households have monthly incomes of less\nthan  Rs2,500  or  $62;  LIG  households  have  monthly  incomes  between  Rs2,500  and  Rs5,700\n(about $142); MIG households have monthly incomes between Rs5,700 and Rs10,000 (about\n$250); and HIG households have monthly incomes of Rs10,000 and above.\n\nB.   \n\nLow-Income Households\n\n2. \nFor the purposes of the Project, low-income households are defined as households with\nmonthly incomes of Rs7,000 (about $165) or less. This definition is approximately equivalent to\nan  income  of  $1/capita/day  at  current  exchange  rates  for  a  family  of  five.  The  basis  for  this\ndefinition is the desire to identify a target beneficiary group under the Project that has little or no\naccess  to  housing  finance  through  formal  housing  finance  institutions.  In  relation  to  the\nGovernment\u2019s  income  classification  categories,  low-income  households  encompass  the  lower\none third of MIG households and below.\n\nC. \n\nIncome Distribution Data\n\n3. \nTo  estimate  where  the  various  income  groups  are  located  on  the  national  income\ndistribution scale, data from the National Council on Applied Economic Research (NCAER) was\nreviewed  and  analyzed.    NCAER  carries  out  an  annual  survey  of  households,  the  Market\nInformation  Survey  of  Households.  The  sample  for  this  survey  consists  of  some  275,000\nhouseholds  distributed  across  the  country.  The  main  focus  of  the  survey  is  household\nexpenditure on several categories of consumer goods, durable and expendable. A portion of the\ndata  used  in  this  analysis  is  collected  from  each  household  on  its  gross  income.  Sample\nhouseholds are classified into five income categories based on 1995/96 prices, but for purposes\nof the Project, the income ranges were updated to 2000 prices using the consumer price index.\nThe categories  are not of equal size, and the HIG income class is open-ended.  Based on the\nsample  distribution  of  households  across  income  classes,  the  total  number  of  households  in\neach income category for urban areas has been estimated. This was also done for low-income\nhouseholds  as defined above.\n\nD. \n\nIncome Profiles of Households\n\n4. \nAccording  to  the  data,  EWS  families  earning  up  to  Rs2,500  per  month  comprise  some\n6.3 million households, which are at or below the 12th percentile in 2000. LIG households are\nthe largest group, about 18.8 million households, the maximum income of which (Rs5,700 per\nmonth)  is  at  the  49th  percentile.  With  monthly  incomes  from  Rs5,700  to  Rs10,000,  MIG\nhouseholds number 15.2 million, with the maximum income (Rs10,000 per month) at the 78th\npercentile.  At  Rs7,000  per  month,  the  maximum  income  of  LIH  households  is  at  the  61st\npercentile.\n\n5. \nAlthough  it  is  estimated  that  some  60  percent  of  the  urban  population  earn  less  than\nRs7,000 per month, this figure must considered with caution for several reasons. First, the data\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 5, page 2\n\nis  based  on  income  that  is  always  difficult  to  determine.  Due  largely  to  tax  reasons,  many\nfamilies, when surveyed, purposely understate their income. In the low-income brackets, where\ndisposable income is minimal or nonexistent, expenditure data is often a better measure of total\nincome.  Secondly,  a  substantial  portion  of  income  of  low-income  households  is  often  in  kind\nrather  than  cash,  and  therefore  goes  undeclared.  Thirdly,  it  is  very  difficult  to  update  income\ndistribution data without adequate sample surveys each year. While the consumer price index\nwas used to update the data, another index such as a wage and salary index could have also\nbeen used. Given the lack of a recent household income and expenditure survey as well as the\nforegoing  qualifications,  the  estimate  of  low-income  households  earning  less  than  a  dollar  per\nday per capita could be as low as the 50th percentile.\n\n\fTOTAL PROJECT COST AND IMPACT\n\nTable A6.1: Total Project cost\nby Lending Channel and Leveraging Impact\n\nProject Part\n\nADB Loan\nAmounta\n\nBorrower\nContributionb\n\nTotal Funds\nfor Lendingc\n\nBeneficiary\nContributiond\n\nProject\nCost\n\n A.

A step-by-step example is presented.\n\n2. \nStep  1.  ADB  provides  a  foreign  exchange  (FX)  loan  of  $100  million  for  20  years  to\nBorrower  A  against  which  Borrower  A,  wishes  to  obtain  rupee  funding  for  20  years.  ADB\ncharges market-based loan (MBL) rate (LIBOR based) plus 60 basis points (bp) on it\u2019s loan (to\nthe extent there is a difference in the spreads, there is a cost likely to be no more than 5-10 bp\nand minimal additional risk).\n\n3. \nStep  2.  Borrower  A  draws  down  $20  million  and  places  these  finds  on  deposit  with  an\nIndian bank (with an offshore branch) for 20 years obtaining LIBOR plus 60 bp on its deposit.\nThus, the interest payments the Borrower pays to ADB, and that received on the deposit, match,\nand therefore there is no dollar interest rate cost or risk to the borrower.\n\n4. \nStep 3. In consideration of this dollar deposit, the Indian bank (called the \u201cswap\u201d bank)\npurchases Borrower A\u2019s 20-year rupee bond in the amount equivalent to $20 million. The $/Re\nexchange  rate  is  fixed  at  the  time  of  deposit/rupee  bond  issue  (i.e.,  at  42  to  $1,  the  rupee\nequivalent  is  Rs840  million)  and  remains  fixed  throughout  the  20-year  period.  Thus,  neither\nparty to the transaction bears an exchange risk.\n\nStep 4. The dollar deposit with the swap bank secures it\u2019s purchase of the rupee bonds,\n5. \nthus  there  is  no  credit  risk  from  the  Borrower.  The  Borrower  is  thus  able  to  obtain  attractive\nrates for it\u2019s various bond issuances. The interest rate on the rupee bonds is fixed, for example,\nfor  7  years  at  a  determined  spread  over  7-year  Government  securities;  this  \u201cbench  mark\u201d  is\nreset every 7 years.\n\n6. \nStep 5. The interest rate payment dates on the dollar deposit, the rupee bonds, and the\nADB loan are all matched. The Borrower pays ADB interest with the interest it receives from the\ndollar deposit. The Borrower pays the \u201cswap\u201d bank interest on it\u2019s rupee bonds out of it\u2019s cash\nflow (there is a rupee interest payment risk here to the swap bank but it could partially off set\nany noninterest payment by the Borrower, with the dollar interest payment. This could lead to, in\na  worst  case  scenario,  the  Borrower  defaulting  on  it\u2019s  interest  payment  to  ADB,  which  could\ninvolve ADB calling on it\u2019s guarantee from the Government of India).\n\n7. \nStep 6. Principal payments on the ADB loan, the rupee bonds, and the maturity periods\non  the  dollar  deposit  (at  interest  adjustment  dates)  also  match.  Thus,  when  the  principal\npayment is due on the bonds, once the swap bank receives payment, it releases an equivalent\namount of dollars to the Borrower, who then pays ADB.\n\nStep 7. The transaction is repeated with the swap bank, for each drawdown of the ADB\n8. \nloan by the Borrower. The \u201cswap\u201c bank could change, depending on negotiations between these\nparties  regarding  the  rupee  borrowing  cost,  but  with  any  swap  bank,  the  interest  rate  on  the\ndollar  deposit  and  the  ADB  loan  would  remain  the  same,  as  would  the  interest  and  principal\npayment  dates  continuing  to  match  the  dollar  and  rupee  payments.  New  dollar  deposit  would\nsecure the new rupee bond issuance.\n\n9. \nStep  8.  This  system  allows  the  Borrower  to  obtain  20-year  rupee  funding,  which  is\ncurrently  not  available  in  the  domestic  market.  It  also  allows  the  Borrower  to  obtain  the  most\nattractive rates at the existing market. It allows the swap bank to obtain long-term dollars that it\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 8, page 2\n\nmay need to service it\u2019s clients and/or treasury needs, which would otherwise not be available\nand at attractive (ADB) rates. There is no $/Re exchange rate risk, minimal, if any dollar interest\nrate cost/risk, and no principal payment risk to any party involved in the transaction. Ultimately\nin any worst case scenario, the Government would have to pay ADB under it\u2019s guarantee and\nthus have exposure to the Borrower.\n\nFigure A8.1: Flow Chart of Representative Financing Structure\n\n(b) Guarantee for $100 million loan\n\nADB\n\n(\na\n)\n \nL\no\na\nn\n \no\nf\n \n$\n1\n0\n0\n \nm\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\no\nn\n\n(\nf\n)\n \n\nD\no\n\nl\nl\n\na\nr\n \nl\no\na\nn\n \nr\ne\np\na\ny\nm\ne\nn\nt\n \nt\no\n \nA\nD\nB\n\n(c) Dollar placement\n\n(d) Rupee equivalent of ADB loan\n\nBorrower A\n\n(e) Redemption of bonds/repayment of loan in rupees\n\n(g) Pay equivalent dollar deposit of (e)\n\nn\na\no\nl\n \n\nB\nD\nA\n\n \nf\no\n \nt\nn\ne\nm\ny\na\np\ne\nR\n\n \n)\nh\n(\n\ns\nr\na\n\nl\nl\n\no\nd\n \nn\n\ni\n\nGOI\n\n)\nh\n(\n \n \n \n \n \n\nSwap\nCounter\nParty\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 9, page 1\n\nSUMMARY OF SURVEY OF CFIs AND NGOs AND THEIR MEMBERS ON\nHOUSING FINANCE AND DELIVERY MECHANISMS\n\nA.   \n\nIntroduction\n\nA  major  component  of  the  Project  will  be  to  provide  housing  finance  to  low-income\n1.\nhouseholds through  community  finance institutions (CFIs) working in partnership with Housing\nand  Urban  Development  Corporation  (HUDCO).  Although  general  information  exists  on  the\nhousing  finance  needs  of  economically  weaker  section  (EWS)  and  low-income  group  (LIG)\nhouseholds,  there  is  only  limited  information  about  the  characteristics  and  housing  finance\nneeds of CFI members likely to participate in the Project. The current understanding of housing\nfinance needs and preferred loan conditions for low-income households in both urban and rural\nareas  needs  to  be  improved.  A  rapid  coordinated  set  of  consumer  surveys  was  implemented\nduring  the  feasibility  study  to  provide  this  information.  A  summary  of  the  survey  results  and\nanalysis is presented here.\n\n1.   \n\nSurvey Objectives\n\n(i) \n\nto  assess \n\nThe basic objectives of the surveys of CFIs, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and\n2.\nlow-income  households  were \nlow-income  households'  socioeconomic\ncharacteristics, their housing needs, and their potential demand for housing finance in different\nareas  of  the  country;  (ii)  to  develop  an  understanding  of  low-income  households  capacity  to\nabsorb  housing  finance;  (iii)  to  identify  existing  sources  and  constraints  related  to  housing\nfinance  for  low-income  households;  (iv)  to  explore  different  forms  of  collateral  for  low-income\nhousing loans; (v) to assess technical and capacity-building support required for loan-financed\nhousing improvements; and (vi) to assess the impact of improved housing on poverty reduction\nand the condition of women.\n\n2.    Brief Description of the Coordinated Surveys\n\n3.\nThe  coordinated  set  of  consumer  surveys  included  a  sample  household  survey,  case\nstudies, six consumer workshops, and three NGOs and CFI workshops in different parts of the\ncountry.\n\na. \n\nSample Household Survey\n\nA  sample  household  survey  was  designed  to  obtain  information  about  EWS,  LIG,  and\n4.\nmiddle-income  group  (MIG)  households  from  the  members  of  six  major  CFIs.  These  CFIs\nincluded  DHAN  Foundation,  SHARE,  SPMS,  SIDA,  Indcare  Trust,  and  Shramik  Bharti.  The\nselection  of  households  to  be  surveyed  was  based  on  a  purposive  sampling  approach  to\nexpedite  survey  implementation  and  to  ensure  that  adequate  data  were  obtained  about  the\ndifferent  household  types.  The  planned  (and  actual)  distribution  of  the  500  (512)  surveyed\nhouseholds were as follows:\n\n  By Income\n\nBy Location\n\nBy Previous Access to Housing Loans\n\n  EWS - 200  (192)\n\nUrban - 250  (280)\n\nBorrowers - 100  (106)\n\n  LIG - 200  (238)\n\nRural - 250  (232)\n\nNonborrowers - 400  (406)\n\n  MIG - 100   (82)\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\n5.\nThe selected distribution of survey households has produced a very good cross-section\nof  potential  project  beneficiaries.  Survey  households  included  rural  and  urban  self-help  group\n(SHG)  members  and  borrowers,  slum  dwellers,  and  home  workers,  all  with  an  ample\nrepresentation  of  women.  The  survey  questionnaire  focused  on  obtaining  relevant  information\non  the  housing  need,  demand,  and  absorptive  capacity  of  these  households.  The  DHAN\nFoundation was responsible for overall coordination and implementation of this survey.\n\nb.   \n\nHousehold Case Studies\n\nFifty household case studies were undertaken as the second part of the set of surveys.\n6.\nThe purpose of the case studies was to deepen current understanding about the characteristics\nand  housing  situation  of  low-income  households,  their  potential  demand  for  housing  finance,\nand the  conditions under which the provision of housing finance would be most effective. The\npurposive case study sample included 18 EWS households, 24 LIG, and 8 MIG. A professional\nteam  from  DHAN  Foundation  coordinated  the  implementation  of  these  surveys  with  help  from\neach of the participating CFIs.\n\nc.     Consumer Workshops\n\n7.\nOne-day consumer workshops were held in Kanpur, Delhi, Kottayam, Tirupati, Madurai,\nand Hyderabad at the end of the survey fieldwork. Participants at these workshops were urban\nand rural households from the three income categories of EWS, LIG, and MIG. They included\nborrowers  and  potential  borrowers  of  housing  finance  within  each  income  group.  Financial\nrepresentatives  from  local  housing  finance  institutions  (HFIs)  attended  two  of  the  workshops.\nWorkshop discussions focused on the relevance of microfinance to housing finance, preferred\nhousing  products,  consumer  experience  with  current  lending  terms  and  conditions,  issues  of\ncollateral  and  security,  importance  of  housing  as  a  workplace,  forecasting  of  demand  for\nhousing  finance,  establishing  the  need  for  technical  and  material  support,  and  identifying\nimprovements to loan processing.\n\nd.     NGO and CFI Consultation Workshops\n\nThree  one-day  consultation  workshops  were  held  with  NGOs  and  CFIs  in  Calcutta,\n8.\nChennai, and Mumbai. A total of 90 NGO and CFIs attended the three workshops. The purpose\nof the workshops was to determine potential demand for housing finance through CFIs and the\namount of bulk lending required through the HUDCO lending window, and to discuss measures\nto increase the flexibility and effectiveness of this type of lending.\n\nB.\n\nKey Findings from the Sample Household Survey\n\nResults from the sample household survey include (i) data on the socioeconomic profiles\n9.\nand  characteristics  of  the  client  population;  (ii)  an  assessment  of  the  housing  need,  demand,\nand  absorptive  capacity  of  potential  client  households  as  expressed  through  their  willingness\nand  ability  to  make  investments,  use  credit,  and  improve  their  housing  situation;  and  (iii)  an\nassessment  of  the  impact  of  improved  housing  conditions  on  the  reduction  of  poverty  and\nsituation of women.\n\n1.   \n\nSocioeconomic Profiles and Characteristics of the Client Population\n\n10.\nSurvey activities focused on CFI members who will make up the majority of low-income\nhouseholds  borrowers  under  the  Project.  The  survey  sample  included  households  from  the\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\nthree  income  groups  of  EWS,  LIG,  and  MIG;  households  from  urban  and  rural  areas;  existing\nborrowers and potential borrowers of housing finance; households working at home; private and\npublic  sector  workers;  etc.  The  broad  geographic  base  of  the  survey  has  provided  a  good\noverall profile of potential project beneficiaries.\n\na.    Average Household Size\n\n11.\nThe average household size for the entire sample was 4.5. Basically similar results were\nobtained  for  all  income  and  geographic  categories  except  LIG  households  in  rural  areas.  The\naverage  household  size  for  this  group  was  substantially  higher  at  5.9.  At  the  same  time,  MIG\nhouseholds  in  rural  areas  had  the  lowest  average  household  size  of  4.0.  One  possible\nexplanation  for  this  situation  is  that  the  larger  household  size  enables  some  rural  EWS\nhouseholds to become LIG due to additional family workers. The larger household size among\nrural LIG also had an impact on the average size of borrower households (5.2) in this group.\n\nb.     Age of the Head of Household\n\n12.\nSurvey  results  showed  that  there  was  little  difference  between  the  average  age  of\nhousehold  heads  of  borrower  and  potential  borrower  households.  Roughly  a  third  of  the\nhousehold  heads  in  both  categories  were  less  than  36  years  old.  Another  36  percent  of  the\nhousehold heads for borrowers and 40 percent for potential borrowers were between 36 and 40\nyears of age, the most common age group. Roughly 11 percent of the household heads in both\ngroups were more than 50 years old.\n\nc.     Primary Occupations\n\n13.\nThe  most  common  primary  occupations  for  surveyed  household  heads  in  rural  areas\nwere self-employed (at 33 percent) and construction/casual labor (at 28 percent). These same\ntwo  categories  were  important  for  EWS  households  in  urban  areas  (at  28  percent  and  20\npercent, respectively) along with private sector salaried workers (at 26 percent); self-employed\nhouseholds  included  all  types  of  shop  owners  (petty  shops,  teashops  etc),  vendors  (fruits,\nvegetables,  flowers  etc.)  and  other  occupations  such  as  tailoring,  woodworking  etc.  Private\nsector  salaried  workers  included  those  working  in  private  establishments  that  ranged  from\ngrocery stores to large private enterprises. Service providers like barbers, dhobis, etc. were also\nincluded in this group.  Most MIG households in both rural and urban areas were self-employed\n(41  percent  in  rural  and  30  percent  in  urban  areas)  or  salaried  (28  percent  with  the  private\nsector  in  rural  areas  and  23  percent  in  urban  areas).  An  additional  28  percent  of  the  MIG\nhouseholds in urban areas were working for the Government.  As a result, some 51 percent of\nMIG  households  were  salaried  and  had  relatively  stable  employment.  Only  23  percent  of  the\nEWS households and 19 percent of LIG households in rural areas were involved in any form of\nagriculture (either as laborers or farmers of their own land).\n\nd.    Number of Workers per Household\n\nRoughly  64  percent  of  the  surveyed  households  had  two  or  more  working  members,\n14.\nincluding  41  percent  with  two  and  23  percent  with  three  or  more.  Almost  70  percent  of  the\nborrower households had two or more working members with roughly 30 percent having three\nor more. The percentage of households with two or more workers was highest for LIG in urban\nareas (87 percent) followed by LIG in rural areas (83 percent). LIG households in these areas\nalso had the highest percentage of households with three or more workers. The fact that EWS\nborrowers  in  urban  areas  had  one  of  the  highest  percentages  of  households  with  only  one\nworker (55 percent) was a surprise.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 9, page 4\n\ne.     Monthly Household Incomes\n\n15.\nThe  average  monthly  income  of  all  surveyed  households  was  around  Rs3,400.  While\nthere  was  little  difference  in  income  between  EWS  borrowers  and  potential  borrowers  in  rural\nareas, EWS borrowers in urban areas appeared to have slightly higher incomes than potential\nborrowers in the same income group. EWS and LIG borrowers also appeared to have incomes\nthat were almost 5 percent higher than the overall sample for the same income groups. Survey\nresults  showed  that  some  84  percent  of  EWS  borrower  households  had  monthly  incomes\nbetween  Rs1,500  and  Rs2,500,  while  52  percent  of  LIG  households  had  incomes  between\nRs2,500  and  Rs4,500.  Some  88  percent  of  lower  MIG  households  had  incomes  between\nRs5,501 and Rs6,000.\n\nf.  \n\nMonthly Household Expenditures\n\n16.\nThe average monthly expenditure for all surveyed households were close to Rs2,500. As\nexpected,  significant  differences  were  found  in  monthly  expenditures  for  households  living  in\nurban and rural areas. Cheaper access to food in rural areas and more expensive transportation\ncosts in urban areas were undoubtedly two of the major reasons for these differences.\n\n17.\nRoughly 80 percent of EWS households in rural areas and 54 percent of those in urban\nareas  had  monthly  expenditures  less  than  Rs1,500.  The  remaining  EWS  in  both  geographical\nareas had monthly expenditures less than Rs2,500. The difference in monthly expenditures for\nLIG  households  was  more  pronounced  with  a  much  higher  percentage  of  LIG  households  in\nrural areas at the lower end of the scale (i.e., 82 percent with less than Rs2,500 expenditures\nper  month  compared  with  only  34  percent  for  urban  LIG).  Again,  while  65  percent  of  the  LIG\nhouseholds  in  urban  areas  had  monthly  expenditures  between  Rs2,500  and  Rs4,500,  this\noccurred  for  only  16  percent  of  the  LIG  households  in  rural  areas.  A  more  even  situation  was\nfound  for  MIG  households,  with  21  percent  in  rural  areas  having  expenditures  greater  than\nRs4,500 compared with 36 percent in urban areas.\n\n18. While only very limited household income and expenditure data were obtained from the\nsurvey,  the  results  indicate  a  rather  consistent  pattern  that  provides  useful  insights  into  the\nfinancing  of  housing  for  low-income  households.  Households  across  all  three  income  groups\nappear capable of dedicating an important amount of their monthly savings to the repayment of\na housing loan, especially if it follows previous loans for the improvement of income.\n\n2. \n\nHousing Need, Demand, and Absorptive Capacity of Potential Client\nHouseholds\n\n19.\nThe  conversion  of  housing  need  into  demand  and  the  subsequent  engagement  of  a\nhousing  loan  depend  on  a  number  of  conditions  that  include  the  household\u2019s  socioeconomic\nsituation,  its  security  of  tenure  and  period  of  residence,  existing  housing  conditions,  previous\nborrowing experience, and potential loan conditions and terms.\n\na.\n\nSecurity of Tenure\n\n20.\nThe  overall  percentage  of  homeownership  within  the  survey  sample  was  roughly  87\npercent.  Little  difference  occurred  in  the  degree  of  homeownership  among  the  three  income\ngroups. A somewhat higher percentage of homeownership occurred among EWS households in\nrural  compared  with  those  in  urban  areas.  There  was  also  a  higher  percentage  of\nhomeownership among borrowers than among nonborrowers.\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 9, page 5\n\n21.\nSome  92  percent  of  all  borrower  households  owned  their  house  with  slightly  higher\npercentages  occurring  for  rural  and  EWS  households.  The  percentage  of  home  ownership  for\nnonborrower households was 85 percent.  The most notable difference occurred in urban areas\nwhere only 81 percent of potential borrower households owned their houses compared with 91\npercent of the borrowers.  The fact that 9 percent of urban borrowers were renters may be due\nto the fact that they were still in the process of completing their house.  Roughly 30 percent of\nthe  borrowers  that  owned  their  housing  units  did  not  have  documents  legitimizing  their\noccupation of the land.  Another 24 percent were assigned patta, 31 percent had bought their\nplots,  and  the  remaining  15  percent  occupied  their  plot  by  right  of  inheritance.  There  were  no\nEWS  borrowers  in  rural  areas  without  proper  land  documentation.  Almost  50  percent  of  the\nEWS borrowers in urban areas, however, were without such documentation.\n\n22.\nConditions were considerably different for potential borrower households.  There was a\nmuch  lower  percentage  of  households  living  on  their  land  without  documents  (14  percent  for\nnonborrowers  compared  with  30  percent  for  borrowers)  and  a  much  higher  percentage  of\nhouseholds that had inherited their land (30 percent for nonborrowers compared with 15 percent\nfor  borrowers).  The  difference  was  most  evident  in  urban  areas  where  14  percent  of  the\nborrowers owned their land through inheritance as opposed to 32 percent of the nonborrowers.\nOther  than  this  \u201cflip\u201d  between  inherited  and  land  occupied  without  documents,  the  remaining\npercentages for plot tenure was very similar for borrowers and nonborrowers.\n\nb.\n\nPeriod of Residency\n\n23.\nResults from the survey show that the amount of time that a household has lived in its\nhouse  is  not  a  major  factor  in  the  decision  to  borrow  for  housing.  Some  38  percent  of  the\nborrowers in the overall sample had lived in their houses for less than 10 years compared with\n44 percent for potential borrowers. At the same time, 48 percent of the borrowers had lived in\nthe their houses for more than 15 years compared with 41 percent for nonborrowers. In terms of\nincome  groups,  a  higher  percentage  of  EWS  and  MIG  households  in  rural  areas  had  lived  in\ntheir  houses  for  more  than  20  years  than  LIG  households.  The  situation  in  urban  areas  was\nreversed. More than half the LIG households had been living in their houses for more than 20\nyears.  The  situation  for  potential  borrowers  was  the  same,  with  a  greater  percentage  of  EWS\nand MIG households living in their houses for more than 20 years than LIG.\n\nc.\n\nHousing Conditions\n\nClose to three quarters of the survey households lived in houses with tile or reinforced\n24.\nconcrete  roofs.  This  included  a  slightly  higher  percentage  in  rural  areas  compared  with  urban\nareas  due  perhaps  to  a  greater  sense  of  land  tenure  and  security.  At  the  same  time,  over  80\npercent  of  the  borrowers  lived  in  housing  with  tile  (semipucca)  or  reinforced  concrete  (pucca)\nroofs in basically equal proportions. Only about 20 percent were living in houses with thatched\n(kutcha) roofs.\n\n25.\nSignificant  differences  occurred  in  the  type  of  houses  occupied  by  potential  borrowers.\nSome  45  percent  of  the  EWS  category  lived  in  houses  with  thatched  roofs,  while  43  percent\nlived in houses with tile roofs. Roughly 25 percent of LIG households and 8 percent of MIG also\nlived  in  houses  with  thatched  roofs.  The  average  house  size  for  the  overall  sample  was  360\nsquare feet (or an average of 80 square feet per person). Houses in rural areas were roughly 20\npercent  larger  than  those  located  in  urban  areas.  There  was  little  difference  in  house  size\nbetween borrowers and nonborrowers within the different income and geographical categories.\nThe biggest difference occurred between houses inhabited by the LIG and MIG categories.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 9, page 6\n\n26.\nSlightly  more  than  half  of  the  surveyed  households  had  in-house  toilet  facilities.  The\noverall percentages for water supply and electricity were 45 and 74 percent respectively. There\nwas little difference in the provision of these services between urban and rural areas.  Given the\nimportance  of  electricity  and  other  basic  services  to  the  well-being  of  the  household,  housing\nconstruction and needed service improvements should be included in the same loan.\n\nd.\n\nBorrowing Experience\n\n27.\nBorrowers became interested in obtaining housing loans for a number of reasons.  The\nmost common reasons were (i) an increase in household size, (ii) improved financial position of\nthe household, and (iii) intrafamily disputes. The overwhelming majority of surveyed households\nhad  taken  microfinance  loans  from  informal  sources.    Most  of  these  loans  were  used  to  meet\nconsumption and social function needs. While EWS loans from money lenders were distributed\nover  consumption,  family  function,  medical,  emergency,  income  generation,  and  other  uses,\nmore than half of these loans were used for medical reasons and family functions. Moneylender\nloans to LIG households were used mainly for consumption and family functions.\n\n28.\nResults from the survey showed that borrowers of housing finance generally had taken\nmore microfinance loans from a variety of sources than potential borrowers. In particular, EWS\nand LIG borrower households had clearly been more active borrowers for nonhousing purposes\nthan  their  nonborrowing  counterparts.  EWS  housing  borrowers  had  taken  0.62  loans  per\nhousehold  from  moneylenders  compared  with  0.39  loans  per  household  for  those  EWS\nhouseholds  that  had  not  borrowed  for  housing.  Similarly,  the  ratio  of  loans  through  SHGs  for\nEWS borrowers was 1.43 loans per household compared with only 0.96 for potential borrowers.\nSHG loans for LIG households were 1.17 for borrowers and 0.91 for potential borrowers. For all\nloans combined, the ratio for EWS borrowers was 2.19 loans per household compared with 1.51\nloans per potential borrowers. For LIG households the ratios were 1.83 for borrowers and 1.42\nfor potential borrowers. Surprisingly, MIG households were the least active borrowers with only\n0.67 loans per household for those that had borrowed for housing and 0.86 loans for those that\nhad not.\n\n29.\nAlthough little information can be derived from the survey concerning the percentage of\nhouseholds  interested  in  borrowing  for  housing  due  to  its  purposive  sample,  the  sources,\nfrequencies  and  uses  of  housing  loans  can  be  examined.  Close  to  78  percent  of  those\nborrowing for housing had borrowed only from the CFI. Another 8 percent had borrowed from\nmoneylenders, with roughly half these households in the EWS group and the other in LIG.\n\ne.\n\nLoan Conditions\n\nin  urban  areas  used \n\n30.\nThe  survey  questionnaire  indicated  four  uses  of  the  housing  loans.    They  include\n(i) small-scale improvement and upgrading; (ii) additions or expansion; (iii) new construction or\nrebuilding  of  an  existing  house;  and  the  purchase  of  an  existing  house.  While  surveyed  EWS\nhouseholds \nfor\ntheir  housing \nimprovement/upgrading,  housing  unit  expansion,  and  new  construction,  the  clear  majority  of\nother urban and rural borrowers did so for new construction. Overall, 57 percent of all borrowers\nused  their  housing  loans  for  new  or  major  construction.  In  rural  areas,  75  percent  of  EWS\nborrowers, 78 percent of LIG, and 86 percent of MIG used their loans for this purpose.  In urban\nareas,  the  respective  percentages  were  59  percent,  65  percent,  and  64  percent.  Roughly  19\npercent  used  their  loans  for  improvement  and  upgrading,  while  another  15  percent  undertook\nhousing additions and expansion. Only 2 of the 106 borrowers in the survey used their loan to\npurchase an existing house.\n\nloans  more  or \n\nless  equally \n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 9, page 7\n\n31.\nSome 87 percent of all EWS borrowers obtained their loans from their CFI with only one\nhousehold  obtaining  a  loan  from  a  bank.  The  remaining  borrowers  had  obtained  loans  from\nmoneylenders.  While all of the LIG borrowers had obtained loans through CFIs, LIG borrowers\nin urban areas used a wider range of sources. Of these borrowers, 65 percent had obtained a\nloan  from  CFIs;  17  percent  from  moneylenders;  and  the  remaining  households  from  housing\nboards,  banks,  and  other  sources.  Close  to  71  percent  of  MIG  borrowers  in  rural  areas  had\nobtained  loans  from  housing  boards  or  the  government.  In  urban  areas,  55  percent  of  MIG\nborrowers had obtained a housing loan from CFIs, 18 percent from housing boards, 9 percent\nfrom banks, and the remaining 18 percent from other sources.  For MIG borrowers the overall\npercentages were 44 percent from CFIs, 22 percent from housing boards, 6 percent from banks,\n17 percent from the Government, and 11 percent from other sources. Altogether, only three of\nthe borrowers surveyed, all of whom lived in urban areas, had obtained a housing loan from a\nbank.\n\n32.\nThe  sizes  of  loans  borrowed  by  households  in  all  income  categories  ranged  from  less\nthan  Rs10,000  to  more  than  Rs100,000.  Approximately  37  percent  of  the  LIG  borrowers\nobtained  a  loan  for  less  than  Rs10,000,  while  close  to  21  percent  of  the  EWS  borrowers\nobtained a loan for more than Rs50,000.  Altogether, 49 percent of EWS, 52 percent of LIG, and\n28 percent of MIG borrowed for less than Rs15,000. Four interest rates were predominant: 15\npercent (39 percent of the loans), 18 percent (11 percent), 24 percent (15 percent), and greater\nthan 24 percent (19 percent). More than half the EWS borrowers and 29 percent of the LIG had\nobtained loans with annual interest rates of 15 percent.\n\n33. While  it  might  be  expected  that  EWS  borrowers  would  have  lower  monthly  payments,\nthe  percentages  of  borrowers  paying  less  than  Rs250  per  month  actually  increased  with  an\nincrease in income. Survey results indicate that 30 percent of EWS, 37 percent of LIG, and 39\npercent  of  MIG  borrowers  paid  less  than  Rs250  per  month.    Similarly,  28  percent  of  EWS\nborrowers, 39 percent of LIG, and 28 percent of MIG were making monthly payments between\nRs250  and  Rs500.  Surprisingly,  some  28  percent  of  EWS  households  were  making  monthly\npayments  greater  than  Rs1,000,  which  was  virtually  the  same  percentage  as  that  for  MIG\nborrowers. All of the EWS and LIG borrowers were making either weekly or monthly payments.\nSlightly  more  than  half  made  payments  on  a  weekly  basis.    Some  80  percent  of  the  MIG\nborrowers  were  also  making  weekly  or  monthly  payments.  Payments  by  other  MIG  borrowers\nwere either annual or based on other methods of payment.\n\nf.\n\nCollateral\n\n34.\nIn  terms  of  the  collateral,  55  percent  of  all  borrowers  provided  a  form  of  traditional\ncollateral for their housing loan. Of those 34 percent provided a land deed, 4 percent provided a\npossession  certificate,  and  7  percent  provided  another  form  of  guarantee.  Consequently  land\nownership documents were the most common form of collateral even for informal finance. The\npercentages  of  borrowers  able  to  provide  collateral  were  virtually  the  same  for  all  income\ncategories. The ability to provide acceptable collateral as well as the form of collateral provided\nappeared to have little relationship to the category of income.\n\n35.\nSlightly more than half of the borrowers (52 percent) felt that group pressure was also an\neffective  form  of  collateral.  Group  pressure  was  strongest  for  EWS  borrowers,  60  percent  of\nwhich felt that such pressure was adequate to ensure the repayment of loans. Slightly less than\nhalf the borrowers felt that pressure from the CFI was strong enough to guarantee repayment,\nwith  EWS  borrowers  once  again  the  highest  percentage  at  53  percent.  The  majority  of\nrespondents  felt  that  only  one  form  of  collateral  should  be  required  and  that  it  should  not  be\nlarge cash deposit.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 9, page 8\n\ng.\n\nLoan Approval\n\n36.\nIn  terms  of  loan  approval,  38  percent  of  EWS  borrowers  were  able  to  have  their  loan\napproved  in  less  than  a  month  and  91  percent  in  less  than  four  months.    For  disbursal,  the\npercentages were 45 percent for less than a month and 96 percent for less than four months.\nPercentages  for  all  the  other  income  groups  were  similar.  Only  30  percent  of  all  borrowers\nclaimed  to  have  experienced  any  problems  in  the  approval  or  disbursal  of  their  loan.    Most  of\nthese problems were not major.\n\nh.\n\nBorrowers\u2019 Own Contribution\n\n37.\nCash was the most frequent contribution made by borrowers to the construction of their\nhouse.  Roughly  76  percent  of  the  borrowers  contributed  their  own  cash  to  supplement  their\nhousing loan. The percentage of households putting in cash ranged from 70 percent for EWS to\n78  for  LIG,  and  89  for  MIG.  Of  those  EWS  households,  45  percent  contributed  less  than\nRs10,000.  The  situation  was  much  different  for  the  two  other  income  categories.  Some  34\npercent  of  LIG  households  and  75  percent  of  MIG  households  contributing  cash  put  in  more\nthan Rs40,000. Roughly 41 percent of the borrowing households contributed their own labor to\nthe construction of the house.  The contribution of labor according to income group showed 43\npercent for EWS, 51 percent for LIG, and 11 percent for MIG.  In almost every case, the value of\nself-help labor was considered to be less than Rs10, 000.\n\n38. While the recycling of building materials can be an important cost-cutting approach, only\nabout  15  percent  of  the  borrowers  made  any  contribution  in  kind  to  the  construction  of  their\nhouse.  Only about 27 percent of the borrowing households obtained building materials from the\nCFI,  with  the  percentage  for  different  income  groups  ranging  from  25  percent  for  EWS\nhouseholds  to  33  percent  for  MIG.  Similarly,  about  22  percent  of  the  borrowers  sold  some  of\ntheir assets to finance the cost of construction. The percentage was slightly higher in rural (29\npercent) that in urban areas (18 percent).\n\ni.\n\nSupplemental Loans\n\nRoughly  half  the  borrowers  engaged  an  additional  loan  to  finance  the  construction  of\n39.\ntheir  house.  Additional  loans  were  most  common  when  the  primary  loan  was  less  than  Rs\n20,000.  Roughly 61 percent of the borrowers of this size of loan obtained an additional loan, the\nmajority  of  which  ranged  between  Rs5,000  and  Rs35,000.  About  a  quarter  of  the  households\nobtaining  a  loan  for  Rs5,000  or  less  obtained  another  loan  for  Rs5,000  or  less  as  well.  Only\nabout  26  percent  of  the  borrowers  were  interested  in  obtaining  a  maintenance  loan  once\nconstruction of their house was completed.\n\n3.\n\nImpact  of  Improved  Housing  Conditions  on  the  Reduction  of  Poverty  and\nSituation of Women\n\n40.\nCFI  housing  loans  are  intimately  linked  to  the  reduction  of  poverty  through  support  to\nprovide home work-places and working conditions for women, and the empowerment of women\nthrough  the  self-help  group  (SHG)  approach  to  decision  making  and  use  of  household\nresources.\n\na.\n\nHome-Work Places\n\n41.\nSlightly more than 31 percent of all households in the survey used their home as a place\nof work.  This includes more than half the MIG borrowers in both urban and rural areas.  Many\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 9, page 9\n\nof these households may have been able to use their home workplace to raise their category of\nincome.  Among borrowers, EWS households had the lowest percentage of households using\ntheir house as a workplace at 17 percent. Many EWS households have very poor quality houses\nthat would require substantial improvement to serve as a place for income-generating activities.\nFurther  the  survey  revealed  that  close  to  30  percent  of  rural  borrowers  of  housing  loans  were\nusing  at  least  part  of  their  house  as  a  place  of  work.  Some  80  percent  of  these  rural  home-\nworkplaces were used for the rearing of domestic livestock.  In urban areas, close to 36 percent\nof  the  borrowers  were  using  their  houses  as  workplaces  for  urban  functions  such  as  tailoring,\npetty shops, wood carving, etc.\n\n42.\nSome  60  percent  of  these  home-workplaces  involved  the  use  of  a  room,  16  percent\ninvolved the use of open space near the house, and another 14 percent involved the use of the\nkitchen.  The use of housing as a workplace is particularly important for women borrowers, 60\npercent of whom are home-based workers. Some of the work-related activities that typically take\nplace in the home include mat weaving, broom making, tailoring, embroidery, small-scale food\nprocessing, petty commerce, temporary storage of goods, etc.\n\n43.\nThe most common home-based work in the survey involved small-scale shops, tailoring,\nand  the  holding  of  animals,  which  combined  made  up  roughly  70  percent  of  the  total.  Results\nfrom  the  survey  showed  that  improvement  to  housing  and  home  workplaces  generated  an\nincrease  in  household  income  between  Rs200  and  Rs1,000  per  month  with  the  average\nincrease  about  Rs500.  Almost  60  percent  of  the  home-based  workers  in  the  survey  were\nwomen.\n\nb.\n\nImpact on Women Workers\n\n44.\nSome 48 percent of the survey households had at least one woman member working for\ncash.  The  LIG  category  had  the  highest  percentage  with  58  percent.  The  overall  percentages\nfor  EWS  and  MIG  households  were  35  and  46  percent  respectively.  For  borrowers,  the\npercentage  of  households  with  women  workers  was  58  percent  with  81  percent  of  these\nhouseholds  having  only  one  working  woman.  The  presence  of  a  working  woman  household\nmember  varied  considerably  between  rural  and  urban  areas.  The  percentage  of  borrower\nhouseholds  in  rural  areas  with  a  woman  worker  was  roughly  76  percent,  while  that  for  urban\nareas  was  only  43  percent.  LIG  borrower  households  in  both  urban  and  rural  areas  had  a\nslightly higher percentage of working women than EWS and MIG.\n\nResults from the survey seem to indicate that rural households with at least one working\n45.\nwoman are more likely to borrow for housing than those without. This is true for all three income\ngroups.  While  the  percentages  of  households  with  working  women  in  urban  areas  are\nsomewhat higher for EWS and LIG borrowers that difference is not substantial.\n\n4. \n\nTechnical Capacity and Support Provided and Needed\n\n46.\nRoughly 34 percent of the borrowers obtained technical and/or management support for\nthe  construction  of  their  house.  The  percentage  was  slightly  higher  for  LIG  households  (41\npercent)  and  slightly  lower  for  MIG  households  (22  percent).    The  percentage  for  EWS  was\nclose  to  the  overall  average  at  32  percent.  The  importance  of  technical  support  was  clearly\ndemonstrated  during  the  field  work  with  SPMS.    Houses  that  were  built  with  the  help  of  the\nSPMS  engineer  were  clearly  better  built  and  less  costly  than  those  built  without  such\nassistance.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 9, page 10\n\n47.\nTechnical  support  can  help  low-income  household  borrowers  in  the  design,  budgeting,\nand  cost  control  of  construction.  It  insures  sound  construction  at  reasonable  and  predictable\ncost.  Low-income household borrowers of housing finance recognize the value of this service\nand are basically willing to pay between Rs200 to Rs600 per house, or about 1 percent of their\nloan amount, for this service. It would be in the interest of all parties if CFIs were equipped with\na  housing  cell  to  provide  this  support.  Survey  results  also  indicated  a  preference  for  the  bulk\nsupply  of  materials  from  the  CFIs  (or  NGOs);  this  would  save  time  and  reduce  the  costs  of\nmaterials and their transport.\n\nC.\n\nResults from the Housing Case Studies\n\n48.\nA series of case studies were implemented to deepen the understanding of EWS, LIG,\nand MIG needs for housing finance. The basic objective of the case studies was to more clearly\nunderstand  the  qualitative  factors  affecting  the  choice  of  housing  products  to  be  financed,  the\ngraduation  of  households  from  housing  need  to  housing  finance,  the  provision  of  support\nservices  and  the  impact  of  housing  finance.  The  basic  socioeconomic  characteristics  of  case\nstudy households were very similar to those of households in the sample survey.\n\n49.\nThe  most  important  result  from  the  case  studies  was  that  they  provided  additional\ninformation  on  the  types  of  housing  finance  available  to  low-income  households  and  their\npreferences. The main sources of housing finance are all informal. The SHGs/federations have\nbeen the most widely used sources of housing finance in the southern and Delhi regions. SHG\nmembers  usually  approach  their  group  or  the  parent  CFI  for  their  housing  loans.  Those\nemployed in permanent jobs also can take loans from their employers. Chit funds are another\nwidely  used  source  of  housing  finance  in  the  south.  Table  A9  illustrates  the  different  loan\nconditions that case study households obtained from informal sources in borrowing for housing.\n\nTable A9: Loan Conditions of Different Housing Finance Providers\n\nProduct\n\nInterest\nRate (%)\n\nRepayment\nPeriod (years)\n\nRepayment\nSchedule\n\nSecurity/Collateral\n\nHousing Society\n\n12\n\n15\n\nMonthly\n\nLand deed\n\nNGOs\n\n12 - 18\n\n3 - 5\n\nMoney Lender\n\n36 - 60\n\n2 - 3\n\nRelatives\n\nWeekly to\nmonthly\n\nMonthly to\nquarterly\n\nLand deed, group\nsecurity\n\nLand deed (agri and\nothers)\n\nNone\n\nPawn Broker\n\n60 - 120\n\n2 \u2013 3\n\nFlexible\n\nJewelry, utensils\n\n   NGO= non-government organization.\n\nHousehold preferences for the types of housing finance and lenders were influenced by\n50.\n(i)  formalities  and  procedures  involved  in  obtaining  the  loan;  (ii)  loan  terms  and  conditions\nincluding the rate of interest, repayment period, and collateral requirements; (iii) time required to\nprocess the loan; and  (iv) rigidity in repayment schedules and terms.\n\n51.\nThe  average  amount  of  housing  finance  required  to  expand  a  housing  unit  was\nestimated  to  be  Rs20,000  while  the  average  cost  of  new  construction  was  estimated  to  be\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 9, page 11\n\nRs50,000.  SHGs  and  CFIs  were  the  preferred  source  of  housing  finance  for  their  members.\nCase study respondents felt that housing finance terms should include a rate of interest of 12 to\n18 percent with monthly payments over a period of 3 to 5 years.\n\nD.\n\nResults and Observations from the Consumer Workshops\n\n52.\nConsumer workshops were held at the end of the sample survey and case study work in\neach of the six survey areas. The intention of these workshops was to expand the issues and\nideas raised during survey work through open discussion. A significant part of the workshop was\ndedicated to identifying acceptable requirements for accessing a housing loan, the types of loan\nproducts desired and their estimated costs, and acceptable conditions of a housing loan from a\nCFI.\n\nGenerally  agreed  upon  SHG  and  member  requirements  to  obtain  a  housing  loan  from\n53.\nCFIs  were:  (i)  for  the  SHG,  at  least  2  to  3  years  of  microfinance  operation  and  a  repayment\nperformance of 90 to 100 percent; and (ii) for the member, 2 to 3 years membership in the SHG,\nsavings  accumulation  of  Rs3,000,  successful  use  and  repayment  of  2  to  3  loans  for  income\ngeneration, repayment record of at least 95 percent for past loans, expressed housing demand,\nlow cash outflow to service existing debt and adequate repayment capacity.\n\nThe type and estimated costs of desired housing products included: (i) the purchase of a\n54.\nplot for Rs5,000 to Rs10,000 for EWS households; (ii) purchase or construction of a new house\nfor  Rs45,000  for  EWS,  Rs70,000  for  LIG  and  Rs100,000  for  MIG;  (iii)  repairs,  improvements,\nand  additions  for  Rs25,000;  redemption  of  a  house  site  and  house  for  Rs20,000:  workplace\nimprovements  for  Rs5,000  to  Rs20,000;  and  construction  of  toilets,  electricity,  water  facilities,\netc. for Rs5,000.\n\nE.\n\nResults of the NGO/CFI Consultation Workshops\n\n55.\nA major objective of the NGO/CFI consultation workshops was to determine an idea of\nthe  potential  demand  for  housing  loans  through  CFIs.  The  30  participants  at  the  consultation\nworkshop in Calcutta expressed a potential demand for bulk lending from HUDCO of roughly $5\nmillion. The 45 participants at the consultation workshop in Chennai expressed a much greater\nneed  for  roughly  $40  million.  Some  of  the  fast-track  CFIs,  which  were  not  included  as\nparticipants in the consultations (including SIDA, SHARE, SEWA and DHAN Foundation), have\nexpressed a similar need for around $50 million. Clearly not all of the CFIs in the consultations\nhave the capacity to handle large loans. Nevertheless, a concerted effort was made to develop\nreasonable  estimates  of  what  would  be  required  once  the  new  HUDCO  lending  window  is  in\nplace.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 10\n\nAFFORDABILITY ANALYSIS\n\nAn  affordability  analysis  of  loans  to  low-income  households  through  community-based\n1.\nfinance  institutions  (CFIs)  under  part  A  of  the  Project  is  presented  in  Table  A10.1  and\nTable A10.2 summarizes an affordability analysis of direct lending under part C of the Project.\n\nTable A10.1: Affordability Analysis\n    Part A - Lending through CFIs\n\nMonthly Loana\nRepayments\n(Rs)\n\n% Household income\n\nEWSb\n\nLIGc\n\nMIGd\n\nPrice\n\n(Rs)\n\n10,000\n\n15,000\n\n20,000\n\n25,000\n\n30,000\n\n45,000\n\n50,000\n\n80,000\n\n100,000\n\nPrice\n\n(Rs)\n\n50,000\n\n90,000\n\n100,000\n\n125,000\n\n165,000\n\n175,000\n\n200,000\n\n254\n\n381\n\n508\n\n635\n\n762\n\n1,143\n\n1,270\n\n2,031\n\n2,539\n\n633\n\n1,139\n\n1,265\n\n1,582\n\n2,088\n\n2,214\n\n2,530\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n46\n\n51\n\n81\n\n102\n\n25\n\n46\n\n51\n\n63\n\n84\n\n89\n\n101\n\n5\n\n7\n\n9\n\n12\n\n14\n\n20\n\n22\n\n36\n\n46\n\n11\n\n20\n\n22\n\n28\n\n37\n\n39\n\n44\n\n4\n\n5\n\n7\n\n9\n\n11\n\n16\n\n18\n\n29\n\n36\n\n9\n\n16\n\n18\n\n23\n\n30\n\n32\n\n36\n\nEWS = economically weaker section, LIG = low-income group, MIG = middle-income group.\na Repayment period is assumed to be 15 years at 13 percent.\nb EWS = up to income below Rs2,500 per month.\nc LIG = income between Rs2,500 and Rs5,700 per month.\nd MIG = income between Rs5,700 and Rs7,000 per month.\nNote: The shaded areas show the loan amounts affordable for the different income groups.
