The loans will be used\nas  lines  of  credit  for  directing  housing  finance  to  low-\nincome  households  through  different  lending  channels,\nand  for  financing  housing-related  poverty  reduction\nsubprojects. A systematic and sustainable process will be\ndeveloped  whereby  financing  is  made  available  from\nformal  housing  finance  institutions  through  financial\nintermediaries  such  as  community-based  finance\ninstitutions  (CFIs)  and  nongovernment  organizations\n(NGOs) to assure effective and efficient delivery of market-\nbased housing finance to low-income households. All of\nthe beneficiaries will be low-income households.\nClassification Primary:  Human Development\nEnvironmental Category B\nAssessment The  environmental  implications  of  the  subprojects  were\nreviewed  and  their  likely  impacts  found  to  be  easily\nmitigated.  Initial  environmental  examinations  will  be\nundertaken for the subprojects.\nRationale In spite of the recent liberalization of the financial sector\nand associated policy and regulatory reforms to promote\nincreased  participation  in  housing  finance  and\ndevelopment,  the  housing  shortage  in  India  remains\ncritical,  especially  for  low-income  households.  It  is\nestimated that India's housing shortage is as high as 40\nmillion units, suggesting that more than 200 million people\nare living in chronically poor housing conditions or on the\nstreets. Although \u201cshelter for all\u201d is the overarching goal of\nthe Ninth Five-Year Plan, this was not achieved by 2000\nand will not be achieved by the end of the Ninth Plan\nperiod in 2002. Since over 90 percent of the housing need\nis  from  low-income  families,  these  families  are  most\ndirectly impacted by unacceptable living standards and the\npoor quality of life in all of India\u2019s urban centers. Lack of\nbasic services such as water supply, drainage, sanitation,\nand electricity also negatively impact the productivity and\nincomes of poor households, especially those who work in\ntheir homes.", "iii\nSince the major source of housing finance for low-income\nhouseholds is their own meager savings and family assets,\nthe principal constraint to the ability of low-income families\nto  improve  their  housing  and  living  conditions  is  the\nabsence of affordable credit for housing. Although various\nCFIs  and  NGOs  have  assisted  low-income  families  to\nmobilize  their  savings  and  have  extended  loans  for\nhousing construction and improvement, these efforts are\nextremely  small  when  compared  with  the  total  housing\nfinance  demand  of  low-income  households.  Project\nresources  will  therefore  be  focused  on  assisting  poor\nfamilies with one or more income earners to gain access to\nhousing finance from formal and informal housing finance\ninstitutions, especially CFIs and NGOs. In doing so, the\nProject  will  promote  market-based  lending,  as  these\nfamilies would otherwise have to pay higher than market\ninterest rates to money lenders to access small housing\nloans. For the poorest families, the Project will support\nsubprojects such as slum networking and home workplace\nschemes  to  improve  their  housing,  income  earning\npotential,  and  access  to  basic  infrastructure  and\ncommunity services.\nObjectives and Scope The objectives of the Project are to (i) increase access of\nlow-income households to market-based housing finance\nby increasing and broadening the finance channels of both\ninformal  and  formal  housing  finance  institutions  (HFIs);\n(ii) reduce poverty by improving infrastructure and services\nin  slum  areas,  and  financing  innovative  low-income\nhousing  subprojects;  and  (iii)  expand  the  lending\noperations  of  housing  finance  companies  (HFCs)  to\ninclude  a  greater  proportion  of  loans  to  low-income\nhouseholds. The overall thrust of the Project is to promote\nmarket-based  lending  without  subsidies,  and  the  target\nbeneficiary group is low-income households.\nThe Project consists of three parts: part A: lending to low-\nincome households through intermediaries such as CFIs,\nNGOs, public and private enterprises, and state and local\nbodies; part B: reducing poverty through slum networking\nand home-workplace subprojects; and part C: increasing\nlending to low-income households through formal HFIs.\nCost Estimates The Project is estimated to cost $517 million equivalent, of\nwhich $61 million is the foreign exchange cost and $456\nmillion equivalent is the local currency cost.", "iv\nFinancing Plan                                                                                      ($ million)\nSource  Foreign     Local  Total  Percent\n                                    Exchange   Currency    Cost                  \nADB         61      239   300 58\nHUDCO           0        21     21 4\nNHB            0        10     10 2\nHDFC           0        20     20 4\nICICI           0        20     20 4\nBeneficiaries           0      146    146 28\n           Total                        61             456            517           100\nLoan Amount\nand Terms Loans of $100 million to HUDCO, $80 million to HDFC,\n$80  million  to  ICICI,  $40  million  to  NHB,  totaling  $300\nmillion, from the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) ordinary\ncapital  resources,  with  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a\ngrace period of 5 years, at an interest rate in accordance\nwith  the  ADB's  market-based  loan  facility,  an  annual\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent, and a front-end fee of\n1 percent of the loan amount.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2007\nImplementation\nArrangements   The Project will be implemented through a housing finance\nfacility established within each of the four Borrowers. The\nfacility  will  provide  market-based  housing  loans  to  low-\nincome households as well as subloans to CFIs, NGOs,\nstate  agencies,  municipal  corporations,  and  private\ncompanies for onlending to low-income households.\nExecuting Agencies HUDCO, NHB, HDFC, and ICICI.\nProcurement Procurement of ADB-financed facilities under the Project\nwill  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for\nProcurement. For procurement of goods and services to be\nfinanced by the subloans out of the loan proceeds, the\nBorrowers  will  satisfy  ADB  that  the  procurement\nprocedures  they  apply  are  appropriate  to  the\ncircumstances.\nEstimated Project 31 December 2006\nCompletion Date\nProject Benefits The  major  benefit  of  the  Project  will  be  the  catalytic\nand Beneficiaries impact  on  improving  the  access  of  low-income\nhouseholds to housing finance, and the accompanying\npolicy  reform  agenda  that  will  promote  sustainable\nmechanisms for the delivery of housing finance at market\nrates, strengthen the institutional capacity of HFIs in both\nthe  formal  and  informal  sectors,  and  facilitate  housing\ninvestment.

The\nrecycling  or  relending  of  repayment  proceeds  will\nmaximize the impact of the ADB loan, resulting in more\nthan 500,000 housing loans benefiting approximately 2.7\nmillion people over the loan period.\nThere is a basic linkage between improved housing and\nhuman  welfare;  therefore,  human  development  will  be\nenhanced by the increased availability of housing finance\nfor  low-income  households.  The  Project  will  have  an\nimmediate impact on the welfare of low-income household\nbeneficiaries who presently have to obtain finance through\nthe unregulated system and pay interest rates of between\n5 and 10 percent per month. Thus, many impoverished\nfamilies will, for the first time, have access to affordable,\nyet  market-based  housing  finance.  Critical  urban\ninfrastructure and services will be provided under the slum\nnetworking  component  of  the  Project,  and  institutional\ncapacities  will  be  strengthened  to  improve  the  living\nconditions of families living in slum areas across India.", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on four proposed\nloans to the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO), the National Housing\nBank (NHB), the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), and ICICI for the Housing\nFinance II Project in India.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n \n2. Given the severity and scale of India\u2019s housing shortage, the Government asked the\n1999 Country Programming Mission for technical assistance (TA) to prepare a second loan\nproject  to  address  the  financial,  institutional,  and  regulatory  constraints  to  increasing  the\navailability of housing finance to low-income households. Project preparatory TA1 was approved\nin November 1999 with the objective of identifying sustainable, market-based channels and\ninstitutional arrangements for the delivery of housing finance to meet the borrowing needs of\nlow-income  households.  The  loan  Fact-finding  Mission  visited  India  in  April  2000  and  the\nAppraisal Mission2 in June 2000. The missions reviewed the results and recommendations of\nthe project feasibility study with the Government, bilateral funding agencies, housing finance\ninstitutions,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  community  groups,  and  low-income\nbeneficiaries,  and  reached  an  understanding  on  the  project  scope,  cost,  financing,\nimplementation  arrangements,  and  policy  reform  initiatives.  This  report  is  based  on  these\ndiscussions and the reports prepared by the TA consultants. The project framework is shown in\nAppendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1. Housing Situation\n \n3. Rapid population growth coupled with rapidly increasing urbanization and widespread\npoverty have created a serious shelter problem in India, contributing to the proliferation of\nslums, increased demand for urban infrastructure and services, and declining quality of life for\nlow-income households. Additional key factors that have aggravated India\u2019s critical housing\nsituation include institutional deficiencies, especially among state and local housing agencies,\nand regulatory constraints to new housing development and investment such as the Urban Land\nCeiling (and Regulation) Act of 1976 and the state rent control acts. In terms of the magnitude\nof India\u2019s housing shortage, the demand-supply gap in 1991 was 31 million units, according to a\nstudy  prepared  by  the  National  Building  Organization.3  Urban  areas  account  for  about  30\npercent of the shortage. Although reliable statistical data on the existing housing deficit are not\nreadily available, the study concluded that the annual demand for housing across the country\nwas about 4.5 million units, whereas the annual supply was about 3.5 million units. Based on a\nnet increase of housing demand of 1 million units per year since 1991, today\u2019s housing shortage\nis estimated to be as high as 40 million units. While these estimates suggest that more than 200\nmillion people across India are living in abject housing conditions or on the streets, millions\nmore are without decent, safe, and affordable housing.\n                                                \n 1 TA 3288 IND: Housing Finance II, for $405,000, approved on 8 November 1999.\n2  The Mission comprised J. Lynch, Urban Development Specialist and Mission Leader; A. Goswami, Counsel; and V.\nV. Subramanian, Investment Officer.\n 3 National Building Organization. 1997. Prominent Facts on Housing. New Delhi.", "2\n4. One critical indication of the housing shortage in urban areas is the proliferation of\nslums. In the 23 Indian cities with populations in excess of 1 million, approximately 28 percent of\nthe urban population live in slums. Since 1981, the slum population has been increasing at a\nrate of about 7 percent per year, more than twice as high as the average annual urban\npopulation growth rate over the same period. The health and environmental implications of\nhouseholds\u2019 lack of access to potable water, sanitation facilities, adequate drainage, and proper\nsolid  waste  collection  and  disposal  services  are  overwhelming,  especially  for  women  and\nchildren who spend proportionally more time at home than men. It is estimated that upward of\n25 percent of slum residents are home-based workers, mostly women. For these families,\naccess to decent living conditions and basic urban infrastructure and services is extremely\nimportant, as they are primary factors of production as well as productivity.\n \n5. In terms of investment requirements to meet India\u2019s housing shortage, the 33 million unit\ntarget of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002) was estimated to require over Rs1,500 billion\n($37.5  billion).  However,  not  more  than  25  percent  of  funding  required  to  meet  India\u2019s\nstaggering housing deficit is expected to flow from formal sources such as banks; financial\ninstitutions;  government-directed  insurance  companies;  and  central,  state,  and  local\ngovernments.4 With the exception of government-sponsored housing programs, formal housing\nfinance institutions (HFIs)5 are reluctant to lend to low-income households because of factors\nsuch as the relatively high transaction and servicing costs, irregular and unsubstantiated income\nsources, and the absence of collateral in the form of title to real property. Consequently, the\nremaining  funding  requirements  will  derive  from  informal  sources  that  largely  consist  of\nindividual  efforts  with  the  help  of  community-based  financial  institutions  (CFIs),6  NGOs,\nemployer financing, and moneylenders. Since most of the housing needs of the middle- and\nupper-income groups will be met through more formal channels, the shortfalls of the Ninth Plan\nwill mainly impact low-income households. Therefore, increasing funding through the informal\nsector is an essential and integral means to meet the housing needs of low-income families in\nIndia.\n2. Housing Finance\n \n6. The formal housing finance sector in India had its beginnings in the 1960s when the\nGovernment,  through  its  various  schemes  for  public  and  low-cost  housing,  was  the  sole\nprovider of housing finance. The Government implemented many of its schemes through state\nhousing boards that allocated serviced land and housing to individuals based on social welfare\nobjectives, not commercial considerations. The 1970s marked two significant developments in\nthe housing finance sector. A public sector housing company, HUDCO, was established in\n1970, and the first private housing finance company (HFC),7 HDFC, was established in 1977.\nHUDCO served as the principal institution to finance Government-supported housing programs,\nwhereas HDFC introduced mortgage financing to India and has become the largest and most\nsuccessful HFC in the country.\n \n7. The late 1980s heralded a number of important events, beginning with the formation of\nNHB in 1988 as an apex bank for housing finance. NHB\u2019s responsibilities include establishing\n                                                \n 4 Government of India. 1998. National Housing and Habitat Policy. Ministry of Urban Affairs and Employment, New\nDelhi.\n 5 HFIs include any organization, public or private, that is established with the primary intention of facilitating housing\nfinance.\n 6 CFIs are registered or unregistered agencies involved in savings and credit activities with direct participation and\ncontrol by a community, such as a neighborhood or a common occupation or place of employment.\n 7 HFCs are public or private sector nonbank finance companies with the primary objective of providing housing\nfinance.", "3\nguidelines for HFIs to ensure sound financial management, refinancing mortgage loans made\nby  qualified  HFIs,  and  mobilizing  formal  sector  resources  into  housing  finance.  The  draft\nNational Housing Policy (NHP), calling for the removal of many legal and regulatory constraints\nin the housing sector, was also tabled in Parliament in 1988, and ultimately adopted in 1994.\nAlso in the late 1980s, the Government directed insurance companies, commercial banks,\nprovident funds, and other agencies to invest a part of their incremental resources in housing.\nBased on the success of HDFC, a number of new HFCs were subsequently established during\nthe 1980s to enter into the mortgage lending market.\n \n8. The 1990s witnessed significant changes in housing policy starting with the NHP, which\nenvisaged the Government\u2019s role as a facilitator of housing activity, rather than one of provider;\nthis position was reiterated and elaborated in the National Housing and Habitat Policy (NHHP)\nof 1998. As a result, Government contributions to housing finance have fallen to less than 9\npercent, compared with 23 percent four decades ago. The liberalization of the financial sector\nhas also accounted for an increase in mortgage lending by formal finance institutions not\ntraditionally  in  the  housing  sector,  most  notably  commercial  banks  and  nonbank  financial\ninstitutions. Based on data from the National Sample Survey Organization, however, the share\nof formal sector housing finance varies from only about 22 percent for new houses in urban\nareas to less than 8 percent for additions and alterations in rural areas. By comparison, informal\nsources contribute as much as 79 percent of the finance for new construction in urban areas\nand 88 percent in rural areas. Another important event in the late 1990s, which has significant\nimplications for the future development of India\u2019s housing finance sector, was the structuring of\na pilot mortgage securitization issue that is expected to raise about Rs600 million ($14 million).\n9. Despite the relatively recent and rapid evolution of the formal housing finance sector in\nIndia, the informal sector continues to play a significant and sustained role in the provision of\nhousing finance, particularly to low-income households. Although the informal sector accounts\nfor more than 80 percent of housing finance in India, its unregulated nature makes it difficult to\nascertain how much comes from household savings versus loans from different sources such\nas family members, friends, employers, suppliers\u2019 credits, moneylenders, CFIs, and NGOs.\nSurveys suggest that household savings, including incremental stockpiling of building materials,\nrepresent the principal means by which low-income households finance housing construction\nand improvements. Besides loans from family members and friends, the most preferred source\nof credit is from CFIs, including self-help groups and NGOs. Interest rates from these sources\nrange from 15 to 18 percent per annum for loans up to five years, which are significantly lower\nthan rates charged by moneylenders who charge 5 to 10 percent per month. Borrowing from\nreputable CFIs and NGOs also provides low-income households with the means to establish\ncredit as well as open savings accounts. The majority of CFIs are commercially viable and\nfinancially sustainable, achieving high rates of cost recovery in the upper 90th percentiles,\nlargely due to community and peer group pressure, as well as the borrower\u2019s desire to access\nadditional credit in the future. However, CFIs and NGOs suffer from a problem also faced by\ntheir borrowers: lack of access to sustainable, longer-term sources of credit for relending as well\nas expanding their operations. The roles and responsibilities of key participants in housing\nfinance, and the organization and functioning of the housing market in India are described in\nAppendix 2.\n \nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n10. India has traditionally assigned a relatively low priority to housing finance in policy\nformulation compared with other sectors. Housing finance constitutes a small percentage of\ngross domestic product and the share of mortgage finance in total housing investment is\nestimated to be only about 10 percent. However, the 1994 NHP marked a significant transition", "4\nin the Government\u2019s position on housing policy by stressing the importance of housing as an\nintegral part of the national strategy for poverty reduction and employment generation in the\ncontext of overall economic development. It advocated increased participation by the private\nsector and emphasized that the role of government agencies was to create conditions for the\nexpansion  of  housing  supply  by  removing  legal  and  regulatory  constraints  and  supporting\nappropriate infrastructure investments. The policy also recognized the need for the continuation\nof Government-supported programs for vulnerable sections of society. In accordance with the\nincreased priority for housing, the Government formulated the NHHP in 1998 to promote the\ncreation of an enabling environment and to encourage the nongovernment sector to take up\nland assembly, housing development, and infrastructure investments. The central theme of the\nNHHP  is  the  development  of  strong  public-private  partnerships  for  tackling  housing  and\ninfrastructure problems. In emphasizing an enabling environment, the role of Government is\ndefined to provide fiscal concessions and to carry out legal and regulatory reforms. For housing\nschemes, the policy marks a shift away from purely subsidized schemes to schemes where\ncosts can be recovered with minimal subsidies. The policy also emphasizes the importance of\nsecuritization in the development of a dynamic and sustainable housing finance system in India.\n11. Based on the NHHP, a number of housing investment incentives were provided in the\ncentral budgets of 1998/99 and 1999/2000: (i) deductions for interest on housing loans were\nraised from Rs30,000 to Rs100,000; (ii) commercial banks were required to invest 3 percent of\nincremental  deposits  in  housing  versus  1.5  percent  previously;  (iii)  company  depreciation\nallowances were raised from 20 percent  to 40 percent on new housing stock provided to their\nemployees; and (iv) foreclosure and transfer of property laws were amended to facilitate the\nforeclosure of mortgages. In addition, the targets of the Ninth Plan were modified in the final\nplan document to include a special action plan for the construction of 2 million housing units\n(700,000 in urban areas) annually over five years. The overall housing target of 10 million units,\nincluding 3.5 million units in urban areas, over the NHHP period, however, falls far short of\nmeeting the total estimated housing shortage of 40 million units.\n12. Recent Government actions are indicative of the steps being taken implement policy\nreforms in line with the continuing policy dialogue with the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The\nUrban Land Ceiling (and Regulation) Act has been repealed at the central level allowing states\nto repeal the act within their respective jurisdictions. Parliament has passed amendments to the\nNHB  Act  to  enable  registered  HFIs  to  foreclose  on  defaulting  loans.  Several  states  have\ninitiated actions to amend their rent control acts in line with model legislation prepared by the\ncentral Government. NHB has expanded the national housing finance system by increasing the\nnumber of HFCs eligible for refinancing from 26 to 29. NHB is also in the process of launching\nthe  first  pilot  issue  of  mortgage-backed  securities  (MBS),  the  initial  step  in  establishing  a\nsecondary mortgage market.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n13. External assistance to India\u2019s housing sector is summarized in Appendix 3. In addition to\nADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  sector,  external  assistance  has  come  from  Germany,  Japan,\nNetherlands, United Kingdom, United States, and the World Bank. Germany has extended\nseveral lines of credit through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) to HUDCO and HDFC for\nlow-income housing schemes and the establishment of rural building centers throughout the\ncountry. The United Kingdom has extended grant assistance for habitat improvement projects in\nsix cities nationwide. Under its Housing Guarantee Program, the United States Agency for\nInternational Development (USAID) began lending to HDFC in 1983 to help HDFC expand its\noperations as the first private sector housing finance organization in India. USAID also entered\ninto an agreement with NHB under which NHB borrowed $25 million of an authorized $40", "5\nmillion to expand its refinancing operations. In addition, the USAID Housing Finance System\nExpansion Program from 1992 to 1996 laid the groundwork for establishing financial linkages\nbetween formal and informal housing finance institutions by assessing the housing finance\noperations of key CFIs and NGOs in the country.\n14. Although ADB\u2019s involvement in India\u2019s housing sector has been relatively recent, it is\nnow the major international lender in the sector and plays a leading role in supporting the\nGovernment\u2019s policy and institutional reform agenda. ADB\u2019s first loan for housing was a $20\nmillion line of credit to HDFC under the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Project,8\nwhich targeted lending for low-income housing and slum improvement schemes. ADB has also\nsupported two TAs for capacity building: Strengthening Housing Finance Institutions9 and the\nongoing  Restructuring  State  Level  Housing  Finance  Institutions.10  The  Housing  Finance\nProject11 (HFP) represented a major intervention in the sector by supporting (i) lending to HFIs,\nHFCs, CFIs, and households; (ii) lending for slum improvement and low- income subprojects;\nand (iii) expanding the national housing finance system by injecting equity and debt capital to\nstrengthen existing HFCs and establish new ones. The HFP was implemented through a $100\nmillion line of credit for each of the three Borrowers: HUDCO, NHB, and HDFC. The HFP was\nextremely fast disbursing in that, after taking the first drawdown in December 1997, all three\nBorrowers had completely drawn down their loans by December 1999.\nD. Lessons Learned\n15. The  HFP  provided  many  lessons,  which  serve  as  the  foundation  for  the  proposed\nProject as well as ADB\u2019s future role in the sector. First, the HFP highlighted the importance of\nestablishing  minimum  onlending  targets  for  each  of  the  different  lending  channels  and\nsubprojects.  The  fast-disbursing  nature  of  the  HFP  is  largely  attributed  to  the  Borrowers\nonlending funds through more traditional or familiar channels rather than adopting innovative\nlending schemes that require more time for project design, appraisal, and implementation.\nSecond, the channeling of funds from HFCs to CFIs was not a preferred lending modality for\nHFCs,  as  HFCs  were  unfamiliar  with  CFIs  and  such  loans  often  need  to  be  reported  as\n\u201cunsecured\u201d  on  HFCs\u2019  balance  sheets  due  to  the  absence  of  collateral.  This  experience\nsuggests that a specialized HFI with a social mandate, such as HUDCO, is best suited to\ndownmarket housing finance through CFIs. Third, the HFP did not stipulate that the proceeds\nfrom the repayments of loans financed with project proceeds should be re-lent for similar\npurposes; such a stipulation could have increased the multiplier effect of targeted lending.\nFourth, required Borrower contributions were not clearly defined to ensure maximum leveraging\nof ADB funds. Fifth, most lending for slum networking and low-income housing subprojects were\nsimply directed to state slum improvement and housing boards, thereby mitigating the need for\nthe Borrowers to appraise subprojects and monitor the use of funds. Sixth, many of the policy\nreform measures under the HFP were not within the purview of the three Borrowers; this\nhighlights  the  need  to  ensure  that  recommended  policy  reforms  can  be  undertaken  or\nimplemented by the borrowing institutions. Lastly, the HFP permitted 50 percent of the loan\nproceeds to be lent to middle- and upper-income households. The rapid disbursement rate of\nthe HFP and the removal of Government-defined interest rate ceilings for different loan sizes\nsuggests  that  financially  viable  and  sustainable  lending  programs  targeted  entirely  to  low-\nincome households can be supported.\n                                                \n8 Loan 1415/1416-IND: Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Project, for $105 million, approved on 14\nDecember 1995.\n9 TA 2833-IND: Strengthening Housing Finance Institutions, for $600,000, approved on 24 July 1997.\n10TA 3067-IND: Restructuring State Level Housing Institutions, for $500,000, approved on 11 September 1997.\n11Loan 1549/1550/1551-IND: Housing Finance Project, for $300 million, approved on 25 September 1997.", "6\nE.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n16. In India, ADB\u2019s overall strategic focus is to assist the Government in achieving its\nobjectives of increasing employment and reducing poverty by supporting improved economic\nefficiency and higher levels of sustainable economic growth. This is to be achieved through\nsupport for structural reforms, promotion of increased competition and greater private sector\nparticipation, development of a supportive regulatory environment, strengthening of institutional\ncapacities, and enhancing resource mobilization through financial sector and capital market\nreforms.\n17. ADB is integrating social welfare concerns into its strategy, with particular emphasis on\npoverty reduction, by supporting the development of urban infrastructure, including the provision\nfor housing finance, and developing sustainable mechanisms for the financing and delivery of\nessential social services at the municipal level. ADB\u2019s Urban Sector Strategy12 for India is\ndefined according to the two urban subsectors of infrastructure and housing. For housing,\nADB's  strategic  goals  in  India  are  to  (i)  strengthen  linkages  between  formal  and  informal\nhousing finance as a means to increase the availability and affordability of housing loans to low-\nincome households; (ii) promote microcredit programs for housing loans and home-based,\nincome-generating  activities,  and  support  low-income  shelter  schemes;  and  (iii)  provide\ntechnical advice and expertise in the establishment of a secondary mortgage market as a\nmeans to increase the availability of capital for housing finance.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n18. ADB, through its lending and TA program, has been engaged in policy dialogue with the\nGovernment on a wide range of issues in the housing and financial sectors.13 Under the HFP,\nthe  policy  dialogue  focused  on  (i)  removing  major  legal  and  regulatory  impediments  to\ndeveloping a sustainable housing sector; (ii) promoting greater cost recovery and community\nparticipation  for  slum  improvement  and  low-income  housing  subprojects;  (iii)  strengthening\nfinancial  management  capacities  of  state-level  housing  institutions;  (iv)  supporting  market-\nbased  lending  to  low-income  households;  and  (v)  expanding  the  national  housing  finance\nsystem. Throughout implementation of the HFP and support for related TA activities, ADB has\ncontinued in its policy dialogue with the Government and progress has been made in several\nkey areas.\n19. The existing situation and agreed upon policy reform measures to be linked to the\nProject are presented in a time-bound action plan contained in Appendix 4, the Policy and\nInstitutional Action Plan. The plan incorporates reforms that focus on establishing a conducive\nenvironment for housing investment, setting up appropriate and sustainable mechanisms for\nhousing finance, and strengthening institutional capacities of formal and informal sector HFIs.\nSome reforms require support from institutions other than the Borrowers. For such cases, the\nGovernment as Guarantor of the loan will be responsible for supporting the reforms. The critical\nissues, which form the basis of the ongoing and long-term policy dialogue between  ADB,\nBorrowers, and Government, are summarized in the following sections.\n                                                \n12Asian Development Bank. 1998.

Legislative and Regulatory Reforms\n20. Since approval of the HFP in 1997, the Government has initiated a number of important\nlegislative and policy reform measures, many of which are designed to remove constraints to\nincreased private sector investment in India's housing sector. Parliamentary approval of the Bill\nto Amend the NHB Act in May 2000 represents significant legislative reform, which clarifies\nforeclosure provisions and authorizes the NHB to play a major role in promoting mortgage\nsecuritization.  In  January  1999,  the  Government  repealed  the  Urban  Land  Ceiling  (and\nRegulation) Act of 1976, which served as a key impediment to private development of land in\nurban areas; several states are now taking steps to pass separate legislation repealing the act\nin their respective jurisdictions. In an effort to address the negative effects of India's Rent\nControl  Act  on  the  development  of  new  housing  and  maintenance  of  existing  units,  the\nGovernment has also prepared model rent control legislation that exempts new rental units from\nrent controls, permits rent revisions based on market trends, and expedites the judicial process\nfor settling disputes. Several states and union territories are preparing new legislation in line\nwith the model act.\n2. Subsidized Housing Schemes\n21. Up  to  now  the  Government  has  maintained  the  policy  of  heavily  subsidizing  slum\nimprovement and low-income housing projects implemented through state slum improvement\nboards, state housing boards, and municipal corporations. This is also the case for housing loan\nschemes to low-income families. These highly subsidized schemes have increased the burden\non  state  finances  and  have  hindered  the  development  of  sustainable  slum  improvement\nsubprojects. Given the poor condition of state finances, many states are becoming reluctant to\nissue loan guarantees and are instead issuing comfort letters.  From a financial perspective, this\nshift suggests that more rigorous project appraisal and due diligence criteria must be applied to\nproposed subprojects so that they are structured to ensure adequate levels of cost recovery.\n3. Market-Based Lending Rates\n22. At present HUDCO lending to economically weaker section (EWS)14 households is at a\nGovernment-mandated ceiling of 10.5 percent. ADB has continually emphasized the need to\nrationalize HUDCO\u2019s interest rates to better align them with the market. This effort has been\nsupported by KfW, which has stressed the importance of raising interest rates to minimize\nsubsidies as well as market distortions. HUDCO agrees that rates should be increased, but the\nEWS lending rate is set by an empowered committee of the Government. Based on its policy\nobjective of minimizing subsidies in the sector, ADB will continue to discuss this issue with the\nGovernment so that HUDCO\u2019s EWS lending rate could, over time, move toward market levels.\nSimilarly, onlending of funds to CFIs should be market-based to minimize market distortions and\npromote long-term financial viability and sustainability of these financial intermediaries.\n                                                \n14For purposes of designating beneficiaries of housing and related poverty reduction assistance, the Government\nclassifies households according to income levels. EWS households represent the poorest of the poor with monthly\nincomes less than Rs2,500 ($65).", "8\n4. Role of State and Local Housing Agencies\n23. Although central Government policy has become more amenable to the needs of low-\nincome households, state and local housing agencies such as state housing boards, slum\nimprovement boards, and municipal urban development authorities, continue to be major public\nproviders of housing. To this extent, they have not assumed the role of facilitator as called for in\nthe NHP or the NHHP. This is mainly due to the traditional role of these agencies as public\nhousing developers, the substantial number of employees involved, and the lack of institutional\nwill and capacity to change. As part of the Restructuring State Level Housing Institutions TA,\nADB  is  providing  capacity-building  assistance  to  state  housing  boards  in  Gujarat,  Kerala,\nMadhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal. The transition of the housing sector from one\nthat is highly regulated to an increasingly market-oriented one will pose significant challenges\nfor these agencies. Their operational and financial performance in an environment of increasing\ncompetition will determine whether they will survive in their present form.\n5. Expanding the Capital Market for Housing Finance\n24. After a great deal of effort by NHB and HDFC, the mechanics of mortgage securitization\nare being tried out through the first pilot issue of MBS. Although securitization is one of the best\nways to raise capital and manage the risks of fixed-rate lending, its viability depends primarily\non the cost of shedding various risks, including credit, liquidity, interest rate, and prepayment\ncompared with other forms of debt and equity fund-raising. As major financial institutions such\nas ICICI enter the housing finance market, ADB will continue to emphasize the issues of risk\nmanagement and the potential role of mortgage securitization in expanding the capital market\nfor housing finance.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n25. In spite of the recent liberalization of the financial sector and associated policy and\nregulatory reforms to promote increased private sector participation in housing finance and\ndevelopment,  the  housing  shortage  in  India  remains  critical,  especially  for  low-income\nhouseholds. Although \u201cshelter for all\u201d is the overarching goal of the Ninth Five-Year Plan, this\nhas not been achieved by 2000 and will not be achieved by the end of the Ninth Plan period in\n2002. Since over 90 percent of the housing need is that of low-income families, these families\nare the ones who are most directly impacted by low living standards and poor quality of life in all\nof India\u2019s urban centers, as well as its small towns and villages. Lack of basic services, such as\nwater supply, drainage, sanitation, and electricity, also impacts negatively on the productivity\nand incomes of poor households, especially those who work in their homes.\n26. Since the major source of housing finance for low-income households is their own\nmeager savings and family assets, the principal constraint to improving housing conditions for\nthese families is their lack of access to market-based housing finance. Although various CFIs\nand NGOs have helped low-income families to mobilize their savings and extended loans for\nhousing construction and improvement, these efforts are extremely small when compared with\nthe  total  housing  finance  demand  of  low-income  households.  Based  on  international\nexperience, it has been found that once low-income families obtain sufficient income, their\nhighest priority becomes improving their house or building a new one. Project resources will,\ntherefore, be focused on assisting poor families with one or more income earners to gain\naccess to housing finance from formal and informal housing finance institutions, especially CFIs\nand NGOs. In doing so, the Project will promote market-based lending, as these families would", "9\notherwise have to pay higher than market interest rates to access housing finance. It must be\nacknowledged, however, that the poorest families, which do not have sufficient incomes to\nafford even small housing loans, need targeted, subsidized assistance to improve their living\nconditions.  For  the  poorest  families,  the  Project  will  support  subprojects  such  as  slum\nnetworking and home workplace schemes to improve their housing, income-earning potential,\nand access to basic infrastructure and services.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n27. The objectives of the Project are to (i) increase the access of low-income households to\nmarket-based housing finance by increasing and broadening the finance channels of both\ninformal and formal HFIs; (ii) reduce poverty by improving infrastructure and services in slum\nareas and financing innovative low-income housing subprojects; and (iii) expand the lending\noperations of HFCs to include a greater proportion of loans to low-income households. The\noverall thrust of the Project is to promote market-based lending without subsidies, and the target\nbeneficiary group is low-income households.15 In relation to the Government's classification of\nhouseholds by income levels, low-income households encompass the EWS, low-income group\nhouseholds, and the lower one third of middle-income group households. A profile of low-\nincome households based on income levels is presented in Appendix 5. Unlike under the HFP,\nthe proposed Project will not provide for lending to higher income groups.\n28. The design of the Project draws upon many of the lessons learned under the HFP and\nresponds to the rapid policy and institutional changes taking place in India\u2019s housing finance\nsector. First, the lending channels have been clearly defined and the respective loan allocations\nalso  represent  lending  targets  to  be  achieved  during  implementation.  Second,  recent\nexperience has demonstrated the financial viability of CFI lending and the Reserve Bank of\nIndia is strongly encouraging formal HFIs to increase the flow of microcredit for housing. Third,\nthe Project will maximize the leveraging impact of ADB funds by (i) requiring that Borrowers\nmake contributions from their own sources to support different lending modalities; and (ii)\nstipulating that subloan repayments, net of ADB loan repayments, be re-lent or recycled through\nthe same lending channels and to the same beneficiary group(s) over the life of the ADB loan.\nFourth, lending for slum networking and low-income housing subprojects will not be through\nslum improvement boards, but will be based on detailed subproject appraisals and include\ninnovative  partnership  arrangements  with  CFIs,  NGOs,  municipal  corporations,  private\nenterprises, and slum residents, Fifth, the policy reform initiatives are within the scope and\npurview of the Borrowers and not government institutions with no direct role in the Project.\nFinally, all lending will be directed to low-income households and no funds will flow to higher\nincome households.\n29. The Project consists of three parts: part A: lending to low-income households through\nintermediaries such as CFIs, NGOs, public and private enterprises, and state and local bodies;\npart B: reducing poverty through slum networking and home workplace subprojects; and part C:\nincreasing lending to low-income households through formal HFIs. The four primary Borrowers\ninclude  HUDCO,  NHB,  HDFC,  and  ICICI.  A  description  of  the  three  project  parts,  their\nrespective  mechanisms  for  the  delivery  of  housing  finance,  and  the  relationships  of  the\nBorrowers, the intermediaries or subborrowers, and low-income beneficiaries follows.\n                                                \n15Low-income households are defined as households with monthly incomes of Rs7,000 (about $165) or less. This\ndefinition is approximately equivalent to an income of $1/capita/day at current exchange rates (Appendix 5).", "10\n1. Part A: Lending to Low-Income Households through Intermediaries\n30. Given the limited availability of housing finance through formal HFIs, intermediaries\nrepresent important and viable conduits for responding to the housing finance needs of low-\nincome  households.  By  promoting  and  establishing  linkages  between  formal  HFIs  and\nintermediaries, such intermediaries can onlend funds to low-income households for housing\npurposes. Experience has demonstrated that the intermediaries\u2019 onlending modalities are best\nsuited to meet the special needs and economic situations of low-income households, namely\nsmall, short-term housing construction, extension, and improvement loans that do not always\nrequire collateral in the form of clear title to real property. The three categories of intermediaries\nthat will serve as the primary onlenders to low-income households under part A of the Project\ninclude (i) CFIs and NGOs, (ii) public and private enterprises, and (iii) state and local bodies. To\nincrease  the  lending  impact  on  low-income  households,  the  Project  will  provide  that  all\nrepayments under each component will be re-lent to households in the same income group\nthrough similar intermediaries over the life of the ADB loan. Additionally, to maximize the\nleveraging of ADB funds and to promote own-source contributions on behalf of the Borrowers,\nADB will finance 80 percent of all lending to public and private enterprises and state and local\nbodies; ADB will finance 100 percent of all lending to CFIs and NGOs.\na. Community Finance Institutions and NGOs\n31. This component will improve access by low-income households to housing finance by\nexpanding the volume of lending to CFIs and NGOs to onlend to low-income households. More\nthan 100 CFIs and NGOs have been identified as potential subborrowers under the Project,\nincluding the Self Employed Women\u2019s Association, Society for Integral Development Action, Sri\nPadmavathy Mahila Abyudaya Sangam, Society for Promotion of Area Resource Centre, and\nFriends of Women\u2019s World Banking. CFIs exclude state apex cooperative housing federations,\nstate agricultural rural development banks, and state cooperative banks. Eligibility criteria for\nsubborrowers under this component, to be applied by the participating Borrowers, will include\ntheir  lending  experience,  operational  capacity,  technical  expertise,  outreach  potential,\nknowledge of target communities, reputation, and loan repayment track record.\n32. Lending under this component, as well as under the remaining components of Part A,\nwill  be  market-based  to  ensure  commercial  viability.  The  participating  Borrowers,  namely\nHUDCO, HDFC, and ICICI, will onlend funds to eligible CFIs and NGOs at interest rates that\ninclude a spread to cover their loan processing expenses and a risk premium, based on an\nassessment of the credit rating of the recipient CFI or NGO.  Likewise, the CFIs and NGOs will\nprovide  housing  loans  to  eligible  low-income  households  at  interest  rates  that  include  an\nadditional spread for the CFIs or NGOs to cover similar expenses. As the survey of CFI and\nNGO lending practices indicates, the average loan size is Rs35,000 with interest rates ranging\nfrom 15 to 18 percent per annum for a term of four years. Based on a detailed assessment of\nthe absorptive capacity of CFIs and NGOs, conservative estimates indicate that at least $50\nmillion can be channeled through these subborrowers over the five-year project implementation\nperiod. A total allocation of $40 million is provided for this component for HUDCO, HDFC, and\nICICI to onlend to qualified CFIs and NGOs.\nb. Public and Private Enterprises\n33. Drawing from the lending procedures pioneered by HUDCO and HDFC under the HFP,\npublic and private enterprises represent another important and financially viable channel for\ndirecting housing finance to low-income households. Under this arrangement, HFIs provide bulk\nloans  to  public  and  private  enterprises  for  onlending  to  their  employees.  The  enterprise", "11\nguarantees repayment of the bulk loan and, in turn, deducts the individual loan repayments from\nthe borrowers\u2019 salaries. Representative public enterprises include state power corporations and\nport authorities, as well as local water and sanitation authorities. Additionally, associations of\npolice,  teachers,  and  nurses  can  be  considered,  along  with  other  types  of  employee\nassociations. Private enterprises include industrial estates; nongovernment cooperatives such\nas those in the textiles, milk, and sugar industries; cottage industry associations; and the\nSarvodaya  Sangh  societies,  which  operate  department  stores  across  India  selling  textiles,\nhandicrafts, leather goods, and food items. As distinct from the bulk lending modality, up to 50\npercent of lending under this component can be in the form of direct housing loans to enterprise\nemployees when the enterprise is used as a means to market loans and to consolidate potential\nlow-income borrowers. A total of $60 million is allocated for this component to finance 80\npercent of disbursements through HUDCO, HDFC, and ICICI.\nc. State and Local Bodies\n34. This component will promote lending through state and local bodies to respond to the\nhousing  finance  needs  of  low-income  households  in  their  respective  states  and  local\njurisdictions. Lending under this component will be restricted to state governments (and the\nrespective local bodies) that have undertaken various sector reforms initiatives such as putting\ninto place progressive urban land ceiling laws and/or amending state rent control legislation.\nBased on these criteria, the eligible states and union territories (and local bodies located\ntherein)  include  Andhra  Pradesh,  Delhi,  Gujarat,  Harayana,  Karnataka,  Kerala,  Madhya\nPradesh, Maharastra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. In\naddition to the state governments, lending will only be permitted to the five state housing boards\nthat have (or are in the process of) undertaking improvements to their financial management\nand accounting systems under the ADB Restructuring State Level Housing Institutions TA\n(footnote 10), namely Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal. The\neligibility  of  other  state  housing  boards  will  be  considered  on  a  case-by-case  basis  upon\ndemonstration that they are initiating reform measures in accordance with recommendations\nand guidelines of the TA. Given the poor financial performance of state slum improvement\nboards, state apex cooperative housing societies, state housing improvement trusts, as well as\nmunicipal development authorities, no lending will be permitted to these institutions under the\nProject. However, exceptions will be considered when the Borrowers can present a convincing\ncase that the subborrower\u2019s financial position is acceptable and that adequate financial controls\nwill be in place to ensure proper accounting of the sources and uses of funds. The $30 million\nallocation under this component will finance 80 percent of all funds channeled through HUDCO,\nHDFC, and ICICI to state and local bodies.\n2. Part B: Reducing Poverty through Innovative Subprojects\n35. The  poverty  reduction  component  of  the  Project  includes  support  for  innovative\nsubprojects falling into two categories: (i) slum networking, and (ii) home workplace schemes.\nThe beneficiaries of these subprojects are predominately the urban poor or EWS households,\nand  given  their  limited  repayment  capacities,  subsidies  are  required  to  support  subproject\nimplementation and the operation and maintenance of basic urban infrastructure and services,\nsuch as water supply, sanitation, drainage, and solid waste management. HUDCO will serve as\nthe Implementing Agency for all of the Part B subprojects and assume full responsibility for\nproject identification, appraisal, implementation, and monitoring. Selection of subprojects will be\non a case-by-case basis and based on criteria aimed at achieving substantial development\nimpacts. Subproject proposals will need to include (i) mechanisms to ensure community and\nprivate  sector  participation  in  subproject  planning,  design,  financing,  implementation,  and\noperation and maintenance; (ii) a clear quantification of subsidies and description of payment", "12\narrangements; and (iii) simple cost-recovery mechanisms. As in part A, the Project will provide\nthat all repayments under this component be re-lent for additional slum networking and home\nworkplace schemes, over the term of the ADB loan. Additionally, both components are eligible\nfor 100 percent financing through the ADB loan.\na. Slum Networking\n36. Slum networking subprojects require the formation of partnerships among community\nresidents,  municipal  corporations,  CFIs,  NGOs,  and  often  times  private  businesses  and\nindustries. The approach focuses on improving all essential services such as water supply,\ndrainage, sanitation, access, and solid waste management within defined slum communities. It\nis estimated that 25 to 30 percent of slum dwellers have home-based production activities, and\nimprovements to water supply, electricity, and sanitation have a direct positive impact on their\nproductivity and incomes. Slum networking also includes a guarantee of tenure, which provides\nthe slum dwellers with the necessary assurance to improve their housing conditions and to\ncontribute financial resources and labor to community-wide improvements. This has proven\nmuch more effective than providing households with title certificates that allow them to sell the\nproperty and move to or establish new slums. The slum networking project in Ahmedabad is\ncited  as  an  example  of  a  successful  partnership  involving  the  Ahmedabad  municipal\ncorporation,  community  residents,  CFIs,  and  local  industries  to  deliver  essential  municipal\nservices to more than 300,000 slum dwellers in the municipality. More than 10 slum networking\nsubprojects have already been identified for consideration under the Project; all are to be based\nupon  a  strong  partnership  approach  from  design  through  implementation.  The  partnership\napproach  represents  a  radical  departure  from  HUDCO\u2019s  traditional  support  for  slum\nimprovement schemes whereby HUDCO provided loans directly to slum improvement boards\nwith minimal involvement in subproject appraisal, implementation, or monitoring. Subborrowers\nunder this component will include municipal authorities and CFIs.  A total of $10 million is\nallocated to HUDCO for financing subprojects under this component, with the maximum subloan\nfor any given subproject to be limited to $2 million.\nb. Home Workplace\n37. Home workplace subprojects are designed to provide financial resources to low-income\nhouseholds that operate cottage industries from their houses for the purpose of improving their\npremises, resulting in increased income potential. It is estimated that 20 million to 30 million\npeople across India are home-based workers; 80 percent are women.16 The subborrowers for\nhome workplace subprojects will consist of handloom and handicraft cooperative societies, as\nwell as various public and private companies that out-source their operations such as beedi\n(tobacco) rolling, weaving, pottery, brass works, footwear, and so on. Due to the low incomes of\nhome-based workers, Government-sponsored home workplace schemes contain an element of\nsubsidy that is released through the state government when an agreement is reached between\nHUDCO  and  the  implementing  agency  on  the  financing  arrangements,  use  of  funds,  and\nrepayment  capacities  of  the  beneficiaries.  The  state  government  also  obtains  a  written\nundertaking from the beneficiaries that the home worksheds financed under the scheme will not\nbe sold or rented to any other person for at least 10 years. HUDCO funds are subsequently\nreleased based on a staged payment schedule, following a review of the physical and financial\nstatus of the schemes. HUDCO has successful ongoing programs for such subprojects with\nworker  societies  and  cooperatives  such  as  the  Tamil  Nadu  Handloom  and  Weavers\nCooperative  Society,  Rajasthan  State  Handloom  Development  Corporation,  and  Rajasthan\n                                                \n16Mahila Housing SEWA Trust and UNDP-World Bank Water and Sanitation Program. 1999. Credit Connections.\nNew Delhi.", "13\nRajya  Bunkar  Sahakry  Sangh  Ltd.  As  the  sole  Implementing  Agency  for  this  component,\nHUDCO will be responsible for onlending $5 million to support home workplace subprojects; the\nmaximum subloan size for any given subproject will be $500,000.\n3. Part  C:  Lending  to  Low-Income  Households  through  Housing  Finance\nInstitutions\n38. This part of the Project is designed to increase share of HFI lending to low-income\nhouseholds. This objective is to be achieved through two channels: (i) expanding the housing\nfinance operations of three HFCs, namely HUDCO, HDFC, and ICICI, to lend directly to low-\nincome  households  through  mortgages  with  market  interest  rates;  and  (ii)  expanding  the\nrefinancing operations of NHB so that smaller HFCs, which will not be Borrowers under the\nProject, will be able to increase their lending to low-income households as well as to CFIs and\nNGOs. As distinct from the low-income households targeted under part A, the low-income\nbeneficiaries of part C are those who do have title to real property to support a mortgage loan.\nSimilar to part A, the Borrowers will make adequate provisions to ensure that repayments under\nthis component are used to refinance loans to low-income households over the life of the ADB\nloan.  ADB funds will refinance 80 percent of all lending under this part to maximize the\nleveraging of the ADB loan and Borrowers' own-source contributions.\na. Direct Lending to Low-Income Households\n39. Low-income households are an unserved segment of the formal housing finance market,\nas HFCs have traditionally focused on lending to middle- and high-income borrowers. The\ntargeted beneficiaries of this component will have average household incomes ranging from\nRs5,000  to  Rs7,000  per  month.  These  households  can  afford  a  mortgage  loan  of  over\nRs165,000 at market-rate terms.17 Combined with family savings and in-kind contributions,\nwhich often amount to the size of the loan, a moderate two- to three-room house could be built\nor purchased. Since the HFP, increased competition in the sector combined with deregulation\nhave resulted in virtual elimination of interest rate differentials by loan size, except for loans by\nHUDCO to EWS households, which currently carry a Government-mandated annual interest\nrate ceiling of 10.5 percent. This situation indicates that the downmarketing of housing finance\nto low-income households is financially viable for HFCs. A total of $115 million has been\ntargeted for this component under the Project to be implemented by HUDCO, HDFC, and ICICI.\nb. Refinancing Loans to Low-Income Households\n40. Another means to promote increased lending by HFCs to low-income households is to\nprovide  NHB  with  financial  resources  specifically  earmarked  to  refinance  HFC  mortgage\nportfolios  comprised  of  housing  loans  to  low-income  households.  This  component  will  be\nimplemented solely by NHB, which has the only refinancing facility among the Borrowers. The\ninstitutions eligible for participation under this component include all HFCs approved by NHB for\nrefinancing, with the exception of HUDCO, HDFC, and ICICI. Given the desired focus on HFCs,\nrefinancing of mortgage loans to low-income households by state apex cooperative housing\nsocieties, state agricultural rural development banks, and state cooperative banks will not be\nfinanced  under  the  Project;  however,  exceptions  may  be  considered  when  NHB  can\ndemonstrate that a given institution's financial position is acceptable and adequate financial\ncontrols are in place to ensure proper accounting of the sources and uses of funds. NHB can\nalso refinance HFC loans to CFIs and NGOs under the CFI refinance scheme; this scheme was\ndeveloped under the ADB TA for Strengthening Housing Finance Institutions (footnote 9) and\n                                                \n17Assuming a mortgage repayment capacity of 30 percent of a monthly income of Rs7,000 per month and a 15-year\nmortgage at 13 percent (HDFC\u2019s unified annual interest rate), the maximum affordable loan size is Rs165,976.", "14\nlaunched in January 1999. While only one loan has been refinanced under the scheme thus far,\nthe Project will encourage more HFCs to lend to CFIs by requiring that NHB direct 20 percent of\nthe funds under this component for CFI refinancing. The total allocation for this component,\ncomprising both the refinancing of low-income housing loans by HFCs and the refinancing of\nHFC loans to CFIs, is $40 million.\nC.  Cost Estimates\n41. The project cost estimates, presented in Table 1, include all the investments in housing\nand related infrastructure improvements expected to be generated through the catalytic effect of\nthe ADB loans. The cost estimates assume that individual households receiving housing loans\nthrough the Project will invest an amount roughly equal to 50 percent of each loan amount\n(Appendix 6).  This assumed beneficiary contribution is very conservative, and based on CFI\nlending records as well as surveys of low-income borrowers. The contribution of household\nsavings, land, and labor often exceeds two times the original loan amount, especially when\nhousehold contributions are tracked over time. This tendency for low-income households to\ncontinue to invest a significant proportion of their disposable income for housing improvements\nis attributed to the economic and social benefits of home ownership. As well as constituting a\nhousehold's most valuable asset, a home provides the physical environment to raise a family\nand  membership  within  a  local  community,  and  often  times  a  place  to  support  income-\ngenerating activities. In addition to the beneficiary contributions, the provision to refinance 80\npercent of all lending under part C, as well as lending to public and private enterprises and state\nand local bodies under part A, will stimulate the Borrowers to contribute own-source funds in an\namount equal to 25 percent of the ADB loan for these components.\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n42. HUDCO, NHB, HDFC, and ICICI have requested loans totaling $300 million equivalent\nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to finance 58 percent of the total project cost. It is\nproposed that ADB finance the entire foreign exchange cost of $61 million and $239 million\nequivalent (52 percent) of the local currency cost. The balance of the project cost will be borne\nby the Borrowers as well as the beneficiary households from their own resources. Table 2\nshows the financing plan.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percent\nADB         61 239 300 58\nHUDCO 0 21 21 4\nNHB 0 10 10 2\nHDFC 0 20 20 4\nICICI 0 20 20 4\nBeneficiaries 0 146 146 28\nTotal         61 456 517 100\nADB = Asian Development Bank, HDFC = Housing Development Finance Corporation, HUDCO = Housing and\nUrban Development Corporation, NHB = National Housing Bank.\n43. The proposed loans will be provided as lines of credit to finance the entire foreign\nexchange cost, and part of the local currency costs (58 percent of the total project cost). The\nactual use of the loans, each of which will be in a fixed amount and guaranteed by the\nGovernment,  will  be  periodically  reviewed  by  ADB  missions  to  assess  the  efficiency  and\neffectiveness of use by the Borrowers. To stimulate financial contributions by the Borrowers,\nADB will finance 80 percent of the total amount disbursed under part C as well as 80 percent of\nall loans channeled through public and private enterprises and state and local bodies under part\nA.\n44. The proposed loan utilization for each Borrower is as follows: HUDCO will receive $100\nmillion and onlend $25 million to CFIs and NGOs, $20 million to public and private enterprises,\n$10 million to state and local bodies, and $30 million to individual low-income households\nthrough retail lending, and use $15 million to support slum networking and home workplace\nsubprojects.  NHB will receive $40 million for refinancing HFC loans to low-income households\nand CFIs.  HDFC will receive $80 million and onlend $5 million to CFIs and NGOs, $20 million\nto public and private enterprises, $10 million to state and local bodies, and $45 million to\nindividual low-income households.  ICICI will receive $80 million and onlend $10 million to CFIs\nand NGOs, $20 million to public and private enterprises, $10 million to state and local bodies\nand $40 million to individual low-income households. These allocations are based on several\ncriteria, including development objectives and impacts, each Borrower's capability to implement\nthe different lending modalities and subprojects, and an assessment of the absorptive capacity\nof  the  different  financial  intermediaries  to  onlend  funds  to  low-income  households.  Such\nallocations also represent lending targets to be achieved by the Borrowers during the project", "16\nimplementation period. Lending targets by project parts and primary Borrowers are detailed in\nAppendix 7.\n45. The four loans will carry interest in accordance with ADB's market-based lending window\nand a front-end fee of 1 percent of the loan amount. In view of the development project\norientation of part B, and the desire to improve the matching of assets and liabilities among the\nHFCs, the loans will have an amortization period of 25 years, including a grace period of 5\nyears. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Borrowers.\n46. The provision for financing local currency costs is considered justified under ADB\u2019s local\ncurrency financing policy.18 With a low per capita income, India is classified as a less developed\ncountry under the United Nations system, and such ADB member countries are to be given\npriority in ADB's local currency financing policy. The public sector saving rate is very low, the\nhousing  finance  sector  in  general  is  weak,  and  consequently,  financing  is  constrained,\nparticularly for the poorest. The central Government and several state governments are taking\nsteps  to  (i)  improve  savings  performance  through  fiscal  consolidation  and  public  sector\nrestructuring, and (ii) improve access to housing through legislative amendments and improved\ntaxation systems and tax administration. Private sector participation in housing finance is being\nstimulated by the implementation of conducive policy reforms including appropriate incentives\nand ongoing liberalization of the financial sector and capital markets. Finally, the Government\nhas  initiated  a  program  to  ensure  availability  of  shelter  for  the  lower  income  groups  by\nencouraging  public  and  private  lending  through  CFIs  and  NGOs,  incorporating  livelihood\nelements and other participatory approaches, and thus resulting in gradual reduction of grant\nelements and improvements in loan repayment rates.\n47. The local currency component of the Project is high because most housing construction\nmaterials are produced locally; this is particularly true for low-income houses. The Project is\nexpected to have a high demonstration and catalytic value in reforming the housing finance\nsector to make it more effective and efficient in improving access of low-income households to\nsources of finance for shelter. It thus has high economic, human development, and poverty-\nreduction values and merits and a relatively high level of local currency financing support, as\nthere is insufficient opportunity for ADB to achieve its objectives by foreign currency lending\nalone.\n48. HUDCO, NHB, HDFC, and ICICI will onlend the loan proceeds in local currency to\nsubborrowers. Accordingly HUDCO, NHB, HDFC, and ICICI will hedge ADB's foreign currency\nloans against foreign-exchange risk through either a foreign-exchange risk cover under an\nappropriate  facility  available  in  the  market  or  a  currency  swap  or  forward  cover,  or  both,\nsatisfactory to ADB. A representative financing structure under a currency swap arrangement,\nsimilar to the arrangement under the HFP, is described in Appendix 8.\nE.  Implementation Arrangements\n49. Each of the four Borrowers will be responsible for implementing their respective project\ncomponents and subprojects in accordance with ADB guidelines and procedures. Lending\nthrough intermediaries under part A will be implemented by HUDCO, HDFC, and, in the case of\nICICI,  through  ICICI  Home  Finance  Company.  Implementation  of  part  B  will  be  the  sole\nresponsibility of HUDCO. Given HUDCO's significant role under parts A and B, HUDCO will\ncreate a full-time project implementation unit (PIU) to ensure proper subproject identification,\nappraisal, implementation, financial reporting, and monitoring. The direct lending to low-income\n                                                \n18R1-95: Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditures on Projects, 3 January.", "17\nhouseholds component of part C will be implemented by HUDCO, HDFC, and, in the case of\nICICI, through ICICI Home Finance Company. NHB will be responsible for implementing the\nrefinancing component of part C. The four borrowing institutions must assume the dollar to\nrupee conversion cost, the associated cost of mitigating the risk of foreign exchange rate\nfluctuations,  and  the  Government  guarantee  fee.  However,  it  is  expected  that  the  longer\nmaturity of the ADB loan will allow the Borrowers to better balance the maturities of their assets\nand liabilities. Each of the Borrowers will be responsible for maintaining separate accounts on\nthe various uses of the loan proceeds.\n1.  Implementation Schedule\n \n50. The Project will be implemented over five years (2000/01 \u2013 2005/06). To ensure timely\nimplementation and in-line with the Government\u2019s emphasis on the disbursement readiness of\napproved loans, each Borrower will prepare a detailed disbursement plan for the first year of the\nProject including associated draft subloan agreements with intermediaries. The closing date for\nsubmission  of  an  application  for  subproject  approval  will  be  four  years  from  the  date  of\neffectiveness of each loan agreement, and for disbursement it will be the loan closing date.\n2.  Approval of Subprojects\n \n51. All four Borrowers are required to submit the first two subprojects under each applicable\nonlending channel or component to ADB for review and approval. All subprojects to be financed\nunder  the  slum  networking  and  home  workplace  components  of  part  B  will  require  ADB\napproval  to  ensure  that  procurement,  environmental,  resettlement,  and  compensation\nprocedures,  as  well  as  other  ADB  conditions,  are  met.  Each  slum  networking  subproject\nproposal  will  include  a  detailed  description  of  the  inputs  and  their  cost;  partnership\narrangements of CFIs, NGOs, municipalities, slum residents, and the private sector; financing\nand cost recovery mechanisms; extent of subsidies involved; any resettlement or compensation\nissues, and a plan to address such issues; and the implementation plan including institutional\nand beneficiary responsibilities, an initial environmental examination of the subproject, and the\nlong-term management and financing plan. Equally important, the subproject description will\ndiscuss the measures incorporated to ensure its sustainability and demonstration value.\n \n3.  Procurement\n \n52. Procurement  under  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines for\nProcurement.  For procurement of goods and services to be financed by the subloans out of the\nloan proceeds, the Borrowers will satisfy ADB that the procurement procedures they applied are\nappropriate in the circumstances. Moreover, they will ensure, and certify to ADB, if requested,\nthat the goods and services to be financed by such subloans are purchased at reasonable\nprices, account being taken of relevant factors such as time of delivery, efficiency, and reliability\nof  goods;  their  suitability  for  the  qualified  housing  proposals  and  slum  subprojects;  the\navailability of maintenance facilities and spare parts; and in the case of services, their quality\nand the competence of the parties rendering them.\n \n4.  Disbursement\n \n53. The Borrowers will disburse subloans under the Project through (i) a separate imprest\naccount of each Borrower, to be established immediately after the effective date of each Loan\nAgreement;  or  (ii)  ADB's  direct  payment,  commitment,  or  reimbursement  procedures.  The\nimprest accounts, which will receive initial advances equivalent to each Borrower\u2019s anticipated\ndisbursements to subborrowers over a six-month period must be set up with local commercial\nbanks acceptable to ADB.  The Borrowers may, from these accounts, make swap or other", "18\nhedging arrangements satisfactory to ADB to cover the foreign exchange rate risk for project-\nrelated expenditures. The imprest accounts will be established, managed, replenished, and\nliquidated in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook, as amended from time to\ntime. ADB's statement of expenditures procedure will be used to liquidate advances provided\ninto the imprest accounts. However, each individual payment reimbursed or liquidated using the\nstatement of expenditure procedure will not exceed $2.0 million equivalent. Other disbursement\nprocedures will be in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook.\n \n 5. Project Supervision and Reporting Requirements\n \n54. Each  Borrower  will  assign  a  project  manager  who  will  be  responsible  for  project\nsupervision, monitoring, accounting, and reporting.  Each Borrower will also submit to ADB a\nquarterly  progress  report  on  commitments  and  disbursements,  implementation  status  of\napproved subprojects, any problems encountered during the quarter under review including any\nmaterial or adverse change in the Borrower\u2019s activities, actions taken or proposed to be taken to\nremedy  those  problems,  and  the  expected  progress  during  the  following  quarter.    The\nBorrowers will establish and maintain accounts and records in such a manner as to facilitate\nidentification of income and expenditures related to the Project. The Borrowers will keep proper\nrecords of all onlending activities under part A, identifying the subborrower or intermediary; the\nsize, term, and interest rate of the loan(s) to subborrowers; the estimated number and income\nlevels of beneficiaries; the purpose(s) and use(s) of loans to the beneficiaries; and the average\nsize, term, and interest rate of loans to the beneficiaries.  Under part B, HUDCO will (i) record\nthe lending terms of subloans for slum networking and home workplace subprojects, as well as\nprepare an assessment of the financial position of the subborrowers; and (ii) ensure that it has\naccess to the list of beneficiaries. For part C, the Borrowers will maintain proper lending records\nthat indicate the monthly household income levels of the borrowers, the purpose(s) of the loan\n(i.e., new house construction, home improvement, etc.), the security held for each mortgage,\nand the size, term, and interest rate of each loan. For part C, as well as for the onlending to\npublic and private enterprises and state and local bodies under part A, the Borrowers will\nmaintain adequate records to show that ADB funds were used to finance 80 percent of total\nlending through these channels.\n6. Accounts and Audit\n \n55. Each  Borrower  will  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  of  its  annual  audited  financial\nstatements and the auditor\u2019s report within nine months of completion of the fiscal year.  All of\nthe accounts and statements of expenditures and revenues will be audited annually by auditors\nacceptable to ADB. Audited project accounts, together with the report of the auditor, will be\nsubmitted to ADB within nine months of the close of the financial year. In addition to the audited\nproject accounts, the Borrowers will submit audited annual financial statements through the life\nof the loan. Each Borrower will also submit to ADB, not later than three months after the loan\nclosing  date,  a  completion  report  on  loan  utilization,  subproject  implementation,  and  the\nperformance of intermediaries and subborrowers with respect to onlending funds to low-income\nhouseholds for housing purchase, construction, or improvement.\n \n7. Periodic Reviews\n \n56. At its discretion, but at least once every six months, ADB will conduct reviews of the\nmanagement, financial, and operational performance of the Borrowers with respect to project\nactivities and their compliance with implementation of the Policy and Institutional Action Plan\n(Appendix 4). The plan may be modified during project implementation by agreement of the\nGovernment,  Borrowers,  and  ADB,  and  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the", "19\nrequirements and schedules set forth therein. A midterm review will be conducted by the end of\n2003 with participation of the involved parties. The objectives of the midterm review are to\n(i) review  the  progress  achieved  relative  to  the  targets  set  for  each  project  component;\n(ii) assess the degree of accomplishments in meeting the Policy and Institutional Action Plan\ntargets and revise targets as appropriate; (iii) reexamine the project design, implementation\narrangements, and other relevant aspects; and (iv) formulate, within the updated sector setting\nand  other  changes  in  circumstances  at  the  time  of  the  review,  any  changes  to  ensure\nsuccessful  project  implementation,  achievement  of  project  objectives,  and  sustainability  of\nproject benefits. In addition, independent project impact evaluations will be organized by the\nGovernment in the second and fourth years following commencement.\n \n8. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n57. To ensure that the target beneficiaries are realizing the anticipated benefits, the Project\nincludes  a  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME)  program  to  be  undertaken  by  the\nBorrowers.  The BME program will (i) monitor the Project\u2019s implementation performance, which\nwill mainly deal with the efficiency and effectiveness of the different onlending arrangements; (ii)\nmonitor the Project\u2019s operational performance, mainly in terms of the Borrowers achieving their\nrespective lending targets; and (iii) evaluate the Borrowers' performance during and after project\nimplementation. The key monitoring indices, in addition to targets and actions set forth in the\nproject framework (Appendix 1) and policy and institutional action plan (Appendix 4), will be (i)\ninternal efficiency of sublending operations, (ii) satisfaction of demand for finance, (iii) level of\nbeneficiary participation, (iv) ability to service target groups, (v) financial impact on Borrowers\nand subborrowers, (vi) sustainability of strengthened linkages between HFIs and CFIs, and (vii)\nsocioeconomic impact on low-income beneficiaries. The BME information system design will be\nbased on ADB\u2019s Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation Handbook and carefully tailored to meet the\nconditions in the Project.  The Borrowers will provide ADB with the information produced under\nthe BME program in the first quarterly report for each calendar year.\nF. The Borrowers\n58. The Borrowers represent Government-sponsored, regulatory, and private sector housing\nfinance institutions. All four institutions have borrowed from ADB in the past, and their sound\nfinancial management and performance qualifies them to participate in the Project as Borrowers\nand Executing Agencies. A brief description of each of the four Borrowers follows.\n1. Housing and Urban Development Corporation\n59. HUDCO was incorporated in April 1970 as a wholly Government-owned company to\npromote housing and urban development, particularly for the low-income and economically\nweaker sections of society. As the first financial institution dealing exclusively with the housing\nsector, its establishment marked the beginning of formal housing finance in India. HUDCO is\nregistered under the Companies Act as a public limited company and run by a board of directors\nconsisting of professionals appointed by Government. Its corporate office is located in New\nDelhi, and it has 5 zonal, 16 regional, and 12 development offices throughout the country. Its\ncurrent operations are divided between housing and infrastructure finance through state and\nlocal agencies. In the past year it began to lend directly to individuals for housing through its\nHUDCO Niwas retail lending window.\n60. HUDCO currently has authorized capital of Rs12.5 billion ($290.7 million) and paid-in\ncapital of Rs5.8 billion ($135 million). The cumulative number of housing and infrastructure\nschemes sanctioned through 31 March 1999 is 14,623. Loans sanctioned total Rs230.55 billion,", "20\nof which housing comprises Rs146.04 billion. Cumulative disbursements through 31 March\n1999 were Rs154.73 billion, and the total number of dwelling units financed through the same\nperiod are almost 8.6 million. As a wholly owned Government institution, HUDCO is mandated\nto lend at least 55 percent of its funds to low-income groups and the EWS. Since the majority of\nits lending is through state and local bodies for which cost recovery from borrowers has been\npoor, HUDCO has required state guarantees for such lending. Hence, prior to the early 1990s,\ncost recovery and rigid appraisal were not vigorously pursued. Recent economic reforms and\nthe decline of Government funds for such schemes have made states increasingly reluctant to\nissue guarantees. HUDCO has therefore undergone fundamental changes in recent years; it is\nassisting its borrowers to achieve improved cost recovery techniques, and assisting state and\nlocal  bodies  to  adopt  reforms  such  as  commercialization  of  selected  urban  infrastructure\nprojects. The ongoing ADB TA to strengthen state-level housing finance agencies (footnote 10)\nwill also serve to improve HUDCO\u2019s lending and cost recovery.\n2.  National Housing Bank\n61. NHB was established in July 1988 to function as the apex body for the housing finance\nsector. It is wholly owned by the Reserve Bank of India, and has an authorized and fully paid-up\nshare capital of Rs3.5 billion ($81.4 million). NHB\u2019s three primary responsibilities are to mobilize\nresources  for  the  housing  sector,  promote  the  development  of  HFCs,  and  regulate  the\noperations of HFCs. As a promoter, NHB provides financial support to HFCs and facilitates\naccess to institutional credit. It provides refinancing to 29 HFCs and other entities according to a\nrefinancing schedule whereby refinance rates are based on loan sizes.  As a regulator, NHB\nsets prudential norms for HFCs based on required capital adequacy ratios, income recognition,\nasset classification, and acceptable levels of nonperforming assets.\n62. As of December 1999, NHB had refinanced a total of Rs47.6 billion ($1.11 billion) for\nthree categories of approved borrowers: HFCs, scheduled banks, and cooperative institutions.\nHFCs account for 77 percent of all refinancing; cooperative institutions for 18 percent, and\nscheduled banks for 5 percent. Lately, due to the decline in interest rates in the country,\nscheduled banks have not taken any refinancing from NHB, although they have increased their\nlending for housing. In January 1999, the NHB board approved a new refinancing scheme for\nCFIs under which any approved institution, mainly HFCs, could avail of refinancing for loans\nmade to CFIs. Only one HFC has accessed this facility. Over the past few years, NHB has been\npreparing to undertake a pilot issue of MBS. It has obtained approval from the Reserve Bank of\nIndia for such an issue, drafted the necessary legal documents, appointed merchant bankers for\nthe  offer,  prepared  an  operations  and  accounting  manual,  and  discussed  the  issue  with\ninterested investors. The pilot issue is expected to come to market in the near future.\n3. Housing Development Finance Corporation\n63. HDFC was established in 1977 as the first specialized housing finance institution in the\ncountry. The company was promoted by ICICI with initial equity investments by the International\nFinance Corporation and his Royal Highness, the Aga Khan. HDFC is a public limited company\nspecializing in the provision of housing finance to individual borrowers. As the only private\nhousing finance institution at the time, it grew rapidly and is still considered the market leader in\nthe  retail  housing  finance  business.  The  majority  of  HDFC\u2019s  loans  are  to  individuals  who\ncurrently number over 800,000. To reach lower income borrowers, HDFC has utilized several\nlines of credit from KfW to finance various projects for low-income households as well as loans\nto CFIs.", "21\n64. As of 31 March 2000, HDFC\u2019s paid-up capital was Rs1.20 billion ($27.60 million); its net\nworth  was  Rs20.96  billion  ($481.84  million).  As  a  publicly  listed  company,  its  shares  are\nregularly  traded  on  the  stock  exchange.  As  of  March  2000  the  company  had  116,000\nshareholders. It has 67 branches throughout the country, and some 47,000 agents who collect\ndeposits and submit loan applications where there are no branches. HDFC\u2019s major source of\nfunds is deposits through various deposit schemes tailored to different types of depositors. It\nalso raises funds through bond and debenture issues, long-term loans from domestic and\ninternational finance institutions, and NHB refinancing. A new source of finance will be through\nthe  pilot securitization issue of HDFC mortgages. In its efforts to diversify, HDFC has also\nestablished an infrastructure finance services company, a credit-rating company, consumer\nfinance companies, a property management company, and a bank.\n4. ICICI\n65. ICICI was established in 1955 under an initiative of the Government, the World Bank,\nand representatives of Indian industries. Since that time, ICICI has developed into a universal\nbanking group with 18 subsidiaries and affiliates. ICICI operations include medium- and long-\nterm project finance, corporate finance, leasing, and other types of financial and advisory\nservices. Until recent years, ICICI\u2019s operations concentrated on project-based lending to the\nmanufacturing sector. In response to the changing economic and financial environment, ICICI\nhas  taken  steps  to  diversify  its  operations  with  an  increasing  focus  on  corporate  and\ninfrastructure financing.  As a result of this diversification, ICICI\u2019s asset base has continued to\ngrow. Disbursements increased by 34 percent from Rs192.25 billion ($4.42 billion) in FY1999 to\nRs258.36 billion ($5.94 billion) in FY2000, while total assets increased by 11.16 percent, from\nRs538.57 billion ($12.38 billion) in FY1999 to Rs598.659 billion ($13.76 billion) in FY2000.\nDuring the same period loan approvals increased by 38 percent from Rs323.17 billion ($7.43\nbillion) in FY1999 to Rs447.79 billion ($10.29 billion) in FY2000 indicating a strong pipeline of\nbusiness.\n66. ICICI was not a Borrower under the HFP, and the primary justification for its inclusion in\nthe Project is to promote greater competition, especially given ICICI's size and its ability to have\na significant impact on India's housing finance sector. In 1998/99 ICICI began to provide the\nentire range of personal loans to individuals, including housing finance, automobile financing,\nand consumer durable finance. ICICI Home Finance Company was established during this\nperiod as a 100 percent subsidiary to provide focus to ICICI's housing finance initiative. As of\nMarch 2000, ICICI Home Finance Company approved housing loans for Rs2.57 billion ($59.08\nmillion), while disbursements total Rs0.765 billion ($17.60 million). ICICI\u2019s corporate recognition\nas well as the group\u2019s large retail customer base and wide distribution network give it a strategic\nadvantage in entering the housing finance sector. Utilizing its corporate relationships, ICICI\u2019s\ngeographic reach is nationwide, with 90 branches, 55 service centers, and 9 locations serviced\nby  direct  marketing  agents.  Cumulative  disbursements  of  ICICI  Home  Finance  Company\nprojects are projected to be Rs123 million ($2.83 million) by FY2006.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n67. All three parts of the Project will increase the availability of housing finance for the\npurchase,  improvement,  extension,  and  construction  of  housing  for  low-income  families.\nImproved housing and living conditions also mean better environmental conditions, both at the\nhousehold and community levels, thereby contributing to a better quality of life, improved family\nhealth, and greater environmental awareness and pride of community. In the long run, better\neconomic  conditions,  resulting  from  the  associated  benefits  of  improved  housing  and", "22\nneighborhood  infrastructure,  will  enable  communities  to  sustain  additional  environmental\nimprovements.\n68. Housing improvements financed under the Project will have a strong positive impact on\nthe immediate living environment for women and children who spend much of their time at\nhome. Better ventilation, increased usable space, and adequate lighting will have a positive\nimpact on conditions within the house itself. The use of solid, better quality building materials\nand construction practices will reduce household vulnerability to fire, building collapse, rodents,\nand in many cases, flooding or standing water.\n69. Under the slum networking component of part B, the Project will finance improvements\nin selected urban slums. Access to clean water in these areas is scarce and many households\nhave either no toilet facilities or use latrines that discharge directly into drains and open water\nbodies. Exposure to human waste is exacerbated by the inadequacy of drainage and by the\nimproper disposal of solid waste. In addition, slums are often situated in low-lying areas that are\nsubject  to  flooding  during  the  monsoon  season.  Without  adequate  drainage  and  sewage,\nwastewater  mixes  with  storm  water  and  creates  conditions  for  the  spread  of  waterborne\ndiseases.\n70. The slum networking component will also have direct positive impacts on family health\nand the surrounding environment by improving community water supply and sanitation, solid\nwaste management, and drainage. All of these efforts will reduce the incidence of waterborne\ndisease.  The  active  involvement  of  local  communities  in  the  conception,  implementation,\nfinancing, and maintenance of slum networking projects will complement and reinforce these\nbenefits, ensure greater cost recovery and sustainability, create subproject ownership, and\npromote greater awareness of environmental issues.\n71. The only potential adverse environmental impact of the Project could be the disruption of\npublic  services  and  transportation  during  the  construction  phase  for  slum  networking\nsubprojects;  however,  given  the  relatively  small  scale  and  labor-intensive  nature  of  such\nsubprojects, these disruptions are expected to be minor and can be easily mitigated through\nappropriate  measures.  Initial  environmental  examinations  will  be  prepared  for  each  slum\nnetworking subproject to identify and minimize any potential adverse environmental impacts.\nThese assessments will be submitted to ADB for review to ensure that they comply with its\nenvironmental guidelines.\n2. Social Analysis\n72. Social aspects of lending to low-income households are presented in Appendix 9, which\nsummarizes the results of a comprehensive survey of CFIs, NGOs, and low-income borrowers.\nThe Project will focus on extending loans to low-income households that are currently unable to\naccess  housing  finance  from  the  formal  sector.  It  will  involve  CFI  and  NGO  networking,\ncommunity participation, and the education and empowerment of low-income groups to support\nsustainable improvements in their social well-being.  With the exception of the direct lending\ncomponent of part C, the Project will have a high degree of community engagement in all of its\ncomponents and strong positive social impacts.", "23\na. Profile of Project Beneficiaries\n73. Project beneficiaries will be low-income households with monthly incomes of Rs7,000 or\nless. Under the CFI and NGO lending component of part A, beneficiaries, for the most part, will\nbe  members  of  self-help  groups  in  urban  and  peri-urban  areas  with  a  positive  record  of\nborrowing and repaying small loans. The majority of these households will be able to afford loan\nrepayments between Rs250 and Rs500 per month. Most of the beneficiaries will be women.\nThe beneficiaries under other project parts will include slum dwellers, low-income employees\nfrom public and private sector enterprises, state and local government workers, home-based\nworkers,  and  individual  borrowers.  All  of  these  beneficiaries  will  be  part  of  households\ninterested  in  building  or  improving  individual  housing,  but  unable  to  access  market-based\nhousing finance through formal channels.\nb. Beneficiary Impacts\n74. The Project will have a strong positive impact on three levels of beneficiaries. First,\nindividual low-income households will benefit directly from increased access to market-based\nhousing finance that, in turn, will provide for  (i) a safe, secure, and more comfortable place in\nwhich to live and raise a family; (ii) a higher standard of living that enhances a family\u2019s social\nstatus and improves its children\u2019s prospects for marriage; and (iii) a greater degree of residential\nand household stability due to the possession, in many cases by women, of a valuable fixed\nasset. Also at the household level, improved housing will have several economic impacts that\ninclude savings in rent; ownership of a long-term asset with a generally appreciating value;\nimproved infrastructure and services resulting in more time for productive activities; a healthier\nenvironment,  particularly  for  home-based  workers  and  children;  and  the  establishment  of\nacceptable collateral that can be used to obtain additional credit. Second, self-help groups and\nslum  neighborhoods  will  be  organized  and  trained  to  work  closely  with  CFIs  and  other\ndevelopment partners. Finally, the capacities of HFIs, CFIs, and NGOs  will be strengthened to\nincrease and sustain their lending to low-income households.\nc. Impact on Women\n75. Women will constitute the majority of subborrowers from CFIs and NGOs for housing\nloans under part A, as well as for home workplace improvement loans under part B. Their active\nparticipation in self-help groups provides opportunities to empower them in household and\ncommunity  decision  making  and  to  address  their  immediate  housing  and  neighborhood\nconcerns. The use of project funds for housing will provide women with an important physical\nand financial asset that will substantially increase their status and security within the household\nas well as in their communities. Since women have the ultimate child-rearing responsibilities,\nthe right and security to land and property will also help safeguard the family\u2019s interests. Women\nand children are particularly affected by poor  housing conditions and the lack of clean water\nand proper sanitation facilities. Better living conditions, and improved community services and\nfacilities will reduce the vulnerability of women and children to disease, diminish the drudgery of\nmany household tasks, and provide more time for income-generating activities.\nd. Community Participation\n76. Many components of the Project will be community-driven, not only in terms of\ntraditional levels of participation, but also in terms of developing community ownership and\nproviding support to people-driven initiatives. Support for CFI lending, for instance,  will catalyze\nthe development of savings groups and other forms of community participation. Emphasis will\nbe  placed  not  only  on  delivering  basic  housing  and  services  to  the  poor,  but  also  on", "24\nempowering the low-income segment of the population through the establishment of sustainable\ngrassroots processes and institutions. The creation of working partnerships among CFIs, slum\nneighborhoods, and municipal authorities will be one of the primary conditions for the selection\nof slum networking subprojects. These subprojects will provide a legitimate arena for local\ncommunity  institutions  to  act  as  civic  institutions  and  to  establish  viable  partnerships  with\nmainstream agencies for housing and infrastructure development, as well as ongoing operation\nand maintenance activities.\nH. Policy Issues\n77. The Project emphasizes the establishment of a comprehensive and conducive policy,\ninstitutional,  and  regulatory  environment  to  foster  the  development  of  sustainable  housing\nfinance mechanisms to meet the housing finance needs of low-income households.  During\nproject  preparation,  a  number  of  policy  reform  measures  to  improve  the  efficiency  and\ncompetitiveness of the housing finance delivery system were identified. These policy reform\nmeasures,  presented  in  Appendix  4,  will  be  periodically  and  jointly  reviewed  by  ADB\nadministration  missions,  the  Borrowers,  and  the  Government  against  progress  achieved.\nFollowing such reviews, actions and schedules will be amended, if deemed appropriate. The\nprincipal project-related policy reform measures and initiatives are outlined here.\n1. Strengthen Linkages between the Formal and Informal Sectors\n78. The informal sector represents the primary means for low-income households without\ncollateral to access loans for housing. Experience clearly demonstrates that CFIs are important\nand viable channels for lending to low-income households on a market-based and sustainable\nbasis. However, CFIs also suffer from a lack of capital to expand their lending operations. To\nbridge this gap between the demand for housing loans and the financial resources available to\nCFIs, formal finance sector linkages with CFIs must be financially viable. Toward this objective,\nHFIs need to develop in-house expertise in microcredit lending, develop rating criteria for CFIs\nbased on their lending records and repayment capacities, standardize and streamline loan\nprocessing procedures, and develop innovative financing structures such as escrow accounts,\nguarantee funds, and revolving funds to mitigate the potential risks associated with lending\nthrough  CFIs.  Additionally,  NHB  needs  to  encourage  HFCs  to  extend  credit  to  CFIs  by\nexpanding its CFI refinancing window. To strengthen linkages between the formal and informal\nhousing finance sectors, TA will be provided for CFIs to inform and educate the Borrowers\nabout microfinance and specifically the lending operations, systems, and procedures of CFIs\ninvolved in housing finance.\n2. Support Market-Based Housing Finance\n79. The Government must come to recognize that mandated interest rates serve as a\ndisincentive for lending to lower income groups. The due diligence costs for smaller loans\ncoupled with the higher risks of uncollateralized lending result in an interest rate premium\nrelative to larger, collateralized loans. Failure to recognize this basic market principle has\nresulted in a severe shortage of financing available to lower income groups, and the financing\nthat is available commands usurious interest rates from informal moneylenders. While it is true\nthat  increased  competition  in  the  housing  finance  sector  has  contributed  to  the  virtual\nelimination of a Government-defined tiered interest rate structure, as well as the interest rate\ncap of 12 percent for loans to microfinance institutions, mandated interest rates remain for EWS\nhouseholds.  Acknowledging  the  Government\u2019s  desire  to  ensure  that  housing  loans  are\naffordable to the poorest of the poor, the gap between existing mandated interest rates and\nmarket interest rates for EWS loans should be narrowed. The Project will also promote market-", "25\nbased lending to CFIs to ensure the commercial and financial viability and sustainability of\nlinkages between formal and informal sector HFIs.\n3. Raise Corporate Governance Standards for Public Institutions\n80. Liberalization  of  India\u2019s  financial  sector  has  highlighted  the  need  for  public  sector\ninstitutions to raise their corporate governance standards to improve their financial conditions,\nmanagement practices, and operational efficiencies. For HUDCO and NHB, the Project will\nrequire that each institution take specific steps to improve corporate governance by establishing\nan  independent  board  audit  committee  with  specified  composition,  powers,  and  functions,\nboard-specified code of conduct and ethics, and reporting on corporate governance compliance\nas part of the annual report. As such HDFC and ICICI will be required to demonstrate that they\nare in compliance with the corporate governance standards prescribed in the Kumar Mangalam\nCommittee's Report.\n4. Improve Subproject Appraisal and Implementation\n81. The financial condition of states across India is generally poor and consequently many\nstates are reluctant to offer guarantees on loans from both public and private sector institutions.\nGiven  the  significant  volume  of  state  lending  by  HUDCO,  this  situation  has  significant\nimplications for how HUDCO needs to improve its internal appraisal procedures for its state-\nlevel lending operations. In addition, at the subproject level, greater attention needs to be\ndirected by HUDCO to ensuring the financial viability of slum improvement schemes as well as\nincorporating the requisite degree of community participation to promote greater subproject\nownership, cost recovery, and sustainability. The requirement that HUDCO establish a fully\noperational  PIU  is  expected  to  increase  HUDCO's  capacity  in  these  areas.  Additionally,\nassistance  is  envisaged  for  the  design,  appraisal,  and  implementation  of  slum  networking\nsubprojects,  with  particular  attention  directed  at  ensuring  that  the  preparation  of  such\nsubprojects is in accordance with ADB's social, environmental, and economic guidelines.\n5. Implement Foreclosure Regulations and Provisions\n82. An important provision of the amendment to the NHB Act, enacted in May 2000, is to\nenable HFIs to foreclose on mortgages for defaulting loans in an expeditious manner through\nmortgagee power of sale without  intervention.  However, to make these provisions operational\nrequires regulations under the amended NHB Act on procedures for mortgagee power of sale\nwithout  court  intervention,  HFI  debt  recovery  appellate  tribunals,  and  preservation  of  the\nexercise of mortgagee power of sale without court intervention notwithstanding judicial review\nunder the NHB Act as amended.  As the apex regulatory body for the housing sector, NHB will\ntake  the  lead  in  preparing  these  regulations  for  the  concurrence  of  the  Government  and\nReserve Bank of India, as these are to be issued under the NHB Act, as amended.\n6. Improve the Mortgage Registration System\n83. To  avoid  stamp  duties,  HFCs  across  India  have  increasingly  been  using  equitable\nmortgages rather than the traditional or standard \"English\" mortgage. Equitable mortgages,\nwhich may comprise as much as 80 percent of the market for new mortgages in India, are\nlegally recognized and enforceable under the Transfer of Property Act of 1882. Such mortgage\ninstruments were originally created to facilitate merchant transactions without being burdened\nby high stamp duties. Equitable mortgages are not registered, but the original title deeds are\ndeposited with the mortgagee who, in turn, typically provides the mortgagor with a record of\nreceipt. Potential issues or problems with the proliferation of equitable mortgages include (i) the", "26\npossibility that states could take action to recoup stamp duties; (ii) their use is restricted to\ncertain geographic areas per the Transfer of Property Act; (iii) they do not allow for appointment\nof receivers or any foreclosure remedy without court intervention; (iv) there is lack of registration\nand  consequent  lack  of  public  notice;  and  (v)  they  cannot  be  securitized  without  being\nregistered and thereby subjected to stamp duties. Given the complex legal, financial, and\npolitical issues involved in addressing equitable mortgages, registration, and stamp duties, the\nProject  requires  that  a  working  group  comprising  representatives  of  Government,  NHB,\nHUDCO, HDFC, and ICICI be established to prepare a policy paper on improving the mortgage\nregistration system in India.\n7. Expand the Capital Market for Housing Finance\n84. NHB has played an important and essential role in addressing the many complex legal,\nregulatory, and financing issues associated with structuring the first pilot mortgage securitization\nissue in India. To build upon this process, NHB must assess the lessons learned from this\nexperience  in  the  context  of  other  MBS  markets  in  Asia  as  well  as  in  developed  market\neconomies, and define the requisite reform measures that are necessary to develop India\u2019s\nMBS market. The progressive development of the MBS market in India also presents some\nfundamental  questions  regarding  NHB\u2019s  future  role  in  the  sector.  NHB\u2019s  traditional  role  in\nrefinancing  HFC  mortgages,  for  example,  will  undoubtedly  change,  and  NHB  should  take\ndefinitive steps to operationalize and expand its CFI refinancing scheme. Whether NHB should\nassume the role of \u201cmarket maker,\u201d given its regulatory mandate, needs further consideration to\nensure  an  efficient  and  competitive  housing  finance  sector  in  India.  ADB  will  assist  NHB\naddress  many  of  these  complex  yet  fundamental  issues  related  to  the  future  growth  and\ndevelopment of India's housing finance sector.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n85. The shortage of housing in India is severe. It is estimated to be as high as 40 million\nunits. This directly impacts on the quality of life of low-income households, and the economically\nweaker sections of society. The lack of access to affordable housing finance is the most serious\nproblem facing low-income households in India who wish to improve their living conditions.\nThrough the different lending modalities, the Project is expected to directly benefit more than\n270,000 low-income households, or more than 1.3 million people. The recycling or relending of\nADB funds will maximize the impact of the loan, resulting in a total of more than 500,000\nhousing loans benefiting approximately 2.7 million people over the loan period.  Additionally,\nADB funds will serve to leverage financial contributions on behalf of the Borrowers as well as\nthe low-income beneficiaries who will contribute land, labor, and household savings to housing\nimprovements. Once low-income families, who already have  stable incomes, obtain access to\nhousing credit, they invest several times the original loan amount in improving their housing\nover time. This is in contrast to the conventional provision of housing finance to higher income\ngroups who move into a completed house and amortize the debt over time. From the financial\nperspective, the onlending arrangements are designed to be financially viable and sustainable\nthrough market-based lending whereby the financial intermediaries obtain a sufficient spread to\ncover their associated cost of operations.\n86. Given  the  basic  linkage  between  improved  housing  and  human  welfare,  human\ndevelopment will be enhanced through increased availability of market-based housing finance\nto support new construction, home improvements, or home workplace activities. Although many\nof the benefits that will accrue as a result of improved housing conditions are difficult to quantify,\nmost are based on the connection to improved health and its relation to increased productivity.\nThe availability of loans for housing from CFIs and other financial intermediaries will also enable", "27\nlow-income  households  to  establish  credit.  In  addition,  basic  infrastructure  and  essential\nservices provided as part of the slum networking subprojects will improve the living and health\nconditions of slum dwellers, as well as promote partnerships of community residents, CFIs,\nNGOs, private enterprises, and municipal authorities.\nA. Economic Analysis\n87. Detailed economic internal rate of return analyses have not been carried out for the slum\nnetworking or home workplace subprojects as neither their precise subproject locations nor final\nterms and uses of funds is available. Additionally, the benefits associated with these types of\nsubprojects are difficult to quantify. Among these are health benefits resulting from improved\nwater  supply,  sanitation,  drainage,  and  solid  waste  management;  safety  benefits  and  less\nproperty damage due to reduced flooding and fires; land tenure benefits associated with the\nenhanced  security  of  tenure;  and  increased  productivity  and  access  to  education  due  to\nimproved health and access to work and schools. For home workplace subprojects, there is\nalso the financial benefit to the individual household deriving from home improvements to\nsupport income-generating activities. Although property value increases associated with slum\nnetworking  subprojects  are  often  used  to  calculate  improved  economic  opportunities  and\nbenefits, this methodology is not appropriate given that (i) property value increases are subject\nto various influences, including speculation; (ii) these increases may be regarded as a transfer\nbetween buyer and seller; and (iii) Government could impose a windfall tax on the increase, and\nsuch a tax, as a transfer, would not be measured as an economic benefit.\nB. Financing Justification\n88. The justification for lending long-term dollars to finance the rupee costs and cash flows\nrequired in India\u2019s housing finance sector is based on a number of considerations. Housing\nfinance, to be sustainable and available to all segments of society, requires an efficient and\nfunctioning  long-term  debt  (bond)  market.    Such  a  market  does  not  exist  in  India  today.\nCurrently, long-term debt maturities in the private sector range from 3 to 7 years, and up to a\nmaximum of 10 years for government institutions. However, sufficient investor appetite for\nsecurities over five years is lacking, and even the best issuers cannot count on raising funds on\na sustainable basis for maturities over 3 to 5 years. HFIs are forced to rely on short-term\ndeposits (typically with a 36-month maximum term) for more than 50 percent of their funding,\nwith the balance coming from 3- to 5-year borrowings and some multilateral assistance. At the\nsame time, mortgages are normally for a period of 15, sometimes 20, years. This situation\ncreates an asset-liability mismatch for these financing institutions, exacerbated by the absence\nof prepayment penalties and the lack of adjustable rate lending. As a result, virtually all HFIs\nwithout proper in-house asset-liability management expertise and access to long-term funding\nare at significant risk.\n89. The ADB loan is not providing long-term rupees for housing finance. Rather, by its\nstructure, the loan is creating the means to allow commercial sources of local currency to\nprovide long-term rupee financing to the participating Borrowers. The long-term rupee funds\nallow  the  Borrowers  to  offer  affordable  interest  rates  and  longer  maturities.  The  \u201cswap\u201d\narrangement achieves this by removing both the present and future potential adverse risks of\nforeign  exchange  rate  fluctuations,  interest  and  principle  repayments,  and  asset-liability\nmismatch. The underlying value of the ADB loan lies in its ability to generate long-term rupee\nfinancing for housing and the associated demonstration value of the need to create domestic\nlong-term debt markets, given that foreign sources of finance are neither sustainable nor long-\nterm solution.", "28\nC. Subsidies\n90. Subsidies represent a very small part of the overall Project. The majority of project funds\nare targeted to low-income households at market rates of interest. Subsidies are not required\nfor project funds that will be onlent through CFIs, enterprises, state and local bodies, or under\ndirect  lending.  Onlending  arrangements  are  structured  to  provide  the  Borrowers  and\nsubborrowers with sufficient spreads to cover their operational costs, risk premiums, and project\nmargins. Subsidies are only required, in part, for the slum networking and home workplace\ncomponents of part B.\n91. For the slum networking component, capital investments will be financed through a\ncombination of loans from HUDCO to local government bodies, usually municipal corporations;\ncontributions  from  beneficiary  households;  and  grant  financing  from  central  and  state\ngovernments,  international  funding  agencies,  and  private  sector  sources.  Slum  networking\nsubprojects are typically structured to include approximately 70 percent subsidization of the\ncapital  costs  associated  with  basic  infrastructure  improvements  including  water  supply,\nsanitation,  drainage,  street  lighting,  and  solid  waste  management;  government  grants  and\ncontributions from international funding agencies and the private sector constitute the principal\nsource of such subsidies. The remaining 30 percent of capital costs is borne by the slum\nresidents who are organized into associations by CFIs, and contribute through a combination of\nan  up-front  payment  and  weekly  or  monthly  installments.  Depending  upon  the  financing\narrangements, operation and maintenance costs are often partially subsidized with provisions\nthat the local communities will assume an increasing share of operation and maintenance costs\nover time through different cost-recovery mechanisms. This cost-sharing arrangement will only\nbe possible, however, if communities feel they have ownership of the subprojects.\n92. For  the  home  workplace  component  of  part  B,  subsidies  are  provided  by  state\ngovernments. A large number of organized workers are involved in weaving, beedi rolling,\nhandicrafts, and other types of home-based work in rural and semirural India. Virtually all of\nthese workers belong to unions or cooperatives, and are in the lowest income category. To be\neligible under the government-supported home workplace program, beneficiaries must earn at\nleast  50  percent  of  their  income  from  home-based  work.  The  current  program  provides\nsubsidies  from  state  governments  to  specified  implementing  agencies  that  include  unions,\ncooperatives, and other state apex institutions. The cost of an eligible housing unit, whether\nbuilt by the implementing agency or by the individual, is estimated at Rs44,000 in urban areas\nand Rs35,000 in rural areas. The subsidy component is generally Rs20,000 per unit or about 45\npercent  of  its  cost.  The  beneficiary  contribution,  through  any  combination  of  cash,  land,\nmaterials, and labor, is about 10 percent. HUDCO provides loans through cooperatives to\nindividual households for the remaining 45 percent. State subsidies are released only upon\nissuance of the HUDCO loan. The subsidies under the home workplace component are justified\ndue to the very low incomes of the beneficiaries, and the fact that a great number of home\nworkers are women.\nD. Affordability\n93. An affordability analysis was conducted for parts A and C of the Project to ensure that\nthe loans provided under the different project components will not create an undue financial\nburden on the ultimate beneficiaries. The results of the analysis are summarized in Appendix\n10. Loan repayment schedules for different loan sizes were calculated on a monthly basis for\neach of the components and compared with the maximum household income of EWS, low-\nincome  group  (LIG)  and  middle-income  group  (MIG)  households.  Affordability  limits  were\ndefined as the maximum percentage of monthly household income that households could apply", "29\nto repay the loan, namely 15 percent for EWS, 20 percent for LIG, and 30 percent for MIG\nhouseholds. The graduated scale is due to the fact that very low-income households have less\ndisposable income for housing expenses, as a percentage of their total incomes, than higher\nincome households.\n94. Under  part  A,  which  will  facilitate  access  to  housing  finance  through  financial\nintermediaries, a repayment period of five years and an annual interest rate of 18 percent is\nassumed. The interest rate is a conservative estimate and includes the interest rate charged by\nthe Borrowers to the intermediary plus the spread charged from the intermediary to the final\nborrowers. The results of the analysis demonstrate that borrowers of the EWS group will be\nable to afford a loan up to Rs15,000. LIG borrowers will be able to borrow up to Rs45,000 and\nMIG households with an income of up to Rs7,000 per month will be able to borrow up to\nRs80,000.\n95. For the direct lending component of part C, the interest rate is assumed to be 13 percent\nper annum with a 15-year repayment period. While the affordable percentages of income for\neach income group are assumed to be the same as those in part A, in practice many HFCs\napply a flat rate of 30 percent of income when they analyze the repayment capacity of potential\nborrowers. The resulting analysis shows that EWS households will not be able to access loans\nunder this component. LIG households will be able to afford loans up to Rs90,000, and MIG\nhouseholds earning up to Rs7,000 per month will be able to access loans of up to about\nRs165,000. The results of the analysis demonstrates that part C of the Project will allow many\nlow- and moderate-income households direct access to market rate loans for construction and\nimprovement of their houses.\nE. Impact on Poverty\n96. Lending to low-income households will have a significant impact on the reduction of\npoverty. Access to housing finance will reinforce a process of steady incremental improvements\nin household incomes by providing the means to finance the construction of better living, as well\nas home workplace conditions that, in turn, will increase household stability by providing a fixed\nasset of considerable value that can be used to safeguard household interests. To the extent\nthat housing loans are made to households with home- based workers (in most cases women),\nthe impact on poverty reduction will be significant.  Lending through worker cooperatives and\nsocieties under part B, such as the Sarvodaya Sangh network of handicraft workers, will have a\nsimilarly strong impact on reducing poverty. Low-income state and local employees, such as\nnurses  and  teachers  who  need  to  live  close  to  their  work,  will  benefit  from  savings  in\ntransportation costs and time spent commuting.  Improved water supply, sanitation, drainage,\nand  footpaths  under  the  slum  networking  component  will  improve  the  health,  safety,  and\nproductivity of slum residents. Individual direct lending will have positive impacts on poverty\nreduction to the extent that household living conditions, health, productivity, and access to\nemployment are improved.\nF. Risks\n97. One of the potential risks related to the ability of HUDCO, ICICI, and HDFC to increase\ntheir lending to CFIs is the absence of bankable collateral for loan security. The majority of CFIs\ndo not have substantial real collateral, nor do their members have registered titles to land.\nWhere individual or group land titles are not available, HUDCO has required an interest- bearing\ncash deposit from 10 to 15 percent of the loan, depending on the track record, loan recovery\nmechanisms, and experience of the CFI. These funds must come from the savings of their\nmembers, which is a burden on the CFI membership. In contrast to the present policy, the", "30\nProject is proposing that superior lending and repayment track records be taken as the principal\ncriteria for extending loans to established CFIs.  The Borrowers must therefore closely monitor\nthe financial positions as well as the absorptive capacities of partner CFIs.\n98. Regarding  slum  networking  schemes,  although  most  states  in  India  have  slum\nimprovement or slum clearance boards, they have a poor performance record in terms of\npromoting community participation and establishing partnerships with CFIs, NGOs, community\nresidents, local government authorities, and the private sector.  Additionally, their ability to use\nand leverage financial resources efficiently, and to promote cost recovery has largely been\nunsuccessful.  The Project\u2019s partnership slum networking approach is therefore a significant\ndeparture from the traditional approach to slum improvement. However, selected subprojects\nwill take more time to appraise, design, and implement. The success of this component will\ntherefore require a major commitment and educational effort on behalf of HUDCO.\n99. Each  of  the  Borrowers  must  cover  the  foreign  exchange  risk  associated  with  their\nrespective  loans.  To  avoid  a  negative  spread  on  their  loans,  the  Borrowers  will  have  to\nnegotiate beneficial agreements with swap partners. There is a risk associated with interest rate\nmovements  in  the  domestic  capital  markets  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  cost  of  ADB  funds.  However,  a\nmitigating  factor  is  the  relatively  long  maturity  of  the  ADB  funds  which  will  allow  all  the\nBorrowers to better balance the maturities of their assets and liabilities.\nVI. ASSURANCES\n100. The Government and the Borrowers have given the following specific assurances, in\naddition to the standard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\nA.  Specific Assurances\n(i)  The  Government  and  the  Borrowers  will  execute  the  policy  and  institutional\naction plan as agreed to by the Government, Borrowers, and ADB.\n(ii)  Each Borrower will ensure that it is in compliance at all times with the prudential\nnorms issued by the regulatory authorities, including capital adequacy, income\nrecognition, classification, and provisioning for nonperforming assets.\n(iii)  Each Borrower will maintain a debt-equity ratio no higher than 12 to 1 and a debt\nservice coverage ratio of at least 1.1, and confirm that it has no arrears in\nrepayment of its current debt obligations.\n(iv)  No withdrawals will be made from the loan account of a Borrower, until an\nopinion is received by ADB from an auditor acceptable to ADB, in form and\nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, that certifies that the Borrower is in compliance\nwith  prudential  norms,  debt  service  coverage  ratio,  and  debt-equity  ratio\nspecified in the assurances.\n(v)  Each  Borrower  will  select  subprojects  and  subborrowers  for  purposes  of\nonlending to state and local bodies under part A of the Project only in states and\nunion territories which have undertaken or are undertaking measures to put into\nplace  progressive  urban  land  ceiling  laws  and/or  amend  state  rent  control\nlegislation.", "31\n(vi)  Each Borrower will ensure that subloans are only made available to eligible\nsubborrowers, including those who are not in default, individually or collectively,\non any prior loan.\n(vii)  Each Borrower will submit to ADB, for prior approval, its first two subprojects\nunder each project component to be financed under the loan; and HUDCO will\nsubmit to ADB for prior approval all subprojects under part B of the Project.\n(viii)  Each Borrower will ensure that subprojects to be financed under the loan shall\nmeet  the  requirements  of  ADB's  guidelines  on  environmental  and  social\nassessment and management measures.\n(ix)  Each Borrower will ensure that subprojects involving involuntary resettlement are\neither  eliminated,  or  subloans  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB's\ninvoluntary  resettlement  policy  and  ADB's  Handbook on Resettlement,  as\namended from time to time.\n(x)  Each  Borrower  will  ensure  that  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  loan\nobserve  subloan  agreements,  criteria,  and  subloan  application  procedures\nacceptable to ADB, and no sublending is based on comfort letters unless such\ncriteria is approved by the Government and is acceptable to ADB.\n(xi)  Each Borrower will observe subloan financing criteria that include maximum ADB\nfinancing of 80 percent of the subloan(s) provided by the Borrower for lending\nand refinancing under part C, and for lending to public and private enterprises\nand to state and local bodies under part A of the Project; the remaining Project\ncomponents will be eligible for 100 percent ADB financing.\n(xii)  NHB will ensure that all refinancing under part C of the Project is directed to\nhousing finance companies approved by NHB for refinancing, with the exception\nof HUDCO, HDFC, and ICICI.\n(xiii)  NHB will ensure that 20 percent of the loan to NHB, equivalent to $8 million, is\ndirected to refinancing HFC lending to CFIs.\n(xiv)  Each Borrower will take all necessary measures satisfactory to ADB to ensure\nthat subloan repayments, net of ADB loan repayments, are relent through the\nsame lending channels and to the same beneficiary groups specified under the\nProject, during the loan period.\n(xv)  Each  Borrower  will  ensure  that  the  foreign  exchange  risk  under  the  Loan\nAgreement  is  hedged  through  an  appropriate  swap  or  other  hedging\narrangement in form and substance satisfactory to ADB.\nB.

Sources of Finance\n1. Low-income households have limited access to formal sources of market-based housing\nfinance.    Studies  in  the  1980s  showed  that  only  10  to  15  percent  of  housing  finance  in\ndeveloping countries came from formal institutions,  as such institutions cater mainly to middle-\nand high-income households. Although there is evidence suggesting that the availability of\nhousing finance from formal sources has increased, formal institutions in India are not likely to\naccount for much over 20 percent. Estimates of the share of various sources of finance in India\nfor the construction of new buildings or for financing additions to existing buildings are provided\nin tables A2.1 and A2.2.\n2. One striking feature of these data is that people largely depend on their own funds for\nfinancing new housing construction and home improvements. The dependence on own funds\nranges from about 65 to 70 percent in the case of new houses and from about 75 to 85 percent\nin  the  case  of  additions  to  existing  buildings.  Although  the  dependence  on  own  funds  is\ngenerally higher in  rural areas, this is not true in the case of kutcha (temporary) dwellings.\nThose building kutcha dwellings are the poorest segment of the population with low personal\nsavings and thus are more dependent on moneylenders. In the case of new kutcha buildings\nthe dependence on moneylenders is as high as 20 percent. According to these data, the share\nof formal sector finance varies from about 22 percent (for new buildings) in urban areas to less\nthan 8 percent (for additions and alterations) in rural areas. For the numbers presented in tables\nA2.1 and A2.2, it is assumed \"other sources of finance\" are from the \"formal\" sector.  To the\nextent that these are \"informal\" sources, the share of the formal sector is even lower.\nB. Formal and Informal Sources of Finance\n3. Of the estimated Rs1,500 billion required for housing during the Ninth Five-Year Plan,\nonly about Rs380 billion (about 25 percent) is expected to come from the formal sector. Sources\nof housing finance can broadly be classified into formal and informal. Informal sources comprise\nself-finance, including money from friends and relatives, moneylenders, suppliers' credit and\nrotating credit societies (chit funds/vishis).\n4. The  formal  housing  finance  sector  in  India  consists  of  specialized  housing  finance\ninstitutions  such  as  National  Housing  Bank  (NHB),  Housing  and  Urban  Development\nCorporation (HUDCO), housing finance companies (HFCs), and cooperative housing societies;\ngeneral financing institutions such as insurance companies, commercial banks, and provident\nfunds; and budgetary allocations of the central and state governments. Due to the earlier\nwelfare approach to housing and to financial  regulations, many of the providers and users of\nhousing finance were government and/or public sector agencies. Somewhere between these\ntwo categories are the microfinance or community-based finance institutions (CFIs).  For the\npurpose of this analysis we will classify these as informal sector institutions.\nC. The Informal Housing Finance Sector\n5.

It is clear from tables A2.1 and A2.2 that self-financing is currently the most significant\nsource of funds for housing. This imposes an obvious constraint on translating the potential\ndemand for housing. At the lower income levels, the amount of money, on  average, that people\nneed to acquire or improve a house, is relatively small and cannot be economically provided by\nlarge,  formal  HFCs.  Channeling  housing  finance  to  low-income  households  often  requires\ncommunity-based financial intermediaries that can afford to issue and service small loans.\n2. Suppliers' Credits\n7. Under this arrangement, the household constructs the house on credit, and is charged\ninterest rates, typically between 24 percent and 36 percent per year, by the supplier of building\nmaterials. The repayment period is very short, usually between 12 and 20 months. Physical\nassets such as gold and land are often used as collateral. With these high interest rates and\nshort repayment periods, the ability to meet monthly payments, even for very small loans, is\nlimited.\n3. Rotating Credit Societies  \n8. These go by various names in different parts of the country, such as chit funds or vishis,\nbut the principle is essentially the same. A group of people regularly subscribe to the scheme,\nand await their turn to access the accumulated pool. Clearly, the viability of such schemes\ndepends heavily on the mutual trust  among the members of the group. For that reason, these\ninstitutions tend to be exclusive and limited to groups of people who have a strong social affinity\nto each other. Their role in the  provision of housing finance is therefore limited.\n4. Community-Based Financial Institutions\n9. CFIs provide small loans with market-based interest rates to low-income households. As\ninstitutions, they combine the lending approach of the formal HFCs, but with the monitoring and\nenforcement mechanisms of communities. This allows them to keep default rates, and therefore\ntheir  interest  rates  relatively  low.  Some  of  the  larger  CFIs,  such  as  the  SEWA  Bank  of\nAhmedabad, are able to directly mobilize funds through their deposit schemes, as well as\nthrough equity capital. In general, CFIs have problems mobilizing funds. However, because of\ntheir potential strengths in the lending aspect of the business, CFIs can be an effective channel\nof funds from the formal sector to low-income borrowers.\n5. Interest Rates in the Informal Sector\n10. There is quite a variation across the CFIs as well as within a particular CFI with respect\nto different interest rate schemes. According to the project survey, interest rates were found to\nrange between 15 and 18 percent per annum, with some CFIs charging interest rates of 24\npercent or more; the most common among CFI lending were 15 percent, 18 percent, 24\npercent,  and  more  than  24  percent.  More  than  half  of  the  economically  weaker  section\nborrowers and 29 percent of low-income group borrowers had obtained loans at 15 percent.\nThe highest percentage of loans to middle-income group borrowers was made at rates greater\nthan 24 percent. The most common loan maturity periods were from 3-5 years. Despite the\nshort  maturity  and  high  interest  rates,  repayment  records  are  extremely  high.  The  lowest\nrepayment rate among mature CFIs was 96 percent.", "44\nAppendix 3\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE HOUSING SECTOR IN INDIA, 1983 \u2013 2000\n($ million)\nYear\nProject Approved Source Amount\nA.

Government Income Definitions\n1. For purposes of designating beneficiaries of housing and other Government assistance\nprograms, the Government classifies the population into four income categories: economically\nweaker sections (EWS); the low-income group (LIG); the middle-income group (MIG); and the\nhigh-income group (HIG).  In January 1999, the Planning Commission updated the income\nbrackets for the respective groups as follows: EWS households have monthly incomes of less\nthan Rs2,500 or $62; LIG households have monthly incomes between Rs2,500 and Rs5,700\n(about $142); MIG households have monthly incomes between Rs5,700 and Rs10,000 (about\n$250); and HIG households have monthly incomes of Rs10,000 and above.\nB.    Low-Income Households\n2.  For the purposes of the Project, low-income households are defined as households with\nmonthly incomes of Rs7,000 (about $165) or less. This definition is approximately equivalent to\nan income of $1/capita/day at current exchange rates for a family of five. The basis for this\ndefinition is the desire to identify a target beneficiary group under the Project that has little or no\naccess  to  housing  finance  through  formal  housing  finance  institutions.  In  relation  to  the\nGovernment\u2019s income classification categories, low-income households encompass the lower\none third of MIG households and below.\nC.  Income Distribution Data\n3.  To  estimate  where  the  various  income  groups  are  located  on  the  national  income\ndistribution scale, data from the National Council on Applied Economic Research (NCAER) was\nreviewed and analyzed.  NCAER carries out an annual survey of households, the Market\nInformation  Survey  of  Households.  The  sample  for  this  survey  consists  of  some  275,000\nhouseholds  distributed  across  the  country.  The  main  focus  of  the  survey  is  household\nexpenditure on several categories of consumer goods, durable and expendable. A portion of the\ndata used in this analysis is collected from each household on its gross income. Sample\nhouseholds are classified into five income categories based on 1995/96 prices, but for purposes\nof the Project, the income ranges were updated to 2000 prices using the consumer price index.\nThe categories  are not of equal size, and the HIG income class is open-ended.  Based on the\nsample distribution of households across income classes, the total number of households in\neach income category for urban areas has been estimated. This was also done for low-income\nhouseholds  as defined above.\nD.  Income Profiles of Households\n4.  According to the data, EWS families earning up to Rs2,500 per month comprise some\n6.3 million households, which are at or below the 12th percentile in 2000. LIG households are\nthe largest group, about 18.8 million households, the maximum income of which (Rs5,700 per\nmonth)  is  at  the  49th  percentile.  With  monthly  incomes  from  Rs5,700  to  Rs10,000,  MIG\nhouseholds number 15.2 million, with the maximum income (Rs10,000 per month) at the 78th\npercentile. At Rs7,000 per month, the maximum income of LIH households is at the 61st\npercentile.\n5.  Although it is estimated that some 60 percent of the urban population earn less than\nRs7,000 per month, this figure must considered with caution for several reasons. First, the data", "Appendix 5, page 2\n51\nis based on income that is always difficult to determine. Due largely to tax reasons, many\nfamilies, when surveyed, purposely understate their income. In the low-income brackets, where\ndisposable income is minimal or nonexistent, expenditure data is often a better measure of total\nincome. Secondly, a substantial portion of income of low-income households is often in kind\nrather than cash, and therefore goes undeclared. Thirdly, it is very difficult to update income\ndistribution data without adequate sample surveys each year. While the consumer price index\nwas used to update the data, another index such as a wage and salary index could have also\nbeen used. Given the lack of a recent household income and expenditure survey as well as the\nforegoing qualifications, the estimate of low-income households earning less than a dollar per\nday per capita could be as low as the 50th percentile.", "TOTAL PROJECT COST AND IMPACT\nTable A6.1: Total Project cost\nby Lending Channel and Leveraging Impact\nADB Loan Borrower Total Funds Beneficiary Project\nProject Part Amounta Contributionb for Lendingc Contributiond Cost\n A.

Borrower A draws down $20 million and places these finds on deposit with an\nIndian bank (with an offshore branch) for 20 years obtaining LIBOR plus 60 bp on its deposit.\nThus, the interest payments the Borrower pays to ADB, and that received on the deposit, match,\nand therefore there is no dollar interest rate cost or risk to the borrower.\n4.  Step 3. In consideration of this dollar deposit, the Indian bank (called the \u201cswap\u201d bank)\npurchases Borrower A\u2019s 20-year rupee bond in the amount equivalent to $20 million. The $/Re\nexchange rate is fixed at the time of deposit/rupee bond issue (i.e., at 42 to $1, the rupee\nequivalent is Rs840 million) and remains fixed throughout the 20-year period. Thus, neither\nparty to the transaction bears an exchange risk.\n5.  Step 4. The dollar deposit with the swap bank secures it\u2019s purchase of the rupee bonds,\nthus there is no credit risk from the Borrower. The Borrower is thus able to obtain attractive\nrates for it\u2019s various bond issuances. The interest rate on the rupee bonds is fixed, for example,\nfor 7 years at a determined spread over 7-year Government securities; this \u201cbench mark\u201d is\nreset every 7 years.\n6.  Step 5. The interest rate payment dates on the dollar deposit, the rupee bonds, and the\nADB loan are all matched. The Borrower pays ADB interest with the interest it receives from the\ndollar deposit. The Borrower pays the \u201cswap\u201d bank interest on it\u2019s rupee bonds out of it\u2019s cash\nflow (there is a rupee interest payment risk here to the swap bank but it could partially off set\nany noninterest payment by the Borrower, with the dollar interest payment. This could lead to, in\na worst case scenario, the Borrower defaulting on it\u2019s interest payment to ADB, which could\ninvolve ADB calling on it\u2019s guarantee from the Government of India).\n7.  Step 6. Principal payments on the ADB loan, the rupee bonds, and the maturity periods\non  the  dollar  deposit  (at  interest  adjustment  dates)  also  match.  Thus,  when  the  principal\npayment is due on the bonds, once the swap bank receives payment, it releases an equivalent\namount of dollars to the Borrower, who then pays ADB.\n8.  Step 7. The transaction is repeated with the swap bank, for each drawdown of the ADB\nloan by the Borrower. The \u201cswap\u201c bank could change, depending on negotiations between these\nparties regarding the rupee borrowing cost, but with any swap bank, the interest rate on the\ndollar deposit and the ADB loan would remain the same, as would the interest and principal\npayment dates continuing to match the dollar and rupee payments. New dollar deposit would\nsecure the new rupee bond issuance.\n9.  Step 8. This system allows the Borrower to obtain 20-year rupee funding, which is\ncurrently not available in the domestic market. It also allows the Borrower to obtain the most\nattractive rates at the existing market. It allows the swap bank to obtain long-term dollars that it", "56\nAppendix 8, page 2\nmay need to service it\u2019s clients and/or treasury needs, which would otherwise not be available\nand at attractive (ADB) rates. There is no $/Re exchange rate risk, minimal, if any dollar interest\nrate cost/risk, and no principal payment risk to any party involved in the transaction. Ultimately\nin any worst case scenario, the Government would have to pay ADB under it\u2019s guarantee and\nthus have exposure to the Borrower.\nFigure A8.1: Flow Chart of Representative Financing Structure\nADB\n(b) Guarantee for $100 million loan\nGOI\n(\nf\n)\n D n\na\nollar lo (a) Lo DB lo\na a A\nn rep n of $ nt of  ollars\na 1 ) e d\nym 00  (h ym in \nen  m      pa\nt to illio Re\n  n ) \nA h\nD (\nB\n(c) Dollar placement\n(d) Rupee equivalent of ADB loan\nSwap\nBorrower A Counter\n(e) Redemption of bonds/repayment of loan in rupees\nParty\n(g) Pay equivalent dollar deposit of (e)", "57\nAppendix 9, page 1\nSUMMARY OF SURVEY OF CFIs AND NGOs AND THEIR MEMBERS ON\nHOUSING FINANCE AND DELIVERY MECHANISMS\nA.    Introduction\n1. A major component of the Project will be to provide housing finance to low-income\nhouseholds through community finance institutions (CFIs) working in partnership with Housing\nand Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO). Although general information exists on the\nhousing finance needs of economically weaker section (EWS) and low-income group (LIG)\nhouseholds, there is only limited information about the characteristics and housing finance\nneeds of CFI members likely to participate in the Project. The current understanding of housing\nfinance needs and preferred loan conditions for low-income households in both urban and rural\nareas needs to be improved. A rapid coordinated set of consumer surveys was implemented\nduring the feasibility study to provide this information. A summary of the survey results and\nanalysis is presented here.\n1.    Survey Objectives\n2. The basic objectives of the surveys of CFIs, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and\nlow-income  households  were  (i)  to  assess  low-income  households'  socioeconomic\ncharacteristics, their housing needs, and their potential demand for housing finance in different\nareas of the country; (ii) to develop an understanding of low-income households capacity to\nabsorb housing finance; (iii) to identify existing sources and constraints related to housing\nfinance for low-income households; (iv) to explore different forms of collateral for low-income\nhousing loans; (v) to assess technical and capacity-building support required for loan-financed\nhousing improvements; and (vi) to assess the impact of improved housing on poverty reduction\nand the condition of women.\n2.    Brief Description of the Coordinated Surveys\n3. The coordinated set of consumer surveys included a sample household survey, case\nstudies, six consumer workshops, and three NGOs and CFI workshops in different parts of the\ncountry.\na.  Sample Household Survey\n4. A sample household survey was designed to obtain information about EWS, LIG, and\nmiddle-income group (MIG) households from the members of six major CFIs. These CFIs\nincluded DHAN Foundation, SHARE, SPMS, SIDA, Indcare Trust, and Shramik Bharti. The\nselection of households to be surveyed was based on a purposive sampling approach to\nexpedite survey implementation and to ensure that adequate data were obtained about the\ndifferent household types. The planned (and actual) distribution of the 500 (512) surveyed\nhouseholds were as follows:\n  By Income By Location By Previous Access to Housing Loans\n  EWS - 200  (192) Urban - 250  (280) Borrowers - 100  (106)\n  LIG - 200  (238) Rural - 250  (232) Nonborrowers - 400  (406)\n  MIG - 100   (82)", "Appendix 9, page 2\n58\n5. The selected distribution of survey households has produced a very good cross-section\nof potential project beneficiaries. Survey households included rural and urban self-help group\n(SHG)  members  and  borrowers,  slum  dwellers,  and  home  workers,  all  with  an  ample\nrepresentation of women. The survey questionnaire focused on obtaining relevant information\non  the  housing  need,  demand,  and  absorptive  capacity  of  these  households.  The  DHAN\nFoundation was responsible for overall coordination and implementation of this survey.\nb.    Household Case Studies\n6. Fifty household case studies were undertaken as the second part of the set of surveys.\nThe purpose of the case studies was to deepen current understanding about the characteristics\nand housing situation of low-income households, their potential demand for housing finance,\nand the conditions under which the provision of housing finance would be most effective. The\npurposive case study sample included 18 EWS households, 24 LIG, and 8 MIG. A professional\nteam from DHAN Foundation coordinated the implementation of these surveys with help from\neach of the participating CFIs.\nc.     Consumer Workshops\n7. One-day consumer workshops were held in Kanpur, Delhi, Kottayam, Tirupati, Madurai,\nand Hyderabad at the end of the survey fieldwork. Participants at these workshops were urban\nand rural households from the three income categories of EWS, LIG, and MIG. They included\nborrowers and potential borrowers of housing finance within each income group. Financial\nrepresentatives from local housing finance institutions (HFIs) attended two of the workshops.\nWorkshop discussions focused on the relevance of microfinance to housing finance, preferred\nhousing products, consumer experience with current lending terms and conditions, issues of\ncollateral  and  security,  importance  of  housing  as  a  workplace,  forecasting  of  demand  for\nhousing  finance,  establishing  the  need  for  technical  and  material  support,  and  identifying\nimprovements to loan processing.\nd.     NGO and CFI Consultation Workshops\n8. Three one-day consultation workshops were held with NGOs and CFIs in Calcutta,\nChennai, and Mumbai. A total of 90 NGO and CFIs attended the three workshops. The purpose\nof the workshops was to determine potential demand for housing finance through CFIs and the\namount of bulk lending required through the HUDCO lending window, and to discuss measures\nto increase the flexibility and effectiveness of this type of lending.\nB. Key Findings from the Sample Household Survey\n9. Results from the sample household survey include (i) data on the socioeconomic profiles\nand characteristics of the client population; (ii) an assessment of the housing need, demand,\nand absorptive capacity of potential client households as expressed through their willingness\nand ability to make investments, use credit, and improve their housing situation; and (iii) an\nassessment of the impact of improved housing conditions on the reduction of poverty and\nsituation of women.\n1.    Socioeconomic Profiles and Characteristics of the Client Population\n10. Survey activities focused on CFI members who will make up the majority of low-income\nhouseholds borrowers under the Project. The survey sample included households from the", "59\nAppendix 9, page 3\nthree income groups of EWS, LIG, and MIG; households from urban and rural areas; existing\nborrowers and potential borrowers of housing finance; households working at home; private and\npublic sector workers; etc. The broad geographic base of the survey has provided a good\noverall profile of potential project beneficiaries.\na.    Average Household Size\n11. The average household size for the entire sample was 4.5. Basically similar results were\nobtained for all income and geographic categories except LIG households in rural areas. The\naverage household size for this group was substantially higher at 5.9. At the same time, MIG\nhouseholds  in  rural  areas  had  the  lowest  average  household  size  of  4.0.  One  possible\nexplanation  for  this  situation  is  that  the  larger  household  size  enables  some  rural  EWS\nhouseholds to become LIG due to additional family workers. The larger household size among\nrural LIG also had an impact on the average size of borrower households (5.2) in this group.\nb.     Age of the Head of Household\n12. Survey results showed that there was little difference between the average age of\nhousehold  heads  of  borrower  and  potential  borrower  households.  Roughly  a  third  of  the\nhousehold heads in both categories were less than 36 years old. Another 36 percent of the\nhousehold heads for borrowers and 40 percent for potential borrowers were between 36 and 40\nyears of age, the most common age group. Roughly 11 percent of the household heads in both\ngroups were more than 50 years old.\nc.     Primary Occupations\n13. The most common primary occupations for surveyed household heads in rural areas\nwere self-employed (at 33 percent) and construction/casual labor (at 28 percent). These same\ntwo categories were important for EWS households in urban areas (at 28 percent and 20\npercent, respectively) along with private sector salaried workers (at 26 percent); self-employed\nhouseholds included all types of shop owners (petty shops, teashops etc), vendors (fruits,\nvegetables, flowers etc.) and other occupations such as tailoring, woodworking etc. Private\nsector salaried workers included those working in private establishments that ranged from\ngrocery stores to large private enterprises. Service providers like barbers, dhobis, etc. were also\nincluded in this group.  Most MIG households in both rural and urban areas were self-employed\n(41 percent in rural and 30 percent in urban areas) or salaried (28 percent with the private\nsector in rural areas and 23 percent in urban areas). An additional 28 percent of the MIG\nhouseholds in urban areas were working for the Government.  As a result, some 51 percent of\nMIG households were salaried and had relatively stable employment. Only 23 percent of the\nEWS households and 19 percent of LIG households in rural areas were involved in any form of\nagriculture (either as laborers or farmers of their own land).\nd.    Number of Workers per Household\n14. Roughly 64 percent of the surveyed households had two or more working members,\nincluding 41 percent with two and 23 percent with three or more. Almost 70 percent of the\nborrower households had two or more working members with roughly 30 percent having three\nor more. The percentage of households with two or more workers was highest for LIG in urban\nareas (87 percent) followed by LIG in rural areas (83 percent). LIG households in these areas\nalso had the highest percentage of households with three or more workers. The fact that EWS\nborrowers in urban areas had one of the highest percentages of households with only one\nworker (55 percent) was a surprise.", "60\nAppendix 9, page 4\ne.     Monthly Household Incomes\n15. The average monthly income of all surveyed households was around Rs3,400. While\nthere was little difference in income between EWS borrowers and potential borrowers in rural\nareas, EWS borrowers in urban areas appeared to have slightly higher incomes than potential\nborrowers in the same income group. EWS and LIG borrowers also appeared to have incomes\nthat were almost 5 percent higher than the overall sample for the same income groups. Survey\nresults showed that some 84 percent of EWS borrower households had monthly incomes\nbetween Rs1,500 and Rs2,500, while 52 percent of LIG households had incomes between\nRs2,500  and  Rs4,500.  Some  88  percent  of  lower  MIG  households  had  incomes  between\nRs5,501 and Rs6,000.\nf.   Monthly Household Expenditures\n16. The average monthly expenditure for all surveyed households were close to Rs2,500. As\nexpected, significant differences were found in monthly expenditures for households living in\nurban and rural areas. Cheaper access to food in rural areas and more expensive transportation\ncosts in urban areas were undoubtedly two of the major reasons for these differences.\n17. Roughly 80 percent of EWS households in rural areas and 54 percent of those in urban\nareas had monthly expenditures less than Rs1,500. The remaining EWS in both geographical\nareas had monthly expenditures less than Rs2,500. The difference in monthly expenditures for\nLIG households was more pronounced with a much higher percentage of LIG households in\nrural areas at the lower end of the scale (i.e., 82 percent with less than Rs2,500 expenditures\nper month compared with only 34 percent for urban LIG). Again, while 65 percent of the LIG\nhouseholds in urban areas had monthly expenditures between Rs2,500 and Rs4,500, this\noccurred for only 16 percent of the LIG households in rural areas. A more even situation was\nfound for MIG households, with 21 percent in rural areas having expenditures greater than\nRs4,500 compared with 36 percent in urban areas.\n18. While only very limited household income and expenditure data were obtained from the\nsurvey, the results indicate a rather consistent pattern that provides useful insights into the\nfinancing of housing for low-income households. Households across all three income groups\nappear capable of dedicating an important amount of their monthly savings to the repayment of\na housing loan, especially if it follows previous loans for the improvement of income.\n2.  Housing Need, Demand, and Absorptive Capacity of Potential Client\nHouseholds\n19. The conversion of housing need into demand and the subsequent engagement of a\nhousing loan depend on a number of conditions that include the household\u2019s socioeconomic\nsituation, its security of tenure and period of residence, existing housing conditions, previous\nborrowing experience, and potential loan conditions and terms.\na. Security of Tenure\n20. The overall percentage of homeownership within the survey sample was roughly 87\npercent. Little difference occurred in the degree of homeownership among the three income\ngroups. A somewhat higher percentage of homeownership occurred among EWS households in\nrural  compared  with  those  in  urban  areas.  There  was  also  a  higher  percentage  of\nhomeownership among borrowers than among nonborrowers.", "61\nAppendix 9, page 5\n21. Some 92 percent of all borrower households owned their house with slightly higher\npercentages occurring for rural and EWS households. The percentage of home ownership for\nnonborrower households was 85 percent.  The most notable difference occurred in urban areas\nwhere only 81 percent of potential borrower households owned their houses compared with 91\npercent of the borrowers.  The fact that 9 percent of urban borrowers were renters may be due\nto the fact that they were still in the process of completing their house.  Roughly 30 percent of\nthe  borrowers  that  owned  their  housing  units  did  not  have  documents  legitimizing  their\noccupation of the land.  Another 24 percent were assigned patta, 31 percent had bought their\nplots, and the remaining 15 percent occupied their plot by right of inheritance. There were no\nEWS borrowers in rural areas without proper land documentation. Almost 50 percent of the\nEWS borrowers in urban areas, however, were without such documentation.\n22. Conditions were considerably different for potential borrower households.  There was a\nmuch lower percentage of households living on their land without documents (14 percent for\nnonborrowers compared with 30 percent for borrowers) and a much higher percentage of\nhouseholds that had inherited their land (30 percent for nonborrowers compared with 15 percent\nfor  borrowers).  The  difference  was  most  evident  in  urban  areas  where  14  percent  of  the\nborrowers owned their land through inheritance as opposed to 32 percent of the nonborrowers.\nOther than this \u201cflip\u201d between inherited and land occupied without documents, the remaining\npercentages for plot tenure was very similar for borrowers and nonborrowers.\nb. Period of Residency\n23. Results from the survey show that the amount of time that a household has lived in its\nhouse is not a major factor in the decision to borrow for housing. Some 38 percent of the\nborrowers in the overall sample had lived in their houses for less than 10 years compared with\n44 percent for potential borrowers. At the same time, 48 percent of the borrowers had lived in\nthe their houses for more than 15 years compared with 41 percent for nonborrowers. In terms of\nincome groups, a higher percentage of EWS and MIG households in rural areas had lived in\ntheir houses for more than 20 years than LIG households. The situation in urban areas was\nreversed. More than half the LIG households had been living in their houses for more than 20\nyears. The situation for potential borrowers was the same, with a greater percentage of EWS\nand MIG households living in their houses for more than 20 years than LIG.\nc. Housing Conditions\n24. Close to three quarters of the survey households lived in houses with tile or reinforced\nconcrete roofs. This included a slightly higher percentage in rural areas compared with urban\nareas due perhaps to a greater sense of land tenure and security. At the same time, over 80\npercent of the borrowers lived in housing with tile (semipucca) or reinforced concrete (pucca)\nroofs in basically equal proportions. Only about 20 percent were living in houses with thatched\n(kutcha) roofs.\n25. Significant differences occurred in the type of houses occupied by potential borrowers.\nSome 45 percent of the EWS category lived in houses with thatched roofs, while 43 percent\nlived in houses with tile roofs. Roughly 25 percent of LIG households and 8 percent of MIG also\nlived in houses with thatched roofs. The average house size for the overall sample was 360\nsquare feet (or an average of 80 square feet per person). Houses in rural areas were roughly 20\npercent larger than those located in urban areas. There was little difference in house size\nbetween borrowers and nonborrowers within the different income and geographical categories.\nThe biggest difference occurred between houses inhabited by the LIG and MIG categories.", "62\nAppendix 9, page 6\n26. Slightly more than half of the surveyed households had in-house toilet facilities. The\noverall percentages for water supply and electricity were 45 and 74 percent respectively. There\nwas little difference in the provision of these services between urban and rural areas.  Given the\nimportance of electricity and other basic services to the well-being of the household, housing\nconstruction and needed service improvements should be included in the same loan.\nd. Borrowing Experience\n27. Borrowers became interested in obtaining housing loans for a number of reasons.  The\nmost common reasons were (i) an increase in household size, (ii) improved financial position of\nthe household, and (iii) intrafamily disputes. The overwhelming majority of surveyed households\nhad taken microfinance loans from informal sources.  Most of these loans were used to meet\nconsumption and social function needs. While EWS loans from money lenders were distributed\nover consumption, family function, medical, emergency, income generation, and other uses,\nmore than half of these loans were used for medical reasons and family functions. Moneylender\nloans to LIG households were used mainly for consumption and family functions.\n28. Results from the survey showed that borrowers of housing finance generally had taken\nmore microfinance loans from a variety of sources than potential borrowers. In particular, EWS\nand LIG borrower households had clearly been more active borrowers for nonhousing purposes\nthan  their  nonborrowing  counterparts.  EWS  housing  borrowers  had  taken  0.62  loans  per\nhousehold  from  moneylenders  compared  with  0.39  loans  per  household  for  those  EWS\nhouseholds that had not borrowed for housing. Similarly, the ratio of loans through SHGs for\nEWS borrowers was 1.43 loans per household compared with only 0.96 for potential borrowers.\nSHG loans for LIG households were 1.17 for borrowers and 0.91 for potential borrowers. For all\nloans combined, the ratio for EWS borrowers was 2.19 loans per household compared with 1.51\nloans per potential borrowers. For LIG households the ratios were 1.83 for borrowers and 1.42\nfor potential borrowers. Surprisingly, MIG households were the least active borrowers with only\n0.67 loans per household for those that had borrowed for housing and 0.86 loans for those that\nhad not.\n29. Although little information can be derived from the survey concerning the percentage of\nhouseholds  interested  in  borrowing  for  housing  due  to  its  purposive  sample,  the  sources,\nfrequencies  and  uses  of  housing  loans  can  be  examined.  Close  to  78  percent  of  those\nborrowing for housing had borrowed only from the CFI. Another 8 percent had borrowed from\nmoneylenders, with roughly half these households in the EWS group and the other in LIG.\ne. Loan Conditions\n30. The  survey  questionnaire  indicated  four  uses  of  the  housing  loans.    They  include\n(i) small-scale improvement and upgrading; (ii) additions or expansion; (iii) new construction or\nrebuilding of an existing house; and the purchase of an existing house. While surveyed EWS\nhouseholds  in  urban  areas  used  their  housing  loans  more  or  less  equally  for\nimprovement/upgrading, housing unit expansion, and new construction, the clear majority of\nother urban and rural borrowers did so for new construction. Overall, 57 percent of all borrowers\nused their housing loans for new or major construction. In rural areas, 75 percent of EWS\nborrowers, 78 percent of LIG, and 86 percent of MIG used their loans for this purpose.  In urban\nareas, the respective percentages were 59 percent, 65 percent, and 64 percent. Roughly 19\npercent used their loans for improvement and upgrading, while another 15 percent undertook\nhousing additions and expansion. Only 2 of the 106 borrowers in the survey used their loan to\npurchase an existing house.", "63\nAppendix 9, page 7\n31. Some 87 percent of all EWS borrowers obtained their loans from their CFI with only one\nhousehold obtaining a loan from a bank. The remaining borrowers had obtained loans from\nmoneylenders.  While all of the LIG borrowers had obtained loans through CFIs, LIG borrowers\nin urban areas used a wider range of sources. Of these borrowers, 65 percent had obtained a\nloan from CFIs; 17 percent from moneylenders; and the remaining households from housing\nboards, banks, and other sources. Close to 71 percent of MIG borrowers in rural areas had\nobtained loans from housing boards or the government. In urban areas, 55 percent of MIG\nborrowers had obtained a housing loan from CFIs, 18 percent from housing boards, 9 percent\nfrom banks, and the remaining 18 percent from other sources.  For MIG borrowers the overall\npercentages were 44 percent from CFIs, 22 percent from housing boards, 6 percent from banks,\n17 percent from the Government, and 11 percent from other sources. Altogether, only three of\nthe borrowers surveyed, all of whom lived in urban areas, had obtained a housing loan from a\nbank.\n32. The sizes of loans borrowed by households in all income categories ranged from less\nthan  Rs10,000  to  more  than  Rs100,000.  Approximately  37  percent  of  the  LIG  borrowers\nobtained a loan for less than Rs10,000, while close to 21 percent of the EWS borrowers\nobtained a loan for more than Rs50,000.  Altogether, 49 percent of EWS, 52 percent of LIG, and\n28 percent of MIG borrowed for less than Rs15,000. Four interest rates were predominant: 15\npercent (39 percent of the loans), 18 percent (11 percent), 24 percent (15 percent), and greater\nthan 24 percent (19 percent). More than half the EWS borrowers and 29 percent of the LIG had\nobtained loans with annual interest rates of 15 percent.\n33. While it might be expected that EWS borrowers would have lower monthly payments,\nthe percentages of borrowers paying less than Rs250 per month actually increased with an\nincrease in income. Survey results indicate that 30 percent of EWS, 37 percent of LIG, and 39\npercent of MIG borrowers paid less than Rs250 per month.  Similarly, 28 percent of EWS\nborrowers, 39 percent of LIG, and 28 percent of MIG were making monthly payments between\nRs250 and Rs500. Surprisingly, some 28 percent of EWS households were making monthly\npayments greater than Rs1,000, which was virtually the same percentage as that for MIG\nborrowers. All of the EWS and LIG borrowers were making either weekly or monthly payments.\nSlightly more than half made payments on a weekly basis.  Some 80 percent of the MIG\nborrowers were also making weekly or monthly payments. Payments by other MIG borrowers\nwere either annual or based on other methods of payment.\nf. Collateral\n34. In terms of the collateral, 55 percent of all borrowers provided a form of traditional\ncollateral for their housing loan. Of those 34 percent provided a land deed, 4 percent provided a\npossession certificate, and 7 percent provided another form of guarantee. Consequently land\nownership documents were the most common form of collateral even for informal finance. The\npercentages of borrowers able to provide collateral were virtually the same for all income\ncategories. The ability to provide acceptable collateral as well as the form of collateral provided\nappeared to have little relationship to the category of income.\n35. Slightly more than half of the borrowers (52 percent) felt that group pressure was also an\neffective form of collateral. Group pressure was strongest for EWS borrowers, 60 percent of\nwhich felt that such pressure was adequate to ensure the repayment of loans. Slightly less than\nhalf the borrowers felt that pressure from the CFI was strong enough to guarantee repayment,\nwith  EWS  borrowers  once  again  the  highest  percentage  at  53  percent.  The  majority  of\nrespondents felt that only one form of collateral should be required and that it should not be\nlarge cash deposit.", "Appendix 9, page 8\n64\ng. Loan Approval\n36. In terms of loan approval, 38 percent of EWS borrowers were able to have their loan\napproved in less than a month and 91 percent in less than four months.  For disbursal, the\npercentages were 45 percent for less than a month and 96 percent for less than four months.\nPercentages for all the other income groups were similar. Only 30 percent of all borrowers\nclaimed to have experienced any problems in the approval or disbursal of their loan.  Most of\nthese problems were not major.\nh. Borrowers\u2019 Own Contribution\n37. Cash was the most frequent contribution made by borrowers to the construction of their\nhouse. Roughly 76 percent of the borrowers contributed their own cash to supplement their\nhousing loan. The percentage of households putting in cash ranged from 70 percent for EWS to\n78 for LIG, and 89 for MIG. Of those EWS households, 45 percent contributed less than\nRs10,000. The situation was much different for the two other income categories. Some 34\npercent of LIG households and 75 percent of MIG households contributing cash put in more\nthan Rs40,000. Roughly 41 percent of the borrowing households contributed their own labor to\nthe construction of the house.  The contribution of labor according to income group showed 43\npercent for EWS, 51 percent for LIG, and 11 percent for MIG.  In almost every case, the value of\nself-help labor was considered to be less than Rs10, 000.\n38. While the recycling of building materials can be an important cost-cutting approach, only\nabout 15 percent of the borrowers made any contribution in kind to the construction of their\nhouse.  Only about 27 percent of the borrowing households obtained building materials from the\nCFI,  with  the  percentage  for  different  income  groups  ranging  from  25  percent  for  EWS\nhouseholds to 33 percent for MIG. Similarly, about 22 percent of the borrowers sold some of\ntheir assets to finance the cost of construction. The percentage was slightly higher in rural (29\npercent) that in urban areas (18 percent).\ni. Supplemental Loans\n39. Roughly half the borrowers engaged an additional loan to finance the construction of\ntheir house. Additional loans were most common when the primary loan was less than Rs\n20,000.  Roughly 61 percent of the borrowers of this size of loan obtained an additional loan, the\nmajority of which ranged between Rs5,000 and Rs35,000. About a quarter of the households\nobtaining a loan for Rs5,000 or less obtained another loan for Rs5,000 or less as well. Only\nabout  26  percent  of  the  borrowers  were  interested  in  obtaining  a  maintenance  loan  once\nconstruction of their house was completed.\n3. Impact of Improved Housing Conditions on the Reduction of Poverty and\nSituation of Women\n40. CFI housing loans are intimately linked to the reduction of poverty through support to\nprovide home work-places and working conditions for women, and the empowerment of women\nthrough  the  self-help  group  (SHG)  approach  to  decision  making  and  use  of  household\nresources.\na. Home-Work Places\n41. Slightly more than 31 percent of all households in the survey used their home as a place\nof work.  This includes more than half the MIG borrowers in both urban and rural areas.  Many", "65\nAppendix 9, page 9\nof these households may have been able to use their home workplace to raise their category of\nincome.  Among borrowers, EWS households had the lowest percentage of households using\ntheir house as a workplace at 17 percent. Many EWS households have very poor quality houses\nthat would require substantial improvement to serve as a place for income-generating activities.\nFurther the survey revealed that close to 30 percent of rural borrowers of housing loans were\nusing at least part of their house as a place of work. Some 80 percent of these rural home-\nworkplaces were used for the rearing of domestic livestock.  In urban areas, close to 36 percent\nof the borrowers were using their houses as workplaces for urban functions such as tailoring,\npetty shops, wood carving, etc.\n42. Some 60 percent of these home-workplaces involved the use of a room, 16 percent\ninvolved the use of open space near the house, and another 14 percent involved the use of the\nkitchen.  The use of housing as a workplace is particularly important for women borrowers, 60\npercent of whom are home-based workers. Some of the work-related activities that typically take\nplace in the home include mat weaving, broom making, tailoring, embroidery, small-scale food\nprocessing, petty commerce, temporary storage of goods, etc.\n43. The most common home-based work in the survey involved small-scale shops, tailoring,\nand the holding of animals, which combined made up roughly 70 percent of the total. Results\nfrom the survey showed that improvement to housing and home workplaces generated an\nincrease  in  household  income  between  Rs200  and  Rs1,000  per  month  with  the  average\nincrease about Rs500. Almost 60 percent of the home-based workers in the survey were\nwomen.\nb. Impact on Women Workers\n44. Some 48 percent of the survey households had at least one woman member working for\ncash. The LIG category had the highest percentage with 58 percent. The overall percentages\nfor  EWS  and  MIG  households  were  35  and  46  percent  respectively.  For  borrowers,  the\npercentage  of  households  with  women  workers  was  58  percent  with  81  percent  of  these\nhouseholds having only one working woman. The presence of a working woman household\nmember  varied  considerably  between  rural  and  urban  areas.  The  percentage  of  borrower\nhouseholds in rural areas with a woman worker was roughly 76 percent, while that for urban\nareas was only 43 percent. LIG borrower households in both urban and rural areas had a\nslightly higher percentage of working women than EWS and MIG.\n45. Results from the survey seem to indicate that rural households with at least one working\nwoman are more likely to borrow for housing than those without. This is true for all three income\ngroups.  While  the  percentages  of  households  with  working  women  in  urban  areas  are\nsomewhat higher for EWS and LIG borrowers that difference is not substantial.\n4.  Technical Capacity and Support Provided and Needed\n46. Roughly 34 percent of the borrowers obtained technical and/or management support for\nthe construction of their house. The percentage was slightly higher for LIG households (41\npercent) and slightly lower for MIG households (22 percent).  The percentage for EWS was\nclose to the overall average at 32 percent. The importance of technical support was clearly\ndemonstrated during the field work with SPMS.  Houses that were built with the help of the\nSPMS  engineer  were  clearly  better  built  and  less  costly  than  those  built  without  such\nassistance.", "66\nAppendix 9, page 10\n47. Technical support can help low-income household borrowers in the design, budgeting,\nand cost control of construction. It insures sound construction at reasonable and predictable\ncost.  Low-income household borrowers of housing finance recognize the value of this service\nand are basically willing to pay between Rs200 to Rs600 per house, or about 1 percent of their\nloan amount, for this service. It would be in the interest of all parties if CFIs were equipped with\na housing cell to provide this support. Survey results also indicated a preference for the bulk\nsupply of materials from the CFIs (or NGOs); this would save time and reduce the costs of\nmaterials and their transport.\nC. Results from the Housing Case Studies\n48. A series of case studies were implemented to deepen the understanding of EWS, LIG,\nand MIG needs for housing finance. The basic objective of the case studies was to more clearly\nunderstand the qualitative factors affecting the choice of housing products to be financed, the\ngraduation  of  households  from  housing  need  to  housing  finance,  the  provision  of  support\nservices and the impact of housing finance. The basic socioeconomic characteristics of case\nstudy households were very similar to those of households in the sample survey.\n49. The  most  important  result  from  the  case  studies  was  that  they  provided  additional\ninformation on the types of housing finance available to low-income households and their\npreferences. The main sources of housing finance are all informal. The SHGs/federations have\nbeen the most widely used sources of housing finance in the southern and Delhi regions. SHG\nmembers  usually  approach  their  group  or  the  parent  CFI  for  their  housing  loans.  Those\nemployed in permanent jobs also can take loans from their employers. Chit funds are another\nwidely used source of housing finance in the south. Table A9 illustrates the different loan\nconditions that case study households obtained from informal sources in borrowing for housing.\nTable A9: Loan Conditions of Different Housing Finance Providers\nInterest Repayment Repayment\nSecurity/Collateral\nProduct Rate (%) Period (years) Schedule\nHousing Society 12 15 Monthly Land deed\nWeekly to Land deed, group\nNGOs 12 - 18 3 - 5\nmonthly security\nMonthly to Land deed (agri and\nMoney Lender 36 - 60 2 - 3\nquarterly others)\nRelatives None\nPawn Broker 60 - 120 2 \u2013 3 Flexible Jewelry, utensils\n   NGO= non-government organization.\n50. Household preferences for the types of housing finance and lenders were influenced by\n(i) formalities and procedures involved in obtaining the loan; (ii) loan terms and conditions\nincluding the rate of interest, repayment period, and collateral requirements; (iii) time required to\nprocess the loan; and  (iv) rigidity in repayment schedules and terms.\n51. The  average  amount  of  housing  finance  required  to  expand  a  housing  unit  was\nestimated to be Rs20,000 while the average cost of new construction was estimated to be", "67\nAppendix 9, page 11\nRs50,000. SHGs and CFIs were the preferred source of housing finance for their members.\nCase study respondents felt that housing finance terms should include a rate of interest of 12 to\n18 percent with monthly payments over a period of 3 to 5 years.\nD. Results and Observations from the Consumer Workshops\n52. Consumer workshops were held at the end of the sample survey and case study work in\neach of the six survey areas. The intention of these workshops was to expand the issues and\nideas raised during survey work through open discussion. A significant part of the workshop was\ndedicated to identifying acceptable requirements for accessing a housing loan, the types of loan\nproducts desired and their estimated costs, and acceptable conditions of a housing loan from a\nCFI.\n53. Generally agreed upon SHG and member requirements to obtain a housing loan from\nCFIs were: (i) for the SHG, at least 2 to 3 years of microfinance operation and a repayment\nperformance of 90 to 100 percent; and (ii) for the member, 2 to 3 years membership in the SHG,\nsavings accumulation of Rs3,000, successful use and repayment of 2 to 3 loans for income\ngeneration, repayment record of at least 95 percent for past loans, expressed housing demand,\nlow cash outflow to service existing debt and adequate repayment capacity.\n54. The type and estimated costs of desired housing products included: (i) the purchase of a\nplot for Rs5,000 to Rs10,000 for EWS households; (ii) purchase or construction of a new house\nfor Rs45,000 for EWS, Rs70,000 for LIG and Rs100,000 for MIG; (iii) repairs, improvements,\nand additions for Rs25,000; redemption of a house site and house for Rs20,000: workplace\nimprovements for Rs5,000 to Rs20,000; and construction of toilets, electricity, water facilities,\netc. for Rs5,000.\nE. Results of the NGO/CFI Consultation Workshops\n55. A major objective of the NGO/CFI consultation workshops was to determine an idea of\nthe potential demand for housing loans through CFIs. The 30 participants at the consultation\nworkshop in Calcutta expressed a potential demand for bulk lending from HUDCO of roughly $5\nmillion. The 45 participants at the consultation workshop in Chennai expressed a much greater\nneed  for  roughly  $40  million.  Some  of  the  fast-track  CFIs,  which  were  not  included  as\nparticipants in the consultations (including SIDA, SHARE, SEWA and DHAN Foundation), have\nexpressed a similar need for around $50 million. Clearly not all of the CFIs in the consultations\nhave the capacity to handle large loans. Nevertheless, a concerted effort was made to develop\nreasonable estimates of what would be required once the new HUDCO lending window is in\nplace.", "68\nAppendix 10\nAFFORDABILITY ANALYSIS\n1.
