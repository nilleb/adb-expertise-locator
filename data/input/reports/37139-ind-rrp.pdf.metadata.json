A  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nprepared and circulated to the Board on 20 May 2005. \n \nPower  and  energy  are  essential \nfor  economic  and  social \ndevelopment  in  Uttaranchal.  The  government  of  Uttaranchal \n(GOU)  has a  long-term roadmap  to  strengthen  the  power  sector. \nBesides  capital  investments  to  increase  power  generation  and \nimprove transmission and distribution, the roadmap also includes \ninstitutional  change  and  capacity  building  for  policy  reform  and \nimproved financial management. Private sector participation in all \nparts  of  the  power  sector  is  an  objective,  as  well  as  tariff  regime \nimprovements  and  the  establishment  of  sound  regulatory,  legal, \nand  governance  frameworks.  The  roadmap  is  centered  on  clean \nenergy  development  and  energy  efficiency,  which  are  fast \nbecoming  priority  themes  in  India,  with  particular  relevance  to \nstates  with  the  resources  and  physical  conditions  to  broaden  the \ngeneration  base.  A  key  feature  of  the  roadmap  is  that  it  blends, \nphases,  and  sequences  a  diverse  range  of  investment  and \nnoninvestment interventions over time. The overall objective is to \nraise  output  and  efficiency  while  ensuring  fully  inclusive  power \nindustrial, \nservices \ncommercial, and public administrations.  \n \nThe  capital  investment  program  (the  program)  itself  will  require \nabout  $12  billion  over  2006\u20132018.  This  includes  new  assets  and \nthe  rehabilitation  of  existing  assets  in  generation,  transmission, \nand  distribution.  Given  the  relatively  large  size  of  the  program, \nand  in  view  of  the  state\u2019s  limited  financial  resources  and \ninstitutional  capabilities,  the  investments  will  be  phased  and \ndistributed  among  public  and  private  sponsors.  Planned  capital \ninvestments from 2006\u20132012 are estimated at about $5 billion.  \n \ninvolves  central  and  state  government \nThe \nauthorities  (through  budget  allocations),  local  banks,  private \nsponsors, national utility companies, capital market operators, and \ninternational financial institutions including the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). International loan syndications and bond issues are \npossible, the latter of which may be enhanced through guarantee \nproducts  available  from  multilateral  financing  institutions  and  the \n\ntypes  of  consumers:  residential, \n\nfinancing  plan \n\nfor  all \n\n \n\n\fii \n\nis  required \n\nfor  new  generating  capacity \n\nthat.  Approximately  $4  billion \n\ninsurance  market.  These  enhancements  can \ninternational \nincrease  maturities  and  bring  down  the  total  cost  of  funds  to  the \nissuer.  \n \nThe  roadmap  and  the  program  (investment  and  noninvestment) \nare fully consistent with the government of India (GOI) \u201cPower For \nAll  by  2012\u201d  policy  objective,  and  fits  well  with  ADB\u2019s  existing \nstrategy for the sector.  \n \nGeneration \n \nAt  year-end  2005,  Uttaranchal  had  generating  capacity  of  1,160 \nmegawatts (MW), entirely from hydropower plants. Total theoretical \npotential is estimated at 20,000 MW. Capacity expansions planned \nthrough  to  2018  total  about  10,000  MW.  There  are  14  projects \nunder  construction,  totaling  5,525  MW  in  new  capacity  by  2010. \nAn  additional  4,791  MW  are  in  the  development  stage,  with \ncommissioning due soon after 2010, and an additional 9,090 MW \nin  new \nis  planned  beyond \ninvestment \nto  be \ncommissioned by 2012, most of which will be provided by central \npublic  sector  utilities  (CSPUs),  Uttaranchal  Jal  Vidyut  Nigam, \nLimited  (UJVNL),  the  state  generating  utility,  and  private  sector \ndevelopers. \n \nThe generation expansion program is dominated by clean energy \ndevelopment in the form of low-carbon generation operations, and \nenergy  efficiency  improvements  in  the  form  of  renovation  and \nsystem  loss  reduction.  While  most  of  the  new  hydropower \ncapacity  during  the  first  phase  will  come  from  large  (more  than \n100 MW) and medium (25\u2013100 MW) plants, the program includes \nsmall  run  of  river  hydropower  plants  (3\u201325  MW).  Numerous \ncandidate sites have been identified, with a cumulative capacity of \naround  1,000  MW,  about  10%  of  which  is  now  operating. \nIndependent power producers are expected to develop about half \nof  the  small  hydropower  plants  (SHPPs).    SHPPs  provide  power \ndirectly  to  local  grids  (at  33  kilovolts  [kV]),  and  therefore  are \nintegral  to  meeting  rural  electrification  objectives.  SHPPs  can  be \nconstructed much faster than medium- and larger-sized ones, are \nenvironmentally  friendly,  and  are  expected  to  generate  tradable \ncarbon  credits,  with  substantial  financial  upside  to  the  project \nsponsors. ADB is providing assistance to GOU to develop carbon \ncredit opportunities. \n \nTransmission \n \nThe  state-level  transmission  network  needs  to  be  expanded \nquickly  to  accommodate  a  four  fold  increase  in  generation  and \nenergy  transfers  by  2012.  Transmission  expansion  is  integrated \nwith  generation  expansion  activities,  and  calls  for  785  kilometers \n(km)  of  400  kV  lines,  180  km  of  220  kV  lines, 665  km  of  132  kV \n\n\flines, 8 substations, and auxiliary equipment. Power Transmission \nCorporation  of  Uttaranchal,  Limited  (PTCUL)  is  the  lead  project \nsponsor,  and  will  require  around  $550  million  to  support  these \ninvestments. \n \nDistribution \n\nThe  sector  roadmap  targets  100%  village  electrification  by  2008 \nand  100%  household  electrification  by  2012,  which  requires \nextending  the  33  kV  and  11  kV  distribution  networks.  The  state \ndistribution  company,  Uttaranchal  Power  Corporation  Limited \n(UPCL),  is  implementing  a  comprehensive  system  overhaul \nincluding  energy  audits,  physical  upgrades,  expansion  of  service \nareas,  and  improvements  in  metering,  billing,  and  collection.  \nUPCL\u2019s  business  plan  calls  for  about  $370  million  in  new \ninvestment  through  2012,  which  is  being  met  through  central \nGovernment  incentive  programs,  state  budget  transfers,  and \nrevenue  collection  from  ongoing  operations.  The  company  is \nmoving \nfurther \nrestructuring  covering  operational,  financial,  and  management \nmatters  is  being  considered  by  GOU,  the  Uttaranchal  Energy \nDepartment  (UED),  and  UPCL  management.  External  financing \nmay  be  required  after  the  expiration  of  funds  available  under  the \nAccelerated Power Development and Reform Program. \n \nPolicy Framework and Capacity  \n\nfully  commercial  operations,  and \n\ntoward \n\n \n\n \n\nUttaranchal\u2019s power sector was unbundled beginning in 2001, and \noperations  have  been  rapidly  evolving  from  a  system  run  by \nregulated monopolies to one incorporating several private groups \nand  more  competitive  market  conditions.  A  number  of  reforms \nhave  been  implemented,  and  others  will  be  phased  in  between \nnow  and  2012.  The  Uttaranchal  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission  (UERC)  actively  monitors  and  promotes  reforms  to \nsustain  commercial  operations.  Generation  is  the  most  open  of \nthe three subsectors, with central public sector utilities and private \ncompanies  developing  several  major  projects.  The  transmission \nsector has some current limitations to private sector involvement, \nbut the policy framework caters for public and/or private initiatives, \nincluding \njoint  ventures  and  wholly  owned  private  sector \noperations,  some  of  which  may  come  on  stream  in  the  short  to \nmedium  term.  As  noted  above,  the  distribution  subsector  is \nundergoing a system-wide overhaul.  Further restructuring will be \nimplemented  subject \nto  careful  planning  and  extensive \nthe  meantime,  some  design, \nstakeholder  consultations. \nconstruction,  and  maintenance  operations  will  be  outsourced  to \nthe private sector.  \n \nCapacity  to  implement  the  sector  roadmap  remains  a  constraint. \nAt  the  central  government  level  the  capacity  to  formulate  and \nexecute  policy  reforms  is  sound,  and  to  a  large  extent  already \n\nIn \n\niii \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \nMultitranche Financing \nFacility \n\n \nRationale \n\nis \n\nin \n\nincluded \n\nresource \n\ntraining.  Policy \n\ntested, since this is done mainly by the Ministry of Power and the \nCentral Electricity Authority.  \n \nAt the state level, GOU, UED, UERC, and the utilities have strong \nplanning capability. Financial management and fiduciary oversight \nsystems  are  in  place,  but  can  benefit  from  additional  assistance \nand \nformulation,  project  definition,  project \nmanagement, and project monitoring will be strengthened over the \nnear  term,  and  ADB  intervention  includes  support  for  capacity \nbuilding in these areas.  The utilities have the capacity to plan and \nissue tenders for civil works contracts, the purchase of plant and \nequipment,  and  the  issuance  of  concessions,  joint  ventures,  and \nmanagement  contracts.  ADB  is  providing  ongoing  technical \nassistance  to  improve  capacity  to  comply  with  all  relevant  ADB \npolicies and procedures, including governance, procurement, and \nsafeguards. Additional support for these activities, including long-\nthe  proposed  ADB \nterm  human \nintervention.  \n \nProposed ADB Intervention \n \nThe Government of India (GOI) and GOU have requested ADB to \nprovide  $300  million  to  partly  fund  a  subset  of  the  investment \nprogram covering generation, transmission, and capacity building. \nThis represents a relatively small share of the total funding needs \nand  financing  plan.  Having  ADB  as  a  partner  (i)  brings  down  the \ntotal  cost  of  funds,  (ii)  sets  out  standards  in  various  thematic \nareas,  and  (iii)  helps  to  entice  other  long-term  financiers  to  the \nsector. GOI and GOU have requested ADB to extend this finance \nin the form of a multitranche financing facility (MFF).  \n \nUp to $300 million to help fund the investment program during its \nfirst  phase.  The  Multitranche  Financing  Facility  (MFF)  will  be \nconverted  into  individual  loans  in  line  with  individual  project \nreadiness,  as  well  as  policy,  safeguards,  financial  management, \nfiduciary  oversight,  and  capacity  building  action  plans.  These \nloans  will  be  made  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources.  The \nutilization period of the facility will be 7 years.  \n \nUttaranchal  is  one  of  India\u2019s  poorest  states.  Clean  energy  and \ntourism are two important economic growth and poverty reduction \ndrivers.  The  state  has  undeveloped  hydropower  potential \nestimated at 20,000 MW. Harnessing this hydropower capacity is \nvital to meet all in-state demand and export power to surrounding \nstates,  and  support  investment  in  rural  and  other  productive \nsectors. \n\n\fImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\n \n\nin \n\nis  based  on  (i)  a \nUttaranchal\u2019s  power  sector  road  map \nmemorandum  of  understanding  with  the  Government  of  India  for \nunbundling the former State Electricity Board; (ii) the subsequent \nunbundling into three state-owned utilities; (iii) the implementation \nof  the  Accelerated  Power  Development  and  Reform  Program, \nwhich  supports  local  grid  strengthening  and  reduction  of  system \nlosses;  (iv)  a  tripartite  agreement  between  the  state,  the  central \nGovernment, and the Reserve Bank of India for settling accounts \nbetween  the  former  State  Electricity  Board  and  its  unbundled \nsuccessors;  (v)  the  state\u2019s  new  industrial  policy  for  economic \ngrowth  through  the  development  of  clean  (no-  and  low-pollution) \nfor  private  sector \nincludes  provisions \nenterprises,  which \nthe  creation  of  an \nthe  power  sector;  (vi) \nparticipation \nindependent electricity regulator; (vii) the Accelerated Generation \nand Supply Program, which provides incentives for the renovation, \nmodernization, and upgrade (RMU) of existing power plants; and \n(viii)  a  series  of  tariff  orders  for  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution that support the commercialization of the state-owned \nutilities. \n \nThe  program  will  support  poverty  reduction  in  Uttaranchal.  It \nsupports  investments  and  enabling  conditions  conducive  to \neconomic  growth  and  prosperity.  Power  remains  a  bottleneck  to \neconomic  growth,  affecting  resident  and  industrial  consumers \nalike. The program will generate exports to neighboring states and \nimprove  efficiency  and  cut  energy  leaks,  operating  and  financial \nlosses in the system.  \n \nThe  program  will  encourage  reform,  promote  clean  energy  and \nenergy  efficiency  improvements,  and  build  capacity  to  effectively \nmanage  the  ongoing  multi-billion  dollar  expansion  program. \nCapacity  building  activities  will \ninitially  concentrate  on \nimplementation  of  investments  funded  by  ADB,  and  will  be \nexpanded  to  support  the  broader  sector  reform  agenda  under \nGOU leadership.  \n \nThe ADB-supported investments will increase power supplies by a \nsignificant amount by 2012, from large and small plants, by adding \nnew  assets,  and  rehabilitating  existing  ones.  Transmission \nexpansion will enable a more efficient transfer of power within the \nstate, and the sale of excess power to the Northern Region grid. \nBy  2012,  the  exportable  surplus  will  be  sufficient  to  supply  12 \nmillion  residential  customers.  Expanded  and  improved  quality  in \nthe  service  will  cut  costs,  reduce  the  \u201ccost  plus\u201d  pressure  on  the \ntariff  structure  and  benefit  consumers.  The  SHPPs  investments \nare expected to generate carbon credits, with significant financial \nupside  to  sponsors  and  consumers.  ADB  is  providing  ongoing \nassistance  to  expand  expertise  in  Uttaranchal  for  carbon  credit \nidentification and trading.  \n \n\nv \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\nCost Estimates and \nFinancing Plan  \n\n \nFacility Amount and \nTerms \n\nRetroactive Financing \n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \n\n                            $ Million  \n\nInvestment Program 2006\u20132012     \nGeneration   \n    UJVNL Large Hydropower \n    UJVNL Small Hydropower \n    Central Public Sector Utility and/or Independent Power  \n    Companies \nTransmission \nDistribution \nTotal \nFinancing Plan \nDomestic \n  UJVNL \n  PTCUL \n  UPCL \n  GOU \n  Central Power Sector Utilities \n  Private Sector \n  Power Finance Corporation  \n  Local Banks, Private Equity, and Capital Markets \n International \n   ADB \n  Bilaterals  \n  International Financial Institutions \nTotal \n\n \n\n \n700 \n335 \n\n3,200 \n550 \n370 \n5,155 \n\n440 \n100 \n40 \n580 \n1,600 \n750 \n300 \n245 \n \n300 \n300 \n500 \n5,155 \n\nfinal \n\n \n \nThe  facility  will  provide  up  to  $300  million,  secured  from  the \nOrdinary  Capital  Resources  of  ADB,  with \nterms  and \nconditions  to  be  established  under  individual  loan  agreements \nbased  on  prevailing  ADB  policies.

Additional  tasks  which  may  be \ncovered  are  assistance  with  planning  and  policy  formulation; \ncarbon  credit  identification,  certification  and  marketing;  corporate \ndevelopment, including human resource development, information \ntechnology  upgrades,  and  creation  of  a  state-level  power  trading \ncompany.   \n \nThe  program  covers  investment  and  noninvestment  interventions \nbenefiting  all  consumers  in  rural  and  urban  areas,  including \nresidential,  industrial,  public  administrations,  and  commercial \nestablishments.  It  will  deliver  on  both  quantitative  and  qualitative \ntargets  envisaged  under  the  Power  For  All  by  2012  policy \nobjective.  Besides  generating  more  power  supplies  for  users  in \nthe  state  itself  (now  in  deficit),  the  program  will  also  provide \nsubstantial  surplus  power  for  exports,  which  is  expected  to  be  a \nmajor source of revenue for the state.  \n \nThe  program  is  founded  on  clean  energy  development,  a  field \nwhere  Uttaranchal  has  a  clear  comparative  advantage  vis-\u00e0-vis \nother states. Expanding clean energy capacity will generate local, \nregional,  and  global  environmental  benefits.  Local  air  quality, \nparticularly  indoor  air  quality,  will  improve  with  the  substitution  of \nelectricity  for  biomass  (animal  dung  and  wood)  and  kerosene. \nRegional  air  quality  will be  preserved  by  offsetting  the  expansion \nof thermal generating capacity. Carbon credit trading is expected \nto create significant dividends, with projected upside up to 15% of \ntotal  capital  outlays.  Energy  efficiency  will  be  improved  with \nsubstantial  reductions  in  transmission  and  distribution  system \nlosses.

The \ntax \n\ninvestments \ninvestment  program  will  obviously  create  employment, \nrevenues, and royalties to the state.  \n \nThe  program  is  accompanied  by  some  risks,  in  particular  cost \noverruns, commissioning delays, and lack of reforms necessary for \nsector sustainability.  \n \nGiven  the  \u201ccost  plus\u201d  commercial  or  tariff  regime  prevalent  in  the \nindustry in India today, cost overruns can be partially passed on to \nconsumers, with negative financial and economic effects, especially \non  residential  customers.    This  risk  is  small.  The  cost  projections \nare  based  on  conservative  assumptions,  and  many  of  these \ninvestments fall within the jurisdiction of the central power utilities\u2014\nexperienced groups in terms of project preparation and execution.  \nImplementation  is  being  conducted  more  and  more  frequently  on \nthe  basis  of  tendered  engineering,  procurement  and  construction \nturnkey  contracts  (EPCs),  which  are  subject  to  considerable \npenalties  on  budget  and  time  overruns,  and  come  with  project \ncompletion and commissioning guarantees.  \n \nCommissioning  delays  would  put  at  risk  not  only  in-state  supplies \nbut  also  exports  to  neighboring  areas.  Such  risk  is  contained  and \nmanaged through the \u201cconcession\u201d contracts awarded to the short-\nlisted sponsors. About 14 projects are already under way and most \nof  the  remaining  ones  are  at  an  advanced  stage  of  development \nand/or planning.  \n \nCapacity building and public policy reform are essential to the long-\nterm  growth  and  sustainability  of  the  sector.  The  risk  of  a \nturnaround  (or  a  material  slowdown)  in  the  reform  process  is \npossible  but  unlikely.  GOI  and  GOU  are  publicly  committed  to  the \nreform process, because reliable high quality power service is a key \ndriver  for  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  sector  is  also  crucial \nfor  other \nturn  creates \nemployment, better public goods and services and incomes.

The  provision  of \nADB finance through a multitranche facility requires an agreement \non  key  warranties  and  representations  which  are  intended  to \nensure program success.

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  India  for  the  Uttaranchal  Power  Sector  Investment \nProgram (Investment Program).1 \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nThe Government of India has confirmed its intent to provide universal power service at \nan affordable price by 2012, which will require an estimated 100,000 megawatts (MW) of new \ncapacity.  The  Government  also  intends  to  shift  the  ratio  of  thermal  to  hydropower  generation \nfrom  the  current  75:25  to  60:40.  Hydropower2  is  targeted  for  30%  of  new  generating  capacity \nduring the next two 5-year plans, of which 10,000 MW is proposed for development in the state \nof Uttaranchal between 2005 and 2018. Power sector analysis is presented in Appendix 2.  \n \n3. \nThe 2003 Electricity Act is intended to improve governance in the power sector through \ncontinued institutional restructuring and improved management of sector entities to ensure long-\nterm  sustainability.  Compulsory  metering,  open  access  to  transmission  systems,  facilitation  of \npower trading, lifeline tariffs for the poor and rural consumers, and rationalization of tariffs have \nbeen  initiated.  Generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  have  been  separated.  The  Central \nElectricity  Regulatory  Commission  has  prescribed  detailed  rules  for  cost  accounting  and \nallowable  tariffs.  Wholesale  electricity  sales  are  priced  at  the  cost  of  transmission  and \nproduction,  including  an  allowed  rate  of  return  on  equity  investment  of  14%.  The  costs  of \nhydropower generation are estimated to be as low as $0.013 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) averaged \nover  a  plant\u2019s  lifetime,  with  initial  costs  ranging  from  $0.04  to  $0.05  per  kWh.  In  Uttaranchal, \nconsumer tariffs range from $0.03 per kWh to $0.078 per kWh, and in 2003, the average retail \ntariff across all consumer categories was $0.047 per kWh. \n \nUttaranchal was created on 9 November 2000 by splitting the state of Uttar Pradesh.3 Per \n4. \ncapita electricity utilization in the state is below the national average (about 284 kWh per capita \nper  year  compared  with  the  national  average  of  606  kWh  per  capita  per  year),  and  economic \ndevelopment  has  been  constrained  by  the  lack  of  an  available  and  affordable  power  supply.  In \n2003, statewide demand exceeded in-state supply by 10.2%. In 2004, this gap between demand \nand supply decreased to less than 5%. Electricity utilization has increased by 10 to 16% per year \nsince 2000 and is expected to continue increasing at comparable rates through 2012. The state \nhas little or no fossil fuel resources, and has therefore focused on developing hydropower and the \nassociated  transmission  system  for  meeting  local  demand  within  the  state  and  for  exports  of \nsurplus power.  \n \n5. \nThe  former  State  Electricity  Board  (SEB)  has  been  transformed  into  three  state-owned \nutility companies: Uttaranchal Power Corporation, Limited (UPCL) is responsible for distribution \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  India  is  heavily  dependent  on  fossil  fuel  imports  (coal,  crude  oil,  and  natural  gas).  Hydropower  has  a  distinct \n\ncomparative advantage for the provision of electric power.  \n\n3  Uttaranchal  was  created  as  a  separate  state  to  accelerate  economic  development,  which  depends  on  two  key \n\nresources: tourism and hydropower.   \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nat 33 kilovolts (kV) and lower, rural electrification, and power trading;4 the Power Transmission \nCorporation  of  Uttaranchal,  Limited  (PTCUL)  is  responsible  for  high-voltage  transmission  lines \nand  substations  from  132  kV  to  400  kV;5  and  Uttaranchal  Jal  Vidyut  Nigam  Limited  (UJVNL) \ntakes  a  lead  role  in  developing  hydropower  projects  greater  than  1  MW  and  manages  private \nsector  participation.6  Private  sector  participation  is  open  for  more  than  40  hydropower  plants \n(HPPs)  of  less  than  25  MW  capacity  and  13  projects  ranging  from  25  MW  to  100  MW.  The \nUttaranchal Electric Regulatory Commission (UERC) was established as the independent state \nregulator in 2002.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n6. \nEnergy services, especially reliable electric power, are essential for economic and social \ndevelopment  in  Uttaranchal.  The  government  of  Uttaranchal  (GOU)  has  developed  a \ncomprehensive roadmap to strengthen the sector over the long run. Besides capital investments \nto increase power generation and improve transmission and distribution, the roadmap includes \ninstitutional change and capacity building for policy reform and improved financial performance. \nPrivate sector participation in all parts of the power sector is an objective, as well as tariff regime \nimprovements  and  the  establishment  of  sound  regulatory,  legal,  and  governance  frameworks. \nThe  roadmap  emphasizes  clean  energy  development  in  the  form  of  low-carbon  power \ngeneration, and energy efficiency via renovation, modernization, and upgrade (RMU) of existing \npower  plants,  which  are  critical  pieces  of  a  sustainable  energy  strategy.  A  key  feature  of  the \nroadmap  is  that  it  blends,  phases,  and  sequences  a  diverse  range  of  investment  and \nnoninvestment  interventions  over  time.  The  overall  objective  is  to  raise  output  and  efficiency \nwhile  ensuring  fully  inclusive  power  services  for  all  types  of  consumers:  residential,  industrial, \ncommercial,  and  public  administration.  Planned  capital  investments  from  2006\u20132012  are \nestimated  at  about  $5  billion.  The  Government  has  requested  external  financial  and  technical \nassistance (TA) for implementing critical parts of this investment program. \n \n\n1. \n\nGeneration \n\n \n7. \nThe Northern Region grid has a power deficit that will persist for several years, but that \ncan  be  cost-effectively  ameliorated  by  developing  hydropower  in  the  mountainous  states  of \nJammu  and  Kashmir,  Himachal  Pradesh,  and  Uttaranchal  (Appendix  2).  Uttaranchal  has  the \ngreatest  undeveloped  hydropower  capacity  in  the  Northern  Region  grid,  with  20,000  MW \nestimated to be commercially viable, but only 1,160 MW operating at year-end 2005. The GOU \nroad  map comprises an  Investment  Program  centered  on  hydropower  generation,7  upgrade  of \nexisting transmission system, new high-voltage transmission lines and substations, distribution \nsystem  upgrades  and  expansion,  including  rural  electrification,  and  capacity  building  for \nimproved sector efficiency.8  \n \nThe state is currently a  net importer of electric  power,  but  generates  a seasonal surplus \n8. \nand plans to become a net exporter of power by 2010 by expanding hydropower and high-voltage \n                                                 \n4   Power generation units are also allowed to engage in power trading according to provisions in the 2003 Electricity \nAct.  Uttaranchal  policy  currently  allows  power  trading  to  be  managed  by  UPCL,  with  the  intention  of  creating  a \npower trading company in the near future.  \n\n5   The Power Grid Corporation India, Limited will operate 765 kV lines.  \n6  The Uttaranchal Renewable Energy Development Agency takes a lead role for projects of less than 1 MW. It also \nmanages renewable energy projects, including off-grid development, with some support from bilateral donors and \nnon-government organizations. \n\n7  The HPPs associated with the proposed transmission lines to be funded by ADB are all run-of-river designs.  \n8   UPCL  and  the  Uttaranchal  Renewable  Energy  Development  Agency  are  responsible  for  grid-connected  and  off-\n\ngrid rural electrification, respectively. \n\n\ftransmission capacity. Currently 14 projects totaling 5,525 MW are under construction9 and will \nbe commissioned between now and 2010. An additional 4,791 MW are under development, with \nexpected commissioning dates after 2010, and another 9,090 MW are planned (see Maps 1 and \n2, and Appendix 2). The key developers are UJVNL, the state generating utility; central public \nsector  utilities,  including  the  National  Thermal  Power  Corporation,  the  National  Hydropower \nDevelopment  Corporation,  and \nthe  Tehri  Hydropower  Development  Corporation;  and \nindependent power producers (IPPs).10 The existing HPPs were constructed in the 1970s and \n1980s  in  association  with  irrigation  systems  and  require  major  overhauls.  A  program  for \nrenovation,  modernization,  and  upgrade  (RMU)  of  existing  HPPs  has  been  defined  with  an \nestimated cost of about $150.0 million.  \n \n9. \nThe  generation  expansion  program  is  dominated  by  clean  energy  development  in  the \nform  of  low-carbon  generation  operations,  and  energy  efficiency  improvements  in  the  form  of \nrenovation  and  system  loss  reduction.  While  most  of  the  new  hydropower  capacity  during  the \nfirst  phase  will  come  from  large  (more  than  100  MW)  and  medium  (25\u2013100  MW)  plants,  the \nprogram  includes  small  run  of  river  hydropower  plants  (3\u201325  MW).  Numerous  candidate  sites \nhave  been  identified,  with  a  cumulative  capacity  of  around  1,000  MW,  about  10%  of  which  is \nnow  operating.  Independent  power  producers  are  expected  to  develop  about  half  of  the  small \nhydropower plants (SHPPs). SHPPs provide power directly to local grids (at 33 kilovolts [kV]), \nand therefore are integral to meeting rural electrification objectives. SHPPs can be constructed \nmuch  faster  than  medium-  and  larger-sized  ones,  are  environmentally  friendly,  and  are \nexpected  to  generate  tradable  carbon  credits,  with  substantial  financial  upside  to  the  project \nsponsors. ADB is providing assistance to GOU to develop carbon credit opportunities. \n \n \n \n10. \nThe state-level transmission network needs to be expanded quickly to accommodate a \nfour  fold  increase  in  generation  and  energy  transfers  by  2012.  Transmission  expansion  is \nintegrated  with  generation  expansion  activities,  and  calls  for  785  kilometers  (km)  of  400  kV \nlines, 180 km of 220 kV lines, 665 km of 132 kV lines, 8 substations, and auxiliary equipment. \nPower  Transmission  Corporation  of  Uttaranchal,  Limited  (PTCUL)  is  the  lead  project  sponsor, \nand will require around $550 million to support these investments. \n \n \n\nTransmission \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nDistribution \n \n\n11. \nThe  sector  roadmap  targets  100%  village  electrification  by  2008  and  100%  household \nelectrification by 2012, which requires extending the 33 kV and 11 kV distribution networks. The \nstate  distribution  company,  Uttaranchal  Power  Corporation  Limited  (UPCL),  is  implementing  a \ncomprehensive  system  overhaul  including  energy  audits,  physical  upgrades,  expansion  of \nservice areas, and improvements in metering, billing, and collection. UPCL\u2019s business plan calls \nfor  about  $370  million  in  new  investment  through  2012,  which  is  being  met  through  central \nGovernment  incentive  programs,  state  budget  transfers,  and  revenue  collection  from  ongoing \noperations. External financing may be required after the expiration of funds available under the \nAccelerated  Power  Development  and  Reform  Program.  The  company  is  moving  toward  fully \ncommercial operations (see Appendix 2), and further restructuring is being considered by GOU, \nthe Uttaranchal Energy Department (UED), and UPCL management.  \n                                                 \n9  This figure includes the Tehri and Koteshwar projects, totaling 2,400 MW, which will transmit power directly to the \n     Northern Region grid in Uttar Pradesh. These HPPs are not connected physically to and are not included in the \n     proposed Project. \n10  Central public sector utilities and IPPs are required to give 12% of their generation output to the state as a royalty \n     for the use of the rivers. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nPolicy Framework and Capacity  \n\n \n\n \n\n12. \nUttaranchal\u2019s power sector was unbundled beginning in 2001, and operations have been \nrapidly evolving from a system run by regulated monopolies to one incorporating several private \ngroups and more competitive market conditions. A number of reforms have been implemented, \nand  others  will  be  phased  in  between  now  and  2012.  The  Uttaranchal  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission (UERC) actively monitors and promotes reforms to sustain commercial operations. \nGeneration  is  the  most  open  of  the  three  subsectors,  with  central  public  sector  utilities  and \nprivate companies developing several major projects. The transmission sector has some current \nlimitations  to  private  sector  involvement,  but  the  policy  framework  caters  for  public  and/or \nprivate initiatives, including joint ventures and wholly owned private sector operations, some of \nwhich  may  come  on  stream  in  the  short  to  medium  term.  As  noted  above,  the  distribution \nsubsector  is  undergoing  a  system-wide  overhaul.    Further  restructuring  will  be  implemented \nsubject  to  careful  planning  and  extensive  stakeholder  consultations.  In  the  meantime,  some \ndesign, construction, and maintenance operations will be outsourced to the private sector.  \n \nCapacity  to  implement  the  sector  roadmap  remains  a  constraint.  At  the  central \n13. \ngovernment level the capacity to formulate and execute policy reforms is sound, and to a large \nextent already tested, since this is done mainly by the Ministry of Power (MOP) and the Central \nElectricity Authority (CEA).  \n \n14. \nAt  the  state  level,  GOU,  UED,  UERC,  and  the  utilities  have  strong  planning  capability. \nPolicy  formulation,  project  definition,  project  management,  and  project  monitoring  will  be \nstrengthened over the near term, and ADB intervention includes support for capacity building in \nthese areas. The utilities have the capacity to plan and issue tenders for civil works contracts, \nthe  purchase  of  plant  and  equipment,  and  the  issuance  of  concessions,  joint  ventures,  and \nmanagement  contracts.  ADB  is  providing  ongoing  technical  assistance  to  improve  capacity  to \ncomply with all relevant ADB policies and procedures.  \n\n5. \n\nThe Asian Development Bank\u2019s Strategy in the Power Sector \n\n15. \nThe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) assistance for the energy sector as outlined in \nthe 2004 and 2005 country strategy and program updates11 has six main priorities: (i) reforming \nthe  power  sector;  (ii)  promoting  higher  efficiency  and  low-carbon  power  sources,  for  example, \nrun-of-river  hydropower  projects  and  renewable  energy;  (iii)  expanding  and  optimizing \ntransmission  and  distribution  systems;  (iv)  strengthening  institutions  to  implement  reforms \nrequired by the 2003 Electricity Act, including the development of more flexible power delivery \nand  trading  systems;  (v)  promoting  private  sector  participation;  and  (vi)  encouraging  energy \nconservation  and  ensuring  environmental  and  social  sustainability.  To  support \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s goal of Power For All by 2012, ADB\u2019s future strategy for the power sector will be \nin  synergy  with  the  10th  and  11th  Development  Plans.  ADB  will  continue  to  expand  its \npromotion  of  state-level  power  sector  reforms  by  including  more  states,  such  as  West  Bengal \nand  the  northeastern  states,  and  by  deepening  its  efforts  in  the  states  in  which  it  is  currently \nactive, such as Assam, Kerala, and Madhya Pradesh. The proposed intervention in Uttaranchal \nis  consistent  with  the  strategy  of  supporting  state-level  sector  reforms,  in  this  case  with  the \nemphasis on the generation and transmission subsectors that complement ongoing reforms in \nthe distribution subsector. ADB intervention will promote knowledge transfer in relation to best \npractices  in  the  international  power  sector,  improve  corporate  governance  in  state-owned \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n\n\futilities, and ensure that appropriate environmental and social safeguards are incorporated into \nnew power sector investments. \n \n\n6. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n16. \nIn the past, ADB extended assistance to discrete power projects in various states as well \nas to the central public sector utilities. This strategy enabled ADB to support many projects, but \nspread ADB\u2019s resources too thinly, with the result that desired policy reforms were not achieved. \nSince  2000,  ADB  has  focused  on  states  committed  to  reforming  and  restructuring  the  power \nsector  to  achieve  holistic  change  in  macroeconomic  management.  With  the  implementation  of \nthe  2003  Electricity  Act,  ADB\u2019s  focus  has  shifted  toward  strengthening  system  expansion  and \npromoting commercial operations with sector and investment loan support. At the national level, \nprojects supporting the development of interstate transmission systems have been fundamental \nto ADB\u2019s overall energy sector program. ADB\u2019s intervention in the transmission subsector has \nimproved commercialization and overall operating efficiencies.  \n \nThe  evaluation  of  two  projects12  provides  additional  key  findings,  namely:  (i)  ADB\u2019s \n17. \nenergy policy to promote cleaner energy sources and reduce reliance on coal-fired generating \ncapacity  is  reconfirmed  given  overall  environmental  and  cost  implications,  (ii)  tariffs  can  be \nraised  without  reducing  net  project  benefits  to  the  poor,13  (iii)  sector  restructuring  should  be \nimplemented gradually rather than in the form of \u201cshock therapy,\u201d and (iv) turnkey contracts are \npreferable to multiple supply and construction contracts in relation to enhancing the efficiency of \nproject implementation. \n \nThese  lessons  have  been  incorporated  into  the  proposed  investment  design.  The \n18. \ninvestments  specifically  target  clean  energy  development.  Tariff  reforms  have  been  initiated, \nand further tariff changes will be based on commercial principles. Further sector restructuring is \nbased  on \nindependent  regulatory \ninstitutional  arrangements  (new  utilities, \ncommission). Procurement packages have been formulated to optimize implementation. \n \n\nthe  current \n\n7. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n \nA major portion of external assistance to India\u2019s power sector has come from ADB, the \n19. \nCanadian International Development Agency, the Department for International Development of \nthe  United  Kingdom, \nf\u00fcr \nWiederaufbau  of  the  Government  of  Germany,  the  US  Agency  for  International  Development \n(Appendix  3),  and  World  Bank.  Uttaranchal  has  received  power  sector  assistance  from  the \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  for  the  280  MW  Dauliganga  hydropower  project \n(through \nthe  Canadian \nInternational  Development  Agency  and  the  Canadian  Commercial  Corporation  for  RMU  at  the \n144 MW Chilla HPP.  \n\nthe  National  Hydropower  Development  Corporation)  and \n\nInternational  Cooperation,  Kreditanstalt \n\nthe  Japan  Bank \n\nfrom \n\nfor \n\n \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB. 1986.

Manila.  \n\n13 Poor consumers in rural areas often rely on expensive diesel generator sets and other forms of energy that are \n    costlier than grid-supplied electricity. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n8. \n\nPolicy Context and Dialogue \n\na.  \n\nUttaranchal Power Development Policy, Strategy, and Reforms \n\n \nGOU is committed to sector reforms in conformity with the 2003 Electricity Act and the \n20. \nnational electricity policy of February 2005. The latter is intended to promote implementation of \nthe Electricity Act, calling for power for all by 2012 (including rural electrification), reduced T&D \nand aggregate technical and commercial losses, better cost recovery and targeting of subsidies, \ngreater  private  sector  participation,  full  development  of  hydropower,  use  of  information \ntechnology for greater operational efficiencies, and protection of consumers\u2019 interests (Appendix \n2). \n \nUttaranchal  has  adopted  these  policy  objectives  through  (i)  a  memorandum  of \n21. \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  of  India  for  unbundling  the  former  SEB;  (ii)  the \nimplementation  of  the  Accelerated  Power  Development  and  Reform  Program,  which  supports \nlocal grid strengthening and reduction of system losses; (iii) a tripartite agreement between the \nstate, the central Government, and the Reserve Bank of India for settling accounts between the \nSEB  and  its  unbundled  successors;  (iv)  the  Uttaranchal  new  industrial  policy  for  economic \ngrowth  through  the  development  of  clean  (no-  and  low-pollution)  enterprises,  which  includes \nprovisions for private sector participation in the power sector; (v) the creation of an independent \nelectricity  regulator;  (vi)  the  Accelerated  Generation  and  Supply  Program,  which  provides \nincentives  for  RMU  of  existing  power  plants;  and  (vii)  a  series  of  tariff  orders  for  generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution  that  support  the  commercialization  of  state-owned  utilities.  The \nstate is implementing the nationwide scheme for accelerating rural and village electrification, the \nRajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana,14 which provides supplemental financing to states \nto meet the Power For All By 2012 objective.  \n \n22. \nthe \ncommercialization  of  the  power  sector  in  an  economically  efficient  manner.  The  state  is \ndeveloping  hydropower  on  a  least-cost  basis  to  provide  improved  electric  service  to  all \nconsumers  at  fair  prices  and  develop  an  exportable  surplus  to  support  economic  growth. \nRestructuring,  including  the  separation  of  Uttaranchal\u2019s  grid  operations  from  those  of  Uttar \nPradesh,  has  improved  operational  and  service  efficiency  (Appendix  2).  Private  sector \nparticipation is encouraged, but actual investment has been limited to the generation subsector. \nADB\u2019s intervention will promote economic efficiency and commercial operations.  \n \nThe  state  power  sector  has  made  a  transition  from  the  former  SEB  monopoly  to  a \n23. \nmonopsony,15  with  full  regulation  of  transmission  and  distribution  and  limited  competition  in \ngeneration.  Further  evolution  to  wholesale  competition  is  being  fostered  by  power  trading \nbetween  generating  plants  and  distribution  units.  Uttaranchal  has  power  banking  and  trading \narrangements with Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab that take advantage of complementary seasonal \nsurpluses.  Currently  15%  of  generation  capacity  can  be  made  available  to  the  open  market \n(after fulfilling in-state demand) and dispatch is on a merit order basis (lowest cost of generation \ngets preferential dispatch).16 UPCL currently manages the power trading activity. GOU plans to \n\nlegislative  and  policy \n\nin  Uttaranchal \n\nis  conducive \n\nframework \n\nThe \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n14 The Government of India, GOU, and the Rural Electrification Corporation signed a memorandum of Understanding \n    on 23 June 2005 for implementation of this program. \n15  ADB.  2004.

Utilities and IPPs (licensees) are required to petition \nUERC  for  tariffs,  and  after  consideration  of  stakeholders\u2019  inputs,  UERC  rules  on  tariff \napplications.  The  resulting  tariff  orders  are  the  key  instrument  of  regulation  and  sector \ngovernance.  Licensees  are  allowed  to  appeal  the  tariff  orders,  which  may  eventually  be \nresolved  by  court  rulings.  Transmission  and  distribution  systems  are  currently  operated  by \nlicensed  monopolies  (PTCUL  and  UPCL,  respectively).  PTCUL  acts  as  a  common  carrier \nproviding  open  access  to  all  generating  plants.  The  generation  subsector  is  competitive,  with \nUJVNL,  the  central  public  sector  utilities,  and  several  IPP  companies  actively  operating, \nconstructing, and developing new power plants.  \n \n25. \nUERC  has  aggressively  implemented  the  tariff  order  system,  which  has  been  the  key \ndriver of restructuring and commercialization, especially in the distribution subsector. UERC has \nlimited  professional  staff  and  a  single  chairperson.  It  plans  to  add  more  officers  in  the  near \nfuture, which will improve its professional capabilities. UERC can avail itself of capacity building \nsupported by ADB\u2019s intervention (Appendix 4).18  \n \n\nc. \n\nTariffs \n\n26. \nThe tariff orders support the rationalization of operating costs and the commercialization \nof  overall  system  operations.  Most  important  in  the  Indian  context,  the  tariff  orders  reflect  the \nofficial  viewpoint  that  electric  power  will  be  provided  on  a  cost  of  supply  basis  and  that  all \nconsumers  will  pay  for  electric  service.  Tariffs  include  consideration  of  good  governance, \nfinancial sustainability, distributive justice, economic efficiency, and fair pricing. The tariff-setting \nprocess  is  consistent  with  ADB  guidance.19  The  tariff  orders  address  inadequate  financial \nmanagement,  weak  corporate  governance,  inefficient  operation,  and  obsolete  operational \nprocedures, especially in the distribution subsector (Appendix 2). \n \n27. \nThe  tariff  orders  are  periodically  updated  to  accommodate  adjustments  based  on  the \nutilities\u2019  investment  programs,  provide  a  framework  for  rational  pricing  structure,  and  allow  a \n14%  return  on  equity.  Distribution  tariffs  include  lifeline  tariffs  for  poor  households  and \ngraduated increases in tariffs (25% every 3 months) for unmetered connections. T&D losses are \nto  be  reduced  by  20%  between  2003  and  2008  from  28%  to  23%.  Universal  metering  is \nrequired.20  A  pricing  incentive  in  the  form  of  a  rebate  is  provided  for  high-tension  industrial \ncustomers (connected at 11 kV and above), which account for about 20% of power sales. Time \n\n                                                 \n17 GOU has commissioned an independent  analysis  of power sector development  at the state level that includes  a \nreview  of  opportunities  for  power  trading  as  well  as  of  distribution  reforms.  GOU  plans  to  incorporate  an \nindependent power trading company after a daily, year-round power surplus has been established.   \n\n18 UERC plans to expand from its current one officer to three officers in the next year, and additional professional staff \n\nare anticipated as well. ADB has included the addition of two officers as an assurance (see para. 77). \n\n19 ADB. 2003. Setting User Charges for Public Services: Policies and Practice at the Asian Development Bank.

A \nrebate is now available for residential consumers who install solar water heating systems. \n \n28. \nThe  implementation  of  new  tariff  orders  has  been  driving  commercialization,  but  not \nwithout  resistance  from  the  utilities.  UERC  has  aggressively  interpreted  the  utilities\u2019  financial \ncondition and fiscal structure in a manner that has reduced both wholesale and retail tariffs. This \nhas  been  beneficial  to  end  users  and  to  UPCL,  which  has  realized  an  increase  in  its  gross \nmargin: in recent years it has been purchasing power at an average price of Rs1.0 per kWh and \nselling  to  end  users  at  an  average  price  of  Rs2.5  per  kWh.  UJVNL,  which  believes  that  the \ncurrent tariffs are insufficient to create retained earnings for new investment, has challenged the \nreduction of the wholesale generating tariffs. UERC believes that the reduced generating tariffs \naccurately reflect the fact that UJVNL inherited fully amortized and depreciated assets from the \nformer Uttar Pradesh SEB. The uncertainties related to UERC\u2019s interpretation of utility financial \nstatements  versus  cost  of  supply  principles  are  expected  to  disappear  as  new  investments \nbegin to dominate utility operations and as UERC and the utilities gain more experience through \nsuccessive  tariff  petitions  and  orders.  ADB\u2019s  intervention  will  promote  reconciliation  of  tariff \nissues  and  rationalization  of  tariffs,  with  assurances  for  cost  recovery  for  ADB-supported \ninvestments.  \n \n\nd. \n\nGovernance \n\n29. \nThe  SEB  has  been  unbundled  into  three  limited  liability  corporations,  100%  owned  by \nGOU.  UJVNL  and  PTCUL  are  relatively  new  organizations  with  strong  capital  structures \nconsisting  of  low  debt  and  healthy  liquidity.  UPCL  continues  to  experience  large  nontechnical \nlosses  and  has  been  directed  via  tariff  orders  to  enact  a  comprehensive  loss  reduction \nprogram.21  The  utilities\u2019  financial  and  operational  performance  is  expected  to  improve  in  the \nnear term.  \n \nADB\u2019s intervention will support the transition of the generation and transmission utilities \n30. \nfrom  the  traditional  public  utility  organizational  model,  with  a  large  staff  handling  all  business \noperations,  toward  an  asset  management  type  of  structure,  with  minimum  full-time  staff  and \nextensive  outsourcing  of  certain  functions.  An  initial  step  in  this  transition  process  is  the \nadoption  of  turnkey  types  of  contracts  for  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  of  new \npower system infrastructure. The ADB-supported investments will be the first use of these types \nof contracts in the state.  \n \nCorporate  management  is  shifting  toward  a  performance-oriented  system  with  open \n31. \nrecruitment \nInternational \naccounting standards are being practiced or adopted.22 Billing and collection systems are being \nupgraded, especially for the distribution company.23 ADB has sought appropriate assurances to \nimprove overall corporate governance, with capacity building included to support the corporate \ngovernance improvements.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n21  UERC has noted that universal metering in the state\u2019s three major urban load centers would be the best near-term \nstep  for  reducing  nontechnical  losses.  UPCL  is  in  the  process  of  installing  modern  electronic  meters  and  is \nconsidering using prepaid metering systems. \n\nfor  management  positions  and \n\nindependent  board  members. \n\n22  Internal audit committees are to be given full autonomy. \n23  UPCL is planning to implement online billing and collection by the end of 2006. \n\n\fe. \n\nPublic-Private Sector Development Strategy \n\n \n32. \nGOU  is  cognizant  of  the  need  for  private  investment  to  meet  the  sector\u2019s  overall \nfinancing requirements, and has proceeded to use private capital methodically as a complement \nto  government-led  investments  in  a  broad  public-private  partnership,  beginning  with  private \nparticipation  in  generation.  UJVNL  manages  an  IPP  participation  program,  with  more  than  50 \nout of 99 projects slated for private participation.24 The response from IPPs has been positive, \nalthough  limited  mainly  to  domestic  firms.  The  IPP  share  of  new  hydropower  projects  is \nexpected  to  grow  gradually  in  the  near  term.  UERC  has  encouraged  IPP  participation  and \ndisputes about tariffs have not emerged.  \n \n33. \nUPCL  must  improve  its  overall  operating  efficiency  and  financial  health  before  it  can \ncommence ownership diversification. PTCUL plans to open selected transmission segments to \na competitive bidding process while retaining the role of asset manager. PTCUL may be opened \nup  to  private  investment  pending  successful  private  participation  in  interstate  transmission \nprojects. Recognizing the enormous capital requirements for hydropower development, UJVNL \nhas  proposed  raising  equity  in  domestic  capital  markets  via  a  limited  public  offering,  but  no \ntimetable for such an offering has been set.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nINVESTMENT PROPOSAL \n\n34. \nThe Government of India (GOI) and GOU have requested ADB to provide $300 million to \npartly fund a subset of the investment program covering generation, transmission, and capacity \nbuilding. This represents a relatively small share of the total funding needs and financing plan. \nHaving ADB as a partner (i) brings down the total cost of funds, (ii) sets out standards in various \nthematic areas, and (iii) helps to attract other long-term financiers to the sector. GOI and GOU \nhave requested ADB to extend this finance in the form of a multitranche financing facility (MFF). \n \nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n35. \nADB  will  finance  part  of  the  Investment  Program  from  2006  through  2012,  resulting  in \nsufficient  power  capacity  to  meet  all  in-state  demand  and  achieve  a  year-round  exportable \nsurplus  by  2010.25  The  generation  and  transmission  parts  of  the  Investment  Program  through \n2012, with candidate subprojects highlighted, are presented in Appendix 2. New SHPP capacity \nwill provide additional power to local grids in rural areas and is expected to meet about one third \nof the projected in-state, nonindustrial power demand at the time of commissioning. Additional \npower output from the RMU of existing HPPs will be sufficient to meet small- and medium-scale \nindustrial  demand  at  the  time  of  commissioning.  The  expansion  of  PTCUL\u2019s  state-level \ntransmission grid will (i) improve system reliability; (ii) facilitate in-state and interregional power \ntransfers; (iii) facilitate a reduction in overall system losses; (iv) improve the utilization of existing \nand planned power plants; and (v) promote further development of a national electricity market \nby connecting to the northern region grid. The total power delivery attributable to the Investment \nProgram  will  serve  more  than  12.0  million  people  in  Uttaranchal  and  the  northern  region  grid \n\n                                                 \n24  Projects  are  allocated  based  on  potential  risks  and  financial  viability,  with  more  commercially  attractive  projects \ndesignated  for  IPPs.  A  two-stage  tender  process  is  employed.  Following  technical  prequalification,  IPPs  submit \nfinancial  offers,  with  a  specific  bid  above  a  predetermined  floor  price  (cost  per  MW  installed).  The  best  financial \noffer is awarded the project development rights. The IPP then has an incentive to construct and commission the \nHPP as soon as possible to recover its initial investment. \n\n25  Interstate  power  sales  will  use  the  lines  of  the  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India,  Limited,  with  actual  trading \n\nmanaged by UPCL. Some augmentation of Northern Grid systems may be required to prevent bottlenecks.  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nservice  area.  Parallel  efforts  by  UPCL  in  relation  to  rural  electrification  and  local  grid \nimprovements will complement ADB\u2019s intervention. \n \n36. \nThe  2003  Electricity  Act  has  created  an  enabling  environment  to  improve  efficiency, \nsupport  commercialization,  and  promote  private  sector  participation.  The  proposed  executing \nagency and implementing agencies have developed a rational sector expansion plan formulated \non a least-cost basis. PTCUL and UJVNL, both relatively new companies, have some capacity \nconstraints  with  respect  to  donor-funded  project  implementation  (Appendix  4),  therefore  the \nproposed interventions include financial support for sector capacity building activities including \nGOU,  UED,  the  state  utilities,  and  other  agencies.  Related  advisory  TA26  will  provide  project \nmanagement  support  and  build  capacity  in  the  project  management  office  (PMO)  and  the \nproject implementation units (PIUs) during the first year of implementation. Additional capacity \nbuilding  activities  will  be  defined  in  2006,  pursuant  to  completion  of  an  independent  policy \nanalysis being prepared for GOU and UED. \n  \n37. \nThe  proposed  SHPP  and  RMU  investments  can  be  implemented  independently  of  the \nproposed  transmission  subprojects,  which  depend  on  associated  HPPs  not  financed  by  ADB. \nThe  transmission  lines,  which  require  about  3  years  to  construct,  must  be  ready  for  initial \noperation  6  months  prior  to  the  commissioning  of  the  associated  large  HPPs,  which  require \nabout  5  years  to  construct.  Based  on  the  projected  HPP  commissioning  schedule,  the  critical \ntransmission system investments will require phased construction of three groups of subprojects \nand associated HPPs. The first group of subprojects is expected to be completed within 5 years, \nthe  second group  is  expected  to  be  completed  within  7  years,  and  the  third  group  is currently \nbeing  defined  and  also  is  expected  to  be  completed  with  7  years.  Based  on  due  diligence \nconducted  to  date,  the  capacity  of  UED  and  the  implementing  agencies  to  use  external \nfinancing is estimated to be on the order of $40.0 million to $60.0 million per year. This capacity, \ncombined  with  the  associated  HPP  commissioning  schedule,  indicates  that  the  proposed \nInvestment Program to be supported by ADB will require 5 to 7 years for full implementation and \nwill require flexibility in subproject selection to achieve the Program\u2019s objectives and mitigate the \noverall investment risk. The MFF modality is ideally suited to this type of investment program.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  ADB-supported  subset  of  the  Investment  Program  will  cover  the  following  three \n\n38. \nareas: \n \n \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\n \n\n \n\nClean  Energy  Development.  Generating  capacity  will  be  expanded  by  the \nconstruction  of  new  SHPPs  and  by  energy  efficiency  improvements  at  existing \ngrid-connected HPPs. Funding will also be provided for design, construction, and \ncommissioning of a hydrometeorological monitoring system to support statewide \nhydropower system operations and the planning and design of future hydropower \nexpansion.  \nTransmission System Expansion. Time-critical transmission lines, substations, \nand  auxiliary  equipment  will  be  constructed  to  evacuate  power  from  new \nassociated HPPs.  \n\n(iii)   Capacity Building. This activity will support capacity building and strengthening \nof the institutional framework within GOU, UED, and the implementing agencies \n\n                                                 \n26  The TA for capacity building of the Project Management Office (ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to India for the \nUttaranchal Power Sector Capacity Building Project.  Manila), originally proposed as a TA attached to the loan, has \nbeen processed separately to accelerate project readiness. The TA was approved on 17 August 2005. \n\n\fto undertake power system expansion activities in a cost-effective manner. It will \nfocus initially on implementation through the PMO and will include (a) training of \nUED and implementing agency staff to transfer and implement international best \npractices in transmission, generation, maintenance, and rehabilitation design and \noperations; (b) consulting services for design and construction management; (c) \nacquisition  of  computer  hardware  and  software  for  the  PMO  and  the  PIUs;  (d) \nfield supervision, including compliance with safeguards and external monitoring; \nand  (e)  corporate  development,  including  advisory  services  for  restructuring, \ninitial design of an independent power trading company, and other activities to be \ndefined  in  consultation between  GOU,  UED,  and  ADB.  Appendix  4  presents  an \ninitial summary scope of work.  \n\n \nC.  \n\nTechnical Justification and Selection Criteria \n\n39. \nThe long-term generation and transmission expansion program for Uttaranchal has been \ndesigned based on national, regional, and state-level least-cost expansion planning led by the \nMinistry of Power, the Central Electric Authority, UED, UJVNL, PTCUL, and UPCL. The overall \nexpansion program is technically, financially, and economically viable and can be implemented \nin an environmentally friendly and socially acceptable manner. State-of-the-art technologies and \ninternational  best  practices  will  be  applied  to  all  investments,  for  example,  upgrading  from \nanalog to digital control systems, including the System Control and Automated Data Acquisition \nsystem for operations; applying global positioning and geographic information systems in route \nsurveys, planning, and design; using tunnels instead of open channel for SHPPs; and upgrading \ntechnology during RMU activities. The following are the criteria for selecting each subproject: \n \n\nSubprojects will be consistent with the overall least-cost expansion plan and will \nbe formulated on a least-cost basis. Subprojects will be technically feasible and \nwill  use  advanced  but  proven  technologies,  with  performance-based  design \nconsistent  with  international  benchmarks  for  system  efficiency  and  operational \nrisks. All subprojects will be economically viable and financially sustainable.  \nHydropower subprojects will be part of UJVNL\u2019s expansion plans, and scheduling \nfor  connection  to  the  transmission  system  will  be  coordinated  with  PTCUL. \nTransmission  subprojects  will  be  part  of  PTCUL\u2019s  expansion  plans,  and \nscheduling will be consistent with the commissioning of new generating capacity. \nSubproject designs will be consistent with the Environmental Management Plan \n(EMP),  the  resettlement  framework,  and  the  indigenous  peoples  development \nframework  (IPDF).  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  and  indigenous \npeoples  development  plans  based  on  the  agreed  IPDF  and  the  resettlement \nframework will be prepared as necessary for additional subprojects prior to ADB \napproval for funding. \nAll  subprojects  require  environmental  assessments  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy 2002.27 Category A and B subprojects will require a summary \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA)  and  a  summary  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE),  respectively,  to  be  prepared  and  made  available  to  the \ngeneral public 120 days before approval. EMPs with budgets will be prepared for \neach subproject. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n27  ADB. 2002. Environment Policy.

Special Features \n\n1. \n\nCarbon Emissions Trading \n\n \nThe  clean  energy  investments  may  qualify  for  greenhouse gas  emission  reductions,  or \n40. \ncarbon  credit,  trading  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol's  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM).  The \nCDM  is  one  of  three  flexible  mechanisms28  established  by  the  Kyoto  Protocol  aimed  at  cost-\neffectively  reducing  global  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases.  The  CDM  is  a  market-based \nfinancial instrument with the dual purpose of assisting developing nations to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment and industrial countries to meet their emission reduction targets. The CDM allows \nindustrial countries to invest in \u201cclean\u201d projects in developing countries, for example, renewable \nenergy such as hydropower, energy efficiency, and waste management, and to acquire certified \nemission reductions29\u2014generically referred to as \u201ccarbon credits\u201d\u2014that can be used to comply \nwith  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  ADB  has  provided  base  financing  for  three  CDM  projects30  with \npending carbon credit transactions, and is currently developing several more projects with CDM \npotential.  ADB\u2019s  CDM  facility  provides  parallel  assistance to  projects  that  can  qualify  for  CDM \nand to facilitate agreements between sellers, or project owners, and buyers of carbon credits.31  \n \n41. \nADB has been providing active assistance with further definition and qualification of the \npotential CDM opportunities since early 2005.32 Based on experience in neighboring Himachal \nPradesh,  the  SHPP  subprojects  are  highly  likely  to  qualify  for  the  CDM.  Based  on  previous \nprojects  supported  by  ADB,  the  CDM-related  revenue  is  expected  to  generate  undiscounted \nfinancial returns of at least 10 to 15% of project costs. The CDM facility recently solicited carbon \ncredit bids for a subcomponent of the Liaoning Environment Improvement Project (see footnote \n30)  of  more  than  $10  per  ton  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent,  compared  with  typical  offers  of \naround $5 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent being offered by the World Bank\u2019s CDM funds.  \nGiven the potential financial upside, ADB is continuing to explore other opportunities for carbon \ncredit revenue in the investment program.  \n \n\n2. \n\nRenewable Energy Services  \n\n \n42. \nThe Uttaranchal Renewal Energy Development Agency has requested ADB support for \na  broad  range  of  renewable  energy  development  activities,  including  commercialization  of \nbiofuel  production,  after-market  solar  energy  services,  and  mini-  and  micro-hydropower \nexpansion  for  rural  and  off-grid  applications.  The  Global  Environment  Facility  has  responded \n\n                                                 \n28 The other two mechanisms are Emissions Trading and Joint Implementation. \n29  Certified  emission  reductions  are  the  official  commodity  generated  by  CDM  projects.  One  certified  emission \n\nreduction equals 1 ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.  \n\n30  ADB.  2003.

Uttaranchal  has  been  proposed  for  inclusion  as  a  focus  state \nfor  which  implementation  is  expected  to  begin  in  late  2005  (ADB.  2004.  Technical  Assistance  to  India  for  the \nCapacity  Building  for  Clean  Development  Mechanism  in  India.  Manila).  The  executing  agency  for  this  TA  is  the \nMinistry  of  Environment  and  Forests,  which  is  also  India\u2019s  National  Designated  Authority  for  Clean  Development \nMechanism.  UJVNL  has  requested  assistance  from  ADB  to  evaluate  the  feasibility  of  developing  advanced \ntechnology to convert excess power from run-of-river plants to other usable forms of energy, for example, hydrogen \ncan be produced from water via electrolysis, then used to power fuel cells. \n\n\fpositively to a preliminary concept paper for a parallel project to support these activities.

The Government is required to comply with the FFA requirements.  Pursuant to the \nFFA, the Government has submitted to ADB the first PFR in the amount of $26.5 million. The \nfirst PFR is presented to the Board, together with the FFA. The loans under the MFF will finance \ncivil  works,  equipment  supply  and  erection,  consulting  services,  and  other  capacity  building \nactivities. The minimum amount of a loan request will be $25.0 million. All of the provisions of \nthe  ordinary  operations  loan  regulations  applicable  to  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased loans36 will apply to each loan, subject to any modifications that may be included under \nany loan agreement.

Board  Information  Reports  will  be  submitted  on  an  annual  basis  or \nmore frequently if necessary. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe Investment Program will be implemented over 7 years, inclusive of procurement and \n51. \nconstruction  activities,  and  will  be  completed  by  January  2013.  Each  loan  agreement  is \nexpected to have a utilization period of 5 years. The indicative implementation schedule for the \nappraised subprojects is presented in Appendix 7. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement and Consulting Services \n\n52. \nEquipment and materials to be financed under the loan will be procured in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  International  competitive  bidding  will  be  used  for  civil \nworks  contracts  with  an  estimated  value  equivalent  to  or  more  than  $10.0  million,  for  turnkey \ncontracts,38  and  for  supply  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  or  more  than  $1.0 \nmillion. International shopping or local competitive bidding will be used for contracts estimated \nat  $100,000  to  $1.0  million  and  direct  purchase  will  be  used  for  contracts  worth  less  than \n$100,000.  Contract  packages  will  be  prepared  to  ensure  maximum  competition  under \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Similar  contractual  arrangements  and  specifications  will  be \napplied  to  other  subprojects.  Indicative  procurement  packages  are  presented  in  Appendix  8. \nWeb-based  procurement  will  be  used  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  following  procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB.39  Consulting  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers. Services \nwill  be  provided  through  a  firm  or  firms  recruited  and  engaged  under  international  competitive \nbidding procedures using the quality- and cost-based selection method and simplified technical \nproposals.  For  specialized  tasks  with  a  contract  value  less  than  $100,000,  individual  experts \nmay be recruited based on biodata submitted in response to specific terms of reference for the \nassignment. \n \n\n                                                 \n37  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  public  communications  (2005),  project  reports  will  be  made  available  to  the \n\npublic. \n\n38 Most proposed subprojects will utilize turnkey types of contracts. This will be the first time that PTCUL and UJVNL \n\nwill use turnkey procurement for SHPP, RMU, and transmission investments. \n\n39  UJVNL has implemented a web-based procurement system. Project Coordination and Procurement Division of the \n\nCentral Operations Services Office will be consulted on further e-procurement. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n53. \nThe  individual  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  and  ADB\u2019s  Interim  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  Operations,  LIBOR-\nBased Loan Products, both as amended from time to time.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvanced Procurement and Retroactive Financing \n\nAdvanced  procurement  was  approved  in  July  2005.  Draft  prequalification  and  bidding \n54. \ndocuments have been prepared for contract packages covering 2 clean energy subprojects and \n5 transmission subprojects. The Government has requested that retroactive financing be made \navailable for time-critical expenditures necessary to expedite subprojects implementation. ADB \nhas advised that retroactive financing of expenditures incurred from 12 months prior to signing \nthe  corresponding  loan  agreement,  with  a  ceiling  up  to  20%  of  the  loan  amount,  may  be \navailable for individual loans under the proposed MFF. The Government and GOU have been \ninformed  that  approval  of  advanced  procurement  action  and  retroactive  financing  does  not \ncommit ADB to finance any of the proposed subprojects. \n \n\n7. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to and discussed with the Government, GOU, \n55. \nand  the  implementing  agencies.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to projects under \nthe  MFF.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  are \nincluded  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Investment  Program.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with projects under the MFF will include \nprovisions specifying ADB\u2019s right to audit and examine the records and accounts of UED and all \ncontractors, suppliers, and consultants and other service providers as they relate to the projects \nunder the MFF.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n56. \nQuarterly  progress  reports  will  be  prepared  for  the  individual  loans  and  subprojects  for \nsubmittal  to  ADB.  The  reports  will  include  a  description  of  physical  progress,  problems,  and \ndifficulties  encountered  and  a  summary  of  financial  accounts  that  will  consist  of  loan \nexpenditures during the period, year to date, and total to date. A project completion report will \nbe  submitted  within  3  months  following  completion  of  each  loan.  PTCUL  and  UJVNL  will \nmaintain  separate  accounts  for  each  loan.  Within  6  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial  year, \nUED,  PTCUL,  and  UJVNL  will  submit  annual  pro  forma  project  accounts  and  un-audited \nfinancial statements for UED and the implementing agencies, and will submit audited accounts \nand financial statements within 9 months of the close of the financial year. PTCUL and UJVNL \nwill continue the practice of hiring independent auditors to audit their annual financial statements \nand  annual  project  accounts  on  a  schedule  to  be  agreed  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The \nauditors  will  submit  their  report  together  with  the  respective  annual  financial  statements  and \nannual project accounts reports.  \n \n\n9. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n57. \nThe  PMO,  with  inputs  from  PTCUL,  UJVNL,  and  UED,  will  prepare  quarterly  progress \nreports and submit these to ADB within 45 days of the end of each quarter. These reports will \n\n\fprovide  (i)  a  narrative  description  of  progress  made  during  the  period,  (ii)  changes  in  the \nimplementation schedule, (iii) problems or difficulties encountered, and (iv) work to be carried \nout in the next period. The progress reports will also include a summary financial account for \nthe  project  components,  including  subprojects,  consisting  of  project  expenditures  during  the \nperiod,  total  expenditure  to  date,  and  benefit  monitoring  in  accordance  with  procedures  and \ndetails  acceptable  to  ADB.  Performance  will  be  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  indicators  and \ntargets stipulated in the design and monitoring framework. The ADB project team will prepare \nperiodic reports to inform the ADB Board of Directors of overall progress.  A Board information \nreport will be submitted annually, and supplemental progress reports will be submitted prior to \nmanagement approval of individual loan agreements. \n \n\n10. \n\nReview \n\n58. \nADB  will  field  an  inception  mission  within  3  months  of  the  first  loan  approval.  ADB  will \nreview  the  implementation  and  operations  based  on  quarterly  progress  reports  and  meet  with \nUED and the Government semiannually to discuss implementation progress. A midterm review \nto be carried out 2 years after loan effectiveness will focus on the engineering, resettlement, and \nenvironmental  aspects  of  the  ADB-supported  investments  and  review  the  financial  status  of \nPTCUL  and  UJVNL.  Representatives  of  ADB,  UED,  and  the  implementing  agencies  will  take \npart  in  the  review.  The  review  will  allow  for  any  necessary  midcourse  corrections  to  ensure \nsuccessful  implementation  and  achievement  of  objectives.  A  project  completion  report  will  be \nsubmitted  within  3  months  following  completion  of  the  individual  loans.  A  facility  completion \nreport will be prepared after the completion of all ADB-supported activities and subprojects. \n \n\nIV. \n\nBENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n59. \nCandidate subprojects that have been appraised by ADB and GOU include new SHPPs, \nRMU  of  existing  HPPs,  a  hydrometeorological  monitoring  system  to  support  generation \noperations, and new transmission lines and substations to evacuate power from five new HPPs. \nThe  candidate  generation  and  transmission  subprojects  are  presented  in  Appendix  2,  Table \nA2.4. Indicative cost estimates for the appraised subprojects are presented in Appendix 5. \n \nCapacity  building  activities  will  be  implemented  as  separate  subprojects.  The  initial \n60. \nsubproject  will  cover  consulting  services  for  design,  procurement,  construction  management, \nand  implementation  of  environmental  and  social  safeguards  (see  Appendix  4).  Additional \nsubprojects  for  corporate  development,  incorporation  of  a  power  trading  company,  and  other \nsector reforms will be defined in consultation between ADB, GOU, and UED.   \n \n61. \nThe  financial  analyses  were  carried  out  on  an  individual  subproject  basis,  whereas \neconomic  analysis  was  conducted  using  an  integrated,  macro  time-slice  approach.  The \nproposed investment is based on a least-cost expansion plan for generation and transmission.  \n \nA. \n \nThe  institutional  and  subproject  financial  evaluations  have  been  carried  out  in \n62. \naccordance  with  the  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment \nProjects  Financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank.  The  analyses  cover  the  period  from \nFY2005\u20132006 to FY2025\u20132026. Financial viability was examined by comparing the incremental \ncosts  and  benefits  under  with  and  without  investment  scenarios  in  real  terms  using  constant \nFY2004\u20132005  prices.  In  calculating  the  forecast  energy  tariffs  and  wheeling  charges  for  the \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\ndifferent project components, UERC regulations40 on tariff determination for energy generation \nand transmission services were applied as appropriate. UERC\u2019s regulations are modeled on the \nCentral  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission\u2019s  regulations,  which  allow  for  full  cost  recovery, \nincluding  capital  costs  (at  a  debt  to  equity  ratio  of  up  to  70:30),  depreciation,  14%  return  on \nequity,  and  interest  at  actual  cost.  Operating  costs  are  fully  recoverable  for  prudent  levels  of \nexpenditures  and  are  generally  based  on  accepted  benchmark  allowances  or  historical \nperformance. There is also potential for higher returns from generation under Ministry of Power \nrules  that  permit  15%  or  more  of  UJVNL\u2019s  production  to  be  sold  on  the  open  market,  where \npeak  supplies  command  a  premium.  The  financial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  for  clean \nenergy and transmission investments were calculated on an after tax basis and indicate that the \ncore  subprojects  are  financially  viable.  The  resulting  FIRRs  compare  favorably  with  the \nweighted average cost of capital of 4.36%. The FIRR for clean energy subprojects is 4.8%, and \nfor  transmission  subprojects  is  7.4%.  The  detailed  projected  financial  performance  for  each \ncompany  is  presented  in  Appendix  9.  A  summary  of  financial  analyses,  including  sensitivity \nanalyses and risk assessment, is presented in Appendix 10 and Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \nB. \n \n63. \nThe  economic  analysis  reviews  power  sector  policies,  demand  and  supply  forecasts, \nand least-cost system planning methodologies and includes a cost-benefit study. The demand \nand supply review shows that India in general, and the Northern Region in particular, suffer from \nchronic  supply  shortages  and  that  the  project  investments  are  justified  based  on  forecast \ndemand and supply considerations. The Investment Program will partly generate benefits in the \nform of resource cost saving by displacing investments in coal-fired and gas-fired power plants \nand  will  partly  meet  incremental  demands  for  electric  power.  Cost-benefit  analysis  shows  that \nhydropower  is  cheaper  than  the  displaced  thermal  power  and  that  the  advantage  is \nstrengthened  when  the  environmental  benefits  of  avoided  carbon  dioxide  emissions  are  taken \ninto  account.  The  benefits  of  the  incremental  consumption  were  estimated  by  developing  a \ndemand  function  for  the  household  sector  that  calculates  domestic  consumers\u2019  willingness  to \npay  for  incremental  supply  and  by  assuming  that  for  other consumer  categories,  the  tariff is  a \nconservative proxy for their willingness to pay. The economic cost-benefit analysis results in an \neconomic internal rate of return of 21% for the base case, and when environmental benefits are \nadded  increases  to  28%.  The  sensitivity  analyses  show  that  the  Investment  Program  remains \njustified should various risks materialize, but is sensitive to reductions in demand. However, low \ndemand  is  considered  a  relatively  small  risk  given  India\u2019s  long  history  of  unmet  demand.  The \ndetailed analysis is provided in Appendix 11. \n \nC. \n \n64. \nBased on the findings of an initial poverty reduction and social assessment, a summary \npoverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  was  developed.  During  Investment  Program  design, \nparticipatory  approaches  were  undertaken,  including  consultations  with  representatives  of \ncommunities,  local  governments,  and  other  stakeholders.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial strategy is presented in Appendix 12. \n \n65. \nAppraised Subprojects. A full Resettlement Plan was prepared for the first and second \ngroups  of  subprojects  appraised  by  ADB  and  GOU  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement. Entitlements in the Resettlement Plan are consistent with those in the \n\nSocial Aspects \n\n                                                 \n40  Uttaranchal  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  Regulations.  2004.  Terms  and  Conditions  for  Determination  of \n\nHydro Generation Tariff and Terms and Conditions for Determination of Transmission Tariff.  India. \n\n\fentitlement  matrix  of  the  summary  resettlement  framework  (Appendix  13).  According  to  the \nResettlement  Plan,  the  expansion  of  transmission  systems  will  require  8.03  hectares  (ha)  of \npermanent  land  acquisition  and  179.21  ha  of  temporary  acquisition  from  private  owners.41  In \naddition, 16.03 ha of public land will also be acquired. SHPPs will require 3.12 ha of permanent \nacquisition from private owners and no temporary acquisition plus 10.87 ha of public land. RMU \nand  institutional  strengthening  will  not  involve  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  resulting  from  core  subprojects  will  affect  25  households  on  a \npermanent basis and 229 on a temporary basis. None of the components will involve any loss of \nstructures. \n \n66. \nThe  Resettlement  Plan  provides  details  on  the  impacts  of  appraised  subprojects.  All \naffected people will be provided with compensation and resettlement assistance if their land is \npermanently  or  temporarily  acquired;42  their  income  sources  are  adversely  affected;  and  their \ncrops, trees, and other facilities or access to properties are damaged or reduced because of the \nSubprojects. A lack of legal documents pertaining to their customary rights of occupancy or of \ntitles does not affect affected people\u2019s eligibility for compensation. In addition to compensation \npayments  in  accordance  with  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  those  affected  will  receive  additional \nassistance to match replacement costs for lost land; the transaction costs, including stamps and \nregistration  costs,  for  the  purchase  of  replacement  land;  and  other  forms  of  resettlement \nassistance,  such  as  transition  allowances  and  agricultural  inputs  for  reestablishing  crops. \nLosses  of  profits  and  income  because  of  property  losses  or  loss  of  access  to  property, \nregardless of whether or not the affected person has title to the land, will be compensated. To \nrestore  income  losses,  compensation  for  lost  workdays  and/or  income  and  training  will  be \nprovided  to  affected  people.  Short-term  training  will  be  provided  by  engaging  non-government \nagencies where feasible. \n \n67. \nDetailed  field  work  to  assess  the  socioeconomic  profile  of  affected  people  did  not  find \nscheduled tribes or indigenous people in the subproject areas, thus the Investment Program is \nnot  expected  to  affect  indigenous  people  negatively  or  differentially.  Socioeconomic  data \nindicate the presence of vulnerable groups, and provisions to address impacts on these groups \nhave  been  made  in  the  Resettlement  Plan  and  resettlement  framework.  Special  assistance  to \nvulnerable  groups  includes  prioritization  in  land-for-land  compensation  schemes;  additional \nallowances  for  house  reconstruction,  relocation,  and  income  losses;  specialized  training;  and \npriority for employment in subproject activities. \n \n68. \nOther  Subprojects.  A  resettlement  framework  and  an  IPDF  were  prepared  and  will \nserve  as  a  basis  for  preparing  subsequent  resettlement  plans  and  IPDFs  for  additional \nsubprojects as required. All plans will be prepared in full consultation with affected people and \nwill be disclosed to them in draft form. The resettlement framework and IPDF will be placed on \nADBs web site. \n \nD. \n \n69. \nUttaranchal  is  one  of  India\u2019s  poorest  states.  In  2002,  the  per  capita  net  state  domestic \nproduct was Rs13,000, compared with the national average of Rs18,000. A recent survey found \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\n                                                 \n41 Of 179 ha temporarily acquired, owners will be compensated for lost agricultural income for an estimated 115 ha of \n\nagricultural land. \n\n42  Temporary acquisition for the storage of construction materials and equipment for substations, SHPPs, and RMU \nin relation to core subprojects will involve government land. For temporary acquisition of private agricultural land, \naffected persons will be provided compensation for lost agricultural income. \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nthat  36%  of  rural  families  in  Uttaranchal  are  below  the  poverty  line.  Poverty  is  unevenly \ndistributed throughout the state, with pockets of extreme poverty located in interior rural areas. \n \n70. \nThe  Investment  Program  is  expected  to  result  in  more  efficient  and  reliable  delivery  of \nelectric services. Poor and vulnerable consumers, including hospitals, schools, and other social \nutilities, which are often hardest hit by inadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power \nquality,  will  benefit  directly  from  the  investments.  Direct  positive  economic  and  social  benefits \nwill result from the subprojects. Power generated by SHPPs will be connected to the local grid \nat  33  kV,  increasing  local  grid  capacity  and  bringing  the  benefits  of  electricity,  which  include \nbetter health care, sanitation, education, greater income-earning opportunities, and higher living \nstandards,  to  remote  communities.  RMU  activities  will  provide  more  reliable  power  to  the \nexisting grid.  \n \n71. \nThe Investment Program is expected to create new full-time employment opportunities. \nFor  civil  works  in  relation  to  SHPP  and  RMU  investments,  160  and  240  unskilled  workers, \nrespectively,  will  be  hired  for  a  period  of  3  years.  For  the  civil  works  related  to  transmission \nlines, about 650 unskilled local workers will be hired for a period of 18 months. Improved power \nsupplies  will  induce  light  industrial  and  commercial  activity,  creating  employment  opportunities \nand  improving  productivity  and  the  quality  of  outputs  in  the  manufacturing  and  agriculture \nsectors.  Indirect  positive  impacts  will  result  from  exports  of  power  to  the  northern  region  grid, \nallowing GOU to generate income that can be targeted specifically for social development in the \nstate, particularly for the poor. \n \nE. \n \nThe  SHPPs  are  classified  as  Category  A,43  the  transmission  subprojects  are  classified \n72. \nas  Category  B,  and  the  RMU  and  hydrology  subprojects  are  classified  as  Category  C. \nConsidering  the  potential  cumulative  impacts  of  the  overall  generation  and  transmission \nexpansion program, including associated HPPs not financed by ADB, the Investment Program \nhas  been  assigned  Category  A  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  2002  (see \nfootnote 27). Environmental impact assessments were prepared for the SHPPs and an IEE was \nprepared  for  the  transmission  lines  and  substations.  An  SEIA,  including  an  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework,  and  an  EMP  (with  budget)  were  prepared  based  on  the \nenvironmental impact assessments and IEE. Two rounds of public consultation were conducted \nthat  indicated  broad  support  for  the  Project  based  on  expected  economic  and  social  benefits. \nThe  SEIA  was  circulated  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  on  20  May  2005  and  was  translated  and  made \navailable  to  affected  people  in  the  project  area.  An  environmental  sector  assessment  was \nsubmitted to ADB on 17 June 2005. The findings and conclusions of the sector assessment are \nconsistent with the SEIA, namely, the investment benefits far outweigh negative impacts and the \nnegative  impacts  can  be  mitigated  in  a  cost-effective  manner.  Four  broad  alternatives  have \nbeen  considered:  (i)  no  action,  that  is,  importing  power  from  the  northern  region  grid;  (ii) \nexpansion  of  coal-fired  power  in  the  eastern  region,  coupled  with  interstate  transmission \nexpansion  to  wheel  power  to  the  northern  region  grid;  (iii)  construction  of  a  relatively  small \nnumber of large storage dams in Uttaranchal; and (iv) relatively smaller run-of-river plants as in \nthe  proposed  integrated  generation  and  transmission  expansion  program.  Alternative  (iv)  is \npreferred  on  the  basis  of  national  policy,  economic  analysis,  environmental  and  social  costs, \nand gestation period.44   \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\n                                                 \n43 Taken in isolation, the individual SHPPs could be assigned environment Category B.  \n44  Given  the  25-year  gestation  period  of  the  Tehri  dam  project,  GOU  adopted  an  informal  policy  of  avoiding  large \n\nstorage dams in favor of run-of-river designs.  \n\n\fBased  on  the  environmental  assessments  and  reconnaissance  surveys,  most  of  the \n73. \nimpacts will occur during construction. The SHPPs use trench weirs instead of dams, a design \nfeature that ensures the maintenance of minimum river flow. The rivers  are non-navigable, no \ncommercial or subsistence fisheries are located in the investment program area, and rural and \nvillage  water  use  will  not  be  affected.  The  principal  impacts  are  clearance  of  vegetation, \nmanagement of excavation soil and rock, and reduction in water flow in short sections of small \nrivers.  These  impacts  will  be  mitigated  by  appropriate  erosion  control  measures,  re-use  of \nexcavation  wastes  wherever  possible,  controlled  disposal  of  residual  excavation  wastes,  and \nprovision  of  compensation  for  reforestation  at  a  ratio  of  2  ha  of  forest  land  for  each  hectare \ntaken  by  the  subprojects.  No  endangered,  rare,  or  threatened  species  of  flora  or  fauna  have \nbeen  reported  at  any  subproject  sites.  Adequate  provisions  have  been  made  for  the \nenvironmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  requirements  and  their  associated  costs.  The \nInvestment Program will have a small \u201cfootprint\u201d: the maximum amount of land directly affected \nby  all  subproject  components  is  less  than  12  square  kilometers  out  of  a  total  program  area \nlarger than 51,000 square kilometers. The subproject sites are located mostly on land owned by \nGOU.  The  land  acquired  for  new  substations  is  mostly  uninhabited  and  unused  land  located \noutside  towns  and  villages.  Mitigation  measures  related  to  construction  and  specified  in  the \nEMP  will  be  incorporated  into  civil  works  contracts.  Implementation  of  mitigation  during \nconstruction will be primarily a responsibility of the contractors, but the implementing agencies \nwill be responsible for overall implementation of site-specific EMPs. \n \n74. \nThe  overall  objective  of  expanding  clean  energy  capacity  will  generate  local,  regional, \nand  global  environmental  benefits.  Local  air  quality,  particularly  indoor  air  quality,  will  improve \nbecause  of  the  substitution  of  electricity  for  biomass  (animal  dung  and  wood)  and  kerosene. \nRegional air quality will be preserved by offsetting the expansion of thermal generating capacity. \nGlobal  greenhouse  gas  reductions  will  also  accrue  by  offsetting  increases  in  thermal  power \ncapacity.45 \n \nF. \n \n75. \nRisks include (i) tariffs set below cost-recovery levels, rendering the subprojects and the \nInvestment  Program  financially  nonviable;  (ii)  delays  in  power  sector  reforms;  (iii)  delays  in \nregulatory approvals for transmission line rights-of-way; (iv)  delays in construction  of associated \nHPPs not financed by ADB; (v) increases in the prices of cement, steel, and other raw materials \nthat  would  render  the  investments  financially  nonviable;  (vi)  failure  to  mobilize  the  necessary \ncounterpart funds; and (vii) delays in procurement and contract awards. All these risks are low or \nhave  been  minimized  to  the  extent  possible  in  that  tariff  setting  on  new  plants  employs  a \ntransparent  formula  based  on  cost  of  supply  principles,  GOU  is  committed  to  ongoing  sector \nreforms,  regulatory  approval  for  rights-of-way  is  in  progress,  approximately  half  of  the  key \nassociated HPPs are at an advanced design stage or are under construction, raw material prices \nare expected to stabilize or decrease during the implementation period, and GOU has confirmed \nthat counterpart funds will be available.   \n \n\nPotential Risks \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n76. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  GOU  have  given  the \nfollowing  assurances,  which  have  largely  been  incorporated  in  the  Framework  Financing \nAgreement, and will be incorporated in the individual loan agreement and project agreement(s) \n\n                                                 \n45  As noted in para. 41 the SHPPs are expected to qualify for emissions trading under the CDM. \n\n21 \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nas  applicable  and  mutually  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB  for  each  Project  under \nthe MFF.  \n \n77. \nSector  Reforms.  GOU  will  ensure  that  its  three  power  utility  companies\u2014UJVNL, \nPTCUL and UPCL\u2014will conform to the tariff orders issued from time to time by UERC to ensure \nreduced T&D losses, rational power pricing, and graduated increase in tariffs as determined by \nUERC.  PTCUL  and  UJVNL  will  file  tariff  applications  with  UERC  in  a  timely  manner.  The \nGovernment and GOU will continue to emphasize and support the autonomy of PTCUL, UJVNL, \nand UPCL with respect to commercial, administrative, and  operational activities. As  required  by \nthe  Government,  GOU  will  enact  fiscal  responsibility  and  budget  management  legislation  to \neliminate its revenue deficit by FY2008. GOU will appoint two additional members to UERC as \nplanned by the end of 2006. PTCUL will appoint at least two independent directors by the end of \n2007. \n \n78.  Management  and  Implementation.  PTCUL  and  UJVNL  will  be  responsible  for \nplanning,  design,  and  procurement.  The  PMO  will  have  primary  responsibility  for  program \ncoordination.  UED,  PTCUL,  and  UJVNL  will  ensure  timely  and  adequate  provision  of \ncounterpart funds.  \n \n79. \nFinancial Governance. In accordance with tariff orders issued by UERC, GOU through \nUED  shall  ensure  that  PTCUL  and  UJVNL  maintain  the  following  financial  management \nobjectives from FY2006\u20132007:  \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\ndebt-service coverage ratio of not less than 1.2, and \naccounts receivable of no more than 2 months of billing. \n\n \n80. \nFinancial  Management.  Internal  controls  will  be  strengthened  to  be  consistent  with \ninternational  standards  by  setting  up  and  maintaining  independent  and  autonomous  internal \naudit  departments  in  the  implementing  agencies.  The  implementing  agencies  will  adopt \ncomputerized  accounting  and  management  information  systems,  including  online  billing  and \ncollection systems, where appropriate and practical, by the end of 2007. \n \nEnvironmental. GOU through UED will ensure that PTCUL and UJVNL will ensure that \n81. \nthe  proposed  investments  under  the  MFF  are  undertaken  and  that  all  subproject  facilities  are \noperated  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy 2002 (footnote 27), as amended from time to time. \nFor  each  subproject,  PTCUL  and  UJVNL  will  prepare  and  implement  the  necessary  IEE, \nenvironmental \nthe \nenvironmental assessment and review framework. For subprojects not defined prior to approval \nof  the  MFF,  the  environmental  categorization  and  assessment  procedures  defined  in  the \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  will  be  followed  as  part  of  subproject \nappraisal.  For  any  category  A  or  B  subprojects,  an  SEIA  or  IEE  will  be  prepared  and  made \navailable \nfollowing  ADB \nimplementation procedures for sector loans. PTCUL and UJVNL will monitor, audit, and report \nto ADB twice a year on the implementation of the EMPs for each subproject. UED will verify that \nall associated hydropower projects not financed by ADB will be constructed and commissioned \nin  compliance  with  the  laws  and  regulations  of  India  prior  to  connecting  such  facilities  to  the \nADB-supported transmission network.  \n \n82. \nSocial.  GOU  through  UED  will  ensure  that  PTCUL  and  UJVNL  will  ensure  that  all  land \nand rights-of-way required by the subprojects will be made available in a timely manner and that \n\nimpact  assessment,  and  EMP  (with  budget) \n\nin  advance  of  subproject  approval \n\nthe  public  120  days \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nto \n\n\fthe  provisions  of  the  resettlement  framework  and  any  necessary  resettlement  plans,  including \ncompensation  and  entitlements  for  affected  households  and  people,  will  be  implemented  in \nconformity  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government  and  GOU,  including  as \namended  from  time  to  time,  the  entitlement  benefits  as  listed  in  the  Government\u2019s  National \nPolicy  on  Resettlement  and  Rehabilitation,  published  in  February  2004,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement 1995, and the agreed resettlement framework and Resettlement Plan. \nPTCUL and UJVNL will ensure that people affected by each subproject are consulted and fairly \ncompensated in a timely manner on a replacement value basis in accordance with the related \nresettlement  plans  and  resettlement  framework,  such  that  their  living  standards  are  not \nadversely  affected.  PTCUL  and  UJVNL  will  submit  progress  and  completion  reports  on  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  as  part  of  the  quarterly  progress  reports  for  each  subproject. \nSimilarly, if necessary, an indigenous peoples development plan will be prepared in accordance \nwith the IPDF. PTCUL and UJVNL will engage independent external experts for monitoring and \ngrievance redress mechanisms to address any grievances of affected people on resettlement, \nenvironment, and other social issues. \n \nGOU  through  UED  will  ensure  that  contracts  under  each  Project  follow  all  applicable \n83. \nlabor laws of the Government and GOU and that these further include provisions to the effect \nthat  contractors  (i)  do  not  use  children  as  labor,  and  (ii)  follow  legally  mandated  provisions  of \nlabor  (including  equal  pay  for  equal  work),  health,  safety,  sanitation,  welfare  and  working \nconditions. The contracts will also include clauses for termination in case of any breach of these \nprovisions by contractors. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \n84. \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  ADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  provision  of  loans \nunder  the  multitranche  financing  facility  in  an  aggregate  principal  amount  not  exceeding \n$300,000,000  equivalent  to  India  for  the  Uttaranchal  Power  Sector  Investment  Program  from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the Framework Financing Agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n8 March 2006  \n\n23 \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n  \n\n \n\n 1. \n\nInvestment Program \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nContribute to economic \ndevelopment in \nUttaranchal and the \nnorthern region of India \nthrough expanded power \nsupply at competitive \nprices.  \n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks  \n\n \n\nData Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms  \n\n \nPolicy dialogue, project \nprogress reports, reports from \nstate utility companies and \nthe regulatory commission, \nand loan review missions  \n \nElectricity sales data from \nutilities; gross domestic \nproduct data broken down by \nresidential, commercial, and \nindustrial categories \n \n\nOutcome \nClean Energy \nDevelopment: \n(i)  expansion of the \n\nelectric power service \narea and \nimprovements in the \nreliability and quality of \nsupply; and \n\n \n \n(ii) promotion of energy \n\nefficiency by \nrenovating, \nmodernizing, and \nupgrading existing \nhydropower plants \n\n \nTransmission Expansion:  \nNew associated \nhydropower plants \nconnected to the state\u2019s \ngrid and the northern \nregion grid within 6 \nmonths of commissioning \n \n \n\n \n \n \nProject progress reports, \nreports from state utility \ncompanies and regulatory \ncommission \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAssumptions \n\u2022  Stable economic growth \n\u2022  Continued evolution of an \nenabling policy framework \nand regulations to facilitate \nthe commercialization of \nutility company operations  \nLevel playing field between \nstate-level utilities, central \npublic sector utilities, and \nindependent power \nproducers \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n Risks \n\u2022  Delays in power sector \n\n\u2022 \n\nreforms \nTariffs set below cost-\nrecovery levels \n\u2022  Generating capacity, \nincluding associated \nfacilities not financed by \nADB, not commissioned in \na timely manner  \n\u2022  Delays in transmission \nsystem construction \n\n \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\n \nRelative to a 2004 \nbaseline, increase in \ngross energy output of \n10% per year, sufficient to \nserve 600,000 people at \ncurrent consumption rates \n \nIncrease in in-state \nservice connections and \npower sales  \n \nYear-round, daily \nexportable surplus by \n2012 sufficient to serve \n12.0 million people at \ncurrent consumption rates \n \nState-level gross domestic \nproduct growth in \nUttaranchal and customer \nstates  \n \nPoverty reduction \nfacilitated through village \nand rural electrification \nprograms  \n \n \n \n \nProvision of sufficient \npower supplies to serve \nthe majority of the \nconsumers living below \nthe poverty line in the \ndistricts of Uttarkashi and \nRudraprayag \n \nProvision of incremental \npower supplies to serve \n151,000 consumers in the \nHaridwar service area \n \n \n \n \nEvacuation of 21,900 \ngigawatt-hours per year of \ngenerating capacity to the \nstate grid (5,000 MW \nrunning at 50% load \nfactor) by 201. \n \nMeet in-state demand and \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n25 \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nData Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms  \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNew tariff orders and \nresolution of challenges to \nexisting tariff orders \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAssumption \n\u2022  Government continues to \n\nsupport sector reforms and \nutility restructuring \n\nDesign \nSummary \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCapacity Building:  \nSector sustainability \nresulting from continued \nreforms and \nimprovements in \noperational efficiency \n \n\ncreate an exportable \nsurplus by 2010.

However,  several  constraints \nand issues impede such imports, namely: (i) the eastern region surplus depends on coal-fired \ngeneration, which is not favored by current national policy; (ii) the projected northeastern region \nsurplus  depends  on  large  hydropower  plants  (HPPs)  that  have  yet  to  be  constructed;  (iii) \ninterstate  transmission  capacity  must  be  expanded  to  eliminate  bottlenecks  at  the  \u201cchicken\u2019s \nneck\u201d in West Bengal; and (iv) overall transmission capacity must be constructed to wheel the \nexpected  surpluses  between  regions.1  Given  these  constraints,  the  projected  northern  region \ndeficit can readily be met by expanding Uttaranchal\u2019s hydropower capacity. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Load Generation Scenario, Early 11th Plan (2008\u20132009)  \n(megawatts) \nPeak \nDemand \n41,200 \n\n \nInstalled Capacity \n44,300 \n\nPeak \nAvailability \n33,200 \n\nSurplus/ \n(Deficit) \n\n (8,000) \n\n \nRegion \nNorthern \n\nWestern \n\nSouthern \n\nEastern \n\nNortheastern \n\n44,500 \n\n37,000 \n\n27,000 \n\n6,300 \n\n \n\n Total \n\n158,100 \n\n132,200 \n\n        Source:  Power Grid Corporation of India, Limited. \n\nB. \n\nPerformance of the Power Sector in Uttaranchal State \n\n41,000 \n\n35,000 \n\n13,500 \n\n1,500 \n\n \n\n33,000 \n\n31,000 \n\n24,000 \n\n4,500 \n\n124,700 \n\n(8,000) \n\n(4,000) \n\n10,500 \n\n3,000 \n\n(7,500) \n\n2. \nThe Uttaranchal power sector has shown strengths in terms of reducing cross-subsidies \nacross  customer  categories,  implementing  merit  order  dispatch  principles,  rationalizing  tariff \nslabs, and completing interface metering, weaknesses have overshadowed strengths especially \nin  terms  of  (i)  high  aggregate  technical  and  commercial  losses  (44%  in  2003-04);  and  (ii)  no \nsignificant capacity additions to date. The government of Uttaranchal is obligated to formulate a \nfinancial restructuring plan for securing financial restructuring support that is based on meeting \nloss reduction targets across the state.  \n \n3. \nUttaranchal\u2019s  separation  from  Uttar  Pradesh  provided  some  immediate  benefits  to  the \nstate, for example, segregating the state\u2019s grid operations translated into lower overall demand \non  the  Uttaranchal  grid,  and  thus  annual  aggregate  power  availability  effectively  increased \n(though  seasonal  shortages  still  occur).  A  key  positive  operational  parameter  has  been  the \nrecent  performance  of  Uttaranchal  Jal  Vidyut  Nigam,  Limited\u2019s  HPPs,  with  a  high  availability \nfactor and the ability to keep auxiliary consumption within normative levels. The financial risk of \nthe utilities was rated low: Uttaranchal Power Corporation, Limited (UPCL) has been regular in \nits debt servicing to lenders and earned cash profits in fiscal year (FY) 2001 and FY2002. For \nFY2003, the coverage of cash costs was high at 85%. However, collection efficiency is an area \nwith scope for improvement.2  \n                                                 \n1  The  Asian  Development  Bank  is  supporting  the  expansion  of  interstate  transmission  capacity  via  loans  to  the \n\nPowergrid Corporation of India, Limited. \n\n2   The  Uttaranchal  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  has  identified  universal  metering  in  the  three  principal  urban \n\nload centers as a priority for meeting revenue targets. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nGeneration Potential and Expansion Plans in Uttaranchal \n\nC. \n \n4. \nUttaranchal is currently a net importer of electric power, but generates a seasonal surplus \nand  plans  to  become  a  net  exporter  of  power  by  2010  by  expanding  its  hydropower  and  high-\nvoltage  transmission  capacity.  Total  capacity  expansion  of  10,000  megawatts  (MW)  is  planned \nthrough 2018. Currently 14 projects totaling 5,525 MW are under construction3 and expected to \nbe  commissioned  by  2010.  An  additional  4,791  MW  are  under  development,  with  expected \ncommissioning  dates  after  2010,  and  another  9,090  MW  are  planned.

PTCUL was formed by separating UPCL\u2019s transmission assets and undertakings \nand commenced operations on 1 June 2004. The major challenges facing PTCUL are building \nand  operating  a  network  to  cope  with  a  fourfold  increase  in  energy  transfers  within  its  first  10 \nyears  of  operation  and  building  the  human  resource  capacity  to  sustain  corporate  operations. \nThe proposed investment support from the Asian Development Bank will be critical to this goal. \n \n6. \nThe  integrated  transmission  system  for  Uttaranchal  is  intended  to  provide  for  the \nevacuation  of  new  HPP  capacity  in  the  state\u2019s  four  major  river  basins.  The  load  flow  studies \n                                                 \n3   This figure includes the Tehri and Koteshwar projects, totaling 2,400 MW, which will transmit power directly to the \n\nnorthern region grid in Uttar Pradesh. These HPPs are not included in the proposed Investment Program. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\nDistribution Operations \n\nused  to  develop  PTCUL\u2019s  transmission  system  have  been  prepared  by  the  Central  Electricity \nAuthority and assume that the beneficiary of the state\u2019s generation will be the northern region. \nThe  studies  have  estimated  requirements  needed  to  meet  peak  conditions  in  the  northern \nregion and therefore allow for the evacuation of electric power from the planned new generation \ncapacities.  \n \nE. \n \nUPCL is the sole distribution licensee in Uttaranchal. A key challenge is the high level of \n7. \naggregate  technical  and  commercial  losses,  which  increased  during  the  first  3  years  of  its \noperations.  However,  the  trend  has  been  reversing  in  FY2005.  Commercial  losses  increased \nfrom  Rs981.1  million  in  FY2002  to  Rs2,049.5  million  in  FY2003  with  transmission  and \ndistribution losses estimated at 35%. Nevertheless, UPCL\u2019s overall financial position during the \n3-year period ending FY2004 has been reasonably robust because of its high financial margins: \nUPCL  has  been  able  to  generate  and/or  purchase  power  an  average  rate  of  about  Re1  per \nkilowatt-hour while charging consumers at an average rate of Rs2.50 per kilowatt-hour. At the \nsame time, since the creation of the state and the establishment of state-level grid operations, \noverall  end-user  tariffs  have  decreased  (Table  A2.2),  load  shedding  has  decreased,  and \nconsumer  satisfaction  has  improved.  Pursuant  to  tariff  orders  issued  by  the  Uttaranchal \nElectricity  Regulatory  Commission,  UPCL  has  initiated  systematic  efforts  to  reduce  losses, \naddressing both technical and nontechnical losses.  \n\n \n \nCategory \n\nDomestic \nNondomestic (commercial) \nPrivate Tube Wells  \nIndustry \n\nAfter the Creation of the \nState Electric Regulatory \nCommission, FY2005  \n1.93 \n3.21 \n1.52 \n3.03 \n\n \nTable A2.2: Uttaranchal Tariffs by Consumer Category  \n(Rs/kilowatt-hour) \nBefore the Creation of the \nState Electric Regulatory \nCommission, FY2002   \n2.05 \n4.96 \n0.80 \n4.44 \n           Source: Uttaranchal Electricity Regulatory Commission \n \nF. \n \n8. \nUttaranchal  is  at  a  fairly  advanced  stage  of  sector  reforms  and  is  now  in  a  period  of \ngestation, absorbing the impacts of a newly regulated market. At least two factors bode well for \nfuture sustainability: (i) the state has a low proportion of agricultural consumers (which account \nfor less than 10% of overall electricity consumption), and (ii) the government of Uttaranchal has \nacknowledged that electricity is not a free good. The state-level policies and sector development \nplans  are  well  defined  and  the  utilities  are  initiating  new  management  and  human  resources \ndevelopment strategies. Given the large capital requirements for the sector expansion, external \nfinancing  is  appropriate.  The  state-level  road  map  for  the  power  sector  is  presented  in  Table \nA2.3.  The  generation  and  transmission  Investment  Program  is  presented  in  Table  A2.4,  with \nsubprojects proposed for ADB support highlighted. \n \n\nSector Sustainability and Road Map \n\n \n\n\f3\n2\n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n2\n \n\ni\n\n \n\nTable A2.3:  Power Sector Road Map \n\nPreparatory Phase: 1998\u20132004 \nLegislation and Regulation \n1995: Grid code established and notified.

As of mid-2004, UPCL was the sole \ndistribution licensee in the state.  \n \n9 November 2001: - Incorporation of UJVNL as the state-\nowned generating utility. \nGeneration Operations and Infrastructure \nUJVNL inherited 1,160 MW of hydropower capacity from \nUttar Pradesh. Current generation is within 5% of demand, \nwith seasonal surpluses (and banking and trading).  \n \nOperators other than UJVNL pay a 12% royalty in the form \nof free power to Uttaranchal for the use of rivers. UJVNL \ndelivers at least 85% of output to UPCL for in-state \nconsumption, with the excess traded at a premium open \nmarket tariff. Power sales outside the state are limited to \n15% until a year round surplus has been achieved.  \n \n\nIntermediate Phase: 2004\u20132012 \n\nAnticipated Regulatory Changes  \nThe 2003 Electricity Act may be amended periodically or superceded by new laws. \nAdditional enabling regulations to be drafted and implemented.  \n \nThe Uttaranchal Electricity Regulatory Commission is to appoint two additional \ncommission members in 2006, with fully independent regulation established by \n2007. \n \nNational Electric Policy 2005 \n100% village electrification to be achieved by 2008 and 100% household \nelectrification by 2012. \n \nRegulatory Principles \nTariffs set at the cost of supply with allowed Return on of 14%. Consumers\u2019 ability \nand willingness to pay is expected to be maintained as long as electric service \nimproves and will be enhanced by economic growth. \n \nRestructuring and Operational Implications  \nPTCUL established on 1 June 2004 as the operator of the state-level high-voltage \ntransmission system (132 kV and higher).  \n \nThe regulatory framework supports the commercialization of utility operations and \nprivate sector participation. Open recruitment of professional management for utility \ncompanies to be expanded to foster commercial operations.  \n\nCapacity Expansion \nKey developers are UJVNL, central public sector utilities, and independent power \nproducers. The latter are lead developers for 49 of 99 small hydropower plant \nprojects and several medium plants (larger than 25 MW). Fourteen HPPs totaling \n5,525 MW are under construction, with 1,284 MW to be commissioned in 2005 and \n723 MW in 2006. In-state demand is expected to be fully met by 2008, with \ncontinued seasonal surpluses. The exportable surplus is projected to increase from \n2010. \n \nInvestment Requirements \nMemoranda of understand and financing commitments are in place for new HPPs \ntotaling 2,000 MW to be commissioned by 2011.

The current system consists mainly of 66 \nkV lines, with limited new 220 kV lines to hydropower plants \nunder construction. \n \nDistribution Operations and Infrastructure \nThe separation of Uttaranchal\u2019s and Uttar Pradesh\u2019s grid \noperations resulted in reduced load shedding in Uttaranchal \nand improved consumer satisfaction. Uttaranchal\u2019s \naggregate technical and commercial losses and technical \nand distribution losses are above the national average: 46\u2013\n53% in 2003 and 29\u201333% in 2004.  \n \nInitial tariff orders (2003\u20132005) reduced overall retail tariffs \nexcept for a minor increase on private tube wells and \nimproved UPCL\u2019s operating margin. Ability and willingness \nto pay is demonstrated by the current tariff structure and is \nverified by economic analysis.  \n  \n \n \n \n\nmillion program for the RMU of existing HPPs with about 1,100 MW nominal \ncapacity that is expected to generate an additional 200 MW of output. New \nperformance contracts are being tested on smaller RMU candidates. Financing \ncommitments to be confirmed for an additional capacity expansion of 2,000 MW \nwith commissioning dates beyond 2011. \nCapacity Expansion  \nAn integrated generation and transmission expansion plan was approved in 2004 \nthat includes 785 km of 400 kV lines, 180 km of 220 kV lines, 665 km of 132 kV \nlines, 8 substations, and auxiliary equipment. The 66 kV lines are to be phased out. \n \nInvestment Requirements \n$450.0 million is required to evacuate power from more than 4,000 MW of new HPP \ncapacity by 2012. An additional $250 million is required through 2018.

\n\nAppendix 4 \n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CAPACITY BUILDING \n\n \n1. \nThe  government  of  Uttaranchal  (GOU)  has  taken  a  strong  leadership  position  on \neconomic  development,  with  power  system  expansion  and  tourism  development  identified  as \nthe  pillars  of  economic  growth.  Subsequent  to  policy  and  legislative  reforms,  the  Uttaranchal \npower  sector  is  rapidly  evolving  from  a  system  of  regulated  monopolies  toward  a  competitive \nmarket.  Achieving  the  policy  and  sector  objectives  by  2012  requires  a  rapid  upgrade  in \ninstitutional  capability  to  manage  change  as  well  as  simultaneously  manage  construction  of \nseveral  large-scale  power  infrastructure  projects.  GOU  and  the  state-owned  utilities  recognize \nthe  need  to  (i)  expand  its  knowledge  and  human  resource  base  to  accelerate  power  sector \ndevelopment,  (ii)  continue  corporate  restructuring  of  utility  companies,  (iii)  broaden  its \nprocurement  and  contracting  modalities,  and  (iv)  effectively  manage  externally  funded \ninvestments. The implementing agencies have a substantial endowment of human capital in the \nform of senior technical staff in the UED (UED) and the implementing agencies, but at the same \ntime,  the  capacity  to  implement  donor-funded  investments  is  limited.  The  state  has  had  little \nfinancial  support  from  external  donors,  which  has  been  limited  primarily  to  grant-funded \nto \ntechnical  assistance.  UED  had  some  experience  with  donor-funded  projects  prior \nUttaranchal\u2019s  separation  from  Uttar  Pradesh,  but  has  no  experience  with  implementing  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  loans.  Likewise,  two  of  the  implementing  agencies  (Power \nTransmission  Corporation  of  Uttaranchal,  Limited  [PTCUL]  and  Uttaranchal  Jal  Vidyut  Nigam, \nLimited [UJVNL]) are relatively new companies and have no experience with implementing ADB \nor other donor loans. The state has limited recent experience with large infrastructure projects, \nand  therefore  limited  adoption  of  state-of-the-art  technologies  in  design  and  execution.  Many \nsenior  technical  staff  are  nearing  retirement  age,  giving  rise  to  an  urgent  need  to  develop  the \nnext generation of managerial and technical staff, especially in the implementing agencies. On \nbalance, capacity building is needed in UED and the implementing agencies to sustain its power \nsector investment program, as well as to implement the proposed ADB-supported investments. \n \nPTCUL  and  UJVNL  are  at  an  early  stage  of  familiarization  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and \n2. \nprocedures.  Therefore  relevant  staff  need  to  be  designated  for  training  and  additional \nexperienced and qualified staff need to be recruited for implementation. The lack of capacity to \nabsorb and appropriately  manage the large amount of funds must also be addressed for both \ncompanies. The appropriate mechanism for efficient implementation is a well-functioning Project \nManagement  Office  (PMO).  The  structure  and  functions  of  the  proposed  PMO  are  at  an \nadvanced stage of definition and development and encompass the duties, responsibilities, lines \nof supervision, and limits of authority for all officers, managers, and other staff. Limits on staff \nrotation will ultimately be established to discourage excessive turnover and a deterioration of the \nPMO\u2019s effectiveness. Complementing the investment subprojects, capacity building will initially \ncover  program  implementation  support  and  corporate  development.1  Preliminary  indicative \nbudgets are shown in Appendix 5.  \n \nA. \n\nImplementation Support \n\n3. \nImplementation support includes (i) the consulting services required for the design and \nconstruction  of  transmission  lines,  substations,  small  hydropower  plants,  and  renovation, \nmonitoring,  and  upgrade;  (ii)  the  preparation  of  subproject  appraisal  reports  for  the  candidate \n(noncore)  subprojects;  (iii)  the  implementation  of  management  plans  for  environmental  and \nsocial  safeguards,  including  the  preparation  of  environmental  and  social  assessments  for \n\n                                                 \n1  Additional capacity building activities will be defined after completion of a policy analysis study, expected by March \n\n2006.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n39 \n\nsubprojects introduced after the approval of the multitranche financing facility (MFF); and (iv) the \nacquisition  and  installation  of  project-related  information  technology.

Progress  on  strengthening  corporate  governance  and  financial  management  is \nunder  way:  an  independent  audit  committee,  external  directors,  and  open  recruitment  of \nmanagers and other staff and other human resources policies are being actively undertaken. As \nthe  newer  organization,  PTCUL  is  still  in  the  early  stages  of  establishing  its  human  resource \nprocesses and management systems. Both companies are excessively reliant on deputed1 staff \nand  need  to  strengthen  their  human  resource  programs  and  finalize  their  long-term  staffing \nplans. Another issue common to both entities is the need to identify and value the assets that \nwere  allocated  to  the  companies  during  the  unbundling  process.  PTCUL  in  particular  was \nallocated  a  large  inventory  of  spare  parts  and  materials  and  accounts  receivable  of \nindeterminate value. The companies\u2019 sponsors need to accept some write-off of obsolete stock \nand uncollectible receivables so that financial reports can be finalized. \n \n2. \nThe  1956  Companies  Act,  the  Income  Tax  Act,  and  the  2003  Electricity  Act  govern \naccounting and reporting requirements for both companies. Financial reporting is conducted on \nan  accrual  basis,  with  financial  statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  standards \nissued each year by the Institute of Chartered Accountant of India. Proper accounting policies \nand  procedures  are  in  place  for  UJVNL  and  PTCUL,  but  reporting  is  slow  and  needs  to  be \nimproved,  for  example,  UJVNL\u2019s  latest  audited  financial  statements  are  for  FY2002.  Both \ncompanies  have  failed  to  meet  deadlines  for  regulatory  submissions.  The  adoption  of \ncomputerized  accounting  and  management  information  systems  under  the  MFF  would  help \novercome the current slow and inefficient flow of information.  \n \nInternal  auditors  for  both  UJVNL  and  PTCUL  report  to  their  respective  directors  of \n3. \nfinance,  which  reduces  the  internal  auditors\u2019  independence  and  threatens  the  integrity  and \ncreditability of their functions. A more independent and autonomous internal audit department is \nrecommended, with auditors reporting directly to their respective boards of directors rather than \nto the managers of the firms\u2019 finances. \n \n4. \nUJVNL  is  able  to  obtain  some  funding  from  various  state  and  central  government \nschemes,  for  example,  financing  under  the Accelerated  Generation  and  Supply  Program  and \nequity  infusions  from  the  state  government.  Given  its  large  capital  expenditure  plan  and  the \ncurrent  interest  in  hydropower,  UJVNL  could  conceivably  tap  private  sources  of  funds  to  help \nfinance  its  investment  program.  However,  vigilance  is  required  to  ensure  that  the  company\u2019s \ncapital  investments  are  technically  sound  and  commercially  viable.  In  some  cases,  technical \nand  financial  evaluations  are  outsourced  to  external  agencies  to  ensure  high  standards  of \ninvestment  evaluation.  To  strengthen  its  future  corporate  strategy  and  vision,  UJVNL  is  in  the \nprocess  of  finalizing  the  selection  of  external  consultants  to  help  develop  a  comprehensive \nbusiness plan and sound financial risk management policies and practices. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Deputed  staff  are  those  employees  \u201con  loan\u201d  from  other  organizations,  but  whose  salaries  are  paid  by  the  \n\n\u201cborrowing\u201d company. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n47 \n\n1. \n\n Financial Performance \n\nUttaranchal Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited  \n\nB. \n \n \n \nUJVNL was formed in 2001, shortly after the creation of the state of Uttaranchal. UJVNL \n5. \nwas  created  by  separating  the  assets  of  Uttar  Pradesh  Jal  Vidyut  Nigam,  Limited  based  on \nlocation.  As  a  result,  UJVNL  received  9  large  and  medium  hydropower  plants,  9  small \nhydropower plants, and 23 microhydro stations with total capacity of 1,130.00 megawatts (MW), \nof which 1,005MW are operated by UJVNL, 5MW by an independent power producer, and the \nbalance of 120MW by the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation, Limited. \n  \n6. \nUJVNL  is  in  the  process  of  initiating  a  range  of  new  projects  that  complement  the \ninvestments of the central public sector utilities by increasing its supply capacity from 1,130 MW \nto more than 3,000 MW. The new projects will enable UJVNL to meet local demand in the near \nterm and are expected to allow it to sell power outside the state and thereby improve returns, \nparticularly through the sale of peaking power capacity.2 The largest of the major projects (Pala \nManeri)  is  now  in  the  early  stages  of  implementation  and  will  provide  480  MW  from  2011. \nManeri  Bhali-II  (304  MW),  which  is  due  to  be  completed  in  2006,  will  generate  significant \nadditional  income  for  the  company.  The  other  large  hydroelectric  power  plants  in  the  program \nare scheduled to start construction over the next 2 to 3 years.  \n \n7. \nLarge  capital  investments  will  catalyze  and  sustain  long-term  economic  growth  in  the \nstate. The financial analysis indicates that the overall program is financially viable provided that \nUJVNL secures sufficient long-term funds to carry out the slated capital expansion program over \na short time span. However, UJVNL will need to carefully manage its expenditures and finances \nto  avoid  commitments  that  unduly  stretch  its  debt-service  capacity  and/or  test  the  regulator\u2019s \nwillingness to raise generation tariffs to a level that covers capital costs. The analysis assumes \nthat  the  Uttaranchal  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (UERC)  will  increase  tariffs  to  cost-\ncovering  levels  in  accordance  with  UERC  and  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission \nguidelines; that the overall investment program will be staggered; and that UJVNL will maintain \na  minimum  capability  for  projected  debt  service,  that  is,  a  debt-service  coverage  ratio  of  1.2. \nFigures  for  FY2001\u2013FY2004  are  based  on  actual  figures  provided  by  UJVNL,  whereas  the \nprojections  for  FY2005\u2013FY2012  are  based  on  assumptions  described  in  the  next  subsection. \nUJVNL\u2019s financial projections and past financial data are shown in Table A9.1.  \n \n \n \nDomestic  inflation  is  projected  using  domestic  cost  escalation  factors  for  2005\u201320093 \n8. \npublished  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  at  4.8%  per  year  from  2010  onward. \nInternational  inflation  forecasts  use  the  international  cost  escalation  factors  2005\u201320094 \npublished by the World Bank, and thereafter are assumed to increase at 2% per year.  \n \n9. \nThe growth of electricity sales is positively correlated with the availability of an integrated \ntransmission  network  connected  to  hydropower  stations  and  an  electricity  deficit  from  unmet \ndemand.  The  projected  sale  of  power  is  derived  from  energy  to  be  generated  from  UJVNL\u2019s \nplanned  capital  investments.  Additional  energy  to  be  generated  as  a  result  of  the  proposed \nInvestment  Program  consists  of  the  outputs  of  four  small  hydropower  plants  (SHPPs)  and  the \n                                                 \n2   The Ministry of Power allows 15% of generation capacity to be sold outside long-term power purchase agreements. \n3   India\u2019s  Consumer  Price  Index  is  estimated  at  4.2%  for  2005,  3.0%  for  2006,  3.5%  for  2007,  4.7%  for  2008,  and \n\nAssumptions \n\n2. \n\n4   The Manufacturer\u2019s Unit Value index is 3.0% for 2005, 2.8% for 2006, 1.9% for 2007, 1.9% for 2008, and 1.9% for \n\n6.4% for 2009. \n\n2009. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\noutput  following  the  renovation,  monitoring,  and  upgrade  of  two  existing  SHPPs  (Table  A9.1). \nGeneration tariff calculations were based on current UERC norms. The generation tariff for the \nprojected years for new projects were adjusted to cover capital costs (depreciation, interest, and \nreturn  on  equity),  with  an  allowable  return  on  equity  of  14%  according  to  UERC  regulations. \nUJVNL has three different tariff schemes for existing plants, new large hydropower plants, and \nnew SHPPs. Existing large and small hydropower plants have a flat tariff scheme of Rs0.37 per \nkilowatt-hour  (kWh)  and  Rs1.7  per  kWh,  respectively,  as  stipulated  in  UERC\u2019s  FY2004  tariff \norder, which UJVNL is currently challenging which will be resolved by a high court decision. For \nthe  purpose  of  assessing  UJVNL\u2019s  financial  viability,  weighted  average  generation  tariffs  were \ncalculated  based  on  UERC  regulations  and  were  assumed  to  increase  at  a  measurable  rate. \nInterstate surplus energy is expected to generate export income starting in FY2010 following the \ncommissioning of high-voltage transmission lines.  \n \n10. \nOperating expenses consist of repairs and maintenance, fuel costs, salaries and wages, \nadministrative costs, and depreciation. Starting from current levels of around 4% of gross fixed \nassets,  costs  for  the  repairs  and  maintenance  of  generation  assets  were  assumed  to  decline \nover  time  as  new  plants  come  into  operation.  Depreciation  was  calculated  on  a  straight-line \nbasis at 2%5 in line with the Companies Act. Supplementary Appendix B provides more detailed \nassumptions and projections.  \n \nC. \n\nPower Transmission Corporation of Uttaranchal, Limited  \n\n1. \n\n Financial Performance \n\n \n \nPTCUL is a company owned by the government of Uttaranchal that was formed to take \n11. \nover  and  operate  the  state\u2019s  transmission  and  dispatch  system.  The  company\u2019s  provisional \nfinancial statements for FY2004 which cover its first 9 months of operation, are currently being \nfinalized and audited. The main outstanding tasks are to complete the segregation of accounts \nand finalize the value of inventory and receivables. The company is conservatively set up with \nan  initial  debt  to  equity  ratio  of  31:69.  During  the  start-up  period,  PTCUL  has  been  able  to \nachieve a 22% operating margin, generate a profit of Rs51 million, and maintain ample liquidity \nwith a current ratio of 55. As PTCUL owns and operates Uttaranchal\u2019s high-voltage transmission \nnetwork  and  is  also  the  key  provider  of  wheeling  services  for  the  burgeoning  hydropower \ngeneration  industry,  its  financial  risks  are  relatively  low.  The  major  risks  are  inadequate  cost \nrecovery  from  investment  in  transmission  lines  that  may  not  be  fully  utilized  and  the  potential \nadverse impact of unfavorable tariff decisions by the regulator.  \n \n12. \nPTCUL\u2019s financial projections are presented in Table A9.2. The major assumptions are \ndetailed in the following subsection. The company\u2019s profitability is expected to grow in line with \nimprovements in the efficiency and effectiveness of its operational performance and to approach \nclose  to  the  14%  return  on  equity  ceiling  allowed  for  under  current  regulations  over  time.  The \ndevelopment of wheeling for the interstate transfers that will result from the Investment Program \nprovides  an  opportunity  for  the  state  regulator  to  allow  PTCUL  to  pass  on  costs  to  customers \nelsewhere  in  the  northern  region.  Funding  for  the  Investment  Program  is  significant  and  will \nenable PTCUL to undertake its planned investment and spread its debt-service obligations over \nthe medium to long term, consistent with the high capital costs and extended economic life of \nthe transmission network. As a result, projected financial performance indicators are favorable \nand show that PTCUL will have adequate debt-service coverage for the duration of the MFF. \n \n\n                                                 \n5    In  line  with  UERC  regulations,  UJVNL  uses  accelerated  depreciation  over  the  repayment  period  for  a  loan  and \n\nspreads the life of capital assets over the remaining years. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n49 \n\n2. \n\nAssumptions \n\n \n \n13. \nThe  projected  transmission  revenue  stream  is  derived  from  projected  energy  to  be \nwheeled  by  PTCUL.  The  tariff  is  a  one-part  uniform  (\u201cpostage  stamp\u201d)  charge  based  on  full \nrecovery  of  costs  incurred  in  delivering  energy  to  distributors.  The  \u201callowable\u201d  costs  are \nassumed to include the costs of transmission losses at up to 2.8% of gross energy entering the \ntransmission  grid  and  the  full  capital  costs  of  the  investment  program  funded  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank,  consisting  of  returns  of  capital  (depreciation)  and  on  capital  (interest  and \nreturn on equity) (Table A9.2). In line with UERC regulations, tariff realization is on a full cost-\nrecovery basis; however, the latest tariff order by UERC for FY2005\u20132006 did not allow recovery \nof the full cost of supply based on the inherited nature of the company\u2019s assets and liabilities. A \nwheeling charge of Rs0.10 per kWh was incorporated into the analysis, with a tariff level set on \nan  ad  hoc  basis  for  the  9  months  of  operation  in  FY2004\u20132005.  The  latest  wheeling  charge \napproved  by  UERC  for  FY2005\u20132006  is  Rs0.06  per  kWh,  which  is  reflected  in  the  financial \nprojections. The wheeling charges for the projected years were adjusted upward over 5 years to \nmeet  the  allowable  return  on  equity  of  14%  according  to  UERC  regulations  pertaining  to  new \ninvestments.  The  projections  assume  that  surplus  electricity  after  meeting  in-state  demand  is \nexported  to  the  northern  and  other  regions. As  such,  interstate  surplus  energy  is  expected  to \ngenerate  export  income  starting  in  FY2010\u20132011.  Prudent  levels  of  operating  costs  can  be \npassed through at actual costs in the tariff and include allowances for repairs and maintenance, \nsalaries  and  wages,  administrative  costs  (including  the  transmission  license  fee)  based  on \nactual  costs  in  FY2004\u20142005,  and  taxes  and  depreciation.  Repair  and  maintenance  of \ntransmission assets are estimated at 1.8% of gross fixed assets, while administrative costs and \nsalaries and wages increase in line with domestic inflation.  \n  \n14. \nPTCUL  is  in  the  process  of  finalizing  the  segregation  of  accounts  following  the \nunbundling  of  transmission  from  distribution.  This  process  is  due  to  be  completed  as  UERC\u2019s \ntariff  order  of  2005\u20132006  becomes  effective.

The  analysis  was \nconducted  over  the  period  from  FY2005\u20132006  to  FY2025\u20132026.  Capital  costs  were  derived \nfrom  local  sources,  which  include  physical  contingencies.  Price  contingencies  and  interest \nduring  construction  were  excluded  in  the  estimation  of  capital  costs.  The  investments  were \nevaluated  over  a  20-year  period  to  match  the  loan  repayment  cycle  of  20  years. The  salvage \nvalue of the proposed investments was calculated using a 2% straight-line depreciation method \nin line with Uttaranchal Electricity Regulatory Commission regulations during 2004. \n \nFinancial viability was examined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of with \n3. \nand without investment scenarios. The incremental costs and benefits of each subproject were \nderived  by  assessing  the  financial  position  of  the  relevant  company,  that  is,  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) costs and proposed wholesale generation and transmission tariffs. Capital \ninvestments  and  O&M  costs  were  identified  as  incremental  financial  costs  for  the  proposed \nInvestment  Program.  Incremental  financial  benefits  were  conservatively  limited  to  additional \nelectricity  to  be  generated  and  transmitted  as  a  result  of  the  Investment  Program.  Tariff \ncalculations  for  generation  and  transmission  were  based  on  Uttaranchal  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission  regulations  for  2004  on  terms  and  conditions  for  determining  generation  and \ntransmission tariffs, which permit the pass-through of full cost recovery of loan capital at a debt \nto  equity  ratio  of  70:30;  depreciation;  14%  return  on  equity;  O&M  expenses;  and  interest  on \nworking  capital  for  new  subprojects.  The  assumed  wholesale  generation  tariff  used  in  the \nfinancial analysis was Rs1.7 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) and the tariff for transmission was Rs0.14 \nper kWh.2 It was assumed that RMU investments would apply the same tariff principles as new \nprojects in relation to being allowed to recover costs. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nFor  estimating  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  it  is  assumed  that  the \nfinancing sources consist of the UED\u2019s equity contribution financed through retained earnings, \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital \n\n                                                 \n1    ADB.  2002.

However, for new projects, UERC \nallows  both  generation  and  transmission  companies  to  recover  annual  revenue  requirements  consisting  of  (i) \ninterest  on  loan  capital,  (ii)  depreciation,  (iii)  return  on  equity,  (iv)  O&M  expenses,  and  (v)  interest  on  working \ncapital.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n53 \n\ngovernment funding, and a combination of foreign and local currency loans. It is also assumed \nthat  the  foreign  exchange  premium  exactly  offsets  the  prevailing  foreign  inflation  rate.  These \nloans  are  expected  to  bear  different  nominal  interest  rates  as  provided  below  in  Table  A10.1. \nThe debt to equity ratio of 70:30 is maintained in calculating the WACC. The breakdown of the \ngovernment  contribution  and  internally  generated  funds  is  assumed  to  be  70:30.  The  cost  of \nequity  is  calculated  at  10%,  which  reflects  a  10-year  Indian  Government  bond  yield  as  a \nbenchmark, risk-free interest rate with a risk premium of 2.5%. The other assumptions include a \ndomestic inflation rate of 5.5% and a tax rate of 12%.

This  rate \ncompares favorably with the estimated value of the WACC of 4.36%, substantiating the financial \nviability of both core subprojects. Although not included in the FIRR calculation, the Investment \nProgram is expected to generate additional benefits from optimizing operational efficiency and \nfuel  savings.  The  FIRR  for  clean  energy  investments  is  conservative,  because  the  proposed \ntariff of Rs1.70/kwh is a \u201cfloor\u201d: when in-state demand is met, the power output can be traded in \nthe  Northern  Region  grid  at  a  premium  tariff,  typically  Rs2.5/kwh  or  higher.  As  a  year-round \ndaily  power  surplus  is  expected  by  the  year  2012,  the  subprojects  should  be  able  to  take \nadvantage of the higher open market tariff for most of the operating lifetime. Additional income \nfrom selling Clean Development Mechanism credits is estimated to increase the FIRR to 5.8%.  \n \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nTable A10.2: Clean Energy Development \nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n(Rs million) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nIncremental Cost \n\nIncremental Benefit \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nNet \n\nSHP \n\nYear \n\nCost \n\nRMU \n\nSales \n\nTotal \nCost \n\nGeneration (MWh) \nRMU \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n57 \n96 \n96 \n96 \n96 \n96 \n96 \n96 \n96 \n96 \n96 \n96 \n96 \n96 \n96 \n96 \n96 \n \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n67 \n309 \n309 \n309 \n309 \n309 \n309 \n309 \n309 \n309 \n309 \n309 \n309 \n309 \n309 \n309 \n309 \n5,007 \n\nSHP \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n213 \n213 \n213 \n213 \n213 \n213 \n213 \n213 \n213 \n213 \n213 \n213 \n213 \n213 \n213 \n213 \n \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n39,669 \n56,500 \n56,500 \n56,500 \n56,500 \n56,500 \n56,500 \n56,500 \n56,500 \n56,500 \n56,500 \n56,500 \n56,500 \n56,500 \n56,500 \n56,500 \n56,500 \n \n\n435 \n1,016 \n1,161 \n290 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n(2,032) \n871 \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n125,115 \n125,115 \n125,115 \n125,115 \n125,115 \n125,115 \n125,115 \n125,115 \n125,115 \n125,115 \n125,115 \n125,115 \n125,115 \n125,115 \n125,115 \n125,115 \n \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n39,669 \n181,614 \n181,614 \n181,614 \n181,614 \n181,614 \n181,614 \n181,614 \n181,614 \n181,614 \n181,614 \n181,614 \n181,614 \n181,614 \n181,614 \n181,614 \n181,614 \n \n\n435 \n1,016 \n1,161 \n313 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n(1,916) \n2,751 \n \n \n \n\nTotal \nBenefit  Benefit \n(435) \n(1,016) \n(1,161) \n(246) \n193 \n193 \n193 \n193 \n193 \n193 \n193 \n193 \n193 \n193 \n193 \n193 \n193 \n193 \n193 \n2,224 \n2,256 \n \n130 \n4.8% \n\nCapital  O&M \nCost \n0 \n0 \n0 \n23 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n116 \n1,881 \n \n \n \n\n \n2006\u20132007 \n2007\u20132008 \n2008\u20132009 \n2009\u20132010 \n2010\u20132011 \n2011\u20132012 \n2012\u20132013 \n2013\u20132014 \n2014\u20132015 \n2015\u20132016 \n2016\u20132017 \n2017\u20132018 \n2018\u20132019 \n2019\u20132020 \n2020-2021 \n2021\u20132022 \n2022\u20132023 \n2023\u20132024 \n2024\u20132025 \n2025\u20132026 \nTotal \n \n \n \nFIRR  =  Financial  Internal  Rate  of  Return,  MWh  =  megawatt-hour,  NPV  =  net  present  value,  O&M  =  operation  and \nmaintenance, RMU = renovation, modernization, and upgrade, SHP = small hydropower plant \nNote: 1.

All  the  risks  have  a \nnoticeable impact on the revenue stream of the Power Transmission Corporation of Uttaranchal, \nLimited. The risks associated with (ii) and (iii) are also relevant to UJVNL. However, in UJVNL\u2019s \ncase, the risks are somewhat higher given that 26 large, medium, and small hydropower are to \nbe  commissioned  within  10  years,  including  four  SHPPs  funded  by  the  Asian  Development \nBank.  The  total  capacity  is  expected  to  be  2,597  MW,  with  an  investment  amount  of \napproximately  Rs136  billion  ($3  billion)  in  UJVNL\u2019s  pipeline.  The  uncertainty  inherent  in \nidentifying  adequate  financing  sources  in  a  timely  manner  raises  concerns  about  financial \n\n                                                 \n1  Lohari  Nag  Pala  (520  megawatts  [MW]),  Tapovan  Vishnugad  (360MW),  and  Lata  Tapovan  (108MW)  \u2013  by  the \n\nNational Thermal Power Corporation and of Pala Maneri (416MW) by Uttaranchal Jal Vidyut Nigam, Limited. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nsustainability at an institutional level. UJVNL may need to justify its proposed capital investment \nprogram and adjust the time of the commissioning schedule to reflect a realistic timetable. \n \n7. \nA  separate  analysis  was  carried  out  for  the  appraised  subprojects  to  examine  the \nsensitivity of the FIRR and financial net present value to adverse changes in key variables. The \nvariables  considered  for  the  sensitivity  analyses  were  a  1-year  implementation  delay,  a  20% \nincrease  in  capital  costs,  a  20%  increase  in  O&M  costs,  and  a  20%  decrease  in  SHPP  and \nRMU tariffs (Table A10.4), and a 1-year implementation delay, a 20% increase in capital costs, \na  20%  increase  in  O&M  costs,  a  20%  decrease  in  wheeling  charges,  and  a  10%  decrease  in \nenergy  sales  for  transmission  components  (Table  A10.5).  The  sensitivity  analyses  for  the  two \nsubprojects indicate that both are resilient to an increase in O&M costs and relatively sensitive \nto increases in capital costs, tariffs, sales, and energy generation. \n \n\nTable A10.4 \nClean Energy Development  \nFinancial Results of Sensitivity Analyses \nFIRR (%) \n4.8 \n4.6 \n3.9 \n4.4 \n3.8 \n5.8 \n        CDM = Clean Development Mechanism, FIRR = Financial Internal Rate of Return, FNPV = financial    \n        net present value, O&M = operation and maintenance \n        Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nItem \nBase case \n1 year implementation delay \n20% increase in capital cost \n20% increase in O&M cost \n20% decrease in on tariff \nWith CDM revenue \n\nSwitching Value (%) \n \n \n5 \n11 \n(4) \n \n\nFNPV \n130 \n  82 \n(158) \n  15 \n(171) \n  423 \n\nTable A10.5 \nTransmission Expansion \nFinancial Results of Sensitivity Analyses \nFIRR (%) \n7.4 \n6.6 \n5.2 \n6.6 \n4.8 \n6.1 \n\nFNPV \n2,824 \n1,989 \n   933 \n2,085 \n   368 \n1,596 \n\nItem \nBase case \n1 year implementation delay \n20% increase in capital cost \n20% increase in O&M cost \n20% decrease in wheeling charges \n10% decrease in energy sales \n\nSwitching Value (%) \n \n \n30 \n76 \n(23) \n(23) \n\n        FIRR = Financial Internal Rate of Return, FNPV = financial net present value, O&M = operation  \n        and maintenance         \n        Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n\f \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n57 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nThe proposed investments to be funded by ADB are part of an integrated generation and \n1. \ntransmission expansion program within Uttaranchal, and an integral component of the National \nElectricity Plan prepared by the Central Electricity Authority using least-cost planning principles. \nThe  economic  analysis  confirms  that  the  Investment  Program  will  ease  chronic  supply \nshortages in the northern region and help meet projected growth in demand for electric power. \nDemand forecasts and cost-benefit projections were prepared and analyzed, which indicate that \nthe Investment Program is economically viable.  \n \nB.  \n\nDemand Forecasts \n\n2. \nThe  Central  Electricity  Authority  prepares  national  electricity  demand  forecasts.  The \nlatest available national forecast, the 16th electricity power survey, was carried out in 1999 and \ncovered  energy  demand  and  peak  load  requirements  up  to  2016\u20132017,  using  both  short-term \n(2006\u20132007)  and  long-term  (2016\u20132017)  forecasting  methods.  The  survey  was  based  on \nhistorical  data  from  1992/93  to  1997/98.  The  short-term  forecast  ranged  from  1998/99  to \n2006/07,  and  was  extended  to  2011/12  for  the  long\u2013term  forecast.  However,  actual  electricity \nconsumption for the past 6 years demonstrates the following:  \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nOverall electricity consumption overall was far below forecast levels.  \nGrowth  in  demand  for  1998\u20131999  to  2001\u20132002  was  extremely  low, \nrecovering somewhat in the next 2 years. \nConsumption  in  almost  every  sector,  including  the  domestic,  agriculture, \nindustrial, and commercial sectors, was below projections.  \n\n(iii) \n \n \nThe  National  Electricity  Plan  and  the  survey  load  forecasts  indicate  that  in  2006-2007, \n3. \nthe northern region\u2019s aggregate demand for and supply of energy will be in balance, but that a \n6.3%  capacity  deficit  will  occur  seasonally.  Furthermore,  by  the  time  the  transmission \nsubprojects  have  been  completed  (2011\u20132012),  there  will  be  a  slight  capacity  surplus  (0.8%). \nThese projections were reviewed in light of the unexpectedly low growth in demand during 2000 \nto  2005.  Time  series  and  regression  analyses  were  used  to  analyze  the  results  of  the  survey \nbased on gross domestic product (GDP) and electricity consumption from 1980\u20131981 to 2003\u2013\n2004.  A  forecast  up  to  2011\u20132012  was  then  prepared  using  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s)  forecast  of  real  GDP  growth.  The  revised  forecasts  based  on  projected  GDP  indicate \nthat  the  demand  forecasts  underlying  the  National  Electricity  Plan  are  sound  and  that  the \nproposed investments are justified on demand and supply considerations.  \n \nThe base case, \u201cwith project,\u201d demand and supply balance is illustrated in Figure A11.1. \n4. \nIn  the  with  project  scenario,  the  northern  region  develops  its  hydropower  resources.  Thermal \npithead power supply capacity of 3,130 megawatts from the eastern region helps meet demand.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \nFigure A11.1: Inter-Regional Power Flows (MW): 2011-12 \u201cWith Project\u201d \n\nAP = Andra Pradesh, Chttis = Chattisgarh, H.P = Himachal Pradesh, J & K = Jammu and Kashmir, \nMAH  =  Maharashtra,  MP  =  Madhya  Pradesh,  MW  =  megawatt,  NHPC  =  National  Hydropower \nDevelopment  Corporation,  NEEPCO  =  Northeast  Power  Company,  TN  =  Tamil  Nadu,  U.A.  = \nUttaranchal \n\n \n\n             Source: Draft National Electricity Plan 2005 Figure 9.2 \n\n \n\n5. \nIn the \u201cwithout project\u201d scenario, intensive hydropower development would not occur. In \nthis  case,  the  grid  extension  would  not  be  required,  because  the  purpose  of  the  proposed \ninvestment is to provide transmission from the new hydropower generating plants to the existing \ngrid. In the event of low hydropower development, the shortfall would be made up by increased \ncapacity from thermal power plants located in the Eastern and Western regions, supplemented \nby  peaking  capacity  from  gas  turbines  located  at  the  load  centers.

The planning approach and methodologies are \nas described in the draft plan. The material from the Central Electric Authority covers the overall \nsystem  planning  approach  for  India  and  is  supplemented  by  conclusions  from  ADB\u2019s \nindependent cost-benefit analysis.  \n \n\n2.  \n\nLeast-Cost Review \n\n \n7. \nGeneration Options. The cost-benefit analysis includes a comparison of the delivered \ncosts  of  hydropower  from  Uttaranchal  to  the  northern  region\u2019s  load  centers  with  the  delivered \ncost of thermal power supply from a mix of coal-fired power stations (base load) and gas-fired \npeaking  plants.  The  cost-benefit  analysis  indicates  that  hydropower  is  cheaper  than  the \nalternative thermal power option. \n \n8. \nTransmission  Options.  Although  in  theory  the  various  hydropower  developers  could \nbuild their own dedicated power evacuation facilities, few, if any, options for developing different \nlines  and  routes  are  available  because  of  topographical  and  environmental  constraints.  The \nintegrated Transmission Network Plan is therefore the only realistic routing option.  \n \n\n3. \n\nCost-Benefit Analysis \n\n \n9. \nResource Cost Saving. Comparison of the with and without project scenarios indicates \nthat the delivery of hydropower will partly displace more expensive thermal power and will partly \nserve induced demand  for incremental electricity. The resource cost savings are estimated as \nthe  difference  in  cost  between  hydropower  electricity,  priced  at  $0.053  per  kilowatt-hour  and \nthermal power electricity priced at $0.064 per kilowatt-hour for bulk deliveries at the load centers \nof the northern region.  \n \n10.  Willingness to Pay. The willingness of domestic consumers within the northern region \nto  pay  for  additional  energy  (incremental  consumption)  was  calculated  by  developing  a \nconsumer  demand  function.  The  form  of  the  demand  function  follows  ADB\u2019s  ERD  Technical \nNote  No.  3.1  For  other  categories  of  consumption,  the  average  tariff  for  each  category  of \nconsumer was taken as a proxy of consumers\u2019 willingness to pay. This approach is considered \nconservative given that tariffs, particularly for agriculture, are subsidized and priced well below \nalternative forms of energy supply. \n \nD. \n \n11. \nExcluding  a  consideration  of  environmental  benefits,  the  projected  economic  internal \nrate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  21%,  which  is  above  the  economic  cost  of  capital  criterion  of  12%.  A \npresent value of $136.0 million for the net benefit of the Investment Program was identified as \nwell.  The  economic  viability  was  justified  accordingly.  When  environmental  benefits  (global \ngreenhouse  gas  reductions)  are  taken  into  account,  the  EIRR  is  28%,  with  a  present  value  of \n$283.0 million. \n\nResults \n\n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank. 2002. Economics and Research Department Technical Note No. 3. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nA  series  of  sensitivity  studies  was  carried  out  by  taking  into  consideration  various  key \n12. \nfactors  that  could  have  significant  adverse  impacts  on  the  Investment  Program.  The  studies \nincluded  a  capital  cost  overrun  of  10%,  a  reduction  in  energy  sales  of  5%,  a  1-year  delay  in \nbenefits,  and  all  impacts  together.  The  results  showed  that  the  EIRRs  for  these  negative \nchanges were in the range of 10 to 19%, excluding the environmental benefits. The only factor \nthat brought the EIRR below the 12% criterion was a reduction in energy sales, which appears \nto be the least likely possibility given the unmet demand that exists in the Northern Region and \nmost  of  India.  When  the  environmental  benefits  were  included,  the  EIRR  was  at  least  21%. \nThus the economic viability of the Investment Program is considered robust. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nTable A11: Calculation on Economic Internal Rate of Return for Uttaranchal Power Sector Investment Program \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n2014 \n\n2035 \n\nNPV \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \nElectricity Generated by Hydropower \n  Energy Generated \n  Cost at Busbars \n  Energy Delivered \nProject: Transmission in Uttaranchal \n  Capital Cost \n  O&M Cost \nWheeling cost outside Uttaranchal \nTotal Supply Cost \nBenefits \n  Power Supply Benefit \n  Environmental Benefit \n  Total Benefit \n  Net Benefit \nGWh = gigawatt-hour, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: \n\n \n \nGWh \nMli. $ \nGWh \n \nMli. $ \nMli. $ \nMli. $ \nMli. $ \n \nMli. $ \nMli. $ \nMli. $ \nMli. $ \n\n \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n33.7 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n33.7 \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n(33.7) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n71.4 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n71.4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n80.5 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n80.5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n(71.4) \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n(80.5) \n\n18.3 \n7.1 \n0.0 \n25.5 \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n(25.5) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0\n\n0.0 \n\n9,206.8  \n396.7  \n8,698.4  \n\n9,206.8 \n396.7 \n8,698.4 \n\n9,206.8 \n396.7 \n8,698.4 \n\n9,206.8 \n396.7 \n8,698.4 \n\n9,206.8 \n396.7 \n8,698.4 \n\n45,891 \n\n1,977.4 \n\n43,357 \n\n0.0  \n7.1  \n24.5  \n428.4  \n\n488.0  \n0.0  \n488.0  \n59.6  \n\n0.0 \n7.1 \n24.5 \n428.4 \n\n488.0 \n0.0 \n488.0 \n59.6 \n\n0.0 \n7.1 \n24.5 \n428.4 \n\n488.0 \n0.0 \n488.0 \n59.6 \n\n0.0 \n7.1 \n24.5 \n428.4 \n\n488.0 \n0.0 \n488.0 \n59.6 \n\n0.0 \n7.1 \n24.5 \n428.4 \n\n488.0 \n0.0 \n488.0 \n59.6 \n\n156.0 \n40.1 \n122.3 \n2,295.8 \n\n2,432.2 \n0.0 \n2,432.2 \n136.4 \n\nInputs: \n\n  EIRR \n \n  Discount rate \n  Foreign exchange rate \n  Standard Conversion Factor \n  System loss inside Uttaranchal \n  System loss outside Uttaranchal \n  Hydropower generation cost \n  Wheeling charge out Uttaranchal \n  Thermal Delivered Cost \n  Willingness to pay  \n  Project output consumed at WTP \n  Weighted average benefit \n \n \n\n \n\n21% \n\n12% \n\n \n \n \n43  Rs/$ \n \n0.95 \n \n2.8% \n \n2.8% \n0.043   $/kWh \n0.003   $/kWh \n0.0637   $/kWh \n0.0520   $/kWh \n\n65% \n \n0.056   $/kWh \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n10% \n5% \n1 year \n\nVariable \n \n\nSensitivity Analysis of EIRR  Change in \nExcluding C02 Benefit \nBase Case \n(i) Capital Cost Overrun \n(ii) Energy Sales Reduction \n(iii) Implementation Delay \n(iv) Combination of (i), (ii), (iii) \n \n \nSensitivity Analysis of EIRR  Change in \nExcluding C02 Benefit \nBase Case \n(i) Capital Cost Overrun \n(ii) Energy Sales Reduction \n(iii) Implementation Delay \n(iv) Combination of (i), (ii), (iii) \n\nVariable \n \n\n10% \n5% \n1 year \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n21 \n19 \n13 \n18 \n10 \n \nEIRR \n(%) \n28 \n24 \n22 \n25 \n18 \n\nNPV  \n($ million) \n136.0 \n        117.0 \n         15.0 \n         99.0 \n       (29.0) \n \n\nNPV \n($ million) \n283.0 \n223.0 \n161.0 \n210.0 \n118.0 \n\n \n \nEIRR = Economic Internal Rate of Return, GWh = gigawatt-hour, kWh = kilowatt-hour, Mli. = million, NPV = net present value, WTP = willingness to pay \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n1\n \n\ni\n\n6\n1\n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nN/A  \n\n \n Yes \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis  \n\nSector identified as a National Priority in country \npoverty Partnership Agreement?  \n\nA. \nSector identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Analysis?  \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in India:  \nMajor interventions in the energy sector are designed to achieve economic progress through infrastructure development. \nBoth physical investment support and sector reform are necessary so that the benefits from economic growth will accrue \nto the poor. Improved transmission and cleaner and renewable hydropower will specifically benefit the poor because they \nare the most adversely affected by pollution and environmental degradation. \n \nThe Investment Program  will reduce system losses and improve frequency and voltage levels, leading to more efficient \nenergy  use  and  making  more  power  available  to  support  economic  growth.  By  expanding  generation  capacity  and  the \ntransmission  grid,  the  Investment  Program  is  expected  to  result  in  efficient  and  more  reliable  delivery  of  services  to \nconsumers,  particularly  benefiting  commercial,  residential,  and  agricultural  customers  in  the  region.  The  integrated \ngeneration and transmission expansion program  will fulfill all  in-state demand and  will eventually provide surplus power \nfor  export.  This  will  generate  new  income  for  the  state  government  that  will  be  devoted  to  economic  and  social \ndevelopment. \n \nPoor and vulnerable consumers, including hospitals, schools,  and other social utilities, who are often the hardest hit by \ninadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power quality, will benefit directly from the subprojects. Direct positive \neconomic and social benefits will result from the Investment Program. Power generated by small hydropower plants will \nbe  connected  to  the  local  grid  at  33  kilovolts,  which  will  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  goal  of  providing  affordable, \nuniversal electric service by 2012. Increasing power supplies to local grids will bring the benefits of electricity to remote \ncommunities,  including  better  health  care,  sanitation,  and  education;  greater  income-earning  opportunities;  and  higher \nliving standards. The renovation, modernization, and of existing hydropower plants will provide more reliable power to the \nexisting grid.  \n \nA  positive,  direct  impact  on  local  labor  is  expected  during  implementation  and  an  indirect  impact  will  be  due  to  the \nincreased income-earning opportunities generated by increased access to electricity. \n \nB. \nProposed Classification: General intervention \nTechnical  assistance  consultants  have  prepared  a  social  impact  assessment  and  a  poverty  impact  assessment.  A \nsocioeconomic survey was undertaken to provide a basis for the assessments.  \n \nUttaranchal is one of India\u2019s poorest states. The per capita net state domestic product was Rs13,000 in 2002, compared \nwith  the  national  average  of  Rs18,000.  A  recent  survey  noted  that  36%  of  rural  families  in  Uttaranchal  are  below  the \npoverty  line.  Poverty  is  unevenly  distributed  throughout  the  state,  with  pockets  of  extreme  poverty  in  the  interior  rural \nareas. A third of the population in Uttaranchal does not own land and lives in rented accommodations. Sharp differences \nare  apparent  between  districts.  Dehradun  and  Nainital  have  higher  than  average  per  capita  income,  while  Bageshwar, \nChamoli,  Pithoragarh,  and  Uttarkashi  have  lower  than  average  per  capita  income  and  are  considered  to  be  extremely \npoor.  The  incidence  of  poverty  ranges  from  18%  of  the  population  living  below  the  poverty  line  in  Haridwar  to  69%  in \nUttarkashi. The average below the poverty line population in rural areas of Garhwal division (seven districts), where most \nof the transmission subproject investments are located, is 46%, skewed upward by high figures in Uttarkashi, Tehri (57%), \nand  Chamoli  (52%).  About  one  third  of  the  population  in  rural  areas  in  the  other  hill  districts  is  below  the  poverty  line. \nAccording  to  the  government  of  Uttaranchal,  about  416,018  people  were  identified  as  living  below  the  poverty  line  in \n2002. Based on a total population of 8,489,349 according to the 2001 census and the percentage of people living below \nthe poverty line noted by the Planning Commission, the total number of people living below the poverty line is estimated \nat  292,800,  which  in  lower  than  the  figures  estimated  by  the  Uttaranchal  government  (and  is  higher  than  in  the \nneighboring state of Himachal Pradesh).  \n \nEmployment in Uttaranchal is mostly agriculture and forest based. According to statistical data, around 37% of the total \npopulation works, of which 27% have regular employment and 10% are part-time workers.  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  is  expected  to  create  new  full-time  employment  opportunities.  For  civil  works  on  small \nhydropower  plant  and  renovation,  monitoring,  and  upgrade  investments,  UJVNL  expects  to  hire  160  and  240  unskilled \nworkers, respectively, for a period of 3 years. For the civil works on transmission lines, about 650 unskilled local workers \nwill  be  hired  for  a  period  of  18  months.  Improved  power  supplies  will  induce  light  industrial  and  commercial  activity, \ncreating  employment  opportunities  and  improving  the  productivity  and  quality  of  outputs  in  the  manufacturing  and \nagriculture sectors.  \n\nPoverty Analysis                                    \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n63 \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nParticipation Process \n\nC. \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nStakeholder  analysis  has  been  undertaken.

The subprojects will require \nconstruction labor and will result in permanent employment \nfor the operation and maintenance of project facilities. \nFigures are provided in the main text. \n\n \nThe subprojects are unlikely to result in increased prices of \ngoods and services accessed by the poor. The \ninvestments will support the Government\u2019s goal of \naffordable power for all by 2012, which is considered a pro-\npoor initiative.

Based  on  the  Resettlement  Plan,  core \nsubprojects  for  clean  energy  development  will  require  24.06  hectares  (ha)  of  permanent  land \nacquisition (both private and public) and 179.21 ha of temporary land acquisition.2 Transmission \nexpansion  will  require  13.99  ha  of  permanent  land  acquisition  and  no  temporary  land \nacquisition.  Capacity  building  will  not  involve  any  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  Land \nacquisition and resettlement resulting from the core subprojects will affect 25 households on a \npermanent basis and 229 on a temporary basis. None of the components will cause any loss of \nstructures. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe  resettlement  framework  was  prepared  for  the  noncore  subprojects  as  required  by \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy3  for  sector  lending.  The  resettlement  framework \nidentifies the broad scope of the Investment Program and outlines the policy, procedures, and \ninstitutional  requirements  for  preparing  subsequent  subprojects  under  the  sector  loan.  The \nexecuting  agency  will  be  the  UED  (UED).  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  the  PTCUL  and \nUJVNL. The project management office (PMO), through project implementation units (PIUs), will \nbe responsible for preparing social analysis and resettlement plans for subprojects as outlined \nin  the  resettlement  framework.  The  draft  resettlement  plans  will  be  submitted  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  for  review  and  approval  prior  to  contract  award,  and  compensation \nwill  be  paid  to  all  affected  persons  prior  to  displacement,  or  in  any  case,  no  later  than  the \ncommencement of civil works. \n \nD. \n \n4. \nThe 1894 Land Acquisition Act (LAA), as amended in 1984, and the National Policy on \nResettlement  and  Rehabilitation  for  Project  Affected  Persons  provides  the  legal  framework  for \nland acquisition for public purposes in India. They enable state governments to acquire private \nland for public purposes and ensure that no one is deprived of land except as provided for under \nthe  act  and  the  policy.  The  resettlement  framework  is  based  on  both  Government  and  ADB \npolicy.  The  resettlement  framework  and  resettlement  procedural  guidelines  will  apply  to  all \n                                                 \n1   During project implementation, additional subprojects will be appraised by the Uttaranchal Energy Department and will \nbe  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  in  accordance  with  established  project  administration \nprocedures. \n\nResettlement Policy and Framework \n\n2  Of the 179 ha  temporarily acquired, lost agricultural income from an estimated 115 ha of agricultural land  will  be \ncompensated. The average household size in Uttaranchal is 5.29 people and the average land tenure is 0.5 ha. No \nland acquisition is expected for the renovation, monitoring, and upgrade. \n\n3   ADB. 1995.

The difference between the replacement value and the assessed value will be provided by the Project directly to \naffected persons in the form of a grant. The payment of compensation above assessed values has been confirmed by \nUED  and  is  consistent  with  similar  payments  made  by  the  Uttaranchal  government  for  the  Tehri  Dam  Project  and \npayments  made  in  Powergrid  projects.  The  main  responsibilities  of  the  district-level  resettlement  committees  will \nmonitor  implementation  and  ensure  the  valuation  of  replacement  costs.  Each  committee  will  consist  of  (i)  a  district \nmagistrate; (ii) a district land acquisition officer; (iii) a local revenue officer; (iv) a PMU resettlement specialist; (v) a \nPIU resettlement specialist; (vi) an elected village head; (vii) representatives of affected persons, including vulnerable \ngroups; and (viii) NGO representatives.

This  includes  prioritization  in  land-for-land  compensation  schemes;  provision  of \nadditional  allowances  for  house  reconstruction,  relocation,  and  income  losses;  specialized \ntraining; and prioritization for employment in project activities. \n \nC.  \n \nResettlement plans for non-core subprojects will be prepared in the following manner: (i) \n6. \nthe  PIU,  guided  by  the  PMO,  will  undertake  social  impact  assessment  surveys  for  identified \nsubprojects  based  on  preliminary  technical  designs;  (ii)  if  impacts  are  significant,5  full \nresettlement plans will be prepared for each subproject; (iii) if impacts are not significant, short \nResettlement  Plans  will  be  required  for  project  preparation;  and  iv)  resettlement  plans  will \ninclude  measures  to  ensure  that  women\u2019s  socioeconomic conditions, needs,  and priorities  are \nidentified  and  that  the  process  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  does  not  disadvantage \nwomen.6 The PIU, PMO, and consultants for project preparation and implementation will include \nsocial  specialists  familiar  with  ADB  policy  and  procedures  for  the  preparation  of  subproject \nresettlement  plans.  The  resettlement  plans  must  comply  with  this  agreed  resettlement \nframework.  The  resettlement  plans  for  core  subprojects  will  be  used  as  a  model  for  preparing \nand  implementing  noncore  subprojects.  The  draft  resettlement  plans  will  be  submitted  to  ADB \nfor  review  and  approval  prior  to  contract  award,  and  compensation  will  be  paid  to  all  affected \npersons prior to displacement, or in any case, no later than the commencement of civil works.7  \n \nD. \n \n7. \nFor  subproject  resettlement  plans,  the  PMO  will  have  overall  coordination,  planning, \nimplementation, and financing responsibilities. The PMO will set up an environment and social \ndepartment. The department will have a full-time resettlement specialist for the duration of the \nprojects under the MFF to head the department\u2019s Resettlement Unit who will ensure timely and \n                                                 \n5  Resettlement  is  significant  when  200  or  more  people  experience  major  impacts.  Major  impacts  are  defined  as \npeople being physically displaced from housing and/or losing 10% or more of their productive, income-generating \nassets. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements and Budget \n\n6  UED  and  the  implementing  agencies,  through  the  PMO  and  PIUs,  will  ensure  that  this  agreed  on  resettlement \nframework  is  closely  followed  during  the  preparation  of  resettlement  plans.  UED  and  the  implementing  agencies \nwill further ensure that resettlement budgets are delivered on time to the PMO, PIUs, and involved NGOs for timely \nimplementation of resettlement plans. \n\n7   PMO, through the PIUs, will set the cutoff date on the day of notice (LAA, Section 4). \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\neffective  implementation  and  supervision  of  resettlement  plans.  The  Resettlement  Unit\u2019s \nresettlement specialist and staff and the PIU\u2019s resettlement specialist and staff will be provided \nwith the necessary training. The PMO will coordinate the PIUs in activities related to subproject \nresettlement plans, and each PIU will have at least one full-time resettlement specialist for the \nduration of those activities with relevant skills, a background in social sciences, and experience \nwith  resettlement  issues.  The  PIU  resettlement  specialist  will  subsequently  be  engaged  on  a \npart-time  basis  for  follow-up  activities,  monitoring,  and  grievance  redress.  UED  and  the \nimplementing  agencies  will  ensure  that  key  institutions,  including  local  governments,  are \ninvolved in the implementation of resettlement plans. Moreover, in recognition of the complexity \nof resettlement in a sector project, experienced nongovernment organizations (NGOs) (with field \noffices)  will  be  hired  to  implement  resettlement  plans  with  clearly  defined  tasks,  including \ncommunity-based  social  development  programs.  Local-level  resettlement  committees  will  be \nformed to ensure that all stakeholders are represented\u2014especially affected persons; vulnerable \naffected  persons;  community-based  organizations,  NGOs,  and  other  civil  society  and  interest \ngroups;  local  governments;  village  leaders;  and  PIU  staff\u2014in  decision  making  and  the \nimplementation of resettlement plans.  \n \n8. \nDetailed  budget  estimates  for  resettlement  will  be  prepared  for  each  resettlement  plan \nby UED and the implementing agencies and will be included in the overall investment estimate.8 \nAll  land  acquisition  funds  will  be  provided  by  UED.  All  compensation,  relocation,  and \nrehabilitation  of  income  and  livelihoods  will  be  considered  as  an  integral  part  of  subproject \ncosts. Budgets shall also include provisions for engaging an external monitor. \n \nE. \n \n9. \nResettlement  plans  for  each  noncore  subproject  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  in \nclose  consultation  with  stakeholders,  particularly  affected  persons,  through  focus  group \ndiscussions, socioeconomic surveys, and stakeholder consultation meetings.9 The resettlement \nframework  will  be  made  available  in  the  local  language  for  focus  group  discussions  and \nstakeholder meetings at the village and community levels to ensure inputs from stakeholders. A \nresettlement  information  leaflet  containing  information  about  compensation  and  resettlement \noptions for noncore subprojects will be made available in the local language and distributed to \naffected persons. The PMO, through its Resettlement Unit and PIUs, will conduct consultations \nin  affected  villages  to  explain  the  noncore  subproject  resettlement  plans  in  coordination  with \nvillage  and  community  leaders.  Each  affected  person  will  be  given  information  about  specific \nentitlements. Disputes about entitlements can be forwarded to the PIU for action. Resettlement \nplans  will  be  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  web  site.  Information,  dissemination,  and  consultation  will \ncontinue  throughout  project  implementation.  The  resettlement  framework  and  resettlement \nplans for appraised subprojects have been disclosed to affected persons. \n \nA  grievance  redress  committee  will  be  formed  to  ensure  that  affected  persons\u2019 \n10. \ngrievances  are  addressed  and  to  facilitate  project  implementation.10  Grievance  redress \ncommittees  will  have  representatives  from  affected  persons,  particularly  vulnerable  affected \n\nConsultation, Disclosure, and Grievances \n\n                                                 \n8   The budget will include (i) detailed costs of land acquisition, relocation, and livelihood and income restoration and \nimprovement;  (ii)  source  of  funding;  (iii)  arrangements  for  approval;  and  (iv)  flow  of  funds  and  contingency \narrangements. \n\n9  Female-headed  households  will  be  handled  carefully.  The  NGO  will  hire  female  field  workers  for  information \ndissemination.  Focus  groups  and  personal  contacts  are  important  for  information  campaigns  for  female  affected \npersons. \n\n10  The  main  responsibilities  of  these  committees  are  to  (i)  provide  support  to  affected  persons  on  problems  arising \nfrom  land  and  property  acquisition;  (ii)  record  affected  persons\u2019  grievances,  categorize  and  prioritize  grievances, \nand  resolve  them  within  2  weeks;  (iii)  immediately  inform  the  PMO  of  serious  cases;  and  (iv)  report  to  affected \npersons on developments regarding their grievances and decisions of the committee and the PMO. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n69 \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation  \n\npersons;  local-level  implementing  agency  and  PIU  staff;  local  government;  respected  citizens; \nNGOs;  community-based  organizations,  and  local  civil  and  interest  groups.  The  grievance \nredress committee will meet every 2 weeks. Other than disputes about ownership rights under \nthe court of law, the grievance redress committee will review grievances involving resettlement \nbenefits, compensation, relocation, and other assistance. Detailed investigation, including field \ninvestigation  with  the  concerned  affected  persons,  will  be  undertaken.  Grievances  will  be \nredressed  within  2  weeks  from  the  date  a  complaint  is  lodged.  The  committees  will  operate \nthroughout the Project\u2019s life.  \n \nF. \n \n11. \nInternal  monitoring  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  Resettlement  Unit  through  the  PIUs \nand pertinent NGOs.11 Monitoring and evaluation reports documenting progress on resettlement \nand resettlement plan completion reports will be provided by the Resettlement Unit to ADB as \npart of quarterly progress reports. UED will engage an independent agency not associated with \nproject  implementation  to  undertake  external  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  external  agency, \nwhich  will  have  experience  with  resettlement  activities  and  be  familiar  with  Government  and \nADB  resettlement  policy,  will  be  engaged  with  ADB  concurrence  within  3  months  of  loan \neffectiveness.  The  agency  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  resettlement  plans  to  assess \nwhether  resettlement  goals  were  achieved  and  whether  livelihood  and  living  standards  were \nrestored.  The  agency  will  also  provide  recommendations.  External  monitoring  will  be  on  a \nquarterly  basis  and  impact  evaluation  will  be  on  a  sample  basis  during  midterm  and  project \ncompletion.12  \n \n\n                                                 \n11  The  internal  monitoring  of  the  Resettlement  Unit  will  include  (i)  administrative  monitoring;  (ii)  socioeconomic \nmonitoring;  and  (iii)  impact  evaluation,  that  is,  whether  incomes  have  been  restored  and/or  improved  and  the \nsituation of affected persons. \n\n12 Monitoring will also record affected persons\u2019 views about resettlement issues; affected persons\u2019 understanding of \nentitlement  policies,  options,  and  alternatives;  site  conditions;  compensation  valuation  and  disbursement; \ngrievance  redress  procedures;  and  staff  competencies.
