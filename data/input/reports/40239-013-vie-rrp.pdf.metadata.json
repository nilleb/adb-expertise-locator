Currently,  irrigators  within  the \ncommand  area  draw  water  from  the  Chu  and  Ma  rivers  through  one  large  and  many  small \nirrigation pumping stations. The completion of the Cua Dat multipurpose reservoir provides the \nopportunity to  convert  the  NCSMRIS from  an  energy-dependent  pumped  scheme  to  a  surface \ngravity  scheme,  reducing  energy  requirements  and  improving  the  reliability  of  irrigation \ndeliveries from the Cua Dat reservoir. The overall government investment program will develop \nnew  main  and  distribution  canals  and  rehabilitate  existing  irrigation  and  drainage  facilities, \nimprove institutional capacity for water management, and enhance operation and maintenance \n(O&M) for NCSMRIS. It will contribute to efforts to adapt to climate change by increasing food \nproduction in an area less exposed than the main river deltas to the potential impact of sea level \nrise and projected yield reductions due to increased frequency of flood and drought events. This \nproject \nrural \ninfrastructure\u2014one of the core areas of operations under ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.3 \n \n\nirrigation  and  water  management,  will  promote \n\ninvestment,  covering \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  transformation  from  a  net  importer  of  rice  to  one  of  the  world\u2019s  largest \nexporters  began  in  1991.  However,  population  growth  (currently  about  1.4%  per  year)  and \nimprovements  in  living  standards  are  causing  national  rice  consumption  to  increase  by  about \n2% per year. At current rice production levels, the present rice surplus of 4 million\u20135 million tons \nper  year\u2014which  is  now  exported\u2014will  be  absorbed  by  domestic  consumption  in  just  10\u201312 \nyears.  The  consequences  for  regional  food  security  will  be  considerable  unless  there  is  a \ncorresponding  increase  in  production.  The  proportion  of  the  national  gross  domestic  product \ncontributed by agriculture is declining, but economic growth requires continued increases in the \nproduction of food, fiber, and raw materials for other sectors.  \n \nPaddy is the dominant food crop, accounting for 82% of the irrigated area in Viet Nam in \n4. \n2009. However, the area of land under paddy cultivation has decreased in recent years due to \nurban  expansion,  diversification  into  aquaculture  and  other  crops,  and  economic  growth  in \nnonagriculture  sectors,  with  increasing  demands  on  available  water  resources.  While  the  net \navailable  land  for  agriculture  (especially  paddy)  is  limited  and  currently  declining,  the \ngovernment  wishes  to  enhance  the  productivity  of  existing  land  and  food  security  through \nimprovements to irrigation and drainage. The government consequently places a high priority on \nirrigation  modernization,  dam  safety,  and improved  water  resources  management. The  project \nwill address these issues at the local level, and will contribute to ADB\u2019s broader policy dialogue \ninitiatives in the water and food sectors (paras. 6 and 8). \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (Northern  Chu  and \n\nSouthern Ma Rivers Irrigation System, TA 7480-VIE, approved 18 December 2009, $800,000, TASF). \n\n3   ADB.  2008.  Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nOne  of \n\n \nthe  major  objectives  of  the  government\u2019s  draft  5-year  Socioeconomic \n5. \nDevelopment  Plan  (SEDP,  2011\u20132015)  is  to  accelerate  agricultural  and  rural  industrialization \nand  modernization  to  (i)  facilitate  large-scale  agricultural  commodity  production  relevant  to \nmarket  demand  and  the  ecological  conditions  of  individual  regions;  and  (ii) increase  food \nsecurity.  The  modernization  of  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  will  result  in  more  reliable, \nefficient,  and  equitable  water  services,  which  are  indispensable  foundations  for  agricultural \nmodernization. In its National Water Resources Strategy, the government has defined the main \nobjectives  for  the  water  sector  during  2006\u20132020  as  the  protection,  efficient  exploitation,  and \nsustainable  development  of  water  resources  on  the  basis  of  integrated  and  unified  water \nresources  management,  with  the  continuous  development  and  improvement  of  institutions, \noperations, and human resource capacity as priorities. 4 \n \nThe  Viet  Nam  Water  Sector  Review,  2009 5  lists  many  issues  facing  irrigation  (and \n6. \nparticularly  the  NCSMRIS),  including  the  need  to  (i)  balance  tradeoffs  between  the  economic \nefficiency  of  improving  existing  infrastructure  versus  expansion  of  new  irrigated  areas; \n(ii) rehabilitate  existing  infrastructure,  much  of  which  is  30\u201340  years  old  and  suffers  from \ninadequate  expenditure on O&M;  (iii)  achieve  sustainable financing for O&M  and  rehabilitation \nof  irrigation  facilities,  given  that  central  and  provincial  government  budgets  are  insufficient  for \nmajor  refurbishment  and  the  current  government  subsidy  for  irrigation  service  fees  limits  the \nability  of  irrigation  management  companies  (IMCs)  to  fully  cover  O&M;6 (iv)  improve  irrigation \nservice  coverage,  with  an  average  of  only  about  68%  of  irrigation  design  areas  currently \nserviced;  (v) manage  water  quality  and  reduce  nonpoint  source  pollution  from  fertilizers  and \npesticides,  which  pose  a  public  health  risk  in  many  areas;  and  (vi)  effectively  manage \nmultipurpose reservoirs for irrigation, hydropower, and water supply.7  \n \n7. \nLessons  learned  from  recent  ADB  and  other  development  partners\u2019  projects  in  the \nirrigation  subsector  indicate  that  a  comprehensive  approach  is  needed  to  achieve  full \ninvestment  potential,  including  interventions  to  (i)  build  the  capacity  of  key  agencies  and \nintroducing  participatory  irrigation  management;  (ii)  eliminate  physical  impediments  to  efficient \nsystem  operation;  and  (iii)  provide  support  for  project  management.  Although  the  irrigation \nservice fee subsidy aims to provide for IMC operations, additional resources must be raised by \nwater user associations to operate and maintain lower order canals and on-farm facilities. ADB \nis monitoring the effectiveness of the O&M policy under ongoing sector activities. \n \n8. \nThe SEDP sets out Viet Nam\u2019s goal of becoming an industrialized nation by 2020, with a \nfocus  on  poverty  alleviation  and  food  security.  Good  progress  has  been  made  in  reducing \npoverty  (which  fell  from  28.9%  in  2002  to  12.1%  in  2008),  but  the  northern  midland  and \nmountainous  region  (including  Thanh  Hoa  province)  remains  the  poorest  in  Viet  Nam,  with  a \npoverty level of 25.1% (2009). In Thanh Hoa province, 17.6% of the population lives below the \npoverty line. The SEDP envisages that by 2020, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries will account \nfor around 19% of gross domestic product, and 41% of total national employment. The Ministry \nof Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) 5-year plan for agriculture development  (2011\u2013\n2015) envisages a modernized and sustainable agriculture sector with a market orientation.  \n \n\n                                                \n4  Prime Minister decision 81/2006/QD-TTg, 14 April 2006. \n5  ADB.  2009.  Water  Sector  Review.  Consultant\u2019s  report.  Manila  (TA  4903-VIE,  cofinanced  by  the  governments  of \n\nAustralia, Denmark, and the Netherlands). \n\n6   In  January  2009,  the  government  introduced  an  irrigation  fee  subsidy  for  IMCs  under  which  water  users  groups \nenter into contracts with IMCs to provide irrigation services at a communal level; IMCs are paid the subsidy upon \ncertified delivery of the contracted services. (Decree 154, October 2007 and Decree 115, November 2008). \n\n7  Guidance in addressing these issues is given in ADB\u2019s Water Policy. \n\n\f9. \nADB\u2019s country program and the project are aligned with these poverty and food security \ninitiatives.  The  project  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  Viet  Nam  country  strategy  and  program.8   ADB\u2019s \nassessment,  strategy,  and  road  map  for  the  agriculture,  natural  resources  and  environment \nsector  promotes  (i) \nimproved  rural  productivity  and  (ii)  sustainable  natural  resources \nmanagement  and  climate  change  resilience,  especially  for  land  and  water.  ADB  plays  a  lead \nrole  among  development  partners  in  supporting  sustainable  water  resources  management \nthrough  financing  physical  infrastructure,  strengthening  government  capacity  and  coordinating \ninstitutional development initiatives for legislative and policy development. 9  \n \nThe existing irrigated area within the NCSMRIS command area is about 15,700 hectares \n10. \n(ha),  which  is  currently  served  by  about  160  pumped  irrigation  and  redistribution  schemes, \ndrawing water from the Chu and Ma rivers and smaller tributaries. The government\u2019s investment \nprogram will expand the irrigation area to a total command area of about 31,084 ha through the \nprovision of gravity irrigation water from the Cua Dat reservoir, rehabilitation of existing facilities, \nand  development  of  new  facilities.  The  government\u2019s  total  investment  program  is  divided  into \nthree phases:10 \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPhase  1  (financed  by  the  government).  Construction  of  the  main  canal  and \ncontrol  structures  (financed  through  the  issuance  of  government  bonds).  The \nmain  canal  is  required  to  conduct  irrigation  water  from  the  Cua  Dat  reservoir, \nfrom Doc Cay Dam to the junction of the north and south main canals (see Map). \nPhase 1 is currently under construction, with completion expected by mid-2015. \nPhase 2 (the proposed project to be financed by ADB and the government). \nConstruction  of  the  new  north  (34.5  km)  and  south  (23.5  km)  main  canals  and \ndevelopment  of  lower-order  canals  and  on-farm  facilities,  planned  for  physical \ncompletion by mid-2017. 11 \nPhase 3 (financing to be identified). Construction of the extension of the north \nmain  canal  (km  34.5\u2013km  47.3)  and  south  main  canal  (km  23.5\u2013km  46.5),  and \nrehabilitation  of  the  existing  Southern  Ma  pumped  irrigation  scheme  command \narea.  The  government  intends  to  finance  phase  3  from  internal  or  external \nresources  starting  in  about  2014.  ADB\u2019s  investment  is  not  contingent  on  the \nimplementation of phase 3. \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nB. \n \n11. \nThe  impact  will  be  improved  water  and  land  productivity  of  irrigated  cropping  systems \nwithin the NCSMRIS command area, situated in Thanh Hoa province. The outcome will be the \ndelivery of effective and timely irrigation services within NCSMRIS.   \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n8  ADB.  2009.

Phase A of \nthe project preparatory TA (footnote 2) confirmed the overall hydrologic feasibility of NCSMRISP \nbased on an irrigated command area of 31,084 ha, with an allowance for additional future water \ndemands.  Hydrological  assessment  of  the  Cua  Dat  reservoir  indicated  that  the  operating  plan \nprovides  adequate  water  for  irrigation  requirements  in  addition  to  other  demands,  and  the \nengineering  design  provides  adequate  capacity  to  cope  with  future  design  flows.  Construction \ncosts  were  considered  realistic  based  on  norms  for  Viet  Nam.  The  phase  A  feasibility  study \nreviewed the relatively high development cost of $7,200 per ha and considered various design \noptions  to  reduce  the  costs  and  resettlement  requirements,  but  no  significant  opportunities  for \ncost  savings  were  found.  No  serious  environmental  issues  were  identified.  Provisions  for  land \nacquisition, resettlement, and ethnic minorities were reviewed in relation to the guidelines of Viet \nNam and ADB. Overall, the NCSMRIS was assessed as technically and economically feasible. \n \nPhase  B  of  the  project  preparatory  TA  prepared  the  investment  project  and  included \n21. \nstudies  of  the  project  context  and  rationale,  description,  resources  and  outputs;  investment, \nfunding  structure  and  financing;  implementation  and  operational  management;  and  project \noutcomes  and  impacts.  Detailed  annexes  were  prepared  on  financial  and  economic  analysis, \nproject  administration,  poverty  reduction  and  social  issues,  gender,  resettlement,  ethnic \nminorities,  environment,  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  preparation  of  terms  of \nreference  for  consulting  studies.  In-depth  studies  were  conducted  to  review  the  engineering \ndesigns,  resettlement,  agricultural  potential,  institutional  setting,  financial  management  and \nprocurement capacity, which provided the basis of the investment proposal.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  main  benefits  will  be  to  agricultural  production  in  the  command  area,  and most  of \n22. \nthe benefits will accrue as increases in crop production arising from the conversion of rainfed to \nirrigated  areas,  or  from  improvements  in  output  in  existing  irrigated  areas  resulting  from \nimproved, more reliable water supply. The economic internal rate of return for the project (phase \n2)  is  estimated  at  22.4%. 16 At  a  12%  discount  rate,  the  net  present  value  is  $90.8 million \n(D1,902 billion). These results are robust across a range of sensitivity tests relating to changes \nin  project  cost  and  benefit  assumptions.  The  project  is  expected  to  lead  to  a  48%  increase  in \naverage  household  incomes  (from  $567  to  $838  per  annum)  in  lowland  districts  (i.e., the \ndistricts of Tho Xuan, Yen Dinh, and Thieu Hoa) and a 100% increase (from $360 to $722 per \nannum) for  households  in upland  districts (i.e.,  Ngoc  Lac, Thuong Xuan, and Cam Thuy). The \nincrease  in  average  upland  farm  income  will  be  greater  because  the  proportion  of  cultivated \nland that is rainfed (not irrigated) on upland farms is greater than that on lowland farms. \n \nC. \n \nThe  project  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with current  Viet  Nam  and  ADB  policies \n23. \nwith  respect  to  financial  management,  anticorruption  and  procurement.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nGovernance  \n\n                                                \n16  Economic  Analysis  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  The  economic  analysis  is \nundertaken in fourth quarter of 2011 constant prices. The exchange rate used is D20,953 = $1 (the rate as of the \nend of October 2011) and the discount rate for calculating the net present value is 12%. A project life of 25 years is \nadopted. The analysis uses the domestic price numeraire and for traded goods a shadow exchange factor of 1.1 is \napplied. Economic prices exclude taxes and a shadow wage rate factor of 0.85 has been applied to unskilled wage \nrates to reflect the relative abundance of unskilled labor in the project area. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nPoverty and Social18 \n\nPolicy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and \nMARD. Specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the project \nadministration manual.17 \n \nD. \n \n24. \nBeneficiaries. The  project covers 41 communes in six districts of Thanh Hoa province, \nin  which  78%\u201394%  of  the  population  is  involved  in  agricultural  production.  The  project  is \nexpected  to  benefit  approximately  119,495  households  (466,000  people)  through  improved \nirrigation facilities and water supplies. The total cultivated area served by project is 23,899 ha, \nwith  an  average  of  0.2  ha  of  cultivated  land  per  household.  Of  this,  15,758  ha  (66%)  is  fully \nirrigated and 8,141 ha (34%) rainfed or partially irrigated. With the project, 100% of the project \narea will be fully irrigated and all households will benefit.  \n \n25. \nPoverty.  The  SEDP  sets  out  Viet  Nam\u2019s  goal  of  becoming  an  industrialized  nation  by \n2020,  highlighting  the  need for  an  increased focus on  agricultural  production,  water  resources \nmanagement,  food  security  and  poverty  reduction.  It  highlights  poverty  alleviation  as  an \nunderlying  condition  for  achieving  these  goals,  projecting  the  percentage  of  the  population \ndependent on agriculture to decline from 85% to 50%. Poverty levels within the NCSMRIS area \nrange from a low of 11.7% to 45.9% in remote communities, with 41,427 poor households within \nthe  six  districts  covered  by  the  project.  Poverty  differs  significantly  between  urban  and  rural \nareas and between lowland rural areas and the hillier, upland districts. In lowland districts 13.9% \nof the population lives below the poverty line, and in upland districts 33.3%. In the project area, \n18.6%  of  households  are  poor  (weighted  average  based  on  the  relative  proportions  of  the \nproject area in lowland and upland districts). \n \n26. \n(effective  gender \nmainstreaming). A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared to promote the involvement of \nwomen  in  the  project,  and  ensure  they  derive  equal  benefits.  It  includes  specific  actions  to \npromote  the  participation  of  women  in  project  management,  training,  decision-making \nprocesses,  construction,  and  representation  in  WUAs  and  WUGs.  Specific  gender-related \ntargets  include  (i)  women  shall  make  up  at  least  40%  of  WUG  and  WUA  representatives, \ntrainees  in  project  technical  training  courses,  and  participants  in  non-agricultural,  occupational \ntraining;  (ii)  at  least  30%  of  CPO  and  PPMU  staff  shall  be  women;  and  (iii) gender-sensitive \ntraining shall  be  conducted for  all  staff. The results  of the GAP  will  monitored and reported  to \nADB quarterly until project completion, based on sex-disaggregated data. The estimated cost of \nthe GAP  is  included  in  the  project financing. The GAP  is  in  line  with  the government\u2019s gender \nequality law and ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998).19  \n \nE. \n \n27.  While ADB will only finance phase 2 of the NCSMRIS development, the government has \nagreed to adopt the provisions of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for all three phases \nof  the  investment  program.  The  project  itself  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. Full documentation is available on ADB\u2019s website.20 \n \n\nGender.

The  project  has  been  classified  as  category  A  with  respect  to \nresettlement.  The  government  has  prepared  (i)  a  resettlement  framework  for  the  entire \nNCSMRIS  investment,  (ii)  a  resettlement  plan  for  the  government-financed  main  canal,  and              \n(iii)  a  resettlement  plan  for  the  north  and  south  main  canal  construction,  which  have  been \napproved  by  government,  endorsed  by  ADB  and  posted  on  the  ADB  website.  Loan-financed \nconsultants will prepare resettlement plans for the remaining works (such as lower-order canals) \nin  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework  upon  completion  of  detailed  designs.  ADB  will \nfinance  resettlement  allowances  for  the  project, and the government  has  agreed to finance all \nremaining  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs.  District-level  resettlement  units  have  been \nestablished by the provincial people\u2019s committee to undertake resettlement work, as described \nin the resettlement framework. The project will engage an independent resettlement monitor. A \ndue diligence study of resettlement activities on the main canal (initiated in December 2010) has \nbeen prepared and the government has agreed with the corrective action plan.21 \n \n29. \nUnder the NCSMRIS investment program, a total of approximately 5,218 households will \nbe  affected  as  a  result  of  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  associated  with  construction  of  the \nmain,  north  main,  south  main,  and  lower-order  canals,  based  on  social  surveys  and  initial \nengineering  designs.  Of  these,  1,343  households  are  considered  vulnerable  (about  381  are \nheaded by women), and 3,043 households are considered severely affected, losing more than \n10% of their total landholding, and 439 are ethnic minority households.22 \n \n30.  Within  the  project  area  (phase  2  of  the  NCSMRIS  investment  program),  approximately \n3,856  households  will  be  affected,  including  945  vulnerable  and  2,426  severely  affected \nhouseholds. \n \n31. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  has  been  classified  as  category  A  with  respect  to \nindigenous  peoples.  The  project  directly  and  indirectly  affects  the  customary  rights  of  use, \naccess  to  land  and  natural  resources,  and  livelihood  systems  of  ethnic  people  in  project \ncommunes.  Of the  119,495  households  benefited  by  the project,  11,448  households  comprise \nThai  and  Muong  ethnic  minorities.  There  is  broad  ethnic  minority  community  support  for  the \nproject, as documented in meetings with communities during project preparation. An indigenous \npeoples plan (locally termed an ethnic peoples\u2019 development plan) has been prepared covering \nthe entire NCSMRIS investment program to address ethnic minority impacts of the investment.23 \n \n32. \nEnvironment.  The  project  has  been  classified  as  category  B  with  respect  to  the \nenvironment.  The  government  has  prepared  an  environmental  impact  assessment  for  the \nNCSMRIS investment program in accordance with its national guidelines,24 which was approved \nby MARD in June 2010. An initial environmental examination has been prepared in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  guidelines,  based  on  the  environmental  impact  assessment. 25  Principal  issues \nidentified  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  were  the  scale  of  land  acquisition  and \ndisplacement  of  affected  households  for  main  canal  infrastructure,  and  the  need  to  relocate \nabout 157 graves. Inter-commune and district roads will be severed, requiring new bridges, and \nsome 46 ha of forest land will cleared and an equivalent area of forest will be established within \nthe vicinity. During construction, air and water pollution, soil erosion, and traffic congestion will \n\n                                                \n21  Resettlement Framework; Resettlement Plans; Due Diligence Report (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\nin Appendix 2).  \n\n22  Of these ethnic minority households, 71 are poor households, comprising about 1,466 persons of Thai and Muong \n\nethnicity within 12 communes of four districts. \n\n23  Indigenous Peoples Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment.  2008.
