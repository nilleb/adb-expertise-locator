It \nhas an area of 557,000 square kilometers (km2) and a \npopulation  of  62  million  people.  A  highly  productive \nagricultural  and  mineral-rich  region  despite  its  harsh \nwinters, it is also highly urbanized. Cities and rural areas \nalike on the sweeping floodplains are highly susceptible to \nmajor floods and face the risk of massive property damage \nand  loss  of  life.  The  Project  will  reduce  flood  damage \nthrough integrated river basin management and improved \nflood protection. Key features include a flood management \nsystem  to  modernize  flood  forecasting,  early  warning, \nland-use planning and zoning; and flood control works to \nincrease  the  height  of  and  strengthen  existing  dikes, \nconstruct  new  ones,  and  rehabilitate  and  upgrade \nreservoirs  for  wetland  management  and  water  storage. \nThe Songliao Water Resources Commission (SWRC) and \ninvolved  agencies  will  also  be  strengthened  and  their \nproject management capacity upgraded. \n     \nClassification     Environmental Protection \nOther: Economic Growth \n     \nEnvironmental Assessment    Category B \n    An initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken \nfor core subprojects, and a summary IEE was circulated to \nthe Board on 17 August 2001. The IEE concludes that the \nenvironmental  impacts  are  primarily  positive  and  that \nnegative impacts arising from construction and operation \nof project facilities can be mitigated to acceptable levels by \nimplementing appropriate measures adopted in the project \ndesign. \n     \nRationale    Floods have produced some of the PRC\u2019s worst natural \ndisasters over thousands of years, and many flood control \ndikes and other works date from ancient times. Despite \nsignificant  construction  in  the  modern  era,  many  older \nworks fail during major floods, and system maintenance \nhas been inadequate. Flood protection standards are only \nthe  equivalent  of  about  a  20-year  flood  recurrence, \nwhereas the Government\u2019s design standard for important \ncities is to protect against a 100-200 year flood. In rural \nareas the design standard is 35-50 years. The PRC has \nalso  built  a  vast  network  of  dams  and  reservoirs  for \nirrigation, water supply, and flood control. Many parts of \nthe  network  require  remedial  work  to  ensure  their \ncontinued functioning and safety. An increasing population ", "  iii\nand  expansion  into  flood-prone  areas  have  significantly \nincreased  the  risk  of  economic  damage  by  flooding. \nAcknowledging  this  increased  risk,  the  Government \nsupports  a  shift  in  focus  from  flood  control  only  to  an \napproach  that  emphasizes  flood  management  through \nintegrated land and water resources management, optimal \nwater  management  throughout  river  basins,  flood \nprotection measures, and complementary flood forecasting \nand warning systems. The poor and vulnerable suffer most \nfrom floods. Improving institutional capacity to adopt an \nintegrated approach is a vital concern of the Government.  \n \nThe north and northeast of the country are important grain-\ngrowing areas with concentrations of heavy industry and \nagroprocessing in the Songhua River basin. One of the \ncountry\u2019s major river systems, the Songhua River features \nmajor wetland areas of international significance. It is also \nwhere major cities such as Harbin and Changchun, and \nthe PRC\u2019s largest oil fields are located. The worst flood for \nover 200 years hit the region in 1998, threatening Harbin, \nseverely affecting other urban and rural areas, inflicting \nloss  of  life  and  damage  equivalent  to  $7.3  billion,  and \nsignificantly raising the poverty level. Modern nonstructural \nflood  control  measures,  including  flood  forecasting  and \nearly warning systems, are urgently needed to assist in \ndeveloping  an  integrated  approach  to  sustainable  flood \nmanagement. Dikes need major repair and maintenance at \nvulnerable points along the Songhua, Nen, and related \nrivers,  including  works  to  protect  the  cities.  The  dikes \naround flood detention basins and water storage reservoirs \nmust  be  strengthened  to  reduce  the  risk  of  failure. \nImproved  management  of  wetland  areas  whose  natural \nfunction is to absorb floodwaters and maintain wildlife is \nalso  needed.  Institutional  strengthening,  especially  of \nSWRC, is a priority for a basinwide approach to water \nmanagement. \n     \nObjective and Scope    The Project aims to reduce flood damage in the Songhua \nRiver  basin  through  integrated  river  basin  management \nand improved flood protection. The Project comprises (i) \nimplementing a flood management system (incorporating \nflood  forecasting  and  early  warning  systems);  (ii)  flood \ncontrol  works  comprising  upgrading  dikes  and  building \nnew ones, and rehabilitating existing reservoirs to improve \nwetland  management  and  water  storage;  and  (iii) \nsupporting project management and institutional capacity. \n     \nCost Estimates    The total cost of the Project is estimated at $357.7 million \nequivalent, comprising $134 million of foreign exchange \nand $223.7 million equivalent of local currency costs. The \nGovernment has requested a loan of $150 million from the ", "  iv\nAsian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  finance  $134  million  of  foreign  exchange \ncosts and $16 million equivalent of local currency costs. \nLocal cost financing from ADB targets poor rural sites in \nremote areas. \nFinancing Plan    ($ million)\n \nForeign Local Total\n \nSource Exchange Currency Cost\n \n \nAsian Development Bank 134.0    16.0 150.0\n  Central Government     0.0    10.5   10.5\n  Provincial/Regional\n     Governments     0.0      8.7    8.7\n  Local Governments/\n   Communities     0.0  188.5 188.5\n      Total 134.0  223.7 357.7\nPercentage        37.5        62.5     100.0\n \nLoan Amount and Terms    A  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital \nresources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per \nannum, a front-end fee of 1.0 percent, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements. \n     \nPeriod of Utilization    Until 31 December 2007 \n     \nExecuting Agency    The  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  (MWR)  and  the \nprovinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin, and the Autonomous \nRegion of Inner Mongolia will be the Executing Agencies. \nMWR  will  entrust  project  coordination  and  technical \nsupport,  and  implementation  of  the  nonstructural \ncomponents to SWRC, which is under the administrative \ncontrol of the ministry. \n     \nProcurement    All civil works, equipment, and materials will be procured in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Major \ncontracts  for  equipment  and  materials  will  be  tendered \nthrough international competitive bidding or international \nshopping (IS) procedures. Civil works contracts up to $5 \nmillion equivalent will be awarded under local competitive \nbidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Force  account \nprocedures will be selectively used, especially in isolated \nlocations. IS procedures will be used to procure vehicles \nand  equipment.  Advance  action  for  procurement  of \nequipment and vehicles and  civil works for three core \nsubprojects,  the  central  project  coordination  office  in ", "  v\nSWRC,  and  the  three  project  management  offices  in \nHeilongjiang  and  Jilin  provinces,  and  the  Autonomous \nRegion of Inner Mongolia, has been approved. \n     \nConsulting Services    The Project will require 80 person-months of international \nand 608 person-months of domestic consulting services \nfor  the  engineering  study,  project  management, \nenvironmental  protection,  and  social  development.  The \ninternational consultants will be selected and engaged in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor selecting and engaging domestic consultants.  \n     \nEstimated Project    30 June 2007 \nCompletion Date   \n   \nProject Benefits and    Benefits  have  been  assessed  based  on  flood  damage \nBeneficiaries  avoidance  due  to  the  subproject  investments.  Potential \ndamage includes losses in fixed assets (crops, agriculture \nland,  homes,  public  infrastructure,  and  industrial \nequipment  and  facilities);  temporary  disruptions  of \nagricultural and industrial production; costs of emergency \nevacuation; repair of flood control structures; and stunted \ninvestment and economic growth due to prevailing flood \nrisk. Preliminary estimates of the economic internal rates \nof return (EIRRs) for the core subprojects are 13.4, 26.7, \nand  13.6  percent  for  Du\u2019erbenxin  dike,  Qunli  dike,  and \nXianghai  reservoir,  respectively.  Similar  EIRRs  are \nexpected  for  the  other  candidate  subprojects  to  be \nincluded in the Project. These estimates are robust, given \nthe relatively limited scope of benefits accounted for in the \neconomic evaluation. \n \nDuring implementation, the Project will generate incomes \nfor the floodplain communities, including the poor, from \nlabor-intensive  construction  of  dikes  and  reservoirs. \nPreliminary  estimates  indicate  that  approximately  5.3 \nmillion  person-days  of  manual  employment  will  be \ngenerated,  providing  employment  for  about  45,000 \nunskilled  laborers  over  the  next  four  years.  About  1.1 \nmillion  person-days  will  be  required  at  the  three  core \nsubproject  sites  in  the  next  two  years  and  this  will  be \nexpected to provide 20-150 days of employment for each \nof about 8,000 unskilled laborers. Based on the estimated \npoverty incidence at the subproject sites and with priority \nto the poor in jobs at those sites, about 50 percent of \nemployment  estimated  to  be  worth  about  Y460  million \n($55.6  million)  in  wages  will  be  directed  to  poor \nhouseholds. After the construction period, jobs will also be \navailable  for  maintaining  the  new  and  rehabilitated \ninfrastructure, the cost of which is estimated at 1 percent ", "  vi\nof the construction cost or about Y8 million ($0.96 million) \nper year. Given the labor content of maintenance work, \nthis is likely to provide work of about 10,000 person-days \nper  year.  Although  project  activities  are  not  aimed  at \nincome  generation,  the  extra  incomes  earned  from \nconstruction work will give households the opportunity to \nbuild  savings  to  improve  farming  conditions,  finance \nincome-generating activities, and reduce the risk of falling \nback into poverty. \n ", " ", " ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed \nloan to the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Songhua River Flood Management Sector \nProject. \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n \n2.   The Songhua River basin is the third largest river basin in the PRC after those of the \nYangtze and Yellow rivers. Located in the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia, and Jilin and \nHeilongjiang  provinces,  the  river  valley  has  large  cities  such  as  Harbin,  Changchun,  and \nQiqihar; automobile and chemical manufacturing; the country\u2019s largest oil fields; and massive \nmineral reserves. This productive agricultural region is susceptible to major floods. In 1932, \n20,000 people drowned in Harbin (nearly 10 percent of the city\u2019s population at the time). In \n1998, loss of life was fortunately far less, but damage equivalent to $7.3 billion occurred.1 The \npoor and vulnerable suffer most from the floods. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided \nthree emergency loans for rehabilitating infrastructure damaged by the 1998 flood.2 Following \nthe loss of life and property in 1998, the Government has begun strengthening flood planning \nand protection measures to prevent a recurrence of such loss. \n \n3.  In December 1999 ADB approved technical assistance (TA) to prepare the Songhua \nRiver Flood, Wetland, and Biodiversity Management Project.3 The TA assisted the Ministry of \nWater Resources (MWR) to prepare a feasibility study for an integrated flood management \nproject. The Appraisal Mission was fielded in two phases during 21 October to 3 December \n2001 to finalize the objectives, scope, cost, and project implementation arrangements for the \nProject.4 A summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) was circulated to the Board on 17 \nAugust 2001. This report is based on the draft final report of the TA, Government feasibility \nstudies, findings of ADB missions, the SIEE, and discussions with Government officials, other \naid agencies, and stakeholders. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nIII.  BACKGROUND \n \nA.  Sector Description \n \n1.  Floods \n \n4.  Vulnerability  to  droughts  and  floods  of  epic  scale  and  severity  has  made  the \nmanagement of water resources a central preoccupation of the leaders of the country for \n                                                 \n1\n The 1998 floods were the worst on record for the Songhua River and its tributaries. About 16 million people were \ndirectly affected, 154 lives were lost, and damage was estimated at $7.3 billion equivalent. \n2\n Loans 1685/1686/1687-PRC: Northeast Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project, for $330 million, approved on 22 \nApril 1999. The loans covered work in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces and the Autonomous Region of Inner \nMongolia. \n3\n TA 3376-PRC: Songhua River Flood, Wetland, and Biodiversity Management Project, for $1,545,000, approved on \n27 December 1999. Supplementary TA financing of $250,000 was approved on 30 July 2001 to provide for \nchanges in scope and cost overruns in the first phase. The project name was changed to the Songhua River Flood \nManagement Sector Project to separate interventions aimed at biodiversity conservation from the Project, and \nadoption of the sector lending modality. A proposed loan, likely to be cofinanced by the Global Environment \nFacility, for the Sanjiang Plain is included in the 2004 Country Assistance Program.  \n4\n The Mission comprised B. Carrad, Senior Project Specialist (Natural Resources)/Mission Leader, AEFN; Yang \nJunmei, Programs Officer, PRCM; D. Tang, Environment Specialist, ENVD; L. Blanchetti-Revelli, Resettlement \nSpecialist, AED; and V. You, Counsel, OGC. I. Fox, Senior Project Specialist (Portfolio Management), AWFN, was \nthe Mission Leader up to July 2001 and also assisted during the Fact-Finding Mission for the period 14-21 \nSeptember 2001. ", "  2\nthousands of years. Records starting from 206 BC describe more than one thousand significant \nflood disasters, averaging once every two years. Flood management in the PRC has been \npracticed for at least 3,500 years, and many flood control dikes date from ancient times. \nOriginally constructed using simple techniques, they have been gradually added to over the \ncenturies with the aim of securing greater security from flooding for a growing population. The \nolder works are, in many cases, not capable of withstanding the increased hydraulic pressures, \nand failures are therefore common. There are now about 260,000 kilometers (km) of flood \ncontrol dikes nationwide. Such is the backlog of maintenance and strengthening work that the \nactual standard of flood protection in the rural areas is equivalent to a flood of about 20-year \naverage recurrence interval (ARI), while the general standard is 1 per 35-50 years. The current \ndesign standard for important cities is the 100-200 years ARI flood, while the actual situation in \nmost cities is about 1 per 50 years up to a maximum of 1 per 100 years. \n \n5.  Since 1949, the PRC has built more than 80,000 water storage reservoirs to try to \nensure  water  requirements  for  irrigation,  industry,  domestic  water  supply,  hydropower \ngeneration, and flood control. Despite this remarkable engineering achievement, as many as \n400  of  the  PRC's  668  cities  suffer  water  shortages.  To  partially  address  the  problem  the \nmassive South-North Water Transfer Project to supply water to northern cities was recently \nendorsed by the Government. Earlier policies support large-scale industrial development in \nremote, generally water-deficient parts of the country; thus, allowing factories unlimited access \nto state-financed water supplies contributed to the inappropriate use of scarce water resources. \nFor the same value of industrial output, the PRC's factories use 5-10 times the amount of water \nused in developed countries.5 Similarly, irrigated agriculture has spread into some of the driest \nparts of the country, and low prices for water provide no incentive to farmers to adopt water-\nefficient techniques. MWR estimates that as much as 60 percent of water diverted for irrigation \nis  lost  in  conveyance  through  leakage,  evaporation,  and  seepage  to  the  water  table. \nSpectacular floods have given the impression that the PRC has ample water, but the reality is \nthat water availability in the country is only one quarter of the world average.6 \n \n6.  Floods and droughts have produced some of the worst natural disasters in the PRC's \nhistory. In over two thirds of the country, annual rainfall is low (less than 600 millimeters [mm] on \naverage)  and  drought  is  a  recurrent  specter.7 Although  investments  in  flood  control  and \nprotection have increased steadily over the last two decades and the number of deaths per \nflood has declined markedly due to better flood warning and evacuation, the cost of flood \ndamage has steadily increased. 8 The reasons for this are complex. Population growth and \nshortage of arable land have pushed many poor farmers to eke out a living in flood-prone areas. \nImproved flood protection (mostly dikes), and reclamation of wetlands and natural flood storage \nbasins for agriculture and other purposes in formerly vulnerable areas have been supported by \nextensive  development  of  railroads,  highways,  and  better  communications  facilities  in  the \nfloodplains. Deforestation and inappropriate agriculture practices have diminished water-holding \n                                                 \n5\n  Li Peng. 2001. China Daily, 23 March 2001. \n6\n  World Bank. 2001. China - Agenda for Water Sector Strategy for North China. It covers the Huanghe/Yellow River, \nHauihe,  and  Haihe  rivers,  where  people  have  only  5  percent  of  the  world  average  of  5,000  liters  of \nwater/person/year. The Songhua River basin, not covered in the report, has slightly above the PRC average, or 4 \ntimes the level of these three river basins. \n7\n The worst drought since 1978 gripped the nation in 2001. It left 22.6 million people and 14.5 million livestock \nwithout adequate drinking water, and devastated crops on 73 million hectares (ha) of farmland. \n8\n The risk of flood damage has steadily increased despite greater protection expenditures. Risk is defined as the \nproduct of the probability of any given flood magnitude multiplied by the value of the infrastructure that would be \ndamaged in that event. Increased standards of flood protection achieved through structural flood control measures \nare more than compensated by the growth of investment in flood-protected (formerly flood-prone) areas.  \n ", "  3\ncapacity and simultaneously promoted more rapid rainfall runoff, causing flash flooding and \nmore severe soil erosion. The effects are cumulative, leading to increased flood heights and a \nperceived need to continuously strengthen and raise the flood protection works to ever-higher \nlevels. \n \n7.  The poorest members of society are most at risk from such calamities. In rural areas the \npoor often live in areas without adequate protection from floods or without access to irrigation. In \nurban locations the poor tend to live in low-lying poorly drained areas susceptible to flooding. \nThe  direct  effects  of  floods  include  death,  injuries,  increased  health  hazards,  community \ndisplacement, loss of property and productive assets, and general disruption of education, \nlivelihood, and social life. The poor are ill-equipped to recover from such setbacks. Women are \nparticularly burdened because tasks such as fetching drinking water, fuel, and food; taking care \nof children and elders; and feeding livestock__tasks traditionally falling on women__become more \ndifficult during and after flooding. Winters are severe and floodwater can remain frozen in place \nand give rise to prolonged saturation of cropland and loss of planting stock, destructive frost \nheave  in  road  embankments  and  low-cost  houses,  and  floodborne  contamination  of \ngroundwater. These impacts may persist for many months and inhibit the economic recovery of \nthe poor. \n \n2.  Songhua River Basin \n \n8.  Northeastern PRC comprising Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces and the Inner Mongolia \nAutonomous Region, is the PRC\u2019s \u201cgateway\u201d to Russia and northeast Asia. ADB has begun to \npromote regional cooperation between Mongolia and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,9 \nand other organizations10 are promoting regional cooperation in northeast Asia. Various cultural \ninfluences can be seen in the architecture of the main cities. A good transportation network of \ninland waterways, railways, highways, and airlines provides access to Changchun, Daqing, \nHarbin, Jilin City, and Qiqihar__the key centers of economic development. Changchun, the \ncapital of Jilin Province, hosts the automobile industry for the northeast region. Other industries \ninclude  chemicals,  food  processing,  and  a  host  of  secondary  and  tertiary  industries  and \nservices. Harbin__the capital of Heilongjiang Province__and Daqing and Qiqihar have electricity \ngeneration, chemical, oil/gas, fiber, plastic, lumber, and textiles industries. Daqing is famous for \nits extensive oil fields, while Qiqihar has metallurgical, machine tool, chemical, gold mining, and \nlumber industries.11  \n \n9.  The Songhua River basin has a catchment area of 557,000 km2 (see Maps, pages vii-\nviii) where about 62 million people live. The river originates from two main sources, the Nen and \nSecond Songhua rivers, which meet near Songyuan to form the Songhua River (see Maps, \npages vii-viii). From this confluence, the Songhua River flows easterly to join the Heilong River \non the boundary between Russia and the PRC. About 54 percent (300,000 km2) of the area is in \nthe Nen River catchment area, 13 percent (73,000 km2) in the Second Songhua catchment \narea, and the remaining 33 percent (184,000 km2) is immediately adjacent to the Songhua River \nmain channel. Average annual rainfall is low, varying from less than 400 mm in the west to more \nthan 800 mm in the east. Most rain falls in June-September, and average rainfall in a wet year \nmay be three times that in a dry year. \n                                                 \n9\n TA 5956-REG: Strategic Study on Development Options for Economic Cooperation between PRC and Mongolia in \nEastern Parts of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, PRC and Mongolia, for $250,000, approved on 21 December \n2000.  \n10\n Including the United Nations Development Programme and the East-West Center in Hawaii.  \n11\n The Daqing oil field is the largest in the PRC (50 million barrels annually) and ranks among the top 10 oil fields in \nthe world.  ", "  4\n10.  The river basin is demarcated by three mountain ranges: the Daxing\u2019an range, which lies \nalong the west and southwest border of the basin in Inner Mongolia; the Xiaoxing\u2019an range, \nwhich limits the north and northeast part of the basin; and the Changbai range, which limits the \nsouth and southeast part of the basin. The forest cover in these ranges provides reasonable \nprotection  for  the  water  resources  of  the  area  and  the  cascade  multipurpose  reservoirs \ndeveloped along the Second Songhua River.12 The other significant landforms are the Song-\nNen  and  Sanjiang  floodplains.  In  1999  and  2001,  the  Government  selected  Jilin  and \nHeilongjiang  provinces  to  become  two  of  the  country\u2019s  three  experimental  \u201cecological \nprovinces,\u201d acknowledging their rich biodiversity and potential for sustainable management of \nnatural resources.  \n \n11.  Harbin (urban population 2.6 million), Changchun (2 million), Qiqihar (1.1 million), and \nDaqing (over 1 million) are all important cities located in the Song-Nen Plain, the larger of two \nmajor floodplains. A network of flood protection structures exists around cities, key rural and \nurban areas, and flood detention basins. However, many structures are old and have not been \nadequately maintained. The floodplain is a productive agricultural area for grain and livestock \nindustries,  having  been  significantly  altered  over  time  through  the  construction  of  flood \nprotection dikes. Wetlands, with a natural function of absorbing floodwaters and maintaining \nwildlife,  have  often  been  converted  to  commercial  uses,  which  has  increased  the  risk  of \nflooding.13 Over-drainage and mismanagement of the available water resources have created \nsterile  areas  with  saline  and  alkaline  soils.  In  such  areas,  strong  prevailing  winds  cause \nextensive erosion in non-vegetated areas and the advance of sand dunes.  \n \n12.  The second major floodplain in the basin is the 100,000 km2 Sanjiang Plain (or \u201cThree \nRivers Plain\u201d) at the confluence of the Songhua, Heilong and Wusuli rivers. It is one of the most \nimportant agriculture production areas in the PRC. Although it has little influence over flood \nlevels in the Songhua River Basin, the Sanjiang Plain has the largest contiguous wetlands in \neastern Asia (about 1.5 million hectares [ha]), and provides globally important breeding areas \nand migratory routes for waterfowl. Large parts of the plain have been drained for agricultural \ndevelopment,  and  the  remaining  wetlands  are  under  threat  of  further  development  for \nagriculture, industry, and construction of highways and urban facilities.14  \n \n13.  The urbanization rate is relatively high with 43 percent of the population living in cities or \ntowns. The rural population totals 35.4 million (57 percent) and about 17.4 million ha (31 \npercent) of the basin\u2019s area is farmland. On average, each rural person has about 0.5 ha of \nfarmland__ranging from 0.3 ha per person in Jilin, to 0.8 ha per person in Inner Mongolia__higher \nthan the national average. Only 22 percent of farmland is irrigated and much of the farmland is \npoor, especially in Inner Mongolia. Due to its susceptibility to drought and desertification, Inner \nMongolia has the highest proportion of irrigated land (37 percent). According to one study by the \nSongliao Water Resources Commission (SWRC), 66 counties with a population of 32.7 million \nare at high risk of drought and flooding. In these counties, about 70 percent of the people live in \nrural areas. Average per capita income in rural areas is about Y2,200, half the urban average. \nRural people and livelihoods are particularly vulnerable to floods and droughts.  \n \n14.  Thirty national- and provincial-level poverty counties are clustered along the banks of the \nNen River and its tributaries, indicating a fundamental association between the concentration of \npoverty and flooding in the river basin. The incidence of rural income poverty in 1999 was \n                                                 \n12\n TA, Revised Midterm Report, May 2001. Chapter 1. The upper watershed forest cover appears to be generally \nbetter than in many other major river systems in the PRC. \n13 MWR estimates that from 1949 to 2000, the basin wetland area shrank from 20,000 km2 to 6,500 km2. \n14\n Technical assistance will be provided in 2002 to prepare a 2004 loan project for the Sanjiang Plain. ", "  5\nestimated at 24.5 percent overall, based on a per capita annual income of Y1,300.15 Poverty \nwas highest at about 31 percent in Inner Mongolia, 26.9 percent in Heilongjiang and lowest at \nabout 20.3 percent in Jilin. The poor and the near poor (incomes below Y1,500) comprise about \n32 percent of the total population and are highly vulnerable to flood damage and consequent \nlosses and stresses. \n \n  3.  Floods in the Songhua River Basin \n \n15.  Major floods occur in the area once every 10 years on average. Large floods in the \nSonghua River basin originate from rainfall events rather than snowmelt. Large rainfall events \ncan  be  generated  by  cold  fronts,  low  pressures  from  Mongolia,  Baikal  low  pressures  or \ntyphoons. As the basin is so large and the topography varies significantly, storms are not \ndistributed uniformly, and there are three geographic zones: (i) the Second Songhua, Lalin, and \nMudan  rivers  and  the  tributaries  of  the  Songhua  River  entering  from  the  south;  typically \ntyphoons or cyclonic storms bring large amounts of rainfall in a short period of time and these \nstorm events are usually violent and cover large areas; (ii) the Nen River and its tributaries, \nwhich experience less intensive rain over long periods; and (iii) the southeast side of the \nGreater Xing\u2019an Mountain Range and the basin of the north bank tributaries of the Songhua \nRiver, which experience small and localized storms.  \n \n16.  Only  rudimentary  early  flood  warning  systems  exist  and  no  effective  coordination \nbetween agencies is in place. Land-use planning and controls are not based on an adequate \nassessment of a sustainable environmental balance. The responsible institutions, principally the \nwater resources bureaus at the provincial/autonomous region level and SWRC overall, are not \nadequately resourced. During project preparation, policy dialogue focused on the need for a \nconsistent legal/regulatory framework, improved transboundary coordination between agencies, \nand effective monitoring of river basin planning for comprehensive flood management. \n \n  4.  The 1998 Flood \n \n17.  The worst flood recorded for over 200 years hit the Songhua River basin in June-August \n1998. It covered 137,000 km2 (25 percent of the basin area), threatened Harbin, and severely \naffected other urban and rural areas. The Government made a massive effort to control the \nfloods and protect the people, countryside, cities, and infrastructure. During 45 days in July and \nAugust, 300,000 people laid over 12 million sandbags to reinforce dikes in the lower reaches of \nthe Nen River. Despite this effort, the dikes breached in seven places. With the onset of winter, \nresidual floodwaters were frozen in place for up to six months, especially across the flat Song-\nNen Plain. Official estimates show that 105 counties and 13.4 million people were affected, of \nwhom  3.4  million  were  evacuated  from  their  homes.  More  than  0.9  million  houses  were \ndestroyed and 46 people died. Close to one million tons of grain was lost and over 619,000 \nlivestock were affected. The worst affected areas included 28 poverty counties where poverty \nincreased significantly as a direct result of the 1998 floods. Rural and urban incomes, which had \nsteadily increased throughout the 1990s, plunged after the flood. The number of people living \nbelow the Government\u2019s poverty line increased from 3.5 million in 1998 to 5.2 million people in \n1999, an increase of 52 percent. Agricultural losses were estimated at Y22 billion, and direct \nproperty and asset losses exceeded Y36 billion, for a total economic cost of Y52 billion ($7.3 \nbillion).  \n \n                                                 \n15\n Although not yet formally approved, ADB\u2019s recent estimate puts the income poverty line as Y1,300 per capita for \nrural areas Y3,300 for urban areas.   ", "  6\n18.  In reaction to the 1998 floods, the Government initiated improvements in flood protection \nfor the major rivers Hai, Huai, Liao, Pearl, Songhua, Yangtze, and the Yellow River basin.16 The \nGovernment recognizes that the major water resources problems in the PRC are interrelated, \nand  that  their  resolution  requires  a  shift  from  a  sector  focus  to  a  more  integrated  and \ncomprehensive  approach. 17  Specifically  for  the  Songhua  River  basin,  the  concept  of \ncomprehensive  flood  management  is  expressed  in  the  ongoing  and  planned  activities  of \nprovincial-level agencies, e.g., bureaus of forests, water resources, land resources, environment \nprotection, and SWRC for wetland conservation; and SWRC and Bureau of Water Resources \nfor soil and water conservation.18 \n \nB.  Government Policies and Plans  \n \n19.  The  PRC  has  an  extensive  legislative  framework  governing  water  resources \nmanagement. Laws deal with management of water resources at the national level and include \nthe bases for integrated water resources planning and management covering water allocation, \nflood control, and forest and wetland protection and management. Numerous regulations and \norganizations implement the laws; some regulations, however, are ambiguous, inadequate, or \ninconsistent. Overlapping or conflicting jurisdiction among agencies leaves important issues \nunattended and inhibits cooperation. The separation of institutional responsibilities at the river \nbasin  and  provincial  levels  impedes  integrated  and  comprehensive  management  of  land, \nforests,  water,  wetlands,  and  ecological  functions.  Implementation  capacity  is  not  always \neffective due to centralized policies and laws, but decentralized financial responsibility and asset \nownership.  Major  laws  affecting  river  basin  management  are  described  in  the  following \nparagraphs but certain other laws are also relevant.19 Local regulations in the Songhua River \nbasin need further definition to achieve a consistent legal framework. \n \n  1.  1988 Water Law \n \n20.  The basic principles and policies for water resources management in the PRC are \ndefined in the 1988 Water Law, which aims to direct, coordinate, and standardize all activities \nfor development, utilization, and protection of water resources. MWR is primarily responsible for \nimplementing this law. ADB\u2019s TA for strategic options for the water sector20 gave considerable \nsupport for revising and updating this law to lay the basis for a modern policy framework. \nDrawing on this assistance, the law has been updated in four main areas: (i) water allocation, \nrights  and  permits,  with  more  precise  definitions  and  jurisdictions;  (ii)  water  resource \n                                                 \n16\n Nationwide, the 1998 floods claimed 3,656 lives and caused damage to the economy estimated at $30 billion \nequivalent. Other river systems are also covered in these improvements. \n17\n ADB helped to assess the constraints and options for the future under TA 2817-PRC: Strategic Options for the \nWater Sector, for $1.18 million, approved on 26 June 1997. \n18\n Detailed measures and agency responsibilities are set out in the implementation of \u201cSome Suggestions on \nImprovement of Flood Control Construction of the Nen River and Songhua River in the Short Term.\u201d SWRC, \nJanuary 2001. Awareness of the need for an integrated approach has been raised during project preparation.  \n19 Other relevant laws include (i) Water and Soil Conservation (1991) on control of soil erosion, rational use of water \nand soil, mitigation of flood and drought disasters, and improving the environment; (ii) Water Pollution Control \n(amended in 1996 with ADB assistance), covering water quality control, water quantity and quality, emphasizing \nunified river basin management plans; (iii) Environmental Protection (1989) to prevent and control pollution and \nsafeguard human health; and (iv) Land Administration (amended in 1998 with ADB assistance) covering expansion \nof the nonstate and noncollective sectors of the economy, and market-oriented principles. This law includes several \nfeatures to encourage rational land use: e.g., a land registry and certificate system defining rights to use land, land \nrequisition, resettlement, and resettlement payments. An important provision of the Land Law is that land use is to \nbe compatible with the comprehensive plan for rivers and lakes and consistent with requirements to prevent \nflooding. \n20\n TA 2817-PRC: Strategic Options for the Water Sector, for $1.18 million, approved on 26 June 1997. ", "  7\nmanagement systems, with respect to the roles of the river basin management institutions and \nprovincial and local governments, as well as transjurisdiction issues and water user/supplier \norganizations; (iii) efficiency of use and conservation of water; and (iv) water quality control, \ncovering surface water and groundwater, and standards for pollution. The revised law was \napproved by the State Council on 26 November 2001 and is expected to be approved by the \nNational People\u2019s Congress (NPC) in early 2003.   \n \n  2.  1997 Flood Control Law \n \n21.  The 1997 Flood Control Law was the first law for the prevention and control of natural \ndisasters (replacing previous administrative regulations and other laws), and thus filled a gap in \nthe water legislation. It addresses the specific causes and remedial measures to be taken to \nprevent and control floods. It requires a unified and integrated planning approach based on \ncomprehensive river basin plans prepared by the river basin commissions. The law introduced \nthe designation of \u201cplanned reserve zones/areas\u201d in which special rules may apply to land use \nand economic activities. It also provides for a flood impact assessment for any project in flood-\nprone areas. MWR is primarily responsible for implementing this law. \n \n  3.  Institutional Framework \n \na.  Ministry of Water Resources \n \n22.  MWR has overall responsibility for administrating, planning, and managing the nation's \nwater resources. Its mandate is based on the 1982 Constitution, which states that \"all mineral \nresources, waters, forests, mountains, grasslands, unreclaimed land, beaches and other natural \nresources are owned by the State\u2026.\" MWR's traditional role is planning and constructing major \nhydraulic structures and multipurpose projects such as flood protection, irrigation and rural \nwater supply development, and hydropower generation. In 1998, MWR gained responsibility for \ngroundwater administration, but its mandates for hydropower construction and biological soil \nstabilization  were  removed.  MWR  retained  national  responsibility  for  soil  and  water \nconservation. MWR is linked with and provides technical guidance to the provincial bureaus of \nwater resources, which have comparable provincial-level responsibilities.  \n \n23.  MWR is responsible for (i) preparing the plans covering water resources in national \ndevelopment,  (ii)  preparing  regional  plans  covering  more  than  one  province,  (iii)  planning \nassociated with major interprovincial projects, and (iv) formulating comprehensive plans for \ndesignated interprovincial river basins for approval by the State Council through the river basin \ncommissions and in cooperation with other departments and provincial governments. \n \n    b.  Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief (OSFCDR) \n \n24.  OSFCDR is responsible for flood management and drought relief at the national level. \nDuring normal periods, OSFCDR administratively reports to and receives technical guidance \nfrom MWR. OSFCDR reports directly to the vice-premier with the authority to direct central \nagencies and provincial governors. The deputy secretary-general of the State Council and the \nministers of Water Resources, Railways, Communications, and Civil Affairs are deputy chiefs. \n \n    c.  River Basin Commissions \n \n25.  Six interprovincial river basin commissions (for the Hai, Huai, Pearl, Songhua-Liao, \nYangtze,  and  Yellow  river  basins)  and  one  lake  commission  (for  Tai  Lake)  are  directly \nadministered by MWR. Their responsibilities are wide-ranging and reflect, at the river basin ", "  8\nlevel, the general responsibilities of MWR.21 In practice, the commissions do not exercise the full \nrange  of  their  responsibilities__due  in  part  to  the  absence  of  direct  representation  of  the \nprovincial governments__and are predominantly planning and coordinating bodies. Certain river \nbasin  commissions  such  as  the  Yangtze  and  Yellow  river  commissions,  have,  however, \ndeveloped more power due to the size and importance of the river basins. SWRC, established \nin 1982 with responsibilities similar to those of other commissions and including international \nboundary rivers in northeast PRC (Heilong and Wasuli rivers), employs 2,569 staff allocated \nbetween  divisions,  institutes,  and  enterprises.  SWRC  has  a  lower  level  of  capability  and \nresponsibility than the two larger river commissions and has had no previous experience with \nforeign-funded projects. It has experience in working in a decentralized ownership/financial \nresponsibility context with the provinces/autonomous region. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue stressed the \nimportance  of  strengthening  SWRC  to  give  it  greater  authority  for  comprehensive  flood \nmanagement. MWR will support SWRC by immediately transferring additional experienced staff.   \n \n    d.  Provincial and Other Institutions \n \n26.  In the Songhua River basin, the organizational structure at the provincial/autonomous \nregion  level  gives  the  primary  responsibility  for  flood  management  and  soil  and  water \nconservation  to  the  provincial  water  resource  bureaus.  These  bureaus  are  responsible  for \nstructural  measures  for  water  and  soil  conservation,  and  supervise  operations  and \nimplementation of laws by the municipal, county, and prefecture water resources departments. \nThe departments report administratively to the local governments. Academic institutions and \nassociations, research and extension units, and training organizations have the capacity to \nprovide services for monitoring, training, and related services under the proposed Project.22 \nExperience in working with ADB has been gained through ongoing emergency loans in the \nsame sector (footnote 2). However, the concept of a \u201criver basin\u201d is not widely understood, and \nthe capacity to prepare reliable feasibility studies and other plans requires strengthening.  \n \n    e.  Songhua River Basin Flood Management Plan \n \n27.  SWRC completed a master plan for water resource development and management in \nthe  Songhua  and  Liao  river  basins  (referred  to  collectively  as  the  Song-Liao  basin)  in \nSeptember 1992. The master plan, Comprehensive Planning in the Songhua River Basin, was \nbased on 1988 as the planning year and was approved by the State Council in 1994. Following \n                                                 \n21 River basin commissions have the following main responsibilities: (i) organizing and supervising the implementation \nof relevant laws and regulations, and basin-wide policies and regulations; (ii) formulating a development strategy \nfor the river basin, master plans and technical plans in cooperation with other departments and provincial \ngovernments, and supervising implementation of these plans; (iii) organizing water resources monitoring, survey, \nand evaluation; (iv) formulating long-term water supply and distribution plans among relevant provinces and \nsupervising implementation; (v) managing certain water withdrawal permits and monitoring protection of the basin \nwater resources; (vi) managing the riverine and estuarine parts of the river basin; (vii) developing a flood control \nplan for the basin (including any international river basins), reviewing provincial flood control plans, coordinating \nflood control and drought relief, and providing guidance on design safety and construction of flood storage basins; \n(viii) resolving water disputes among provinces or sectors; (ix) organizing prevention, supervision, and treatment at \nmajor soil erosion areas within the basin, and guiding local efforts in water and soil conservation; (x) reviewing \nproject  proposals,  feasibility  studies,  and  preliminary  designs  of  projects  for  the  basin  under  the  central \nGovernment and those jointly funded with local governments; (xi) formulating the annual investment plan of the \ncentral Government in the basin, and organizing the implementation of the plan upon its approval; (xii) constructing \nand managing important or interprovincial/regional water projects; (xiii) being in charge of foreign affairs concerning \ninternational boundary rivers in cooperation with other relevant departments; (xiv) guiding work in rural and urban \nwater management; (xv) guiding hydropower construction and work of rural electrification; and (xvi) undertaking \nand handling other matters as requested by MWR.  \n22\n Most civil society institutions are connected to provincial, city or county bureaus, or to the ministries. ", "  9\nthe major flood of 1998, the Government increased the design standard for flood protection in \nthe Songhua River and other major river basins. MWR also prepared a supplement to the 1994 \nplan titled Some Suggestions for Improvement of Flood Control Construction of the Nen River \nand the Songhua River in the Short Term, approved by the Government on 5 April 2000. From \n1949 to 2000, the wetland area was reduced from 20,000 km2 to 6,500 km2 and soil losses and \nenvironmental damage increased. Greater attention to water and soil conservation, wetland \nprotection, and maintenance of the ecological balance are given in the 1994 update. \n \n28.  The 1994 plan and the 2000 supplement describe a comprehensive and integrated flood \nmanagement plan for the Songhua River basin. Implementation was estimated to cost Y45.56 \nbillion ($5.5 billion) over a planning period of 15 years (i.e., 2000-2015) and covers flood \nprotection dikes, new reservoirs, rehabilitation of unsafe reservoirs, flood storage and retarding \nbasins,  wetland  conservation,  removal  of  mainstream  flow  constrictions,  soil  and  water \nconservation,  and  nonstructural  measures.  The  provinces  and  autonomous  region  are \ncommitted to this plan. ADB will provide TA for preparing a 2004 loan project for the Sanjiang \nPlain, which is likely to include cofinancing from the Global Environment Facility (GEF).  \n \nC.  External Assistance to the Sector \n \n  1.  ADB's Operations in the Water Sector \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s involvement in the water sector has been significant, especially in water supply \nand wastewater treatment. Since 1992 ADB has provided 15 loans totaling $1.97 billion for \nwater supply, wastewater treatment, and flood damage rehabilitation. ADB has also financed \nTAs totaling $37.73 million related to the environment, water supply, and flood control: (i) 37 \nadvisory TAs on the preparation of policies and strategies, amounting to $23.98 million; and (ii) \n16 project preparatory TAs amounting to $13.75 million (Appendix 2). \n \n30.  The  TA  for  strategic  options  for  the  water  sector  (footnote  20)  made  an  important \ncontribution to strategic planning of water resources in the PRC. Several workshops were held, \nto  which  external  agencies  were  invited,  including  the  World  Bank,  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  (AusAID),  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  (CIDA), \nGerman Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), and Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA). Key issues were (i) lack of unified water administration and management; (ii) gap \nbetween  policy,  planning,  and  implementation;  (iii)  inadequacy  of  financial  resources;  (iv) \nescalating flood damage; (v) water scarcity and inefficient water use; (vi) increasing water \npollution; and (vii) soil erosion and ecosystem degradation. This successful and influential TA \nled to a much higher ADB profile in the water sector, including desertification.  \n \n31.  After the strategic options TA, a TA for national strategies for soil and water conservation \nhelped MWR to address soil and water conservation comprehensively (overcoming the narrow \ndemarcations under existing institutional arrangements) and map out a strategic approach to \ncontrol all forms of land degradation throughout the PRC.23 The final report on the TA was very \nwell received by the Government and has made an influential contribution to developing a \ncomprehensive approach to addressing land degradation. \n \n32.  The Yellow River Flood Management Sector Project24 will promote economic growth and \nminimize flood risks through improved flood management in the flood-prone areas of the lower \n                                                 \n23\n TA 3548-PRC: Preparing National Strategies for Soil and Water Conservation, for $800,000, approved on 20 \nNovember 2000. \n24\n Approved on 28 August 2001 for $150 million. ", "  10\nreaches of the Yellow River in Henan and Shandong provinces. The project is expected to \nimprove flood protection for about 85 million residents of the northern PRC plain, including \nabout 1.8 million people residing in the inner floodplain. The project comprises structural and \nnonstructural measures covering (i) improved flood management, (ii) flood control works, (iii) a \nvillage  protection  component,  and  (iv)  project  management.  This  project  has  provided  an \nimportant  springboard  for  many  of  the  policy  and  institutional  aspects  discussed  with  the \nGovernment in the context of the Songhua River basin. \n \n33.  ADB  is  currently  assisting  to  formulate  the  PRC-GEF  Partnership,  a  10-year, \nmultiagency program to combat land degradation in dryland ecosystems in western PRC.25 A \ncountry  programming  framework  will  describe  policy,  legislative,  and  institutional  enabling \nfactors; identify priority ecoregions; define priority investment and TA interventions and their \nsequencing; and specify a monitoring and evaluation system. ADB has also provided TA totaling \n$6.15 million for strengthening the institutional capacities of agencies responsible for assessing \nand monitoring environmental impacts and formulating environmental protection laws. \n \n  2.  Other External Assistance \n \n34.  The World Bank and a number of bilateral agencies26 have supported water resources \ndevelopment  and  flood  control  in  the  PRC.  The  World  Bank  has  been  involved  in  water \nresources projects in a number of river basins, including the Yangtze River (Tai Lake Basin \nFlood  Control,  Yangtze  River  Water  Resources  Development  Plan,  and  Yangtze  Dike \nStrengthening);  and  the  Yellow  River  (Xiaolangdi  Multipurpose  I  and  II, 27  Xiaolangdi \nResettlement,28 and Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation).29 Flood sector issues addressed \ninclude (i) rational and standardized approach for improving flood control infrastructure facilities, \nand (ii) financial and physical sustainability of flood protection facilities.  \n \n35.  The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) has financed several multipurpose \ndam projects, most of which have flood protection as one of the objectives. With the introduction \nof  more  concessional  terms  and  conditions  for  projects  aimed  at  global  environment \nimprovement and pollution control in 1997, JBIC has become more actively involved in flood \ncontrol projects, including an afforestation project in the upper reaches of the Yellow River \nbasin.30 JICA has provided grants for projects related to water resources and flood protection, \nwith emphasis on human resources development and afforestation, and soil stabilization in the \nLoess Plateau. \n \n36.  AusAID approved the Yangtze River Flood Control and Management Project in February \n2001 to improve the capacity of the Yangtze Water Resources Commission to deliver timely and \n                                                 \n25\n TA 3497-PRC: Global Environment Facility Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems, for $100,000, \napproved  on  5  September  2000;  TA  3657-PRC:  PRC-GEF  Partnership  on  Land  Degradation  in  Dryland \nEcosystems, for $1,150,000, approved on 25 May 2001; and TA 3663-PRC: Optimizing Initiatives to Combat \nDesertification in Gansu Province, for $610,000, approved on 5 June 2001. \n26\n These include the Japan Bank for International Cooperation/Japan International Cooperation Agency (JBIC/JICA), \nAustralian Agency for International Development (AusAID), Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), \nand Danish International Development Assistance (Danida). \n27\n Project ID: P003562 and P034081.

", "  11\naccurate flood forecasts. AusAID and ADB plan to conduct a joint workshop for the Yellow River \nConservancy Commission and Yangtze Water Resources Commission to share initial findings \non the effectiveness and implementation issues of nonstructural flood protection measures. \nSWRC officials will also be invited to learn from these larger river basin commissions. CIDA has \nbeen providing grant assistance to control soil erosion in the middle reach of the Yellow River \nbasin, and is currently considering assistance for strategic flood management and flood control \nmanagement systems.  \n \nD.  Lessons Learned  \n \n37.  International experience suggests that floods can be most effectively addressed through \nan optimal combination of structural and nonstructural measures. The PRC tended to overstress \nstructural approaches in the past, but it now increasingly recognizes the need to move toward a \nmore  comprehensive  flood  management  approach.  The  devastating  1998  flood  highlighted \nnonstructural  measures  as  essential  elements  of  an  integrated  river  basin  management \napproach. The proposed Project will serve as the first stage of a long-term commitment to \nnatural resources in the Songhua River basin. A 2002 TA will prepare a 2003 ADB loan project \nfor the Sanjiang wetlands, East Asia\u2019s largest contiguous wetland, in Heilongjiang (para. 28). \n \n38.  The importance of sound watershed management was pointed out by a number of \nproject  performance  audit  reports  (PPARs).  Many  communities  have  experienced  severe \nflooding partly due to the effects of denuded forested uplands and watersheds. Similarly, the \nsector synthesis of postevaluation findings in the irrigation and rural development sector pointed \nout how lack of proper watershed management endangers human population and the physical \nenvironment.31 Postevaluation experience in the flood control sector in other countries resulted \nin recommendations to strengthen integrated river basin management. In designing river basin \ndevelopment  projects,  an  integrated  and  coordinated  approach  involving  upper  watershed \nmanagement and conservation, and downstream rural development must be simultaneously \nand effectively carried out. The provinces and autonomous region have ongoing forestry/soil \nand water conservation programs to address these concerns. \n \n39.  ADB\u2019s experience with rehabilitation assistance after a disaster was reviewed in 1998 \nand provided information useful to flood sector projects. Although the projects reviewed were \ngenerally rated as successful, achievements in terms of rapid restoration of facilities to ensure \ncontinuity of productive and social life were sometimes below expectations. Considerable delays \noccurred due to (i) delayed loan effectiveness, (ii) institutional weaknesses of implementing \nagencies, (iii) slower-than-expected procurement of consulting services and other project inputs, \n(iv) low level of understanding of ADB\u2019s procedures for disbursing funds, and (v) unclear or \ncomplicated subproject selection criteria and approval procedures. As a result, advance action \nin recruiting consultants will be undertaken, and full explanation of ADB procedures provided. \nSeveral water sector projects financed by the World Bank in the PRC have been delayed for \nlack of counterpart funds during implementation. Letters ensuring that adequate counterpart \nfunds will be fully provided on time during implementation were requested as part of loan \nappraisal. \n \n40.  A recent World Bank study (footnote 6) indicated that existing institutional arrangements \ndo  not  permit  a  coherent  integrated  approach  to  solving  water  problems.  River  basin \ncommissions  operate  under  the  aegis  of  MWR  and  lack  authority  to  impose  river  basin \nmanagement over other ministries and provinces. Current water allocation arrangements are \n                                                 \n31\n ADB. 1995. Sector Synthesis of Postevaluation Findings in Irrigation and Rural Development. ", "  12\nbased on periodic negotiations between riparian provinces and past climatic events, rather than \non real time monitoring and river forecasting models. Project design has stressed the need for \nclose cooperation between all parties, and several workshops were conducted to foster an \nappreciation of the basinwide approach. Specific loan covenants have been agreed upon (para. \n114). Flood management measures, a basinwide geographic information system (GIS) as an \ninput to mathematical modeling, a flood forecasting system, flood control command system as \nwell  as  strengthening  SWRC\u2019s  staffing,  training,  and  support  for  decentralized  planning  of \nnonstructural activities, are included. SWRC will play the role of overall coordinator of flood \nmanagement activities. \n \n41.  Partly due to fragmented responsibilities and mandates, but also as a result of the \nmethod of financing water-related institutes and activities, data on water resources in the PRC \nare not freely available to potential users. Due to the costs of the survey work involved, the \ncollecting agency sees data collection as an investment and treats the results as capital. Other \norganizations or the public may only gain access by paying for it. Quite often large amounts of \nmoney  may  be  involved.  In  September  2001,  MWR  announced  through  MWR  document \nnumber 2001/377 that all hydrological data, i.e., real-time flood data and the basic hydrological \ndata of hydrological stations at state level collected by MWR, are available to all users. MWR, \nSWRC, and the provinces and region have agreed that water data in the project area will be \nfreely available from the start of project implementation. \n \n42.  Implementation of the ongoing flood damage rehabilitation project (footnote 2) in the two \nprovinces and autonomous region has proceeded well. It has shown that these instrumentalities \nhave the capacity to implement a major project in the sector. ADB\u2019s most recent review mission \nfound physical progress to be ahead of schedule and 70-99 percent completion for all works in \nan  elapsed  loan  time  period  of  81  percent.  There  were  no  outstanding  issues  relating  to \ncompliance with the loan covenants. This experience, combined with the hard lessons of the \n1998 floods, has given the authorities the incentive to improve their cooperation in the future. A \nflood control headquarters has already been established in SWRC and provides the springboard \nfor the Project to further strengthen institutional capacity.  \n \n43.  Under the Yellow River Flood Management Sector Project, an associated TA on a \nstrategic planning study for the preparation of the Yellow River Law will assist in setting out the \nprinciples and procedures for integrated river basin management in the Yellow River. The \nGovernment places a high priority on devising policy, institutional, and operational innovations in \nlarger river systems so that their lessons can benefit other river systems, such as the Songhua \nRiver.  \n \n44.  SWRC and the other agencies are aware of the criteria for selecting the proposed \nsubprojects, which are based primarily on the Yellow River project and were agreed upon with \nADB.  There  is  little  apparent  risk  of  delayed  implementation,  since  the  provinces  and \nautonomous region have experienced working with ADB and have smoothly implemented the \nongoing  three  emergency  loans.  Although  SWRC  has  no  experience  with  foreign-funded \nprojects, it has the backing of MWR, including additional experienced staff who have been \nprovided.  Project  assistance  will  be  needed  for  preparing  (i)  the  initial  environmental \nexamination/environmental impact assessment (IEE/EIA) for each subproject; (ii) resettlement \nplans (RPs) for subprojects if land acquisition and resettlement are required; and (iii) tender \ndocuments, evaluation reports, and disbursement documents necessary for ADB. Training will \nbe given to SWRC\u2019s project management office (PMO) and the PMO staff through on-the-job-\ntraining in preparing these documents. International and domestic consultants who are familiar \nwith ADB procedures will be recruited under the Project. ", "  13\nE.  ADB's Country Strategy \n \n45.  ADB\u2019s  strategic  objectives  for  the  PRC  are  to  (i)  improve  economic  efficiency,  (ii) \npromote  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty  in  the  inland  provinces,  and  (iii)  enhance \nenvironmental protection and natural resources management. ADB\u2019s strategic actions in the \nenvironment include (i) building institutional capacity; (ii) improving the policy, legal, regulatory, \nand  management  systems;  (iii)  promoting  cleaner  technologies;  (iv)  supporting  the  use  of \neconomic  measures,  supply-side  measures,  and  other  measures  to  protect  and  ensure \nsustainable use of natural resources; and (v) promoting environmentally sustainable agricultural \nand natural resource management practice. The Project will address both ADB\u2019s strategic and \nenvironmental objectives in the water sector. \n \n46.  In line with ADB\u2019s water policy, the Project is promoting an integrated water resources \nmanagement approach.32 The policy emphasizes that water is a socially vital economic good \nthat needs careful management to sustain equitable economic growth and reduce poverty. \nConserving and protecting water resources through a participatory approach and following \nprinciples of integrated water resources management are at the heart of the policy.33 \n \n47.  Sector capacities require strengthening. The policy environment, the sector institutions, \nand the human resources working in the sector all need upgrading. Relevant public and private \norganizations,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  community  organizations  need  help  with \ninstitutional development, water policy formulation, legislation, water resource planning, real-\ntime  management  of  basin  operations,  data  management  and  interpretation,  simulation \nmodeling  and  other  analytical  techniques,  socioeconomic  analysis,  community  skills,  and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E).  ADB  will  help  determine  priorities  and  selectively  assist \nthrough  a  process  of  monitoring,  training,  research,  and  feedback.  Good  practices  will  be \ninterchanged and agencies will be encouraged to adopt systems of incentives that create the \ndemand from the public for improved capacity. \n \nF.  Policy Dialogue \n \n48.  An array of policy issues similar to those relating to the Yellow River project is relevant in \nthe Songhua River basin. The following section draws on some of the material presented in the \nYellow River Report and Recommendation of the President, but adds new material to reflect the \ndifferences between the two basins. One key difference is the provincial ownership of the \nassets, and provincial responsibility for financing recurrent costs in the project area. In the \nYellow River project, these matters are basically the concern of the central Government (i.e., \nMWR) and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission. For smaller river basin commissions \n(e.g.,  for  the  Hai,  Huai,  and  Pearl  river  systems),  decentralized  ownership  and  financial \nresponsibilities exist.  \n \n1.  Comprehensive Basin Management  \n \n49.  Under  decentralized  ownership  and  financial  responsibility,  effective  water  policy \nplanning and implementation involve institutions from the provincial/autonomous region, county, \nmunicipality, and prefecture levels. The Project\u2019s institutional design addresses obstacles to \n                                                 \n32\n R230-00: Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. 16 January 2001. \n33\n Integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM)  is  the  process  to  improve  the  planning,  conservation, \ndevelopment, and management of water, forest, land, and aquatic resources in the river basin context, to maximize \neconomic benefits and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital \nenvironmental systems.  ", "  14\neffective integrated river basin management; it will develop effective cross-sectoral coordination \nmechanisms. The Project will do this by (i) using the current mechanism of senior officials \nmeeting at minister/governor level to discuss key issues at least once a year; (ii) establishing \nand supporting a high-level policy formulation committee with representatives of the river basin \nstakeholders;34 (iii)  transferring  experienced  MWR  staff  and  provincial  staff  to  SWRC  to \nstrengthen SWRC\u2019s capacity; (iv) developing a computer-assisted flood management system, \nwith related equipment and other nonstructural capacity to build the capacity to plan and reduce \nfuture flood risk, and create the opportunity for SWRC to play a more effective coordinating and \nplanning  role;  (v)  formulating  a  timebound  action  plan  to  identify  areas  of  overlapping  or \nconflicting  jurisdiction  and  impediments  to  coordination  between  SWRC  and  the  local \ngovernments and propose solutions; and (vi) having SWRC develop and implement \u201cgood \ngovernance\u201d principles with respect to flood management policy planning and implementation, \nincluding representation of the provincial and regional governments on SWRC, updating the \nriver  basin  flood  management  plan  every  five  years,  public  participation  in  planning  and \nimplementing decisions, and developing public awareness programs.   \n \n50.  The  TA  for  strategic  options  in  the  water  sector  (footnote  20)  recommended  the \nestablishment of a national water resources coordinating committee to direct and supervise new \ninitiatives in the water sector, including comprehensive basin management. The Government \naccepted  the  recommendation  and  intends  to  establish  a  water  resource  management \ncommittee, which was endorsed during an NPC conference in March 2001. A related issue \nconcerns the role of wetlands in comprehensive flood management. The GEF cofinancing for \nthe project preparatory TA significantly raised the profile of such matters in the project area. \nADB has programmed a TA in 2002 to design a loan project for the Sanjiang Plain in 2004.  \n \n2.  Legal and Regulatory Framework for Water Basin Management  \n \n51.  Environmental management, including planning for conservation of natural resources \nand protection of water resources, is a relatively recent concern in the PRC. Under the Project, \nthe current flood management regulations and enforcement provisions in the basin will be \nstrengthened.  This  work  will  advance  ADB\u2019s  previous  assistance  to  strengthen  the  legal \nframework, e.g., ADB helped train the staff of the Environmental Protection Commission of NPC \nand assisted in drafting and revising some of the PRC's environmental laws.35 ADB is helping to \npromote an effective legal/regulatory framework for environmental protection that is responsive \nto  the  PRC's  transition  to  a  market  economy  and  adheres  to  international  environmental \nprotection agreements (footnote 19). Further TA for legislative support for the water sector has \nbeen programmed for 2004.   \n \n52.  A  key  area  in  ADB's  policy  agenda  in  the  PRC  is  the  problem  of  transboundary \npollution.36  ADB  is  helping  to  strengthen   institutions   and   address   transjurisdictional  \n \n \n                                                 \n34\n This committee will formulate the flood management policies for the Songhua River Basin based on national \nguidelines,  and  determine  responsibility  for  planning  structural  and  nonstructural  projects  and  formulating \nmeasures in water resources use and allocation, and water quality protection.  \n35\n TA 2090-PRC: Legislative Planning and Procedures for the Protection of the Environment, for $393,000, approved \non 26 April 1994; TA 2735-PRC: Capacity Building for Natural Resources Legislation, for $800,000, approved on \n24 December 1996; and TA 3123-PRC: Provincial Legislation on Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, \nfor $300,000, approved on 15 December 1998. \n36\n TA 3588-PRC: Transjurisdiction Environment Management (TA cluster), for $2,100,000, approved on 11 December \n2000.   ", "  15\nenvironmental management issues, with particular emphasis on pollution in the Yellow River.37  \n \n  3.  Cost Recovery Mechanisms  \n \n53.  Under the centrally planned system, water was viewed as a free public good. Price \nsignals were not used to ration a scarce resource and to provide incentives to conserve and \nreuse  water.  Cost  recovery  techniques  were  not  used  to  generate  funds  for  investment, \noperation,  and  maintenance.  Thus,  pricing  and  cost  recovery  mechanisms  have  been  a \nconstant theme of ADB\u2019s policy dialogue in the water sector. The PRC\u2019s policy to levy a fee for \nthe construction and maintenance of water resources infrastructure, including flood control \ninfrastructure, is set out in the Administrative Method for Collection and Utilization of the Water \nResources Construction Fund (GF [1997] No. 7) and the subsequent Reply to Some Issues on \nCollection of Funds for Water Conservancy Construction (CZ [1998] No. 135), both issued by \nthe State Council. Instructions for their implementation have been issued. Jilin introduced a \nWater Resources Construction Fund (1 January 1997 to 31 December 2010), together with a \nConstruction Fund for Flood Control Infrastructure effective for a similar period. Heilongjiang \nestablished a Water Resources Construction Fund (1 January 1998 to 31 December 2010) and \na Flood Control Infrastructure Fund (1 January 1999 to 31 December 2010). Inner Mongolia has \nintroduced  a  Water  Resources  Construction  Fund,  but  is  still  to  issue  the  instructions  for \nestablishing a flood control infrastructure fund. \n \n54.  For  the  Water  Resources  Construction  Fund,  separate  funds  are  collected  at  the \nprovince, prefecture, city, and county levels. At the provincial level, the fund is financed by a 3 \npercent levy on vehicle tolls collected by the Provincial Highways Administration Bureau and \nfrom the electric power construction fund collected by the Provincial Electric Power Bureau. At \nthe prefecture, city, and county levels, the fund is financed by a similar 3 percent levy on vehicle \ntoll charges together with levies on drivers\u2019 training fees and municipal administration facilities. \nIn addition, 15 percent is drawn from the municipal maintenance and construction tax collected \nby cities and counties with key flood control duties. The Water Resources Construction Fund is \nused with other funds for new water resources projects as well as repair and maintenance.  \n \n55.  The  Construction  Fund  for  Flood  Control  Infrastructure  is  similarly  collected  at  the \nprovince, prefecture, city, and county levels. It is financed through a levy on all institutions and \nindividual business operators that have sole or business income in the previous year, on non-\nagricultural land acquisition, and urban and rural people. For loss-incurring enterprises, the fee \ncan be paid by contributions of labor or goods. The funds are collected by local tax, industrial \nand  commercial,  land  administration  departments  or  by  the  Provincial  Tax  Bureau  for \nenterprises directly under the central Government. The flood control fund must be used for its \nspecial purpose and the annual balance can be carried over to the following year. It can be used \nto construct dikes, reinforce reservoirs, supplement funds for key flood control works, and cover \noperational costs of flood control structures. \n \n56.  In Heilongjiang, about Y82 million annually is collected and the main expenditure has \nbeen the Nierji water resources project, absorbing about Y40 million; the remaining Y40 million \nhas been spent on flood structures maintenance and construction. In Jilin, Y70 million-Y80 \n                                                 \n37\n The Yellow River case study will be used to strengthen the transjurisdictional environmental management system \nin the six other major river systems as well as minor river systems affecting two or more provinces. One of the \nmajor pollution problems in the PRC is pollution from nonpoint sources. Fertilizers and pesticides are overapplied \nin the PRC and the runoff pollutes lakes and rivers. This issue was discussed during the 2001 China Council for \nInternational Cooperation on Environment and Development meeting and an advisory TA has been programmed \nfor 2002.  ", "  16\nmillion is collected annually, of which Y60 million-Y70 million is spent on maintenance and the \nremainder for preparing flood control projects. Inner Mongolia collects Y2 million-Y5 million a \nyear for flood control, and maintenance and construction of small-size water resources works. \nThe  Project  will  assist  in  strengthening  mechanisms  for  collecting  levies  and  for  making \nallocations for operation and maintenance (O&M), including information on relevant international \nbest practices. Since the guidelines stipulate only the principle of the need to raise funds from \nbeneficiaries, developing and improving the actual mechanisms should be left to the provincial, \nprefecture, city, and county governments.   \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n57.  Floods have produced some of the PRC\u2019s worst natural disasters. Despite significant \nconstruction  in  modern  times,  many  older  works  fail  during  major  floods,  and  system \nmaintenance  has  been  inadequate.  The  general  standard  of  flood  protection  is  only  the \nequivalent of about a 20-year flood recurrence, whereas the design standard is to protect \nagainst a 100-200 year flood for important cities and 35-50 years in rural areas. Many dams and \nreservoirs for irrigation, water supply, and flood control require remedial work to ensure their \ncontinued functioning and safety. An increasing population and development in flood-prone \nareas have significantly increased the flood risk. The Government supports a shift in focus from \nflood control only to an approach that emphasizes flood management through integrated land \nand water resources management, optimal water management throughout river basins, flood \nprotection measures, and complementary flood forecasting and warning systems. Improving \ninstitutional capacity to adopt an integrated approach is a vital concern of the Government. \n \n58.  The worst flood in over 200 years hit the Songhua River basin in 1998. It threatened the \n3 million people living in Harbin, severely affected other urban and rural areas, and caused loss \nof life and damage to property and infrastructure equivalent to $7.3 billion. The poor suffered the \nmost due to their location in less well protected areas and weaker access to services. Dikes \nneed major repair and maintenance at vulnerable points along the Songhua, Nen, and related \nrivers, and works are needed to protect major cities such as Harbin, Changchun, and Jilin. The \ndikes around flood detention basins need strengthening to reduce the risk of failure, and the \nnatural function of wetland areas to absorb floodwaters and maintain local ecosystems must be \nrestored. Nonstructural measures, including flood forecasting and early warning systems, and \nimproved public information on the river basin itself, are needed in developing an integrated \napproach to sustainable flood management. Institutional strengthening, especially of SWRC, is \na priority for a basinwide approach.  \n \n59.  The Government\u2019s 10th Five-Year Plan and MWR\u2019s Program for 2015 for the Songhua \nRiver basin provide the strategic direction for implementing flood management in the project \narea. The governments of Heilongjiang and Jilin and the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia \nare experienced in flood control and have the necessary capability to implement the proposed \nProject.38 Many relatively small-scale subprojects are dispersed throughout the basin and will be \ndeveloped in stages. ADB\u2019s sector loan modality is appropriate for a project that comprises \nseveral core subprojects and about 23 subprojects to be identified and appraised in the course \nof implementation. A sector plan exists in the document Some Suggestions on Improvement of \nFlood Control Construction of the Nen River and Songhua River in the Short Term, which was \napproved by MWR and endorsed by the State Council after the 1998 flood. The Project qualifies \n                                                 \n38\n Under the ongoing Northeast Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project (footnote 2), the three governments are \nperforming well as the executing agencies for works in their respective areas.  ", "  17\nfor this modality given that a sector plan exists, the institutions have adequate capacity (despite \nthe need to strengthen SWRC and build nonstructural work capacity), and there is scope for \nimproving the relevant policy framework. The sector loan approach will provide the necessary \nframework  for  preparing,  appraising,  and  implementing  subprojects  in  a  phased  manner, \nconsistent with local implementation capacity.  \n \nB.  Objective and Scope \n \n60.  The overall goal of the Project is to improve people\u2019s lives and to promote sustainable \neconomic growth through improved river basin management and reduced flood risk in the \nSonghua River basin. The objective is to reduce flood damage in the Songhua River basin \nthrough integrated river basin management and improved flood protection. Structural flood \ncontrol measures implemented under the Project will enable the Songhua River to convey \nfloods up to the design standard, thereby ensuring that a flood equivalent to that of 1998 could \nbe conveyed through the river system. A flood control command system (incorporating flood \nforecasting and warning systems) will be implemented to facilitate coordinated flood emergency \nresponse. The capability of SWRC will be improved through training and capacity building to \nenable it to assume its full role as an integrated water resources planner and manager of the \nSonghua River basin. The details of the Project\u2019s goal, objectives, and scope are in Appendix 1. \n \n  1.  Flood Management System \n \n61.  Nonstructural measures are essential for improved flood control in the Songhua River \nbasin. The Project will strengthen the institutional capacity of SWRC to facilitate preparation and \nimplementation  of  an  integrated  and  basinwide  approach  to  the  management  of  floods. \nGeographic information and flood forecasting sub-systems will be designed and implemented to \nbuild a fully functional and basinwide flood control command and decision support system, \ncombining  telemetry,  teletransmission,  flood  forecasting,  and  early  warning  features.  The \nProject will provide all necessary hardware, software, and databases to cover all types of flood \nsituations. One flood control command center will be managed by SWRC and another will be \nmanaged by each province and the autonomous region. Coordinating the system will be a key \nfunction of SWRC. Hydrological stations and workstations will be established in each province \nand the autonomous region. A public information center will be set up in SWRC and the existing \nweb site will be upgraded to improve communication with the public. SWRC\u2019s staffing will be \nstrengthened through the transfer of four experienced staff from MWR and the provinces and \nthe autonomous region and through training offered under the Project. A mathematical hydraulic \nmodeling and decision support system will be prepared from which maps showing the likely \nimpact of floods of various magnitudes (1:20 years to 1:100 years) and plans/zoning will be \nderived (Appendix 1). The focus will be on floodplain areas that were inundated in the 1998 \nflood.39 \n \n  2.  Flood Control Works \n \n62.  Structural flood control measures up to the national design standards will be undertaken \nto  enable  the  Songhua  River  to  convey  with  minimal  damage  floods  equivalent  to  that \nexperienced in 1998. Flood control works will include (i) strengthening the existing flood control \ndikes, and in some cases raising the dike level; (ii) constructing new flood control dikes; (iii) \nadopting  measures  (such  as  improved  slope  protection,  seepage  control,  and  foundation \nimprovements)  to  increase  the  safety  of  flood  control  dikes;  (iv)  constructing  flow  control \n                                                 \n39\n The existing Fengman Reservoir (Jilin Province) and the proposed Nierji Reservoir (Heilongjiang Province) have \ntheir own flood forecasting capacity. These will be linked with the Project to provide an integrated system. ", "  18\nstructures and associated works to increase the flood storage capacity of flood detention basins; \nand (v) rehabilitating reservoirs and related structures for water storage, as well as for wetland \nrehabilitation. Major cities (e.g., Harbin, Changchun, Jilin, and Ulanhot), strategic assets such as \nthe Daqing oil fields, nature reserves of major significance, and selected rural areas will be \ncovered. In aggregate, about 470 km of dikes, 8.5 million m3 of reservoir capacity (with a \nwatershed area of 1,533 km2), and 850 km2 of wetland areas will be rehabilitated, strengthened, \nor constructed (Appendix 3). Jilin and Inner Mongolia have agreed to give priority to these \nwatersheds in their ongoing soil conservation and reforestation programs.  \n \n63.  Three  core  subprojects  (Appendix  4)  to  be  undertaken  reflect  the  variety  of  the \nproblems, locations, scale of works, accessibility, and urgency. \n \n(i)  Qunli dike is located at the new development zone in the western part of Harbin. \nIt  will  protect  the  area  planned  for  the  city\u2019s  expansion.  The  work  involves \nupgrading  an  existing  dike,  constructing  a  new  dike  and  several  temporary \naccess  roads,  and  excavating  construction  material.  The  subproject  will  (a) \nreinforce about 3.3 km of existing dike, (b) construct 10.2 km of new dike, (c) \nprovide riverbank protection (840 m), (d) plant a 30 m wide protection forest belt \nalong the dike works, (e) provide 10.75 km of slope protection, and (f) upgrade \noutlet structures. \n \n(ii)  Xianghai reservoir supplies water for the Xianghai National Nature Reserve Area, \na grade A nature reserve of international significance, which attracts tourists from \nabroad and domestically. The reservoir protects and increases wetland storage \ncapacity to supplement water for downstream reservoirs, and wetland areas and \nhabitats of national rare wildlife and plants. Several safety issues need to be \naddressed: (a) raise the original design crest by 0.97 m, (b) reinforce or rebuild \nthe upstream protection slopes of both the main dam (480 m) and auxiliary dikes \n(6.4 km), (c) demolish and rebuild three seriously damaged water discharge \nsluices, (d) control seepage, (e) expand and raise the selected reservoir banks \nand construct a new auxiliary dike, (f) build two access bridges, and (g) replace \naging flood control telecommunication facilities. \n \n(iii)  Du\u2019erbenxin dike is 29.9 km long, and is along the Nen River\u2019s mainstream at the \nconfluence  of  the  Chao\u2019er  and  Yalu  rivers.  Flood  disasters  not  only  cause \nproperty losses but also have adverse social impacts on an important minority \ngroup. There are three main components: (a) foundations will be upgraded and \ndikes will be raised and widened so that their flood standards will decrease the \nfrequency  of  flooding  from  1:20  years  to  1:35  years,  and  seepage  will  be \ncontrolled; (b) two utility crossings and three outlet structures will be constructed; \nand (c) all sections will be provided with slope protection and seepage control to \nguarantee their safety and stabilization. \n \n  3.  Capacity Building and Project Management \n \n64.  A  central  project  coordination  office  (CPCO)  has  been  established  in  SWRC \n(Changchun)  for  overall  implementation  of  the  flood  management  system  and  overall \ncoordination of the Project. Three PMOs of the provinces and autonomous region have also \nbeen set up in Harbin, Changchun, and Hohot. Responsibility for planning and implementing the \nProject will be delegated to them by the Leading Group in each province and autonomous \nregion.  The  three  provincial  PMOs  will  be  responsible  for  the  structural  subprojects;  the ", "  19\ninfrastructure of the flood management system in the provinces and autonomous region (center, \nsubcenters, and stations); structural subproject feasibility studies; tender documents, contract \npreparation,  and  negotiation;  works  supervision  and  acceptance;  technical  support  to \nsubprojects; and preparation of quarterly progress reports to the CPCO. Working together, the \nCPCO and the PMOs will regularly communicate and meet quarterly to coordinate their work. \nClose coordination of planning and implementation work will require leadership. Under MWR\u2019s \npolicy document Directive on the Reform of River Basin Commissions (28 March 2001), a \nprincipal reform is to coordinate the work between SWRC and the provinces and autonomous \nregion. Specific coordination reforms under the Project are described in paras. 73 and 74.   \n \n65.  The social and environmental functions in the CPCO will be strengthened to assist the \nprovincial PMOs to undertake IEEs, environment management plans (EMPs) based on the \nIEEs, and RPs for the subprojects. International and domestic consultants will support the \nPMOs for quality control of subproject design and implementation, training, and institutional \nstrengthening; and broaden SWRC\u2019s capacity for social and environmental work.  \n \n66.  Institutional  capacity  building  within  SWRC  and  the  provincial  PMOs  will  address \nintegrated river basin management, and training of staff to strengthen technical capabilities to \noperate and maintain the decision support system. Measures to improve the exchange of \ninformation between the CPCO and the provincial PMOs will also be developed.  \n \nC.  Cost Estimates \n \n67.  The total project cost is estimated at $357.7 million equivalent, comprising $134 million \nin foreign exchange (37 percent of total cost) and $223.7 million equivalent in local currency \ncosts including taxes and duties. Cost estimates are summarized in Table 1 and details are in \nAppendix 5. \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n    Foreign  Local    Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Financing Plan \n \n68.  The Government has requested a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0 percent (the fee \nwill be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan ", "  20\nand Project Agreements. Local currency costs will be financed by the central Government, \nprovincial and local governments, and ADB ($223.7 million equivalent). The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2; details are in Appendix 5. ADB \nfinancing is 41.9 percent of total cost, well under the maximum 60 percent allowed by ADB \npolicy. The central and provincial and regional governments contribute 2.9 percent and 2.5 \npercent, respectively, and local governments/communities contribute 52.7 percent of overall \nfinancing. The provinces and the autonomous region have given strong financial commitment to \ncover provincial PMO and recurrent cost responsibilities in each area, through existing and \nenhanced cost recovery measures.40 However, in more remote and poor rural locations, the \nrevenue base of local governments is highly constrained and these authorities face difficulty in \nfinancing new assets (such as flood protection dikes or water storage reservoirs), unlike the \nmajor cities such as Harbin or Changchun that are wealthier. For the poor rural locations, the \nGovernment  strongly  requested  local  cost  financing  of  $16  million  from  ADB.  Of  the  26 \nsubprojects, 17 qualify for local cost financing support from the ADB loan on the basis of the \ncentral Government\u2019s assessment of weaknesses in the fiscal situation of the concerned local \ngovernment and the socioeconomic assessments (including initial social assessments) made \nduring project preparation. Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the poorest of the three areas, \nis the main beneficiary of local cost financing.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Percent \n           \nAsian Development Bank          134.0       16.0       150.0         41.9 \nCentral Government         10.5         10.5           2.9 \nProvincial/Regional Governments           8.7           8.7           2.5 \nLocal Governments/Communities               0.0     188.5       188.5         52.7 \nTotal          134.0     223.7       357.7       100.0 \n           \n \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nE.  Executing and Implementing Agencies \n \n69.  There will be four executing agencies (EAs) for the Project. MWR will be the EA for the \nflood management system (component 1). In each province and the autonomous region, the EA \nwill be the relevant provincial-level government.41 MWR will delegate authority to SWRC, which \nhas established a CPCO that is adequately staffed with qualified full-time staff and resources. \nThrough the CPCO, SWRC will be the Implementing Agency (IA) for the flood management \nsystem, including the Songhua River Flood Control Center. \n \n70.  The  EAs  of  the  two  provinces  and  autonomous  region  have  already  established  a \nprovincial Leading Group (PLG) headed by a vice-governor of the province or region. Each PLG \n                                                 \n40\n For  example,  Provincial  regulation.  1998.  \u201cRules  for  Implementation  of  Fund  Collection,  Utilization  and \nManagement for Water Management Construction in Heilongjiang Province.\u201d Similar regulations exist for Jilin. Inner \nMongolia has indicated its intention to expand such measures, based on the experience of the provinces and the \nadvice of the project preparatory TA team. \n41\n Loan funds from ADB will be allocated to the two provinces (Heilongjiang and Jilin) and the Inner Mongolia \nAutonomous Region, in accordance with the agreed-upon scope of work in each of the three regions.   ", "  21\ncomprises  senior  representatives  of  the  Planning  Commission,  Finance  Bureau,  Water \nResources Bureau, SWRC, and other relevant agencies. The PLG will be assisted by the PMO \nin each province or region headed by a senior staff member, appointed by the province. The \nPMO head will also be a member of the PLG. The PMO will be adequately staffed by qualified \nfull-time staff from the bureaus represented on the PLG and will be responsible for coordinating \nthe work programs in their respective areas (Appendix 6). \n \n71.  The local Leading Group (LLG) will supervise implementation of subprojects prepared by \nthe local government (league, municipality, city, and county).  The LLG will be headed by the \nvice  mayor  (or  equivalent)  and  will  be  staffed  by  representatives  from  the  local  planning \ncommission  and  the  finance,  water  resources,  and  urban  construction  bureaus.  The  local \ngovernments will undertake resettlement activities including public consultation, M&E, grievance \nresolution, relocation management, and administration of livelihood restitution. Training and \nconsulting inputs will further strengthen the capacity of the local governments. \n \n72.  The  provincial/regional  implementing  agencies  will  comprise  the  relevant  local \ngovernment agencies, including the planning, finance, water resources, and other relevant \nagencies. For each subproject, a project implementation unit (PIU) will be established in the \nWater Resources Bureau or Construction Bureau of the prefecture/municipality and city/county \nwhere the subproject is to be implemented. \n  \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.  Coordination \n \n73.  A project steering committee comprising the State Development Planning Commission \n(SDPC), the Ministry of Finance, and MWR will coordinate the Project at the national level. The \ncommittee will monitor progress, coordinate activities involving state ministries and agencies, \nand resolve any conflicts or potential problems or cause of delay. It will meet at least once a \nyear. Following the disastrous 1998 flood, which initiated MWR policy documents such as Some \nSuggestions\u2026 and Directive on the Reform of River Basin Commissions, the vital role of good \ncoordination of the various agencies and the provinces and autonomous region has become an \nimportant priority.42 As a result, the Songhua River flood control headquarter (SFCH) was \napproved  by  the  State  Flood  Control  and  Drought  Relief  Headquarter  (SFCDRH)  on  9 \nNovember  2001  (SFCDRH  Document  no.  2001[10]).  SFCH  will  comprise  the  governor  of \nHeilongjiang Province (chairman), the vice governors of Jilin Province and Inner Mongolia \nAutonomous  Region,  the  chairman  and  vice  chairman  of  SWRC,  the  directors  of  the \nprovincial/regional water resources bureaus, the directors of the Northeast Division of State \nPower Company, Heilongjiang Power Company, and Jilin Power Company. The office of SFCH \nwill  be  in  SWRC.43 In  addition,  SWRC  and  the  EAs  will  strengthen  intergovernmental \ncoordination,  cooperation,  and  integrated  river  basin  management.  Responsibility  will  be \nassigned for areas of overlapping or conflicting jurisdiction, and impediments to coordination \nbetween SWRC and the local governments will be identified. These may include the imposition \nof charges for the exchange of information (e.g., for hydrological and rainfall data). \n \n                                                 \n42\n A key lesson of the 1998 flood was that if coordination of efforts and exchange of information between the \nprovinces/autonomous region had been more effective, losses would have been less. \n43\n SFCH will meet and hold workshops at least once in the first year of the Project, once immediately before the \nmidterm review and once in the final year of implementation. Project staff and consultants will give an orientation \nseminar in the first year to assist SFCH. ", "  22\n74.  MWR through SWRC will provide technical guidance for flood preparedness during \nproject implementation, monitor project benefits, and report to ADB. SWRC will coordinate and \nliaise with provincial PMOs, Government, and ADB; and coordinate progress reports from the \nprovincial  PMOs  to  the  Government  and  ADB.  Provincial  PMOs  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing structural subprojects; the infrastructure of the flood management system in their \nprovinces and autonomous region; structural subproject feasibility studies; tender documents, \ncontract preparation, and negotiation; works supervision and acceptance; provision of technical \nsupport to subprojects; and preparation of quarterly progress reports to the CPCO. SDPC and \nMWR will review and approve all subproject feasibility studies. For subprojects requiring ADB's \napproval, such approval will be obtained before tendering and contract award for the subproject. \nFor other subprojects, tendering and contract award may start after approval of the feasibility \nstudies by SDPC and MWR. The feasibility studies will be submitted to ADB for information. \n \n  2.  Selection and Preparation of Subprojects \n \n75.  Structural subprojects may comprise (i) flood control dikes; (ii) gates for diverting river \nwater to wetlands; (iii) rehabilitation of unsafe reservoirs; (iv) wetland improvement; (v) flood \nstorage and retention basins; (vi) related structures including bridges, and flow control devices; \nand  (vii)  pumps,  motors,  and  other  electromechanical  equipment  associated  with  flood \nprotection infrastructure. The structural subprojects to be implemented under component 2, \nsubject to the availability of ADB loan proceeds, are listed in Appendix 3. \n \n76.  Structural subprojects must \n \n(i)  conform with the overall flood management plan for the river basin and meet all \ntechnical requirements with respect to design standards and consistency with \nother works being implemented under the Project; \n(ii)  have an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of not less than 12 percent; \n(iii)  benefit a large number of residents, particularly those in national and provincial \npoverty counties; \n(iv)  be  demonstrably  free  of  negative  environmental  impacts,  with  any  potential \nnegative  impacts  that  can  be  mitigated  to  a  satisfactory  level  through \nincorporation of minor design changes; \n(v)  comprise works that can be completed within the project implementation period; \nand \n(vi)  comply with relevant PRC laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s policies/procedures \non social development, resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \n77.  In selecting structural subprojects other than for the three core subprojects, priority will \nbe given to subprojects that (i) have a high ratio of number of direct beneficiaries to cost, (ii) are \nlocated in areas with higher incidence of poverty than the average for the project area, (iii) have \nno  major  negative  environmental  impact,  and  (iv)  involve  no  or  minimal  involuntary  land \nacquisition or resettlement. The feasibility study for each subproject, including its IEE (and the \nenvironmental management plan), RP (if required), detailed costs, economic analysis, social \nanalysis, and design drawings, will be prepared by the responsible provincial or regional PMO in \ncollaboration with the local IAs. The consultants and staff of the responsible EA will review the \nreport,  before  submitting  it  to  China  International  Engineering  and  Consulting  Corporation \n(CIECC) for appraisal. Subproject feasibility studies must be reviewed and approved by SDPC \nand MWR before tendering and contract award. \n ", "  23\n78.  A subproject must be approved by ADB before tendering, contract award, or any other \nimplementation activity, if (i) an RP is required, (ii) an EIA (for a category A subproject) is \nrequired, or (iii) the estimated total cost of the subproject is more than $10 million equivalent. In \nsuch cases, ADB approval will be subject to receipt of an acceptable subproject feasibility report \ndescribing (i) justification for the subproject (including an estimate of the number of beneficiaries \nand  the  expected  impacts  on  the  different  types  or  classes  of  beneficiaries);  (ii)  any \nenvironmental  impacts,  the  need  or  otherwise  for  preparing  a  full  EIA,  and  the  mitigation \nmeasures  to  be  undertaken  pursuant  to  the  EIA;  (iii)  an  initial  social  assessment,  land \nacquisition and an RP, which is made publicly available, covering any resettlement that may be \nrequired  (Appendix  7);  (iv)  any  consultations  that  have  taken  place  between  the  local \ngovernment agencies and the affected communities (including the description of any adverse \nsocial impacts and the proposals for overcoming or reducing them to an acceptable level); (v) \nthe  nature  and  scope  of  works;  (vi)  detailed  cost  estimates;  (vii)  an  economic  analysis \ndemonstrating an EIRR of not less than 12 percent; (viii) procurement arrangements (including \nidentification  of  any  international  competitive  bidding  requirements);  (ix)  implementation \nschedule; (x) financing plan; and (xi) arrangements for financial control and auditing.  \n \n79.  In all other cases, tendering, contract award, or other implementation activity for a \nsubproject may take place with ex post facto approval by ADB, based on a feasibility study \n(para. 78) submitted to ADB within six months of the start of subproject implementation. ADB \nfinancing will, however, be subject to confirmation that any implementation activity undertaken \nwas done in accordance with ADB guidelines and requirements. Consultants will be recruited \nunder the Project to help the PMOs prepare the feasibility reports to the standard of detail and \ncompleteness required by ADB. \n \n  3.  Implementation Schedule \n \n80.  The Project will be implemented over a period of four years (Appendix 8). Project \nimplementation  is  expected  to  begin  in  April  2003  and  be  completed  by  June  2007.  To \naccelerate project implementation, the EAs have started the following preparatory activities: (i) \nselect  priority  subprojects  for  implementation  in  2003;  (ii)  prepare  feasibility  studies  plus \nrequired  IEEs  and  RPs  for  core  subprojects;  (iii)  conduct  surveys  and  investigations,  and \nprepare detailed designs, cost estimates, and tender documents; and (iv) process tenders for \nawarding contracts for works in 2003. \n \n  4.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n81.  For the Qunli dike core subproject, a resettlement policy framework and procedural \nguidelines  (PFPG)  and  a  full  RP  satisfying  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  were \nprepared (Appendix 7 and Supplementary Appendixes A and B). The provinces/autonomous \nregion have overall responsibility for acquiring land and resettling people for the Project. The \nIEE, the PFPG, and the Qunli RP have been disclosed to the public. The PFPG and the Qunli \ndike RP will be used as models for preparing RPs for future subprojects. For future subprojects, \nany land acquisition, compensation, and resettlement effects will be addressed, and full or short \nRPs  will  be  prepared  as  appropriate  to  the  magnitude  of  impact,  following  the  PFPG  in \nAppendix 7 and Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n82.  The 1998 Land Administration Law provides for disclosure and consultation with affected \npeople. The EAs have agreed to ensure that copies of the RP, in the Chinese language, are \nplaced in the township offices for perusal by affected people. The temporary resettlement offices \nand township governments will receive the comments of the affected people and address their ", "  24\nconcerns. There will be intensive consultation with all affected people during asset inventory \nand valuation at the household level. The provincial and autonomous region governments will \nensure  that  written  agreements  are  signed  with  each  affected  collective,  household,  and \nenterprise before construction begins. Details are in Appendix 7. \n \n  5.  Procurement \n \n    a.  Civil Works and Equipment \n \n83.  Goods and services for ADB-financed contracts will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Major  contracts  for  equipment  valued  at  $500,000 \nequivalent  or  more  will  be  awarded  through  ADB\u2019s  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB) \nprocedures. Smaller equipment packages, under $500,000 equivalent each, will be procured \nfollowing international shopping procedures. Direct purchase will be allowed for contracts valued \nat $100,000 equivalent or less. Civil works contracts estimated to cost $5 million or more will be \ncarried out using ICB procedures while those below $5 million equivalent will be carried out \nusing local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures in accordance with the Tendering and Bidding \nLaw,  and  related  regulations  that  are  being  drafted  with  ADB  assistance  and  ADB \nrequirements.44 The minimum period for international bid preparation will be 90 days and the \nminimum period for domestic bid preparation will be 30 days. Force account procedures will be \nselectively used, especially in isolated locations; the ceiling will be $2 million equivalent. Local \ncontractors have the necessary capacity to undertake these contracts. However, in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines for Procurement, foreign contractors may bid on contracts using LCB. \nIndicative procurement packages are given in Appendix 9. \n \n    b.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing \n \n84.  The  Government  requested,  and  ADB  approved,  advance  action  for  civil  works, \nprocurement, and recruitment of consultants up to contract signing. This request is justified by \nthe priority on strengthening major dikes that either were damaged or require strengthening \nafter the 1998 flood. ADB has also approved in principle retroactive financing up to $10 million \nequivalent for expenditures on core subprojects incurred from 21 October 2001 to the date of \nloan effectiveness.45 The Government has been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance action \nand retroactive financing does not constitute a commitment to finance the relevant expenditures \nunder the Project or the Project itself.     \n \n  6.  Consulting Services \n \n85.  Consultants will be selected and engaged through an international consulting firm in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nacceptable to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. The Project will require \n688  person-months  of  consulting  services:  80  international  and  608  domestic.  Of  these \nservices, 484 person-months (70 percent, comprising 51 international and 433 domestic) will be \nfor the flood management system. The consultants will provide assistance in the areas of a \ngeographic information system for flood control, mathematical flood model, flood forecasting, \nresearch into standards for major cities, a decision support system, and specifications and \nprocurement of the flood management system equipment. The consultants for the two other \n                                                 \n44\n The Project will consist of a large number of civil works contracts (mainly earth-related works) located in different \nparts of the project area. It is unlikely that international contractors will be interested in bidding for such contracts. A \nlarge number of domestic contractors are well qualified to undertake such work. \n45\n These actions were reported in the August 2002 Internet Edition of the ADB Business Opportunities. ", "  25\ncomponents (32 person-months international and 175 domestic) will support the monitoring of \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures,  resettlement  planning,  economic  analysis, \nproject/construction  management,  tender  documents,  contract  evaluation  and  subproject \ncommissioning, special assistance to Inner Mongolia in subproject identification and feasibility, \nand legal and regulatory aspects. The consultants will also offer on-the-job training, including \nthe economic analysis of subprojects. The international consultants will be recruited through an \ninternational  consulting  firm  selected  and  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-and-cost-based \nselection (QCBS) method. The required consulting services are shown in Appendix 10. \n \n86.  The international consultants will also work with SWRC to develop methods for social \nanalysis to select and prepare subprojects; to define the social costs and benefits of flood-\nrelated  problems;  to  select  options  with  minimum  social  costs;  and  to  prepare  IEEs,  land \nacquisition and resettlement plans with particular attention to livelihood restoration and methods \nfor  environmental  and  resettlement  M&E.  An  international  environment  specialist,  an \ninternational  social  and  resettlement  specialist,  and  a  project  economist,  each  providing  6 \nperson-months of services, will be required to work with the local sociologists, environmental \nspecialists, and economists.  A special feature of the work will be to build capacity to select, \nappraise, and prepare future subprojects. \n \n  7.  Training and Study Tours  \n \n87.  A training and study tour assessment report will be prepared early in implementation. A \ncoordinator for the logistical aspects will be assigned, while each expert in the various project \ncomponents will give assistance and inputs for this assessment in each field of expertise. \nConsulting services of 2-3 person-months will be needed for this. Training will be provided for \n200-250 staff in SWRC, the provinces and autonomous region, and selected local government \nofficials involved in implementing resettlement, environmental aspects, and economic evaluation \nof the candidate subprojects. National institutions with specific expertise to provide targeted \ntraining  inputs  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  selection  criteria  and \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  in  consultation  with  the  international  consultants. \nImplementation of the nonstructural measures for flood management involves research and \ndevelopment in methodology and adoption of new technologies tested elsewhere. Essential to \nthe activities are well-trained groups of staff at SWRC. A combination of on-the-job training and \nspecialized training conducted inside and outside the country will be used. Supplementary \nAppendix C contains the details, including the sources of training services. \n \n  8.  Imprest Account and Statement of Expenditures \n \n88.  To make adequate amounts of the loan proceeds available on a timely basis for the \nProject, SWRC and the finance department in each province and the autonomous region will \nestablish an imprest fund account for the Project. Each of the four imprest accounts will be \noperated and maintained in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January \n2001) and the statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures under ADB loans. The initial deposit \ninto each account will not exceed $3 million equivalent. ADB\u2019s SOE procedures may be used for \npayments from the imprest accounts to reimburse eligible expenditures and liquidate advances \nnot exceeding $100,000 equivalent per item of expenditure. \n \n  9.  Operation and Maintenance \n \n89.  All facilities and structures built and rehabilitated, including nonstructural activities under \nthe  Project  will  be  operated  and  maintained  by  the  IAs  during  implementation  and  after \ncompletion of the works through annual budgetary allocation. The operation and maintenance ", "  26\n(O&M) requirement per annum in 2001 prices will be Y8.3 million ($1 million equivalent) for the \nflood management system, and Y60.6 million ($7.3 million) for the flood control works. The local \ngovernments concerned are responsible for O&M from their own resources. At any time before \nand during project implementation, ADB may request copies of approved O&M budgets for \nworks and facilities to be financed under the Project. \n \n  10.  Governance and Anticorruption \n \n90.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to the central and \nlocal government officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption in ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement, particularly the need for bidders/suppliers/contractors to observe \nthe highest standards of ethics in procuring and executing ADB-financed contracts, and the \nsanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. Similarly, the anticorruption provisions added \nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were discussed. \n \n91.  The Government is increasingly concerned with governance issues and has conducted \nwell-publicized campaigns against official corruption. The Tendering and Bidding Law stipulates \nthat tender and bidding activities will follow the principles of openness, fairness, impartiality, and \ngood faith (Article 5). This law covers key construction projects funded by the State and all \nexternally funded projects. Article 6 stipulates that \u201cno organizations or persons shall, by any \nmeans, limit or exclude legal persons or other organizations outside from other regions or \nsystems from participating in the bidding procedure. No illegal interference in any form is \npermitted in the bidding process.\u201d Article 32 specifically prohibits bribes and collusion, while \nArticles 49-64 specify appropriate sanctions for all abuses of the law, including substantial fines \nand criminal prosecution. ADB is helping to develop the implementation regulations for the \nTendering and Bidding Law.46 \n \n  11.  Annual and Midterm Reviews \n \n92.  The Government and ADB will review project implementation annually. At the end of the \nsecond year, they will carry out a comprehensive midterm review of project achievements. The \nmidterm review critically assess the project objectives and scope, including physical progress, \npolicy agenda, and institutional performance; will determine whether the Project will achieve its \nintended objectives and benefits; and will take appropriate measures including modification of \ndesign and reallocation of resources as necessary. \n \n  12.  Project Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n93.  A set of indicators to estimate the project impact in relation to goals, purposes, outputs, \nand conditions is set out in Appendix 1. The main items include (i) economic development and \npoverty indicators in the project area; (ii) hydrological indicators such as frequency of flooding; \n(iii)  physical  progress  of  the  Project;  (iv)  social  impact  indicators,  including  progress  on \nrelocation and impact rehabilitation; and (v) cost recovery. The provincial and regional PMOs \nwill prepare and maintain records of such information for at least five years after the completion \nof civil works. SWRC will monitor and assess activities, and include the results in quarterly \nprogress reports to ADB. \n \n94.

The key PRA quantitative indicators will include agricultural and commercial \nproduction patterns, incomes and expenditure levels, poverty reduction effects though income \nand social capabilities, access to public and private technical social services and utilities, and \nvillage organization. An international specialist and domestic consultants will work together to \nadvise SWRC and PMOs on appropriate PRA methods and provide field training in applying \nthem during implementation of relevant project activities. Trainees will include relevant staff from \nthe  resettlement,  planning,  and  design  sections  of  SWRC  and  the  provincial  and  regional \nPMOs. The aim of this training and field application is to ensure that relevant PRA skills are \nidentified, understood, adapted, and incorporated into social survey working practice. Details of \nmeasures to adopt in compliance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement are given in \nAppendix 7.  \n \n  13.  Reports, Accounts, and Audits \n \n95.  Each EA will prepare quarterly progress reports indicating progress made, problems \nencountered during the period under review, steps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, \nthe proposed program of activities, and progress expected for the following quarter. The CPCO \nwill ensure that copies are consolidated and submitted to ADB. In addition to periodic reporting \nand monitoring, ADB and the Government will jointly review project implementation at least \nonce a year to identify and resolve major issues. \n \n96.  Within six months of physical completion of the Project, the CPCO, with support from the \nprovincial and autonomous region PMOs and MWR, will submit to ADB a completion report that \ndescribes implementation of the flood management system, subproject selection and design, \ninstitutional strengthening and water basin management reform, other project implementation \nmatters, actual costs incurred in relation to cost estimates, benefits, beneficiary consultations, \nand other information requested by ADB.  \n \n97.  Each EA will maintain separate records and accounts that will identify the goods and \nservices  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan,  the  financing  resources  received,  the \nexpenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. The account will be established \nand  maintained  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  The  annual  consolidated \nproject accounts and related financial statements for the EAs will be audited and translated by \nauditors acceptable to ADB.47 The audited reports and related financial statements will be \nsubmitted to ADB not later than nine months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. \nThe Government was informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts, which \ncovers failure in submitting audited accounts and financial statements within the due date. A \nformal warning will be issued for accounts more than six months overdue and disbursements \nwill be suspended for accounts that are 12 months overdue. \n \nG.  Environmental and Social Measures \n \n  1.  Environment \n \n98.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B  primarily  because  of  the \noccurrence of wetlands and need for population resettlement in the project area. The Xianghai \nreservoir rehabilitation subproject is situated in state-level forest and wildlife nature reserves at \nthe center of the Xianghai National Nature Reserve. The protection area has over 300 kinds of \nvertebrate wildlife, including 286 kinds of birds, of which 17 belong to national and globally \n                                                 \n47\n ADB is helping to strengthen the PRC's auditing procedures under TA 3103-PRC: Strengthening the Government \nAuditing System, for $700,000, approved on 26 November 1998. ", "  28\nprotected species. IEEs were prepared for the three core subprojects based on data collected \nduring  the  feasibility  studies,  review  of  related  reports,  and  consultations  with  concerned \ngovernment offices and affected communities. A summary IEE was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors on 17 August 2001. The IEE concluded that the negative environmental impacts \narising from construction and operation of project facilities can be mitigated to acceptable levels \nthrough implementation of mitigation measures, which will be monitored by an independent \ninstitution to be recruited under the Project. The IEE stated that EIA was not required for the \nthree core subprojects. The IEE reports (translated into the local language) have been available \nto the public and other interested parties in the Project\u2019s field offices in the provinces and \nautonomous region since December 2001. \n \n99.  The Project will have mostly positive environmental impacts. Through field visits and \ndiscussions with local environmental protection bureaus, it was concluded that the negative \nimpacts of the three core subprojects will be minor and short term, lasting only during the \nconstruction period. During the construction phase, most impacts will be related to access \nroads, construction sites, and labor camps. Temporary impacts on air and water quality will be \novercome as excavation and construction activities are completed and temporarily used areas \nrehabilitated. During operation, most of the main problems will be related to relatively minor \nsocial issues. The environmental mitigation measures and monitoring program are estimated to \ncost Y7 million or $0.8 million. Environmental impacts and proposed mitigation measures are \nidentified and developed in the draft SIEE (Supplementary Appendix D). \n \n100.  To  ensure  that  all  applicable  national,  provincial,  and  local  environmental  laws, \nregulations and standards, and ADB environmental requirements will be met during project \npreparation and implementation, SWRC assured that an environment and social division (ESD) \nwill be established within the CPCO. The Song-Liao River Basin Water Resources Protection \nBureau will monitor the environmental protection and mitigation measures.48 Monitoring will be \nreported to ADB through quarterly progress reports on project implementation, annual reports \non  environmental  monitoring,  and  an  evaluation  report  a  year  after  completion  of  each \nsubproject. ESD will guide candidate subprojects in preparing the IEE/EIA. In undertaking its \ntasks, ESD staff will coordinate with the State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) and \nlocal  environmental  protection  bureaus  in  the  provinces,  prefectures,  and  cities.  An \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan for the whole Project will be proposed before \nimplementing the Project. \n \n  2.  Social Analysis  \n \n101.  A range of data sources__national, provincial, and county/city yearbooks; agency annual \nreports; thematic maps; and specialist reports of initial overview__was utilized and compared to \nderive statistical overviews and a socioeconomic profile of the three core subproject sites. \nAgency and local leadership interviews, household sample surveys, and focus groups and \ngender-segregated group interviews with men and women in selected villages and urban areas \nwere also conducted.  \n \n102.  As noted in paras. 8-14, Heilongjiang and Jilin have well-developed industry, service \nsector, and agricultural economies, whereas Inner Mongolia is less developed with an economy \nprimarily based on agriculture, including grazing. There are 16 national poverty counties and 14 \nprovincial  poverty  counties  along  the  border  separating  Inner  Mongolia  from  Jilin  and \n                                                 \n48\n SWRPB is the management institute in the basin under the guidance of the Ministry of Water Resources and \nSEPA. ", "  29\nHeilongjiang.  This  area  is  highly  susceptible  to  flooding  by  the  Nen  River  and  its  major \ntributaries. Two core subprojects, the Du'erbenxin rural flood control dikes (Inner Mongolia), and \nthe Xianghai reservoir (Jilin) are in that area. Risks of floods have led to an unwillingness to \ninvest in community infrastructure, services, and farm production assets that might otherwise \nattract  entrepreneurs  or  support  self-funded  development;  low  farm  product  prices  and \nmarketing difficulties in the isolated areas present additional problems. \n \n103.  Central, provincial, and local governments have responded to the pockets of poverty \nthrough a number of policy measures including development of interarea linkages, engineering \nflood protection mechanisms, land improvement strategies, improved road infrastructure, and \nsupport to relieve poverty. However, funding shortfalls, limited development of stable local \nincome-earning opportunities, associated technical support, and credit availability continue to \nhamper poverty reduction in these areas. Communities of national minorities, especially of \nKorean and Mongol descent, are in the project areas and affected minorities will equally share \nbenefits with national majority populations. The three core subprojects have no direct negative \neffects on minorities, and so no indigenous people\u2019s development plan was required. However, \nin the event that a subproject with potentially negative impacts on a national minority is identified, \naction will be taken as required by ADB\u2019s indigenous people\u2019s policy. \n \nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION \n \nA.  Economic Evaluation \n \n104.  The Project will establish the capacity to manage floods in the basin to upgrade the \nexisting flood protection system that shields cities, major assets and industries, and supports \nthe  sustained  livelihoods  of  about  62  million  people  living  in  the  floodplain  areas.  Each \nsubproject will contribute to overall flood control in the basin as well as protection to locally \ninundated areas. In particular, major economic assets to be protected are in the cities of Harbin, \nChangchun,  Jilin,  and  Qiqihar,  and  the  Daqin  oil  fields.  Although  their  role  in  the  future \ndevelopment of the project area and in the reduction of poverty will be enhanced, this wider \naspect  has  been  excluded  from  the  analysis.  The  analyses  were  limited  to  direct  and \nquantifiable benefits from local flood protection and, in the case of the core reservoir subproject, \ndirect benefits from flood protection and incremental economic activities attributable to the \nimproved  reservoir  storage.  Economic  analyses  were  carried  out  for  the  three  core \nsubprojects__Du\u2019erbenxin dike, Qunli dike, and Xianghai reservoir__to evaluate the returns on \nproject investments to the economy (Appendix 11). The economic life of the project structures is \n40 years, including the construction period. A shadow exchange rate factor of 1.07 was applied \nto derive the economic cost and benefit streams. The economic wage rate of unskilled labor is \n90 percent of the financial wage rates. Estimated benefits from the subprojects were derived \nbased on avoidance of damage to existing assets, avoided disruptions to agricultural and \nindustrial production, and avoided emergency repairs of the dikes. Key assets in the flood-prone \nareas include standing crops, public infrastructure, and buildings (residential, commercial, and \nindustrial). The economic benefits for the Xianghai reservoir subproject reflect the benefits of \nflood protection, gains to wildlife protection that result from increased tourism activity in the \nsubproject area, and the benefits from increased water storage, which will reduce the risk of \nflooding  and  increase  production.  The  subproject  will  also  yield  substantial  environmental \nbenefits from an improved wetland area and limited flood protection for the overall floodplain, \nbut these benefits were not quantified. \n \n105.  To calculate the EIRRs, core subproject benefits were annualized by adjusting the total \nestimated flood damages by the probabilities of floods, under the with-project and without-", "  30\nproject scenarios. The magnitude of damage in the subproject areas was adjusted according to \nthe expected levels of inundation as indicated by the involved design institutes.49 For the rural \nflood-prone areas, benefits were derived mostly from the lower risk of damage predominantly to \nagricultural  crops.  However,  their  potential  for  growth  given  adequate  protection  was  fully \nrecognized. In areas with good potential for economic growth__such as Harbin City, which will be \nprotected by the Qunli dike__benefits were derived from enhanced industrial and agricultural \ngrowth made possible by investment in the core subproject.  \n \n106.  The costs of subprojects include the costs of land acquired, resettlement, survey and \ndesigns,  construction,  construction  supervision,  environment  mitigation  measures,  and \nsubproject management. The costs of land acquisition and temporary construction sites are \nbased  on  the  local  compensation  standards.  For  example,  the  cost  for  the  Qunli  dike  is \nestimated at about Y14.7 million for 114 ha and 60 households to be resettled permanently, and \nY556,000  for  the  269  ha  of  grassland  required  as  borrow  areas.  Compensation  costs  for \nstructures dismantled as part of resettlement activities were based on their reconstruction costs.  \n \n107.  The estimated EIRRs for the core subprojects are 13.4 for Du\u2019erbenxin dike, 26.7 for \nQunli dike, and 13.6 percent for Xianghai reservoir. The wide range between the Du\u2019erbenxin \ndike and Qunli dike subprojects reflects the diversity of benefits that should be anticipated from \ninvesting in flood protection in rural areas compared with investment in the urban fringe of a \nlarge city. The EIRR for the Xianghai reservoir subproject reflects the gains to wildlife protection, \nwhich will result in increased tourism activity in the subproject area; increased water storage, \nwhich will result in reduced risk and increased reed production in the wetlands; increased \nfisheries in the reservoir; and increased agricultural production downstream of the wetlands. \nSimilar EIRRs are expected for the other candidate subprojects in the Project. The estimates \nare robust, given the relatively limited scope of benefits quantified in the economic evaluation. \nThe benefit estimates excluded the avoidance of injuries, hospitalization, and loss of lives; \nmobilization of flood-fighting crews; and large-scale emergency evacuation that occur during \nmajor floods. The economic evaluation excluded potential loss, such as loss due to disruption of \ncommunication  and  transportation  to  areas  adjacent  to  flood-prone  zones;  and  loss  of \nhousehold assets, livestock, and farm machinery.  \n \nB.  Social Dimensions \n \n108.  As  demonstrated  by  the  1998  flood,  inundation  created  widespread  hardship  for \nfloodplain residents regardless of their income status; however, the poor were hurt the most. \nAside from direct tangible financial losses, the direct effects of floods include death, injuries, \nhealth hazards, community displacement, loss of property and productive assets, and general \ndisruption to education, livelihood, and social life. Relocation of flood victims to congested \nevacuation camps creates fertile conditions for disease and social tension, while the need to \nreconstruct houses and buildings puts additional burdens on local communities. Women, who \nform a substantial percentage of the labor force, are particularly burdened by flooding as some \nof the activities they carry out, such as fetching drinking water, fuel, and food; taking care of \nchildren and elders; and feeding livestock become extremely difficult during heavy flooding. \nFlood-affected families contribute labor to relief and emergency works and participate in the \ncleanup and recovery efforts after floodwaters have receded. Finally, flooding causes subtler yet \nlonger term losses to farm communities as waterlogging greatly reduces the productivity of \nagricultural land. Recent floods have threatened main urban areas. A major flood in a large city \nremains a possibility, with the existing flood protection infrastructure.  \n                                                 \n49\n The design institutes for Jilin Province, Heilongjiang Province, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. ", "  31\nC.  Impact on Poverty \n \n109.  The extent of poverty in the Songhua River basin (para. 14), as well as the income \neffects of the 1998 floods (paras. 17-18) have been noted.50 About 10.2 million people, or 16 \npercent of the population, live in 30 poverty counties in the project area. About 70 percent of the \npopulation of these poverty counties live in rural areas and the average per capita income is \nY1,700__22 percent less than the average in the project area.  \n \n110.  Two  core  subproject  areas__Du\u2019erbenxin  in  Zalaite  Banner, Inner  Mongolia,51 and \nXianghai in Tongyu County, Jilin__are located in poor rural areas. The third, Qunli, is located in \nDaoli District, Heilongjiang, in the vicinity of Harbin City, a less-poor urban area. Average per \ncapita net annual incomes for Zalaite Banner and Tongyu County are about Y1,200 and Y1,040, \nrespectively.52 Average annual incomes in the three villages comprising the Qunli subproject \narea  are  substantially  higher  at  Y4,196,  reflecting  the  urban  nature  of  this  area.  Poverty \nincidence in the rural subproject areas is about 80 percent for Du\u2019erbenxin and 75 percent for \nXianghai, but only about 17 percent in the urban area of Qunli.53 Rural poverty is caused by \nlocation, limited resource base and land quality, lack of skills and income-earning opportunities \nfrom nonagriculture livelihoods, and poor health status of adults; and is positively correlated with \nthe occurrence of ethnic minorities. In addition to high poverty, the two rural subproject areas \nhave  a  significant  ethnic  minority  population:  34  percent  in  Xianghai  and  58  percent  in \nDu\u2019erbenxin. Both are minority townships (Appendix 12). \n \n111.  The Project will support the poverty reduction trends over the decades in the project \nareas that were abruptly reversed by the effects of the 1998 floods. The Project will provide \napproximately 5.3 million person-days of manual employment, generating employment for about \n45,000 unskilled laborers over the next four years. About 1.1 million person-days required at the \nthree core subproject sites will mean 20-150 days of employment for each of 8,600 unskilled \nlaborers. Based on the estimated poverty incidence at the subproject sites and with priority \ngiven to the poor, about half of the employment estimated to be worth about Y460 million in \nwages will be directed to poor households. Jobs for maintaining the new and rehabilitated \ninfrastructure, the cost of which is estimated at 1 percent of the construction cost or about Y8 \nmillion per year, are likely to provide about 10,000 person-days employment per year. Incomes \nearned from construction work will give households the opportunity to build savings and reduce \nthe risk of falling back into poverty. The three core subprojects were analyzed to assess the \ndistribution  of  benefits  to  project  stakeholders:  the  households,  industry,  and  the  public \nsector/economy. The extent to which the Project directly benefits the poor was also determined. \nThe poverty impact ratios are 0.80 for the Du\u2019erbenxin dike, 0.18 for the Qunli dike, and 0.94 for \nthe Xianghai reservoir (Appendix 12). \n \nD.  Risks \n \n112.  The project design takes into account potential technical and economic risks. The main \nrisks__which  could  result  in  implementation  delays  and  cost  overruns__are  associated  with \nabnormal rainfall and unexpected floods. They can be compounded by the long winter season \nand could adversely affect the construction of dikes and river training works during project \n                                                 \n50\n In 1999 prices, based on data from SWRC. 1999. Study on Sustainable Development for Songliao Region. \n51\n The Du\u2019erbenxin subproject will also benefit part of Longjiang county in Heilongjiang.  \n52\n Per capita incomes in the subproject area villages in Zalaite Banner are generally lower, about Y800. \n53\n TA 3377 PRC: Urban Poverty Study (for $410,000, approved on 27 December 1999) has computed urban poverty \nlines for Project areas as follows: Inner Mongolia (Y1,824), Heilongjiang (1,878), and Jilin (Y1,831). ", "  32\nimplementation.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  the  design  includes  measures  to  facilitate  rapid \nimplementation  and  avoids  construction  during  the  rainy  season.  Advance  action  for \nprocurement and consultant recruitment, and retroactive financing are expected to substantially \nshorten the time before construction starts. Adequate amounts of the loan proceeds will be \nmade  available  on  time  through  imprest  accounts.  The  provision  of  project  management \nconsultants will also expedite subproject selection and preparation of IEE/EIA and RPs. These \nmeasures should mitigate the risk of delayed implementation. \n \n113.  Other risks outlined in Appendix 1 are the need for a high level of commitment to the \nriver basin approach to flood management, acceptance by the provinces and autonomous \nregion of zoning regulations, and additional cost recovery measures. Ongoing policy dialogue \nduring  implementation,  the  impact  of  the  planned  study  tours  and  training,  and  increased \nawareness generally in the PRC of the need for a holistic approach are anticipated to overcome \nthe risks. Local cost financing from ADB has been introduced in remote and poor rural locations \nto mitigate the risk of shortages of counterpart funds. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES  \n \n114.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has agreed to the following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n1.  Policy-Related \n \n(i)  To strengthen coordinated river basin management as mandated by MWR in (a) \nSome Suggestions on Improvement of Flood Construction of the Nen River and \nSonghua River in the Short Term and (b) Directive on Suggestions for the Reform \nof River Basin Commissions, and to help avoid losses similar to those from the \n1998 floods, the Government will ensure that the Songhua River flood control \nheadquarter (SFCH) (established in SWRC) arranges workshops at least three \ntimes during implementation: in the first year, immediately before the midterm \nreview, and in the final year of implementation. \n \n(ii)  Within  one  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  SWRC  and  the  EAs  will  prepare  and \ncommence implementing a timebound action plan acceptable to ADB to carry out \nan  integrated  system  of  flood  management,  including  to  strengthen \nintergovernmental coordination and cooperation on structural and nonstructural \nmeasures for flood protection and management. Such action plan will, among other \nthings,  assign  responsibility  for  areas  of  overlapping  or  conflicting  jurisdiction, \nidentify  any  impediments  to  coordination  between  SWRC  and  the  local \ngovernments (e.g., with respect to the exchange of hydrological and rainfall data), \nand propose measures to alleviate these impediments. \n \n(iii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  SWRC  develops  and  implements  good \ngovernance  principles  with  respect  to  flood  management  policy  planning  and \nimplementation, including representation for the EAs on SWRC in connection with \nsuch  planning  and  day-to-day  implementation;  updating  the  river  basin  flood \nmanagement  plan  every  five  years;  public  participation  in  the  planning  and \nimplementation  decision-making  process;  and  developing  public  awareness \nprograms. \n \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that lessons learned in flood management__including \npolicy,  institutional,  and  operational  innovations  under  the  Project  and  other ", "  33\nprojects such as ADB\u2019s Yellow River Flood Management Sector Project and its \nassociated TA__are taken into account during project implementation and in the \nGovernment\u2019s reform of river basin management and river basin commissions. \n \n(v)  MWR  will  ensure  flood-related  data  and  data  from  state  hydrological  stations \ncollected under their jurisdiction are made fully available to the public and other \npotential users. Data to be used for the benefit of the people will be freely shared \nunder the Project. \n \n(vi)  The Government will encourage all ministries and institutions active in the water \nsector other than MWR to follow the initiative of MWR to make all hydrological data \nand information collected under their jurisdiction fully available to the public and \nother potential users. Data to be used for the benefit of the people, which is clearly \nthe case for flood management, will be freely shared under the Project. \n \n(vii)  Following  the  enactment  by  the  Government  of  the  revised  Water  Law,  the \nprovinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin, and the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia, \nwill issue amended or new provincial/regional regulations, so that such regulations \nare in accordance with the revised Water Law, e.g., with respect to (a) water \nallocation, rights, and permits; (b) water resource management systems and the \nroles of SWRC and the provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin, and the Autonomous \nRegion of Inner Mongolia; (c) efficiency of use and conservation of water; and (d) \nwater  quality  control  for  surface  and  groundwater  and  standards  for  pollution. \nFollowing the enactment by the Government of the revised Water Pollution Law, \nthe  provinces  of  Heilongjiang  and  Jilin,  and  the  Autonomous  Region  of  Inner \nMongolia, will issue amended or new provincial/regional regulations, so that such \nregulations are in accordance with the revised Water Pollution Law. \n \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that the provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin and the \nAutonomous  Region  of  Inner  Mongolia  develop  and  improve  mechanisms  to \nimprove cost recovery and raise O&M funds through means including the charging \nof fees and the allocation of budgetary resources. The Autonomous Region of \nInner Mongolia will issue instructions to establish the Flood Control Infrastructure \nFund, and establish and provide financing for this Fund. \n \n2.  Implementation-Related  \n \n(i)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  subproject  selection  criteria  and \nimplementation  procedures  agreed  upon  with  ADB  are  followed,  including  (a) \npreparation and approval by SEPA and ADB of the IEEs/EIAs, and implementation \nof the environmental mitigation measures set forth in such IEEs/EIAs (including the \nenvironmental  management  plans,  all  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  PRC \nenvironmental laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines; and (b) if \nrequired for a subproject, preparation and implementation of an RP acceptable to \nADB in accordance with the relevant PRC laws and regulations and ADB's policy \non involuntary resettlement (including the resettlement PFPG). \n \n(ii)  The Project Executing Agencies will each establish a PME system acceptable to \nADB  and  their  PMOs.

Structural flood control measures will enable the Songhua River to convey floods up to \nthe relevant national design standards and will ensure that a flood equivalent to that of 1998 \ncould be conveyed through the river system with minimum damage. Flood control works will \ninclude (i) strengthening the existing flood embankments; (ii) constructing new flood control \nembankments; (iii) adopting measures to increase the safety of flood control embankments \n(such as improved slope protection, seepage control measures, and foundation improvements); \nand (iv) providing flow control structures and associated works to increase the flood storage \ncapacity  of  flood  detention  basins  such  as  that  at  Xianghai  reservoir,  which  supports  an \nimportant wetland conservation reserve. Such measures will be implemented adjacent to major \nurban areas, including the cities of Harbin, Changchun, Jilin, and Ulanhot; at important rural \nsites; and in key areas containing major strategic assets such as the Daqing oil fields, China\u2019s \nlargest oil-producing area. \n \n2.  Three core subprojects to be undertaken will reflect the variety of the problems, location, \nscale of works, accessibility, and urgency. They are as follows. \n \nA.  Qunli Embankment \n \n3.  The Qunli embankment is at the new development zone in the western part of Harbin, \nthe largest city along the Songhua River and capital of Heilongjiang Province. Many floods have \nbeen recorded in Harbin during the historical period of flood records, the most recent one being \nin 1998. The flood risk in Harbin and its surroundings has increased gradually over the past 10-\n20 years mainly due to a substantial increase of fixed assets, and also to serious floods with \napparent higher frequency and magnitude. The Project aims at a comprehensive plan for an \nincreased flood protection standard, for both city and suburbs. The core subproject aims at \nupgrading and constructing dikes for town protection and expansion. The Qunli area, being \nabout 24 square kilometers (km2), and at present comprising several small villages with a \npopulation of about 5,400 and a protection standard of 20 years, will become the site for the \nplanned growth of the city with public facilities, transport and other infrastructure, commercial \narea, services, schools, and residential area. The population will reach approximately 365,500 \nand the flood protection standard has to be raised to 50 years. The work involves upgrading an \nexisting embankment, constructing a new embankment and several temporary access roads, \nand excavating construction material. The subproject aims to (i) reinforce about 3.3 km of \nexisting embankment; (ii) construct 10.2 km of new embankment and 840 m of riverbank \nprotection; (iv) plant a 30-meter-wide protection forest belt along the embankment works; and \n(iv) establish 10.75 km of slope protection, as well as upgrade outlet structures. \n \nB.  Xianghai Reservoir \n \n4.  Xianghai reservoir is located near Xianghai town, Baicheng Administration Area, in \nTongyu county in the west of Jilin Province, near the provincial border with the Autonomous \nRegion of Inner Mongolia. The reservoir was constructed in 1971-1973 and consists of two parts \nwith a total design surface area of 71 km2 and a volume of 228 million cubic meters (m3). The \nmain  water  sources  of  the  reservoir  are  the  Longhuatu  diversion  of  the  Taoer  River  and \nHuolin/Ermutai River. Construction of the reservoir served two objectives: flood control, and \nwater supply for the Xianghai National Nature Reserve Area, a grade A nature reserve of \ninternational significance. The reservoir increases the wetland storage capacity to supplement \nwater for downstream reservoirs, and protects the wetland area and habitat of national rare \nwildlife and plants. The reservoir has several safety issues that need to be addressed: low ", "  45  Appendix 4, page 2 \nconstruction and maintenance standards that lead to severe leakage problems. As a result, the \npresent surface area is only 48 km2. The major issues are as follows. \n \n(i)  The original design crest elevation is insufficient to reach the original design value \n(surface area and volume), upstream protection slopes of both main dam (480 m) \nand auxiliary embankments (6.4 km) are heavily damaged. \n(ii)  Three water discharge sluices are seriously damaged. \n(iii)  Seepage causes severe water losses. \n(iv)  The elevation of several banks is insufficient, and a new auxiliary embankment is \nneeded. \n(v)  Communication problems due to lack of access bridges between the two lakes \nhamper reservoir operation. \n(vi)  Flood control telecommunication facilities are old and inefficient. \n \n5.  The project aims to increase and restore the original crest elevation of the main dam \nand  auxiliary  embankments,  reconstruct  and  reinforce  slope  protection,  control  seepage, \nreconstruct three sluicing structures, construct two access bridges, and install flood control \ntelecommunication facilities. \n \nC.  Du\u2019erbenxin Embankment \n \n6.  Du\u2019erbenxin is a township in the Northeast Zalaite Banner of Xing\u2019an League of the \nAutonomous Region of Inner Mongolia. It is on an alluvial plain at the confluence of the Chao\u2019er \nand Yalu rivers with the Nen River. Du\u2019erbenxin plain is surrounded by water on three sides and \nthe plain declines gradually from northwest to southeast. The highest point is Manghai Mountain \nin the south of Du\u2019erbenxin at 153.6 meters above sea level. The Du\u2019erbenxin embankment is \n29.9 km long along the Nen River\u2019s main stream, at the confluence of the Chao\u2019er and Yalu \nrivers.  Flood disasters have not only caused substantial property losses but also produced \nsevere social impacts on an important minority group. The backwater effect from Nen River and \nthe resulting long duration of stagnant water conditions on Du\u2019erbenxin plain cause large crop \nlosses. The present dikes were constructed by the local people with a flood protection standard \nof 10 years, but now suffer from seepage and leakage problems, as well as damage to the \nembankment slopes. The subproject will protect residents and farmlands on the two banks \nthrough these three main components include. \n \n(i)  Foundations will be upgraded and embankments will be raised and widened up to \na higher flood standard, i.e., the frequency of flooding will decrease from once \nevery 20 years to once every 35 years, and seepage will be controlled. \n(ii)  Two  utility  crossings  and  two  outlet  structures  will  be  constructed;  one  outlet \nstructure will be rehabilitated.  \n(iii)  All  sections  will  be  provided  with  slope  protection  and  seepage  control  to \nguarantee their safety and stabilization. \n ", "  46  Appendix 5, page 1 \nCOST ESTIMATES \n \n1.  Introduction \n \n1.  The total project cost is estimated at Y2,958 million ($357.7 million), of which Y1,109 \nmillion ($134 million) is the foreign exchange cost. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will \nfinance $150 million of the project cost, comprising the total foreign exchange cost and $16 \nmillion equivalent of the local currency cost, or 41.9 percent of the project cost. The ADB \nfinancing will cover interest during construction (IDC), commitment charges, and front-end fee. \nThe total project cost, excluding IDC and commitment and front-end fees, is estimated at \nY2,838 million ($343.2 million). The ADB loan will support partial local cost financing of the civil \nworks of selected subprojects in poverty areas (Table A5.1) and the incremental operating costs \nfor central project coordination office (CPCO) operations. The cost estimates exclude routine \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs of the provincial/regional project management offices \n(PMOs) and infrastructure built under the Project. Table A5.2 gives a breakdown of the total \nproject cost by project component and Table A5.3 gives a breakdown by sources of financing.  \n \n2.  Parameters and General Assumptions \n \n2.  The project costs estimates were based on cost and price data as of December 2001 \nand used these general parameters: \n \n(i)  The  exchange  rate  for  base  cost  calculation  is  Y8.27  per  $  for  the  project \nimplementation period of five years. \n(ii)  Domestic  inflation  rates  were  assumed  to  be  2.0  percent  for  2002  and  3.0 \npercent thereafter. The foreign exchange costs were inflated at the rate of 2.4 \npercent per annum. \n(iii)  Physical contingencies for all types of expenditure are 5 percent for the flood \nmanagement  component  and  8  percent  for  the  flood  control  and  project \nmanagement components.  \n(iv)  IDC was estimated on a biannual (6 months) basis, using an interest rate of 5.6 \npercent per annum, the rate applicable to the 5-year swap LIBOR rate for US \ndollars. The loan outstanding includes loan funds disbursed, cumulative interest, \nfront-end fees, and commitment fees. \n(v)  Commitment charges are 0.75 percent of the shortfalls in disbursement from the \ndisbursement thresholds indicated in the Loan Agreement. The thresholds are 15 \npercent of the total loan amount for the first year of project implementation, and \n45, 85, and 100 percent for the second, third, and fourth years, respectively. \n(vi)  The front-end fee equivalent to 1 percent of the total loan amount (i.e., $1.5 \nmillion) is charged after loan signing. The amount and its interest charges are \ncapitalized  into  the  total  loan  amount  for  the  duration  of  the  project \nimplementation period. \n(vii)  Project costs include duties and taxes applicable to the items required under the \nProject. \n \n3.  The following are the estimated foreign exchange contents and tax rates applicable to \nthe different types of expenditure:  \n \n(i)  Forty-three percent of the cost of civil works was considered as indirect foreign \ncost. Civil works were subject to a value-added tax of 17 percent, or 14 percent \nof gross contract costs. ", "  47  Appendix 5, page 2 \n(ii)  One hundred percent of the costs of equipment (including earthmovers, dump \ntrucks), materials (e.g., software and data), vehicles, and international consulting \nservices were considered as foreign costs. ADB financing excludes taxes, duties, \nand related local costs (domestic shipping costs and brokerage fees). A value-\nadded tax of 17 percent was applied to the net prices of equipment, material, and \nvehicles.  Further,  a  100  percent  import  duty  was  incorporated  in  the  cost \nestimates of vehicles. \n(iii)  The total expenses for international study tours and training were considered \nforeign exchange costs.  \n(iv)  Thirty-five percent of the cost of general monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and \nenvironmental/resettlement  monitoring  of  subprojects  was  counted  as  foreign \ncost. Twenty percent of domestic training expenses was also considered foreign \nexchange to account for the use of imported training materials and short-term \nengagement of foreign resource persons. Tax on domestic training activities was \nestimated at 17 percent of net costs.  \n(v)  Land acquisition and compensation, surveys and detailed designs, construction \nsupervision, domestic consultants, and project administration/PMO operations do \nnot have any foreign exchange cost. Therefore, they are not to be financed under \nthe  ADB  loan.  No  tax  will  be  levied  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \ncompensation. \n \n4.  The following are the local cost financing percentages applicable to the different types of \nexpenditures: \n \n(i)  34.5 percent of the local currency cost (43 percent of total cost), excluding taxes \nand duties, of civil works for selected poverty subprojects (Table A5.1); and \n(ii)  incremental  operating  costs  (excluding  taxes  and  duties)  for  the  PCO  on  a \ndeclining basis (100 percent in the first year, and 75, 50, and 25 percent in the \nsecond to fourth years). \n \n5.  ADB  will  wholly  or  partly  finance  the  costs  of  civil  works,  vehicles,  equipment, \ninternational  consulting  services,  domestic  and  international  training,  environment  and \nresettlement monitoring, and project M&E.

Background \n \n1.  In accordance with the involuntary resettlement policy of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB),1 the handling of resettlement and land acquisition for sector loans such as the proposed \nProject requires the preparation of (i) a resettlement policy framework and procedural guidelines \n(RPFPG)  applicable  to  all  subprojects,  and  (ii)  a  specific  resettlement  plan  (RP)  for  each \nsubproject. The preparation of RPFPG and at least one RP for each core subproject is a \ncondition for project appraisal. Additional RPs with detailed design and acceptable to ADB will \nbe  prepared  as  a  condition  for  approval  of  ADB  financing  for  the  other  subprojects.  The \nSongliao Water Resources Commission (SWRC), in consultation with the relevant provincial \nmanagement  offices  (PMOs),  has  prepared  the  RPFPG  and  the  RP  for  the  Qunli  dike \nsubproject (a core subproject involving substantial resettlement and land acquisition).2 This work \nis complemented by an initial social assessment (ISA) providing preliminary impacts data for the \nother core and noncore subprojects. This Appendix summarizes the RPFPG and the RP for the \nQunli dike subproject, and reviews the impact data available for the other subprojects. The RP \nfor Qunli dike subproject is given in Supplementary Appendix A and the RPFPG for the Project \nis given in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nB.  Resettlement Policy Framework and Procedural Guidelines \n \n1.  Policy Framework \n \n2.  The  RPFPG  reflects  both  Chinese  legal  requirements  and  ADB\u2019s  policy.  The  main \nprinciples  follow:  (i)  minimizing  negative  impacts  as  much  as  possible;  (ii)  carrying  out \nresettlement and compensation so as to improve or at least restore the preproject income and \nliving  standards  of  affected  persons  (APs);  (iii)  fully  informing  and  consulting  the  APs  on \ncompensation  options  and  resettlement  planning;  (iv)  providing  asset  compensation  at \nreplacement rates; and (v) compensating in full for lost assets, replacement dwellings and \nresettlement allowances prior to ground leveling and demolition. ADB approval of a subproject \ninvolving resettlement will be subject to ADB's approval of the subproject RP. \n \n3.  The RPFPG stipulates eligibility and entitlements for land, houses, income losses, and \nrehabilitation subsidies in accordance with the 1998 Land Administration Law, Municipal Urban \nDemolition Regulations, and ADB\u2019s policy. As Chinese laws and regulations allow for various \nalternatives in compensation eligibility, methodology, and rates, each subproject RP will give \nspecific provisions within the allowable options and ranges based on the land productivity \nfeatures of each subproject site and intensive consultation with local communities. The general \noptions and compensation ranges are described below. \n \n(i)  Permanent land losses will be replaced through land reallocation within village domains \nand through the payment of (a) a land compensation fee, and (b) a resettlement subsidy. \nLand compensation will range between 6 and 10 times of the average annual output value \n(AAOV) and the resettlement subsidy will range between 4 and 6 times the AAOV. These \nfunds may be wholly paid to the affected villages, which will reinvest them for productive \n                                                 \n1 Asian Development Bank. 1998.

Manila. \n2 A resettlement plan has also been completed for Du\u2019erbenxin dike, a core subproject. \n   ", "  53  Appendix 7, page 2 \nimprovements benefiting the affected communities; in special situations they may be given \nto the APs or shared by the village and the APs. In the latter case, villages will receive the \nland compensation and the APs the resettlement subsidy. If farmland reallocation lowers \nthe minimum village per capita land ratio beyond the allowable ratio, sufficient APs will be \nreclassified and provided with jobs. \n \n(ii)  Temporary land losses will be paid for in cash to the APs at the rate of 2 times the \nAAOV. \n \n(iii)  Residential land will be compensated either through \"land for land\" arrangements in \nvillage  domains  or,  in  the  case  of  subprojects  in  urban  areas,    by  adding  to  the \ncompensation for houses and buildings the substitution value of the residential land lost. \n \n(iv)  House/buildings losses will be paid to the APs in cash at replacement cost free of \ndemolition expenses and salvaged materials. In case residential land is provided through \n\"land  for  land\"  arrangements,  the  APs  will  rebuild  the  houses.  If  residential  land  is \ncompensated in cash, the APs will use the compensation to purchase apartments. \n \n(v)  Crops losses will be paid to the APs in cash at the rate of a single AAOV. \n \n(vi)  Various relocation subsidies covering transport, work losses, transfer costs, medical \nexpenses, temporary housing, and a resettlement bonus will be paid to the APs. \n \n(vii)  Business  losses  allowance  based  on  tax  declarations  will  be  paid  to  each  AP  so \naffected for each month of interruption of business activities. \n \n  2.  Resettlement Procedural Guidelines \n \n4.  The RPFPG establishes the following procedures for the preparation of subproject RPs: \n(i) after subproject identification and completion of preliminary design, the relevant PMO carries \nout an ISA to determine preliminary impact data and to identify the socioeconomic features of \nthe  APs;  (ii)  if  through  this  process  subproject  impacts  are  identified  as  \u201csignificant,\u201d3  the \nprovincial/regional PMO will prepare a full RP; (iii) if impacts are less than \u201csignificant,\u201d the  \nPMO will prepare a short RP.4 \n \n  3.  Institutional Responsibilities \n \n5.  Because this is a sector loan project, the Ministry of Water Resources through SWRC \nhas overall coordination responsibility for the three provincial/regional PMOs and the proposed \nstructural subprojects. In turn, each PMO has full responsibility for coordinating the subproject \noffices with respect to project planning, implementation, and financing. Subproject offices will be \ntasked with preparing and implementing specific RPs and will share responsibilities with cities, \ntownships,  counties,  and  local  land  management  and  resettlement  offices  for  resettlement \nactivities such as asset valuation; consultation; delivery of entitlements; and issuance of land \nacquisition,  demolition,  and  building  permits.  Field  tasks  such  as  paying  compensation, \nselecting replacement land, and providing livelihood support will rest with township and village \nofficers. \n                                                 \n3 Significant impacts are defined as follows: (i) 200 or more APs, (ii) 100 or more APs belonging to national \nminorities or vulnerable groups. \n4 For full and short RP formats, see ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. \n   ", "  54  Appendix 7, page 3 \n \n  4.  Disclosure and Public Consultation  \n \n6.  RP preparation will entail intense public consultation carried out through questionnaires \nand community meetings involving implementing agencies, local governments, and APs. An \ninformation booklet summarizing RPFPG provisions will be sent to all APs while the RPFPG and \nthe RP in the Chinese language will be available in each village. The same documents in \nEnglish will be available at ADB Headquarters and the Resident Mission. \n \n  5.  Grievance Procedures \n \n7.  Complaints and grievance procedures will be established in the RPs. Grievances will be \nlodged  first  with  the  village  committee.  If  no  settlement  is  reached  within  two  weeks,  the \ncomplainant will have one month to raise the case with the county land administration bureau or \nbuilding demolition office. If the case is still unresolved within two weeks, it can be sent to the \nsubproject office. Final appeal will be made in the civil courts under Chinese law. \n \n  6.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n8.  As required by ADB, both internal and external monitoring of RP implementation will be \ncarried out. The PMOs will establish in collaboration with SWRC a monthly reporting system \ninvolving resettlement staff at township and county levels. External monitoring will be assigned \nto an independent monitoring agency (IMA). The PMOs will report to ADB on land acquisition \nand resettlement in the quarterly progress reports. External monitoring reports will be submitted \nto ADB twice a year. \n \n  7.  Finances \n \n9.  Each RP will establish the unit compensation rates for the items negatively affected by \nthe subproject and will give a detailed assessment of the cost of the resettlement and land \nacquisition programs. These will include asset compensation inclusive of land compensation, \nresettlement subsidies, and house/improvements replacement; income restoration assistance; \nrelocation allowances; management costs; monitoring and evaluation; taxes; and contingency. \nCost estimates will be adjusted annually based on the inflation rate of the preceding year. \n \nC.  Resettlement Plan for Qunli Dike Subproject \n \n  1.  Background and Impact Assessment \n \n10.  Three core subprojects, one for each province, were selected: Qunli dike in Harbin City, \nHeilongjiang  Province;  Du'erbenxin  rural  flood  control  embankment,  Inner  Mongolia;  and \nXianghai reservoir rehabilitation, Jilin Province. Of these, the Du'erbenxin rural flood control \nembankment requires a short RP, which has been completed. The Qunli dike requires a full RP. \nThe  full  Qunli  dike  RP  was  prepared  as  model  for  the  other  subprojects  (Supplementary \nAppendix A) and is summarized in the following paragraphs. \n \n11.  The Qunli dike subproject entails the construction of 10.3 km and the rehabilitation of 3.3 \nkm of dikes on the south bank of the Songhua River in Daoli District, Harbin City. In accordance \nwith Chinese laws and regulations and the RPFPG, a full RP was prepared based on advanced \npreliminary design, a socioeconomic survey, a household-to-household impacts inventory, and \nintensive AP consultation. As a condition for contract awards, when detailed design is available, \na detailed measurement survey will be carried out and, if necessary, impacts assessment and \n   ", "  55  Appendix 7, page 4 \nresettlement costs will be updated. \n \n12.  The  subproject  will  acquire  118.7  hectares  (ha)  of  which  73.83  ha  are  farmland. \nTemporary land impacts will affect 339 ha. Buildings losses amount to 52,831square meters \n(m2) of houses and 2,674 m2 of structures belonging to five public enterprises. The subproject \nwill also remove 34,762 m2 of greenhouses, 87 trees, 23 380kV and 35 220kV electricity poles, \nand 35 tombs. Overall, the APs are 893: 450 persons (159 households) will be affected by \nhouse relocation; 288 persons (181 laborers), by permanent land acquisition; 145 persons (93 \nlaborers), by temporary land occupation; and 10 persons, by enterprise relocation. \n \n  2.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n13.  The  RP  reflects  the  policy  principles  established  by  the  RPFPG  and  fixes  specific \neligibility  provisions,  entitlements,  and  compensation  mode  and  rates  for  the  subproject. \nPermanent land losses will be offset through land reallocation within village domains, while land \ncompensation and resettlement subsidies in cash will be paid respectively to villages and APs \nor public enterprises. Villages will use these funds for productive improvements benefiting the \naffected communities. The land compensation rate is 6 times the AAOV, while the rate for \nresettlement  subsidies  is  4  times  the  AAOV.  Temporary  land  losses  will  be  compensated \ndirectly to the APs at a rate equal to a single AAOV. Premises land of farm deposits and barns \nwill  be  compensated  in  terms  of  \"land  for  land\"  arrangements  in  village  estates.  House, \ngreenhouse, and improvements losses will be compensated in cash at replacement cost__not \nincluding demolition expenses and salvaged materials__to their owners, whether APs or public \nenterprises. Crops losses will be compensated to the AP in cash at the rate of 2 times the \nAAOV. Finally, APs and public enterprises will receive various allowances to cover transport \n(Y600),  income  loss  (Y300),  damages  (Y150),  medical  fees  (Y20),  and  relocation  bonus \n(Y3,000). Enterprise allowances will cover transport (Y20,000) and wage losses (Y10,000). \n \n  3.  Rehabilitation and Income Restoration \n \n14.  Because land redistribution will cause minimal per capita reduction of village farmland \n(5.2 percent), the reinvestment of land compensation funds in productive improvements such as \nthe expansion of greenhouses in dryland plots will be sufficient to maintain the living standards \nof villagers. Moreover, the decision to pay resettlement subsidies directly to the APs will almost \ncertainly lead to improvement of these villagers\u2019 livelihood.  \n \n15.  All relocatees have chosen to receive both house and residential compensation in cash, \ninstead of house compensation plus replacement plots. With compounded house/residential \nland compensation set at Y1,200-1,100/m2 for legal brick/concrete and brick/wood houses, \nrespectively, and at Y300-200/m2 for nonregistered attachments, the relocatees will be able to \npurchase new apartments in nearby areas. As current apartment prices range from Y900 to \nY1,700/m2 compensation rates allow for the purchase of apartments larger than the average in \nthe project areas and of much better quality than the demolished houses. The viability of farms \nhas  been  maintained  by  providing  compensation  for  farm  deposits  and  barns  in  cash  at \nreplacement cost for buildings, and \"land for land\" arrangements for land premises.  \n \n16.  Affected vulnerable households with per capita income below $1/day equivalent, headed \nby widows or divorced women, or composed of elderly APs, will receive special livelihood \nrestoration. Those losing houses will be assisted in purchasing or constructing replacement \nhousing, and will receive welfare provisions during and after implementation of the resettlement \nprograms. Census data show no vulnerable households among the APs. \n   ", "  56  Appendix 7, page 5 \n \n  4.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n17.  The subproject PMO will be responsible for RP implementation under the supervision of \nthe EA and the office of the Harbin City vice-mayor. Within the PMO, a resettlement unit will be \nresponsible for resettlement planning, implementation, and timely delivery of entitlements. City \nand district land administration bureaus, urban demolition offices, and township and village \ngovernments will play important roles in implementing various tasks on the ground. \n \n5.  Public Consultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n \n18.  RP  preparation  and  compensation  methodology  and  rates  setting  were  based  on \nintensive consultation carried out through surveys and community meetings involving PMO, \nvillage officials, and APs. During RP implementation further consultation will be carried out to \ndefine the details of day-to-day resettlement activities.  \n \n19.  An information booklet summarizing the RP will be sent to all APs. The RP in Chinese \nwill be made available to the public at the ADB Resident Mission and PMO/affected villages \noffices. The RP in English will be available at ADB's Resident Mission and headquarters.  \n \n20.  In grievance cases, APs will submit a verbal or written complaint first to the village or \ntownship resettlement office. If the grievance is not settled within two weeks, it may be elevated, \nwithin one month, to the district resettlement office. If the case is still unresolved within two \nweeks, it can be raised with the subproject PMO. Final appeal will be made in the civil courts. \n \n  6.  Monitoring and Reporting \n \n21.  The PMO will monitor RP implementation monthly. The IMA will carry out external \nmonitoring every six months. The PMO will report quarterly to ADB on the progress of land \nacquisition, resettlement, and compensation/rehabilitation tasks, while IMA reports will be sent \nto ADB every six months. The IMA will evaluate the performance of the rehabilitation program at \nthe end of the resettlement program and a year after. \n \n7.  Finances  \n \n22.  RP costs amount to Y83.1 million, including Y18.4 million for permanent or temporary \nland  impacts,  Y48.1  million  for  house  compensation,  and  Y16.8  million  for  other  costs, \nmanagement, monitoring/evaluation, and related activities. The full resettlement cost will be \nincluded in the total subproject cost. The EA will ensure timely and adequate funding for \nresettlement implementation and will provide budgets as necessary to meet any shortfall.  \n \nD.  Other Core and Noncore Subprojects \n \n23.  The RPs for the other subprojects so far identified are in various preparation stages with \nsome, like that for the Changchun City embankment being at a very advanced stage. All \nremaining subprojects have been surveyed and ISAs estimating negative impacts have been \nprepared. Noncore rural subprojects will involve minimal resettlement or land acquisition, and \nseveral may require only a short RP. Urban subprojects will involve substantial resettlement and \nland  acquisition  and  will  require  the  preparation  of  full  RPs.

The Project will establish the capacity to manage floods in the Songhua River basin and \nupgrade the existing integrated flood protection system, which (i) shields cities, major assets, and \nindustries, and (ii) supports the sustained livelihoods of about 62 million people living in the \nfloodplain areas. Each subproject to be implemented as part of the Project will contribute to \noverall flood control in the Songhua River basin as well as provide protection to locally inundated \nareas. Major economic assets to be protected include the cities of Harbin, Changchun, Jilin, and \nQiqihar, and the oil field in Daqin. With improved protection, these assets will play an important \nrole in the future development of the project area and in the reduction of poverty. However, since \nthe overall benefits to the entire floodplain area from improved management and protection \ncannot be allocated between different subprojects, they have been excluded from the current \nanalysis. The benefits included in each analysis in this appendix were limited to direct and \nquantifiable benefits from local flood protection and, in the case of the core reservoir subproject, \ndirect benefits from flood protection and incremental economic activities attributable to improved \nreservoir storage. \n \n2.  Economic costs and benefits were assessed to evaluate the economic returns on the \ninvestments made in the three core subprojects. The three are typical of the 26 subprojects \nincluded in the Project. The analysis was conducted for an asset life span of 40 years, including \nthe construction period, which is conservative for the types of structures built. The costs and \nbenefits were expressed in constant 2001 prices, and valued using the domestic price numeraire \nmethod. Financial costs of traded goods, net of all taxes and duties, were adjusted to their \nrespective economic values using a shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) of 1.07.1 The shadow \nwage rate for unskilled labor was estimated at 0.9 of the prevailing wage rate. All other local \ncurrency  costs  were  assumed  to  equal  their  economic  costs  after  taxes  and  duties  were \ndeducted. Financial benefits for the dike subprojects were estimated on the basis of annualization \nof the reduction of expected flood damage, in particular with respect to damage to public and \nprivate infrastructure (including housing), reduced losses of industrial output and reduced losses \nof agricultural production. For the Xianghai reservoir core subproject, the financial benefits from \nreduced flood damage represent about 60 percent of the overall benefits, the remainder being \nderived  from  improvements  to  the  wetlands,  increased  production  from  the  reservoir,  and \nincreased agricultural production downstream. \n \n3.  The economic costs and benefits of the capacity-building activities for the Songliao Water \nResources Commission (SWRC) and the provincial/regional project management offices (PMOs) \nwere not analyzed since the economic value of institutional strengthening cannot be reliably \nestimated. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis \n \n4.  Since the local authorities, who own the structures,2 do not generate revenue from their \nflood protection services and do not operate them as financially independent entities, the financial \ninternal rates of return of the subproject investments are not a relevant indicator of subproject \nsustainability and were therefore not calculated. However, financial costs and benefits provided \nthe basis for the subsequent estimation of economic costs and benefits. Financial evaluation \n                                                           \n1\n  SERF is the inverse of the standard conversion factor (SCF), which is 0.93 based on recent project economic \nanalysis for Loan 1835-PRC: Yellow River Flood Management (Sector) Project, for $150 million, approved on 28 \nAugust 2001, a project in the same sector. \n2 The flood control structures to be constructed/rehabilitated under the Project are owned by counties and cities. ", "  66  Appendix 11, page 2 \nfocused on the capacity of the authorities to raise sufficient revenue to sustain operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the facilities and the need for insurance to compensate for losses due to \nfloods (paras. 18-19). \n \nC.  Economic Costs \n \n5.  The subproject costs (i) include the costs of land acquired, voluntary and involuntary \nresettlement, surveys and design, construction, construction supervision, environment mitigation \nmeasures, and subproject management; but (ii) exclude all costs incurred to date for constructing \nand rehabilitating flood control dikes and reservoirs. The costs of land acquisition for dikes and \ntemporary construction sites as well as for resettlement were based on local compensation \nstandards. The costs of buildings to be dismantled due to subproject construction were based on \ntheir replacement or reconstruction costs. These costs are set out in the resettlement plans for \nthe Qunli dike and Du\u2019erbenxin dike subprojects and are estimated as Y83.0 million and Y4.7 \nmillion, respectively. For Xianghai reservoir, no resettlement is required, but Y133,000 has been \nallocated for recovery and regreening of the construction site, and compensation for water losses \nand erosion. \n \nD.  Economic Benefits \n \n6.  Economic benefits for the three core subprojects were based on flood damage avoidance \ndue to the subproject investments. Potential damage included losses in fixed assets (crops, \nagriculture land, homes, public infrastructure, and industrial equipment and facilities); temporary \ndisruptions of agricultural and industrial production; costs of emergency evacuation; repair of \nflood control structures; and stunted investment and economic growth due to the prevailing flood \nrisk. Only direct and quantifiable benefits attributable to flood protection in the subproject area \nwere included in estimating benefits. Thus, neither the broader downstream benefits of flood \nprotection due to retention of floodwaters in rehabilitated reservoirs nor the downstream costs \ndue to marginal increases in the risk of downstream flooding following dike strengthening were \nincluded.3 For Qunli dike, where no information was available on either the costs or benefits of \npotential  residential  and  industrial  developments  in  the  area,  benefits  were  limited  to  those \ndirectly related to the existing assets and the expected economic growth resulting from improved \nprotection of the area.  \n \n7.  At Qunli dike, no account was taken of either the likely increase in value of the protected \nland due to the planned development of the area as a residential, commercial, and service suburb \nof Harbin City, or the increased economic benefits resulting from investments in residential and \ncommercial assets following improved flood protection. Harbin Development Office has indicated \nthat the value of unimproved land is expected to increase from Y170/square meter (m2) currently \nto  Y550/m2  at  dike  completion.  Although  the  new  development  may  be  more  valuable,  its \nvulnerability to flood damage__and hence the benefits of the dike__depends on the planning and \ndesign of development, information that is currently unavailable.  Given that the land will be \ndeveloped for commercial and residential use, a complete economic analysis of the dike would, \nfor example, compare the cost of the dike to the cost of alternative measures of managing the \nflood risk. The analysis presented here provides the best available estimate of the net benefits \ndue to the dike. \n                                                           \n3  Rehabilitation of the Xianghai reservoir will allow storage of a greater volume of water in the reservoir during flood \nevents, which will result in a marginal reduction in flooding over the entire floodplain. For Qunli dike core subproject, \nwhere 24.3 square kilometers (km2) of land will be protected from floods with a return period of up to 1-in-50 years, \nthe proposed dike will result in a marginal increase in the risk of floods downstream of Harbin City. However, in the \nabsence of the mathematical model that will be developed under the Project, it is not possible to quantify these \nmarginal impacts. ", "  67  Appendix 11, page 3 \n8.  Financial valuation of damages was based on the values of crop and industrial outputs, \npublic  infrastructure,  and  industrial  assets  as  recorded  in  the  official  county,  township,  and \nsubdistrict statistics.4 For inundated areas, a conservative estimate assumed that a one-season \ncrop was lost, which__because of the predominant types of crops grown__is equivalent to 50 \npercent  of  annual  crops  in  Qunli  and  100  percent  in  Du\u2019erbenxin.  Potential  losses  of  farm \nimplements and household items were not calculated due to lack of data. Likewise, the costs of \nnecessary cleanup and silt removal from urban areas and agricultural lands after the floods were \nnot included. Financial values were converted to economic values using conversion factors for \nthe civil works, materials, equipment, and labor shares of each type of damage.5 The design \ninstitutes and the PMOs provided subjective estimates of inundation data and asset loss rates. \nThese were combined with the data on current economic activity in the protected area to estimate \ntotal  economic  losses  for  varying  levels  of  flood  severity  in  the  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios. Average annual damages were then computed by estimating the area under the \ndamage-frequency curve (flood frequency plotted against associated damages). Table A11.1 \npresents the total economic losses and annualized damages for the with- and without-project \nscenarios  for  the  three  core  subprojects,  as  well  as  the  incremental  annualized  damage \navoidance estimated at Y57.4 million for Qunli dike, Y5.5 million for Xianghai reservoir, and Y5.0 \nmillion for Du\u2019erbenxin dike. \n \nTable A11.1: Estimated Annual Economic Benefits Due to Core Subprojects \n  Damages    Annualized Damage   \nFlood  (Y '000)  (Y '000)  Annualized Incremental \nFrequency  Without  With    Without  With  Damage Avoided \n(%)  Project  Project  Project  Project  (Y \u2018000) \nQunli Dike Core Subproject \n10.00  229,242  0    22,924  0  22,924 \n5.00  530,494  0    22,594  0  22,594 \n2.00  869,862  0    11,878  0  11,878 \n      Total        57,396    57,396 \n \nXianghai Reservoir Core Subproject \n2.00  156,912  0    3,138  0  3,138 \n0.10  377,122  0    2,312  0  2,312 \n      Total        5,450    5,450 \n \nDu\u2019erbenxin Dike Core Subproject \n10.00  39,821  0    3,982  0  3,982 \n5.00  47,691  0    590  0  590 \n2.86  58,757  0    435  0  435 \n      Total        5,007    5,007 \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n9.  The importance of Xianghai reservoir goes beyond flood protection: it also provides water \nto  the  Xianghai  National  Nature  Reserve,  an  internationally  important  wetland  and  wildlife \nreserve. The increased and more assured supply of water from the rehabilitated reservoir will \nreduce the frequency of drought in the area and improve the environment for wildlife. The \nsummary  initial  environmental  examination  gives  a  description  of  the  wildlife  species  and \n                                                           \n4  Official county, township, and subdistrict statistics provide the most comprehensive and reliable estimate of the \nfinancial values of assets and outputs. Due to the relatively small area benefiting from each subproject, statistics \nwere collected from the provincial/regional project management office concerned. \n5  Property values, as reflected in the available county/city statistics, are considered to reasonably reflect their \neconomic value, after conversion, since they comprise reasonably rational investments by individuals in either \nresidential or industrial infrastructure. Distortions caused by expectations of insurance payouts are not relevant to the \nproject area since no formal insurance market exists and insurance-like payouts by Government are on a largely ad \nhoc basis, which is unlikely to bias the investment decision. Moreover, in the Du\u2019erbenxin dike subproject area, the \nhigh incidence of poverty is reflected in the low valuation of housing. ", "  68  Appendix 11, page 4 \nbiodiversity  in  the  area  served  by  Xianghai  reservoir:  over  300  kinds  of  vertebrate  wildlife, \nincluding 286 kinds of birds, of which 17 belong to nationally and globally protected birds.6 While \nno attempt was made to quantify the direct environmental benefits, those derived from increased \nreed  production  in  the  nature  reserve  and  increased  tourism  were  quantified  and  included. \nAdditional  benefits  arising  from  increased  fisheries  in  the  reservoir  and  increased  water \navailability to supplement two downstream reservoirs (Xinglong and Shengli) used for irrigated \nagriculture were also identified and quantified. \n \n10.  Other financial benefits of rehabilitating the reservoir were estimated based on information \nprovided by Jilin PMO. Within the wetlands, reeds are grown on about 15,000 ha (227,000 mu) or \n14.4 percent of the 105,000 ha total area of the reserve, and current annual production is \nestimated at about 20,000 tons (t).7 The reported gross value is Y184/t, of which net value \nrepresents about 65 percent. Improved reliability of the water supply will increase the output of \nreeds and reduce production variability within the existing area. Average yield is expected to \nincrease by about 100 percent over a five-year development period, which is not expected to \nhave an adverse impact on price. Incremental annual production was estimated at Y3.6 million. \n \n11.  The number of tourists visiting the Xianghai Reserve had increased from about 25,000 in \n1996 to about 44,000 in 2001, with foreign tourists accounting for about 5 percent of the total. \nAverage expenditure was estimated at about Y200/person.8 This estimate included tourists from \nJilin Province and represented less than 1 percent of tourists visiting the province. Local tourism \nin  both  Jilin  Province  and  Xianghai  Reserve  is  expected  to  continue  to  expand  as  China \ndevelops. But without the subproject, the capacity of the Xianghai wetlands to cater to increased \ntourism demand will remain limited due to frequent droughts. Thus it was assumed that without \nthe Project, the number of tourists would continue to increase at the historical rate up to a \nmaximum of 80,000/year by the year 2016 and would then remain constant. With the Project, the \nincrease was assumed to continue at the historic rate up to a maximum of 100,000/year by the \nyear 2023. Per capita expenditure was assumed to remain constant at Y200/person both with and \nwithout the Project. The incremental annual value of tourism is estimated at Y4.0 million by full \nproject development. \n \n12.  The increased capacity of the rehabilitated reservoir for water storage is expected to result \nin benefits to both the fish catch and irrigated agriculture. Annual fish catch is expected to \nincrease from 250 t to 400 t over a six-year period, while the value of the fish is expected to \nremain constant at about Y10/kilogram (kg). Based on an estimated fish net value of 55 percent \nof its gross value,9 incremental production is estimated at Y0.8 million. Irrigation benefits are \nestimated based on a potential incremental area of 2,670 ha (40,000 mu) irrigated from the two \ndownstream reservoirs in a good year, and an average annual area of about 50 percent of \npotential. Currently 2,330 ha (35,000 mu) of the land is planted to maize, which has a yield of 6 \nt/ha and a financial price of Y0.92/kg, and the remainder is unused. Rice is expected to similarly \nyield 6.0 t/ha with a financial price of Y1.28/kg. Full adoption of the cropping pattern is expected \nto take five years following completion of rehabilitation. The incremental financial benefits of rice \nproduction were estimated at Y1.4 million by full development. \n \n                                                           \n6  Summary Initial Environmental Examination. Songhua River Flood Management Sector Project, circulated to the \nBoard on 17 August 2001. \n7  RAMSAR Information Sheet, 1997. \n8  Comprising about Y20 for return travel to the nature reserve, Y135 for overnight accommodation, Y25 for a visit to \nthe environmental display and related costs, and Y20 for a tour of the nature reserve. \n9 Within the Xianghai reservoir, fish production is a low-input activity with the major cost being for harvesting of the \nfish. ", "  69  Appendix 11, page 5 \n13.  Based on ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, reeds, which are used \nfor specialized paper making, and tourism, which comprises predominantly local tourists, were \nassumed to be nontraded goods for which the appropriate economic conversion factor using the \ndomestic price level numeraire is 1.0. Hence the economic values for these outputs were the \nsame as their financial values. For rice and maize, which are internationally traded, economic \nprices were estimated on the basis of border prices adjusted for processing, transportation, and \ndistribution. Since the People\u2019s Republic of China only periodically imports and exports, average \nparity prices__Y1.19/kg for rice and Y0.90 for maize__are considered to be most appropriate for \nthe analysis. With-Project economic benefits are thus estimated at Y32.9 million, compared with \nY24.6 million with no Project, giving an incremental annual value of almost Y8.3 million (Table \nA11.2). \n \nTable A11.2: Xianghai Reservoir: Estimated Annual Economic Value of Other Benefits \n  Without Project  With Project  Incremental \nBenefit  (Y\u2019000)  (Y\u2019000)  (Y\u2019000) \nReed Production  2,392  4,784  2,392 \nTourism  16,000  20,000  4,000 \nFisheries  1,375  2,200  825 \nIrrigated Agriculture  4,784  5,881  1,097 \n  Total  24,551  32,865  8,314 \n \n14.  With the Project, economic growth associated with improved flood protection, and hence \nannualized damage avoidance, was assumed to increase at 2-3 percent per annum for the Qunli \ndike and Xianghai reservoir subprojects where significant development has already occurred, and \n3-5 percent for the Du\u2019erbenxin dike subproject, which is currently at a low level of development \nand has considerable investment and economic growth potential.  \n \nE.  Economic Rates of Return \n \n15.  The economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were estimated as 26.7 for Qunli dike, 13.6 \nfor Xianghai reservoir, and 13.4 percent for Du\u2019erbenxin dike. The wide range between the \nDu\u2019erbenxin dike and Qunli dike subprojects reflects the diversity of benefits from investing in \nflood protection in a completely rural area and in one located on the urban fringe of a large city. \nThe estimated EIRR for the Xianghai reservoir subproject reflects the benefits of flood protection \nas  well  as  the  gains  to  wildlife  protection  that  result  from  increased  tourism  activity  in  the \nsubproject area, and the benefits from increased water storage, which will reduce risk and \nincrease production. Similar EIRRs are expected for the other subprojects to be included in the \nProject. These estimates are robust, given the relatively limited scope of benefits accounted for in \nthe economic evaluation. The EIRRs provide conservative estimates of the economic value of the \nProject, given that the benefits excluded avoidance of substantial social and longer-term costs \nthat  are  not  easily  quantified,  including  avoidance  of  injuries,  hospitalization,  loss  of  lives, \nmobilization of flood-fighting crews, and large-scale emergency evacuation that will occur during \nmajor floods. The economic evaluation also excluded losses due to disruption of communication, \ntransportation, education, and family life as well as loss of household assets, livestock, and farm \nmachinery. \n \nF.  Sensitivity Analysis \n \n16.  Sensitivity tests were conducted on the EIRRs for each core subproject (Table A11.3). \nThe  Du\u2019erbenxin  dike  subproject  is  the  most  sensitive  to  both  cost  increases  and  benefit \ndecreases. The switching values indicate that the subproject would become nonviable with either \na  13.6  percent  cost  increase  or  a  12.0  percent  benefit  decrease.  The  Xianghai  reservoir ", "  70  Appendix 11, page 6 \nsubproject is marginally less sensitive. Qunli dike is the least sensitive, requiring a 133 percent \ncost  increase  or  a  57  percent  benefit  decrease  to  become  nonviable.  The  subprojects  are \nsimilarly sensitive to a one-year delay in the realization of benefits. \n \nTable 11.3: Sensitivity Analysis of Core Subprojects \nSubproject/Sensitivity Test  ENPV  EIRR  SI  SV \n(Y\u2019000)  (%)  (%) \nQunli Dike  287,673  26.7     \n  10% cost increase  266,076  24.4  0.8  133.2 \n  10% benefit decrease  237,309  24.2  1.8  57.1 \n  10% cost increase + 10% benefit decrease  215,712  22.2 \n  1-year lag in benefits  232,448  22.2 \nXianghai Reservoir  9,073  13.6     \n  10% cost increase  2,396  12.4  7.4  13.6 \n  10% benefit decrease  1,488  12.3  8.4  12.0 \n  10% cost increase + 10% benefit decrease  (5,189)  11.1 \n  1-year lag in benefits  747  12.1 \nDu\u2019erbenxin Dike  5,492  13.4     \n  10% cost increase  912  12.2  8.3  12.0 \n  10% benefit decrease  362  12.1  9.3  10.1 \n  10% cost increase + 10% benefit decrease  (4,218)  11.0 \n  1-year lag in benefits  (176)  12.0 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; ENPV = economic net present benefit; SI = sensitivity index; \nSV = switching value. \n \nG.  Operation and Maintenance Requirements \n \n17.  Funds are collected and allocated at the provincial/regional level for construction and \nmaintenance of flood control infrastructure through the Water Resources Construction Fund and \nthe Construction Fund for Flood Control Infrastructure. Similar funds have been established in \nHarbin City (Heilongjiang) and Tongyu County (Jilin), where annual fund collection amounts to \nabout Y18.7 million and Y0.3 million. These are currently used to finance construction but will be \nreallocated to maintenance on completion of the structures. \n \n18.  O&M of the dikes, reservoirs, and related infrastructure in the newly constructed and \nrehabilitated subprojects will be the responsibility of the relevant county or city. Annual O&M \ncosts are estimated at about 3.5 percent of construction costs, including in-kind community \ncontributions. O&M costs of infrastructure rehabilitated under the Project are expected to be lower \nthan the current O&M cost of these structures, at least in the medium term. Nonetheless, the \nimplementing agencies do not foresee a significant reduction in O&M commitment after the \nProject. \n \n19.  The flood insurance market remains undeveloped and, even with progress following \nentry into the World Trade Organization, most households, particularly the poor, will continue \nto rely in the foreseeable future on ad hoc payments from national and local governments to \ncompensate for flood losses. The level of compensation varies between provinces and regions \nand  even  between  towns  and  counties  within  provinces.  Compensation  for  Du\u2019erbenxin \ntownship  following  the  1998  flood  amounted  to  about  Y1.55  million  from  the  central \nGovernment  for  house  construction,  Y0.3  million  from  the  national  Agricultural  Land \nDevelopment Fund for farmland, and Y0.1 million from the township for roads. The extent of \ncompensation was equivalent to about Y5,000 per household for the loss of a house.10 No \ninformation is available for Heilongjiang or Jilin provinces. \n                                                           \n10 A study currently in progress is expected to provide further substantial information on the extent of compensation. ", "  71  Appendix 12, page 1 \nSOCIAL AND POVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT \n \nA.  Government Policies on Poverty Reduction \n \n1.  Since  1994,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has  been  implementing  a  poverty \nreduction program in counties officially classified as poor by national or provincial standards in \nremote mountains, desert and loess plateau regions, reservoir catchments, areas with endemic \nlocal disasters and former revolutionary bases.1 Poor transport, environmental degradation, slow \neconomic  growth,  lack  of  drinking  water,  and  extremely  harsh  conditions  for  production  and \nlivelihood characterize those locations. For the northeastern provinces (including the flood-prone \narea to benefit from the Project), poverty reduction efforts involve (i) identifying locally appropriate \nmechanisms to address the remaining clusters of poverty, (ii) mobilizing national support and \nhuman and financial resources in the relatively well-off areas to assist poverty reduction efforts, \nand (iii) strengthening water management infrastructure along the lower reaches of the major rivers \nto prevent severe floods and major relapses into poverty.  \n \nB.  Socioeconomic Characteristics of the Songhua River Basin \n \n2.  The  Project  will  finance  a  range  of  flood  management  and  control  subprojects  in  the \nSonghua River basin (population 62.4 million people). Of the total 130 counties or cities in the \nbasin, 72 are in Heilongjiang Province, 38 in Jilin Province, and 18 in Inner Mongolia. Only two \ncounties belong to Liaoning Province. The total gross domestic product (GDP) for the basin in 2000 \nwas Y485.4 billion, averaging Y7,778 per person (Table A12.1). \n \n3.  The area is relatively urbanized, with 43.3 percent of the population living in cities or towns, \nand 35.4 million people in rural areas. About 17.4 million hectares (ha) or 31 percent of the area is \nfarmland. On average, each rural person has about 0.5 ha (7.4 mu) of farmland, ranging from 4.8 \nmu per person in Jilin, to 11.6 mu per person in Inner Mongolia, which is much higher than the \nnational average. A study by the Songliao Water Resources Commission (SWRC) found that 66 \ncounties with a population of 32.7 million (52.5 percent) are at high risk of drought and flooding. In \nthose counties, about 70 percent of the people live in rural areas. Average per capita rural income \nis about Y2,000, about 8 percent lower than the river basin average; and rural per capita GDP is \nY5,086, about one third less than the river basin average. The livelihoods and crops of rural people \nare vulnerable to natural disasters such as floods. \n \nTable A12.1: Features of the Disaster-Prone Areas \n  Prone to Natural  Percent of the  Poverty  Percent of the  Total River \nItem  Disasters   River Basin  Counties  River Basin  Basin \nNo. of counties  66  50.8  30  23.1  130 \nTotal population (million)  32.7  52.5  10.2  16.3  62.4 \nAgricultural population (million)  22.8  64.5  7.0  19.8  35.4 \nPercent of agric. population  69.6    69.1    56.7 \nTotal land area (1,000 km2 )  __    __    556.8 \nFarmland (1,000 km2)  104.4  60.1  36.2  20.8  173.7 \nPer capita farmland (ha)  0.4  93.9  0.5  106.1  0.5 \nPer capita income (Y/year)  2,001  92.0  1,700  78.2   2,175 \nPer capita GDP (Y)  5,085.5  65.4  3,371.2  43.3  7,778.0 \n \n__ = not available, GDP = gross domestic product, ha = hectare, km2 = square kilometers. \nSource: 2000 Provincial Statistical Yearbooks. \n \n4.  Compared with the provinces in the impoverished western region of the PRC, much of the \nbasin is relatively well-off. However, there are very large areas of income poverty in the rural areas, \n                                                 \n1\n  Since loan appraisal, the Government has redesignated the 562 national poverty counties.

The poor and near poor (incomes below Y1,500/year) \ntogether  form  32  percent  of  the  population.

About 16 percent of the total population, or 10.2 million people, live in these counties. \nAmong them, close to 70 percent of the people are in rural areas with per capita farmland of 0.52 \nha. Average rural per capita income was Y1,700 in 1999, 21.8 percent less than the basin average, \nPer capita GDP was only Y3,371, 56.7 percent less than the basin average. In the national poverty \ncounties, the rural per capita income and per capita GDP were even lower, about Y1,590, and \nY3,190 respectively. Poverty counties typically cluster along the banks of the Nen River and its \ntributaries, including Yule, Tao\u2019er, and Second Songhua rivers. Poverty is concentrated close to the \nrivers, indicating a link between poverty and flooding; i.e., higher risk.  \n \nTable A12.3: Poverty and Non-Poverty Counties in the Project Area (million persons) \n  Project Area  National Poverty County  Provincial Poverty County \nProvince  County  Population  County  Population  County  Population \nHeilongjiang  72  35.3  9  2.9  4  1.5 \nInner Mongolia  18  4.9  2  1.5  6  1.5 \nJilin  38  21.8  5  0.6  4  2.1 \nTotal  128  62.4  16  5.0  14  5.1 \n    Source:  Provincial statistical yearbooks.  \n \n6.  Substantial progress has been achieved in reducing poverty in the project provinces. In \n1994, Heilongjiang had 2.3 million people below the government\u2019s poverty line (total population \n37 million).4 By 1998, only 460,000 were classified as poor, but due to the 1998 flood the number \nof poor people rose to 1.2 million. In Jilin over a 20-year period to 1998, poverty was reduced from \n30 percent to only 5.5 percent. After 1998, the number of poor increased by 19 percent. In Inner \nMongolia where half of all counties are national or provincial poverty counties, the poor numbered \n1.1 million after the 1998 flood. \n \n                                                 \n2\n Although the official state poverty line was set at Y635 per capita income in 1998, the recent practice by the State \nStatistics Bureau is to use Y856 per capita income to determine rural poverty in China. Current ADB practice is to use \na per capita income of Y1,300 in rural areas and Y3,300 in urban areas.    \n3\n In 1999 prices, based on data from SWRC. 1999.

The 1998 flood affected 88 counties or cities and 17.3 million people, accounting for 67.7 \npercent of total counties and 27.8 percent of the population in the basin. Damaged and destroyed \nhouses totaled 1.4 million. Agricultural losses in the basin were estimated at about Y2.3 billion and \ndirect economic losses were over Y4.8 billion, averaging Y770 per person for the whole basin. The \n1998 floods pulled down hundreds of thousands of people below the poverty line, wiping out \nachievements of over many years (Table A12.4). In Tangyuan County (Heilongjiang), the number \nof poor people increased 700 percent above the preflood 1998 situation. Keyoushang County in \nInner Mongolia experienced a 100 percent rise in the number of people under the official poverty \nline.  \n \nTable A12.4: Impacts of the 1998 Flood on Poverty in Selected Counties \n  Poverty Level  % Increase of poverty  \nCounty/City  1994  1998 (prior to the flood)  1999  (1998-1999) \nHuanan  90,000  57,000  70,000  23 \nTangyuan  63,000  3,000  24,000  700 \nTuquan  90,000  33,000  59,600  81 \nKeyoushang  72,000  32,000  64,000  100 \nJiamusi  150,000  80,000  130,000  63 \n \nSource: Field visits, May-June 2000. \n \n8.  Two of the three core subproject areas__Du\u2019erbenxin in Zalaite Banner, Inner Mongolia \nAutonomous Region, and Xianghai in Tongyu County, Jilin Province__are in poor rural areas. Both \nare in national-level poverty counties, with 37 percent poverty in Zalaite Banner and 32 percent \npoverty in Tongyu County based on the official poverty line. Since average per capita net annual \nincomes for Zalaite Banner and Tongyu County are about Y1,200 and Y1,040, respectively, use of \na  higher  poverty  line  as  adopted  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  increases  poverty \nincidence to about 75 percent. Incomes in the subproject area villages are generally lower than the \ncounty average. Xianghai township, where the Xianghai reservoir is located, has four villages. All \nfour are county-designated poverty villages; per capita income for the township was only Y680 in \n2000. For Du\u2019erbenxin, the protected area includes four villages in Nuwenmuren township, with \nover 50 percent of the total population under the official poverty line. Average per capita income \nwas Y944 for the area, with Y700-Y800 per person in the three poverty villages; using ADB\u2019s \npoverty line increases poverty incidence to about 80 percent. In contrast, average annual incomes \nin the three villages comprising the Qunli subproject area are substantially higher at Y4,196, \nreflecting its more urban location. About 17 percent of the population of Qunli is income poor5 \n(Table 12.5). \n \nTable A12.5: Basic Characteristics of Core Subprojects \n    Percent of  Farmland Per  Poverty  Per Capita \nCore Subproject  Population  Minority  Capita (mu)  Percent a  Income \nPeople  (Y) \nXianghai  8,795  34.1  11.1  75  680 \nDu\u2019erbenxin  4,250  57.6  11.1  80  944 \nQunli b  4,606    0.0   2.2    17  4,196 \nTotal  17,651  30.9   8.8  32.6  - \n \na  Mission estimates based on ADB poverty lines of Y1,300 for rural areas and Y3,300 for urban areas. \nb  For Qunli, the selected three villages are affected by the project, not the total protected area as at Du\u2019erbenxin. \nSource:  Field visits, September 2001. \n                                                 \n5\n ADB\u2019s poverty line is estimated as equivalent to an annual per capita income of Y1,300 for rural areas, and Y3,300 for \nurban areas. ", "  74  Appendix 12, page 4 \n9.  In addition to high poverty incidence, the two rural core subproject areas have a significant \nethnic minority population: 34 percent in Xianghai and 58 percent in Du\u2019erbenxin.6 Both Xianghai \nand Nuwenmuren are minority townships with the majority comprising Mongols, an important \nminority group. In general, the minority groups often live in remote hilly areas and derive their \nincomes largely from rain-fed terrace cultivation, combined with herding. There is also a strong link \nbetween  poverty  and  minority  status.  For  example,  in  Xianghai  and  Du\u2019erbenxin,  all  minority \nvillages are also poverty villages, with per capita incomes lower than the township average. Among \nthe four villages in Du\u2019erbenxin, three villages are minority villages with average per capita income \nof Y800, while the remaining Han village has an average per capita income of Y1,400. Lack of \nskills and capital to improve irrigation conditions are cited as reasons for higher poverty in the \nminority areas. \n \n10.  In the two rural subproject areas, although per capita farmland area was high (about 10 mu \nor 0.7 ha), most of the area is low quality dryland with low yield. For irrigated land, average annual \nyield could reach 400 kg per mu. For dry land, under good weather, the average annual yield could \nreach 150 kg per mu, or Y150 per mu, with net income being only Y50 per mu. In bad years with \nflooding or drought, little output is expected. In fact, both Xianghai and Du\u2019erbenxin project areas \nhave suffered serious droughts in the past three years, following the 1998 flood. In 2000, many \nvillagers  in  Du\u2019erbenxin  relied  on  the  Government  for  food  supply.  Interviews  with  village \nindividuals indicated that loss caused by the 1998 flood, lack of capital, and lack of knowledge had \nprevented them from improving irrigation conditions and investing in other non-planting activities. \nFor example, to dig a deep well that could irrigate up to 5-6 ha of farmland requires an investment \nof approximately Y2,800. The 1998 flood__which destroyed two villages and inundated all farmland \nin the area__and continuous droughts since did not give these poor farmers a chance to recover, or \ninvest to improve farming conditions. Women, who form a significant percentage of the rural labor \nforce, are typically burdened during such difficult events by the need to obtain drinking water, fuel, \nand food to help maintain the health of family members and household livestock, and to protect \nhousehold properties. Children are affected by such serious poverty, since some households could \nnot afford to send their children to school. Unlike households in the Qunli-affected area that derive \nonly 25 percent of income from agriculture (56 percent of their incomes from nonfarm employment), \nthose from the two rural subproject areas derive over 80 percent of their income from farming, \nparticularly cultivation of grain, which is vulnerable to floods. The proposed embankment and \nreservoir rehabilitation projects will not only provide flood protection and improve irrigation to these \npoor farmers, but also offer an opportunity to build savings for other income-generating activities. \n \nC.  Overview of Social Benefits  \n \n11.  The  Project  will  yield  social  benefits  for  all  residents  of  the  flood-prone  area  through \nreduced risks to personal safety, livelihood, and assets. Flood warning and escape facilities and \nprocedures will be improved in ways that create greater community involvement. This is important \nfor  agricultural  producers  who  rely  heavily  on  grain  grown  for  home  consumption,  livestock \nfattening, and for income. Funds previously devoted to insurance or replacement of assets will \nbecome available for alternative productive and consumptive uses. Those most likely to benefit are \nriverside residents (typically poorer households) whose flood-related losses have eroded resource \nreserves and restricted investment. These residents total roughly 15.4 million in Heilongjiang, 15.0 \nmillion in Jilin, and 2.3 million in Inner Mongolia. Village interviews strongly suggested that poorer \nhouseholds forgo investment in higher income enterprises such as livestock production for fear that \nanimals will be lost to floods. Moreover, frequent house reconstruction drains their capacity to \naccumulate financial resources. The poorer residents will benefit from the security provided by the \n                                                 \n6\n For the Qunli subproject, the total protected area (30,000 persons) includes two minority villages with 1,400 persons, \nor 4.7 percent. Most are of Korean nationality with the same income and living standard as in the other villages. ", "  75  Appendix 12, page 5 \nProject in flood mitigation and improved local government financial capacities. Data collected in \nboth Tongyu County and Zalaite Banner indicates low levels of Government investment in local \nsocial services and provision of infrastructure, particularly for drinking water, local clinics, and \nroads. Confidence that public infrastructure investments will be more secure will support more \ninvestment in these locations. For Qunli, the improvement of flood protection will encourage urban \ndevelopment, during which both local communities and urban residents will significantly benefit.  \n \n12.  Although creating the necessary environment for income generation, the Project will not \nfocus assistance to the poor. Flood mitigation requires that control structures be placed in the most \nstrategic locations to minimize inundation rather than in areas with the largest number of the poor. \nFurther, the Project is not intended to support improvement of the income-generation capacities of \nhouseholds or to address the key impediments to poverty reduction in each location. The Project \nwill, however, assist poor residents in the following ways: (i) it will foster community consultation \nand planning in designing subprojects and formulating resettlement plans, which will enhance the \ncommunity\u2019s role in devising appropriate means of income restoration and allocation of funds and \ntechnical assistance; (ii) adequate compensation to be paid to local villages for land acquisition and \nresettlement following the new Land Administration Law will provide these villages an opportunity \nto improve their farming conditions; (iii) priority in employment, particularly in constructing and \nmaintaining the platforms and other related local facilities, will be given to poor households. \n \nD.  Project Employment Impact  \n \n13.  During implementation, the Project will generate incomes for the floodplain communities, \nincluding the poor, from labor-intensive construction of dikes and reservoirs. Preliminary estimates \nindicate that approximately 5.3 million person-days of manual employment will be generated over \nthe next four years, providing employment for about 45,000 unskilled laborers during that period. \nAbout 1.1 million person-days at the three core subproject sites during the next two years will \nprovide 20-150 days of employment for about 8,600 unskilled laborers. Based on the estimated \npoverty incidence at the subproject sites and with priority to the poor in jobs at those sites, about \n50 percent of employment estimated to be worth about Y460 million in wages will be directed to \npoor households. Jobs will also be available for maintenance, the cost of which is estimated at 1 \npercent of the construction cost, or about Y8 million per year. This work is likely to provide about \n10,000 person-days per year. Although project activities are not aimed at income generation, extra \nincomes from construction work will build sav ings to improve farming conditions, finance income-\ngenerating activities, and reduce the risk of falling back into poverty. \n \nE.  Distribution of Project Benefits \n \n14.  The three core subprojects were analyzed to assess the distribution of subproject benefits \nto project stakeholders: households, industry, and the economy. A study also assessed how the \nProject directly benefits the poor. Economic analysis showed benefits to households were derived \nfrom employment opportunities, and direct avoidance of flood damage to crops and houses and \ndisruption in farming activities. Industries will benefit through reduced risk of damage and less \ninterruption in operations, while the public sector will benefit from prevented damage to public \ninfrastructure and savings of flood evacuation costs for the affected population. During construction, \nlaborers  will  accrue  benefits  from  employment  opportunities.  The  public  sector  will  gain  tax \nincomes, but will bear most of the costs of investment. Table A12.6 presents the results of the \ndistribution analyses. The poverty impact ratios are 0.18 for the Qunli subproject, 0.94 for Xianghai, \nand 0.80 for Du\u2019erbenxin. \n \n \n ", "  76  Appendix 12, page 6 \nTable A12.6: Poverty Impact Ratios for Core Subprojects \nA.
