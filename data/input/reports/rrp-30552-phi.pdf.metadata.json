The Project will be\ndriven  by  the  needs  and  demands  of  communities  that  lack  the\ninfrastructure essential for them to realize the productive potential of their\nland.  Proposals  emanating  from  local  government  units  (LGUs)  for\nsubprojects  that  meet  feasibility  criteria  will  be  eligible  for  Project\nfinancing.  Using  fully  decentralized  implementation  arrangements,  the\nProject  will  also  advance  the  decentralization  of  rural  infrastructure\nplanning and management.\n\nCategory B. An initial environmental examination was undertaken and the\nsummary is a supplementary appendix.\n\nMost  of  the  rural  poor  are  engaged  in  subsistence  agriculture  and  are\nconcentrated in the eastern-central and southern Philippines, particularly\nin  the  Bicol  region,  eastern  Visayas,  the  Autonomous  Region  of  Muslim\nMindanao  (ARMM),  and  central  Mindanao.  In  these  areas,  poverty  is\ncaused and sustained by inadequate agricultural and rural development.\nThe  Government\u2019s  Medium  Term  Philippine  Development  Plan  for  1999\nto  2004  and  the  Agriculture  and  Fisheries  Modernization  Act  of  1997\nemphasize \nthe  realization  of\nagricultural  production  potential  and  the  creation  of  viable  employment\nand income opportunities in rural areas, particularly in the southern part\nof  the  country.  Inadequate  rural  infrastructure  stands  out  as  a  principal\ncause of constraints that poor farmers face in becoming more productive\nand profitable. A chief constraint is the difficulty and cost of hauling inputs\nto  farms  and  outputs  to  markets  caused  by  the  lack  of  access\ninfrastructure. The Project aims to remove these constraints.\n\nimportance  of  mechanisms \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nThe  long-term  development  goal  is  to  increase  rural  incomes  with\ndistributional  gains  favoring  the  poor  in  areas  with  high  agricultural\npotential.  The  immediate  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i)  remove  the\nconstraints to the improvement of agricultural productivity caused by the\nlack or inadequacy of rural infrastructure, and (ii) reduce rural poverty by\nincreasing agricultural productivity and profitability. The Project will have\nthree  components:  (i)  improved  rural  infrastructure,  (ii)  capacity  building\nfor  devolved  project  implementation  and  management,  and  (iii)  project\nmanagement and coordination.\n\nObjectives and\nScope\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe  estimated  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  $150.0  million  equivalent,\ncomprising  about  $44.4  million  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $105.6\nmillion in local currency equivalent costs.\n\n\fFinancing Plan\n\niii\n\nSource\n\nAsian Development Bank\n\nGovernment\n\nLocal Government Units\n\nBeneficiaries\n\nInternational Labour Organization\n\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\n\nPercent\n\n44.3\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n30.7\n\n37.2\n\n28.3\n\n8.5\n\n0.9\n\n75.0\n\n37.2\n\n28.3\n\n8.5\n\n1.0\n\n50.0\n\n24.8\n\n18.4\n\n5.6\n\n1.1\n\nTotal\n\n44.4\n\n105.6\n\n150.0\n\n100.0\n\nLoan Amount and\nTerms\n\nAllocation and\nRelending Terms\n\nA  loan  of  $75  million  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans,\nwith a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 7 years, a front-end\nfee of 1 percent of the loan amount, and an annual commitment charge\nof 0.75 percent.\n\nMost of the proceeds of the ADB loan are for financing rural infrastructure\nand will be channeled to LGUs through the Municipal Development Fund\nOffice,  managed  by  the  Department  of  Finance.  For  a  loan  to  an  LGU,\nthe onlending terms will be those prevailing for the fund, which at present\ninclude an amortization period of 15 years, a grace period of 3 years, and\na 14 percent interest rate.\n\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2008\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nDepartment of Agriculture (DA)\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nAs  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project,  DA  will  be  responsible  for\noverall  coordination  and  management  of  the  Project  through  a  project\nmanagement  committee  and  a  project  coordination  unit  in  the  Office  of\nthe Secretary. DA will implement the components for capacity building for\ndevolved  project \nimplementation  and  management,  and  project\nmanagement and coordination. LGUs (municipal, city, and provincial) will\nimplement the improved rural infrastructure component. Day-to-day tasks\nfor  project  management  and  technical  assistance  to  the  participating\nLGUs will be provided by a project office, contracted to the private sector.\n\nProcurement\n\nGoods  and  services  for  the  Project  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Major equipment will be procured by\ninternational  shopping,  and  office  furniture  and  equipment  by  local\ncompetitive bidding. Civil works will be contracted using local competitive\nbidding procedures.\n\nConsulting Services A  total  of  about  243  person-months  of  specialized  services  from  short-\nterm  domestic  consultants  and  about  42  person-years  of  long-term\ndomestic and international consultants are required for the duration of the\nProject.

Beneficiaries  from  rural\nroads  will  experience  savings  in  costs  and  increased  production  that\ntogether  will  increase  average  annual  household  incomes  from  crop\nproduction  by  $94  to  $553.  Annual  incomes  from  crop  production  for\nfarmers with irrigated holdings will be expected to increase by 82 to 215\npercent following investment in irrigation facilities. The analysis of 10 core\nsubprojects  indicates  that  the  Project  will  directly  benefit  some  700,000\npeople  (50  percent  of  which  are  poor)  and  indirectly  benefit  another\n160,000 people (47 percent of which are poor). By project completion, at\nleast 93,000 people should be lifted out of poverty. Approximately 1,000\nperson-years of incremental employment will be generated, 57 percent of\nwhich  will  benefit  the  poor.  However,  only  about  0.4  percent  of  the\npoverty-reduction impact can be attributed to the income generated from\nconstruction  or  maintenance  of  the  infrastructure,  while  the  remaining\n99.6  percent  is  due  to  its  usage.  On  a  subsectoral  basis,  67  percent  of\nthe long-term poverty-reduction impact is due to access infrastructure, 19\npercent  due  to  irrigation,  and  14  percent  due  to  potable  water  supply.\nis  18  percent.\nThe  overall  economic \nNonquantifiable benefits are expected to flow from investments in roads\nand  potable  water  supply.

THE PROPOSAL\n\n II. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2. \nIn  response  to  a  request  from  the  Government,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\nprovided a technical assistance (TA) to the Department of Agriculture (DA) to formulate a project to\naddress the needs of farmers and the rural poor through the provision of rural infrastructure.1 The\nTA  was  approved  by  ADB  in  May  1999  and  was  conducted  from  the  end  of  August  1999  to\nmid-February  2000.  Ten  representative  core  subprojects  in  nine  provinces  were  selected,  and\nstudies were conducted as the basis for preparing a sector loan project. A loan fact-finding mission\nwas conducted from 17 February  to 28 March 2000 and an appraisal mission from 31 July to  25\nAugust  2000.2  During  project \nformulation,  comprehensive  beneficiary  and  stakeholder\nconsultations  took  place.  During  ADB  missions,  consultations  were  undertaken  with  national\ngovernment  agencies  (NGAs),  local  government  units  (LGUs),  potential  beneficiaries,  peoples\u2019\norganizations,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  other  funding  agencies  active  in  the\nrural  sector.  This  report  is  based  on  the  findings  of  these  missions,  the  reports  of  the  TA\nconsultants, and the discussions held with major stakeholders. The project framework is attached\nas Appendix 1.\n\n III. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nPoverty in the Rural Sector\n\n3. \nNearly 20 million people in the rural Philippines are poor. Poverty in the country is primarily\nrural-based and is caused and sustained by weak rural and agricultural development. In 1997, the\nlast  year  for  which  poverty  data  are  available,  44.4  percent  of  all  rural  households  (equivalent  to\n51.2 percent of the rural population) were living below the poverty line, compared to 18.5 percent in\nurban areas and 32.1 percent for the country as a whole.3 The incidence of rural poverty based on\nheadcount data increased between 1994 and 1997, while it fell in the urban areas.4\n\n4. \nMost of the rural poor are engaged in subsistence agriculture. They are concentrated in the\neastern-central and southern Philippines, particularly in the Bicol region, the eastern Visayas, the\nAutonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), and central Mindanao. Given the magnitude of\nrural  poverty,  any  sustainable  growth  strategy  for  the  Philippines  needs  to  emphasize  pro-poor\nmechanisms  for  the  realization  of  agricultural  production  potentials  and  the  creation  of  viable\nemployment  and  income  opportunities  in  rural  areas,  particularly  in  the  southern  part  of  the\ncountry.\n\nRepublic  Act  8425  (RA  8425)  of  1997,  the  Social  Reform  and  Poverty  Alleviation  Act\n5. \nprovides  the  overall  policy  framework  for  the  Government\u2019s  poverty-reduction  strategy.  While  RA\n8425  gives  responsibility  for  policy  oversight  to  the  National  Anti-Poverty  Commission,  all  NGAs,\n\n                                                \n1 TA  3194-PHI: Infrastructure for Rural Productivity Enhancement Sector Project,  for  $800,000,  approved  on  15  May\n\n1999.\n\n2  The  Mission  comprised  S.  Groff,  Mission  Leader-Project  Economist;  N.  Ogawa,  Programs  Officer;  A.  Bauer,\nSocioeconomist  (Poverty  Reduction);  V.  You,  Counsel;  S.  Wendt,  Social  Development  Specialist;  K.  Yamauchi,\nEnvironment Specialist, and L. Adriano, Staff Consultant-Poverty Reduction Specialist.\n\n3  ADB.  2000.  Philippines: Country Assistance Plan, Programs  Department  (East).  It  should  be  noted,  however,  that\nthese  figures  differ  from  international  data  based  on  the  $1  per  day  per  capita  expenditure  on  consumption.  In  its\nPhilippines Poverty Assessment (Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Unit, East Asia and Pacific Region,\nWorld  Bank,  24  May  2000,  Washington  DC.),  the  World  Bank  estimates  that  the  incidence  of  consumption  poverty\nincreased from 24.7 percent in 1997 to 26.3 percent in 1999. This increase was due to the Asian financial crisis and\nthe El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a phenomena.\n\n4  Rural poor families in 1997 accounted for 72.6 percent of the total poor, compared to 66.4 percent in 1994.\n\n\f2\n\nparticularly  those  involved  in  rural  development,  are  tasked  with  implementing  poverty  reduction\nprograms. The National Anti-Poverty Commission has recently released the National Anti-Poverty\nAgenda,  which  states  that  rural  development  and  participatory  governance  are  fundamental  to\npoverty reduction and to the Government\u2019s Medium Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP)\nfor 1999 to 2004, which has a goal of reducing poverty incidence to between 25 and 28 percent by\nthe  year  2004.  For  farmers,  farmworkers,  and  landless  rural  workers,  the  National  Anti-Poverty\nAgenda  states  that  improvements  in  quality  of  life  require  security  of  land  tenure;  ownership  of,\naccess  to,  and  control  of  arable  lands  by  the  tiller;  higher  productivity  and  fair  prices  for  their\nproduce; and sustainability and profitability of agriculture. The project objectives are consistent with\nand support the Government\u2019s objectives and approaches to poverty reduction.\n\n2. \n\nAgriculture\n\nAgriculture  is  the  dominant  sector  in  the  economy  of  the  Philippines.  It  contributes  20\n6. \npercent of gross domestic product and more than 20 percent of total export earnings, and provides\n36 percent of the labor force. About half of the population is rural, two thirds of which depends on\nagriculture for a living, and the majority of the country\u2019s poor live from subsistence agriculture and\nfisheries.  The  sector  has  grown  slowly  and  unsteadily  since  the  early  1980s,  and  at  an  annual\naverage rate of 1.6 percent between 1995 and 1999. Low productivity, partly due to the absence of\nan adequate policy framework and institutional arrangements to resolve the highly distorted price\nincentive system (e.g., food price support and consumer subsidies), continues to beset the sector.5\nThe instability of growth is mainly due to (i) the downward trend in export prices of traditional export\ncrops,  (ii)  continuous  deterioration  of  intersectoral  trade,  (iii)  macroeconomic  constraints,  (iv)  a\nseries of natural calamities, (v) lack of internal markets, and (vi) high transport costs.\n\n7. \nAgriculture's share of public investment averaged less than 13 percent between 1993 and\n1997, compared to 69 percent for large-scale infrastructure. Although the Government's investment\nin agriculture and rural infrastructure began to increase in 1995, primarily to support the adjustment\nmeasures  for  the  country's  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization,  it  continues  to  be\ninadequate. This has restricted the growth of the agriculture sector, compared to the industry and\nservices sectors, and consequently slowed the pace of development in rural areas.\n\n8. \nThe Government intends to develop the agriculture sector to achieve food security and be\ncompetitive  in  the  international  market,  in  anticipation  of  the  full  implementation  by  2004  of  the\nprovisions  of  the  Uruguay  Round  agreements  on  tariffs  and  trade  agreed  with  the  World  Trade\nOrganization. The investments required to finance rural infrastructure and make agriculture globally\ncompetitive  are  beyond  the  Government's  internal  resources.  Under  the  Philippine  Medium  Term\nPublic  Investment  Program  formulated  in  line  with  MTPDP,  the  financial  requirements  for  rural\nroads  and  irrigation,  two  of  the  most  important  investments  to  increase  productivity,  amount  to\n$2.56  billion  or  P115  billion  (para.  26).  Based  on  DA\u2019s  budget  over  the  past  five  years,  the\nGovernment can provide only about 50 percent of this investment. The majority of the balance will\nhave to be funded externally through official development assistance, as there are few incentives\nfor private sector investment in rural infrastructure.\n\n3. \n\nRural Infrastructure\n\n9. \nA  primary  reason  for  the  poor  productivity  (and  low  profitability)  of  agriculture  is  the\ninadequacy of rural infrastructure, particularly rural roads6 and irrigation. The quality and density of\nrural roads make a significant difference in the cost of inputs, the quality and value of outputs, and\nthe provision of social services, as well as being an impediment to private sector investment. About\nhalf  of  the  villages  in  the  country  lack  all-weather  access  to  the  provincial  and  national  road\nnetworks. Moreover, the majority of the existing village roads are in such a poor condition that they\n\n                                                \n5  Loans  1739/1740-PHI:  Grains Sector Development Program,  for  $175  million,  approved  on  24  April  2000,  address\n\nsome of these constraints.\n\n6  In  this  report,  rural  roads  are  defined  as  roads  that  provide  access  between  agricultural  production  areas  and  an\n\nexisting national or provincial road. Most of these are either village or municipal roads.\n\n\f3\n\ncan no longer be maintained without substantial investment in rehabilitation. In a World Bank report\non  rural  poverty,7  it  was  estimated  that  the  provision  of  all-weather  rural  roads  could  reduce  the\ncosts of marketing agriculture products by 15-20 percent.  Productivity is further constrained by the\nfact that only about 43 percent of potentially irrigable land is irrigated and 30 percent of the rural\npopulation lack access to safe drinking water.\n\nThe  inadequacy  of  rural  access  infrastructure,  together  with  low  rates  of  growth  in  the\n10. \nagriculture sector, has limited the growth of profitable farm and nonfarm activities. Consequently,\nopportunities for productive employment in rural areas have not materialized and the incidence of\nrural  poverty  has  increased.  A  1998  survey  on  the  Government\u2019s  safety  net  programs  under  the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade8 indicated that farmers rank rural roads and irrigation as\ntwo of the most important investments required to improve the agriculture sector and reduce rural\npoverty.  In  spite  of  this,  the  Government  and  (since  the  Local  Government  Code  [LGC]  of  1991)\nLGU  investments  in  rural  infrastructure  are  relatively  low.  Historically,  the  largest  share  of\nGovernment investment in rural infrastructure has concentrated in a few provinces in Luzon. The\nProject,  through  decentralized  investment  in  rural  infrastructure  in  the  southern  Philippines,  is\ndesigned to increase agricultural productivity with consequent increases in rural incomes.\n\n4. \n\nLocal Government\n\n11. \nThe LGC introduced major changes in the governance structure of the Philippines, offering\nnew  opportunities  for  more  area-focused  and  integrated  participatory  development.  Under  the\nLGC,  LGUs  are  charged  with  a  series  of  devolved  functions  relevant  to  the  Project,  such  as\n(i) construction and maintenance of municipal roads and bridges, small landing facilities, and fish\nports; (ii) construction of communal irrigation and small water impoundment schemes, intervillage\nirrigation, dikes, and drainage; and (iii) wells and spring development, water supply, and sanitation\nprojects.  The  LGC  also  charges  the  LGU  with  responsibility  for  community-based  infrastructure\nrehabilitation programs and for repair and maintenance of LGU infrastructure facilities.\n\n12. \nIt is widely recognized that decentralization has been a success in the Philippines and has\nprovided the opportunity for making development better, more democratic and participatory, more\nfocused  on  the  needs  of  the  poor,  and  more  sustainable.  As  a  result  of  decentralization,  basic\nservices delivery is becoming more integrated, more focused on local priorities, and more efficient\nand cost effective. LGUs are interested in providing more investment and maintenance support for\nprojects they themselves identify, construct, and own. While devolution moves project identification\nand  implementation  closer  to  beneficiaries,  it  also  introduces  new  challenges,  particularly  with\nregard to LGU commitment and capability. LGUs are, however, in the best position to ensure that\nsubprojects are located and designed most appropriately and involve the beneficiaries themselves\nin the identification, development, and operation of the facilities. Experience has clearly shown that\na centralized national government cannot effectively carry out these functions in rural areas.\n\n13. \nAlthough LGUs have been given many key responsibilities, capital expenditures at this level\nare  low  due  to  a  lack  of  financial  resources.  The  results  of  a  recent  empirical  study  reveal  that\nLGUs, in general, underspent on health, social welfare, and agricultural services relative to levels\nprevailing before devolution.9 Since 1994, spending levels are at par with 1991 levels in real terms\nper capita. Among the economic sectors, agriculture suffered most, with spending lower than 1991\nlevels in both 1993 and 1994. To balance underfinanced LGUs, the Government provides grants to\n\n                                                \n7  World  Bank.  1996.

Under  the  sector  approach  taken  by  the\nProject, individual LGUs will have to satisfy eligibility criteria to be included in the Project.\n\n15. \nThree factors influenced the selection of regions to be included in the Project: (i) agricultural\npotential,  (ii)  historic  inequity  in  the  distribution  of  investment  in  rural  infrastructure,  and\n(iii) socioeconomic development and poverty characteristics.\n\n16.  Mindanao has a comparative advantage in agriculture over most of the rest of the country.\nBecause of its topography and typhoon-free climate, a wide range of annual and perennial crops\ncan  be  cultivated,  including  temperate  vegetables  at  higher  elevations.  Not  only  large-scale\nagricultural  producers,  plantation  owners,  and  international  corporations,  but  also  small-  and\nmedium-scale  producers  and  cooperatives,  have  established  links  with  export  markets  for  farm\nproduce. Region IV\u2019s Occidental Mindoro, Oriental Mindoro, Marinduque, and Romblon provinces\nare noted for their agricultural and fishery potential. With their proximity to Metro Manila, they have\na higher degree of agri-industrialization than the Project\u2019s other regions outside Mindanao. Eastern\nVisayas  ranks  second  (after  Region  IV)  in  the  area  of  available  land  classified  by  the  Bureau  of\nSoils  and  Water  Management  as  in  the  wet  agroclimatic  zone.  In  this  zone,  annual  rainfall  is\ngreater than 2,500 millimeters; hence the zone can readily grow two crops a year. The lower cost\nof  land  and  labor,  compared  with  most  of  Luzon,  constitute  another  agricultural  advantage  in  the\nproject area. Real agricultural wage rates for plantation and nonplantation agriculture in Luzon are\n4.3  percent  and  10.3  percent  higher  respectively  than  in  the  southern  Philippines.  Thus,  the\nopportunities  for  special  labor-dependent  crops,  such  as  pineapple,  banana,  and  mango,  whose\nproduction is managed by private corporations, abound in the southern part of the country.\n\n17. \nThe southern Philippines, and especially Mindanao, has received a disproportionately low\nshare  of  public  investment  in  infrastructure  with  some  70  percent  of  the  annual  national  budget\nspent in Luzon. The area of the country outside of Luzon, with 72 percent of the total population\nand  80  percent  of  the  rural  population,  receives  only  about  30  percent  of  the  annual  national\nbudget.12 Consequently, the southern Philippines has less well-developed rural infrastructure than\nthe other island groups. For example, only 28.2 percent of Mindanao\u2019s cultivated land is irrigated,\ncompared with nearly 44 percent in the Visayas and 49 percent in Luzon; and only 32.1 percent of\nhouseholds  in  Mindanao  have  access  to  community  water  systems  and  faucets,  compared  with\nnearly 35.5 percent in Visayas and 39 percent in Luzon.\n\n18. \nThe  regions  selected  are  genuinely  poor  in  both  absolute  terms  and  in  relation  to  the\nPhilippines  as  a  whole.  In  summary,  the  project  provinces  (i)  have  a  higher  incidence  of  poor\nfamilies than average (in the ARMM, almost two thirds of the population are below the threshold);\n(ii) fall well below the national average index for income per person and show a high incidence of\nsevere poverty; (iii) have lower population densities than average, corresponding to their relatively\n\n                                                \n10 Municipal and city LGUs in the country are classified based on revenue-generating capacity and their internal revenue\nallotment  share.  These  classifications  range  from  I  to  VI,  with  the  poorest  municipal  LGUs  classified  as  VI  and  the\nrichest classified as I. Provincial LGUs are similarly classified with a range of I to IV.\n\n11 The  Project  covers  779  municipalities  and  chartered  cities  in  40  provinces  of  the  southern  Philippines,  including:\n(i) Mindanao: Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, Basilan, Bukidnon, Camiguin, Compostela, Davao del Norte, Davao\ndel Sur, Davao Oriental, Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Misamis Occidental, Misamis Oriental, North\nCotabato,  Sarangani,  South  Cotabato,  Sultan  Kudarat,  Sulu,  Surigao  del  Norte,  Surigao  del  Sur,  Tawi-Tawi,\nZamboanga del Norte, and Zamboanga del Sur; (ii) eastern Visayas: Biliran, Eastern Samar, Leyte, Northern Samar,\nSouthern  Leyte,  and  Western  Samar;  and  (iii)  Bicol  and  Region  IV:  Albay,  Camarines  Norte,  Camarines  Sur,\nCatanduanes, Masbate, Marinduque, Mindoro Occidental, Mindoro Oriental, Romblon, and Sorsogon.\n\n12 STS: PHI: 28-98: Country Operational Strategy Study, Philippines, May 1998.\n\n\f5\n\nlow level of urbanization and high dependence on agriculture; and (iv) have a human development\nindex value at least 10 percent below the national average.\n\n1. \n\nRural Productivity in the Southern Philippines\n\n19. \nThe  returns  to  the  factors  of  production,  land,  labor,  and  capital,  of  farming  in  the  project\nregions are well below their potential. Stakeholders at participatory workshops held in 23 provinces\nduring  project  formulation  cited  many  constraints  as  responsible  for  these  poor  returns,  including\n(i) high  costs  of  transporting  farm  inputs  to  farms  and  products  to  markets,  (ii)  low  prices  for\nmarketed  products,  (iii)  lack  of  irrigation  facilities  on  some  irrigable  land,  (iv)  high  cost  of  crop\ninputs  and  insufficient  capital  with  which  to  finance  their  purchase,  (v)  high  post-harvest  losses,\n(vi) a  low  level  of  technology  linked  with  a  poorly-functioning  agricultural  extension  service,\n(vii) tenant  farmers\u2019  lack  of  collateral  that  could  be  provided  against  credit  for  the  purchase  of\ninputs, (viii) an average size of holding that precludes economies of scale and the efficient use of\nfarm machinery, (ix) poor health of some farmers and their families, and (x) time spent in fetching\nand carrying water. Many of these constraints can be directly or indirectly ascribed to the absence\nof adequate rural infrastructure.\n\n2. \n\nRural Infrastructure in the Southern Philippines\n\n20. \nThe  selected  project  regions  are  among  the  more  depressed  in  the  country  and  have  an\ninadequate stock of the basic infrastructure needed to increase productivity and alleviate poverty.\nMuch  of  the  existing  economic  and  social  infrastructure  is  in  a  bad  state  of  repair  due  to\nsubstandard  workmanship  and  materials  used  in  construction,  poor  maintenance,  and  in  some\ncases, sheer age, and will require substantial rehabilitation.\n\nThe total road network, consisting of national, city, provincial, municipal, and village roads,\n21. \nof the project area is 75,778 kilometers (km). This accounts for 47 percent of the Philippines\u2019 total\nroad  network.13  The  average  road  density  is  0.49  km/square  kilometer  (km2)  of  land  area,  lower\nthan the national average of 0.54 km/km2, with Western Samar having as little as 0.16 km/km2. Of\nthe  160,970  km  of  road  in  the  Philippines,  only  26,950  km,  or  17  percent  is  paved.  Of  the\n134,220 km of unpaved road, 125,704 km is graveled and 8,416 km is earthen. Some roads were\nformer  logging  roads  and  were  constructed  with  weak  surfaces  and  no  proper  base  or  drainage\nfacilities. Many of the roads constructed earlier by the Government now need to be upgraded.\n\nIn  May  1999,  the  National  Irrigation  Administration  (NIA)  estimated  the  potential  irrigable\n22. \narea  of  the  Philippines  to  be  3.13  million  hectares  (ha).  The  total  area  developed  in  10,883\nschemes  comprises  1.34  million  ha,  representing  only  43  percent  of  the  potential  area.  The\ncandidate  provinces  have  an  irrigable  area  of  1.55  million  ha  (nearly  50  percent  of  the  national\nirrigable  area)  of  which  548,032  ha  or  35  percent  have  been  developed  in  3,330  irrigation\nschemes.  Many  systems  have  deteriorated  because  of  poor  maintenance,  and  some  of  those\nconstructed  more  than  five  years  ago  need  upgrading  or  rehabilitation  to  restore  or  improve\nefficiency.\n\nC. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n23. \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  modernizing  agriculture  and  to  transforming  the\nagriculture  sector  into  an  important  source  of  growth  and  the  basis  for  sustainable  rural\ndevelopment.  It  intends  to  promote  higher-value  crops,  value-added  processing,  agribusiness\nactivities,  and  agro-industrialization  through  the  appropriate  use  of  technology  and  provision  of\nincentives. It seeks to enhance competitiveness in both domestic and foreign markets and attract\nprivate  investments  by  adopting  more  market-oriented  policies  and  providing  adequate  public\ninfrastructure facilities.\n\n24. \nThese  objectives  and  principles  are  enshrined  in  RA  8435  of  1997,  the  Agriculture  and\nFisheries  Modernization  Act  (AFMA)  and  its  implementing  rules  and  regulations  issued  by  DA  in\n\n                                                \n13 Source: Department of Public Works and Highways Atlas, DPWH, Manila, Philippines,1996.\n\n\f6\n\nJuly  1998.  The  AFMA  includes  commitments  to  poverty  alleviation  and  social  equity  as  guiding\nprinciples  of  the  country\u2019s  agricultural  development.14  Its  goal  is  \u201ca  more  equitable  distribution  of\nopportunities,  income  and  wealth;  a  sustained  increase  in  the  amount  of  goods  and  services\nproduced  by  the  nation  for  the  benefit  of  the  people;  and  expanding  productivity  as  the  key  to\nraising the quality of life for all, especially the underprivileged.\u201d\n\nConsistent with RA 8425, the AFMA dictates that poverty alleviation and social equity are to\n25. \nbe given prime consideration by ensuring that the poorer sectors of society have equitable access\nto  resources,  income  opportunities,  basic  and  support  services,  and  infrastructure,  especially  in\nareas where productivity is low, as a means of improving their quality of life compared with other\nsectors  of  society.\u201d  Food  security  is  also  to  be  given  high  priority  to  assure  the  availability,\nadequacy, accessibility, and affordability of food supplies to all at all times.\n\n26. \nThe AFMA recognizes the critical role of agriculture and rural development in the reduction\nof poverty and acknowledges the barriers to such development. In response to these constraints,\nthe  AFMA  puts  great  priority  on  the  planning  and  programming  of  rural  infrastructure  through\nmultisectoral  consultations  involving  the  Government,  NGOs,  people\u2019s  organizations,  and  the\nprivate  sector.  For  example,  medium-  and  long-term  comprehensive  agriculture  and  fisheries\nmodernization  plans  (AFMP)  have  been  prepared  by  DA  using  participatory  methods  and\nincorporating  municipal,  provincial,  and  regional  plans  which,  in  turn,  are  based  on  a  process  of\nstakeholder and beneficiary consultation. The medium-term AFMP serves as the Agricultural and\nFisheries Sector Development Plan in the MTPDP. The AFMP also covers the medium-term and\nannual Agriculture and Fisheries Sector Public Investment Program (AFSPIP) that is incorporated\ninto the Philippine Medium Term Public Investment Program.\n\n27. \nThe  AFMA  also  mandates  that  DA  work  with  its  partner  LGUs  in  developing  plans  for\ninfrastructure for agriculture and fisheries, and strengthening their engineering groups to implement\nthese plans expeditiously. DA is expected to collaborate with other concerned NGAs to accelerate\ncapability building of LGUs to enable them to fulfill their responsibilities under the LGC.\n\n28. \nThere has been substantial underinvestment in the agriculture sector and LGUs have been\nunable  to  provide  the  necessary  agricultural  services  and  infrastructure  on  their  own.  AFMA,\ntherefore,  emphasizes  the  need  for  partnership  and,  in  some  cases,  transitional  arrangements,\nbetween  LGUs  and  the  concerned  NGAs.  These  are  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  required\ntechnical  and  managerial  expertise,  in  addition  to  financial  and  other  resources,  are  made\navailable,  while  resolving  issues  related  to  the  flow  of  foreign  loans  and  grants  to  LGUs.  In  the\ncase  of  irrigation,  the  AFMA  specifies  that  NIA  should  continue  to  be  responsible  for  the  major\nirrigation  structures  of  national  irrigation  systems  (NISs),  while  it  should  gradually  turn  over  the\nsecondary  canals  and  on-farm  facilities  of  NISs  to  irrigators\u2019  associations  (IAs).  The  planning,\ndesign, and management of communal irrigation systems (CISs) and communal irrigation projects\n(CIPs)  are  to  be  devolved  to  the  LGUs.  Likewise,  the  budget  for  construction,  operation,  and\nmaintenance  of  CISs  and  CIPs  should  be  prepared  by  and  routed  through  LGUs.  NIA  should\ncontinue to provide technical assistance as long as necessary. LGUs are also mandated to make\nrural  roads  a  priority  investment  and  provide  at  least  10  percent  of  project  cost,  subject  to  their\ninternal revenue allotment level.\n\nD. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n29. \nThe  Philippines  has  received  substantial  loans  and  grants  from  external  sources  for  rural\ninfrastructure development. The assistance has been concentrated in new and rehabilitated small-,\nmedium-,  and  large-scale  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure,  and  rural  roads.  The  assistance\nhas  been  led  by  ADB,  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD),  Japan  Bank  for\n\n                                                \n14  AFMA\u2019s  implementing  rules  and  regulations  include  provisions  that  \u201cthe  State  shall  ensure  the  development  of  the\nagriculture  and  fisheries  sector  in  accordance  with  the  following  principles:  (i)  poverty  alleviation  and  social  equity,\n(ii) food  security,  (iii)  rational  use  of  resources,  (iv)  global  competitiveness,  (v)  sustainable  development,  and\n(vi) people\u2019s empowerment.\u201d\n\n\f7\n\nInternational  Cooperation,15  and  World  Bank.  Several  bilateral  agencies,  including  the  Danish\nInternational  Development  Agency  (Danida),  the  European  Union,  United  States  Agency  for\nInternational Development (USAID), and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), have\nalso been active in supporting irrigation improvements.\n\n30. \nADB  has  been  closely  coordinating  with  these  agencies  to  address  critical  issues  of\ncommon  concern,  including  promoting  improved  cost  recovery  and  operations  and  maintenance\n(O&M),  and  advancing  the  devolution  of  responsibilities  for  planning  and  developing  rural\ninfrastructure. In addition to geographical coordination to avoid overlaps between projects, ADB\u2019s\ncoordination  efforts  have  focused  on  ensuring  that  a  consistent  approach  be  applied  to  cost-\nsharing  formulas  among  the  Government,  participating  LGUs,  and  beneficiaries;  as  well  as  to\nbeneficiary  contributions  to  O&M  and  cost  recovery.  Considering  the  similar  assistance  provided\nunder  the  World  Bank\u2019s  ongoing  Mindanao  Rural  Development  Project,16  ADB  consulted\nintensively  with  the  World  Bank  to  avoid  overlaps  and  unnecessary  competition  between  the  two\nprojects.17\n\nE. \n\nLessons Learned\n\nThe  majority  of  ADB  projects  involving  small-scale  rural  infrastructure  in  the  Philippines\n31. \nhave  been  area  development  projects,  including  two  in  Palawan,18  one  in  Sorsogon,19  one  in\nBukidnon,20  one  in  Maguindanao,21  one  in  Zamboanga  del  Sur  and  Zamboanga  del  Norte,22  and\none in the Cordillera Administrative Region.23 ADB\u2019s first Palawan project (footnote 18) received a\npartly  successful  performance  rating,  the  project  in  Sorsogon  (footnote  19)  has  been  rated  as\ngenerally  successful,  and  remaining  projects  are  ongoing  and  rated  as  satisfactory.  ADB\u2019s  most\nrecent project involving small-scale rural infrastructure in the Philippines is the Rural Infrastructure\nDevelopment  Project  (footnote  22).  Major  lessons  learned  during  implementation  of  this  project\ninclude: (i) provision and/or improvement of access infrastructure in areas with agricultural potential\ncan make a significant difference in farm income; (ii) LGU and beneficiary involvement at all levels\nof  project  conceptualization,  design,  and  implementation  is  crucial  to  sustained  O&M;  (iii)  use  of\nlabor-based  equipment-supported  techniques  for  O&M  can  be  cost-effective  and  increase  local\nownership by providing opportunities for part-time employment; and (iv) small road-based toll fees\ncan be levied against traders and used to offset O&M costs.\n\n32. \nADB\u2019s  experience  with  devolved  implementation  arrangements  and  dealing  directly  with\nLGUs has been limited primarily to larger urban LGUs and provincial LGUs.24 These projects are\nongoing, though preliminary results suggest that the participation of urban LGUs may be somewhat\nmore susceptible to changes in political leadership and priority than participation of smaller LGUs.\nThe World Bank\u2019s Agrarian Reform Communities Development Project (ARCDP) I, however, deals\n\n                                                \n15 The Japan Bank for International Cooperation was created on 1 October 1999 as a result of the merger between the\nExport-Import  Bank  of  Japan  and  the  Overseas  Economic  Cooperation  Fund.  The  latter  had  been  a  major  donor\nsupporting rural infrastructure development in the country.\n\n16 The  World  Bank\u2019s Mindanao Rural Development Project,  approved  in  November  1999  for  $27.5  million,  covers  the\n\nprovinces of Agusan del Sur, Compostela, Maguindanao, North Cotabato, and Sultan Kudarat.\n\n17 These  consultations  resulted  in  cost-sharing  arrangements  (para.  80)  and  selection  criteria  (para.  100)  that  do  not\n\nresult in one project providing significantly more favorable terms to LGUs than the other.\n\n18 Loans  528/529(SF)-PHI: Palawan Integrated Area Development Project,  for  $32.0  million/$15.0  million,  approved  on\n29 September  1981,  and  closed  in  May  1991;  and  Loans  1033(SF)/1034-PHI: Second Palawan Integrated Area\nDevelopment Project, for $25.0 million/$33.0 million, approved on 27 September 1990.\n\n19 Loan 915(SF)-PHI: Sorsogon Integrated Area Development Project, for $24.1 million, approved on 3 November 1988,\n\nand closed in April 1997.\n\n1991.\n\n20 Loan 1453-PHI: Bukidnon Integrated Area Development Project, for $20.0 million, approved on 23 July 1996.\n21 Loan 1136(SF)-PHI: Kabulnan Irrigation and Area Development Project, for $48.0 million, approved on 28 November\n\n22 Loan 1332-PHI: Rural Infrastructure Development Project, for $17.5 million, approved on 10 November 1994.\n23 Loans  1421/1422(SF)-PHI:  Cordillera  Highland  Agricultural  Resource  Management  Project,  for  $18.05  million,\n\napproved on 11 January 1996.\n\n24 For  example,  Loan  1599-PHI:  Subic  Bay  Area  Municipal  Development  Project,  for  $22  million,  approved  on\n19 December  1997;  Loan  1658-PHI:  Clark Area Municipal Development Project,  for  $24.3  million,  approved  on\n15 December 1998; and Loan 1453-PHI (footnote 20).\n\n\f8\n\ndirectly with small rural LGUs and will be completed 1.5 years ahead of schedule. A recent World\nBank briefing paper on the project states \"in the design phase of the ARCDP I, grave doubts were\nheld  as  to  the  capability  of  the  LGUs  to  implement  this  project.  Those  fears  have  proved\ngroundless and indeed the participation of the LGUs has been a critical success factor.\" A recently\ncompleted  review  mission  of  ADB\u2019s  Agrarian  Reform  Communities  Project25  came  to  a  similar\nconclusion and found a high level of commitment and implementation capacity among participating\nLGUs.\n\n33. \nOver  the  past  few  years,  there  has  been  increasing  convergence  of  ideas  on  how\nforeign-assisted  projects  should  be  designed  and  implemented,  especially  those  whose  targeted\nbeneficiaries  are  rural  communities  and  LGUs.  The  lessons  learned  from  the  successes  and\nfailures  of  completed  projects  have  been  similar  across  sectors  and  even  across  countries,  as\nADB\u2019s  postevaluation  findings  show.26  Relevant  lessons  learned  include  (i)  a  strong  coordinating\nbody is required, (ii) project management should be accessible to the project area, (iii) procedures\nfor  the  release  of  funds  to  implementing  agencies  must  be  streamlined,  (iv) comprehensive  ADB\nsupervision  and  reviews  are  necessary,  (v)  rural  infrastructure  (roads  and  irrigation  systems)\nmaintenance must be ensured, (vi) adequate resources for engineering designs must be provided,\nand  (vii)  the  performance  of  contractors  for  infrastructure  and  compliance  with  design  standards\n(construction supervision) must be  closely monitored. A summary of lessons learned from recent\nADB-financed projects is given in Appendix 2.\n\n34. \nThe most important problem that has been noted, whether the projects involve rural roads,\ncommunal  irrigation,  or  water  supply,  is  the  failure  to  ensure  the  sustainable  operation  and\ncontinued  maintenance  of  the  facilities  created.  This  was  generally  due  to  (i)  the  lack  of\ninvolvement  and  participation  of  the  communities  that  were  the  supposed  beneficiaries  of  the\nproject,  and  (ii)  the  lack  of  LGU  involvement  and  committed  counterpart  funds  for  O&M.  It  is\ntherefore  important  that  (i)  targeted  beneficiaries  and  potential  users  be  organized  and  involved\nfrom  the  very  beginning  of  the  project  cycle,  from  project  identification  and  site  selection  through\nproject  design  and \nimplementation;  and  (ii)  LGUs  and  end-users  have  clearly  defined\nresponsibilities for O&M of facilities that are agreed upon in advance. A participatory, community-\nbased  approach  to  project  planning  and  implementation  is  a  major  prerequisite  for  ensuring  the\nquality  and  sustainability  of  small-scale  infrastructure  in  rural  areas.  Such  an  approach  will  also\nmake the project less susceptible to change in political leadership and development priorities.\n\n35.  More  than  just  the  beneficiary  communities  themselves,  the  concerned  LGUs  should  be\nactively involved in the process and committed to the provision of O&M. They should not merely be\nconsulted, but be the lead implementers of projects. The LGC recognizes the difficulties inherent in\nhaving  rural  infrastructure  projects  provided  and  maintained  by  the  national  government.  While\nNGAs  should  continue  to  provide  policy  guidance  and  technical  support,  the  concerned  LGU\nshould  coordinate  with  all  participating  agencies  and  be  solely  responsible  for  the  project\u2019s\noutcome.  As  much  as  possible,  the  LGUs  should  also,  whether  singly  or  as  a  group,  take  the\ninitiative in prioritizing their needs and securing the financing to meet these needs.\n\nF. \n\nADB\u2019s Sectoral Strategy\n\n36. \nADB\u2019s operational strategy for the Philippines, revised in 1998, gives increased emphasis to\npoverty  reduction  and  social  development  (footnote  12).  In  particular,  the  strategy  promotes\nequitable  growth,  better  provision  of  basic  social  services,  and  environmental  protection.  The\nstrategy  recognizes  that  rural  development  is  a  key  to  advancing  equitable  growth  and  poverty\nreduction,  and  supports  more  balanced  regional  development,  with  special  emphasis  on  the\nsouthern Philippines. In support of the LGC, ADB also supports the devolution of project planning\nand implementation to LGUs through strengthening local institutional and financial capacity. ADB\u2019s\nsectoral  strategy  identifies  lack  of  an  appropriate  policy  environment  and  inadequate  rural\n\n                                                \n25 Loan 1667-PHI: Agrarian Reform Communities Project, for $93 million, approved on 18 December 1998.\n26 ADB.

The proposed Project is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s country and sector strategy, and\ncontributes to achieving ADB\u2019s overarching objective of poverty reduction.\n\nG. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nPolicy  dialogue  during  project  preparation  has  focused  on  advancing  decentralization,\n\n37. \nimproving O&M for infrastructure, and promoting beneficiary participation.\n\n1. \n\nStrengthened Decentralization\n\n38. \nUnder the LGC, greater responsibilities for rural development have been devolved to LGUs.\nWith  LGU-led  implementation  arrangements  and  a  fully  decentralized  funds  flow  mechanism,  the\nProject  will  advance  the  implementation  of  the  LGC,  particularly  the  devolution  of  responsibilities\nfor rural development to municipal-level LGUs. Under the Project, LGUs will be directly responsible\nfor  identifying,  appraising,  implementing,  and  monitoring  subprojects  while  DA  will  focus  on\nproviding  overall  guidance  and  policy  support.  LGU  eligibility  criteria,  supported  by  the  demand-\ndriven  structure,  will  ensure  that  the  participating  LGUs  have  strong  commitment  and  adequate\ninstitutional and financial capacity to implement, maintain, and monitor the subprojects (para. 100).\n\n39. \nTo promote local autonomy in financial planning and management, the loan proceeds and\nGovernment  counterpart  funds  for  rural  infrastructure  investments  will  be  directly  channeled  to\nLGUs  through  municipal  development  fund  (MDF)  mechanisms  (or  other  mechanisms  that  are\nconsidered appropriate at the time of project implementation).28 The Government will ensure that\nadequate counterpart funds for rural infrastructure investments are allocated directly to MDF. This\nwill advance fiscal decentralization and increase financial accountability at the local level. To gain\nstrong ownership by LGUs of rural infrastructure provided under the Project, the participating LGUs\nwill be required to share a specific portion of the investment cost (para. 80).\n\n40. \nTo ensure that LGUs are equipped with adequate institutional and technical capabilities, the\nProject  will  train  LGU  staff  in  participatory  project  planning  and  implementation,  contract\nsupervision  and  procurement  procedures,  and  participatory  project  benefit  monitoring  and\nevaluation.\n\n2. \n\nImproved Operation and Maintenance\n\n41. \nInadequate  O&M  and  poor  cost  recovery  are  among  the  major  reasons  for  the  failure  of\nmany rural infrastructure projects. The Government has been trying to improve O&M performance\nin rural infrastructure by devolving major O&M responsibilities to LGUs and beneficiaries. Lessons\nlearned  demonstrate  that  O&M  improves  when  LGUs  and  beneficiary  communities  have  been\ninvolved  in  identifying  and  implementing  rural  infrastructure  projects  (para.  34).  The  Project  is\ndesigned to improve O&M of rural infrastructure by promoting decentralized and participatory O&M\nand  cost-recovery  arrangements  (paras.  82-86).  In  line  with  the  LGC,  municipal  LGUs  and\nbeneficiaries will be fully responsible for O&M of infrastructure facilities provided under the Project.\nFor  CISs  and  CIPs,  LGUs  will  ensure  that  irrigators\u2019  associations  (IAs)  assume  responsibility  for\nroutine O&M works and recover full costs of O&M from their members through user charges and\nlabor contribution. For potable water supply facilities, LGUs will work with village waterworks and\nsanitation associations (VWSAs) in collecting user charges and in conducting O&M of the systems.\n\n                                                \n27 Some of the major policy and institutional constraints will be addressed by Loans 1739/1740-PHI (footnote 5).\n28 One possible alternative mechanism is the LGU Development Facility (LGU-DF), currently being designed with ADB\u2019s\nTA  3145-PHI:  Strengthening Public Finance and Planning of Local Government Units,  for  $870,000,  approved  in\nDecember 1998.\n\n\f10\n\nSimilarly,  where  possible,  mechanisms  such  as  users  fees  will  be  introduced  for  access\ninfrastructure to contribute to O&M costs.\n\n42. \nTo  ensure  strong  commitment  from  LGUs  and  beneficiary  organizations  (i.e.,  IAs  and\nVWSAs) and taking into account lessons learned from previous projects, the conclusion of relevant\nimplementation  agreements,  specifying  O&M \nresponsibilities  of  LGUs  and  beneficiary\norganizations, is a precondition of support to all subprojects. Failure on the part of LGUs to comply\nwith this agreement will result in a heavy financial penalty, including converting Government grant\ninto  a  LGU  loan  from  MDF.  Furthermore,  LGUs  that  fail  to  properly  maintain  the  facilities  will  be\ndisqualified from similar assistance from the Government and foreign funding sources.  To promote\nimproved O&M, the Project will provide relevant training to LGUs and beneficiary organizations on\ntechnical requirements for routine O&M and cost recovery mechanisms (para. 61).\n\n3. \n\nGreater Participation and Transparency\n\n43. \nThe Project is designed to ensure that participatory approaches are applied at all stages of\nproject implementation. As a precondition to project support, LGUs will be required to demonstrate\nthat  a  subproject  is  identified  through  a  community  consultation  process  (paras.  62  and  100).\nParticipating  communities  will  also  be  directly  involved  in  designing  the  subprojects,  supervising\nconstruction,  and  operating  and  maintaining  the  facilities.  To  nurture  strong  ownership  from  the\ncommunities,  beneficiaries  will  be  contributing  a  portion  of  investment  costs  for  CIS,  CIP  and/or\npotable  water  supply  facilities  in  cash  or  in-kind  (para.  80).  This  arrangement  will  promote\nbeneficiaries\u2019 right to participate in subproject development and will foster greater commitment to\nO&M of the facilities. Willingness of the communities to provide cash or in-kind contributions was\nconfirmed through extensive beneficiary consultations during project preparation.\n\nTo  promote  greater  transparency  in  project  implementation,  the  Project  will  establish  an\n44. \nindependent participatory project performance monitoring system for each subproject. The system\nwill allow beneficiary communities to systematically provide feedback on the progress of subproject\nimplementation and the effectiveness and impact of subproject activities. (paras. 65 and121).\n\n IV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n1. \n\nProject Rationale\n\n45. \nAgriculture  dominates  the  economy  of  the  Philippines  despite  the  development  of\nsubstantial manufacturing and service sectors. Even the manufacturing sector largely depends on\nagriculture for its raw materials. Although 36 percent of the population depends on agriculture for\nlivelihood,  the  country\u2019s  agriculture  sector  is  performing  below  its  potential,  national  economic\ngrowth is being held back by the slow and erratic progress of agricultural development, and most of\nthose  engaged  in  the  sector  remain  poor.  The  Government  has  recognized  the  need  for\nmodernization of the sector by promulgating AFMA. The Project will complement the Government\u2019s\nplans  to  stimulate  rural  growth  by  focusing  on  traditionally  neglected  areas  with  high  agricultural\ngrowth potential.\n\nInadequate rural infrastructure stands out as a principal cause of the constraints that many\n46. \npoor farmers face in becoming more productive and profitable. Chief among them is the difficulty\nand  cost  of  hauling  their  inputs  to  the  farm  and  their  outputs  to  market  caused  by  the  lack  of\naccess infrastructure (including rural roads, landings, etc.). In extreme cases, farmers are inhibited\nfrom  planting  any  crops  on  their  land,  or  grow  only  that  which  is  sufficient  for  their  subsistence\nneeds.  In  others,  farmers  are  deterred  from  switching  to  higher  value  crops  because  of  the\nbulkiness  of  some,  such  as  fruit  and  vegetables.  Yields  are  below  potential  because  insufficient\n\n\f11\n\ninputs  are  applied.  Gross  margins  of  farm  enterprises  are  reduced  by  the  cost  of  haulage.29  The\nabsence of irrigation infrastructure where both suitable land (with regard to soils and topography)\nand sufficient water coexist, prevents the land from attaining its full productive and profit potential.\nThe members of some rural communities are unable to be as productive as they should because of\neither  waterborne  diseases  caused  by  polluted  drinking  water  or  the  time  spent  in  fetching  water\nfrom  a  distant  source.  The  main  thrust  of  the  Project  will  be  to  remove  these  constraints  in  the\nproject area. This approach is consistent with ADB\u2019s sectoral strategy, which recognizes improved\nrural infrastructure as the key to sustainable rural development and poverty reduction.\n\nSince  1991  and  the  advent  of  the  LGC,  the  Philippines  has  been  undergoing  a  major\n47. \ndecentralization process, where provincial and municipal LGUs are being made more responsible\nfor rural development, while NGAs assume the roles of facilitator and supporter. To enable LGUs\nto  discharge  these  new  responsibilities,  resource  transfers  from  NGAs  to  LGUs  have  increased,\nparticularly  since  the  mid-1990s.  However,  full  financial  decentralization  has  yet  to  be  realized  in\nsocial  and  urban  services  and  in  the  agriculture  sector.  The  Project  addresses  this  challenge  by\nmaking  LGUs responsible for rural infrastructure investments and shifting DA\u2019s concentration to its\ncore functions of policy formulation, monitoring, and analysis. The Project will thus contribute to the\npromotion of good governance in addition to agricultural growth and rural poverty reduction.\n\n48. \nThe  Project  will  adopt  an  approach  that  differs  in  many  respects  from  that  of  earlier\nGovernment and ADB interventions in the rural sector.  It will be driven by the needs and demands\nof communities that lack the infrastructure essential for them to realize the productive potential of\ntheir  land.  Proposals  emanating  from  LGUs  for  subprojects  that  meet  financial,  economic,  and\npoverty  reduction-related  eligibility  criteria  will  be  considered  for  acceptance  by  the  Project  for\nfinancing  and  implementation.  This  demand-driven  sector  approach  will  reduce  the  risk  that\ninterventions  either  do  not  meet  the  priorities  of  the  recipient  community  or  do  not  achieve\nexpected gains in productivity because communities had no sense of ownership, with consequent\nfailure to operate or maintain the infrastructure adequately.30\n\n49. \nThe  Project  concept  also  assumes  that  in  many  areas  the  provision  of  an  element  of\ninfrastructure  will  complete  a  system  and  enable  substantial  gains  in  productivity  to  be  realized.\nCompleted,  ongoing,  or  planned  programs/projects  in  the  project  area  offer  opportunities  for\nsynergy  and  consequently,  gains  in  productivity  can  be  greater  than  where  subprojects  are\nimplemented  in  isolation.  Eligibility  criteria  are  framed  to  exclude  LGUs  where  competing  or\noverlapping projects are being or will be implemented, but to allow for the inclusion of subprojects\nthat will generate synergy with other interventions in the area.\n\n2. \n\nProject Area\n\nThe project area is defined as Bicol, eastern Visayas, Mindanao, and the island provinces\n50. \nof  Region  IV  (paras.  14-22).    Individual  subprojects  will  be  located  in  areas  where  agricultural\ngrowth potential is visible, that have been traditionally neglected by infrastructure investment, and\nwhere the incidence of poverty is relatively high. The regions selected are genuinely poor in both\nabsolute  terms  and  in  relation  to  the  Philippines  as  a  whole.  These  regions  also  have  a  greater\nneed for infrastructure and, especially in Mindanao, higher potential for enhanced productivity than\nmost other provinces.\n\n3. \n\nSector Approach\n\n51. \nThe  sector  approach  is  appropriate  considering  that  the  Government  has  formulated\nAFSPIP in line with the AFMP to meet the needs of the sector as identified in the AFMA (paras. 23-\n28). The total investment needs identified in the AFSPIP amount to approximately $1.5 billion for\n\n                                                \n29 Experience from Loan 1332-PHI (footnote 22) has shown that simple provision/improvement of rural roads (in areas\nwith high agricultural potential) can result in increases in productivity of between 16 and 35 percent and increases in\nincome of nearly 80 percent.\n\n30 The  World  Bank\u2019s  Agrarian Reform Communities Development Project  has  demonstrated  that  a  demand-driven\n\napproach dealing directly with LGUs can be extremely effective (para. 32).\n\n\f12\n\nkey  rural  infrastructure  over  the  2000-2006  period.  Out  of  the  total,  about  40  percent  (or\napproximately  $600  million)  is  expected  to  be  directed  to  the  southern  Philippines.  Based  on  the\ndemand  for  rural  infrastructure  and  an  assessment  of  potential  LGUs\u2019  ability  to  satisfy  project\neligibility  criteria  (para.  100),  approximately  100  subprojects  are  likely  to  be  developed  and\nfinanced  during  project  implementation.  The  Project  will  provide  infrastructure  investment  and\ncapacity-building activities to the LGUs in these subproject sites. The Project will finance about a\nquarter of the total investment identified under AFSPIP.\n\n52. \nTen  core  subprojects  that  are  representative  in  terms  of  size  and  scope  of  proposals\nanticipated  from  LGUs  in  the  project  area  were  developed  during  project  preparation.31  These\nsubprojects  consisted  of  either  CIS/CIP  development  or  segments  of \nroad\nconstruction/rehabilitation,  or  both.32  Of  the  10  core  subprojects,  4  consisted  of  only  rural  road\nconstruction/rehabilitation, 1 of only CIS rehabilitation, and the remaining 5 a combination of CIS,\nCIP, and rural roads. Total investment costs for the individual subprojects range from $0.37 million\nto $2.29 million with an average investment of $1.08 million per core subproject (para. 140). The\ntotal project cost was derived from the cost estimates for the 10 core subprojects.\n\nrural \n\n53. \nDA  is  well  established  and  experienced,  and  has  the  capacity  to  implement  projects\nsatisfactorily.33 Through detailed eligibility and subproject feasibility criteria, the Project is designed\nto  ensure  that  investment  support  is  provided  only  to  LGUs  that  can  demonstrate  strong\ncommitment and adequate project implementation capacity (paras. 100 and 101). To complement\nDA\u2019s  and  participating  LGUs\u2019  capacity,  the  Project  will  also  provide  capacity  building  and  project\nmanagement  support.  Finally,  the  sector  approach  is  essential  to  reinforce  the  demand-driven\nprinciple being applied in the subproject selection process.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n \n\n1. \n\nObjectives\n\n54. \nThe  long-term  development  goal  is  to  increase  rural  incomes  with  distributional  gains\nfavoring the poor in areas with high agricultural potential. The immediate objectives of the Project\nare to (i) remove the constraints to the improvement of agricultural productivity caused by the lack\nor  inadequacy  of  rural  infrastructure,  and  (ii)  reduce  rural  poverty  by  increasing  agricultural\nproductivity and profitability. This will be achieved by the provision of infrastructure in areas where\nthere  is  potential  for  sustainable  gains  in  productivity  that  will,  in  turn,  lead  to  increases  in  rural\nincomes, particularly for farmers and the poor. The project framework is attached as Appendix 1.\n\n2. \n\nScope\n\nThe Project will have three components: improved rural infrastructure, capacity building for\n\n55. \ndevolved project implementation and management, and project management and coordination.\n\na. \n\nImproved Rural Infrastructure\n\nThe Project will provide the following infrastructure where there is potential for substantially\n\n56. \nenhanced productivity with pro-poor distributional effects:\n\n(i) \n\nAccess infrastructure: In areas with potential for vertical or horizontal expansion of\nagriculture, the Project will finance upgrading/rehabilitation of rural roads (primarily\n\n                                                \n31 In  addition  to  feasibility  studies,  sample  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  and  resettlement  plans  were\nprepared.  The  feasibility  studies  and  IEEs  are  available  in  Supplementary  Appendixes  A  and  D.  A  summary\nresettlement plan is in Appendix 8 and the resettlement plan is available in Supplementary Appendix E.\n\n32 The  core  subprojects  are:  Aloran,  Misamis  Occidental  (rural  roads  and  CIS);  Bayugan,  Agusan  del  Sur  (rural  roads\nand CIS); Calbayog City, Western Samar (rural roads); Dolores, Eastern Samar (rural roads); Hinunangan, Southern\nLeyte  (rural  roads);  Jiabong,  Western  Samar  (rural  roads);  Kapalong,  Davao  del  Norte  (rural  roads,  CIS,  and  CIP);\nMainit, Surigao del Norte (rural roads, CIS, and CIP); San Jose City, Occidental Mindoro (rural roads and CIS); and\nSurigao City, Surigao del Norte (CIS and CIP).\n\n33 DA is currently responsible for seven ADB-funded projects and two TAs, one World Bank-funded project, and several\n\nsmaller bilateral activities (para. 125).\n\n\f13\n\nmunicipal  and  village)  and  the  connection  of  areas  with  agricultural  potential  (that\nhave no current transport access).\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCommunal irrigation: In suitable land with productivity potential to justify investment,\nthe Project will rehabilitate or expand CISs and/or construct new CIPs.34\n\nPotable  water  supply:  The  Project  will  finance  potable  community  water  supply\nschemes  in  places  where  (a)  the  present  source  is  either  contaminated  or  so  far\nfrom the habitation that considerable potentially productive time is spent in fetching\nwater, (b) there is a potential source of supply that is uncontaminated and could be\ndeveloped  in  a  cost-effective  manner,  and  (c)  the  supply  of  potable  water\ncontributes to agricultural production and improved health.\n\n57. \nSimilar  to  the  10  core  subprojects,  candidate  LGUs  will  submit  subproject  proposals\ncomprising one or a combination of access infrastructure, communal irrigation, and potable water\nsupply. Total subproject cost must fall between $250,000 and $5 million equivalent.\n\ni. \n\nAccess Infrastructure\n\nThe  Project  will  construct  and/or  upgrade  access  infrastructure.35  The  type  of  work  that\n\n58. \ncould be financed will include\n\nupgrading  to  all-weather  status  and  extension  of  existing  rural  roads  and  former\nlogging roads;\n\nupgrading of trails or footpaths to all-weather rural roads;\n\nconstruction  or  upgrading  of  other  transportation  infrastructure  (including  landing\nfacilities, etc.) that will enhance productivity by linking production areas to markets;\n\nrehabilitation and construction of drainage canals, culverts, and side drains;\n\nrehabilitation and construction of single lane concrete and overflow bridges;\n\nslope protection works; and\n\nin  a  small  number  of  cases,  construction  of  landings,  cableways,  and  cable-\nsuspended footbridges.\n\nii. \n\nCommunal Irrigation\n\nThe Project will rehabilitate existing CISs and construct CIPs in areas with the potential for\n\n59. \nhigher productivity.36 The scope of the subcomponent will include\n\nrehabilitation and construction of diversion weirs;\n\nrehabilitation and expansion of CISs;\n\nconstruction of new CIPs;\n\nrepair and construction of drainage canals;\n\nrepair and construction of communal flood protection and drainage systems; and\n\ndesilting, concrete lining, and expansion of irrigation canals.\n\niii. \n\nPotable Water Supply\n\n60. \nIn  response  to  the  priority  placed  by  rural  communities  (particularly  women)  on  the\nprovision of safe potable water, the Project will support the rehabilitation and construction of point\n\n                                                \n34 The  Project  will  support  only  those  CISs  that  are  defective  due  to  either  faulty  design  or  inadequate  canals  and\nstructures, or those damaged as the result of a natural calamity (rather than solely due to inadequate maintenance).\n35 Based  on  the  core  subprojects,  it  is  estimated  that  approximately  800  km  of  rural  roads  will  be  constructed/\n\n36 Based on the core subprojects, an estimated 8,000 hectares of irrigation facilities will be rehabilitated or constructed\n\nrehabilitated under the Project.\n\nunder the Project.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n\f14\n\nsource and communal faucet spring and tubewell development projects.37 The following activities\nwill be covered:\n\nconstruction of intake boxes at springs,\n\nconstruction of reservoir and break pressure tanks,\n\nlaying of distribution pipes and construction,\n\ninstallation of tap stands, and\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\ndrilling  of  tubewells  and  provision  of  hand  pumps  where  groundwater  of  adequate\nquality for cost-effective extraction is present.\n\nb. \n\nCapacity Building for Devolved Project Implementation and\nManagement\n\n61. \nThe  project  design  is  based  on  the  assumption  of  new  or  substantially  changed\nresponsibilities  at  the  LGU  level  within  the  process  of  planning,  implementing,  and  maintaining\nrural infrastructure. To ensure that these responsibilities are effectively carried out, the Project will\nsupport  a  program  of  capacity  building  that  will  include  the  strengthening  of  LGUs,  NGOs,  and\ncommunity  organizations  in  the  subproject  sites.    The  major  beneficiaries  of  this  training  will  be\nLGU  administrators  and  staff.  This  strengthening  will  be  effected  mainly  through  locally  based\ntraining  provided  by  specialist  organizations  supported  by  regular  on-the-job  training  from  the\nexpert  pool  and,  as  appropriate,  staff  of  the  project  office.  The  capacity-building  program  will\ninclude the following elements.\n\ni. \n\nIntegrated Rural Accessibility Planning\n\nTo  ensure  that  subprojects  proposed  by  LGUs  reflect  the  needs  and  priorities  of  the\n62. \nbeneficiary communities and to enhance the development planning capacity of participating LGUs,\nthe  Project  will  coordinate  with  the  ongoing  International  Labour  Organization\u2019s  (ILO)  Integrated\nRural  Accessibility  Planning  (IRAP)  project.  The  IRAP  focuses  on  rural  communities  and  targets\nmajor  actors  of  local  decision-making:  planners  and  technical  staff,  local  chief  executives,\nmembers of the Sangguniang Bayan (local legislative council), and the local development councils.\nIRAP  is  a  needs-based,  multisectoral,  gender-sensitive  methodology  for  local-level  planning  that\naims  to  contribute  to  socioeconomic  development  and  poverty  reduction  by  setting  up  effective\ndevelopment planning capacity at the local, regional, and national levels.38\n\nCandidate  LGUs  will  participate  in  IRAP  (or,  under  some  circumstances,  other  similar\n\n63. \nplanning exercises) before submitting project proposals for consideration.\n\nii. \n\nStrengthening LGUs\n\nParticipating  LGUs  will  be  strengthened,  primarily  through  on-the-job  training,  in  the\n\n64. \nfollowing areas:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nproject management using participatory planning tools and techniques;\n\npreparation  of  subproject  proposals,  including  familiarity  with  the  process  and\ncontent of feasibility studies;\n\ncontract  management  and  supervision,  particularly \nconstruction and maintenance;\n\nfor \n\nrural \n\ninfrastructure\n\nfinancial  management,  particularly  procedures  involved  in  disbursement  and\nreplenishment of loans;\n\n                                                \n37 Based  on  the  core  subprojects,  it  is  estimated  that  approximately  300  point  source  and  spring  and  tubewell  water\n\nsupply systems will be constructed or rehabilitated under the Project.\n\n38 The two basic IRAP improvement strategies are (i) bringing the people closer to the goods, services, and facilities by\nenhancing their mobility through improvements of roads and transport systems; and (ii) bringing the goods, services,\nand facilities closer to the people through proper site selection and location.\n\n\f15\n\n(v) \n\nmonitoring and evaluation of project results and assessment of the project\u2019s impact\non poverty; and\n\n(vi) \n\nenvironmental analysis and management.\n\niii. \n\nParticipatory Monitoring and Evaluation of Subprojects\n\nRather than simply monitoring the physical progress of civil works construction/completion,\n65. \nevaluation  of  subprojects  will  be  based  on  the  subproject\u2019s  impact  on  agricultural  growth  and  on\npoverty  reduction.  This  evaluation  is  best  performed  through  a  participatory  monitoring  and\nevaluation mechanism in cooperation with private sector, NGOs, peoples\u2019 organizations, etc. This\nwill  be  effected  through  an  initial  program  of  training  of  trainers  that  will  be  contracted  to  a\nprofessional  entity.  The  private  sector  or  NGOs  will  later  be  contracted  to  monitor  and  evaluate\nsubprojects  (in  close  coordination  with  the  subproject  monitoring  boards  [para.  121])  and  assess\nsubproject impact on income, agricultural growth, and poverty reduction (para. 123).\n\niv. \n\nStrengthening Community Organizations in O&M\n\n66. \nCommunities will contribute greatly to routine O&M of infrastructure (access infrastructure)\nand  the  collection  of  revenue  to  contribute  to  O&M  costs  (CIS/CIP  and  water  supply).  To  ensure\nthat the completed facilities are maintained, the Project will support the strengthening of community\norganizations\u2019  capacity  for  undertaking  O&M  and  for  promoting  cost  recovery.  The  Project  (in\nconjunction  with  NGOs,  the  private  sector,  and  appropriate  Government  agencies)  will  train\ncommunity organizations, VWSAs, and IAs in communities to which infrastructure is provided.\n\nv. \n\nDepartment of Agriculture\n\nDA, as the Executing Agency for the Project and in its capacity as the lead agency for the\n\n67. \nagriculture sector, will be assisted to improve its capacity at central and field levels in\n\nsetting clear sectoral policy directions;\n\nmanaging  beneficiary-driven \nin\ncoordination and facilitation) a broad range of projects in partnership with LGUs and\nthe private sector; and\n\ninfrastructural  developments  and  (particularly \n\n(iii) \n\nprescribing  and  implementing  procedures  for  results  and  benefits  monitoring  and\nevaluation, and auditing.\n\nc. \n\nProject Management and Coordination\n\n68. \nFor  successful  project  implementation  LGUs,  communities,  and  contractors  will  have  to\nperform a number of functions. The project management and coordination component will ensure\nthat the Project provides the major outputs effectively. It will therefore support the requirements for\nstaffing, operations, and equipment for\n\nan interagency and intersectoral project management committee (PMC), chaired by\nthe  secretary  of  DA,  with  its  main  function  to  provide  policy  guidance  and  overall\nproject direction;\n\na  lean  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  at  the  central  office  of  DA  to  provide\nsecretariat  support  to  the  PMC,  and  liase  with  the  oversight  agencies  (National\nEconomic  and  Development  Authority  [NEDA],  Department  of  Finance  [DOF],\nDepartment  of  Budget  and  Management  [DBM],  and  Municipal  Development  Fund\nOffice [MDFO] within DOF) and with the funding agencies;\n\nproject  advocacy  support,  prequalification  endorsement,  and  subproject  approval\nfrom associated DA regional field units (RFUs);\n\nevaluation  of  LGU  financial  capacities  by  the  MDFO  and  the  Bureau  of  Local\nGovernment Finance (BLGF); and\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n\f16\n\n(v) \n\na  project  office  that  is  responsible  for  coordinating  subprojects,  assisting  or\nfacilitating  the  preparation  of  quality  subproject  proposals,  and  delivering  the\nrequired inputs to LGUs in a timely and effective manner.\n\n69. \nThe  project  office  will  be  contracted  to  a  firm  that  specializes  in  the  management  of  rural\ndevelopment  projects.  This  arrangement  will  (i)  address  the  Government\u2019s  concerns  vis-\u00e0-vis\nreducing  the  number  of  public  sector  employees  and  will  avoid  long-term  budget  and  staff\nimplications, (ii) enable more efficient implementation of infrastructure investments and delivery of\nservices,  (iii)  avoid  the  need  to  divert  scarce  government  staff  from  other  important  tasks,  and\n(iv) support  decentralization.  Furthermore,  as  the  sustainability  of  the  Project  lies  in  the  ability  of\nparticipating LGUs to identify, develop, construct, and monitor rural infrastructure, there will be no\nneed  to  maintain  a  large  project  management  presence  at  the  national  level  following  the\ncompletion  of  the  Project.  Post-project  monitoring  and  coordination  activities  will  be  the\nresponsibility of the PCU, which can continue operating long after project completion.\n\n70. \nThis  component  will  also  support  special  capacity-building  requirements  of  project\nmanagement in the form of aggressive information dissemination campaigns (through RFUs) and\nconsultation workshops. These will primarily be to assist the PCU and project office to (i) obtain the\nactive  participation  of  LGUs,  (ii)  generate  broad-based  consensus  on  the  project\u2019s  plans  and\nbudgetary  requests,  and  (iii)  discuss  and  solve  implementation  constraints.  There  will  be  limited\nsupport  for  policy  studies  to  clarify  and  address  project  risks  that  could  undermine  the  efficient\ndelivery of project outputs.\n\n71.  Within the project office, a geographic information system-based management information\nsystem  (GIS-MIS)  will  be  developed  to  (i)  facilitate  project  implementation,  and  (ii)  provide\ninfrastructural  and  other  data  to  other  government  agencies  such  as  regional  NEDA  and  DA\noffices, Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), and provincial planning offices. The\nGIS-MIS will be established in parallel at the PCU and in the project office and linked through the\nNational Information Network (NIN) which is maintained by DA\u2019s Information Technology Center for\nAgriculture and Fisheries (ITCAF). While the  project office will be responsible for maintaining and\nregularly updating the database, DA and the PCU will have equal access to the information. Post-\nproject  responsibility  for  the  GIS-MIS  will  lie  with  ITCAF  and  the  PCU.  The  GIS-MIS  will  be  also\nlinked to appropriate databases at NIA, Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), and\nDILG.\n\n72.  MDFO\u2019s  capacity  to  support  the  Project  will  have  to  be  enhanced  (MDFO  will  have  to\nfinancially  appraise  approximately  100  subprojects).  The  Project  will  finance  at  least  three  staff\n(selected and engaged by MDFO) and limited equipment in MDFO for this Project.\n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n73. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  over  seven  years  is  estimated  at  $150.0  million  equivalent,\nincluding physical and price contingencies, interest during implementation, fees, taxes, and duties.\nOf the total cost, about $44.4 million or 29.6 percent is in foreign exchange cost and $105.6 million\nequivalent  or  70.4  percent  is  local  currency  costs.  The  costs  for  capacity  building  and  project\nmanagement and coordination will not continue beyond the end of the project period. A summary\nof  the  cost  estimates  is  in  Table  1  and  detailed  cost  estimates  are  in  Appendix  3  and\nSupplementary Appendix C.\n\n\f17\n\nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nItem\nA.

The  loan  will  have  an  amortization  period  of  25\nyears, including a grace period of 7 years, a front-end fee of 1 percent of the loan amount, and an\nannual commitment charge of 0.75 percent. Of the total cost of $150.0 million, the proposed ADB\nloan will finance the foreign exchange cost of $44.3 million and $30.7 million equivalent of the local\ncurrency costs (about 29 percent of the total local currency cost), representing 50.0 percent of the\ntotal  project  cost.  The  Government  will  finance  $37.2  million  equivalent  (24.8  percent),  LGUs  will\nfinance  $28.3  million  equivalent  (18.9  percent),  and  beneficiaries  will  finance  $8.5  million\nequivalent (5.6 percent). The remaining $1 million (0.7 percent) will be funded by the International\nLabour Organization (ILO). The financing plan is summarized in Table 2, with the details provided\nin Appendix 3. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk.\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nAsian Development Bank\n\nGovernment\n\nLocal Government Units\n\nBeneficiaries\n\nInternational Labour Organization\n\n         Total\n\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\n\nPercent\n\n44.3\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n30.7\n\n37.2\n\n28.3\n\n8.5\n\n0.9\n\n75.0\n\n37.2\n\n28.3\n\n8.5\n\n1.0\n\n50.0\n\n24.8\n\n18.9\n\n5.6\n\n0.7\n\n44.4\n\n105.6\n\n150.0\n\n100.0\n\nThe  ADB  loan  will  finance  50  percent  of  the  costs  of  civil  works.  The  ADB  loan  will  also\n75. \nfinance  the  cost  of  vehicles  and  equipment  (less  duties  and  taxes),  the  cost  of  the  consultants\noperating  the  project  office,  50  percent  of  nonsalary  incremental  recurrent  costs  and  the  interest\nduring  implementation, commitment charges, and the front-end fee. The Government will finance\n27 percent  of  the  costs  of  civil  works,  all  salary  costs,  and  50  percent  of  the  other  incremental\nrecurrent costs.  LGUs  will  finance  17 percent of the costs of civil works and 74 percent of O&M.\n\n\f18\n\nBeneficiaries will finance 6.3 percent of civil works and 23 percent of O&M. ILO will finance costs\nrelated to IRAP.\n\n76. \nThe proposed level of ADB financing, including 29 percent of the total local currency cost, is\nreasonable  because  the  foreign  exchange  content  of  the  type  of  civil  works  to  be  constructed\nunder the Project (rural roads, irrigation systems, and water supply) is quite low. Concerted efforts\nhave been made to maintain domestic investment at levels to sustain growth. However, the country\ncontinues  to  face  pressure  on  the  budget,  arising  from  currency  depreciation  and  reduced\nrevenues  resulting  from  slow  growth.  The  Government  has  also  cut  expenditures  to  contain  a\nbudget  deficit.  The  proposed  level  of  ADB  financing  is  also  justified  considering  the  proposed\nProject's  emphasis  on  advancing  decentralization,  building  the  capacity  of  LGUs  and  community\norganizations,  promoting  participation,  and  providing  benefits  to  the  lower  income  classes  of  the\nrural population.\n\n2. \n\nFinancing and Cost Sharing Arrangements\n\na.\n\nFinancial Flows and Mechanisms\n\nLoan  proceeds  and  counterpart  funds  will  be  channeled  through  two  distinct  mechanisms\n77. \n(Appendix 4). Under the improved rural infrastructure component, loan proceeds, and counterpart\nfunds  from  the  Government  will  be  directly  channeled  to  the  participating  LGUs.  Funds  will  be\ncoursed from DBM through MDF mechanisms to LGUs (or any other mechanisms considered most\nappropriate at the time of project implementation [footnote 28]). The Government will ensure that\nadequate counterpart funds required under this component are incorporated in the DA budget. The\nfunds will be debited from DA\u2019s budget ceiling and credited to the MDFO.\n\nFor  the  capacity  building  for  devolved  project  implementation  and  management  and  the\n78. \nproject  management  and  coordination  components,  loan  proceeds  and  counterpart  funds  will  be\nallocated as part of DA\u2019s development budget.\n\nb.\n\nCost-Sharing Arrangements\n\n79. \nUnder  the  rural  infrastructure  component,  the  participating  LGUs  will  be  required  to\nsupplement  Government  grants  according  to  cost-sharing  schemes  agreed  between  the\nGovernment  and  LGUs.  In  most  cases,  LGU  refers  to  a  municipal  or  city  LGU  unless  the\nsubproject  scope  covers  two  or  more  municipalities  or  its  scale  requires  financing  beyond  the\ncapacity  of  a  municipality,  and  thus  requires  the  provincial  LGU  to  be  the  implementing  partner.\nWhere  feasible,  however,  the  LGU  contribution  could  be  shared  between  the  provincial  and\nmunicipal LGUs. LGUs will have an option to finance their contribution from (i) their own resources,\n(ii)  a  loan  from  MDFO,  or  (iii)  a  mix  of  equity  and  loan.  The  cost-sharing  schemes  for  each\nsubcomponent were formulated considering (i) the Government\u2019s policy on cost sharing in the rural\ninfrastructure  sector,  (ii) financial  capability  of  the  LGUs,  (iii) need  to  avoid  discouraging  higher\nincome  LGUs \nthat  will  benefit  poor  communities,  and\n(iv) compatibility with other cost-sharing arrangements under similar projects covering Mindanao.39\nConclusion of an implementation agreement between DA and LGU on cost-sharing responsibilities\nis a precondition of support to any subproject.\n\nfrom  undertaking  subprojects \n\nFor  access  infrastructure,  LGUs  will  contribute  20-30  percent  of  the  total  investment  cost\n80. \n(20 percent for income classes IV to VI, and 30 percent for classes I to III; classes are defined in\nfootnote 10). Under the communal irrigation subcomponent, LGUs will finance 40-50 percent of the\ntotal construction cost (40 percent for income classes IV to VI, and 50 percent for classes I to III).\nLGUs will recover 30 percent of the total investment cost from IAs based on terms agreed between\nthe concerned LGU and IA. For the potable water supply facilities, LGUs will be required to finance\n30-40 percent of the total investment cost (30 percent for income classes IV to VI, and 40 percent\n\n                                                \n39 These projects include Loan 1667-PHI (footnote 25) and Loan 1332-PHI (footnote 22), and the World Bank-financed\n\nMindanao Rural Development Project (footnote 16).\n\n\f19\n\nfor classes I to III). Within the LGU share, 10 percent of the total investment cost will be recovered\nfrom VWSAs.\n\n81. \nIf an LGU lacks the funds to fully finance its share of the equity, it will be eligible to borrow\nfrom the ADB loan proceeds to cover the residual cost after putting up a minimum of 10-30 percent\n(depending on LGU income class) of its total equity share. This onlending operation will be most\nefficiently  effected  through  MDFO  because  the  grant  funding,  which  covers  about  70  percent  of\nproject  cost,  will  also  be  coursed  through  the  MDFO.40  Following  a  process  of  financial  capacity\nevaluation and approval by the MDFO Policy Governing Board (PGB),41 the financing arrangement\nwill be embodied in a subloan agreement between the MDFO and the LGUs concerned (provinces\nand municipalities or cities). The subloan agreement will contain the terms and conditions for the\nsubloan  to  the  LGU  including  the  maturity  period  and  interest  rate,  and  provision  for  internal\nrevenue  allotment  intercept  if  the  LGU  does  not  pay  promptly.42  The  PGB,  which  determines\nonlending  terms  on  an  annual  basis,  will  be  requested  to  make  these  terms  as  competitive  as\npossible.  Since  MDFO  is  still  obtaining  approval  for  and  putting  in  place  its  regular  personnel\ncomplement, interim arrangements will have to be made, including detailing contractual staff under\nthe Project to MDFO (para. 72). Appendix 4 is a flow chart that illustrates the funds flow process.\n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nCost Recovery and Operations and Maintenance\n\nThe  Government\u2019s  grant  support  will  cover  50-80  percent  of  the  cost  of  construction  or\n82. \nrehabilitation  of  the  infrastructure  provided  by  the  Project,  or  an  average  of  70 percent  across  all\ntypes  of  infrastructure  subprojects.  However,  the  LGUs  or  users  concerned  will  assume  full\nresponsibility  for  their  efficient  operation  and  continued  maintenance.  To  the  extent  possible,  the\nprimary responsibility for maintenance will be assigned to the lowest level of LGU (or users group)\nwithin whose jurisdiction the subproject is located. When necessary, higher-level LGUs will provide\ntechnical  and  financial  support  and  equipment.  The  details  of  the  O&M  arrangements  will  be\nspecified  in  the  subproject  implementation  agreements  between  the  LGU  concerned  and  DA.\nUnder  the  implementation  agreement,  if  an  LGU  fails  to  comply  with  this  agreement,  the\nGovernment  will convert  its grant  into an LGU loan from MDFO.43  Furthermore,  LGUs  that  fail  to\nproperly maintain roads and other access infrastructure will be disqualified from similar assistance\nfrom the Government and foreign funding agencies.\n\na. \n\nAccess Infrastructure\n\n83. \nLGUs  will  assume  full  responsibility  for  maintaining  access  infrastructure  facilities  that  will\nbe  constructed  and  upgraded  under  the  Project.  The  implementation  agreement  between  the\nparticipating  LGU  and  the  DA  will  specify  responsibilities  and  procedures  for  routine  O&M.  To\npromote cost-effective approaches to O&M requirements, under the supervision of municipal LGUs\nvillage-based labor-intensive road repair and maintenance schemes will be instituted.44 To promote\n\n                                                \n40 It is anticipated that approximately 10 percent of the loan proceeds will be on lent in this fashion.\n41 The  scope  of  this  financial  evaluation  and  a  delineation  of  responsibilities  will  be  agreed  upon  in  a  memorandum  of\nagreement (MOA) to be completed between DA and DOF. This MOA is a condition of loan effectivity. A draft of the\nMOA was a condition of loan negotiations.\n\n42 Under  the  LGC,  LGUs  may  borrow  from  the  Government  the  proceeds  of  loans  contracted  from  foreign  financial\ninstitutions for various projects and repay these loans from the income of these projects or from their regular income\nthat  includes  their  share  of  national  internal  revenue  taxes.  The  Internal  Revenue  Allotment  (IRA)  intercept  is  a\nmechanism agreed upon by the LGU and the financial institution through which a portion of the LGU\u2019s IRA is withheld\nby DBM upon the request of the lender in case the LGU fails to service its debt promptly.\n\n43 MDFO  can,  if  requested  by  DA,  convert  funds  that  are  channeled  to  LGUs  as  grant  into  loan.  DA  will  monitor  O&M\ncompliance  through  subproject  monitoring  boards  (SPMBs)  that  will  be  established  in  each  participating  LGU  (para.\n121).\n\n44 Such a scheme is presently being pilot tested under Loan 1332-PHI (footnote 22). Rather than employing traditional\nmechanized  road  maintenance  techniques  alone  (i.e.,  graders),  under  the  scheme  village-based  road  maintenance\ncrews  are  mobilized  to  undertake  regular  labor-intensive  road  maintenance  on  sections  of  road  within  the  village.\nThese crews are provided with hand tools and paid by the municipal LGU.\n\n\f20\n\nimproved  O&M,  the  Project  will  assist  LGUs  in  instituting  road-based  revenue-generating\nmeasures, including toll fees, in which the proceeds could be used to partly pay the maintenance\nlabor cost.45 The Project will also assist LGUs in formulating measures for realizing the gains from\ninfrastructure  improvement,  including  improved  real  property  tax  collection,  reevaluation  of  the\nbenefited real properties, and imposition of a special levy.\n\nb. \n\nCommunal Irrigation\n\n84. \nFor CIS facilities, LGUs will assure that IAs assume responsibility for O&M of the systems\nand recover the full cost for O&M from its members through service fees and labor contribution. An\nMOA  between  LGUs  and  IAs  will  specify  detailed  responsibilities  and  procedures  for  O&M  and\ncost-recovery arrangements.\n\n85. \nThe  implementing  rules  and  regulations  for  AFMA  mandates  DA,  through  NIA  and  the\nAgricultural Training Institute, to collaborate with DOF and DILG on a program of capability building\nto enable LGUs and IAs to sustain and maintain CIS facilities. Coordination with the Department of\nEnvironment  and  Natural  Resources  (DENR)  is  also  required  to  address  problems  related  to\ninadequate  watershed  management  and  protection  to  ensure  the  long-term  sustainability  of  the\noperations of CIS. This coordination will in turn allow the IAs to cover the costs of continued O&M\nand  to  repay  their  30  percent  share  of  the  construction  or  rehabilitation  cost  to  the  LGUs\nconcerned. Pursuant to the implementation agreement, failure to adequately maintain and operate\nthe  CIS  facilities  financed  by  the  Project  will  disqualify  the  IAs  and  LGUs  from  future  assistance\nfrom the Government for CIS rehabilitation.\n\nc. \n\nPotable Water Supply\n\nO&M  of  the  potable  water  supply  systems  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  the\n86. \nresponsibility of the municipalities in which they are located. The municipal LGUs will work with the\nVWSA in collecting user charges and conducting O&M works of the systems. The LGU and VWSA\nconcerned will enter into an MOA specifying O&M responsibilities and procedures, as well as fee\ncollection arrangements.\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Agencies\n\n87. \nDA will implement the components for capacity building for devolved project implementation\nand  management,  and  project  management  and  coordination.  LGUs  (municipal,  city,  and\nprovincial) will implement the improved rural infrastructure component. Day-to-day tasks for project\nmanagement  and  technical  assistance  to  the  participating  LGUs  will  be  provided  by  a  project\noffice,  contracted  to  the  private  sector.  As  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project,  DA  will  be\nresponsible for overall coordination and management of the Project through the PMC and the PCU\nlocated in the Office of the Secretary.\n\n3. \n\nOverall Project Organization and Coordination\n\nA  proposed  organization  chart  for  project  implementation  is  given  in  Appendix  5.  Major\n\n88. \nresponsibilities and roles of the participating agencies and organizations are discussed below.\n\na. \n\nLocal Government Units\n\n89. \nSubproject implementation will be led by LGUs. The specific responsibilities of the LGU will\nbe (i) participatory consultation and preparation of subproject proposals, (ii) award of contracts for\nfeasibility  studies  and  detailed  engineering  designs, \n(iii)  contracting  and  supervising\nimplementation  of  subprojects,  (iv)  monitoring  of  physical  progress  and  evaluation  of  results,\n(v) financial management, and (vi) preparation of O&M plans and implementation and supervision\nof O&M.\n\n                                                \n45 Also  in  Loan  1332-PHI  (footnote 22),  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  even  on  rural  roads,  small  toll  fees  can  be\n\ncollected to help offset O&M costs.\n\n\f21\n\n90. \nThe  Project  will  include  mechanisms  for  ensuring  LGU  accountability  to  the  Government\nvis-\u00e0-vis  funds  flow  and  generating  monitorable  results  that  demonstrate  an  impact  on  equitable\nagricultural growth, rural development, and poverty reduction. To enhance project ownership and\nto  account  for  varying  institutional  realities,  two  organizational  options  are  proposed  taking  into\naccount the roles of municipal and provincial governments in the provision of different types of rural\ninfrastructure.    One  option  will  be  an  implementation  structure  led  by  the  municipality  with  the\nprovince  performing  TA  and  monitoring  functions.  The  other  option  will  be  a  province-led\nimplementation  scheme.  This  latter  scheme  will  serve  when  a  municipality  lacks  implementation\ncapacity  and  requests  such  support  or  when  there  are  two  or  more  participating  municipalities\ninvolved in a subproject.46\n\nb. \n\nProject Management Committee\n\nAt the top of the DA management structure will be an interagency PMC that will be chaired\n91. \nby  the  secretary  of  DA.47  The  main  function  of  the  PMC  will  be  to  approve  subproject  feasibility\nstudies  and  to  provide  policy  guidance,  overall  management  direction,  interagency  coordination,\nsupport for financial and budgetary requests, and resource allocation.\n\nc. \n\nProject Coordination Unit\n\n92. \nThe PMC will be directly linked to the office of the secretary of DA, where a small PCU will\nbe  located.  The  PCU  will  act  as  secretariat  to  the  PMC  and  will  be  headed  by  a  national  project\ndirector (at no less than a DA director level) and assisted by a project manager (at no less than a\nDA division chief level) and an appropriate complement of supporting staff. The primary functions\nof the PCU will be to coordinate the activities of the Project and liaise with other NGAs, ADB, and\nother funding agencies. It will also be the Government\u2019s official agency for procurement, financial\nmanagement, and monitoring and evaluation.\n\n93. \nThe  PCU  will  be  mobilized  well  in  advance  of  loan  effectiveness  so  that  it  can  manage  a\nnumber  of  crucial  transitional  activities  between  the  approval  of  the  Project  and  its  full\nimplementation. These will include (i) preparation of operations manuals and plans for ensuring the\nlong-term  sustainability  of  the  subprojects;  (ii)  procurement  of  consultancy  services  and  initial\nequipment and vehicles; (iii) submission of budget requests; and (iv) finalization of eligibility criteria,\nprioritization  of  initial  subprojects,  and  communication  with  all  LGUs  in  the  project  regions  with\nregard to project activities.\n\nd. \n\nRegional Field Units\n\n94. \nThe  DA  RFUs  will  be  engaged  to  support  the  Project  through  information  dissemination,\nadvocacy,  and  \u201cpriming-up\u201d  activities  with  LGUs.  Specifically,  RFUs  within  the  project  area  will\npublicize  and  disseminate  information  to  promote  the  Project.  RFUs  will  also  coordinate  at  a\nnational  level  with  the  provincial  and  municipal  leagues,  provide  logistical  support  (such  as\ntransportation  and  staff  support)  to  the  PCU  and  the  project  office,  and  be  involved  in  the\ndevelopment of the results monitoring and evaluation systems.\n\n95. \nRFUs  will  have  to  endorse  subproject  proposals  emanating  from  LGUs  and  proposed  by\nthe project office for feasibility study. Regional technical committees (RTCs) based in the RFUs will\nbe  responsible  for  endorsing  individual  subprojects  to  the  PCU  following  the  completion  of\nfeasibility studies.48\n\n                                                \n46 Subprojects proposed for adjoining municipalities or radiating from a core subproject will be encouraged.\n47 The PMC will be comprised of relevant officials from DA, representatives from oversight agencies (i.e., NEDA, DOF,\nand DBM), MDFO, and other appropriate NGAs, namely the Department of Agrarian Reform, DENR, DPWH, and NIA,\ntogether with other organizations such as the leagues of provinces and municipalities, and representatives from civil\nsociety and the private sector.\n\n48 The RTCs are comprised regional and provincial representatives from DA, NEDA, BLGF, DBM, and other appropriate\nNGAs, select LGU officials, together with representatives from civil society and the private sector. RTCs are supported\nby Regional Technical Secretariats.\n\n\f22\n\ne. \n\nMunicipal Development Fund Office\n\n96. \nFor those LGUs availing of subloans to finance a portion of their equity, MDFO (supported\nby  BLGF)  will  have  responsibility  for  conducting  financial  evaluations  to  verify  LGU  financial\ncapacity  to  service  subloan  payments.49    MDFO  is  experienced  in  performing  this  task  and  has\ndone so  under a  number  of ADB and the Word Bank projects.50 In accordance with Government\npolicy  on  borrowing  through  MDFO,  LGU  financial  capacity  must  be  evaluated  and  the\ncorresponding subproject approved by the PGB (footnote 41).\n\n97. \nRegardless  of  whether  an  LGU  chooses  to  borrow  from  MDFO,  BLGF  (whose  regional\noffice  will  also  be  represented  on  the  corresponding  RTC)  will  assist  in  validating  the  financial\nposition of all candidate LGUs. The purpose of this validation will be to ensure that (i) the LGU has\nsufficient resources to contribute its equity portion, (ii) funds are available to finance all incremental\nO&M  resulting  from  the  subproject,  and  (iii)  the  LGU  has  sufficient  borrowing  capacity  when  it\nchooses to borrow from MDFO.\n\nf. \n\nProject Office\n\nThe  actual  tasks  of  day-to-day  project  management  and  provision  of  TA  to  participating\n98. \nLGUs will be provided by the project office (located in Manila). The primary responsibilities of the\nproject  office  will  be  (i)  overall  subproject  coordination,  (ii)  assisting  or  facilitating  prequalification\nand  the  preparation  of  quality  subproject  proposals  and  feasibility  studies,  and  (iii)  delivering  the\nrequired inputs to the LGUs in a timely and effective manner. The project office will be staffed by\nproject  management  consultants  and  an  experts\u2019  pool.  The  former  will  be  directly  involved  in\nreviewing and screening subproject proposals emanating from the LGUs. The latter will be hired on\na staggered and as needed basis to provide capacity building and on-the-job training to LGUs and\nDA (para. 64). The consultants will not necessarily be permanently stationed at the project office as\nthey will be moving among participating LGUs.\n\n99. \nThe  project  office  will  be  provided  with  the  vehicles,  equipment,  and  computer  hardware\nand software necessary to enable it to function independently. Given the level of responsibility that\nwill  be  assumed  by  the  project  office,  it  will  be  essential  to  have  in  place  a  stringent  auditing\nsystem. The project office will be led by a team leader who will report directly to the national project\ndirector  in  the  PCU.    The  team  leader  will  also  be  responsible  for  coordinating  activities  with  the\nRFUs.\n\n4. \n\nLGU Eligibility Criteria and Subproject Feasibility Criteria\n\n100.  To  participate  in  the  Project,  LGUs  will  need  to  satisfy  financial,  institutional,  and\norganizational eligibility criteria before subproject proposals can be submitted to the Project. These\ncriteria can be broadly described as (i) financial: the LGU must demonstrate the financial capacity\nto  service  its  counterpart  contribution,  any  subloan  payments,  and  any  incremental  increase  in\nO&M  directly  attributable  to  the  subproject;51  (ii)  institutional:  the  LGU  must  have  the  institutional\nand  technical  capacity  to  implement  the  subproject52  and  the  subproject  must  be  included  in  the\nfashion;53  and\nLGU\u2019s  development  plan,  which  has  been  produced \n(iii) organizational:  appropriate  monitoring  mechanisms  must  be  established  and  validated  by  an\nimplementation agreement between the LGU and DA.54 Lastly, an LGU will only be eligible if the\n                                                \n49 The  LGC  permits  LGUs  to  budget  up  to  20  percent  of  their  annual  revenue  for  debt  servicing.  MDFO  caps  this  at\n\nin  a  participatory \n\n18 percent.\n\n50 Examples  of  projects  for  which  MDFO  conducts  financial  analysis  of  participating  municipal/provincial  LGUs  include\nLoan  1453-PHI  (footnote  20),  Loan  1667-PHI  (footnote  25),  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Mindanao  Rural  Development\nProject (footnote 16).\n\n51 This will be verified by BLGF in their review of candidate LGUs.\n52 A key indicator will be the LGU\u2019s commitment to O&M which can be evaluated through a comparison of actual annual\n\nO&M budgets against that budget amount required were standard DPWH O&M figures used.\n\n53 The institutional capacity of participating LGUs and the appropriateness of proposed subprojects will be evaluated and\n\nconfirmed as part of the IRAP process.\n\n54 Paras. 79 and 120.\n\n\f23\n\ntotal  investment  cost  of  its  proposed  subproject  program  falls  between  $250,000  and  $5 million\nequivalent.55\n\n101. \nIn addition to eligibility criteria, the LGUs must demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed\nsubproject  through  standard  measures  of  financial,  economic,  and  technical  viability  before  a\nsubproject  proposal  can  be  approved  by  the  PMC.  Furthermore,  the  LGU  must  show  that  the\nbenefits of the proposed subproject will be spread equitably and have a pro-poor impact (detailed\nLGU eligibility criteria and subproject feasibility criteria are presented in Appendix 6).\n\n5. \n\nSubproject Evolution Process\n\n102.  The  starting  point  in  the  process  will  be  RFUs  ensuring  that  all  eligible  municipalities  and\nprovinces are apprised of the Project, including details of the types of infrastructure that could be\nfinanced  and  descriptions  of  the  eligibility  criteria  and  feasibility  study  guidelines.  Prior  to\nsubmitting proposals, LGUs will also participate in the IRAP (or, under some circumstances, other\nsimilar planning exercises).\n\n103.  The  LGU  will  consolidate  individual  components  (e.g.,  different  road  segments,  CIS/CIPs,\nwater  supply  systems,  etc.)  into  subprojects.  The  proponent  LGU  will  then  forward  subproject\nproposals  to  the  project  office.  The  project  office  will  have  the  delegated  authority  to  decide\nwhether  the  LGU  and  proposal  meet  the  eligibility  criteria  in  order  to  justify  progressing  to  full\nfeasibility  study,  although  the  project  office  will  also  have  to  secure  endorsement  from  the\nappropriate RFU.\n\n104. \nIf  the  initial  subproject  proposal  is  approved,  feasibility  studies  will  be  conducted  by  the\nLGU. If an LGU has in-house capacity to conduct a feasibility study, the LGU may undertake it on\nits  own;  otherwise  the  study  will  be  contracted  out  to  the  private  sector  or  NIA.56  The  LGU  will\nsubmit  the  completed  feasibility  study  to  the  project  office,  which  will  evaluate  it  and  prepare\nrecommendations to the RTC. The RTC will review the study and recommend approval or denial. If\nthe subproject is approved by the project office and RTC, the RTC will endorse the feasibility study\nto the PMC. Subprojects with subloans will be first reviewed and approved by the PMC and then\nendorsed  to  the  MDFO  for  approval.  Concurrent  with  the  LGU  feasibility  study  and  project  office\nand RTC review processes will be a financial evaluation of the LGU conducted by MDFO and/or\nBLGF.  In accordance with Government policy on borrowing through MDFO, the financial capacity\nof  borrowing  LGUs  requires  clearance  by  the  MDFO  PGB.57  If  the  LGU  does  not  opt  to  borrow,\nBLGF will simply validate the LGUs financial position to ensure capacity to contribute counterpart\nand undertake O&M (para. 97).\n\n105. \nIf the subproject is rejected by the PMC or MDFO, the LGU will be advised of the reasons\nfor the rejection and may decide to revise and resubmit the proposal. If the subproject is accepted,\nthe  PCU  will  establish  the  funding  channels  and  schedules  in  accordance  with  the  cost-sharing\nsystem  as  defined  for  that  subproject  and  issue  an  instruction  to  proceed.  The  PCU  and  project\noffice  will  facilitate  the  completion  of  an  implementation  agreement  between  the  LGU  and  DA  as\nwell  as  a  subloan  agreement  between  the  LGU  and  MDFO.  In  consultation  with  the  LGU  and\nbeneficiary communities, the project office will determine the requirements for capacity building for\nimplementing the subproject and will accomplish the measures necessary.\n106.  The civil works will be constructed by contractors and supervised by the LGU.58 The LGU,\nin association with civil society and the communities themselves, will be responsible for monitoring\n\n                                                \n55 The cost of a subproject program includes the total cost of civil works (access infrastructure, CIS/CIP, and/or potable\n\nwater supply) and costs associated with pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, engineering design, contracts, etc.\n\n56 The  LGU  may  borrow  funds  (supplied  by  loan  proceeds)  from  MDFO  to  conduct  the  feasibility  study.  Any  amounts\n\nspent on the feasibility study will be considered as LGU counterpart for the subproject as a whole.\n57 Approval of technical aspects, however, rests only with the RTC (supported by the project office).\n58 To  the  degree  possible  and  within  the  confines  of  ADB  procurement  guidelines,  construction,  repair,  rehabilitation,\nimprovement,  and  maintenance  of  civil  works  will  follow  the  Commission  on  Audit  (COA)  rules  on  simplified  public\nbidding.\n\n\f24\n\nthe  construction,  preparing  routine  reports,  and  ensuring  that  all  relevant  reports  and  data  are\nprovided to the project office (para. 120).\n\n107.  A  condition  of  acceptance  of  a  proposal  for  financing  will  be  concrete  measures  taken  by\nthe proponent LGU ensuring that routine and corrective maintenance will be undertaken at the time\nrequired. Benefiting communities (particularly with CIS/CIP and water supply) will also be required\nto take responsibility for ensuring that the infrastructure will be properly operated and maintained,\nwith the technical and financial support of the LGU.\n\n6. \n\nProcurement\n\n108.  Most  of  the  subprojects  will  be  relatively  small  and  simple,  and  spread  over  a  wide\ngeographical  area,  involving  small  contracts  and  unlikely  to  be  attractive  to  international\ncontractors.  All  civil  works  will  be  contracted  out  to  private  construction  companies  (under  some\ncircumstances, however, works may have to be undertaken by NIA).59 Contracts shall be awarded\nthrough  competitive  bidding  among  local  contractors  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s\nstandard procedures acceptable to ADB.60 In the interest of expediting project implementation as\nwell as reducing the potential for manipulation at the prequalification stage, postqualification will be\nused. The use of prequalification will be permitted only for complex civil works or contracts whose\nvalue  exceeds  $1  million.  Equipment  to  be  procured  involves  mainly  vehicles  and  office  and\ncomputer equipment. Equipment and materials will be procured through international shopping and\nlocal  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2018s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Indicative\nprocurement packages are in Appendix 7.\n\n7. \n\nLand Acquisition\n\n109.  Assessments of 10 core subprojects indicate that only limited land acquisition, resettlement,\nand  displacement  of  people  will  be  required,  as  the  project  roads  generally  follow  the  existing\nalignment  and  rights-of-way.  Some  relocation  of  people  and  structures  may  be  necessary  to\naccommodate the rehabilitation of roads, but this will typically only affect a narrow strip fronting the\nexisting  road  embankment.  With  regard  to  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  small  irrigation\nschemes,  land  acquisition  should  be  required  in  case  of  new  construction  only.  Minor  land\nacquisition  may  be  necessary  for  new  road  alignment,  road  widening,  irrigation  canals  and\nappurtenant  structures,  sites  for  installation  of  artesian  wells,  and  standpipes  for  spring  source\ndevelopment.  The  LGU  concerned  will  be  responsible  for  right-of-way  negotiations  and  any\nresettlement and compensation will be in accordance with the resettlement plan developed during\nproject  preparation  and  agreed  to  by  the  Government.  A  summary  resettlement  plan  is  in\nAppendix 8.\n\n8. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n110.  Consulting  services  are  required  to  provide  TA  in  the  following  areas:  project  office\nmanagement; verification of feasibility studies (using procedures and practices acceptable to ADB\nwith  regards  to  social,  environmental,  technical,  institutional,  and  economic/financial  viability);\nfinancial  and  administrative  systems;  project  economics;  information  systems;  benefit  monitoring\nand evaluation; poverty impact assessment; environmental assessment; and training.\n\n111.  The  Project  will  provide  approximately  243  person-months  of  specialized  services  from\nshort-term  domestic  consultants  and  about  42  person-years  of  long-term  international  and\ndomestic  (in  collaboration  with  the  international)  consultants  through  a  firm  (outline  terms  of\n                                                \n59 Particularly where new irrigation systems are being designed and constructed, local construction contractors may not\nhave the capacity or expertise to undertake the works. In such cases, NIA may be contracted, although DA must first\nconsult with ADB and the project office or RFU must verify that there are no local contractors capable of undertaking\nthe works.\n\n60 LGUs  may  use  force  accounts  to  undertake  portions  of  a  subproject  (amounting  to  no  more  than  $100,000)  if  the\nscope of such works is too small to be of interest to local contractors or if appropriate from the perspective of efficiency\nand  cost-effectiveness.  The  project  office  or  RFU  must  provide  written  confirmation  to  ADB  that  the  use  of  force\naccount is appropriate before the LGU may begin construction.\n\n\f25\n\nreference  are  in  Appendix  9).  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with\nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the\nselection and engagement of consultants.\n\n9. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n112.  The Project is expected to be implemented over a seven-year period. The implementation\nschedule is presented in Appendix 10.\n\n10. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements, Accounts, Audits, and Reports\n\n113.  Two  imprest  accounts  will  be  established  to  facilitate  the  timely  release  of  funds  and\nexpedite implementation of the Project. One will be held by MDFO for disbursements related to the\nLGUs\u2019 infrastructure subprojects; the second will be managed by DA for all other eligible expenses.\nMost of the proceeds of the loan will be disbursed through these two imprest accounts, but direct\npayment, reimbursement procedures, and commitment procedures could also be used. A separate\nbank account for each imprest account will be opened promptly after loan effectiveness. The initial\namount to be deposited in each imprest account is not expected to exceed $1 million and will be\nbased  on  an  estimate  of  expenditures  to  be  incurred  during  the  first  six  months  of  project\nimplementation (the ceiling is calculated as an average of the estimated six-month expenditures).\nThe imprest accounts will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated by MDFO and DA\nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements agreed upon\nby  MDFO,  DA,  and  ADB.  The  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be  used  for  reimbursing\neligible expenditures and to liquidate advances provided to the imprest account in accordance with\nprocedures  satisfactory  to  ADB  and  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.\nIndividual  payments  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  not\nexceed $50,000 equivalent for each item of expenditure.\n\nis  currently  reviewing \n\nits  operating  and  disbursement  procedures \n\n114.  DOF-MDFO \nin\ncoordination with the COA and DBM. At the start of the Project, all concerned stakeholders will be\nmade  familiar  with  the  agreed  procedures  for  disbursement  and  replenishment  of  imprest\naccounts.  As  more  LGUs  participate  in  the  Project,  they  will  be  trained  and  monitored  closely  as\npart of the Project\u2019s capacity-building activities. The training will consist of workshops or seminars\nin  the  early  stages  of  an  LGU\u2019s  involvement  with  the  Project  and  on-the-job  training  with  LGU\nexecutives. The training will continue until LGU staff are able to comply fully with all disbursement\nrequirements.\n\n115.  Both  DA  and  MDFO  will  maintain  separate  accounts  and  financial  statements  for  the\nProject, which will be audited annually by COA, and its opinion will be included separately in the\naudit reports. The audit may be carried out as part of the regular annual audit of DA and MDFO\u2019s\ngeneral accounts. In addition to the standard audit opinion, COA\u2019s audit report should also include\nseparate  audit  opinions  on  DA  and  MDFO  imprest  accounts  and  statements  of  expenditures.\nCertified  copies  of  the  audited  financial  statements  will  be  provided  to  ADB  within  nine  months61\nafter the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. To enhance transparency and because of the\nhigh  level  of  responsibility  delegated  to  the  project  office,  the  project  office  must  be  routinely\naudited by independent auditors.\n\n116.  DA  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation,  to  be\nsubmitted within one month after the end of the quarter to which they relate, and such other reports\nand information relating to the Project as ADB might reasonably request. In addition, within three\nmonths of completion of the Project, DA will submit to ADB a project completion report detailing,\namong other things, information on the implementation of the Project, the use of the proceeds of\nthe loans, and the extent to which the objectives of the Project have been accomplished.\n\n                                                \n61 Although normally required within six months, due to the participation of a large number of LGUs spread across a wide\narea, this period is considered too short. A precedent for nine months being acceptable can be found in Loan 1667-\nPHI (footnote 25).\n\n\f26\n\n117.  Due to the wide geographical dispersal of the LGUs expected to participate in the Project,\nDA and MDFO will explore ways of facilitating internal audits as well as periodic audits by COA as\nrequested by ADB.\n\n11. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action\n\n118.  The  Government  requests  advance  procurement  action  to  expedite  implementation  of\nsubprojects for which feasibility studies have been completed. Advance procurement is requested\nfor the selection of consultants and procurement of equipment and vehicles. The ADB has agreed\nto such request and the Government has been advised that such approval does not commit ADB\nto  finance  the  Project.  All  advance  selection  and  procurement  will  be  carried  out  strictly  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and Guidelines for Procurement.\n\n12. \n\nProject Reviews\n\n119.  Semiannual reviews will be conducted in the initial years until ADB judges that an annual\nreview  will  be  sufficient  for  efficient  administration.  In  addition  to  these  regular  reviews,  a\ncomprehensive  review  will  be  undertaken  jointly  by  DA  and  ADB  after  18  months  and  at  the\nmidterm  of  the  Project  during  the  third  year.  Among  other  things,  these  reviews  will  assess  the\ngeneral performance of the Project and the need for any changes in its design and implementation\narrangements.\n\n13.  Monitoring, Evaluation, and Impact Assessment\n\n120.  The  three  main  aspects  to  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  Project  are\n(i) construction  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure,  (ii)  capacity  building,  and  (iii)  benefits  within\nsubproject areas and socioeconomic impact.\n\na. \n\nConstruction and Maintenance of Infrastructure\n\n121.  The Project will make use of existing systems and channels in DA (and if appropriate other\nagencies)  for  monitoring  infrastructure  construction  (prefeasibility,  feasibility,  engineering  design,\nconstruction, O&M, and monitoring of performance, including the condition of project infrastructure\nand  selected  nonproject  infrastructure).62  LGU  staff  will  be  responsible  for  primary  surveys  and\ndata collection, which will be fed to DA\u2019s RFUs and transmitted to the project office via NIN. The\nLGU, as the implementing agencies, will be responsible for monitoring and evaluation, with training\nand further evaluation provided by the project office. LGUs will be trained to undertake the global\npositioning system and other surveys required (traffic counts/road usage, CIPs/CISs, water supply,\nstate  of  physical  maintenance).  To  ensure  transparency  and  accountability,  multisectoral\nsubproject  monitoring  boards  (SPMBs)  will  be  established  for  each  subproject.  These  will  be\ncomposed of representatives from the LGU, local NGOs and peoples\u2019 organizations, contractors,\nbeneficiaries, and other stakeholders. The SPMB will be responsible for monitoring project bidding,\nconstruction quality and progress, etc. The SPMB will have access to all bidding documents and\nsubproject financial records. The chairperson of the SPMB will be a nonvoting member of the local\nproject bid and award committee and all SPMB meetings will be public.63\n\nb. \n\nCapacity Building\n\n122. \nIncreased capacity for LGUs to undertake future infrastructure activities will be one of the\nbenefits  of  the  Project.  The  effectiveness  of  this  component  should  be  measured  by  the  number\nand quality of proposals presented for project funding and the ability of the LGU to use the funds\neffectively. Proposal quality should be monitored according to the number returned as inadequate\n\n                                                \n62 The  existing  systems  in  DA  include  the  Project  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Service,  Project  Development  Service,\n\nRFUs, and Office of the Undersecretary for Regional Operations.\n\n63 The SPMB concept is based on the infrastructure monitoring and advisory group concept that was used successfully in\nMindanao to increase accountability, speed project implementation, and reduce funds diversion on large Government\nprojects.\n\n\f27\n\nas  well  as  the  numbers  accepted  and  rejected.  The  use  of  funds  will  be  monitored  through  the\nproject accounting system.\n\nc. \n\nProject Benefits\n\n123.  The  goal  and  purposes  of  the  Project  relate  to  the  increase  in  rural  productivity  and  the\nreduction of poverty in the beneficiary areas. The Project will use LGU staff and, as far as possible,\nexisting  mechanisms  to  establish  baselines  and  subsequently  measure  the  performance  of\nsubproject  components.  Rather  than  simply  monitoring  the  physical  progress  of  civil  works\nconstruction and completion, evaluation of subprojects will be based on the subproject\u2019s impact on\nagricultural  growth  and  on  poverty  reduction.  This  evaluation  is  best  performed  through  an\nindependent  evaluation  mechanism  in  cooperation  with  the  private  sector  (and,  as  appropriate,\nNGOs). This will be effected through an initial program of training of trainers that will be contracted\nto  a  professional  entity.  The  private  sector  (or  NGOs)  will  later  be  contracted  to  monitor  and\nevaluate subprojects and assess subproject impact.\n\n14. \n\nGeographic Information System and Management Information System\n\n124.  The GIS-MIS to be developed to support project implementation will be coordinated by the\nproject  office,  which  will  work  closely  with  the  ITCAF.  ITCAF  will  ensure  that  the  project  office,\nPlanning  Service,  PCU,  Office  of  the  Secretary,  VWSA,  and  relevant  RFUs  are  connected  and\nsupported through NIN. The strengthening of NIN will be an important requirement to ensure that\nthe  GIS-MIS  delivers  its  support  for  subproject  identification,  feasibility  study  appraisal,  and\nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  ITCAF  will  procure  any  equipment  and  software  (systems  and\napplications)  required  for  all  agencies  and  coordinate  and/or  supply  any  capability  building  or\ntraining  needed  in  information  technology.  They  will  ensure  that  any  information  technology\nsystems developed by the Project\u2019s activities is integrated with NIN.\n\nF. \n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n125.  The Executing Agency is DA. DA\u2019s capacity to implement projects is demonstrated by the\nsatisfactory status of all ongoing ADB projects in its portfolio. DA is currently responsible for seven\nADB-funded  projects  and  two  TAs,  one  World  Bank-funded  project,  and  several  smaller  bilateral\nactivities.64  Within DA, the PCU will be the lead coordinating office for the Project and senior staff\nin DA are familiar with the overall responsibilities of project coordination.\n\nG. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Impact\n\n126.  The  eligible  rural  infrastructure  subprojects  fall  entirely  under  Category  B  of  ADB\u2019s\nclassification system (the summary initial environmental examination is in Supplementary Appendix\nD).  The  environmental  impacts  are  understood  and  the  appropriate  environmental  management\nmeasures  are  well  known  and  need  only  be  validated  for  specific  project  components  and  sites.\nFor  this  proposed  sector  project,  sample  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  have  been\nprepared for 2 representative core subprojects (rural roads in Aloran, Misamis Oriental and a CIS\nin Cantugas, Mainit, Surigao del Norte) and demonstrate that subprojects will not have significant\nadverse environmental impacts.\n\n                                                \n64 The  ADB-financed  projects  are  (i)  Loan  1136(SF)-PHI  (footnote  21);  (ii)  Loan  1332-PHI  (footnote  22);  (iii)\nLoan1365/1366(SF)-PHI: Second Irrigation Systems Improvement Project, for $27.82 million, approved on 30 August\n1995;  (iv)  Loan  1421/1422(SF)-PHI  (footnote  23);  (v)  Loans  1562/1563(SF)-PHI:  Fisheries Resource Management\nProject, for $34.78 million, approved on 16 October 1997; (vi) Loan 1668-PHI: Southern Philippines Irrigation Sector\nProject, for $60.0 million, approved on 18 December 1998; and (vii) Loans 1739/1740-PHI (footnote 5). The ADB TAs\nare (i) TA 3235-PHI: Review of Cost Recovery Mechanisms for National Irrigations Systems, for $300,000, approved\non 18 December 1998; and (ii) TA 3429-PHI: Grains Policy and Institutional Reforms, for $630,000, approved on 24\nApril 2000. The World Bank-funded project is the Mindanao Rural Development Project (footnote 16).\n\n\f28\n\n127. \nInstitutional  arrangements  for  ensuring  that  environmental  requirements  are  met  by\nsubprojects proposals are described in detail in the sample IEEs. Subproject proponents will use\navailable  IEE  checklists  prepared  by  ADB  and  others  to  prepare  their  respective  IEEs.  Some\nprojects  (e.g.,  new  rural  roads  on  very  steep  slopes  and  exceeding  5  km  in  length)  might  be\nclassified  as  environmentally  critical  under  Philippine  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)\nregulations  and  will  require  a  more  comprehensive  review  (an  environmental  impact  statement\n[EIS], which is equivalent to ADB\u2019s EIA document). On the other hand, smaller projects such as the\nrehabilitation of  a canal of  a CIS  are not covered under the Philippine EIS System. The IEE and\nEIS format stipulated under Philippine EIA rules may be used (DENR Administrative Order 96-37\nand the latest Procedural Manual of October 1999).\n\n128.  Capability  building  for  environmental  management  of  rural  infrastructure  projects  will  be\nconducted  for  involved  LGUs.  These  interventions  will  include  formal  and  on-the-job  training  on\nconcepts,  practices,  and  tools  of  EIA,  the  EIA  procedures  of  the  Government  and  ADB,\nenvironmental  management  and  multipartite  monitoring  of  rural  infrastructure  projects,  and\nenvironmental administration and reporting.\n\n129.  The environmental impacts identified for rural roads on flat to rolling land are construction-\nrelated and minimal. On steep to very steep slopes and loose geological substrates, erosion risks,\nincluding possible loss of the rural infrastructure itself, exist. However, the core subprojects\u2019 rural\nroads components are mostly on flat to rolling land. In steep sections, both realignment away from\nvery steep slopes and slope protection works are recommended.\n\n130.  The environmental impacts of CIS rehabilitation projects will be minimal. For CIP and weir\nupgrading  or  construction,  construction-related  impacts  are  possible  and  must  be  addressed  by\ncontractors through the best-known engineering and construction practices. In areas with endemic\nschistosomiasis and malaria, CIS design must incorporate features for control and management of\nsuch communicable water-related diseases.\n\n131.  For water supply projects, the environmental impacts will be minimal but the contractors will\nbe  required  to  adopt  the  best-known  engineering  practices  and  will  be  monitored  for  compliance\nwith those practices. Contractors will be required to properly restore exposed surfaces. Moreover,\nthe  water  users  should  be  trained  in  proper  maintenance  and  sanitary  practices.  Water  sources,\ntransmission lines, and faucets should be rigorously monitored for contaminants.\n\n132.  Project-specific  IEEs  including  environmental  management  plans  will  be  prepared  by  the\nLGU proponent of each subproject. The LGUs, in collaboration with DA and DENR, will implement\nenvironmental  management  measures.  A  streamlined  procedure  will  be  negotiated  between  DA\nand DENR to ensure that the environmental requirements of ADB and the Government will be met\nin a timely and satisfactory manner by LGU proponents of subprojects. Environmental monitoring\nwill be built into existing schemes for foreign-assisted projects with local participation such as that\nof  NEDA.  LGU  and  community  stakeholders  will  be  prepared  so  that  they  can  take  part  in  a\nmultipartite monitoring team. The cost of preparing the IEE or EIS will be met by the LGU.\n\n2. \n\nSocial Analysis\n\n133.  The  provinces,  cities,  and  municipalities  included  in  the  Project  are  among  the  poorest  in\nthe nation by almost all measures of poverty and welfare. The project design ensures that the poor\nand  low-income  groups  at  least  equally  share  in  the  distribution  of  the  income  growth  benefit\n(Appendix 11).\n\n134. \n There are groups of indigenous peoples in the project area. Most of their communities are\nin  upland  areas  with  steep  slopes  that  are  specifically  excluded  from  subproject  components  for\nreasons  of  environmental  vulnerability.  However,  should  a  subproject  be  developed  in  such  an\narea,  the  Project  will  specifically  address  their  needs  through  an  indigenous  peoples  plan,\ndeveloped in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples.\n\n135.  The  resettlement  effects  are  not  anticipated  to  be  significant  in  the  Project;  however,\nreflecting the importance that ADB places on careful and effective implementation, a resettlement\n\n\f29\n\nand  compensation  plan  has  been  prepared  and  accepted  by  Government  (Supplementary\nAppendix  E).  The  resettlement  and  compensation  plan  dictates,  among  other  things,  that  people\nwhose land will be acquired or who will be resettled do not face a material reduction in incomes,\ndeterioration in living standards, or unnecessary social and cultural dislocations. The resettlement\nand  compensation  plan  also  identifies  agencies  responsible  for  implementing  and  monitoring  the\nProjects\u2019  resettlement  plan  in  a  manner  consistent  with  Government  procedures  and  ADB\u2019s\nrequirements. In the project office, special expertise will also be available to look into resettlement,\nindigenous peoples, and other socioeconomic issues and concerns.\n\n136.  A gender analysis of the Project indicates that there will be no inequity on the basis of sex;\nalthough the lives of women and men will be affected in different ways, the benefits will reach all\n(e.g., there will be differential impacts on gender under the water supply subcomponent and, to a\ncertain extent, under the access infrastructure subcomponent).\n\n V. \n\nJAPAN FUND FOR POVERTY REDUCTION GRANT\n\n137.  A grant project, Sustainable Livelihood for the Poor in Southern Philippines (SLPSP), aimed\nat the poor in the project area is being developed in conjunction with the Project. The SLPSP will\nenhance income-generating opportunities among the poor in targeted areas so that they can better\nbenefit from the improved infrastructure facilities financed under the Project. This will be achieved\nby supporting sustainable livelihood activities for the poor in 30-80 project municipalities.65 The 10\ncore subproject sites will comprise the first batch of livelihood assistance activities.\n\n138.  DA,  through  the  project  office,  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  SLPSP,  which  will  be\nimplemented  over  a  three-year  period.  The  total  cost  of  the  SLPSP  is  estimated  at  $3.05  million\nequivalent,  comprising  $275,000  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $2.78  million  equivalent  in  local\ncurrency  costs.  ADB  will  administer  $2.8  million  equivalent,  consisting  of  $150,000  in  foreign\nexchange costs and $2.65 million equivalent in local currency costs. The SLPSP will be financed\non a grant basis from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR), funded by the Government of\nJapan. The Government, through the Project, will finance $125,000 in foreign exchange costs and\nimplementation\n$125,000  equivalent \narrangements, and cost estimates for the SLPSP are described in more detail in a separate JFPR\npaper.67\n\nlocal  currency  costs.66  The  objectives,  scope, \n\nin \n\n VI. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n1. \n\nFeasibility Studies of Core Subprojects\n\n139.  The Project is expected to increase crop production through the provision of irrigation which\nwill increase rice yields and cropping intensities. In addition, the costs of transport are expected to\ndecrease  and,  as  a  result,  farm  incomes  to  increase  in  the  areas  of  influence  of  the  roads\nupgraded  and/or  constructed.  With  improved  access  and  lower  transport  costs,  subsequent\nincreases  in  marketed  production  through  the  introduction  of  higher  value  crops  and  use  of\nadditional  purchased  inputs  are  anticipated.  Further  benefits  will  accrue  from  other  types  of\ninfrastructure  investment,  e.g.,  village  water  supply  schemes  that  might  be  proposed  as  part  of\nfuture project investments (Appendix 12).\n\n                                                \n65 The  objectives,  scope,  and  activities  for  SLPSP  were  developed  during  two  participatory  workshops  with  NGOs,\npeoples\u2019  organizations,  and  representatives  of  potential  beneficiaries  financed  using  $9,500  from  RETA  5894:\nFacilitating Capacity Building and Participatory Activities II, for $400,000, approved on 28 December 1999.\n\n66 DA  has  agreed  to  reserve  54  person-months  of  consulting  services  (financed  by  the  Project)  for  undertaking\n\ncoordination and poverty impact monitoring activities under SLPSP.\n\n67  JFPR  PHI:  Sustainable Livelihood for the Poor in Southern Philippines  (JPR:PHI  30552),  for  $2.8  million,  was\napproved  by  the  Government  of  Japan  for  financing  under  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  on  22  September\n2000 and is scheduled for Board consideration on 31 October 2000.\n\n\f30\n\n140.  Table  3  summarizes  the  returns  from  the  10  core  subprojects  for  which  feasibility  studies\nwere  undertaken  during  project  formulation.  In  all  cases,  the  municipalities  and  cities  have\nproposed investments in rural roads, irrigation, or both. Investment costs range from the equivalent\nof  $0.37  million  to  $2.29  million,  and  the  economic  returns  from  14  to  59  percent.  The  very  high\nreturns for the Surigao City subproject reflect low costs per hectare for the two irrigation schemes\nthat  comprise  the  subproject.  In  both  schemes,  and  elsewhere  (e.g.,  Aloran,  Bayugan,  and  San\nJose) there are high levels of sunk costs following the original development of the schemes. The\nreturns from road investments reflect the costs per kilometer for road construction, the size of the\narea  of  influence  and  its  population,  and  existing  and  future  modes  of  transport.  Road  costs  per\nkilometer  depend  to  a  large  extent  on  the  distance  aggregate  has  to  be  transported  and  the\nnumber of structures required.\n\nTable 3: Core Subproject Summary\n\nSite\nAloran\nBayugan\nCalbayog\nDolores\nHinunangan\nJiabong\nKapalong\nMainit\nSan Jose City\nSurigao City\n\nInvestment Costs\n($ million)\n1.10\n0.94\n1.06\n2.29\n0.37\n0.86\n1.21\n0.45\n2.10\n0.42\n\nLength of Roads\n(kilometer)\n13.0\n12.0\n14.0\n28.0\n12.2\n14.0\n20.0\n5.6\n7.3\n0.0\n\nArea of Irrigation\n(hectare)\n558\n400\n0\n0\n0\n0\n290\n100\n1,500\n596\n\nEIRR\n (percent)\n32\n33\n15\n21\n14\n15\n20\n20\n31\n59\n\n   EIRR = economic internal rate of return.\n\n2. \n\nApproach\n\n141.  For  irrigation  development,  the  financial  analysis  shows  the  expected  impact  of  Project\ninvestments  on  the  income  of  households  with  average  sized  landholdings.  The  analysis  also\nshows the impact of the Project on the cash flow of IAs responsible for operating and maintaining\nthe  irrigation  schemes  and  repaying  the  loan,  equivalent  to  30  percent  of  the  investment.  For\ninvestments in rural roads the expected impact on production at the farm level has been assessed\nconsidering savings in transport costs and the expected stimulus to crop production following the\nprovision of improved access.\n\n142.  The  analysis  assumes  that  the  costs  and  benefits  of  the  10  core  subprojects  for  which\nfeasibility  studies  have  been  undertaken  will  be  representative  of  all  those  to  be  financed  from\nproject resources. The economic analysis has been carried out in the national currency with traded\ngoods  and  services  valued  at  either  their  free  on  board  (fob)  or  cost,  insurance,  and  freight  (cif)\nvalues, as appropriate. The analysis uses a standard conversion factor (SCF)68 of 0.91 to re-value\nthe financial prices of all non-traded goods and services and a conversion factor for labor of 0.68.\nRecent  data  indicate  that  the  opportunity  cost  of  capital  (OCC)  is  around  12  percent  and  the\nanalysis  uses  this  value,  although  the  analysis  for  the  subprojects  feasibility  studies  uses  15\npercent.69\n\n3. \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n143.  For  rural  roads,  savings  in  transport  costs  will  be  highest  where  motorized  transport\nreplaces  human  and/or  animal  transport.  Anticipated  increases  in  crop  production  are  based  on\nexperience elsewhere in the project area. Savings in costs and increased production together will\n\n                                                \n68 An alternative analysis using the shadow exchange rate factor was also undertaken. The results of this analysis are\n\nconsistent with the analysis described herein.\n\n69 This  figure  is  used  to  allow  for  the  inclusion  of  the  costs  of  capacity  building,  and  project  coordination  and\n\nmanagement, which cannot easily be allocated to individual subprojects.\n\n\f31\n\nincrease average annual household incomes from crop production on average by P3,761 ($84) to\nP21,312 ($474), representing gains of 16-46 percent.\n\n144. \nIncomes  from  crop  production  for  farmers  with  irrigated  holdings  will  be  expected  to\nincrease substantially (82-215 percent), reflecting higher yields per hectare and double cropping on\nthe land following investment in irrigation facilities. The expected project returns to labor are P229-\n338  ($5.1-7.5)  per  day,  while  incremental  returns  to  incremental  labor  are  more  than  three  times\ncurrent daily wage rates of around P110 ($2.44). The income of IAs from irrigation fees equivalent\nto  50-570  kg  per  annum  of  unhulled  rice  at  present  prices  should  enable  them  to  operate  and\nmaintain  the  schemes  and  repay  their  loans  (30  percent  of  the  investment  costs  for  most\nschemes).  The  financial  analyses  show  that  there  should  be  adequate  incentives  for  farmers  to\nincrease production following project investments in roads and irrigation.\n\n4. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n145.  The economic internal rates of return (EIRR) for individual road investments range from 14\nto  30  percent  with  an  overall  value  of  19  percent. The  analyses  show  that  where  the  EIRR  is  at\nleast  20  percent,  the  returns  are  not  unduly  sensitive  to  changes  in  the  key  variables.  Of  the\nvariables analyzed, the results are most sensitive to the assumption concerning the average length\nof  journey.  Returns  are  less  sensitive  to  the  level  of  investment  costs  and  savings  in  transport\ncosts. Transport cost savings vary widely and depend upon the extent to which higher-cost modes\nof  transport  (i.e.,  animal  and  human  transport)  are  replaced  by  lower-cost  motorized  transport.\nFinally,  returns  are  insensitive  to  the  costs  of  maintenance  or  to  the  assumptions  concerning  the\nlevel  of  agricultural  output  as  nonagricultural  freight  and  passenger  traffic  provide  important\ncontributions to the savings in transport costs.\n\n146.  The  investment  in  irrigation  based  on  the  subproject  models  gives  an  overall  EIRR  of\n34 percent. Project investments that will rehabilitate and/or extend existing schemes show higher\neconomic returns (up to 65 percent), as there are high levels of sunk costs, while the returns from\nnew construction are lower at 16 to 22 percent. Returns are mostly insensitive to changes in key\nvariables.  However,  if  the  future  rice  price  were  the  equivalent  of  the  bottom  value  of  the\n70 percent  probability  range  indicated  by  the  World  Bank,  estimates  of  the  viability  of  irrigation\ndevelopment would be seriously undermined, with only four schemes remaining marginally viable.\nScheme  implementation  should  consider  crop  diversification  as  one  way  of  reducing  the  risks\nassociated with possible reductions in future rice prices.\n\n147.  Assuming  that  the  results  of  the  core  subprojects  represent  the  potential  returns  from  all\nproject investments and after including all the costs associated with capacity building and project\nmanagement  and  coordination,  the  overall  EIRR  will  be  18  percent  with  net  present  values,\ndiscounted at 12 and 15 percent, respectively,70 of P=1,069 million and P=400 million.\n\n148.  Additional  analyses  have  also  been  prepared,  the  first  using  0.83  as  the  SCF  which\nincreases  the  EIRR  to  19  percent,71  while  the  second  assumes  a  30  percent  depreciation  in  the\nvalue of the peso, which will increase the return to 22 percent. A devaluation of the peso will raise\nthe Project\u2019s return as it will increase the import parity price of rice, a major incremental output.\n\n5. \n\nUnquantified Benefits\n\n149.  While  the  financial  and  economic  analyses  are  based  on  costs  and  benefits  that  can  be\nidentified and quantified, significant unquantified benefits are also likely to flow from investments in\nroads  and  water  supply.  These  will  follow  when  communities  have  better  access  to  clean  water,\neducation, health facilities, and other services.\n\n                                                \n70 The rate used by NEDA, although under review.\n71 The value implied by the NEDA shadow exchange rate factor of 1.2.\n\n\f32\n\nB. \n\nEstimated Impact on Poverty\n\n150.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  in  approximately  100  LGUs  (1,200  villages)  across  the\nproject area. The geographic coverage and the selection criteria for LGU participants ensure that\nthe Project will provide infrastructure in rural areas where nearly half of the households are poor.\nBased  on  an  analysis  of  the  core  subprojects,  it  is  estimated  that  the  Project  will  directly  benefit\nsome  700,000  people  (50  percent  of  which  being  poor)  and  indirectly  benefit  another  160,000\npeople (47 percent of which being poor). By project completion, at least 90,000 people should be\nlifted  out  of  poverty.  Approximately  1,000  person-years  of  incremental  employment  will  be\ngenerated, 57 percent of which is expected to benefit the poor.\n\n151.  However,  only  about  0.4  percent  of  the  poverty-reduction  impact  can  be  attributed  to  the\nincome generated from construction or maintenance of the infrastructure, while the remaining 99.6\npercent is due to its usage. On a subsectoral basis, 67 percent of the long-term poverty-reduction\nimpact  is  due  to  access  infrastructure  (with  approximately  51  percent  of  the  investment  cost),  19\npercent  due  to  irrigation  (with  approximately  41  percent  of  the  investment  cost),  and  14  percent\ndue to potable water supply (with approximately 8 percent of the investment cost). An analysis of\npotential beneficiaries shows that access infrastructure is the most effective way to reduce poverty\nin  the  rural  Philippines,  while  irrigation  shows  the  smallest  impact.  This  is  mainly  because  many\nirrigation  users  and  beneficiaries  are  not  below  the  poverty  line.  Additionally,  potable  water\nschemes are a highly effective means of addressing rural poverty in the Philippines, although most\nof the impact is on income poverty (additional time for agricultural production) rather than human\npoverty (reduction in waterborne diseases).\n\n152.  The  Project  will  have  only  marginal  poverty-reduction  impact  at  the  national  level  (an\nestimated reduction from 35.7 percent of rural poverty incidence in 2000 to 35.6 percent in 2008).\nAt the village and municipal level, however, the poverty-reduction impact will be substantial: from\nestimated  60  percent  incidence  in  2000  to  49  percent  in  2008  for  the  targeted  villages  and\nmunicipalities.  Appendix  11  provides  a  summary  poverty  impact  assessment  including  the\nunderlying assumptions.\n\nC. \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n153.  A social impact assessment was conducted during project formulation. During this process,\ncomprehensive consultations with beneficiaries were undertaken and surveys were carried out in\nall core subproject sites. Through the provision of improved rural road infrastructure, the Project will\ndirectly  and  indirectly  help  reduce  poverty  in  the  project  area.  Improved  accessibility  will  lead  to\nmore reliable and efficient flow of goods and people, incentives to increase agricultural production,\nand  increased  labor  mobility,  all  of  which  will  result  in  additional  employment  and  incomes\n(Appendix 11).\n\n154. \nIndirect social benefits to communities that gain access through better roads will include (i)\nimproved educational attendance by primary and secondary school students, and (ii) better access\nto  health  facilities.  In  addition,  specific  measures  have  been  included  in  the  project  design  and\nimplementation  arrangements  to  ensure  that  employment  and  business  opportunities  will  be\nprovided  to  local  people  to  enhance  their  incomes  by  participating  in  road  rehabilitation  and\nmaintenance activities.\n\n155.  Construction  and  rehabilitation  of  small  irrigation  schemes  will  increase  agricultural\nproduction  significantly.  Irrigation  can  provide  farmers  with  one  additional  crop  per  year.  As  the\ncriteria for selecting subprojects include poverty indicators, small-scale farmers will benefit from the\nProject  in  particular.  Increased  agricultural  production  will  also  benefit  landless  farmers  as  it  is\nanticipated that middle size and large farmers will require additional labor input.\n\n156.  The  Project  will  benefit  women  in  particular  by  improving  access  to  drinking  water.  The\nprovision of water supplies can reduce the time spent collecting water and can lead to better health\nboth through the quality of drinking water and improved hygiene.\n\n\f33\n\nD. \n\nProject Risks\n\n157.  With  a  history  of  poor  revenue  collection,  the  Government  faces  frequent  budget  deficits.\nWith devolution, LGUs are increasingly burdened with new responsibilities for which they often do\nnot have adequate counterpart funds for investment or maintenance. This is particularly true for the\npoorer  LGUs,  which  are  the  main  recipients  of  investment  under  the  Project.  Furthermore,  the\nfunds  that  the  LGUs  will  be  required  to  contribute  to  the  financing  of  subprojects  could  result  in\ncrowding out of other necessary investments, particularly in the social sectors. This could result in\ndelays  in  project  implementation  and  have  a  negative  impact  on  other  LGU  and  Government\ndevelopment and poverty reduction goals.\n\n158.  Devolution of agricultural services and rural infrastructure facilities to LGUs as provided by\nthe LGC and AFMA presents both a challenge and an opportunity. While devolution moves project\nidentification and implementation closer to beneficiaries, it also introduces an additional element of\nuncertainty,  particularly  as  regards  commitment  and  capability.  The  financial,  technical,  and\nmanagerial  capacity  of  LGUs  to  implement  these  projects  is  recognized  to  be  limited.  LGUs,\nhowever,  are  in  the  best  position  to  make  sure  that  subprojects  are  located  and  designed  most\nappropriately  and  involve  the  beneficiaries  themselves  in  the  identification  of  needs  and  O&M  of\nthe completed facilities. Experience has clearly shown that the Government cannot effectively carry\nout these functions.\n\n159.  The  risks  arising  from  the  implementation  capacity  of  the  LGUs,  changes  in  political\nleadership  and  priorities,  and  the  maintenance  capability  of  LGUs  and  of  the  beneficiaries\nthemselves will be mitigated by timely, appropriate, and effective capability-building activities that\nthe  Project  will  finance.  Participatory  planning,  as  implemented  under  IRAP,  will  ensure  that\nbeneficiary  communities  are  committed  to  the  subproject.  This  commitment  will  result  in\nsubprojects that are less susceptible to political change, more likely to be maintained properly, and\nappropriate to the implementation capacity of the LGU.\n\n VII.  ASSURANCES\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\n160.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the Loan Agreement:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nOperations  Manual.    Within  two  months  of  loan  effectivity,  DA  will  prepare  an\noperations  manual  acceptable  to  ADB.  DA  and  the  project  implementing  agencies\nwill carry out the Project in accordance with the operations manual.\n\nSubproject Selection.  As part of the process of selecting an LGU and subproject\nto be included in the Project, satisfaction of the following conditions will be required:\n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nThe  LGU  will  have  adequate  financial  and  organizational  capability  and\ncommitment to participate in the Project and the total investment cost of the\nproposed subproject will be between $250,000 and $5 million equivalent.\n\nA  comprehensive  feasibility  study  will  have  been  prepared,  appraised,  and\napproved by the PCU.  This study will include an assessment by MDFO of\nthe  financial  capability  of  the  LGU  to  ensure  that  adequate  resources  are\navailable for proper maintenance of infrastructure.\n\nThe LGU will have entered into an implementation agreement with DA (with\nterms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB),  including  the  commitment  of  the\nLGU to provide (i) the necessary equity contribution, in cash or in kind; and\n(ii)  the  necessary  O&M  for  the  subproject  facilities  after  completion  of\nconstruction.\n\n\f34\n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n(h) \n\n(i) \n\nIf  the  LGU  obtains  financing  from  MDFO  to  fund  any  of  its  share  of  the\ninvestment  cost  of  its  subproject,  the  LGU  (at  the  relevant  level)  will  have\nentered  into  a  subloan  agreement  with  MDFO  specifying  the  obligations  of\nthe LGU in accordance with the provisions of the operations manual.\n\nFor any subproject that costs more than $500,000 equivalent, DA will have\nsubmitted the subproject\u2019s feasibility study to ADB for prior approval.\n\nIf  the  subproject  includes  CIS  construction  or  rehabilitation,  an  IA  will  have\nbeen established and be operational. If the subproject includes construction\nor  improvement  of  a  potable  water  supply  system,  a  VWSA  will  have  been\nestablished and will be operational.\n\nIf  the  subproject  involves  any  resettlement,  a  full  resettlement  plan  (if  the\nnumber of affected persons is 200 or more) or a short resettlement plan (if\nfewer than 200 persons are affected), in accordance with the relevant laws\nand \nthe  Project\n(Supplementary Appendix E), and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement,\nwill have been prepared.\n\nresettlement  plan  prepared \n\nregulations, \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nIf  any  indigenous  peoples  are  likely  to  be  affected  significantly  under  a\nsubproject, an indigenous peoples plan will be prepared in accordance with\nrelevant laws and regulations and with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples.\n\nroad, \n\ninvolving \n\nirrigation, \n\nFor  a  subproject \nflood,  and/or  drainage\ninfrastructure  (i) an  IEE  will  have  been  prepared  as  part  of  the  detailed\ndesign and feasibility, in accordance with applicable environmental laws and\nregulations  and  relevant  ADB  guidelines;  (ii)  the  IEE  will  be  forwarded  to\nADB  for  approval  on  a  no-objection  basis  for  any  subproject  in  an\nenvironmentally  sensitive  area  or  which  costs  in  excess  of  $1  million\nequivalent;  and  (iii)  the  subproject  will  be  designed  on  the  basis  of\nenvironmental standards acceptable to ADB.\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nIrrigators\u2019 Associations and Village Waterworks and Sanitation Associations.\nThe Government will ensure that IAs and VWSAs are strengthened to manage O&M\nof  CIS  and  potable  water  supply  improvements  made  under  the  Project  and  to\nrecover O&M and, as applicable, investment costs through beneficiary contributions\nin kind and/or cash.\n\nCounterpart  Contributions.  The  LGUs  will  maintain  the  infrastructure  provided\nunder the Project, including providing specific budget allocations for O&M costs. The\nGovernment will ensure the (i) timely release of adequate budgetary allocations for\nall counterpart funds required for project implementation; (ii) timely selection of the\nrequired  number  of  subprojects  for  project  participation  in  accordance  with  criteria\nagreed  with  ADB;  and  (iii)  participating  LGUs\u2019  provision  of  local  counterpart\ncontributions (cash or in-kind) from their own resources to finance the costs of the\nsubprojects  within  their  respective  municipalities  in  accordance  with  the  terms  and\nconditions  of  such  cost-sharing  arrangements  detailed  in  the  implementation\nagreements and/or subloan agreements.\n\n(v) \n\nSubproject  Implementation.  Each  LGU  will  undertake,  in  accordance  with\ncomprehensive  participatory  methodologies  detailed  in  the  operations  manual,\nadequate  planning,  design,  and  construction  activities.

ONGOING PROJECTS\nINVOLVING RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE1\n\nLessons Learned from ADB-Assisted Projects\n\nIncorporation of Lessons Learned\n\nA. Capacity of Community Organizations\n\u2022  Establishment of effective beneficiary\n\norganizations is critical to ensure that the\nfacilities built under the project lead the\nintended impact (Loans 528/529[SF]-PHI:\nPalawan Integrated Area Development).\n\u2022  Sufficient inputs need to be provided for\ndeveloping beneficiary organizations to\neffectively manage facilities (Loan 802-PHI:\nHighland Agriculture Development).\n\u2022  Forming community-level water users\nassociations and building capacity for\nimproving their skills should precede the\nactual construction of the facility. (Loan\n1052[SF]-PHI: Second Island Province Rural\nWater Supply Sector).\n\nB. Beneficiary Participation\n\n\u2022 \n\nInvolvement of the potential beneficiaries in\ndesigning irrigation structures is essential to\ngenerate a sense of ownership and to benefit\nfrom their experience and knowledge of local\ngeotechnical conditions (Loan 466-PHI:\nSecond Laguna de Bay Irrigation).\n\n\u2022  Beneficiary participation in the planning and\ndesign of project components can improve\nthe relevance of project-supplied facilities to\nthe needs of the beneficiaries (Loan 802-PHI:\nHighland Agriculture Development).\n\u2022  The process of site selection needs to be\nmore demand-driven. The process of\nconsultations with local communities and\nlocal government unites should be\nstrengthened and structured (Loan 812-PHI:\nIsland Province Rural Water Supply Sector).\n\nC. Operation and Maintenance\n\ni. To ensure that sufficient organizational capacity\nis in place at the community level, participating\nlocal government units (LGUs) will be required\nto demonstrate that (i) effective community\norganizations are established prior to project\nplanning, and (ii) community organizations have\nagreements with the LGU concerning roles and\nresponsibilities and financing arrangements for\ncontributions to both investment and\nmaintenance costs.\n\nii. The project will support strengthening\ncommunity organizations\u2019 capacity for\nundertaking operation and maintenance (O&M)\nand for promoting cost recovery.\n\ni. To ensure that participatory approaches are\n\napplied at all stages of project implementation,\nLGUs will be required to demonstrate, as a\nprecondition to project support, that a\nsubproject is identified through a community\nconsultation process. Participating communities\nwill also be directly involved in designing the\nsubprojects, supervising construction, and\noperating and maintaining the facilities (see\nalso D.ii.).\n\nii. To ensure that subprojects proposed by LGUs\n\nreflect the needs and priorities of the respective\ncommunities, the Project will coordinate with the\nongoing International Labour Organization\u2019s\nIntegrated Rural Accessibility Planning project.\nIn addition, as part of the capacity building\nprogram supported under the Project, LGUs will\nbe trained in project management using\nparticipatory planning tools and techniques.\n\n\u2022  To promote improved O&M of the facilities\ncreated, the project should ensure that\n(i) targeted beneficiaries and potential users\nare organized and actively involved from the\nvery beginning of the project cycle; and\n(ii) LGUs and end users have clearly defined\nresponsibilities for O&M of facilities and that\nthe responsibilities are agreed upon in\n\ni. The Project is designed to improve O&M of\n\nrural infrastructure by promoting decentralized\nand participatory O&M and cost-recovery\narrangements. For communal irrigation and\npotable water supply facilities, LGUs will ensure\nthat community organizations (such as irrigators\nassociations [IAs], and village waterworks and\nsanitation associations [VWSA]) will assume\n\n1  Lessons learned were derived from the relevant projects closed after 1990 and ongoing projects assisted by the Asian\n\n                  \n\nDevelopment Bank (ADB).\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 2, page 2\n\nLessons Learned from ADB-Assisted Projects\n\nIncorporation of Lessons Learned\n\nadvance (Loans 341/727-PHI: Allah River\nIrrigation; Loan 915-PHI: Sorsogon Integrated\nArea Development; 1332[SF]-PHI: Rural\nInfrastructure Development; and Loans\n1365/66[SF]: Second Irrigation System\nImprovement).\n\n\u2022  The tariff collection should be regular and the\nlevel should (i) be set according to the level of\nservice, and (ii) cover expenses for regular\nand periodic maintenance.

The details of O&M arrangements will be\n\nspecified in the subproject implementation\nagreements between the LGU concerned and\nthe Department of Agriculture (DA). If an LGU\nfails to comply with this agreement, the\nGovernment grant will be converted into an\nLGU loan from the Municipal Development\nFund Office.\n\nD. Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n\u2022  The performance of contractors for\n\ni. To ensure transparency and accountability,\n\ninfrastructure and compliance with design\nstandards (construction supervision) must be\nclosely monitored (Loans 341/727-PHI: Allah\nRiver Irrigation; Loan 580-PHI: Third Davao\ndel Norte Irrigation; Loan 597-PHI: Third\nRoad Improvement; and Loan 801-PHI:\nFourth Road Improvement).\n\n\u2022  Constant monitoring of project benefits\n\n(including social and environmental) should\nbe provided during project implementation\n(Loan 545-PHI: Water Supply Sector; and\nLoan 580-PHI: Third Davao del Norte\nIrrigation).\n\n\u2022  Comprehensive supervision and reviews by\nADB are necessary to ensure adequate and\ntimely project implementation (Loan 362[SF]-\nPHI: Second Agusan Irrigation; Loan\n406[SF]-PHI: Bukidnon Irrigation; and Loan\n285[SF]-PHI: Second Davao del Norte\nIrrigation).\n\nmultisectoral subproject monitoring boards will\nbe established for each subproject. These will\nbe composed of representatives from the LGU,\nlocal NGOs and peoples\u2019 organizations,\ncontractors, beneficiaries, and other\nstakeholders. The boards will be responsible for\nmonitoring project bidding, construction quality\nand progress, etc.\n\nii. The Project will establish an independent\n\nparticipatory project performance monitoring\nsystem for each subproject. The system will\nallow beneficiary communities to systematically\nprovide feedback on the progress of subproject\nimplementation and the effectiveness and\nimpact of subproject activities.\n\niii. Semiannual reviews will be conducted in the\ninitial years until ADB judges that an annual\nreview will be sufficient for efficient\nadministration. In addition, a comprehensive\nreview will be undertaken jointly by DA and\nADB after 18 months and at the midterm of the\nProject during the third year.\n\n\fCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n\nTable A3.1: Expenditure Costs by Financier\n\nItem\n\nA.

Rural infrastructure\nincludes  rural  roads  and  other  transport  links,  communal  irrigation  systems,  and  potable  water\nsupply facilities. Ten core subprojects have been identified and assessed in terms of resettlement\nand  land  acquisition  issues.  The  assessment  indicated  that  none  of  the  10  core  subprojects  are\nexpected to have a significant impact in terms of resettlement.\n\nThe summary resettlement plan provides an estimate of cost based on design data for two\n2. \ncore subprojects, the first in the municipality of Kapalong, Davao del Norte, and the second in the\nmunicipality of Mainit, Surigao del Norte. Additional survey work will need to be prepared to assess\nthe land acquisition requirements when the design work has been finalized for all subprojects.\n\n3. \nFor  subprojects  where  resettlement  impacts  are  anticipated,  the  resettlement  plan  will  be\nupdated prior to commencing works. Receipt of the updated final resettlement plan acceptable to\nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be a condition for commencing construction.\n\nB. \n\nResettlement Policy\n\n4. \nResettlement will be implemented according to legislation of the Government of Philippines\nand in accordance with ADB policy on involuntary resettlement (November 1995).  The basis under\nthe Constitution and laws of the Republic of the Philippines are as follows: (i) The 1987 Philippine\nConstitution;  (ii)  Executive  Order  1035  (1985);  (iii)  Administrative  Order  65,  Series  of  1983;\n(iv) Republic Act 6389; and (iv) Administrative Order 50 (1999).\n\nC.\n\nMinimization of Resettlement Impact\n\n5. \nThe Project will adopt a policy of minimizing adverse resettlement impacts and reducing the\nnumber  of  affected  persons  by  continuously  reviewing  the  design  to  further  minimize  land\nacquisition and resettlement requirements.\n\nD. \n\nResettlement Impacts\n\nThere  is  only  insignificant  impact  in  terms  of  resettlement  in  the  two  core  subprojects\n6. \nassessed. In the Mainit subproject, 23 people are likely to be affected. The Mainit subproject has\ntwo components: communal irrigation, and construction and rehabilitation of rural roads (9.4 km).\nThree people are likely to be affected because of relocation of their residences and acquisition of\nagricultural land; 19 landowners and 1 tenant farmer are likely to be affected by land acquisition for\nthe rural road projects. The total land for acquisition for road right-of-way is 1.26 ha.\n\n7. \nIn  the  municipality  of  Kapalong  subproject,  20  people  are  likely  to  be  affected.  The\ncomponents  of  the  subproject  consist  of  upgrading  of  rural  roads  with  a  total  length  of  24.5  km\nexpansion  of  two  communal  irrigation  systems,  and  construction  of  one  communal  irrigation\nsystem. Eight people are likely to be affected by the relocation of their residential households and\n12 are likely to be affected by land acquisition for the irrigation projects. One person whose house\nneeds relocation may lose livelihood and income. Total land acquisition is about 3 ha affecting 12\npeople for the construction of a communal irrigation system dam and the construction of a bridge.\n\nE. \n\nResettlement Principles and Entitlements\n\nConsistent with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s policy, affected people will be assisted to\n8. \nmaintain their original standard of living, at a level at least equal to what they enjoyed prior to the\nProject. All possible means will be explored to minimize resettlement impacts through modification\nof the engineering designs. This will be carried out in close consultation with the affected people.\nPlans for acquisition of land and other assets will be implemented in consultation with the affected\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 8, page 2\n\npeople to ensure minimal disturbance. Financial and physical resources for compensation will be\nmade available as and when required.\n\n9. \nAffected  people  may  resettle  themselves  or  will  be  resettled  in  close  proximity  to  their\nvillages. Legal owners and tenants of land will be compensated and assisted with rehabilitation. No\nworks  under  any  contract  awarded  under  the  Project  will  commence  until  all  required  funds  are\nmade  available  to  the  concerned  land  acquisition  collector  and  compensation  payments  and/or\nother assistance have been made available to the affected persons.\n\nWhen  the  design  of  subprojects  have  been  finalized  and  if  there  are  resettlement\n10. \nimpacts,  an  entitlement  matrix  will  be  prepared  for  each  subproject  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nresettlement policy. An independent review of the resettlement operation will be commissioned by\nADB  after  completion  of  the  Project  to  assess  whether  the  affected  people  have  regained  or\nimproved their livelihoods and standards of living.\n\nF.\n\nConsultations and Grievance Procedures\n\n11. \nSocial  preparation  is  an  essential  part  of  the  planning  and  implementation  of  the\nresettlement  process.    The  process  will  include  formal  participation  of  the  community  in\nestablishing road alignments and irrigation sites, meeting with affected people to inform them of the\nbenefit  of  the  project,  the  impact  on  them,  and  their  entitlements  to  compensate  them  for  their\nlosses.  The  village chairman  will  be  responsible  for  social  preparation  in  his  or  her  village.  The\nlocal government unit (LGU) and village officials will enlist the assistance of local nongovernment\norganizations  to  inform  the  affected  persons  of  the  impacts  of  the  project,  their  entitlements  and\nrehabilitation options under the resettlement action plan.\n\nGrievance procedures will be established. Affected people will present their complaints\n12. \nto the village council. If they are not satisfied with the village council\u2019s response, they may appeal\nto the LGU\u2019s project steering committee (PSC) or the mayor if no PSC has been established. If the\naffected  people  do  not  find  the  decision  of  the  PSC  or  the  mayor  satisfactory,  the  case  may  be\nsubmitted for consideration to the Department of Agriculture\u2019s project coordination unit.\n\nG.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\nIf  resettlement  impacts  from  a  subproject  are  anticipated,  a  resettlement  coordination\n13. \ncommittee  (RCC)1  will  be  responsible  for  planning  and  implementing  all  activities  related  to  the\nresettlement action plan in the LGU. This committee will be part of the subproject or the subproject\nmonitoring  board.  The  RCC  will  report  to  the  LGU\u2019s  project  steering  committee,  which  assumes\noverall responsibility for enforcement of the resettlement action plan.\n\n14. \nThe  project  steering  committee  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  the\nresettlement plan. Quarterly monitoring reports will be submitted during project implementation and\nan evaluation report before project completion.\n\nH. \n\nCost\n\nFor  purposes  of  illustration,  the  estimated  resettlement  cost  of  the  Mainit  subproject  is\n15. \nP452,650  and  the  estimated  resettlement  cost  of  the  Kapalong  subproject  is  P720,000.  The\nresettlement  cost  for  each  individual  subproject  will  be  determined  when  the  design  of  the\nsubproject is finalized.  The full costs of resettlement and compensation will be the responsibility of\nthe LGU.\n\n1  The  RCC  includes  local  government  officials,  barangay  officials,  representatives  of  affected  persons,  and  NGO\n\n                  \n\nrepresentatives.\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 9, page 1\n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS\n\nA total of about 748 person-months of consulting services will be required.

In 1997, the latest year for which Family Income and\nExpenditure  Survey  data  are  available,  32.1  percent  or  4.5  million  families  had  income  below\nthe  poverty  threshold,  and  44.4  percent  of  rural  households  (equivalent  to  51.2  percent  of  the\nrural  population)  fell  below  the  threshold.  By  headcount,  37.5  percent  of  the  population  was\nbelow  the  poverty  line  in  1997,  equivalent  to  27.25  million  people.1  In  the  project  area,  the\npoverty incidence ranges between 49.0 and 63.6 percent, which is substantially higher than the\nnational  average  of  37.5  percent.2  The  severity  of  poverty  is  also  higher.  Between  24  and  37\npercent  of  the  population  in  the  project  area  are  severely  poor  with  income  under  the  food\nthreshold, compared to 20 percent for the Philippines as a whole (Table A11.1). Rural poverty is\nmost  common  among  (i)  lowland  landless  agricultural  workers,  tenants,  and  leaseholders;\n(ii) lowland small farm owners and cultivators; (iii) upland farmers on steeply sloped land; and\n(iv) fisherfolk.\n\nSocial  indicators  are  also  low  in  the  Project  area:  the  average  value  of  the  life\n2. \nexpectancy index for the Philippines is 0.72, and the lowest value in one of the provinces of the\nproject area (Tawi-Tawi) is 0.47.  The project area has higher than average infant mortality than\nthe nation as a whole and the infant mortality rate in the project regions include the worst in the\nPhilippines. Diaerrheal diseases are the main cause of death among children younger than five,\nwith lack of clean water supplies clearly contributing to a high infant mortality rate. The human\ndevelopment  index  (HDI)  ranges  between  0.491  for  the  Autonomous  Region  of  Muslim\nMindanao  and  0.673  for  the  island  provinces  of  Southern  Tagalog,  compared  to  0.740  for  the\nPhilippines as a whole.3\n\n3. \nSmallholder agricultural potential is constrained by (i) unequal land distribution; (ii) lack\nof access to basic inputs, transport, and storage facilities; (iii) the general decline of agricultural\nextension  services;  (iv)  difficulty  in  accessing  markets;  and  (v)  risks  due  to  natural  calamities\nsuch as La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o. The average size of farms tilled by the landless is 0.75 hectares\n(ha)  and  the  average  landholding  is  1.5  ha,  with  the  poor  farmers  having  land  holdings  of\nbetween 1.0 and 2.5 ha. Land is more equitably distributed in Mindanao than in Eastern Visayas\nand  Bicol.  Common  crops  produced  by  landless  farmers  and  smallholders  are  rice,  coconut,\ncorn, and vegetables. Periods of extreme deprivation occur when there is no work at all, usually\nbetween the planting and harvesting seasons. Only a few have access to agricultural equipment\nand facilities. Due to their low income, the poor often depend on larger landowners for credit to\ncover as much as 80 percent of their required farm inputs such as seed and fertilizer. The cost\nof fertilizer in 1998-1999 was reported to have increased in the Philippines by 30 percent to as\nmuch as 60 percent.4\n\n                                                          \n1\n  These  data  differ  significantly  from  international  data  based  on  the  $1  per  day  per  capita  expenditure  on\nconsumption  level  equitable  to  2,400  kcal.  Based  on  World  Bank  (2000)  criteria,  the  incidence  of  poverty  has\nincreased from 24.7 percent in 1997 to 26.3 percent in 1999. This increase was due to the Asian financial crisis\nand the long drought and La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon. It is estimated that the country has 26.3 million poor people today,\nup from 18.2 million in 1997.\n\n2\n  Data  for  Southern  Tagalog  are  biased  toward  the  richer  provinces.  The  selected  island  provinces  in  Region  IV\n\ncovered by the Project have high incidences of poverty at between 45 and 55 percent.\n\n3\n  Poverty data are available only at the regional level, whereas HDI data have been generated at the provincial level.\n4\n  Reyes,  Celia  M.,  A.

These\ncommunities  mainly  suffer  from  the  perils  and  risks  posed  by  bad  roads  and  nonexistent\nbridges.  In  the  upland  areas  of  the  project  area,  particularly  in  Mindanao,  residents  walk,  use\nanimals,  or  use  motorcycles  as  the  basic  modes  of  transportation.  This  is  inefficient  and  the\ncosts  are  high,  primarily  due  to  the  limited  capacity  to  carry  agricultural  products.  Motorcycle\noperators  usually  demand  high  fares  even  for  short  distances.  The  poor  and  smallholders\ndepend heavily on the motorcycles, which are often the only way of marketing their products. To\nreduce expenditures, women and child labor (often unpaid) is used for transporting agricultural\nproducts  to  markets.  As  a  result,  children  are  often  absent  from  school  or  drop  out.  Improved\ntransportation  is  particularly  important  for  reducing  income  and  human  poverty  among  these\nupland residents.\n\n5. \nIn fishing communities, low productivity is associated with low fish stocks, resulting from\nuncontrolled and often illegal fishing and poaching, the control of which is often not enforced. In\nthe coastal areas, a day\u2018s catch only fetches an average income of P50, which is not sufficient\nfor  the  household\u2019s  daily  food  requirements.  Some  fisherfolk  have  expressed  the  need  to\nestablish fish sanctuaries, construct landing and storage facilities, and have access to financial\nassistance for the acquisition of boats and other fishing provisions. However, poverty in fishing\ncommunities  may  only  be  overcome  by  providing  new  income  opportunities  as  alternatives  to\ntraditional fishing.\n\nB. \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n1. \n\nVulnerability of Women and Children\n\n6. \nThe generally favorable indicators of women\u2019s education, health, and work participation\nin  the  Philippines  mask  a  number  of  gender  issues.  Women  in  rural  areas  are  typically\nresponsible for the household, the children, and small livestock. In fishing communities they are\noften responsible for selling fish. Single parent households, composed of widows and widowers,\nmany  of  whom  are  elderly,  depend  on  farming  and  pension  pay  for  their  subsistence.  Others\nrely on the support of children working as domestic servants in towns and cities.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\n7. \nWomen  and  children  (both  sexes)  are  also  often  responsible  for  fetching  water.  The\nprovision  of  water  supply  can  reduce  the  time  spent  collecting  water  and  can  lead  to  better\nhealth, both through the quality of drinking water and improved hygiene. It can, however, also\nlead  to  environmental  and  health  problems  if  proper  drainage  and  sanitation  are  not  used.\nRoads  are  of  particular  benefit  to  women,  providing  better  access  to  education  and  health\nservices, to vendors of household goods, and to markets for small livestock.\n\n2. \n\nIndigenous People\n\nThe project area in Mindanao comprises a good number of the indigenous peoples and\n8. \nthe  settlers  (mainly  from  Cebu  and  the  Visayas).  In  the  past,  indigenous  peoples  depended\nheavily  on  forest  resources  for  food,  as  they  are  traditionally  hunters  and  gatherers.  Many  of\nthem are now subsistence farmers, using the slash-and-burn system. Common crops grown are\ncoconut,  coffee,  and  sweet  potato.  However,  mainly  because  of  poor  access  infrastructure,\nmany  indigenous  peoples  live  outside  the  regular  market  economy  and  out  of  reach  of\nagricultural  extension  and  health  and  education  services.  Poor  market  access,  forest\ndegradation, health problems, and illiteracy are still the principal causes of their deprivation and\nimpoverishment.\n\n3. \n\nResettlement Issues\n\nResettlement  effects  are  not  anticipated  to  be  significant  in  the  Project.  However,\n9. \nreflecting  the  importance  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  places  on  careful  and  effective\nimplementation,  a  resettlement  and  compensation  plan  will  be  prepared  based  on  ADB\nguidelines. A summary resettlement plan is in Appendix 8.\n\n4. \n\nParticipatory Development\n\n10. \nThe project design is driven by the needs and demands of the communities that lack the\ninfrastructure  important  for  them  to  realize  the  productive  potential  of  their  land.  Subproject\nselection  is  based  on  participatory  consultations  at  the  village  level  in  conjunction  with  the\nmunicipal  administration  and  local  nongovernment  organizations  and  peoples\u2019  organizations.\nThese stakeholders will also be involved in project preparation, implementation, and monitoring\nand  evaluation.  Women  will  have  an  equal  opportunity  to  participate  in  project  activities,  and\nthey will be adequately represented in training and other project activities.\n\nC. \n\nExpected Poverty Reduction Impact of the Project5\n\nThe  economic  impacts  of  infrastructure  projects  have  been  identified  as  follows:  lower\n11. \nprices,  better  marketing  opportunities,  higher  profits  (the  price  level  for  fruit  and  vegetables  is\napproximately  20  percent  higher  at  town  markets  than  at  local  market),  more  employment\nopportunities  (including  construction  and  maintenance  of  project  roads),  all  leading  to  higher\ngross  domestic  product  growth  rate.  Improved  access  to  drinking  water  will  not  only  improve\nhealth  standards,  but  also  reduce  the  time  spent  on  collecting  water.  Without  the  basic  road\ninfrastructure,  it  is  difficult  to  access  health  and  educational  services,  which  are  presently\ninaccessible in much of the project area. While most direct benefits are in the form of reduced\ntransportation costs, the profits of middlemen acting as intermediates between the farmers and\nthe  market  (and  currently  dominating  the  marketing  structure  in  some  project  areas)  will  be\nmore equally shared among the poor.\n\n12. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  in  approximately  1,200  villages  of  100  municipalities\nand cities in the project regions. In 2000, 36.2 million people were living in the project area, of\n                                                          \n5\n  Supplementary  Appendix  G  provides  a  more  detailed  description  of  the  distribution  and  poverty  impact\n\nassessment.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 11, page 4\n\nwhich 18 million (almost 50 percent) were poor.6 Table A11.2 provides detailed information on\ndistribution of population in the project area and the incidence of poverty.\n\n13. \nBased  on  an  analysis  of  the  10  core  subprojects,  the  labor  market  impact  of  the\ninfrastructure  construction,  upgrading,  rehabilitation,  and  maintenance  is  estimated  at  319,900\nperson-days  (equivalent  to  1,064  person-years)  during  project  implementation.  About  50\npercent (532 person-years) is due to maintenance. It is assumed that 85 percent of the workers\nin  access  infrastructure,  40  percent  of  the  communal  irrigation,  and  70  percent  of  the  potable\nwater are poor. Hence, total labor market benefits for the poor is 8,530 persons (60 percent of\nall persons engaged) or 605 person-years (57 percent).\n\n14.  More  than  half  (50.4  percent)  of  the  labor  created  is  due  to  maintenance  and  this  is\nparticularly high for the access infrastructure component (85 percent). For sustainable poverty\nreduction impact, it is therefore important that labor for maintenance is paid wherever possible.\nThe Project will ensure that maintenance costs for access infrastructure, which is mostly labor,\nwill be included in the yearly maintenance budget of local government units.\n\n15. \nBased  on  the  10  core  subprojects,  it  is  estimated  that  the  Project  will  directly  benefit\nsome  700,000  people  (49.5  percent  of  which  being  poor)  and  indirectly  benefit  about  160,000\npeople  (46.9  percent  of  which  being  poor).  For  access  infrastructure  it  is  assumed  that  all\ninhabitants  of  the  targeted  villages  will  benefit  directly  (over  a  period  of  4  years),  whereas  an\nadditional  20  percent  of  other  road  users  will  benefit.  About  50  percent  of  the  direct  and  20\npercent  of  the  indirect  beneficiaries  will  be  the  poor.7  In  the  case  of  communal  irrigation,  40\npercent of the direct beneficiaries will be poor while 80 percent of the indirect beneficiaries will\nbe poor (a result of the increased demand for agricultural short-term labor due to the additional\ncropping). For the potable water schemes everybody in the village will benefit equally but there\nis  only  small  indirect  impact;  hence,  60  percent  of  the  direct  beneficiaries  will  be  the  poor.\nBased  on  these  assumptions  a  total  (direct  and  indirect)  of  approximately  676,000  people  will\nbenefit  from  access  infrastructure  (46  percent  of  which  being  poor),  approximately  147,000\npeople  will  benefit  from  communal  irrigation  (60  percent  of  which  being  poor),  and\napproximately  42,000  people  will  benefit  from  potable  water  schemes  (60  percent  of  which\nbeing poor).\n\n16.  While  the  Project  has  positive  poverty  reduction  impact  on  poor  people  in  the  project\narea, only about 22 percent of all poor targeted under the Project will be lifted out of poverty on\na sustainable basis by the end of 2007. The majority of the sustainable poverty reduction impact\nis  due  to  additional  income  opportunities  generated  for  the  poor  through  the  use  and\nmaintenance the infrastructure\n\nOn a subsectoral basis, 67.1 percent of the sustainable poverty reduction impact is due\n17. \nto  access  infrastructure  (which  comprises  51  percent  of  the  investment  costs),  19.4  percent\nfrom  communal  irrigation  (comprising  41.4  percent  of  the  investment  costs),  and  13.5  percent\ncan  be  attributed  to  the  potable  water  schemes  (comprising  7.6  percent  of  the  investment\ncosts).    One  can  therefore  conclude  that,  among  the  project  subcomponents,  access\ninfrastructure is the most effective way to reduce poverty. At the village and municipal level, the\nProject  will  substantially  contribute  to  poverty  reduction,  from  an  estimated  60.0  percent\nincidence in 2000 to an estimated 48.9 percent in 2008. Additional livelihood opportunities will\nfurther increase the poverty reduction impact.\n\n                                                          \n6\n  Data are derived from the 1995 census plus 7 percent population increase for the rural project area. However, the\ntotal  population  increase  is  higher  (10  percent)  but  the  absolute  population  increase  is  lower  due  is  concurrent\nmigration to urban areas.\n\n7\n  The lower incidence of road users being poor (50 percent) compared to the village poverty incidence (60 percent)\n\nis due to the fact that the better off will use the access infrastructure more often than the poor.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 11, page 5\n\nTable A11.2: Estimated Poverty Reduction Impact of the Project\n\nTotal\n\nAccess\nInfrastructure\n\nCommunal\nIrrigation\n\nPotable Water\nSupply\n\n79.2\n\n40.4\n\n6.0\n\nArea of Impact\nPopulation (in 1,000; estimated\nfor the year 2000)\nProject Area\nCovered Municipalities\nCovered Villages\n\nPoverty Incidence (percent) and\nNumber of Poor People in the\nPhilippines (million), 1997\n\nRural Philippines\nProject Area\n\nCovered 100 Municipalities\n\nInfrastructure Costs\n(million pesos)\nNumber of Beneficiaries\n\nOf which Poor\n\nDirect\n\nIndirect\n\nOf which Poor\n\nOf which Poor\nLong-Term Poverty\nReduction Impact (number of\npoor who have been lifted out of\npoverty on a sustainable basis)\n\nContribution (percent)\n\nThrough Labor Market Impact\n(construction, rehabilitation,\nmaintenance of the\ninfrastructure)\nThrough the Direct and Indirect\nUsage of the Infrastructure\n\nDirect\nIndirect\n\nChange in the Overall Incidence\nof Poverty over Project Life\n\nRural Philippines\nProject Area\n\nParticipating Municipalities\nParticipating Villages\n\n36,210\n6,974\n840\n35.7 / 27.2\n\n51.2 / 19.5\n49.9 / 18.1\n50.0 / 3.5\n32.8\n\n865,360\n424,328\n705,600\n349,440\n159,760\n74,888\n93,307\n\n676,200\n311,640\n588,000\n294,000\n88,200\n17,640\n62,608\n\n147,160\n87,488\n75,600\n30,240\n71,560\n57,248\n18,078\n\n100\n379\n\n67.1\n280\n\n19.4\n96\n\n92,910\n\n62,328\n\n86,520\n6,390\n\n58,800\n3,528\n\n17,982\n\n15,120\n2,862\n\n35.7(cid:1) 35.6\n51.2 (cid:1) 51.0\n49.9 (cid:1) 49.6\n50.0 (cid:1) 48.7\n60.0 (cid:1) 48.9\n\nNote: If the national poverty line is applied the incidence of rural poverty is about 15 percent higher.\nSource: Staff estimates, based on national data and surveys.\n\n42,000\n25,200\n42,000\n25,200\n0\n0\n12,621\n\n13.5\n21\n\n12,600\n\n12,600\n0\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 12, page 1\n\nFINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES\n\nA. \n\nGeneral Approach to Financial and Economic Analysis\n\n1. \nFinancial and economic analyses have been carried out for the 10 core subprojects developed\nduring  the  project  formulation.  These  analyses  review  the  components  of  each  individual  pilot\nsubproject as well as the Project as a whole.\n\n1. \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n2. \nFinancial analyses were carried out from the viewpoint of the participant farming households\nand irrigator\u2019s associations (IAs).1 For irrigation development the analysis shows the expected impact\nof project investments in providing an assured supply of water on the income from crop production for\na  household  with  an  average  sized  holding.  The  analysis  also  shows  the  impact  of  operations  and\nmaintenance (O&M) costs, loan repayments, and income from irrigation fees on the cash flow of the\nIAs  responsible  for  operating  and  maintaining  the  communal  irrigation  schemes.  For  investments  in\nrural  roads  the  expected  impact  on  production  at  the  farm  level  has  been  assessed  based  on\nexperience elsewhere in the project area.\n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nThe  economic  analysis  for  the  Project  assumes  that  the  costs  and  benefits  of  the  10  core\n3. \nsubprojects for which feasibility studies have been undertaken will be representative of all those to be\nfinanced from the Project loan. The period of analysis for each year\u2019s infrastructure investment is 20\nyears,  reflecting  the  economic  life  of  rural  roads  and  communal  irrigation  systems  and  communal\nirrigation projects.2\n\n4. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  normally  uses  12  percent  as  the  opportunity  cost  of  capital\n(OCC) for  its developing member  countries. Using the model developed by the Harvard Institute for\nInternational Development (HIID)3 the OCC was 11.5 percent in 1993 and more recent economic data\ngives a figure of around 12 percent. This latter figure has been used when assessing the economic\nviability  of  the  Project.  However,  this  analysis  uses  15  percent  when  assessing  the  viability  of  the\nsubprojects and their components. Such an approach allows for the inclusion of the costs of capacity\nbuilding  and  project  coordination  and  management  that  are  required  to  realize  the  benefits  of  the\nsubproject investments and  can not be allocated to individual subprojects. Therefore, all subproject\ninvestments  should  show  a  minimum  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  15  percent  to  be\neligible for funding from project sources to give an overall project return in excess of 12 percent.\n\n5. \nThe  economic  analysis  has  been  carried  out  in  the  national  currency  with  traded  goods  and\nservices  valued  at  either  their  free  on  board  (fob)  or  cost,  insurance,  and  freight  (cif)  values,  as\nappropriate.  The  World  Bank  Commodity  Markets  and  the  Developing  Countries  report  (April  2000)\nhas  been  used  to  provide  price  estimates  for  those  project  commodities  that  are  widely  traded  (rice\nand fertilizers). Using the model developed by HIID3 and 1997 data (the latest available) gives 0.91 as\nthe standard  conversion factor (SCF) and the analysis uses this value to revalue the financial prices\nof  all  nontraded  goods  and  services.  For  unskilled  labor  the  economic  analysis  uses  the  financial\nopportunity cost based on the prevailing wage rates in the subproject areas (i.e., P110/day reduced to\nP90/day) to reflect the extent to which labor is unemployed or underemployed multiplied by the SCF.\nOn this basis the conversion factor for labor is 0.68 equivalent to an economic cost of P75 per day.\n \n                                                    \n1  Supplementary Appendix A contains analyses of each core subproject.\n2  No  potable  water  supply  scheme  was  submitted  as  part  of  a  core  subproject  proposal.  However,  some  water  supply\nschemes  are  expected  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  and  a  model  for  the  financial  and  economic  analysis  of  water\nsupply schemes has been prepared and is included in this appendix.\n\n3 Economic Parameters for the Appraisal of Investment Projects: Bangladesh, Indonesia and Philippines, December 1993.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\n6. \n The sensitivity analyses for the subproject components were based on the calculation of the\nsensitivity index and switching values for key variables. A sensitivity analysis has also been run for the\nwhole project using the values that the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) uses\nfor the OCC and SCF, as for national planning purposes it is desirable that all projects are assessed\nusing  the  same  national  parameters.  According  to  NEDA,  the  SCF  is  0.83  (reflecting  a  shadow\nexchange rate factor of 1.20) and the OCC is 15 percent.4\n\nB. \n\nProject Cost Estimates\n\n7. \nThe  project  cost  estimates,  including  contingencies,  were  the  basis  of  the  financial  and\neconomic analyses and were prepared using the Costab software. Estimated costs for all components\n(including all the costs associated with capacity building), but after deducting the price contingencies,\nwere  converted  to  economic  values  by  subtracting  all  transfer  payments  and  multiplying  the  local\ncurrency  costs  (i.e.,  costs  of  nontraded  items)  by  the  SCF.  Costs  of  capacity  building  and  project\nmanagement will not continue beyond the end of the project period (7 years). Project costs include the\ncosts  of  salaries  of  all  government  staff  required  by  project  activities  whether  such  staff  are  hired\nspecifically  on  contract  or  are  already  employed.5  Net  project  benefits  include  the  incremental  O&M\ncosts required for project investments to continue to operate throughout their economic life.\n\nC. \n\nDetailed Assumptions for the Analysis of Project Components\n\n8. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  increase  crop  production  through  the  provision  of  irrigation  which\nwill increase rice yields, cropping intensities, and the use of inputs. In addition, the costs of transport\nare expected to decrease, and as a result, farm incomes to increase in the areas of influence of the\nroads upgraded and/or constructed with project assistance. With improved access and lower transport\ncosts subsequent increases in marketed production are anticipated through the introduction of higher\nvalue  crops  and  use  of  additional  purchased  inputs.  Further  benefits  will  accrue  from  time  savings\nfrom  potable  water  supply  schemes  and  decreased  disease  and  sickness  from  improved  water\nquality.\n\n1. \n\nRural Roads\n\n9. \nReconstruction  of  existing  and  construction  of  new  roads  will  result  in  reduced  vehicle\noperating costs (VOCs) due to (i) the lower cost per kilometer traveled following improvement to the\nroad surface; and (ii) the shift to more cost-effective modes of transport (e.g., water buffalo sledge to\njeepney).  The  economic  analysis  calculates  the  savings  in  the  cost  per  ton/kilometer  and  per\nperson/kilometer using (i) standard data from the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH),\nand (ii) subproject specific data from each subproject. The main assumptions used are as follows:\n\n(i) \n\nFor  motorized  transport  average  VOCs  are  based  on  October  1999  DPWH  standard\nfigures  expressed  in  economic  prices  for  different  means  of  transport  under  different\nroad conditions. These values allow for the fact that not all vehicles are commercially\noperated  and  that  savings  in  VOCs  do  not  necessarily  always  transfer  into  fleet\nreduction  costs.  The  time  cost  element  only  takes  account  of  the  likely  proportion  of\npassengers who are traveling during working time or to and from work valuing this time\nat 100 percent and 50 percent respectively of the appropriate wage rates. It does not\ninclude the value of leisure time saved. VOCs per kilometer are converted into values\nper ton kilometer and per person kilometer.\n\n(ii) \n\nFor  nonmotorized  transport  (e.g.,  boat  and  water  buffalo  sledge)  costs  are  based  on\ndata collected during the visits to the subproject areas for the average costs charged\nby  the  operators  in  the  subproject  areas  multiplied  by  the  SCF  and  for  transport\ninvolving porters the costs are multiplied by the labor conversion factor.\n\n                                                    \n4 NEDA is currently reviewing the parameters it uses for economic analysis.\n5 For the economic analysis the costs of local government unit staff are assumed to be non incremental.\n\n\f(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n67\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nIn the absence of data from traffic surveys, the volume of agricultural freight generated\nby  each  road  without  the  project  is  based  on  data  provided  by  the  municipal  (or  city)\nagricultural  offices  concerning  the  following  parameters:  size  of  the  area  of  influence,\nthe  cropping  pattern,  average  yield  per  hectare,  use  of  inputs  per  hectare,  the\nproportion  of  crop  production  transported,  and  the  means  of  transport  used.  With  the\nproject,  some  increase  in  both  the  production  and  thus  the  quantity  transported  are\nprojected  as  a  result  of  the  road  improvements  and/or  construction.  Estimates  are\nbased  on  recent  experience  in  the  project  area  where  rural  roads  have  been\nconstructed.6  These  estimates  do  not  include  any  increased  production  that  might\nfollow from subsequent development programs (e.g., the provision of agricultural credit\nservices or processing facilities) for which the costs are at present unknown.\n\nStandard  DPWH  per  capita  data  are  used  to  calculate  the  volume  of  nonagricultural\nfreight transported and for the number of journeys made by people with and without the\nproject. These values depend upon the road conditions and the population in the area\nof  influence  and  are  adjusted  in  line  with  the  expected  growth  in  population  in  each\nsubproject area.\n\nFor each road the average length of journey has been estimated and used to calculate\nthe  total  volume  of  produce  shipped  measured  as  tons  per  kilometer.  The  length  of\njourney depends upon the location of the road in relation to the areas of production and\nmarkets.\n\nVOC savings for freight are based on the without project freight volumes, i.e., average\nsaving  per  tons  per  kilometer  multiplied  by  the  total  numbers  of  tons  per  kilometer\nshipped without the project.\n\n(vii) \n\nVOC  savings  for  passengers  are  calculated  similarly,  i.e.,  the  volume  of  passenger\ntraffic without the project multiplied by the average saving per passenger kilometers.\n\n(viii)  Generated benefits for both freight and passengers are equal to the area between the\ntransport  demand  curve  and  the  with  project  VOC  over  the  range  from  the  without-\nproject volume to the with-project volume. With a straight line demand curve, this area\nis  the  triangle  with  an  area  of  50  percent  of  the  incremental  volume  multiplied  by  the\nunit price reduction; this approximation is used to estimate generated benefits for both\npassenger and freight traffic.\n\nSite-specific  estimates  of  investment  costs,  including  physical  contingencies  and  the\ncosts of detailed design and supervision of construction have been prepared for each\nroad.  Investment  costs  have  been  converted  to  economic  values  by  excluding  taxes\nand  multiplying  the  local  cost  element  by  the  SCF.  Investment  is  expected  to  take\nplace over two years with maintenance costs starting in year three. Any without project\nmaintenance costs would be saved and are included as a benefit. Maintenance costs\nhave  been  estimated  by  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  engineers  at\nP87,000 to P95,000 per km.\n\n(x) \n\nIn the feasibility studies, key variables for which switching values have been calculated\nto  assess  the  sensitivity  of  the  economic  analysis  to  changes  in  the  assumptions  are\ninvestment and O&M costs, agricultural output, length of average journey, and savings\nin freight and passenger transport costs.\n\n                                                    \n6 Experience from Loan 1332-PHI: Rural Infrastructure Development Project, for $17.5 million, approved on 10 November\n1994, has shown that simple provision/improvement of rural roads (in areas with high agricultural potential) can result in a\n16 percent increase in rice production and a 35 percent increase in corn production, a major upland crop, after one year\nfollowing the construction of rural roads.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\n10. \nThe extent to which the savings in transport costs are passed on to the farmer and the extent\nto  which  farmers  are  encouraged  to  increase  production  and  or  switch  to  higher  value  crops  will\ndepend  upon  several  factors  including  the  types  of  crops  grown,  proximity  to  markets,  market\ndemand,  the  extent  to  which  traders  move  into  the  newly  accessible  areas,  and  the  degree  of\ncompetition between traders and haulers.\n\n11. \nThe approach of the financial analysis has been to assess the likely benefits to farmers based\non experience in the subproject areas and elsewhere in the project area where rural roads have been\nconstructed  in  the  absence  of  other  major  complementary  investments.  Incremental  income  is\nassumed to come from two sources: increased crop production and savings in transport costs. As for\nthe economic analysis, increases in crop production are based on a 16 percent increase for rice and\n35 percent for upland crops.7 For savings in transport costs the analysis uses data from the subproject\nareas  collected  during  visits  to  the  subproject  areas  and  from  elsewhere  in  the  project  area  where\nroads have recently been constructed.8 According to this data, where animal and human transport has\nbeen  replaced  with  motorized  transport  in  the  rice  growing  areas,  farmers  have  experienced  an  80\npercent reduction in transport costs for farm outputs and inputs. In the upland areas the figure is 50\npercent where animal transport is a major mode of transport.\n\n12. \nThe local government units (LGUs) would be responsible for the maintenance of the roads and\nwould  finance  these  costs  either  from  their  existing  revenues  or  from  road  user  charges  levied\nspecifically to cover the costs of maintaining project financed roads. An analysis of the impact of road\ninvestments on the financial situation of the individual LGU is in Supplementary Appendix A.\n\n2. \n\nCommunal Irrigation\n\nNew  and  improved  irrigation  systems  will  increase  rice  production  and  farm  incomes.  The\n13. \nanalysis uses the following information and general assumptions while the feasibility studies contain\nthe detailed cropping and yield assumptions for each irrigation scheme.\n\n(i)\n\n \n(ii) \n\nRice and fertilizers have been valued at their expected farm gate import parity prices in\n2010. Despite the recent increased production of rice, an analysis of expected demand\nand  supply  shows  that  with  a  4  percent  per  annum  increase  in  production,  current\nconsumption  levels  and  a  population  growth  rate  of  2.3  percent  per  annum,  the\nPhilippines will continue to be a net importer of rice for the foreseeable future. Similarly,\nfertilizers  will  continue  to  be  imported  as  there  are  substantial  imports,  nearly  $290\nmillion  in  1997,  and  the  Philippines  is  not  expected  to  become  self-sufficient  in  the\nforeseeable future.\n\nIrrigation development will be geared to rehabilitating existing gravity schemes that are\nno  longer  functional  or  extending  the  amount  of  land  irrigated  from  existing  water\nsources.  The  impact  of  irrigation  is  assessed  through  a  simple  model.  The  analysis\nassumes that without the project all the land, as at present, grows a rice crop in the wet\nseason  with  the  proportion  of  the  land  currently  being  cropped  with  rice  in  the  dry\nseason scheme-specific (0-50 percent). With the project, the water will be used for rice\ncultivation  in  both  the  wet  and  dry  seasons  and  yields  per  hectare  will  increase\nbecause  of  the  assured  supply  of  water.  The  without  project  yields  average  3,000-\n4,000  kg/ha  of  unhulled  rice  and  are  estimates  based  on  the  present  yields  in  the\nsubproject  areas  and  those  with  the  project  4,000-5,000  kg/ha  of  based  on  the\npotential  with  good  levels  of  water  management  and  agronomic  practice.9  Although\nsome other higher value crops may also be grown in the dry season the analysis, in the\nabsence of scheme specific proposals, makes no allowance for this assumption.\n\n                                                    \n7 See footnote 6.\n8 See footnote 6.\n9 Project preparatory technical assistance estimates together with those for other crop input/output data used to assess the\n\nlikely increase in production in areas benefiting from project-financed roads.\n\n\f \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n69\n\nAppendix 12, page 5\n\nThe model calculates the incremental impact per hectare of increasing the production\nof  rice  using  input-output  data  specific  to  each  subproject  area.  An  interest  rate  of  6\npercent  per  crop  is  assumed  to  finance  the  cost  of  purchased  inputs  (4-5  months).\nWithin the model, current financial output values and costs are converted to economic\nvalues using specific economic conversion factors based on the import parity prices for\nrice and fertilizers, the SCF, and the labor conversion factor. The conversion factor for\nrice  has  also  been  used  for  seed.  An  economic  conversion  factor  of  zero  has  been\nused for interest, which is a transfer payment and for the irrigation fee as the economic\ncosts of the latter are included in total as a project cost.\n\nSite-specific  estimates  of  investment  costs,  including  physical  contingencies  and  the\ncosts of detailed design and supervision of construction have been prepared for each\nscheme as part of the project preparatory technical assistance. Investment costs have\nbeen converted to economic values by excluding taxes and multiplying the nontraded\n(local cost) element by the SCF. Investment is expected to take place over two years\nwith  O&M  costs  starting  in  year  three.  As  the  existing  schemes  are  not  functioning\nthere are no without project O&M costs savings to be counted as a benefit.\n\nThe  investment  cost  for  irrigation  development  will  be  shared  between  the  national\nGovernment and the local government unit (LGU) with the IAs assuming responsibility\nfor the LGU loan element. The analysis assumes that the loan will finance 20 percent\nof  the  investment  cost  repayable  over  15  years  at  an  interest  rate  of  14  percent  but\nwith  no  grace  period  (i.e.,  similar  to  the  terms  of  the  Municipal  Development  Fund\nexcept  for  the  absence  of  a  grace  period).  However,  these  terms  and  conditions  are\nmuch  less  favorable  to  farmers  than  those  operating  under  the  present  policy  of  the\nNational  Irrigation  Administration,  where  the  repayment  period  is  set  at  50  years\n(interest free) and farmers pay a minimum of 75 kg10 of unhulled rice per hectare per\nyear to repay their loans.\n\nFollowing  the  existing  arrangements  for  community  irrigation  schemes  IAs  will  be\nresponsible for all O&M and financing the associated costs estimated at P510 per ha\nper year.11 The IA will charge farmers for the costs of O&M and include this cost in the\nservice  fee  which  will  also  cover  the  loan  repayments.  In  the  financial  analysis  of  the\nirrigation  components  of  the  subprojects  the  irrigation  fee  is  adjusted  on  a  case-by-\ncase basis so the IA always generates a financial surplus after repaying the loan.\n\n(vii) \n\nIn the feasibility studies, key variables for which switching values have been calculated\nto  assess  the  sensitivity  of  the  economic  analysis  to  changes  in  the  assumptions  are\ninvestment and O&M costs, rice price, with project dry season cropping intensity, and\nthe with project dry and wet season yields.\n\n(viii)  The average size of rice land holding and the incremental financial costs (per hectare),\nincluding  the  imputed  cost  of  family  labor  (and  returns),  determine  the  impact  of\nscheme  improvements  upon  the  average  household.  The  emphasis  is  on  the  with\nproject  returns  to  labor  and  the  incremental  returns  to  incremental  labor,  which  as  a\ngeneral rule should be at least 2-3 times the current unskilled wage rate, if participation\nis to provide farmers with an adequate incentive for the risks associated with the use of\nadditional inputs. The analysis shows the incremental income and the returns to labor\n\n                                                    \n10 Equivalent to P562.5 per ha per year at current prices or P28,125 per ha over 50 years assuming that no interest is paid.\n11 Source:  Western  Legaspi  Detailed  Feasibility  Study  undertaken  by  National  Irrigation  Administration  and  Japan\n\nInternational Cooperative Agency in 1996 with costs updated to 1999 levels using the gross national product deflator.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 12, page 6\n\nexpected with the higher yields and an increased dry season cropping intensity made\npossible by an assured supply of water in both the wet and dry seasons.\n\n3. \n\nPotable Water Supply\n\nFurther  benefits  will  accrue  from  time  savings  from  potable  water  supply  schemes  and\n14.\ndecreased  disease  and  sickness  from  improved  water  quality.  A  model  has  been  prepared  to\ncalculate  the  potential  economic  and  financial  returns  from  the  provision  of  a  potable  water  supply\nscheme.12  Use  of  this  model  requires  the  following  scheme  specific  information:  (i)  population  to  be\nserved, population growth rate, and average household size; (ii) estimates of the current use of water\nin  and  outside  the  home  and  the  volume  of  water  to  be  supplied  by  the  proposed  scheme;\n(iii) estimates of the time taken each day for water collection with and without the project; (iv) costs of\nwater  treatment  with  and  without  the  project;  (v)  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  with  and  without\nthe  project  and  the  associated  cost  of  treatment;  and  (vi)  estimates  of  the  investment  cost  and  the\nannual O&M costs.\n\n15. \nFor  the  economic  analysis  the  model  includes  as  costs:  scheme  investment  and  O&M,  with\nproject  water  collection,  and  health  costs.  As  benefits,  the  model  includes  the  without  project\ncollection and health costs, costs of water used outside the house, and value of the incremental water\nprovided  (the  average  of  the  with  and  without  financial  cost  per  cubic  meter).  For  the  financial\nanalysis,  the  model  uses  the  investment  and  O&M  costs  and  the  fees  collected  from  users  to\ncalculate the rate of return and to ensure that the users association have sufficient funds to operate\nand maintain the scheme.\n\nThe results of the analyses from the feasibility studies are summarized here and combined to\n\nD. \n\nResults of the Analyses\n\n16. \ncalculate the project\u2019s overall returns.\n\n1. \n\nRural Roads\n\n17. \n\nTable A12.1 shows the anticipated costs and returns from the rural roads components.\n\nTable A12.1: Summary of Costs and Returns- Rural Roads\n\nInvestment\nCosts/km\n(P \u2018000)\n\nLength\n(km)\n\nBeneficiary\nPopulation\n\nBenefiting\nArea\n(ha)\n\nEconomic\nReturn\n(percent)\n\nSite\n\nUpland Roads\n- Aloran\n- Bayugan\n- Calbayog\n- Dolores\n- Hinunangan\n- Jiabong\n- Kapalong\n- San Jose City\nLowland Roads\n- Aloran\n- Buyugan\n- Mainit\n\n         ha = hectare, km = kilometer.\n          Source: Staff estimates.\n\n1,309\n1,424\n3,209\n3,267\n1,201\n2,453\n   672\n1,421\n\n1,788\n1,892\n1,481\n\n   8.0\n   8.5\n14.0\n28.0\n12.2\n14.0\n20.0\n  7.3\n\n  5.0\n  3.5\n 5.5\n\n  1,411\n  1,187\n  6,605\n10,776\n  3,459\n  4,721\n  1,934\n  6,000\n\n  3,543\n  2,250\n  4,907\n\n1,629\n   615\n2,682\n7,156\n   952\n   779\n   763\n   925\n\n1,696\n1,440\n   883\n\n21\n30\n15\n21\n14\n15\n16\n16\n\n21\n30\n17\n\n                                                    \n12 The  model  follows  the  method  of  approach  described  in  the  Handbook for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply\n\nProjects, ADB, Economics and Development Resource Center, March, 1999.\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 12, page 7\n\n18. \nThe  results  show  a  wide  range  in  terms  of  the  cost  per  kilometer  and  the  other  basic\nparameters,  e.g.,  beneficiary  population  and  the  area  of  influence.  The  EIRRs  range  from  14-30\npercent and one road has a return of less than 15 percent. However, the returns from the Hinunangan\nroad  (14  percent)  do  not  include  any  benefits  for  diverted  traffic,  an  important  likely  benefit,  as  the\nroad will reduce costs for traffic traveling from the northern villages in Southern Leyte to Sogod and\nMaasin.  Similarly,  the  returns  from  the  Jiabong  road  are  understated,  as  this  route  will  reduce  the\ndistance  by  30  km  for  traffic  traveling  from  Eastern  Samar  to  Catbalogan  and  Calbayog  in  Western\nSamar. The absence of traffic counts prevented an estimate of these additional benefits from diverted\ntraffic. The lowland roads in Mainit provide access to rice growing areas and do not link communities.\nAs  a  result  the  analysis  has  not  included  any  benefits  from  nonagricultural  and  passenger  traffic.\nTable  A12.2  describes  the  key  variables  used  in  the  sensitivity  analysis  to  assess  the  effect  of\nchanges in the key variables.

Of the variables analyzed the results are most sensitive to\nthe assumption concerning the average length of journey, which in most instances is assumed to be\nhalf the length of the road. Length of journey is important because it affects both freight (agricultural\nand  nonagricultural)  and  passenger  travel  cost  savings.  Returns  are  less  sensitive  to  the  level  of\ninvestments costs and savings in transport costs.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 12, page 8\n\nTransport cost savings vary widely and depend upon the extent to which higher cost modes of\n21. \ntransport, i.e., animal and human transport, are replaced by lower cost motorized transport. Outside\nthe  largely  rice growing  areas,  the  largest  potential  savings  occur  in  Jiabong,  P146.57/tkm,  where\nmotorized  transport  (e.g.,  jeepneys)  will  replace  water  buffalo  sledges  and  the  lowest  in  Dolores,\nP13.33/tkm, where road transport will replace the canoes. Savings in the range P13-19/tkm (San Jose\nand Hinunangan) will mostly come from reduced VOCs following road improvements rather than from\nmajor  changes  to  the  modes  of  transport.  Higher  savings  P174-202/tkm,  e.g.,  Aloran  and  Bayugan\nlowland roads and Mainit, reflect situations where at present some human transport is used to carry\nsacks of unhulled rice.\n\n22. \nFinally,  returns  are  least  sensitive  to  the  costs  of  maintenance  or  to  the  assumptions\nconcerning the existing level of agricultural output without the project. The latter reflects the fact that\nvolumes  of  nonagricultural  freight  and  passenger  traffic  (except  in  Mainit)  provide  important\ncontributions to the savings  in  transport costs from the without project scenario and from generated\nvolumes of traffic.\n\n23.      In financial terms, farming households in the areas benefiting from the provision of improved\naccess would expect to earn higher incomes as a result of reduced costs of transport and increased\ncrop production. The estimates are based on experience from the subproject areas.\n\nTable A12.4: Financial Analysis- Rural Roads\n\nFarm Size\n(hectare)\n\nTransport\nCost Savings\n(P)\n\nIncremental\nCrop Income\n(P)\n\nTotal\nIncremental\nIncome (P)\n\nIncrease\n(percent)\n\n6.6\n\n3.4\n\n2.9\n\n4.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.0\n\n1.8\n\n1.5\n\n3.2\n\n4.3\n\n0.8\n\n4,215\n\n8,949\n\n   682\n\n   534\n\n   343\n\n1,121\n\n1,557\n\n  139\n\n1,189\n\n2,362\n\n1,428\n\n17,092\n\n 7,059\n\n 7,512\n\n 9,520\n\n 3,601\n\n 3,590\n\n 4,767\n\n 3,623\n\n 5,293\n\n 6,879\n\n 2,363\n\n21,312\n\n 16,008\n\n   8,194\n\n 10,054\n\n  3,943\n\n  4,711\n\n 6,323\n\n  3,761\n\n 6,482\n\n 9,241\n\n 3,790\n\n31\n\n45\n\n27\n\n17\n\n27\n\n46\n\n33\n\n16\n\n20\n\n20\n\n24\n\n Site\n\nUpland Roads\n\n- Aloran\n\n- Bayugan\n\n- Calbayog\n\n- Dolores\n\n- Hinunangan\n\n- Jiabong\n\n- Kapalong\n\n- San Jose City\n\nLowland Roads\n\n- Aloran\n\n- Buyugan\n\n- Mainit\n\n   \n\n Source: Staff estimates.\n\nSavings in transport costs are highest where motorized transport replaces human and animal\n24. \ntransport.

In  the  case  of  the  Libuganon  scheme  the  cost  of  the  associated  access  road  leads  to  higher\ncosts. All schemes give returns to labor in excess of twice the unskilled labor rate even if the rice price\ndeclines  in  line  with  expected  future  world  market  prices.  Average  costs  per  hectare,  including\nirrigation  fees,  are  low  and  incremental  incomes  from  rice  production  high.  To  ensure  that  the  IAs\nhave a positive cash flow when repaying the loans and at the same time can cover the O&M costs the\nfees required would range from a low of 50 kg/ha of unhulled rice per annum in Mat-i and Anomar,\nwhere  the  city  would  finance  the  30  percent  of  investment  costs  not  financed  by  the  national\nGovernment,  all  to  a  high  of  750  kg/ha  at  Bunawen  and  Libuganon.  Both  figures  are  based  on  a\npresent price of P7.5/kg.\n\n27. \nThe  calculation  of  switching  values  (Table  A12.6)  shows  that  the  economic  returns  from\nirrigation  investments,  with  the  exception  of  Libuganon  and  Bunawen,  are  insensitive  to  changes  in\nkey variables. However, if the future rice price is the equivalent of the bottom value of the 70 percent\nprobability range indicated by the World Bank estimates, the viability of irrigation development would\nbe seriously undermined, with only Aloran, Bayugan, Anomar, and Mat-i remaining marginally viable.\nScheme  implementation  should  consider  crop  diversification  as  one  way  of  reducing  the  risks\nassociated with possible long-term reductions in rice prices.\n\nTable A12.6: Irrigation Schemes- Sensitivity Analysis\n(percent)\n\nInvestment\nCosts\n+172\n+163\n\nOperation and\nMaintenance\nCosts\n+2,054\n+2,068\n\nCropping\nIntensity\nDry Season\n-69\n-63\n\nWet\nSeason\nYield\n-38\n-37\n\nDry\nSeason\nYield\n-36\n-37\n\n   +14\n+112\n    +5\n  +44\n+126\n\n+270\n+411\n\n   +521\n+2,288\n   +188\n+1,269\n+1,794\n\n+2,853\n+2,808\n\n-16\n-70\n  -6\n-44\n-60\n\n-98\n-96\n\n-9\n-41\n-3\n-25\n-34\n\n-56\n-55\n\n-9\n-40\n-3\n-23\n-32\n\n-51\n-50\n\nRice\nPrice\n-39\n-41\n\n -4\n-19\n -3\n-19\n-35\n\n-49\n-57\n\nSite\n\nAloran\nBayugan\nKapalong\n- Libuganon\n- Semong\n- Bunawen\nMainit\nSan Jose City\nSurigao City\n - Anomar\n - Mat-i\n\n   Source: Staff estimates.\n   \n                                                    \n13 Costs include rural access roads for Libuganon and Semong.\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 12, page 10\n\n3. \n\nCore Subprojects\n\n28. \nTable A12.7 summarizes the returns from the 10 core subprojects.

Where  components  are  linked,  as  occurs  with  the  rehabilitation  of  the  Kapalong  irrigation\nschemes  and  construction  of  access  roads,  the  associated  components  should  be  analyzed  as  a\nsingle entity. Taken together the roads have a rate of return of 19 percent and a net present value at\n15 percent of P30.1 million, while the corresponding values for irrigation are 34 percent and P147.2\nmillion.\n\nTable A12.7: Subproject Summary\n\nInvestment\nCosts\n(P \u2018000)\n\nEconomic Internal\nRate of Return\n(percent)\n\nSite\n\n Aloran\n Bayugan\n Calbayog\n Dolores\n Hinunangan\n Jiabong\n Kapalong\n Mainit\n San Jose City\n Surigao City\n\n44.178\n37.695\n42.403\n91.470\n14.649\n34.349\n48.429\n18.134\n84.195\n16.631\n\n32\n33\n15\n21\n14\n15\n20\n20\n31\n59\n\n    \n\n   Source: Staff estimates.\n\n4. \n\nProject and Distribution Analysis\n\nOn the assumption that the results of the core subprojects represent the potential returns from\n29. \nall  project  investments  and  including  all  the  costs  associated  with  capacity  building  and  institutional\nstrengthening and project management and coordination, the Project has an overall rate of return of\n18  percent  and  net  present  values,  discounted  at  12  percent  and  15  percent,  of  P400  million  and\nP1,069  million  respectively.  Additional  analyses  were  prepared  using:  (i)  0.83  as  the  SCF,  i.e.,  the\nvalue  implied  by  the  NEDA  value  for  the  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.2;  (ii)  a  30  percent\ndepreciation in the value of the peso. Table A12.8 contains the results of these analyses, which show\nthat (i)  the rate of return would increase if the peso depreciates against the dollar, mainly because a\ndevaluation would increase the import parity price of rice; and (ii) the use of SCF implied by the NEDA\nshadow exchange rate factor would increase the rate of return by 1 percent.\n\nTable A12.8: Project Returns\n(P million)\n\nStandard Conversion Factor\n\n__________0.91__________\n\n________0.83___________\n\n Exchange Rate P/$\n\n     45.0\n\n     58.5\n\nEIRR\n (percent)\n\n18\n\n22\n\nNPV\nat 12%\n\n1,069\n\n2,004\n\n400\n\n1,070\n\nNPV\nat 15%\n\nEIRR\n (percent)\n\nNPV\nat 12%\n\n1,248\n\n2,183\n\nNPV\nat 15%\n\n545\n\n1,215\n\n19\n\n23\n\n           EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value.\n           Source: Staff estimates.\n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 12, page 11\n\n30. \n  The Project is an infrastructure project and as such the majority of the costs are incurred by\nthe public sector and the benefits earned by the private sector.

A triangular distribution was assumed for key variables around the mean used\nin the analysis described above with minimum and maximum 5-20 percent below or above the mean\nvalues,  depending  on  the  perceived  uncertainty  concerning  each  variable.  The  program  using\nsimulation  techniques  recalculates  the  road  and  irrigation  spreadsheets  included  in  the  feasibility\nstudies 100 or more times and presents the results.\n\nThe  results  of  the  data  for  two  simulations  show  a  narrow  variation  in  the  returns  from  the\n32. \nroads investment with minimum values of 15 percent and a maximum of 21-22 percent. The mean is\nnearly  19  percent  and  the  modal  values  18-19  percent.  The  results  for  irrigation  show  a  wider\nvariation with minimum values of 26-27 percent and maximum values of 42-44 percent. The mean is\n34 percent and the mode 33 percent.\n\n                                                    \n14 This  analysis  does  not,  however,  distinguish  the  allocation  of  benefits  between  the  nonpoor  and  poor  in  each  of  the\ngroups. Appendix 11 presents a poverty impact analysis that differentiates the accrual of benefits between the poor and\nnonpoor.  A  comparison  of  these  two  analyses  highlights  the  fact  that  while  the  irrigation  subcomponent  (essentially  a\nprivate good) may generate a greater total benefit, it is spread across a smaller number of beneficiaries. Thus, the rural\nroad subcomponent (a public good) will have a greater impact on poverty reduction.\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 2 October 2000)\n", "Currency Unit\nP=1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013\n=\n=\n", "Peso (P=)\n0.0217\nP=46.10\n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The  foreign  exchange  rate  of  the  peso  is  determined  on  the  basis  of  a  floating  rate\nsystem related to daily foreign currency transactions of the banking sector.\n", "For the purpose of calculations in this report, an exchange rate of P=45.00 to $1.00, the\nrate prevailing during appraisal, has been used.\n", "ADB\nAFMA\nAFMP\nAFSPIP\nARCDP\nARMM\nBLGF\nCIP\nCIS\nCOA\nDA\nDBM\nDENR\nDILG\nDOF\nDPWH\nEIA\nEIRR\nEIS\nGIS-MIS\nha\nHDI\nHIID\nIA\nIEE\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "ABBREVIATIONS\n", "Asian Development Bank\nAgriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act\nAgriculture and Fisheries Modernization Plan\nAgriculture and Fisheries Sector Public Investment Program\nAgrarian Reform Communities Development Project\nAutonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao\nBureau of Local Government Finance\ncommunal irrigation project\ncommunal irrigation system\nCommission on Audit\nDepartment of Agriculture\nDepartment of Budget and Management\nDepartment of Environment and Natural Resources\nDepartment of Interior and Local Government\nDepartment of Finance\nDepartment of Public Works and Highways\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment\neconomic internal rate of return\nenvironmental impact statement\ngeographic information system and management information system\nhectare\nhuman development index\nHarvard Institute for International Development\nirrigators\u2019 association\ninitial environmental examination\n", "NOTES\n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government ends on 31 December.\n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars.\n", "ILO\nIRAP\nITCAF\nJFPR\nkm\nkm2\nLGC \nLGU\nMDF\nMDFO\nM&E\nMOA \nMTPDP\nNEDA\nNGA\nNGO\nNIA\nNIS\nNIN\nOCC\nO&M\nPCU\nPGB\nPMC\nPO\nRA\nRFU\nRTC\nSCF\nSLPSP\nSPMB\nTA\nVOC\nVWSA\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "International Labour Organization\nIntegrated Rural Accessibility Planning\nInformation Technology Center for Agriculture and Fisheries\nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction\nkilometer\nsquare kilometer\nLocal Government Code\nlocal government unit\nmunicipal development fund\nMunicipal Development Fund Office\nmonitoring and evaluation\nmemorandum of agreement\nMedium Term Philippine Development Plan\nNational Economic and Development Authority\nnational government agency\nnongovernment organization\nNational Irrigation Administration\nnational irrigation system\nNational Information Network\nopportunity cost of capital\noperations and maintenance\nproject coordination unit\nPolicy Governing Board\nproject management committee\nproject office\nRepublic Act\nregional field unit\nregional technical committee\nstandard conversion factor\nSustainable Livelihood for the Poor in Southern Philippines\nsubproject monitoring board\ntechnical assistance\nvehicle operating cost\nVillage Waterworks and Sanitation Association\n"]}
