The Project will be\ndriven  by  the  needs  and  demands  of  communities  that  lack  the\ninfrastructure essential for them to realize the productive potential of their\nland.  Proposals  emanating  from  local  government  units  (LGUs)  for\nsubprojects  that  meet  feasibility  criteria  will  be  eligible  for  Project\nfinancing.  Using  fully  decentralized  implementation  arrangements,  the\nProject  will  also  advance  the  decentralization  of  rural  infrastructure\nplanning and management.\nClassification Primary\u2014economic growth\nSecondary\u2014poverty reduction\nEnvironment Category B. An initial environmental examination was undertaken and the\nAssessment summary is a supplementary appendix.\nRationale Most of the rural poor are engaged in subsistence agriculture and are\nconcentrated in the eastern-central and southern Philippines, particularly\nin the Bicol region, eastern Visayas, the Autonomous Region of Muslim\nMindanao (ARMM), and central Mindanao. In these areas, poverty is\ncaused and sustained by inadequate agricultural and rural development.\nThe Government\u2019s Medium Term Philippine Development Plan for 1999\nto 2004 and the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act of 1997\nemphasize  the  importance  of  mechanisms  for  the  realization  of\nagricultural production potential and the creation of viable employment\nand income opportunities in rural areas, particularly in the southern part\nof the country. Inadequate rural infrastructure stands out as a principal\ncause of constraints that poor farmers face in becoming more productive\nand profitable. A chief constraint is the difficulty and cost of hauling inputs\nto  farms  and  outputs  to  markets  caused  by  the  lack  of  access\ninfrastructure. The Project aims to remove these constraints.\nObjectives and The  long-term  development  goal  is  to  increase  rural  incomes  with\nScope distributional  gains  favoring  the  poor  in  areas  with  high  agricultural\npotential. The immediate objectives of the Project are to (i) remove the\nconstraints to the improvement of agricultural productivity caused by the\nlack or inadequacy of rural infrastructure, and (ii) reduce rural poverty by\nincreasing agricultural productivity and profitability. The Project will have\nthree components: (i) improved rural infrastructure, (ii) capacity building\nfor devolved project implementation and management, and (iii) project\nmanagement and coordination.\nCost Estimates The  estimated  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  $150.0  million  equivalent,\ncomprising about $44.4 million in foreign exchange costs and $105.6\nmillion in local currency equivalent costs.", "iii\nFinancing Plan ($ million)\nForeign Local\nSource Exchange Currency Total Percent\nAsian Development Bank 44.3 30.7 75.0 50.0\nGovernment 0.0 37.2 37.2 24.8\nLocal Government Units 0.0 28.3 28.3 18.4\nBeneficiaries 0.0 8.5 8.5 5.6\nInternational Labour Organization 0.1 0.9 1.0 1.1\nTotal 44.4 105.6 150.0 100.0\nLoan Amount and A loan of $75 million from the ordinary capital resources of the Asian\nTerms Development Bank (ADB) with interest to be determined in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans,\nwith a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 7 years, a front-end\nfee of 1 percent of the loan amount, and an annual commitment charge\nof 0.75 percent.\nAllocation and Most of the proceeds of the ADB loan are for financing rural infrastructure\nRelending Terms and will be channeled to LGUs through the Municipal Development Fund\nOffice, managed by the Department of Finance. For a loan to an LGU,\nthe onlending terms will be those prevailing for the fund, which at present\ninclude an amortization period of 15 years, a grace period of 3 years, and\na 14 percent interest rate.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2008\nExecuting Agency Department of Agriculture (DA)\nImplementation As  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project,  DA  will  be  responsible  for\nArrangements overall coordination and management of the Project through a project\nmanagement committee and a project coordination unit in the Office of\nthe Secretary. DA will implement the components for capacity building for\ndevolved  project  implementation  and  management,  and  project\nmanagement and coordination. LGUs (municipal, city, and provincial) will\nimplement the improved rural infrastructure component. Day-to-day tasks\nfor  project  management  and  technical  assistance  to  the  participating\nLGUs will be provided by a project office, contracted to the private sector.\nProcurement Goods and services for the Project will be procured in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Major equipment will be procured by\ninternational  shopping,  and  office  furniture  and  equipment  by  local\ncompetitive bidding. Civil works will be contracted using local competitive\nbidding procedures.\nConsulting Services A total of about 243 person-months of specialized services from short-\nterm  domestic  consultants  and  about  42  person-years  of  long-term\ndomestic and international consultants are required for the duration of the\nProject. Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements", "iv\nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants.\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date 31 December 2007\nProject Benefits The Project will benefit farm (and nonfarm) households in approximately\nand Beneficiaries 100 municipalities in the southern Philippines. Beneficiaries from rural\nroads will experience savings in costs and increased production that\ntogether  will  increase  average  annual  household  incomes  from  crop\nproduction by $94 to $553. Annual incomes from crop production for\nfarmers with irrigated holdings will be expected to increase by 82 to 215\npercent following investment in irrigation facilities. The analysis of 10 core\nsubprojects indicates that the Project will directly benefit some 700,000\npeople  (50  percent  of  which  are  poor)  and  indirectly  benefit  another\n160,000 people (47 percent of which are poor). By project completion, at\nleast 93,000 people should be lifted out of poverty. Approximately 1,000\nperson-years of incremental employment will be generated, 57 percent of\nwhich  will  benefit  the  poor.  However,  only  about  0.4  percent  of  the\npoverty-reduction impact can be attributed to the income generated from\nconstruction or maintenance of the infrastructure, while the remaining\n99.6 percent is due to its usage. On a subsectoral basis, 67 percent of\nthe long-term poverty-reduction impact is due to access infrastructure, 19\npercent due to irrigation, and 14 percent due to potable water supply.\nThe  overall  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  18  percent.\nNonquantifiable benefits are expected to flow from investments in roads\nand  potable  water  supply.

INTRODUCTION\n2.  In  response  to  a  request  from  the  Government,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\nprovided a technical assistance (TA) to the Department of Agriculture (DA) to formulate a project to\naddress the needs of farmers and the rural poor through the provision of rural infrastructure.1 The\nTA was approved by ADB in May 1999 and was conducted from the end of August 1999 to\nmid-February 2000. Ten representative core subprojects in nine provinces were selected, and\nstudies were conducted as the basis for preparing a sector loan project. A loan fact-finding mission\nwas conducted from 17 February to 28 March 2000 and an appraisal mission from 31 July to 25\nAugust  2000.2  During  project  formulation,  comprehensive  beneficiary  and  stakeholder\nconsultations  took  place.  During  ADB  missions,  consultations  were  undertaken  with  national\ngovernment agencies (NGAs), local government units (LGUs), potential beneficiaries, peoples\u2019\norganizations, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and other funding agencies active in the\nrural  sector.  This  report  is  based  on  the  findings  of  these  missions,  the  reports  of  the  TA\nconsultants, and the discussions held with major stakeholders. The project framework is attached\nas Appendix 1.\nII I.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  Poverty in the Rural Sector\n3.  Nearly 20 million people in the rural Philippines are poor. Poverty in the country is primarily\nrural-based and is caused and sustained by weak rural and agricultural development. In 1997, the\nlast year for which poverty data are available, 44.4 percent of all rural households (equivalent to\n51.2 percent of the rural population) were living below the poverty line, compared to 18.5 percent in\nurban areas and 32.1 percent for the country as a whole.3 The incidence of rural poverty based on\nheadcount data increased between 1994 and 1997, while it fell in the urban areas.4\n4.  Most of the rural poor are engaged in subsistence agriculture. They are concentrated in the\neastern-central and southern Philippines, particularly in the Bicol region, the eastern Visayas, the\nAutonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), and central Mindanao. Given the magnitude of\nrural poverty, any sustainable growth strategy for the Philippines needs to emphasize pro-poor\nmechanisms for the realization of agricultural production potentials and the creation of viable\nemployment  and  income  opportunities  in  rural  areas,  particularly  in  the  southern  part  of  the\ncountry.\n5.  Republic Act 8425 (RA 8425) of 1997, the Social Reform and Poverty Alleviation Act\nprovides the overall policy framework for the Government\u2019s poverty-reduction strategy. While RA\n8425 gives responsibility for policy oversight to the National Anti-Poverty Commission, all NGAs,\n                                                \n1 TA 3194-PHI: Infrastructure for Rural Productivity Enhancement Sector Project, for $800,000, approved on 15 May\n1999.\n2  The  Mission  comprised  S.  Groff,  Mission  Leader-Project  Economist;  N.  Ogawa,  Programs  Officer;  A.  Bauer,\nSocioeconomist (Poverty Reduction); V. You, Counsel; S. Wendt, Social Development Specialist; K. Yamauchi,\nEnvironment Specialist, and L. Adriano, Staff Consultant-Poverty Reduction Specialist.\n3  ADB. 2000. Philippines: Country Assistance Plan, Programs Department (East). It should be noted, however, that\nthese figures differ from international data based on the $1 per day per capita expenditure on consumption. In its\nPhilippines Poverty Assessment (Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Unit, East Asia and Pacific Region,\nWorld Bank, 24 May 2000, Washington DC.), the World Bank estimates that the incidence of consumption poverty\nincreased from 24.7 percent in 1997 to 26.3 percent in 1999. This increase was due to the Asian financial crisis and\nthe El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a phenomena.\n4  Rural poor families in 1997 accounted for 72.6 percent of the total poor, compared to 66.4 percent in 1994.", "2\nparticularly those involved in rural development, are tasked with implementing poverty reduction\nprograms. The National Anti-Poverty Commission has recently released the National Anti-Poverty\nAgenda, which states that rural development and participatory governance are fundamental to\npoverty reduction and to the Government\u2019s Medium Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP)\nfor 1999 to 2004, which has a goal of reducing poverty incidence to between 25 and 28 percent by\nthe year 2004. For farmers, farmworkers, and landless rural workers, the National Anti-Poverty\nAgenda states that improvements in quality of life require security of land tenure; ownership of,\naccess to, and control of arable lands by the tiller; higher productivity and fair prices for their\nproduce; and sustainability and profitability of agriculture. The project objectives are consistent with\nand support the Government\u2019s objectives and approaches to poverty reduction.\n2.  Agriculture\n6.  Agriculture is the dominant sector in the economy of the Philippines. It contributes 20\npercent of gross domestic product and more than 20 percent of total export earnings, and provides\n36 percent of the labor force. About half of the population is rural, two thirds of which depends on\nagriculture for a living, and the majority of the country\u2019s poor live from subsistence agriculture and\nfisheries. The sector has grown slowly and unsteadily since the early 1980s, and at an annual\naverage rate of 1.6 percent between 1995 and 1999. Low productivity, partly due to the absence of\nan adequate policy framework and institutional arrangements to resolve the highly distorted price\nincentive system (e.g., food price support and consumer subsidies), continues to beset the sector.5\nThe instability of growth is mainly due to (i) the downward trend in export prices of traditional export\ncrops, (ii) continuous deterioration of intersectoral trade, (iii) macroeconomic constraints, (iv) a\nseries of natural calamities, (v) lack of internal markets, and (vi) high transport costs.\n7.  Agriculture's share of public investment averaged less than 13 percent between 1993 and\n1997, compared to 69 percent for large-scale infrastructure. Although the Government's investment\nin agriculture and rural infrastructure began to increase in 1995, primarily to support the adjustment\nmeasures  for  the  country's  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization,  it  continues  to  be\ninadequate. This has restricted the growth of the agriculture sector, compared to the industry and\nservices sectors, and consequently slowed the pace of development in rural areas.\n8.  The Government intends to develop the agriculture sector to achieve food security and be\ncompetitive in the international market, in anticipation of the full implementation by 2004 of the\nprovisions of the Uruguay Round agreements on tariffs and trade agreed with the World Trade\nOrganization. The investments required to finance rural infrastructure and make agriculture globally\ncompetitive are beyond the Government's internal resources. Under the Philippine Medium Term\nPublic Investment Program formulated in line with MTPDP, the financial requirements for rural\nroads and irrigation, two of the most important investments to increase productivity, amount to\n$2.56 billion or P115 billion (para. 26). Based on DA\u2019s budget over the past five years, the\nGovernment can provide only about 50 percent of this investment. The majority of the balance will\nhave to be funded externally through official development assistance, as there are few incentives\nfor private sector investment in rural infrastructure.\n3.  Rural Infrastructure\n9.  A  primary  reason  for  the  poor  productivity  (and  low  profitability)  of  agriculture  is  the\ninadequacy of rural infrastructure, particularly rural roads6 and irrigation. The quality and density of\nrural roads make a significant difference in the cost of inputs, the quality and value of outputs, and\nthe provision of social services, as well as being an impediment to private sector investment. About\nhalf of the villages in the country lack all-weather access to the provincial and national road\nnetworks. Moreover, the majority of the existing village roads are in such a poor condition that they\n                                                \n5  Loans 1739/1740-PHI: Grains Sector Development Program, for $175 million, approved on 24 April 2000, address\nsome of these constraints.\n6  In this report, rural roads are defined as roads that provide access between agricultural production areas and an\nexisting national or provincial road. Most of these are either village or municipal roads.", "3\ncan no longer be maintained without substantial investment in rehabilitation. In a World Bank report\non rural poverty,7 it was estimated that the provision of all-weather rural roads could reduce the\ncosts of marketing agriculture products by 15-20 percent.  Productivity is further constrained by the\nfact that only about 43 percent of potentially irrigable land is irrigated and 30 percent of the rural\npopulation lack access to safe drinking water.\n10.  The inadequacy of rural access infrastructure, together with low rates of growth in the\nagriculture sector, has limited the growth of profitable farm and nonfarm activities. Consequently,\nopportunities for productive employment in rural areas have not materialized and the incidence of\nrural poverty has increased. A 1998 survey on the Government\u2019s safety net programs under the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade8 indicated that farmers rank rural roads and irrigation as\ntwo of the most important investments required to improve the agriculture sector and reduce rural\npoverty. In spite of this, the Government and (since the Local Government Code [LGC] of 1991)\nLGU  investments  in  rural  infrastructure  are  relatively  low.  Historically,  the  largest  share  of\nGovernment investment in rural infrastructure has concentrated in a few provinces in Luzon. The\nProject, through decentralized investment in rural infrastructure in the southern Philippines, is\ndesigned to increase agricultural productivity with consequent increases in rural incomes.\n4.  Local Government\n11.  The LGC introduced major changes in the governance structure of the Philippines, offering\nnew opportunities for more area-focused and integrated participatory development. Under the\nLGC, LGUs are charged with a series of devolved functions relevant to the Project, such as\n(i) construction and maintenance of municipal roads and bridges, small landing facilities, and fish\nports; (ii) construction of communal irrigation and small water impoundment schemes, intervillage\nirrigation, dikes, and drainage; and (iii) wells and spring development, water supply, and sanitation\nprojects. The LGC also charges the LGU with responsibility for community-based infrastructure\nrehabilitation programs and for repair and maintenance of LGU infrastructure facilities.\n12.  It is widely recognized that decentralization has been a success in the Philippines and has\nprovided the opportunity for making development better, more democratic and participatory, more\nfocused on the needs of the poor, and more sustainable. As a result of decentralization, basic\nservices delivery is becoming more integrated, more focused on local priorities, and more efficient\nand cost effective. LGUs are interested in providing more investment and maintenance support for\nprojects they themselves identify, construct, and own. While devolution moves project identification\nand implementation closer to beneficiaries, it also introduces new challenges, particularly with\nregard to LGU commitment and capability. LGUs are, however, in the best position to ensure that\nsubprojects are located and designed most appropriately and involve the beneficiaries themselves\nin the identification, development, and operation of the facilities. Experience has clearly shown that\na centralized national government cannot effectively carry out these functions in rural areas.\n13.  Although LGUs have been given many key responsibilities, capital expenditures at this level\nare low due to a lack of financial resources. The results of a recent empirical study reveal that\nLGUs, in general, underspent on health, social welfare, and agricultural services relative to levels\nprevailing before devolution.9 Since 1994, spending levels are at par with 1991 levels in real terms\nper capita. Among the economic sectors, agriculture suffered most, with spending lower than 1991\nlevels in both 1993 and 1994. To balance underfinanced LGUs, the Government provides grants to\n                                                \n7  World Bank. 1996.

The Southern Philippines\n14.  The  project  area  comprises  the  southern  Philippines  and  is  defined  as  Bicol,  eastern\nVisayas, Mindanao, and the island provinces of Region IV.11 Subprojects will be located in areas\ntraditionally neglected by infrastructure investment, where the incidence of poverty is relatively\nhigh, and where agricultural growth potential is visible. Under the sector approach taken by the\nProject, individual LGUs will have to satisfy eligibility criteria to be included in the Project.\n15.  Three factors influenced the selection of regions to be included in the Project: (i) agricultural\npotential,  (ii)  historic  inequity  in  the  distribution  of  investment  in  rural  infrastructure,  and\n(iii) socioeconomic development and poverty characteristics.\n16.  Mindanao has a comparative advantage in agriculture over most of the rest of the country.\nBecause of its topography and typhoon-free climate, a wide range of annual and perennial crops\ncan  be  cultivated,  including  temperate  vegetables  at  higher  elevations.  Not  only  large-scale\nagricultural  producers,  plantation  owners,  and  international  corporations,  but  also  small-  and\nmedium-scale producers and cooperatives, have established links with export markets for farm\nproduce. Region IV\u2019s Occidental Mindoro, Oriental Mindoro, Marinduque, and Romblon provinces\nare noted for their agricultural and fishery potential. With their proximity to Metro Manila, they have\na higher degree of agri-industrialization than the Project\u2019s other regions outside Mindanao. Eastern\nVisayas ranks second (after Region IV) in the area of available land classified by the Bureau of\nSoils and Water Management as in the wet agroclimatic zone. In this zone, annual rainfall is\ngreater than 2,500 millimeters; hence the zone can readily grow two crops a year. The lower cost\nof land and labor, compared with most of Luzon, constitute another agricultural advantage in the\nproject area. Real agricultural wage rates for plantation and nonplantation agriculture in Luzon are\n4.3 percent and 10.3 percent higher respectively than in the southern Philippines. Thus, the\nopportunities for special labor-dependent crops, such as pineapple, banana, and mango, whose\nproduction is managed by private corporations, abound in the southern part of the country.\n17.  The southern Philippines, and especially Mindanao, has received a disproportionately low\nshare of public investment in infrastructure with some 70 percent of the annual national budget\nspent in Luzon. The area of the country outside of Luzon, with 72 percent of the total population\nand 80 percent of the rural population, receives only about 30 percent of the annual national\nbudget.12 Consequently, the southern Philippines has less well-developed rural infrastructure than\nthe other island groups. For example, only 28.2 percent of Mindanao\u2019s cultivated land is irrigated,\ncompared with nearly 44 percent in the Visayas and 49 percent in Luzon; and only 32.1 percent of\nhouseholds in Mindanao have access to community water systems and faucets, compared with\nnearly 35.5 percent in Visayas and 39 percent in Luzon.\n18.  The regions selected are genuinely poor in both absolute terms and in relation to the\nPhilippines as a whole. In summary, the project provinces (i) have a higher incidence of poor\nfamilies than average (in the ARMM, almost two thirds of the population are below the threshold);\n(ii) fall well below the national average index for income per person and show a high incidence of\nsevere poverty; (iii) have lower population densities than average, corresponding to their relatively\n                                                \n10 Municipal and city LGUs in the country are classified based on revenue-generating capacity and their internal revenue\nallotment share. These classifications range from I to VI, with the poorest municipal LGUs classified as VI and the\nrichest classified as I. Provincial LGUs are similarly classified with a range of I to IV.\n11The Project covers 779 municipalities and chartered cities in 40 provinces of the southern Philippines, including:\n(i) Mindanao: Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, Basilan, Bukidnon, Camiguin, Compostela, Davao del Norte, Davao\ndel Sur, Davao Oriental, Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Misamis Occidental, Misamis Oriental, North\nCotabato,  Sarangani,  South  Cotabato,  Sultan  Kudarat,  Sulu,  Surigao  del  Norte,  Surigao  del  Sur,  Tawi-Tawi,\nZamboanga del Norte, and Zamboanga del Sur; (ii) eastern Visayas: Biliran, Eastern Samar, Leyte, Northern Samar,\nSouthern Leyte, and Western Samar; and (iii) Bicol and Region IV: Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur,\nCatanduanes, Masbate, Marinduque, Mindoro Occidental, Mindoro Oriental, Romblon, and Sorsogon.\n12STS: PHI: 28-98: Country Operational Strategy Study, Philippines, May 1998.", "5\nlow level of urbanization and high dependence on agriculture; and (iv) have a human development\nindex value at least 10 percent below the national average.\n1.  Rural Productivity in the Southern Philippines\n19.  The returns to the factors of production, land, labor, and capital, of farming in the project\nregions are well below their potential. Stakeholders at participatory workshops held in 23 provinces\nduring project formulation cited many constraints as responsible for these poor returns, including\n(i) high costs of transporting farm inputs to farms and products to markets, (ii) low prices for\nmarketed products, (iii) lack of irrigation facilities on some irrigable land, (iv) high cost of crop\ninputs and insufficient capital with which to finance their purchase, (v) high post-harvest losses,\n(vi) a  low  level  of  technology  linked  with  a  poorly-functioning  agricultural  extension  service,\n(vii) tenant farmers\u2019 lack of collateral that could be provided against credit for the purchase of\ninputs, (viii) an average size of holding that precludes economies of scale and the efficient use of\nfarm machinery, (ix) poor health of some farmers and their families, and (x) time spent in fetching\nand carrying water. Many of these constraints can be directly or indirectly ascribed to the absence\nof adequate rural infrastructure.\n2.  Rural Infrastructure in the Southern Philippines\n20.  The selected project regions are among the more depressed in the country and have an\ninadequate stock of the basic infrastructure needed to increase productivity and alleviate poverty.\nMuch  of  the  existing  economic  and  social  infrastructure  is  in  a  bad  state  of  repair  due  to\nsubstandard workmanship and materials used in construction, poor maintenance, and in some\ncases, sheer age, and will require substantial rehabilitation.\n21.  The total road network, consisting of national, city, provincial, municipal, and village roads,\nof the project area is 75,778 kilometers (km). This accounts for 47 percent of the Philippines\u2019 total\nroad network.13 The average road density is 0.49 km/square kilometer (km2) of land area, lower\nthan the national average of 0.54 km/km2, with Western Samar having as little as 0.16 km/km2. Of\nthe 160,970 km of road in the Philippines, only 26,950 km, or 17 percent is paved. Of the\n134,220 km of unpaved road, 125,704 km is graveled and 8,416 km is earthen. Some roads were\nformer logging roads and were constructed with weak surfaces and no proper base or drainage\nfacilities. Many of the roads constructed earlier by the Government now need to be upgraded.\n22.  In May 1999, the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) estimated the potential irrigable\narea of the Philippines to be 3.13 million hectares (ha). The total area developed in 10,883\nschemes  comprises  1.34  million  ha,  representing  only  43  percent  of  the  potential  area.  The\ncandidate provinces have an irrigable area of 1.55 million ha (nearly 50 percent of the national\nirrigable  area)  of  which  548,032  ha  or  35  percent  have  been  developed  in  3,330  irrigation\nschemes. Many systems have deteriorated because of poor maintenance, and some of those\nconstructed more than five years ago need upgrading or rehabilitation to restore or improve\nefficiency.\nC.  Government Policies and Plans\n23.  The  Government  is  committed  to  modernizing  agriculture  and  to  transforming  the\nagriculture  sector  into  an  important  source  of  growth  and  the  basis  for  sustainable  rural\ndevelopment.  It  intends  to  promote  higher-value  crops,  value-added  processing,  agribusiness\nactivities, and agro-industrialization through the appropriate use of technology and provision of\nincentives. It seeks to enhance competitiveness in both domestic and foreign markets and attract\nprivate investments by adopting more market-oriented policies and providing adequate public\ninfrastructure facilities.\n24.  These objectives and principles are enshrined in RA 8435 of 1997, the Agriculture and\nFisheries Modernization Act (AFMA) and its implementing rules and regulations issued by DA in\n                                                \n13Source: Department of Public Works and Highways Atlas, DPWH, Manila, Philippines,1996.", "6\nJuly 1998. The AFMA includes commitments to poverty alleviation and social equity as guiding\nprinciples of the country\u2019s agricultural development.14 Its goal is \u201ca more equitable distribution of\nopportunities, income and wealth; a sustained increase in the amount of goods and services\nproduced by the nation for the benefit of the people; and expanding productivity as the key to\nraising the quality of life for all, especially the underprivileged.\u201d\n25.  Consistent with RA 8425, the AFMA dictates that poverty alleviation and social equity are to\nbe given prime consideration by ensuring that the poorer sectors of society have equitable access\nto resources, income opportunities, basic and support services, and infrastructure, especially in\nareas where productivity is low, as a means of improving their quality of life compared with other\nsectors  of  society.\u201d  Food  security  is  also  to  be  given  high  priority  to  assure  the  availability,\nadequacy, accessibility, and affordability of food supplies to all at all times.\n26.  The AFMA recognizes the critical role of agriculture and rural development in the reduction\nof poverty and acknowledges the barriers to such development. In response to these constraints,\nthe AFMA puts great priority on the planning and programming of rural infrastructure through\nmultisectoral  consultations  involving  the  Government,  NGOs,  people\u2019s  organizations,  and  the\nprivate  sector.  For  example,  medium-  and  long-term  comprehensive  agriculture  and  fisheries\nmodernization  plans  (AFMP)  have  been  prepared  by  DA  using  participatory  methods  and\nincorporating municipal, provincial, and regional plans which, in turn, are based on a process of\nstakeholder and beneficiary consultation. The medium-term AFMP serves as the Agricultural and\nFisheries Sector Development Plan in the MTPDP. The AFMP also covers the medium-term and\nannual Agriculture and Fisheries Sector Public Investment Program (AFSPIP) that is incorporated\ninto the Philippine Medium Term Public Investment Program.\n27.  The AFMA also mandates that DA work with its partner LGUs in developing plans for\ninfrastructure for agriculture and fisheries, and strengthening their engineering groups to implement\nthese plans expeditiously. DA is expected to collaborate with other concerned NGAs to accelerate\ncapability building of LGUs to enable them to fulfill their responsibilities under the LGC.\n28.  There has been substantial underinvestment in the agriculture sector and LGUs have been\nunable to provide the necessary agricultural services and infrastructure on their own. AFMA,\ntherefore, emphasizes the need for partnership and, in some cases, transitional arrangements,\nbetween  LGUs  and  the  concerned  NGAs.  These  are  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  required\ntechnical  and  managerial  expertise,  in  addition  to  financial  and  other  resources,  are  made\navailable, while resolving issues related to the flow of foreign loans and grants to LGUs. In the\ncase of irrigation, the AFMA specifies that NIA should continue to be responsible for the major\nirrigation structures of national irrigation systems (NISs), while it should gradually turn over the\nsecondary canals and on-farm facilities of NISs to irrigators\u2019 associations (IAs). The planning,\ndesign, and management of communal irrigation systems (CISs) and communal irrigation projects\n(CIPs) are to be devolved to the LGUs. Likewise, the budget for construction, operation, and\nmaintenance of CISs and CIPs should be prepared by and routed through LGUs. NIA should\ncontinue to provide technical assistance as long as necessary. LGUs are also mandated to make\nrural roads a priority investment and provide at least 10 percent of project cost, subject to their\ninternal revenue allotment level.\nD.  External Assistance to the Sector\n29.  The Philippines has received substantial loans and grants from external sources for rural\ninfrastructure development. The assistance has been concentrated in new and rehabilitated small-,\nmedium-, and large-scale irrigation and drainage infrastructure, and rural roads. The assistance\nhas been led by ADB, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Japan Bank for\n                                                \n14\n AFMA\u2019s implementing rules and regulations include provisions that \u201cthe State shall ensure the development of the\nagriculture and fisheries sector in accordance with the following principles: (i) poverty alleviation and social equity,\n(ii) food  security,  (iii)  rational  use  of  resources,  (iv)  global  competitiveness,  (v)  sustainable  development,  and\n(vi) people\u2019s empowerment.\u201d", "7\nInternational Cooperation,15 and World Bank. Several bilateral agencies, including the Danish\nInternational  Development  Agency  (Danida),  the  European  Union,  United  States  Agency  for\nInternational Development (USAID), and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), have\nalso been active in supporting irrigation improvements.\n30.  ADB  has  been  closely  coordinating  with  these  agencies  to  address  critical  issues  of\ncommon concern, including promoting improved cost recovery and operations and maintenance\n(O&M),  and  advancing  the  devolution  of  responsibilities  for  planning  and  developing  rural\ninfrastructure. In addition to geographical coordination to avoid overlaps between projects, ADB\u2019s\ncoordination efforts have focused on ensuring that a consistent approach be applied to cost-\nsharing formulas among the Government, participating LGUs, and beneficiaries; as well as to\nbeneficiary contributions to O&M and cost recovery. Considering the similar assistance provided\nunder  the  World  Bank\u2019s  ongoing  Mindanao  Rural  Development  Project,16  ADB  consulted\nintensively with the World Bank to avoid overlaps and unnecessary competition between the two\nprojects.17\nE.  Lessons Learned\n31.  The majority of ADB projects involving small-scale rural infrastructure in the Philippines\nhave been area development projects, including two in Palawan,18 one in Sorsogon,19 one in\nBukidnon,20 one in Maguindanao,21 one in Zamboanga del Sur and Zamboanga del Norte,22 and\none in the Cordillera Administrative Region.23 ADB\u2019s first Palawan project (footnote 18) received a\npartly successful performance rating, the project in Sorsogon (footnote 19) has been rated as\ngenerally successful, and remaining projects are ongoing and rated as satisfactory. ADB\u2019s most\nrecent project involving small-scale rural infrastructure in the Philippines is the Rural Infrastructure\nDevelopment Project (footnote 22). Major lessons learned during implementation of this project\ninclude: (i) provision and/or improvement of access infrastructure in areas with agricultural potential\ncan make a significant difference in farm income; (ii) LGU and beneficiary involvement at all levels\nof project conceptualization, design, and implementation is crucial to sustained O&M; (iii) use of\nlabor-based equipment-supported techniques for O&M can be cost-effective and increase local\nownership by providing opportunities for part-time employment; and (iv) small road-based toll fees\ncan be levied against traders and used to offset O&M costs.\n32.  ADB\u2019s experience with devolved implementation arrangements and dealing directly with\nLGUs has been limited primarily to larger urban LGUs and provincial LGUs.24 These projects are\nongoing, though preliminary results suggest that the participation of urban LGUs may be somewhat\nmore susceptible to changes in political leadership and priority than participation of smaller LGUs.\nThe World Bank\u2019s Agrarian Reform Communities Development Project (ARCDP) I, however, deals\n                                                \n15The Japan Bank for International Cooperation was created on 1 October 1999 as a result of the merger between the\nExport-Import Bank of Japan and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund. The latter had been a major donor\nsupporting rural infrastructure development in the country.\n16The World Bank\u2019s Mindanao Rural Development Project, approved in November 1999 for $27.5 million, covers the\nprovinces of Agusan del Sur, Compostela, Maguindanao, North Cotabato, and Sultan Kudarat.\n17These consultations resulted in cost-sharing arrangements (para. 80) and selection criteria (para. 100) that do not\nresult in one project providing significantly more favorable terms to LGUs than the other.\n18Loans 528/529(SF)-PHI: Palawan Integrated Area Development Project, for $32.0 million/$15.0 million, approved on\n29 September 1981, and closed in May 1991; and Loans 1033(SF)/1034-PHI: Second Palawan Integrated Area\nDevelopment Project, for $25.0 million/$33.0 million, approved on 27 September 1990.\n19Loan 915(SF)-PHI: Sorsogon Integrated Area Development Project, for $24.1 million, approved on 3 November 1988,\nand closed in April 1997.\n20Loan 1453-PHI: Bukidnon Integrated Area Development Project, for $20.0 million, approved on 23 July 1996.\n21Loan 1136(SF)-PHI: Kabulnan Irrigation and Area Development Project, for $48.0 million, approved on 28 November\n1991.\n22Loan 1332-PHI: Rural Infrastructure Development Project, for $17.5 million, approved on 10 November 1994.\n23Loans  1421/1422(SF)-PHI:  Cordillera Highland Agricultural Resource Management Project,  for  $18.05  million,\napproved on 11 January 1996.\n24For  example,  Loan  1599-PHI:  Subic Bay Area Municipal Development Project,  for  $22  million,  approved  on\n19 December 1997; Loan 1658-PHI: Clark Area Municipal Development Project, for $24.3 million, approved on\n15 December 1998; and Loan 1453-PHI (footnote 20).", "8\ndirectly with small rural LGUs and will be completed 1.5 years ahead of schedule. A recent World\nBank briefing paper on the project states \"in the design phase of the ARCDP I, grave doubts were\nheld  as  to  the  capability  of  the  LGUs  to  implement  this  project.  Those  fears  have  proved\ngroundless and indeed the participation of the LGUs has been a critical success factor.\" A recently\ncompleted review mission of ADB\u2019s Agrarian Reform Communities Project25 came to a similar\nconclusion and found a high level of commitment and implementation capacity among participating\nLGUs.\n33.  Over  the  past  few  years,  there  has  been  increasing  convergence  of  ideas  on  how\nforeign-assisted projects should be designed and implemented, especially those whose targeted\nbeneficiaries are rural communities and LGUs. The lessons learned from the successes and\nfailures of completed projects have been similar across sectors and even across countries, as\nADB\u2019s postevaluation findings show.26 Relevant lessons learned include (i) a strong coordinating\nbody is required, (ii) project management should be accessible to the project area, (iii) procedures\nfor the release of funds to implementing agencies must be streamlined, (iv) comprehensive ADB\nsupervision  and  reviews  are  necessary,  (v)  rural  infrastructure  (roads  and  irrigation  systems)\nmaintenance must be ensured, (vi) adequate resources for engineering designs must be provided,\nand (vii) the performance of contractors for infrastructure and compliance with design standards\n(construction supervision) must be closely monitored. A summary of lessons learned from recent\nADB-financed projects is given in Appendix 2.\n34.  The most important problem that has been noted, whether the projects involve rural roads,\ncommunal  irrigation,  or  water  supply,  is  the  failure  to  ensure  the  sustainable  operation  and\ncontinued  maintenance  of  the  facilities  created.  This  was  generally  due  to  (i)  the  lack  of\ninvolvement and participation of the communities that were the supposed beneficiaries of the\nproject, and (ii) the lack of LGU involvement and committed counterpart funds for O&M. It is\ntherefore important that (i) targeted beneficiaries and potential users be organized and involved\nfrom the very beginning of the project cycle, from project identification and site selection through\nproject  design  and  implementation;  and  (ii)  LGUs  and  end-users  have  clearly  defined\nresponsibilities for O&M of facilities that are agreed upon in advance. A participatory, community-\nbased approach to project planning and implementation is a major prerequisite for ensuring the\nquality and sustainability of small-scale infrastructure in rural areas. Such an approach will also\nmake the project less susceptible to change in political leadership and development priorities.\n35.  More than just the beneficiary communities themselves, the concerned LGUs should be\nactively involved in the process and committed to the provision of O&M. They should not merely be\nconsulted, but be the lead implementers of projects. The LGC recognizes the difficulties inherent in\nhaving rural infrastructure projects provided and maintained by the national government. While\nNGAs should continue to provide policy guidance and technical support, the concerned LGU\nshould  coordinate  with  all  participating  agencies  and  be  solely  responsible  for  the  project\u2019s\noutcome. As much as possible, the LGUs should also, whether singly or as a group, take the\ninitiative in prioritizing their needs and securing the financing to meet these needs.\nF.  ADB\u2019s Sectoral Strategy\n36.  ADB\u2019s operational strategy for the Philippines, revised in 1998, gives increased emphasis to\npoverty  reduction  and  social  development  (footnote  12).  In  particular,  the  strategy  promotes\nequitable growth, better provision of basic social services, and environmental protection. The\nstrategy recognizes that rural development is a key to advancing equitable growth and poverty\nreduction,  and  supports  more  balanced  regional  development,  with  special  emphasis  on  the\nsouthern Philippines. In support of the LGC, ADB also supports the devolution of project planning\nand implementation to LGUs through strengthening local institutional and financial capacity. ADB\u2019s\nsectoral  strategy  identifies  lack  of  an  appropriate  policy  environment  and  inadequate  rural\n                                                \n25 Loan 1667-PHI: Agrarian Reform Communities Project, for $93 million, approved on 18 December 1998.\n26ADB.

The proposed Project is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s country and sector strategy, and\ncontributes to achieving ADB\u2019s overarching objective of poverty reduction.\nG.  Policy Dialogue\n37.  Policy  dialogue  during  project  preparation  has  focused  on  advancing  decentralization,\nimproving O&M for infrastructure, and promoting beneficiary participation.\n1.  Strengthened Decentralization\n38.  Under the LGC, greater responsibilities for rural development have been devolved to LGUs.\nWith LGU-led implementation arrangements and a fully decentralized funds flow mechanism, the\nProject will advance the implementation of the LGC, particularly the devolution of responsibilities\nfor rural development to municipal-level LGUs. Under the Project, LGUs will be directly responsible\nfor  identifying,  appraising,  implementing,  and  monitoring  subprojects  while  DA  will  focus  on\nproviding overall guidance and policy support. LGU eligibility criteria, supported by the demand-\ndriven structure, will ensure that the participating LGUs have strong commitment and adequate\ninstitutional and financial capacity to implement, maintain, and monitor the subprojects (para. 100).\n39.  To promote local autonomy in financial planning and management, the loan proceeds and\nGovernment counterpart funds for rural infrastructure investments will be directly channeled to\nLGUs through municipal development fund (MDF) mechanisms (or other mechanisms that are\nconsidered appropriate at the time of project implementation).28 The Government will ensure that\nadequate counterpart funds for rural infrastructure investments are allocated directly to MDF. This\nwill advance fiscal decentralization and increase financial accountability at the local level. To gain\nstrong ownership by LGUs of rural infrastructure provided under the Project, the participating LGUs\nwill be required to share a specific portion of the investment cost (para. 80).\n40.  To ensure that LGUs are equipped with adequate institutional and technical capabilities, the\nProject  will  train  LGU  staff  in  participatory  project  planning  and  implementation,  contract\nsupervision  and  procurement  procedures,  and  participatory  project  benefit  monitoring  and\nevaluation.\n2.  Improved Operation and Maintenance\n41.  Inadequate O&M and poor cost recovery are among the major reasons for the failure of\nmany rural infrastructure projects. The Government has been trying to improve O&M performance\nin rural infrastructure by devolving major O&M responsibilities to LGUs and beneficiaries. Lessons\nlearned demonstrate that O&M improves when LGUs and beneficiary communities have been\ninvolved in identifying and implementing rural infrastructure projects (para. 34). The Project is\ndesigned to improve O&M of rural infrastructure by promoting decentralized and participatory O&M\nand  cost-recovery  arrangements  (paras.  82-86).  In  line  with  the  LGC,  municipal  LGUs  and\nbeneficiaries will be fully responsible for O&M of infrastructure facilities provided under the Project.\nFor CISs and CIPs, LGUs will ensure that irrigators\u2019 associations (IAs) assume responsibility for\nroutine O&M works and recover full costs of O&M from their members through user charges and\nlabor contribution. For potable water supply facilities, LGUs will work with village waterworks and\nsanitation associations (VWSAs) in collecting user charges and in conducting O&M of the systems.\n                                                \n27 Some of the major policy and institutional constraints will be addressed by Loans 1739/1740-PHI (footnote 5).\n28One possible alternative mechanism is the LGU Development Facility (LGU-DF), currently being designed with ADB\u2019s\nTA 3145-PHI: Strengthening Public Finance and Planning of Local Government Units, for $870,000, approved in\nDecember 1998.", "10\nSimilarly,  where  possible,  mechanisms  such  as  users  fees  will  be  introduced  for  access\ninfrastructure to contribute to O&M costs.\n42.  To ensure strong commitment from LGUs and beneficiary organizations (i.e., IAs and\nVWSAs) and taking into account lessons learned from previous projects, the conclusion of relevant\nimplementation  agreements,  specifying  O&M  responsibilities  of  LGUs  and  beneficiary\norganizations, is a precondition of support to all subprojects. Failure on the part of LGUs to comply\nwith this agreement will result in a heavy financial penalty, including converting Government grant\ninto a LGU loan from MDF. Furthermore, LGUs that fail to properly maintain the facilities will be\ndisqualified from similar assistance from the Government and foreign funding sources.  To promote\nimproved O&M, the Project will provide relevant training to LGUs and beneficiary organizations on\ntechnical requirements for routine O&M and cost recovery mechanisms (para. 61).\n3.  Greater Participation and Transparency\n43.  The Project is designed to ensure that participatory approaches are applied at all stages of\nproject implementation. As a precondition to project support, LGUs will be required to demonstrate\nthat a subproject is identified through a community consultation process (paras. 62 and 100).\nParticipating communities will also be directly involved in designing the subprojects, supervising\nconstruction, and operating and maintaining the facilities. To nurture strong ownership from the\ncommunities, beneficiaries will be contributing a portion of investment costs for CIS, CIP and/or\npotable  water  supply  facilities  in  cash  or  in-kind  (para.  80).  This  arrangement  will  promote\nbeneficiaries\u2019 right to participate in subproject development and will foster greater commitment to\nO&M of the facilities. Willingness of the communities to provide cash or in-kind contributions was\nconfirmed through extensive beneficiary consultations during project preparation.\n44.  To promote greater transparency in project implementation, the Project will establish an\nindependent participatory project performance monitoring system for each subproject. The system\nwill allow beneficiary communities to systematically provide feedback on the progress of subproject\nimplementation and the effectiveness and impact of subproject activities. (paras. 65 and121).\nIV .  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n1.  Project Rationale\n45.  Agriculture  dominates  the  economy  of  the  Philippines  despite  the  development  of\nsubstantial manufacturing and service sectors. Even the manufacturing sector largely depends on\nagriculture for its raw materials. Although 36 percent of the population depends on agriculture for\nlivelihood, the country\u2019s agriculture sector is performing below its potential, national economic\ngrowth is being held back by the slow and erratic progress of agricultural development, and most of\nthose  engaged  in  the  sector  remain  poor.  The  Government  has  recognized  the  need  for\nmodernization of the sector by promulgating AFMA. The Project will complement the Government\u2019s\nplans to stimulate rural growth by focusing on traditionally neglected areas with high agricultural\ngrowth potential.\n46.  Inadequate rural infrastructure stands out as a principal cause of the constraints that many\npoor farmers face in becoming more productive and profitable. Chief among them is the difficulty\nand cost of hauling their inputs to the farm and their outputs to market caused by the lack of\naccess infrastructure (including rural roads, landings, etc.). In extreme cases, farmers are inhibited\nfrom planting any crops on their land, or grow only that which is sufficient for their subsistence\nneeds.  In  others,  farmers  are  deterred  from  switching  to  higher  value  crops  because  of  the\nbulkiness of some, such as fruit and vegetables. Yields are below potential because insufficient", "11\ninputs are applied. Gross margins of farm enterprises are reduced by the cost of haulage.29 The\nabsence of irrigation infrastructure where both suitable land (with regard to soils and topography)\nand sufficient water coexist, prevents the land from attaining its full productive and profit potential.\nThe members of some rural communities are unable to be as productive as they should because of\neither waterborne diseases caused by polluted drinking water or the time spent in fetching water\nfrom a distant source. The main thrust of the Project will be to remove these constraints in the\nproject area. This approach is consistent with ADB\u2019s sectoral strategy, which recognizes improved\nrural infrastructure as the key to sustainable rural development and poverty reduction.\n47.  Since 1991 and the advent of the LGC, the Philippines has been undergoing a major\ndecentralization process, where provincial and municipal LGUs are being made more responsible\nfor rural development, while NGAs assume the roles of facilitator and supporter. To enable LGUs\nto discharge these new responsibilities, resource transfers from NGAs to LGUs have increased,\nparticularly since the mid-1990s. However, full financial decentralization has yet to be realized in\nsocial and urban services and in the agriculture sector. The Project addresses this challenge by\nmaking  LGUs responsible for rural infrastructure investments and shifting DA\u2019s concentration to its\ncore functions of policy formulation, monitoring, and analysis. The Project will thus contribute to the\npromotion of good governance in addition to agricultural growth and rural poverty reduction.\n48.  The  Project  will  adopt  an  approach  that  differs  in  many  respects  from  that  of  earlier\nGovernment and ADB interventions in the rural sector.  It will be driven by the needs and demands\nof communities that lack the infrastructure essential for them to realize the productive potential of\ntheir land. Proposals emanating from LGUs for subprojects that meet financial, economic, and\npoverty reduction-related eligibility criteria will be considered for acceptance by the Project for\nfinancing  and  implementation.  This  demand-driven  sector  approach  will  reduce  the  risk  that\ninterventions  either  do  not  meet  the  priorities  of  the  recipient  community  or  do  not  achieve\nexpected gains in productivity because communities had no sense of ownership, with consequent\nfailure to operate or maintain the infrastructure adequately.30\n49.  The Project concept also assumes that in many areas the provision of an element of\ninfrastructure will complete a system and enable substantial gains in productivity to be realized.\nCompleted,  ongoing,  or  planned  programs/projects  in  the  project  area  offer  opportunities  for\nsynergy  and  consequently,  gains  in  productivity  can  be  greater  than  where  subprojects  are\nimplemented  in  isolation.  Eligibility  criteria  are  framed  to  exclude  LGUs  where  competing  or\noverlapping projects are being or will be implemented, but to allow for the inclusion of subprojects\nthat will generate synergy with other interventions in the area.\n2.  Project Area\n50.  The project area is defined as Bicol, eastern Visayas, Mindanao, and the island provinces\nof Region IV (paras. 14-22).  Individual subprojects will be located in areas where agricultural\ngrowth potential is visible, that have been traditionally neglected by infrastructure investment, and\nwhere the incidence of poverty is relatively high. The regions selected are genuinely poor in both\nabsolute terms and in relation to the Philippines as a whole. These regions also have a greater\nneed for infrastructure and, especially in Mindanao, higher potential for enhanced productivity than\nmost other provinces.\n3.  Sector Approach\n51.  The  sector  approach  is  appropriate  considering  that  the  Government  has  formulated\nAFSPIP in line with the AFMP to meet the needs of the sector as identified in the AFMA (paras. 23-\n28). The total investment needs identified in the AFSPIP amount to approximately $1.5 billion for\n                                                \n29Experience from Loan 1332-PHI (footnote 22) has shown that simple provision/improvement of rural roads (in areas\nwith high agricultural potential) can result in increases in productivity of between 16 and 35 percent and increases in\nincome of nearly 80 percent.\n30The World Bank\u2019s Agrarian Reform Communities Development Project has demonstrated that a demand-driven\napproach dealing directly with LGUs can be extremely effective (para. 32).", "12\nkey  rural  infrastructure  over  the  2000-2006  period.  Out  of  the  total,  about  40  percent  (or\napproximately $600 million) is expected to be directed to the southern Philippines. Based on the\ndemand for rural infrastructure and an assessment of potential LGUs\u2019 ability to satisfy project\neligibility  criteria  (para.  100),  approximately  100  subprojects  are  likely  to  be  developed  and\nfinanced during project implementation. The Project will provide infrastructure investment and\ncapacity-building activities to the LGUs in these subproject sites. The Project will finance about a\nquarter of the total investment identified under AFSPIP.\n52.  Ten core subprojects that are representative in terms of size and scope of proposals\nanticipated from LGUs in the project area were developed during project preparation.31 These\nsubprojects  consisted  of  either  CIS/CIP  development  or  segments  of  rural  road\nconstruction/rehabilitation, or both.32 Of the 10 core subprojects, 4 consisted of only rural road\nconstruction/rehabilitation, 1 of only CIS rehabilitation, and the remaining 5 a combination of CIS,\nCIP, and rural roads. Total investment costs for the individual subprojects range from $0.37 million\nto $2.29 million with an average investment of $1.08 million per core subproject (para. 140). The\ntotal project cost was derived from the cost estimates for the 10 core subprojects.\n53.  DA  is  well  established  and  experienced,  and  has  the  capacity  to  implement  projects\nsatisfactorily.33 Through detailed eligibility and subproject feasibility criteria, the Project is designed\nto  ensure  that  investment  support  is  provided  only  to  LGUs  that  can  demonstrate  strong\ncommitment and adequate project implementation capacity (paras. 100 and 101). To complement\nDA\u2019s and participating LGUs\u2019 capacity, the Project will also provide capacity building and project\nmanagement support. Finally, the sector approach is essential to reinforce the demand-driven\nprinciple being applied in the subproject selection process.\nB.  Objectives and Scope  \n1.  Objectives\n54.  The  long-term  development  goal  is  to  increase  rural  incomes  with  distributional  gains\nfavoring the poor in areas with high agricultural potential. The immediate objectives of the Project\nare to (i) remove the constraints to the improvement of agricultural productivity caused by the lack\nor  inadequacy  of  rural  infrastructure,  and  (ii)  reduce  rural  poverty  by  increasing  agricultural\nproductivity and profitability. This will be achieved by the provision of infrastructure in areas where\nthere is potential for sustainable gains in productivity that will, in turn, lead to increases in rural\nincomes, particularly for farmers and the poor. The project framework is attached as Appendix 1.\n2.  Scope\n55.  The Project will have three components: improved rural infrastructure, capacity building for\ndevolved project implementation and management, and project management and coordination.\na.  Improved Rural Infrastructure\n56.  The Project will provide the following infrastructure where there is potential for substantially\nenhanced productivity with pro-poor distributional effects:\n(i)  Access infrastructure: In areas with potential for vertical or horizontal expansion of\nagriculture, the Project will finance upgrading/rehabilitation of rural roads (primarily\n                                                \n31In addition to feasibility studies, sample initial environmental examinations (IEEs) and resettlement plans were\nprepared.  The  feasibility  studies  and  IEEs  are  available  in  Supplementary  Appendixes  A  and  D.  A  summary\nresettlement plan is in Appendix 8 and the resettlement plan is available in Supplementary Appendix E.\n32The core subprojects are: Aloran, Misamis Occidental (rural roads and CIS); Bayugan, Agusan del Sur (rural roads\nand CIS); Calbayog City, Western Samar (rural roads); Dolores, Eastern Samar (rural roads); Hinunangan, Southern\nLeyte (rural roads); Jiabong, Western Samar (rural roads); Kapalong, Davao del Norte (rural roads, CIS, and CIP);\nMainit, Surigao del Norte (rural roads, CIS, and CIP); San Jose City, Occidental Mindoro (rural roads and CIS); and\nSurigao City, Surigao del Norte (CIS and CIP).\n33DA is currently responsible for seven ADB-funded projects and two TAs, one World Bank-funded project, and several\nsmaller bilateral activities (para. 125).", "13\nmunicipal and village) and the connection of areas with agricultural potential (that\nhave no current transport access).\n(ii)  Communal irrigation: In suitable land with productivity potential to justify investment,\nthe Project will rehabilitate or expand CISs and/or construct new CIPs.34\n(iii)  Potable water supply: The Project will finance potable community water supply\nschemes in places where (a) the present source is either contaminated or so far\nfrom the habitation that considerable potentially productive time is spent in fetching\nwater, (b) there is a potential source of supply that is uncontaminated and could be\ndeveloped  in  a  cost-effective  manner,  and  (c)  the  supply  of  potable  water\ncontributes to agricultural production and improved health.\n57.  Similar  to  the  10  core  subprojects,  candidate  LGUs  will  submit  subproject  proposals\ncomprising one or a combination of access infrastructure, communal irrigation, and potable water\nsupply. Total subproject cost must fall between $250,000 and $5 million equivalent.\ni.  Access Infrastructure\n58.  The Project will construct and/or upgrade access infrastructure.35 The type of work that\ncould be financed will include\n(i)  upgrading to all-weather status and extension of existing rural roads and former\nlogging roads;\n(ii)  upgrading of trails or footpaths to all-weather rural roads;\n(iii)  construction or upgrading of other transportation infrastructure (including landing\nfacilities, etc.) that will enhance productivity by linking production areas to markets;\n(iv)  rehabilitation and construction of drainage canals, culverts, and side drains;\n(v)  rehabilitation and construction of single lane concrete and overflow bridges;\n(vi)  slope protection works; and\n(vii)  in  a  small  number  of  cases,  construction  of  landings,  cableways,  and  cable-\nsuspended footbridges.\nii.  Communal Irrigation\n59.  The Project will rehabilitate existing CISs and construct CIPs in areas with the potential for\nhigher productivity.36 The scope of the subcomponent will include\n(i)  rehabilitation and construction of diversion weirs;\n(ii)  rehabilitation and expansion of CISs;\n(iii)  construction of new CIPs;\n(iv)  repair and construction of drainage canals;\n(v)  repair and construction of communal flood protection and drainage systems; and\n(vi)  desilting, concrete lining, and expansion of irrigation canals.\niii.  Potable Water Supply\n60.  In  response  to  the  priority  placed  by  rural  communities  (particularly  women)  on  the\nprovision of safe potable water, the Project will support the rehabilitation and construction of point\n                                                \n34The Project will support only those CISs that are defective due to either faulty design or inadequate canals and\nstructures, or those damaged as the result of a natural calamity (rather than solely due to inadequate maintenance).\n35Based on the core subprojects, it is estimated that approximately 800 km of rural roads will be constructed/\nrehabilitated under the Project.\n36Based on the core subprojects, an estimated 8,000 hectares of irrigation facilities will be rehabilitated or constructed\nunder the Project.", "14\nsource and communal faucet spring and tubewell development projects.37 The following activities\nwill be covered:\n(i)  construction of intake boxes at springs,\n(ii)  construction of reservoir and break pressure tanks,\n(iii)  laying of distribution pipes and construction,\n(iv)  installation of tap stands, and\n(v)  drilling of tubewells and provision of hand pumps where groundwater of adequate\nquality for cost-effective extraction is present.\nb.  Capacity Building for Devolved Project Implementation and\nManagement\n61.  The  project  design  is  based  on  the  assumption  of  new  or  substantially  changed\nresponsibilities at the LGU level within the process of planning, implementing, and maintaining\nrural infrastructure. To ensure that these responsibilities are effectively carried out, the Project will\nsupport a program of capacity building that will include the strengthening of LGUs, NGOs, and\ncommunity organizations in the subproject sites.  The major beneficiaries of this training will be\nLGU administrators and staff. This strengthening will be effected mainly through locally based\ntraining provided by specialist organizations supported by regular on-the-job training from the\nexpert pool and, as appropriate, staff of the project office. The capacity-building program will\ninclude the following elements.\ni.  Integrated Rural Accessibility Planning\n62.  To  ensure  that  subprojects  proposed  by  LGUs  reflect  the  needs  and  priorities  of  the\nbeneficiary communities and to enhance the development planning capacity of participating LGUs,\nthe Project will coordinate with the ongoing International Labour Organization\u2019s (ILO) Integrated\nRural Accessibility Planning (IRAP) project. The IRAP focuses on rural communities and targets\nmajor  actors  of  local  decision-making:  planners  and  technical  staff,  local  chief  executives,\nmembers of the Sangguniang Bayan (local legislative council), and the local development councils.\nIRAP is a needs-based, multisectoral, gender-sensitive methodology for local-level planning that\naims to contribute to socioeconomic development and poverty reduction by setting up effective\ndevelopment planning capacity at the local, regional, and national levels.38\n63.  Candidate LGUs will participate in IRAP (or, under some circumstances, other similar\nplanning exercises) before submitting project proposals for consideration.\nii.  Strengthening LGUs\n64.  Participating  LGUs  will  be  strengthened,  primarily  through  on-the-job  training,  in  the\nfollowing areas:\n(i)  project management using participatory planning tools and techniques;\n(ii)  preparation  of  subproject  proposals,  including  familiarity  with  the  process  and\ncontent of feasibility studies;\n(iii)  contract  management  and  supervision,  particularly  for  rural  infrastructure\nconstruction and maintenance;\n(iv)  financial  management,  particularly  procedures  involved  in  disbursement  and\nreplenishment of loans;\n                                                \n37Based on the core subprojects, it is estimated that approximately 300 point source and spring and tubewell water\nsupply systems will be constructed or rehabilitated under the Project.\n38The two basic IRAP improvement strategies are (i) bringing the people closer to the goods, services, and facilities by\nenhancing their mobility through improvements of roads and transport systems; and (ii) bringing the goods, services,\nand facilities closer to the people through proper site selection and location.", "15\n(v)  monitoring and evaluation of project results and assessment of the project\u2019s impact\non poverty; and\n(vi)  environmental analysis and management.\niii.  Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation of Subprojects\n65.  Rather than simply monitoring the physical progress of civil works construction/completion,\nevaluation of subprojects will be based on the subproject\u2019s impact on agricultural growth and on\npoverty  reduction.  This  evaluation  is  best  performed  through  a  participatory  monitoring  and\nevaluation mechanism in cooperation with private sector, NGOs, peoples\u2019 organizations, etc. This\nwill be effected through an initial program of training of trainers that will be contracted to a\nprofessional entity. The private sector or NGOs will later be contracted to monitor and evaluate\nsubprojects (in close coordination with the subproject monitoring boards [para. 121]) and assess\nsubproject impact on income, agricultural growth, and poverty reduction (para. 123).\niv.  Strengthening Community Organizations in O&M\n66.  Communities will contribute greatly to routine O&M of infrastructure (access infrastructure)\nand the collection of revenue to contribute to O&M costs (CIS/CIP and water supply). To ensure\nthat the completed facilities are maintained, the Project will support the strengthening of community\norganizations\u2019 capacity for undertaking O&M and for promoting cost recovery. The Project (in\nconjunction  with  NGOs,  the  private  sector,  and  appropriate  Government  agencies)  will  train\ncommunity organizations, VWSAs, and IAs in communities to which infrastructure is provided.\nv.  Department of Agriculture\n67.  DA, as the Executing Agency for the Project and in its capacity as the lead agency for the\nagriculture sector, will be assisted to improve its capacity at central and field levels in\n(i)  setting clear sectoral policy directions;\n(ii)  managing  beneficiary-driven  infrastructural  developments  and  (particularly  in\ncoordination and facilitation) a broad range of projects in partnership with LGUs and\nthe private sector; and\n(iii)  prescribing and implementing procedures for results and benefits monitoring and\nevaluation, and auditing.\nc.  Project Management and Coordination\n68.  For successful project implementation LGUs, communities, and contractors will have to\nperform a number of functions. The project management and coordination component will ensure\nthat the Project provides the major outputs effectively. It will therefore support the requirements for\nstaffing, operations, and equipment for\n(i)  an interagency and intersectoral project management committee (PMC), chaired by\nthe secretary of DA, with its main function to provide policy guidance and overall\nproject direction;\n(ii)  a  lean  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  at  the  central  office  of  DA  to  provide\nsecretariat support to the PMC, and liase with the oversight agencies (National\nEconomic  and  Development  Authority  [NEDA],  Department  of  Finance  [DOF],\nDepartment of Budget and Management [DBM], and Municipal Development Fund\nOffice [MDFO] within DOF) and with the funding agencies;\n(iii)  project advocacy support, prequalification endorsement, and subproject approval\nfrom associated DA regional field units (RFUs);\n(iv)  evaluation  of  LGU  financial  capacities  by  the  MDFO  and  the  Bureau  of  Local\nGovernment Finance (BLGF); and", "16\n(v)  a  project  office  that  is  responsible  for  coordinating  subprojects,  assisting  or\nfacilitating  the  preparation  of  quality  subproject  proposals,  and  delivering  the\nrequired inputs to LGUs in a timely and effective manner.\n69.  The project office will be contracted to a firm that specializes in the management of rural\ndevelopment  projects.  This  arrangement  will  (i)  address  the  Government\u2019s  concerns  vis-\u00e0-vis\nreducing  the  number  of  public  sector  employees  and  will  avoid  long-term  budget  and  staff\nimplications, (ii) enable more efficient implementation of infrastructure investments and delivery of\nservices, (iii) avoid the need to divert scarce government staff from other important tasks, and\n(iv) support decentralization. Furthermore, as the sustainability of the Project lies in the ability of\nparticipating LGUs to identify, develop, construct, and monitor rural infrastructure, there will be no\nneed  to  maintain  a  large  project  management  presence  at  the  national  level  following  the\ncompletion  of  the  Project.  Post-project  monitoring  and  coordination  activities  will  be  the\nresponsibility of the PCU, which can continue operating long after project completion.\n70.  This  component  will  also  support  special  capacity-building  requirements  of  project\nmanagement in the form of aggressive information dissemination campaigns (through RFUs) and\nconsultation workshops. These will primarily be to assist the PCU and project office to (i) obtain the\nactive participation of LGUs, (ii) generate broad-based consensus on the project\u2019s plans and\nbudgetary requests, and (iii) discuss and solve implementation constraints. There will be limited\nsupport for policy studies to clarify and address project risks that could undermine the efficient\ndelivery of project outputs.\n71.  Within the project office, a geographic information system-based management information\nsystem  (GIS-MIS)  will  be  developed  to  (i)  facilitate  project  implementation,  and  (ii)  provide\ninfrastructural and other data to other government agencies such as regional NEDA and DA\noffices, Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), and provincial planning offices. The\nGIS-MIS will be established in parallel at the PCU and in the project office and linked through the\nNational Information Network (NIN) which is maintained by DA\u2019s Information Technology Center for\nAgriculture and Fisheries (ITCAF). While the  project office will be responsible for maintaining and\nregularly updating the database, DA and the PCU will have equal access to the information. Post-\nproject responsibility for the GIS-MIS will lie with ITCAF and the PCU. The GIS-MIS will be also\nlinked to appropriate databases at NIA, Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), and\nDILG.\n72.  MDFO\u2019s capacity to support the Project will have to be enhanced (MDFO will have to\nfinancially appraise approximately 100 subprojects). The Project will finance at least three staff\n(selected and engaged by MDFO) and limited equipment in MDFO for this Project.\nC.  Cost Estimates\n73.  The total cost of the Project over seven years is estimated at $150.0 million equivalent,\nincluding physical and price contingencies, interest during implementation, fees, taxes, and duties.\nOf the total cost, about $44.4 million or 29.6 percent is in foreign exchange cost and $105.6 million\nequivalent or 70.4 percent is local currency costs. The costs for capacity building and project\nmanagement and coordination will not continue beyond the end of the project period. A summary\nof  the  cost  estimates  is  in  Table  1  and  detailed  cost  estimates  are  in  Appendix  3  and\nSupplementary Appendix C.", "17\nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total Cost\nItem Exchange Currency\nA.

Financing Plan\n1.  Financing Plan\n74.  The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan equivalent to $75 million from its\nordinary capital resources with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based\nvariable lending rate system for US dollar loans. The loan will have an amortization period of 25\nyears, including a grace period of 7 years, a front-end fee of 1 percent of the loan amount, and an\nannual commitment charge of 0.75 percent. Of the total cost of $150.0 million, the proposed ADB\nloan will finance the foreign exchange cost of $44.3 million and $30.7 million equivalent of the local\ncurrency costs (about 29 percent of the total local currency cost), representing 50.0 percent of the\ntotal project cost. The Government will finance $37.2 million equivalent (24.8 percent), LGUs will\nfinance  $28.3  million  equivalent  (18.9  percent),  and  beneficiaries  will  finance  $8.5  million\nequivalent (5.6 percent). The remaining $1 million (0.7 percent) will be funded by the International\nLabour Organization (ILO). The financing plan is summarized in Table 2, with the details provided\nin Appendix 3. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local\nSource Exchange Currency Total Percent\nAsian Development Bank 44.3 30.7 75.0 50.0\nGovernment 0.0 37.2 37.2 24.8\nLocal Government Units 0.0 28.3 28.3 18.9\nBeneficiaries 0.0 8.5 8.5 5.6\nInternational Labour Organization 0.1 0.9 1.0 0.7\n         Total 44.4 105.6 150.0 100.0\nSource: Staff estimates.\n75.  The ADB loan will finance 50 percent of the costs of civil works. The ADB loan will also\nfinance the cost of vehicles and equipment (less duties and taxes), the cost of the consultants\noperating the project office, 50 percent of nonsalary incremental recurrent costs and the interest\nduring implementation, commitment charges, and the front-end fee. The Government will finance\n27 percent of the costs of civil works, all salary costs, and 50 percent of the other incremental\nrecurrent costs. LGUs will finance 17 percent of the costs of civil works and 74 percent of O&M.", "18\nBeneficiaries will finance 6.3 percent of civil works and 23 percent of O&M. ILO will finance costs\nrelated to IRAP.\n76.  The proposed level of ADB financing, including 29 percent of the total local currency cost, is\nreasonable because the foreign exchange content of the type of civil works to be constructed\nunder the Project (rural roads, irrigation systems, and water supply) is quite low. Concerted efforts\nhave been made to maintain domestic investment at levels to sustain growth. However, the country\ncontinues  to  face  pressure  on  the  budget,  arising  from  currency  depreciation  and  reduced\nrevenues resulting from slow growth. The Government has also cut expenditures to contain a\nbudget deficit. The proposed level of ADB financing is also justified considering the proposed\nProject's emphasis on advancing decentralization, building the capacity of LGUs and community\norganizations, promoting participation, and providing benefits to the lower income classes of the\nrural population.\n2.  Financing and Cost Sharing Arrangements\na. Financial Flows and Mechanisms\n77.  Loan proceeds and counterpart funds will be channeled through two distinct mechanisms\n(Appendix 4). Under the improved rural infrastructure component, loan proceeds, and counterpart\nfunds from the Government will be directly channeled to the participating LGUs. Funds will be\ncoursed from DBM through MDF mechanisms to LGUs (or any other mechanisms considered most\nappropriate at the time of project implementation [footnote 28]). The Government will ensure that\nadequate counterpart funds required under this component are incorporated in the DA budget. The\nfunds will be debited from DA\u2019s budget ceiling and credited to the MDFO.\n78.  For the capacity building for devolved project implementation and management and the\nproject management and coordination components, loan proceeds and counterpart funds will be\nallocated as part of DA\u2019s development budget.\nb. Cost-Sharing Arrangements\n79.  Under  the  rural  infrastructure  component,  the  participating  LGUs  will  be  required  to\nsupplement  Government  grants  according  to  cost-sharing  schemes  agreed  between  the\nGovernment  and  LGUs.  In  most  cases,  LGU  refers  to  a  municipal  or  city  LGU  unless  the\nsubproject scope covers two or more municipalities or its scale requires financing beyond the\ncapacity of a municipality, and thus requires the provincial LGU to be the implementing partner.\nWhere  feasible,  however,  the  LGU  contribution  could  be  shared  between  the  provincial  and\nmunicipal LGUs. LGUs will have an option to finance their contribution from (i) their own resources,\n(ii) a loan from MDFO, or (iii) a mix of equity and loan. The cost-sharing schemes for each\nsubcomponent were formulated considering (i) the Government\u2019s policy on cost sharing in the rural\ninfrastructure sector, (ii) financial capability of the LGUs, (iii) need to avoid discouraging higher\nincome  LGUs  from  undertaking  subprojects  that  will  benefit  poor  communities,  and\n(iv) compatibility with other cost-sharing arrangements under similar projects covering Mindanao.39\nConclusion of an implementation agreement between DA and LGU on cost-sharing responsibilities\nis a precondition of support to any subproject.\n80.  For access infrastructure, LGUs will contribute 20-30 percent of the total investment cost\n(20 percent for income classes IV to VI, and 30 percent for classes I to III; classes are defined in\nfootnote 10). Under the communal irrigation subcomponent, LGUs will finance 40-50 percent of the\ntotal construction cost (40 percent for income classes IV to VI, and 50 percent for classes I to III).\nLGUs will recover 30 percent of the total investment cost from IAs based on terms agreed between\nthe concerned LGU and IA. For the potable water supply facilities, LGUs will be required to finance\n30-40 percent of the total investment cost (30 percent for income classes IV to VI, and 40 percent\n                                                \n39These projects include Loan 1667-PHI (footnote 25) and Loan 1332-PHI (footnote 22), and the World Bank-financed\nMindanao Rural Development Project (footnote 16).", "19\nfor classes I to III). Within the LGU share, 10 percent of the total investment cost will be recovered\nfrom VWSAs.\n81.  If an LGU lacks the funds to fully finance its share of the equity, it will be eligible to borrow\nfrom the ADB loan proceeds to cover the residual cost after putting up a minimum of 10-30 percent\n(depending on LGU income class) of its total equity share. This onlending operation will be most\nefficiently effected through MDFO because the grant funding, which covers about 70 percent of\nproject cost, will also be coursed through the MDFO.40 Following a process of financial capacity\nevaluation and approval by the MDFO Policy Governing Board (PGB),41 the financing arrangement\nwill be embodied in a subloan agreement between the MDFO and the LGUs concerned (provinces\nand municipalities or cities). The subloan agreement will contain the terms and conditions for the\nsubloan to the LGU including the maturity period and interest rate, and provision for internal\nrevenue allotment intercept if the LGU does not pay promptly.42 The PGB, which determines\nonlending terms on an annual basis, will be requested to make these terms as competitive as\npossible. Since MDFO is still obtaining approval for and putting in place its regular personnel\ncomplement, interim arrangements will have to be made, including detailing contractual staff under\nthe Project to MDFO (para. 72). Appendix 4 is a flow chart that illustrates the funds flow process.\nE.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Cost Recovery and Operations and Maintenance\n82.  The Government\u2019s grant support will cover 50-80 percent of the cost of construction or\nrehabilitation of the infrastructure provided by the Project, or an average of 70 percent across all\ntypes  of  infrastructure  subprojects.  However,  the  LGUs  or  users  concerned  will  assume  full\nresponsibility for their efficient operation and continued maintenance. To the extent possible, the\nprimary responsibility for maintenance will be assigned to the lowest level of LGU (or users group)\nwithin whose jurisdiction the subproject is located. When necessary, higher-level LGUs will provide\ntechnical and financial support and equipment. The details of the O&M arrangements will be\nspecified in the subproject implementation agreements between the LGU concerned and DA.\nUnder  the  implementation  agreement,  if  an  LGU  fails  to  comply  with  this  agreement,  the\nGovernment will convert its grant into an LGU loan from MDFO.43 Furthermore, LGUs that fail to\nproperly maintain roads and other access infrastructure will be disqualified from similar assistance\nfrom the Government and foreign funding agencies.\na.  Access Infrastructure\n83.  LGUs will assume full responsibility for maintaining access infrastructure facilities that will\nbe constructed and upgraded under the Project. The implementation agreement between the\nparticipating LGU and the DA will specify responsibilities and procedures for routine O&M. To\npromote cost-effective approaches to O&M requirements, under the supervision of municipal LGUs\nvillage-based labor-intensive road repair and maintenance schemes will be instituted.44 To promote\n                                                \n40It is anticipated that approximately 10 percent of the loan proceeds will be on lent in this fashion.\n41The scope of this financial evaluation and a delineation of responsibilities will be agreed upon in a memorandum of\nagreement (MOA) to be completed between DA and DOF. This MOA is a condition of loan effectivity. A draft of the\nMOA was a condition of loan negotiations.\n42Under the LGC, LGUs may borrow from the Government the proceeds of loans contracted from foreign financial\ninstitutions for various projects and repay these loans from the income of these projects or from their regular income\nthat includes their share of national internal revenue taxes. The Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) intercept is a\nmechanism agreed upon by the LGU and the financial institution through which a portion of the LGU\u2019s IRA is withheld\nby DBM upon the request of the lender in case the LGU fails to service its debt promptly.\n43MDFO can, if requested by DA, convert funds that are channeled to LGUs as grant into loan. DA will monitor O&M\ncompliance through subproject monitoring boards (SPMBs) that will be established in each participating LGU (para.\n121).\n44Such a scheme is presently being pilot tested under Loan 1332-PHI (footnote 22). Rather than employing traditional\nmechanized road maintenance techniques alone (i.e., graders), under the scheme village-based road maintenance\ncrews are mobilized to undertake regular labor-intensive road maintenance on sections of road within the village.\nThese crews are provided with hand tools and paid by the municipal LGU.", "20\nimproved  O&M,  the  Project  will  assist  LGUs  in  instituting  road-based  revenue-generating\nmeasures, including toll fees, in which the proceeds could be used to partly pay the maintenance\nlabor cost.45 The Project will also assist LGUs in formulating measures for realizing the gains from\ninfrastructure improvement, including improved real property tax collection, reevaluation of the\nbenefited real properties, and imposition of a special levy.\nb.  Communal Irrigation\n84.  For CIS facilities, LGUs will assure that IAs assume responsibility for O&M of the systems\nand recover the full cost for O&M from its members through service fees and labor contribution. An\nMOA between LGUs and IAs will specify detailed responsibilities and procedures for O&M and\ncost-recovery arrangements.\n85.  The implementing rules and regulations for AFMA mandates DA, through NIA and the\nAgricultural Training Institute, to collaborate with DOF and DILG on a program of capability building\nto enable LGUs and IAs to sustain and maintain CIS facilities. Coordination with the Department of\nEnvironment and Natural Resources (DENR) is also required to address problems related to\ninadequate watershed management and protection to ensure the long-term sustainability of the\noperations of CIS. This coordination will in turn allow the IAs to cover the costs of continued O&M\nand  to  repay  their  30  percent  share  of  the  construction  or  rehabilitation  cost  to  the  LGUs\nconcerned. Pursuant to the implementation agreement, failure to adequately maintain and operate\nthe CIS facilities financed by the Project will disqualify the IAs and LGUs from future assistance\nfrom the Government for CIS rehabilitation.\nc.  Potable Water Supply\n86.  O&M  of  the  potable  water  supply  systems  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  the\nresponsibility of the municipalities in which they are located. The municipal LGUs will work with the\nVWSA in collecting user charges and conducting O&M works of the systems. The LGU and VWSA\nconcerned will enter into an MOA specifying O&M responsibilities and procedures, as well as fee\ncollection arrangements.\n2.  Implementation Agencies\n87.  DA will implement the components for capacity building for devolved project implementation\nand  management,  and  project  management  and  coordination.  LGUs  (municipal,  city,  and\nprovincial) will implement the improved rural infrastructure component. Day-to-day tasks for project\nmanagement and technical assistance to the participating LGUs will be provided by a project\noffice, contracted to the private sector. As the Executing Agency for the Project, DA will be\nresponsible for overall coordination and management of the Project through the PMC and the PCU\nlocated in the Office of the Secretary.\n3.  Overall Project Organization and Coordination\n88.  A proposed organization chart for project implementation is given in Appendix 5. Major\nresponsibilities and roles of the participating agencies and organizations are discussed below.\na.  Local Government Units\n89.  Subproject implementation will be led by LGUs. The specific responsibilities of the LGU will\nbe (i) participatory consultation and preparation of subproject proposals, (ii) award of contracts for\nfeasibility  studies  and  detailed  engineering  designs,  (iii)  contracting  and  supervising\nimplementation  of  subprojects,  (iv)  monitoring  of  physical  progress  and  evaluation  of  results,\n(v) financial management, and (vi) preparation of O&M plans and implementation and supervision\nof O&M.\n                                                \n45Also in Loan 1332-PHI (footnote 22), it has been demonstrated that even on rural roads, small toll fees can be\ncollected to help offset O&M costs.", "21\n90.  The Project will include mechanisms for ensuring LGU accountability to the Government\nvis-\u00e0-vis funds flow and generating monitorable results that demonstrate an impact on equitable\nagricultural growth, rural development, and poverty reduction. To enhance project ownership and\nto account for varying institutional realities, two organizational options are proposed taking into\naccount the roles of municipal and provincial governments in the provision of different types of rural\ninfrastructure.  One option will be an implementation structure led by the municipality with the\nprovince  performing  TA  and  monitoring  functions.  The  other  option  will  be  a  province-led\nimplementation scheme. This latter scheme will serve when a municipality lacks implementation\ncapacity and requests such support or when there are two or more participating municipalities\ninvolved in a subproject.46\nb.  Project Management Committee\n91.  At the top of the DA management structure will be an interagency PMC that will be chaired\nby the secretary of DA.47 The main function of the PMC will be to approve subproject feasibility\nstudies and to provide policy guidance, overall management direction, interagency coordination,\nsupport for financial and budgetary requests, and resource allocation.\nc.  Project Coordination Unit\n92.  The PMC will be directly linked to the office of the secretary of DA, where a small PCU will\nbe located. The PCU will act as secretariat to the PMC and will be headed by a national project\ndirector (at no less than a DA director level) and assisted by a project manager (at no less than a\nDA division chief level) and an appropriate complement of supporting staff. The primary functions\nof the PCU will be to coordinate the activities of the Project and liaise with other NGAs, ADB, and\nother funding agencies. It will also be the Government\u2019s official agency for procurement, financial\nmanagement, and monitoring and evaluation.\n93.  The PCU will be mobilized well in advance of loan effectiveness so that it can manage a\nnumber  of  crucial  transitional  activities  between  the  approval  of  the  Project  and  its  full\nimplementation. These will include (i) preparation of operations manuals and plans for ensuring the\nlong-term sustainability of the subprojects; (ii) procurement of consultancy services and initial\nequipment and vehicles; (iii) submission of budget requests; and (iv) finalization of eligibility criteria,\nprioritization of initial subprojects, and communication with all LGUs in the project regions with\nregard to project activities.\nd.  Regional Field Units\n94.  The DA RFUs will be engaged to support the Project through information dissemination,\nadvocacy, and \u201cpriming-up\u201d activities with LGUs. Specifically, RFUs within the project area will\npublicize and disseminate information to promote the Project. RFUs will also coordinate at a\nnational  level  with  the  provincial  and  municipal  leagues,  provide  logistical  support  (such  as\ntransportation  and  staff  support)  to  the  PCU  and  the  project  office,  and  be  involved  in  the\ndevelopment of the results monitoring and evaluation systems.\n95.  RFUs will have to endorse subproject proposals emanating from LGUs and proposed by\nthe project office for feasibility study. Regional technical committees (RTCs) based in the RFUs will\nbe  responsible  for  endorsing  individual  subprojects  to  the  PCU  following  the  completion  of\nfeasibility studies.48\n                                                \n46Subprojects proposed for adjoining municipalities or radiating from a core subproject will be encouraged.\n47The PMC will be comprised of relevant officials from DA, representatives from oversight agencies (i.e., NEDA, DOF,\nand DBM), MDFO, and other appropriate NGAs, namely the Department of Agrarian Reform, DENR, DPWH, and NIA,\ntogether with other organizations such as the leagues of provinces and municipalities, and representatives from civil\nsociety and the private sector.\n48The RTCs are comprised regional and provincial representatives from DA, NEDA, BLGF, DBM, and other appropriate\nNGAs, select LGU officials, together with representatives from civil society and the private sector. RTCs are supported\nby Regional Technical Secretariats.", "22\ne.  Municipal Development Fund Office\n96.  For those LGUs availing of subloans to finance a portion of their equity, MDFO (supported\nby  BLGF)  will  have  responsibility  for  conducting  financial  evaluations  to  verify  LGU  financial\ncapacity to service subloan payments.49  MDFO is experienced in performing this task and has\ndone so under a number of ADB and the Word Bank projects.50 In accordance with Government\npolicy  on  borrowing  through  MDFO,  LGU  financial  capacity  must  be  evaluated  and  the\ncorresponding subproject approved by the PGB (footnote 41).\n97.  Regardless of whether an LGU chooses to borrow from MDFO, BLGF (whose regional\noffice will also be represented on the corresponding RTC) will assist in validating the financial\nposition of all candidate LGUs. The purpose of this validation will be to ensure that (i) the LGU has\nsufficient resources to contribute its equity portion, (ii) funds are available to finance all incremental\nO&M resulting from the subproject, and (iii) the LGU has sufficient borrowing capacity when it\nchooses to borrow from MDFO.\nf.  Project Office\n98.  The actual tasks of day-to-day project management and provision of TA to participating\nLGUs will be provided by the project office (located in Manila). The primary responsibilities of the\nproject office will be (i) overall subproject coordination, (ii) assisting or facilitating prequalification\nand the preparation of quality subproject proposals and feasibility studies, and (iii) delivering the\nrequired inputs to the LGUs in a timely and effective manner. The project office will be staffed by\nproject management consultants and an experts\u2019 pool. The former will be directly involved in\nreviewing and screening subproject proposals emanating from the LGUs. The latter will be hired on\na staggered and as needed basis to provide capacity building and on-the-job training to LGUs and\nDA (para. 64). The consultants will not necessarily be permanently stationed at the project office as\nthey will be moving among participating LGUs.\n99.  The project office will be provided with the vehicles, equipment, and computer hardware\nand software necessary to enable it to function independently. Given the level of responsibility that\nwill be assumed by the project office, it will be essential to have in place a stringent auditing\nsystem. The project office will be led by a team leader who will report directly to the national project\ndirector in the PCU.  The team leader will also be responsible for coordinating activities with the\nRFUs.\n4.  LGU Eligibility Criteria and Subproject Feasibility Criteria\n100.  To  participate  in  the  Project,  LGUs  will  need  to  satisfy  financial,  institutional,  and\norganizational eligibility criteria before subproject proposals can be submitted to the Project. These\ncriteria can be broadly described as (i) financial: the LGU must demonstrate the financial capacity\nto service its counterpart contribution, any subloan payments, and any incremental increase in\nO&M directly attributable to the subproject;51 (ii) institutional: the LGU must have the institutional\nand technical capacity to implement the subproject52 and the subproject must be included in the\nLGU\u2019s  development  plan,  which  has  been  produced  in  a  participatory  fashion;53  and\n(iii) organizational: appropriate monitoring mechanisms must be established and validated by an\nimplementation agreement between the LGU and DA.54 Lastly, an LGU will only be eligible if the\n                                                \n49The LGC permits LGUs to budget up to 20 percent of their annual revenue for debt servicing. MDFO caps this at\n18 percent.\n50Examples of projects for which MDFO conducts financial analysis of participating municipal/provincial LGUs include\nLoan 1453-PHI (footnote 20), Loan 1667-PHI (footnote 25), and the World Bank\u2019s Mindanao Rural Development\nProject (footnote 16).\n51This will be verified by BLGF in their review of candidate LGUs.\n52A key indicator will be the LGU\u2019s commitment to O&M which can be evaluated through a comparison of actual annual\nO&M budgets against that budget amount required were standard DPWH O&M figures used.\n53The institutional capacity of participating LGUs and the appropriateness of proposed subprojects will be evaluated and\nconfirmed as part of the IRAP process.\n54Paras. 79 and 120.", "23\ntotal investment cost of its proposed subproject program falls between $250,000 and $5 million\nequivalent.55\n101.  In addition to eligibility criteria, the LGUs must demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed\nsubproject through standard measures of financial, economic, and technical viability before a\nsubproject proposal can be approved by the PMC. Furthermore, the LGU must show that the\nbenefits of the proposed subproject will be spread equitably and have a pro-poor impact (detailed\nLGU eligibility criteria and subproject feasibility criteria are presented in Appendix 6).\n5.  Subproject Evolution Process\n102.  The starting point in the process will be RFUs ensuring that all eligible municipalities and\nprovinces are apprised of the Project, including details of the types of infrastructure that could be\nfinanced  and  descriptions  of  the  eligibility  criteria  and  feasibility  study  guidelines.  Prior  to\nsubmitting proposals, LGUs will also participate in the IRAP (or, under some circumstances, other\nsimilar planning exercises).\n103.  The LGU will consolidate individual components (e.g., different road segments, CIS/CIPs,\nwater supply systems, etc.) into subprojects. The proponent LGU will then forward subproject\nproposals to the project office. The project office will have the delegated authority to decide\nwhether the LGU and proposal meet the eligibility criteria in order to justify progressing to full\nfeasibility  study,  although  the  project  office  will  also  have  to  secure  endorsement  from  the\nappropriate RFU.\n104.  If the initial subproject proposal is approved, feasibility studies will be conducted by the\nLGU. If an LGU has in-house capacity to conduct a feasibility study, the LGU may undertake it on\nits own; otherwise the study will be contracted out to the private sector or NIA.56 The LGU will\nsubmit the completed feasibility study to the project office, which will evaluate it and prepare\nrecommendations to the RTC. The RTC will review the study and recommend approval or denial. If\nthe subproject is approved by the project office and RTC, the RTC will endorse the feasibility study\nto the PMC. Subprojects with subloans will be first reviewed and approved by the PMC and then\nendorsed to the MDFO for approval. Concurrent with the LGU feasibility study and project office\nand RTC review processes will be a financial evaluation of the LGU conducted by MDFO and/or\nBLGF.  In accordance with Government policy on borrowing through MDFO, the financial capacity\nof borrowing LGUs requires clearance by the MDFO PGB.57 If the LGU does not opt to borrow,\nBLGF will simply validate the LGUs financial position to ensure capacity to contribute counterpart\nand undertake O&M (para. 97).\n105.  If the subproject is rejected by the PMC or MDFO, the LGU will be advised of the reasons\nfor the rejection and may decide to revise and resubmit the proposal. If the subproject is accepted,\nthe PCU will establish the funding channels and schedules in accordance with the cost-sharing\nsystem as defined for that subproject and issue an instruction to proceed. The PCU and project\noffice will facilitate the completion of an implementation agreement between the LGU and DA as\nwell as a subloan agreement between the LGU and MDFO. In consultation with the LGU and\nbeneficiary communities, the project office will determine the requirements for capacity building for\nimplementing the subproject and will accomplish the measures necessary.\n106.  The civil works will be constructed by contractors and supervised by the LGU.58 The LGU,\nin association with civil society and the communities themselves, will be responsible for monitoring\n                                                \n55The cost of a subproject program includes the total cost of civil works (access infrastructure, CIS/CIP, and/or potable\nwater supply) and costs associated with pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, engineering design, contracts, etc.\n56The LGU may borrow funds (supplied by loan proceeds) from MDFO to conduct the feasibility study. Any amounts\nspent on the feasibility study will be considered as LGU counterpart for the subproject as a whole.\n57Approval of technical aspects, however, rests only with the RTC (supported by the project office).\n58To the degree possible and within the confines of ADB procurement guidelines, construction, repair, rehabilitation,\nimprovement, and maintenance of civil works will follow the Commission on Audit (COA) rules on simplified public\nbidding.", "24\nthe construction, preparing routine reports, and ensuring that all relevant reports and data are\nprovided to the project office (para. 120).\n107.  A condition of acceptance of a proposal for financing will be concrete measures taken by\nthe proponent LGU ensuring that routine and corrective maintenance will be undertaken at the time\nrequired. Benefiting communities (particularly with CIS/CIP and water supply) will also be required\nto take responsibility for ensuring that the infrastructure will be properly operated and maintained,\nwith the technical and financial support of the LGU.\n6.  Procurement\n108.  Most  of  the  subprojects  will  be  relatively  small  and  simple,  and  spread  over  a  wide\ngeographical  area,  involving  small  contracts  and  unlikely  to  be  attractive  to  international\ncontractors. All civil works will be contracted out to private construction companies (under some\ncircumstances, however, works may have to be undertaken by NIA).59 Contracts shall be awarded\nthrough  competitive  bidding  among  local  contractors  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s\nstandard procedures acceptable to ADB.60 In the interest of expediting project implementation as\nwell as reducing the potential for manipulation at the prequalification stage, postqualification will be\nused. The use of prequalification will be permitted only for complex civil works or contracts whose\nvalue exceeds $1 million. Equipment to be procured involves mainly vehicles and office and\ncomputer equipment. Equipment and materials will be procured through international shopping and\nlocal  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2018s  Guidelines for Procurement.  Indicative\nprocurement packages are in Appendix 7.\n7.  Land Acquisition\n109.  Assessments of 10 core subprojects indicate that only limited land acquisition, resettlement,\nand displacement of people will be required, as the project roads generally follow the existing\nalignment and rights-of-way. Some relocation of people and structures may be necessary to\naccommodate the rehabilitation of roads, but this will typically only affect a narrow strip fronting the\nexisting  road  embankment.  With  regard  to  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  small  irrigation\nschemes,  land  acquisition  should  be  required  in  case  of  new  construction  only.  Minor  land\nacquisition  may  be  necessary  for  new  road  alignment,  road  widening,  irrigation  canals  and\nappurtenant structures, sites for installation of artesian wells, and standpipes for spring source\ndevelopment.  The  LGU  concerned  will  be  responsible  for  right-of-way  negotiations  and  any\nresettlement and compensation will be in accordance with the resettlement plan developed during\nproject  preparation  and  agreed  to  by  the  Government.  A  summary  resettlement  plan  is  in\nAppendix 8.\n8.  Consulting Services\n110.  Consulting  services  are  required  to  provide  TA  in  the  following  areas:  project  office\nmanagement; verification of feasibility studies (using procedures and practices acceptable to ADB\nwith  regards  to  social,  environmental,  technical,  institutional,  and  economic/financial  viability);\nfinancial and administrative systems; project economics; information systems; benefit monitoring\nand evaluation; poverty impact assessment; environmental assessment; and training.\n111.  The Project will provide approximately 243 person-months of specialized services from\nshort-term  domestic  consultants  and  about  42  person-years  of  long-term  international  and\ndomestic  (in  collaboration  with  the  international)  consultants  through  a  firm  (outline  terms  of\n                                                \n59Particularly where new irrigation systems are being designed and constructed, local construction contractors may not\nhave the capacity or expertise to undertake the works. In such cases, NIA may be contracted, although DA must first\nconsult with ADB and the project office or RFU must verify that there are no local contractors capable of undertaking\nthe works.\n60LGUs may use force accounts to undertake portions of a subproject (amounting to no more than $100,000) if the\nscope of such works is too small to be of interest to local contractors or if appropriate from the perspective of efficiency\nand cost-effectiveness. The project office or RFU must provide written confirmation to ADB that the use of force\naccount is appropriate before the LGU may begin construction.", "25\nreference are in Appendix 9). The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with\nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the\nselection and engagement of consultants.\n9.  Implementation Schedule\n112.  The Project is expected to be implemented over a seven-year period. The implementation\nschedule is presented in Appendix 10.\n10.  Disbursement Arrangements, Accounts, Audits, and Reports\n113.  Two imprest accounts will be established to facilitate the timely release of funds and\nexpedite implementation of the Project. One will be held by MDFO for disbursements related to the\nLGUs\u2019 infrastructure subprojects; the second will be managed by DA for all other eligible expenses.\nMost of the proceeds of the loan will be disbursed through these two imprest accounts, but direct\npayment, reimbursement procedures, and commitment procedures could also be used. A separate\nbank account for each imprest account will be opened promptly after loan effectiveness. The initial\namount to be deposited in each imprest account is not expected to exceed $1 million and will be\nbased  on  an  estimate  of  expenditures  to  be  incurred  during  the  first  six  months  of  project\nimplementation (the ceiling is calculated as an average of the estimated six-month expenditures).\nThe imprest accounts will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated by MDFO and DA\nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements agreed upon\nby MDFO, DA, and ADB. The statement of expenditure procedure will be used for reimbursing\neligible expenditures and to liquidate advances provided to the imprest account in accordance with\nprocedures  satisfactory  to  ADB  and  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook.\nIndividual payments reimbursed or liquidated under statement of expenditure procedures will not\nexceed $50,000 equivalent for each item of expenditure.\n114.  DOF-MDFO  is  currently  reviewing  its  operating  and  disbursement  procedures  in\ncoordination with the COA and DBM. At the start of the Project, all concerned stakeholders will be\nmade  familiar  with  the  agreed  procedures  for  disbursement  and  replenishment  of  imprest\naccounts. As more LGUs participate in the Project, they will be trained and monitored closely as\npart of the Project\u2019s capacity-building activities. The training will consist of workshops or seminars\nin the early stages of an LGU\u2019s involvement with the Project and on-the-job training with LGU\nexecutives. The training will continue until LGU staff are able to comply fully with all disbursement\nrequirements.\n115.  Both  DA  and  MDFO  will  maintain  separate  accounts  and  financial  statements  for  the\nProject, which will be audited annually by COA, and its opinion will be included separately in the\naudit reports. The audit may be carried out as part of the regular annual audit of DA and MDFO\u2019s\ngeneral accounts. In addition to the standard audit opinion, COA\u2019s audit report should also include\nseparate audit opinions on DA and MDFO imprest accounts and statements of expenditures.\nCertified copies of the audited financial statements will be provided to ADB within nine months61\nafter the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. To enhance transparency and because of the\nhigh level of responsibility delegated to the project office, the project office must be routinely\naudited by independent auditors.\n116.  DA  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation,  to  be\nsubmitted within one month after the end of the quarter to which they relate, and such other reports\nand information relating to the Project as ADB might reasonably request. In addition, within three\nmonths of completion of the Project, DA will submit to ADB a project completion report detailing,\namong other things, information on the implementation of the Project, the use of the proceeds of\nthe loans, and the extent to which the objectives of the Project have been accomplished.\n                                                \n61Although normally required within six months, due to the participation of a large number of LGUs spread across a wide\narea, this period is considered too short. A precedent for nine months being acceptable can be found in Loan 1667-\nPHI (footnote 25).", "26\n117.  Due to the wide geographical dispersal of the LGUs expected to participate in the Project,\nDA and MDFO will explore ways of facilitating internal audits as well as periodic audits by COA as\nrequested by ADB.\n11.  Advance Procurement Action\n118.  The  Government  requests  advance  procurement  action  to  expedite  implementation  of\nsubprojects for which feasibility studies have been completed. Advance procurement is requested\nfor the selection of consultants and procurement of equipment and vehicles. The ADB has agreed\nto such request and the Government has been advised that such approval does not commit ADB\nto  finance  the  Project.  All  advance  selection  and  procurement  will  be  carried  out  strictly  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and Guidelines for Procurement.\n12.  Project Reviews\n119.  Semiannual reviews will be conducted in the initial years until ADB judges that an annual\nreview  will  be  sufficient  for  efficient  administration.  In  addition  to  these  regular  reviews,  a\ncomprehensive review will be undertaken jointly by DA and ADB after 18 months and at the\nmidterm of the Project during the third year. Among other things, these reviews will assess the\ngeneral performance of the Project and the need for any changes in its design and implementation\narrangements.\n13.  Monitoring, Evaluation, and Impact Assessment\n120.  The  three  main  aspects  to  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  Project  are\n(i) construction and maintenance of infrastructure, (ii) capacity building, and (iii) benefits within\nsubproject areas and socioeconomic impact.\na.  Construction and Maintenance of Infrastructure\n121.  The Project will make use of existing systems and channels in DA (and if appropriate other\nagencies) for monitoring infrastructure construction (prefeasibility, feasibility, engineering design,\nconstruction, O&M, and monitoring of performance, including the condition of project infrastructure\nand selected nonproject infrastructure).62 LGU staff will be responsible for primary surveys and\ndata collection, which will be fed to DA\u2019s RFUs and transmitted to the project office via NIN. The\nLGU, as the implementing agencies, will be responsible for monitoring and evaluation, with training\nand further evaluation provided by the project office. LGUs will be trained to undertake the global\npositioning system and other surveys required (traffic counts/road usage, CIPs/CISs, water supply,\nstate  of  physical  maintenance).  To  ensure  transparency  and  accountability,  multisectoral\nsubproject monitoring boards (SPMBs) will be established for each subproject. These will be\ncomposed of representatives from the LGU, local NGOs and peoples\u2019 organizations, contractors,\nbeneficiaries, and other stakeholders. The SPMB will be responsible for monitoring project bidding,\nconstruction quality and progress, etc. The SPMB will have access to all bidding documents and\nsubproject financial records. The chairperson of the SPMB will be a nonvoting member of the local\nproject bid and award committee and all SPMB meetings will be public.63\nb.  Capacity Building\n122.  Increased capacity for LGUs to undertake future infrastructure activities will be one of the\nbenefits of the Project. The effectiveness of this component should be measured by the number\nand quality of proposals presented for project funding and the ability of the LGU to use the funds\neffectively. Proposal quality should be monitored according to the number returned as inadequate\n                                                \n62The existing systems in DA include the Project Monitoring and Evaluation Service, Project Development Service,\nRFUs, and Office of the Undersecretary for Regional Operations.\n63The SPMB concept is based on the infrastructure monitoring and advisory group concept that was used successfully in\nMindanao to increase accountability, speed project implementation, and reduce funds diversion on large Government\nprojects.", "27\nas well as the numbers accepted and rejected. The use of funds will be monitored through the\nproject accounting system.\nc.  Project Benefits\n123.  The goal and purposes of the Project relate to the increase in rural productivity and the\nreduction of poverty in the beneficiary areas. The Project will use LGU staff and, as far as possible,\nexisting  mechanisms  to  establish  baselines  and  subsequently  measure  the  performance  of\nsubproject  components.  Rather  than  simply  monitoring  the  physical  progress  of  civil  works\nconstruction and completion, evaluation of subprojects will be based on the subproject\u2019s impact on\nagricultural  growth  and  on  poverty  reduction.  This  evaluation  is  best  performed  through  an\nindependent evaluation mechanism in cooperation with the private sector (and, as appropriate,\nNGOs). This will be effected through an initial program of training of trainers that will be contracted\nto a professional entity. The private sector (or NGOs) will later be contracted to monitor and\nevaluate subprojects and assess subproject impact.\n14.  Geographic Information System and Management Information System\n124.  The GIS-MIS to be developed to support project implementation will be coordinated by the\nproject office, which will work closely with the ITCAF. ITCAF will ensure that the project office,\nPlanning Service, PCU, Office of the Secretary, VWSA, and relevant RFUs are connected and\nsupported through NIN. The strengthening of NIN will be an important requirement to ensure that\nthe  GIS-MIS  delivers  its  support  for  subproject  identification,  feasibility  study  appraisal,  and\nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  ITCAF  will  procure  any  equipment  and  software  (systems  and\napplications) required for all agencies and coordinate and/or supply any capability building or\ntraining  needed  in  information  technology.  They  will  ensure  that  any  information  technology\nsystems developed by the Project\u2019s activities is integrated with NIN.\nF.  The Executing Agency\n125.  The Executing Agency is DA. DA\u2019s capacity to implement projects is demonstrated by the\nsatisfactory status of all ongoing ADB projects in its portfolio. DA is currently responsible for seven\nADB-funded projects and two TAs, one World Bank-funded project, and several smaller bilateral\nactivities.64  Within DA, the PCU will be the lead coordinating office for the Project and senior staff\nin DA are familiar with the overall responsibilities of project coordination.\nG.  Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environmental Impact\n126.  The  eligible  rural  infrastructure  subprojects  fall  entirely  under  Category  B  of  ADB\u2019s\nclassification system (the summary initial environmental examination is in Supplementary Appendix\nD). The environmental impacts are understood and the appropriate environmental management\nmeasures are well known and need only be validated for specific project components and sites.\nFor this proposed sector project, sample initial environmental examinations (IEEs) have been\nprepared for 2 representative core subprojects (rural roads in Aloran, Misamis Oriental and a CIS\nin Cantugas, Mainit, Surigao del Norte) and demonstrate that subprojects will not have significant\nadverse environmental impacts.\n                                                \n64The  ADB-financed  projects  are  (i)  Loan  1136(SF)-PHI  (footnote  21);  (ii)  Loan  1332-PHI  (footnote  22);  (iii)\nLoan1365/1366(SF)-PHI: Second Irrigation Systems Improvement Project, for $27.82 million, approved on 30 August\n1995; (iv) Loan 1421/1422(SF)-PHI (footnote 23); (v) Loans 1562/1563(SF)-PHI: Fisheries Resource Management\nProject, for $34.78 million, approved on 16 October 1997; (vi) Loan 1668-PHI: Southern Philippines Irrigation Sector\nProject, for $60.0 million, approved on 18 December 1998; and (vii) Loans 1739/1740-PHI (footnote 5). The ADB TAs\nare (i) TA 3235-PHI: Review of Cost Recovery Mechanisms for National Irrigations Systems, for $300,000, approved\non 18 December 1998; and (ii) TA 3429-PHI: Grains Policy and Institutional Reforms, for $630,000, approved on 24\nApril 2000. The World Bank-funded project is the Mindanao Rural Development Project (footnote 16).", "28\n127.  Institutional  arrangements  for  ensuring  that  environmental  requirements  are  met  by\nsubprojects proposals are described in detail in the sample IEEs. Subproject proponents will use\navailable IEE checklists prepared by ADB and others to prepare their respective IEEs. Some\nprojects (e.g., new rural roads on very steep slopes and exceeding 5 km in length) might be\nclassified as environmentally critical under Philippine Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)\nregulations and will require a more comprehensive review (an environmental impact statement\n[EIS], which is equivalent to ADB\u2019s EIA document). On the other hand, smaller projects such as the\nrehabilitation of a canal of a CIS are not covered under the Philippine EIS System. The IEE and\nEIS format stipulated under Philippine EIA rules may be used (DENR Administrative Order 96-37\nand the latest Procedural Manual of October 1999).\n128.  Capability building for environmental management of rural infrastructure projects will be\nconducted for involved LGUs. These interventions will include formal and on-the-job training on\nconcepts,  practices,  and  tools  of  EIA,  the  EIA  procedures  of  the  Government  and  ADB,\nenvironmental  management  and  multipartite  monitoring  of  rural  infrastructure  projects,  and\nenvironmental administration and reporting.\n129.  The environmental impacts identified for rural roads on flat to rolling land are construction-\nrelated and minimal. On steep to very steep slopes and loose geological substrates, erosion risks,\nincluding possible loss of the rural infrastructure itself, exist. However, the core subprojects\u2019 rural\nroads components are mostly on flat to rolling land. In steep sections, both realignment away from\nvery steep slopes and slope protection works are recommended.\n130.  The environmental impacts of CIS rehabilitation projects will be minimal. For CIP and weir\nupgrading or construction, construction-related impacts are possible and must be addressed by\ncontractors through the best-known engineering and construction practices. In areas with endemic\nschistosomiasis and malaria, CIS design must incorporate features for control and management of\nsuch communicable water-related diseases.\n131.  For water supply projects, the environmental impacts will be minimal but the contractors will\nbe required to adopt the best-known engineering practices and will be monitored for compliance\nwith those practices. Contractors will be required to properly restore exposed surfaces. Moreover,\nthe water users should be trained in proper maintenance and sanitary practices. Water sources,\ntransmission lines, and faucets should be rigorously monitored for contaminants.\n132.  Project-specific IEEs including environmental management plans will be prepared by the\nLGU proponent of each subproject. The LGUs, in collaboration with DA and DENR, will implement\nenvironmental management measures. A streamlined procedure will be negotiated between DA\nand DENR to ensure that the environmental requirements of ADB and the Government will be met\nin a timely and satisfactory manner by LGU proponents of subprojects. Environmental monitoring\nwill be built into existing schemes for foreign-assisted projects with local participation such as that\nof NEDA. LGU and community stakeholders will be prepared so that they can take part in a\nmultipartite monitoring team. The cost of preparing the IEE or EIS will be met by the LGU.\n2.  Social Analysis\n133.  The provinces, cities, and municipalities included in the Project are among the poorest in\nthe nation by almost all measures of poverty and welfare. The project design ensures that the poor\nand low-income groups at least equally share in the distribution of the income growth benefit\n(Appendix 11).\n134.   There are groups of indigenous peoples in the project area. Most of their communities are\nin upland areas with steep slopes that are specifically excluded from subproject components for\nreasons of environmental vulnerability. However, should a subproject be developed in such an\narea,  the  Project  will  specifically  address  their  needs  through  an  indigenous  peoples  plan,\ndeveloped in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples.\n135.  The  resettlement  effects  are  not  anticipated  to  be  significant  in  the  Project;  however,\nreflecting the importance that ADB places on careful and effective implementation, a resettlement", "29\nand  compensation  plan  has  been  prepared  and  accepted  by  Government  (Supplementary\nAppendix E). The resettlement and compensation plan dictates, among other things, that people\nwhose land will be acquired or who will be resettled do not face a material reduction in incomes,\ndeterioration in living standards, or unnecessary social and cultural dislocations. The resettlement\nand compensation plan also identifies agencies responsible for implementing and monitoring the\nProjects\u2019  resettlement  plan  in  a  manner  consistent  with  Government  procedures  and  ADB\u2019s\nrequirements. In the project office, special expertise will also be available to look into resettlement,\nindigenous peoples, and other socioeconomic issues and concerns.\n136.  A gender analysis of the Project indicates that there will be no inequity on the basis of sex;\nalthough the lives of women and men will be affected in different ways, the benefits will reach all\n(e.g., there will be differential impacts on gender under the water supply subcomponent and, to a\ncertain extent, under the access infrastructure subcomponent).\nV .  JAPAN FUND FOR POVERTY REDUCTION GRANT\n137.  A grant project, Sustainable Livelihood for the Poor in Southern Philippines (SLPSP), aimed\nat the poor in the project area is being developed in conjunction with the Project. The SLPSP will\nenhance income-generating opportunities among the poor in targeted areas so that they can better\nbenefit from the improved infrastructure facilities financed under the Project. This will be achieved\nby supporting sustainable livelihood activities for the poor in 30-80 project municipalities.65 The 10\ncore subproject sites will comprise the first batch of livelihood assistance activities.\n138.  DA, through the project office, will be the Executing Agency for the SLPSP, which will be\nimplemented over a three-year period. The total cost of the SLPSP is estimated at $3.05 million\nequivalent, comprising $275,000 in foreign exchange costs and $2.78 million equivalent in local\ncurrency costs. ADB will administer $2.8 million equivalent, consisting of $150,000 in foreign\nexchange costs and $2.65 million equivalent in local currency costs. The SLPSP will be financed\non a grant basis from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR), funded by the Government of\nJapan. The Government, through the Project, will finance $125,000 in foreign exchange costs and\n$125,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.66  The  objectives,  scope,  implementation\narrangements, and cost estimates for the SLPSP are described in more detail in a separate JFPR\npaper.67\nV I.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial and Economic Analyses\n1.  Feasibility Studies of Core Subprojects\n139.  The Project is expected to increase crop production through the provision of irrigation which\nwill increase rice yields and cropping intensities. In addition, the costs of transport are expected to\ndecrease  and,  as  a  result,  farm  incomes  to  increase  in  the  areas  of  influence  of  the  roads\nupgraded  and/or  constructed.  With  improved  access  and  lower  transport  costs,  subsequent\nincreases  in  marketed  production  through  the  introduction  of  higher  value  crops  and  use  of\nadditional  purchased  inputs  are  anticipated.  Further  benefits  will  accrue  from  other  types  of\ninfrastructure investment, e.g., village water supply schemes that might be proposed as part of\nfuture project investments (Appendix 12).\n                                                \n65The objectives, scope, and activities for SLPSP were developed during two participatory workshops with NGOs,\npeoples\u2019  organizations,  and  representatives  of  potential  beneficiaries  financed  using  $9,500  from  RETA  5894:\nFacilitating Capacity Building and Participatory Activities II, for $400,000, approved on 28 December 1999.\n66DA has agreed to reserve 54 person-months of consulting services (financed by the Project) for undertaking\ncoordination and poverty impact monitoring activities under SLPSP.\n67 JFPR PHI: Sustainable Livelihood for the Poor in Southern Philippines (JPR:PHI 30552), for $2.8 million, was\napproved by the Government of Japan for financing under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction on 22 September\n2000 and is scheduled for Board consideration on 31 October 2000.", "30\n140.  Table 3 summarizes the returns from the 10 core subprojects for which feasibility studies\nwere  undertaken  during  project  formulation.  In  all  cases,  the  municipalities  and  cities  have\nproposed investments in rural roads, irrigation, or both. Investment costs range from the equivalent\nof $0.37 million to $2.29 million, and the economic returns from 14 to 59 percent. The very high\nreturns for the Surigao City subproject reflect low costs per hectare for the two irrigation schemes\nthat comprise the subproject. In both schemes, and elsewhere (e.g., Aloran, Bayugan, and San\nJose) there are high levels of sunk costs following the original development of the schemes. The\nreturns from road investments reflect the costs per kilometer for road construction, the size of the\narea of influence and its population, and existing and future modes of transport. Road costs per\nkilometer depend to a large extent on the distance aggregate has to be transported and the\nnumber of structures required.\nTable 3: Core Subproject Summary\nInvestment Costs Length of Roads Area of Irrigation EIRR\nSite ($ million) (kilometer) (hectare)  (percent)\nAloran 1.10 13.0 558 32\nBayugan 0.94 12.0 400 33\nCalbayog 1.06 14.0 0 15\nDolores 2.29 28.0 0 21\nHinunangan 0.37 12.2 0 14\nJiabong 0.86 14.0 0 15\nKapalong 1.21 20.0 290 20\nMainit 0.45 5.6 100 20\nSan Jose City 2.10 7.3 1,500 31\nSurigao City 0.42 0.0 596 59\n   EIRR = economic internal rate of return.\n2.  Approach\n141.  For irrigation development, the financial analysis shows the expected impact of Project\ninvestments on the income of households with average sized landholdings. The analysis also\nshows the impact of the Project on the cash flow of IAs responsible for operating and maintaining\nthe irrigation schemes and repaying the loan, equivalent to 30 percent of the investment. For\ninvestments in rural roads the expected impact on production at the farm level has been assessed\nconsidering savings in transport costs and the expected stimulus to crop production following the\nprovision of improved access.\n142.  The analysis assumes that the costs and benefits of the 10 core subprojects for which\nfeasibility studies have been undertaken will be representative of all those to be financed from\nproject resources. The economic analysis has been carried out in the national currency with traded\ngoods and services valued at either their free on board (fob) or cost, insurance, and freight (cif)\nvalues, as appropriate. The analysis uses a standard conversion factor (SCF)68 of 0.91 to re-value\nthe financial prices of all non-traded goods and services and a conversion factor for labor of 0.68.\nRecent data indicate that the opportunity cost of capital (OCC) is around 12 percent and the\nanalysis uses this value, although the analysis for the subprojects feasibility studies uses 15\npercent.69\n3.  Financial Analysis\n143.  For  rural  roads,  savings  in  transport  costs  will  be  highest  where  motorized  transport\nreplaces human and/or animal transport. Anticipated increases in crop production are based on\nexperience elsewhere in the project area. Savings in costs and increased production together will\n                                                \n68An alternative analysis using the shadow exchange rate factor was also undertaken. The results of this analysis are\nconsistent with the analysis described herein.\n69This  figure  is  used  to  allow  for  the  inclusion  of  the  costs  of  capacity  building,  and  project  coordination  and\nmanagement, which cannot easily be allocated to individual subprojects.", "31\nincrease average annual household incomes from crop production on average by P3,761 ($84) to\nP21,312 ($474), representing gains of 16-46 percent.\n144.  Incomes  from  crop  production  for  farmers  with  irrigated  holdings  will  be  expected  to\nincrease substantially (82-215 percent), reflecting higher yields per hectare and double cropping on\nthe land following investment in irrigation facilities. The expected project returns to labor are P229-\n338 ($5.1-7.5) per day, while incremental returns to incremental labor are more than three times\ncurrent daily wage rates of around P110 ($2.44). The income of IAs from irrigation fees equivalent\nto 50-570 kg per annum of unhulled rice at present prices should enable them to operate and\nmaintain  the  schemes  and  repay  their  loans  (30  percent  of  the  investment  costs  for  most\nschemes). The financial analyses show that there should be adequate incentives for farmers to\nincrease production following project investments in roads and irrigation.\n4.  Economic Analysis\n145.  The economic internal rates of return (EIRR) for individual road investments range from 14\nto 30 percent with an overall value of 19 percent. The analyses show that where the EIRR is at\nleast 20 percent, the returns are not unduly sensitive to changes in the key variables. Of the\nvariables analyzed, the results are most sensitive to the assumption concerning the average length\nof journey. Returns are less sensitive to the level of investment costs and savings in transport\ncosts. Transport cost savings vary widely and depend upon the extent to which higher-cost modes\nof transport (i.e., animal and human transport) are replaced by lower-cost motorized transport.\nFinally, returns are insensitive to the costs of maintenance or to the assumptions concerning the\nlevel  of  agricultural  output  as  nonagricultural  freight  and  passenger  traffic  provide  important\ncontributions to the savings in transport costs.\n146.  The investment in irrigation based on the subproject models gives an overall EIRR of\n34 percent. Project investments that will rehabilitate and/or extend existing schemes show higher\neconomic returns (up to 65 percent), as there are high levels of sunk costs, while the returns from\nnew construction are lower at 16 to 22 percent. Returns are mostly insensitive to changes in key\nvariables.  However,  if  the  future  rice  price  were  the  equivalent of  the  bottom  value  of  the\n70 percent probability range indicated by the World Bank, estimates of the viability of irrigation\ndevelopment would be seriously undermined, with only four schemes remaining marginally viable.\nScheme implementation should consider crop diversification as one way of reducing the risks\nassociated with possible reductions in future rice prices.\n147.  Assuming that the results of the core subprojects represent the potential returns from all\nproject investments and after including all the costs associated with capacity building and project\nmanagement  and  coordination,  the overall  EIRR  will  be  18  percent  with  net  present  values,\ndiscounted at 12 and 15 percent, respectively,70 of P=1,069 million and P=400 million.\n148.  Additional  analyses  have  also  been  prepared,  the  first  using  0.83  as  the  SCF  which\nincreases the EIRR to 19 percent,71 while the second assumes a 30 percent depreciation in the\nvalue of the peso, which will increase the return to 22 percent. A devaluation of the peso will raise\nthe Project\u2019s return as it will increase the import parity price of rice, a major incremental output.\n5.  Unquantified Benefits\n149.  While the financial and economic analyses are based on costs and benefits that can be\nidentified and quantified, significant unquantified benefits are also likely to flow from investments in\nroads and water supply. These will follow when communities have better access to clean water,\neducation, health facilities, and other services.\n                                                \n70The rate used by NEDA, although under review.\n71The value implied by the NEDA shadow exchange rate factor of 1.2.", "32\nB.  Estimated Impact on Poverty\n150.  The Project will be implemented in approximately 100 LGUs (1,200 villages) across the\nproject area. The geographic coverage and the selection criteria for LGU participants ensure that\nthe Project will provide infrastructure in rural areas where nearly half of the households are poor.\nBased on an analysis of the core subprojects, it is estimated that the Project will directly benefit\nsome 700,000 people (50 percent of which being poor) and indirectly benefit another 160,000\npeople (47 percent of which being poor). By project completion, at least 90,000 people should be\nlifted  out  of  poverty.  Approximately  1,000  person-years  of  incremental  employment  will  be\ngenerated, 57 percent of which is expected to benefit the poor.\n151.  However, only about 0.4 percent of the poverty-reduction impact can be attributed to the\nincome generated from construction or maintenance of the infrastructure, while the remaining 99.6\npercent is due to its usage. On a subsectoral basis, 67 percent of the long-term poverty-reduction\nimpact is due to access infrastructure (with approximately 51 percent of the investment cost), 19\npercent due to irrigation (with approximately 41 percent of the investment cost), and 14 percent\ndue to potable water supply (with approximately 8 percent of the investment cost). An analysis of\npotential beneficiaries shows that access infrastructure is the most effective way to reduce poverty\nin the rural Philippines, while irrigation shows the smallest impact. This is mainly because many\nirrigation  users  and  beneficiaries  are  not  below  the  poverty  line.  Additionally,  potable  water\nschemes are a highly effective means of addressing rural poverty in the Philippines, although most\nof the impact is on income poverty (additional time for agricultural production) rather than human\npoverty (reduction in waterborne diseases).\n152.  The Project will have only marginal poverty-reduction impact at the national level (an\nestimated reduction from 35.7 percent of rural poverty incidence in 2000 to 35.6 percent in 2008).\nAt the village and municipal level, however, the poverty-reduction impact will be substantial: from\nestimated  60  percent  incidence  in  2000  to  49  percent  in  2008  for  the  targeted  villages  and\nmunicipalities.  Appendix  11  provides  a  summary  poverty  impact  assessment  including  the\nunderlying assumptions.\nC.  Social Dimensions\n153.  A social impact assessment was conducted during project formulation. During this process,\ncomprehensive consultations with beneficiaries were undertaken and surveys were carried out in\nall core subproject sites. Through the provision of improved rural road infrastructure, the Project will\ndirectly and indirectly help reduce poverty in the project area. Improved accessibility will lead to\nmore reliable and efficient flow of goods and people, incentives to increase agricultural production,\nand  increased  labor  mobility,  all  of  which  will  result  in  additional  employment  and  incomes\n(Appendix 11).\n154.  Indirect social benefits to communities that gain access through better roads will include (i)\nimproved educational attendance by primary and secondary school students, and (ii) better access\nto health facilities. In addition, specific measures have been included in the project design and\nimplementation  arrangements  to  ensure  that  employment  and  business  opportunities  will  be\nprovided  to  local  people  to  enhance  their  incomes  by  participating  in  road  rehabilitation  and\nmaintenance activities.\n155.  Construction  and  rehabilitation  of  small  irrigation  schemes  will  increase  agricultural\nproduction significantly. Irrigation can provide farmers with one additional crop per year. As the\ncriteria for selecting subprojects include poverty indicators, small-scale farmers will benefit from the\nProject in particular. Increased agricultural production will also benefit landless farmers as it is\nanticipated that middle size and large farmers will require additional labor input.\n156.  The Project will benefit women in particular by improving access to drinking water. The\nprovision of water supplies can reduce the time spent collecting water and can lead to better health\nboth through the quality of drinking water and improved hygiene.", "33\nD.  Project Risks\n157.  With a history of poor revenue collection, the Government faces frequent budget deficits.\nWith devolution, LGUs are increasingly burdened with new responsibilities for which they often do\nnot have adequate counterpart funds for investment or maintenance. This is particularly true for the\npoorer LGUs, which are the main recipients of investment under the Project. Furthermore, the\nfunds that the LGUs will be required to contribute to the financing of subprojects could result in\ncrowding out of other necessary investments, particularly in the social sectors. This could result in\ndelays in project implementation and have a negative impact on other LGU and Government\ndevelopment and poverty reduction goals.\n158.  Devolution of agricultural services and rural infrastructure facilities to LGUs as provided by\nthe LGC and AFMA presents both a challenge and an opportunity. While devolution moves project\nidentification and implementation closer to beneficiaries, it also introduces an additional element of\nuncertainty,  particularly  as  regards  commitment  and  capability.  The  financial,  technical,  and\nmanagerial capacity of LGUs to implement these projects is recognized to be limited. LGUs,\nhowever, are in the best position to make sure that subprojects are located and designed most\nappropriately and involve the beneficiaries themselves in the identification of needs and O&M of\nthe completed facilities. Experience has clearly shown that the Government cannot effectively carry\nout these functions.\n159.  The  risks  arising  from  the  implementation  capacity  of  the  LGUs,  changes  in  political\nleadership  and  priorities,  and  the  maintenance  capability  of  LGUs  and  of  the  beneficiaries\nthemselves will be mitigated by timely, appropriate, and effective capability-building activities that\nthe  Project  will  finance.  Participatory  planning,  as  implemented  under  IRAP,  will  ensure  that\nbeneficiary  communities  are  committed  to  the  subproject.  This  commitment  will  result  in\nsubprojects that are less susceptible to political change, more likely to be maintained properly, and\nappropriate to the implementation capacity of the LGU.\nVI I.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n160.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the Loan Agreement:\n(i)  Operations Manual.  Within two months of loan effectivity, DA will prepare an\noperations manual acceptable to ADB.

As part of the process of selecting an LGU and subproject\nto be included in the Project, satisfaction of the following conditions will be required:\n(a)  The  LGU  will  have  adequate  financial  and  organizational  capability  and\ncommitment to participate in the Project and the total investment cost of the\nproposed subproject will be between $250,000 and $5 million equivalent.\n(b)  A comprehensive feasibility study will have been prepared, appraised, and\napproved by the PCU.  This study will include an assessment by MDFO of\nthe financial capability of the LGU to ensure that adequate resources are\navailable for proper maintenance of infrastructure.\n(c)  The LGU will have entered into an implementation agreement with DA (with\nterms and conditions satisfactory to ADB), including the commitment of the\nLGU to provide (i) the necessary equity contribution, in cash or in kind; and\n(ii)  the  necessary  O&M  for  the  subproject  facilities  after  completion  of\nconstruction.", "34\n(d)  If the LGU obtains financing from MDFO to fund any of its share of the\ninvestment cost of its subproject, the LGU (at the relevant level) will have\nentered into a subloan agreement with MDFO specifying the obligations of\nthe LGU in accordance with the provisions of the operations manual.\n(e)  For any subproject that costs more than $500,000 equivalent, DA will have\nsubmitted the subproject\u2019s feasibility study to ADB for prior approval.\n(f)  If the subproject includes CIS construction or rehabilitation, an IA will have\nbeen established and be operational. If the subproject includes construction\nor improvement of a potable water supply system, a VWSA will have been\nestablished and will be operational.\n(g)  If the subproject involves any resettlement, a full resettlement plan (if the\nnumber of affected persons is 200 or more) or a short resettlement plan (if\nfewer than 200 persons are affected), in accordance with the relevant laws\nand  regulations,  the  resettlement  plan  prepared  for  the  Project\n(Supplementary Appendix E), and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement,\nwill have been prepared.\n(h)  If  any  indigenous  peoples  are  likely  to  be  affected  significantly  under  a\nsubproject, an indigenous peoples plan will be prepared in accordance with\nrelevant laws and regulations and with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples.\n(i)  For  a  subproject  involving  road,  irrigation,  flood,  and/or  drainage\ninfrastructure (i) an IEE will have been prepared as part of the detailed\ndesign and feasibility, in accordance with applicable environmental laws and\nregulations and relevant ADB guidelines; (ii) the IEE will be forwarded to\nADB  for  approval  on  a  no-objection  basis  for  any  subproject  in  an\nenvironmentally  sensitive  area  or  which  costs  in  excess  of  $1  million\nequivalent;  and  (iii)  the  subproject  will  be  designed  on  the  basis  of\nenvironmental standards acceptable to ADB.\n(iii)  Irrigators\u2019 Associations and Village Waterworks and Sanitation Associations.\nThe Government will ensure that IAs and VWSAs are strengthened to manage O&M\nof CIS and potable water supply improvements made under the Project and to\nrecover O&M and, as applicable, investment costs through beneficiary contributions\nin kind and/or cash.\n(iv)  Counterpart Contributions. The LGUs will maintain the infrastructure provided\nunder the Project, including providing specific budget allocations for O&M costs. The\nGovernment will ensure the (i) timely release of adequate budgetary allocations for\nall counterpart funds required for project implementation; (ii) timely selection of the\nrequired number of subprojects for project participation in accordance with criteria\nagreed  with  ADB;  and  (iii)  participating  LGUs\u2019  provision  of  local  counterpart\ncontributions (cash or in-kind) from their own resources to finance the costs of the\nsubprojects within their respective municipalities in accordance with the terms and\nconditions  of  such  cost-sharing  arrangements  detailed  in  the  implementation\nagreements and/or subloan agreements.\n(v)  Subproject  Implementation.  Each  LGU  will  undertake,  in  accordance  with\ncomprehensive  participatory  methodologies  detailed  in  the  operations  manual,\nadequate  planning,  design,  and  construction  activities.    Each  LGU  will  engage\nindividuals in its subproject area as priority providers of labor for the subproject.\n(vi)  Operation and Maintenance.

Introduction\n1.  The primary component of the Project is improving rural infrastructure. Rural infrastructure\nincludes rural roads and other transport links, communal irrigation systems, and potable water\nsupply facilities. Ten core subprojects have been identified and assessed in terms of resettlement\nand land acquisition issues. The assessment indicated that none of the 10 core subprojects are\nexpected to have a significant impact in terms of resettlement.\n2.  The summary resettlement plan provides an estimate of cost based on design data for two\ncore subprojects, the first in the municipality of Kapalong, Davao del Norte, and the second in the\nmunicipality of Mainit, Surigao del Norte. Additional survey work will need to be prepared to assess\nthe land acquisition requirements when the design work has been finalized for all subprojects.\n3.  For subprojects where resettlement impacts are anticipated, the resettlement plan will be\nupdated prior to commencing works. Receipt of the updated final resettlement plan acceptable to\nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be a condition for commencing construction.\nB.  Resettlement Policy\n4.  Resettlement will be implemented according to legislation of the Government of Philippines\nand in accordance with ADB policy on involuntary resettlement (November 1995).  The basis under\nthe Constitution and laws of the Republic of the Philippines are as follows: (i) The 1987 Philippine\nConstitution;  (ii)  Executive  Order  1035  (1985);  (iii)  Administrative  Order  65,  Series  of  1983;\n(iv) Republic Act 6389; and (iv) Administrative Order 50 (1999).\nC. Minimization of Resettlement Impact\n5.  The Project will adopt a policy of minimizing adverse resettlement impacts and reducing the\nnumber  of  affected  persons  by  continuously  reviewing  the  design  to  further  minimize  land\nacquisition and resettlement requirements.\nD.  Resettlement Impacts\n6.  There is only insignificant impact in terms of resettlement in the two core subprojects\nassessed. In the Mainit subproject, 23 people are likely to be affected. The Mainit subproject has\ntwo components: communal irrigation, and construction and rehabilitation of rural roads (9.4 km).\nThree people are likely to be affected because of relocation of their residences and acquisition of\nagricultural land; 19 landowners and 1 tenant farmer are likely to be affected by land acquisition for\nthe rural road projects. The total land for acquisition for road right-of-way is 1.26 ha.\n7.  In  the  municipality  of  Kapalong  subproject,  20  people  are  likely  to  be  affected.  The\ncomponents of the subproject consist of upgrading of rural roads with a total length of 24.5 km\nexpansion  of  two  communal  irrigation  systems,  and  construction  of  one  communal  irrigation\nsystem. Eight people are likely to be affected by the relocation of their residential households and\n12 are likely to be affected by land acquisition for the irrigation projects. One person whose house\nneeds relocation may lose livelihood and income. Total land acquisition is about 3 ha affecting 12\npeople for the construction of a communal irrigation system dam and the construction of a bridge.\nE.  Resettlement Principles and Entitlements\n8.  Consistent with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s policy, affected people will be assisted to\nmaintain their original standard of living, at a level at least equal to what they enjoyed prior to the\nProject. All possible means will be explored to minimize resettlement impacts through modification\nof the engineering designs. This will be carried out in close consultation with the affected people.\nPlans for acquisition of land and other assets will be implemented in consultation with the affected", "52\nAppendix 8, page 2\npeople to ensure minimal disturbance. Financial and physical resources for compensation will be\nmade available as and when required.\n9.  Affected people may resettle themselves or will be resettled in close proximity to their\nvillages. Legal owners and tenants of land will be compensated and assisted with rehabilitation. No\nworks under any contract awarded under the Project will commence until all required funds are\nmade available to the concerned land acquisition collector and compensation payments and/or\nother assistance have been made available to the affected persons.\n10.  When the design of subprojects have been finalized and if there are resettlement\nimpacts, an entitlement matrix will be prepared for each subproject in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nresettlement policy. An independent review of the resettlement operation will be commissioned by\nADB after completion of the Project to assess whether the affected people have regained or\nimproved their livelihoods and standards of living.\nF. Consultations and Grievance Procedures\n11.  Social  preparation  is  an  essential  part  of  the  planning  and  implementation  of  the\nresettlement  process.    The  process  will  include  formal  participation  of  the  community  in\nestablishing road alignments and irrigation sites, meeting with affected people to inform them of the\nbenefit of the project, the impact on them, and their entitlements to compensate them for their\nlosses. The village chairman will be responsible for social preparation in his or her village. The\nlocal government unit (LGU) and village officials will enlist the assistance of local nongovernment\norganizations to inform the affected persons of the impacts of the project, their entitlements and\nrehabilitation options under the resettlement action plan.\n12.  Grievance procedures will be established. Affected people will present their complaints\nto the village council. If they are not satisfied with the village council\u2019s response, they may appeal\nto the LGU\u2019s project steering committee (PSC) or the mayor if no PSC has been established. If the\naffected people do not find the decision of the PSC or the mayor satisfactory, the case may be\nsubmitted for consideration to the Department of Agriculture\u2019s project coordination unit.\nG. Implementation Arrangements\n13.  If  resettlement  impacts  from  a  subproject  are  anticipated,  a  resettlement  coordination\ncommittee (RCC)1 will be responsible for planning and implementing all activities related to the\nresettlement action plan in the LGU. This committee will be part of the subproject or the subproject\nmonitoring board. The RCC will report to the LGU\u2019s project steering committee, which assumes\noverall responsibility for enforcement of the resettlement action plan.\n14.  The  project  steering  committee  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  the\nresettlement plan. Quarterly monitoring reports will be submitted during project implementation and\nan evaluation report before project completion.\nH.  Cost\n15.  For purposes of illustration, the estimated resettlement cost of the Mainit subproject is\nP452,650  and  the  estimated  resettlement  cost  of  the  Kapalong  subproject  is  P720,000.  The\nresettlement  cost  for  each  individual  subproject  will  be  determined  when  the  design  of  the\nsubproject is finalized.  The full costs of resettlement and compensation will be the responsibility of\nthe LGU.\n                  \n1 The RCC includes local government officials, barangay officials, representatives of affected persons, and NGO\nrepresentatives.", "53\nAppendix 9, page 1\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS\n1.

Poverty and Social Characteristics\n1.  During  the  15  years  prior  to  the  Asian  economic  crises,  poverty  incidence  in  the\nPhilippines had declined by 12.1 percent. In 1997, the latest year for which Family Income and\nExpenditure Survey data are available, 32.1 percent or 4.5 million families had income below\nthe poverty threshold, and 44.4 percent of rural households (equivalent to 51.2 percent of the\nrural population) fell below the threshold. By headcount, 37.5 percent of the population was\nbelow the poverty line in 1997, equivalent to 27.25 million people.1 In the project area, the\npoverty incidence ranges between 49.0 and 63.6 percent, which is substantially higher than the\nnational average of 37.5 percent.2 The severity of poverty is also higher. Between 24 and 37\npercent of the population in the project area are severely poor with income under the food\nthreshold, compared to 20 percent for the Philippines as a whole (Table A11.1). Rural poverty is\nmost  common  among  (i)  lowland  landless  agricultural  workers,  tenants,  and  leaseholders;\n(ii) lowland small farm owners and cultivators; (iii) upland farmers on steeply sloped land; and\n(iv) fisherfolk.\n2.  Social  indicators  are  also  low  in  the  Project  area:  the  average  value  of  the  life\nexpectancy index for the Philippines is 0.72, and the lowest value in one of the provinces of the\nproject area (Tawi-Tawi) is 0.47.  The project area has higher than average infant mortality than\nthe nation as a whole and the infant mortality rate in the project regions include the worst in the\nPhilippines. Diaerrheal diseases are the main cause of death among children younger than five,\nwith lack of clean water supplies clearly contributing to a high infant mortality rate. The human\ndevelopment  index  (HDI)  ranges  between  0.491  for  the  Autonomous  Region  of  Muslim\nMindanao and 0.673 for the island provinces of Southern Tagalog, compared to 0.740 for the\nPhilippines as a whole.3\n3.  Smallholder agricultural potential is constrained by (i) unequal land distribution; (ii) lack\nof access to basic inputs, transport, and storage facilities; (iii) the general decline of agricultural\nextension services; (iv) difficulty in accessing markets; and (v) risks due to natural calamities\nsuch as La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o. The average size of farms tilled by the landless is 0.75 hectares\n(ha) and the average landholding is 1.5 ha, with the poor farmers having land holdings of\nbetween 1.0 and 2.5 ha. Land is more equitably distributed in Mindanao than in Eastern Visayas\nand Bicol. Common crops produced by landless farmers and smallholders are rice, coconut,\ncorn, and vegetables. Periods of extreme deprivation occur when there is no work at all, usually\nbetween the planting and harvesting seasons. Only a few have access to agricultural equipment\nand facilities. Due to their low income, the poor often depend on larger landowners for credit to\ncover as much as 80 percent of their required farm inputs such as seed and fertilizer. The cost\nof fertilizer in 1998-1999 was reported to have increased in the Philippines by 30 percent to as\nmuch as 60 percent.4\n                                                          \n1  These data differ significantly from international data based on the $1 per day per capita expenditure on\nconsumption level equitable to 2,400 kcal. Based on World Bank (2000) criteria, the incidence of poverty has\nincreased from 24.7 percent in 1997 to 26.3 percent in 1999. This increase was due to the Asian financial crisis\nand the long drought and La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon. It is estimated that the country has 26.3 million poor people today,\nup from 18.2 million in 1997.\n2  Data for Southern Tagalog are biased toward the richer provinces. The selected island provinces in Region IV\ncovered by the Project have high incidences of poverty at between 45 and 55 percent.\n3  Poverty data are available only at the regional level, whereas HDI data have been generated at the provincial level.\n4  Reyes, Celia M., A.

Families in the upland areas, often indigenous peoples, are particularly poor. These\ncommunities  mainly  suffer  from  the  perils  and  risks  posed  by  bad  roads  and  nonexistent\nbridges. In the upland areas of the project area, particularly in Mindanao, residents walk, use\nanimals, or use motorcycles as the basic modes of transportation. This is inefficient and the\ncosts are high, primarily due to the limited capacity to carry agricultural products. Motorcycle\noperators usually demand high fares even for short distances. The poor and smallholders\ndepend heavily on the motorcycles, which are often the only way of marketing their products. To\nreduce expenditures, women and child labor (often unpaid) is used for transporting agricultural\nproducts to markets. As a result, children are often absent from school or drop out. Improved\ntransportation is particularly important for reducing income and human poverty among these\nupland residents.\n5.  In fishing communities, low productivity is associated with low fish stocks, resulting from\nuncontrolled and often illegal fishing and poaching, the control of which is often not enforced. In\nthe coastal areas, a day\u2018s catch only fetches an average income of P50, which is not sufficient\nfor  the  household\u2019s  daily  food  requirements.  Some  fisherfolk  have  expressed  the  need  to\nestablish fish sanctuaries, construct landing and storage facilities, and have access to financial\nassistance for the acquisition of boats and other fishing provisions. However, poverty in fishing\ncommunities may only be overcome by providing new income opportunities as alternatives to\ntraditional fishing.\nB.  Social Dimensions\n1.  Vulnerability of Women and Children\n6.  The generally favorable indicators of women\u2019s education, health, and work participation\nin  the  Philippines  mask  a  number  of  gender  issues.  Women  in  rural  areas  are  typically\nresponsible for the household, the children, and small livestock. In fishing communities they are\noften responsible for selling fish. Single parent households, composed of widows and widowers,\nmany of whom are elderly, depend on farming and pension pay for their subsistence. Others\nrely on the support of children working as domestic servants in towns and cities.", "62\nAppendix 11, page 3\n7.  Women and children (both sexes) are also often responsible for fetching water. The\nprovision of water supply can reduce the time spent collecting water and can lead to better\nhealth, both through the quality of drinking water and improved hygiene. It can, however, also\nlead to environmental and health problems if proper drainage and sanitation are not used.\nRoads are of particular benefit to women, providing better access to education and health\nservices, to vendors of household goods, and to markets for small livestock.\n2.  Indigenous People\n8.  The project area in Mindanao comprises a good number of the indigenous peoples and\nthe settlers (mainly from Cebu and the Visayas). In the past, indigenous peoples depended\nheavily on forest resources for food, as they are traditionally hunters and gatherers. Many of\nthem are now subsistence farmers, using the slash-and-burn system. Common crops grown are\ncoconut, coffee, and sweet potato. However, mainly because of poor access infrastructure,\nmany  indigenous  peoples  live  outside  the  regular  market  economy  and  out  of  reach  of\nagricultural  extension  and  health  and  education  services.  Poor  market  access,  forest\ndegradation, health problems, and illiteracy are still the principal causes of their deprivation and\nimpoverishment.\n3.  Resettlement Issues\n9.  Resettlement  effects  are  not  anticipated  to  be  significant  in  the  Project.  However,\nreflecting the importance the Asian Development Bank (ADB) places on careful and effective\nimplementation,  a  resettlement  and  compensation  plan  will  be  prepared  based  on  ADB\nguidelines. A summary resettlement plan is in Appendix 8.\n4.  Participatory Development\n10.  The project design is driven by the needs and demands of the communities that lack the\ninfrastructure important for them to realize the productive potential of their land. Subproject\nselection is based on participatory consultations at the village level in conjunction with the\nmunicipal administration and local nongovernment organizations and peoples\u2019 organizations.\nThese stakeholders will also be involved in project preparation, implementation, and monitoring\nand evaluation. Women will have an equal opportunity to participate in project activities, and\nthey will be adequately represented in training and other project activities.\nC.  Expected Poverty Reduction Impact of the Project5\n11.  The economic impacts of infrastructure projects have been identified as follows: lower\nprices, better marketing opportunities, higher profits (the price level for fruit and vegetables is\napproximately 20 percent higher at town markets than at local market), more employment\nopportunities (including construction and maintenance of project roads), all leading to higher\ngross domestic product growth rate. Improved access to drinking water will not only improve\nhealth standards, but also reduce the time spent on collecting water. Without the basic road\ninfrastructure, it is difficult to access health and educational services, which are presently\ninaccessible in much of the project area. While most direct benefits are in the form of reduced\ntransportation costs, the profits of middlemen acting as intermediates between the farmers and\nthe market (and currently dominating the marketing structure in some project areas) will be\nmore equally shared among the poor.\n12.  The project will be implemented in approximately 1,200 villages of 100 municipalities\nand cities in the project regions. In 2000, 36.2 million people were living in the project area, of\n                                                          \n5  Supplementary  Appendix  G  provides  a  more  detailed  description  of  the  distribution  and  poverty  impact\nassessment.", "63\nAppendix 11, page 4\nwhich 18 million (almost 50 percent) were poor.6 Table A11.2 provides detailed information on\ndistribution of population in the project area and the incidence of poverty.\n13.  Based  on  an  analysis  of  the  10  core  subprojects,  the  labor  market  impact  of  the\ninfrastructure construction, upgrading, rehabilitation, and maintenance is estimated at 319,900\nperson-days  (equivalent  to  1,064  person-years)  during  project  implementation.  About  50\npercent (532 person-years) is due to maintenance. It is assumed that 85 percent of the workers\nin access infrastructure, 40 percent of the communal irrigation, and 70 percent of the potable\nwater are poor. Hence, total labor market benefits for the poor is 8,530 persons (60 percent of\nall persons engaged) or 605 person-years (57 percent).\n14.  More than half (50.4 percent) of the labor created is due to maintenance and this is\nparticularly high for the access infrastructure component (85 percent). For sustainable poverty\nreduction impact, it is therefore important that labor for maintenance is paid wherever possible.\nThe Project will ensure that maintenance costs for access infrastructure, which is mostly labor,\nwill be included in the yearly maintenance budget of local government units.\n15.  Based on the 10 core subprojects, it is estimated that the Project will directly benefit\nsome 700,000 people (49.5 percent of which being poor) and indirectly benefit about 160,000\npeople (46.9 percent of which being poor). For access infrastructure it is assumed that all\ninhabitants of the targeted villages will benefit directly (over a period of 4 years), whereas an\nadditional 20 percent of other road users will benefit. About 50 percent of the direct and 20\npercent of the indirect beneficiaries will be the poor.7 In the case of communal irrigation, 40\npercent of the direct beneficiaries will be poor while 80 percent of the indirect beneficiaries will\nbe poor (a result of the increased demand for agricultural short-term labor due to the additional\ncropping). For the potable water schemes everybody in the village will benefit equally but there\nis only small indirect impact; hence, 60 percent of the direct beneficiaries will be the poor.\nBased on these assumptions a total (direct and indirect) of approximately 676,000 people will\nbenefit from access infrastructure (46 percent of which being poor), approximately 147,000\npeople  will  benefit  from  communal  irrigation  (60  percent  of  which  being  poor),  and\napproximately 42,000 people will benefit from potable water schemes (60 percent of which\nbeing poor).\n16.  While the Project has positive poverty reduction impact on poor people in the project\narea, only about 22 percent of all poor targeted under the Project will be lifted out of poverty on\na sustainable basis by the end of 2007. The majority of the sustainable poverty reduction impact\nis  due  to  additional  income  opportunities  generated  for  the  poor  through  the  use  and\nmaintenance the infrastructure\n17.  On a subsectoral basis, 67.1 percent of the sustainable poverty reduction impact is due\nto access infrastructure (which comprises 51 percent of the investment costs), 19.4 percent\nfrom communal irrigation (comprising 41.4 percent of the investment costs), and 13.5 percent\ncan be attributed to the potable water schemes (comprising 7.6 percent of the investment\ncosts).    One  can  therefore  conclude  that,  among  the  project  subcomponents,  access\ninfrastructure is the most effective way to reduce poverty. At the village and municipal level, the\nProject  will  substantially  contribute  to  poverty  reduction,  from  an  estimated  60.0  percent\nincidence in 2000 to an estimated 48.9 percent in 2008.

General Approach to Financial and Economic Analysis\n1.  Financial and economic analyses have been carried out for the 10 core subprojects developed\nduring  the  project  formulation.  These  analyses  review  the  components  of  each  individual  pilot\nsubproject as well as the Project as a whole.\n1.  Financial Analysis\n2.  Financial analyses were carried out from the viewpoint of the participant farming households\nand irrigator\u2019s associations (IAs).1 For irrigation development the analysis shows the expected impact\nof project investments in providing an assured supply of water on the income from crop production for\na household with an average sized holding. The analysis also shows the impact of operations and\nmaintenance (O&M) costs, loan repayments, and income from irrigation fees on the cash flow of the\nIAs responsible for operating and maintaining the communal irrigation schemes. For investments in\nrural  roads  the  expected  impact  on  production  at  the  farm  level  has  been  assessed  based  on\nexperience elsewhere in the project area.\n2.  Economic Analysis\n3.  The economic analysis for the Project assumes that the costs and benefits of the 10 core\nsubprojects for which feasibility studies have been undertaken will be representative of all those to be\nfinanced from the Project loan. The period of analysis for each year\u2019s infrastructure investment is 20\nyears, reflecting the economic life of rural roads and communal irrigation systems and communal\nirrigation projects.2\n4.  The Asian Development Bank normally uses 12 percent as the opportunity cost of capital\n(OCC) for its developing member countries. Using the model developed by the Harvard Institute for\nInternational Development (HIID)3 the OCC was 11.5 percent in 1993 and more recent economic data\ngives a figure of around 12 percent. This latter figure has been used when assessing the economic\nviability of the Project. However, this analysis uses 15 percent when assessing the viability of the\nsubprojects and their components. Such an approach allows for the inclusion of the costs of capacity\nbuilding and project coordination and management that are required to realize the benefits of the\nsubproject investments and  can not be allocated to individual subprojects. Therefore, all subproject\ninvestments should show a minimum economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 15 percent to be\neligible for funding from project sources to give an overall project return in excess of 12 percent.\n5.  The economic analysis has been carried out in the national currency with traded goods and\nservices valued at either their free on board (fob) or cost, insurance, and freight (cif) values, as\nappropriate. The World Bank Commodity Markets and the Developing Countries report (April 2000)\nhas been used to provide price estimates for those project commodities that are widely traded (rice\nand fertilizers). Using the model developed by HIID3 and 1997 data (the latest available) gives 0.91 as\nthe standard  conversion factor (SCF) and the analysis uses this value to revalue the financial prices\nof all nontraded goods and services. For unskilled labor the economic analysis uses the financial\nopportunity cost based on the prevailing wage rates in the subproject areas (i.e., P110/day reduced to\nP90/day) to reflect the extent to which labor is unemployed or underemployed multiplied by the SCF.\nOn this basis the conversion factor for labor is 0.68 equivalent to an economic cost of P75 per day.\n \n                                                    \n1  Supplementary Appendix A contains analyses of each core subproject.\n2  No potable water supply scheme was submitted as part of a core subproject proposal. However, some water supply\nschemes are expected to be financed under the Project and a model for the financial and economic analysis of water\nsupply schemes has been prepared and is included in this appendix.\n3 Economic Parameters for the Appraisal of Investment Projects: Bangladesh, Indonesia and Philippines, December 1993.", "66\nAppendix 12, page 2\n6.   The sensitivity analyses for the subproject components were based on the calculation of the\nsensitivity index and switching values for key variables. A sensitivity analysis has also been run for the\nwhole project using the values that the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) uses\nfor the OCC and SCF, as for national planning purposes it is desirable that all projects are assessed\nusing the same national parameters. According to NEDA, the SCF is 0.83 (reflecting a shadow\nexchange rate factor of 1.20) and the OCC is 15 percent.4\nB.  Project Cost Estimates\n7.  The  project  cost  estimates,  including  contingencies,  were  the  basis  of  the  financial  and\neconomic analyses and were prepared using the Costab software. Estimated costs for all components\n(including all the costs associated with capacity building), but after deducting the price contingencies,\nwere converted to economic values by subtracting all transfer payments and multiplying the local\ncurrency costs (i.e., costs of nontraded items) by the SCF. Costs of capacity building and project\nmanagement will not continue beyond the end of the project period (7 years). Project costs include the\ncosts of salaries of all government staff required by project activities whether such staff are hired\nspecifically on contract or are already employed.5 Net project benefits include the incremental O&M\ncosts required for project investments to continue to operate throughout their economic life.\nC.  Detailed Assumptions for the Analysis of Project Components\n8.  The Project is expected to increase crop production through the provision of irrigation which\nwill increase rice yields, cropping intensities, and the use of inputs. In addition, the costs of transport\nare expected to decrease, and as a result, farm incomes to increase in the areas of influence of the\nroads upgraded and/or constructed with project assistance. With improved access and lower transport\ncosts subsequent increases in marketed production are anticipated through the introduction of higher\nvalue crops and use of additional purchased inputs. Further benefits will accrue from time savings\nfrom  potable  water  supply  schemes  and  decreased  disease  and  sickness  from  improved  water\nquality.\n1.  Rural Roads\n9.  Reconstruction  of  existing  and  construction  of  new  roads  will  result  in  reduced  vehicle\noperating costs (VOCs) due to (i) the lower cost per kilometer traveled following improvement to the\nroad surface; and (ii) the shift to more cost-effective modes of transport (e.g., water buffalo sledge to\njeepney).  The  economic  analysis  calculates  the  savings  in  the  cost  per  ton/kilometer  and  per\nperson/kilometer using (i) standard data from the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH),\nand (ii) subproject specific data from each subproject. The main assumptions used are as follows:\n(i)  For motorized transport average VOCs are based on October 1999 DPWH standard\nfigures expressed in economic prices for different means of transport under different\nroad conditions. These values allow for the fact that not all vehicles are commercially\noperated  and  that  savings  in  VOCs  do  not  necessarily  always  transfer  into  fleet\nreduction costs. The time cost element only takes account of the likely proportion of\npassengers who are traveling during working time or to and from work valuing this time\nat 100 percent and 50 percent respectively of the appropriate wage rates. It does not\ninclude the value of leisure time saved. VOCs per kilometer are converted into values\nper ton kilometer and per person kilometer.\n(ii)  For nonmotorized transport (e.g., boat and water buffalo sledge) costs are based on\ndata collected during the visits to the subproject areas for the average costs charged\nby  the  operators  in  the  subproject  areas  multiplied  by  the  SCF  and  for  transport\ninvolving porters the costs are multiplied by the labor conversion factor.\n                                                    \n4 NEDA is currently reviewing the parameters it uses for economic analysis.\n5 For the economic analysis the costs of local government unit staff are assumed to be non incremental.", "67\nAppendix 12, page 3\n(iii)  In the absence of data from traffic surveys, the volume of agricultural freight generated\nby each road without the project is based on data provided by the municipal (or city)\nagricultural offices concerning the following parameters: size of the area of influence,\nthe  cropping  pattern,  average  yield  per  hectare,  use  of  inputs  per  hectare,  the\nproportion of crop production transported, and the means of transport used. With the\nproject, some increase in both the production and thus the quantity transported are\nprojected as a result of the road improvements and/or construction. Estimates are\nbased  on  recent  experience  in  the  project  area  where  rural  roads  have  been\nconstructed.6 These estimates do not include any increased production that might\nfollow from subsequent development programs (e.g., the provision of agricultural credit\nservices or processing facilities) for which the costs are at present unknown.\n(iv)  Standard DPWH per capita data are used to calculate the volume of nonagricultural\nfreight transported and for the number of journeys made by people with and without the\nproject. These values depend upon the road conditions and the population in the area\nof influence and are adjusted in line with the expected growth in population in each\nsubproject area.\n(v)  For each road the average length of journey has been estimated and used to calculate\nthe total volume of produce shipped measured as tons per kilometer. The length of\njourney depends upon the location of the road in relation to the areas of production and\nmarkets.\n(vi)  VOC savings for freight are based on the without project freight volumes, i.e., average\nsaving per tons per kilometer multiplied by the total numbers of tons per kilometer\nshipped without the project.\n(vii)  VOC savings for passengers are calculated similarly, i.e., the volume of passenger\ntraffic without the project multiplied by the average saving per passenger kilometers.\n(viii)  Generated benefits for both freight and passengers are equal to the area between the\ntransport demand curve and the with project VOC over the range from the without-\nproject volume to the with-project volume. With a straight line demand curve, this area\nis the triangle with an area of 50 percent of the incremental volume multiplied by the\nunit price reduction; this approximation is used to estimate generated benefits for both\npassenger and freight traffic.\n(ix)  Site-specific estimates of investment costs, including physical contingencies and the\ncosts of detailed design and supervision of construction have been prepared for each\nroad. Investment costs have been converted to economic values by excluding taxes\nand multiplying the local cost element by the SCF. Investment is expected to take\nplace over two years with maintenance costs starting in year three. Any without project\nmaintenance costs would be saved and are included as a benefit. Maintenance costs\nhave been estimated by the project preparatory technical assistance engineers at\nP87,000 to P95,000 per km.\n(x)  In the feasibility studies, key variables for which switching values have been calculated\nto assess the sensitivity of the economic analysis to changes in the assumptions are\ninvestment and O&M costs, agricultural output, length of average journey, and savings\nin freight and passenger transport costs.\n                                                    \n6 Experience from Loan 1332-PHI: Rural Infrastructure Development Project, for $17.5 million, approved on 10 November\n1994, has shown that simple provision/improvement of rural roads (in areas with high agricultural potential) can result in a\n16 percent increase in rice production and a 35 percent increase in corn production, a major upland crop, after one year\nfollowing the construction of rural roads.", "68\nAppendix 12, page 4\n10.  The extent to which the savings in transport costs are passed on to the farmer and the extent\nto which farmers are encouraged to increase production and or switch to higher value crops will\ndepend  upon  several  factors  including  the  types  of  crops  grown,  proximity  to  markets,  market\ndemand, the extent to which traders move into the newly accessible areas, and the degree of\ncompetition between traders and haulers.\n11.  The approach of the financial analysis has been to assess the likely benefits to farmers based\non experience in the subproject areas and elsewhere in the project area where rural roads have been\nconstructed  in  the  absence  of  other  major  complementary  investments.  Incremental  income  is\nassumed to come from two sources: increased crop production and savings in transport costs. As for\nthe economic analysis, increases in crop production are based on a 16 percent increase for rice and\n35 percent for upland crops.7 For savings in transport costs the analysis uses data from the subproject\nareas collected during visits to the subproject areas and from elsewhere in the project area where\nroads have recently been constructed.8 According to this data, where animal and human transport has\nbeen replaced with motorized transport in the rice growing areas, farmers have experienced an 80\npercent reduction in transport costs for farm outputs and inputs. In the upland areas the figure is 50\npercent where animal transport is a major mode of transport.\n12.  The local government units (LGUs) would be responsible for the maintenance of the roads and\nwould finance these costs either from their existing revenues or from road user charges levied\nspecifically to cover the costs of maintaining project financed roads. An analysis of the impact of road\ninvestments on the financial situation of the individual LGU is in Supplementary Appendix A.\n2.  Communal Irrigation\n13.  New and improved irrigation systems will increase rice production and farm incomes. The\nanalysis uses the following information and general assumptions while the feasibility studies contain\nthe detailed cropping and yield assumptions for each irrigation scheme.\n(i) Rice and fertilizers have been valued at their expected farm gate import parity prices in\n2010. Despite the recent increased production of rice, an analysis of expected demand\nand supply shows that with a 4 percent per annum increase in production, current\nconsumption  levels  and  a  population  growth  rate  of  2.3  percent  per  annum,  the\nPhilippines will continue to be a net importer of rice for the foreseeable future. Similarly,\nfertilizers will continue to be imported as there are substantial imports, nearly $290\nmillion in 1997, and the Philippines is not expected to become self-sufficient in the\nforeseeable future.\n \n(ii)  Irrigation development will be geared to rehabilitating existing gravity schemes that are\nno longer functional or extending the amount of land irrigated from existing water\nsources. The impact of irrigation is assessed through a simple model. The analysis\nassumes that without the project all the land, as at present, grows a rice crop in the wet\nseason with the proportion of the land currently being cropped with rice in the dry\nseason scheme-specific (0-50 percent). With the project, the water will be used for rice\ncultivation  in  both  the  wet  and  dry  seasons  and  yields  per  hectare  will  increase\nbecause of the assured supply of water. The without project yields average 3,000-\n4,000 kg/ha of unhulled rice and are estimates based on the present yields in the\nsubproject  areas  and  those  with  the  project  4,000-5,000  kg/ha  of  based  on  the\npotential with good levels of water management and agronomic practice.9 Although\nsome other higher value crops may also be grown in the dry season the analysis, in the\nabsence of scheme specific proposals, makes no allowance for this assumption.\n                                                    \n7 See footnote 6.\n8 See footnote 6.\n9 Project preparatory technical assistance estimates together with those for other crop input/output data used to assess the\nlikely increase in production in areas benefiting from project-financed roads.", "69\nAppendix 12, page 5\n \n(iii)  The model calculates the incremental impact per hectare of increasing the production\nof rice using input-output data specific to each subproject area. An interest rate of 6\npercent per crop is assumed to finance the cost of purchased inputs (4-5 months).\nWithin the model, current financial output values and costs are converted to economic\nvalues using specific economic conversion factors based on the import parity prices for\nrice and fertilizers, the SCF, and the labor conversion factor. The conversion factor for\nrice has also been used for seed. An economic conversion factor of zero has been\nused for interest, which is a transfer payment and for the irrigation fee as the economic\ncosts of the latter are included in total as a project cost.\n \n(iv)  Site-specific estimates of investment costs, including physical contingencies and the\ncosts of detailed design and supervision of construction have been prepared for each\nscheme as part of the project preparatory technical assistance. Investment costs have\nbeen converted to economic values by excluding taxes and multiplying the nontraded\n(local cost) element by the SCF. Investment is expected to take place over two years\nwith O&M costs starting in year three. As the existing schemes are not functioning\nthere are no without project O&M costs savings to be counted as a benefit.\n \n(v)  The investment cost for irrigation development will be shared between the national\nGovernment and the local government unit (LGU) with the IAs assuming responsibility\nfor the LGU loan element. The analysis assumes that the loan will finance 20 percent\nof the investment cost repayable over 15 years at an interest rate of 14 percent but\nwith no grace period (i.e., similar to the terms of the Municipal Development Fund\nexcept for the absence of a grace period). However, these terms and conditions are\nmuch less favorable to farmers than those operating under the present policy of the\nNational  Irrigation  Administration,  where  the  repayment  period  is  set  at  50  years\n(interest free) and farmers pay a minimum of 75 kg10 of unhulled rice per hectare per\nyear to repay their loans.\n(vi)  Following  the  existing  arrangements  for  community  irrigation  schemes  IAs  will  be\nresponsible for all O&M and financing the associated costs estimated at P510 per ha\nper year.11 The IA will charge farmers for the costs of O&M and include this cost in the\nservice fee which will also cover the loan repayments. In the financial analysis of the\nirrigation components of the subprojects the irrigation fee is adjusted on a case-by-\ncase basis so the IA always generates a financial surplus after repaying the loan.\n \n(vii)  In the feasibility studies, key variables for which switching values have been calculated\nto assess the sensitivity of the economic analysis to changes in the assumptions are\ninvestment and O&M costs, rice price, with project dry season cropping intensity, and\nthe with project dry and wet season yields.\n \n(viii)  The average size of rice land holding and the incremental financial costs (per hectare),\nincluding  the  imputed  cost  of  family  labor  (and  returns),  determine  the  impact  of\nscheme improvements upon the average household. The emphasis is on the with\nproject returns to labor and the incremental returns to incremental labor, which as a\ngeneral rule should be at least 2-3 times the current unskilled wage rate, if participation\nis to provide farmers with an adequate incentive for the risks associated with the use of\nadditional inputs. The analysis shows the incremental income and the returns to labor\n                                                    \n10Equivalent to P562.5 per ha per year at current prices or P28,125 per ha over 50 years assuming that no interest is paid.\n11Source:  Western  Legaspi  Detailed  Feasibility  Study  undertaken  by  National  Irrigation  Administration  and  Japan\nInternational Cooperative Agency in 1996 with costs updated to 1999 levels using the gross national product deflator.", "70\nAppendix 12, page 6\nexpected with the higher yields and an increased dry season cropping intensity made\npossible by an assured supply of water in both the wet and dry seasons.\n3.  Potable Water Supply\n14. Further  benefits  will  accrue  from  time  savings  from  potable  water  supply  schemes  and\ndecreased  disease  and  sickness  from  improved  water  quality.  A  model  has  been  prepared  to\ncalculate the potential economic and financial returns from the provision of a potable water supply\nscheme.12 Use of this model requires the following scheme specific information: (i) population to be\nserved, population growth rate, and average household size; (ii) estimates of the current use of water\nin  and  outside  the  home  and  the  volume  of  water  to  be  supplied  by  the  proposed  scheme;\n(iii) estimates of the time taken each day for water collection with and without the project; (iv) costs of\nwater treatment with and without the project; (v) incidence of waterborne diseases with and without\nthe project and the associated cost of treatment; and (vi) estimates of the investment cost and the\nannual O&M costs.\n15.  For the economic analysis the model includes as costs: scheme investment and O&M, with\nproject  water  collection,  and  health  costs.  As  benefits,  the  model  includes  the  without  project\ncollection and health costs, costs of water used outside the house, and value of the incremental water\nprovided (the average of the with and without financial cost per cubic meter). For the financial\nanalysis,  the  model  uses  the  investment  and  O&M  costs  and  the  fees  collected  from  users  to\ncalculate the rate of return and to ensure that the users association have sufficient funds to operate\nand maintain the scheme.\nD.  Results of the Analyses\n16.  The results of the analyses from the feasibility studies are summarized here and combined to\ncalculate the project\u2019s overall returns.\n1.  Rural Roads\n17.

The  results  show  a  wide  range  in  terms  of  the  cost  per  kilometer  and  the  other  basic\nparameters, e.g., beneficiary population and the area of influence. The EIRRs range from 14-30\npercent and one road has a return of less than 15 percent. However, the returns from the Hinunangan\nroad (14 percent) do not include any benefits for diverted traffic, an important likely benefit, as the\nroad will reduce costs for traffic traveling from the northern villages in Southern Leyte to Sogod and\nMaasin. Similarly, the returns from the Jiabong road are understated, as this route will reduce the\ndistance by 30 km for traffic traveling from Eastern Samar to Catbalogan and Calbayog in Western\nSamar. The absence of traffic counts prevented an estimate of these additional benefits from diverted\ntraffic. The lowland roads in Mainit provide access to rice growing areas and do not link communities.\nAs a result the analysis has not included any benefits from nonagricultural and passenger traffic.\nTable A12.2 describes the key variables used in the sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of\nchanges in the key variables. This analysis is supplemented by a risk analysis involving a wider range\nof variables using the specialist software program @RISK.\n  Table A12.2: Variables for Sensitivity Analysis\nVariables Description\nInvestment Costs Economic cost per km of road investment\nMaintenance Costs Economic cost per km of maintaining the road\nLength of Journey The average distance traveled by each ton of freight or each passenger\nAgricultural Output The without project average yield in t/ha  for all crops grown in the area of influence\nSavings in Freight Costs Savings in freight costs per km following road construction or upgrading\nSavings in Passenger Costs Savings in passenger costs per pkm following road construction or upgrading\n    km = kilometer, ha = hectare, t = ton, p = person.\n19.  Table A12.3 shows the results of the sensitivity analyses. In all cases the percentages refer to\nthe switching value, i.e., the increase or decrease required to reduce or increase the rate of return to\n15 percent.\nTable A12.3: Sensitivity Analysis- Rural Roads\n(percent)\nInvestment Maintenance Length of Agricultural Savings Savings\nSite Costs Costs Journey Output Freight Costs Pax Costs\nUpland Roads\n- Aloran +33 +57 -17 -39 -19 -267\n- Bayugan +94 +158 -37 -74 -39 -681\n- Calbayog 0 -2 0 +5 +1 +1\n- Dolores +39 +162 -24 -336 -112 -30\n- Hinunangan -4 -8 +3 +37 +7 +5\n- Jiabong -1 -4 +1 +8 +1 +6\n- Kapalong +9 +8 -4 -23 -5 -24\n- San Jose City +6 +14 -4 -86 -18 -5\nLowland Roads\n- Aloran +35 +81 -20 -79 -22 -213\n- Buyugan +91 +205 -39 -111 -40 -877\n- Mainit +12 +30 -8 -15 -8 0\n   Source: Staff estimates.\n20.  The analysis shows that where the EIRR is at least 20 percent the returns are not unduly\nsensitive to changes in the key variables. Of the variables analyzed the results are most sensitive to\nthe assumption concerning the average length of journey, which in most instances is assumed to be\nhalf the length of the road. Length of journey is important because it affects both freight (agricultural\nand nonagricultural) and passenger travel cost savings. Returns are less sensitive to the level of\ninvestments costs and savings in transport costs.", "72\nAppendix 12, page 8\n21.  Transport cost savings vary widely and depend upon the extent to which higher cost modes of\ntransport, i.e., animal and human transport, are replaced by lower cost motorized transport. Outside\nthe largely rice growing areas, the largest potential savings occur in Jiabong, P146.57/tkm, where\nmotorized transport (e.g., jeepneys) will replace water buffalo sledges and the lowest in Dolores,\nP13.33/tkm, where road transport will replace the canoes. Savings in the range P13-19/tkm (San Jose\nand Hinunangan) will mostly come from reduced VOCs following road improvements rather than from\nmajor changes to the modes of transport. Higher savings P174-202/tkm, e.g., Aloran and Bayugan\nlowland roads and Mainit, reflect situations where at present some human transport is used to carry\nsacks of unhulled rice.\n22.  Finally,  returns  are  least  sensitive  to  the  costs  of  maintenance  or  to  the  assumptions\nconcerning the existing level of agricultural output without the project. The latter reflects the fact that\nvolumes  of  nonagricultural  freight  and  passenger  traffic  (except  in  Mainit)  provide  important\ncontributions to the savings in transport costs from the without project scenario and from generated\nvolumes of traffic.\n23.      In financial terms, farming households in the areas benefiting from the provision of improved\naccess would expect to earn higher incomes as a result of reduced costs of transport and increased\ncrop production. The estimates are based on experience from the subproject areas.\nTable A12.4: Financial Analysis- Rural Roads\nTransport Incremental Total\n Site Farm Size Cost Savings Crop Income Incremental Increase\n(hectare) (P) (P) Income (P) (percent)\nUpland Roads\n- Aloran 6.6 4,215 17,092 21,312 31\n- Bayugan 3.4 8,949  7,059  16,008 45\n- Calbayog 2.9    682  7,512    8,194 27\n- Dolores 4.3    534  9,520  10,054 17\n- Hinunangan 1.4    343  3,601   3,943 27\n- Jiabong 1.0 1,121  3,590   4,711 46\n- Kapalong 1.8 1,557  4,767  6,323 33\n- San Jose City 1.5   139  3,623   3,761 16\nLowland Roads\n- Aloran 3.2 1,189  5,293  6,482 20\n- Buyugan 4.3 2,362  6,879  9,241 20\n- Mainit 0.8 1,428  2,363  3,790 24\n     Source: Staff estimates.\n24.  Savings in transport costs are highest where motorized transport replaces human and animal\ntransport. Crop production increases anticipated are relatively modest and similar levels have been\nexperienced in little over one year in areas benefiting from the Rural Infrastructure Development\nProject.\n2.

The  Bunawan  scheme  in  Kapalong  and  the  Cantugas  scheme  in  Mainit  will  be  new\ndevelopments and have higher costs and lower returns than all other schemes (except Libuganon),\nwhere the investment required is for the rehabilitation of existing schemes with high levels of sunk\ncosts. In the case of the Libuganon scheme the cost of the associated access road leads to higher\ncosts. All schemes give returns to labor in excess of twice the unskilled labor rate even if the rice price\ndeclines  in  line  with  expected  future  world  market  prices.  Average  costs  per  hectare,  including\nirrigation fees, are low and incremental incomes from rice production high. To ensure that the IAs\nhave a positive cash flow when repaying the loans and at the same time can cover the O&M costs the\nfees required would range from a low of 50 kg/ha of unhulled rice per annum in Mat-i and Anomar,\nwhere  the  city  would  finance  the  30  percent  of  investment  costs  not  financed  by  the  national\nGovernment, all to a high of 750 kg/ha at Bunawen and Libuganon. Both figures are based on a\npresent price of P7.5/kg.\n27.  The calculation of switching values (Table A12.6) shows that the economic returns from\nirrigation investments, with the exception of Libuganon and Bunawen, are insensitive to changes in\nkey variables. However, if the future rice price is the equivalent of the bottom value of the 70 percent\nprobability range indicated by the World Bank estimates, the viability of irrigation development would\nbe seriously undermined, with only Aloran, Bayugan, Anomar, and Mat-i remaining marginally viable.\nScheme  implementation  should  consider  crop  diversification  as  one  way  of  reducing  the  risks\nassociated with possible long-term reductions in rice prices.\nTable A12.6: Irrigation Schemes- Sensitivity Analysis\n(percent)\nOperation and Cropping Wet Dry\nSite Investment Maintenance Rice Intensity Season Season\nCosts Costs Price Dry Season Yield Yield\nAloran +172 +2,054 -39 -69 -38 -36\nBayugan +163 +2,068 -41 -63 -37 -37\nKapalong\n- Libuganon    +14    +521  -4 -16 -9 -9\n- Semong +112 +2,288 -19 -70 -41 -40\n- Bunawen     +5    +188  -3   -6 -3 -3\nMainit   +44 +1,269 -19 -44 -25 -23\nSan Jose City +126 +1,794 -35 -60 -34 -32\nSurigao City\n - Anomar +270 +2,853 -49 -98 -56 -51\n - Mat-i +411 +2,808 -57 -96 -55 -50\n       Source: Staff estimates.\n                                                    \n13Costs include rural access roads for Libuganon and Semong.", "74\nAppendix 12, page 10\n3.  Core Subprojects\n28.  Table A12.7 summarizes the returns from the 10 core subprojects. Each of the components of\na subproject should show a rate of return in excess of 15 percent to be eligible for funding under the\nProject. Where components are linked, as occurs with the rehabilitation of the Kapalong irrigation\nschemes and construction of access roads, the associated components should be analyzed as a\nsingle entity. Taken together the roads have a rate of return of 19 percent and a net present value at\n15 percent of P30.1 million, while the corresponding values for irrigation are 34 percent and P147.2\nmillion.\nTable A12.7: Subproject Summary\nInvestment Economic Internal\nSite Costs Rate of Return\n(P \u2018000) (percent)\n Aloran 44.178 32\n Bayugan 37.695 33\n Calbayog 42.403 15\n Dolores 91.470 21\n Hinunangan 14.649 14\n Jiabong 34.349 15\n Kapalong 48.429 20\n Mainit 18.134 20\n San Jose City 84.195 31\n Surigao City 16.631 59\n        Source: Staff estimates.\n4.  Project and Distribution Analysis\n29.  On the assumption that the results of the core subprojects represent the potential returns from\nall project investments and including all the costs associated with capacity building and institutional\nstrengthening and project management and coordination, the Project has an overall rate of return of\n18 percent and net present values, discounted at 12 percent and 15 percent, of P400 million and\nP1,069 million respectively. Additional analyses were prepared using: (i) 0.83 as the SCF, i.e., the\nvalue implied by the NEDA value for the shadow exchange rate factor of 1.2; (ii) a 30 percent\ndepreciation in the value of the peso. Table A12.8 contains the results of these analyses, which show\nthat (i)  the rate of return would increase if the peso depreciates against the dollar, mainly because a\ndevaluation would increase the import parity price of rice; and (ii) the use of SCF implied by the NEDA\nshadow exchange rate factor would increase the rate of return by 1 percent.\nTable A12.8: Project Returns\n(P million)\nStandard Conversion Factor __________0.91__________ ________0.83___________\nEIRR NPV NPV EIRR NPV NPV\n Exchange Rate P/$\n (percent) at 12% at 15%  (percent) at 12% at 15%\n     45.0 18 1,069 400 19 1,248 545\n     58.5 22 2,004 1,070 23 2,183 1,215\n           EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value.\n           Source: Staff estimates.", "75\nAppendix 12, page 11\n30.    The Project is an infrastructure project and as such the majority of the costs are incurred by\nthe public sector and the benefits earned by the private sector. An analysis of the distribution of the\ncosts and benefits shows the proportions that would accrue to government, LGUs, farmers, hauliers,\nand the IAs.14 This analysis uses information for the 10 subprojects as the distribution between the\nroads and irrigation is known for these investments and the results of this analysis are summarized in\nTable A12.9. This analysis highlights the costs of road maintenance, which are essential to the\nachievement of the benefits from the investment in rural roads.\nTable A12.9: Distribution of Costs and Benefitsa\n(P \u2018000)\nOperation and\nEntity/Group _Investment Costs_ Maintenance Costs ____Benefits_____\nTotal Percent Total Percent Total Percent\nNational Government      187 78 - - - -\nLocal Government Unit  31 13 62 86 - -\nIrrigators Association  22   9 10 14 - -\nFarmers - Road Beneficiaries - - - - 179 29\nHaulers - - - -   97 15\nFarmers - Irrigation Schemes - - - - 347 56\n          Total 240 100 72 100 623 100\n  a Net present value at 15 percent.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n5.  Risk Analysis\n31.  @RISK software was used to analyze the impact of uncertainty concerning key variables on\nthe returns from the proposed investments in rural roads and irrigation development (rehabilitation\nand new construction). A triangular distribution was assumed for key variables around the mean used\nin the analysis described above with minimum and maximum 5-20 percent below or above the mean\nvalues,  depending  on  the  perceived  uncertainty  concerning  each  variable.  The  program  using\nsimulation techniques recalculates the road and irrigation spreadsheets included in the feasibility\nstudies 100 or more times and presents the results.\n32.  The results of the data for two simulations show a narrow variation in the returns from the\nroads investment with minimum values of 15 percent and a maximum of 21-22 percent. The mean is\nnearly 19 percent and the modal values 18-19 percent. The results for irrigation show a wider\nvariation with minimum values of 26-27 percent and maximum values of 42-44 percent. The mean is\n34 percent and the mode 33 percent.\n                                                    \n14This analysis does not, however, distinguish the allocation of benefits between the nonpoor and poor in each of the\ngroups. Appendix 11 presents a poverty impact analysis that differentiates the accrual of benefits between the poor and\nnonpoor. A comparison of these two analyses highlights the fact that while the irrigation subcomponent (essentially a\nprivate good) may generate a greater total benefit, it is spread across a smaller number of beneficiaries. Thus, the rural\nroad subcomponent (a public good) will have a greater impact on poverty reduction."], "metadata": {"Author": "jlo", "CreationDate": "D:20001106082359Z", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "ModDate": "D:20131112141114+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R219-00rrp.doc"}}
