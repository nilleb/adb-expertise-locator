THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Strengthening Economic Management Reform Program1 and (ii) \na proposed policy-based grant to the Republic of Kiribati for subprogram 1 of the Strengthening \nEconomic Management Reform Program. \n \n2.  The program aims to strengthen Kiribati\u2019s economic management and create a more \nstable macroeconomic framework. The programmatic approach, with one subprogram each in \n2017 and 2018, will build on current government-led reforms supported by a multi-partner policy \naction matrix.2 The improved (i) management of public finances, assets, and liabilities; and (ii) \neconomic environment for the private sector align with the Kiribati Development Plan (KDP), \n2016\u20132019 and the Kiribati Economic Reform Program (KERP).3 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development  challenges.  One  of  the  most  remote  and  geographically  dispersed \ncountries in the world, Kiribati has 33 islands spread over 5 million square kilometers of ocean, \nan area larger than India. Its major export commodities are copra and fish. The capital, Tarawa, \nis about 4,000 kilometers from the major trade markets of Australia, Hawaii, and New Zealand. \nThe population of about 116,000 people lives on 20 coral atolls and a single volcanic island with \na land area of less than 800 square kilometers. Kiribati\u2019s low-lying atolls rise little more than 1.8 \nmeters above sea level on average and are therefore at the forefront of climate change. About \n50,000 people live on Tarawa, which has a land area of 16 square kilometers, while the islet of \nBetio is as densely populated as Manila or Jakarta. This extreme remoteness and large dispersion \ncreate significant service delivery challenges. \n \n4.  Kiribati is vulnerable to external shocks because of its geographic characteristics; high \nexposure to the negative effects of climate change, including rising sea levels; high import \ndependency; and heavy reliance on income from external sources such as investment income \nfrom its sovereign wealth fund, the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF). Private sector \ndevelopment has been constrained by high business, investment, and connectivity costs. The \npublic sector plays a dominant role in the economy, crowding out private sector activities through \nstate-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  that  operate  in  potentially  competitive  sectors. 4 Without \nindependent monetary and exchange rate policies, given the adoption of the Australian dollar, \nand the limited leverage of banking regulation and interest rate policy, the government is reliant \non fiscal policy to manage the impact of shocks and stimulate inclusive growth. \n \n                                                \n1  The program is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016.

Despite these challenges, Kiribati grew 3.5% \nper year during 2011\u20132015 (Figure 1), buoyed by development partner financed investments in \nroads and waste and sanitation, as Kiribati seeks to overcome significant infrastructure deficit; \nand fishing license revenues, which reached nearly A$200 million or 96% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) in 2015.5 Over the same period, tax revenue stagnated at 14%\u201317% of GDP \nbecause of the narrow tax base, weak tax compliance, and poor corporate tax performance of \nSOEs. On the public expenditure side, the public sector wage bill has remained relatively flat at \n24%\u201328% of GDP, reflecting government efforts to restrain current expenditure. In 2016, because \nof unfavorable weather conditions, fishing license revenues fell more than 40% to A$116 million \n(55% of GDP). This reduced a fiscal surplus of 47.7% of GDP in 2015 to a deficit of 12.4% of \nGDP in 2016. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) anticipates that growth is expected to pick \nup to 3.1% in 2017, although fiscal deficits of 7.8% in 2017 and 5.6% in 2018 are projected as \nfishing revenues continue to decline from their 2015 peak (Figure 2). The IMF considers Kiribati \nto be at high risk of debt distress because of weak growth prospects and the long-term threat of \nclimate change.6 \n \nFigure 1: Real GDP and GDP per capita  Figure 2: Real GDP, Development \n(Constant 2006 Australian dollars)  Expenditure, and Revenue from Fishing \nLicense Fees  \n(Constant 2006 Australian dollars) \n190\n180 1,550\n150\n180\n170\n1,500\n170\n160 100\n1,450\n160\n150\n1,400 150 50\n140\n140\n1,350\n130\n130 0\ns\n120 1,300 n\no\nsno sno Development Expenditure (RHS) illiM\nilliM GGDDPP per capita (RHS)   illiM FGiDshPing license fees (RHS)  \nGDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, RHS = right-hand side. \nSources: ADB.

Medium-term fiscal path. Although Kiribati\u2019s fiscal position stabilized during 2014\u20132015 \n(Table 1), the government recognizes that limited capacity to take on new debt, volatility of fishing \nrevenue, severe infrastructure deficits (particularly on the outer islands), and the negative effects \nof climate change mean that it must remain vigilant and continue efforts to build fiscal buffers and \nsecure support from development partners for project and policy financing. Efforts to improve \ndomestic  revenue  mobilization  have  helped  expand  the  tax  net,  improve  compliance,  and \n                                                \n5  Through regional cooperation via the Parties to the Nauru Agreement, Kiribati and several other Pacific economies \nhave been able to achieve a structural shift to higher fishing license fees\u2014with the minimum cost for a vessel-day \nincreasing from $2,500 in 2010 to more than $10,000 in 2017. \n6  IMF. 2017. Kiribati: 2016 Article IV Consultation\u2014Press Release. Washington, DC. \n ", "3 \nincrease collections. The government introduced a value-added tax in mid-2014 to replace \ndistortive  tariffs  and  trade  taxes.  Increased  public  expenditure  has  been  driven  by  large \ninfrastructure projects financed by development partners, increases in health and education \nspending, and the doubling in the copra subsidy from A$8.0 million in the 2015 revised budget to \nA$17.2 million in the 2016 budget.7 Future budget decisions will need to account for a prudent \nassessment of Kiribati\u2019s spending goals, revenue projections, and the management targets of the \nRERF. Maintaining a sustainable budget position in the medium term will be central to this effort, \nbased on fishing revenue projections that allow the government to protect its public expenditure \nprograms from potential revenue volatility, complemented by an appropriately sized cash reserve \nbuffer to deal with external shocks. \n \nTable 1: Economic and Fiscal Performance, 2014\u20132018 \n        Estimated  Projected \n \n2014  2015  2016  2017  2018 \n         \nIncome, growth, and inflationa \n  GDP per capita ($, current)  1,636.8  1,403.3  1,357.7  1,393.6  1,214.4 \n  GDP growth (%, constant market prices)  0.4  3.5  1.8  2.0  2.3 \n  Consumer price (% change)  2.1  0.6  0.7  2.0  2.0 \nCentral government financea           \n  Total revenue and grants (% of GDP)  143.4  171.7  142.1  106.0  104.5 \n    Revenue  89.8  120.9  80.4  71.1  69.7 \n      Tax revenue  14.4  17.0  16.8  16.6  16.3 \n      Nontax revenue  75.5  103.9  63.6  54.6  53.4 \n    Grants and transfers  53.5  50.8  61.6  34.8  34.7 \n  Total expenditure (% of GDP)  118.8  124.0  154.4  113.8  110.1 \n    Current expenditure  60.9  66.0  83.2  74.9  71.3 \n    Capital expenditure  57.9  57.9  71.2  38.9  38.8 \n  Overall balance (% of GDP)  24.6  47.7  (12.4)  (7.8)  (5.6) \n  Fishing license fees (A$ million)b  141.6  197.8  115.7  110.0  112.2 \nRERFc           \n  Financing from RERF (% of GDP)  4.2  (22.5)  (49.8)  (3.7)  (0.5) \n  RERF closing balance (A$ million)  679  756  894  929  957 \n  Per capita value (constant 2006 A$)  5,062  5,482  6,273  6,258  6,182 \n\u2026 = data not available, ( ) = negative, % = percent, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, \nRERF = Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund. \na  ADB estimates and projections. 2016 values are estimates. \nb  Government estimates.

A  more  stable  macroeconomic  framework  is  the \noverarching objective of the KDP, 2016\u20132019 and the KERP (footnote 3). The KERP was \ndeveloped against a backdrop of weak economic management, unsustainable drawdowns from \nthe RERF, high levels of non-concessional debt, uncoordinated borrowing by ministries made \nwithout approval from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED), poorly \n                                                \n7  The copra subsidy is the government\u2019s main form of income redistribution and social welfare to the outer islands, \nwhere job creation and income-earning opportunities are limited. At the government\u2019s request, the World Bank is \nundertaking a review of potential efficient and equitable alternatives to the copra subsidy, including exploring cash-\nfor-work  opportunities,  recalibrating  the  eligibility  criteria  for  existing  social  protection  schemes,  adjusting \npostsecondary scholarships, and providing transport grants to seamen for boarding foreign vessels. \n ", "4 \nperforming SOEs, and weak management of fisheries revenues.8 Budget support through policy \ndialogue and policy financing from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development \npartners has helped the government prioritize, appropriately sequence, and implement the KERP. \nThe KERP emphasizes (i) improving public financial management, (ii) improving the management \nof public assets and liabilities, and (iii) creating an environment for private sector-led growth. \n \n8.  Development partner coordination. The Economic Reform Taskforce (ERT), chaired by \nthe secretary to the cabinet, is the main forum for consultation and coordination between the \ngovernment and development partners on the implementation of the KERP. The ERT comprises \nrepresentatives from the MFED; implementing agencies such as the Ministry of Fisheries and \nMarine Resources Development; the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Cooperatives; the \nMinistry of Information, Communication, Transport, and Tourism Development; and development \npartners. The ERT meetings provide a forum for facilitating dialogue, monitoring progress, and \ncoordinating technical assistance (TA). Other avenues for collaboration and coordination include \nthe annual IMF Article IV consultations and the biennial Development Partners Forum. \n \n9.  ADB collaborated closely with the World Bank and the governments of Australia and New \nZealand in preparing this program, which uses a joint government-led policy matrix to underpin \nthe provision of budget support.9 The joint matrix includes actions used as triggers by other \ndevelopment  partners  such  as  procurement,  fisheries,  asset  management,  and \ntelecommunications reforms. This, along with other complementary measures such as joint \nmissions, reduces transaction costs for the government while increasing the policy impact. In \naddition, ADB and the World Bank consulted the Japan International Cooperation Agency and \nthe IMF and its Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre to coordinate policy advice and TA, \nparticularly in fisheries revenue and public finance management (PFM). \n \n10.  Government reform  progress. This collaboration  and  coordination  has  helped  the \ngovernment focus its efforts on accomplishing the three pillars of KERP (para. 7). During 2013\u2013\n2016, the government (i) completed an analysis of public expenditure patterns, whose findings \ninformed the preparation of the government\u2019s annual fiscal strategy; (ii) completed external audits \nof the 2015 financial statements of operational SOEs with debts or guaranteed overdraft facilities; \n(iii) ceased government bailouts for SOEs and payments to the Australia and New Zealand \nBanking Group Limited (ANZ Bank), the only commercial bank in Kiribati, under guarantee of \noverdrafts and loans; (iv) approved a national fisheries policy to strengthen resource management \nand maximize license revenues; (v) enacted tax legislation to improve compliance and introduced \na value-added tax to broaden the revenue base; (vi) improved management of contingent \nliabilities;  (vii)  approved  and  implemented  a  debt  policy  to  prevent  new  non-concessional \nborrowing; (ix) appointed new asset managers for the RERF and restructured the RERF portfolio; \nand (x) privatized a government-owned telecommunications company and granted a second \nmobile operator a license to operate.10 \n \n                                                \n8  Between 2013\u20132016, the government has taken important measures to improve fiscal management of debt policy. \nKiribati has adopted a debt policy establishing criteria for concessional and non-concessional public borrowing and \nformal procedures for contracting new debt, consistent with sustainable macroeconomic management. It has also \nimproved the management of public debt by establishing a comprehensive database of public debt. Kiribati\u2019s current \ndebt portfolio constitutes external debt only\u2014from ADB and Taipei,China\u2014since all domestic debt was cleared in \n2015. There is no SOE debt, and none of the SOEs have overdraft facilities with the Australia and New Zealand \nBanking Group Limited (ANZ Bank). \n9  Joint Policy Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 ADB. 2016. Finding Balance 2016: Benchmarking the Performance of State-Owned Enterprises in Island Countries. \nManila. \n ", "5 \n11.  ADB value addition. ADB has played a critical role in (i) identifying critical SOE, PFM, \nand business environment reforms to support the government\u2019s reform agenda; (ii) enhancing \ndevelopment coordination through coordinating and collaborating with other development partner \ninitiatives in these areas; (iii) providing TA support for capacity building and reform implementation, \nparticularly for SOE reform;11 and (iv) collaborating with the governments of Australia and New \nZealand to support the restructure of the Public Utilities Board (PUB),12 complementing ongoing \nproject investments in water, sanitation, and energy. Given thin administrative capacity, the \ngovernment\u2019s focus on addressing significant deterioration in infrastructure assets, and the need \nto improve service delivery to the outer islands, reform implementation would have been difficult \nand have major cost implications without ADB technical, strategic, and financial support provided \nunder this program. This support aligns with the KDP and the KERP. It is consistent with the \nPacific Approach, 2016\u20132020 and its focus on reducing the costs of doing business and providing \nsocial services, managing risks from natural and economic shocks, and enabling value creation \nby supporting private sector growth and investment.13 The programmatic approach provides for \nan ongoing, coordinated multi-development partner dialogue on critical economic reform issues, \nwhich also acts to situates partner support within the government\u2019s economic reform priorities. At \nthe same time the program grant enables government to finance reform efforts and build a broader \nsupport  base  for  these  actions.  Future  ADB  support  will  continue  to  support  reform \nimplementation in the three major reform areas identified in the KERP (para. 7). The TA will further \nsupport economic management, structural reforms, and PFM (footnote 10). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  In line with the KDP, the impact of the program will be stable macroeconomic framework \nachieved. The outcome will be overall economic management improved. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  The program has two outputs supported by the two subprograms. The policy reform \nactions that make up the program policy matrix are a subset of the joint policy matrix (footnote 8) \nthat is monitored by the Economic Reform Taskforce. Each development partner has selected \nareas from the matrix that it directly supports, including the approval of a public procurement \nreform plan, the approval of a fisheries joint venture plan, and the issuance of a second mobile \noperator license. \n \n14.  The government has completed all six actions under subprogram 1, which are outlined in \nparas. 15\u201317. \n \n15.  Output 1. Management of public finances, assets, and liabilities improved. These \nreforms will contribute to wider improvements in the maintenance of fiscal sustainability, the \ncontainment of fiscal risks, and overall PFM. They include the following: \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n12 The PUB has undergone major improvements  between 2015-2016 due largely to TA provided through the \nGovernment of Australia\u2019s Pacific Technical Assistance Mechanism Phase 2 program. In support of this effort, the \nGovernment of Kiribati has continued to fund community service obligations for the provision of noncommercial water \nto  households, and has  approved  the  Electricity  Distribution  Refurbishment  Project,  jointly  financed  by  the \ngovernments of Australia and New Zealand. \n13 ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n ", "6 \n(i)  Assets. Under subprogram 1, the government completed a review of its RERF \ncustodial arrangements to ensure that the services of the current provider remain \ncompetitive  with  current  market  practice  and  benchmarks.  The  government \nsubsequently endorsed the recommendations of the review and approved the \nissuance of a request for proposal for custodial services, which was issued in April \n2017. Subprogram 2 will ensure the contract for custodial services is awarded \nbased on the completed selection and evaluation process. \n \n(ii)  Contingent liabilities. The implementation of a public sector debt database has \nenabled the government to better monitor all debt, including contingent liabilities. \nThe  program\u2019s  focus  on  the  considerable  audit  backlog  resulted  in  the \ngovernment\u2019s recognition of this priority issue. Despite constrained capacity, the \ngovernment  is  now  addressing the  backlog. The government  has  completed \nfinancial  statements  for  2016  for  five  major  SOEs:  Air  Kiribati  Limited, \nDevelopment Bank of Kiribati, Kiribati Oil Company Ltd, Kiribati Ports Authority, \nand the PUB. The Kiribati Provident Fund also completed financial statements for \n2012\u20132016. Subprogram 2 will ensure financial statements for 2017 are completed \nand, in the case of the Kiribati Provident Fund, submitted to the Kiribati National \nAudit Office. \n \n(iii)  Public finance management. The government has identified the shortcomings of \nits financial  management  information  system  (FMIS),  including  its  inability  to \nprepare, execute, or report against the national budget, which undermines financial \ncontrol, monitoring, and reporting. The government has approved a full review to \nassess  the  needs  and  identify  all  gaps  in  the  FMIS.  The  government  has \ncommitted $2.5 million in its 2018 budget to improve or replace the FMIS in \nsubprogram 2, based on the outcome of the full review. \n \n(iv)  State-owned enterprises. On 30 August 2017, the cabinet, supported by ADB, \napproved to seek a concession plus lease arrangement for the government-owned \nCaptain Cook Hotel on Kiritimati island. Subprogram 2 will build on this support to \nprepare  the  Captain  Cook  Hotel  for  the  transaction,  including  through  an \nadvertisement for sale and any necessary road shows, and then reach cabinet \napproval to execute the concession agreement. The hotel has had mixed financial \nresults since 2010. In late 2015, after 2 years of poor financial performance and \nthe hotel failing to remit pension and income tax deductions from staff salaries, the \ngovernment directed the MFED and an ADB-funded TA team to explore public\u2013\nprivate partnership (PPP) arrangements. \n \n16.  Output 2. Environment for the private sector improved. Private sector-led growth is \nan important focus for the government, and the program will support the following reforms: \n \n(i)  Improving access to basic utilities. Access to reliable and responsibly costed \nelectricity and water is vital to encourage the growth of the private sector. Following \nthe appointment of a new chief executive officer, the PUB began implementing a \nmedium-term reform plan. The reforms are intended to ensure operationally and \nfinancially  sustainable  delivery  of  electricity,  water,  and  sanitation  services. \nChanges to electricity tariffs in January 2017 and to residential connection fees in \nApril 2017 to make electricity more affordable and accessible to lower-income \nhouseholds have resulted in expanded access to power and an increased billing \ncollection rate. For example, charges for the first 100 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of \n ", "7 \nconsumption were reduced from A$0.40 per kWh to A$0.10 per kWh for domestic \nconsumers. The charge for consuming 100\u2013300 kWh of electricity is A$0.40 per \nkWh, but the rate for more than 300kWh of consumption increased from A$0.40 \nper kWh to A$0.55 per kWh. The cabinet has also approved a reduction in the \nhousehold electricity connection fee from A$380 to A$50, which prompted more \nthan  1,000  households  to  request  electricity  connections.  Subprogram  2  will \nsupport further reform in the PUB to include water and sanitation services. The \nPUB aims to deliver piped water that is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week \nthrough a pressurized system. Although water is free, PUB research suggests that \neven poor households would be prepared to pay a usage fee to have a regular \nsupply of piped water rather than water being available only from communal \nstandpipes for 2 hours a day, every second day. \n \n(ii)  Public\u2013private  partnership  concessions.  The  government  awarded  a  PPP \nconcession for the Betio Shipyard Limited. The government owns Betio Shipyard \nand chose to tender out the lease of the shipyard and its assets under a PPP \nconcession  agreement,  for  an  anticipated  term  of  25  years.  In  return,  the \nconcession  holder  will  be  required  to  operate  the  shipyard,  pay  an  annual \nconcession fee, repair the existing slipway, and construct a new slipway with larger \ncapacity to service the fishing fleet rather than have these vessels serviced in Suva, \nFiji. Subprogram 2 will also support the award of a management contract for the \ngovernment-owned flagship hotel, Otintaai Hotel. \n \n17.  Subprogram 2 building on subprogram 1. The policy matrix sets out 8 proposed policy \nactions for subprogram 2, with completion expected October 2018. Subprogram 2 will extend the \nfocus of  the policy actions under subprogram 1 to include (i) the development of a whole-of-\ngovernment  asset  management  strategy;  (ii)  the  implementation  of  a  community  service \nobligation policy in 2018 that will result in SOEs and utilities being directly paid for the assessed \ncost of providing agreed community services rather than a reliance on ad hoc cash injections, \nwhich have been an unpredictable drain on budget resources; (iii) the continuation of PUB reforms, \nfocusing on the cost and quality of water and sanitation services and delivery of services to the \nmost vulnerable groups; and (iv) the creation of a PPP for the Otintaai Hotel.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n18.  The Government of Kiribati has requested a grant not exceeding $5.0 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) for Subprogram 1. Subprogram 2 financing \nis $2.5 million. The grant will (i) help meet the financing gap for the 2017 fiscal year and (ii) \nincentivize timely implementation of the KERP policy reform actions needed to move toward fiscal \nsustainability in the long term. The government forecasts its financing requirements to be $18.7 \nmillion in 2017 (9.2% of GDP) and $15.4 million in 2018 (7.3% of GDP). \n \n19.  Budget support will help insulate public spending from potential volatility in fishing revenue, \nlimit drawdowns from the RERF and allow for its growth, and allow the government to move \ntoward structurally balanced budgets over the medium term. ADB, the governments of Australia \nand New Zealand, and the World Bank jointly support the implementation of the KERP, with these \npartners providing collaborative cofinancing of $0.4 million (Australia), $2.0 million (New Zealand), \nand $5.0 million (World Bank). Total policy financing of $12.4 million will help finance 69% of the \nrecurrent fiscal deficit. \n \n ", "8 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The program is expected to be implemented over 24 months from November 2016- \nOctober 2018. The implementation period for subprogram 1 is November 2016\u2013May 2018. The \nMFED, as the executing agency, will oversee implementation of agreed policy actions and be \nresponsible for program administration, disbursements, and maintenance of all records. The \nimplementing agencies will be the MFED; the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources \nDevelopment;  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and  Sustainable  Energy;  and  the  Ministry  of \nInformation, Communication, Transport, and Tourism Development. TA from ADB and other \npartners has been, and will continue to be, available to support the government in accomplishing \nthe policy actions. Procurement, advance contracting, and retroactive financing are not expected. \nADB will disburse the grant proceeds following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as \namended from time to time). ADB will carry out joint progress monitoring through the joint ERT. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  The  primary  gain  from  strengthening  the  RERF  management  is  improved  fiscal \nsustainability and macroeconomic stability. The RERF is the primary vehicle for intergenerational \nsaving and buffers the economy from external shocks and revenue volatility, which tends to be \ndominated by the fishing license fee revenue. The improvement of the RERF management will \nenhance the government\u2019s ability to address these shocks while maintaining vital public services \nand infrastructure investments. Better public debt monitoring will also contribute to an improved \nfiscal position. The expected impact of the PUB restructuring includes the improved health of \nKiribati\u2019s population, especially those in Tarawa, through enhanced access to improved sanitation \ninfrastructure and services. Improved access to water and electricity is also expected to create \nbusiness opportunities and foster private sector development in the country. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n22.  Promoting  good  governance  is  a  key  national  priority.  The  2010  Public  Financial \nManagement Performance Report identified relative strengths in Kiribati\u2019s PFM. The report also \nhighlighted weaknesses, including oversight of aggregate fiscal risk from other public sector \nentities; multiyear perspective in fiscal planning; recording and management of cash balances, \ndebt, and guarantees; and competition, value for money, and controls in procurement.14 Through \nthe KERP, the government has been making steady progress in addressing these reforms (para. \n9).  In  addition,  the  government  has  strengthened  expenditure  controls  through  improved \naccounting systems. Kiribati\u2019s annual budget is publicly available on the government\u2019s website. \nIn addition, the government completed an ADB-supported public procurement review in August \n2017,15 which concluded that Kiribati\u2019s public procurement process, under its Procurement Act, \n2002, is outdated and incomplete. ADB is working closely with the government and other partners \nto implement the Kiribati Public Procurement Reform Program, which will, in the long term, reduce \nstaff costs; improve value for money, quality, and delivery of purchases; and lead to 10%\u201315% in \noverall savings.16 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and the MFED. \n                                                \n14 Government of Kiribati.

Poverty and Social \n \n23.  A focus on the improvement in the management of public finances, assets, and liabilities \nalong with strong SOE reform will benefit the poor and vulnerable in Kiribati directly by improving \npublic services and indirectly by enabling the government to better develop and implement its \nbudget, inclusive of social programs. Improved economic management can free up resources that \nwill allow the government to better respond to external shocks, increase allocations to social \nsectors, and enable private sector job creation. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n24.  The program is classified category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous  peoples.  SDCC  has  reviewed  the  environmental  and  social  implications  of  the \nprogram outputs and actions, and no activity will result in or lead to any physical works or \ninfrastructure.  The  program  will  therefore  not  cause  any  involuntary  resettlement  and \nenvironmental impacts. No distinct and vulnerable groups of indigenous peoples will be affected. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n \n25.  Major risks and mitigation measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.17 \n \nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigation Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nThe government cannot implement  Already the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has \npolicy reform actions because it  strengthened its organizational structure and its capacity.

The program seeks \nto support fiscal resilience through revenue enhancement, ongoing \nfiscal consolidation, and stabilization of the RERF as a buffer \nagainst external shocks and the country\u2019s increasing vulnerability to \nclimate change. ADB will continue to monitor national, regional, and \nglobal economic developments and environmental risks and \nrespond promptly to possible government requests for assistance if \nunforeseen events occur. \nProgress and commitment to SOE  There has been strong SOE reform since 2012 through the \nperformance improvements are  implementation of the State-Owned Enterprises (Amendment) Act, \nhalted or reversed.  2013 and the closure of selected underperforming SOEs.
