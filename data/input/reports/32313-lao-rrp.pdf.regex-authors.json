Following the primary health care expansion \nproject, it will help the Ministry of Health (MOH) to improve \nprimary  health  care  (PHC)  delivery  in  the  eight  northern \nprovinces; and strengthen the capacity of MOH in planning, \nbudgeting, financing, human resource development (HRD), and \ncoordination towards a comprehensive program approach.  \n \nRationale  Starting from a low base, the country\u2019s health indicators still lag \nbehind those of most other countries in the region. Challenges \ninclude widespread poverty, isolated populations, and public \nsector capacity and financing constraints. A PHC network has \nbeen put in place in the last decade, and access to basic health \ncare has substantially improved. However, the health behavior \nof the rural poor has not changed much, and demand for health \nservices remains low. Services are often substandard and not \naffordable to the poor. Appropriate services for women and \nsome ethnic groups are often lacking.  \n \nThe Government of the Lao PDR stands committed to reducing \npoverty and achieving the MDGs, and has identified the health \nsector as one of four priority sectors in the NSEDP6. The MOH \nhas  prepared  the  Health  Development  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  to \naddress  the  sector  challenges,  including  moving  toward  a \ndecentralized  and  results-based  approach,  integrating  PHC, \nimproving maternal and child health and nutrition, developing \nhuman  resources,  improving  health  sector  financing,  and \nharmonizing external assistance.   \n \nThe proposed Project is included in the Country Strategy and \nProgram Update (2006\u20132008) for the Lao PDR approved by the \nBoard in August 2005, and is also included in the 2007 country \nprogram. It builds on ADB\u2019s previous investments in the health \nsector  in  the  Lao  PDR,  and  responds  to  the  Government\u2019s \nefforts to improve PHC delivery and help prepare the building ", "ii   \nblocks for a national program. It proposes internationally proven \nstrategies for improving PHC performance, and cost-effective \ninterventions that benefit the poor, women, and ethnic groups \nmost.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The goal of the Project is to improve health and nutrition in the \nLao PDR, particularly among the poor, women and children, \nand ethnic groups in the eight northern provinces. Its aim is to \nimprove health and nutrition behavior, increase use of health \nservices, and make the provincial health system more effective, \nefficient, and equitable in delivering PHC.  \n \nThe objectives of the Project are (i) to improve PHC delivery in \nthe eight northern provinces, particularly for vulnerable groups; \nand  (ii)  to  strengthen  MOH  capacity  for  health  system \ndevelopment  nationwide,  including  planning  and  budgeting, \nfinancing,  HRD,  and  coordination.  The  Project  has  two \ncorresponding components and is based on a two-phased PHC \ndevelopment concept covering 8 years.  \n \nProject Investment Plan  The Project is estimated to cost $15.0 million equivalent for the \n4-year period, including taxes, duties, and contingencies. \nFinancing Plan  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a grant of \n$13.0 million from its Special Funds resources to cover 87% of \nthe project cost. The Government will contribute $2.0 million.  \n \nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \n \n     \nSource      Amount\nAsian Development Banka  13.0 \nGovernment    2.0 \n  Total      15.0 \na Asian Development Fund grant. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nGrant Allocation Terms  ADB will provide a grant of $13.0 million from its Special Funds \nresources  with  terms  and  conditions  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement \npresented to the Board. \nPeriod of Utilization  The grant will be used until 31 March 2012.  \nEstimated Project  30 September 2011.  \nCompletion Date   \nExecuting Agency  The executing agency will be the MOH, through its Department \nof Planning and Budgeting (DPB). Project implementation will \nbe mainstreamed through the various MOH departments, with \nthe DPB in a coordinating and administrative role.  \n \nImplementation  The MOH Steering Committee chaired by the Minister of Health \nwill guide project implementation. Departments of the MOH and \n ", "  iii\nArrangements  core  ministries  are  represented  in  the  committee.  Project \nreview  meetings  will  be  held  every  quarter.  MOH  has  also \nformed technical task forces for guiding implementation.   \n \nProcurement  All  ADB-financed  procurement  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n  \n \nConsulting Services  The Project will require five international consultants for a total \nof 47 person-months, five national consultants for a total of 90 \nperson-months,  and  architect  and  accounting  services.  The \ninternational  experts  in  PHC  systems  (21 person-months), \nhealth  policy  and  planning  (6  person-months)  and  health \neconomics  (8  person-months)  will  be  hired  as  individual \nconsultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  procedures  for  hiring \nconsultants. The architect and accounting services will be hired \nthrough separate firms in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time), \nusing  the  biodata  technical  proposal  and  consultant \nqualification  selection  or  least-cost  selection  method.  Other \nconsultants will be contracted through one firm in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using the \nfixed budget selection method and biodata technical proposal. \nThis package includes international experts in HRD (9 person-\nmonths)  and  social  development  (3  person-months);  and \nnational  experts  in  health  information  (24  person-months), \nhealth  policy  and  planning  (12  person-months),  HRD  (24 \nperson-months), health care financing (24 person-months), and \nsocial development (6 person-months). \n \nProject Benefits and  The Project is targeted at the rural poor, women and children, \nBeneficiaries  and ethnic groups. The country is lagging behind its MDGs \nbecause of high mortality and morbidity among these groups. \nHighly cost-effective interventions through an established PHC \nsystem will help the Lao PDR in achieving its MDGs. At project \ncompletion,  health  behavior,  coverage  of  essential  services, \nand health system performance will have improved. Substantial \ncapacity will have been built up at MOH and the provinces for \nresults-based  planning,  budgeting,  financing,  HRD,  and \nadministration towards a comprehensive program approach.   \nRisks and Assumptions  Four  risks  have  been  identified.  First,  MOH  and  provincial \ngovernments must make difficult political choices to improve \n \nsector performance. Project support will therefore be results-\nbased and participatory. Second, PHC delivery will depend on \n \nexternal  bridging  of  recurrent  costs  until  domestic  funding \n \nimproves. Third, staff lack skills and work limited hours due to \n \nlow pay. Fourth, initial project delay will be mitigated by using \nthe existing administrative capacity of the MOH. \n \n \n \n ", "102o  00'E 106o  00'E\nPEOPLE'S\n REPUBLIC  OF\nCHINA Gnot-Ou LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\nHEALTH SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nPhongsali\nBoun Nua\nPHONGSALI\nSamphan\nN M ARRiver Sing Boun Tai Mai\nM YAMekong  LLoOuULaoAnngNg-GNNamAtMhTaHA Namo La Khoa\nMeung Xai Nambak Xiangkho\nBOKEO Viangphoukha Ngoy Sopbao\nTonpheung Nale OUDOMXAI Viangkham Xam-Nua\nHouayxay Beng LOUANGPHRABANG Viangxai\nPha-Oudom Nga Houamuang\nHOUAPHAN\n20o  00'N Houn Chomphet Pak-OuPhPoankxxaeing Et 20o  00'N\nPaktha Pakbeng Xam-Tai\nLouangphrabang\nKhopXianghon Hongsa Xiang-Ngeun Kham\nNgeun Phoukout\nPhoukhoun\nXaignabouri Nan Phaxai PekKhounNonghet VIET  NAM\nKasi Mok-Mai \nPhiang VIENTIANE XIANGKHOUANG\nXaisomboun Thathom\nGulf   of   Tonkin\nXAIGNABOURI Vangviang\nMetKeo-Oudom BORIKHAMXAI\nFuang Hinheup Longxan Borikhan Viangthong\nThongmixai Phonhong Thaphabat Pakxan\nSangthong Thourakhom Pakkading Khamkeut\nPaklai Naxaythong VIENTIANE Pak-Ngum\nXaithani Chanthabouri\nSikhottabong\nVIENTIANE Hatxaifong Hinboun Nakay\nXanakham Sisattanak\nMUNICIPAL KHAMMOUAN\nBoten Kenthao THAILAND MekonTg hRaivkerheGknommalat MahaxaiBoualapha\nXebangfai Xaibouathong\nNongbok\nAtsaphon Vilabouri\nXaibouri\nOuthoumphon Atsaphangthong Xepon\nPhalanxai\nN Khanthabouri ChamphoXnonbouri Phin Nong\nSAVANNAKHET\nXaiphouthong Songkhon Samouay\n16o  00'N 0 50 100 Thapangthong ToTuam-Olayn 16o  00'N\nKilometers Lakhonpheng Vapi Saravan Karum\nKhongxedon SARAVAN XEKONG\nThateng\nProject Area - Component 1 Xanasomboun Laongam Laman Dakchung\nNational Capital Bachiangchareunsouk\nSanxai\nProvincial Capital Pakxe Pakxong\nPhonthong\nCity/Town Champasak Pathoumphon XSaaismetathkakhixai\nNational Road\nPaved Provincial Road Soukhouma SanamxaiATTAPU\nCHAMPASAK\nPhouvong\nRiver\nDistrict Boundary Mounlapamok\nProvincial Boundary Khong\nInternational Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\nCAMBODIA\n102o  00'E 106o  00'E\n06-3412 RM", " \n  I.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Health System Development Project \nto support primary health care in northern Lao PDR and build capacity for health system \ndevelopment nationwide. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The Lao PDR has a population of 5.6 million people, 73% of whom live in rural areas.1 \nAbout 2 million live in the eight, partly mountainous, northern provinces. The population is highly \ndispersed, with an average population density of 24 people per square kilometer and an annual \npopulation growth rate of 2%, including migration. The rural population is scattered over 10,552 \nvillages in 17 provinces and 141 districts. About 80% of the population depends on agriculture, \nbut only 4% of the land area is considered arable and permanent cropland.2 Small ethnic groups \nmake up about 30% of the population; most of these are poor, live in the uplands, and have \nlimited access to services and markets, particularly during the rainy season.  \n \n3.  With  the  overarching  goal  of  poverty  reduction,  the  sixth  national  socio-economic \ndevelopment plan (NSEDP6) for 2006\u20132010 gives high priority to reducing urban-rural inequity.3 \nAverage per capita income in the country increased from $335 in 2000 to $491 in 2005, and the \nannual gross domestic product grew from 5.8% in 2000 to 6.5% in 2004.4 Overall income \npoverty declined from 46% in 1992 to 32% in 2003,5 but growth has been primarily urban, and \nrural-urban disparities are increasing. Poverty in the uplands is estimated at 43.9%, compared \nwith 28.2% in lowland areas. On the 2005 gender-related development index,6 the Lao PDR \nranked 102nd out of 140 countries; Viet Nam ranked 83rd, and Thailand, 57th.7 \n \n4.  The Lao PDR has made good progress in health indicators, but the country started from \na low base, and with current trends, will not achieve the millennium development goals (MDGs) \nfor the health sector. Child mortality reduced from 107 to 98 per 1,000 live births from 2000 to \n2005, compared with the MDG of 55 per 1,000 by 2015. The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) \nreduced from 530 to 405 per 100,000 live births from 2000 to 2005, compared with the MDG of \n185 per 100,000 live births in 2015 (footnote 1). Surrounded by five countries with higher HIV \nprevalence,  the  country  is  unlikely  to  halt  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS.  HIV  prevalence  has \nincreased to 1% of service women and 0.1% of adults aged 15-45 years.8 The health indicators \nshow major differences between socioeconomic groups (Appendix 1). \n                                                 \n1  National Statistics Centre of the Lao PDR. 2005.

Communicable diseases, malnutrition, and reproductive health problems are the major \ndisease burden on the rural poor. Malaria, diarrheal diseases, and acute respiratory infections \nare the common causes of child mortality, often in association with malnutrition. Besides a \ngrowing HIV/AIDS epidemic, the population also faces the threat of an avian influenza epidemic. \nNoncommunicable diseases and road accidents are gaining in importance as well and putting \npressure on the limited resources for health services.  \n \n6.  The total fertility rate has reduced to 4.5 children per woman, while the contraceptive \nprevalence rate among married women has increased from 32% to 38% in 5 years. However, \nmotherhood has not become much safer. According to the Lao Reproductive Health Survey of \n2000, only 23% of deliveries were attended by trained health personnel.9 Nationwide, 86% of \ndeliveries  occurred  at home,  and  9  out  of  10  maternal  deaths  occur  at  home.  Access  to \nemergency obstetric care is a major problem in rural areas; where such care is provided, the \nprohibitive costs of transport and operations often make them unaffordable.10 The survey also \nreported a high rate of pregnancies among teenagers (those aged 15\u201319), who are particularly \nat risk of complications during childbirth\u201418.4% of girls in this age group were either mothers or \npregnant at the time of the survey.  \n \n7.  According to a 2006 study of the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, 39% of children under \n5 years of age are underweight (based on weight for age), compared with 40% in 1990. \nMalnutrition  is  common  because  of  seasonal  food  shortages,  common  infections,  certain \ncustoms, and inappropriate child care. Micronutrient deficiencies in vitamin A, iron, and iodine \nare  also  widespread.11 Malnutrition  is  possibly  associated  with  as  much  as  58%  of  child \nmortality. It is now receiving more attention as a major public health problem.  \n \n8.  Under the stewardship of the Ministry of Health (MOH), primary health care (PHC) is \ndelivered through a system that includes village health activities, outreach services, health \ncenters, district and provincial health offices (PHOs) and hospitals, and centrally managed \nvertical programs. A substantial network of health centers has been established.12 In 2004, 53% \nof villagers in the eight northern provinces lived within 1 hour walking from a hospital or health \ncenter and 16% were more than 4 hours away. Physical access is becoming less of a barrier to \nhealth services for most people. However, physical and social access is still poor for women \nneeding reproductive health care and for remote ethnic communities in general. Overall demand \nfor services remains low. Of those seeking treatment, 26% use a village health volunteer (VHV) \nor village health provider; 40% a government facility; and 29% a private pharmacy or clinic \n(section B).13 Family care including child nutrition can also be improved, even  given local \nconditions.   \n \n9.  The  Government  recognizes  the  urgent  need  to  address  this  situation.  Its  overall \nstrategic framework identifies health as a priority sector for development, and proposes to \nreduce differences between urban and rural health, lower mother and child mortality rates, raise \nlife  expectancy,  and  contain  the  spread  of  communicable  diseases.  In  health  and  human \nresource  development  (HRD),  priority  is  given  to  deploying  more  health  personnel  to  the \ndistricts and villages, particularly to remote rural areas, upgrading the quality and capacity of \nhealth personnel, and improving health financing. \n                                                 \n9  National Statistics Centre of the Lao PDR. 2000.

In addition to expanding the infrastructure network, the MOH has set up a village health  \nprogram to improve health and nutrition behavior and provide villages beyond 2 hours walking \nfrom a health facility with better access to health care (footnote 12).  Through village health \ncommittees, local men and women have been trained as VHVs. They provide basic treatment of \ncommon diseases with medicines financed from a drug revolving fund (DRF). In five northern \nprovinces surveyed under the Primary Health Care Expansion Project (PHCEP), by 2004, drug \nkits had been supplied to 48% of the villages compared to 10% 4 years earlier. These drug kits \nare now the primary source of medicines in these villages. More recently, VHVs and union \nmembers have also been introduced to peer education to augment behavioral change efforts. \nThe  program  can  be  improved  and  expanded  to  include  more  prevention  and  promotion \nactivities, in particular for reproductive health and nutrition.    \n \n11.  The NSEDP6 identifies health as one of four priority sectors for development. It calls for \nexpanded PHC services to all remote and poor villages, and more village and district health \npersonnel. The plan is being implemented in the context of greater decentralization of authority \nto the provinces. Prime Minister\u2019s Instruction 01 of March 2000 outlines the Government\u2019s \ndecentralization approach, with the province as the strategic unit for development, the district as \nthe planning and budgeting unit, and the village as the implementing unit. The decentralization \ninstruction has encouraged the MOH to concentrate on results-based approaches to health \nmanagement.  \n \n12.  The PHC Policy (2000) approach directly addresses the MDGs.14 The policy\u2019s corner \nstones are (i) expanded coverage of the health service network to peripheral areas, (ii) health \ncare for women of reproductive age and children under 5 years, (iii) full community participation, \n(iv) dissemination of health information to people in rural areas, (v) use of resources with a \nsound scientific basis and appropriate to the actual situation and needs, (vi) collaboration with \nother government sectors and with the private sector, (vii) more support for a more effective \nPHC program, and (viii) sustainability of health care services at every level through community \ncontributions to and ownership of the services. The family, school, and pagoda will be the focal \npoints for PHC implementation in the villages. \n \n13.  The MOH has prepared the Health Development Plan (2006\u20132010),15 and is preparing \npolicies, plans, and decrees for HRD, nutrition, the package of health services, and integration \nand decentralization of health services. The Plan emphasizes efforts to increase the number of \nfemales  and  members  of  small  ethnic  groups  among  health  workers.  The  expansion  and \nimprovement of the PHC network has obvious financial implications for the Government. The \nNSEDP6 lays out the Government\u2019s overall strategy for increasing and providing more efficient \nfunding of the health sector, along with improving donor coordination. Another health financing \npriority under the plan is making health services more affordable to the poor by introducing \nhealth insurance and health equity funds (HEFs). The Government has also approved the \nCurative Law (now called Health Care Law), which is expected to improve financing of health \nservices and includes adjustments in cost recovery that are likely to have impact on the poor.  \n    \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 1999. Policy for the Health Sector. Manila. PHC is aimed at providing physical, financial, and social access to \na basic package of promotive, preventive, and curative health services from the community to the first referral \nhospital. The services are to be of high quality, built around the needs of the community, involve the community, \nand delivered efficiently using appropriate technology. In Lao PDR, the provincial hospital is also a first referral \nhospital providing basic surgery. \n15 Ministry of Health, The Lao PDR. 2006. Sixth Five Year Health Development Plan, 2006\u20132010.

The poor use health services less than those in higher-income groups.16 In rural areas, \nhouseholds in the highest income quintile have an inpatient admission rate of 42.4 per 1,000 \npersons per year, compared with 15.9 per 1,000 per year for households in the lowest quintile. \nWhile physical access has improved substantially in the past decade, half the population lives at \nleast one hour walk from a health center or a hospital. Low population density and fiscal and \nhuman resource constraints limit the potential for improving access to health facilities, and \nvillage-based health care has been introduced to complement these services.    \n \n15.  Services for women and infants are less accessible and often not up to standard in \nhealth centers and hospitals. This partly explains why there is less progress in reducing the \nMMR, infant mortality rate, and low-birth-weight rate. Unless rural women and ethnic groups are \nreached with reproductive health services, these targets will remain elusive. However, a major \nreduction of the MMR is achievable with basic interventions, such as teenage education, family \nplanning in the villages, timely referral of reproductive complications, and surgical services. The \nissue of low affordability of care is discussed in section B6.    \n \n16.  Additional social barriers exist for isolated ethnic groups. Ethnic groups in the Lao PDR \nare  classified  into  four  linguistic  groups:  Tai-Kadai  (44%),  Mon-Kmer  (33%),  Hmong-Mien \n(16%), and Sino-Tibetan (7%). Many of these groups live in rural areas (90%), are subsistence \nfarmers (83%), and are poor (46%). They use services less and are less educated about health \nmatters, such as HIV prevention.17 They generally prefer to consult health staff who speak their \nlanguage and understand their views. There is a paucity of health professionals from ethnic \ngroups largely because of comparatively lower educational attainment. A PHCEP pilot study \ndemonstrated that local students can be trained as PHC workers to serve in their own villages. \n \n17.  If the MDG to reduce child mortality by two thirds is to stay on track, common infectious \ndiseases affecting the rural poor, in particular ethnic groups, need to be addressed. These \ndiseases  can  be  prevented  with  simple,  highly  cost-effective  interventions  such  as \ninsecticide-treated  bednets,  better  personal  hygiene,  vaccination,  clean  water  supply  and \nsanitation, and timely recognition and basic treatment of common illnesses. However, progress \nhas been unstable because of management and service delivery problems, as discussed below.  \n \n18.   Malnutrition, a major contributor to child mortality, will also need to be addressed. When \nthere are no food shortages, it is foremost a child care problem that primarily needs household \nand  community  interventions  rather  than  health  services.  The  Government  is  preparing  a \nnutrition policy and plan to integrate nutrition into PHC. Nutrition among women and children \ncan be improved through specific, low-cost interventions such as the promotion of breastfeeding \nand a proper weaning diet, kitchen gardens, vitamin supplementation, and family planning.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n16 Lao PDR Public Expenditure Review, 2006 (draft). \n17 ADB. 2004. Country Gender Strategy: Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic: Gender, Poverty and the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Manila.  \n ", "  5 \n2.  Setting Health Sector Priorities \n19.  To achieve the international goal of Health for All, the MOH gives priority to developing a \npublic welfare system based on the principles of PHC. In view of the Government\u2019s financial and \ncapacity constraints, this translates into providing a basic health care package for all citizens \nwith special effort to reach the poor and near poor. The Government gives high priority to \nimproving healthcare for rural women and ethnic groups, and is striving to expand services to all \nvillages and houses. Overall, making the health system more effective, equitable, and efficient \nentails a shift to promoting health and nutrition, preventing diseases, improving service quality \nand affordability, and reaching remote villages, in particular women and ethnic groups with high \nresidual mortality. Doing so requires a shift in the mindset and practices of planners and \nmanagers, more and more balanced financing, better staffing, and better communication.  \n \n20.  The Government has taken several policy actions to strengthen the delivery of health \nservices. It has approved a reproductive health policy that includes maternal care and family \nplanning  in  villages,  and  training  of  midwives  and  surgeons.  Available  and  affordable \nemergency obstetric surgery in hospitals can potentially cut the MMR by about half and greatly \nreduce chronic complications due to childbirth. Considering the constraints of rural hospitals, \nseveral innovative approaches will have to be taken, including the training of medical doctors in \nbasic surgery, and the provision of incentives to staff posted to rural hospitals where there is no \nother means of income. The Government passed a regulation to introduce financial incentives \nfor rural civil servants (Decree No. 381/PM), but these incentives do not appear to be enough. \nAs HIV/AIDS will continue to spread, the Government and the Joint United Nations Programme \non HIV/AIDS have prepared a plan to widen prevention efforts to reach all high-risk groups.  \n \n3.  PHC Organization and Management Capacity \n21.  A  major  problem  hampering  the  integration  of  PHC  is  the  vertical  management  of \ndisease control through central programs, leading to fragmentation and inefficiency at lower \nlevels of implementation. Rather than pooling their resources and activities in the districts and \nvillages, health service providers are obliged to implement vertical program activities separately. \nMuch of this behavior is reinforced by donors who fund specific projects or programs and restrict \nthe use of funds, equipment, medicines, and other supplies. For example, the maternal and \nchild health and immunization programs, both vertical programs, have done poorly for many \nyears, with limited management capacity, fragmented and unstable assistance, and, for the safe \nmotherhood program, an inability to scale up. Their integration in PHC has been slow.    \n \n22.  With the ongoing decentralization, the roles of provincial and district governments are \nless clear. There is a mismatch between the responsibilities of provincial and district health \nmanagers and their resources. Limited local stewardship and involvement in sector performance \nfurther impede the ability of health managers to respond to public demand. Because of the \nimplications and risks involved, competent provincial health managers are often reluctant to take \ninitiatives to improve services. \n  \n23.  District managers, to varying degrees, lack capacity in such areas as planning and \nbudgeting, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation. Managers are often doctors \nor medical assistants without appropriate management training. A new generation of energetic- \nmanagers is emerging in the districts, but most have received only short-term management \ntraining. Almost all provincial health officers now have a master\u2019s degree in public health, \n ", "6   \ncompared with only about half in 1999.18 But only a few MOH officers have nonmedical training \nin such areas as health economics, administration, and HRD.  \n \n24.  The current organizational structure and limited management capacity in the health \nsystem have serious implications. National health policies and regulations are often not fully \nimplemented  by  local  governments.  Facility-based  and  outreach  services  are  fragmented, \nirregular, and of poor quality, resulting in a loss of public confidence. Also given the uncertain \nbenefit of using public services, associated costs of services are often unacceptable. The MOH \nplans to move toward provincial results-based programs to integrate programs and services and \nimprove ownership, accountability, and flexibility. But management training, advocacy among \nstakeholders, pilot-testing, and supporting administrative and fund flow arrangements will be \nneeded to achieve this goal.  \n \n4.  Improving Staff Performance \n25.  The NSEDP6 and the PHC policy draw attention to the issue of health service quality. \nThe performance of health facilities is affected by inappropriate staffing or understaffing. The \nhigh  ratio  of  doctors  to  other  medical  staff  in  health  facilities  leads  to  health  system \ninefficiencies. There is one doctor for every 1.7 mid-level staff instead of the stated MOH goal of \nthree to four nurses per doctor, and one to two nurses per medical assistant. At the same time, \nhowever, surveys show that one third of the district hospitals are without a doctor (footnote 13).  \n \n26.  PHC services are also affected by the type of training that health professionals receive. \nThe past emphasis on training sufficient numbers of health staff has had implications for the \nquality of the staff. Despite their participation in several in-service training programs, providers \nof maternal and child health services were found to have inadequate knowledge, skills, and \nattitude to provide accurate information and appropriate services to clients.19 For lack of funds \nand opportunities for clinical and laboratory training, many medical professionals did not receive \nadequate skills beyond classroom theory before they were sent to work in health facilities. With \nthe increase in enrollment of self-financed students, the quality of training has deteriorated \nfurther. Also, some staff are in positions for which they have not received pre-service training, \nsuch as nurses working as laboratory technicians.  \n \n27.  Staff management functions, such as providing regular feedback to staff, ensuring even \ndistribution  of  workload,  promoting  quality,  and  encouraging  participation,  also  need \nimprovement. Health center staff, lacking transport and an operational budget, only make a few \nsupervisory visits to VHVs each year. The problem of limited supervision at lower levels is \ncompounded by a lack of accountability. The lack of equipment, funds, and information also \naffect staff motivation and the quality of services. \n \n5.  Improving Recurrent Cost Financing  \n \n28.  The serious underfunding of the health sector contributes directly to low performance \nand presents a serious challenge to the Government, given the fiscal constraints and poverty \nlevels. Within these resource constraints, however, there is substantial scope for improvement. \nMuch of the emphasis in the past few years has been on investments in new health facilities \nwith the laudable purpose of improving access to health services of a higher standard. But this \n                                                 \n18 Bonnet, Frederic. 1999. Organizational Structure and Management of the Public Health Sector in Lao PDR. \nVientiane; and ADB 1998.

Vientiane.    \n ", "  7 \ndevelopment  has  not  been  matched  with  funding  to  cover  the  recurrent  costs  of  the \ninvestments. Staff salaries are relatively low (and often not paid on time) but the non-salary \nrecurrent budget, at about 7% of the provincial health budget, is very low as well. Health \nfacilities must generate an operating budget from overhead on the sale of medicines, thereby \nmaking health services less affordable and encouraging overprescription. The recurrent budget  \nmust increase about fourfold to cover the recurrent costs of health facilities. The goals of greater \nequity and improved service quality are thus undermined. The MOH will have to cut back on its \ninvestments  and  make  the  best  use  of  limited  resources  by  strengthening  planning  and \nbudgeting,  economic  analysis,  health  personnel  planning,  and  provincial  and  district \nmanagement capacity.     \n \n29.  Cost recovery was introduced in the Lao PDR in the early 1990s, mainly through the \nsale of drugs financed from DRFs. Based on 1999 data, domestically financed government \nspending is less than the contribution from user fees.20 The MOH estimates that more than half \nof the operating costs of central and provincial hospitals and one third of those of district \nhospitals are now met through cost recovery. Under a new Curative Law, the Decree on Fees \nand Charges (December 2005) allows public agencies to expand the types of charges and fees \nfor services, and to use revenue from fees to cover salaries and other recurrent costs. However, \nthe concern is that, even with expanded cost recovery, there might be no net increase in health \nsector financing because of a reduction in the central budget allocation, as revenue is integrated \nwith the formal fiscal year budget. The actual surplus from the estimated fee income will go to \nthe Treasury, and actual deficits in anticipated fee income may lead to central budget subsidies \nonly after a formal audit.  \n \n6.  Making Health Care Affordable to the Poor \n30.  While user fees play an important role in health system financing, they are not the \nsolution to the problem of underfunding for the recurrent costs of health facilities. Studies \naround  the  world  have  shown  that  user  fees  at  public  facilities,  even  with  accompanying \nexemption schemes for the poor, deter the poor from using health services.  \n \n31.  Low affordability of services, especially for the poor, is believed to be a major cause of \nunderutilization of services in the Lao PDR. The income disparity between the poor and nonpoor \nhas increased, and the cost of health care has gone up substantially over the past several \nyears. The introduction of cost recovery for drugs is likely to have made health care even less \naffordable, and the new Decree on Fees and Charges under the Curative Law may exacerbate \nmatters. While the poor are unable to pay for services, there is not enough public finance to \nprovide them with free services.  \n \n32.  Households obtain about 90% of their medicine needs through out-of-pocket spending. \nThis implies that free medicines are very limited in the health system and the poor may not be \ngetting the medicines they need. A market is thus created for cheap counterfeit drugs that are \nunsafe and contribute to drug-resistant diseases. Exemptions for the poor are supposed to be \ncovered by the DRF and government contributions. According to Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) estimates, exemptions for hospital services range between 2.2% and 21.1% of the DRF. \nThis level of funding is not enough to cover the needs of the poor. \n \n                                                 \n20 Schwartz, J.

None of the three formal health insurance schemes\u2014civil servant health insurance, \nsocial  security  fund,  and  community-based  health  insurance\u2014benefits  the  poor.  These \nschemes, with a total coverage of 1% of the population, are not a viable option for making the \nservices  more  affordable  to  the  poor  in  the  medium  term.  HEFs  have  been  successfully \npilot-tested in a few districts to compensate hospitals for the \u201closs\u201d they incur when treating the \npoor. The MOH wants to widen the application of HEFs.  \n \nC.  Lessons  \n34.  ADB, the World Bank, and bilateral agencies have assisted the Government of the Lao \nPDR in putting in place a basic network of hospitals, health centers, and village activities, and \nPHC coverage has improved substantially. The PHC Project21 was aimed at expanding access \nto  basic  health  services  through  health  centers  in  two  provinces  and  was  evaluated  as \nsuccessful.22 The well-performing PHCEP (footnote 12) has a more comprehensive approach \nincluding hospital services and village-based health care in eight northern provinces, and the \nstrengthening of provincial management nationwide. A similar approach is followed by the World \nBank in the southern provinces.           \n \n35.  A major issue under the PHCEP was how to shift focus from inputs (in particular, civil \nworks) to outcomes, given the challenge of navigating complex procurement procedures to \nensure quality inputs. It was felt that technical staff should preferably not be involved in project \nadministration but concentrate on outcomes. The PHCEP proved its flexibility by making some \nadjustments when a shortfall in indicators, in particular for immunization, was noted.  \n \n36.  Experience  in  the  PHCEP  demonstrated  the  difficulty  of  integrating  the  centrally \nmanaged  vertical  health  programs  at  provincial  and  district  levels.  Essentially,  two  factors \naccounted for this difficulty. Vertical programs typically do not allow for sharing resources and \npooling funds, making joint activities difficult, and PHC is often perceived as a vertical program \nitself. Strong provincial leadership can, however, foster greater integration of health programs.  \n \n37.  The PHCEP showed the effectiveness of using a geographic information system in \nhealth service zoning to plan the location of new health centers. This approach greatly reduced \nthe number of health centers that needed to be built, and optimized the catchment area for each \nhealth  center,  thereby  making  the  investments  more  efficient.  In  addition,  a  village  health \nprogram was added to improve access for villages located more than 2 hours walking from a \nhealth facility.   \n \n38.  To find staff for remote health centers, under PHCEP, school students living near health \ncenters were selected and provided with vocational training. This practice produced health \nworkers who were integrated and able to thrive in the local community. The recruits committed \nto working in the health center for several years. Given the low school attainment in these \nlocations, about one third of trainees, especially among the women, were first given general \neducation to qualify for vocational training. The MOH is now extending this approach to other \ncadres.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 1995.

Under the PHCEP, the project management office built up considerable administrative \ncapacity and established strong provincial linkages, but could not spread this know-how in the \nMOH. Similar project procurement and financial management functions for foreign-assisted \nprojects are spread over several departments in the MOH, involving large transaction costs, \nduplication, project delays, competition for limited staff time and consultants, and other adverse \neffects. Mainstreaming and integrating project administration in the MOH, as a building block for \nharmonized external assistance in accordance with the Paris Declaration, is therefore desirable. \n \nD.  External Assistance \n40.  The Lao health sector has seen a substantial shift in donor assistance over the past \n5 years. Several bilateral donors have been phasing out their programs as global funds moved \nin.  The  MOH\u2019s  Health  Development  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  presents  a  budget  of  $323  million, \nimplying  a  doubling  in  public  spending.  Donors  have  pledged  $99  million  in  contributions, \ncompared  with  the  proposed  $177  million.  With  a  planned  share  of  $44  million  from  the \nGovernment and a community share of $32 million, the expected funding gap over 5 years is \n$71 million. External assistance to Lao\u2019s health sector is summarized in Appendix 2.      \n \n41.  External assistance to the health sector is fragmented and typically supports a specific \nsubsector  or  geographic  area.  PHC  and  communicable  disease  control  receive  the  most \nfunding. Assistance for HRD is mostly for in-service training under various projects. The Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency supports nursing education.   \n \n42.  PHC in the north is being supported by ADB, and in the south by the World Bank, while \nPHC models have been pilot-tested by the Australian Agency for International Development, \nBelgian  Technical  Cooperation,  the  Government  of  Luxembourg,  and  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency.  PHC  projects  follow  similar  approaches  but  need  to  be  harmonized \nfurther. Maternal and child health, nutrition, and immunization are being supported as separate \nprograms by the United Nations and other agencies, and need to be integrated with PHC. The \npullout of several bilateral agencies has led to a decline in funding for PHC in recent years.  \n \n43.  In communicable disease control, the establishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \nTuberculosis  and  Malaria  has  significantly  increased  funding  for  malaria  and  tuberculosis \ncontrol, and recently also for HIV/AIDS (footnote 8). ADB and the World Health Organization \nsupport  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Regional  Communicable  Diseases  Control  Project \nincluding  disease  surveillance  and  outbreak  response.23 ADB  is  also  supporting  regional \ncooperation and an emergency fund for avian influenza preparedness and control.24    \n \n \n                                                 \n23 ADB. 2005.

The goal of the Project is to improve health and nutrition in the Lao PDR, particularly \namong the poor, women and children, and ethnic groups in the eight northern provinces. Its aim \nis to improve health and nutrition behavior and use of health services and make the provincial \nhealth system more effective, efficient, and equitable in delivering PHC.  \n \n45.  The objectives of the Project are (i) to improve PHC delivery, particularly for vulnerable \ngroups, in the eight northern provinces, and (ii) to strengthen MOH capacity for health system \ndevelopment nationwide, including planning and budgeting, financing, HRD, and coordination. \nThe  Project  has  two  corresponding  components  and  is  based  on  a  two-phased  PHC \ndevelopment concept covering 8 years, with the Project supporting the first phase of 4 years \n(2007\u20132011). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 3.  \n \n46.  The Project is set within the framework of the NSEDP6 and PHC policy, and supports \ntheir expected outcomes, priorities, and plans. It will contribute to the improvement of key health \nindicators to achieve the MDGs in the medium term, and to health system development to \nsustain health benefits in the longer term. The ADB-supported PHCEP and other projects in the \neight northern provinces helped establish a considerable network of health facilities. The MOH \nhas  requested  ADB  to  help  improve  the  functioning  and  use  of  the  PHC  network  while \nexpanding PHC to remote populations without such services. About 19 out of 62 districts in the \neight northern provinces still have substantial populations living in social and physical isolation.  \n \n47.  The MOH is moving from a traditional, input-driven, centralized public health system to a \nmodern, results-based health system with strong community participation and novel ways of \novercoming barriers in public education and PHC delivery. For PHC to become more effective, \nefficient, and equitable, and benefit those who need it most, the fragmented health system must \nbe better integrated and substantially decentralized. Building on the strong relationship that ADB \nhas formed with the MOH in health system development over the past decade, the Project will \nsupport the strengthening of policy and capacity for health system development nationwide. \nProject support for sector policies is summarized in Appendix 4.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n1.  Component 1: Improving PHC Delivery   \n \n48.  ADB  has  been  supporting  the  eight  northern  provinces  under  the  PHC  Expansion \nProject (footnote 12), and wants to continue supporting this region in view of the poor health \nstatus of its people, many of them from ethnic groups, the high level of poverty, ADB\u2019s current \nrole in the development of this region, and the need to further enhance the impact of past \ninvestments. The first component is therefore concerned with improving PHC delivery in eight \nnorthern provinces and includes three subcomponents: (i) improving PHC management and \nquality of care; (ii) increasing access to PHC, in particular for women and ethnic groups; and \n(iii) increasing PHC financing and affordability for the poor.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "  11 \na.  Improving PHC Management and Quality of Care  \n     \n49.  According to government policy, PHC is to be the overarching principle that integrates \nservices and programs, including those for maternal and child health, nutrition, immunization, \nand communicable disease control, into one comprehensive approach. Government instructions \nfor decentralized, integrated management have largely not been implemented for lack of central \nsupport, managerial know-how and motivation, and limited pooling of resources. Good practices \nin Xaignabouri and Xiang Khouang provinces and other successful pilot areas are being studied \nwith  the  intention  of implementing  these  more  widely,  as  appropriate.25 PHC  management \nguidelines developed under the PHCEP for all levels will be improved further and implemented \nwith the help of a PHC system expert, who will also work as chief technical adviser.   \n \n50.  The  Project  will  support  the  eight  northern  provinces  to  strengthen  district  PHC \nmanagement and introduce the results-based approach (it will support the provinces in strategic \nplanning in component 2). District teams in the eight northern provinces will be assisted in \npreparing annual plans and budgets, with the help of a supplementary grant based on the \nsatisfactory achievement of specific targets, activities, and outputs. The provincial management \nteams will be assisted in supporting the implementation and monitoring of these plans. Reasons \nfor noncompliance in management procedures and poor performance will be examined, and \naddressed,  as  possible.  Analytical  capacity  at  the  central  and  provincial  levels  will  be \nstrengthened  (see  component  2).  Because  appropriate  health  management  information  is \nessential for results-based planning, the data collection and reporting system will be improved.  \n \n51.  Given an appropriate policy framework and basic resources, capable management is the \ndriving force for better PHC delivery. District health managers are central to achieving better \nhealth outcomes, by planning ahead, negotiating support, coordinating resources, motivating \nstaff, pursuing high-quality care, and tracking performance. Around the world, the performance \nof district health managers has been associated with achieving results. The Project will support  \nin-service  training  of  district  health  managers  that  will  be  intermittent,  skill-based,  and \ninteractive, using available know-how from other countries. Successful classroom work and field \nassignments  for  a  total  duration  of  3  months  will  be  awarded  with  a  certificate  in  PHC \nmanagement. The Project will thereby help groom a new generation of health managers. After \nthe training, the district managers are expected to be familiar with the basics of results-based \ndistrict health management including planning and budgeting, integrated PHC delivery, and \nfinancial and personnel management. For well-performing district health managers, the Project \nwill offer two regional master-level scholarships in public health each year.  \n \n52.  The Project will help establish an Internet network for district health offices in at least  \nhalf of the Project districts including software development, equipment, training, and recurrent \ncosts. This network will be linked to the MOH statistical unit, which will also be strengthened \n(see component 2). The Project will likewise support in-service training for about 1 week per \nyear  for  all  health  center  managers,  in  such  topics  as  integrated  PHC  services  and \nmanagement, outreach services, supervision of the village health and nutrition program, work \nplanning, technical standards, monitoring, and reporting. \n \n53.  On the technical side, the Project will support the eight northern provinces in improving \nthe  quality  of  care  at  all  levels.  Substantial  progress  was  made  under  PHCEP  and  other \nprojects. However, the inadequate practical skills of staff, lack of standards and supervision, \n                                                 \n25  E.g., training programs in provincial and district health management (PHCEP); district management manual (Swiss \nRed Cross); provincial financial management manual (Belgian Technical Cooperation). \n ", "12   \nad hoc in-service training, and outdated equipment continue to be common problems. The MOH \nis now updating the standards and job descriptions for district hospitals and VHVs, and has \nalready approved a similar package for health centers. The Project will help implement these \nguidelines through workshops and training activities. \n \n54.  At health centers, the Project will address shortages of staff, particularly female staff and \nstaff from ethnic groups, by continuing the successful PHC worker training program begun in \n2002 under the PHCEP. Under this program, students were recruited from the vicinity of health \ncenters with a staff shortage, and trained on scholarship for 2.5 years to become PHC workers. \nBridging education was provided to candidates who did not meet education prerequisites. Under \nthe Project, at least 48 students will be provided with bridging education and 275 PHC workers \nwill be trained, to meet the current shortfalls. The MOH will recruit the candidates, preferably \nfemales and members of ethnic groups.  \n \n55.  The MOH also proposes to create the position of PHC officer, similar to the former job of \nmedical assistant. While PHC workers address an immediate need, further improvement of the \nquality of care needs better-trained staff. The PHC officer would be a mid-level PHC manager \nand provider posted in rural facilities. The MOH plans to build a regional school for PHC officers \nin Louang Phrabang, with civil works to be completed by the Government with private sector \nsupport. The feasibility study was done under the PHCEP. The Project will provide managerial \nand technical support for school and hostel developments, equipment and furniture, curriculum \ndevelopment, and stipends for the first two batches of students. In selecting students, the MOH \nwill use an approach similar to the one being used in selecting PHC workers.  \n    \n56.  The Project will help strengthen the in-service training program to address the lack of \npractical skills of staff, and incorporate the program in the recurrent budget (under component \n2). On average, one staff per health center and three staff per district health office and hospital \nwill receive in-service training each year. The Project will support the preparation of training \npackages, training of trainers, and provision of training materials. It will also make available \nequipment and interactive audiovisual software for training (a recent pilot study for immunization \nwas highly successfully). Competent practitioners will be trained as teachers (see component \n2). In addition to short-term training, 240 provincial, 88 national, and 20 regional scholarships \nwill be provided. An important aspect of the program is the continuity of in-service training, \ninstead of the current ad hoc and project-based approach. \n \n57.  The  Project  will  also  provide  eight  multipurpose  vehicles  for  provincial  outreach, \nincluding audiovisual equipment for road shows, and drugs to supplement those covered by the \nDRFs for district hospitals and health centers. Outdated equipment at health centers will be \nreplaced as needed.  \n \nb.  Increasing Access to PHC  \n \n58.  In  the  eight  northern  provinces,  the  PHCEP  has  been  supporting  a  village  health \nprogram for all villages beyond a 2-hour walk from a health facility. A total of 6,064 village health \nvolunteers have been trained and provided with drug kits for basic curative care. The demand \nfor these services has been very high. To complement village health care, and in the light of \nexperience gained from the HIV prevention program, a peer education program was pilot-tested  \nto  improve  health  and nutrition  behavior  in  the  family  and  community.  This  approach  has \nproduced various successful health and nutrition initiatives in the villages.  \n \n ", "  13 \n59.  The Project will support the upgrading of about 6,000 VHVs and the training of 1,000 \nnew VHVs. The distribution of village drug kits will be expanded to selected villages, and 1,000 \nbicycles  will  be  provided  to  help  restock  medicines.  The  peer  education  program  will  be \nexpanded to 3,800 villages (82% of the total in the eight provinces). Village health committees \nwill  be  mobilized,  and  12,800  peer  educators  will  be  trained  in  health  care  and  nutrition \npromotion, in schools and elsewhere. The MOH is developing a nutrition policy and action plan \nto  address  serious  malnutrition.  The  Project  will  support  the  implementation  of  accepted \nnutrition interventions by providing education and supplies like micronutrients and anthelmintics.  \n \n60.  The Project will make safe motherhood services more accessible to rural populations. \nMidwives will be trained, and selected hospitals will be upgraded to enable them to provide \nemergency obstetric services. In-service training in safe motherhood and delivery skills has \nbeen pilot-tested successfully under the current PHCEP. Certificate training in basic obstetric \ncare will be provided for 3 months to 340 health center staff. In addition, 36 nurse-midwives \nfrom remote districts will be given scholarships for 3-year preservice training. Students from \nremote districts often cannot afford the considerable fees, as a visit to regional nursing schools \nrevealed. Women with basic literacy including traditional birth attendants will be encouraged to \nbecome VHVs, and VHVs will be trained to refer emergencies to nearby health facilities.   \n \n61.   As much as half of the MMR is attributed to lack of access to emergency services. The \nProject will therefore support the upgrading of the Paklay and Xienghone (Xaignabouri) district \nhospitals to type A hospitals, and the construction of type B hospitals in Viengxay (Houaphan) \nand Nateuy (Louang Namtha), to provide obstetric and other emergency services. The Project \nwill support environmentally sound facilities and equipment, and training and monitoring in \nwaste  management.  It  will  also  provide  16  ambulances  for  district  hospitals,  and  replace \noutdated hospital equipment. The Project will likewise explore the possibility of a hardship \nallowance for health staff in district hospitals and health centers and expedite it where possible \non a pilot basis.   \n \n62.  The Project will support the expansion of basic health services through the construction \nof health centers for populations that have little or no access to these services, usually ethnic \nminority populations in remote areas. Ten new health centers will be built. The Project will also \nsupport the replacement of 11 old health centers and the repair of 40 others, out of a total of \n335 health centers. New as well as refurbished centers will be equipped.   \n \nc.  Increasing PHC Financing and Affordability for the Poor \n63.  The Project will help (i) improve health care financing, and (ii) pilot-test a provincial HEF \nfor the poor. The funding of recurrent costs in the health sector has been very low. Hospitals \nand health centers received supplementary funds for operations under several projects. Such \nfunding has had major impact on PHC delivery, and will also be supported under the Project. \nThis budget will be linked to results such as output of the health facilities. Provincial and district \nhospitals and offices will be reimbursed for actual expenditures, and health centers will be \nextended modest grants-in-aid.  \n     \n64.  The Project will make health care more affordable to about 185,000 poor people in three \nprovinces (Xaignabouri, Xiangkhouang, and Oudomxai) through province-wide HEF. All those \nliving below the poverty line26 (about 25% in the targeted provinces) will be able to benefit from \n                                                 \n26 The poverty line used here is defined as (i) a food poverty line, or (ii) an overall poverty line. The food poverty line \nthreshold is 2,100 calories per day per person, which the World Health Organization and other international \n ", "14   \nthe HEF. A system of means testing is already in place, and the poor have been identified. \nReimbursements will be paid out of the HEF for all public health care costs and transportation \nfor emergencies including obstetric emergencies; such costs are often a major barrier to access \nfor the poor. Reimbursements from the HEF will cover the health service expenses of the poor \non a fee-for-service basis for hospitals, and a capitation basis for health centers and VHVs. \nTrained fund management committees, trained staff, field support, fund management oversight \nby  an  accounting  firm,  and  technical  support  will  be  needed  to  implement  the  HEF.  The \nimplementation design of the HEF is outlined in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n2.  Component 2: Strengthening Capacity for Health System Development  \n65.  This component will support the MOH and the 17 provinces in (i) strengthening capacity \nfor HRD, (ii) strengthening planning and budgeting, and (iii) integrating project administration \nand coordination.   \n \na.  Strengthening MOH Capacity for HRD  \n \n66.  The Department of Organization and Personnel (DOP) must be strengthened to improve \nits capacity to carry out its mandate. The Project will support the DOP with three scholarships \n(in  policy  and  planning,  teaching  methodology,  and  human  resource  management),  four \n3-month attachments to human resource departments in the region, and operational support. \nThe Project will also provide a long-term consultant and support the HRD task force.  \n \n67.  For  better  workforce  planning  and  management,  the  Project  will  strengthen  the \nmanagement information system for the MOH workforce through a national survey of health \npersonnel and an improved staff personnel database. It will also support the strengthening of \nhuman  resource  management  including  the  revision  of  the  manual  on  health  personnel \noperations  and  management,  and  support  for  an  orientation  program  for  new  staff,  job \ndescriptions for the provinces (currently being prepared), and performance appraisal tools.  \n  \n68.  To improve the quality of training programs for lower and mid-level staff, as the DOP \nplans  to  do,  the  Project  will support  the  development  of  training standards,  the  review  of \ncurricula,  the  assessment  of  graduates,  the  strengthening  of  in-service  training,  and  the \ndevelopment of standard in-service training modules on key topics. The capacity of provincial \ntrainers will also be strengthened, annual provincial training plans developed, and training \nmaterials  and  supplies  provided  under  this  component.  Education  planning,  skill  training, \nimproved teaching methods, need-based training, and impact assessment will be emphasized.  \n \n69.  The Project will facilitate the development of the national human resource policy and \nlong-term strategic human resource plan being prepared by the MOH. In coordination with \ngovernment  agencies,  the  Project  will  support  induction  to  international  workforce  policy, \nplanning,  and  management  practices;  policy  planning  through  the  HRD  task  force; \ndissemination activities; and monitoring.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \norganizations have determined to be the basic requirement for people in Lao PDR. Those with less than this daily \ncalorie intake are considered to be living below the food poverty line. The cost of acquiring this intake plus 20% for \nnonfood necessities determines the overall poverty line. Source: Government of Lao PDR. 2004.

For provincial health systems to move toward a comprehensive, results-based program \napproach and deliver effective, efficient, and equitable care, several building blocks must be in \nplace  including  strong  MOH  stewardship,  provincial  commitment  and  resources  for  health, \nintegrated  planning  and  budgeting,  and  integrated  project  administration.  The  Project  will \nsupport several of these building blocks in coordination with other stakeholders.    \n     \n71.  The Project will help strengthen strategic planning and budgeting in 17 provinces based \non the concept of an integrated provincial health system pilot-tested in several districts. Under \nthe guidance of the provincial committee for health, provincial health management teams will \nconduct a strategic planning exercise to improve their 5-year plans and prepare medium-term \nexpenditure frameworks showing all likely sources and uses of funds, among others, to ensure \nadequate funding of basic public health functions and recurrent expenditures. These plans will \nbe  used  in  preparing  annual  plans  and  budgets  for  provincial  health  system  development \naccording to national targets and local priorities. The Project will support the orientation of \nprovincial governments and other stakeholders; the preparation of guidelines, standards, and \nprocedures  for  strategic  planning  and  budgeting;  staff  training;  international  and  national \nconsulting services; and the provision of equipment and vehicles, and operational support.       \n \n72.     To strengthen the analytical capacity of the MOH in health economics and financing, the \nProject will support the division of health financing in the Department of Planning and Budgeting \n(DPB)  of  the  MOH.  Three  scholarships  in  health  economics  and  health  policy,  consulting \nservices, and financing studies will be supported (see also Supplementary Appendix B).  \n \n73.  Given the challenges of developing risk pooling systems in the Lao PDR, cost recovery \nwill remain the predominant mode of financing for non-salary recurrent costs. Under the new \nCurative Law (2006), hospitals and health centers can now charge for fees and hospital stay, \nbesides charging for medicines and diagnostic services. While this makes costing more realistic, \nit will also increase charges and cause the poor and near-poor further hardship. The Project will \nsupport health financing studies including (i) the impact of the new Curative Law; (ii) hospital \npricing, to set HEF reimbursement rates for services for the poor; (iii) HEF performance; (iv) use \nof loan funds; and (v) results-based supplementary operational financing. The division of health \nfinancing will be assisted in systematically tracking and monitoring all sources and uses of funds \nin the health sector. The studies are listed in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n    c.  Integrating Project Administration and Coordination \n \n74.  Administrative project implementation capacity is poorly distributed within the MOH. It is \nlocked-in under a few projects and often not sustained when projects are completed, resulting in \nconsiderable inefficiencies in the MOH. The MOH plans to mainstream project management \ncapacity. Combining the administration of several externally funded interventions in the health \nsector will improve MOH capacity and efficiency, and foster synergies between projects. The \nProject will support the strengthening of DPB to enable it to handle routine administrative \nfunctions  including  civil  works,  procurement  of  goods,  financial  management,  and  general \nproject administration. Technical functions and coordination with agencies will remain with the \nconcerned technical units. A major responsibility will be to improve the flow of funds and \nfinancial management of projects. DPB will also strengthen the capacity of the provinces in \nfinancial management by standardizing and improving financial management systems. The \nProject will support initial design and regulatory work, and administrative and capacity-building \noperations for 4 years. An accounting firm will be hired to oversee the financial management of \n ", "16   \nDPB and train its staff. A project coordination unit will be responsible for ADB matters, while all \nadministrative and technical matters will be mainstreamed in the MOH.  \n \nC.  Project Investment Plan  \n \n75.  The Project is estimated to cost $15.0 million equivalent for the 4-year period (October \n2007\u2013September 2011), including taxes, duties, and contingencies (Table 1). At base costs, \nimproving PHC delivery is estimated to cost $11.2 million (81%), and strengthening capacity in \nhealth system development, $2.6 million (19%). Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5.   \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n \n76.  ADB will provide a grant of $13.0 million from its Special Funds resources to cover 87% \nof the total project cost. The Government will provide $2.0 million equivalent in counterpart \nfunds.27 Table 2 shows the financing plan according to source of funds. Appendix 5 gives the \ndetails of the plan.   \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n ($ million) \n \nItem  Amount \nA.     Base Costs   \n  1.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.   Project Management \n \n77.  The executing agency (EA) for the Project will be the MOH, through DPB. The project \ndirector will be the director of DPB, who will be assisted by a project coordination unit. The \nProject will be implemented otherwise through DPB and the departments concerned\u2014primarily \nDOP and eight PHOs\u2014as implementing agencies, and in coordination with the Cabinet, and the \nCurative, Prevention and Hygiene, Food and Drug, and Inspection departments of the MOH. \nThe project organization structure is in Appendix 6.  \n \n78.  The MOH Steering Committee will provide overall guidance in project implementation. \nThe steering committee is chaired by the Minister of Health, and comprises representatives of \ndepartments of the MOH. Representatives of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of \nEducation, the Committee for Planning and Investment, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the \nPrime Minister\u2019s Office will join the committee as required. The MOH has also established task \nforces  for  HRD,  PHC,  and  health  financing;  these  will  meet  monthly  to  provide  technical \nguidance in these subsectors.  \n \n79.  The project coordination unit will be responsible for (i) providing project coordination, \n(ii) coordinating with departments and agencies, (iii) preparing and managing the annual plan \nand  budget,  (iv) providing  guidance  to  implementing  agencies,  (v)  monitoring  social  and \nenvironmental  safeguards,  (vi)  ensuring  that  ADB  requirements  are  being  complied  with, \n(vii) monitoring and evaluating the Project, (viii) submitting quarterly progress and financial \nreports, and (ix) conducting reviews and surveys. The unit will be managed by two deputy \ndirectors and a planning and budgeting officer.    \n \n80.  DPB will be responsible for (i) the procurement of goods and services, (ii) consulting \nservices, and (iii) administrative and financial management. The Project will support DPB with \ncontractual staff for administration, accounting, procurement, civil works, and monitoring.  \n \n81.  In each province, the Project will be managed directly by the PHO, through the existing \nPHC coordinating unit. The PHC coordinating unit will absorb the program implementation office \nof  the  PHCEP  to  mainstream  administrative  capacity.  The  provincial  steering  committee, \nchaired by the vice governor, and including representatives of the PHO, the provincial planning \nand budgeting department, the Lao Women\u2019s Union, and other offices, will provide oversight to \nthe provincial project activities. Similar arrangements will be made in the districts, while the \nvillage health committees will oversee implementation in the villages.   \n   \n2.  Implementation Period \n82.  The Project will be implemented over 4 years, from 1 October 2007 to 30 September \n2011, and the grant will close by 31 March 2012. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n83.  All ADB-financed procurement will be done according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The procurement plan with indicative contract packages \nis in Appendix 8. Goods and services $100,000 and above and all civil works will be procured \nthrough national competitive bidding. Vehicles will be procured through the United Nations \n ", "18   \nsystem; its procurement procedures are acceptable to ADB. Minor goods and services other \nthan civil works and vehicles costing less than $100,000 may be procured through shopping.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n84.  The Project will require five international consultants for a total of 47 person-months, five \nnational consultants for a total of 90 person-months, and architect and accounting services. The \ninternational experts in PHC systems (21 person-months), health policy and planning (6 person-\nmonths) and health economics (8 person-months) will be hired as individual consultants in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s procedures for hiring consultants. The architect and accounting services \nwill  be  hired  through  separate  firms  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time), using the biodata technical proposal and \nconsultant  qualification  selection  or  least-cost  selection  method.  Other  consultants  will  be \ncontracted through one firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, \nusing the fixed budget selection method and biodata technical proposal. This package includes \ninternational experts in HRD (9 person-months) and social development (3 person-months); and \nnational  experts  in  health  information  (24  person-months),  health  policy  and  planning  (12 \nperson-months),  HRD  (24  person-months),  health  care  financing  (24  person-months),  and \nsocial development (6 person-months). Outline terms of reference for the consulting services \nare in Appendix 9.  \n \n5.  Advance Contracting \n \n85.  The  MOH  will  take  advance  action  to  speed  up  project  implementation.  It  will  hire \ninternational and national consultants, train project and provincial staff to implement the Project, \nand prepare bidding documents for major civil works. ADB will not finance expenditures paid by \nthe Government before the grant takes effect. ADB\u2019s concurrence with advance action does not \ncommit ADB to finance the related expenditures under the Project or to finance the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n86.  The  project  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Each fiscal year, DPB will see \nto  it  that  each  participating  department  and  province  prepares  annual  reports,  plans,  and \nbudgets and has these approved by the MOH steering committee before any funds are released. \nThe MOH and the MOF will ensure the timely release of funds. Supplementary Appendix C \ndescribes the flow of funds.  \n \n87.   The MOF will open an imprest account for the Project at the Bank of Lao PDR. ADB will \ndeposit  in  the  account  an  estimated  6  months\u2019  expenditure  or  10%  of  the  grant  amount, \nwhichever is less. DPB of the MOH will open a second-generation imprest account to manage \nproject funds for the MOH at any bank acceptable to the MOH and ADB, and MOF will deposit \nan  estimated  6  months\u2019  expenditure  or  $500,000,  whichever  is  less,  in  this  account.  The \nstatement of expenditure (SOE) procedure may be used in obtaining reimbursement for eligible \nproject expenditures and in liquidating advances from the imprest account or replenishing the \naccount. The SOE procedure applies to contracts of not more than $100,000 equivalent per \npayment and to the liquidation of advances made from the imprest account according to the \nfinancial covenants of the grants. Detailed arrangements for establishing the imprest account \nand  the  SOE  procedure  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Adequate \nsupporting documentation, as defined in the Loan Disbursement Handbook, must be kept at \neach level of project management to substantiate all expenditures made with the grant proceeds.  \n ", "  19 \n \n  7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n88.  The EA will hire an accounting firm for financial management according to the terms of \nreference in Appendix 9. The MOH and the provincial governments will keep separate records \nand  accounts  for  the  Project,  identifying  the  goods  and  services  financed  with  the  grant \nproceeds. The EA has implemented similar projects financed by ADB and others in the last 10 \nyears.  Past  experience  and  the  results  of  the  assessment  indicate  satisfactory  financial \nmanagement capacity on the part of the EA (details are in Supplementary Appendix C).  \n \n89.  The State Audit Organization in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office or other certified auditor will \naudit each year all accounts and financial statements, SOEs and revenues, and activities in the \nimprest account related to the Project, according to auditing standards acceptable to ADB and \ninternational  accounting  and  auditing  standards.  Audited  financial  statements  and  project \naccounts, together with the report of the auditor, including the auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of \ngrant proceeds, compliance with grant covenants, and the use of the imprest account under \nADB\u2019s SOE procedure, will be submitted not later than 9 months after the financial year.28 \n   \n90.  The EA will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports on project implementation within \n30 days of the end of each quarter. The progress reports will be in English and in a format \nacceptable to ADB and will indicate, among other things, progress made against established \ntargets, problems encountered during the previous quarter, steps taken to resolve problems, \ncompliance with grant covenants, and the proposed program of activities for the succeeding \nquarter. Within 3 months after the physical completion of the Project, the MOH will submit to \nADB a project completion report with details of program implementation and accomplishments.  \n \n8.  Anticorruption Measures \n \n91.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was discussed with the MOH as \nthe EA for the Project. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  The  MOH  has \nhandled four ADB projects through the same administrative unit, which is now familiar with ADB \nprocedures and anticorruption measures. The previous projects helped set clear procedures for \nthe procurement of equipment and civil works, with financial management support from a private \naccounting firm. There have not been any major audit issues or instances of suspected fraud. \nThe EA plans activities in detail, under the supervision of an international consultant, and holds \nweekly meetings to plan and report on activities and generally ensure transparency. To support \nthese efforts, MOH staff not familiar with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy will undergo orientation, \nand ADB review missions will include discussions on corruption. A statement of this policy will \nbe part of the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project will specify the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey  relate  to  the  Project.  Governance-related  risks  will  be  further  minimized  through  the \nimplementation of a Governance Action Plan to be developed jointly by the MOH and the \nprovinces to improve efficiency of program implementation, enhance the quality of outputs, and \nprevent fraud and corruption. \n \n \n                                                 \n28 Due to logistical constraints, submission of audited financial statements and audited project accounts is extended. \n ", "20   \n  9.  Involuntary Resettlement \n \n92.  District  hospitals  and  health  centers  will  be  upgraded  on  existing  land;  hence,  no \nresettlement issues are expected. The 11 new health centers will, as a matter of priority, be built \nonly on vacant and idle land owned by the Government that is free from all encumbrances, \nhabitation, dispute, or controversy. However, since the final site for each subproject has not yet \nbeen  selected,  a  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), to guide the preparation of a resettlement plan, should \nthere be any land acquisition impact (Appendix 10 and Supplementary Appendix D).  \n \n  10.  Environment \n \n93.  The  Project\u2019s  environmental  impacts  were  reviewed  through  rapid  environmental \nassessment;  no  significant  adverse  impacts  were  identified.  The  Project  will  support  the \nconstruction  of  district  hospitals  and  health  centers  based  on  MOH  guidelines  for  the \nconstruction of health facilities developed under the PHCEP. Environmentally sound medical \nwaste treatment will be included in the design of the new as well as upgraded health facilities. \nSite selection, design, construction, replacement work, and facility operation will conform to the \nrelevant regulations and standards of the Government, international good practices, and ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002). No activities resulting from the Project will cause pollution, health \nhazards, or soil erosion. The Project is classified as Category C.  \n \n11.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n94.  A project performance monitoring system will be established at all levels to ensure the \nachievement of the objectives of the Project. Special attention will be given to the monitoring of \nbenefits to the poor, in particular women, children, and ethnic groups, using disaggregated \nindicators. The project performance monitoring system will encompass the following elements: \n(i) impact and outcome assessment using the PHCEP end-of-project household survey as \nbaseline and an end-of-project survey in the fourth project year, (ii) performance assessment of \nvillage health care and health services (outputs) through surveys, (iii) monitoring of activities \nand inputs, (iv) study of specific social and environmental aspects, and (v) monitoring of project \nmanagement and financing. The performance indicators are listed in Appendix 11. \n \n12.  Project Review \n \n95.  The MOH will provide ADB with quarterly and annual reports on the progress of the \nProject and related policy issues (Appendix 4). The reports should review progress milestones \nvis-\u00e0-vis the achievement of project indicators, identify issues, and propose adjustments as \nneeded. Within 3 months after each year following project effectiveness, the MOH will submit to \nADB a project annual report summarizing the issues related to project progress and compliance \nwith covenants.  \n \n96.  The Government and ADB will conduct joint project reviews, including midterm and \ncompletion reviews. The reviews will focus on project impact, achievement of objectives, project \nactivities,  inputs,  administration,  policy  reforms,  and  institutional  and  sustainability  aspects \nincluding aid coordination. The reviews will also examine compliance with social, environmental, \nfinancial,  and  other  covenants  in  the  grant  agreement.  The  MOH  and  the  provincial \ngovernments will see to it that their staff visit the field often and join ADB in all review missions.  \n    \n \n ", "  21 \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n1.  Health Benefits \n97.  Lagging health indicators compared with MDG goals and targets are primarily a result of \nhigh mortality and morbidity among the rural poor, women and children, and ethnic groups\u2014the \nprimary beneficiaries of the Project. Targeting these groups with cost-effective interventions \nthrough  an  already  established  PHC  system  is  expected  to  have  a  major  impact  on  key \nindicators in the medium term, and to assist the Lao PDR in achieving its MDGs.  \n \n98.  The Project incorporates challenges facing ethnic groups in gaining access to health \nservices, and the health sector in delivering good-quality PHC services. The Project focuses on \nthe eight northern provinces with a high ethnic population, and is aimed at (i) widening health \ncenter coverage of ethnic communities by constructing new health centers in underserved \nethnic areas; (ii) training more ethnic PHC health workers through special bridging courses for \nstudents who do not yet meet the education prerequisites for entry into the regular course; \n(iii) forming a new cadre of PHC officers with functions similar to those of medical assistants, to \nbe posted as mid-level staff at health centers; (iv) expanding VHV training and peer education, \nin particular for remote ethnic groups and female VHVs; and (v) making the training course \ncurricula and materials sensitive to cultural and traditional practices and equitable. \n \n99.  On project completion, the PHC network will have improved in performance\u2014there will \nbe much more demand for services, wider coverage of essential services, and a more effective, \nefficient, and equitable health system. Substantial planning and budgeting capacity will have \nbeen built up in the provinces. MOH capacity in HRD, economic and financial analysis, financial \nmanagement, and integrated project administration will have been strengthened. The Project \nwill have supported policies to restructure the health budget, services, and staff.  \n \n2.  Social and Poverty Benefits \n \n100.  Health is a critical asset for all people but especially for the rural poor, who depend \nexclusively on physical labor to meet their daily food requirements and minimal living standards. \nIt is estimated that at any given time one quarter of poor households in the Lao PDR experience \nan acute illness in the family, in addition to chronic illness. Catastrophic illnesses often drive \nfamilies into poverty, but many families cannot afford even routine outpatient care. The Project \nis aimed at making health care more affordable to the poor. The emphasis on extending and \nimproving PHC in the villages will heighten prevention and make illnesses less costly. The \nexpansion of reproductive health services will reduce maternal mortality, with major impact on \nthe well-being of the family and the survival of children. The health and nutrition activities will \nalso  lead  to  better  attendance  in  school  and  more  productive  schoolchildren.  A  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n3.  Economic Benefits \n101.  The project interventions will reduce illness and premature death in the family, thereby \nimproving productivity and income. Economic benefits will also be derived from cost savings \ndue to increased health service coverage. Resource or out-of-pocket savings may flow from \nincreased access to nearby health services (e.g., reduced transport costs) and more timely and \n ", "22   \nrational diagnosis and treatment that reduce treatment cost.29 More efficient health care delivery \nwill lead to other economic benefits. The Project clearly has cost implications for the health \nsystem, such as the expected increase in PHC staff, but the rational use of staff and other \ninputs will lead to a more efficient and qualitatively better health system and better use of past \ninvestments. The economic and financial analysis is in Appendix 13. \n \nB.  Project Risks \n102.  Achieving project objectives is predicated on several assumptions and on the effective \nmitigation of certain risks (see Appendix 3). The two components of reaching vulnerable groups \nwith PHC and developing the health system are closely related and share a number of risks.  \n \n    1.  Commitment to Reforms \n \n103.  Striving for more equity, efficiency, and effectiveness entails difficult political choices \nabout redistributing control, budgets, staff, and services, and depends on the commitment of \nstakeholders to reach vulnerable groups and carry out reforms. Improving PHC delivery and \nreaching vulnerable groups are explicitly stated goals in NSEDP6, and past projects have given \nspecial attention to reaching these groups with reasonable success. The Project proposes \nseveral new strategies and interventions to further improve benefits for these groups. The MOH \nis expected to continue to provide strong stewardship for PHC. Provincial governments will be \nguided in making choices in favor of PHC, MDGs, and health system development that provide \ngreater benefits to the poor and the disadvantaged. Central health programs and external \nagencies  must  be  supported  in  decentralizing,  integrating,  and  harmonizing  programs  and \nprojects in support of PHC. The Project will facilitate this by carrying out participatory planning, \nhelping prepare decrees and guidelines, providing training, monitoring project activities, and \nlinking inputs with results.     \n  \n2.  Financing Constraint \n \n104.  Domestic public funding for the health sector is about 0.8% of gross domestic product.30 \nHowever, the Government plans to increase health sector financing substantially over the next \n5 years. If PHC, which mainly benefits the poor, is to be improved and sustained, the MOH will \nneed to give priority to PHC rather than to large hospitals in using additional funds. Even so, \nwhile the economy shows strong and stable growth and increasing revenues, external funding \nwill be needed to bridge the gap in funding for the recurrent costs of PHC. The Project provides \nfor several strategies to improve health sector financing (subcomponent 1.3) and use of funds \n(subcomponent 2.2). It will also support studies to monitor health sector financing and explore \ninnovative options. After the Project, the MOH is expected to be able to absorb the resulting \nadditional recurrent cost (see Appendix 13, para. 20).  \n \n  3.  Staff Performance Constraints \n \n105.  Project impact requires substantially improved staff performance, particularly among \nprovincial and district managers, staff providing midwifery services, and staff providing services \nin remote locations. The Project provides training opportunities and, on a pilot basis, staff \n                                                 \n29 Bloom and Choynowski (2003) calculated that, in Cambodia, out-of-pocket health expenditure would decrease by \n$6 per person with the availability of improved health services.  \n30 The World Bank (2006). World Development Indicators 2006, World Bank Publications. \n ", "  23 \nincentives  to  improve  staff  performance.  The  Project  will  also  improve  staff  motivation  by \nincreasing the budget for operations, maintenance, supplies, and supervision. \n \n4.  Administrative Risks \n106.  HEF and the results-based approach are relatively new in the MOH and require new \nadministrative  procedures.  The  Project  provides  for  preparation  time,  guidelines,  technical \nexpertise, and accounting services to ensure proper implementation. Experience with health \nsector projects suggests that the appointment of staff and consultants, and the approval of \nbudgets and financial arrangements, may cause start-up delays. Advance action will be taken, \nand  the  Project  will  use  existing  staff  and  established  implementation  and  funds  flow \nmechanisms to minimize these delays. \n \nC.  Sustainability of Project Initiatives \n107.  The Government\u2019s effort is severely limited by its narrow revenue base, and will continue \nto be fiscally constrained for the next 10 years. Poverty is high and there are serious equity \nissues associated with high cost recovery and a weak social safety net. To ensure the financial \nsustainability  of  pro-poor  activities,  fiscal  measures,  improved  sector  allocations,  improved \nallocation efficiency within the sector, and other measures are under way. Efficiency gains will \nalso be realized through the systemic reforms proposed under the Project. The division of health \nfinancing in DPB will be strengthened under the Project and will study options within the sector \nfor improving the quantity and quality of health sector financing. \n \n108.  The Project includes support for several system developments in the sector that require \nsubstantial institutional changes. The MOH anticipates that integrating of PHC services and \nprograms will take up to 2015. The Project supports building blocks for a national program \napproach including building MOH capacity, integrating services and programs, mainstreaming \nproject administration, strengthening planning and budgeting, and improving monitoring and \nevaluating. The MOH plans to develop a national program approach in the second phase.   \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n109.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)   Annual planning and budgeting. As the basis for determining provincial project \nassistance, each of the eight northern provinces will submit an annual plan and \nbudget to the MOH by 30 September 2007 and each year thereafter. Each plan \nand budget will cover all sources and uses of funds for the provincial public \nhealth sector, and clearly show capital and recurrent expenditures. \n \n(ii)  Operation and maintenance. Each of the eight northern provinces will ensure \nthat from September 2008 onward, an annual budget is made available for the \noperations and maintenance of the village health program, the health centers, \nand the district hospitals, based on projections agreed to by ADB and the MOH. \n \n ", "24   \n(iii)   Flow of funds. The Government will ensure that ADB grant funds are transferred \nto the MOH and the provinces and reimbursements done in a timely manner. \n \n(iv)   Counterpart  financing.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  necessary \ncounterpart funds for project implementation are provided in a timely manner.  \n \n(v)    Resettlement. The Government will ensure that district hospitals and health \ncenters are upgraded on existing land and that the construction of new health \ncenters  is  carried  out  only  on  vacant  land  and  idle  land  owned  by  the \nGovernment  that  is  free  from  any  encumbrances,  habitation,  dispute,  or \ncontroversy.  Among  other  things,  the  Government,  through  the  MOH,  shall \nscreen  all  the  activities  of  the  Project  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nimpacts. In the event that any resettlement impacts are detected for an activity, \nthe  Government  will  (i)  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  for  such  activity  in \naccordance with the agreed resettlement framework prepared for the Project and \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and (ii) ensure that (a) only sites \nwith nonsignificant (Category  B, as defined in the resettlement framework) land \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement impacts will be selected; (b) the land \ndoes  not  belong  to  vulnerable  households  and  is  free  of  any  disputes  or \ncontroversies; (c) there are no built houses on the land, to avoid relocation of \npeople; (d) there is no voluntary donation of land or other assets; (e) resettlement  \nplans are prepared on the basis of the detailed technical design, disclosed to \naffected persons, and submitted to ADB for review and approval; and (f) all \ncompensation  and  rehabilitation  assistance  is  paid  before  dispossession  of \nassets. \n \n(vi)  Gender  strategy  and  action  plan.  The  MOH  will  ensure  that  the  gender \nstrategy and action plan for the Project is incorporated in each provincial annual \nplan in accordance with the terms of the action plan, that gender-related activities \nare implemented in a timely manner and have adequate resources allocated for \npreparation and implementation, and that participation of female students in the \nProject is as per gender strategy and action plan (see Appendix 14).  \n \n(vii)  Ethnic groups. The Government will ensure that measures are undertaken to \npromote  the  full  participation  of  ethnic  groups  in  project  activities,  such  as \ndeveloping  mechanisms  to  include  ethnic  groups  in  capacity  building  and \ntraining. It will ensure that project activities are carried out in accordance with the \nspecific actions for ethnic groups as agreed under the Project. \n \n(viii)  Environment.  The  Government,  through  the  MOH,  will  ensure  that  the \nconstruction and operation of all health facilities comply with all applicable laws \nand  regulations  of  Lao  PDR  and  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  policies  and \nregulations, specifically ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). ADB shall be informed \nif  the  construction  of  any  health  facility  requires  the  removal  of  hazardous \nmaterials.  \n \n(ix)  HEF  management. Before HEF  is disbursed to its recipients, the MOH  will \nsubmit guidelines for the use and management of the HEF to ADB for approval.  \nThe guidelines will include, among other things, (a) eligibility of the recipients, (b) \nexpenditures eligible for financing from the HEF, (c) administration mechanism of \nHEF including accounting and funds flow, and (d) reporting mechanism. The \n ", "  25 \nMOH will ensure that activities financed by HEF are implemented according to \nthe agreed guidelines. \n \nB.  Condition for Grant Effectiveness \n110.  The  condition  for  project  grant  effectiveness  is  that  MOH  will  have  confirmed  the \nestablishment of the project coordination unit and the appointment of the project director.  \n   \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n111.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding  the  equivalent  of  $13,000,000  to  the  Government  of  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for the Health System Development Project.  \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n7 June 2007 \n ", "26   Appe ndix 1 \n \nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Health Indicators   \n \n1.  The  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  has  adopted  the  United  Nations \nMillennium Declaration of September 2000 and is committed to achieving the eight millennium \ndevelopment goals (MDGs), four of which address health, nutrition, and population.1 As shown in \nTable A1.1, the child mortality rate was reduced from 170 to 98 per 1,000 live births from 1995 to \n2005 but is unlikely to reach the MDG of 55 per 1,000 (a two-thirds reduction) by 2015 (footnote 1, \nmain text). The maternal mortality ratio reduced from 656 to 405 per 100,000 live births from 1995 \nto 2005, and may reach 250 instead of the goal of 185 per 100,000 live births (a three-fourths \nreduction) by 2015. With Lao PDR being surrounded by countries with higher HIV prevalence, the \nspread of HIV/AIDS is unlikely to halt at current levels (about 1% of service women and 0.1% of \nadults aged 15-45 years) (footnote 8, main text). To sustain or improve these trends, and achieve \nMDGs, higher investments are needed in the country. \n \nTable A1.1: Lao PDR Health Sector Achievements, Projections, and 2015 Targets \n \nAchievements  Projected  MDG \nHealth Indicator   1995  2000  2005    2015  2015 \nMaternal mortality ratio  656  530  405  250  185 \nInfant mortality rate  104  82  70  50  \u2014 \nUnder-5 mortality rate  170  107  98  65  55 \nUnder-5 malnutrition rate            \n(weight for age)  40  40  39  30  20 \nHIV prevalence among service             \n  women (%)  0   0.2  1  4  0 \nContraceptive prevalence  13  32  38  55  \u2014 \nMDG = millennium development goal, \u2014 = not applicable. \nSources: Lao Census 1995, 2005; Lao Reproductive Health Survey 2000; Lao MDG Report.  \n \n2.  Most children still die from common infections such as acute respiratory infections, diarrheal \ndiseases,  malaria,  and  measles.  Only  22%  of  households  in  the  northern  privinces  used \ninsecticide-treated bednet in a 2004 survey (footnote 12, main text). Full immunization coverage of \nchildren aged 12\u201323 months has stagnated at 40\u201350% in the past 5 years, and is among the \nlowest globally.2 Access to safe drinking water edged up from 15% in 1995 to 35% in 2005, with \n53% of households having access to water on the premises (footnote 2). Other data suggest that \n67% of households have access to clean water.3 For 2005, estimates of sanitation coverage range \nfrom 40% to 46% (footnotes 2 and 6). Only 20% of children with diarrhea receive oral rehydration \ntreatment,  increased  fluids,  and  continued  feeding.4  In  summary,  the  coverage  of  basic \ninterventions  has  improved  unevenly.  The  coverage  indicators  of  basic  interventions  are \nparticularly low among many ethnic groups (see figure on page 30).  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Government of the Lao PDR and United Nations. 2004.

Reproductive health indicators also show a mixed picture. The total fertility rate declined \nfrom  4.9  to  4.5  children  per  woman  between  2000  and  2005  (footnote  1,  main  text).  The \ncontraceptive prevalence rate among married women increased from 32% to 38% between 2000 to \n2005. Unmet need for family planning was 40% in 2000 (footnote 9, main text). The maternal \nmortality ratio declined from 655 per 100,000 live births in 1995 to 405 per 100,000 live births in \n2005  (footnote  1,  main  text).  The  2000  Reproductive  Health  Survey  showed  a  very  high \npercentage of pregnancies among adolescents or teenagers (ages 15\u201319): 18.4% of girls or \nwomen in this age group were either mothers or pregnant at the time of the survey. According to \nthe same survey, only 23% of deliveries were attended by trained health personnel (13% by \ndoctors; 10% by nurses, midwives, or other health workers). The percentage of births attended by \ntrained birth attendants was less than 1%. Throughout the country, 86% of deliveries and 90% of \nrelated deaths occurred at home. Many district hospitals do not provide obstetric surgery. Even if \nsuch care is available, the costs of transport and surgery are often prohibitive (footnote 10, main \ntext).  \n \n4.  Malnutrition is the greatest single contributing factor to child mortality in Lao PDR, with 59% \nof all child deaths related to nutritional deficiencies.5 Child nutrition has not improved since 1990 \n(footnote 11, main text).  Poor breast-feeding and weaning practices are widespread. Almost all \nmothers give food supplements (such as chewed glutinous rice) to infants within a few weeks of \nbirth. Harmful practices (such as discarding colostrum) and other food taboos for pregnant women \nreduce  disease  resistance  for  newborns  and  increase  malnutrition.  Micronutrient  deficiencies \nfurther hinder child development. Vitamin A capsules now reach only 29% of children under 5 \nyears. According to the United Nations Children Fund, based on initial data of the 2006 multiple \nindicator cluster survey, anemia is 48.2% for children under 5 years of age and 31.3% among adult \nfemales. In 2000, 75% of households were using iodized salt.  \n \n5.  The prevalence of HIV  had reached 1.0% among service women and 0.1% in the general \nadult population by the end of 2005, from nil in 1990, and may be doubling every 2 years. Of the \nidentified 1,827 HIV-positive cases in 2005, 60% were male, 40% female. More than 77% were \nbetween 20 and 39 years of age. For cases where the mode of transmission was known, 94.8% \nwere due to heterosexual intercourse and 3.9% to mother-to-child transmission (footnote 8, main \ntext). Several determinants, such as poverty, changing social patterns, low population concern, \nmigration, communication, neighboring countries with epidemics, and limited control capacity, favor \nan advancing HIV/AIDS epidemic. For example, the Government reported an HIV infection rate of \nmore than 6% among 1,000 young people returning from seasonal work in Thailand. \n \n6.  The country has had several outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry, including one in 2006. \nTwo human cases have been identified so far. The threat of a new human influenza virus requires \nmajor investment in preparedness. Increasing demand for expensive medical services for non-\ncommunicable diseases and traffic accidents puts further pressure on limited resources.  \n \nB.  National Development Plans and Health Policies \n \n7.  The Government is committed to poverty reduction as its overarching development goal. \nThe  Committee  on  Planning  and  Investment  has  identified  72  \u201cpoor\u201d  districts  throughout  the \ncountry (with 2.1 million people) as priority targets for development. Of these, 47 districts (1.2 \nmillion people) are classified as \u201cpoorest.\u201d In the eight northern provinces, 60.7% of all districts are \npoor and 44.3% poorest.  \n \n                                                 \n5  Bounthom, Dr. Phengdy. September 2005. Country Paper on Maternal and Child Malnutrition in Lao PDR. Vientiane. \n ", "28   Appe ndix 1 \n \n8.  The  6th  national  socio-economic  development  plan  (NSEDP6)  (2006\u20132010)  identifies \nhealth as one of the four priority sectors for development. The health objectives of NSEDP6 are \npresented in the main text (para. 11). The Primary Health Care Policy (2000) of the Ministry of \nHealth (MOH), directly addresses the MDGs, and is supported by policies such as those for \nreproductive health and soon also nutrition.  \n \n9.  To  implement  these  overall  policies  and  plans,  the  MOH  has  developed  the  Health \nDevelopment Plan (2006\u20132010). The cornerstones of the plan are summarized in the main text \n(para.  13).  Expanding  and  improving  the  primary  health  care  (PHC)  network  has  substantial \nfinancial implications for the Government. The NSEDP6 lays out the Government\u2019s overall strategy \nfor increased and more efficient funding of the health sector, including better donor coordination. \nAnother health financing priority under the plan is making health services more affordable to the \npoor by introducing health insurance and health equity funds.  \n \n10.  The  National  Reproductive  Health  Policy  (MOH,  October  2005)  proposes  to  integrate \nreproductive health services and widen the scope of safe motherhood services at all levels. In the \narea  of  adolescent  health,  the  policy  emphasizes  the  need  for  school  health  programs  and \ncampaigns through mass organizations and media to reach out-of-school youth. The National \nStrategic and Action Plan on HIV/AIDS/Sexually Transmitted Infections (2006\u20132010) was approved \nin 2005. It proposes a multisectoral response based on the \u201cthree ones\u201d approach of one oversight, \none  program,  and  one  monitoring  system.  Among  the  key  concerns  identified  is  the  limited \ncoverage of the high-risk population. \n \nC.  Sector Organization  \n \n11.   The MOH is responsible for health, nutrition, population, and rural development, including \nsmall-scale water and sanitation, and also coordinates multisectoral programs such as those for \nHIV/AIDS and avian Influenza control and preparedness. It has seven departments: the cabinet, \nhygiene and prevention, curative, organization and personnel, planning and budgeting, food and \ndrugs, and inspection. The MOH has a National Steering Committee for Health that oversees all \nMOH activities, including its projects and programs.  \n \n12.  Regional hospitals provide a wider range of specialist services and are also centers for \ntraining and technical supervision. Under the provincial committee for health of the provincial \ngovernment,  the  provincial  health  office  plans,  implements,  supervises,  and  monitors  PHC \nprograms in the province. In each province, a PHC coordination office under the provincial health \nofficer has responsibility for PHC activities.  \n \n13.  Under the district health committee, the district health office supervises services in the \ndistrict and the village health program to ensure regular and good-quality service to the population. \nDistrict hospitals have been divided into two levels. Surgeries can be done in type A hospitals but \nnot in type B hospitals.  \n \n14.  Health centers have also been divided into types A (large) and B (small). The functions of \nthe health centers are prevention, health promotion, and the diagnosis and treatment of diseases \nwithin their capacity. Like hospitals, health centers manage drug revolving funds to sustain service. \nUnder the supervision of the district health office, the health center supervises and monitors village \nhealthcare providers, and coordinates between village and district.  \n \n ", "   Appendix 1   29\n \n15.  The village health committee selects and supervises the village health volunteers (VHVs), \nusually 2\u20133 (male and female) per village, who are trained for 3 months.6 The VHVs mainly provide \nbasic curative care and run a drug revolving fund. Village health providers are private providers \nwith some health background. The peer educators are volunteer providers of health and nutrition \neducation and promotion. Trained birth attendants, if they are present, assist with deliveries and \ngive  advice  on  safe  delivery  practices.  Traditional  healers,  according  to  the  health  policy, \ncomplement modern medicine. All are expected to promote the three elements of good hygiene \n(clean water and food, body and clothes, and environment).  \n \n16.  In 2001, there were 309 registered private clinics, mainly urban and mostly run by public \nhealth staff after office hours. There are very few private clinics in the eight northern provinces. \nMost of those that do exist have only basic equipment. Houaphan and Phongsali provinces have \nno recorded private clinics at all. In 2001, there were 2,132 registered private pharmacies in \nLao PDR. There are also many unlicensed drug shops and a host of illicit private drug vendors. \nThe sale of poor-quality and fake drugs, in particular for infections, is a major problem. \n \nD.  Primary Health Care Delivery \n \n17.  Household access to public health services is around 90% in Lao  PDR, if VHVs are \nincluded. In remote areas, where it would be highly inefficient to build fixed health facilities, VHVs \nare the only feasible source of PHC services (see figure). Their presence in the villages has \nparticularly benefited ethnic groups, as shown in the chart below. The provision of drug kits has \ngiven many ethnic villages access to health services within less than 1 hour. However, VHVs need \nmore training, in reproductive health, nutrition promotion, and other areas.  \n \n18.  A  study  on  the  use  of  health  facilities,  done  during  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance for the PHCEP in 2000, found that expanding the health facility network through the \nconstruction of health centers in two provinces from 1995 to 2000 had increased the outpatient \nutilization rate in their administrative areas from 16% to 33% in Xiangkhouang, and from 8% to \n27% in Oudomxai.7 According to the PHCEP Household Survey in 2004, rural households in the \nhighest quintile have an inpatient admission rate of 42.4 per 1,000 persons per year, compared \nwith 15.9 for rural households in the lowest quintile. \n \n19.  The  quality  of  PHC  services  is  particularly  problematic.  Many  health  workers  cannot \ndiagnose and treat common diseases such as malaria, diarrhea, and acute respiratory infections \naccording to the standards required in Lao PDR. At health facilities only about 20% of children with \ndiarrhea receive adequate treatment and counseling (i.e., continued breast-feeding). Some of this \ninsufficiency stems from a lack of qualified teachers with field experience and familiarity with \nmodern teaching methods. Many hospitals also lack skilled staff in such areas of health services as \nlaboratory, pharmacy, blood bank, and some medical services. Also, critical shortages in recurrent \nbudgets for public health facilities hamper effective and efficient operation.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6  Training modules for VHVs and village health providers were developed in cooperation with the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) under the PHCEP. \n7  Noel, Alain. 2000.

Human Resources \n \n20.  The MOH has shifted its human resource development focus from increasing the quantity of \nhealth services to improving their quality. Strengthening human resource planning, management, \nand training in the health sector is a priority in achieving this goal. The NSEDP6 assigns top priority \nto increasing the health staff in the villages and districts, and to improving the attitude, morale, and \ncapacity of health personnel. The MOH does not have a comprehensive, strategic human resource \ndevelopment  policy  or  long-term  plan  specific to  the  health  sector.  The  MOH  Department  of \nOrganization and Personnel is developing a 5-year national Human Resource Plan for the sector, \nbut it lacks experts and facilities in this field. Workforce planning is constrained by difficulties in \ncollecting reliable personnel data. The MOH is also pilot-testing a human resource management \ninformation system and expanding its use. \n \n21.  As of March 2005, there were 11,037 active employees in the public health sector, and 484 \nemployees on study leave. In addition to MOH personnel, 5,452 were employed in the military and \npolice services. There are also about 20,107 volunteers or traditional health-care providers, and a \nsmall workforce in the 254 or so private health clinics. Government health personnel are distributed \nas follows: central, 19%; provincial, 33%; district, 39%; and village or health center, 10%. Staff \ngaps are apparent in health centers and district hospitals, with a third of district hospitals in some \nareas lacking a doctor or staff. There are also significant skill gaps in many provincial hospitals in \nsuch areas as laboratory, pharmacy, blood bank, and some medical services. The mix of staff in \nLao PDR shows a relatively high ratio of doctors to mid-level staff (1 doctor for every 1.7 nurses, \nmidwives, or medical assistants), associated with health system inefficiency.  \n \n22.  The  unavailability  of  female  staff  and  health  workers  from  small  ethnic  groups  was \nmentioned earlier. The PHCEP has introduced bridging training for potential health staff from \nremote areas who do not meet the basic educational requirements. The training of PHC workers \n ", "   Appendix 1   31\n \nhas added some 150 staff at health centers in the eight northern provinces. Revitalizing the training \nfor medical assistants (PHC officers) will make more mid-level staff available at health centers. Low \nsalaries and lack of incentives (financial and nonfinancial) for rural and remote posting hamper the \neffective distribution of staff to health centers and district hospitals. The Government has passed \nlegislation to introduce financial incentives for rural civil servants (Decree No. 381/PM). However, \nwhether such incentives are enough to bring the health staff\u2019s income anywhere near their needs is \nquestionable. \n \n23.  Many MOH staff do not perform at their potential because of lack of appropriate skills or \nmotivation and poor human resource management. Many managers lack the skills and resources \nto properly manage, supervise, and support their staff in performing at a high level. Furthermore, \nfacilities often lack the equipment needed to provide the full range of services that the staff have \nbeen trained for. The quality of training needs to be improved to better prepare health staff to \ndeliver good-quality services. Teacher trainers will have to be trained in modern teaching methods \nand training institutions adequately equipped with teaching materials. Students should be admitted \non the basis of needs and actual training capacity, including capacity for skills training. \n \nF.  Health Sector Management \n \n24.  Prime  Minister  Instruction  No.  01/PM  of  March  2000  established  the  principle  of \ndecentralization and the governance of planning and budgeting (see main text, para. 11). Still, \nresponsibilities and authority at the different levels of health administration are unclear. Provincial \ngovernments are often uncertain about their roles and responsibilities because implementation \nguidelines on decentralization are lacking, e.g., for budgeting procedures. The responsibilities \ndelegated often do not match the human and financial resources available. There is lack of \nanalytical and managerial skills at all levels. Most provincial authorities cannot prepare medium-\nterm (strategic) and annual plans and budgets. The districts also lack capacity for planning and \nbudgeting. Moreover, operating funds are not enough to establish the necessary exchange of \ninformation and provide the required supervision and services. \n \n25.  Decentralized and need-based health planning is further impeded by the fragmentation of \nhealth management and service delivery into vertical programs. Each program has its own targets, \nlogistics,  reporting  system,  and  often  its  own  field  workers  and  remuneration  schemes.  The \naforementioned challenges, along with vested interests in maintaining control over budgets and \nprograms, disincline central health authorities from delegating power to the lower levels of the \nhealth system. As a result, decentralization of authority is incomplete and the lower levels of the \nhealth system are not encouraged or empowered to assume their full responsibilities. The shortage \nof  reliable  data  and  funds  for  supervision  also  constrain  the  management  of  PHC  and \ndecentralization. Without timely and accurate data, health managers are hard put to identify critical \nneeds and trends, and thus to plan and budget appropriately. Supervision is seriously hampered \nby the lack of operating funds. Managers cannot properly supervise and support their staff. The \nreasons  for  program  failures  need  to  be  analyzed  and  addressed  urgently.  Strengthening \nmanagerial capacities at all levels of the program will be one answer. Structural changes will also \nbe required: programs should be integrated, and responsibilities delegated properly to lower levels \nwith the necessary authority, flexibility, and accountability for decision making.8 There must be \nsubstantial consensus building and indeed a change in the work culture in the coming years.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2006. A Review of the Expanded Program on Immunization, Lao PDR. Manila. \n ", "32   Appe ndix 1 \n \nG.  Health Financing \n \n26.  The health sector is seriously underfunded. In 2002\u20132005, government health spending \nmore or less remained at about 1% of gross domestic product, and about 6% of total government \nexpenditure. This is low compared with government health spending in many other low- and \nmiddle-income countries. The NGPES foresees an increase in the budgetary allocation for the \nhealth sector. But the Government\u2019s fiscal situation will remain very tight in the next 5\u201310 years.  \n \n27.  The share of domestically financed government health spending in total health expenditure \nhas varied considerably over the last 12 years. The share was about 18% in 2002\u20132003. Generous \nforeign financing has kept the share of government health spending in total health expenditure \nwithin 42\u201351%, implying a high 49\u201358% in out-of-pocket expenditures (Table A1.2).  \n \nTable A1.2: Total Health Expenditure, by Financing Source, 1992\u20132003  \n(current $ million) \n \nCalendar Year \nFinancing Source  1992\u20131993  1994\u20131995  1997\u20131998  1999  2002\u20132003 \nGovernment (domestically financed)  8.40  16.30  8.31  5.55  7.09 \nCentral Ministry of Health  3.33  6.33  2.31  1.54  1.89 \nProvinces   4.95  9.70  5.20  3.49  5.22 \nForeign-financed  8.61  8.43  22.05  21.69  13.05 \nDonors  5.36  7.70  17.64  18.63  \u2014 \nNongovernment organizations  3.25  0.70  4.40  3.06  \u2014 \nHouseholds  20.68  26.21  42.09  34.30  19.02 \nUser fees at public facilities  \u2014  \u2014  15.07  12.21  \u2014 \nOther private expenditure  \u2014  \u2014  27.02  22.09  \u2014 \nTotal Health Expenditure  38.18  50.68  72.45  61.63  39.17 \nTotal Per Capita ($)  8.54  11.26  14.94  11.81  7.38 \nPublic health spending           \nDomestically financed (%)  22.0  32.2  11.5  9.0  18.1 \nForeign-financed (%)  22.6  16.6  30.4  35.2  33.3 \nHousehold-financed (%)  54.2  51.7  58.1  55.7  48.6 \n\u2014 = no data available. \nSource: Knowles, J. 2006. Public Expenditure in the Lao PDR Health Sector: ADB, RSC-C51839 (LAO): Public \nExpenditure Review. Manila.  \n \n28.  Estimates for 2002/03 indicate that the share of capital spending in total health expenditure \nhad increased sharply since 1999 (i.e., from 20% to 39%), while the share of drugs in total health \nspending  had  decreased  by  about  the  same  amount  (i.e.,  from  55%  to  34%).  The  share  of \npersonnel expenditure had also declined (from 18% to 12%), while that of other supplies had \nincreased  from  7%  to  14%.  Most  of  the  government  spending  is  tied  up  in  salaries,  and \ninfrastructure development (e.g., counterpart funds for projects). A high share of foreign financial \naid may have created substantial inefficiencies through an excessive focus on investment without \nadjusting  for  recurrent  expenditures.  To  improve  aid  effectiveness,  there  must  be  better  aid \ncoordination and reduced transaction costs, particularly given the limited capacity of the MOH.  \n \n29.  Public health-care facilities recover some of their costs through drug revolving funds, which \ninclude income from fees for medicines and supplies consumed. A markup of 25% (usually) on the \npurchase cost covers exemptions for poor patients, administration costs, damage, spoilage, etc. \nUntil recently, the facilities were not allowed to charge fees for services provided, other than drugs \n ", "   Appendix 1   33\n \nand supplies, except for some nominal room charges for inpatients. The level of cost recovery in \nthe country\u2019s public hospitals is relatively high compared with that in other countries in the region. \nThe recent Decree on Fees and Charges (PM 381, December 2005), may significantly change the \nway health facilities charge fees to patients and finance staff salaries, however. All government \nagencies may now charge for all services and products that they provide, and use the revenue thus \ngenerated for salaries and other recurrent costs. But increasing prices risks making public health \ncare even less affordable, especially to the rural poor. Poor and near-poor people are either \nexempted from fees or discharged after pledging to pay the fees later, often in installments. Even \nthese  arrangements,  however,  often  compel  them  to  sell  assets  or  to  take  out  private  or \ncommercial loans.  \n \n30.  There is substantial evidence that the non-poor receive most of the health sector services. \nEfforts must therefore be made to distribute the services more equitably, as provided in the policy \nstatement of the Government. Among other things, there must be a greater emphasis on benefits \nfor rural communities. The Government is making efforts to make health care more affordable, e.g., \nby improving cost recovery, and promoting community-based health insurance and possibly credit \narrangements and equity subsidy for the very poor. There are three formal health insurance \nschemes  in  Lao  PDR:  (i)  civil  servant  health  insurance,  (ii)  social  security  organization,  and \n(iii) community-based health insurance. Social security organization and community-based health \ninsurance are small programs for private sector workers that cover only about 64,000 people \nnationwide\u2014well less than 1% of the population. It will take a long time to cover the informal \nsector, given the current pace, capacity, use of services, and quality of care.9 \n \n31.  The Government is also striving to increase the use of fixed facilities and village-based \nservices  through  health  equity  funds  (HEFs),  among  others.  Three  HEFs  are  now  being \npilot-tested. Each pre-identifies the poorest people in the district and issues health cards to allow \nthem to obtain free services. All three HEFs are relatively small efforts to support the very poor. \nThe MOH has proposed a public assistance\u2013financed system with HEFs for the poor and also a \nhealth loan fund for the near-poor. Such funds will also give hospitals and health centers a more \nsecure basis for forecasting revenue. By removing the uncertainty of bill payments, they will put the \nhealth facilities in a better position for budgeting. \n \n32.  Table A1.3 summarizes health services data for the eight northern provinces. It shows the \ncoverage of health services, the (mal)distribution of staff, the low use of services, and the relatively \nimportant role of cost recovery (including drug revolving funds) in financing recurrent costs. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n9  Ministry of Health, Government of Lao PDR and Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2002.

Introduction. The resettlement framework has been prepared for the Project because the \nfinal  location  of  each  subproject  has  not  been  agreed  yet  and  there  is  no  technical  design \navailable.  The resettlement framework sets out the resettlement policy, screening and planning \nprocedures that the Project will follow when preparing a resettlement plan, if any is required, \nfollowing detailed design.   \n  \n2.  Legal and Policy Framework. The policy framework and entitlements are developed from \nthe relevant laws, decrees and regulations of the Government of Lao PDR and ADB\u2019s Policy on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995)  guided  by  Operations  Manual  on  Involuntary  Resettlement \n(OM/F2, 2006).  Provisions and principles adopted in the resettlement framework will supplement \nthe provisions of relevant decrees currently in force in Lao PDR wherever a gap exists.  Key \nstrategies  to  reconcile  the  differences  will  be  included  in  the  resettlement  plan  that  will  be \nprepared. \n \n3.  Site Selection and Resettlement Plan Preparation.  Site selection and detailed design \nwill, to the extent feasible, explore all viable options to avoid, if not, reduce the requirements for \nland acquisition and resettlement. As a priority, vacant and idle public or communal reserve land \nwill be used. If private land has to be acquired, criteria for acquiring private land to minimize \nresettlement impacts, procedure for the resettlement plan preparation, and project entitlements are \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix D.  Voluntary contributions of land or other assets will not be \npermitted. \n \n4.  Participation and Grievance Redress. Consultation will be undertaken prior to finalization \nof  detailed  design  in  order  that  affected  persons\u2019  requests  and  suggestions  to  minimize \nresettlement  impacts  can  be  incorporated  into  the  design  as  far  as  is  practicable.  Separate \nconsultations with poor and vulnerable groups will be carried out in order to identify and address \nthe specific needs or concerns of these groups. A grievance mechanism will be established to \nensure that affected persons\u2019 concerns and grievances are addressed and resolved in a timely and \nsatisfactory manner. Affected persons will be made fully aware of their rights verbally and in writing \nduring consultation, survey, and time of compensation.  \n \n5.  Implementation Arrangements. At the central level, the project office of the Ministry of \nHealth will provide overall guidance and technical support to the provincial and district resettlement \ncommittees (RCs). The project office and RCs will be assisted by the Supervision Consultants. A \ndomestic resettlement specialist will provide full-time assistance during resettlement preparation \nand implementation. Village Resettlement Committees will be established, as required. \n \n6.  Monitoring, Budget, and Implementation Schedule. The project office will be responsible \nfor internal monitoring of resettlement. Progress reports will be submitted to ADB on a quarterly \nbasis.    The  budget  will  cover  compensation  for  land  acquisition  and  rehabilitation  costs, \nmanagement costs, and contingency.  All resettlement activities will be coordinated with the civil \nworks schedule.  Asian Development Bank (ADB) will not approve award of civil works contract \nuntil  all  resettlement  activities  has  been  satisfactorily  completed  and  agreed  rehabilitation \nassistance is in place and that the site is free of all encumbrances.  Resettlement implementation \ncannot commence until the resettlement plan has been reviewed and approved by ADB.   \n \n7.  Disclosure  of  Resettlement  Planning  and  Monitoring  Documents.  The  draft \nresettlement framework has been uploaded on ADB website.  The project office and RCs will be \nresponsible for the disclosure of the resettlement plan to the APs prior to submission to ADB. ADB \nwill upload the final resettlement plan and resettlement progress reports on ADB\u2019s website. \n ", "  Appendix 11   53\nPERFORMANCE INDICATORS \n \n1.  The Project will monitor inputs, activities, outputs, coverage, and impact indicators, as also \ndescribed in the Design and Monitoring Framework in Appendix 3. In addition, the Project will \nsupport social analysis, with emphasis on poverty, gender, and ethnic group issues. \n \n2.  To monitor project outcome (output, coverage and impact), the Project will use the primary \nhealth care expansion project household survey and health service survey, both scheduled for \nNovember\u2013December  2006,  as  baselines.  With  project  completion  scheduled  in  2011,  the \nhousehold survey will be repeated in November\u2013December 2010, and the health service survey in \nNovember\u2013December 2008 and 2010. The number of indicators will be kept limited, and standard \ndefinition and survey methods will be used to allow comparison of data. The household survey will \nbe  based  on  the  multi-cluster  model  and  the  sample  size  will  be  large  enough  to  provide \ndisaggregated data by gender and ethnic group for each of the eight provinces where the survey \nwill be conducted. The health facility survey will include all hospitals and a sample of health centers \nand village health volunteers. \n \n3.  The Project will use a detailed chart to help prepare, plan, and coordinate project activities, \nand assess physical progress. This chart will also be used for tracking inputs. Detailed monitoring \nof staff and financial inputs using financial management tools will be used to track costs, so as to \nbe able to calculate unit costs, which will be useful for future contracting. \n \n4.  In addition, qualitative studies will be conducted, in particular in the area of health services \nmanagement,  planning  and  budgeting,  financial  management,  the  program-based  approach, \nhealth equity funds, and financial studies.  \n \n5.  The outcome indicators (impact, coverage and output) in the table have been prepared in \ncoordination with the Ministry of Health to measure sector achievement in relation to project \nobjectives  toward  the  overall  achievement  of  relevant  millennium  development  goals.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national priority   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?        No  in country poverty partnership agreement?      No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reducing poverty in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR): \n \nHealth  is  a  key  factor  in  achieving  sustained  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction,  and  gender  equality.  The \nGovernment of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) identifies health as a priority in its 6th national socio-\neconomic development plan (NSEDP6, 2006\u20132010) that feeds into its poverty reduction strategy outlined in the \nNational Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES, 2003). The NGPES\u2019s operational framework comprises \nfour main sectors: agriculture, education, health, and infrastructure. In the health sector, the priorities include \nstrengthening and improving the quality of health care at the grassroots level, particularly in underserved areas and for \nvulnerable groups, including mothers and children, and small ethnic groups. \n \nThe Health System Development Project is aimed at improving the health and nutrition of the population, in particular \nthe poor, women and children, and ethnic groups in the eight northern provinces of Lao PDR. The objectives of the \nProject are twofold: (i) to improve primary health care (PHC) delivery, in particular for vulnerable groups, in the eight \nnorthern provinces; and (ii) nationwide, to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Health (MOH) in health system \ndevelopment, including human resource development (HRD), planning and budgeting, and coordination. It supports \nthe Health Strategy (up to the year 2020) and its objectives of ensuring full health-care service coverage, justice, and \nequity in order to increase the quality of life of all Lao ethnic groups. It contributes directly to poverty reduction with its \nfocus on improving PHC for the poor and other vulnerable groups. Improved health reduces income losses and \nexpenditures due to illness or disease, and indirectly protects the labor force and production of food and cash crops. In \neducation, children in good health and with good nutrition learn faster and miss school less often because of illness. \nThe Project is also aimed at improving access to health care by the poor, the near-poor, women, and vulnerable ethnic \ngroups by introducing health equity funds (HEFs).  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                  Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention-millennium development goals \nThe country has made strong economic gains over the last few years. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was \n$335 in 2000 and increased to $491 in 2005. Annual real GDP growth from 2000 to 2004 increased from 5.8% to \n6.5%. The International Monetary Fund projects continuing solid growth at 6\u20137% per year in 2006\u20132010. Lao PDR\u2019s \ngrowth over the past decade or more has led to a decline in overall poverty, from 46% in 1992 to 32% in 2003.1 \nDevelopment, however, has not been even in geographic distribution and among the various economic sectors. There \nare stark disparities in economic growth between urban and rural areas, and in the income of the \u201cbetter off\u201d and the \npoor. Lao PDR remains one of the world\u2019s least-developed countries, as it ranks 131rd out of 177 countries in the \nUnited Nations Development Programme\u2019s (UNDP\u2019s) Human Development Report for 2005.2  \n \nThe Project will be implemented in the eight northern provinces of Xaignabouri, Phongsali, Bokeo, Louang Namtha, \nOudomxai, Louang Phrabang, Xiang Khouang, and Hoauphan, where there is a large concentration of poor people. \nWithin these provinces, districts will be selected in line with the NGPES development priorities (e.g., 47 poorest \ndistricts). In the eight project provinces, about 61% of all districts are classified as poor, and 44% poorest, in \ncomparison with the national level, where about 51% of all districts qualify as poor and 33% as poorest. About 37% of \nthe total population in the northern provinces is from small ethnic groups (PHCEP 2004 Household Survey). Many of \nthem live in remote, mountainous areas, thus making physical access to any services, including health and education, \ndifficult. Village-based health services need to be expanded into these areas. \n \nThe poor often bear the highest burden of illness and disease. Some are unable to use public health facilities because \nof the introduction of user fees and the absence of social safety nets. The low access to health services for ethnic \ngroups is exacerbated by sociocultural, language, and traditional health practices. A lack of health facilities and trained \nethnic health staff also affects utilization rates. The Project is focused on expanding PHC services through a network \nof village health workers from the specific ethnic community, and on supporting bridging courses for students who do \nnot already meet the general education prerequisites for entry into formal PHC worker training courses (introduced \nunder the primary health care expansion project). The HEFs will be pilot-tested in three provinces (Xaignabouri, \nXiangkhouang, and Oudomxai) to help protect the poor and near-poor from the risk of further impoverishment due to \nincreased health-care spending. The HEFs will give the poor better access to health services, especially access for \npoor women to obstetric services.  \n                                                 \n1  National Statistics Centre of the Lao PDR. 2003.

Yes     No  \n \nA stakeholder analysis as part of the project design to identify the key stakeholders, to understand their related roles \nand interests, and to make a preliminary assessment of capacity for Project implementation. A variety of stakeholders \nwere consulted including the relevant ministries, other national agencies, provincial and district health officials, managers \nand staff of hospitals and health centers, village health volunteers. Discussions were held with development partners \n(e.g., the World Bank) to ensure synergies and complementarities with their ongoing initiatives in the health sector, and \nwith the private sector (Amanresorts International Private Limited) to seek out possible partnerships.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nA participation strategy is incorporated into the overall project design. The Project supports the MOH efforts to \nstrengthen the decentralization of the health sector in the Lao PDR. It will also build MOH\u2019s capacity to coordinate \namong donors as the health sector gradually moves toward a program approach. It supports consultation and \ncoordination activities among departments within MOH, between MOH and other line ministries, between the central \nand administrative levels, and in the districts and villages. The use of participatory approaches is critical for the design \nand introduction of HEFs. Villagers, especially women, will participate in the identification of candidates for PHC officer \ntraining. Health committees at different levels will perform various roles in the management of health facilities and of \nhealth programs, including the expansion of the village health program under the Project. \n \nC.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe Project\u2019s PHC focus is highly beneficial to poor women and children. Support for expanding the reproductive health \npackage including referral services for obstetric emergencies will benefit women directly. Women will also benefit from \nproject support to increase nurse-midwives, so that more births can be attended by a trained health worker. The selection \nof health workers to be trained will focus on filling gaps in female staff. Training content will be sensitive to gender and \nethnicity. It will include an emphasis on reproductive health and family planning. Health facility designs will be reviewed to \nensure that they allocate enough room for delivery and postdelivery care, and that the privacy and other needs of women, \nincluding those from small ethnic groups, are reflected. The HEFs supported by the Project will improve women\u2019s access \nto emergency obstetric services. Health planning needs will be based on sex-disaggregated data and on monitoring \nindicators, and data collection methodologies will be reviewed. A gender strategy and action plan is in Appendix 14.  \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \nD.

Economic Analysis \n1.  This economic analysis provides justification for intervention by the Government of the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), in view of the expected use of scarce public resources. \nTo assess the economic viability and efficiency of the investment under the Project, economic \nbenefits and costs were identified and an economic internal rate of return over 20 years was \nestimated. It is assumed that the Project will have positive impact on the population\u2019s health by \nimproving access to effective and efficient health services, thus reducing the disease burden. The \nuse of quantitative analysis is based on estimates of the likely net present value of the Project\u2019s \nbenefits in relation to its costs.  \n \n  1.  Economic Justification \n \n2.  Spending public resources, whether from the current budget or through loan funding, is \nsupported  most  strongly  where  resources  are  targeted  to  services  with  substantial  positive \nexternalities\u2014(i)  strengthening  the  ability  of  primary  care  to  deliver  basic  health  services, \n(ii) providing an insurance or social safety net for the most uncertain health services, (iii) increasing \nthe appropriate use of primary health care (PHC) services among the poorest groups, and (iv) \npromoting appropriate and effective services. \n \n3.  The strongest rationale for government involvement in the health sector is its potential to \ncontribute to more effective and efficient functioning of the health system and to poverty reduction \nand redistribution of income. Government involvement in the provision of health services, such as \nmalaria control, surveillance and control of communicable diseases, sanitation, mass education, \nand research, is justified because of their \u201cpublic goods\u201d nature. Similarly, many health services \ncan create large spillover effects (such as vaccination for preventive health services), and produce \ngreater social, rather than private, benefit. There is also good reason for the Government to be \ninvolved in addressing market failure in the provision of health services to the poor.  \n \n4.  Although progress has been made in recent years, health status indicators show that the \npopulation remains affected by significant health problems. Urban-rural disparities exist in social \nindicators. Infant mortality and maternal mortality continue to be among the highest in the region. \nNotwithstanding the impact of poverty and of the situation in other sectors, public health issues can \nbe mitigated with adequate financing and improved performance of the health delivery system. \nWeaknesses in the health system will continue to hamper improvements in health indicators unless \nthe low and inefficient use of resources, inadequate incentives for service delivery, low capacity of \nservice providers, and core issues of physical and financial access are addressed. \n \n5.  In such a scenario, investing in health is likely to generate substantial economic returns. \nThe Project has been designed to have a systemic effect, supporting both activities that generate \ndirect health benefits for the target population and activities that will affect the planning, financing, \nand  management  of  health  in  the  Lao  PDR.  The  Project  is  aimed  at  creating  the  practical \nconditions  for  the  actual  implementation  of  an  integrated  PHC  package  in  the  villages  while \ndeveloping critical capacity for efficient management of the health system at all levels. The Project \nwill focus on the needs of the poor and vulnerable, by building institutional capacity in the health \nworkforce at all levels; improving the equity, efficiency, and sustainability of health-care financing; \nand improving the delivery and quality of PHC services. Equitable and efficient allocation of scarce \nresources can play an important role in improving the health status of the poor.  \n ", "58   Appendix 13 \n2.  Economic Benefits \n \n6.  The Project is expected to yield several benefits. These include improvements in the health \nof people in the program provinces and districts through increased health service delivery, more \nefficient resource allocation and mobilization, greater quality of care to reduce the number of \ntreatments and recurrence of illness, and better access for vulnerable groups.  \n \n7.  The Project\u2019s support for PHC will play a key role in decreasing the maternal mortality rate, \ninfant mortality rate, and general morbidity. It relies on the strengths of PHC, which bring essential \nsupport  to  cost-effective  treatment  and  prevention.  Health  staff  will be  trained  in  clinical  and \nnonclinical approaches. The Project is expected to increase the number of persons receiving \ngood-quality health care, and will contribute directly to improving the productivity of the target \nbeneficiaries.  \n8.  The Project will improve the socioeconomic condition of the target beneficiaries, primarily \nthe poor. It will have several positive impacts on the population\u2019s health and welfare, which can be \nquantified in economic terms. Key project benefits are as follows: (i) cost savings due to improved \naccess to efficient and effective health services, and (ii) increased income through reduced sick \nleave or time spent caring for the sick. Cost savings may arise from (a) reduced costs of curative \nservices as a result of improved access to prevention and health promotion services; (b) reduced \nout-of-pocket expenditures, mainly transport cost due to improved access to health services; and \n(c) more efficient and rational diagnosis and treatment that reduce treatment cost. Adults often \nhave to care for sick children, or they may contract infectious disease themselves and suffer \nreduced work productivity and foregone income through premature death. The nature of these \nproductivity  losses  has  received  limited  attention  in  the  literature,  although  demographic  and \nhousehold surveys indicate that considerable time is lost through the transportation and care of \nsick family members.  \n \n3.  Economic Costs \n \n9.  Base investment costs are in constant 2007 dollar prices. Costs are derived from projected \ndisbursements over the implementation period and are adjusted for inflation into 2007 dollar terms. \nThe estimated cost of the Project is based on the period of 20 years, the expected life of the \nProject. Incremental recurrent costs are calculated for the 16 years following the 4-year project \nimplementation period. \n \n4.  Cost-Benefit Analysis \n \n10.  The quantitative cost-benefit analysis for the Project follows the methods outlined by ADB.1 \nKey assumptions are: \n(i)  Discount rate. The economic opportunity cost of capital was assumed to be 12%. \nMost health project analyses tend to use 3% as a discount factor. Therefore, future \nbenefits are likely to be given greater value. To harmonize this analysis with other \nproject appraisal in non-health sectors, a higher discount rate is used. \n \n(ii)  Projection of project benefits and costs. The period of analysis covers 20 years, \nand benefits and costs are calculated in constant 2007 dollar prices. Key benefits \nincorporated  in  the  economic  evaluation  framework  involve  cost  savings  from \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2000.

Manila \n ", "  Appendix 13   59\nreduced out-of-pocket health expenditure and productivity benefits from increased \nlabor supply. \n \n(iii)  Economic cost of labor. The opportunity cost of labor or the shadow wage for both \nurban and rural adults was calculated at $0.5 per day. This estimate is derived from \nbasic statistics on the Lao PDR. \n \n11.  The Project will avoid the loss of nearly $23 million in income from workdays lost to illness \nor spent caring for the sick, and save $57 million in out-of-pocket health expenditure over the \n20-year project period. The analysis assumes that a 10% reduction in the under-5 mortality rate \nwould yield an economic internal rate of return of 17.7%. A net benefit-cost ratio of 1.35 is \ncalculated. Cost savings from reduced medical expenditure is expected to account for 71% of total \neconomic benefits, and labor productivity for 29%.  \n \n  B.  Financial Analysis \n \n1.  Macroeconomic Context \n \n12.  Lao PDR has shown robust and rising gross domestic product (GDP) growth, averaging \nmore than 6% from 2000-2005. The robust growth is largely attributable to the industry sector, \nparticularly the development of gold and copper mining and the Nam Theun 2 Hydroelectric \nProject, which registered double-digit growth in recent years.2 The economy is forecast to grow by   \n6\u20137% in 2006 to 2010,3 with the energy sector as the key engine of economic growth over the \nperiod.  \n \n13.  The  Government  made  progress  in  strengthening  its  revenue  base in  2004.  Revenue \ncollection, excluding grants, is estimated to have increased 12% in 2004. As a percentage of GDP, \ncentral government expenditure declined from 18.4% in 2000 to 16.7% in 2004, but overall fiscal \ndeficit narrowed from 6% to 4.8% during the same period. Efforts were made to address an \nimbalance  in  public  expenditure,  reflected  in  an  increase  in  recurrent  expenditures  (wages, \ntransfers, interest payments) from 7.8% of GDP in 2003 to 8.4% in 2004.  \n14.  The sustainability of the health-care system remains a major concern of the Government. \nLao PDR is unusual among Asian countries with private (household) expenditures accounting for \nthe largest share (49%) of health spending in 2000. The Government contributes about 18% to \ntotal health care, and development partners account for the remaining 33% of the total. The \ncomposition of health spending indicates that the Government does not have enough resources to \nsustain the health sector on its own. The total spending of about $11 per person per year, and \npublic spending of $3 per capita, is well below the target of $34 per person per year on health care \nrecommended by the World Health Organization. \n15.  Although its resources for health are severely limited by its narrow revenue bases, the \nGovernment is making efforts to increase domestic health spending through fiscal management \nreforms. Additional domestic resources of about $5 million per year are projected for the health \nsector  from  2010.  The  positive  economic  prospects,  including  stronger  baseline  growth  and \nimproved cash flow from Nam Theun 2 Hydroelectric Project revenue, are expected to increase the \noverall resources allocated to the health sector.  \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB\u2019s draft macroeconomic assessment for the 2007 Asian Development Outlook. \n3  ADB. 2006. Asian Development Outlook 2006. Hong Kong, China \n ", "60   Appendix 13 \n  2.  Financial Sustainability \n \n16.  The Project comprises investment and institutional development components. It is designed \nto enhance the quality and management of systems and thus improve health service efficiency and \nquality. The Project will help put PHC facilities into operation through support for recurrent costs to \nimprove the operating efficiency of the health facilities. The Project\u2019s support for village health \nvolunteers and health equity funds are considered a core strategy to improve the health of the poor \nand, hence, reduce poverty. This strategy should substantially increase the flow of funds for PHC \nand improve quality. However, recurrent costs are also expected to increase substantially on \nproject completion. While this increase is desirable, given the current low levels of spending, it \nneeds to be sustainable. To evaluate the Project\u2019s sustainability after project completion, the \nanalysis focuses on the fiscal impact of the Project on overall government and health sector \nbudgets.  \n \n17.  About 13% of the Project will rely on counterpart funding from both cash and noncash \nsources. The total financial cost of the Project, inclusive of taxes, duties, and contingencies, is \nestimated at $15.0 million. Of the total project cost, ADB will provide $13.0 million in grant financing \nand the Government will contribute $2.0 million through cash and in-kind contributions. Nearly 75% \nof the Project will go to capital expenses; the remaining 25% will cover recurrent costs.  \n18.  Given the expected project disbursements, projections were made to assess the annual \nrecurrent costs resulting from the Project. The total recurrent costs of the Project are estimated to \nbe about $3.6 million during the implementation period. The incremental recurrent costs associated \nwith  the  Project  are  estimated  at  $0.98  million  per  year  after  project  completion.  The  table \nsummarizes the main recurrent costs of the Project.  \nEstimated Recurrent Costs after Project Completion \n($ \u2019000) \n \nCategory     Cost \nRecurrent costs for primary health care  336.0 \nHealth equity fund for the poor   330.0 \nNew primary health care staff  75.2 \nVillage drug kits and peer education  238.0 \nTotal  979.2 \n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n19.  The overall budgetary allocation for the health sector is expected to increase from $29 \nmillion in 2006 to $50 million in 2010. This increase of $21 million will be more than enough to \ncover the recurrent costs introduced by the Project. If current trends are assumed to continue, the \nhealth sector budget can be expected to grow progressively over the next 5\u201310 years. The Project \nwill have limited impact on central budgetary resources (health), as these represent an average of \nabout 2.2% of the government health budget in the project years. Local spending for health must \nbe  increased  during  project  implementation  to  sustain  and  deepen  the  benefits  and  make  a \nsubstantial impact on key health indicators.  \n20.  The Ministry of Health has confirmed that it has the support for these additional recurrent \ncosts. It intends to reduce rural-urban discrepancies and improve equity. It agrees that overall \nrecurrent expenditures are very low, and need to be increased in accordance with the Ministry of \nHealth  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010  and  the  corresponding  budget,  and  it  is  containing \ninvestment  in  civil  works,  integrating  services,  and  involving  the  private  sector.  The  result  is \nsubstantial savings, including future recurrent cost savings.  \n ", "  Appendix 14   61\nGENDER STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN \n \n \n1.  The Health System Development Project in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR) is aimed at improving the health and nutrition status of the Lao people, in particular the poor, \nwomen and children, and ethnic groups. It will improve health and nutrition behavior and use of \nhealth services by making the provincial health system more effective, efficient, equitable, and \nsustainable in delivering primary health care (PHC). The Project will provide direct investment to \nsupport improvements in PHC in eight northern provinces, which were supported by the Primary \nHealth  Care  Expansion  Project. These  provinces  are  Xaignabouri, Phongsali, Bokeo,  Louang \nNamtha,  Oudomxai,  Louang  Phrabang,  Xiang  Khouang,  and  Houaphan.  In  these  provinces, \ndistricts will be selected according to the development priorities outlined in the National Growth and \nPoverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES) and the 6th national socio-economic development plan \n(NSEDP6)  for  2006\u20132010.  Health  equity  funds  (HEFs)  will  be  pilot-tested  in  Xaignabouri, \nXiangkhouang, and Oudomxai.  \n \n2.  The gender strategy and action plan (GSAP) highlights specific actions in the Project that \nmake it more responsive to the PHC and nutritional needs of women and ethnic groups. The GSAP \nis based on (i) a gender and social analysis; (ii) primary and secondary data collection; and \n(iii) discussions with ethnic people, women, government officials and mass organizations. The \nGSAP follows Lao PDR regulations and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) and Policy on \nGender and Development (2003), and the ADB document, Lao PDR: Gender, Poverty and the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).1 \n \nA.  Gender Considerations in Primary Health Care \n \n3.  According to the 2005 population census, Lao PDR has a total population of 5.6 million is \nspread over 17 provinces, 141 districts, and 10,552 villages, with 75 villages per district and 91 \nhouseholds per village on average. The 2005 census identified 49 ethnic groups, many of which \nlive in isolated villages. A large proportion of these ethnic groups live in poverty, and often lack \naccess  to  basic  services  and  markets.  Levels  of  education  are  generally  low  in  rural  areas, \nparticularly among girls from ethnic groups. The individual health and well-being of both women \nand men is fundamental to creating a foundation for sustainable development. Poor health limits \nearning capacity, productivity, and the ability to seize opportunities. Its impact on women is greater, \nas the next generation is affected. Investment in women\u2019s health has not only individual and family \nbenefits but also generational benefits. \n \n4.  Gender equality and health care are strongly interrelated. For example, women and girls \nmay suffer from nutritional deficiency because of unequal allocation of food within the family. \nSimilarly, women are often victims of gender-based violence. They are also more vulnerable and at \na higher risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection and HIV/AIDS because of their young \nreproductive system and limited power to make decisions and negotiate safer sex. Ethnic women \nand girls are more vulnerable because of traditional gender norms and poverty.  \n \n5.  The MDG target for reducing maternal mortality is 185 per 100,000 live births. Maternal \nmortality has declined since 1995, from 656 per 100,000 live births to an assumed 400 per 100,000 \nin 2005. According to the Lao Reproductive Health Survey 2000, 76% of women who gave birth \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998. Policy on Indigenous Peoples. Manila; ADB. 2003.

Only 23% of deliveries were attended \nby trained health personnel. The survey also found that, nationwide, 86% of deliveries, and 9 out of \n10 maternal deaths, occurred at home. Emergency obstetrical care is lacking in some districts, and \neven when it is available, the often prohibitive costs of transport and operations limit access. \nContraceptives are still not widely used. The Lao Reproductive Health Survey 2000 found that the \ncontraceptive prevalence rate among married women was 31.6%, while the unmet need for family \nplanning was 39.5%. Overall, a more comprehensive approach is needed to improve obstetric care \nfrom the community level to hospitals, with attention to the following key interventions: (i) measures \naddressing  unmet  demand  for  family  planning,  (ii)  early  recognition  and  referral  of \npregnancy-related  complications,  (iii)  delivery  and  puerperium  in  the  communities,  and \n(iv) increased availability and affordability of emergency services.  \n \n6.  In response to women\u2019s particular health risks, constraints on women\u2019s access to health \nservices, and patterns of women\u2019s health-seeking behavior, newly designed health programs are \nable  to  deliver  better-quality  health  services  for  women.  For  instance,  women\u2019s  health-seeking \nbehavior and fertility decisions are often influenced by crosscutting factors such as gender relations, \ncultural and traditional practices, ethnicity, and access.2 In the rural and underserved areas, obstetric \nemergency services are available at only a few hospitals because of a shortage in trained staff and \nequipment in rural hospitals. A majority of women also deliver without the help of a trained birth \nattendant. It was found that Lao women prefer female health care providers, who are in short supply.  \n \n7.  Conventional access barriers to PHC services are greater for women from small ethnic \ngroups because of the language barrier, cultural differences, traditional health beliefs, lack of \nethnic health personnel, and other factors. At the same time, keeping trained health staff in remote \nand rural areas is a challenge, given the low demand for ethnic-specific health services at public \nhealth  facilities,  lack  of  incentive  for  health  workers  to  reside  in  ethnic  villages  because  of \nperceived or real communication gaps, and lack of trained health professionals from ethnic groups \ndue to their comparatively lower educational attainments. Concerted efforts are needed to train and \nkeep health workers from the ethnic groups within their own villages.  \n \nB.  Commitments to Gender Equality and Health Care \n \n8.  Promoting gender equality is an important national goal of the Lao PDR, as reflected in the \n1991  Constitution,  the  NGPES  and  NSEDP6,  and  a  number  of  the  country\u2019s  international \ncommitments. For example, the International Conference on Population Development (1994), the \nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the Beijing \nPlatform of Action (1995) are valuable references in formulating gender-responsive health policies. \nThe Government\u2019s recent policy on reproductive health (November 2005) is also a good guide for \nfuture policies and regulations, as it includes: (i) family planning at the village level, (ii) improved \nmaternal care at all levels, and (iii) training of midwives and surgeons. In addition, the Health \nDevelopment Plan (2006\u20132010) emphasizes the need to increase the number of female health \nworkers and health workers from small ethnic groups. In 2004, the Ministry of Health (MOH) set up \nthe Committee for Women\u2019s Advancement (Sub-CAW) to encourage and oversee the gender \nmainstreaming process and gender equity in the health sector. The Sub-CAW is led by a vice \nminister and has seven members from key ministerial departments. \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2001. A Study of the Health and Education Needs of Ethnic Minorities in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 14   63\nC.  Gender Strategy and Action Plan \n \n9.  Improved Maternal and Child Care. The Project gives particular focus to addressing \nmaternal  and  neonatal  care  through  targeted  local  interventions.  Village  health  volunteers, \nparamedics, and other local health workers will be trained to function as trained birth attendants to \nhelp (i) identify pregnant women; (ii) educate them about pregnancy, nutrition, delivery, and danger \nsigns; (iii) assist with routine deliveries; (iv) refer obstetric complications to referral hospitals; and \n(v) advise on postpartum and newborn care and family planning. Obstetric emergencies may be \nsupported by village health emergency funds for the poor, established with HEFs. Improved access \nto emergency obstetric care will also be provided through an increase in the number of midwives at \nhealth centers and the provision of ambulances and hospital emergency room equipment. In the \nvillages, the Project is also aimed at expanding reproductive health services and the village health \nprogram, and setting up health funds. \n \n10.  Gender and Ethnic Awareness and Skills Development. A gender awareness workshop \nshould  be  organized  to  introduce  the  concept  and  advocacy  of  gender  equality  for  poverty \nreduction and health improvement. The gender workshop should be developed for health officials \nand professionals (e.g., senior management officials, planners, and project managers). At the \ncentral and provincial levels, the training curriculum should include topics related to gender and \ndevelopment, gender analysis, sex-disaggregated statistics, gender empowerment, and skills in \ngender planning and mainstreaming. A more practical workshop should be organized for district \nhealth officials and PHC workers. The workshop should include a session on cultural sensitivities, \nbalance between modern and traditional medicine, and ethnic diversity. \n \n11.  Human Resource Development. Human resource strategies have a dual internal/external \nfunction in relation to gender mainstreaming. Internally, the organization should practice and model \ngender equality on its own internal functioning (e.g., a hiring policy with gender balance, as well as \nethnic sensitivity). A gender and ethnic perspective should be well integrated into the development of \na 5-year human resource plan for the health sector. As a prerequisite, sex-disaggregated data on the \ncurrent  health  workforce  need  to  be  collected  and  the  database  on  health  personnel  must  be \nimproved. Externally, the health sector needs to contribute more effectively to greater gender equality \nin its programs and envisaged impacts (e.g., by making commitment and competence to work for \ngender equality part of job descriptions, terms of reference, and performance criteria, including those \nfor international and national health consultants). Staff recruitment, promotion, budgetary allocations, \nimplementation of state regulations regarding female employees, and the performance of managers in \npromoting gender equality initiatives should be reflected in the human resource plan, which should \ninclude steps for diversifying the ethnic composition of the PHC staff. \n \n12.  Gender-Responsive Planning and Budgeting. Gender-responsive budgeting entails an \nanalysis of any form of public expenditure or method of raising revenue in view of the implications \nfor women and girls, as compared with men and boys. It includes ways in which (i) gender is taken \ninto  account  in  policy  formulation,  implementation,  and  monitoring;  (ii)  priorities  are  given  to \nreducing gender inequality; and (iii) specific targets for gender equality are met. This type of \nbudgeting would therefore require the strengthening of health statistics disaggregated by sex. Most \nhealth institutions in Lao PDR record the gender and ethnicity of their clients, but do not require \ndata disaggregated by sex for reporting to MOH. In most cases, the nature of service often \nprecludes  the  need  to  disaggregate  health  indicators  and  statistics.  Therefore,  to  enable \nmanagers, planners, and policy makers to identify issues and monitor progress, it is recommended \nthat statistics in regular health information systems include sex-disaggregated information. \n \n ", "64   Appendix 14 \n13.  Health-Care Financing. The HEF is a policy decision on health financing. It is suggested \nthat an assessment be conducted to better identify possible constraints on access for women and \nsmall ethnic groups, and seek ways to formulate appropriate procedures during the pilot stage in \nXaignabouri province.  \n \n14.  These  strategic  principles  can  be  translated  into  the  following  specific  actions,  which \ncorrespond to each project component (see table). The Gender Action Plan may be refined during \nimplementation to respond to the specific characteristics of each province and its population. \n \nGender Action Plan \n \nHSDP Component  Proposed Actions \nComponent 1: Improving Primary Health Care (PHC) Delivery in Eight Northern Provinces \n1.1. Improving PHC  \u2022  Work to increase female health staff to 50% in rural health centers and place at least one staff \nmanagement and  representing an ethnic group in the area.  \nquality of care   \u2022  Identify and replicate factors in the PHC workers training approach (2002) that increased female \n  health staff, especially from small ethnic groups. Make improvements as needed. \n\u2022  Subsequently, reserve a proportion of scholarships for the PHC worker training program for \nqualified female staff. \n\u2022  Within the Project, provide the same incentives to male and female health staff. Health staff will \nnot be discriminated against as a result of their sex or ethnicity. \n\u2022  In improving the PHC management guidelines for the provinces, districts, and health centers that \nwere developed under the PHCEP, give attention to ensuring that maternal health programs are \nwell integrated into the overall comprehensive approach. \n\u2022  Make qualified female district health managers eligible to participate in the in-service training of \ndistrict health managers for certificates in PHC management. \n\u2022  Includes separate sessions and on-the-job training in maternal care and barriers to access for \nwomen and ethnic groups (e.g., traditional medicine) in support for the regional school in Louang \nPhrabang (e.g., curriculum, training of teachers, and course implementation). \n\u2022  Consider safety measures in the construction and management of the school and hostel in \nLouang Phrabang. \n\u2022  Make qualified women eligible for stipends offered to those attending the Louang Phrabang \nschool. \n\u2022  Set aside for women at least 40% of the slots in-service training for health center managers and \ndistrict/health center staff. \n\u2022  Incorporate the health needs of women and ethnic groups in training materials and case studies.  \n\u2022  Give equal consideration to qualified female district health officers, especially from ethnic groups, \nfor scholarships, with a target of awarding at least 30% of regional scholarships to qualified \nwomen.  \n1.2.

Volunteers and peer educators should be ethnically representative of the \nvillage. \n\u2022  Include a session on improving client-staff relations and using a client-centered approach in \ntraining for hospital staff in emergency obstetric care. \n\u2022  Allocate enough room in new/upgraded hospitals and health centers for delivery and postdelivery \ncare. The privacy needs of women, especially from small ethnic groups, should be included in the \ndesign. \n\u2022  See to it that women make up at least 30% of provincial and district health committees, and are \nproportionately represented on committee boards. \n\u2022  Highlight the range of services especially for women and ethnic groups with low literacy and \nlimited access to information, in the reproductive health (RH) package. \n\u2022  Disseminate  culturally  appropriate  information  about  the  expansion  of  services,  using \ncommunication strategies that are appropriate for different population groups. \n\u2022  Explore the possibility of providing hardship allowances for specialists in district hospitals and \nfemale staff in health centers, to manage maternal deaths better.  \n ", "  Appendix 14   65\nHSDP Component  Proposed Actions \n\u2022  Equip district hospitals (types A and B) to provide emergency obstetric care. \n1.3 Increasing PHC  \u2022  Give equal benefits from fee exemptions for the same services to men and women. \nfinancing and  \u2022  In pilot-testing the HEF, disaggregate the baseline by sex and ethnicity for the specific services \naffordability for the  covered.
