Technical  Assistance  to  India  for  the  Assam Urban  Infrastructure  Project. \nManila (small-scale project preparatory technical assistance). \n \nCurrently,  only  30%  of the  1.0 million  residents of  Guwahati  city,  the  capital  of  Assam, \n4. \nhave piped water,4 the rest depending on wells5\n and water vendors who charge high rates. The \ncity is divided into four water supply zones. Water supply projects in the north and south-central \n\n10 \n0 \n\n85 \n70 \n\n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank provided small-scale project preparatory technical assistance for the Assam Urban \n\nInfrastructure Project in December 2010. \n\n2  The  investment  program  will  contribute  to  achieving  Millennium  Development  Goal  7,  Target  10,  which  calls  for \n\nhalving, by 2015, the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation. \n\n3  Provisional 2011 census report for Assam, released on 31 March 2011. \n4  The water supply systems of Guwahati are operated and managed by the Guwahati Municipal Corporation, Public \n\nHealth Engineering Department, and oil refineries through their small individual plants. \n\n5  Groundwater sources have high fluoride and arsenic content. \n\n \n\nItem \nNational \ntargets \nNational \naverage \nState target \n(median in \n13 towns) \nGuwahati \n(capital) \nDibrugarh \n\n\fzones are financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). In south Guwahati, \nwater supply in the west zone is financed under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal \nMission  (JNNURM).  The  proposed  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  is  for  the \nsoutheast  zone. 6\n Guwahati  also  needs  a  sewerage  treatment  plant  and  network  to  treat  the \nincremental  wastewater  that  will  be  generated  by  the  water  supply  subprojects.  Rapid \nurbanization combined with increased vehicular traffic, a deteriorating road network, poor traffic \nmanagement,  and  the  lack  of  an  efficient,  reliable,  and  safe  public  transport  system  cause  air \npollution  and  increased  road  accidents,  impeding  Guwahati\u2019s  economic  development.  The \nGuwahati Development Department (GDD) of the Government of Assam is developing plans for \na more sustainable and reliable mass transport system. In Dibrugarh, inadequate SWM and the \nindiscriminate  dumping  of  waste  leave  the  drainage  system  severely  polluted,  choked,  and \nprone to severe local flooding during the rainy season. \n \n5. \nRoad map for achieving service level targets and urban transport. ADB helped the \nGovernment of Assam to formulate a sector assessment to serve as a road map for 2011\u20132021 \ntoward  meeting  national  and  state  targets  for  water  supply,  sewerage,  and  SWM  in  Guwahati \nand Dibrugarh and urban transport in Guwahati.7\n\n The key findings are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe investment for water supply, sewerage, and SWM infrastructure is estimated \nto cost Rs33 billion by 2021 and incur annual operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncosts of Rs1.6 billion upon completion. \nTo  create  a  sustainable  environment  for  investment,  it  is  necessary 8  for  \nGuwahati  and  Dibrugarh  urban  local  bodies  (ULBs)9\n to  (a)  formulate  and  adopt \npolicies on user charges and subsidies, (b) establish separate accounts for each \nurban  service  operation,  and  (c)  install  automated  billing  systems  for  user \ncharges. \nInterventions  should  support  the  2009  master  plan  for  Guwahati,  which  aims  to \n(a)  conserve  the  natural  environment;  (b)  develop  an  integrated,  multimodal \ntransport  system  with  three  mass  transit  lines;  and  (c)  develop  physical  and \nsocial infrastructure for education, health care, and cultural enrichment as well as \nfor water supply and SWM. \nin  construction  management,  systemic \nThe \noperations, and capacity building will require Rs636 million.10\n \n\nimprovements \n\ninvestment \n\nin \n\n \nLong-term  policy  support.  Two  program  loans,  for  subprogram  111 and  subprogram \n6. \n2,12\n were  provided  by  ADB  to  help  the  Government  of  Assam  improve  revenue  administration \nand strengthen expenditure and debt management. The expected benefits are more resources \navailable for social and economic infrastructure and budget resources more efficiently allocated \ntoward  the  outcomes  sought.  The  outcome  of  the  investment  program  is  improved  municipal \n\n                                                \n6  By  2025,  the  east  zone  water  supply  system  will  serve  a  population  of  nearly  445,000  with  water  demand  of  88 \n\nmillion liters per day.  \n\ncities and towns.  \n\n7  Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (Appendix 2). \n8  Many of the items are also recommended under the JNNURM, Ministry of Urban Development. \n9  ULBs of India are the constitutionally provided administrative units that provide basic infrastructure and services in \n\n10 This  pays  for  program  management  consultants,  design  and  construction  supervision  consultants,  community \n\nawareness, and related capacity building for all tranche 1 and tranche 2 subprojects. \n\n11 ADB. 2004.

The  country  partnership \nstrategy 13 and  ADB\u2019s  assistance  program  for  2007\u20132012  support  the  Government  of  India\u2019s \nefforts  to  address  binding  constraints  on  the  plan  through  four  strategic  pillars.14 The  country \npartnership  strategy  stresses  continuing  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  infrastructure  development, \nincluding  urban  infrastructure.  The  country  operations  business  plan  for  India,  2011\u20132013 15\n \nallocates an MFF of up to $200 million for the Assam Urban Infrastructure Investment Program \nfor processing in 2011. \n \n8. \nIndia  and  urban  service  delivery.  India\u2019s  plan  has  set  out  27  national  targets,  both \neconomic  and  social,  including  (i)  clean  drinking  water  available  to  all  by  2009,  ensuring  that \nthere is no slippage by the end of the plan, and (ii) treating all urban wastewater by 2011\u20132012 \nto reduce river pollution. The plan calls for public investment to meet infrastructure requirements \nwhere private participation is less likely. \n \nPolicy  framework  and  ongoing  initiatives.  The  Government  of  India  has  been  the \n9. \nmost prominent financier in Assam through various national schemes. The centrally sponsored \nJNNURM,  the  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Scheme  for  Small  and  Medium  Towns,  and \nother  national  and  state  budgetary  allocations  are  available  but  inadequate  to  meet  the \ncomplete  investment  requirement.  The  government  has  undertaken  several  initiatives  for \neconomic  development  in  the  northeast  with  ADB  assistance.  During  the  2010  country \nprogramming mission, Assam was identified as the recipient of the proposed ADB assistance. \n \n10. \nInvestment program for urban infrastructure in Guwahati and Dibrugarh, including \nexternal  assistance. Major investments in urban infrastructure were identified in the 2006 city \ndevelopment plan, aiming to attract funding from the JNNURM. The plan envisions investments \nin  Guwahati  and  Dibrugarh  of  $860.49  million,  toward  which  financing  secured  from  the \nJNNURM is $143.58 million and JICA $318.00 million, leaving a funding gap of $398.91 million. \nADB  financing  of  $200.00  million  was  requested.  The  Government  of  Assam  is  seeking  an \nadditional  $120.00 million from  JICA for  wastewater treatment  and  networks  in Guwahati. The \nbalance  of  $78.91  million  will  be  financed  by  the  Government  of  Assam.  The  urban  services \ninvestment  program  in  Guwahati  of  $575.36  million,  supported  by  ADB,  JICA,  and  JNNURM, \ncovers  44%  of  the  total  investment  requirement  of  $1.30  billion  for  the  13  largest  cities  in \nAssam.  Similarly,  the  investment  program  for  urban  transport  in  Guwahati  of  $205.12  million \ncovers 20% of the total urban transport investment requirement of $1.00 billion for the 13 largest \ncities. \n \n11. \nThe  MFF  modality  was  selected  to  allow  phased  implementation  and  funding  of \nindividual projects when they are ready, subject to eligibility and readiness of subprojects which \nare  16 included  in  the  investment  program.17 The  requirements  for  an  MFF  are  in  place.  The \nGovernment of Assam has prepared a sector strategy supported by an investment plan over the \nnext ten years.18\n \n\n                                                \n13 ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India,2009-2012. Manila. \n14  The  four  strategic  pillars  are  (i)  support  for  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  (ii)  catalyzing \ninvestment  through  the  use  of  innovative  business  and  financing  solutions,  (iii)  strengthening  results  orientation, \nand (iv) emphasizing knowledge solutions and support for regional cooperation. \n\n15 ADB. 2010.

Policy dialogue with the Government of Assam will develop a strategic \n12. \nand  integrated  approach  to  sustainably  improving  the  urban  environment  and  quality  of  life. \nFirst, meters installed for all consumers in the service areas will support the transition from the \ncurrent  flat  rates  to  volumetric  rates  for  water  supply,  enhancing  cost  recovery,  demand \nmanagement, and water conservation.19 Second, institutional reforms will improve the efficiency \nand  strengthen  the  capacity  of the  Guwahati  Metropolitan Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Board \n(GMWSSB),  which  will  be  an  autonomous  entity  responsible  for  managing  and  operating  all \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  in  Guwahati,  including  the  collection  of  tariffs,  with  effect \nfrom  2015.20 Third,  institutional  reform  and  organizational  development  in  urban  transport  will \nbring  into  being  an  authority  to  plan,  manage,  and  coordinate  all  transportation  in  the  city. \nFurther, policy and institutional reforms under the JNNURM in Guwahati complements the policy \ndialogue under the investment program (footnote 8). Key lessons from past ADB water supply \nprojects21\n have been considered in the design of the investment program, including the need to \nincrease water use efficiency and focus on cost recovery and institutional matters.  Further, the \nGDD  will  prepare  a  detailed  road  map  for  revising  tariffs,  setting  out  milestones  toward \nintroducing  revised  water  tariffs  to  meet  full  O&M  costs,  and  establishing  sewerage  fees  and \nsolid waste management user charges in Guwahati and Dibrugarh by 2018. \n \nB. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  investment  program  will  be  an  improved  access  to  water  supply, \n13. \nsanitation, and urban infrastructure facilities by the urban population in Guwahati and Dibrugarh. \nThe  expected  outcome  will  be  improved  and  sustainable  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  urban \ntransport  system  in  Guwahati  and  Dibrugarh.  The  investment  program  will  help  India  achieve \nthe Millennium Development Goals on environment sustainability and increased access to safe \ndrinking water and basic sanitation. An integrated and holistic approach is being designed under \nwhich  six  outputs  will  be  delivered. The  two tranches  under the  MFF  will  be  implemented  in  6 \nyears from 2012 to 2017.22\n \n \nC. \n \n14. \nOutput  1:  Improved  water  supply  infrastructure  in  Guwahati.  Investments  will \nprovide high-quality, 24-hour-a-day water supply to 350,000 residents in the southeastern zone \nof Guwahati by 2018.23\n This includes constructing a water intake and water diversion structures, \nwater  treatment  facility,  water  transmission  system  and  service  reservoirs,  laying  all-new \ndistribution pipes, and limiting nonrevenue water to less than 15%, which is below the Ministry \nof Urban Development benchmark of 20%. \n \n15. \nOutput  2:  Improved  sewerage  infrastructure  in  Guwahati. Investments will address \n100% of the incremental wastewater generated by the ADB-funded water supply subproject. It \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n19  Completion of 100% consumer metering for ADB, JNNURM, and JICA water supply subprojects would create the \n\nbasis for introducing volumetric tariff rates and progress towards,cost recovery and financial sustainability. \n\n20  A bill was passed and enacted in February 2009 (No. LGL. 102/2008/95) for establishing the GMWSSB. JICA is \n\nproviding $5 million for capacity building in the GMWSSB on O&M, regulatory matters, and monitoring. \n\n21  ADB.  2010.

Manila.  \n\n22  For indication, tranche 1 will include the Guwahati water supply subproject (phase 1) river intake, water treatment \nplant,  service  reservoirs;  preparatory  works  for  the  BRT  subproject;  solid  waste  management;  and  drainage \nimprovement. Tranche 2 will include water distribution networks extending for 230 kilometers, consumer meters, a \nsewerage treatment plant and trunk sewers, 200 kilometers of sewerage network and house-to-house connections, \nthe BRT corridor, and second phase drainage improvement.     \n\n23  By 2025, the population served will be 445,000. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fOutput  6:  Facility  management  and \n\nwill include constructing a sewerage treatment plant, sewer networks, and pumping stations, as \nwell as acquiring maintenance equipment. \n \n16. \nOutput  3:  Improved  solid  waste  management  infrastructure  in  Dibrugarh.  SWM \nservice  coverage  in  Dibrugarh  will  be  increased  to  more  than  80%  with  in-house  waste \ncollection, segregation, recycling and improved solid waste collection, transportation, treatment, \nand disposal. \n \nOutput  4: Improved  drainage  in  Dibrugarh. Flow in the existing Dibrugarh protection \n17. \ndrain  will  be  improved  by  removing  accumulated  silt  and  waste,  drain  enlargement,  and  the \nwidening  and  reconstruction  of  all  the  road  and  flood  relief  culverts,  bridges  and  sluice  gates \nwhich will significantly reduce flooding in the city. \n \nOutput 5: Improved urban transport infrastructure in Guwahati. One BRT corridor of \n18. \n10.5  kilometers  will  be  developed  under  the  MFF.  The  expected  benefit  of  the  BRT  is \nsignificantly  shortened  travel  times  and  improved  public  transport  safety  and  reliability, \nencouraging a progressive modal shift from private cars to public transport, thereby reducing air \npollution and greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n19. \nimplementation  support,  community \nawareness,  and  program  performance  monitoring.

Mitigation  will  be \n26. \ndesigned  into  land  development,  transmission  and  distribution  pipelines,  building  foundations \nand  structures,  road  pavements,  and  other  urban  infrastructure.  Geological  and  geotechnical \nanalysis  during  detailed  design  will  ensure  that  pipelines  and  road  alignments  follow  feasible \nroutes. Energy-efficient technical options to reduce operating costs will be pursued. Most water-\nsupply and wastewater-treatment systems will be gravity fed, to minimize O&M costs. The storm \nwater  drainage  subproject  in  Dibrugarh  will  increase  channel  flow  capacity  and  reduce  flood \nrisk.  Further,  the  procurement  of  new  equipment  and  construction  of  new  sanitary  landfill  will \nimprove  solid  waste  management, making  Dibrugarh  cleaner  and  putting  it  in  compliance  with \nthe  Municipal  Solid  Waste  (Management  &  Handling)  Rules,  2000.  Rigorous  and  detailed \nanalysis  of  technical  options  and  design  optimization  have  avoided  significant  resettlement \nimpacts from the Guwahati water treatment plant and the SWM landfill in Dibrugarh. \n \nB. \n \nThe  economic  analysis  assessed  the  economic  rationale  for  government  intervention,  \n27. \nwhich  is  justified  as  the  investment  program  supports  basic  public  services. 27\n To  achieve \neconomy  and  efficiency  in  implementation,  each  PFR  will  assess  demand,  willingness-to-pay, \nand  least-cost  designs,  as  well  as  ensure  economic  internal  rates  of  return  higher  than  the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital, as specified in the subproject selection criteria of the FFA. \nUnder  project  1,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  16%  for  the  Guwahati  water  supply \nsubproject,  19.7%  for  the  Dibrugarh  drainage  improvement  subproject,  and  14.4%  for  the \nDibrugarh solid waste management subproject. Financial internal rates of return and net present \nvalue  have  been  computed  for  the  revenue-generating  water  supply  and  solid  waste \nmanagement subproject at May 2011 prices. The financial internal rate of return is 4.7% for the \nGuwahati  water  supply  subproject  and  7.4%  for  the  Dibrugarh  solid  waste  management \nsubproject, both above the weighted average cost of capital of 3.21%. \n \nC. \n \nThe  financial  management  capacity  of  the  GDD  and  the  project  implementing  units \n28. \n(PIUs) has been assessed as adequate.28\n The PMU staff will need additional technical staff and \ntraining  on  ADB  procurement  and  disbursement  procedures.  The  following  steps  will  or  have \nbeen undertaken: \n(i) \n\nEach  tranche  under  the MFF  will  be  processed as  a  project  loan.  Project  1  has \nonly  three  investment  subprojects  to  gradually  build  capacity  for  contract \nmanagement and construction supervision. \nADB completed detailed training in May and June 2011 for the staff of the PMU.29\n \n\nGovernance \n\n(ii) \n\n \n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  governments  of  India  and  Assam,  and  the  GDD.

Pro-poor  interventions  in  project  1  include  (i)  a  baseline  survey  to  identify  poor \nand vulnerable households for service delivery, (ii) a community awareness program to educate \nand  inform  the  poor  of  investment  program  benefits,  (iii)  a  behavioral  change  program  to \nimprove personal sanitation and hygiene, and (iv) a community-based primary waste collection \nsystem  in  Dibrugarh.  As  tranche  1  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  a  gender \naction plan and consultation and participation strategy were prepared to ensure widespread and \nmeaningful  participation  with  an  emphasis  on  the  poor  and  women.31\n The  gender  action  plan \nand consultation and participation strategy will be implemented with the assistance of an NGO \nand quarterly monitoring and reporting of progress. \n \nE. \n \n31. \nEnvironmental  safeguards.  Tranche  1  is  classified  category  B  for  environment. \nTranche  2  is  expected  to  be  classified  category  B  (to  be  confirmed  during  implementation). \nThree  initial  environmental  examinations  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009)  and  government  laws.  Environmental  benefits  include  (i)  more  and \nbetter  drinking  water  and reduced  waterborne  disease  in Guwahati, (ii)  reduced  contamination \nof soil and waterways and emissions of harmful gases from improved solid waste management \nin  Dibrugargh,  and  (iii)  reduced  waterborne  disease  and  flooding  from  improved  drainage  in \nDibrugargh. Consultant support will ensure that the PMU and the PIUs have adequate capacity \nto  manage  environmental  impacts.  The  subprojects  are  likely  to  cause  minor-to-moderate \nenvironmental  disruption  during  construction.  The  GDD  will  be \nfor \nimplementing the mitigating measures specified in the initial environmental examinations, which, \nalong  with  environmental  management  plans,  will  be  updated  during  detailed  design  and \nincorporated  into  bidding  and  contract  documents.  Environmental  reporting  to  ADB  will  be \nsemiannual.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was  prepared  to  guide  the \npreparation of subprojects in tranche 2.32\n \n \n32. \nSocial  safeguards. Tranche 1 is classified category B for involuntary resettlement and \ncategory  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  Tranche  2  is  potentially  category  A  for  involuntary \nresettlement  and  indicatively  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples  (to  be  confirmed  during \nimplementation).  For  tranche  1  subprojects,  three  draft  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  in \nconsultation  with  affected  people,  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement, \nand  disclosed.  Tranche  1  requires  minor  land  acquisition  with  no  significant  resettlement \nimpacts anticipated. The resettlement plans will be implemented by the PIUs and monitored by \nthe PMU. Adequate international and national consultancy inputs will be provided by the design \nand supervision consultant, project management consultant, and NGO and through the loan and \nTA  to  support  the  resettlement  plan,  implementation,  and  monitoring.  Capacity  will  be  built  for \nmanaging  the  resettlement  impacts  and  social  risks  of  the  investment  program,  including \npotential impacts arising from the BRT component in tranche 2. As these subprojects are urban, \nno impact on indigenous people is expected. A resettlement framework and indigenous peoples \nplanning framework were prepared to guide the preparation of subprojects in tranche 2.33\n \n\nfully  responsible \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \n30 The  Financial  Management  Assessment  for  the  GDD,  implementing  agency,  and  PIUs  are  in  the  Facility \n\nAdministration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n31 Gender  Action  Plan,  and  Consultation  and  Participation  Strategy  (accessible  from  the  list  of linked  documents in \n\n32 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Resettlement  Framework,  and  Indigenous  Peoples  Planning  Framework  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\nAppendix 2). \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n \n33.
