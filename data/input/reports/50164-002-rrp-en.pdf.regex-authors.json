BACKGROUND \n1.  On 18 November 2016, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved loan facilities of up \nto $250,000,000 in United States (US) dollars or its equivalent in yuan comprising (i) an A loan of \nup to $150,000,000 equivalent in US dollars or yuan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources; and \n(ii) a complementary loan of up to $100,000,000 equivalent in US dollars or yuan to China Water \nEnvironment  Group Investment  Limited  and  Xinkai  Water  Environment  Investment  Limited, \ntogether China Water Environment Group Limited (CWE), for the financing of the Integrated \nWastewater Management Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).1 \n \n2.  The  project  is  designed  to  support  the  implementation  of  integrated  wastewater \nmanagement concessions, targeting environmental services for lakes and rivers. ADB\u2019s loan \nwould support CWE in designing, constructing, and operating a series of facilities spanning \nseveral  components,  such  as  (i)  wastewater treatment  plants; (ii)  sludge  treatment  plants; \n(iii) sewage conveyance and interception pipelines; (iv) dredging of rivers and lakes; (v) other civil \nworks such as riverbank reinforcements, odor treatment plants, and landscaping; and (vi) the \ndevelopment of watersheds and wetlands. \n \n3.  CWE selects subprojects located in urban sections of key rivers and lakes in the central \nand western provinces of the PRC that are designated the government\u2019s priority areas for \nenvironmental protection. For each subproject, CWE develops and operates the component \nfacilities as public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs), governed under concession agreements signed \nwith  city  or  county  governments. It  is  envisaged  that,  by  2024,  river  or  lake rehabilitation \nsubprojects will be developed with wastewater treatment capacity of 2.3 million tons per day, \nsludge treatment capacity of 2,900 tons per day, and 190 kilometers of sewage pipeline networks, \namong other infrastructure. The facilities will comply with ADB\u2019s safeguards and technical and \nfinancial eligibility criteria.2 \n \n4.  Project  implementation  is  satisfactory,  and  the  project  remains  technically  feasible, \neconomically viable, and financially sound. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nII.  ADDITIONAL FINANCING \nA.  Rationale \n \n5.  The proposed increase in the B loan by up to $250 million will address CWE\u2019s request to \nbroaden its access to international commercial financing and expand the impact of ADB\u2019s \ncofinancing program by tapping into increased demand from commercial banks to participate in \nenvironmental PPPs in the PRC. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s B loan product has been increasingly effective in catalyzing commercial cofinancing \nfor infrastructure development in the PRC. During 2012\u20132018, ADB successfully syndicated 15 B-\n \n \n1  The complementary loan is an Asian Development Bank (ADB) syndicated loan product that can be offered in various \ncurrencies (including local currencies) funded by commercial banks, where ADB is the lender of record. B loans are \ncomplementary loans which are cross-border and in US dollars. For this project, while ADB approved loan facilities \nin US dollars or its equivalent in yuan, the A loan was fully disbursed in US dollars. Therefore, the complementary \nloan will be disbursed in US dollars and in this paper, be referred to as the B loan. \n2  Eligibility criteria shall include a concession agreement with service exclusivity; the satisfaction of an environmental \nand  social  management  system  (ESMS),  which  is  compliant  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements;  location; \ncompliance with PRC environmental standards; and exclusion of category A projects, among others. ", "2 \nloan and complementary loan transactions, mobilizing more than $1.5 billion in financing from \nmore than 60 different investors. \n \n7.  The proposed increase in the B loan to CWE is beneficial to both the company and the \ncommercial banks, which will all be linked under the ADB B loan umbrella by aggregating multiple \nsubprojects into a single loan facility. Thus, the B loan structure helps surmount the barrier of \ntransaction costs, since each subproject by itself would be too small for international banks to \nconsider financing. It will also allow banks participating in the project to gain from benefits accruing \nfrom participating in ADB\u2019s B loan structure. Finally, B loans benefit ADB by aligning the interests \namong  lenders,  avoiding  potential  conflicts  that might  arise  between parallel  facilities,  and \nimproving credit monitoring and administration. \n \n8.  The  proposed  increase  in  the  B  loan  is  consistent  with  the  project\u2019s  development \nobjectives: to mitigate water pollution in rivers and lakes of the PRC and to encourage private \ninvestment in less-developed areas of the PRC. This is in line with the government\u2019s priority of \nencouraging  new  forms  of  PPP  models  to  promote  water  pollution  control  and  waterbody \nrehabilitation. The proposed increase in the B loan amount is also fully consistent with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030, which targets a substantial increase in long-term cofinancing by 2030, with every \n$1.00 in financing for ADB\u2019s private sector operations matched by $2.50 of long-term cofinancing.3 \nThe increased B loan will catalyze wider commercial finance to support integrated wastewater \nmanagement concessions targeting environmental services for lakes and rivers, where bank \nlending, especially from international commercial banks, is limited; and build confidence in future \nprivate sector participation in this emerging area. \n \nB.  Impact, Outcome, and Output \n \n9.  The impact and outcome of the project remain unchanged while the outputs of the project \nhave been increased to include two additional targets on gender. The project is aligned with the \nfollowing impact: pollution of rivers and lakes in the PRC is mitigated. The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: provision of wastewater management services under integrated concessions \nin selected central and western provinces of the PRC is expanded.4 The key project output is the \nconstruction of wastewater treatment plants and associated civil works for the improvement of \nriver and lake water quality, with river or lake rehabilitation subprojects being developed with \nwastewater treatment capacity of 2.3 million cubic meters per day, sludge treatment capacity of \n2,070 cubic meters per day, and 190 kilometers of sewage pipeline networks, among other \ninfrastructure. \n \n10.  While the project was approved under a \u201cNo Gender Elements\u201d categorization, as part of \nthe B-loan increase, CWE has committed to implementing the following gender initiatives: (i) \nimplementation of internship programs for female students to support them to move into technical \nroles, and (ii) design and implementation of a non-discrimination policy to support equal treatment \nof women and disabled employees in the workplace. CWE will report on the implementation of \nthe gender outputs that it has committed to, under the annual project monitoring and development \neffectiveness monitoring reporting mechanism. \n \n \n \n3  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \n \nManila. \n4  The revised design and monitoring framework is in the Appendix. ", "3 \nC.  Revised Financing Plan \n \n11.  ADB funded the A loan from its ordinary capital resources, whereas the B loan will be \nfunded by commercial banks. The proposed change will increase the amount of the B loan by up \nto $250 million, taking the total amount of the B loan up to $350 million, to support the company\u2019s \nrobust investment pipeline and accommodate the increased capacity of participating banks. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nD.  Due Diligence \n \n12.  The safeguard categorization for the proposed increase in the B loan remains unchanged \nfrom the original classification: category B for environment and involuntary resettlement and \ncategory C for indigenous peoples. CWE established an ESMS consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement requirements before the first disbursement of ADB\u2019s A loan. The ESMS was \ndesigned based on the due diligence findings and corrective actions identified in an environmental \nand social compliance audit conducted during the project processing stage. In line with CWE\u2019s \nESMS requirements, ADB reviewed and approved the safeguard documents for the two ADB-\nfunded subprojects under the A loan before disbursement and disclosed them on the ADB \nwebsite. The two subprojects were visited by the ADB team safeguard specialists during the \nannual review mission in 2019. While the on-site team did not identify any significant risks and \nimpacts, and confirmed the original categorization, it found information gaps between one of the \nsubproject\u2019s environmental and social audit reports and its implementation (e.g., wetland design \nand its operational management, and renting of land as opposed to purchase at some subproject \ncomponents). Hence, the audit report did not fully assess the environmental and social impacts \nand risks related to the subproject as required under the ESMS. CWE\u2019s annual monitoring report \nof ADB-funded subprojects will address these gaps identified during the review mission. ADB will \ncontinue its review and approval role in the environmental and social due diligence process for \nadditional subprojects under the B loan to ensure that CWE and its consultant thoroughly identify \nand manage all the environmental and social issues. This support by ADB will continue to \nstrengthen  CWE\u2019s  capacity  and  resources  to  identify  and  manage  subproject-related \nenvironmental and social risks and impacts. As required in its ESMS, CWE will continue to comply \nwith national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001), will take \nmeasures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards.5 Information \ndisclosure and consultation with affected people will continue to be conducted by CWE in \naccordance with ADB requirements. \n13.  CWE  has  been  and  will  be  subject  to  an  annual  integrity  due  diligence  review  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Integrity Due Diligence Guidelines for Nonsovereign Operations.6 No \nsignificant or potentially significant integrity risks were identified, as there are no unresolved or \nsubstantiated adverse media or other related information. Having reviewed the investment, ADB \ndoes not believe that it is being used for money laundering, or terrorism financing. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.
