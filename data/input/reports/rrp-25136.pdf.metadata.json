The  good  economic  performance  is  attributed  in  part  to  the\nsuccessful  program  of  economic  and  financial  reform  and  good\ngovernance that is boosting private sector activities.\n\nThe  power  supply  is  becoming  a  constraint  to  the  country's\neconomic  and  social  development.  The  Project  involves  support  to\nthe Government to deal with the constraint through policy changes,\ninstitutional  capacity  building, \nin  power  supply\naugmentation,  and  expansion  of  distribution  networks  as  well  as\nenvironmental  improvement  and  social  services  for  the  affected\ncommunities.\n\ninvestments \n\nThe  events  of  11  September  2001  are  expected  to  slow  down  the\neconomic growth and electricity consumption in Samoa in the short\nterm.  Thus,  it  becomes  more  important  to  substitute  indigenous,\nrenewable,  and  cheaper  sources  of  energy  for  imported  oil\ndistillates. The substitution is also required to prepare the economy\nfor higher growth.\n\nCategory  A.  A  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)\nwas circulated to the Board on 19 July 2001.\n\nThe  basic  rationale  of  the  Project  lies  in  the  need  to  improve  the\ncapacity  of  the  Electric  Power  Corporation  (EPC)  and  increasingly\ncommercialize  its  operation  to  meet  the  growing  power  demand  in\nSamoa  with  the  use  of  renewable  resources  and  in  a  least-cost\nreduce\nmanner.  The  Government's  energy  policy  aims \ndependence  on  imported  fuel  by  developing  indigenous  renewable\nenergy sources, and meeting the demand for electricity with a high\nlevel  of  reliability.  The  proposed  Project  is  consistent  with  this\npolicy,  as  it  will  develop  hydro  energy  resources  in  place  of  new\ndiesel-generated  energy  capacity.  EPC's  corporate  plan  stresses\nthe  aim  of  more  accountability,  transparency,  cost-effectiveness,\nand  efficiency.  Technical  assistance  (TA)  will  be  provided  to\nstrengthen  EPC's  capability  to  reduce  energy  losses  and  operate\nefficiently.\n\nto \n\nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  assist  the  Government  and\nEPC  to  undertake  necessary  policy  changes,  increase  efficiency\nand viability throughout the power sector, and undertake the highest\npriority  investment  to  augment  the  Afulilo  hydropower  scheme,  in\n\nClassification\n\nThematic: Economic growth\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nRationale\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n\fiiii\n\nsupport of the country's energy sector development plan. In addition\nto the loan and the associated TA, power sector improvements will\nbe  fostered  by  continuing  the  long-term  policy  dialogue  and\nimplementing  the  specific  Government  assurances  in  conjunction\nwith the loan.\n\nThe investment part of the Project includes the following:\n\nincreasing  Afulilo  reservoir  volume  by  50  percent  to\n15 million cubic meters;\n\nthird  2-megawatt \n\ninstalling  a \n(MW)  generator\nidentical  to  the  two  existing  2-MW  generators  in\nTa'elefaga power station;\n\n(iii) \n\nconstructing a 7.1-kilometer gravity diversion canal;\n\nupgrading the south coast transmission loop from 22\nkilovolts (kV) to 33 kV;\n\nexpanding the transformer capacity of the north coast\ntransmission  loop  from  6  megavolt-amperes  (MVA)\nto 12 MVA;\n\nupgrading \nhydropower scheme;\n\nthe \n\ntelemetry  system  of \n\nthe  Afulilo\n\nimplementing  several  environmental  management\nmeasures; and\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\nproviding consulting services.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $7.5  million  equivalent,  including\n$6.0 million in foreign exchange cost.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nLoan Amount and\nTerms\n\nSource of\nFinancing\nADB Loan\nEPC/Govt\n    Total\nADB = Asian Development Bank, EPC = Electric Power Corporation.\n\nForeign\nExchange\n6.0\n0.0\n6.0\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n0.0\n1.5\n1.5\n\nTotal\n6.0\n1.5\n7.5\n\nPercent\n80\n20\n      100\n\n($ million)\n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  in  various\ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR  4.695  million  ($6  million  equivalent)\nfrom  its  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  repayment\nperiod  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  a\ncharge  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5\npercent per annum thereafter.\n\n\fiiiiii\n\nAllocation and\nRelending Terms\n\nThe  Borrower  will  relend  to  EPC  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan,\ndenominated  in  Samoan  tala,  at  a  minimum  interest  rate  of  5.0\npercent per year and with a repayment period of 25 years, including\na grace period of 5 years. The foreign exchange risk will be borne\nby the Government.\n\nPeriod of Utilization\n\nUntil 30 June 2004\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nThe Executing Agency for the Project will be EPC.\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nProcurement\n\nConsulting Services\n\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\nProject Benefits and\nBeneficiaries\n\nInternational consultants will assist EPC to implement the Project. A\nturnkey contract will be used to select a contractor to complete the\ncivil, electrical, and mechanical works.\n\nProcurement  of  all  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  under  the\nproposed  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.  The  bid  package  will  be  structured  to\nmake it suitable for a turnkey contract to include all civil, electrical,\nand mechanical works through international competitive bidding.\n\nA  total  of  about  10  person-months  of  international  consulting\nservices  will  be  required  during  Project \nfor\nprocurement,  preparation  of  construction  drawings,  management\nand general supervision of works, and training for EPC staff.\n\nimplementation \n\n31 December 2003\n\nThe  Project  was  evaluated  for  the  investment  elements  relating  to\nthe Afulilo power augmentation and transmission line upgrade  and\nwas  compared  with  the  cost  EPC  would  incur  by  installing  and\noperating a diesel power plant (the least expensive alternative). The\nanalysis  indicates  that  the  Project  is  less  expensive  than  diesel\npower generation, with a switching rate of 18.0 percent.\n\nThe  financial  viability  of  the  Project  was  assessed  on  the  basis  of\nthe financial internal rate of return (FIRR). The FIRR for the Project\nis  estimated  to  be  18.0  percent.  The  economic    internal  rate  of\nreturn (EIRR) is estimated at 22.0 percent. Thus, the Project is both\neconomically and financially viable.\n\nResidential,  industrial,  commercial,  and  agricultural  consumers  in\nSamoa  will  directly  benefit  from  the  more  economical  electricity\ngenerated by the Project. The Project will also result in reduced load\nshedding  and  fewer  power  supply  interruptions.  Other  benefits\ninclude  i)  employment  opportunities  for  unskilled  and  semi-skilled\nlabor during Project construction; ii) making electricity more reliable\nand,  through  a  lifeline  rate,  affordable  to  the  poor;  (iii)  providing  a\nmore convenient water supply to the affected villagers (a new water\nsupply  system  will  be  built  as  one  of \nthe  environmental\nmanagement  measures  under  the  Project);  and  (iv)  reducing  air\n\n\fTechnical Assistance\n\niviv\n\npollutants and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nA  TA  grant  ($150,000)  to  the  Government  is  envisaged  for\nstrengthening  EPC's  technical  management  capacity  so  as  to\nimprove its technical performance on asset utilization efficiency. The\nobjectives are to achieve energy loss reduction and enhance EPC's\nmaintenance  management  capacity  (including  outsourcing  to  the\nprivate sector). The TA funding will come from the ADB-financed TA\nProgram.\n\n\fvv\n\n\fI.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\nloan to the Independent State of Samoa for the Power Sector Improvement Project.1 The report\nalso  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  for  Strengthening  Energy  Loss  Reduction  and\nMaintenance  Management  Capacity  of  the  Electric  Power  Corporation  (EPC),  and  if  the\nproposed  loan  is  approved  by  the  Board,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the\nBoard, shall approve the technical assistance.\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nEnergy development is an important element of the Government strategy for economic\ngrowth  and  social  development  in  Samoa.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided\nassistance  for  energy  sector  development,  the  power  subsector  in  particular,  since  1971.\nStarting with the first technical  assistance (TA) in 1971, ADB has provided 12 TAs and seven\nloans for power sector development (para. 27). EPC was corporatized in 1972 in the course of\nADB's  first  power  development  loan  to  Samoa.  Institutional  strengthening  and  policy  reforms,\ntariff and revenue studies, commercialization and  improvement of the financial management of\nthe  EPC  have  been  important  areas  of  ADB  involvement,  with  the  long-term  objective  of\npreparing the utility for eventual privatization.\n\n3.\nADB approved a loan for the Afulilo Hydroelectric Power Project in December 1986 for\nthe  amount  of  $5.4  million.2  The  project  was  cofinanced  by  the  World  Bank,  European  Union\n(EU),  European \nInternational\nDevelopment  (AusAID).  In  April  1993,  ADB  approved  supplementary  financing3  to  meet  the\nestimated cost overrun of SDR 1.457 million ($2.0 million equivalent at the time).4 The project\nwas  successfully  commissioned  in  June  1993.  Its  major  objectives  were  met  and,  despite  the\ncost and time overruns in implementation, it was economically and financially viable.5\n\nInvestment  Bank  (EIB),  and \n\nthe  Australian  Agency \n\nfor \n\n4.\nIn  December  1994,  ADB  approved  a  TA  for  preparing  a  project  for  institutional\nstrengthening of EPC and increased electricity supply by augmenting Afulilo power. The South\nPacific  Regional  Environment  Programme  (SPREP)  prepared  a  preliminary  environmental\nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  report,  but  the  project  could  not  proceed  due  to  poor  EPC  financial\nconditions that could not guarantee project sustainability. ADB financed another small-scale TA6\nto update the project costs and the EIA in June 1999 when the policy dialogue was considered\nback on track.\n\n5.\nThe  proposed  Project  is  designed  to  support  the  Government  and  EPC  in  undertaking\nfurther policy reforms and capacity building to ensure that EPC continues to evolve toward full\nprivate sector orientation, and in undertaking the highest priority investment of augmenting the\nAfulilo power supply. The investment element of the Project is an integral part of the least-cost\ndevelopment plan for the power sector, and receives highest priority from the Government. The\n\n                                          \n1  The Project first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in August 2001.\n2  Loan  0813-SAM(SF):  Afulilo Hydroelectric Project (Western Samoa), for  $5.4  million,  approved  on  4  December\n\n1986.\n\n3  Loan 1228-SAM(SF): Afulilo Hydroelectric Project, for $2.0 million, approved on 22 April 1993.\n4    The  Project  cost  had  increased  from  the  July  1990  estimates  mainly  because  of  foreign  exchange  fluctuations,\n\ndamage caused by Cyclone Val, and the extended period of engineering consulting services.\n\n5  PCR: SAM 17085: Afulilo Hydroelectric Project, December 1994.\n6  TA 3203-SAM: Institutional Strengthening of EPC, for $150,000, approved on 9 June 1999.\n\n\fProject was appraised in August 2001.7 The project framework is in Appendix 1. If approved, the\nproposed  loan  will  be  ADB's  8th  power  sector  loan  to  Samoa  and  the  29th  ADB  loan  to  the\ncountry.\n\n22\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nOverview\n\n6.\nThe  energy  sector  in  Samoa  had  traditionally  been  dominated  by  consumption  of\nindigenous biomass\u2013wood fuel and coconut residues\u2013for domestic cooking and crop drying. In\nthe 1990s, Samoa underwent a rapid transformation toward use of a commercial energy supply\nbased  on  imported  petroleum  and  hydro-generated  electricity.  The  transformation  was  driven\nprimarily by increasing demand for fossil fuel energy in transportation, including ground and sea\ntransportation, particularly fish transport. No hydrocarbon deposits have been found in Samoa.\nAlthough  a  small  geothermal  resource  has  been  located,  it  is  too  remote  from  population\ncenters  to  be  utilized.  The  more  expensive  solar  energy  is  limited  to  water  heating  and  some\nphotovoltaic systems  on the smaller islands. Wind and wave energy are not a viable option due\nto potential storm damage.\n\n7.\nIn 1989, biomass accounted for nearly 60 percent of primary energy supply, defined as\nthe gross energy available prior to any conversions. Diesel fuel and petrol accounted for 16 and\n10  percent,  respectively,  and  hydroelectricity,  5  percent.  By  1998,  diesel  fuel  and  petrol\naccounted  for  22  and  17  percent  of  the  primary  energy  supply  respectively;  hydroelectricity\nincreased  to  7  percent,  while  biomass  declined  to  less  than  50  percent.  A  rapid  increase  in\ndemand for transportation, especially in 1997 and 1998, combined with increased requirements\nfor  diesel  power  generation  substantially  raised  the  level  of  petroleum  imports.  It  is  expected\nthat  the  demand  for  diesel,  petrol,  and  electricity  in  the  next  10  years  will  further  increase\nrelative  to  biomass.  Transport-related  fuels  will  account  for  50  percent  of  the  primary  energy\nsupply  by  2008,  compared  with  34  percent  in  1989.8  As  demand  for  petroleum  products\ncontinues to increase, the weight of petroleum external accounts is likely to rise in the medium\nand long term, making the country vulnerable to the rapid price increases of petroleum products.\n\n8.\nThe  trends  of  the  primary  energy  supply  are  driven  by  the  final  energy  consumption\npattern. Commercial energy consumption has grown substantially over the last 10 years while\nthe  traditional  or  noncash  energy  consumption  has  declined.  Transport  recorded  the  biggest\nshare, increasing its final energy consumption from 28 percent in 1989 to 36 percent in 1998. In\nthe same period, the share of electricity increased from about 9 percent to 13 percent of total\nenergy consumption. Diesel was the primary fuel for generating electricity in that period.\n\n                                          \n7  The  Appraisal  Mission  comprised  L.  Bodda,  Project  Economist,  as  Mission  Leader;  and  M.  Cheng,  Financial\n\nAnalyst/Institutional Expert, Staff Consultant.\n\n8 These data are extracted from the report Samoa Energy Sector Overview and Policy Recommendations, February\n1999,  prepared  under  TA  2985-SAM:  Strengthening Capacity for Macroeconomic Analysis, Plans, and Policy\nFormulation (Phase III), for $960,000, approved on 2 February 1998.\n\n\f33\n\n2. \n\nPower Demand\n\n9.\nFrom  1989  to  1998,  the  domestic  sector  substantially  increased  its  share  of  energy\nconsumption in the form of electricity, due to the Government\u2019s program for rural electrification.\nThe 1997 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES)9 indicated that 91 percent of the\nhouseholds in Samoa used electricity for lighting, compared with less than 9 percent using gas\nor  kerosene.  In  contrast,  only  2.6  percent  of  the  households  used  electricity  for  cooking.\nBiomass dominated as a cooking fuel (74 percent). Even though it is cheaper than electricity for\ncooking and easier to use than wood, propane gas use was only 8.3 percent.\n\n10.\nThe  commercial  sector  represented  the  largest  consumer  group,  accounting  for  42.4\npercent  of  the  total  electricity  consumption  in  Samoa  during  1991\u20132000.  The  domestic  sector\nwas  the  second  largest,  representing  36  percent  of  consumption.  The  third  largest  group  was\nthe religious and school facilities, accounting for 9.4 percent, followed by industry (7.2 percent),\nhotels (3.5 percent), and streetlights (1.5 percent). A simple head count gave the total number\nof  electricity  consumers  in  2000  as  22,093.  Of  this,  92  percent  were  domestic  consumers\n(20,344  customers).  Commercial  consumers  accounted  for  4.5  percent  (986  customers),  with\nhotels, industrial, religious and school facilities accounting for the remaining 3.5 percent.\n\n11.\nMajor power demand exists on the two main islands of Upolu and Savai'i. Upolu, where\nthe  Afulilo  hydropower  scheme  is  located,  had  a  peak  demand  of  13.5  megawatts  (MW)  in\n2000, compared with the 2.5 MW peak demand in Savai'i. The demand on Manono Island was\nless  than  100  kilowatts  (kW)  and  that  on  Apolima  Island  was  less  than  25  kW.  The  long-term\ngrowth of the Upolu peak power demand has averaged 5.9 percent per annum, from 2.41 MW\nin  1970  to  13.5  MW  in  2000.  The  load  demand  increased  at  an  annual  rate  of  5.4  percent\nbetween 1991 and 2000. This trend is expected to continue, with the electricity demand in Upolu\nto increase by an average of at least 4 percent a year in the next decade. Most of the growth is\nanticipated to be in the commercial and domestic sectors (Appendix 2).\n\n3. \n\nPower Supply\n\n12.\nEPC is responsible for providing power supply for the islands of Upolu, Savai'i, Manono,\nand  Apolima.  The  Upolu  generation  system,  the  largest,  comprises  11.5  MW  installed\nhydropower  plants,  and  12.8  MW  installed  diesel  plants.  The  hydropower  plants  include  the  4\nMW Afulilo long-term storage hydropower plant, and four run-of-river (ROR) hydro stations. The\nlatter include a 1.0 MW (wet season capacity) station, a 1.6 MW station, a 1.4 MW station, and\na 3.5 MW station. The capacity of the ROR stations in the dry season is typically 80 percent less\nthan  that  in  the  wet  season.  Much  of  the  12.8  MW  diesel  plant  is  derated  due  to  age  and\nmechanical  restrictions  and  will  be  retired  progressively  in  the  near  future.  Also,  due  to  the\nreduced  hydropower  generation  capacity  in  the  dry  season,  except  for  the  Afulilo  storage\nscheme, additional firm energy capacity is required in the Upolu power system. To summarize,\nthe Upolu system currently has a maximum generating capacity of 24.3 MW in the wet season\nand 18.3 MW in the dry season. The firm capacity10 is only 10.3 MW, which is less than the 13.5\nMW  peak  demand  in  2000  (Appendix  3).  Without  additional  generation  capacity,  the  demand\n\n                                          \n9  Samoa HIES Tabulation Report.

EPC  was\nestablished  as  a  corporation  under  the  Electric  Power  Corporation  Act  of  1972  and  is  wholly\nowned  by  the  Government.  It  is  governed  by  a  board  chaired  by  the  minister  of  works.  Other\nboard  members  represent  consumers,  educational  bodies,  commercial    and  religious  groups,\nand the EPC general manager. Prior to 1972, the power sector had been a department of public\nworks, which operated one small ROR hydropower station at Alaoa near Apia with a capacity of\n1 MW in the wet season and 200 kW in the dry season, and another diesel station in Upolu.\n\n14.\nIn the last three decades, ADB has assisted EPC to supply the growing demand and to\nbecome more efficient as well as more commercially oriented (para. 27). However, the full-scale\nprivatization of EPC is not on the Government agenda in the short and medium term. The main\nreasons follow:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nPrivatization of electrical utilities in remote islands is not easy. Smallness of the\nmarket,  lack  of  skills,  expensive  logistics,  need  to  supply  rural  areas,  etc.,  are\nreal constraints to private sector investment.\n\nPower  supply  in  Samoa  is  a  monopoly.  Before  privatizing  EPC,  Samoa  needs\nadditional regulatory reform\u2013and a regulatory body\u2013to define the tariff setup, as\nwell  as  establish  clear  and  transparent  rules  for  accountability.  The  regulatory\nframework must also consider that electricity is pervasive and influences all other\nsectors, and a minimum of electricity supply is a basic need.\n\nThe policy objectives for the energy sector are to meet the growing demand by\nmaximizing  the  use  of  renewable  indigenous  resources,  including  hydropower,\nand minimizing the import of fuel. These objectives are hard to achieve through\nthe  private  sector.  Renewable  energy  resources  are  characterized  by  high\ninvestment costs and deferred returns.\n\nThe Government\u2013with ADB assistance\u2013is implementing a privatization program.\nPrivatization  has  been  part  of  the  Government  policy  agenda  since  1986,  and\nsince  1986  ADB  has  been  assisting \nin  progressively\nimplementing  this  effort  in  a  logical  step-wise  fashion  (paras.  20-26).  EPC\nprivatization has not been identified as a priority.\n\nthe  Government \n\nUnder  current  regulations,  other  entities  are  allowed  to  generate  and  distribute\npower,  under  license  from  EPC.  However,  there  is  no  such  entity  at  present.\nFirms and individuals may own and operate backup generators for their own use\nwhen the public supply is not available. Ownership of backup generators by large\npower consumers such as hotels is common.\n\n15.\nThe  Upolu  system  combines  transmission  and  distribution  functions  together  as  there\nare  no  dedicated  feeders  to  transfer  power  from  generation  centers  to  load  centers.  Power\ndistribution  is  by  33-kilovolt  (kV),  22  kV,  and  6.6  kV  primary  lines,  and  service  is  at  415/230\n\n\f55\n\nvolts. The system is basically radial with the main load centers concentrated along the northern\ncoast\u2013mainly around Apia, the capital\u2013and the western part of the island.\n\n16.\nThere  are  two  main  generation  centers.  One  is  located  at  the  load  center  in  Apia  and\nbased  on  diesel  as  well  as  ROR  hydropower  generation.  The  second  generation  center  is\nlocated in the northeast of the island where there are significant hydropower resources including\nthe Afulilo hydroelectric power scheme and Lalomunga scheme. These two generation centers\nare  connected  with  a  radial  single  circuit  33  kV  distribution  feeder  (north  coast  feeder).  The\nfeeder is 32 kilometers (km) long and connects the switchyards at Lalomunga (northeast) and\nTanugamanono (Apia). The 33 kV feeder does not have a 33 kV switchgear and relies on a 22\nkV  switchgear  with  the  possibility  of  exceeding  the  capacity  of  the  equipment  in  the  peak\nperiods. The feeder also supplies some load (in Solosolo) along the north coast. The feeder is\nconnected to the 22 kV distribution by 6 megavolt-ampere (MVA) auto-transformers.\n\n17.\nIn addition to the north coast transmission line, there is a south coast transmission loop\nthat follows the Cross Island Road and South Coast Road to connect the northeast generation\ncenter  (Afulilo  hydropower)  to  the  north  coast  load  center.  This  22  kV  transmission  line\nconnecting generation and load centers is radial and therefore vulnerable to load disturbances.\nAny  outage  of  the  radial  transmission  line  connecting  the  Afulilo  power  scheme  to  the  load\ncenter has the potential to totally black out the system. The capacity of the south transmission\nloop  needs  to  be  upgraded  to  allow  transmission  of  the  increased  power  output  from  the\nproposed Project to the major load center in Apia.\n\n18.\nUnder the rural electrification program started in the early 1990s, EPC built distribution\nextensions  to  rural  villages  extensively.  By  the  end  of  2000,  EPC  had  provided  access  to\nelectricity  for  approximately  94  percent  of  Samoa\u2019s  population.  After  these  projects  were\ncompleted,  the  Government  reimbursed  the  initial  costs  of  the  rural  electrification  projects  to\nEPC.  EPC  is  responsible  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  rural  electrification\nprojects.\n\n19.\nThe  energy  losses,  defined  as  the  percentage  difference  between  gross  energy\ngenerated and energy sold, were 15.2 percent in FY1994/95, 18.8 percent in FY1995/96, 17.1\npercent in FY1997/98, 16.0 percent in FY1998/99, and 15 percent in FY1999/2000. These loss\npercentages  are  high.  A  number  of  technical  and  nontechnical  factors  contribute  to  the  high\nlosses  in  EPC\u2019s  system.  A  1998  tariff  study  recommended  that  12  percent  would  be  an\nappropriate target for EPC to reduce its energy loss.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n1.\n\nOverview\n\n20.\nThe Government has continued its program of economic and financial reforms aimed at\nstrengthening  the  economic  base  of  the  country.  It  has  liberalized  and  reformed  the  financial\nsector to facilitate private investment. This is consistent with ADB's own Pacific strategy,11 which\nemphasizes the need to remove impediments to private sector growth as a priority in countries\nrelatively well-endowed with natural resources such as Samoa. The benefits of this reform are\nnow reflected in the country's economic performance. From a low of 1 percent in 1997, growth\nin  the  economy  (GDP)  accelerated  to  3.4  percent  in  1998  and  5.6  percent  in  1999.  In  2000,\n\n                                          \n11 Office of Pacific Operations. A Pacific Strategy for the New Millennium, Manila, March 2000.\n\n\f66\n\neconomic  growth  exceeded  7  percent.  The  construction  industry  was  a  major  driving  force\nbehind  the  strong  performance,  with  commerce,  transport,  communications,  finance,  and\nbusiness service sectors significantly contributing to the growth.\n\nOver the past few years, Samoa has refocused its reform policies on promoting private\n21.\nsector  development  and  reducing  the  dominance  of  the  public  sector.  Good  progress  in\nintroducing  modern  public-sector  management  practices  has  been  made  in  a  relatively  short\nperiod  and  the  public  sector  has  become  more  accountable  and  transparent.  Other\nachievements  include  wide-ranging  financial  sector  reforms,  specifically  triggered  by  ADB\u2019s\nFinancial  Sector  Program  Loan  (FSPL),12  and  substantial  improvements  to  an  enabling\nbusiness environment.\n\n22. With  a  remaining  portfolio  of  28  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  including  EPC,  the\npublic  sector  still  accounts  for  a  large  part  of  the  country\u2019s  economic  activities  and  formal\nemployment. Inadequate standards of oversight in the past have tended to exempt SOEs from\npublic  scrutiny,  which  has  led  to  a  low  degree  of  corporate  governance  and  performance.  To\nstrengthen the legal and institutional framework for enhanced performance and governance of\nSOEs,  and  as  required  under  the  FSPL,  the  Government  introduced  the  Public  Bodies\n(Performance  and  Accountability)  Bill  2001  in  Parliament  to  provide  the  umbrella  legislative\nframework for SOEs (or Public Bodies).13 This Bill, in combination with the Companies Act 2001\nand  Public  Finance  Management  Act  2001,  constitutes  a  significantly  improved  framework  for\nSOE  reporting  and  monitoring,  and  is  expected  to  lead  to  enhanced  SOE  performance  and\ncorporate governance.\n\nThe  introduction  of  the  new  legislative  framework  represents  an  important  step  to\n23.\nimprove  the  enabling  business  environment  for  the  private  sector,  and  substantially  enhance\nSOE performance and corporate governance. The Government acquired a new momentum to\ncarry  forward  the  reform  process  in  terms  of  commercialization  and  privatization.    ADB  has\nassisted the implementation of the privatization strategy14 and is considering further assistance\nto  implement  the  SOE  reform  strategy  by  (i)  implementing  the  reporting,  monitoring,  and\nadvisory  provisions  of  the  new  SOE  legislation,  including  the  Companies  Act  2001,  the  Public\nFinance  Management  Act  2001  and  the  Public  Bodies  (Performance  and  Accountability)  Bill\n2001;  (ii)  undertaking  action  to  privatize  SOEs  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  reform\npriorities; (iii) supporting the Government in formulating objectives and strategies for the SOEs\nthat it plans to retain over the medium term; (iv) strengthening the capacity of the Government\nto  implement  SOE  reforms,  and  (v)  addressing  other  management  and  governance  issues  in\nSOEs.\n\n2.\n\nSector Policy\n\nA  reliable  and  affordable  supply  of  energy  is  essential  to  promote  and  achieve  private\n24.\nsector-led  economic  growth.  The  country's  energy  policy  aims  to  reduce  national  spending  on\nthe  importation  of  petroleum  products.  Emphasis  is  on  (i)  employing  indigenous  energy\nresources  in  place  of  imports,  whenever  economically  feasible;  (ii)  promoting  energy\n\n                                          \n12  Loan 1608-SAM(SF): Financial Sector Program, for $7.5 million equivalent, approved on 19 February 1998.\n13 The Bill was discussed in Parliament during its August 2001 session and was referred to the Parliamentary Bill\nSelection Committee.

Within  this  framework,  the  Government's  statement  of  economic  strategy  (SES)  for\n2000-2001 defines the development strategy for the power sector as follows:\n\nIn  the  SES  period,  emphasis  will  be  given  to  strengthening  the\ninstitutional capacity and management capability of the EPC. The Corporation is\nexpected to adopt a more commercial approach to service delivery and customer\nrelations.  Improved  management  and  financial  viability  will  be  essential  if  the\ncapital  investment  programs  envisaged  for  the  Corporation  are  to  yield  full\nbenefits  to  the  people.  The  Corporation  will  also  concentrate  on  providing\nmeasures to manage peak load growth.\n\nThe SES includes a plan for the developing the power sector. The following are listed as\n\n26.\nthe main components of this plan:\n\ni.\nii.\niii.\niv.\nv.\nvi.\n\nformulate an institutional strengthening project for EPC,\nintroduce cost recovery measures,\naugment the Afulilo hydropower scheme,\nadd/replace diesel generators,\ncontinue discussions for the hydropower scheme at Sili, and\nassess the viability of the Manono submarine cable.\n\nParas. 32-51 describe the important actions required for developing the power sector in Samoa\nin line with the plan.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Power Sector\n\n27.\nADB  has  been  a  major  development  partner  of  Samoa  in  the  power  sector.  It  has\nprovided the power sector with seven loans and 12 TA grants over the last 30 years.

The  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries,  as  a  cofinancier  of  ADB,  extended  a\nloan amounting to $1.7 million to rehabilitate damaged hydropower generation facilities of Upolu\nisland.15 The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provided assistance to engage\nthe  services  of  an  expatriate  for  the  manager-generation  position  at  EPC.  Australia  and  New\nZealand  are  providing  assistance  to  EPC  with  the  financial  controller  and  the  auditor,\nrespectively.  As  part  of  its  assistance  for  medium-term  rehabilitation  and  restoration  works,\nJapan has committed $4.0 million for rural electrification.\n\n                                          \n15 Under Loan 752-SAM: Multiproject Loan, for $4.4 million, approved on 19 November 1985.\n\n\fD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n99\n\n29.\nADB has extensive experience in the power sector in the Asian and Pacific region. The\nmajor lessons from this experience were evaluated in 1997.16 The evaluation concluded that the\nfactors crucial to successful project performance have been (i) experience and capability of the\nexecuting agency; (ii) appropriateness of technical design; (iii) timely and adequate availability\nof counterpart funding; (iv) reliability of demand and load forecasts; (v) flexible ADB intervention\nand increased supervision throughout the project cycle; (vi) adoption of geological, hydrological,\nand environmental impact investigations and abatement measures; (vii) effective application of\nO&M  standards  and  procedures;  and  (viii)  determined  implementation  of  cost  recovery\nmechanisms and tariff reforms. It was noted that close periodic monitoring of major project risks\nand  assumptions,  notably  demand  forecasts,  generating  capacity,  system  losses,  fuel  and\nelectricity  pricing,  geological  and  climatological  (e.g.,  rainfall)  conditions,  and  the  security\nsituation would improve project administration and facilitate economic and financial evaluation of\nprojects at completion and postevaluation.\n\nThe overall rating of completed and postevaluated projects in the power sector indicated\n30.\nthat  79  percent  of  the  projects  were  generally  successful,  with  only  1  percent  rated  as\nunsuccessful.  A  number  of  project  objectives  had  been  substantially  met,  including  the\nfollowing:  (i)  expanding,  rehabilitating  or  upgrading  power  generation  to  meet  the  growing\ndemand for electricity; (ii) reducing dependence on imported sources by developing indigenous\nsources  of  energy;  (iii)  improving  overall  power  systems  reliability  and  efficiency;  and  (iv)\nimproving  access  of  the  poor  to  power.  Sustaining  success  in  the  sector  requires  increased\nemphasis on (i) critically assessing energy demand to avoid underutilization or overcapacity of\npower supply; (ii) incorporating appropriate cost recovery and energy efficiency mechanisms on\nboth  supply  and  demand  sides;  (iii)  ensuring  proper  O&M  of  project  facilities;  (iv)  considering\nenvironmental  factors  in  energy  development;  and  (v)  improving  the  institutional  capacity  of\nenergy  entities  in  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  as  executing  and  implementing\nagencies,  with  a  view  to  redefining  the  role  of  the  government  and  enlarging  the  scope  for\nprivate sector participation in the subsector.\n\n31.\nAnother impact evaluation study of ADB assistance to the power sector was specific  to\nthe  Pacific  DMCs,  including  Samoa.17  The  1998  study  report  concluded  that  institutional\nstrength,  not  capital  finance,  is  the  principal  constraint  facing  the  Pacific  DMC  power  sector.\nTherefore, technical assistance to the power sector in the Pacific DMCs should be emphasized\nand  should  promote:  (i)  improved  O&M,  (ii)  improved  standards  of  safety  and  environmental\nprotection,  (iii)  increased  efficiency  and  lower  costs,  (iv)  increased  management  capacity  for\nboth  administration  and  planning,  (v)  improved  reporting  and  increased  transparency  of\noperations,  and  (vi)  improved  measurement  of  performance.  These  dimensions  were  all\ncarefully considered in designing this Project.\n\nE.\n\nADB Sector Strategy\n\n32.\nThe  ADB  energy  policy  during  the  1970s  and  1980s  focused  on  (i)  accelerated\ndevelopment  of  indigenous  resources  and  supply  augmentation,  (ii)  adoption  of  least-cost\nconsiderations in energy planning, (iii) efficiency in construction and operation of energy supply\n\n                                          \n16  OEO. 1997.

EPC  was\nwhen  concessional  development  assistance  may  no \ncorporatized in 1972 with assistance from ADB. Policy dialogue with the Government and EPC\nsince  then  has  focused  on  its  further  commercialization  in  a  step-by-step  fashion.  In  this\nrespect, ADB's strategy focuses on (i) strengthening the institutional capacity and management\ncapability  of  the  utility,  including  benchmarking  EPC  against  other  Pacific  region  utilities,20  (ii)\nencouraging increased engagement of the private sector, including a broader participation in the\nboard of directors of EPC, and outsourcing of nonessential functions; (iii) reducing dependence\non imported fossil fuel and protecting the corporation from external shocks associated with fuel\nprice  adjustments,  by  implementing  measures  such  as  automatic  tariff  adjustments;  and  (iv)\nrelieving the utility's financial burden through a number of measures including tariff increase and\nrestructuring EPC's debt with the Treasury Department.\n\nIn  view  of  the  long-term  nature  of  the  investments,  the  importance  of  environmental\n36.\nissues  associated  with  the  power  sector,  the  relative  size  of  the  market,  and  the  terms  of\ncommercial loans (e.g., 11\u201312 percent annual interest rate with a five-year repayment period),\nfull privatization of the utility is not yet an acceptable option to the Government nor a desirable\nsolution for EPC, given the social and poverty reduction objectives of the Government to provide\nelectricity  to  remote  rural  areas.  ADB's  assistance  for  implementing  the  Government's\nprivatization  strategy  will  provide  a  better  understanding  of  the  required  private  sector\ninvolvement in EPC (paras. 20-23) especially in the light of many failures in privatizing energy\nutilities in other countries. ADB's objective is to move from assisting the commercialization of the\nsingle  utility  to  assisting  the  whole  privatization  strategy  of  the  Government  and  limit  future\nassistance to the sector to the development of renewable energy for disadvantaged areas.\n\nThe Government has requested ADB to consider further assistance to the sector along\n37.\nthe  principles  described  in  para.  36.  Assistance  will  particularly  be  required  in  the  future  for\ndeveloping  a  hydropower  project  on  the  island  of  Savai'i.21  ADB  and  the  Government  are\ndiscussing different options for further involvement of the private sector with the proposed new\n\n                                          \n18 Asian Development Bank. 1995.

Once these objectives are achieved,\nthen ADB\u2019s involvement will be limited to the poverty reduction relationship to the energy sector.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n38.\nADB has provided TAs in the areas of policies, strategies, and institutional building over\nan  extended  period  of  time  (Table  1).  Current  discussions  with  the  Government  and  EPC,\nparticularly  during  project  processing,  have  focused  on  the  following:  institutional  capacity\nbuilding, financial performance, tariffs (especially for the poor), and Government energy policy\nthat  emphasizes  development  of  indigenous  renewable  hydropower  to  replace  imported  fuels.\nThe  dialogue  has  focused  strongly  on  the  institutional  and  financial  aspects  of  EPC  to  ensure\nthe  efficient  development  of  the  power  sector  and  further  evolution  of  private  sector\ninvolvement. The essence of the dialogue, the progress already made, and the plan of actions\nagreed upon are presented here. Appendix 4 gives a list of conditionalities agreed upon through\npolicy dialogue between the Government/EPC and ADB since 1998 when ADB provided a TA\nfor  energy  sector  review  and  policy  recommendations  and,  in  the  course  of  processing  the\nProject, the current status of implementation.\n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Capacity Building for EPC\n\nEPC\u2019s organization includes a general manager, a deputy general manager, and seven\n39.\nmanagers  responsible \nfor  generation,  distribution,  utilization,  engineering  development,\nfinancial/accounting,  administration  and  Savai'i  power  system  (Appendix  5).  In  the  last  few\nyears, EPC has become\u2013with ADB assistance\u2013commercially viable. The number of employees\nhas been reduced from over 440 in 1999 to 385 at present despite the continued load growth in\nthis period. In response to the latest SES, EPC has developed its first corporate plan for 2000\u2013\n2002.  The  plan  establishes  the  vision,  mission,  objectives,  and  management  plan  for\ntransforming  EPC  into  a  more  commercially  oriented  corporation,  and  improving  its  financial,\ntechnical, and customer service performance.\n\n40.\nTo carry out the EPC corporate plan, the EPC management developed its first business\nplan  for  2000\u20132001.  It  set  specific  action  plans  and  monitoring  procedures  for  each  of  EPC\u2019s\noperation departments. The goals are to prepare EPC to operate and develop in an efficient and\ncost-effective way so that high-quality services and electricity are provided at minimum cost to\nits customers.\n\nEPC\u2019s institutional strength has improved significantly during the past three years. It has\n41.\nfilled the position of financial controller with a well-qualified expatriate professional required for\nthe  job.  It  has  installed  and  trained  its  staff  on  the  use  of  a  new  computerized  billing  and\naccounting  system.  Accounts  receivable  have  been  in  good  condition.  In  2000,  almost  70\npercent of EPC\u2019s customers paid their bills within 10 days.\n\n42.\nAs a part of the understanding reached during the processing of this loan proposal, the\nEPC  management  board  recently  implemented  an  automatic  tariff  adjustment  mechanism  for\ndiesel  fuel  price  and  foreign  currency  variations  to  improve  its  cash  flow  position.  Based  on  a\ncost-benefit analysis, the management board also adopted a plan to phase out the 10 percent\ndiscount  given  to  customers  making  immediate  payments.  EPC  will  charge  a  penalty  of  2\n\n\f1212\n\npercent  per  month  on  amounts  overdue.  The  board  implemented  a  lifeline  rate  to  make\nelectricity  more  affordable  to  low-income  consumers.  EPC  also  set  up  an  improved  computer\nnetwork  system.  All  these  actions  lay  the  foundation  for  EPC  to  further  improve  its  technical,\nfinancial, and customer service performance.\n\n43.\nEPC has developed institutional capacity in implementing the Afulilo hydropower project.\nThe  project  was  implemented  under  difficult  conditions.  Cyclone  Val  severely  damaged  the\nproject  and  the  surrounding  environment.  EPC  learned  valuable  lessons  on  how  to  cope  with\nnatural disasters. This experience has enhanced EPC\u2019s ability to manage the proposed Project\neffectively.\n\n3.\n\nPast Financial Performance\n\n44.\nIn  the  past,  the  financial  condition  of  EPC  had  not  been  satisfactory  despite  the  policy\nchanges  required  under  prior  ADB  loans.  One  reason  was  that  EPC  was  unable  to  adjust  its\ntariff in a timely manner to offset the increases in costs of providing electricity services. It started\nto improve in 1999 (Table 2). In FY2000, despite the fuel price increase, the net operating cash\nflow  was  equal  to  $2.75  million.22  The  measures  being  taken  for  timely  tariff  adjustments  and\nimproved financial performance are discussed in the following sections.\n\nTable 2: EPC Financial Performance\n(year ending 30 June)\n\nItem\nElectricity Sales (kWh \u2019000)\nElectricity Revenues (ST \u2019000)\nNet Electricity Revenues (ST \u2019000)a\nNonelectric Revenues (ST \u2019000)b\nCost of Electricity Sales (ST \u2019000)\nOperating Expenses (ST \u2019000)\nTotal Expenses (ST \u2019000)\nNet Operating Cash Flow\nTotal operating Revenues (ST \u2019000)c\nNet Sales Price (ST/kWh)\nUnit Sales Cost (ST/kWh)\nLoss per Output (ST/kWh)\n  kWh = kilowatt-hour.\n aThe difference between electricity revenues and net electricity revenues are the Samoa Broadcasting Corporation\nlevy and discounts for prompt payment.\n bNonelectricity revenue includes interest on overdue accounts, interest on deposits, and sundry revenues.\n cThe decrease in net operating cash flow in 2000 was due to the large increase in fuel costs.\n\n2000\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:6)(cid:9)(cid:8)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:5)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:12)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:6)(cid:7)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:2)(cid:6)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:6)(cid:7)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:2)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:5)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:6)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:2)(cid:10)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:13)(cid:11)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:2)(cid:3)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:5)(cid:8)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:5)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:3)\n\n1998\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:2)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:10)(cid:10)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:7)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:8)(cid:3)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:12)(cid:7)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:3)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:2)(cid:10)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:13)\n(cid:1)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:10)(cid:10)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:7)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:6)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:7)(cid:2)(cid:7)\n\n1997\n(cid:1)(cid:6)(cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)\n(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:6)\n(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:12)(cid:11)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:9)(cid:5)(cid:9)\n(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:5)(cid:3)\n(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:12)(cid:3)\n(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:8)(cid:8)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:13)\n(cid:1)(cid:13)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:3)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:7)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:7)(cid:5)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:7)\n\n1996\n(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:2)(cid:5)(cid:2)\n(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:8)\n(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:7)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:11)\n(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:12)(cid:5)(cid:3)\n(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:7)(cid:6)\n(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:6)(cid:2)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:13)\n(cid:1)(cid:13)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:2)(cid:5)(cid:11)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:10)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:7)(cid:9)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:10)\n\n1999\n(cid:1)(cid:6)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:5)\n(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:5)\n(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:11)(cid:7)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:2)\n(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:8)\n(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:5)\n(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:11)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:7)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:2)(cid:6)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:11)(cid:3)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:6)(cid:10)\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:10)(cid:7)(cid:9)\n\n4.\n\nPower Tariff Adjustment\n\n45.\nAppropriate  levels  and  timely  tariff  adjustments  are  essential  for  EPC  to  achieve\nsatisfactory  financial  performance.  EPC  should  be  able  to  (i)  pay  for  all  the  costs  of  providing\nelectricity services and  achieve a reasonable rate of return on capital investments, (ii) provide\nand  retain  net  earnings  that  can  finance  a  significant  proportion  of  capital  costs  for  system\nexpansion in the future, and (iii) operate as a financially sound enterprise that can borrow funds\n\n                                          \n22 The net operating cash flow is the net profit (loss) minus depreciation.\n\n\f1313\n\nat  commercial  rates  for  expansion.  Adequate  tariff  levels  combined  with  an  appropriate  tariff\nstructure are also necessary to send price signals to consumers on the real economic costs of\npower supply, to encourage more efficient power consumption and demand-side management\npractices.\n\n46.\nADB's  sector  policy  stresses  that  the  charge  for  electrical  power  to  consumers  should\ncover  the  full  cost  of  the  service  including  interest  costs.  Tariffs  should  be  set  to  cover  all\noperating  costs,  depreciation,  and  interest  expenses;  and  to  produce  an  adequate  return  on\nequity. The tariffs should also provide for automatic and timely adjustments for variations in fuel\nprices and exchange rates. The tariff structure should have higher rates for peak hour and peak\nseason consumption as the costs of providing service are higher during those periods (footnote\n18).\n\n47.\nIn December 1986, under the Afulilo Hydroelectric Project Loan Agreement (Loan 813,\nfootnote 2), EPC agreed to take necessary measures to produce (i) a self-financing ratio of not\nless than 20 percent of its capital expenditures based on a five-year moving average, (ii) a debt-\nservice ratio of not less than 1.3 times the estimated maximum debt-service requirements, and\n(iii)  a  rate  of  return  on  revalued  net  fixed  assets  of  at  least  5  percent  by  1990  and  at  least  8\npercent  from  1995  onward.  These  were  not  met  as  a  result  of  the  cost  overrun  caused  by\ncyclones  and  increased  operation  expenses.  In  1993,  with  the  Afulilo  Hydroelectric  Project\nSupplementary Loan Agreement (Loan 1228, footnote 3), the targeted rates of return of 5 and 8\npercent were moved to FY1996 and FY1997, respectively. With the management actions taken\nby EPC (paras. 39-43) recently, EPC is expected to gradually improve its financial performance\nto  meet  its  long-term  debt  obligations  to  the  Government  for  Loans  813-SAM(SF)  and  1228-\nSAM(SF).\n\n48.\nA tariff study was conducted in 1998 as part of the ongoing policy dialogue. On the basis\nof  the  recommendations  made,  the  tariff  was  increased  from  ST0.43/kilowatt-hour(kWh)  to\nST0.60/kWh (around $0.202/kWh) effective from September 1998.23 EPC requested more time\nto consider the tariff study\u2019s other recommendations such as changes in the tariff structure for\nlarge consumers and an automatic adjustment to the tariff. These are included as covenants for\nthis Project. Appendix 6 shows the current status of compliance with ADB\u2019s loan covenants.\n\n49.\nEPC\u2019s  tariff  was  increased  progressively.  The  tariff  was  ST0.15/kWh  ($0.145/kWh)  in\n1980 and was raised to 0.40 ST/kWh ($0.173/kWh) in 1990, ST0.43/kWh ($0.167/kWh) in 1993,\nand ST0.60/kWh ($0.202/kWh) in September 1998. Table 3 shows the changes of the annual\naverage electricity tariff in Samoa since 1985.\n\nTable 3: Annual Average Electricity Tariff in Samoa (ST/kWh)\n\nItem\nNominal\nReal\n\n1985\n0.23\n0.47\n\n1990\n0.40\n0.55\n\n1995\n0.43\n0.50\n\n1996\n0.43\n0.48\n\n1997\n0.43\n0.44\n\n1998\n0.47\n0.48\n\n1999\n0.60\n0.61\n\n2000\n0.60\n0.60\n\n50.\nIn 2000, EPC took the initiative with Samoa Treasury Department to restructure its debts\nand arrears to the Government. On 28 February 2001, the Cabinet approved the restructuring of\nEPC debts to the Treasury Department. Under the agreement of 19 October 2001 between EPC\n\n                                          \n23 One tala was equal to $0.338 in 1998.\n\n\f1414\n\nand  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa,  EPC\u2019s  existing  loans  and  arrears  to  the  Government\nunder the twelve separate loan agreements concluded between the parties from 1979 to 1993\nwere  consolidated  into  a  single  loan  valued  at  ST70.8  million  with  a  minimum  annual  interest\nrate of 5 percent, a grace period of 5 years, and payment period of 20 years. This agreement\nincludes  the  two  subsidiary  loans  of  ADB.  The  Government  and  ADB  agreed  to  modify  the\nrelending interest rate of 7.65 percent of these two subsidiary loans. One of the objectives of TA\n3203-SAM  for  institutional  strengthening  (footnote  6)  was  to  build  consensus  around  an\nacceptable action plan for EPC to meet its financial obligations in a sustainable manner. The TA\nhelped facilitate development and negotiations of the agreement. The agreed-upon interest rate\nreduction agreed on the EPC\u2019s loan repayments to the Treasury Department is justified, as the\nopportunity cost of capital has substantially declined in Samoa. In 1986 the average interest rate\non savings deposits was 7.4 percent and that on 6-month deposits was 13.1 percent. In 2000,\nthese interest rates were reduced to 3.0 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively.24 As part of the\nagreement, EPC paid the Treasury ST4.8 million on 29 June 2001 to cover its interest arrears.\n\n51.\nUnder  the  same  TA  3203-SAM,  specific  recommendations  for  EPC  were  developed,\nincluding  the  following:  (i)  automatically  adjust  tariffs  for  change  in  fuel  price  and  foreign\ncurrency exchange rate, (ii) establish a lifeline rate for low-income electricity consumers, and (iii)\nphase  out  the  current  discount  given  for  prompt  payment  of  bills  within  10  days.  These\nrecommendations  were  designed  to  help  EPC  improve  its  financial  performance  and  make\nelectricity  more  affordable  to  low-income  Samoans.25  On  28  February  2001,  the  EPC\nmanagement  board  adopted \nfinancial\nperformance and also help meet the loan covenants.\n\nthe  recommendations.  This  will \n\nimprove  EPC\u2019s \n\nThe lifeline tariff adjustment is budget-neutral for EPC. In fact, the lower revenues from\n52.\nresidential  users  with  low  consumption  (less  than  50  kWh/month)  will  be  cross-subsidized  by\nhigher  revenues  from  residential  users  with  high  consumption  (more  than  200  kWh/month).\nRecords in the recent past (Tables 2 and 3) indicate that electricity demand has been inelastic\nto  tariff  increase.  Therefore,  the  proposed  automatic  tariff  adjustment  will  not  affect  revenue\ngeneration negatively.\n\n5.\n\nProjected Financial Performance of EPC\n\n53.\nA number of EPC's actions in the past three years have gradually improved its financial\nperformance.  In  September  1998,  EPC  increased  its  tariff  by  40  percent.  Furthermore,  earlier\nthis year (2001), EPC agreed to implement an automatic tariff adjustment for currency and fuel\ncost changes, phase out the discount for prompt bill payments, and reevaluate its fixed assets.\nIn the past, EPC had used inflation rates to adjust the values of its fixed assets. This method of\nasset  valuation  resulted  in  overvaluation.  In  2000,  EPC  contracted  an  international  firm  to\ncomplete a reassessment of its fixed assets based on replacement costs. The reassessed net\nfixed  assets  value  was  reduced  from  ST237.2  million  to  ST183.6  million  as  of  30  June  2000,\nand  annual  depreciation  costs  have  become  lower.  Additionally,  EPC\u2019s  rate  of  return  on  fixed\nassets has improved as the denominator (fixed asset value) of the equation used in the rate of\nreturn calculation is reduced.\n\n                                          \n24 In real terms, the 6-month interest rate on deposits was 7.3 percent in 1986 and 5.6 percent in 2000. For 2001, this\n\nis estimated to be 3.5 percent.\n\n25 The lifeline tariff rate structured to make electricity more affordable to the low-income consumers will not negatively\n\naffect EPC's financial position. This will be settled through cross-subsidy within the domestic sector.\n\n\f1515\n\nThe  Government  has  approved  restructuring  of  EPC\u2019s  arrears  of  ST75.6  million  based\n54.\non a detailed assessment. This will save EPC over ST3.0 million per year in interest expense.\nEPC is working to further reduce system losses to less than 12.0 percent within five years. All\nthese measures  will provide a foundation for EPC to turn around its financial performance in a\nsustainable manner.\n\n55.\nTable 4 summarizes the projected performance of the three key financial indicators for\nEPC.  More  detailed  financial  projections  are  presented  in  Appendix  7.  Due  to  EPC\u2019s  massive\nrural electrification programs that have substantially increased its fixed assets and reduced its\nrate  of  return  on  net  fixed  assets,  the  Government  and  ADB  agreed  to  reduce  the  return  on\nassets  covenant  from  8  percent  to  6  percent.  EPC\u2019s  financial  performance  is  expected  to\nimprove  substantially.  The  rate  of  return  on  net  fixed  assets  is  projected  to  gradually  improve\nfrom 4.45 percent in 2001 to 5.68 percent in 2004 and 8.89 percent in 2008. Similarly, EPC is\nexpected to achieve satisfactory debt-service ratio and self-financing ratio.\n\nTable 4: Projected Financial Performance of EPC\n\nCriteria\n\nRate of Return on Net Fixed Assets (> 6%)\nDebt-Service Ratio ( > 1.3 times)\nSelf-Financing Ratio ( > 20%)\n\n2000\n\n0.82\n2.10\n        18\n\n2002\n\n5.69\n2.46\n77\n\n2005\n\n7.43\n2.26\n88\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n56.\nThe  economy  of  Samoa  has  performed  well  in  recent  years.  GDP  growth  accelerated\nfrom  less  than  1  percent  in  1997  to  more  than  7  percent  in  2000.  The  good  economic\nperformance is partly due to the successful program of economic and financial reform and good\ngovernance that is boosting private sector activities.\n\nSince 1996, the Government of Samoa has been issuing a series of biennial statements\n57.\nof  economic  strategy  (SES).  These  have  all  emphasized  the  \u201cpartnership\u201d  approach  to\nformulating  and  implementing  the  national  development  policy.  The  current  strategy  (the  third\none  covering  2000\u20132001)  continues  to  emphasize  macroeconomic  stability,  public  sector\nefficiency, improved education and health standards, and measures to support a strong private\nsector. In addition, it emphasizes agriculture and fisheries, sustainable tourist development, and\nthe  importance  of  a  revitalized  village  economy.  An  important  feature  of  the  new  approach  to\nstrategic  planning  is  the  extensive  and  successful  consultation  with  stakeholders.  A  major\nobjective of the strategy is to ensure that the whole community shares the benefits of the reform\nprogram.\n\n58.\nADB\u2019s  strategy  of  assistance  to  Samoa  is  fully  compatible  with  and  supports  the\nGovernment\u2019s development strategy and its reform agenda, which aim to develop an enabling\nenvironment  for  a  private  sector-led  economic  growth.  ADB  supports  public  sector  reform,\nliberalizing  the  financial  sector,  promoting  private  sector-led  growth,  corporatizing  and\nprivatizing  SOEs,  improving  the  management  of  power  and  infrastructure  facilities,  and\naddressing inefficiencies in education, including skills development.\n\n\f1616\n\nADB  has  been  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda  for  several  years.  In\n59.\nFebruary  1998,  ADB  approved  a  Financial  Sector  Program  loan  for  $7.5  million  equivalent\n(footnotes 12). The program loan supports the development of a market-based financial sector\nsystem  to  increase  participation/mobilization  of  domestic  resources  and  promote  efficiency  in\nresource allocation. The program also aims to privatize, corporatize, and enhance the efficiency\nof  the  SOEs  and  utilities  and  helps  promote  private  sector-led  economic  growth  and\nemployment generation. The Government has met the conditions of the second tranche.\n\nThe power sector strategy of the Government is directly linked to ADB\u2019s overall country\n60.\nstrategy, which emphasizes poverty reduction and social and economic development objectives,\nincluding  private  sector  development.  The  energy  supply  is  becoming  a  constraint  to  the\ncountry\u2019s  economic  and  social  development.  In  FY  1999/2000,  EPC  had  a  total  of  77  power\noutages, each lasting an average of 30 minutes.\n\n61.\nThe project processing engaged ADB and EPC in an extended policy dialogue. Some of\nthe agreed-upon reforms have already been implemented (i.e., change in EPC board, measures\nfor  improved  financial  results,  lifeline  tariff  for  low-income  consumers,  automatic  tariff\nadjustment, etc.). Paras. 39-43 provide further details.\n\n62.\nThe basic rationale of the Project lies in the need to strengthen EPC\u2019s capacity to meet\nthe  growing  power  demand  in  Samoa  with  the  use  of  renewable  resources  in  a  least-cost\nmanner.  The  Government\u2019s  energy  policy  aims  at  reducing  dependence  on  imported  fuels\nthrough  development  of  indigenous  renewable  energy  sources,  and  meeting  the  demand  for\nelectricity with a high level of reliability. The proposed Project is consistent with this policy, as it\nwill develop hydro energy resources in place of diesel-generated energy supply. In addition, TA\nwill  be  provided  to  strengthen  EPC\u2019s  energy  loss  reduction  and  operation  management\ncapability.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n63.\nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  assist  the  Government  and  EPC  to  undertake\nnecessary policy changes, increase EPC efficiency and commercial viability, and undertake the\nhighest  priority  investment  to  augment  the  Afulilo  hydropower  scheme,  in  support  of  the\ncountry's energy sector development plan. In addition to the loan and the associated TA, power\nsector improvement will  continue through the long-term policy dialogue and implementation of\nthe  specific  Government  assurances  in  conjunction  with  this  loan.  The  loan  and  TA  are  an\neffective mechanism for the Government to continue improving the power sector and facilitating\nprivate sector engagement in the power sector.\n\n64.\n\nThe Project comprises the following:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nContinuing  the  policy  dialogue  to  facilitate  full  commercialization  of  EPC  and\nfurther  private  sector  engagement  in  the  power  sector.  The  power  sector  policy\nissues  discussed  and \nthe\nGovernment/EPC are presented in paras. 38-43. The specific assurances given\nfor the Project are summarized in Chapter VI.\n\nreached  by  ADB  and \n\nthe  agreements \n\nReducing energy losses and strengthening EPC operation management capacity\nto  provide  more  reliable  power  to  the  consumers.  The  scope  of  the  associated\nTA is described in paras. 90 to 91.\n\n\f1717\n\n(iii)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(vii)\n\n(ix)\n\nIncreasing Afulilo reservoir volume by 50 percent to 15 million cubic meters (m3).\nThis  will  be  accomplished  by  raising  the  dam  crest  by  1.7  m.  The  existing\nspillway crest will be capped with concrete and the spillway bridge will be jacked\nup to provide flood clearance.\n\n(iv)\n\nInstalling a third 2 MW generator in Ta\u2019elefaga power station.\n\nConstructing a 7.1 km gravity diversion canal.\n\nUpgrading  the  south  coast  transmission  loop  from  22  kV  to  33  kV  to\naccommodate the increased power output from the third 2 MW generator.\n\nExpanding the transformer capacity of the north coast transmission loop from 6\nMVA to 12 MVA to improve the reliability of the transmission system.\n\n(viii) Upgrading  the  telemetry  system  of  the  Afulilo  hydropower  scheme  to  improve\n\nmonitoring, communication, and control.\n\nImplementing  several  environmental  management  measures:  installing  a  new\nwater supply system for the affected villages, building a new bridge downstream\nfrom the power station to improve safety, and implementing a postproject water\nquality monitoring program.\n\n(x)\n\nProviding  consulting  services  for  detailed  design,  technical  review,  tender  and\naward of contract, and supervision of construction and project implementation.\n\nC.\n\nTechnical Justification\n\nThe  existing  Afulilo  hydropower  scheme  provides  a  total  capacity  of  4  MW  and  a\n65.\nmaximum power supply of 24 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per annum. The dam is made of concrete\nwith a central spillway, wings, and rockfill abutment on both sides. The existing reservoir surface\narea  is  approximately  251  hectares  (ha).  It  will  be  increased  by  7.8  percent  to  270.4  ha.  The\nhydraulic  discharge  is  conveyed  through  an  intake  tunnel  60  m  long  below  the  left  abutment.\nThis tunnel is then connected to a 4.0 km long descending penstock that carries the hydraulic\ndischarge to the powerhouse in Ta\u2019elefaga village near Fagaloa Bay.\n\n66.\nThe existing Afulilo scheme was designed and constructed with provision for expansion.\nThe  Project  is  needed  now  to  cope  with  the  increasing  power  demand  and  deteriorating\nreliability of the system, particularly during the dry season. The Project will augment the existing\nAfulilo  power  by  installing  an  additional  2  MW  generating  unit.  This  will  be  relatively\nstraightforward as the size of the existing penstock is adequate for the increased water flow and\nthe civil works at the power station were already built for the installation of a third generator.\n\nExtra  water  to  power  the  third  generator  was  previously  envisaged  to  come  from  the\n67.\nconstruction  of  the  Vaipu  pumping  station  immediately  downstream  of  Afulilo.  In  view  of  the\nconsiderable environmental concern about flooding of the Vaipu swamp, the Vaipu station could\nnot be developed. On the other hand, seepage through the floor of the Afulilo reservoir is much\nsmaller  than  envisaged.  The  Afulilo  dam  feasibility  study  revealed  more  than  5  m  of  lake\nsediments  in  the  basin  upstream  of  the  dam.  These  sediments  help  reduce  seepage.  Thus,\nraising  the  reservoir/dam  spillway  and  constructing  a  canal  outside  the  present  catchment  to\nincrease  the  water  flow  of  the  reservoir  can  justify  the  addition  of  a  third  generator  in  Afulilo\u2019s\n\n\f1818\n\npowerhouse. The revision of the hydrology of the catchment areas was originally carried out in\nTA 2267,26 and reconfirmed by TA 3203 (footnote 6).\n\n68.\nConstruction of the Afulilo hydroelectric power project began in 1991. In March 1993 the\ndam was closed and the storage began filling. The first runs of the two generators were carried\nout  in  July  and  August  1993.  By  August  the  reservoir  had  reached  316.40  m  above  sea  level\n(masl) (1.1 m below the 317.50 masl full supply level) and the scheme was regularly supplying\npower to the grid. The storage continued to fill and the reservoir began to spill in October 1993\nand  continued  to  spill  until  late  November  1993.  The  reservoir  spilled  intermittently  from\nNovember 1993 to March 1994. The last spill took place in January 1997. Since then, EPC has\nmanaged to prevent water spills and to maximize the power output from the Afulilo scheme.\n\nThe Afulilo power augmentation will increase the height of the dam by 1.7 m from 317.50\n69.\nmasl to 319.20 masl. It will increase the reservoir\u2019s gross storage volume from 10 million m3 to\n15 million m3. The key objective is to store the water in the wet season and use it to produce\npower  in  the  dry  season.  With  the  augmented  installed  capacity  of  2  MW  and  the  average\naugmented generation from 21 to 31 GWh per annum, the plant capacity factor (percent of the\ntime  plant  is    running)  will  be  reduced  from  0.60  to  0.58,  which  reflects  better  its  peaking\ncapacity.  During  the  wet  season  from  November  to  March  when  other  ROR  hydropower  units\nare running, the augmented Afulilo scheme will be run only a few hours a day during daytime\nand system evening peak periods (from 6:30 pm to 9:30 pm). The Project will be operated at full\ncapacity  during  most  of  the  day  in  the  dry  season  (from  April  to  October)  when  other  ROR\nhydropower units are not running.\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n70.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $7.5  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of  import\nduties and taxes, of which the foreign exchange cost is $6.0 million (about 80 percent as EPC\nimports  almost  all  the  materials  and  equipment  it  needs).  The  local  cost  is  estimated  at  $1.5\nmillion  equivalent  (about  20  percent).  These  cost  estimates  are  based  on  2001  prices  and\ninclude provisions for physical contingencies and price escalation. The detailed cost estimates\nin Appendix 8 are summarized in Table 5.\n\n                                          \n26 TA  2267-SAM, Institutional Support and Power Development Study for the EPC,  for  $350,000,  approved  on  27\n\nDecember 1994.\n\n\f1919\n\nTable 5: Project Cost Estimates\n($\u2019000)\n\nItem\n\nDiversion Canal\nAfulilo Civil Works\nThird Generator\nTransmission\nMitigation Measures\nConsulting Services\n   Subtotal\nTaxes & Duties\nPhysical Contingency (8.3%)\nPrice Contingency (5.5%)\nInterest During Construction\n                   Total\n\nForeign\nExchange\n1,052\n305\n1,174\n2,153\n0\n450\n5,134\n0\n480\n350\n36\n6,000\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n171\n40\n46\n57\n615\n70\n999\n397\n64\n40\n0\n1,500\n\nTotal\nCost\n1,223\n345\n1,220\n2,210\n615\n520\n6,133\n397\n544\n390\n36\n7,500\n\nE.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $6.0 million equivalent from its Special Funds\n71.\nresources to finance the foreign exchange cost, including interest and charges on the ADB loan\nduring  construction  (Table  6).  The  Government/EPC  will  provide  a  total  of  $1,500,000\nequivalent to finance the local currency costs of the Project.\n\nSource\n\nADB\nEPC/Government\n        Total\n\nTable 6: Financing Plan\n($\u2018000)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n6,000\n               0\n6,000\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\n             0\n1,500\n1,500\n\nTotal\nCost\n6,000\n1,500\n7,500\n\nPercent\n\n80\n20\n100\n\n       ADB = Asian Development Bank, EPC = Electric Power Corporation.\n\n72.\nThe  Borrower  will  be  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa,  which  will  relend  the  loan\nproceeds to EPC under a subsidiary loan agreement with a minimum interest rate of 5.0 percent\nper annum and a repayment period of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years.\n\nF.\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  will  be  the  EPC,  a  statutory  government\n73.\ncorporation.  EPC  was  incorporated  in  December  1972  under  the  Electric  Power  Corporation\nAct, 1972. Under the Act and its amendments in 1980, 1981, and 1984, EPC is responsible for\ngenerating, transmitting, and distributing power in Samoa. It has a seven-member board, which\ndetermines  the  general  policy  of  EPC.  The  board  is  chaired  by  the  minister  of  works,  and\nincludes other members representing the Treasury Department, the Public Works Department,\nthe  Chamber  of  Commerce,  consumer  groups,  and  educational  and  church  bodies.  EPC's\ngeneral manager (the chief executive of EPC) is also on the board.\n\n\f2020\n\nG.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nProject Office and Implementation Schedule\n\nThe general manager of EPC will be responsible for overall management of the Project.\n74.\nTo  manage  day-to-day  implementation,  EPC  will  establish  a  project  office  to  be  headed  by  a\nfull-time project manager with qualifications and experience satisfactory to ADB. The office will\nbe adequately staffed at all times with competent supporting personnel to undertake day-to-day\nactivities  such  as  consultancy,  contracts,  procurement,  accounting,  records,  reports,  etc.  The\nproject  office  will  be  in  operation  before  the  effectiveness  date  and  until  2004,  which  is  a  few\nmonths after the project physical completion date of December 2003. EPC will be assisted by\nconsultants  in  preparing  engineering  designs,  supervising  construction,  and  technical  review.\nThe consultants will be selected and appointed by February 2002. A contract under a turnkey\narrangement for the civil works, electrical and mechanical equipment, and for the transmission\nloops  upgrade  is  expected  to  be  awarded  by  October  2002.  Appendix  9  gives  a  detailed\nimplementation schedule.\n\n2.\n\nProcurement\n\n75.\nAll  the  civil  works,  electrical  and  mechanical  works,  and  equipment  required  under  the\nProject  will  be  procured  preferably  through  one  single  turnkey  contract  following  international\ncompetitive bidding (ICB), a two-stage bidding procedure, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\nfor Procurement.  The  main  components  of  the  turnkey  package  will  be  (i)  civil  works,  (ii)\nelectrical and mechanical works and equipment, and (iii) transmission and telemetry upgrade.\n\n3.\n\nAdvance Action\n\n76.\nTo expedite procurement for the Project, ADB has approved the Government request for\nadvance  action  on  prequalification  of  contractors.  Similarly,  to  expedite  implementation,\nadvance action for recruiting the project implementation consultants was approved. Approval of\nsuch advance actions does not commit ADB to finance the loan.\n\n4.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n77.\nApproximately 10 person-months of international consulting services will be required to\nassist EPC in detailed engineering design, preparation of specifications and tender documents,\ntender evaluation, and construction supervision. Appendix 10 gives the broad terms of reference\nand cost estimates for these services. The Government will ensure that all consulting contracts\ncontain  appropriate  representations  and  warranties.  EPC  will  engage  a  firm  of  engineering\nconsultants,  with  experience  and  qualifications  in  hydropower  and  power  system  design  and\nimplementation,  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  The  engagement  is\nanticipated to last from February 2002 to December 2003.\n\n78.\nFour  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  will  also  be  required  for\nimproving EPC\u2019s energy loss reduction and maintenance management under the proposed ADB\nTA.  The  consultants  for  the  TA    will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants. The TA will commence in February 2002 and will be completed in October\n2002.\n\n\f2121\n\n5.\n\nDisbursements\n\nThe  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan Disbursement Handbook\n79.\ndated January 2001, as amended from time to time. EPC will award the project implementation-\nrelated consulting services contract by February 2002. Preparation of specifications and tender\ndocuments, tender evaluation, and award of the turnkey contract are expected to be completed\nby  October  2002.  Construction  will  begin  within  one  month  of  contract  award  if  the  weather\npermits. Direct payment procedure will be used for the turnkey contract. For the civil, electrical,\nand mechanical works, 80 percent of the loan will be disbursed in 2002 and 20 percent in 2003.\n\nFor  the  international  consulting  services  relating  to  both  project  implementation\n\n80.\nassistance and the associated TA, direct payment procedures will be used.\n\n6. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audits\n\n81.\nEPC will comply with the following reports, accounts, and audit requirements: (i) prepare\nand submit detailed quarterly project progress reports, preferably together with brief, faxed, or e-\nmailed  monthly  progress  reports  to  enhance  proactive  project  management;  (ii)  maintain  a\nseparate project account, with audited project accounts and statements submitted to ADB within\nnine months after the end of each fiscal year; and (iii) prepare and submit a project completion\nreport within three months after physical completion of the Project.\n\nH.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Measures\n\n82.\nConsidering the typical environmental issues associated with hydropower augmentation,\nthis  Project  has  been  classified  as  environmental  category  A.  An  EIA  was  prepared  by  EPC.\nSince  then,  EPC  has  again  met  with  officers  of  SPREP;  an  environmental  nongovernment\norganization,  the  Siosiomaga  Society;27  and  the  Division  of  Environment  and  Conservation\n(DEC);  and  had  other  public  meetings  with  the  Ti'avea  and  Ta\u2019elefaga  villagers.  The  EIA,  as\napproved  by  the  Government,  is  expected  before  the  effective  date.  The  summary  EIA  was\ncirculated to the Board on 19 July 2001. EPC agreed to\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\ncontinue public consultations to explain to the villagers the potential impacts, the\nproposed  mitigation  measures,  and  the  long-term  water  quality  monitoring\nprograms, and how the villagers can get involved;\n\ninstall  silencers  on  not  only  the  third  generator  but  also  the  two  existing\ngenerators to minimize noise impact; and\n\n(iii)\n\ncoordinate with DEC to implement a systematic water quality monitoring program.\n\n83.\nThe Project will upgrade existing facilities in Afulilo and increase the installed capacity of\nthe  hydropower  plant  from  4  MW  to  6  MW.  The  EIA  concludes  that  the  environmental  impact\narising  from  construction  of  the  facilities  and  subsequent  operation  under  the  Project  can  be\nmitigated  to  acceptable  levels  by  implementing  identified  mitigation  measures.  Appendix  11\n\n                                          \n27 Siosiomaga in Samoan means environment. The Siosiomaga Society is a local nongovernment organization active\n\nin protecting the environment of Samoa.\n\n\f2222\n\npresents  the  environmental  impact  management  matrix.  Government  environmental  agencies\nwere involved in preparing the EIA.\n\nThe environmental impacts of increased dam height, increased discharge, noise levels,\n\n84.\nand transmission line upgrade were assessed and mitigation measures formulated as follows:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\nThe additional inundated land (19.4 ha) as a result of increasing the water level\nby  1.7  m  is  still  within  the  fenced  area  of  land  acquired  by  the  Government  in\n1988 and consists of secondary growth.\n\nThere will be no need to open a new quarry as the existing quarries can supply\nthe required construction materials.\n\nThe  third  generator  will  increase  discharge  by  0.825  m3/sec,  i.e.,  from  1.65\nm3/sec  to  2.475  m3/sec,  which  is  still  within  the  natural  variability  of  the\nTa\u2019elefaga creek flow (the average annual peak flow of this creek is 15 m3/sec).\nAnnually,  the  Project  will  increase  the  freshwater  inflow  to  Fagaloa  Bay  by  4\npercent. The increased flow of this magnitude is not expected to cause significant\nenvironmental  impacts  on  the  bay  environment.  Nevertheless,  a  water  quality\nmonitoring program will be implemented to identify and address any unforeseen\nwater quality impact on the bay.\n\nThe  third  generator  will  increase  the  total  noise  level  from  92  decibels  audible\n(dBA) to approximately 95 dBA inside the plant. Incremental noise level expected\nfrom the Project outside the plant will be insignificant; nevertheless, silencers will\nbe installed on not only the new generator, but also the two existing generators to\nminimize noise impact.\n\nUpgrading  the  existing  transmission  line  will  not  have  adverse  impacts  since  it\nwill  be  done  within  existing  alignments,  and  will  use  the  existing  wooden  poles.\nDuring construction, EPC will keep temporary disturbance along the transmission\nroute to a minimum.\n\n85.\nThe proposed Project will provide an additional 10 GWh electricity annually. Without the\nProject, the 10 GWh electricity would have to be generated using diesel fuels. Other alternatives\nsuch  as  solar,  wind,  and  wave  energy  sources  are  not  viable.  Thus,  the  proposed  Project  will\nsubstantially  reduce  the  amounts  of  air  emissions.28  These  estimated  emission  reductions\nrepresent approximately 20 percent of the total emissions from EPC\u2019s diesel power generation.\n\n86.\nThe eastern diversion canal (7,056 m long and 1 m wide at the base and less than 3 m\nwide  at  the  top  of  the  canal)  will  need  the  acquisition  of  4.2  ha  of  customary  land  presently\nconsisting  of  bushes  and  secondary  growth;  however,  no  houses  or  people  will  be  directly\naffected. No resettlement is involved. Public consultations and meetings have been undertaken\nand EPC has obtained permission from the Ti'avea village to build the canal. The Government\nwill  take  the  necessary  steps  to  acquire  the  land  formally,  with  appropriate  compensation  to\nlandowners and users. The environmental impact of the proposed canal will still be acceptable\n\n                                          \n28 Total amounts of air emission to be avoided by the Project (based on the life cycle of the Project) are 5.7 million\ntons  nitrous  oxide,  1.2  million  tons  carbon  monoxide,  374  kg  sulfur  oxide,  401  kg  particulate  matter,  210  tons\ncarbon dioxide, and 844 kg aldehydes.\n\n\f2323\n\nsince  the  canal  will  divert  only  about  35  percent  of  the  surface  runoff  in  the  catchment  area\nduring  the  rainy  season.  To  enhance  the  positive  impact  of  the  Project,  EPC  has  coordinated\nwith  the  Samoa  Water  Authority  (SWA)  to  extend  a  water  supply  system  to  Ti'avea  village  to\ngive the approximately 200 villagers a more convenient water supply. EPC will work with SWA\nto  ensure  that  water  supply  will  be  available  to  the  village  before  civil  works  on  the  diversion\ncanal start. The cost of this measure (estimated to be $268,000) has been included as a project\ncost.\n\nEPC  will  coordinate  with  DEC  in  preparing,  implementing,  and  operating  the  Project  to\n87.\nensure that all applicable environmental laws, regulations, and guidelines will be complied with.\nEPC  has  assured  that  the  Project  will  be  implemented  in  an  environmentally  sound  manner.\nAdequate funds (as specified in the EIA) will be provided for the mitigation measures to ensure\nthat environmental impacts will be minimized to acceptable levels and will meet government as\nwell as ADB environmental requirements. EPC will recruit a full-time environmental coordinator\nbefore July 2002 who will supervise implementation of environmental mitigation measures, and\ncoordinate  environmental  management  and  monitoring  during  operation.  EPC  will  report  the\noutcome  of  environmental  monitoring  to  ADB  and  DEC  through  the  progress  reports  on\nimplementation, and an evaluation report one year after project completion.\n\n88. When  the  Afulilo  project  started  operating  in  1993,  discharged  water  from  the\npowerhouse was unusually brown and emitted a sulfuric smell in the first few years. In the past\ntwo  years,  the  smell  has  been  less  strong.  The  smell  was  detected  on  some  days  but  not  on\nothers. During project appraisal, physical and chemical analyses were done on water taken from\nthe reservoir and the tailrace. However, the smell of the discharged water was not detected in\nthe  several  weeks  prior  to  taking  the  water  samples.  Thus,  the  water  analysis  results  were\ninconclusive.  EPC  agreed  to  carry  out  a  longer  term  environmental  monitoring  program  to\nanalyze  the  quality  of  the  discharged  water.  The  water  quality  analyses  will  start  12  months\nbefore physical completion of the Project to establish the baseline conditions. EPC will perform\nwater quality analysis regularly after the Project is commissioned and will coordinate with DEC\nand Ta\u2019elefaga village on environmental monitoring. Should there be any significant changes in\nthe  quality  of  the  discharged  water,  EPC  will  work  with  DEC,  SWA,  and  the  Department  of\nHealth to develop and implement remedial measures.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Measures\n\n89.\nSeveral  social  issues  are  associated  with  the  Project.  These  issues  and  the  mitigation\nmeasures are summarized below (a summary of the effects on  poverty reduction is in Appendix\n12):\n\n(i) \n\nWater use. When built, the proposed canal will divert a maximum of 35 percent\nof the surface runoff from the catchment area during the wet season into Afulilo\nreservoir.  The  surface  runoff  would  otherwise  flow  into  the  Pacific  Ocean.  At\npresent,  there  is  no  water  supply  in  Ti'avea  village.  In  the  wet  season,  the\nvillagers  use  tanks  or  containers  to  save  rainwater  for  use.  In  the  dry  season,\nthere  is  only  one  running  stream  fed  with  spring  water.  The  villagers  use  the\nwater from this stream to supplement bottled water for drinking. To mitigate any\npotential  impact  on  the  villagers\u2019  use  of  this  stream,  EPC  will  construct  the\ndiversion canal in a way that it will not divert any water from this stream.\n\nFurther, EPC has agreed to install a new water supply system for Ti'avea village.\nThe new system will benefit the villagers. In the dry season (April-December), the\n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n2424\n\nvillagers,  particularly  children  and  women  have  to  walk  long  distances  or  pay\nST10 for a pickup truck ride to carry water in containers from the running stream\nback to the village. There were reports that, while fetching water, children fell into\nthe  stream  and  had  to  be  hospitalized.  With  the  new  water  supply  system,  the\nvillagers  will  have  a  convenient  water  supply  and  avoid  the  inconvenience  and\nrisk associated with taking water from the stream.\n\nLand  compensation.  The  proposed  diversion  canal  will  have  a  total  length  of\n7,056 m. A total of 3.5\u20134.0 ha of land required for the canal and access road is\non customary land that belongs to Ti'avea villagers. The land has grass, scrubs,\nand secondary regrowth trees. There are neither people nor permanent activities\non  this  site.  EPC  has  met  with  the  Ti'avea  village  representatives  and  obtained\ntheir  permission  to  build  the  diversion  canal.  The  Government  will  formally\nacquire the land with appropriate compensation.\n\nSafety  of  bridge  crossing.  Ta\u2019elefaga  villagers  indicated  that  the  4  m  wide\nbridge  downstream  from  the  power  station  is  frequently  flooded  during  the  wet\nseason.  To  improve  the  safety  of  the  villagers,  EPC  has  agreed  to  widen  the\ncreek  channel  and  build  a  new  bridge  sufficiently  higher  than  the  existing  one\nwith guardrails on both sides. In addition, EPC has installed a new streetlight for\nsafe use of the bridge at night.\n\n(iv)  More affordable electricity tariff for low-income consumers. EPC has agreed\nto  implement  a  lifeline  rate  to  make  electricity  tariff  more  affordable  to\napproximately  9,560  low-income  consumers.  These  poor  consumers  represent\nabout  47  percent  of  EPC\u2019s  domestic  customers,  but  only  11  percent  of  the\nresidential electrical consumption. They typically use less than 50 kWh per month\nand  will  see  their  electricity  rate  reduced  by  approximately  17  percent.  Other\nelectricity consumers can expect a more stable electricity rate from the reduced\ndiesel fuel costs as a result of the Project.\n\nImproved  electricity  services.  All  electricity  consumers  can  expect  a  more\nreliable service particularly in the dry season. In FY1999/2000, EPC had a total\nof 77 power outages. Reduced power outages will result in less disruption to the\nbusiness  of  shops,  and  operations  of  hospitals,  health  clinics,  and  educational\nfacilities.  The  low-income  villagers  use  electricity  mainly  for  lighting  during  the\nevening hours. More reliable electricity services in this period will be helpful. Also\nduring the outages, villagers use more expensive kerosene or alcohol for lighting,\nor wood fuels that generate more pollution and result in more tree cutting in the\nforest.\n\nI.\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n90.\nThe  TA  will  assist  EPC  in  strengthening  its  management  capacity    to  improve  its\nperformance  and  asset  utilization  efficiency.  The  specific  objectives  are  to  help  (i)  improve\nEPC\u2019s  maintenance  capacity  to  reduce  the  frequency  and  duration  of  power  outages  and\nmaintenance costs, and (ii) strengthen EPC's capacity to reduce energy loss in a cost-effective\nmanner. The consultants will undertake these tasks:\n\n\f2525\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nassess  EPC's  current  maintenance  practices,  make  recommendations  for\nimprovements; assess available software packages, recommend the best suited\nto EPC, install and test the software, and train the EPC staff; and\n\nreview  the  historical  energy  loss  data;  evaluate  the  DigSilent  power  software,\ncompute  the  energy  technical  losses  of  the  EPC  power  system,  estimate\nnontechnical  energy  loss,  and  develop  a  cost-effective  strategy  to  reduce  the\nsystem's total energy loss.\n\n91.\nThe TA will finance 4 person-months of international consulting services. ADB will recruit\nindividual consultants with expertise in power energy losses and maintenance management, in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is\nestimated to be $185,000 equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of $150,000. ADB will\nprovide  the  TA  as  a  grant  financed  by  the  ADB-funded  TA  Program  to  cover  the  foreign\nexchange costs. The Government/EPC will provide the remaining $35,000 through counterpart\nstaff, and office and communication costs. The details of the TA are in Appendix 13.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses\n\n92.\nThis  section  presents  the  economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  investment  being\nfinanced under the loan for the Power Sector Improvement Project. The financial projections for\nEPC and power tariffs are discussed in Chapter III and Appendix 7. Further details are available\non request.\n\n93.\nThe economic and financial analyses of the project investment for Afulilo augmentation\ncompared the benefits of the additional power generation to the total cost. In addition, a least-\ncost economic analysis was conducted to demonstrate that augmentation is less expensive than\nan alternative diesel power generation. The switching values related to the parameters used in\nthe analysis were also computed (Appendix 14).\n\nThe  economic  cost  estimates  are  based  on  May  2001  prices  and  include  base  costs,\n94.\ncosts of the environmental and social mitigation measures described earlier (paras. 82-89), and\nphysical  contingencies,  but  no  taxes  and  duties.  The  economic  benefits  were  calculated  by\nmultiplying  the  forecast  net  additional  power  generation  by  the  present  value  of  the  weighted\nresource cost savings of consumer alternative sources of energy, and consumers' willingness to\npay. The average tariff was used as a proxy for the willingness of the consumers to pay for the\nelectricity.\n\nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  base  case  is  estimated  to  be  22.0\n95.\npercent. Thus, the project proposal is economically justifiable. Based on the net present value\n(NPV)  of  total  economic  cost,  the  project  proposal  is  also  less  expensive  than  the  diesel\ngeneration alternative. At a discount rate of 12 percent, the NPV of the economic cost is $5.40\nmillion, while the NPV of the diesel alternative\u2019s cost is $8.62 million.\n\n96.\nThe Project is fully consistent with the Government\u2019s strategy for emphasizing renewable\npower  development  and  reducing  fuel  imports.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to  test  the\nrobustness  of  the  results  to  standard  changes  in  the  underlying  assumptions  (Table  8).  The\nswitching points would be if (i) benefits were 47 percent lower (equivalent to 5.3 GWh per year),\n\n\f2626\n\n(ii)  costs  were  85  percent  higher,  or  (iii)  there  would  be  more  than  five  years  delay  in\nimplementation. The Project remains viable in all cases.\n\n97.\nFor  the  financial  analysis,  financial  costs  used    include  the  economic  costs  and  duties\nand  taxes.  The  financial  analysis  was  performed  by  comparing  the  financial  cost  with  the\nbenefits  of  the  additional  power  generation.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is\nestimated to be 18 percent. The Project is financially justifiable. The FIRR also remains robust\nfor the sensitivity scenarios, as shown in Table 8.\n\nTable 8: FIRR and EIRR Sensitivity Analysis\n\nItem\n\nBase Case\nProject Capital Cost +10%\nProject Benefit \u201310%\nProject Cost +10% & Benefit \u2013 10%\nImplementation Delay by 1 year\n\nFIRR\n(percent)\n18.0\n16.3\n16.5\n14.9\n16.1\n\nSensitivity\nIndicatora\n           -\n0.94\n0.83\n\n           -\n\nEIRR\n(percent)\n22.0\n20.0\n20.2\n18.4\n19.5\n\nSensitivity\nIndicator\n\n           -\n0.91\n0.82\n\n           -\n\na Sensitivity indicator is the ratio of percentage change in the economic internal rate of return or financial\n\ninternal rate of return to percentage change in the sensitivity parameter.\n\n98.\nThe least-cost analysis indicates that the long-term marginal cost of the Project is about\n$0.07/kWh,  much  cheaper  than  the  $0.11/kWh  of  the  diesel  power  alternative.  The  switching\npoints  between  the  Project  and  the  diesel  alternative  would  be  if  (i)  project  costs  were  42\npercent higher, or (ii) diesel alternative\u2019s costs were 30 percent lower.\n\n99.\nIncrease in project cost and delay in implementation cannot be ruled out. Sensitivity to\ncurrency  devaluation  was  not  performed  as  EPC  has  agreed  to  implement  an  automatic  tariff\nadjustment  mechanism  for  currency  variations.  To  minimize  the  risks,  a  number  of  measures\nhave  been  or  will  be  taken.  A  strong  management  organization  with  a  full-time  experienced\nperson as project manager under the direction of the EPC general manager will be established.\nThe project manager will be supported by an international consultant with extensive experience.\nThe  contractors  for  civil,  electrical,  and  mechanical  works  will  be  prequalified  to  expedite  the\nselection  process.  EPC  will  comply  with  the  project  reports,  and  accounts  and  audit\nrequirements (para. 81).\n\nB.\n\nEnvironment\n\n100.\nThe  Project  will  help  EPC  reduce  air  pollutants  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions  that\nwould result from a diesel power generation alternative. The potential environmental impacts will\nbe minimized through various mitigation measures as an integrated part of the Project. EPC will\nstrengthen  its  capability  by  adding  new  staff  with  environmental  management  training  to  be\nresponsible  for  implementing  the  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  EIA  report.  EPC  will\nprovide  an  annual  budget  for  carrying  out  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring\nprogram  to  address  any  unforeseen  environmental  issues  after  project  completion.  The\nstrengthened environmental management capability at EPC will help ensure the sustainable use\nof renewable hydropower.\n\n\fC.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n2727\n\n101.\nThe Project will generate net social benefits. It will create 40-60 unskilled and semiskilled\nnew jobs and wage income mainly for local villagers during construction. As noted before, the\nnew  water  supply  system  that  SWA/EPC  will  build  as  part  of  this  Project  will  provide  a\nconvenient  water  supply  and  prevent  the  risks  and  costs  of  taking  water  from  the  stream,\nparticularly for children and women in Ti'avea village. Additionally, the Project will build a new\nbridge to improve the safety of the bridge crossing for Ta\u2019elefaga villagers, especially children\nand women. The new lifeline rate that EPC will implement will make electricity rate 17 percent\nless than the current electricity tariff for poor consumers, (approximately 9,560 consumers, or 47\npercent  of  EPC\u2019s  total  number  of  domestic  customers).  The  Project  will  substantially  improve\nthe power system's reliability, particularly in the dry season. The improved reliability will benefit\nvillagers  the  most  as  they  will  encounter  less  frequent  power  outages.  At  present,  the  rural\nareas  encounter  more  power  outages  than  do  urban  areas.  Power  outages  disrupt  the  health\ncare  provided  by  clinics  and  hospitals  and  activities  of  schools  in  the  villages.  More  reliable\nelectricity  service  will  reduce  the  need  for  villagers  to  use  other  fuels  for  lighting.  Alternative\nfuels  such  as  kerosene  and  alcohol  are  more  expensive  and  dangerous,  while  wood  fuels\ngenerate pollution and lead to more tree cutting in the forest.\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  and  EPC  have  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the\n\n102.\nstandard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i)\n\nEPC  and  the  Government  will  adopt  the  necessary  measures,  including\nimplementing  the  automatic  tariff  adjustment  to  diesel  price  and  currency\nexchange modifications, as well as tariff increases when required, to enable EPC\nto achieve and to maintain during the life of the Project\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\na minimum annual rate of return on revalued fixed net assets in operation\nof at least 4 percent in 2002, 2003, and 2004, and at least 6 percent by\n2005 and for each fiscal year thereafter;\n\na  self-financing  ratio  of  not  less  than  20  percent  of  the  five-year  moving\naverage  of  total  investment  requirements  for  its  capital  expenditure\nprogram; and\n\na  debt-service  ratio  of  not  less  than  1.3  times  the  estimated  maximum\ndebt-service requirements.\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nTo  protect  low-income  consumers,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  EPC  will\napply a lifeline tariff on domestic consumption of up to 50 kWh per month.\n\nTo  reduce  potential  delay  in  payments,  EPC  will  charge  a  penalty  of  2  percent\nper  month  on  amounts  overdue  by  more  than  30  days  after  the  payment  due\ndate. EPC will maintain its accounts receivable at less than two months of sales\nafter eliminating discounts for prompt bill payments.\n\n(iv) \n\nEPC  will  progressively  reduce  the  total  system  energy  losses  in  the  Upolu\nnetwork from the current 15 percent to less than 12 percent in five years.\n\n\f2828\n\n(vi) \n\nEPC and the Government will ensure that\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\nthe Project will be implemented in accordance with existing environmental\nlaws,  regulations,  and  standards  of  Samoa,  and  ADB\u2019s  guidelines,  in\nparticular,  ADB\u2019s  Environmental Guidelines for Selected Industrial and\nPower  Development Projects;\n\nan  environmental  monitoring  program  agreed  upon  with  ADB  to  monitor\nthe  effects  associated  with  the  increased  freshwater  outflow  from  the\nproposed  augmentation  on  the  water  quality  of  Fagaloa  Bay  will  be\nestablished not later than 31 December 2002. The outcome of monitoring\nwill be reported by EPC to ADB and DEC through the quarterly progress\nreports on implementation, and an evaluation report one year after project\ncompletion;\n\nto implement the environmental monitoring program, EPC will hire a full-\ntime  environmental  coordinator  by  31  July  2002,  with  the  annual  budget\nspecified in the environmental monitoring program;\n\nall  the  environmental  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  EIA  are\nincorporated into the project design, civil works, and other contracts and\nfollowed during project implementation, and O&M of the project facilities;\nand\n\nthe  environmental  monitoring  plan  detailed  in  EIA,  including  installing  a\nnew  water  supply  system  for  Ti'avea  village,  constructing  a  new  bridge\ncrossing  for  the  Ta'elefaga  creek,  and  implementing  the  water  quality\nmonitoring program, is fully implemented.\n\nnecessary steps are taken to acquire all lands, properties, and all rights,\neasements,  privileges,  and  approvals  pertaining  to  lands  and  properties\nnecessary for project implementation;\n\nprior to loan effectiveness, (i) the DLSE will approve the EIA; (ii) EPC will\ncommence  the  phased-out  elimination  of  the  10  percent  discount  for\nprompt payment of electricity accounts by eliminating the first 5 percent of\nthe discount; and (iii) the EPC will establish the project office;\n\nthe complete elimination of the 10 percent discount for prompt payment of\nelectricity accounts will occur by 1 January 2003;\n\nprior  to  loan  disbursement  for  civil  works  for  constructing  the  diversion\ncanal,  adequate  compensation  is  paid  to  local  communities  that  will  be\nlosing  their  rights  to  the  land  as  a  result  of  land  acquisition  by  the\nGovernment for the purpose of the Project; and\n\nno  amendments  will  be  made  to  the  Agreement  of  19  October  2001\nbetween the Independent State of Samoa and EPC on debt restructuring\nwithout the prior consent of ADB.\n\n(v) \n\nThe Government will ensure that\n\n\f2929\n\n103.\nThe Government and EPC will provide counterpart funding, satisfactory to ADB, for the\nlocal currency costs.

The  study  investigated  a  number  of  development\noptions for increasing the system's generating capacity to cope with the expected load growth\nand  dry  season  demand  and  improvement  of  the  transmission  system's  reliability.  The  study\nconcluded that the least-cost generation development plan is to augment the output from Afulilo\nhydropower station.\n\n2.\nThe recommended works for augmenting the output from Afulilo/Ta\u2019elefaga hydropower\nstation (the Project) include (i) constructing the 7.1-kilometer (km) eastern diversion channel to\nincrease  the  water  flowing  into  Afulilo  reservoir,  (ii)  raising  the  Afulilo  dam  1.7  meters  to\nincrease the regulating capacity of the reservoir, (iii) installing a third 2-megawatt generating set\nin  the  Ta\u2019elefaga  power  station,  (iv)  upgrading  the  south  coast  transmission  loop  from  22\nkilovolts (kV) to 33 kV; (v) upgrading transformer capacity of the north coast transmission loop\nfrom 6 megavolt-amperes (MVA) to 12 MVA; and (vi) upgrading the Afulilo telemetry equipment.\nThese improvements\u2013found to be technically and economically viable with only minor adverse\nenvironmental and social impacts\u2013were recommended for implementation.\n\n3.\nTo carry out these works, the Electric Power Corporation (EPC) will require the services\nof an international consulting firm experienced in engineering such works. The consultancy will\ninvolve three major stages, namely: review and detailed design, tender and award of contract,\nand supervision and construction.\n\n1.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nReview and Detailed Design (Stage 1)\n\nReview  the  technical,  environmental  and  social  impacts,  and  the  economics  of\nthe capital work items (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), and (vi) in para. 2.\n\nCarry  out  additional  investigations  including  detailed  topographic  survey,  and\ngeotechnical investigations for capital work items (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), and (vi).\n\nCheck the stability and load flow characteristics of the existing power system with\nthe  addition  of  the  third  2-MW  generator  [items  (iii)  and  (iv)]  and  recommend\nmodifications if necessary.\n\nCheck  lightning  protection  for  the  existing  two  hydro-generating  sets  in\nTa\u2019elefaga Power Station and recommend modifications if necessary.\n\nPrepare detailed design, drawings, schedule of quantities, and cost estimates of\nall capital works items (i) to (vi) in para. 1 and modifications identified under items\n(iii) and (iv), Stage 1.\n\n1  TA  2267-SAM: Institutional Support and Power Development Study for the EPC,  for  $350,000,  approved  on  27\n\n                  \n\nDecember 1994.\n\n\f2.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n3.\n\n(i) \n\n1.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n46\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nTender and Award of Contract (Stage 2)\n\nPrepare  prequalification  documents  for  contractors  to  carry  out  the  works\nincluded in item (v) of stage 1, evaluate contractors\u2019 submissions, and prepare a\nlist of suitably qualified contractors.\n\nPrepare  technical  specifications  and  tender  documentation  for  a  single  turnkey\ncontract including all capital works items and modifications designed under item\n(v), stage 1.\n\nAssist  EPC  with  the  international  tendering,  responding  to  bidders'  questions,\nevaluating the bids for construction of the works and during contract award.\n\nSupervision of Construction (Stage 3)\n\nSupervision,  contract  administration,  and  project  management  during\nconstruction.\n\n(ii)\n\nWitness performance testing and commissioning of the works.\n\nDetailed Scope of Work\n\nB.\n\n4.\n\nThe consultant will carry out the following tasks:\n\nStage 1\n\nStudy  all  existing  relevant  reports  and  data  and  be  familiar  with  all  existing\ninfrastructure  associated  with  the  capital  works  itemized  in  Section  A  for\nappropriate consideration during preparation of designs and construction.\n\nReview  and  confirm  the  findings  of  the  Hydro  Electric  Commission  Enterprises\nCorporation (HECEC) Report1/ with regard to\n\n(a)\n\nthe  hydrology  and  runoff  of  the  catchments  of  the  eastern  diversion  and\nreservoir, and\n\n(b)\n\nthe topographic and geologic suitability of the selected route.\n\nRevise  the  reservoir  area/volume  curves  using  the  latest  data  from  the  survey\ncarried out in September 2000 and optimize the crest level for the Afulilo Dam, as\nappropriate.\n\nStudy the hydraulic transients on the existing pipelines and surge tank to ensure\nthey are within the design capability of the existing structures.\n\nDetermine  the  penstock  emergency  shut-off  valve(s)  closure  time  required  to\nreduce  the  pressure  rise  in  the  penstock,  surge  tank,  and  headrace  conduit  to\nacceptable limits.\n\n1/ Afulilo Augmentation and Project Inception Report, ADB TA 2267-SAM (footnote 1), HECEC Australia Pty.

The  Upolu  generation  system,  the  largest,  comprises  11.5  megawatts\n(MW) installed hydropower plants and 12.8 MW installed diesel plants. The  hydropower  plants\ninclude  the 4 MW Afulilo long-term storage hydropower plant, and four run-of-river (ROR) hydro\nstations. The latter include a 1 MW (wet season capacity) station at Alaoa, a 1.6 MW station at\nFale-Ole-Fee, a 1.4 MW station at Samasoni, and a 3.5 MW station at Sauniatu. The capacity of\nthe ROR stations during the dry season is typically 80 percent less than during the wet season.\n\n2.\nThe Upolu system had a peak demand of 13.5 MW in 2000, compared with 2.5 MW in\nthe Savai'i system. The long-term growth of the Upolu peak power demand has averaged 5.91\npercent  per  annum  from  2.41  MW  in  1970  to  13.5  MW  in  2000.  In  the  last  decade,  the  load\ndemand has increased at a yearly rate of 5.4 percent between 1991 and 2000.\n\n3.\nThe Upolu system currently has a maximum generating capacity of 24.3 MW in the wet\nseason and 18.3 MW in the dry season. The firm capacity (the total capacity in the dry season if\nthe largest generator is out for overhaul and the second largest generator fails) is only 10.3 MW,\nless than the 13.5 MW peak demand in 2000. Without adding generation capacity, the demand\nand supply imbalance will worsen.\n\nThe  Upolu  system  combines  transmission  and  distribution  functions  together,  as  there\n4.\nare  no  dedicated  feeders  to  transfer  power  from  generation  centers  to  load  centers.  Power\ndistribution  is  by  33  kilovolts  (kV),  22  kV,  and  6.6  kV  primary  lines,  and  service  is  at  415/230\nvolts. The system is basically radial with the main load center concentrated along the northern\ncoast, mainly around the capital and western part of the island.\n\n5.\nThere  are  two  main  generation  centers:  one  at  the  load  center  in  Apia  and  based  on\ndiesel as well as ROR hydro generation, and another in the northeast of the island where there\nare  significant  hydro  resources  including  Afulilo  hydroelectric  power  scheme  and  Lalomunga\nscheme.  These  two  generation  centers  are  connected  with  a  radial  single-circuit  33  kV\ndistribution feeder (north coast feeder). The feeder is 32 kilometers (km) long and connects the\nswitchyards  at  Lalomunga  (northeast)  and  Tanugamanono  (Apia).  The  33  kV  feeder  does  not\nhave  33  kV  switchgear  and  relies  on  22  kV  switching.  The  feeder  is  connected  to  the  22-kV\ndistribution by 6 megavolt-ampere autotransformers. The feeder also supplies some load along\nthe north coast (Solosolo).\n\nIn addition to the north coast transmission line, there is a south coast transmission loop\n6.\nthat follows the Cross Island Road and South Coast Road to connect the northeast generation\ncenter  (Afulilo  hydropower)  to  the  north  coast  load  center.  This  22-kV  transmission  line\nconnecting generation and load centers is radial and therefore vulnerable to load disturbances.\nAny  outage  of  the  radial  transmission  line  connecting  the  Afulilo  hydroelectric  scheme  to  the\nload center has the potential to totally black out the system. This south coast transmission loop\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\nwill need to be upgraded to accommodate transmission of the increased power output from the\nproposed Afulilo Augmentation Project to the major load center.\n\n7.\nEnergy  losses,  defined  as  the  percentage  difference  between  gross  energy  generated\nand energy sold, have been high in the past several years. The reported total energy loss was\n15.2  percent  in  1994/95,  18.8  percent  in  1995/96,  17.1  percent  in  1997/98,  16.0  percent  in\n1998/99, and 15 percent in 1999/2000. These losses are relatively high, compared with those in\nneighboring Pacific island countries.\n\n8.\nThe  EPC  power  system  has  experienced  frequent  power  outages.  In  1995/96  ending\nJune 30, 88 power outages occurred. The number dropped down to 77 in 1997, 66 in 1998, and\n49 in 1999, respectively. In 2000, the total number of power outages went back to 77.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives\n\n9.\nThe  purpose  of  this  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  to  assist  EPC  in  strengthening  its\ntechnical management capacity so as to improve its technical performance and asset utilization\nefficiency.  The  objectives  are  (i)  to  improve  EPC\u2019s  maintenance  capacity  to  reduce  the\nfrequency and duration of power outages and maintenance costs, and (ii) to strengthen EPC\u2019s\ncapacity to reduce energy loss in a cost-effective manner.\n\nC.\n\nScope\n\n10.\n\nThe TA covers the following tasks:\n\n1. \n\nMaintenance Capacity Building\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nAssess  EPC\u2019s  current  maintenance  practices.  The  task  is  to  review\nthe  current  practices  and  procedures  of  EPC  in  maintaining  the\ngeneration  plants  and  transmission/distribution  systems  on  both  Upolu\nand  Savai'i \ntheir  strengths  and  weaknesses\ncompared with the best practices in the industry.\n\nislands,  and  assess \n\nappropriate \n\nrecommendations \n\nMake \nimproving  EPC\u2019s\nmaintenance  practices  and  procedures.  Based  on  the  results  of  task\n(i), appropriate recommendations will be developed for EPC to improve its\nto,  maintenance\nincluding,  but  not \nmaintenance  practices \nplanning,  scheduling,  parts  inventory,  asset  identification  and  data\nmanagement,  implementation,  data  and  record  keeping,  reporting,  and\ntraining.\n\nlimited \n\nfor \n\nReview  available  software  packages  for  maintaining  the  power\nsystems and their applicability to EPC, and recommend the software\npackage that is best suited to EPC. Personal computer-based software\npackages  commercially  available  will  be  reviewed;  the  applicability  to\nEPC\u2019s power system \u2013 the input, computer systems, and skills required to\nrun  the  software  evaluated;  and  the  cost  of  purchasing  and  maintaining\nthe  software  determined.  Consistent  with  the  recommendations  of  task\n(ii), this task will recommend the software package that is most suitable to\nEPC. The costs of purchasing and commissioning the software, computer\nhardware, and training requirements will also be estimated.\n\n\f2. \n\nEnergy Loss Reduction Assessment and Strategy\n\n(iv)\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n57\n\nAppendix 13, page 3\n\nInstall  and  test  the  software,  and  train  the  EPC  staff.

The  applicability,  data\nrequirements,  and  functions  of  the  version  of  the  DigSilent  power  flow\nsoftware  that  EPC  has  will  be  evaluated.  In  particular,  this  task  will\nconfirm  whether  the  software  is  suitable  for  estimating  EPC's  technical\nenergy loss.\n\nCompute the energy technical losses of the EPC power system. This\ntask will involve work with EPC staff to prepare all the physical and design\ndata of the power lines and transformers required by the software, select\nrepresentative  load  conditions,  and  use  the  software  to  estimate  the\ntechnical energy losses on an annual basis.\n\nEstimate nontechnical energy loss. Based on the reported total energy\nlosses and computed technical energy losses, this task will compute the\nnontechnical energy losses. It will also involve interviewing EPC customer\nservice and field personnel to identify the sources of nontechnical energy\nlosses and their solutions.\n\nfor  reducing \n\nDevelop  cost-effective  strategy  to  reduce  the  system  total  energy\nloss.  This  task  will  develop  cost-effective  strategy  to  reduce  the  system\ntotal  energy  losses  (including  both  technical  and  non-technical  energy\nlosses) to less than 12 percent in five years. Economic analysis of various\nloss  will  be\noptions \nconducted,  and  the  options  prioritized  based  on  their  cost-effectiveness.\nThe economic analysis will be based on the life-cycle costs of the options,\nincluding the capital cost and recurring operation and maintenance costs.\nOnly  the  options  with  a  benefit-to-cost  ratio  greater  than  one  will  be\nconsidered.  A  list  of  cost-effective  actions  for  EPC  to  reduce  its  total\nsystem  energy \nthan  12  percent  by  2006  will  be\nrecommended.\n\ntechnical  and  nontechnical \n\nloss \n\nless \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 13, page 4\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\nTable A13 gives the estimated costs and financing plan.

In  addition,  a  least-cost\neconomic  analysis  was  conducted  to  demonstrate  that  the  Project  is  less  expensive  than  the\nalternative  diesel  generation.  The  switching  values  related  to  key  parameters  of  the  economic\nas well as least-cost analysis were also calculated.\n\nB. \n\nMethodologies\n\n2.\nIn the economic and financial analyses, the benefits of the Project are estimated based\non  the  additional  power  generation  throughout  the  project  life.  All  the  costs  are  expressed  in\n2001  terms.  The  financial  benefits  were  computed  by  multiplying  the  forecast  net  generation\n(after  adjustment  of  energy  loss)  by  the  average  system  tariff    in  present  value  of  cents  per\nkilowatt-hour (kWh) in each year of the project life. The current average electric tariffs are used\nin evaluating the financial benefits.\n\nThe  Project  is  designed  to  meet  a  combination  of  nonincremental  and  incremental\n3.\ndemand. The economic benefits were calculated based on a per-unit weighted average of the\ntwo  demands  (nonincremental  and  incremental).  For  estimating  incremental  benefits,  the\ncurrent average tariff was used as a proxy for the consumers' willingness to pay for electricity.1\nThe nonincremental benefits are estimated as resource cost savings on the existing alternative\nsources  of  energy.  For  this  estimation,  the  assumptions  used  follow:  (i)  domestic  and  small\ncommercial customers account for approximately 60 percent of the Electric Power Corporation\n(EPC)'s  total  electricity  sales  and  their  main  use  for  electricity  is  lighting;  (ii)  the  alternative\nsource  of  lighting  is  kerosene,  which  costs  ST1.38  per  liter,  or  $0.4237  per  liter;  and  (iii)  the\nequivalent  conversion  rate  is  0.6  liter  per  kWh.  Thus,  the  economic  cost  of  kerosene  fuel  is\nestimated  to  be  $0.2542  per  kWh.  Adding  5  percent  to  account  for  owning  and  maintaining\nkerosene lamps, the total economic cost of kerosene is $0.2669 per kWh.\n\n4.\n Industrial and medium-size and large commercial customers account for the remaining\n40  percent  of  EPC's  electricity  sales.  The  alternative  source  of  energy  for  these  customers  is\nsmall  diesel  engines  (1\u20133  kW).  The  fuel  costs  $0.385  per  liter,  and  the  conversion  rate  is  3.8\nkWh per liter. Thus, the economic fuel cost is $0.1013 per kWh. The capital, annual operation\nand maintenance (O&M) costs of the small diesel engines is assumed to be 30 percent of the\nfuel costs.2 Thus, the total economic cost of this alternative source of energy is $0.1317/kWh.\n\nThe  weighted  average  economic  cost  of  an  alternative  source  of  energy  is  $0.2022\n5.\n/kWh,  which  reflects  a  0.953  conversion  factor  for  tradable  costs.  The  proposed  Project  is\ndesigned to meet a combination of incremental and nonincremental demand with an assumed\nsplit of 50/50. Thus, the overall weighted unit economic benefit of the Project will be 50 percent\nof  the  willingness  to  pay  (=$0.184/kWh  x  0.9  (conversion  factor))  plus  50  percent  of  the\n\n                  \n\n1 The average tariff was used as a proxy for the consumers' willingness to pay for electricity. This is a conservative\n\nassumption as the consumer surplus associated with electricity use was not included.\n\n2 This is also a conservative assumption as the generators would  be run infrequently, the total output (kWh) would be\n\nsmall,  and the unit production cost ($/kWh) would be high.\n\n3  The conversion factor equal to 0.95 reflects the shadow price of imported goods (kerosene lamps, kerosene, etc.)\n\nand the shadow price of local transport.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 14, page 2\n\neconomic  cost  of  consumers'  alternative  sources  of  energy  (=$0.2022/kWh), \n$0.1839/kWh.\n\nthat \n\nis\n\n6.\nIn  the  least-cost  analysis  of  the  Project  against  an  alternative  of  diesel  generation,  the\ntotal  life-cycle  costs  of  the  Project  and  the  alternative  were  used.  The  total  life-cycle  costs\nincluded  all  the  capital  costs,  O&M,  and  mitigation  costs  throughout  their  respective  lives.  For\nthe  Project,  the  costs  of  all  mitigating  measures  included  the  building  of  a  new  water  supply\nsystem and a new bridge, land compensation, and environmental monitoring programs.\n\nC. \n\nCost Assumptions\n\n1. \n\nProject Costs\n\n7.\nThe  costs  used  in  the  analysis  were  the  Project  total  life-cycle  costs  including  all  the\ncapital and O&M costs expressed in 2001 terms. The capital cost for the financial internal rate of\nreturn (FIRR) was estimated after deducting interest during construction and price contingencies\nfrom the total project cost of $7.50 million (Appendix 8 gives project cost details).\n\n8.\nThe capital cost for computing the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated\nafter deducting taxes and duties from the financial capital cost and converting local nontradable\ncosts to border prices at a standard conversion factor of 0.80.4 The resulting total economic cost\nof the Project was estimated at $5.67 million.\n\n9.\nThe Project was assumed to have an economic life of 30 years with no residual value at\nthe end of the period. The schedule of disbursement was assumed to be 80 percent in the first\nyear and 20 percent in the second year. The O&M costs were assumed to be 1 percent of the\ncapital costs of the Project in each year of its economic life.\n\nThe  economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  Project  included  an  allowance  for  system\n10.\ntransmission  and  distribution  loss  that  is  assumed  to  be  reduced  to  12  percent  by  2006.\nBecause  the  project  cost  already  includes  $2.2  million  for  project-related  transmission,  no\nadditional cost of other system transmission and distribution development is considered.\n\n2. \n\nDiesel Generation Alternative Costs\n\n11.\nThe capital cost of diesel generation is estimated at $670 per kW installed. FY2000 fuel\nprices  for  alternative  diesel  power  plant  were  based  on  the  forecast  fuel  prices  including  local\ntransportation  costs.  In  the  EIRR  analysis,  local  transportation  and  handling  costs  were\nconverted to border terms by excluding taxes and duties and by applying a standard conversion\nfactor  of  0.8.  Fuel  efficiency  was  assumed  to  be  3.8  kWh  per  liter  of  diesel  oil,  the  EPC  fuel\nefficiency  target  for  2001.  The  economic  life  of  the  diesel  generator  was  assumed  to  be  15\nyears.\n\nD. \n\nResults of Least-Cost Analysis\n\n12. \nThe  least-cost  analysis  result  shows  an  economic  equalizing  discount  rate  of  14.6\npercent (Table A14.1). At a discount rate of 12 percent, the long-term marginal cost of the kWh\nproduced by the Project was computed to be $0.07/kWh against $0.11/kWh by the alternative\n\n                  \n\n4  The  conversion  factor  equal  to  0.80  reflects  the  weighted  average  between  local  unskilled-semiskilled  labor  cost\n\nwith a conversion factor lower than 0.60 and imported materials with a conversion factor higher than 0.95.\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 14, page 3\n\ndiesel  power  plant.  The  switching  points  between  the  Project  and  the  equivalent  diesel\nalternative  would  be  if  (i)  project  costs  were  42  percent  higher,  or  (ii)  the  diesel  alternative\u2019s\ncosts were 30 percent lower.\n\nE. \n\nResults of Financial and Economic Evaluation\n\n13.\nThe FIRR for the Project for the base case was estimated at 18.0 percent in real terms\n(Table A14.2). This compares satisfactorily with the real weighted average cost of capital of 2.8\npercent  for  the  Project.5  The  EIRR  for  the  project  for  the  base  case  was  estimated  at  22.0\npercent in real terms (Table A14.3), which is above the normative 12 percent opportunity cost of\ncapital for Samoa.\n\nSensitivity analyses for FIRR and EIRR shown6 in Tables A14.4 and A14.5 demonstrate\n14.\nthat  the  Project  is  robust  and  remains  financially  and  economically  viable  even  with  adverse\nmovements  in  some  parameters  such  as  lower  project  benefits,  increase  in  capital  cost,  and\ndelay in project implementation.\n\n                  \n\n5  The  Project  will  be  financed  80  percent  by  debt-carrying  interest  rate  of    5.0  percent  in  nominal  terms,  i.e.,  2.5\npercent in real terms, after allowing for long-term annual inflation of 2.5 percent. The remaining 20 percent financed\nfrom internal resources is assumed to have a return  in real terms of 4.0 percent. The weighted average cost of\ncapital for the Project works out to be 2.8 percent in real terms.\n\n6  Exchange rate variations will change the cost of the imported components of the capital cost. Thus, sensitivity on\n\nexchange rate variations are reflected in the sensitivity analysis to the capital cost increase.\n\n\fTable A14.1: Financial Equalizing Discount Rate\n\nAlternative Diesel
