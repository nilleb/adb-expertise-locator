The good economic performance is attributed in part to the\nsuccessful  program  of  economic  and  financial  reform  and  good\ngovernance that is boosting private sector activities.\nThe  power  supply  is  becoming  a  constraint  to  the  country's\neconomic and social development. The Project involves support to\nthe Government to deal with the constraint through policy changes,\ninstitutional  capacity  building,  investments  in  power  supply\naugmentation, and expansion of distribution networks as well as\nenvironmental  improvement  and  social  services  for  the  affected\ncommunities.\nThe events of 11 September 2001 are expected to slow down the\neconomic growth and electricity consumption in Samoa in the short\nterm. Thus, it becomes more important to substitute indigenous,\nrenewable,  and  cheaper  sources  of  energy  for  imported  oil\ndistillates. The substitution is also required to prepare the economy\nfor higher growth.\nClassification Thematic: Economic growth\nEnvironmental Category A. A summary environmental impact assessment (EIA)\nAssessment was circulated to the Board on 19 July 2001.\nRationale The basic rationale of the Project lies in the need to improve the\ncapacity of the Electric Power Corporation (EPC) and increasingly\ncommercialize its operation to meet the growing power demand in\nSamoa with the use of renewable resources and in a least-cost\nmanner.  The  Government's  energy  policy  aims  to  reduce\ndependence on imported fuel by developing indigenous renewable\nenergy sources, and meeting the demand for electricity with a high\nlevel  of  reliability.  The  proposed  Project  is  consistent  with  this\npolicy, as it will develop hydro energy resources in place of new\ndiesel-generated energy capacity. EPC's corporate plan stresses\nthe  aim  of  more  accountability,  transparency,  cost-effectiveness,\nand  efficiency.  Technical  assistance  (TA)  will  be  provided  to\nstrengthen EPC's capability to reduce energy losses and operate\nefficiently.\nObjectives and Scope The main objective of the Project is to assist the Government and\nEPC to undertake necessary policy changes, increase efficiency\nand viability throughout the power sector, and undertake the highest\npriority investment to augment the Afulilo hydropower scheme, in", "iiii\nsupport of the country's energy sector development plan. In addition\nto the loan and the associated TA, power sector improvements will\nbe  fostered  by  continuing  the  long-term  policy  dialogue  and\nimplementing the specific Government assurances in conjunction\nwith the loan.\nThe investment part of the Project includes the following:\n(i)  increasing Afulilo reservoir volume by 50 percent to\n15 million cubic meters;\n(ii)  installing  a  third  2-megawatt  (MW)  generator\nidentical  to  the  two  existing  2-MW  generators  in\nTa'elefaga power station;\n(iii)  constructing a 7.1-kilometer gravity diversion canal;\n(iv)  upgrading the south coast transmission loop from 22\nkilovolts (kV) to 33 kV;\n(v)  expanding the transformer capacity of the north coast\ntransmission loop from 6 megavolt-amperes (MVA)\nto 12 MVA;\n(vi)  upgrading  the  telemetry  system  of  the  Afulilo\nhydropower scheme;\n(vii)  implementing  several  environmental  management\nmeasures; and\n(viii)  providing consulting services.\nCost Estimates The Project is estimated to cost $7.5 million equivalent, including\n$6.0 million in foreign exchange cost.\n($ million)\nFinancing Plan Source of Foreign Local\nFinancing Exchange Currency Total Percent\nADB Loan 6.0 0.0 6.0 80\nEPC/Govt 0.0 1.5 1.5 20\n    Total 6.0 1.5 7.5       100\nADB = Asian Development Bank, EPC = Electric Power Corporation.\nLoan Amount and The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a loan in various\nTerms currencies equivalent to SDR 4.695 million ($6 million equivalent)\nfrom its Special Funds resources. The loan will have a repayment\nperiod of 32  years, including a  grace period of 8 years, and a\ncharge of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent per annum thereafter.", "iiiiii\nAllocation and The Borrower will relend to EPC the proceeds of the ADB loan,\nRelending Terms denominated in Samoan tala, at a minimum interest rate of 5.0\npercent per year and with a repayment period of 25 years, including\na grace period of 5 years. The foreign exchange risk will be borne\nby the Government.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2004\nExecuting Agency The Executing Agency for the Project will be EPC.\nImplementation International consultants will assist EPC to implement the Project. A\nArrangements turnkey contract will be used to select a contractor to complete the\ncivil, electrical, and mechanical works.\nProcurement Procurement of all goods and services to be financed under the\nproposed  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. The bid package will be structured to\nmake it suitable for a turnkey contract to include all civil, electrical,\nand mechanical works through international competitive bidding.\nConsulting Services A  total  of  about  10  person-months  of  international  consulting\nservices  will  be  required  during  Project  implementation  for\nprocurement,  preparation  of  construction  drawings,  management\nand general supervision of works, and training for EPC staff.\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date 31 December 2003\nProject Benefits and The Project was evaluated for the investment elements relating to\nBeneficiaries the Afulilo power augmentation and transmission line upgrade  and\nwas compared with the cost EPC would incur by installing  and\noperating a diesel power plant (the least expensive alternative). The\nanalysis indicates that the Project is less expensive than diesel\npower generation, with a switching rate of 18.0 percent.\nThe financial viability of the Project was assessed on the basis of\nthe financial internal rate of return (FIRR). The FIRR for the Project\nis estimated to be 18.0 percent. The economic  internal rate of\nreturn (EIRR) is estimated at 22.0 percent. Thus, the Project is both\neconomically and financially viable.\nResidential, industrial, commercial, and agricultural consumers in\nSamoa  will  directly  benefit  from  the  more  economical  electricity\ngenerated by the Project. The Project will also result in reduced load\nshedding  and  fewer  power  supply  interruptions.  Other  benefits\ninclude i) employment opportunities for unskilled and semi-skilled\nlabor during Project construction; ii) making electricity more reliable\nand, through a lifeline rate, affordable to the poor; (iii) providing a\nmore convenient water supply to the affected villagers (a new water\nsupply  system  will  be  built  as  one  of  the  environmental\nmanagement measures under the Project); and (iv) reducing air", "iivv\npollutants and greenhouse gas emissions.\nTechnical Assistance A  TA  grant  ($150,000)  to  the  Government  is  envisaged  for\nstrengthening  EPC's  technical  management  capacity  so  as  to\nimprove its technical performance on asset utilization efficiency. The\nobjectives are to achieve energy loss reduction and enhance EPC's\nmaintenance management capacity (including outsourcing to the\nprivate sector). The TA funding will come from the ADB-financed TA\nProgram.", "vv", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Independent State of Samoa for the Power Sector Improvement Project.1 The report\nalso describes proposed technical assistance for Strengthening Energy Loss Reduction and\nMaintenance  Management  Capacity  of  the  Electric  Power  Corporation  (EPC),  and  if  the\nproposed loan is approved by the Board, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the\nBoard, shall approve the technical assistance.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. Energy development is an important element of the Government strategy for economic\ngrowth and social development in Samoa. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided\nassistance  for  energy  sector  development,  the  power  subsector  in  particular,  since  1971.\nStarting with the first technical assistance (TA) in 1971, ADB has provided 12 TAs and seven\nloans for power sector development (para. 27). EPC was corporatized in 1972 in the course of\nADB's first power development loan to Samoa. Institutional strengthening and policy reforms,\ntariff and revenue studies, commercialization and  improvement of the financial management of\nthe  EPC  have  been  important  areas  of  ADB  involvement,  with  the  long-term  objective  of\npreparing the utility for eventual privatization.\n3. ADB approved a loan for the Afulilo Hydroelectric Power Project in December 1986 for\nthe amount of $5.4 million.2 The project was cofinanced by the World Bank, European Union\n(EU),  European  Investment  Bank  (EIB),  and  the  Australian  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment (AusAID). In April 1993, ADB approved supplementary financing3 to meet the\nestimated cost overrun of SDR 1.457 million ($2.0 million equivalent at the time).4 The project\nwas successfully commissioned in June 1993. Its major objectives were met and, despite the\ncost and time overruns in implementation, it was economically and financially viable.5\n4. In  December  1994,  ADB  approved  a  TA  for  preparing  a  project  for  institutional\nstrengthening of EPC and increased electricity supply by augmenting Afulilo power. The South\nPacific  Regional  Environment  Programme  (SPREP)  prepared  a  preliminary  environmental\nimpact assessment (EIA) report, but the project could not proceed due to poor EPC financial\nconditions that could not guarantee project sustainability. ADB financed another small-scale TA6\nto update the project costs and the EIA in June 1999 when the policy dialogue was considered\nback on track.\n5. The proposed Project is designed to support the Government and EPC in undertaking\nfurther policy reforms and capacity building to ensure that EPC continues to evolve toward full\nprivate sector orientation, and in undertaking the highest priority investment of augmenting the\nAfulilo power supply. The investment element of the Project is an integral part of the least-cost\ndevelopment plan for the power sector, and receives highest priority from the Government.

If approved, the\nproposed loan will be ADB's 8th power sector loan to Samoa and the 29th ADB loan to the\ncountry.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n1.  Overview\n6. The  energy  sector  in  Samoa  had  traditionally  been  dominated  by  consumption  of\nindigenous biomass\u2013wood fuel and coconut residues\u2013for domestic cooking and crop drying. In\nthe 1990s, Samoa underwent a rapid transformation toward use of a commercial energy supply\nbased on imported petroleum and hydro-generated electricity. The transformation was driven\nprimarily by increasing demand for fossil fuel energy in transportation, including ground and sea\ntransportation, particularly fish transport. No hydrocarbon deposits have been found in Samoa.\nAlthough a small geothermal resource has been located, it is too remote from population\ncenters to be utilized. The more expensive solar energy is limited to water heating and some\nphotovoltaic systems  on the smaller islands. Wind and wave energy are not a viable option due\nto potential storm damage.\n7. In 1989, biomass accounted for nearly 60 percent of primary energy supply, defined as\nthe gross energy available prior to any conversions. Diesel fuel and petrol accounted for 16 and\n10  percent,  respectively,  and  hydroelectricity,  5  percent.  By  1998,  diesel  fuel  and  petrol\naccounted for 22 and 17 percent of the primary energy supply respectively; hydroelectricity\nincreased to 7 percent, while biomass declined to less than 50 percent. A rapid increase in\ndemand for transportation, especially in 1997 and 1998, combined with increased requirements\nfor diesel power generation substantially raised the level of petroleum imports. It is expected\nthat the demand for diesel, petrol, and electricity in the next 10 years will further increase\nrelative to biomass. Transport-related fuels will account for 50 percent of the primary energy\nsupply  by  2008,  compared  with  34  percent  in  1989.8  As  demand  for  petroleum  products\ncontinues to increase, the weight of petroleum external accounts is likely to rise in the medium\nand long term, making the country vulnerable to the rapid price increases of petroleum products.\n8. The trends of the primary energy supply are driven by the final energy consumption\npattern. Commercial energy consumption has grown substantially over the last 10 years while\nthe traditional or noncash energy consumption has declined. Transport recorded the biggest\nshare, increasing its final energy consumption from 28 percent in 1989 to 36 percent in 1998. In\nthe same period, the share of electricity increased from about 9 percent to 13 percent of total\nenergy consumption. Diesel was the primary fuel for generating electricity in that period.\n                                          \n7 The Appraisal Mission comprised L. Bodda, Project Economist, as Mission Leader; and M. Cheng, Financial\nAnalyst/Institutional Expert, Staff Consultant.\n8 These data are extracted from the report Samoa Energy Sector Overview and Policy Recommendations, February\n1999, prepared under TA 2985-SAM: Strengthening Capacity for Macroeconomic Analysis, Plans, and Policy\nFormulation (Phase III), for $960,000, approved on 2 February 1998.", "33\n2.  Power Demand\n9. From 1989 to 1998, the domestic sector substantially increased its share of energy\nconsumption in the form of electricity, due to the Government\u2019s program for rural electrification.\nThe 1997 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES)9 indicated that 91 percent of the\nhouseholds in Samoa used electricity for lighting, compared with less than 9 percent using gas\nor  kerosene.  In  contrast,  only  2.6  percent  of  the  households  used  electricity  for  cooking.\nBiomass dominated as a cooking fuel (74 percent). Even though it is cheaper than electricity for\ncooking and easier to use than wood, propane gas use was only 8.3 percent.\n10. The commercial sector represented the largest consumer group, accounting for 42.4\npercent of the total electricity consumption in Samoa during 1991\u20132000. The domestic sector\nwas the second largest, representing 36 percent of consumption. The third largest group was\nthe religious and school facilities, accounting for 9.4 percent, followed by industry (7.2 percent),\nhotels (3.5 percent), and streetlights (1.5 percent). A simple head count gave the total number\nof electricity consumers in 2000 as 22,093. Of this, 92 percent were domestic consumers\n(20,344 customers). Commercial consumers accounted for 4.5 percent (986 customers), with\nhotels, industrial, religious and school facilities accounting for the remaining 3.5 percent.\n11. Major power demand exists on the two main islands of Upolu and Savai'i. Upolu, where\nthe Afulilo hydropower scheme is located, had a peak demand of 13.5 megawatts (MW) in\n2000, compared with the 2.5 MW peak demand in Savai'i. The demand on Manono Island was\nless than 100 kilowatts (kW) and that on Apolima Island was less than 25 kW. The long-term\ngrowth of the Upolu peak power demand has averaged 5.9 percent per annum, from 2.41 MW\nin 1970 to 13.5 MW in 2000. The load demand increased at an annual rate of 5.4 percent\nbetween 1991 and 2000. This trend is expected to continue, with the electricity demand in Upolu\nto increase by an average of at least 4 percent a year in the next decade. Most of the growth is\nanticipated to be in the commercial and domestic sectors (Appendix 2).\n3.  Power Supply\n12. EPC is responsible for providing power supply for the islands of Upolu, Savai'i, Manono,\nand  Apolima.  The  Upolu  generation  system,  the  largest,  comprises  11.5  MW  installed\nhydropower plants, and 12.8 MW installed diesel plants. The hydropower plants include the 4\nMW Afulilo long-term storage hydropower plant, and four run-of-river (ROR) hydro stations. The\nlatter include a 1.0 MW (wet season capacity) station, a 1.6 MW station, a 1.4 MW station, and\na 3.5 MW station. The capacity of the ROR stations in the dry season is typically 80 percent less\nthan that in the wet season. Much of the 12.8 MW diesel plant is derated due to age and\nmechanical restrictions and will be retired progressively in the near future. Also, due to the\nreduced  hydropower  generation  capacity  in  the  dry  season,  except  for  the  Afulilo  storage\nscheme, additional firm energy capacity is required in the Upolu power system. To summarize,\nthe Upolu system currently has a maximum generating capacity of 24.3 MW in the wet season\nand 18.3 MW in the dry season. The firm capacity10 is only 10.3 MW, which is less than the 13.5\nMW peak demand in 2000 (Appendix 3). Without additional generation capacity, the demand\n                                          \n9  Samoa HIES Tabulation Report.

EPC Organization and Power System\n13. EPC was formed during ADB\u2019s first power development loan to Samoa, which financed\nnew diesel capacity and extended the distribution network in Upolu and Savai'i. EPC was\nestablished as a corporation under the Electric Power Corporation Act of 1972 and is wholly\nowned by the Government. It is governed by a board chaired by the minister of works. Other\nboard members represent consumers, educational bodies, commercial  and religious groups,\nand the EPC general manager. Prior to 1972, the power sector had been a department of public\nworks, which operated one small ROR hydropower station at Alaoa near Apia with a capacity of\n1 MW in the wet season and 200 kW in the dry season, and another diesel station in Upolu.\n14. In the last three decades, ADB has assisted EPC to supply the growing demand and to\nbecome more efficient as well as more commercially oriented (para. 27). However, the full-scale\nprivatization of EPC is not on the Government agenda in the short and medium term. The main\nreasons follow:\n(i)  Privatization of electrical utilities in remote islands is not easy. Smallness of the\nmarket, lack of skills, expensive logistics, need to supply rural areas, etc., are\nreal constraints to private sector investment.\n(ii)  Power supply in Samoa is a monopoly. Before privatizing EPC, Samoa needs\nadditional regulatory reform\u2013and a regulatory body\u2013to define the tariff setup, as\nwell as establish clear and transparent rules for accountability. The regulatory\nframework must also consider that electricity is pervasive and influences all other\nsectors, and a minimum of electricity supply is a basic need.\n(iii)  The policy objectives for the energy sector are to meet the growing demand by\nmaximizing the use of renewable indigenous resources, including hydropower,\nand minimizing the import of fuel. These objectives are hard to achieve through\nthe  private  sector.  Renewable  energy  resources  are  characterized  by  high\ninvestment costs and deferred returns.\n(iv)  The Government\u2013with ADB assistance\u2013is implementing a privatization program.\nPrivatization has been part of the Government policy agenda since 1986, and\nsince  1986  ADB  has  been  assisting  the  Government  in  progressively\nimplementing  this  effort  in  a  logical  step-wise  fashion  (paras.  20-26).  EPC\nprivatization has not been identified as a priority.\n(v)  Under current regulations, other entities are allowed to generate and distribute\npower, under license from EPC. However, there is no such entity at present.\nFirms and individuals may own and operate backup generators for their own use\nwhen the public supply is not available. Ownership of backup generators by large\npower consumers such as hotels is common.\n15. The Upolu system combines transmission and distribution functions together as there\nare no dedicated feeders to transfer power from generation centers to load centers. Power\ndistribution is by 33-kilovolt (kV), 22 kV, and 6.6 kV primary lines, and service is at 415/230", "55\nvolts. The system is basically radial with the main load centers concentrated along the northern\ncoast\u2013mainly around Apia, the capital\u2013and the western part of the island.\n16. There are two main generation centers. One is located at the load center in Apia and\nbased on diesel as well as ROR hydropower generation. The second generation center is\nlocated in the northeast of the island where there are significant hydropower resources including\nthe Afulilo hydroelectric power scheme and Lalomunga scheme. These two generation centers\nare connected with a radial single circuit 33 kV distribution feeder (north coast feeder). The\nfeeder is 32 kilometers (km) long and connects the switchyards at Lalomunga (northeast) and\nTanugamanono (Apia). The 33 kV feeder does not have a 33 kV switchgear and relies on a 22\nkV switchgear with the possibility of exceeding the capacity of the equipment in the peak\nperiods. The feeder also supplies some load (in Solosolo) along the north coast. The feeder is\nconnected to the 22 kV distribution by 6 megavolt-ampere (MVA) auto-transformers.\n17. In addition to the north coast transmission line, there is a south coast transmission loop\nthat follows the Cross Island Road and South Coast Road to connect the northeast generation\ncenter  (Afulilo  hydropower)  to  the  north  coast  load  center.  This  22  kV  transmission  line\nconnecting generation and load centers is radial and therefore vulnerable to load disturbances.\nAny outage of the radial transmission line connecting the Afulilo power scheme to the load\ncenter has the potential to totally black out the system. The capacity of the south transmission\nloop needs to be upgraded to allow transmission of the increased power output from the\nproposed Project to the major load center in Apia.\n18. Under the rural electrification program started in the early 1990s, EPC built distribution\nextensions to rural villages extensively. By the end of 2000, EPC had provided access to\nelectricity  for  approximately  94  percent  of  Samoa\u2019s  population.  After  these  projects  were\ncompleted, the Government reimbursed the initial costs of the rural electrification projects to\nEPC. EPC is responsible for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the rural electrification\nprojects.\n19. The  energy  losses,  defined  as  the  percentage  difference  between  gross  energy\ngenerated and energy sold, were 15.2 percent in FY1994/95, 18.8 percent in FY1995/96, 17.1\npercent in FY1997/98, 16.0 percent in FY1998/99, and 15 percent in FY1999/2000. These loss\npercentages are high. A number of technical and nontechnical factors contribute to the high\nlosses  in  EPC\u2019s  system.  A  1998  tariff  study  recommended  that  12  percent  would  be  an\nappropriate target for EPC to reduce its energy loss.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n1. Overview\n20. The Government has continued its program of economic and financial reforms aimed at\nstrengthening the economic base of the country. It has liberalized and reformed the financial\nsector to facilitate private investment. This is consistent with ADB's own Pacific strategy,11 which\nemphasizes the need to remove impediments to private sector growth as a priority in countries\nrelatively well-endowed with natural resources such as Samoa. The benefits of this reform are\nnow reflected in the country's economic performance. From a low of 1 percent in 1997, growth\nin the economy (GDP) accelerated to 3.4 percent in 1998 and 5.6 percent in 1999. In 2000,\n                                          \n11 Office of Pacific Operations. A Pacific Strategy for the New Millennium, Manila, March 2000.", "66\neconomic growth exceeded 7 percent. The construction industry was a major driving force\nbehind  the  strong  performance,  with  commerce,  transport,  communications,  finance,  and\nbusiness service sectors significantly contributing to the growth.\n21. Over the past few years, Samoa has refocused its reform policies on promoting private\nsector  development  and  reducing  the  dominance  of  the  public  sector.  Good  progress  in\nintroducing modern public-sector management practices has been made in a relatively short\nperiod  and  the  public  sector  has  become  more  accountable  and  transparent.  Other\nachievements include wide-ranging financial sector reforms, specifically triggered by ADB\u2019s\nFinancial  Sector  Program  Loan  (FSPL),12  and  substantial  improvements  to  an  enabling\nbusiness environment.\n22. With a remaining portfolio of 28 state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including EPC, the\npublic sector still accounts for a large part of the country\u2019s economic activities and formal\nemployment. Inadequate standards of oversight in the past have tended to exempt SOEs from\npublic scrutiny, which has led to a low degree of corporate governance and performance. To\nstrengthen the legal and institutional framework for enhanced performance and governance of\nSOEs,  and  as  required  under  the  FSPL,  the  Government  introduced  the  Public  Bodies\n(Performance and Accountability) Bill 2001 in Parliament to provide the umbrella legislative\nframework for SOEs (or Public Bodies).13 This Bill, in combination with the Companies Act 2001\nand Public Finance Management Act 2001, constitutes a significantly improved framework for\nSOE reporting and monitoring, and is expected to lead to enhanced SOE performance and\ncorporate governance.\n23. The  introduction  of  the  new  legislative  framework  represents  an  important  step  to\nimprove the enabling business environment for the private sector, and substantially enhance\nSOE performance and corporate governance. The Government acquired a new momentum to\ncarry forward the reform process in terms of commercialization and privatization.  ADB has\nassisted the implementation of the privatization strategy14 and is considering further assistance\nto  implement  the  SOE  reform  strategy  by  (i)  implementing  the  reporting,  monitoring,  and\nadvisory provisions of the new SOE legislation, including the Companies Act 2001, the Public\nFinance Management Act 2001 and the Public Bodies (Performance and Accountability) Bill\n2001; (ii) undertaking action to privatize SOEs in accordance with the Government\u2019s reform\npriorities; (iii) supporting the Government in formulating objectives and strategies for the SOEs\nthat it plans to retain over the medium term; (iv) strengthening the capacity of the Government\nto implement SOE reforms, and (v) addressing other management and governance issues in\nSOEs.\n2. Sector Policy\n24. A reliable and affordable supply of energy is essential to promote and achieve private\nsector-led economic growth. The country's energy policy aims to reduce national spending on\nthe  importation  of  petroleum  products.  Emphasis  is  on  (i)  employing  indigenous  energy\nresources  in  place  of  imports,  whenever  economically  feasible;  (ii)  promoting  energy\n                                          \n12  Loan 1608-SAM(SF): Financial Sector Program, for $7.5 million equivalent, approved on 19 February 1998.\n13 The Bill was discussed in Parliament during its August 2001 session and was referred to the Parliamentary Bill\nSelection Committee. It is expected to be resubmitted to Parliament in December 2001. The enactment of the bill\nis a condition for the second tranche release of the Financial Sector Program.\n14  TA 2728-SAM: Implementation of the Privatization Strategy, for $600,000, approved on 7 May 1997.", "77\nconservation, especially through the use of more efficient energy equipment; and (iii) monitoring\ndeliveries of imported fuel to ensure least-cost supply arrangements, consistent with the existing\noil supply agreements.\n25. Within this framework, the Government's statement of economic strategy (SES) for\n2000-2001 defines the development strategy for the power sector as follows:\nIn  the  SES  period,  emphasis  will  be  given  to  strengthening  the\ninstitutional capacity and management capability of the EPC. The Corporation is\nexpected to adopt a more commercial approach to service delivery and customer\nrelations. Improved management and financial viability will be essential if the\ncapital  investment  programs  envisaged  for  the  Corporation  are  to  yield  full\nbenefits  to  the  people.  The  Corporation  will  also  concentrate  on  providing\nmeasures to manage peak load growth.\n26. The SES includes a plan for the developing the power sector. The following are listed as\nthe main components of this plan:\ni. formulate an institutional strengthening project for EPC,\nii. introduce cost recovery measures,\niii. augment the Afulilo hydropower scheme,\niv. add/replace diesel generators,\nv. continue discussions for the hydropower scheme at Sili, and\nvi. assess the viability of the Manono submarine cable.\nParas. 32-51 describe the important actions required for developing the power sector in Samoa\nin line with the plan.\nC. External Assistance to the Power Sector\n27. ADB has been a major development partner of Samoa in the power sector. It has\nprovided the power sector with seven loans and 12 TA grants over the last 30 years. Table 1\nlists ADB's loans and TAs to the power sector, including one major TA that covered a review\nand policy recommendations for the energy sector (footnote 8).", "88\nTable 1: ADB\u2019s Assistance to the Power Sector\nAmount Date\nTitle\n($\u2019000) Approved\nProject Loans\n132-SAM(SF) Power Project 2,300 19 Jun 1973\n254-SAM(SF) Power Project (Supplementary) 1,400 18 Dec 1975\n392-SAM(SF) Second Power Project 3,450 29 Mar 1979\n752-SAM(SF) Multi-project Loan for Upolu Power 242 19 Nov 1985\nRehabilitation\n813-SAM(SF) Afulilo Hydroelectric Project 5,400   4 Dec 1986\n1019-SAM(SF) Emergency Power Rehabilitation Project 500 17 May 1990\n1228-SAM(SF) Supplementary Loan Afulilo Hydroelectric 2,000   1  Apr 1993\nProject\nSubtotal 15,292\nTechnical Assistance\n49-SAM Power Supply 66 16 Mar 1971\n91-SAM Power (including supplementary) 52 18 Dec 1975\n287-SAM Tariff Study and Revaluation of Assets 70 20 Mar 1979\n350-SAM Feasibility Study of the Fagaloa/Afulilo 348 22 Apr 1980\nHydropower Project\n580-SAM Energy Planning and Institutional Support 148 29 Dec 1983\n608-SAM Afiamalu Pump-Assisted Hydropower 250 29 Jun 1984\nProject\n828-SAM Improvement of EPC\u2019s Financial 200   4 Dec 1986\nManagement\n1303-SAM Consultancy Services Related to Western 40 30 May 1990\nSamoa Emergency Power Rehabilitation\nLoan\n1311-SAM Power System Planning Study 140   5 Jun 1990\n2267-SAM Institutional Strengthening and Power 350 27 Dec 1994\nDevelopment of EPC\n2985-SAM Strengthening Macroeconomic Policy and 950   2 Feb 1998\nPlanning Capacity (including energy\nsector review and policy\nrecommendations)\n3203-SAM Institutional Strengthening of EPC 150   9 Jun 1999\nSubtotal 2,764\n28.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, as a cofinancier of ADB, extended a\nloan amounting to $1.7 million to rehabilitate damaged hydropower generation facilities of Upolu\nisland.15 The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provided assistance to engage\nthe services of an expatriate for the manager-generation position at EPC. Australia and New\nZealand  are  providing  assistance  to  EPC  with  the  financial  controller  and  the  auditor,\nrespectively. As part of its assistance for medium-term rehabilitation and restoration works,\nJapan has committed $4.0 million for rural electrification.\n                                          \n15 Under Loan 752-SAM: Multiproject Loan, for $4.4 million, approved on 19 November 1985.", "99\nD. Lessons Learned\n29. ADB has extensive experience in the power sector in the Asian and Pacific region. The\nmajor lessons from this experience were evaluated in 1997.16 The evaluation concluded that the\nfactors crucial to successful project performance have been (i) experience and capability of the\nexecuting agency; (ii) appropriateness of technical design; (iii) timely and adequate availability\nof counterpart funding; (iv) reliability of demand and load forecasts; (v) flexible ADB intervention\nand increased supervision throughout the project cycle; (vi) adoption of geological, hydrological,\nand environmental impact investigations and abatement measures; (vii) effective application of\nO&M  standards  and  procedures;  and  (viii)  determined  implementation  of  cost  recovery\nmechanisms and tariff reforms. It was noted that close periodic monitoring of major project risks\nand  assumptions,  notably  demand  forecasts,  generating  capacity,  system  losses,  fuel  and\nelectricity  pricing,  geological  and  climatological  (e.g.,  rainfall)  conditions,  and  the  security\nsituation would improve project administration and facilitate economic and financial evaluation of\nprojects at completion and postevaluation.\n30. The overall rating of completed and postevaluated projects in the power sector indicated\nthat  79  percent  of  the  projects  were  generally  successful,  with  only  1  percent  rated  as\nunsuccessful.  A  number  of  project  objectives  had  been  substantially  met,  including  the\nfollowing:  (i)  expanding,  rehabilitating  or  upgrading  power  generation  to  meet  the  growing\ndemand for electricity; (ii) reducing dependence on imported sources by developing indigenous\nsources  of  energy;  (iii)  improving  overall  power  systems  reliability  and  efficiency;  and  (iv)\nimproving access of the poor to power. Sustaining success in the sector requires increased\nemphasis on (i) critically assessing energy demand to avoid underutilization or overcapacity of\npower supply; (ii) incorporating appropriate cost recovery and energy efficiency mechanisms on\nboth supply and demand sides; (iii) ensuring proper O&M of project facilities; (iv) considering\nenvironmental factors in energy development; and (v) improving the institutional capacity of\nenergy  entities  in  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  as  executing  and  implementing\nagencies, with a view to redefining the role of the government and enlarging the scope for\nprivate sector participation in the subsector.\n31. Another impact evaluation study of ADB assistance to the power sector was specific  to\nthe  Pacific  DMCs,  including  Samoa.17  The  1998  study  report  concluded  that  institutional\nstrength, not capital finance, is the principal constraint facing the Pacific DMC power sector.\nTherefore, technical assistance to the power sector in the Pacific DMCs should be emphasized\nand should promote: (i) improved O&M, (ii) improved standards of safety and environmental\nprotection, (iii) increased efficiency and lower costs, (iv) increased management capacity for\nboth  administration  and  planning,  (v)  improved  reporting  and  increased  transparency  of\noperations,  and  (vi)  improved  measurement  of  performance.  These  dimensions  were  all\ncarefully considered in designing this Project.\nE. ADB Sector Strategy\n32. The  ADB  energy  policy  during  the  1970s  and  1980s  focused  on  (i)  accelerated\ndevelopment  of  indigenous  resources  and  supply  augmentation,  (ii)  adoption  of  least-cost\nconsiderations in energy planning, (iii) efficiency in construction and operation of energy supply\n                                          \n16  OEO. 1997.

Impact Evaluation Study of Bank Assistance to the Power Sector in the Pacific DMCs, 26 January\n1998.", "1100\nfacilities,  (iv)  adoption  of  energy  prices  based  on  full  cost  recovery,  and  (v)  institutional\nbuilding.18\n33. More  recently,19  the  emphasis  has  shifted  toward  (i)  poverty  reduction,  by  aligning\nenergy sector projects to the three pro-poor pillars, i.e., economic growth, social development\nand good governance, and increasing access to energy for the poor; (ii) clean energy, including\nrenewable energy, by introducing or enhancing instruments for environmental mitigation and\nsupporting efforts to abate greenhouse gas; and (iii) progressive sector policies that attract\nprivate sector investment and allow governments to reduce their risks by coming out of the\nenergy business, and make market mechanisms and consumer choice possible.\n34. The proposed Project particularly addresses the issues of least-cost solution and full-\ncost recovery, supply of clean energy, support for poverty reduction, and making the energy\nbusiness attractive to the private sector.\n35. ADB has assisted the power sector for 30 years and it is timely to consider how and\nwhen  concessional  development  assistance  may  no  longer  be  necessary.  EPC  was\ncorporatized in 1972 with assistance from ADB. Policy dialogue with the Government and EPC\nsince  then  has  focused  on  its  further  commercialization  in  a  step-by-step  fashion.  In  this\nrespect, ADB's strategy focuses on (i) strengthening the institutional capacity and management\ncapability of the utility, including benchmarking EPC against other Pacific region utilities,20 (ii)\nencouraging increased engagement of the private sector, including a broader participation in the\nboard of directors of EPC, and outsourcing of nonessential functions; (iii) reducing dependence\non imported fossil fuel and protecting the corporation from external shocks associated with fuel\nprice adjustments, by implementing measures such as automatic tariff adjustments; and (iv)\nrelieving the utility's financial burden through a number of measures including tariff increase and\nrestructuring EPC's debt with the Treasury Department.\n36. In view of the long-term nature of the investments, the importance of environmental\nissues associated with the power sector, the relative size of the market, and the terms of\ncommercial loans (e.g., 11\u201312 percent annual interest rate with a five-year repayment period),\nfull privatization of the utility is not yet an acceptable option to the Government nor a desirable\nsolution for EPC, given the social and poverty reduction objectives of the Government to provide\nelectricity  to  remote  rural  areas.  ADB's  assistance  for  implementing  the  Government's\nprivatization  strategy  will  provide  a  better  understanding  of  the  required  private  sector\ninvolvement in EPC (paras. 20-23) especially in the light of many failures in privatizing energy\nutilities in other countries. ADB's objective is to move from assisting the commercialization of the\nsingle utility to assisting the whole privatization strategy of the Government and limit future\nassistance to the sector to the development of renewable energy for disadvantaged areas.\n37. The Government has requested ADB to consider further assistance to the sector along\nthe principles described in para. 36. Assistance will particularly be required in the future for\ndeveloping a hydropower project on the island of Savai'i.21 ADB and the Government are\ndiscussing different options for further involvement of the private sector with the proposed new\n                                          \n18 Asian Development Bank. 1995.

The objective is making the sector more open to private sector involvement\nand limiting ADB assistance to projects (such as renewable energy for rural electrification)\nwhere investment is unattractive to the private sector or where the objectives of the investment\nmay clash with the Government's social equity objectives. Once these objectives are achieved,\nthen ADB\u2019s involvement will be limited to the poverty reduction relationship to the energy sector.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n38. ADB has provided TAs in the areas of policies, strategies, and institutional building over\nan extended period of time (Table 1). Current discussions with the Government and EPC,\nparticularly  during  project  processing,  have  focused  on  the  following:  institutional  capacity\nbuilding, financial performance, tariffs (especially for the poor), and Government energy policy\nthat emphasizes development of indigenous renewable hydropower to replace imported fuels.\nThe dialogue has focused strongly on the institutional and financial aspects of EPC to ensure\nthe  efficient  development  of  the  power  sector  and  further  evolution  of  private  sector\ninvolvement. The essence of the dialogue, the progress already made, and the plan of actions\nagreed upon are presented here. Appendix 4 gives a list of conditionalities agreed upon through\npolicy dialogue between the Government/EPC and ADB since 1998 when ADB provided a TA\nfor energy sector review and policy recommendations and, in the course of processing the\nProject, the current status of implementation.\n1.  Institutional Capacity Building for EPC\n39. EPC\u2019s organization includes a general manager, a deputy general manager, and seven\nmanagers  responsible  for  generation,  distribution,  utilization,  engineering  development,\nfinancial/accounting, administration and Savai'i power system (Appendix 5). In the last few\nyears, EPC has become\u2013with ADB assistance\u2013commercially viable. The number of employees\nhas been reduced from over 440 in 1999 to 385 at present despite the continued load growth in\nthis period. In response to the latest SES, EPC has developed its first corporate plan for 2000\u2013\n2002.  The  plan  establishes  the  vision,  mission,  objectives,  and  management  plan  for\ntransforming EPC into a more commercially oriented corporation, and improving its financial,\ntechnical, and customer service performance.\n40. To carry out the EPC corporate plan, the EPC management developed its first business\nplan for 2000\u20132001. It set specific action plans and monitoring procedures for each of EPC\u2019s\noperation departments. The goals are to prepare EPC to operate and develop in an efficient and\ncost-effective way so that high-quality services and electricity are provided at minimum cost to\nits customers.\n41. EPC\u2019s institutional strength has improved significantly during the past three years. It has\nfilled the position of financial controller with a well-qualified expatriate professional required for\nthe job. It has installed and trained its staff on the use of a new computerized billing and\naccounting system. Accounts receivable have been in good condition. In 2000, almost 70\npercent of EPC\u2019s customers paid their bills within 10 days.\n42. As a part of the understanding reached during the processing of this loan proposal, the\nEPC management board recently implemented an automatic tariff adjustment mechanism for\ndiesel fuel price and foreign currency variations to improve its cash flow position. Based on a\ncost-benefit analysis, the management board also adopted a plan to phase out the 10 percent\ndiscount given to customers making immediate payments. EPC will charge a penalty of 2", "1122\npercent  per  month  on  amounts  overdue.  The  board  implemented  a  lifeline  rate  to  make\nelectricity more affordable to low-income consumers. EPC also set up an improved computer\nnetwork system. All these actions lay the foundation for EPC to further improve its technical,\nfinancial, and customer service performance.\n43. EPC has developed institutional capacity in implementing the Afulilo hydropower project.\nThe project was implemented under difficult conditions. Cyclone Val severely damaged the\nproject and the surrounding environment. EPC learned valuable lessons on how to cope with\nnatural disasters. This experience has enhanced EPC\u2019s ability to manage the proposed Project\neffectively.\n3. Past Financial Performance\n44. In the past, the financial condition of EPC had not been satisfactory despite the policy\nchanges required under prior ADB loans. One reason was that EPC was unable to adjust its\ntariff in a timely manner to offset the increases in costs of providing electricity services. It started\nto improve in 1999 (Table 2). In FY2000, despite the fuel price increase, the net operating cash\nflow was equal to $2.75 million.22 The measures being taken for timely tariff adjustments and\nimproved financial performance are discussed in the following sections.\nTable 2: EPC Financial Performance\n(year ending 30 June)\nItem 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000\nElectricity Sales (kWh \u2019000) (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:2)(cid:5)(cid:2) (cid:1)(cid:6)(cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:2) (cid:1)(cid:6)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:5) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:6)(cid:9)(cid:8)\nElectricity Revenues (ST \u2019000) (cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:8) (cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:6) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:10)(cid:10) (cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:5) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:5)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:12)\nNet Electricity Revenues (ST \u2019000)a (cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:7) (cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:12)(cid:11) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:7) (cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:11)(cid:7) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:6)(cid:7)\nNonelectric Revenues (ST \u2019000)b (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:11) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:9)(cid:5)(cid:9) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:8)(cid:3) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:2) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:2)(cid:6)\nCost of Electricity Sales (ST \u2019000) (cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:12)(cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:12)(cid:7) (cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:8) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:6)(cid:7)\nOperating Expenses (ST \u2019000) (cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:7)(cid:6) (cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:12)(cid:3) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:3) (cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:5) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:2)\nTotal Expenses (ST \u2019000) (cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:6)(cid:2) (cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:8)(cid:8) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:2)(cid:10) (cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:11) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:5)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:6)\nNet Operating Cash Flow (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:13) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:13) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:13) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:7) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:2)(cid:10)\nTotal operating Revenues (ST \u2019000)c (cid:1)(cid:13)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:2)(cid:5)(cid:11) (cid:1)(cid:13)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:3) (cid:1)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:10)(cid:10) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:2)(cid:6) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:13)(cid:11)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:2)(cid:3)\nNet Sales Price (ST/kWh) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:10) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:7) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:7) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:11)(cid:3) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:5)(cid:8)\nUnit Sales Cost (ST/kWh) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:7)(cid:9) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:7)(cid:5) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:6) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:6)(cid:10) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:5)\nLoss per Output (ST/kWh) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:10) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:7) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:7)(cid:2)(cid:7) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:10)(cid:7)(cid:9) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:3)\n  kWh = kilowatt-hour.\n aThe difference between electricity revenues and net electricity revenues are the Samoa Broadcasting Corporation\nlevy and discounts for prompt payment.\n bNonelectricity revenue includes interest on overdue accounts, interest on deposits, and sundry revenues.\n cThe decrease in net operating cash flow in 2000 was due to the large increase in fuel costs.\n4. Power Tariff Adjustment\n45. Appropriate  levels  and  timely  tariff  adjustments  are  essential  for  EPC  to  achieve\nsatisfactory financial performance. EPC should be able to (i) pay for all the costs of providing\nelectricity services and achieve a reasonable rate of return on capital investments, (ii) provide\nand retain net earnings that can finance a significant proportion of capital costs for system\nexpansion in the future, and (iii) operate as a financially sound enterprise that can borrow funds\n                                          \n22 The net operating cash flow is the net profit (loss) minus depreciation.", "1133\nat commercial rates for expansion. Adequate tariff levels combined with an appropriate tariff\nstructure are also necessary to send price signals to consumers on the real economic costs of\npower supply, to encourage more efficient power consumption and demand-side management\npractices.\n46. ADB's sector policy stresses that the charge for electrical power to consumers should\ncover the full cost of the service including interest costs. Tariffs should be set to cover all\noperating costs, depreciation, and interest expenses; and to produce an adequate return on\nequity. The tariffs should also provide for automatic and timely adjustments for variations in fuel\nprices and exchange rates. The tariff structure should have higher rates for peak hour and peak\nseason consumption as the costs of providing service are higher during those periods (footnote\n18).\n47. In December 1986, under the Afulilo Hydroelectric Project Loan Agreement (Loan 813,\nfootnote 2), EPC agreed to take necessary measures to produce (i) a self-financing ratio of not\nless than 20 percent of its capital expenditures based on a five-year moving average, (ii) a debt-\nservice ratio of not less than 1.3 times the estimated maximum debt-service requirements, and\n(iii) a rate of return on revalued net fixed assets of at least 5 percent by 1990 and at least 8\npercent from 1995 onward. These were not met as a result of the cost overrun caused by\ncyclones and increased operation expenses. In 1993, with the Afulilo Hydroelectric Project\nSupplementary Loan Agreement (Loan 1228, footnote 3), the targeted rates of return of 5 and 8\npercent were moved to FY1996 and FY1997, respectively. With the management actions taken\nby EPC (paras. 39-43) recently, EPC is expected to gradually improve its financial performance\nto meet its long-term debt obligations to the Government for Loans 813-SAM(SF) and 1228-\nSAM(SF).\n48. A tariff study was conducted in 1998 as part of the ongoing policy dialogue. On the basis\nof the recommendations made, the tariff was increased from ST0.43/kilowatt-hour(kWh) to\nST0.60/kWh (around $0.202/kWh) effective from September 1998.23 EPC requested more time\nto consider the tariff study\u2019s other recommendations such as changes in the tariff structure for\nlarge consumers and an automatic adjustment to the tariff. These are included as covenants for\nthis Project. Appendix 6 shows the current status of compliance with ADB\u2019s loan covenants.\n49. EPC\u2019s tariff was increased progressively. The tariff was ST0.15/kWh ($0.145/kWh) in\n1980 and was raised to 0.40 ST/kWh ($0.173/kWh) in 1990, ST0.43/kWh ($0.167/kWh) in 1993,\nand ST0.60/kWh ($0.202/kWh) in September 1998. Table 3 shows the changes of the annual\naverage electricity tariff in Samoa since 1985.\nTable 3: Annual Average Electricity Tariff in Samoa (ST/kWh)\nItem 1985 1990 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000\nNominal 0.23 0.40 0.43 0.43 0.43 0.47 0.60 0.60\nReal 0.47 0.55 0.50 0.48 0.44 0.48 0.61 0.60\n50. In 2000, EPC took the initiative with Samoa Treasury Department to restructure its debts\nand arrears to the Government. On 28 February 2001, the Cabinet approved the restructuring of\nEPC debts to the Treasury Department. Under the agreement of 19 October 2001 between EPC\n                                          \n23 One tala was equal to $0.338 in 1998.", "1144\nand the Independent State of Samoa, EPC\u2019s existing loans and arrears to the Government\nunder the twelve separate loan agreements concluded between the parties from 1979 to 1993\nwere consolidated into a single loan valued at ST70.8 million with a minimum annual interest\nrate of 5 percent, a grace period of 5 years, and payment period of 20 years. This agreement\nincludes the two subsidiary loans of ADB. The Government and ADB agreed to modify the\nrelending interest rate of 7.65 percent of these two subsidiary loans. One of the objectives of TA\n3203-SAM  for  institutional  strengthening  (footnote  6)  was  to  build  consensus  around  an\nacceptable action plan for EPC to meet its financial obligations in a sustainable manner. The TA\nhelped facilitate development and negotiations of the agreement. The agreed-upon interest rate\nreduction agreed on the EPC\u2019s loan repayments to the Treasury Department is justified, as the\nopportunity cost of capital has substantially declined in Samoa. In 1986 the average interest rate\non savings deposits was 7.4 percent and that on 6-month deposits was 13.1 percent. In 2000,\nthese interest rates were reduced to 3.0 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively.24 As part of the\nagreement, EPC paid the Treasury ST4.8 million on 29 June 2001 to cover its interest arrears.\n51. Under the same TA 3203-SAM, specific recommendations for EPC were developed,\nincluding  the  following:  (i)  automatically  adjust  tariffs  for  change  in  fuel  price  and  foreign\ncurrency exchange rate, (ii) establish a lifeline rate for low-income electricity consumers, and (iii)\nphase  out  the  current  discount  given  for  prompt  payment  of  bills  within  10  days.  These\nrecommendations were designed to help EPC improve its financial performance and make\nelectricity  more  affordable  to  low-income  Samoans.25  On  28  February  2001,  the  EPC\nmanagement  board  adopted  the  recommendations.  This  will  improve  EPC\u2019s  financial\nperformance and also help meet the loan covenants.\n52. The lifeline tariff adjustment is budget-neutral for EPC. In fact, the lower revenues from\nresidential users with low consumption (less than 50 kWh/month) will be cross-subsidized by\nhigher revenues from residential users with high consumption (more than 200 kWh/month).\nRecords in the recent past (Tables 2 and 3) indicate that electricity demand has been inelastic\nto tariff increase. Therefore, the proposed automatic tariff adjustment will not affect revenue\ngeneration negatively.\n5. Projected Financial Performance of EPC\n53. A number of EPC's actions in the past three years have gradually improved its financial\nperformance. In September 1998, EPC increased its tariff by 40 percent. Furthermore, earlier\nthis year (2001), EPC agreed to implement an automatic tariff adjustment for currency and fuel\ncost changes, phase out the discount for prompt bill payments, and reevaluate its fixed assets.\nIn the past, EPC had used inflation rates to adjust the values of its fixed assets. This method of\nasset valuation resulted in overvaluation. In 2000, EPC contracted an international firm to\ncomplete a reassessment of its fixed assets based on replacement costs. The reassessed net\nfixed assets value was reduced from ST237.2 million to ST183.6 million as of 30 June 2000,\nand annual depreciation costs have become lower. Additionally, EPC\u2019s rate of return on fixed\nassets has improved as the denominator (fixed asset value) of the equation used in the rate of\nreturn calculation is reduced.\n                                          \n24 In real terms, the 6-month interest rate on deposits was 7.3 percent in 1986 and 5.6 percent in 2000. For 2001, this\nis estimated to be 3.5 percent.\n25 The lifeline tariff rate structured to make electricity more affordable to the low-income consumers will not negatively\naffect EPC's financial position. This will be settled through cross-subsidy within the domestic sector.", "1155\n54. The Government has approved restructuring of EPC\u2019s arrears of ST75.6 million based\non a detailed assessment. This will save EPC over ST3.0 million per year in interest expense.\nEPC is working to further reduce system losses to less than 12.0 percent within five years. All\nthese measures  will provide a foundation for EPC to turn around its financial performance in a\nsustainable manner.\n55. Table 4 summarizes the projected performance of the three key financial indicators for\nEPC. More detailed financial projections are presented in Appendix 7. Due to EPC\u2019s massive\nrural electrification programs that have substantially increased its fixed assets and reduced its\nrate of return on net fixed assets, the Government and ADB agreed to reduce the return on\nassets covenant from 8 percent to 6 percent. EPC\u2019s financial performance is expected to\nimprove substantially. The rate of return on net fixed assets is projected to gradually improve\nfrom 4.45 percent in 2001 to 5.68 percent in 2004 and 8.89 percent in 2008. Similarly, EPC is\nexpected to achieve satisfactory debt-service ratio and self-financing ratio.\nTable 4: Projected Financial Performance of EPC\nCriteria 2000 2002 2005\nRate of Return on Net Fixed Assets (> 6%) 0.82 5.69 7.43\nDebt-Service Ratio ( > 1.3 times) 2.10 2.46 2.26\nSelf-Financing Ratio ( > 20%)         18 77 88\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n56. The economy of Samoa has performed well in recent years. GDP growth accelerated\nfrom  less  than  1  percent  in  1997  to  more  than  7  percent  in  2000.  The  good  economic\nperformance is partly due to the successful program of economic and financial reform and good\ngovernance that is boosting private sector activities.\n57. Since 1996, the Government of Samoa has been issuing a series of biennial statements\nof  economic  strategy  (SES).  These  have  all  emphasized  the  \u201cpartnership\u201d  approach  to\nformulating and implementing the national development policy. The current strategy (the third\none  covering  2000\u20132001)  continues  to  emphasize  macroeconomic  stability,  public  sector\nefficiency, improved education and health standards, and measures to support a strong private\nsector. In addition, it emphasizes agriculture and fisheries, sustainable tourist development, and\nthe importance of a revitalized village economy. An important feature of the new approach to\nstrategic  planning  is  the  extensive  and  successful  consultation  with  stakeholders.  A  major\nobjective of the strategy is to ensure that the whole community shares the benefits of the reform\nprogram.\n58. ADB\u2019s  strategy  of  assistance  to  Samoa  is  fully  compatible  with  and  supports  the\nGovernment\u2019s development strategy and its reform agenda, which aim to develop an enabling\nenvironment for a private sector-led economic growth. ADB supports public sector reform,\nliberalizing  the  financial  sector,  promoting  private  sector-led  growth,  corporatizing  and\nprivatizing  SOEs,  improving  the  management  of  power  and  infrastructure  facilities,  and\naddressing inefficiencies in education, including skills development.", "1166\n59. ADB  has  been  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda  for  several  years.  In\nFebruary 1998, ADB approved a Financial Sector Program loan for $7.5 million equivalent\n(footnotes 12). The program loan supports the development of a market-based financial sector\nsystem to increase participation/mobilization of domestic resources and promote efficiency in\nresource allocation. The program also aims to privatize, corporatize, and enhance the efficiency\nof  the  SOEs  and  utilities  and  helps  promote  private  sector-led  economic  growth  and\nemployment generation. The Government has met the conditions of the second tranche.\n60. The power sector strategy of the Government is directly linked to ADB\u2019s overall country\nstrategy, which emphasizes poverty reduction and social and economic development objectives,\nincluding  private  sector  development.  The  energy  supply  is  becoming  a  constraint  to  the\ncountry\u2019s economic and social development. In FY 1999/2000, EPC had a total of 77 power\noutages, each lasting an average of 30 minutes.\n61. The project processing engaged ADB and EPC in an extended policy dialogue. Some of\nthe agreed-upon reforms have already been implemented (i.e., change in EPC board, measures\nfor  improved  financial  results,  lifeline  tariff  for  low-income  consumers,  automatic  tariff\nadjustment, etc.). Paras. 39-43 provide further details.\n62. The basic rationale of the Project lies in the need to strengthen EPC\u2019s capacity to meet\nthe growing power demand in Samoa with the use of renewable resources in a least-cost\nmanner. The Government\u2019s energy policy aims at reducing dependence on imported fuels\nthrough development of indigenous renewable energy sources, and meeting the demand for\nelectricity with a high level of reliability. The proposed Project is consistent with this policy, as it\nwill develop hydro energy resources in place of diesel-generated energy supply. In addition, TA\nwill  be  provided  to  strengthen  EPC\u2019s  energy  loss  reduction  and  operation  management\ncapability.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n63. The main objective of the Project is to assist the Government and EPC to undertake\nnecessary policy changes, increase EPC efficiency and commercial viability, and undertake the\nhighest  priority  investment  to  augment  the  Afulilo  hydropower  scheme,  in  support  of  the\ncountry's energy sector development plan. In addition to the loan and the associated TA, power\nsector improvement will  continue through the long-term policy dialogue and implementation of\nthe specific Government assurances in conjunction with this loan. The loan and TA are an\neffective mechanism for the Government to continue improving the power sector and facilitating\nprivate sector engagement in the power sector.\n64. The Project comprises the following:\n(i) Continuing the policy dialogue to facilitate full commercialization of EPC and\nfurther private sector engagement in the power sector. The power sector policy\nissues  discussed  and  the  agreements  reached  by  ADB  and  the\nGovernment/EPC are presented in paras. 38-43. The specific assurances given\nfor the Project are summarized in Chapter VI.\n(ii) Reducing energy losses and strengthening EPC operation management capacity\nto provide more reliable power to the consumers. The scope of the associated\nTA is described in paras. 90 to 91.", "1177\n(iii) Increasing Afulilo reservoir volume by 50 percent to 15 million cubic meters (m3).\nThis  will  be  accomplished  by  raising  the  dam  crest  by  1.7  m.  The  existing\nspillway crest will be capped with concrete and the spillway bridge will be jacked\nup to provide flood clearance.\n(iv) Installing a third 2 MW generator in Ta\u2019elefaga power station.\n(v) Constructing a 7.1 km gravity diversion canal.\n(vi) Upgrading  the  south  coast  transmission  loop  from  22  kV  to  33  kV  to\naccommodate the increased power output from the third 2 MW generator.\n(vii) Expanding the transformer capacity of the north coast transmission loop from 6\nMVA to 12 MVA to improve the reliability of the transmission system.\n(viii) Upgrading the telemetry system of the Afulilo hydropower scheme to improve\nmonitoring, communication, and control.\n(ix) Implementing several environmental management measures: installing a new\nwater supply system for the affected villages, building a new bridge downstream\nfrom the power station to improve safety, and implementing a postproject water\nquality monitoring program.\n(x) Providing consulting services for detailed design, technical review, tender and\naward of contract, and supervision of construction and project implementation.\nC. Technical Justification\n65. The  existing  Afulilo  hydropower  scheme  provides  a  total  capacity  of  4  MW  and  a\nmaximum power supply of 24 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per annum. The dam is made of concrete\nwith a central spillway, wings, and rockfill abutment on both sides. The existing reservoir surface\narea is approximately 251 hectares (ha). It will be increased by 7.8 percent to 270.4 ha. The\nhydraulic discharge is conveyed through an intake tunnel 60 m long below the left abutment.\nThis tunnel is then connected to a 4.0 km long descending penstock that carries the hydraulic\ndischarge to the powerhouse in Ta\u2019elefaga village near Fagaloa Bay.\n66. The existing Afulilo scheme was designed and constructed with provision for expansion.\nThe  Project  is  needed  now  to  cope  with  the  increasing  power  demand  and  deteriorating\nreliability of the system, particularly during the dry season. The Project will augment the existing\nAfulilo  power  by  installing  an  additional  2  MW  generating  unit.  This  will  be  relatively\nstraightforward as the size of the existing penstock is adequate for the increased water flow and\nthe civil works at the power station were already built for the installation of a third generator.\n67. Extra water to power the third generator was previously envisaged to come from the\nconstruction of the Vaipu pumping station immediately downstream of Afulilo. In view of the\nconsiderable environmental concern about flooding of the Vaipu swamp, the Vaipu station could\nnot be developed. On the other hand, seepage through the floor of the Afulilo reservoir is much\nsmaller than envisaged. The Afulilo dam feasibility study revealed more than 5 m of lake\nsediments in the basin upstream of the dam. These sediments help reduce seepage. Thus,\nraising the reservoir/dam spillway and constructing a canal outside the present catchment to\nincrease the water flow of the reservoir can justify the addition of a third generator in Afulilo\u2019s", "1188\npowerhouse. The revision of the hydrology of the catchment areas was originally carried out in\nTA 2267,26 and reconfirmed by TA 3203 (footnote 6).\n68. Construction of the Afulilo hydroelectric power project began in 1991. In March 1993 the\ndam was closed and the storage began filling. The first runs of the two generators were carried\nout in July and August 1993. By August the reservoir had reached 316.40 m above sea level\n(masl) (1.1 m below the 317.50 masl full supply level) and the scheme was regularly supplying\npower to the grid. The storage continued to fill and the reservoir began to spill in October 1993\nand  continued  to  spill  until  late  November  1993.  The  reservoir  spilled  intermittently  from\nNovember 1993 to March 1994. The last spill took place in January 1997. Since then, EPC has\nmanaged to prevent water spills and to maximize the power output from the Afulilo scheme.\n69. The Afulilo power augmentation will increase the height of the dam by 1.7 m from 317.50\nmasl to 319.20 masl. It will increase the reservoir\u2019s gross storage volume from 10 million m3 to\n15 million m3. The key objective is to store the water in the wet season and use it to produce\npower in the dry season. With the augmented installed capacity of 2 MW and the average\naugmented generation from 21 to 31 GWh per annum, the plant capacity factor (percent of the\ntime plant is  running) will be reduced from 0.60 to 0.58, which reflects better its peaking\ncapacity. During the wet season from November to March when other ROR hydropower units\nare running, the augmented Afulilo scheme will be run only a few hours a day during daytime\nand system evening peak periods (from 6:30 pm to 9:30 pm). The Project will be operated at full\ncapacity during most of the day in the dry season (from April to October) when other ROR\nhydropower units are not running.\nD. Cost Estimates\n70. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $7.5 million equivalent, inclusive of import\nduties and taxes, of which the foreign exchange cost is $6.0 million (about 80 percent as EPC\nimports almost all the materials and equipment it needs). The local cost is estimated at $1.5\nmillion equivalent (about 20 percent). These cost estimates are based on 2001 prices and\ninclude provisions for physical contingencies and price escalation. The detailed cost estimates\nin Appendix 8 are summarized in Table 5.\n                                          \n26 TA 2267-SAM, Institutional Support and Power Development Study for the EPC, for $350,000, approved on 27\nDecember 1994.", "1199\nTable 5: Project Cost Estimates\n($\u2019000)\nItem Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nDiversion Canal 1,052 171 1,223\nAfulilo Civil Works 305 40 345\nThird Generator 1,174 46 1,220\nTransmission 2,153 57 2,210\nMitigation Measures 0 615 615\nConsulting Services 450 70 520\n   Subtotal 5,134 999 6,133\nTaxes & Duties 0 397 397\nPhysical Contingency (8.3%) 480 64 544\nPrice Contingency (5.5%) 350 40 390\nInterest During Construction 36 0 36\n                   Total 6,000 1,500 7,500\nE. Financing Plan\n71. It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $6.0 million equivalent from its Special Funds\nresources to finance the foreign exchange cost, including interest and charges on the ADB loan\nduring  construction  (Table  6).  The  Government/EPC  will  provide  a  total  of  $1,500,000\nequivalent to finance the local currency costs of the Project.\nTable 6: Financing Plan\n($\u2018000)\nSource Foreign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\nADB 6,000              0 6,000 80\nEPC/Government                0 1,500 1,500 20\n        Total 6,000 1,500 7,500 100\n       ADB = Asian Development Bank, EPC = Electric Power Corporation.\n72. The  Borrower  will  be  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa,  which  will  relend  the  loan\nproceeds to EPC under a subsidiary loan agreement with a minimum interest rate of 5.0 percent\nper annum and a repayment period of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years.\nF. Executing Agency\n73. The  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  will  be  the  EPC,  a  statutory  government\ncorporation. EPC was incorporated in December 1972 under the Electric Power Corporation\nAct, 1972. Under the Act and its amendments in 1980, 1981, and 1984, EPC is responsible for\ngenerating, transmitting, and distributing power in Samoa. It has a seven-member board, which\ndetermines the general policy of EPC. The board is chaired by the minister of works, and\nincludes other members representing the Treasury Department, the Public Works Department,\nthe Chamber of Commerce, consumer groups, and educational and church bodies. EPC's\ngeneral manager (the chief executive of EPC) is also on the board.", "2200\nG. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Project Office and Implementation Schedule\n74. The general manager of EPC will be responsible for overall management of the Project.\nTo manage day-to-day implementation, EPC will establish a project office to be headed by a\nfull-time project manager with qualifications and experience satisfactory to ADB. The office will\nbe adequately staffed at all times with competent supporting personnel to undertake day-to-day\nactivities such as consultancy, contracts, procurement, accounting, records, reports, etc. The\nproject office will be in operation before the effectiveness date and until 2004, which is a few\nmonths after the project physical completion date of December 2003. EPC will be assisted by\nconsultants in preparing engineering designs, supervising construction, and technical review.\nThe consultants will be selected and appointed by February 2002. A contract under a turnkey\narrangement for the civil works, electrical and mechanical equipment, and for the transmission\nloops upgrade is expected to be awarded by October 2002. Appendix 9 gives a detailed\nimplementation schedule.\n2. Procurement\n75. All the civil works, electrical and mechanical works, and equipment required under the\nProject will be procured preferably through one single turnkey contract following international\ncompetitive bidding (ICB), a two-stage bidding procedure, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\nfor Procurement. The main components of the turnkey package will be (i) civil works, (ii)\nelectrical and mechanical works and equipment, and (iii) transmission and telemetry upgrade.\n3. Advance Action\n76. To expedite procurement for the Project, ADB has approved the Government request for\nadvance  action  on  prequalification  of  contractors.  Similarly,  to  expedite  implementation,\nadvance action for recruiting the project implementation consultants was approved. Approval of\nsuch advance actions does not commit ADB to finance the loan.\n4. Consulting Services\n77. Approximately 10 person-months of international consulting services will be required to\nassist EPC in detailed engineering design, preparation of specifications and tender documents,\ntender evaluation, and construction supervision. Appendix 10 gives the broad terms of reference\nand cost estimates for these services. The Government will ensure that all consulting contracts\ncontain appropriate representations and warranties. EPC will engage a firm of engineering\nconsultants, with experience and qualifications in hydropower and power system design and\nimplementation, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The engagement is\nanticipated to last from February 2002 to December 2003.\n78. Four  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  will  also  be  required  for\nimproving EPC\u2019s energy loss reduction and maintenance management under the proposed ADB\nTA. The consultants for the TA  will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants. The TA will commence in February 2002 and will be completed in October\n2002.", "2211\n5. Disbursements\n79. The loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook\ndated January 2001, as amended from time to time. EPC will award the project implementation-\nrelated consulting services contract by February 2002. Preparation of specifications and tender\ndocuments, tender evaluation, and award of the turnkey contract are expected to be completed\nby October 2002. Construction will begin within one month of contract award if the weather\npermits. Direct payment procedure will be used for the turnkey contract. For the civil, electrical,\nand mechanical works, 80 percent of the loan will be disbursed in 2002 and 20 percent in 2003.\n80. For  the  international  consulting  services  relating  to  both  project  implementation\nassistance and the associated TA, direct payment procedures will be used.\n6.  Reports, Accounts, and Audits\n81. EPC will comply with the following reports, accounts, and audit requirements: (i) prepare\nand submit detailed quarterly project progress reports, preferably together with brief, faxed, or e-\nmailed monthly progress reports to enhance proactive project management; (ii) maintain a\nseparate project account, with audited project accounts and statements submitted to ADB within\nnine months after the end of each fiscal year; and (iii) prepare and submit a project completion\nreport within three months after physical completion of the Project.\nH. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environmental Measures\n82. Considering the typical environmental issues associated with hydropower augmentation,\nthis Project has been classified as environmental category A. An EIA was prepared by EPC.\nSince then, EPC has again met with officers of SPREP; an environmental nongovernment\norganization, the Siosiomaga Society;27 and the Division of Environment and Conservation\n(DEC); and had other public meetings with the Ti'avea and Ta\u2019elefaga villagers. The EIA, as\napproved by the Government, is expected before the effective date. The summary EIA was\ncirculated to the Board on 19 July 2001. EPC agreed to\n(i) continue public consultations to explain to the villagers the potential impacts, the\nproposed  mitigation  measures,  and  the  long-term  water  quality  monitoring\nprograms, and how the villagers can get involved;\n(ii) install  silencers  on  not  only  the  third  generator  but  also  the  two  existing\ngenerators to minimize noise impact; and\n(iii) coordinate with DEC to implement a systematic water quality monitoring program.\n83. The Project will upgrade existing facilities in Afulilo and increase the installed capacity of\nthe hydropower plant from 4 MW to 6 MW. The EIA concludes that the environmental impact\narising from construction of the facilities and subsequent operation under the Project can be\nmitigated  to  acceptable  levels  by  implementing  identified  mitigation  measures.

The environmental impacts of increased dam height, increased discharge, noise levels,\nand transmission line upgrade were assessed and mitigation measures formulated as follows:\n(i) The additional inundated land (19.4 ha) as a result of increasing the water level\nby 1.7 m is still within the fenced area of land acquired by the Government in\n1988 and consists of secondary growth.\n(ii) There will be no need to open a new quarry as the existing quarries can supply\nthe required construction materials.\n(iii) The  third  generator  will  increase  discharge  by  0.825  m3/sec,  i.e.,  from  1.65\nm3/sec  to  2.475  m3/sec,  which  is  still  within  the  natural  variability  of  the\nTa\u2019elefaga creek flow (the average annual peak flow of this creek is 15 m3/sec).\nAnnually, the Project will increase the freshwater inflow to Fagaloa Bay by 4\npercent. The increased flow of this magnitude is not expected to cause significant\nenvironmental impacts on the bay environment. Nevertheless, a water quality\nmonitoring program will be implemented to identify and address any unforeseen\nwater quality impact on the bay.\n(iv) The third generator will increase the total noise level from 92 decibels audible\n(dBA) to approximately 95 dBA inside the plant. Incremental noise level expected\nfrom the Project outside the plant will be insignificant; nevertheless, silencers will\nbe installed on not only the new generator, but also the two existing generators to\nminimize noise impact.\n(v) Upgrading the existing transmission line will not have adverse impacts since it\nwill be done within existing alignments, and will use the existing wooden poles.\nDuring construction, EPC will keep temporary disturbance along the transmission\nroute to a minimum.\n85. The proposed Project will provide an additional 10 GWh electricity annually. Without the\nProject, the 10 GWh electricity would have to be generated using diesel fuels. Other alternatives\nsuch as solar, wind, and wave energy sources are not viable. Thus, the proposed Project will\nsubstantially  reduce  the  amounts  of  air  emissions.28  These  estimated  emission  reductions\nrepresent approximately 20 percent of the total emissions from EPC\u2019s diesel power generation.\n86. The eastern diversion canal (7,056 m long and 1 m wide at the base and less than 3 m\nwide at the top of the canal) will need the acquisition of 4.2 ha of customary land presently\nconsisting of bushes and secondary growth; however, no houses or people will be directly\naffected. No resettlement is involved. Public consultations and meetings have been undertaken\nand EPC has obtained permission from the Ti'avea village to build the canal. The Government\nwill take the necessary steps to acquire the land formally, with appropriate compensation to\nlandowners and users. The environmental impact of the proposed canal will still be acceptable\n                                          \n28 Total amounts of air emission to be avoided by the Project (based on the life cycle of the Project) are 5.7 million\ntons nitrous oxide, 1.2 million tons carbon monoxide, 374 kg sulfur oxide, 401 kg particulate matter, 210 tons\ncarbon dioxide, and 844 kg aldehydes.", "2233\nsince the canal will divert only about 35 percent of the surface runoff in the catchment area\nduring the rainy season. To enhance the positive impact of the Project, EPC has coordinated\nwith the Samoa Water Authority (SWA) to extend a water supply system to Ti'avea village to\ngive the approximately 200 villagers a more convenient water supply. EPC will work with SWA\nto ensure that water supply will be available to the village before civil works on the diversion\ncanal start. The cost of this measure (estimated to be $268,000) has been included as a project\ncost.\n87. EPC will coordinate with DEC in preparing, implementing, and operating the Project to\nensure that all applicable environmental laws, regulations, and guidelines will be complied with.\nEPC has assured that the Project will be implemented in an environmentally sound manner.\nAdequate funds (as specified in the EIA) will be provided for the mitigation measures to ensure\nthat environmental impacts will be minimized to acceptable levels and will meet government as\nwell as ADB environmental requirements. EPC will recruit a full-time environmental coordinator\nbefore July 2002 who will supervise implementation of environmental mitigation measures, and\ncoordinate environmental management and monitoring during operation. EPC will report the\noutcome  of  environmental  monitoring  to  ADB  and  DEC  through  the  progress  reports  on\nimplementation, and an evaluation report one year after project completion.\n88. When  the  Afulilo  project  started  operating  in  1993,  discharged  water  from  the\npowerhouse was unusually brown and emitted a sulfuric smell in the first few years. In the past\ntwo years, the smell has been less strong. The smell was detected on some days but not on\nothers. During project appraisal, physical and chemical analyses were done on water taken from\nthe reservoir and the tailrace. However, the smell of the discharged water was not detected in\nthe several weeks prior to taking the water samples. Thus, the water analysis results were\ninconclusive. EPC agreed to carry out a longer term environmental monitoring program to\nanalyze the quality of the discharged water. The water quality analyses will start 12 months\nbefore physical completion of the Project to establish the baseline conditions. EPC will perform\nwater quality analysis regularly after the Project is commissioned and will coordinate with DEC\nand Ta\u2019elefaga village on environmental monitoring. Should there be any significant changes in\nthe quality of the discharged water, EPC will work with DEC, SWA, and the Department of\nHealth to develop and implement remedial measures.\n2. Social Measures\n89. Several social issues are associated with the Project. These issues and the mitigation\nmeasures are summarized below (a summary of the effects on  poverty reduction is in Appendix\n12):\n(i)  Water use. When built, the proposed canal will divert a maximum of 35 percent\nof the surface runoff from the catchment area during the wet season into Afulilo\nreservoir. The surface runoff would otherwise flow into the Pacific Ocean. At\npresent,  there  is  no  water  supply  in  Ti'avea  village.  In  the  wet  season,  the\nvillagers use tanks or containers to save rainwater for use. In the dry season,\nthere is only one running stream fed with spring water. The villagers use the\nwater from this stream to supplement bottled water for drinking. To mitigate any\npotential  impact  on  the  villagers\u2019  use  of  this  stream,  EPC  will  construct  the\ndiversion canal in a way that it will not divert any water from this stream.\nFurther, EPC has agreed to install a new water supply system for Ti'avea village.\nThe new system will benefit the villagers. In the dry season (April-December), the", "2244\nvillagers, particularly children and women have to walk long distances or pay\nST10 for a pickup truck ride to carry water in containers from the running stream\nback to the village. There were reports that, while fetching water, children fell into\nthe stream and had to be hospitalized. With the new water supply system, the\nvillagers will have a convenient water supply and avoid the inconvenience and\nrisk associated with taking water from the stream.\n(ii)  Land compensation. The proposed diversion canal will have a total length of\n7,056 m. A total of 3.5\u20134.0 ha of land required for the canal and access road is\non customary land that belongs to Ti'avea villagers. The land has grass, scrubs,\nand secondary regrowth trees. There are neither people nor permanent activities\non this site. EPC has met with the Ti'avea village representatives and obtained\ntheir  permission  to  build  the  diversion  canal.  The  Government  will  formally\nacquire the land with appropriate compensation.\n(iii)  Safety of bridge crossing. Ta\u2019elefaga villagers indicated that the 4 m wide\nbridge downstream from the power station is frequently flooded during the wet\nseason. To improve the safety of the villagers, EPC has agreed to widen the\ncreek channel and build a new bridge sufficiently higher than the existing one\nwith guardrails on both sides. In addition, EPC has installed a new streetlight for\nsafe use of the bridge at night.\n(iv)  More affordable electricity tariff for low-income consumers. EPC has agreed\nto  implement  a  lifeline  rate  to  make  electricity  tariff  more  affordable  to\napproximately 9,560 low-income consumers. These poor consumers represent\nabout  47  percent  of  EPC\u2019s  domestic  customers,  but  only  11  percent  of  the\nresidential electrical consumption. They typically use less than 50 kWh per month\nand will see their electricity rate reduced by approximately 17 percent. Other\nelectricity consumers can expect a more stable electricity rate from the reduced\ndiesel fuel costs as a result of the Project.\n(v)  Improved  electricity  services.  All  electricity  consumers  can  expect  a  more\nreliable service particularly in the dry season. In FY1999/2000, EPC had a total\nof 77 power outages. Reduced power outages will result in less disruption to the\nbusiness of shops, and operations of hospitals, health clinics, and educational\nfacilities. The low-income villagers use electricity mainly for lighting during the\nevening hours. More reliable electricity services in this period will be helpful. Also\nduring the outages, villagers use more expensive kerosene or alcohol for lighting,\nor wood fuels that generate more pollution and result in more tree cutting in the\nforest.\nI. Technical Assistance\n90. The  TA  will  assist  EPC  in  strengthening  its  management  capacity    to  improve  its\nperformance and asset utilization efficiency. The specific objectives are to help (i) improve\nEPC\u2019s  maintenance  capacity  to  reduce  the  frequency  and  duration  of  power  outages  and\nmaintenance costs, and (ii) strengthen EPC's capacity to reduce energy loss in a cost-effective\nmanner. The consultants will undertake these tasks:", "2255\n(i) assess  EPC's  current  maintenance  practices,  make  recommendations  for\nimprovements; assess available software packages, recommend the best suited\nto EPC, install and test the software, and train the EPC staff; and\n(ii) review the historical energy loss data; evaluate the DigSilent power software,\ncompute  the  energy  technical  losses  of  the  EPC  power  system,  estimate\nnontechnical energy loss, and develop a cost-effective strategy to reduce the\nsystem's total energy loss.\n91. The TA will finance 4 person-months of international consulting services. ADB will recruit\nindividual consultants with expertise in power energy losses and maintenance management, in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The total cost of the TA is\nestimated to be $185,000 equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of $150,000. ADB will\nprovide the TA as a grant financed by the ADB-funded TA Program to cover the foreign\nexchange costs. The Government/EPC will provide the remaining $35,000 through counterpart\nstaff, and office and communication costs. The details of the TA are in Appendix 13.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Economic and Financial Analyses\n92. This section presents the economic and financial analyses of the investment being\nfinanced under the loan for the Power Sector Improvement Project. The financial projections for\nEPC and power tariffs are discussed in Chapter III and Appendix 7. Further details are available\non request.\n93. The economic and financial analyses of the project investment for Afulilo augmentation\ncompared the benefits of the additional power generation to the total cost. In addition, a least-\ncost economic analysis was conducted to demonstrate that augmentation is less expensive than\nan alternative diesel power generation. The switching values related to the parameters used in\nthe analysis were also computed (Appendix 14).\n94. The economic cost estimates are based on May 2001 prices and include base costs,\ncosts of the environmental and social mitigation measures described earlier (paras. 82-89), and\nphysical contingencies, but no taxes and duties. The economic benefits were calculated by\nmultiplying the forecast net additional power generation by the present value of the weighted\nresource cost savings of consumer alternative sources of energy, and consumers' willingness to\npay. The average tariff was used as a proxy for the willingness of the consumers to pay for the\nelectricity.\n95. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the base case is estimated to be 22.0\npercent. Thus, the project proposal is economically justifiable. Based on the net present value\n(NPV) of total economic cost, the project proposal is also less expensive than the diesel\ngeneration alternative. At a discount rate of 12 percent, the NPV of the economic cost is $5.40\nmillion, while the NPV of the diesel alternative\u2019s cost is $8.62 million.\n96. The Project is fully consistent with the Government\u2019s strategy for emphasizing renewable\npower development and reducing fuel imports. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the\nrobustness of the results to standard changes in the underlying assumptions (Table 8). The\nswitching points would be if (i) benefits were 47 percent lower (equivalent to 5.3 GWh per year),", "2266\n(ii)  costs  were  85  percent  higher,  or  (iii)  there  would  be  more  than  five  years  delay  in\nimplementation. The Project remains viable in all cases.\n97. For the financial analysis, financial costs used  include the economic costs and duties\nand taxes. The financial analysis was performed by comparing the financial cost with the\nbenefits  of  the  additional  power  generation.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is\nestimated to be 18 percent. The Project is financially justifiable. The FIRR also remains robust\nfor the sensitivity scenarios, as shown in Table 8.\nTable 8: FIRR and EIRR Sensitivity Analysis\nItem FIRR Sensitivity EIRR Sensitivity\n(percent) Indicatora (percent) Indicator\nBase Case 18.0            - 22.0            -\nProject Capital Cost +10% 16.3 0.94 20.0 0.91\nProject Benefit \u201310% 16.5 0.83 20.2 0.82\nProject Cost +10% & Benefit \u2013 10% 14.9 18.4\nImplementation Delay by 1 year 16.1            - 19.5            -\na Sensitivity indicator is the ratio of percentage change in the economic internal rate of return or financial\ninternal rate of return to percentage change in the sensitivity parameter.\n98. The least-cost analysis indicates that the long-term marginal cost of the Project is about\n$0.07/kWh, much cheaper than the $0.11/kWh of the diesel power alternative. The switching\npoints between the Project and the diesel alternative would be if (i) project costs were 42\npercent higher, or (ii) diesel alternative\u2019s costs were 30 percent lower.\n99. Increase in project cost and delay in implementation cannot be ruled out. Sensitivity to\ncurrency devaluation was not performed as EPC has agreed to implement an automatic tariff\nadjustment mechanism for currency variations. To minimize the risks, a number of measures\nhave been or will be taken. A strong management organization with a full-time experienced\nperson as project manager under the direction of the EPC general manager will be established.\nThe project manager will be supported by an international consultant with extensive experience.\nThe contractors for civil, electrical, and mechanical works will be prequalified to expedite the\nselection  process.  EPC  will  comply  with  the  project  reports,  and  accounts  and  audit\nrequirements (para. 81).\nB. Environment\n100. The Project will help EPC reduce air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions that\nwould result from a diesel power generation alternative. The potential environmental impacts will\nbe minimized through various mitigation measures as an integrated part of the Project. EPC will\nstrengthen its capability by adding new staff with environmental management training to be\nresponsible for implementing the mitigation measures identified in the EIA report. EPC will\nprovide  an  annual  budget  for  carrying  out  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring\nprogram  to  address  any  unforeseen  environmental  issues  after  project  completion.  The\nstrengthened environmental management capability at EPC will help ensure the sustainable use\nof renewable hydropower.", "2277\nC. Social Dimensions\n101. The Project will generate net social benefits. It will create 40-60 unskilled and semiskilled\nnew jobs and wage income mainly for local villagers during construction. As noted before, the\nnew  water  supply  system  that  SWA/EPC  will  build  as  part  of  this  Project  will  provide  a\nconvenient water supply and prevent the risks and costs of taking water from the stream,\nparticularly for children and women in Ti'avea village. Additionally, the Project will build a new\nbridge to improve the safety of the bridge crossing for Ta\u2019elefaga villagers, especially children\nand women. The new lifeline rate that EPC will implement will make electricity rate 17 percent\nless than the current electricity tariff for poor consumers, (approximately 9,560 consumers, or 47\npercent of EPC\u2019s total number of domestic customers). The Project will substantially improve\nthe power system's reliability, particularly in the dry season. The improved reliability will benefit\nvillagers the most as they will encounter less frequent power outages. At present, the rural\nareas encounter more power outages than do urban areas. Power outages disrupt the health\ncare provided by clinics and hospitals and activities of schools in the villages. More reliable\nelectricity service will reduce the need for villagers to use other fuels for lighting. Alternative\nfuels such as kerosene and alcohol are more expensive and dangerous, while wood fuels\ngenerate pollution and lead to more tree cutting in the forest.\nVI. ASSURANCES\n102. The Government and EPC have given the following assurances, in addition to the\nstandard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i) EPC  and  the  Government  will  adopt  the  necessary  measures,  including\nimplementing  the  automatic  tariff  adjustment  to  diesel  price  and  currency\nexchange modifications, as well as tariff increases when required, to enable EPC\nto achieve and to maintain during the life of the Project\n(a) a minimum annual rate of return on revalued fixed net assets in operation\nof at least 4 percent in 2002, 2003, and 2004, and at least 6 percent by\n2005 and for each fiscal year thereafter;\n(b) a self-financing ratio of not less than 20 percent of the five-year moving\naverage  of  total  investment  requirements  for  its  capital  expenditure\nprogram; and\n(c) a debt-service ratio of not less than 1.3 times the estimated maximum\ndebt-service requirements.\n(ii)  To protect low-income consumers, the Government will ensure that EPC will\napply a lifeline tariff on domestic consumption of up to 50 kWh per month.\n(iii)  To reduce potential delay in payments, EPC will charge a penalty of 2 percent\nper month on amounts overdue by more than 30 days after the payment due\ndate. EPC will maintain its accounts receivable at less than two months of sales\nafter eliminating discounts for prompt bill payments.\n(iv)  EPC  will  progressively  reduce  the  total  system  energy  losses  in  the  Upolu\nnetwork from the current 15 percent to less than 12 percent in five years.", "2288\n(vi)  EPC and the Government will ensure that\n(a) the Project will be implemented in accordance with existing environmental\nlaws, regulations, and standards of Samoa, and ADB\u2019s guidelines, in\nparticular, ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Industrial and\nPower  Development Projects;\n(b) an environmental monitoring program agreed upon with ADB to monitor\nthe effects associated with the increased freshwater outflow from the\nproposed  augmentation  on  the  water  quality  of  Fagaloa  Bay  will  be\nestablished not later than 31 December 2002. The outcome of monitoring\nwill be reported by EPC to ADB and DEC through the quarterly progress\nreports on implementation, and an evaluation report one year after project\ncompletion;\n(c) to implement the environmental monitoring program, EPC will hire a full-\ntime environmental coordinator by 31 July 2002, with the annual budget\nspecified in the environmental monitoring program;\n(d) all  the  environmental  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  EIA  are\nincorporated into the project design, civil works, and other contracts and\nfollowed during project implementation, and O&M of the project facilities;\nand\n(e) the environmental monitoring plan detailed in EIA, including installing a\nnew water supply system for Ti'avea village, constructing a new bridge\ncrossing for the Ta'elefaga creek, and implementing the water quality\nmonitoring program, is fully implemented.\n(v)  The Government will ensure that\n(a) necessary steps are taken to acquire all lands, properties, and all rights,\neasements, privileges, and approvals pertaining to lands and properties\nnecessary for project implementation;\n(b) prior to loan effectiveness, (i) the DLSE will approve the EIA; (ii) EPC will\ncommence  the  phased-out  elimination  of  the  10  percent  discount  for\nprompt payment of electricity accounts by eliminating the first 5 percent of\nthe discount; and (iii) the EPC will establish the project office;\n(c) the complete elimination of the 10 percent discount for prompt payment of\nelectricity accounts will occur by 1 January 2003;\n(d) prior to loan disbursement for civil works for constructing the diversion\ncanal, adequate compensation is paid to local communities that will be\nlosing  their  rights  to  the  land  as  a  result  of  land  acquisition  by  the\nGovernment for the purpose of the Project; and\n(e) no amendments will be made to the Agreement of 19 October 2001\nbetween the Independent State of Samoa and EPC on debt restructuring\nwithout the prior consent of ADB.", "2299\n103. The Government and EPC will provide counterpart funding, satisfactory to ADB, for the\nlocal currency costs. The Government agrees with ADB that the Government will prepare by 31\nDecember of each year an operation plan for the next year to ensure that during each year of\nconstruction, adequate allocations of the required counterpart funds will be made and such\nfunds will be released on a timely and regular basis.\nVII.

Loan 813-SAM(SF) and Loan 1228-SAM(SF)1 required the Electric Power Corporation\n(EPC) to have (i) a self-financing ratio of not less than 20 percent of its capital expenditures,\nbased on a five-year moving average; (ii) debt-service ratio of not less than 1.3 times the\nestimated maximum debt-service requirements; and (iii) a rate of return on revalued net fixed\nassets of at least 8 percent.\n2. This was not achieved.

Thus, the computation of DSR and SFR for the past few years may not be meaningful.\n     Source: Electric Power Corporation.\n3. Due  to  the  massive  rural  electrification  programs  that  have  substantially  increased\nEPC\u2019s fixed assets and reduced its rate of return on net fixed assets, it was agreed that the\ncovenanted return on assets be reduced from 8 percent to 6 percent by 2005.\n                  \n1 Loan 0813-SAM (SF): Afulilo Hydroelectric Project (Western Samoa), for $5.4 million, approved on

Background\n1. Upgrading of the Upolu Power System was studied under TA 2267-SAM,1 and the\nresults are presented in the Final Report, Volume 2-Power Development Plan and Volume 3-\nTechnical Appendixes dated October 1997. The study investigated a number of development\noptions for increasing the system's generating capacity to cope with the expected load growth\nand dry season demand and improvement of the transmission system's reliability. The study\nconcluded that the least-cost generation development plan is to augment the output from Afulilo\nhydropower station.\n2. The recommended works for augmenting the output from Afulilo/Ta\u2019elefaga hydropower\nstation (the Project) include (i) constructing the 7.1-kilometer (km) eastern diversion channel to\nincrease  the  water  flowing  into  Afulilo  reservoir,  (ii)  raising  the  Afulilo  dam  1.7  meters  to\nincrease the regulating capacity of the reservoir, (iii) installing a third 2-megawatt generating set\nin the Ta\u2019elefaga power station, (iv) upgrading the south coast transmission loop from 22\nkilovolts (kV) to 33 kV; (v) upgrading transformer capacity of the north coast transmission loop\nfrom 6 megavolt-amperes (MVA) to 12 MVA; and (vi) upgrading the Afulilo telemetry equipment.\nThese improvements\u2013found to be technically and economically viable with only minor adverse\nenvironmental and social impacts\u2013were recommended for implementation.\n3. To carry out these works, the Electric Power Corporation (EPC) will require the services\nof an international consulting firm experienced in engineering such works.

Introduction\n1. The Electric Power Corporation (EPC) of Samoa operates power systems on the islands\nof Upolu and Savai'i. The Upolu generation system, the largest, comprises 11.5 megawatts\n(MW) installed hydropower plants and 12.8 MW installed diesel plants. The  hydropower  plants\ninclude  the 4 MW Afulilo long-term storage hydropower plant, and four run-of-river (ROR) hydro\nstations. The latter include a 1 MW (wet season capacity) station at Alaoa, a 1.6 MW station at\nFale-Ole-Fee, a 1.4 MW station at Samasoni, and a 3.5 MW station at Sauniatu. The capacity of\nthe ROR stations during the dry season is typically 80 percent less than during the wet season.\n2. The Upolu system had a peak demand of 13.5 MW in 2000, compared with 2.5 MW in\nthe Savai'i system. The long-term growth of the Upolu peak power demand has averaged 5.91\npercent per annum from 2.41 MW in 1970 to 13.5 MW in 2000. In the last decade, the load\ndemand has increased at a yearly rate of 5.4 percent between 1991 and 2000.\n3. The Upolu system currently has a maximum generating capacity of 24.3 MW in the wet\nseason and 18.3 MW in the dry season. The firm capacity (the total capacity in the dry season if\nthe largest generator is out for overhaul and the second largest generator fails) is only 10.3 MW,\nless than the 13.5 MW peak demand in 2000. Without adding generation capacity, the demand\nand supply imbalance will worsen.\n4. The Upolu system combines transmission and distribution functions together, as there\nare no dedicated feeders to transfer power from generation centers to load centers. Power\ndistribution is by 33 kilovolts (kV), 22 kV, and 6.6 kV primary lines, and service is at 415/230\nvolts. The system is basically radial with the main load center concentrated along the northern\ncoast, mainly around the capital and western part of the island.\n5. There are two main generation centers: one at the load center in Apia and based on\ndiesel as well as ROR hydro generation, and another in the northeast of the island where there\nare significant hydro resources including Afulilo hydroelectric power scheme and Lalomunga\nscheme.  These  two  generation  centers  are  connected  with  a  radial  single-circuit  33  kV\ndistribution feeder (north coast feeder). The feeder is 32 kilometers (km) long and connects the\nswitchyards at Lalomunga (northeast) and Tanugamanono (Apia). The 33 kV feeder does not\nhave 33 kV switchgear and relies on 22 kV switching. The feeder is connected to the 22-kV\ndistribution by 6 megavolt-ampere autotransformers. The feeder also supplies some load along\nthe north coast (Solosolo).\n6. In addition to the north coast transmission line, there is a south coast transmission loop\nthat follows the Cross Island Road and South Coast Road to connect the northeast generation\ncenter  (Afulilo  hydropower)  to  the  north  coast  load  center.  This  22-kV  transmission  line\nconnecting generation and load centers is radial and therefore vulnerable to load disturbances.\nAny outage of the radial transmission line connecting the Afulilo hydroelectric scheme to the\nload center has the potential to totally black out the system. This south coast transmission loop", "56\nAppendix 13, page 2\nwill need to be upgraded to accommodate transmission of the increased power output from the\nproposed Afulilo Augmentation Project to the major load center.\n7. Energy losses, defined as the percentage difference between gross energy generated\nand energy sold, have been high in the past several years. The reported total energy loss was\n15.2 percent in 1994/95, 18.8 percent in 1995/96, 17.1 percent in 1997/98, 16.0 percent in\n1998/99, and 15 percent in 1999/2000. These losses are relatively high, compared with those in\nneighboring Pacific island countries.\n8. The EPC power system has experienced frequent power outages. In 1995/96 ending\nJune 30, 88 power outages occurred. The number dropped down to 77 in 1997, 66 in 1998, and\n49 in 1999, respectively. In 2000, the total number of power outages went back to 77.\nB. Objectives\n9. The purpose of this technical assistance (TA) is to assist EPC in strengthening its\ntechnical management capacity so as to improve its technical performance and asset utilization\nefficiency.  The  objectives  are  (i)  to  improve  EPC\u2019s  maintenance  capacity  to  reduce  the\nfrequency and duration of power outages and maintenance costs, and (ii) to strengthen EPC\u2019s\ncapacity to reduce energy loss in a cost-effective manner.\nC. Scope\n10. The TA covers the following tasks:\n1.  Maintenance Capacity Building\n(i) Assess EPC\u2019s current maintenance practices. The task is to review\nthe  current  practices  and  procedures  of  EPC  in  maintaining  the\ngeneration plants and transmission/distribution systems on both Upolu\nand  Savai'i  islands,  and  assess  their  strengths  and  weaknesses\ncompared with the best practices in the industry.\n(ii) Make  appropriate  recommendations  for  improving  EPC\u2019s\nmaintenance practices and procedures. Based on the results of task\n(i), appropriate recommendations will be developed for EPC to improve its\nmaintenance  practices  including,  but  not  limited  to,  maintenance\nplanning,  scheduling,  parts  inventory,  asset  identification  and  data\nmanagement, implementation, data and record keeping, reporting, and\ntraining.\n(iii) Review  available  software  packages  for  maintaining  the  power\nsystems and their applicability to EPC, and recommend the software\npackage that is best suited to EPC. Personal computer-based software\npackages  commercially  available  will  be  reviewed;  the  applicability  to\nEPC\u2019s power system \u2013 the input, computer systems, and skills required to\nrun the software evaluated; and the cost of purchasing and maintaining\nthe software determined. Consistent with the recommendations of task\n(ii), this task will recommend the software package that is most suitable to\nEPC. The costs of purchasing and commissioning the software, computer\nhardware, and training requirements will also be estimated.", "57\nAppendix 13, page 3\n(iv) Install  and  test  the  software,  and  train  the  EPC  staff.  This  task\ninvolves installing the recommended software, inputting all the necessary\ndata, testing the software, interpreting the results, and training EPC staff\non  using  the  software.  (This  task  is  dependent  on  whether  the\ncontingency  fund  is  adequate  for  purchasing  and  commissioning  the\nsoftware and staff training.)\n2.  Energy Loss Reduction Assessment and Strategy\n(i) Review the historical energy loss data. EPC\u2019s energy loss data in the\npast five years will be reviewed, the sources of the data analyzed, and the\naccuracy of the reported data evaluated.\n(ii) Evaluate  EPC\u2019s  practices  on  metering.  EPC\u2019s  practices  on  meter\ntesting and calibration will be analyzed and the validity of the reported\nmetered data determined. This task will address both the metering of the\ngeneration output and the sales to end-use consumers.\n(iii) Evaluate the DigSilent power flow software.

The financial and economic analyses of the Project examined the benefits of additional\npower  generation  from  the  Project  against  the  total  project  cost.  In  addition,  a  least-cost\neconomic analysis was conducted to demonstrate that the Project is less expensive than the\nalternative diesel generation. The switching values related to key parameters of the economic\nas well as least-cost analysis were also calculated.\nB.  Methodologies\n2. In the economic and financial analyses, the benefits of the Project are estimated based\non the additional power generation throughout the project life. All the costs are expressed in\n2001 terms. The financial benefits were computed by multiplying the forecast net generation\n(after adjustment of energy loss) by the average system tariff  in present value of cents per\nkilowatt-hour (kWh) in each year of the project life. The current average electric tariffs are used\nin evaluating the financial benefits.\n3. The  Project  is  designed  to  meet  a  combination  of  nonincremental  and  incremental\ndemand. The economic benefits were calculated based on a per-unit weighted average of the\ntwo  demands  (nonincremental  and  incremental).  For  estimating  incremental  benefits,  the\ncurrent average tariff was used as a proxy for the consumers' willingness to pay for electricity.1\nThe nonincremental benefits are estimated as resource cost savings on the existing alternative\nsources of energy. For this estimation, the assumptions used follow: (i) domestic and small\ncommercial customers account for approximately 60 percent of the Electric Power Corporation\n(EPC)'s total electricity sales and their main use for electricity is lighting; (ii) the alternative\nsource of lighting is kerosene, which costs ST1.38 per liter, or $0.4237 per liter; and (iii) the\nequivalent conversion rate is 0.6 liter per kWh. Thus, the economic cost of kerosene fuel is\nestimated to be $0.2542 per kWh. Adding 5 percent to account for owning and maintaining\nkerosene lamps, the total economic cost of kerosene is $0.2669 per kWh.\n4.  Industrial and medium-size and large commercial customers account for the remaining\n40 percent of EPC's electricity sales. The alternative source of energy for these customers is\nsmall diesel engines (1\u20133 kW). The fuel costs $0.385 per liter, and the conversion rate is 3.8\nkWh per liter. Thus, the economic fuel cost is $0.1013 per kWh. The capital, annual operation\nand maintenance (O&M) costs of the small diesel engines is assumed to be 30 percent of the\nfuel costs.2 Thus, the total economic cost of this alternative source of energy is $0.1317/kWh.\n5. The weighted average economic cost of an alternative source of energy is $0.2022\n/kWh, which reflects a 0.953 conversion factor for tradable costs. The proposed Project is\ndesigned to meet a combination of incremental and nonincremental demand with an assumed\nsplit of 50/50. Thus, the overall weighted unit economic benefit of the Project will be 50 percent\nof  the  willingness  to  pay  (=$0.184/kWh  x  0.9  (conversion  factor))  plus  50  percent  of  the\n                  \n1 The average tariff was used as a proxy for the consumers' willingness to pay for electricity. This is a conservative\nassumption as the consumer surplus associated with electricity use was not included.\n2 This is also a conservative assumption as the generators would  be run infrequently, the total output (kWh) would be\nsmall,  and the unit production cost ($/kWh) would be high.\n3  The conversion factor equal to 0.95 reflects the shadow price of imported goods (kerosene lamps, kerosene, etc.)\nand the shadow price of local transport.", "60\nAppendix 14, page 2\neconomic  cost  of  consumers'  alternative  sources  of  energy  (=$0.2022/kWh),  that  is\n$0.1839/kWh.\n6. In the least-cost analysis of the Project against an alternative of diesel generation, the\ntotal life-cycle costs of the Project and the alternative were used. The total life-cycle costs\nincluded all the capital costs, O&M, and mitigation costs throughout their respective lives. For\nthe Project, the costs of all mitigating measures included the building of a new water supply\nsystem and a new bridge, land compensation, and environmental monitoring programs.\nC.  Cost Assumptions\n1.  Project Costs\n7. The costs used in the analysis were the Project total life-cycle costs including all the\ncapital and O&M costs expressed in 2001 terms. The capital cost for the financial internal rate of\nreturn (FIRR) was estimated after deducting interest during construction and price contingencies\nfrom the total project cost of $7.50 million (Appendix 8 gives project cost details).\n8. The capital cost for computing the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated\nafter deducting taxes and duties from the financial capital cost and converting local nontradable\ncosts to border prices at a standard conversion factor of 0.80.4 The resulting total economic cost\nof the Project was estimated at $5.67 million.\n9. The Project was assumed to have an economic life of 30 years with no residual value at\nthe end of the period. The schedule of disbursement was assumed to be 80 percent in the first\nyear and 20 percent in the second year. The O&M costs were assumed to be 1 percent of the\ncapital costs of the Project in each year of its economic life.\n10. The economic and financial analyses of the Project included an allowance for system\ntransmission  and  distribution  loss  that  is  assumed  to  be  reduced  to  12  percent  by  2006.\nBecause  the  project  cost  already  includes  $2.2  million  for  project-related  transmission,  no\nadditional cost of other system transmission and distribution development is considered.\n2.  Diesel Generation Alternative Costs\n11. The capital cost of diesel generation is estimated at $670 per kW installed. FY2000 fuel\nprices for alternative diesel power plant were based on the forecast fuel prices including local\ntransportation  costs.  In  the  EIRR  analysis,  local  transportation  and  handling  costs  were\nconverted to border terms by excluding taxes and duties and by applying a standard conversion\nfactor of 0.8. Fuel efficiency was assumed to be 3.8 kWh per liter of diesel oil, the EPC fuel\nefficiency target for 2001. The economic life of the diesel generator was assumed to be 15\nyears.\nD.  Results of Least-Cost Analysis\n12.  The  least-cost  analysis  result  shows  an  economic  equalizing  discount  rate  of  14.6\npercent (Table A14.1). At a discount rate of 12 percent, the long-term marginal cost of the kWh\nproduced by the Project was computed to be $0.07/kWh against $0.11/kWh by the alternative\n                  \n4  The conversion factor equal to 0.80 reflects the weighted average between local unskilled-semiskilled labor cost\nwith a conversion factor lower than 0.60 and imported materials with a conversion factor higher than 0.95.", "61\nAppendix 14, page 3\ndiesel  power  plant.  The  switching  points  between  the  Project  and  the  equivalent  diesel\nalternative would be if (i) project costs were 42 percent higher, or (ii) the diesel alternative\u2019s\ncosts were 30 percent lower.\nE.  Results of Financial and Economic Evaluation\n13. The FIRR for the Project for the base case was estimated at 18.0 percent in real terms\n(Table A14.2). This compares satisfactorily with the real weighted average cost of capital of 2.8\npercent for the Project.5 The EIRR for the project for the base case was estimated at 22.0\npercent in real terms (Table A14.3), which is above the normative 12 percent opportunity cost of\ncapital for Samoa.\n14. Sensitivity analyses for FIRR and EIRR shown6 in Tables A14.4 and A14.5 demonstrate\nthat the Project is robust and remains financially and economically viable even with adverse\nmovements in some parameters such as lower project benefits, increase in capital cost, and\ndelay in project implementation.\n                  \n5 The Project will be financed 80 percent by debt-carrying interest rate of  5.0 percent in nominal terms, i.e., 2.5\npercent in real terms, after allowing for long-term annual inflation of 2.5 percent. The remaining 20 percent financed\nfrom internal resources is assumed to have a return  in real terms of 4.0 percent. The weighted average cost of\ncapital for the Project works out to be 2.8 percent in real terms.\n6  Exchange rate variations will change the cost of the imported components of the capital cost. Thus, sensitivity on\nexchange rate variations are reflected in the sensitivity analysis to the capital cost increase.", "Table A14.1: Financial Equalizing Discount Rate\n14.6%\nAfulilo Augmentation
