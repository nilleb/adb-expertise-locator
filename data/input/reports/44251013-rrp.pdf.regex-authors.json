I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach and (ii) a proposed policy-based loan for subprogram 1, both to the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Financial Sector Deepening Program (FSDP). \n \n2.  The proposed FSDP will support initiatives under the Socio-Economic Development \nStrategy (SEDS), 2011\u20132020 to increase the role of the nonbank financial sector and deepen \nthe financial markets in Viet Nam. In line with the country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132015 for \nViet Nam, the FSDP aims to strengthen the legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks and \nmarket infrastructure to sustain the financing of productive investment.1 The FSDP is included in \nthe country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 for Viet Nam and will support the government \nin transitioning the country into a modern, productive, and equitable market-based economy.2 \nThe FSDP and its supporting project preparatory technical assistance (TA) will support the \ndevelopment of a well-functioning money market and a deeper and more liquid capital market, \nand it will improve the capacity of public and private institutions in the nonbank financial sector.3 \nThese focus areas have been discussed with all relevant government agencies, market and \nindustry associations, and development partners. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The government\u2019s reform programs have helped the country reach lower middle-income \nstatus.4 However, Viet Nam is now at a critical juncture and needs to sustain its development \nprogress. The government aspires to achieve a higher middle-income status, with per capita \nincome of at least $3,000, along with significant improvements in human development and \npoverty reduction by 2020. To meet these goals, the SEDS focuses on structural reforms, \nenvironmental sustainability, social equity, and macroeconomic stability. The government has \nidentified financial sector development as a key aspect of the reform agenda, which underlies all \nof these focus areas. Recognizing this, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has adopted a \n\u201cwhole-of-sector\u201d  approach  to  support  financial  sector  development  in  Viet  Nam  based  on \nongoing policy dialogue and regular financial sector assessments. The FSDP will complement \nand support interrelated and reinforcing effects to provide greater macroeconomic stability, \nincrease the availability of credit to the corporate sector and small businesses, and facilitate \nstructural reforms. The recent Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) reconfirmed the \nneed to prioritize the development of Viet Nam\u2019s financial sector to support bank recapitalization \nand to facilitate the restructuring of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).5  \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s comprehensive financial sector engagement. ADB has supported financial \nsector development in Viet Nam with three successive clusters of financial sector program loans \n(FSPLs). FSPL1 supported the introduction of basic concepts and systems that represent the \nprerequisites to developing a market-based financial system and economy.6 FSPL2 marked the \n                                                \n1    ADB. 2012.

", "2 \n \nbeginning of ADB\u2019s emphasis on development of the nonbank financial sector. Building on the \nwork started under FSPL1, the program strengthened capital markets, institutional investors, \nand  nonbank  financial  intermediaries.7  FSPL3  sought  to  increase  alternative  channels  for \nmarket-based financial intermediation.8 The program enhanced the securities issuance process, \nincreased  the  supply  and  quality  of  assets  available  to  investors,  and  supported  the \nestablishment of a Public Debt Management Office. These programs have been buttressed by a \nbroader range of initiatives  benefiting from ADB support, such as the Asian Bond  Market \nDevelopment Initiative. A wide range of bilateral and multilateral donors are also active in this \nsector, including the World Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency, which \nprovide substantial levels of assistance to the banking sector.9 \n \n5.  ADB is providing parallel targeted assistance to support and increase access to finance. \nThe  Second  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprise  (SME)  Development  Program  provides \nmeasures to promote SME development, strengthen the framework for competition policy, and \nenhance SME access to finance.10 At the same time, ADB is supporting the government\u2019s \nefforts to restructure SOEs. This program, which depends in large part on financial sector \nreform, aims to reduce the dominance of inefficient state production, promote private sector \ndevelopment,  and  enhance  economic  growth  by  freeing  up  financial  resources  to  more \nproductive  uses.  Under  the  SOE  Reform  and  Corporate Governance  Facilitation  Program, \nparticipating  SOEs  will  be  restructured  under  a  comprehensive  package  of  corporate  and \nfinancial reforms.11 This initiative builds on an earlier ADB engagement that developed an \nenabling environment, including the creation of a centralized government institution to formulate, \ncoordinate, and lead the implementation of SOE reform.  \n \n6.  Positive but measured results. ADB financial sector programs have contributed to the \nemergence of a nascent yet fast-growing financial sector. Viet Nam\u2019s total local currency bonds \noutstanding grew 26.8% year-on-year to reach D578 trillion as of end-June 2013, similar to the \n28.5% year-on-year increase recorded in June 2012. In fact, year-on-year Viet Nam was the \nfastest growing local currency bond market in emerging East Asia in the second quarter of \n2013.12 While private sector issuance has recently slowed, local currency corporate bonds \nincreased to 0.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in June 2013 from zero in June 2007. \n \n7.  The growth of the stock exchanges has far exceeded the government's initial target for a \ncombined market capitalization of 10% of GDP by 2010. Combined stock market capitalization \nhas increased to 23% of GDP as of the end of 2012, from zero in 2002. The Ho Chi Minh City \nStock Exchange began operations in 2000 with just two listed companies. By 2012 it had grown \nto  308  listed  stocks  and  a  total  market  capitalization  of  D678  trillion.  The  Ha  Noi  Stock \nExchange  (HNX)  opened  in  July  2005  with  six  listed  companies.  At  year-end  2012,  HNX \nreported 396 listed stocks, 448 listed government bonds, 18 listed  treasury bills, and 132 \n                                                \n7   ADB. 2002.

", "3 \n \nregistered over-the-counter stocks (Unlisted Public Company Market). A contractual savings \nindustry has also begun to emerge as a precursor for an enlarged investor base. While the \ncommercial insurance market in Viet Nam only began in 1993, the market has grown rapidly in \nterms of premiums, products on offer, and diversity. Penetration rates at 1.4% of GDP are \ncomparable to those of Indonesia and the Philippines.  \n \n8.  Accordingly, the country assistance program evaluation recorded a borderline successful \noverall finance sector assistance rating for Viet Nam over the period 1999\u20132008.13  In particular, \nthe  country  assistance  program  evaluation  described  ADB\u2019s  engagement  as  a  logical \nsequencing  of  reforms  beginning  with  the  basic  frameworks  and  then  expanding  to  more \ncomplex  reforms.  Likewise,  the  special  evaluation  study  on  ADB  Assistance  for  Domestic \nCapital Market Development rated ADB\u2019s capital markets assistance in Viet Nam successful.14 \nADB\u2019s assistance was regarded as highly selective and well sequenced, while benefiting from \nsubstantial aid coordination. However, both studies recognized that the establishment of a \nsound financial system and capital markets is a long-term process and that Viet Nam was likely \nto require more time and additional capacity development support to be able to move towards \nfull compliance with international standards.  \n \n9.  This  observation  was  further  validated  during  program  implementation.  Preliminary \nassessments indicate that as FSPL3 began calling for increasingly complex reforms, difficulties \nin  managing  the  required  coordination  between  government  agencies  produced  protracted \nimplementation periods. For example, the government is only now beginning to address the \nneed to recapitalize the banking sector and restructure SOEs, both of which are needed to \nprovide incentives for capital market development. In addition, the scale of TA provided to \nsupport early programs proved insufficient. These issues manifested themselves through the \nemergence  of  compliance-based  program  implementation  in  which  policy  reforms  were \nimplemented and documented, and yet lacked effectiveness.  \n \n10.  Remaining  challenges.  The government  has recognized  that  a more focused  and \nsustained effort is required to deepen Viet Nam\u2019s financial sector and to sustain the financing of \neconomic development. The money market remains small and extremely fragmented. Turnover \nis low and tenors are very short. Activity has been constrained by restrictive regulations, a lack \nof an enabling infrastructure, and the inability of participants to obtain qualitative and reliable \ncredit assessments. Standardized agreements have not been adopted by the private sector, \nsuch as in the case of repos, and transparency is poor. Until these issues are addressed, \nmacroeconomic stability will remain elusive as authorities are forced to rely on less efficient \npolicy tools such as control of the monetary base.  \n \n11.  Viet Nam remains one of the smallest debt markets of emerging East Asia in terms of \nGDP and size. During  2009, the  local currency bond market stagnated due to the  global \nfinancial  crisis. When  combined  with  the  overlay  of  other  structural  impediments, such  as \ninterest rate caps, issuance became problematic for all but the shortest maturities. At the end of \nthe second quarter of 2013, the total local currency bond market represented only 14.8% of \nGDP,  well  below  the  overall  average  of  54.3%  for  emerging  East  Asia.  Bond  market \ndevelopment will be constrained in the absence of proper hedging mechanisms and instruments \nas these key risk management tools are necessary to support the development of market \nmakers. Moreover, the contractual savings industry has not been supported with a development \n                                                \n13  ADB. 2009.

Over the short term (2010\u20132013), the government \nintroduced a number of initiatives aimed at strengthening the legal framework and providing an \nenabling environment to support the development of a short-term money market. As part of this \neffort, the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) will coordinate with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and \nother stakeholders to introduce standardized repurchase agreements and to study the feasibility \nof launching alternative money market instruments. The SBV will increase the transparency of \ncentral bank operations within the money market. Over the longer term, the government will \nattempt to solve some of the more challenging issues, such as the SBV\u2019s independence and \nlegal mandate. \n \n13.  The MOF and State Securities Commission (SSC) have completed the Sector Road \nMap for the Strategic Development of the Vietnamese Capital Market, which covers the years \n2011\u20132020. This document serves as a master plan for long-term capital market development \nand addresses bottlenecks that impede its growth. A bond market development road map has \nbeen  approved  and  adopted  that  includes  both  quantitative  and  qualitative  targets.  The \ngovernment plans to increase outstanding local currency bonds to 38% of GDP by 2020 from \n18% of GDP in 2011. A mechanism will be created to link treasury and debt management to \nensure predictable, pre-announced debt auctions. The government also plans to develop a \nprimary dealer system and to lay the foundations for market makers in both the primary market \nand  secondary  market.  By  identifying  benchmark  issues  and  lengthening  maturities,  the \ngovernment will begin building a risk-free yield curve to establish reference rates. An enabling \nenvironment will be provided to develop the corporate bond market as well as the establishment \nof a domestic credit rating agency. These efforts will be backstopped by a road map to develop \nthe insurance industry as a source of demand for capital market products. \n \n14.  To  complement  its  overarching  objectives,  the  SEDS  provides  for  comprehensive \ncapacity development throughout the financial sector, including for the SBV and MOF.16 The \nstrategy initially focuses on preparing the necessary conditions to implement comprehensive \nhuman resources development and training activities, which are necessary to support more \ncomplex policy reforms. From 2015 to 2020, the government will restructure training activities \nfor the whole financial sector, including university education. To strengthen the underlying \ninfrastructure of the financial sector, the government will establish an accounting and audit \nsystem  that  is  compatible  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  circumstances  as  well  as  regional  and  global \nstandards, including the adoption of market or fair value. Mark-to-market is instrumental in \nproviding incentives to encourage discipline through risk management and the development of \nkey technical skills. Efforts will also be made to upgrade the clearing and settlement system and \nto establish a central clearing counterparty. \n \n15.  The proposed program. The design of the FSDP has incorporated the lessons learned. \nFinancial sector development is recognized as hierarchical and requires careful sequencing to \nsafeguard monetary and financial stability.17 Further, prior ADB programs indicate that program \neffectiveness is enhanced when reforms begin with the basic building blocks and are backed by \ncomprehensive  TA.  ADB\u2019s  experience  also  indicates  that  the  effectiveness  of  the  reforms \n                                                \n15   Summary Sector Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n16  Decision 219/QD-NHNN of 9 February 2012; the Human Resource Development Master Plan for the banking \nsector over 2011\u20132020. \n17  International Monetary Fund. 2003.

", "5 \n \nshould be fully demonstrated before introducing more complex reforms. Therefore, the FSDP \nwill utilize a programmatic approach, with 2 subprograms to narrow and refocus a sustained \neffort to develop a money market and a capital market, emphasizing government debt as the \nbasic  building  blocks  of  effective  macroeconomic  management  and  financial  sector \ndevelopment. The FSDP will also support capacity development in recognition of the key role \ntechnical  and  management  skills  play  in  implementing  reforms,  maintaining  stability,  and \nfostering investor confidence.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The impact of the FSDP will be an expanded level of nonbank financing, which will be \nreflected, in part, through growth of local currency debt markets relative to GDP. The outcome \nwill be strengthened investor confidence.   \n \nC.  Outputs \n17.  To achieve the envisioned impact and outcome, the proposed program is designed to \nsupport the government in bringing about the following outputs: (i) a well-functioning money \nmarket, (ii) a deeper and more liquid capital market, and (iii) strengthened capacity of public and \nprivate institutions in the nonbank financial sector. Subprogram 1 contains 32 policy actions, all \nof which have been completed. The design and monitoring framework is provided in Appendix 1 \nand the policy matrix in Appendix 4.18 \n \n18.  Output 1: A well-functioning money market. To increase liquidity and accelerate the \ndevelopment  of  the  interbank  market,  the  SBV  and  MOF  have  significantly  enhanced \ncoordination and information exchange through the adoption of a comprehensive memorandum \nof understanding that covers, among other areas, the development and supervision of the \nmoney market. Within this framework, the SBV has established a Money Market Working Group \n(MMWG) to implement a Money Market Development Master Plan. The MMWG is headed by a \ndeputy governor and is supported by a comprehensive terms of reference that governs the \nparticipation of a broad group of stakeholders.19 Under this cooperative framework, the SBV and \nMOF  have  agreed  to  coordinate  the  issuance  of  short-term  debt  to  eliminate  overlapping \nmaturities. The MMWG, through the SBV, has issued regulations governing loans secured by \nthe mortgage of valuable papers and the discount and rediscount of valuable papers by the \nSBV. The MMWG has strengthened the code of conduct for the foreign exchange interbank \nmarket.  Regulations  covering  brokerage  activities  have  been  improved.  Preparations  to \nintroduce a formal repo market have begun, which will include initiatives to introduce netting to \nreduce systemic credit risk.  \n \n19.  To  increase  transparency  and  price  discovery,  short-term  government  debt  with  a \nmaturity of 1 year or less is now traded on HNX. The SBV is collating information on local \ncurrency interbank transactions and publishing basic transactional data on its external website. \nThe SBV has further improved transparency by publishing basic data on monetary and banking \noperations and has strengthened bank liquidity standards.  \n \n20.  Output  2:  A  deeper  and  more  liquid  capital  market.  To  further  develop  the \ngovernment debt market, thereby enhancing the private sector\u2019s access to nonbank finance, the \n                                                \n18   Contribution to the ADB Results Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n19  These stakeholders include the Monetary Policy Department, Credit Department, FX Department, Central Banking \nDepartment, Legal Department, and the Ministry of Finance. \n ", "6 \n \nMOF strengthened the legal framework governing the issuance and management of public debt. \nThese guidelines contain measures to control and cap the level of sovereign guarantees. The \nMOF also provided an enhanced mechanism to issue government bonds, including auction \ntiming  and  announcements.  The  MOF  has  continued  its  program  of  large-lot  issuance  to \nfacilitate liquidity in the government bond market and has used switch auctions to reduce the \nnumber of outstanding issues from 185 in 2010 to 102 at the end of the first quarter of 2013. In \naddition, the MOF has taken measures to (i) increase liquidity and trading volumes in the \nsecondary market; (ii) better protect investors by setting guidelines for trading accounts; and (iii) \nprescribing standards and prohibitions for margin, inter-day, and insider trading. \n \n21.  To provide comprehensive direction and measurable performance targets, the MOF \nfinalized the bond market development road map. The MOF rationalized regulations governing \nthe issuance of corporate bonds, streamlined administrative procedures, and increased the level \nof responsibility among potential issuers. In tandem, the MOF strengthened governance by \nissuing enhanced disclosure standards and by adopting the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) corporate governance scorecard.20 \n \n22.  To  strengthen  the  underlying  financial  market  infrastructure,  the  MOF  through  the \nInsurance  Supervisory  Agency,  completed  a  self-assessment  of  compliance  with  the \nAssociation  of  Insurance  Supervisors  Core  Principles,  while  the  SSC  completed  a  self-\nassessment of the implementation of International Organization of Securities Commissions Core \nPrinciples. These self-assessments provided direct support to the recently completed FSAP. \nBoth agencies developed action plans to improve compliance. MOF implemented the Law on \nIndependent Audit by issuing decrees to strengthen the creation and organization of auditing \nenterprises. The decrees further established the necessity of audits and prescribed the content \nof audit reports and files. The SSC and Viet Nam Securities Depository improved customer \nservice and reduced operational risk in the securities settlement process. These initiatives serve \nas a precursor to the eventual transfer of the cash settlement leg of government securities \ntransactions to the SBV. \n \n23.  Output 3: Strengthened capacity of public and private institutions in the nonbank \nfinancial sector. To address the sector-wide capacity deficit, the SBV completed a human \nresources development plan covering the period 2011\u20132020. This plan recognizes the need to \nimprove investor confidence through more effective supervision and regulation. It ensures the \ndevelopment of capacity not just within the SBV but also throughout the banking industry. It \nidentified a wide range of necessary inputs covering academia to internal training programs. To \naddress the sector\u2019s most pressing needs, the SBV is focusing initially on its core operations \nand identified several groups of 40\u201360 staff members for intensive training. A similar program is \nbeing  launched  for  the  banking  sector  which  focuses,  among  others,  on  bank  and  risk \nmanagement, research and development, information technology, credit administration, and \ninternal  audit  and  control.  Concurrently,  the  SSC  completed  a  plan  for  human  resources \ndevelopment covering the medium-term period of 2011 to 2020. From 2011 to 2013, the SSC is \nfocusing on improving the quality of its professionals. From 2014 to 2015, it will strengthen the \nstructure, functions, duties, and powers of its organization. \n \n24.  To strengthen public disclosure in line with international practices, and to strengthen \ninvestor protections, the MOF completed a comprehensive assessment of gaps between Viet \nNam Accounting Standards (VAS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). An \naccounting and auditing strategy and road map has been adopted to strengthen the legal \n                                                \n20   ASEAN Corporate Governance Scorecard. ", "7 \n \nframework, improve the quality of the local industry and self-regulatory organizations, and foster \ngreater international cooperation. Within the accounting and auditing strategy, the MOF has \nbegun  strengthening  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  which  will  lead  to  the  eventual \nrecognition  of  market  or  fair  value  accounting.  Likewise,  the  MOF,  through  the  Insurance \nSupervisory Agency, has reviewed the amended Law on Insurance Business to identify gaps \nfrom international sound practice. This review is serving as a benchmark to begin the eventual \nimplementation of Solvency 1 for the insurance sector.21 \n \n25.  Subprogram 2. Recognizing the long-term nature of financial sector development and \nthe  unique  and  challenging  nature  of  the  Vietnamese  market,  subprogram  2  contains  45 \nindicative policy actions designed to build on the accomplishments of subprogram 1. The SBV \nand MOF will continue to coordinate to further deepen the short-term yield curve, and legislation \nwill be proposed to introduce interest rate derivatives. New money market instruments, including \nthe possible development of a standardized repurchase agreement, will be introduced. The \nMOF will implement the bond market development road map and will further strengthen the \nprimary  government  issuance  process.  The  government  will  align  local  standards  to \ninternational standards by increasing compliance with the Association of Insurance Supervisors \nCore Principles and the International Organization of Securities Commissions Core Principles. \nThe government will take steps to introduce fair value accounting. The SSC and SBV will \nimplement their human resources development plans.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n26.  In 2013, the government will need to borrow D162 trillion to cover a budget deficit \ntargeted at 4.8% of GDP. In 2012, deficit financing was obtained from domestic sources (44%) \nand external sources (56%), of which some 84% was accounted for by official development \nassistance (ODA). Assuming a similar distribution for 2013, the government will borrow an \nestimated $3.7 billion through ODA to close the budget gap. The size of the loan primarily \nreflects the government financing needs. Secondary considerations include the strength of the \nreform program and the costs of implementation.22 For example, the government will absorb \nincreased issuance costs with the ongoing extension of government maximum bond tenors to \n15  years  from  10  years.  In  addition,  the  transfer  of  the  cash  settlement  leg  of  securities \ntransactions to the SBV  will encompass significant capital expenditures. Under  the FSDP, \ntraining budgets in both the MOF and SBV will be increased significantly to provide for higher \nlevels of technical expertise and larger staff numbers. The SSC alone has projected an increase \nin  staff  count  to  1,000  by  2015  from  the  current  level  of  400.  A  recently  completed \ncomprehensive skills gap assessment indicates the SBV will require $20 million for training \ncosts over the program period.23 \n \n27.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR29,238,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan \nwill have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be disbursed in accordance with the \nprovisions of ADB's Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for \nProgram Loans.24 Subprogram 2, with an indicative amount of $70 million, will be subject to \n                                                \n21   Solvency 1 is the name given to changes to the EU's insurer solvency regime made in 2002.

The policy matrix given in Appendix 4 indicates the \nprogram framework, including the 32 policy actions completed prior to Board consideration for \nsubprogram 1, and those proposed for subprogram 2.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n28.  The FSDP comprises two single-tranche subprograms. Subprogram 1 covers July 2010 \nto August 2013. Subprogram 2 covers September 2013 to June 2015. To reduce compliance-\nbased program implementation, emphasis will be placed on the achievement of tangible results. \nThe executing agency for the FSDP will be the SBV; the implementing agencies will be the \nMOF,  SSC,  HNX,  and  SBV.  The  MMWG  acts  as  a  coordination  mechanism  for  the \nimplementation  of  the  Money  Market  Development  Master  Plan,  meeting  biannually  and \nproviding a ready mechanism through which the government can bring various stakeholders \ntogether to implement reforms, which will become increasingly more challenging going forward.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n29.  A growing body of empirical research produces a remarkably consistent narrative: the \nservices  provided  by  the  financial  system  exert  a first-order  impact  on  long-run  economic \ngrowth. Building on work by Bagehot (1873), Schumpeter (1912), Gurley and Shaw (1955), \nGoldsmith (1969), and McKinnon (1973), recent research has employed different econometric \nmethodologies  and  data  sets  in  producing  three  core  results.25  Levine  and  Zervos  have \nquantified  this  cost.26  Using  panel  data  from  47  countries  from  1976  through  1993,  they \ndemonstrated  that  stock  market  liquidity  and  banking  development  both  positively  predict \neconomic growth, and that both together, as opposed to separately, provided a larger boost to \nreal GDP per capita. Another study also indicated that contractual savings (e.g., insurance, \nmutual funds, and pensions) play a significant role in fostering economic development.27 This \nsame  research  indicates  that the  boost to  economic  growth  achieved  from  increasing  the \npenetration of life insurance is even more pronounced given higher levels of bank credit to GDP \nand stock market liquidity. In addition, a third study predicted that the positive impact of foreign \ndirect investment on economic growth in Viet Nam will be larger if more resources are invested \nin financial market development.28  \n \nB.  Governance \n30.  Since 2008, ADB has supported efforts to strengthen governance by improving planning \nprocesses, strengthening public financial management and pubic administration, and improving \nlegal transparency and accessibility.29 Public financial management reforms are at an early \nstage, but steady progress is being made. For example, the government has adopted several \n                                                \n25    J. Rosengard and H. Du. 2009.

Under the National External Debt and Public \nDebt Strategy, 2011\u20132020 aggregate public debt information has been published for the first \ntime, but more needs to be done.30 In spite of good tax collection ratios (approximately 26% of \nGDP),  the  determination  of  actual  budget  deficits  is  compromised  by  the  application  of \nstandards different from the Global Financial Statistics in the government\u2019s official accounts. \nFurther efficiency of budget allocations and service delivery requires better linkages between \nmedium-term planning and budgeting and between capital and recurrent expenditures. The \ngovernment is reviewing the 2002 Budget Law to deepen the implementation of the medium-\nterm  expenditure  framework  and  performance-based  budgeting,  and  to  improve  budget \nexecution, monitoring, and implementation. The treasury and budget management information \nsystem is strengthening government budget reporting and accounting. Tax management and \ncustoms modernization reforms are underway, increasing the transparency of administrative \nprocedures and reducing compliance costs for taxpayers. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n31.  The SEDS targets a 7%\u20138% annual economic growth rate, the creation of 8 million new \njobs, and an average annual reduction in the number of poor households of 2%\u20133%. To \naccomplish these goals, the SEDS includes a focus on economic restructuring that is grounded, \nin  part,  on  capacity  and  financial  sector  development.  Under  the  FSDP,  money  market \ndevelopment will help the government better manage inflation through monetary interventions, \nwhile a deeper government bond market will anchor commercial issuance and provide the long-\nterm funding to much needed infrastructure projects and social expenditures. The ongoing \nrationalization of debt management and issuance will complement these efforts, leading to lower \nfinancing costs and increased fiscal space that could be allocated to social development goals. \nThe FSDP also complements subprogram 2 of the Second Small and  Medium Enterprise \nDevelopment Program, which will strengthen regulatory frameworks and enhance access to \nfinance.31 \n \n32.  Moreover, a number of empirical studies have supported the direct relationship between \nfinancial sector development and poverty reduction.32 The link between economic growth and \nfinancial sector development is well known and has been empirically substantiated (para. 29). \nHowever, financial sector development also improves access to finance by reducing information \nand transaction costs. This allows more entrepreneurs, especially those less well-off, to obtain \nexternal finance. For these reasons, the poor will benefit from the FSDP because a deeper and \nmore liquid finance sector will increase access to finance at a lower cost through a greater \nnumber  and  diversity  of  financial  providers  and  financial  products.  Finally,  financial  sector \ndevelopment reduces financial instability,  which is becoming more common in increasingly \nglobal markets, and which has been shown to have a disproportionate impact on the poor. \n  \nD.  Safeguards \n33.  The FSDP will not entail any involuntary resettlement or negatively affect indigenous \npeople or the environment. It is assigned category C for all safeguards categories (involuntary \nresettlement, impact on indigenous people, and environmental impact). \n \n                                                \n30     Government of Viet Nam. 2012.

Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  As a policy-based loan, FSDP is exposed to broader national and macroeconomic risks \nand  risks  associated  with  public  financial  management  and  corruption.    ADB  is  actively \ncoordinating with other development partners to mitigate these risks through policy dialogue to \nsupport  ongoing  efforts  to  enhance  macroeconomic  stability.  Annual  debt  sustainability \nassessments are being conducted to monitor macroeconomic vulnerabilities, and the ADB is \nproviding  technical  assistance  to  strengthen  both  public  financial  management  and  debt \nmanagement. Among other initiatives, ADB will mitigate corruption risks through policy dialogue, \nincreased  monitoring  and  support for  select  transparency  initiatives.  Program-specific risks \ninclude  a  possible  decline  in  political  will  to  implement  technically  difficult  reforms,  and \nprotracted or inadequate efforts to advance SOE reform and bank recapitalization which could \nresult in a loss of investor confidence. The policy goals of SEDS 2011\u20132020 and the recent \ncompletion of Viet Nam\u2019s first FSAP provide evidence of the government\u2019s commitment to \nreform. Under an ongoing project, ADB is supporting the restructuring of selected SOEs through \na process which can be replicated.33 In addition, the government has taken steps to address \nbanking  sector  vulnerabilities  by  establishing  an  asset  management  company,  resolution \nstrategies, and authorizing higher levels of foreign ownership. Specific risks and corresponding \nmitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan..34 \n  \nIV.  ASSURANCES   \n \n35.  The government and the SBV have assured ADB that implementation of the program \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank and recommend that the \nBoard approve \n \n(i)  the programmatic approach for the Financial Sector Deepening Program, and \n(ii)  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR29,238,000  to  the  Socialist \nRepublic  of  Viet  Nam  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Financial  Sector  Deepening \nProgram, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the \nrate of 2% per annum during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 \nyears, including a grace period of 5 years, and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n12 November 2013\n                                                \n33  ADB. 2009.
