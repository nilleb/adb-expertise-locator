An  environmental \nimpact  assessment  was \nundertaken.  The  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  was \ncirculated to the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and uploaded on the ADB website on 16 November 2006. \n \nThe Project is a key environmental improvement and management \ninitiative of the Hefei municipal government (HMG) to meet national \nenvironmental  guidelines  and  ensure  Hefei\u2019s  sustainable  growth. \nThe Project will bring tangible benefits to the environment of Hefei, \nthe  capital  of  Anhui  province,  by  (i)  enhancing  the  quality  of  its \nwater  resources,  (ii)  strengthening  the  wastewater  treatment \nfacilities  and  sewer  networks,  (iii)  reducing  the  incidence  and \ndamage  of  flooding  in  three  rivers  and  Chao  Lake,  and  (iv) \nimproving  the  urban  air  quality  and  reducing  road  accidents  and \nvehicular emissions through a more efficient city road network and \nintegrated \nin  a  model \ndevelopment  zone.  The  Project  also  will  provide  institutional \ncapacity-building  measures  in  urban  environmental  management \nand  policy  reforms  to  ensure  sustainability  of  the  Project  and \nrelated facilities.  \n \nThe  Project  has  three  components:  (i)  wastewater  and  waste \nmanagement, (ii) river rehabilitation and flood control improvement, \nand (iii) improved road infrastructure and traffic management in the \nXinzhan  zone.  The  Project  also  provides  for  institutional  capacity \nbuilding  for  project  management  and  operation.  The  Project \nsupports  the  Government\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Program  (2006\u20132010) \nto improve the living conditions and health in the cities of the PRC, \nand  to  promote  their  sustainable  economic  development.  It  is \nclassified  as  a  targeted  intervention  because  it  will  contribute  to \nachieving  Millennium  Development  Goal  7,  Target  10,  which  calls \nfor halving the proportion of people without access to safe drinking \nwater  and  basic  sanitation.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nwater policy and Urban Sector Strategy. \n \nImproving  the  urban  environment  in  Hefei  is  crucial  to  achieving \nlong-term  development \nand  sustaining  HMG\u2019s  medium- \n\ntransport  management  operations \n\nto \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\nincluded  a  multisector  environmental \nobjectives.  HMG  has \nprotection program in the city\u2019s 11th Five-Year Program. It also has \nidentified  a  list  of  priority  projects  for  ADB  financing,  including  the \nproposed  Project,  which  will  improve  wastewater  management, \nflood control, and traffic management in Hefei.  \n \nWater  pollution  and  flooding  are  major  environmental  hazards  in \nHefei.  The  Nanfei  River  cuts  through  the  heart  of  the  city,  flowing \nfrom west to east before turning south to drain into Chao Lake, one \nof the five major freshwater lakes in the PRC. Three tributaries of \nthe  Nanfei  River,  which  flow  through  the  northern  sections  of  the \ncity, are heavily polluted with sewage and wastewater dumped into \nthe tributaries instead of being collected and sent to a wastewater \ntreatment  plant  (WWTP).  The  WWTPs  in  Hefei  lack  sufficient \ncapacity  to  handle  all  of  the  city\u2019s  wastewater,  and  the  sewage \nnetwork is also inadequate. The Nanfei River and its tributaries, as \nthe  Hefei \nthe  northern  end  of  Chao  Lake  within \nwell  as \nmunicipality,  are  prone  to  flooding,  which  affects  the  immediate \nurban  area.  In  addition,  the  filled  and  closed  solid  waste  landfill \nnearby  seeps  wastewater  directly  into  the  river  and  indirectly  into \nthe  groundwater.  Adequate  protection  of  this  landfill  and  disposal \nof seeping wastewater in a WWTP are urgently required.  \n \nMajor traffic jams and flow problems in the city worsen air pollution \nand  traffic  accidents.  To  improve  traffic  flow  and  reduce  vehicular \nemissions, HMG plans to construct expressways and flyovers, and \nupgrade  traffic  signal  networks,  using  its  own  resources.  It  has \nrequested  assistance  from  ADB  to  upgrade  the  road  network  and \ninstall  a  better  traffic  surveillance  system  and  traffic  management \nscheme as a pilot component of the proposed Project in Xinzhan, a \nhigh-growth industrial and residential zone. This area is adjacent to \nthe  main  stations  that  connect  Hefei  with  the  national  railway \nnetworks. The area will form a hub for transport services, including \nbuses, \nfreight  vehicle  operations.  A \nsustainable road safety strategy and vehicle emissions control plan \nwill  be  implemented  in  the  area,  while  the  new  roads  will  be \nprovided with full sewerage and environmental protection systems. \nXinzhan  has  been  developed  to  complement  increasing  demand \nfor  urbanization  in  Hefei.  Industrial  and  manufacturing  growth  in \nthis  area  also  would  help  reduce  poverty  in  the  city  through  the \nprovision of job opportunities. \n \nImpact: The Project aims to improve the urban environment, public \nhealth,  and  quality  of  life  in  Hefei  by  reducing  the  incidence  of \nwaterborne  and  airborne  diseases,  road  accidents,  and  vehicle \nemissions;  and  by  increasing  employment,  and  investment  and \nbusiness opportunities.  \n \nOutcome:  The  Project  seeks \nmanagement, flood control, and transport services in Hefei. \n \n\nimprove  public  wastewater \n\nlogistic  centers,  and \n\nto \n\n\fProject Investment Plan   The Project is estimated to cost the equivalent of $372.36 million, \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nincluding taxes and duties of $24.15 million.  \n \n \n\n \n\nSource \nADB Loan \nLocal Bank Loans \nEnterprise Bonds \nDistrict Government \nHefei Municipal Government \n \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million \nequivalent) \n150.00 \n55.70 \n12.32 \n71.40 \n82.94 \n372.36 \n\n \n% of Total \n\n40.3 \n15.0 \n3.3 \n19.2 \n22.2 \n100.0 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $150  million  to  finance  40.3%  of  the \nproject  cost,  including  financing  charges  during  construction.  The \nGovernment  will  finance  the  balance  through  a  combination  of \nHMG and district government budget sources, domestic loans from \nPRC banks, and enterprise bonds. \n \n\n \nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  ADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $150  million  from  its  ordinary  capital \nresources  under  its  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years;  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; an annual commitment charge \nof 0.35%; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement. \n \nThe  Government  of  the  PRC  will  relend  the  loan  proceeds  to  the \nAnhui  provincial  government,  which  will  onlend  the  loan  proceeds \nto HMG, the Executing Agency, on the same terms and conditions \nas those of the ADB loan. The loan proceeds then will be onlent to \nthe implementing agencies (IAs) for the three physical components \n\u2014  Hefei  Urban  Construction  Investment  Company,  Hefei  Chao \nLake Ecological and Environmental Improvement Construction and \nAdministration Bureau, and Hefei Xincheng State Assets Operating \nCompany\u2014on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB \nloan.  The  end-borrowers  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange  and \ninterest rate variation risks of the ADB loan. \n \nUntil 31 March 2013 \n \n30 September 2012 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nA project leading group will be responsible for project coordination, \nand  will  provide  overall  policy  guidance  during  project \nimplementation.

The  project  management  office  (PMO) \n\n \n\niii\n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nfor  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance,  led  by  the  Hefei \nFinance  Bureau,  will  continue  as  the  PMO  for  the  Project  and \nsecretariat  of  the  project  leading  group.  It  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating  implementation  of  project  activities,  as  well  as \nimplementation of the capacity building component. The three IAs \nwill implement nine subcomponents. Hefei Urban Construction and \nInvestment Holding Company Limited will be responsible for seven \nsubcomponents,  while  Hefei  Chao  Lake  Ecological  and \nImprovement  Construction  and  Administrative \nEnvironmental \nBureau  and  Hefei  Xincheng  State  Assets  Operating  Company \nLimited will be responsible for one subcomponent each. \n \nHefei Municipal Government \n \nGoods  and  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nInternational  competitive  bidding,  national  competitive  bidding,  or \nshopping  procedures  will  be  used  for  procurement,  based  on  the \ncircumstances of each contract package. \n \nAbout  31  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and \n108 person-months of national consulting services will be provided \nto  support  the  PMO  and  IAs  in  project  implementation,  and  in \nmanagement  and  institutional  capacity  building.  The  consultants \nwill cover (i) project management and construction supervision, (ii) \ninformation  system  and  project \nset-up  of  management \nperformance  management \nenvironmental \n(iii) \nmanagement,  (iv)  social  development,  (v)  financial  management, \n(vi)  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  project  assets,  and  (vii) \ninstitutional  strengthening  through  human  resources  development \nand  training.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2006,  as  amended  from \ntime to time). \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  directly  about  2.61  million  people  living  in \nthe  project  area,  of  which  about  5.2%  are  poor  (measured  by  the \nweighted average local urban poverty line of CNY2,760 per year or \nCNY230  ($29.11)  per  month,  which  is  close  to  the  $1  per  day \npoverty  line).  All  the  residents  of  Hefei  will  benefit  indirectly.  The \nliving environment will improve as a result of (i) reduced pollution of \nHefei\u2019s surface water, with water quality improving to at least class \nV  by  2012  with  longer-term  potential  to  be  upgraded  to  class  IV \nand class III; (ii) protection from flooding and elimination of hazards \ndue  to  poor  drainage;  (iii)  10%  reduction  in  the  incidence  of \nwaterborne  and  airborne  diseases  from  2005  levels,  with  a \ncorresponding decline in the number of sick days and expenses for \nmedical  treatment;  and  (iv)  increased  traffic  flow,  better  energy \nefficiency,  and  reduced  waiting  times  as  a  result  of  an  improved \nroad network and an innovative traffic management system, which \nwill  reduce  traffic  accidents,  enhance  productivity,  and  lower \nvehicular emissions.  \n\nsystem, \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual \n\njobs \n\nThe Project will provide 2,830 full-time jobs during construction, of \nwhich  about  60%  will  be  for  the  poor  and  women.  Project \noperations  will  create  1,080  permanent  full-time  jobs  directly  and \nanother  1,730 \nthrough  multiplier  effects,  generating \napproximately  CNY45  million  in  wages  per  year.  Public  health \nbenefits  will  accrue  through  a  reduction  in  the  incidence  of \nwaterborne  and  airborne  diseases,  savings  on  treatment  costs, \nand  improved  workforce  productivity.  The  Project  is  technically \nfinancially  and \nsound,  affordable \neconomically  viable  and  sustainable.  Through  policy  dialogue,  the \nProject will continue to support HMG in tariff reform to ensure cost \nrecovery, and in strengthening the capacities of wastewater utilities \nto become more attractive for eventual private sector participation. \n \n\nthe  beneficiaries,  and \n\nto \n\ntimely \n\ntechnical \n\nfollowing  risks  could  affect \n\nrisks. \nConventional  engineering  designs  with  proven  records  of  reliable \nperformance  will  be  adopted  for  wastewater  management,  landfill \nclosure,  flood  control,  road  construction,  and  traffic  management \nand  associated  landscaping.  During  project  implementation,  the \nconsultants  will  support  the  PMO  and  IAs  to  ensure  delivered \nequipment  and  works  comply  with  the  design  requirements  and \nquality standards.  \n \nThe \nimplementation  and \neconomic viability, and reduce the available benefits of the Project: \n(i) amendments and changes to the Hefei master plans, particularly \nfor  the  Xinzhan  zone,  which  could  delay  the  Project;  (ii)  lack  of \nproper  operation  and  maintenance  of  project \nfacilities;  (iii) \nineffective organizational structures and inadequate capacity of the \nIAs, which could result in inefficient project development and delay \nimplementation;  (iv)  delay  in  the  provision  of  counterpart  funding; \n(v)  failure  of  HMG  to  increase  wastewater  tariffs  to  meet  cost \nland  acquisition  and \nrecovery \nresettlement \nthe  efficient \nissues,  which  could  constrain \nimplementation  of  the  project  works  and  restoration  of  livelihoods \nof affected persons. \n \nRisk  (i)  will  be  mitigated  by  synchronizing  the  project  design  and \nimplementation  schedules  with  other  projects  planned  in  Hefei. \nHMG also has provided specific assurances that are covenanted in \nthe  Loan  Agreement.  Risks  (ii)  and  (iii)  will  be  mitigated  through \nprovision of institutional capacity building for the IAs with support of \nloan  consultants.

The  Project  is  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy (2006\u20132008), water policy, and Urban  Sector Strategy.1 It will help \nthe  PRC  achieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDG)  for  environmental  sustainability  and \nincreased access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. This report is based on the results of \nthe  Loan  Appraisal  Mission,  as  well  as  discussions  with  the  central  and  local  governments, \nrelevant  agencies,  and  community  organizations.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  of  the \nProject is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nSince  the  PRC  initiated  economic  reforms  in  1978,  rapid  urbanization  has  accompanied \n3. \nsignificant economic progress.  The urban population has nearly tripled from about 190 million in \n1980  to  more  than  560  million  in  2005,  and  now  accounts  for  more  than  43%  of  the  national \npopulation.  The  Government\u2019s  Agenda  for  Economic  Reform  and  Social  Development  aims  to \naccelerate urbanization and the development of towns and cities, particularly in metropolitan areas.  \nConsequently,  the  urban  population  is  expected  to  reach  47%  of  the  total  population  by  2010, \nthereby  increasing  the  demand  for  urban  services. 2    The  increasing    urban    population, \nindustrialization,  and  economic  development  are  straining  the  overloaded  infrastructure,  and \ncontributing to widespread pollution and environmental threats in PRC\u2019s cities. Without significant \ninvestment, the urban environment will degrade, economic development will be encumbered, and \npeople\u2019s quality of life will deteriorate. \n \nMunicipal  wastewater  is  a  major  contributor  to  the  pollution  of  PRC  rivers  and  lakes.  In \n4. \n2005, only about 48.4% of urban wastewater was treated, with the remainder discharged raw and \nuntreated into the rivers and lakes. In the seven major river basins,3 41.8% of the water does not \nmeet  PRC\u2019s  class  III  water  quality  standard  and  is  unacceptable  as  a  source  of  municipal  water \nsupply.4 To  reduce  pollution  in  the  country\u2019s  lakes  and  rivers,  a  number  of  actions  are  needed, \nincluding (i) strengthening laws and regulations, (ii) adopting a holistic approach to water resources \nmanagement in river basins, (iii) reducing nonpoint sources of pollution, (iv) continuing investment \nin  the  construction  of  wastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTP),  and  (v)  continuing  institutional  and \nfinancial  management  reforms  to  facilitate  more  balanced  economic  growth  and  environmental \nsustainability.  \n \nIn  PRC\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Program  (FYP)  covering  2006\u20132010,  the  Government  has \n5. \nprioritized addressing environmental issues, including water and air pollution, through policy reform, \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2006.

Class I water is \n\npristine, while class V water is polluted. Class III is the minimum water quality required for municipal water supply. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nincreased investment, and improved urban infrastructure management. Recognizing that adequate \nenvironmental protection and pollution controls are essential for sustainable economic growth, the \nGovernment has made environmental protection a national priority in its development strategy. In \naddition to environmental protection laws and implementing regulations that emphasize prevention, \nthe  \u201dpolluter  pays\u201d  principle,  and  decentralized  environmental  management,  the  Government  has \nundertaken  many  programs,  including  several  for  wastewater  management. 5  Industries  were \nordered  to  treat  wastewater  to  national  discharge  standards  by  the  end  of  2000.  Municipalities \nhave  been  required  under  successive  FYPs  to  address  wastewater  collection,  treatment,  and \ndisposal. Pollution control plans have been developed and implementation started for the key river \nbasins.  Government  policies  require  urban  environmental  pollution  and  ecological  damage  to  be \ncontrolled  by  2010.  Under  recent  state  guidelines,  major  cities,  including  provincial  capitals,  are \nexpected  to  have  wastewater  treatment  rates  of  at  least  80%  by  that  year.6   Furthermore,  the \nGovernment's  economic  and  enterprise  reform  programs  require  that  all  wastewater  projects  be \nfinancially  sustainable  and  capable  of  cost  recovery.  The  State  Environmental  Protection \nAdministration requires all new WWTPs to provide at least secondary wastewater treatment. The \nmandated treatment level depends on the quality of the receiving water.  \n \nImproving road infrastructure, traffic management, and vehicular emission controls are key \n6. \nareas  of  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to  ensure  sustainable  development,  while  protecting  the \nenvironment.  By  the  end  of  2005,  more  than  1.9  million  kilometers  (km)  of  roads  had  been \nconstructed  in  the  PRC  with  a  major  focus  on  expressways.7 Vehicle  ownership  also  has  been \nincreasing rapidly, doubling in the past 10 years to almost 21 vehicles per 1,000 people. If trends \ncontinue, vehicle ownership will quadruple from 2005 levels by 2020. Such rapid growth in vehicle \nownership necessitates adequate transport planning, and improved road and traffic management. \nAlthough  no  specific  urban  road  development  plans  exist  at  the  state  level,  individual  cities  and \nmunicipalities must submit their master plans for urban development, including road infrastructure, \nto the State Council for approval. Local governments also are required to include road safety, traffic \nmanagement, and vehicular emission control schemes in their development plans.  \n \nHefei  municipality,  capital  of  Anhui  province,  is  also  the  commercial  and  industrial  center. \n7. \nWith  a  population  of  about  4.5  million,  the  municipality  includes  four  urban  districts  and  three \ncounties spread over 7,029 square kilometers.8 The topography of the area is dominated by rivers, \nstreams,  and  lakes.  The  Nanfei  River,  a  tributary  of  the  Yangtze  River  and  Chao  Lake  system, \nflows  southeast  through  Hefei  to  Chao  Lake,  one  of  the  five  major  freshwater  lakes  in  PRC. \nAlthough Hefei is hilly, the built-up areas are generally flat with elevations of 12\u201315 meters above \nsea level. Although this is above normal flood height, some low-lying areas along the Nanfei River \nand  its  tributaries  are  prone  to  flooding.  Since  1949,  the  city  has  experienced  18  floods,  four  of \nwhich were disastrous.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n5  The PRC Law on Prevention and Control of Water Pollution was adopted in 1984 and amended in 1996. The law was \npassed to (i) prevent and control water pollution, (ii) protect and improve the environment, (iii) safeguard human health, \nand (iv) ensure the effective use of water resources. The law also (i) sets the standards for water environment quality \nand for the discharge of water pollutants; and (ii) covers the planning, supervision, and management of the prevention \nand control of water pollution. \n\n6  The national guidelines for the construction of municipal wastewater treatment facilities require all major cities to have \na  wastewater  treatment  rate  of  80%  by  2010.

PRC. \n\n7  Ministry  of  Communications  website  (http://www.moc.gov.cn/06jiaotonggk/):  The  length  of  express  highways \n\nconstructed in the previous 5 years (10th FYP) was more than in the 7th, 8th, and 9th FYPs combined. \n\n8  The  population  of  the  four  urban  districts  is  1.75  million,  excluding  an  estimated  floating  population  or  unregistered \n\npermanent residents of about 0.35 million. \n\n\f8. \nHefei  has  grown  rapidly  in  line  with  its  FYPs  and  the  Hefei  Urban  Master  Plan.  The \npopulation  is  expected  to  increase  to  6.3  million  by  2010  and  8.0  million  by  2020.  However,  the \nprovision of basic infrastructure and services has not kept pace with increasing demand. This has \nled to deterioration in the quality of life for urban residents, degradation of the urban environment, \nand  inefficient  economic  development.  Hefei  municipal  government  (HMG)  has  attempted  to \nrelieve  pressure  on  the  city\u2019s  central  commercial  areas  through  further  development  aimed  at \nmanufacturing \nresidential \naccommodation. This urban expansion is expected to benefit areas (i) at risk of seasonal flooding, \n(ii)  in  need  of  basic  infrastructure  services  to  remove  point  sources  of  pollution  and  provide  for \nfuture  wastewater  discharges,  and  (iii)  requiring  an  improved  road  network  and  better  traffic \nmanagement to reduce traffic congestion and vehicular emissions. Appendix 2 provides an urban \nsector analysis. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nresearch  centers,  with  associated \n\nindustries  and  high-tech \n\n9. \nProject  Background.  The  management  of  wastewater,  water  resources,  and  traffic \nmanagement  is  the  key  to  improving  the  urban  environment  by  (i)  reducing  water  pollution;  (ii) \ndecreasing the occurrence of floods; (iii) reducing air pollution; (iv) promoting sustainable economic \ndevelopment; and (v) improving the living conditions and public health of urban residents, including \nthe poor. In the past, the Government was the sole provider of these urban services, which were \nfunded  by  tax  revenues.  Consumers  paid  minimal  or  no  charges.  Over  the  past  decade,  the \nGovernment  has  shifted  towards  a  more  market-orientated  approach,  enterprise  provision  in  the \ndelivery  of  infrastructure  services,  and  a  more  integrated  approach  to  urban  development  and \nenvironmental  management.  Despite  significant  progress,  more  investment  and  improvement  is \nneeded  in  wastewater,  flood  control,  and  traffic  management  systems.  Socioeconomic  surveys \nhave  shown  that  the  public  is  becoming  increasingly  concerned  about  and  more  attuned  to  the \nimpact of wastewater, flooding, and air pollution. Further, the public is increasingly willing to pay for \nthe necessary treatment and environmental improvement. While wastewater companies have been \nestablished in many cities, many are not financially or managerially independent. Tariffs generally \nhave  not  been  increased  enough  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery.  Therefore,  corporate  governance \nneeds  to  be  improved  and  key  personnel  trained,  and  the  enterprises  must  become  more \ncommercially orientated and stronger. \n \nSince  2000,  the  economy  of  Hefei  has  grown  at  an  annual  average  rate  of  13.5%.  The \n10. \ncombination of rapid economic growth, industrialization, and urbanization have led to major urban \nenvironmental  issues  in  Hefei,  including  (i)  acute  shortages  of  wastewater  facilities  and  sewer \npipelines;  (ii)  uncontrolled  leaks  and  pollution  from  a  closed  landfill  site;  (iii)  poor  flood  control \ndesign and planning, and inadequate flood protection measures; and (iv) poor traffic management \nand road quality.9 These problems, in turn, have caused poor water quality in the Nanfei River and \nits  tributaries,  as  well  as  in  Chao  Lake.  Further,  they  have  increased  flooding  and  air  pollution, \nwhich have created health hazards, damaged assets (industries and roads), and contributed to a \ngeneral  deterioration  in  the  quality  of  life  for  residents  of  Hefei  city.  At  the  same  time,  Hefei  is \nfacing  the  problems  of  sustaining  employment  and  income-earning  opportunities,  and  providing \nadequate  health  and  education  services  to  the  growing  population.  Aware  of  the  environmental \ndegradation, HMG has embarked on a multisector environmental protection program that will meet \nnational  environmental  guidelines  and  ensure  Hefei's  sustainable  growth. 10   HMG  also  needs \nassistance to achieve the MDG for environmental sustainability (Goal 7), which aims to halve the \nproportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 \n(Target 10). \n \n                                                 \n9  A problem tree analysis workshop was conducted with all stakeholders to highlight the major environmental issues. \n10 Government policies require controlling urban environmental pollution and ecological damage.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n11. \nProject  Rationale.  Improving  the  urban  environment  by  reducing  water  and  air  pollution, \nand strengthening environmental protection and management in Hefei, is crucial to achieving and \nsustaining the municipality\u2019s medium-term development objectives. To this end, HMG has identified \na  list  of  priority  environment-related  investment  activities,  including  the  proposed  Project,  which \nsupports  the  PRC\u2019s  and  Hefei\u2019s  urban  development  and  environmental  management  objectives. \nThe Project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Water Policy and the recently adopted Water Financing \nProgram,  which  seek  to  improve  urban  water  investments  by  providing  investments  in  water \nsupply, sanitation and wastewater management, and environmental improvement.11 \n \n12.  Water  pollution  and  flooding  are  major  environmental  hazards  in  Hefei.  The  Nanfei  River \ncuts through the heart of the city, flowing from west to east before turning south to drain into Chao \nLake. Three tributaries of the Nanfei River, which flow through the northern sections of the city, are \nheavily polluted with sewage and wastewater discharged into the rivers instead of being collected \nand treated at WWTPs. The WWTPs lack sufficient capacity to handle all of the city\u2019s wastewater, \nand the sewage network is also inadequate. These tributaries are also prone to flooding (every 3\u20135 \nyears),  although  the  Nanfei  River  floods  much  less  frequently  (reportedly  every  20\u201350  years) \nbecause  of  flood  protection  infrastructure.  The  northern  end  of  Chao  Lake  is  prone  to  flooding, \nwhich  affects  the  immediate  urban  area  and  backs  up  the  Nanfei  River  and  its  tributaries.  In \naddition,  a  filled  and  closed  solid  waste  landfill  nearby  is  seeping  waste  directly  into  the  Nanfei \nRiver and indirectly into the groundwater. Adequate protection of this closed landfill and disposal of \nseepage in a WWTP are urgently required. Hence, the Project will bring significant environmental \nbenefits to Hefei by improving water pollution and flood management. \n \n13.  Major  traffic  jams  and  flow  problems  in  Hefei  worsen  air  pollution  and  increase  traffic \naccidents.  To  improve  traffic  flow  and  reduce  vehicular  emissions,  HMG  plans  to  construct \nexpressways,  flyovers,  and  improved  traffic  signal  systems  using  its  own  resources.  HMG  has \nrequested assistance from ADB to upgrade the road network and install a pilot traffic management \nsystem in Xinzhan, a planned high-growth industrial and residential zone. This area is adjacent to \nstations  on  the  railway  network  that  connect  Hefei  with  key  commodities  transfer  points,  which \nsupport  the  movement  of  goods  and  people,  enhance  transport  services  for  low-income  groups, \nand create an integrated and holistic transport system. Industrial and manufacturing growth in the \nXinzhan Zone would help reduce poverty in the city through the provision of job opportunities. The \nplanned ADB assistance in this zone is for the development of a pilot integrated road infrastructure \nand  innovative  traffic  management  system  that  could  be  replicated  later  throughout  Hefei  and \nelsewhere. HMG will provide the remaining infrastructure to the Xinzhan Zone, including electricity, \nwater supply, and sewer and gas transmission lines. \n \nPolicy  Dialogue.  The  Project  will  build  on  and  advance  policy  dialogue  with  the \n14. \nGovernment on (i) integrated urban development and environmental management, (ii) wastewater \nmanagement,  (iii)  upstream  and  basin-wide  pollution  prevention  and  control,  (iv)  improved  flood \nmanagement and control, (v) sustainable urban transport management and road safety, (vi) vehicle \nemission control, (vii) cost recovery and tariff reforms, (viii) governance and anticorruption, and (ix) \nprivate sector participation (PSP). Details of the policy dialogue are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n15. \nHMG  has  endorsed  medium-  to  long-term  urban  development  master  plans  and \nenvironmental  management  programs,  including  measures  to  prevent  and  control  air,  water,  and \n\n                                                 \n11 The Water Financing Program 2006\u20132010 aims to double investments in the Asia and Pacific region and achieve the \nfollowing results: (i) 200 million people with sustainable access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation, (ii) 100 \nmillion  people  with  reduced  risk  of  floods,  (iii)  40  million  people  with  more  productive  and  efficient  irrigation  and \ndrainage  services,  (iv)  integrated  water  resource  management  introduced  in  25  river  basins,  and  (v)  improved  water \ngovernance through national water reforms and capacity development. Targets (i), (ii), and (v) are relevant to the Hefei \nproject. \n\n\fsolid  waste  pollution,  which  have  significant  impacts  on  urban  development.  These  plans  and \nprograms  are  formulated  to  ensure  sustainable  economic  development  without  jeopardizing  the \nenvironment  and  living  conditions  in  Hefei.  Support  for  an  integrated  approach  to  urban \ndevelopment  and  environmental  management  has  been  an  important  element  of  ADB\u2019s  policy \ndialogue  and  operational  activities.  The  focus  for  wastewater  is  the  integrated  management  of \nindustrial  and  domestic  wastewater,  including  on-site  treatment  and  public  sewer  connections. \nADB  has  supported  the  Government\u2019s  wastewater  management  policies,  providing  loans \n(Appendix 3) for wastewater treatment components in more than 15 cities, including Hefei.   \n \nFloods in rapidly growing cities damage urban property and have high recovery costs. The \n16. \nflood  control  system  in  the  PRC  emphasizes  the  use  of  structural  measures  to  reduce  flood \nhazards.  These  measures  are  essential  to  improving  the  security  of  those  living  and  working  in \nflood-prone  areas.  To  mitigate  flood  risks,  nonstructural  approaches  increasingly  are  used, \nincluding  data  acquisition,  flood  forecasting,  flood  warning,  and  response  procedures.  The \ndevelopment  of  flood  protection  measures  for  flood-affected  cities  is  a  local  government \nresponsibility. HMG has prepared the Nanfei River and Chao Lake flood management plan, which \nincludes  a  range  of  structural  and  nonstructural  works  that  take  into  consideration  the  overall \nframework of river basin development and national policy on integrated flood management.  \n \n17. \nSustainable transport planning is central to implementing the Hefei Urban Master Plan. The \ndemand  for  road  space  in  Hefei  is  growing  more  rapidly  than  supply.  Traffic  congestion \nundermines productivity and economic growth, increases energy consumption, worsens air quality, \nand  degrades  the  quality  of  life  of  urban  residents.  The  lack  of  roads  and  traffic  congestion \nincreasingly  is  making  Hefei\u2019s  suburban  and  new  industrial  areas  difficult  to  access,  and  less \nattractive  to  employers  and  residents.  The  limited  road  space  and  inefficient  use  of  traffic \nmanagement  are  creating  safety  concerns  for  drivers,  pedestrians,  and  non-motorized  transport \nusers.12 A well-planned urban road network, combined with an efficient traffic management system \nthat  includes  vehicular  emission  controls,  is  necessary  to  ensure  the  sustainable  development  of \nHefei. It will reduce time lost due to traffic congestion, improve efficiency of energy consumption by \nvehicles, and reduce air pollution. In addition to road infrastructure, the Project has included a pilot \ntraffic management scheme covering traffic control, better user information, road safety and traffic \nenforcement, transport services, maintenance plan, and interagency coordination mechanism. This \nscheme is expected to be replicated in other parts of Hefei and other cities. \n \n18. \nPolicy  dialogue  on  key  reforms  is  a  significant  aspect  of  ADB\u2019s  operations  in  the  PRC  in \nurban  development,  including  water  supply,  sanitation,  waste  management,  and  urban  transport. \nSignificant  progress  has  been  made  in  (i)  introducing  tariff  and  enterprise  reforms,  (ii) \nstrengthening  governance  and  management  of  utilities,  and  (iii)  promoting  PSP.  ADB  has \nsupported  the  tariff  reform  process  through  three  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects,  which  have \ncontributed significantly to water and wastewater tariff reforms and resources conservation.13 The \ntariff  guidelines  include  tariff  calculation  methodologies  that  will  allow  full  cost  recovery,  while \ntaking into consideration affordability and social constraints.  \n \n\n                                                 \n12  Insufficient  roads  and  inefficient  traffic  management  are  the  causes  of  poor  road  safety  records  in  the  PRC.  These \nhave  health,  environmental,  and  social  consequences;  and  significant  implications  for  national  economic  growth \nstrategies. In recognition of this, the United Nations for the first time recently integrated road safety into its policies on \nsustainable development. The problem of road safety is acute in all PRC cities. Road safety also has been recognized \nfor its role in achieving the MDGs.  \n\n13 ADB.  1997.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Water  Tariff  Study.

Manila. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n19. \nThe TA also recommended options for encouraging multichannel investment, including PSP \nin urban wastewater management. A good example of successful PSP is provided by a WWTP in \nHefei that was financed under an earlier ADB project. This WWTP became financially viable as a \nresult  of  tariff  reforms  supported  under  the  ADB  project,  and  subsequently  was  prioritized  for \ninvestment by a Sino-German joint venture.14 In addition, ADB provided a TA to strengthen policy \nreform on the use of market-based instruments to enhance PSP in public utilities, mainly for water \nsupply  and  wastewater  management.  Further,  ADB  provided  a  TA  to  help  the  water  utilities  in \nNanjing develop sustainable access to the private long-term capital finance market.15 The Project \nwill  continue  to  help  HMG  reform  tariffs  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  its  wastewater  utilities  to \nbecome  more  attractive  for  eventual  PSP.  ADB  also  provided  a  TA  for  training  on  traffic  safety, \nplanning, and management.16 \n \n20. \nExternal  Assistance.  External  assistance  to  HMG  for  developing  and  implementing  its \nenvironmental infrastructure has come mainly from ADB, World Bank, Japan Bank for International \nCooperation, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Since 1992, ADB has provided 20 loans totaling $2.3 \nbillion  to  the  PRC  for  urban  development  and  environment  projects  (Appendix  3).  ADB  also  has \nprovided about $42.0 million for more than 60 TA studies to prepare these projects, and to review \nand  study  key  issues  in  water  resources,  urban  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  pollution \ncontrol, and urban transport. \n \n21. \nLessons. In a performance evaluation of a previous wastewater project in Hefei city, ADB \nrated  the  project  highly  successful.17 Lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  urban  development  and \nenvironment projects were considered in policy dialogue with the Government, engineering design \nof the project facilities, and institutional capacity building programs. Lessons from previous projects \nin  Hefei  city  and  Anhui  province  also  were  considered.  First,  strategic  master  plans  need  to  be \nconsistent  and  conform  with  key  urban  sector  issues.  The  Project  includes  several  sector \ncomponents  (wastewater,  flood  protection,  and  traffic  management).  ADB  has  engaged  in \nextensive  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  to  confirm  that  each  project  component  is  in  line \nwith its respective master plan. These include the (i) overall Hefei city master plan, (ii) wastewater \nmanagement  plan,  (iii)  river  basin  management  and  flood  control  master  plan,  and  (iv)  transport \nand  traffic  management  plan.  Second,  cost  recovery  and  tariff  reform  are  important.  The  current \nwastewater tariff generates sufficient revenue to cover the operation and maintenance (O&M) cost \nof the wastewater operations in Hefei, provide the counterpart funding for the Project, and service \nthe  ADB  loan.  During  the  policy  dialogue,  an  agreement  was  reached  to  review  the  tariff  during \nproject  implementation,  and  increase  it  regularly  to  ensure  cost  recovery.  Third,  increased  public \nawareness  is  one  of  the  most  effective  ways  to  improve  the  urban  environment.  In  view  of  this \nlesson, the Project provides for public awareness training on environmental health and protection. \nFourth, the establishment of an effective monitoring mechanism for resettlement implementation is \nimportant to ensure that land approval, compensation, and rehabilitation measures are coordinated \n\n                                                 \n14 Wangxiaoying  WWTP  Phase  II  was  financed  by  ADB.  1996.

These  issues \nwere reviewed in detail during project preparation, and the lessons were incorporated in the project \ndesign. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n23. \nThe impact of the Project is to improve the urban environment, public health, and quality of \nlife  in  Hefei  by  reducing  waterborne  and  airborne  diseases,  road  accidents,  and  vehicular \nemissions;  and  increasing  employment,  investment,  and  business  opportunities.  The  outcome  of \nthe Project will be improved public wastewater management, flood control, and transport services \nin Hefei by  \n \n\nincreasing the wastewater treatment rate from 50% to 80% by 2012;  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nupgrading  the  water  quality  from  much  worse  than  class  V  to  at  least  class  V  in \nBanqiao, Ershibu, and Sili rivers by 2012, with longer-term potential for upgrading to \nbetween class IV and class V by 2015 and eventually to class III;  \n\nreducing  the  probability  of  floods  in  the  Banqiao,  Ershibu,  and  Sili  rivers  from  an \naverage of every 3\u20135 years to 50\u2013100 years by 2011\u20132012;  \n\nreducing  the  probability  of  floods  in  Chao  Lake  from  an  average  of  every  10\u201320 \nyears  to  at  least  every  20  years,  and  reducing  erosion  of  the  lake  bank  and \nimproving the ecological environment of the lake by 2012; and  \n\ncreating a sustainable road transport system that is safe, economically viable, and \nenvironmentally  friendly  in  the  Xinzhan  Zone  by  2012,  resulting  in  increased \nindustrial development, more jobs, and better health and safety.  \n\n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n24. \nThe  Project  has  three  components  and  related  capacity  building,  broken  down  into  10 \nsubcomponents (outputs) and 30 activities, which contribute to and fundamentally support Hefei\u2019s \n11th  FYP  and  beyond.  The  subcomponents  include  improved  wastewater  management  through \nthe construction of WWTPs and expansion of the sewer network; environmental improvement, and \neffective protection of a closed landfill; river rehabilitation and flood control works; improved road \ninfrastructure  and  traffic  management  in  the  Xinzhan  Zone,  with  an  innovative  pilot  traffic \nmanagement  and  control  system;  and  institutional  capacity  building  for  effective  and  efficient \nproject  implementation  and  management.  Supplementary  Appendixes  B,  C,  and  D  provide \ntechnical details of the physical components. \n \n25.  Wastewater  and  waste  management  of  Hefei  city  has  four  subcomponents.  The  first \nsubcomponent  is  the  construction  of  the  Shiwuli  River  WWTP  with  a  capacity  of  50,000  cubic \n\n                                                 \n18 ADB.  2005.

The second subcomponent is the \nconstruction of Wangtang Phase II WWTP with a treatment capacity of 100,000 m3/day, a recycled \nwater  pump  station  with  a  capacity  of  35,000  m3/day,  and  about  33.4  km  of  sewer  network.  The \nthird subcomponent is the construction of sewers for four WWTPs throughout Hefei city, which will \ninclude  installation  of  206  km  of  sewer  network  of  varying  diameters  and  construction  of  one \nsewage  pumping  station.  The  fourth  subcomponent  is  improvement  to  the  closed  Qingxi  Road \nLandfill  site,  including  installation  of  (i)  a  capping  system  and  surface  water  drainage  system  to \nprevent rainwater infiltration, (ii) a leachate collection and piping system to Wangtang WWTP, (iii) a \ngas  collection  and  gas  flare  off  system,  (iv)  a  vertical  subsurface  membrane  wall  to  prevent \ngroundwater intrusion and leakage of leachate into the Nanfei River, and (v) extensive landscaping \nand planting of an urban park. \n \n26. \nRiver  rehabilitation  and  flood  control  improvement  in  Hefei  has  four  subcomponents.  The \nfirst three subcomponents comprise rehabilitation and flood control improvement for the Banqiao, \nErshibu,  and  Sili  rivers.  Work  includes  river  dredging,  widening  and  reinforcement  of  banks, \nsediment disposal from dredging, and construction of storm water discharge pipelines. Storm water \npumping  stations,  sewer  mains,  and  sewerage  pump  stations  also  will  be  constructed  to  enable \ntransfer  to  WWTPs.  Ancillary  works  include  construction  of  access  roads  and  bridges,  and \nnecessary  landscaping.  The  fourth  subcomponent  involves  improvement  to  Chao  Lake  flood \ncontrol works to enhance the ecological environment, strengthen water and soil conservation, and \nincrease flood control capacity. Work includes extension of up to 35.7 km of banks, construction of \n20.7  km  of  erosion  control  structures,  construction  of  a  56.3  km  wave  break  forest  belt, \nconstruction of wave breaks (walls), and road construction around the lake banks. \n \n27. \nImproved  road  infrastructure  and  traffic  management  in  the  Xinzhan  Zone  focuses  on \nimproving road infrastructure and traffic management in the Xinzhan Zone. Nine roads will be built, \nof  which  three  are  main  trunk  roads  and  six  are  secondary  trunk  roads.  Work  will  include \nconstruction  of  26.4  km  of  roads  and  complete  ancillary  works,  including  necessary  storm  water \nnetwork associated with the construction; and completion and testing of a pilot traffic management, \nsurveillance, and control system to ensure sustainable, integrated, and safe operation after project \ncompletion.  \n \n28. \nThe  Project  also  provides  for  institutional  capacity  building  for  project  management  to \nensure that the stakeholders are able to implement the Project effectively and manage the project \nfacilities.  The  capacity  building  will  include  project  management  consulting  services  and  training \nduring loan implementation. This will help the implementing agencies (IAs) (i) become operationally \nefficient  and  financially  sustainable  entities;  (ii)  comply  with  relevant  national  policies  for  cost \nrecovery, tariff, and enterprise reforms of the wastewater sector; (iii) develop sound O&M plans for \nfuture service provision and commercial growth; (iv) develop a public awareness training program \non environmental protection and social impact monitoring; and (v) improve the efficiency of traffic \nmanagement in the Xinzhan zone. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n29. \nThe  Project  is  ADB\u2019s  first  multisector  urban  environment  improvement  project  in  the  PRC \nthat  aims  to  integrate  urban  development  and  environmental  management  to  ensure  long-term \nsustainable  growth.  It  also  will  provide  experience  for  future  ADB-financed  urban  projects  in  the \nPRC.  The  Project  builds  on  and  advances  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  and  initiatives  with  the \nGovernment  in  several  key  areas,  including  (i)  urban  environment  and  wastewater  management, \n(ii) cost recovery and tariff reform, (iii) corporate governance and enterprise reform, (iv) integrated \nurban infrastructure development and sustainable transport system, and (v) PSP.  \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f30. \nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  support  HMG  in  creating  an  enabling  environment  for \nPSP  through  tariff  reform  and  improved  corporate  governance.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  Hefei  (para. \n19  and  footnote  14)  suggests  that  this  is  a  successful  approach  to  attracting  PSP  in  the  longer \nterm. The funding of part of the Project directly from wastewater tariffs is a major reform that is in \nline with ADB\u2019s water policy.  \n \n31. \nThe road and traffic management subcomponent will address traffic management directly, \nand  is  expected  to  help  to  minimize  air  pollution  generated  from  increased  traffic  volume \nassociated  with  urban  development.  The  Xinzhan  zone  will  be  used  as  a  pilot  area  for  this \nsubcomponent. If successful, it will be expanded across Hefei and potentially to other cities in the \nPRC. In addition to road construction, the subcomponent includes \n  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\na  traffic  management  scheme  focusing  on  signage  and  traffic  signals  that  will  be \nbuilt  using  a  central  control  system  to  synchronize  traffic  light  patterns,  facilitate \ntraffic  flow,  and  minimize  slow  and  stop  movement  of  vehicles,  thereby  improving \nefficiency of energy consumption and reducing vehicular emissions;19  \n\nenhanced  management  of  road  safety  to  (a)  reduce  the  frequency  and  severity  of \nroad accidents; (b) benefit pedestrians, public bus users, and bicycle riders, who are \npredominantly  from  low-income  groups;  and  (c)  increase  the  economic  benefits  of \nthe infrastructure investment; and  \nintegration with other transport modes and logistics centers.20   \n\n \n32. \nRehabilitation  of  the  closed  Qingxi  Road  Landfill  site  is  an  innovative  scheme  to  support \ncomprehensive waste and wastewater management to improve the environment. Improvements to \nthe landfill will eliminate contamination to surface and groundwater, and reduce obnoxious odor to \nsurrounding  residents.  As  such,  this  initiative  would  have  demonstration  effect  for  other  urban \nareas  with  improperly  managed  landfill  sites.  Consequently,  these  special  features  and  initiatives \nwill bring added value to the Project. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $372.36  million,  including  taxes  and \n33. \nduties.

The  Borrower  is  the  PRC.  The  Government  of  the  PRC  will \nrelend  the  loan  proceeds  to  the  Anhui  provincial  government  (APG),  which  will  onlend  the  loan \nproceeds to HMG on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. The loan proceeds \nthen will be onlent to the IAs on the same terms and conditions, with each IA bearing the risks of \nforeign exchange and interest rate variation for their portion of the loan proceeds onlent thereto. It \nis also a requirement that the IAs perform all obligations under the Project Agreement to the extent \napplicable  to  them  respectively  which  will  be  made  an  integral  part  of  the  onlending  agreement. \nAppendix 5 shows the flow of funds and onlending arrangements. \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n36. \nHMG will be the Executing Agency for the Project. The project leading group (PLG) will be \nresponsible  for  project  coordination,  and  will  provide  policy  guidance  during  implementation. \nHeaded  by  the  vice  mayor,  the  PLG  will  comprise  representatives  of  the  Hefei  Financial  Bureau \n(HFB), Hefei Municipal Development and Planning Commission, Hefei Construction Commission, \nHefei Water Affairs Bureau, Xinzhan Management Commission, and HUCIC. \n \n37. \nThe  three  IAs  are  (i)  HUCIC,  (ii)  Hefei  Chao  Lake  Ecological  and  Environmental \nImprovement  Construction  and  Administrative  Bureau,  and  (iii)  Hefei  Xincheng  State  Assets \nOperating  Co.  Ltd.  These  organizations  are  fully  state-owned.  The  seven  subcomponents  under \nHUCIC  will  be  carried  out  through  the  following  arrangements:  (i)  HUCIC  will  undertake  one \nsubcomponent:  Qingxi  Road  Landfill  rehabilitation;  (ii)  the  Hefei  Municipal  Drainage  Office  will \nundertake three subcomponents: Ershibu River, Banqiao River, and Sili River flood control; and (iii) \nthe  Hefei  Wastewater  Treatment  Administrative  Department  (HWTAD)  will  undertake  three \nsubcomponents: Shiwuli WWTP, Wangtang WWTP Phase II, and Hefei Sewerage Improvement.22 \nThe Hefei Chao Lake Ecological and Environmental Improvement Construction and Administrative \nBureau, a specifically established nonrevenue-earning government organization under Hefei Water \nAffairs Bureau, will undertake directly the Chao Lake subcomponent. Hefei Xincheng State Assets \nOperating Co. Ltd will implement the Xinzhan Zone component. Institutional capacity building will \nbe implemented through the project management office (PMO).  \n\n                                                 \n22 HWTAD  and  Hefei  Municipal  Drainage  Office  were  designated  by  HMG  to  implement  the  wastewater  and  river \nrehabilitation  and  flood  control  subcomponents  under  HUCIC  in  accordance  to  HMG  Notice  123  [2006],  dated  23 \nNovember 2006. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n38. \nEstablished  within  HFB,  the  PMO  will  serve  as  the  secretariat  of  the  PLG  and  will  be \nresponsible  for  coordinating  the  implementation  of  project  activities.  The  PMO  will  (i)  ensure \nadequate interdepartmental cooperation and interagency coordination, (ii) monitor the progress of \nproject  implementation,  and  (iii)  coordinate  communication  with  ADB  and  agencies  concerned.  A \nproject  implementation  unit  will  be  established  within  each  subcomponent  IA,  and  will  be \nresponsible  to  the  respective  IA  for  coordinating  detailed  implementation  activities.  Appendix  6 \nprovides details of the overall project organization. Further details of the institutional arrangements \nand assessment are in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n39. \nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years from mid-2007 until mid-2012 (Appendix 7). \nThe  implementation  period  is  estimated  based  on  the  project  scope  and  construction  technology \nrequirements.  The  schedule  is  considered  realistic  and  achievable,  because  the  project \nimplementation  structure  is  in  place  and  preparatory  works  are  underway.  ADB\u2019s  successful \nexperience with similar projects in the PRC, combined with the knowledge and experience of HMG \nand  the  IAs  in  wastewater  management  and  other  urban  environmental  improvement  projects, \nindicates that the schedule is realistic and achievable. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n40.  Goods and works will be procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2006, \nas amended from time to time). Contracts for goods estimated to exceed $1.0 million and contracts \nfor works estimated to exceed $10.0 million will be procured using international competitive bidding \nprocedures. Contracts for goods and contracts for works estimated to cost equal or less than the \ninternational  competitive  bidding  values,  but  more  than  $100,000,  will  be  procured using  national \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  PRC  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  (1999), \nsubject  to  modifications  agreed  with  ADB.  Contracts  for  goods  and  works  estimated  to  cost \n$100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  using  shopping  procedures.  Appendix  8  provides  an  indicative \n18-month procurement plan for the Project.  \n \n41. \nADB  has  approved  HMG\u2019s  request  for  advance  contracting,  which includes  recruitment  of \nconsultants, and procurement of goods and civil works. It also approved a request for retroactive \nfinancing of eligible expenditures up to $30 million (equivalent to 20% of the ADB loan), incurred \nbefore  loan  effectiveness,  but  not  earlier  than  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  Loan \nAgreement.23 Advance contracting will include (i) prequalification of contractors, (ii) preparation of \ntender  documents,  (iii)  evaluation  of  bids,  and  (iv)  recruitment  of  consultants.  All  advance \ncontracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines. The issuance of invitations to bid under advance contracting and retroactive financing \nwill be subject to ADB approval. The Government, HMG, and the IAs have also been advised that \napproval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the \nProject. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe Project provides funding for 31 person-months of international consulting services and \n42. \n108  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  to  support  the  PMO  and  IAs  in  project \nimplementation,  and  management  and  institutional  capacity  building.  A  consulting  firm  will  be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The consulting firm will \n\n                                                 \n23 The advance action on the procurement and recruitment of consultants, and the uploading of the general procurement \nnotice on the ADB website, will facilitate the start of the advance action process. ADB Management approved advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing on 23 November 2006. \n\n\fthe  management \n\nbe  selected  in  accordance  with  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  using  full  technical \nproposal  procedures.  The  consulting  services  will  cover  (i)  project  management  and  construction \nsupervision,  (ii)  setup  of \ninformation  system  and  project  performance \nmanagement  system  (PPMS),  (iii)  environmental  management,  (iv)  social  development,  (v) \nfinancial management, (vi) O&M of the project assets, and (vii) institutional strengthening through \nhuman  resources  development  and  training.  The  consultants  also  will  assist  the  PMO  with \nquestions  regarding  ADB  procedures  and  reporting,  procurement,  quality  control,  startup  testing, \ncommissioning, O&M, and implementation of the PPMS. The PMO will initiate advance action for \nthe  recruitment  of  consultants,  including  shortlisting  qualified  consultants.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference for consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n\n5. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s policy on Anticorruption (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n43. \nwith  HMG  and  the  IAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s policy on Anticorruption are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records \nand accounts of HMG, IAs, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers \nas  they  relate  to  the  Project.  For  the  Project,  a  number  of  anticorruption  actions  have  been \nincluded as covenants in the loan and project agreements. Under these covenants, HMG will:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\ninvolve the agencies responsible for oversight of each IA in bidding and construction \nto enhance construction quality control and supervise effective work;  \nintroduce a dual-signing system in which the civil works contract winner also signs \nan anticorruption contract with the employer;  \nperiodically  inspect  the  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and \nsettlements;  \nengage a project management consultant to support the PMO and the IAs to ensure \ngood governance, accountability, and transparency in project operations;  \nin  consultation  with  relevant  central  Government  ministries,  update  rules  and \nregulations  on  local  and  corporate  governance  and  anticorruption,  and  enhance \ntransparency of the IAs\u2019 operations; and \ndisclose  a  summary  of  the  audited  financial  statements  and  project  accounts, \nschedules  of  tariff  increases  and  public  hearings,  and  tracking  of  procurement \ncontract awards on the project website of HMG. \n\n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\ntime \n\nfrom \n\nThe  ADB  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan \n44. \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended \ntime).  To  expedite  project \nimplementation  through  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds,  APG  will  establish  an  imprest  account \npromptly  after  loan  effectiveness  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  Disbursements  from \nthe  imprest  account  will  be  supported  by  an  appropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related \ndocumentation. Such documentation will demonstrate, among other things, that the goods and/or \nservices were produced in or from ADB\u2019s members, and are eligible for ADB financing. The initial \namount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  the  Project\u2019s  estimated \nimplementation expenditures for the next 6 months, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. \nThe  ADB  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible \nexpenditures.  Individual  payments  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  procedure  will  not \n\nto \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fexceed  $200,000. 24  Direct  payment  procedures  will  be  used  for  large  civil  works  contracts. \nFollowing  the  recommendation  of  the  financial  management  assessment  to  improve  the  internal \ncontrol  system  of  the  IAs,  APG  will  review  and  approve  all  withdrawal  applications  prior  to \nsubmission to ADB. As a condition for disbursement of the loan proceeds for any subcomponent, \nthe  Government  must  submit  to  ADB  the  certification  that  (i)  the  onlending  agreement  has  been \nentered  into  between  HMG  and  each  concerned  IA,  and  (ii)  such  onlending  agreement  contains \nthe same financial terms and conditions as required in the loan agreement. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n45. \nThe  PMO  will  prepare  semiannual  progress  reports  indicating  progress  made,  problems \nencountered during the period under review, steps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, the \nproposed  program  of  activities,  and  progress  expected  in  the  next  half  year.  The  IAs  will  keep \nrecords to allow the identification of goods and services financed from the loan proceeds, following \naccounting  principles  and  practices  prescribed  by  the  Accounting  Law  of  the  PRC.  This  law \nrequires  enterprises  to  prepare  financial  statements  and  generally  follow  recognized  accounting \nstandards. The IAs will maintain separate project accounts and records. The financial statements \nof  the  project  accounts  and  the  annual  corporate  financial  statements  for  IAs  will  be  subject  to \nexternal  audit  by  the  HMG  Audit  Bureau,  the  Anhui  Provincial  Audit  Bureau,  and  the  State  Audit \nAdministration. The audits will be carried out in accordance with regulations for auditing approved \nby the State Council, and must meet ADB requirements. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of \nthe imprest account and statement of expenditure will be part of the audit reports. The IAs\u2019 annual \naudited financial statements and audited project accounts will be submitted to ADB no later than 6 \nmonths  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  throughout  the  implementation  period.  The  Government, \nAPG,  and  HMG  have  been  informed  about  the  ADB  policy  requiring  the  submission  of  audited \nfinancial  statements  on  time.  HMG  and  the  IAs  will  submit  reports  and  information  to  ADB \nconcerning  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds,  project  implementation,  and  IA  performance.  These \nreports will include (i) semiannual progress reports on project implementation; (ii) annual reports; \nand  (iii)  a  project  completion  report,  not  later  than  3  months  after  the  completion  of  the  project \nfacilities. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe  PPMS  indicators,  their  relevance,  and  monitoring  practicalities  were  confirmed  and \n46. \nagreed  with  PMO  during  project  preparation.  These  include  (i)  service  levels;  (ii)  treated \nwastewater  quality  and  other  operational  performance  measures;  (iii)  wastewater  percentages \ncollected  and  treated;  (iv)  public  satisfaction  with  the  urban  environment;  (v)  relevant  social  and \neconomic  data;  (vi)  health  and  gender  data;  (vii)  incidence  of  waterborne  and  airborne  diseases; \n(viii) water quality and incidence of seasonal flooding on the Nanfei River, its tributaries, and Chao \nLake;  (ix)  traffic  conditions  in  the  Xinzhan  Zone  and  accident  rates;  (x)  air  pollution  reduction \nindicators; (xi) expansion of green space; and (xii) increase in public awareness of environmental \nprotection.  \n \n47. \nAt  the  beginning  of  the  Project,  the  PMO  and  IAs,  with  the  consultant\u2019s  assistance,  will \ndevelop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures  to  generate  data  systematically  on  the  inputs  and \noutputs of the subcomponents, as well as the agreed indicators (para. 46) to be used to measure \nproject  impacts.  The  PMO  will  (i)  refine  the  PPMS  framework,  (ii)  confirm  achievable  targets, (iii) \nfirm up monitoring and recording arrangements, and (iv) establish systems and procedures no later \nthan 6 months after loan effectiveness. \n                                                 \n24 Limits  for  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditures  are  in  accordance  with  a  recent  review  of  ADB\u2019s  PRC \nportfolio and the financial management assessment of the IAs during project preparation. The proposed limits aim to \nfacilitate improved efficiency in loan disbursement. \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\f48. \nUnder  the  PPMS  framework,  baseline  and  progress  data  will  be  reported  regularly  at  the \nprescribed  time  intervals  by  the  IAs,  including  semiannual  reporting  of  the  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP).  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  the  data \nthrough  its management  information  system,  established  at  the  time  of  loan  implementation.  The \nPPMS  will  be  designed  to  permit  adequate  flexibility  to  adopt  remedial  action  for  project  design, \nschedule,  activities,  and  development  impacts.  The  PMO,  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants, \nwill monitor and assess activities, and report to ADB semiannually on physical implementation and \nfinancial aspects of the Project from commencement until 2 years after project completion. This will \nensure that impacts are monitored and reported in line with ADB requirements. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n49. \nADB and the Government will review project implementation jointly at least once a year. In \naddition, ADB and the Government will undertake a comprehensive midterm review 2 years after \nthe start of project implementation. This will include a detailed review of the scope, implementation \narrangements,  resettlement,  achievement  of  scheduled  targets,  and  progress  on  the  agenda  for \npolicy reform and capacity-building measures. Feedback from the PPMS activities will be analyzed. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\n50. \nThe Project will benefit directly about 2.61 million people living in the project area, of whom \nabout 5.2% are poor. All the residents in Hefei will benefit indirectly, as their living conditions will \nimprove as a result of (i) reduced pollution of Hefei\u2019s surface water, with water quality improving to \nat least class V by 2012, with longer-term potential to be upgraded to class IV and eventually class \nIII;  (ii)  protection  from  flooding  and  elimination  of  hazards  resulting  from  poor  drainage;  (iii)  10% \nreduction  in  the  incidence  of  waterborne  and  airborne  diseases  from  2005  levels,  with  a \ncorresponding  decline  in  the  number  of  sick  days  and  expenses  for  medical  treatment;  and  (iv)  \nincreased  traffic  flow  and  shorter  waiting  times  due  to  an  innovative  traffic  management  system \nwith  improved  road  safety,  which  will  reduce  traffic  accidents,  enhance  productivity,  and  lower \nvehicle emissions. \n \nB. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nResettlement  impacts  have  been  identified  and  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  prepared  in \n51. \naccordance  with  PRC  land  law  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995).  With  the \nassistance of local design and social institutes, the IAs prepared three full RPs and five short RPs. \nAll subcomponents were planned to minimize disruption of residential areas and communities. The \nWangtang  II  WWTP  does  not  require  an  RP,  because  the  existing  site  is  sufficient  for  the \nexpansion. Impacts will include (i) people affected by the permanent acquisition of land, (ii) people \naffected by the temporary use of land, and (iii) people whose livelihood is affected. The Project will \nrequire  (i)  the  permanent  acquisition  of  approximately  344  hectares  of  land  (69%  of  which  is \ncultivated);  (ii)  the  temporary  acquisition  of  29.57  hectares  of  land;  and  (iii)  the  demolition  of \napproximately  104,200  square  meters  of  household  building  space,  which  will  require  the \nrelocation  of  884  households  with  2,793  persons.  Land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  all \nassociated costs are estimated at CNY631.75 million or $79.97 million (equivalent to 21.47% of the \noverall project costs). The summary RP is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n52. \nADB  requires  internal  and  external  resettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  affected \npersons (APs) during implementation. The IAs will report progress regularly to the PMO, which will \nsummarize  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  progress  in  the  semiannual  progress  reports  to \nADB. The PMO will retain the services of a domestic external monitor for this purpose. The monitor \nwill  visit  the  subcomponents  every  6  months  to  (i)  review  resettlement  progress  and  the  general \nwelfare of those affected, (ii) recommend ways to resolve any issues or problems, and (iii) provide \nadvice  to  IAs  and  local  officials.  The  monitor  will  pay  special  attention  to  vulnerable  groups, \nincluding women and the poor, to assess whether they have regained fully their standard of living. \nMonitoring and evaluation reports will be prepared every 6 months during implementation, followed \nby  an  annual  report  1  year  after  the  completion  of  resettlement.  These  reports  will  be  submitted \nsimultaneously to ADB, PMO, and the IAs. They also will be uploaded onto the ADB website. \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Reduction, Health, and Social Benefits \n\n53. \nPoverty  and  Social  Development  Impact.  The  Project  supports  the  achievement  of  the \nMDG for environmental sustainability (Goal 7), which aims to halve the proportion of people without \nsustainable  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  basic  sanitation  by  2015  (Target  10),  through \nimproved urban environmental management. The Project will benefit directly an urban population \nof  2.61  million  by  improving  environmental  conditions  and  enhancing  sanitation  through \nwastewater treatment, flood prevention and control, protection and landscaping of a former landfill, \nand urban transport services. Of the beneficiary population, 5.2% are classified as poor based on \nthe weighted average local urban poverty line of CNY2,760 per year.25  \n \n54. \nPublic consultation and participation, which have been key elements of the project design, \nwill continue during project implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Ongoing consultations also \nwill  be  carried  out  by  the  IAs  to  (i)  meet  the  evolving  needs  and  expectations  of  the  users,  (ii) \nincrease  the  awareness  of  the  public  about  the  benefits  of  the  Project,  (iii)  encourage  the  active \ninvolvement  of  local  communities  to  maximize  their  support  for  the  Project,  (iv)  promote \nenvironmental  protection,  and  (v)  raise  the  social  acceptance  of  tariff  increases.  The  Project  will \ncreate 2,830 full-time jobs during construction, of which about 60% will be for the poor and women. \nThose  temporarily  employed  in  construction  will  benefit  from  the  training  and  experience  gained \nunder the Project. This experience is expected to enhance their employment opportunities in other \ninfrastructure  projects.  Project  operations  will  create  1,080  permanent  full-time  jobs  directly  and \nanother 1,730 jobs through multiplier effects, generating approximately CNY45 million in wages per \nyear. To maximize the project benefits, women will be given priority in the employment and training \nopportunities  generated  in  the  Project\u2019s  construction  and  operation  phases.  The  impacts  of  tariff \nincreases on the poor will be offset largely by tariff exemptions or subsidies for poor households. \nHMG  has  assured  ADB  that  it  will  undertake  a  regular  review  of  the  impact  of  wastewater  tariff \nadjustments  on  the  poor,  and  will  maintain  the  provision  of  subsidies  to  protect  the  basic  living \nstandards  of  the  urban  poor.  The  Project  has  no  impact  on  indigenous  peoples,  as  no  ethnic \nminority  groups  are  in  the  project  area.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  development \nstrategy is in Appendix 10. Details are in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n55. \nHealth Benefits. The improved environmental situation will reduce the population exposed \nto  waterborne  and  airborne  diseases,  with  a  corresponding  decline  in  medical  costs  and  the \nnumber of workdays and school days lost due to sickness. The medical cost savings for children, \nthe elderly, women, and the poor would be greater, as they are most vulnerable to such diseases. \nWomen,  with  more  chances  of  contact  with  water  from  household  responsibilities  (especially \ncooking  and  washing),  will  benefit  disproportionately  from  the  improvements  in  sanitation,  water \nquality,  and  urban  environment  as  a  result  of  the  Project.  The  poor,  who  are  disproportionately \n                                                 \n25 Measured  by  the  weighted  average  local  urban  poverty  line  of  CNY2,760  per  year,  or  CNY230  ($29.11)  per  month. \n\nThis is close to the $1 per day poverty line.   \n\n\fexposed  to  unsanitary  conditions,  will  gain  more  than  the  average  population  from  improved \nenvironmental  and  living  conditions.  Baseline  costs  of  environmental  diseases  in  Hefei  are \nestimated at CNY32.5 million per year. To realize the full health benefits, parallel improvements in \npublic health education, higher standards of personal hygiene, disease prevention and control, and \nimproved housing and living conditions will be required. The latter will be particularly important for \nthe  poor,  who  are  likely  to  suffer  most  from  the  incidence  of  waterborne  and  airborne  diseases. \nThe Health Benefits and Monitoring analysis is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Analysis, Sustainability, and Affordability Aspects \n\n56. \nThe Project is considered financially viable and sustainable. A financial impact analysis of \nthe  revenue-generating  subcomponents  (wastewater)  and  the  nonrevenue  subcomponents  (the \nothers)  was  undertaken.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  the  IAs  also  was  conducted. \nThese are discussed in Appendix 11. Details of the financial impact analysis are in Supplementary \nAppendix J, while details of the financial management assessment are in Supplementary Appendix \nK.  \n  \nHWTAD,  which  is  funded  through  budget  allocations  from  the  HFB,  constructed  and \n57. \noperated  the  wastewater  subcomponents.  Wastewater  costs  are  recovered  from  all  water  supply \nconsumers through a wastewater tariff of CNY0.6 per m3 for domestic consumers and a weighted \naverage  of  CNY0.69  per  m3  for  all  consumers.  The  financial  assessment  of  sustainability  was \nundertaken  for  the  entire  wastewater  operation,  including HWTAD  operations  and  capital  finance \nfrom  HFB.  Financial  activity  was  projected  over  a  30-year  operating  period  based  on  anticipated \ncosts, sales, and tariffs with and without the Project.  \n \nThe  analysis  indicates  that,  if  tariffs  increase  with  inflation,  wastewater  operations  will  be \n58. \nprofitable at the municipality level. Further, tariff revenues would be sufficient to cover counterpart \nfunds  during  loan  implementation  and  service  the  ADB  loan.  HMG  is  aware  that  the  costs  of \nWWTP  operators  might  increase.  In  line  with  its  commitment  to  tariff  reform,  HMG  is  planning  a \nminimum increase of 50% in wastewater tariffs in 2007. HMG realizes that additional increases will \nbe required by the time the new WWTPs are operational, and has indicated that a domestic tariff of \nCNY1.1 per m3 can be assumed for 2010 (nearly double the current CNY0.6 per m3). This would \nput the tariff just above the financial average incremental cost of CNY1.0 per m3. If the wastewater \ntariff  is  increased  to  CNY1.1  per  m3  by  2010,  each  of  the  new  WWTPs  would  achieve  full  cost \nrecovery, which potentially could attract PSP.   \n \n59. \nA project-based financial analysis also was undertaken for the Shuwuli River and Wangtang \nII  WWTPs.  The  analysis  assumed  that  the  WWTPs  operate  as  self-financing  entities,  receiving \ntariff revenues from customers serviced by sewers, while paying costs associated with wastewater \ndelivery.  Assuming  the  planned  83%  tariff  increase,  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  both \nplants  would  be  4.3%,  compared  with  a  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  2.6%.26 HWTAD  has \nagreed  to  minimum  levels  of  financial  performance  during  operations,  and  these  are  included  as \nloan  covenants  covering  capital  structure  (debt  to  equity),  debt  service  coverage,  and  liquidity. \nFinancial  projections  have  estimated  the  tariffs  required  for  an  appropriate  level  of  financial \nperformance.  Periodic  tariff  reviews  will  be  required  to  overcome  the  risk  of  poor  financial \nperformance or unexpected changes in the tariff income. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n26 The financial internal rate of return for the Shiwuli River WWTP depends on an expansion of the planned capacity by \n\n50,000 m3/day, which is in HMG\u2019s plan. \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n60. \nThe  nonrevenue  subcomponents  involve  public  infrastructure  managed  by  government \ndepartments with limited or no revenue-generating capacity. Forecast debt service and O&M costs \nfor  HMG  and  Xinzhan  Development  Zone  were  compared  with  relevant  annual  revenues.  These \nwere  found  to  be  about  1.0%  and  3.7%,  respectively.  This  indicates  acceptable  fiscal  risk, \nparticularly  in  light  of  the  rapid  growth  in  government  revenues.  Appendix  11  shows  the  financial \nanalysis. \n \n61. \nAn affordability analysis was undertaken, based on proposed tariffs and household income \ndata  from  the  social  survey.  Tariffs  under  the  Project  are  considered  affordable  if  the  combined \naverage  water  and  wastewater  charges  are  less  than  5%  of  household  income.  Tariffs  after  the \nproposed 83% increase are affordable to the poorest households, whether or not they receive the \nminimum  living  guarantee  (below  CNY230  per  capita  per  month),  which  exempts  them  from \ncharges for the first 4 m3 of water. The affordability analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \n62. \nThe  results  of  the  financial  management  assessment  indicate  that  the  IAs  operate  as \ndepartments  of  HMG  with  legal  status  denoted  as  either  revenue-generating  or  nonrevenue-\ngenerating  entities.  Accounting  and  financial  management  systems  of  the  IAs  might  require \nimprovement  with  respect  to  internal  control.  In  other  respects,  systems  are  in  place  for  financial \nreporting, and accounting is fully developed and adequate for the purpose of loan implementation. \nAudit arrangements are generally adequate, though audits appear to be carried out only when the \ndepartments  implement  major  engineering  works.  Only  HWTAD  and  Hefei  Municipal  Drainage \nOffice  have  experience  with  externally  funded  projects.  Thus,  training  on  ADB  procedures  and \nrequirements related to procurement, disbursement, financial reporting, and monitoring for the IAs \nand  the  project  implementing  units  will  be  required.  The  capacity  building  component  includes \nfinancial management training. \n \nD. \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\n63. \nThe economic analysis provides a rationale and justification for the Project based on policy, \nsector, and local area analysis. It considers the Project, not as a stand-alone investment, but as an \nintegral  part  of  the  ongoing  city,  municipal,  and  basin-wide  environmental  programs  directly \ncontributing  to  flood  control  and  pollution  reduction.  This  will  decrease  health  costs  and  increase \nthe  overall  quality  of  urban  life.  For  the  Project  as  a  whole,  the  analysis  covers  the  economic \nrationale,  the  rationale  for  public intervention,  the  goals  of the  investment  plan,  the  design  of the \nplan, and the expected economic benefits. The economic rationale is sound, based on control of \nexternalities (water and air pollution) and managing natural monopolies (wastewater treatment and \nurban  road  provision).  The  main  goal  of  the  investment  plan  is  to  meet  targets  for  surface  water \nquality.  The  water  quality  targets  are  clearly  defined,  legally  established,  and  consistent  with \ninternational practice. The plan to meet the water quality targets uses centralized WWTPs and river \nand lake cleanup. In addition to helping surface water quality, the river and lake components will \ndecrease flooding and provide significant amenities, many of which will be used by the poor. The \nroad  component  includes  traffic  management  to  control  congestion,  accidents,  and  air  pollution. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  all  components  is  above  12%  (the  economic  opportunity \ncost  of  capital),  and  the  Project\u2019s  overall  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  27%.  A  summary \neconomic  analysis  is  in  Appendix  13,  while  the  detailed  economic  and  tariff  analysis  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix L. \n \nE. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\nThe  components  and  subcomponents  have  been  examined  against  criteria  specified  in \n64. \nADB\u2019s  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure  Projects. 27    Extensive  public \n                                                 \n27 ADB.1988. Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. Manila. \n\n\fconsultations  involving  surveys,  meetings  with  stakeholders,  and  focus  group  discussions  were \nundertaken twice during the preparation of the domestic environmental impact assessments (EIA). \nApplication  methods  and  standards  for  preparation  of  EIAs  are  in  line  with  the  guidelines  of  the \nState  Environmental  Protection  Administration,  and  meet  existing  national  laws  and  regulations. \nThe  Hefei  Environment  Protection  Bureau  and  Anhui  Environment  Protection  Bureau  have \napproved all the EIAs.  \n \n65. \nThe  summary  EIA  was  circulated  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  and  posted  on  the  ADB \nwebsite on 16 November 2006. The Project will improve the urban environment and surface water \nquality  in  the  Nanfei  River,  its  tributaries,  and  Chao  Lake;  and  will  help  improve  the  natural \nenvironment.  It  will  target  substantial  improvements  in  wastewater  management,  and  will  have \nsignificant  positive  effects  on  water  pollution  control.  As  a  result  of  improved  raw  water  quality, \nHefei\u2019s  residents  will  be  provided  with  more  reliable  potable  water.  The  Project  will  also  prevent \nleachate  pollution  from  the  closed  municipal  landfill  upstream  at  Qingxi  Road  adjacent  to  the \nNanfei River. It also will improve road management and reduce vehicle emissions in the Xinzhan \nZone through a traffic management system. The Government has confirmed the summary EIA and \nEMP. The summary EIA concludes that the Project will have substantial positive environmental and \nsocioeconomic benefits. Affected people will be resettled and their living conditions improved. The \nProject  also  will  have  a  sustainable  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  The  adverse  impacts  on  the \nphysical and natural environment during the construction and operations stages of the Project will \nbe  largely  insignificant  with  the  implementation  of  the  recommended  mitigation  measures.  The \nincremental costs required to achieve these are negligible compared with the costs of the Project. \n \nF. \n\nProjects Risks and Mitigation Measures \n\nThe Project does not have any unusual technical risks. Conventional engineering designs \n66. \nwith  proven  records  of  reliable  performance  will  be  adopted  for  wastewater  management,  landfill \nclosure,  flood  control,  road  construction  and  traffic  management,  and  associated  landscaping. \nDuring  project  implementation,  the consultants will  support the  PMO  and  IAs  to  ensure  delivered \nequipment and works comply with the design requirements and quality standards.  \n \n67. \nThe  following  risks  could  affect  timely  implementation  and  economic  viability,  and  reduce \nthe  available  benefits  of  the  Project:  (i)  amendments  and  changes  to  the  Hefei  master  plans, \nparticularly for the Xinzhan Zone, which could delay the Project; (ii) lack of proper O&M of project \nfacilities; (iii) ineffective organizational structures and inadequate capacity of the IAs, which could \nresult in inefficient project development and implementation delays; (iv) delays in the provision of \ncounterpart funding; (v) failure of HMG to increase wastewater tariffs to meet cost recovery targets; \nand  (vi)  unforeseen  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  issues,  which  could  constrain  the  efficient \nimplementation of the project works and restoration of livelihoods of the APs. \n \n68. \nRisk (i) will be mitigated by synchronizing the project design and implementation schedules \nwith  other  projects  planned  in  Hefei.  HMG  also  has  provided  specific  assurances  that  are \ncovenanted  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  Risks  (ii)  and  (iii)  will  be  mitigated  through  provision  of \ninstitutional capacity building for the IAs with the support of the consultants. Risks (iv) and (v) will \nbe  mitigated  through  covenanted  assurances  from  HMG  on  the  provision  of  counterpart  funding, \nand  regular  tariff  reviews  and  increases.  Risk  (vi)  will  be  mitigated  by  strengthening  the  internal \nmonitoring and supervision by PMO and the IAs, and by engaging a qualified external agency to \nmonitor and evaluate resettlement. Several other measures also will help mitigate the project risks: \n(i)  appointment  of  project  implementation  and  monitoring  consultants,  including  environmental \nmonitoring consultants; (ii) EMP monitoring and mitigation arrangements; (iii) EMP environmental \nmanagement training; and (iv) specific assurances from HMG that the PLG and PMO are retained \nfor the loan implementation period and beyond. \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\fV. \n\nASSURANCES28 \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, APG, and HMG have provided the \n\n69. \nfollowing assurances, which are

O&M, interest charges, depreciation, \ndebt repayment, together with a reasonable profit margin; (e) active support is provided \nfor  any  potential  PSP;  (f)  the  operating  companies  maintain  proper  financial  ratios \nduring  project  operation;  and  (g)  the  wastewater  company  establishes  and  maintain  a \nfinancial  management  system  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  for  Governance  and \nFinancial Management of an ADB Investment Project.  \nHMG  will  ensure  that  (a)  the  RPs  will  be  implemented  promptly  and  efficiently  in \naccordance  with  their  terms;  (b)  the  RP  provisions  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance \nwith  all  applicable  PRC  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement; (c) all APs are given adequate opportunity to participate in resettlement \nplanning  and  implementation;  and  ensure  that  they  will  be  at  least  as  well  off  as  they \nwould have been in the absence of the

\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nURBAN SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nA. \n \nBefore  the  economic  reforms  of  the  1980s,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \n1. \nChina  (PRC)  was  the  sole  provider  of  urban  services.  Wastewater  management  practice  was \nbased on septic tanks, designated open drainage ditches, and no treatment. Urban services were \nfunded through tax revenue, and consumers paid minimal or no charges. Road infrastructure also \nwas poorly developed and vehicle ownership was very low \n \n2. \nWhen economic reforms started in 1978, the urban population grew significantly from about \n160  million (17%  of  the  population)  in  1975  to 560  million (43%  of  the  population)  in  2005.    This \ntrend is expected to increase to levels of 50% or more over the next 10 years. With this population \ngrowth  came  an  increase  in  the  number  of  cities\u2014from  122  in  1949  to  661  in  2004.  This  rapid \nurbanization  has  increased  the  pressure  on  the  environment,  as  well  as  the  management  and \nfinancing  of  public  services.  The  urbanization  of  rural  areas  and  the  high  rates  of  rural-to-urban \nmigration have resulted in a large proportion of migrants living in inadequately serviced peri-urban \nareas.  This  increases  pressure  on  infrastructure  services,  including  urban  transport,  power, \ntelecommunication, water supply, wastewater treatment, and solid waste management. \n \nHefei  municipality,  which  comprises  four  urban  districts  and  three  counties,  has  a \n3. \npopulation  of  4.5  million.  Like  most  cities  in  the  PRC,  Hefei  has  grown  rapidly  over  the  past  20 \nyears.  The population is expected to increase to 6.3 million by 2010 and 8.0 million by 2020.  The \nmunicipal gross domestic product is forecast to increase 13.5% per year on average during 2006\u2013\n2010. By 2010, the urbanization rate in Hefei will reach 60%. With the development of high-speed \neconomy,  the  spread  of  urbanization,  and  increase  of  population,  the  city\u2019s  environmental \nconditions  (including  wastewater  and  waste  management),  traffic  situation,  and  quality  of \ngroundwater continue to deteriorate and need urgent attention. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe Hefei 11th Five-Year Program (FYP) for 2006\u20132010 and the Hefei Urban Development \nMaster Plan (in draft form) are the blueprints for the physical, economic, and social development of \nHefei  in  the  medium  to  long  term.  These  plans  are  based  on  the  population  projections  of  6.3 \nmillion in 2010 and 8 million in 2020.  \n \nThe urban master plan proposes a redevelopment of the old urban center into a new trade \n5. \nand finance center. New residential and industrial developments are under construction, and more \nare  planned  in  all  directions  from  the  middle  of  the  city  to  cater  for  Hefei\u2019s  prominent  role  as  a \nmodern science and technology center. Hefei also is becoming an increasingly important road and \nrail  transport  hub,  which  will  take  on  more  significance  when  the  planned  Jianghuai  canal linking \nthe Yangtze and the Huai river systems is constructed.   \n \n6. \nEconomic  growth  in  Hefei  is  planned  simultaneously  with  expanded  urbanization  of  land \nand population growth. In the 11th FYP, the urban area will increase by 33% from 2005 to 2010.  \nAnnual growth rates of 15.5% are forecast for 2006\u20132010, and a per capita gross domestic product \nof  $5,000  is  forecast  in  2010.  Such  growth  will  exert  substantial  pressure  on  the  urban \ninfrastructure,  and  will  create  much  demand  for  improvement  and  expansion.  Wastewater \ntreatment, sewer network replacement, flood control, and improved traffic management are urgent \nareas for upgrading and expansion. The Asian Development Bank-financed Project is essential to \nhelp the Hefei municipal government (HMG) realize its development goals. \n\nHefei Urban Plans \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nWater Sector \n\nC. \n \n7. \nThe  Hefei  piped  water  system  takes  water  from  the  Dongpu  and  Dafangyin  reservoirs, \nwhich receive good quality water from the upper reaches of the Nanfei River. Widespread pollution \nsources  downstream  of  these  reservoirs  lowers  river  water  quality  to  Class  V\u2014well  below  the \nClass III required for urban piped water supply. As a result, water can no longer be abstracted from \nthe rivers or from Chao Lake, one of the five major freshwater lakes in the PRC. Chao Lake, which \nis  part  of  the  \u201cleft  bank  river  system\u201d  of  the  lower  reaches  of  the  Yangtze  River,  has  at  least  six \nrivers running into it. The lake has an artificially controlled level with a storage capacity of 4.8 billion \ncubic meters (m3). The development of cities and industrial plants around the lake, and increasing \namounts  of  agricultural  fertilizers  and  pesticides  seeping  into  the  lake,  has  severely  polluted  the \nwater.  \n \n8. \nAs urbanization increases, the Dongpu and the Dafangyin reservoirs to the north of the city \nalso  face  serious  pollution  problems,  with  domestic  and  other  sewage  discharged  freely.  The \nDongpu  provides  water  to  all  four  Hefei  water  treatment  plants  (WTP)  (also  referred  to  as  water \npurification plants), and the Dafangyin will serve the planned WTP No. 6. A separate drainage and \nwastewater  system  is  planned  for  this  area,  which  will  help  to  protect  the  reservoirs  as  water \nsources. \n \nThe  Hefei  Water  Supply  Group  Co.  Ltd  (HWSC),  wholly  owned  by  HMG,  supplies  piped \n9. \nwater  in  Hefei.  The  Hefei  Water  Supply  Office  administers  the  sector.  The  separate  Hefei  Water \nAffairs  Bureau  deals  with  all  waters  and  water  resources,  including  rivers,  flood  control,  etc., \nalthough  it  is  in  charge  of  only  the  Chao  Lake  subcomponent  of  the  Project.  Piped  water  supply \ncapacity of the four WTPs in Hefei is 875,000 m3/day. Raw water pumping stations abstract from \nthe Dongpu Reservoir. A similar station on Chao Lake no longer is used due to water pollution. In \naddition, five local pressurization stations distribute the treated water. The majority of the pipes are \nnearly 40 years old, with some as old as 50 years. Water losses have increased from 7% in 2000 \nto 12% in 2005 (on top of 2\u20133% production losses). Although this is low by international standards, \nthe trend is causing concern since the old pipes are obviously deteriorating. Besides the Hefei City \ndistricts, HWSC also provides water to Shangpai town (50,000 m3/day in 2010) in Feixi county, and \nModian township (20,000 m3/day in 2010) in the Yaohai Industrial Area. Plans also are being made \nto supply Shangdun town and Luyang and Shauangfeng industrial areas (50,000 m3/day in 2010). \n \n10. \nIn addition to HWSC, 25 self-providing water works in Hefei have been built by large-scale \nenterprises  and  scientific  research  institutes.  Taken  together,  these  add  20\u201325%  to  the  water \nsupply.  The  city  districts  also  might  have  small  private  wells,  as  in  the  counties.  The  Hefei \nMunicipal  Waster  Supply  Plan  and  its  update  state  that  Hefei  groundwater  is  a  scarce  resource \nand  extraction  should  be  controlled.  Although  future  use  of  groundwater  might  be  necessary, \nconsumers should be encouraged to use piped water. \n \n11. \nDomestic  water  consumption  recorded  by  HWSC,  and  using  their  own  population  served \nestimates, was  some  165\u2013170  liter  per  capita per  day  (lpcd)  in  2005. This  consumption  drops  to \n156  lpcd  if  the  entire  registered  population  is  assumed  to  be  served  and  to  121  lpcd  if  the  total \npopulation is included. Even the latter is higher than the 112 lpcd recorded as a PRC urban median \nby  the  China  Water  Supply  Association  in  2004.  Industrial  demand  in  Hefei  has  declined  in \nabsolute and percentage terms. In 1995, it was 68,000 m3, or 42% of total sales. In 2004, it was \nonly 40,000 m3, or 20% of the total. The reason for the decline is the change in type of industry and \nthe city\u2019s efforts to promote efficient use of water. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nD. \n\nWastewater Sector \n \n1. \n\nWastewater Treatment \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\n \nThe Hefei Wastewater Treatment Administrative Department plans and controls wastewater \n12. \nin Hefei. Ownership is more complex, however. A Sino-German joint venture operates the largest \nwastewater  treatment  plant  (WWTP),  the  Wangxiaoying  WWTP.1 The  city  owns  Wantang  I,  the \nnext largest WWTP, but the Hefei Water Star Company operates it.  Hefei Wastewater Treatment \nAdministrative  Department  and  Hefei  Urban  Construction  Investment  and  Holding  Co.  Ltd,  under \nguidance from the Hefei Municipal Construction Commission, will build the planned Wantang II and \nShiwuli WWTPs under the Project. \n \nThe extension of the city into new areas will increase the need for a sewerage network, as \n13. \nwell  as  treatment.  The  city  has  four  full-scale  WWTPs,  with  a  combined  capacity  of  437,000  m3/ \nday. This is 50% of the city\u2019s maximum water supply capacity of 875,000 m3/day, but about 70% of \nthe  wastewater  flows.  The  updated  Wastewater  Plan  includes  three  new  projects  to  address  the \nexpected  increase  in  wastewater  flows.  The  Project  will  finance  Wangtang  WWTP  II,  with  a \ncapacity of 100,000 m3/day, and Shiwuli River WWTP, with capacity of 50,000 m3/day. The third, \nCaitanpu  WWTP  with  capacity  of  25,000  m3/day,  will  to  be  financed  using  domestic  resources. \nWith  the  construction  of  these  three  additional  WWTPs,  the  treatment  capacity  of  Hefei  City  is \nexpected to increase to 80% of wastewater generated by 2010. About 9% of wastewater treated, \nor 30,000\u201350,000 m3/day, is recycled. The 11th FYP proposes that this should increase to 260,000 \nm3/day, a 20-fold increase, by 2010. To meet this expectation, tertiary treatment (water purification) \nis proposed for the Wantang WWTP II. \n \n14. \nThe sewer and wastewater network is 250 kilometers (km) long, with a capacity to handle \n437,000 m3/day. This is only a proportion of total requirements. By 2010, the Project will provide an \nadditional 313 km, which will improve the situation significantly. \n\n \n2. \n\nSludge Generation, Handling, and Disposal \n\n \n15.  Wastewater  treatment  produces  significant  amounts  of  sludge,  which  makes  disposal  an \nimportant  part  of  operations.  The  rate  of  sludge  production  is  approximately  0.5%\u20131.3%  of  the \nwastewater treated (at a water content of 97%). Sludge produced in Hefei is dried into fertilizer.   \n \n16. \nSludge  contains  large  amounts  of  organic  matter,  comprising  nutrients  and  disease-\ninducing  organisms  and/or  toxic  substances.  Consequently,  the  sludge  must  be  treated  and \nutilized,  or  disposed  of  carefully.  If  simply  piled  freely,  secondary  contamination  would  result, \ncausing  widespread  surface  and  groundwater  pollution  with  serious  consequences  for  recipient \nwater bodies such as Chao Lake.  \n \n17. \nIf  fully  treated,  Hefei\u2019s  wastewater  volume  would  produce  820  tons  sludge  per  day. \nHowever,  with  the  short-term  wastewater  treatment  capacity,  the  amount  of  sludge  generation \nwould be 575 tons per day. HMG is considering a number of options for sludge treatment, including \nagricultural utilization, incineration, and landfill disposal. HMG is analyzing the costs and benefits of \nthese  options  to  select  the  most  cost-effective  solution.  In  the  interim,  surplus  sludge  that  is  not \n\n                                                 \n1  Wangxiaoying  WWTP  Phase  II  was  financed  by  ADB.  1996.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the \nBoard of Directors on Proposed Loans and Technical Assistance Grant to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Anhui \nEnvironmental Improvement Project for Municipal Wastewater Treatment. Manila (Loans 1490 and 1491-PRC and TA \n2693-PRC, approved on 26 November), which was completed in 2002. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ndried into fertilizer will be taken to the sanitary landfill site at Longquan in the eastern part of the \ncity. \n\n \n3. \n\nFlood Control \n\n \n18. \nAlthough Hefei has been prone to flooding, much work has been done in the past 50 years \nto protect river banks. As a result, the last three major floods affected a steadily decreasing area of \nthe city. The last major flood was in 1991, when 5.5 square kilometers of the city and 86 square \nkilometers of rural areas along the Nanfei River were flooded. Some of these areas now have been \nprotected,  but  HMG  has  decided  to  increase  protection  to  cover  a  1-in-100  year  flood  within  the \nwhole Hefei urban area.2 This is included as a policy issue in the Hefei 11th FYP.  Five river areas \nhave  been  identified  as  needing  protection:  the  Sili,  Banqiao,  and  Ershibu  rivers,  which  are \nincluded under the Project; and the Shiwuli and Nanfei rivers to the south of the city, which are not \nincluded.  \n \n19. \nThe Chao Lake Basin Flood Control Plan has been implemented, and the majority of areas \nabutting Hefei are protected to 1-in-10 to 1-in-20 year levels. The Chao Lake subcomponent within \nthe  Project  will  provide  improved  flood  protection  and  erosion  control  measures  in  the  northern \nsection of Chao Lake under HMG administration.  \n \nThe  Hefei  Municipal  Drainage  Office,  under  Hefei  Urban  Construction  Investment  and \n20. \nHolding  Co.  Ltd.,  will  implement  the  three  river  flood  control  project  subcomponents.  When  the \nprojects  are  completed,  the  municipal  engineering  maintenance  department  will  provide  most  of \nthe  maintenance.  The  Hefei  Chao  Lake  Administrative  Bureau  will  organize  the  Chao  Lake \nsubcomponent.  \n \nE. \n \nThe Project includes the restoration of a closed landfill site at Qingxi Road. A medical and \n21. \nhazardous waste site originally was included in the Project, but was taken out. As the Qingxi Road \nsite  does  not  include  any  solid  waste  disposal,  an  analysis  of  the  solid  waste  sector  was \nunnecessary. \n \nF. \n \n22. \nDue  to  the  rapid  growth  of  Hefei  and  resulting  increase  in  traffic  volume,  the \nComprehensive  Transport  Plan  of  Hefei  City  (1995\u20132010)  is  no  longer  considered  valid.  HMG  is \nplanning to prepare a new plan to meet the medium- to long-term needs of the city. Nevertheless, \nthe Comprehensive Transport Plan of Hefei City and the Hefei City and County network map have \nbeen  used as  the  basis  for  the  road  sector  analysis.  The city  is being  developed on  the  basis  of \nring roads and a grid road network. Since 1983, more than 20 trunk roads have been renovated. \nAs of 2004, the Hefei municipal area had 385 km of roads: 26 main roads with a length of 151 km \nand 66 secondary roads with a length of 234 km. Roads leading to the three counties totaled 769 \nkm. The total road length including rural areas was 1,010 km.  \n \n23. \nThe Xinzhan Zone, the focal point of the road subcomponent, is a rapidly expanding urban \narea in northeast Hefei. It was established in 1992 to become the city\u2019s road and rail transport hub \nin line with HMG development policy. \n \n\nSolid Waste Sector \n\nRoad Sector \n\n                                                 \n2  Hefei Urban Flood Control Plan issued in 1996, updated in 2003 but awaiting approval. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nIn 2004, the number of motorized vehicles in Hefei municipality totaled 215,296, including \n24. \n6,500  taxis  and  2,529  buses.  In  the  past  5  years,  the  number  of  vehicles  has  grown  on  average \n16%  a  year,  with  registered  private  cars  growing  more  rapidly  at  25%  per  year  over  the  same \nperiod.  In  2005,  the  Xinzhan  Zone  had  28,234  registered  vehicles  within  the  zone  and  41,023 \nauthorized  drivers.  The  urban  transport  infrastructure  cannot  meet  the  increasing  demand.  With \nsuch increases in vehicular traffic, traffic management needs to be upgraded to improve traffic flow \nand  reduce  emissions.  The  limited  road  space  and  inefficient  use  of  the  existing  traffic \nmanagement system are creating road safety concerns for drivers, pedestrians, and non-motorized \ntransport  users.  A  well-planned  urban  road  network,  therefore,  is  necessary  to  ensure  the \nsustainable development of Hefei. \n \n25. \nThe Hefei Urban Master Plan proposes improving the road and rail transport links to make \nthe  city  an  important  transportation  hub  for  the  future.  Furthermore,  the  11th  FYP  prioritizes  the \ndevelopment of the Xinzhan (new station) pilot area into an economically important business and \nresidential area that will need an effective and efficient transportation network. The Project includes \nthe following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nA  traffic  management  scheme  focusing  on  signage  and  traffic  lights,  which  will  be \nbuilt  using  a  central  control  system  to  improve  synchronization  of  traffic  light \npatterns, facilitate uninhibited traffic flow, and minimize slow and stop movement of \nvehicles.  \nEnhanced management of road safety, which has been included for the first time as \npart  of  the  United  Nations  policy  for  sustainable  development,  to  reduce  the \nfrequency,  severity,  and  cost  to  the  community  of  road  accidents.  This  will  benefit \nthe  low-income  people  who  are  pedestrians,  public  bus  users,  and  bicycle  riders; \nand will increase the economic benefit of the infrastructure investment.  \nIntegration with other transport modes, logistic centers, and urban characteristics.3  \n\n \nConsequently,  the  road  and  traffic  management  subcomponent  is  directly  responsive  to \n26. \nHefei\u2019s urban development plan, which calls for the expansion of Xinzhan Zone into a modern area \nwith commercial and residential areas cohabiting in harmony. The Project, therefore, will assist the \nHMG significantly in realizing these goals to develop in the Xinzhan Pilot Area a modern integrated \ntraffic management system that can be extended to other parts of Hefei and to other cities. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n3  HMG  has  built  a  zonal  vehicle  emissions  testing  center  near  the  Xinzhan  Zone  for  commercial  and  noncommercial \n\nvehicles to improve environmental monitoring. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \nTable A3.1: Assistance Funded by ADB for Urban Development

For the Wangtang II WWTP, the expansion of facilities will utilize existing land \nwithin the plant boundary. Hence, it will not require any resettlement. For the three subcomponents \nof  Shiwuli  WWTP  and  related  sewers,  Ershibu  River  and  Xinzhan  Road  infrastructure,  a  full \nresettlement  plan  (RP)  was  prepared.  For  the  remaining  five  subcomponents,  a  short  RP  was \nprepared.1  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nTo avoid or minimize resettlement impacts, local officials and village and street committees \nwere  consulted  extensively  during  the  feasibility  study  stages.  The  Project  will  affect  20  urban \ncommunities and 11 villages in three districts (Baohe, Luyang, and Yaohai), one development zone \n(Xinzhan), and two counties (Feidong and Feixi), all within Hefei municipality. Many of the affected \nrural communities are villages on the city fringe, which are already urbanizing (Table A9).  \n \n\nResettlement Impacts \n\nTable A9: Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\n \nRef: \n\nProject Subcomponent \nSite \n\n1.1 \n\nShiwuli WWTP \n\n1.2  Wangtang II WWTP \n\n1.3  Urban Sewer Network \n\n1.4  Qingxi Road Landfill \n\n2.1 \n\n2.2 \n\n2.3 \n\nErshibu River Improvement \n\nBanqiao River Improvement \n\nSili River Improvement \n\n2.4  Chao Lake Flood Control \n\n5.18 \n\n0 \n\n0.10 \n\n35.60 \n\n88.42 \n\n49.07 \n\n12.07 \n\n11.47 \n\nPermanent \nland \nacquisition \n(ha) \n\nOf which \ncultivated \n(ha) \n\nTemporary \nLand \nOccupation \n(ha) \n1.67 \n\nHouse \nDemolition \n(m2) \n\nAffected \nPersons \n(APs) \n\nBudget a  \n ($\u2019000) \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n26,170 \n\n180 \n\n11,328 \n\n0 \n\n256 \n\n0 \n\n4 \n\n131 \n\n2,364 \n\n1,420 \n\n242 \n\n827 \n\n841 \n\n0 \n\n38 \n\n2,576 \n\n24,675 \n\n10,461 \n\n4,080 \n\n1,531 \n\n3.37 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n70.44 \n\n49.07 \n\n11.53 \n\n9.31 \n\n93.65 \n\n2.67 \n\n8.67 \n\n4.67 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n11.89 \n\n3.1 \n\nXinzhan Zone Roads \n\n142.45 \n\n66,496 \n\n2,837 \n\n35,766 \n\nTotal \n\n8,081 \n\n29.57 \n\n79,968 \n\n237.37 \n\n344.36 \n\n104,174 \n\n \nAP = affected person, ha = hectare, m2 = square meter, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant.  \na Exchange rate: $1 = CNY7.9. \nSource: Hefei municipal government. \n \nThe  Project  will  permanently  requisition  344.36  hectare  (ha)  of  land,  of  which  69.0% \n3. \n(237.37  ha)  is  classified  as  cultivated  land.

The  Shiwuli  River  WWTP  subcomponent  involved  widening  two  roads  and \ndemolishing 23 units and households. These were undertaken using government funds. Similarly, \n                                                 \n1 Three  full  RPs:  (i)  Shiwuli  WWTP  and  sewer  network  subcomponent,  (ii)  Ershibu  River  comprehensive  treatment \nsubcomponent, and (iii) improved road infrastructure and traffic management in the Xinzhan Zone. Five short RPs: (i) \nBanqiao  River  comprehensive  treatment  subcomponent,  (ii)  improvement  of  the  closed  Qingxi  Road  landfill  site \nsubcomponent,  (iii)  comprehensive  ecological  and  environmental  control  along  Chao  Lake  of  Hefei  Municipality,  (iv) \nHefei  urban  sewerage  network  improvement  subcomponent,  and  (v)  Sili  River  rehabilitation  and  flood  control \nimprovement works subcomponent. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nAfter  consulting  with \n\nPolicy and Legal Framework \n\nlocal  governments  and  affected  persons  (APs), \n\nthe  sewer  network  subcomponent  involved  widening  one  road  and  demolishing  12  units  and \nhouseholds  using  government  funds.  The  Hefei  Industrial  Design  Institute  of  Coal  Ministry \nconducted due diligence for both subcomponents in August 2006, confirmed that no resettlement \nissues were outstanding. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nFor people who will be unavoidably affected by the Project, the resettlement objective is to \nachieve equal, or better, income and living standards, in line with the People\u2019s Republic of China \nlaws  and  regulations,  as  well  as  the  policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  The  compensation  for  permanent  land  loss  and  house  demolition  is \nbased  on  the  Land  Administration  Law  of  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (2004);  the  State  Council \nDecision  to  Deepen  Reform  and  Strictly  Enforce  Land  Administration  (Document  28  dated \nNovember 2004); Interim Methods for Acquisition of Collective-Owned Land of Hefei Municipality, \nHefei Municipal Government (HMG) (HMG [2003]138 effective 1 January 2003); Hefei Guidelines \nfor  Implementing  State  Council\u2019s  No.  28  Documents  (HMG  [2005]10);  and  Approval  on  Basic \nCompensation  Rate,  Price  Difference  of  Property  Ownership  Replacement,  and  Temporary \nResettlement Subsidies of Hefei Urban Housing Demolition, issued by HMG, (Hemi [2006] 32). The \ncutoff  date  for  eligibility  for  compensation  and  assistance  under  the  Project  will  be  the  date  the \nHMG approves the RPs. \n \n5. \nthe  project \nimplementing agencies (IAs) adopted a set of compensation standards based on the replacement \ncost  and  general  practice  in  the  project  districts  and  counties.  The  resettlement  principles \nestablished for the Project are: (i) wherever feasible, land acquisition and involuntary resettlement \nwill be avoided or minimized through the development of design alternatives and the choice of the \nbest  alternative;  (ii)  compensation  and  entitlements  provided  will  be  based  on  market  value  or \nreplacement value, and must be adequate to allow those affected to maintain or improve their pre-\nproject  standard  of  living;  (iii)  temporary  land  occupancy  and  the  period  of  disruption  are  to  be \nminimized;  (iv)  all  affected  people,  whether  legal  or  non-legal  residents,  are  to  be  taken  into \nconsideration and accounted for; (v) where the landholding per capita is not enough to maintain the \nprevious  livelihood  standards,  other  income-generating  activities  will  be  provided  for;  (vi) \nvulnerable  groups  and  the  floating  population  will  be  given  preference  in  such  matters  as \ncompensation,  housing  assignment,  transfer,  and  employment;  (vii)  all  those  affected  will  be \ninformed  adequately  about  eligibility,  compensation  rates  and  standards,  livelihood  and  income \nrestoration plans,  and project  timing;  and  (viii) close  monitoring  and  timely  actions  will  be carried \nout to identify and resolve problems as they arise.  \n \n6. \nFor land acquisition, a land compensation fee will be paid to the affected village and street \ncommittees,  while  a  resettlement  subsidy  due  to  land  loss  will  be  paid  to  affected  households. \nCompensation  for  young  crops,  auxiliaries,  and  other  assets  will  be  paid  directly  to  their  owners. \nCompensation for the loss of residential housing will be paid directly to the owners according to the \nappraised  value  of  the  property.  Displaced  persons  will  have  the  option  to  purchase  residential \nhouses,  get  a  replacement  house,  or  rebuild  their  houses  on  housing  plots  provided  to  them \nwithout  charge.  Compensation  for  the  loss  of  assets  or  income  of  enterprises  and  shops  will  be \npaid directly to the owners based on the negotiated agreements.  \n \nD. \n \nTo minimize the resettlement impact and restore their living conditions and livelihoods, the \n7. \nRPs  include  measures  for  relocation  and  income  restoration.  Different  schemes  for  income \nrestoration will be carried out according to the economic characteristics of the affected streets and \nvillages. The main income-restoration measures are (i) cash compensation, (ii) transfer from rural \nto  urban  registration  and  joining  in  the  urban  social  safeguard  net,  (iii)  provision  of  employment \nopportunities  during  project  construction  and  operation,  and  (iv)  provision  of  training  and \nin  economic \nemployment \n\ninformation.  Village  collectives  will \n\nResettlement and Rehabilitation  \n\nland  compensation \n\ninvest \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9          43 \n\nResettlement Cost and Fund Management  \n\nInformation Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance Procedures \n\ndevelopment  and  social  infrastructure,  according  to  the  needs  of  the  villagers.  Through  these \nmeasures, the APs should earn stable incomes that fully restore their living standards. \n \n8. \nIn addition, more attention will be paid to the compensation and rehabilitation of vulnerable \ngroups.  These  groups  will  receive  additional  assistance  as  follows:  (i)  if  an  affected  household \nowns  one  house  with  less  than  45  square  meters,  additional  compensation  will  be  provided;  (ii) \nlocal  government  will  provide  economic  or  low-rent  housing  for  vulnerable  families;  (iii)  the  local \nCivil Affaires Bureaus will include the vulnerable groups in the urban social safeguard net or rural \nsocial  safety  system;  and  (iv)  employment  opportunities  will  be  provided  to  seriously  affected \nvulnerable groups, especially women.  \n \nE. \n \n9. \nLand acquisition and resettlement, including contingencies and land taxes, is estimated to \ncost  CNY631.75  million  in  2006  prices  ($79.97  million),  representing  21.47%  of  the  project \ninvestment.  This  cost  is  included  in  the  Project  budget  and  will  be  funded  by  Hefei  Municipal \nFinance  Bureau.  Each  RP  for  the  eight  subcomponents  contains  a  detailed  budget  and  a \ncompensation  entitlement  matrix.  Compensation  funds  will  be  paid  and  used  according  to  the \ncompensation  policies  and  standards  defined  in  the  RPs,  under  the  supervision  of  the  internal \nmonitoring agencies and regular review by the external monitoring agency. Detailed measurement \nsurveys  will  be  conducted  in  each  affected  community,  village,  enterprise,  and  shop.  Further, \ncompensation  contracts  will  be  negotiated  and  signed  with  the  community  residents  committees \nand village committees, households, enterprises, and shop owners. \n \nF. \n \n10. \nThe  APs  were  fully  consulted  and  informed  during  the  preparation  of  the  RPs.  Local \nrepresentatives  participated  in  planning  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group  discussions,  public \nconsultation  workshops,  and  community  consultations;  and  their  comments  and  concerns  were \nintegrated  into  the  RPs.  The  draft  RPs  will  be  distributed  to  the  affected  districts  and  community \nresidents committees and villages, and resettlement information booklets were disseminated to the \nAPs  in  early  November  2006.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy,  the  RPs \nwere  posted  on  the  ADB  website  on  20  December  2006.  The  project  IAs  will  set  up  project \nresettlement  agencies  to  supervise  implementation,  continue  the  public  consultations,  monitor \nprogress, and deal with grievances. The grievance redress procedures are well established\u2014they \nare explained in the resettlement plans and referred to in the resettlement information booklets. \n \nG. \n \n11. \nThe  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for  supervising \nresettlement.  The  IAs  for  the  project  components  will  take  charge  of  resettlement  compensation \npayment and supervision as part of their functions. The resettlement implementation schedules are \nprepared based on the overall project preparation and construction timetable. No land acquisition \nor demolition will start until RPs are updated based on designs and approved by ADB. Some land \nacquisition is scheduled to begin in early 2007, and all components will be completed by the end of \n2008.  Housing  relocation  will  start  from  July  2007,  and  livelihood  and  living  conditions  will  be \nrestored to at least their pre-project level by the end of 2008.   \n \nH. \n \n12. \nInternal  and  external  monitoring  of  resettlement  will  be  conducted.  Each  IA  will  carry  out \ninternal supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance with the provisions of the RP. The PMO \nand IAs will engage an independent agency for semiannual monitoring and evaluation, followed by \nan  annual  report  1  year  after  the  completion  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  External \nmonitoring reports will be forwarded directly to the PMO and ADB. \n \n\nInstitutional Arrangement and Schedule  \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n\n \nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in (PRC): \n \nEnvironmental sustainability and poverty reduction have become central tasks in People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \nConsiderable progress has been made on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). However, progress on some \ngoals and targets has been slow with respect to improving the proportion of the population with access to safe drinking \nwater and reversing environmental degradation. The Project supports the achievement of the MDG for environmental \nsustainability (Goal 7), which aims to halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water \nand basic sanitation by 2015 (Target 10), through improved urban environmental management. \n \nThe  project  impact  area  of  Hefei  Urban  Environment  Improvement  Project  covers  four  districts  (Baohe,  Luyang, \nShushan and Yaohai) and three counties (Changfeng, Feidong, and Feixi) within Hefei City. It will benefit 4.5 million \npeople, including 2.61 million people directly and 1.89 million people indirectly. The poverty and social impacts of the \nProject  include:  (i)  improved  environmental  conditions  and  enhanced  sanitation  through  wastewater  treatment,  flood \nprevention and control, protection and landscaping of a former landfill site, and urban transport services within Hefei \nCity;  (ii)  increased  employment  and  income-generation  opportunities  from  temporary  job  creation  during  the \nconstruction  phase  and  permanent  job  creation  during  the  operational  phase;  (iii)  reduction  in  the  incidence  of \nwaterborne  and  airborne  diseases,  with  associated  reduction  in  medical  costs,  and  in  the  number  of  workdays  and \nschool days lost; (iv) reduced flooding with associated damages and economic losses; (v) reduced traffic congestion, \ntraffic accidents, and vehicle emission pollution; increased mobility; better and quicker access to markets, employment \nopportunities,  and  social  services;  and  accelerated  economic  development;  (vi)  value-added  benefits  from  local \nprocurement;  (vii)  improved  investment  conditions  to  stimulate  the  development  of  the  local  economy  to  create  new \njobs  and  income-generating  opportunities,  and  to  accelerate  the  rehabilitation  of  Hefei  City\u2019s  ecological  system;  and \n(viii) accelerated development of the tourism industry in Hefei City, particularly the Chao Lake area. As a result, the \nlocal  residents  of  Hefei  City  will  enjoy  a  better  quality  of  life  with  reduced  poverty;  increased  employment,  and \ninvestment and business opportunities; and improved health status. \n \nThe Project will provide 2,830 full-time jobs during construction, of which about 60% will be for the poor and women. \nThose temporarily employed in construction will benefit from additional training and experience that will provide them \nwith  opportunities  in  future  planned  infrastructure  projects.  Project  operations  will  create  1,080  full-time  permanent \njobs  directly  and  another  1,730  jobs  through  multiplier  effects,  generating  approximately  CNY45.00  million  in  wages \nper year. \n \nA health impact analysis  was conducted to estimate the health benefits associated  with  wastewater, improved flood \ncontrol,  and  improved  traffic  management.  In  estimating  the  potential  health  benefits  (savings)  attributable  to  the \nProject,  a  40%  reduction  in  waterborne  and  vector-borne  diseases  was  assumed  (World  Development  Report: \nInvestigating  Health,  World  Bank  1993).  The  \u201cwithout-project\u201d  scenario  projects  that  the  incidence  of  water-related \nhealth  costs  will  (i)  increase  in  real  terms  with  increasing  urbanization,  (ii)  increase  untreated  wastewater  volumes, \nand (iii) increase the pollution of receiving water bodies and generally degrade the urban environment because of lack \nof effective wastewater management services. Health costs have been conservatively assumed to increase by about \n10%  annually  from  2007  to  2032.  Health  benefits  have  been  estimated  for  the  \u201dwith-project\u201d  scenario,  starting  to \naccrue from 2012 (the Project\u2019s first full year of operations). As a result of improved environmental pollution control, \nthe population exposed to pollution-related diseases  will decline,  with the associated reduction in medical costs and \ndrop in number of workdays and school days lost due to sickness. Baseline costs of environmental diseases in Hefei \nare  estimated  at  some  CNY32.5  million  per  year.  The  net  present  value  of  the  benefits  attributable  to  the  Project, \nwhich will be mainly in urban areas, is estimated at CNY16.3 million ($2.1 million) in 2010\u20132032.  \n \nTo realize the full health benefits, the following will be required: (i) parallel improvements in public health education, (ii) \nhigher  standards  of  personal  hygiene,  (iii)  prevention  and  control,  and  (iv)  improved  housing  and  living  conditions. \nThese  will be  particularly important for the poor,  who are likely to suffer  most from the incidence of pollution-related \ndiseases.  The  arrangements  for  monitoring  health  benefits  will  be  incorporated  in  the  project  performance \nmanagement  system  to  be  established  for  comprehensive  project  impact  monitoring.  The  qualitative  benefits  of  the \nProject  will  be  (i)  reduced  exposure  to  waterborne  and  airborne  diseases  associated  with  treatment  of  a  greater \nproportion  of  wastewater  and  reduced  sewer  overflows,  and  less  water  bodies  receiving  wastewater  pollutants;  (ii) \nreduced groundwater contamination; and (iii) reduced vehicular emissions due to an improved traffic management. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10       45  \n \n\n \n\nThe most vulnerable groups including the poor, women, elderly, and the floating population, who are more vulnerable \nto  adverse  environmental  conditions  and  the  lack  of  financial  resources,  will  benefit  disproportionately  from  the \nimproved environmental quality and health benefits. Poor households and vulnerable groups, which tend to reside in \nareas with poor service levels and are less able to cope with the disruption and illness caused by poor services, will \ngain significant benefits from the Project. The improved wastewater management services and reductions in flooding \nand illness also  will reduce women\u2019s burden of  work. Poor households will receive tariff exemptions or subsidies for \nservices,  largely  offsetting  the  adverse  impacts  of  tariff  increases.  These  subsidies  are  in  addition  to  the  minimum \nlevel guarantees (MLG). \n \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                               Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention-M7 T10 \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe poverty analysis is based on published statistical data, socioeconomic questionnaire survey of 1,000 households, \nfocus group discussion, and key informant interviews in the nine subcomponent areas of Hefei City during the project \npreparatory  technical  assistance.  Unlike  the  rural  poverty  definition,  no  uniform  standard  for  the  urban  poverty  line \nexists  in  the  PRC.  In  general,  people  under  the  MLG  are  defined  as  urban  poor.  The  urban  poor  mostly  consist  of \npeople with no or low income, no or low capacity to work, no legal support, and/or no or low capability to work. People \nunder the MLG will receive MLG fund from Hefei Civil Affairs Bureau. In 2006, the MLG was CNY230 per capita per \nmonth.  Of  the  direct  and  indirect  beneficiary  population,  approximately  5.2%  or  89,440  people  of  the  total  urban \npopulation live under the MLG. \n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nStakeholder  analysis  was  conducted  during  the  poverty  and  social  assessment.  The  primary  stakeholders  of  the \nProject  are  urban  and  rural  residents,  floating  population,  project  affected  persons,  industries  and  businesses,  the \nexecuting  agency,  and  implementing  agencies.  The  secondary  stakeholders  of  the  Project  include  relevant \ngovernment agencies, such as All Women\u2019s Federation, Civil Affairs Bureau, Poverty Reduction Office, Health Bureau, \netc.  A  participatory  rapid  appraisal  method  and  approach  were  employed  for  the  poverty  and  social  impact \nassessment\u2014such as stakeholder consultation workshops, focus group discussion, and key informant interviews\u2014to \ngain  a  better  understanding  of  the  demand,  needs,  and  interests  of  the  stakeholders,  particularly  groups  that  are \nnormally  excluded  from  the  decision  making  process.  Two  rounds  of  public  consultations  in  the  project  areas  were \ncarried  out  to  prepare  the  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  the  resettlement  plans  (RP).  The  public \nconsultations  and  information  disclosure  included:  (i)  introducing  the  project  components  to  the  stakeholders;  (ii) \nsoliciting  ideas,  suggestions,  comments,  concerns,  and  critiques  on  the  potential  environmental  implications  of  the \nProject;  and  (iii)  presenting  the  findings  of  the  EIA  and  RP,  summarizing  potential  environmental  impacts  and \nmitigation  measure,  and  providing  answers  raised  by  workshop  participants.  Public  consultations  and  information \ndisclosure  of  resettlement  plans  were  conducted  during  surveys,  community  meetings,  interviews,  and  workshops. \nThe results of these meetings and concerns of the affected persons, particularly the poor and women, were integrated \ninto the RPs, which also describe the public consultation plan and grievance process. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nPublic consultation and participation have been the core elements of the project design, and will continue during the \nproject implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Ongoing consultations will also be carried out by the implementing \nagencies  to  understand  and  meet  the  evolving  needs  and  expectations  of  the  users,  as  well  as  increase  the \nawareness of the public, especially the beneficiaries, about the benefits of the Project. These also will encourage the \nactive  involvement  of  local  communities  to  maximize  their  support  to  the  Project,  promote  environmental  protection, \nand  raise  the  social  acceptance  of  tariff  increase.  Public  consultations  will  be  held  during  project  implementation  to \ndiscuss  and  obtain  feedback  on  tariff  adjustments  and  affordability  for  consumers  and  other  key  stakeholders, \nparticularly the poor. Existing participatory policies that rely on public hearings to gain approval for tariff adjustments \nwill  be  enforced  to  provide  the  mechanism  for  these  consultations.  The  public  consultation  and  participation  will  be \ncarried  out  throughout  the  EIA  and  environmental  management  plan  implementation.  The  consultations,  including  a \ngrievance  mechanism,  will  continue  during  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  to  allow  the  problems  and  needs  of \naffected persons to be addressed properly in a timely manner before project implementation. \n \n \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nD.  Gender Development \n\n Strategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nData  from  the  household  survey  and  focus  group  discussion  indicated  that  women  are  primarily  responsible  for \nwastewater disposal and management, cleanup after flooding, and care for the sick and elders. Time and efforts spent \non these activities will reduce the time for women to engage in income-generating activities, family entertainment, or \nleisure  time.  Lack  of  services  for  flood  control,  wastewater,  and  urban  transport  contribute  to  gender  inequities  in \nburden  of  household  work.  The  poverty  and  social  assessment  indicated  that  women  strongly  support  the  Project. \nWomen have perceived that the Project  will improve the urban living environment, create employment opportunities, \nand  reduce  the  incidence  of  waterborne  and  respiratory  diseases.  To  maximize  the  project  benefits,  women  will  be \nprioritized for employment and training opportunities generated from the Project\u2019s construction and operation phases. \nThe  implementing  agencies  will  adopt  proactive  employment  programs  for  the  women.  More  than  30%  of  the \nemployment opportunities will be filled by women and the poor during the project construction phase, and 25% during \nthe operation phase. \n\n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \nE.

Sensitivity \nanalysis has been used to evaluate adverse risks that would \nresult  in  a  higher  tariff.  An  83%  wastewater  tariff  increase \ncan be assumed for the purpose of the affordability analysis. \nIt  indicates  that  households  in  the  lowest  income  class  will \nnot  have  a  problem  with  affordability  of  a  tariff  increase \nsince  the  share  of  income  expended  for  the  service \n(combined  water  and  wastewater) \nthe  5% \nbenchmark. The impact of expenditure increase for water is \nconsidered to be minimal given that the total percent paid by \neach  household  is  currently  less  than  1%  of  their  total \nincome. Impact on households in the lowest income bracket \nwill  be  mitigated  through  the  existing  tariff  reduction  and \nsubsidy program. \n\nis  below \n\nThe  project  area  has  no  ethnic  minority  groups.

Projections  were  prepared  to  assess  the \nfinancial performance of HWTAD combined with wastewater financing responsibilities of the Hefei \nFinance  Bureau  (HFB).  Some  WWTP  operations  have  been  contracted  to  private  sector \ncompanies.  HFB  recovers  the  budgeted  costs  allocated  to  HWTAD,  for  the  sewer  piping  system \nand for WWTP contract services, from wastewater tariff revenues collected on the water bill. The \namount  allocated  is  about  80%  of  the  CNY125  million  in  wastewater  revenues  (based  on  water \nsales data). \n \n2. \nfinancial \nperformance  was  based  on  a  period  of  operations  of  20  years  following  project  commissioning \nwhich  starts  from  2009.  The  sustainability  analysis  treats  wastewater  operations  as  if  they  are \nmanaged by a single self-financing entity. Revenues in the analysis are based on water sales and \nthe  wastewater  tariff.  The  results  of  two  options  for  the  latter  are  shown:  first  with  zero  tariff \nincrease and second with an 83% tariff increase.  \n \n3. \n \n\nFinancial  projections  were  prepared  until  2042,  but \n\nImportant features of the analysis include: \n\nthe  assessment  of \n\nAll calculations based on an annual time step. \nUse of standard accounting relationships to develop three basic statements. \nSeparate projection of \u201cwith project\u201d and \u201cwithout project\u201d relationships. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv)  Opening  values  in  the  balance  sheet  estimated  from  available  information  of  long-\n\nterm debt and assumptions regarding assets, other liabilities, and capital.  \nProject construction costs estimated from costs given in base year (2006) prices.  \n(v) \n(vi) \nPhysical contingencies estimated as 10% of civil works and 5% of other costs.  \n(vii)  Price  contingencies  account  for  cumulative  cost  inflation  over  the  construction \n\n(viii)  Annual project operating costs estimated based on reported facility operating costs. \n(ix)  Recurrent costs for asset management based on the value of fixed assets. \n(x) \n(xi)  Domestic and international inflation assumptions, from the Asian Development Bank \n\nDepreciation \u2013 4.0% of original value of fixed assets. \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012+ \n\nDomestic rate of price inflation (%/year) \n\nForeign rate of price inflation (%/year) \n\n3.0 \n\n2.8 \n\n3.2 \n\n1.2 \n\n2.7 \n\n1.2 \n\n2.8 \n\n1.2 \n\n2.0 \n\n1.2 \n\n1.2 \n\n1.2 \n\n          Sources:  Asian Development Bank estimates, Hefei municipal government estimates. \n\n(xii)  Wastewater revenues based on charges levied against water sales.

This  should \ncontinue since the HFB essentially provides sufficient funds from tariff revenues to cover HWTAD \noperating  costs.  The  remainder  is  kept  to  cover  capital  costs.  Most  HWTAD  operating  costs  are \ncontractual, however. Data indicate a rapid growth of operations over the past 3 year period due to \nincreases in WWTP capacity. Pipeline costs have fallen from 24% of total costs in 2003 to 10% in \n2005 (actual HWTAD administrative costs have similarly fallen to less than 1.6%). The wastewater \nsystem  capital  investments  for  2003\u20132005  were  CNY311  million,  with  94%  of  the  total  expended \non  treatment  capacity.  Project  wastewater  investments  allocate  28%  to  pipelines,  which  will  help \naddress the imbalance between transport and treatment capacity.  \n \nWastewater influent to existing WWTPs in Hefei is estimated to comprise 56% wastewater \n5. \ndischarged  by  customers  connected  to  the  sewers  and  44%  water  originating  from  rivers, \ngroundwater infiltration, and storm water runoff flows into the sewers. The actual wastewater share \nwill need to increase, or excess treatment capacity will be built. This should not be difficult if inflows \nfrom rivers are controlled. \n \n6. \nIn the base case sustainability analysis, the existing tariff was adjusted to keep pace with \ninflation, but was not increased otherwise. This assumed that changes in contract amounts owed \nto  operators  also  would  be  inflation-based  only.  Costs  based  on  revenues  in  2005  were  already \n5%\u201310% below costs based on unit costs, and the contract allows costs and revenues to increase \nevery  two  years.  Hence,  a  more  likely  scenario  is  that  costs  and  revenues  both  will  increase.  A \nwastewater tariff increase is being proposed by 2007. It is likely to be 50%, increasing the domestic \ntariff  from  CNY0.6  per  cubic  meter  (m3)  to  CNY0.9  per  m3.  Hefei  municipal  government  (HMG) \nrecognizes  that  further  increases  will  be  necessary.  To  allow  full  cost  recovery,  HMG  has \nsuggested  an  83%  increase  from  the  current  tariff  to  CNY1.1  per  m3  in  2010.  The  results  of  this \nalternative  also  have  been  calculated.  Since  costs  and  revenues  are  likely  to  go  up,  the  result \nshould be somewhere between the two alternatives. As at present, not all of the proceeds need be \ngiven to the WWTP, particularly if they are not funding their own debt. \n \nFinancial performance ratios (Table A11.1) for total wastewater operations indicate that the \n7. \nproject  subcomponents  are  financially  sustainable.  Estimated  operating  ratios,  returns  to  net \nassets, and profit margins are acceptable, given the base assumptions regarding tariffs and costs. \nOther  indicators  are  acceptable  except  for  the  debt-equity  ratio,  which  exceeds  the  ADB \nbenchmark  level  of  0.6  in  the  first  4  years  after  commissioning  (only  in  the  first  year  with  the \nindicated tariff increase). The high initial debt-equity ratios reflect the financing strategy for recent \ncapital investments and the ADB-funded investment. By 2014, this ratio will be below 0.6. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11       49  \n \n\n \n\nTable A11.1: Financial Ratios  \n(values for the first 20 years of operations) \n\n \n\n \n\nNo. of Tariff Increase \n\n83% Tariff Increase \n\nTarget \n\nAve \n\nMax \n\nMin \n\nAve \n\nMax \n\nMin \n\nPerformance Ratio \nOperating Ratio  \n(operating expenditures/operating revenues) \nRate of Profit  \n(net after tax earnings/net assets) \nProfit Margin  \n(net after-tax earnings /operating revenues) \nCurrent Ratio  \n(current assets/current liabilities) \nRatio of Debt to Equity  \n(total long-term debt/net assets) \nDebt Service Coverage (cash to pay  \ndebt service costs/debt service costs) \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n0.54 \n\n0.62 \n\n0.50 \n\n0.31 \n\n0.36 \n\n0.27 \n\n0.09 \n\n0.10 \n\n0.07 \n\n0.12 \n\n0.24 \n\n0.07 \n\nNot app. \n\n0.36 \n\n0.46 \n\n0.21 \n\n0.69 \n\n0.82 \n\n0.55 \n\n22.6 \n\n46.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n71.6 \n\n147.4 \n\n11.3 \n\n0.40 \n\n1.22 \n\n0.03 \n\n0.19 \n\n0.78 \n\n0.01 \n\n3.87 \n\n6.45 \n\n1.90 \n\n9.28 \n\n16.81 \n\n4.05 \n\n<1.0 \n\n0.06 \n\n>1.0 \n\n<0.6 \n\n>1.0 \n\n \n\nThe project financing plan indicates that tariff revenues will be used to provide financing of \n8. \nCNY96  million  during  loan  implementation.  The  pro  forma  analysis  suggests  that  more  than \nCNY140 million should be available for this purpose by 2010. If tariffs are increased, as proposed, \nthe amount would be more. \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Return Analysis of Revenue-Generating Components \n\n9. \nFinancial  internal  rates  of  return  were  estimated  for  the  Shiwuli  WWTP  and  Wangtang \nWWTP  subcomponents,  assuming  a  scenario  in  which  these  WWTPs  are  operated  as  self-\nfinancing entities that are financially independent of other parts of the wastewater system, but are \nrequired to pay their share of wastewater delivery costs. For this analysis, an 83% increase in the \nwastewater tariff by 2010 was assumed, as HMG agreed is feasible. The financial internal rate of \nreturn for each plant and the combined wastewater components is 4.3%, exceeding the weighted \naverage cost of capital (2.6%). Further, it is generally robust to all tested shocks.  \n \nThe  financial  analysis  assumes  that  the  50,000  m3/day  to  be  installed  at  Shiwuli  WWTP \n10. \nunder the Project is extended later to its full 100,000 m3/day design capacity. This is in HWTAD\u2019s \nplan,  and  will  be  implemented  when  the  50,000  m3/day  is  reached.  Demand  exists  at  Shiwuli \nWWTP subcomponent for a full 100,000 m3/day plant. The Wangtang II WWTP includes 100,000 \nm3/day of new capacity. This is expected to provide excess capacity to meet the planned growth of \nthe Wangtang service area. HWTAD has committed to provide sewer piping as necessary. \n \nThe  long  run  financial  average  incremental  cost  per  m3  treated  of  the  WWTP \n11. \nsubcomponents  are:  Wangtang  II  (100,000  m3/day),  CNY0.9;  Shiwili  (50,000  m3/day),  CNY1.1; \naverage,  CNY1.0.  These  include  an  allowance  for  the  sewage  system,  and  could  be  seen  as  a \nreasonable  basis  for  an  increased  tariff.  They  can  be  compared  with  unit  costs  quoted  by  the \npresent WWTP varying from CNY0.50 to CNY0.75. Around 10% should be added for the sewage \nsystem plus interest on capital. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Sustainability of Nonrevenue Components \n\nApart  from  three  wastewater  components,  other  components  do  not  generate  revenue.  \n\n12. \nThey involve public infrastructure managed by government departments with limited or no revenue-\ngenerating capacity. For these entities, the sustainability analysis is based on recent accounts of \nthe  HMG.  Project  recurrent  costs  are  compared  with  government  recurrent  revenues.  Financial \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nsustainability is demonstrated if the Project\u2019s incremental impact on recurrent costs is small. Table \nA11.2 summarizes debt servicing costs for the nonrevenue components of the Project. As shown, \noperating,  maintenance,  and  repair  costs  are  conservatively  estimated  to  be  CNY41  million. \nTherefore, recurrent costs, debt service, and operation and maintenance are CNY166 million. \n \n13. \nTotal  government  revenues  and  expenditures  are  in  Table  A11.3.  Revenues  and \nexpenditures  have  grown  quickly  in  recent  years  for  the  Hefei  and  Xinzhan  Zone  governments. \nEstimated  recurrent  costs  are  compared  with  government  revenues  and  expenditures  in  Table \nA10.4.  For  Hefei,  recurrent  costs  represent  a  small  portion  of  budget  and  total  revenues  and \nexpenditures, and are not expected to jeopardize government fiscal sustainability. The figures for \nXinzhan  Zone  are  larger.  Recurrent  costs  are  about  7%  of  budget  revenues  and  4%  of  total \nrevenues. This represents a higher fiscal burden (5.5% compared with 1.1%), though one that is \nstill sustainable for this component, particularly if revenues continue to increase at recent rates. \n  \n\nTable A11.2: Recurrent Costs for Nonrevenue-Generating Components \n\nItem \n\nADB Loan \n\nTotal Loan Amount (CNY \u2018000) \nWastewater Component Loans (CNY \u2018000) \nLoans for Components Funded out of Government Budgets (CNY \u2018000) \n\n1,200,000 \n400,000 \n\nLocal bank \nloan \n440,000 \n120,000 \n\nEnterprise \nBond \n\nHefei Municipal Government Components \nXinzhan Zone Component \nTotal \n\nAnnual Debt Service Cost (CNY \u2018000/year) \n\nHefei Municipal Government Components \nXinzhan Zone Component \nTotal \n\nEstimated Operating and Maintenance Costsc (CNY \u2018000/year) \n\nHefei Municipal Government Componentsb \nXinzhan Zone Componentc \nTotal \n\n512,000 \n288,000 \n800,000 \n \n44,241 \n24,885 \n69,126 \n\n \n \n \n\n320,000 \n0 \n320,000 \n \n43,478 \n0 \n43,478 \n\n \n \n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank \na Estimated as rising to 3% of the original value of the investment for Hefei municipal government components.

However, the effects on \nthe  average  income  group  also  are  shown.  The  scope  of  the  analysis  encompasses  urban \nhouseholds that receive wastewater services from the local governments. The analysis considers \nthe  wastewater  tariff,  but  not  any  other  fees  or  taxes  that  might  be  used  to  finance  the  project \ncomponents.  The following sections of this appendix (i) define the poverty levels that are used in \nthe  analysis,  (ii)  provide  a  profile  of  the  expenditures  of  poor  households,  (iii)  review  poverty \nreduction policies of local governments, (iv) evaluate impacts of increased wastewater tariffs, and \n(v)  recommend  measures  to  reduce  the  impacts  of  increased  wastewater  tariffs  on  poor \nhouseholds. \n \nB. \n\nPoverty Levels \n\n2. \nThe analysis of poverty considers two poverty lines: one representing absolute poverty and \na  second  representing  relative  poverty.  The  absolute  poverty  line  is  based  on  household \nrequirements  for  basic  food  and  non-food  expenditures.  Measures  of  relative  poverty  include  the \nadditional income needed to pay for social obligations such as funerals and weddings. Published \npoverty  lines  that  are  assumed  to  correspond  to  absolute  and  relative  poverty  are  provided  in \nTable A12.1.  \n \n\nTable A12.1: Urban Poverty Lines for the People\u2019s Republic of Chinaa \n\nItem \n\nPer Capita per Year \n\nPer Capita per Month \n\nPoverty Lines Assumed to Represent Absolute Poverty \nNational Bureau of Statistics, 2000b \nMay 2000 Poverty Conferenceb \nInland cities \nCoastal cities \nPoverty Lines Assumed to Represent Relative Poverty \nOfficial municipal poverty lines, 35 major cities, 1998c \n197 \nAverage \n143 \nMinimum (Nanchang) \n319 \nMaximum (Shenzhen) \nHefei (2006) \n230 \na Source: Asian Development Bank, May 2004.

Water Consumption \n\n5. \nData  provided  by  the  Hefei  Water  Supply  Company  (HWSC)  indicate  that  average  per \ncapita  domestic  water  use  is  170  litres  per  capita  per  day  (lpcd)  based  on  the  registered \npopulation.  The  consumption  could  be  as  low  as  121  lpcd  if  the  entire  unregistered  or  floating \npopulation  were  serviced  by  the  HWSC  and  received  a  water  bill.  The  actual  consumption  rate \nlikely lies somewhere between these two amounts, since only a portion of the floating population \nwill be serviced through a water meter identified as a domestic service. Circumstances of persons \nin  the  floating  population  who  are  not  serviced  by  a  domestic  meter  include  (i)  persons  living \n\u201crough\u201d  or  the  homeless,  (ii)  workers  in  construction  camps  at  building  sites,  (iii)  other  workers \nliving on the premises of their workplace, and (iv) persons in un-serviced housing (suburban areas \nor  informal  housing).  Data  is  not  available  to  determine  the  actual  consumption  rate  of  persons \nserviced through a domestic meter and paying a water bill. A rate of 150 lpcd is assumed for this \nanalysis. \n \n6. \nDomestic water consumption is known to increase in response to increasing income levels \nand  to  fall  in  response  to  increasing  tariffs.  Elasticities  are  parameters  used  by  economists  to \nmeasure these responses. The following elasticities are assumed for this analysis: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nPrice elasticity of domestic water demand = \u20130.33. \nIncome elasticity of domestic water demand = 0.30. \n\n \nE. \n\nLocal Government Poverty-Reduction Policies \n\nThe  primary  program  supporting  registered  poor  families  is  a  basic  subsidy,  called  the \n7. \nminimum  living  guarantee,  designed  to  maintain  a  minimum  level  of  income.  Registered  families \nwith incomes below the official poverty line receive help under this program. Subsidies are meant \nto  cover  all  expenses,  including  the  water  bill.  The  size  of  this  security  payment  makes  up  the \ndifference  between  the  poverty  line  and  the  actual  income  of  the  household.  The  official  poverty \nline in Hefei is CNY230 per person per month. \n \n8. \nSome  cities  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  offer  other  poverty-reduction  programs  in \naddition to the minimum living guarantee. In Hefei, registered households below the official poverty \nline receive the first 4 cubic meters (m3) of water consumed per month at no charge. The cost of \nthis program to HWSC is offset by a subsidy from the government.1 \n \nF. \n\nTariff Impacts on Poor Households \n\n9. \nThe Project might require wastewater tariffs to increase. Hefei municipal government plans \nto increase the wastewater tariff by 50% to CNY0.9 per m3 in 2007 and possibly to CNY1.1 per m3 \nby 2010. The tariff increases will achieve full cost recovery, comply with state government policy on \nthe wastewater tariff, and likely account for funding requirements that go beyond project financing \nneeds. \n \n10. \nEstimates were made of monthly household water use, the resulting household water and \nwastewater bill for low-income households, average household subsidy based on household size \ninformation  from  the  Anhui  statistical  yearbook,  and  water  demand  assumptions  (Table  A12.5). \nThe 50% tariff increase is used in this analysis as a base, though the effects of an 83% increase to \nCNY 1.1 per m3 also are shown. \n \n11. \nBased on the analysis summarized in Table A12.5, households would appear to be able to \nafford  the  tariff  increase,  even  if  they  are  in  the  lowest  income  class  receiving  no  water  subsidy \n                                                 \n1  In 2006, 5.2% of the urban population in Hefei had incomes below the official poverty line associated with the MLG. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12       55  \n \n\n \n\nbecause  they  are  not  registered.  With  the  high  83%  tariff  increase,  the  share  of  that  group\u2019s \nincome  expended  for  the  service  is  3.9%,  which  is  below  the  5%  benchmark  assumed  for  water \nand wastewater together.   \n \nG. \n\nMitigation of Tariff Impacts \n\n12. \nPoor  households  have  little  scope  for  absorbing  even  small  tariff  increases,  given  their \ncurrent allocation of expenditures. Low-income households experiencing the most extreme poverty \nare the most likely to be adversely affected by the tariff increase. Factors contributing to extreme \npoverty  include  elevated  health  care  costs  associated  with  poor  health  of  a  household  member, \nand single-person households that preclude sharing common costs among several persons. Such \nhouseholds might require additional support if their water bill increases. The main policies used to \nsupport poor households facing increasing tariffs are lifeline tariffs, water bill discounts, and direct \nsubsidies. As the lifeline tariff is a poorly targeted policy that benefits all households, not just those \nneeding support, it is not recommended. The existing water bill discount is a much better poverty-\nreduction measure, because it can be targeted properly at poor households. Consideration could \nbe given to extending it to non-registered households. \n \n\nTable A12.5: Affordability Analysis Based on Official Poverty Lines \nLow Income \u2013 \nSecond Decile \n3.3 \n\nLowest Income \u2013 First Decile  \n\nLower 5% \n\nUpper 5% \n\n3.5 \n\n3.3 \n\nAverage \nIncome \n\n3.0 \n\nItem \n \nHousehold size \nMonthly disposable income \n\nPer capita \nPer household \nWater use (tons/mo) \n\nWater and wastewater tariff \n\nExisting  \nWith Project  \n\nExisting  \nWith Project  \n% increase \n\nExisting  \nWith Project  \n% increase \n\nExisting  \nWith Project  \n% increase \n\nNo subsidy \nSubsidy \n\nWater and wastewater bill, no subsidy \n\nWater and wastewater bill, subsidy \n\n205.2 \n712.0 \n\n294.5 \n1,021.9 \n\n355.4 \n1,186.9 \n\n626.0 \n1,846.6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11.4 \n10.9 \n\n1.80 \n2.06 \n14.2 \n\n20.6 \n22.5 \n9.3 \n\n13.4 \n14.3 \n6.7 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n12.0 \n11.5 \n\n1.80 \n2.06 \n14.2 \n\n21.6 \n23.6 \n9.3 \n\n21.6 \n23.6 \n9.3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n12.7 \n12.2 \n\n1.80 \n2.06 \n14.2 \n\n22.9 \n25.0 \n9.3 \n\n22.9 \n25.0 \n9.3 \n\nIncome share of the Water and wastewater bill  \n(50% tariff increase) \n\nIncome share of the Water and wastewater bill  \n(83% tariff increase) \n\nNo subsidy \nSubsidy \n\n \n1.8% \n1.8% \nSources: World Bank.

The  economic  analysis  also  evaluates  the \nindividual  subcomponents  for  least  costs  and  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).  Economic \nanalysis  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects  and  Economic  Analysis  Retrospective  2005:  Strengthening  ADB\u2019s \nAid Effectiveness. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of the Project \n\n1. \n\nRationale for the Project \n\n2. \nThe primary motivation for the investment plan is the increasing concern over the effects of \neconomic  growth  on  environmental  quality  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  Continuing \nurbanization  has  resulted  in  water  and  air  pollution,  and  in  the  potential  for  increasing  water \nshortages. Surface, groundwater, and air pollution pose risks for public health and the environment \nin general.  Pollution also is starting to constrain national and local development.  \n \n3. \nHefei  City  urban  population  increased  by  a  third  during  the  last  5-year  plan,  and  real  per \ncapita  gross  domestic  product  doubled  in  each  of  the  last  two  plan  periods.  The  same  growth  is \nforecast in the 11th Five-Year Program (2006\u20132010), and is also expected for the period starting \n2010. The urban part of the city lies along the Nanfei River. The Nanfei runs into Chao Lake, which \nis  a  source  for  the  Yangtze  River.  The  waters  of  the  Nanfei  and  Chao  Lake  are  polluted  and \nclassified as suitable only for agriculture and landscaping. A potential major urban recreational and \nenvironmental benefit is all but unused. The Project contains subcomponents that will affect water \npollution  directly  by  cleaning  rivers  and  treating  wastewater.  While  urban  growth  in  many  PRC \ncities  has  led  to  serious  air  pollution,  Hefei  has  not  experienced  that.  However,  further  urban \ngrowth is expected to lead to problems unless they are controlled early. An important part of the \nProject\u2019s urban road infrastructure subcomponent will be traffic management to control congestion, \naccidents, and pollution. \n \nAnother major outcome of the Project is flood control. Economic problems from floods have \n4. \nalways  existed,  and  Hefei  has  been  nearly  inundated  on  several  occasions  in  the  past.  The  city \nhas major flood control investments, and the Nanfei is now controlled to a 1-in-100 year flooding \nfrequency throughout urban Hefei. The latest step, included in the Project, is to decrease flooding \nto  a  1-in-100  year  frequency  in  the  three  major  tributary  rivers  of  the  Nanfei,  which  run  into  or \nthrough  urban  areas,  and  to  between  1-in-20  and  1-in-40  in  the  parts  of  more  rural  Hefei  that \nborder Chao Lake.  \n \n\n2. \n\nRationale for Public Intervention \n\n5. \nThe serious problems with pollution and flooding demonstrate that private sector responses \nalone  are  inadequate.  Generators  of  wastewater  have  the  incentive  only  to  convey  their \nwastewater far enough downstream to avoid polluting themselves. They do not have any economic \nincentive to treat the wastewater at the point of discharge. Vehicle drivers around the world do not \nrealize  that  the  air  pollution  they  cause  affects  them  directly  and  has  a  cost  to  themselves  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 13       57  \n \n\n \n\nothers. While the private sector is the victim of flooding, the causes are normally too far away or \ntoo large for the sector to be able to deal with economically. \n \n6. \nThe  investment  plan  involves  government  intervention  at  several  different  levels.  The \ncentral  Government  has  prepared  a  national  level  environmental  protection  plan  for  Chao  Lake. \nThe Anhui provincial government  has prepared a Chao Lake flood control plan, which has led to \naction by Hefei, one of the two regional level governments that front the lake. Municipal and county \ngovernments,  particularly  Hefei,  are  making  individual  investments  in  the  flood  control,  river \ncleanup,  and  wastewater  treatment  works.  They  will  be  involved  in  managing  the  completed \nfacilities.  \n \n7. \nGovernment  involvement  is  sound  at  each  level.  Government  has  a  role  in  controlling \nexternalities  from  discharges  of  untreated  wastewater,  coordinating  the  management  of  surface \nwater quality, and controlling floodwater. Government involvement in individual projects is justified \nsince urban flood and water quality control, wastewater management, and urban roads are natural \nmonopolies.  The  local  government  is  adopting  various  strategies  to  manage  these  projects  and \nutilities.  Where  output  cannot  be  sold  reasonably,  local  government  departments  will  be  the \nmanagers  and  maintainers.  Local  governments  will  own  revenue-earning  utilities,  which  will  be \nmanaged  as  independent  public  enterprises.  Contracting  out  operations  and  maintenance  of  the \nwastewater treatment plants (WWTP) to the private sector is encouraged.  \n \n\n2. \n\nGoals of the Investment Plan \n\n8. \nThe  plan  has  general  and  specific  goals.  The  general  plans  for  economic  growth  and \ndevelopment,  at  the  level  of  Hefei  municipal  government  (HMG),  Anhui  Province,  and  PRC  as  a \nwhole,  provide  the  basis  or  context  for  the  goals  specific  to  the  investment  plan.  The  plan \nrecognizes  that  achieving  these  goals  will  require  protecting,  improving,  and  maintaining \nenvironmental quality, particularly surface water and air quality. \n \n9. \nThe  goals  most  relevant  to  the  investment  plan  come  from  the  11th  Hefei  Environmental \nPlan. Key features are goals for surface water. These are based on five  main classifications, set \naccording to the intended use of the water. The State Environmental Protection Administration sets \nthe  water  quality  goals  for  some  key,  strategic  river  reaches.  More  generally,  the  relevant \nenvironmental protection department at a county, municipal, or provincial level sets the local water \nquality goal. In Hefei urban areas, the goal is limited only to increasing surface water quality so that \n100% meets Class V. The city\u2019s drinking water does not come from the Nanfei, but upstream from \nthe  Dafangyin  and  Dongpu  reservoirs.  Even  those  are  not  yet  suitable  to  be  centralized  drinking \nwater  sources  as  they  can  contain  too  much  nitrogen  and  phosphorous.  The  plan  aims  to \nstrengthen  source  protection  to  ensure  water  of  at  least  Class  II  in  the  reservoirs.  Air  quality  in \nHefei is reasonable. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are Class I, while particulate matter (PM10) \nis between Class I and Class II. The plan aims to at least maintain that quality as the city grows.  \n \n\n4. \n\nDesign of the Plan \n\nA unique, least-cost way to achieve all project goals rarely can be found, and any plan that \n10. \nsatisfies  those  goals  at  minimum  cost  is  acceptable  in  principle.  Standard  economic  theory \nprovides  a  least-cost  plan,  based  on  economic  incentives,  for  revenue-earning  activities.  For \nwastewater  management,  this  plan  depends  on  a  centralized  system,  including  sewers  and \ntreatment  plants.  All  point-sources  should  be  connected  to  the  sewer  system,  and  the  sewers \nshould  discharge  to  treatment  plants.  The  Project  will  be  an  important  source  of  assistance  in \nhelping the Hefei plan meet that condition.  \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nThe  other  components  of  the  Project  do  not  earn  revenue.  In  these  cases,  social  choice \n11. \ntechniques must  be  used  to  help  design  the  plan.  Such  techniques  include  benefit-cost  analysis, \nthe  results  of  which  are  discussed  in  Section  C.3.  Another  important  element  promotes  the \nimportance  of  projects  that  will  assist  the  poor.  Poverty-related  subcomponent  effects  are \ndiscussed in Appendix 12 and are summarized in Table A13.1. \n \n\nTable A13.1: Review of Project Effects on the Poor \n\nProject Component \n\nProject Effects \n\nIntegrated Treatment \n\n- Ershibu River  \n\n- Banqiao River  \n\n- Sili River  \n\nChao Lake Flooding \nWastewater Sewers and \nTreatment  \n- Shiwuli WWTP \n- Wangtang II WWTP \n- Hefei Sewer Network  \nQingxi Road Landfill Site \n\nXinzhan Zone Project \n\nThese subcomponents will provide flood control, drainage, and sewerage. They also \nwill provide riverside access and recreational areas, which are expected to be free. \nThe poor will gain. \nThis subcomponent is in a relatively poor inner city area, which will maximize its \npoverty-related benefits. \nThe benefits of this subcomponent will grow as migrants move in to take jobs in the \nnewly developed Xinzhan Zone. \nThe recreational facilities are more upscale. Being closer to the city center, the area \nwill be ripe for gentrification. The poor will gain if land and property sales are not \nrestricted. \nPoor farmers will be major beneficiaries. \nThe rich can protect themselves from the harmful effects of uncollected and untreated \nsewage. As the poor cannot, they will gain the most. \nThis will also control the quality of water possibly used by WTP No. 4. \nAs above. \nAs above. \nThe subcomponent will control seepage of dangerous leachates into the Nanfei \nRiver, which runs through the city to Chao Lake. The poor are the most likely users of \nriver and lake water. \nTransport links will allow the development of new industry and provide jobs for poor \nimmigrants. Harmful side effects (pollution and congestion) will be controlled. \n\nWTP = water treatment plant, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant. \n \nOther relevant elements of social choice relate to the means to ensure that decisions taken \n12. \nhave  the  support  of  the  people  in  whose  name  the  decisions  are  made.  The  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance household survey asked for opinions on various government services. Highest \npriorities  were  education  and  health,  followed  by  wastewater,  and  flood  and  storm  water  control. \nWhen high as well as highest priority was included, roads and public transport also had more than \n90% support. \n \nC. \n\nAnalysis of Individual Subcomponents \n\n1. \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis of Individual Subcomponents \n\n13. \nThe least-cost analysis ensures that each subcomponent is designed optimally to meet the \ngoals  of  the  Project.  The  least-cost  analysis  should  cover  all  feasible  alternatives  for  a  given \nsubcomponent, including variations in location, timing, technology, and content. Ideally, least-cost \nanalysis  also  would  cover  the  planning  horizon  or  capacity  of  the  plant,  though  capacity  often  is \nconstrained by other factors.  \n \n14. \nIn  summary,  the  only  real  questions  that  remain  relate  to  the  timing  of  demand  for  (i)  the \nWangtang II WWTP, (ii) some of the recreational facilities included in the integrated river treatment \nsubcomponents, and (iii) the northern part of the Xinzhan Zone road subcomponent. These are all \ndemand-related questions and are discussed in Section C.2. Otherwise, the results of the analysis \nconfirm that the preferred options given for the subcomponents are least-cost.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 13       59  \n \n\n \n\n2.  \n\nDemand for Subcomponents \n\n15. \nThe  subcomponents  whose  output  will  be  sold  are  in  the  wastewater  sector,  the  two \nWWTPs,  and  the  sewerage  network.  Following  past  practice  in  Hefei,  revenues  for  these \ncomponents will be determined by costs, and will be paid from wastewater tariffs collected from all \npiped water consumers as part of their water tariff bill. Demand for the subcomponents will depend \non wastewater output in their supply areas, as well as the ability of the collection system to move \nthat wastewater to the WWTP. In the case of the Shiwuli WWTP, forecast output is more than five \ntimes  treatment  capacity.  As  such,  full  usage  of  the  plant  should  pose  no  difficulties,  even  if  it  is \nextended  to  the  full  100,000  cubic  meter  per  day  (m3/day)  capacity.  For  Wangtang  (I  and  II), \nhowever, forecast capacity is about equal to forecast wastewater output. Collecting all this output \nwill be difficult, and it is uncertain that the budget for the collection system is sufficient. In addition, \nthe  wastewater  forecasts  rely  on  new  and  planned  developments  in  several  areas.  While  these \ndevelopments  are  included  in  the  11th  Hefei  Environmental  Plan,  that  plan  was  drafted  before \nrecent changes in national policy were introduced. These changes will (i) move national emphasis \nfrom urban back to a more balanced urban and rural policy, (ii) instruct local planners to restrain \ngrowth if that is necessary to sustain the environment, and (iii) evaluate them accordingly. These \nevaluations are important. Taken together, the changes raise some doubt about the need for the \ncapacity planned immediately for the Wangtang II WWTP. One possibility would be to keep in the \nloan sufficient funds for an additional 100,000 m3/day of treatment plant capacity, as requested by \nthe Government. However, this could be split into in 50,000 m3/day segments. Decisions could be \nmade  later  in  the  Project  on  the  needs  to  expand  Shiwuli  or  Wangtang  II  WWTPs  to  include  the \nsecond 50,000 m3/day. \n \nThe river cleanup subcomponents contain large sums for amenities. These are in line with \n16. \nthe past policy of HMG to provide extensive green areas. While the basic ideas are good, the plans \nmight be too elaborate. Thus, HMG  might wish to review  the design and early implementation of \nthese expenditures. \n \n17. \nThe only other subcomponent for which demand will be relevant is the Xinzhan Zone road \ninfrastructure.  The  city  is  expanding  and  the  location  of  the  local  railway  system  means  that  the \nXinzhan  Zone  area,  which  is  adjacent  to  the  railway  station  is  an  obvious  place  to  direct  that \ngrowth.  Roads  are  needed  to  develop  an  area.  In  view  of  recent  changes  in  national  policy,  the \nfuture  growth  of  all  PRC  cities  must  raise  some  doubts.  These  might  be  reasons  to  slow  the \nimplementation of the more northerly parts of the zone until demand in the south is verified. \n \n\n3. \n\nAssessment of Individual Subcomponents \n\n18. \nIn  addition  to  being  least-cost,  each  subcomponent  should  be  economically  justified.  The \nfirst standard for judging a subcomponent is with respect to the project goals. Any subcomponent \nthat  is  least-cost  and  is  identified  as  an  integral  component  of  the  Project  might  be  considered \njustified. All subcomponents are integral to the Project. Applying standard benefit-cost analysis can \nstrengthen the economic justification of individual subcomponents. This confirmation is useful since \nit allows the main economic parameters to be derived for the individual subcomponents.  \n \n19. \nThe types of benefits of different social service subcomponents vary. They can be difficult \nto quantify, and ensuring no double counting within and across benefits also can be difficult. These \ndifficulties  can  be  minimized  through  estimates  for  likely  land  value  increases  since  all \nsubcomponents  will  contribute  to  the  urban  development  of  Hefei.  The  total  affected  area,  101 \nsquare  kilometers,  is  17%  of  the  area  of  Hefei  urban  districts,  which  is  another  indication  of  the \nimportance of the Project. The areas affected by individual subcomponents do not overlap and the \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n\u201cwith project\u201d and \u201cwithout project\u201d land values used were backed by auction data. Benefits were \nassumed  to  grow  over  a  lengthy  delay  period.  Assumed  increases  also  were  compared  with  the \nincreases  required  to  give  an  EIRR  of  12%.  In  the  case  of  Chao  Lake,  land  value  benefits  are \nsignificant (58% of benefits) but are not sufficient. They have been supplemented by shore erosion \n(32%), amenity (7%), and net tourist income (3%) benefits.  \n \n20. \nThe  EIRRs  for  the  representative  subcomponents  range  from  21%  to  36%  for  the \nwastewater management projects, and from 13% to 33% for the other subcomponents. Overall, the \nEIRR is about 27%. The results and assumptions for subcomponents are in Table A13.2. While the \nland  value  increases  assumed  might  seem  high,  experience  elsewhere  has  shown  that  the \ndifference between the values of land liable and not liable to flooding can be a factor of four. On \naverage,  10  years  delay  in  reaching  the  estimated  increase  is  assumed.  The  average  increase \nrequired to produce an EIRR of 12% is 22%. \n \n21. \nDetails of the sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Appendix L) indicate that the results are \nrobust.  Only  the  Qingxi  landfill  and  Chao  Lake  have  EIRRs  below  12%  when  all  benefits  are \ndelayed for the full period shown. The proposed investments are considered economically sound \nand justified. \n\nSubcomponent  \n  \n\n \nTable A13.2: Economic Results by Subcomponent \nLand Value Increase \nRequired \n\nBase \nNPV \n\nBase \nEIRR \n\nBCR \n \n\nAssumed \n\nDelay \nYears \n\nSensitivity \n\nEIRR \n\nShiwuli WWTP \nWangtang II WWTP \nHefei Sewer Network \nWastewater \nQingxi Road Landfill \nErshibu River \nBanqiao River \nSili River \nChao Lake \nRiver/Lake \nXinzhan Zone \nHUEIP Project \n\n15.6% \n15.3% \n15.4% \n15.4% \n9.7% \n13.4% \n14.1% \n16.0% \n9.4% \n13.6% \n19.5% \n16.9% \nBCR  =  benefit-cost  ratio,  EIRR  =  economic  internal  rate  of  return,  HUEIP  =  Hefei  Urban  Environment  Improvement \nProject, NPV = net present value, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n27.8% \n20.9% \n35.8% \n28.7% \n12.7% \n24.9% \n32.7% \n24.5% \n13.4% \n25.1% \n27.5% \n26.7% \n\n452  \n186  \n825  \n1,463  \n7  \n614  \n840  \n306  \n26  \n1,785  \n3,441  \n6,696  \n\n66% \n49% \n41% \n48% \n66% \n60% \n66% \n50% \n103% \n59% \n136% \n75% \n\n10.0  \n5.0  \n15.0  \n12.5  \n4.7  \n9.7  \n14.5  \n4.7  \n5.0  \n10.7  \n5.0  \n9.8  \n\n14% \n23% \n4% \n9% \n50% \n16% \n8% \n20% \nna \n16% \n45% \n22% \n\n2.7 \n1.6 \n4.5 \n2.8 \n1.0 \n2.2 \n3.6 \n1.9 \n1.1 \n2.2 \n2.2 \n2.3 \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 March 2007) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "yuan (CNY) \n", "CNY1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.1292 \nCNY7.7387* \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", " \n* For the purpose of calculations in this report, an exchange rate of $1.00 = CNY7.90 has been \n", "used.
