The  FSP  II,  approved  on  6 \nDecember 2007, takes a cluster approach and consists of four back-\nis to  be \nto-back  subprograms.  Each  succeeding  subprogram \nprocessed  sequentially  upon  completion  of \nthe  preceding \nsubprogram. \n \nTargeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Finance \nSubsector: Finance sector development \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth, governance \nSubthemes:  Promoting  economic  efficiency  and  enabling  markets, \nfinancial and economic governance \n\n \nCategory C \n\n \nInvoluntary resettlement: Category C. \nImpact on indigenous people: Category C. \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  people  is \nexpected from program implementation. \n \nWith  a  rapidly  growing  commercial  economy  that  requires  a  sound \nfinancial system to sustain its rate of growth, the Government, if it is \nto  achieve  long-term  sustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction,  needs  to  develop  the  financial  sector  by  mobilizing \nfinancial resources, channeling them to productive investments, and \nmanaging  the  inherent  risks.  The  Asian  financial  crisis  provided \nmany  examples  of  the  devastating  impact  that  financial  crises  can \nhave on countries, wiping out several years of growth within a very \nshort time. Thus, to promote economic growth, reduce poverty, and \nhelp  countries  avoid  financial  crises,  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  plays  an  important  role  in  supporting  financial  sector \ndevelopment in its client countries, including Cambodia.  \n \nThe  program  loan  cluster  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  continued \nefforts \nfinancial  sector  by  supporting  a \ncombination  of  legal  and  regulatory  reforms,  targeted  capacity \nbuilding, improved disclosure standards and financial transparency, \nand establishment of key financial infrastructure. A sound, efficient, \nand integrated financial system is crucial for achieving broad-based \nsustainable  economic  growth.  It  will  help  reduce  poverty  by \nincreasing job opportunities, lowering transaction costs of economic \nactivities,  and  extending  the  outreach  of  the  formal  financial  sector \nto  poor  and  rural  areas.  An  efficient  financial  system  will  promote \nprivate  sector  development  and  foreign  direct  investment.  A  robust \n\nto  strengthen \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\nii \n \n\n \nObjective and Scope \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n \n \n\n \nProgram Period and  \nTranching \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\nthe  economy \n\nfrom  unfavorable \nfinancial  sector  will  protect \nexogenous shocks that are becoming more common in increasingly \nglobal financial markets.  \n \nFSP II aims to promote the development of a sound, market-based \nfinancial  system  to  support  resource  mobilization  and  sustainable \neconomic  growth.  With  a  growing,  resilient,  and  more  efficient \nfinancial  system  as  the  expected  outcome,  Subprogram  2  will \ncontinue the following reform activities: \n(i) \n\nImprove  financial  intermediation  by  upgrading  the  payments, \nclearance, and settlement system to support growing financial \nservices;  enhance  market  confidence  by  improving  public \nfinancial  disclosure  and  establishing  a  credit  information \nbureau;  support  market  development  by  establishing  an \ninterbank  market  and  tradable  government  securities;  and \nimproving the outreach of microfinance institutions (MFIs) in a \nsustainable manner.  \n\n(ii)  Enhance  resilience  of  the  financial  sector  by  revising  and \nupdating  the  law  on  banking  and  financial  institutions,  and  by \nintroducing  supportive  regulations \nfinancial \nactivities;  tighten  prudential  supervision  and  regulations  of \nbanks and microfinance institutions; and build on the legal and \nregulatory  foundation  by  drafting  a  new  law  on  commercial \ncontracts  that  includes  specific  sections  on  agencies  and \nfranchising. \n\nto  strengthen \n\n(iii)  Promote  good  governance  by  implementing  international \ninitiatives  on  anti-money \nthe \nfinancing of terrorism; by enhancing corporate governance and \nindustry;  by  establishing \ntransparency \ncommercial dispute resolution mechanisms; and by improving \nthe  capability  and  increasing  the  number  of  qualified  national \naccountants and auditors. \n\nlaundering  and  combating \n\ninsurance \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n(iv)  Enhance  efficiency  by  computerizing \n\nthe  management \ninformation  system  of  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC), \nas well as by upgrading the skills and capacity of microfinance \nagencies\u2019 staff.   \n\n \nA  loan  of  $10,300,000  equivalent  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s\nSpecial Funds resources for Subprogram 2. The loan will have a 24-\nyear term, including a grace period of 8 years. The interest rate will \nbe  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter.  \n \nThe implementation period for Subprogram 2 is January\u2013December \n2008. The loan will be released in a single tranche upon completion \nof specific tranche conditions and following loan effectiveness. \n \nNBC will be the Executing Agency, and the Ministry of Economy and \nFinance  (MEF)  and  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  will  be  the \nimplementing  agencies.  The  financial  sector  steering  committee, \nchaired by the governor of NBC and comprising senior officers from \n\n\fiii \n\nMEF,  MOC,  and  NBC,  will  meet  as  required  to  review  progress \nreports  from  the  technical  working  group,  consider  pending  issues, \nand  propose  concrete  actions  to  resolve  issues.  A  senior  NBC \nofficer has been appointed as program director to assist NBC, MEF, \nand  MOC  in  coordinating  day-to-day  program  implementation.  The \nprogram  director  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB  on \nprogram implementation. \n \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  All \nprocurement  of  goods  and  services  produced  in,  and  originating \nfrom, ADB member countries will be made with due consideration to \neconomy  and  efficiency, \nin  accordance  with  standard  public \nprocedures  in  Cambodia  and  normal  private  sector  commercial \npractices  acceptable  to  ADB.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans (1998), the loan proceeds will be \ndisbursed to the Kingdom of Cambodia as the Borrower.  \n \nProgram  implementation  could  face  a  number  of  risks,  for  which \nmitigation measures have been put in place, as appropriate.  \n \nChallenges to sustaining economic growth. Cambodia\u2019s \n(i) \neconomic  prospects  must  be  viewed  against  a  number  of  adverse \ndevelopments in the external environment. The immediate impact of \nthe financial crisis in the US and Europe, and the drying up there of \nliquidity  in  the  commercial  paper  and  related  money  and  interbank \nmarkets  pose  limited  if no  direct\u2014or  indirect\u2014financial sector  risks \nto  Cambodia\u2019s  economy,  either  through  balance  sheets  or  liquidity \nfactors,  as  Cambodia\u2019s  banks  do  not  have  significant  exposure  to \nborrowing  from  international  banks  and  capital  markets  do  not  as \nyet  exist.  However,  the  slowdown  in  the  global  economy  resulting \nfrom the fall in the US and European growth rates has impacted on \nCambodia\u2019s  growth  rate,  initially  through  reduced  expansion  of \nexports  following  reduced  demand  for  Cambodia\u2019s  garments.  The \nrecent unexpected surge in international energy and food prices has \nfueled  higher  domestic  inflation  in  2008  with  potential  knock-on \neffects  for  consumption  and  poverty,  growth,  and  financial  sector \nstability.  In  addition  to  foreign  direct  investment  inflows,  the  rapid \ncredit expansion is adding to growth in real estate investment and to \nrising property prices, and it is causing the assets of some banks to \nbe increasingly vulnerable to real estate risks. The Government has \nintroduced  a  combination  of  fiscal  and  monetary  measures  that \nhave  helped  to  moderate  inflation  and  slow  lending.  Throughout \nSubprogram 2, the Government and ADB have undertaken periodic \nreviews  of  macroeconomic  and  financial  developments  to  assess \npotential  risks  to  the  financial  sector.  These  reviews  will  continue \nthrough  the  program  period  for  Subprogram  3.  Budget  assistance \nthrough  a  series  of  program  loans  in  2008,  including  through  this \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nRisks and Safeguards \n\n \n\n\f \n\niv \n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance  \n\nprogram, is being provided to bolster the economy\u2019s resilience. The \nimpact on poverty of food price increases is being mitigated through \nemergency assistance approved for this purpose. \n \nUnexpected  political  disturbance.  Cambodia  has  been \n(ii) \nenjoying  very  high  political  unity  and  stability  for  several  years.  A \nnational election was conducted peacefully on 27 July 2008, as was \nthe  swearing-in  ceremony \nthe  new  Government  on  25 \nSeptember  2008.  In  anticipation  of  any  delays  in  forming  the  new \nGovernment,  Subprogram  2  was  designed  to  ensure  that  most  of \nthe  legal  drafting  that  closely  involves  midlevel  officials  would  be \ndone  prior  to  formation  of  the  Government  so  that  draft  laws  and \nsub-decrees  would  be  ready  for  submission  to  the  Council  of \nMinisters once the new Government was sworn in.  \n\nfor \n\n \n(iii) \nWeak  governance  and  corruption  in  the  sector.  Weak \ngovernance  and  incidents  of  corruption  could  erode  investor \nconfidence  and  prevent \nthe  attainment  of  expected  sector \noutcomes. The Government\u2019s National Strategic Development Plan \n2006\u20132010  views  corruption  as  a  threat  to  sustained  growth  and \ndevelopment  of  the  country  in  general.  Backed  by  an  active \ndevelopment  community,  the  Government  is  increasingly  taking  a \ntougher  stance  against  corruption.  The  general  consensus  is  that \ngood  governance  and  measures  to  address  corruption  are  needed \nfor  a  successful  partnership  between  the  Government  and  the \ndevelopment community. This was considered during design of the \nprogram  cluster,  and \nthere  will  be  continuous  pursuit  of \nimprovements  to  the  institutional  governance  structure,  accounting \ntransparency,  complementary \ndisclosure  standards, \nlegislation,  regulatory  updates  and  enforcement,  supervision,  and \nsurveillance of the financial sector.  \n\nfinancial \n\n(iv)  Weak  institutional  and  human  capacity.  Some  of  the \nfinancial  sector  risks  are  associated  with  weak  institutional  and \nhuman  capacity.  The  same  applies  to  the  implementation  and \nenforcement  of  new  laws  and  regulations.  To  mitigate  those  risks, \ntraining programs have been initiated at various training institutions \nestablished  during  FSP  I.  Subprogram  2  provides  financial  support \nto  the  institutions  to  help  update  their  curricula.  The  proposed \nadvisory  TA  will  help  reduce  the  risks  arising  from  weak  capacity, \nespecially  in  the  implementation  of  all  prudential  regulations.  With \nthese  design  safeguards,  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to far outweigh any costs.  \n\n \n\n \n\nADB will provide TA in the amount of $300,000 from its TA funding \nprogram to support NBC, MEF, and MOC in implementing some of \nthe  reform  triggers  for  Subprogram  3,  as  well  as  to  provide  the \nGovernment with timely policy advice as needed. The main activities \nof the TA will be to (i) further strengthen the on-site supervision and \nsurveillance  of  the  banking  system  (4  person-months),  (ii)  help \nstrengthen  the  off-site  and  on-site  supervision  of  MFIs  (3  person-\n\n\fv \n\nmonths), and (iii) strengthen the supervision and surveillance of the \ninsurance  industry  (4 person-months).  One  national  consultant  will \nbe  engaged,  an  insurance  expert  (6  person-months),  to  assist  the \ninternational  insurance  expert.  A  total  of  17 person-months  of \nconsulting inputs, comprising 11 international and 6 national person-\nmonths,  are  required.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  on \nan  individual  basis  to  implement  TA  activities  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time), using the competitive selection method. NBC will \nbe  the  Executing  Agency,  and  MEF  and  MOC  the  implementing \nagencies. The TA is scheduled to commence in February 2009 and \nbe completed by January 2010. \n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for Subprogram 2 of the Financial Sector Program II Cluster. The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for the Implementation of Key Policy \nTriggers of Subprogram 3, and if the Board approves the proposed subprogram loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.  \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nto  guide  and  shape  medium-term  policy  design  and \n\n \n2. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  supported  reforms  in  Cambodia\u2019s  financial \nsector  since  1999,  beginning  with  a  diagnostic  assessment  of  the  financial  sector  and \nformulation  of  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Blueprint  2001\u20132010.  The  blueprint,  updated \nas  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Strategy  (FSDS)  2006\u20132015,  was  adopted  by  the \nGovernment  in  February  2007.  FSDS  provides  the  long-term  objectives  and  development \nframework \nimplementation.  The \nGovernment has, since 2001, been able to implement important reforms in the financial sector \nwith ADB assistance under the first Financial Sector Program1 (FSP I) that concluded in August \n2007  and  with  complementary  assistance  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  poverty \nreduction  and  growth  facility  that  ended  in  2003.  Since  implementation  of  the  blueprint,  there \nhave  been  some  notable  achievements  as  well  as  lessons  learned  from  both  domestic  and \ninternational  experience.  Those  experiences,  coupled  with  the  need  to  support  continuing \ndevelopment of the financial sector to meet the  new challenges, prompted the Government to \nrequest further support from ADB to enable continuing reforms in the sector. This led to design \nand approval of the Second Financial Sector Program (FSP II) Cluster2 on 6 December 2007. \n \n3. \nFSP II comprises a series of four single-tranche subprograms, to be implemented from \nSeptember  2006  to  December  2010,  within  a  well-defined  medium-term  framework  involving \nfundamental  reforms  to  be  completed  prior  to  Board  consideration  of  each  subprogram. \nSubprograms are linked by key actions (triggers) that are deemed essential for the success of \nthe medium-term program. The overall goal of FSP II is to promote the development of a sound, \nmarket-based  financial  system  to  enhance  resource  mobilization  and  support  sustainable \neconomic growth. The expected outcome is a growing, resilient, and efficient financial system. \n(The design and monitoring framework for the program is in Appendix 1. The policy matrix and \nmedium-term program are in Appendix 2).  \n \nSubprogram 1 with 14 key reform actions was approved together with the FSP II cluster \n4. \nconcept on 6 December 2007. All 14 policy actions were completed prior to Board circulation in \nNovember  2007  and  the  loan  agreement  for  Subprogram  1  (footnote  2)  was  signed  on \n18 February 2008. The loan was declared effective on 10 April 2008, following which the total \nloan  equivalent  of  SDR6,381,000  was  disbursed  on  24  April  2008.  To  allow  for  loan \ndisbursement  in  April,  the  loan  closing  date  was  extended  from  March  to  May  2008.  ADB \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

Cambodia \nhas recorded double-digit economic growth averaging 11% over the last 4 years. Indications are \nthat the incidence of overall poverty declined from 47% in 1994 to around 35% in 2004 (refer to \nkey  country  economic  indicators  in  Table  1).  The  economy  is  expected  to  grow  at  a  more \nmodest  rate  of  6.5%  in  2008,  reflecting  an  anticipated  slowdown  in  garment  exports  and  the \ndampening  effects  on  domestic  demand  of  the  significantly  higher  inflation.  Growth  has  been \nnarrowly  based  and  concentrated  in  garments,  tourism,  and  construction,  thus  leaving  the \neconomy  vulnerable  to  external  shocks.  Reflecting  rapid  economic  growth,  domestic  liquidity \nhas  been  rising  rapidly,  from  a  small  base,  partly  fueled  by  the  surge  in  capital  inflows  from \nforeign  direct  investments  and  the  rapid  growth  of  credit  to  the  private  sector.  Inflation,  which \nhad been subdued until 2007, was sparked by supply-side shocks and surged from an annual \nrate  of  10.8%  in  December  2007  to  peak  at  25.1%  in  June  2008,  then  slipped  to  20.7%  in \nSeptember 2008. Domestic excess liquidity is being mopped up to avoid fueling an inflationary \nspiral.  \n \nBalance  of  Payments  Strengthened  but  Challenges  Remain.  While  exports \n6. \n(dominated  by  garments)  grew  by  11%  in  2007,  imports  rose  by  over  14%  (reflecting  growing \ndomestic  inflationary  pressures).  That  led  to  a  widening  of  the  trade  deficit  to  15.5%  of  gross \ndomestic product (GDP). The resulting current account deficit (excluding transfers) was lower, \nat  7.8%  of  GDP,  thanks  to  rising  tourism  receipts.  The  current  account  deficit  was  more  than \noffset  by  rising  capital  inflows  from  foreign  direct  investment  and  aid.  As  a  result  of  the  very \nsubstantial  capital  inflows,  as  reflected  in  rising  international  reserves  and  a  policy  of \nmaintaining a stable exchange rate, the overall balance of payments was in surplus and gross \ninternational  reserves  amounted  to  $1.6  billion  at  the  end  of  2007  (equivalent  to  about  3.8 \nmonths of import cover) and rose further to about $2.0 billion by mid-2008. Dampened demand \nfor  garment  exports  can  be  expected  in  2008  due  to  the  downturn  in  the  United  States,  and \ngreater competition can be expected from the People\u2019s Republic of China and Viet Nam in 2009 \nwith  the  termination  of  safeguards  imposed  by  the  United  States  on  garment  imports.  It  is \nexpected that slower growth of the garment trade will be at least partially offset by accelerating \ngrowth in tourism, facilitated by foreign direct investments in constructing new hotels and other \nservice facilities (notably at Siem Reap where the historical ruins of Angkor Wat are located and \nat Sihanoukville where the popular beaches can be easily accessed). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2007.

Given its importance to macroeconomic management, \nfiscal  policy  has  been  key  to  the  pro-growth  investment  environment  prevailing  in  Cambodia. \nThe  2007  budgetary  results  have  not  varied  substantially  from  the  past  budgetary  record,  as \nrevenue collections were on target and expenditures were contained close to budgetary levels. \nThe  budget\u2019s  current  account  balance  showed  a  healthy  surplus  while  the  overall  deficit, \nincorporating  investment  outlays,  amounted  to  about  2.8%  of  GDP,  continuing  the  trend  from \nthe last few years. Fiscal prudence appears to have been maintained in 2008, and the part of \nthe budget funded from domestic sources continued to be contractionary. Government deposits \nin  the  banking  system  continued  to  increase  through  mid-2008.  While  the  macroeconomic \nvariables of economic growth, budget, and balance of payments were still clearly robust in 2007 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n4 \n \n \nand  through  mid-2008,  the  outlook  for  2008  and  beyond  remains  a  concern  unless  inflation is \nbrought fully under control. \n\n \n\n8. \nInflation  Accelerated.  After  remaining  in  single  digits  in  recent  years,  inflation  has \naccelerated rapidly since September 2007. Published figures indicate that on an end-of-period \nbasis, annual consumer price inflation accelerated from 6.4% at end-September 2007 to 10.8% \nat  end-December  2007  and  further  to  25.1%  at  end-June  2008  before  receding  to  20.7%  in \nSeptember 2008 (Figure 1). Between February and August 2008, official inflation data was not \nreleased  pending  an  ongoing  interministerial  technical  discussion  relating  to  the  change  in \ncoverage and methodology of the consumer price index.4 In September 2008, the Government \ndecided to retain the old methodology and resumed publication of the inflation data. Despite a \ngenerally  sound  macroeconomic  framework,  Cambodia  now  faces  a  strongly  inflationary \nsituation  that  has  been  ignited  by  sharply  higher  prices  for  petroleum  and  food  and  has  been \nfurther fueled by rapid credit expansion to the private sector. Following the increase in minimum \nreserve requirements to 16% of total deposits at the end of July 2008, the banking system is still \nin a position of excess unrestricted liquidity, equivalent to almost 22% of total deposits. Though \nreal  economic  growth  has  averaged  11%  over  the  past  4  years  and  monetization  has  been \nincreasing  because  of  rising  confidence  in  the  banking  system,  excess  liquidity  has  been \ncreating demand pressures that are reflected in the accelerating inflation. \n \n \n\n  \n\n35\n\nFigure 1: End-of-Period Inflation \n \n \n\n%\n\n15\n\n30\n\n10\n\n20\n\n25\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       CAM = Cambodia, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, THA = Thailand, VIE = Viet Nam \nSource: National Bank of Cambodia, National Institute of Statistics, Staff estimates. \n\nDec-05\n\nDec-07\n\nDec-06\n\nSep-07\n\nPeriod\n\nJun-08\n\nJun-07\n\nJul-08\n\nCAM\n\nPRC\n\nTHA\n\nVIE\n\n5\n\n0\n\n \n\n \n \n9. \nGovernment\u2019s Measures to Reduce Inflation. In a bid to help absorb excess liquidity \nand  ease  inflationary  pressure,  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC)  (i) introduced  a  15% \nceiling on commercial bank credit for real estate trading, effective 26 June 2008; (ii) doubled the \n\n                                                 \n4  In January 2008, consideration was given to extending coverage of the consumer price index to four urban towns \nin addition to the capital, Phnom Penh; rebasing the index (to 2006); and reweighting based upon income surveys. \nThe weight of food in the index was to increase from 42% to 58%. Following rapid food price increases, the revised \nindex showed a higher inflation rate than did the old one. Among some other technical issues being reexamined by \nan interdepartmental technical group is the increased weight for food in the reference consumer basket.      \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nminimum  reserve  requirement  for  commercial  banks  to  16%,  effective  end-July  2008;  and  (iii) \nrelaxed capital controls by allowing commercial banks, upon verification, to invest their surplus \ndeposits abroad where they can earn higher returns.5 While the liquidity positions of a few small \nbanks have been temporarily affected, this provided the NBC and the Bankers Association with \nthe opportunity to initiate an interbank market. For its part, the Ministry of Economy and Finance \n(MEF)  has  also  announced  a  series  of  measures  that  are  designed  to  partially  offset  the \nreduction  in  the  standard  of  living  of  civil  servants  (e.g.,  increasing  the  base  wage  by  20%, \nspouse  and  child  allowances  by  100%,  and  teacher  allowances  by  10%)  and  other  affected \ngroups  (e.g.,  increasing  subsidies  to  offset  higher  fuel  and  electricity  costs),  and  to  address \nsome of the domestic food supply-related causes of inflation over the longer term (e.g., special \nfinancing  for  rice  millers  to  increase  rice  stocks  and  internal  distribution  systems  and  reduced \ntaxation on imports of agricultural machinery). With these measures in place, the Government \nreported  that  monetary  growth  had  declined  from  60%  in  December  2007  to  31.4%  in  August \n2008  and  credit  growth  had  slowed.  The  inflation  pressure  has  moderated,  and  inflation  is \nexpected to drop below 20% by December 2008. The Government will continue to monitor the \nsituation closely. \n \n10.  Macroeconomic  Stability  Crucial. Cambodia\u2019s economy is vulnerable to a number of \nadverse  developments  in  the  external  environment.  The  sharp  slowdown  in  the  US  economy \nand turbulence in its financial markets will indirectly affect growth conditions by cutting demand \nfor  garments.  Maintaining  macroeconomic  stability,  including  by  further  reducing  inflation,  is  a \nnecessary  condition  for  the  economy's  continued  expansion  and  diversification.  Equally \nimportant is to limit the adverse impact of rising prices for basic necessities from supply-related \nshocks for the vulnerable segments of society. Cambodia has reserves sufficient for more than \n3  months  of  imports,  and,  while  these  are  normally  adequate  against  external  shocks,  in  the \ncurrent  environment  of  uncertain  oil  and  food  prices,  close  monitoring  of  macroeconomic \ndevelopments  is  needed.  Beyond  the  near-term  measures  outlined  above,  complementary \nstructural reforms will be required to address Cambodia\u2019s longer-term development challenges, \nespecially  in  reducing  poverty  (particularly  in  rural  areas)  and  narrowing  urban-rural  income \ndisparities. As a financial sector contribution, NBC and  MEF are considering to accelerate the \nadoption of market-based instruments to help absorb excess liquidity whenever required and to \nbegin the development of a capital market. This is consistent with FSDS 2006\u20132015 objectives. \n \n\nIV. \n\nLINK BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND ADB STRATEGIES \n\n11. \nCambodia\u2019s  5-year  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010  was  prepared  in \nthe  context  of  a  falling,  but  still  high,  incidence  of  overall  poverty  and  a  growing  urban-rural \ndivide. The Plan aims to give effect to the Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy (adopted in 2004) \nthat  sets  out  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda  as  a  series  of  four  interlocking  strategies  with \nenhanced  governance  at  its  core.  One  of  the  four  strategies  focuses  on  the  preconditions \nrequired  to  promote  economic  growth  through  agriculture,  infrastructure,  and  private  sector \ndevelopment while enhancing employment and human resource development. \n \n12. \nADB\u2019s  overarching  goal  in  Cambodia  is  sustainable  poverty  reduction.  In  line  with  the \npriorities  and  strategies  identified  in  the  Government\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy,  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy  and  program 6  focuses  on  three  strategic  pillars:  (i)  broad-based  economic  growth \n\n                                                 \n5  Monetary policy is constrained by the high rate of dollarization in the economy and the lack of policy instruments. \n6  ADB. 2005.

The updated FSDS 2006\u2013\n2015  states  that  financial  sector  development  is  not  an  end  in  itself;  rather  it  is  one  aspect \nsupporting the development and reduction of poverty in Cambodia (Figure 2). While much work \nis  needed  to  achieve  this  difficult  goal,  accelerating  and  diversifying  growth  is  generally \naccepted  as  the  key.  Financial  sector  development  must  support  this  objective.  Reform  and \nchange are essential for growth. At the same time, expanding finance brings risks. Hence, the \ncontext  in  which  financial  development  occurs  must  be  carefully  considered  with  a  focus  on \nprudential risk reduction, transparency, and uniform application of rules and regulations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFigure 2: Overview of the Second Financial Sector Program Cluster in Relation to the FSDS 2006\u20132015 \nand Cambodia\u2019s National Economic Development Goals \n \n \nFSDS 2006\u20132015 \n \n- \nincrease competition \n \n-  maintain soundness \n- \n \n- \n \n \n \n \n \nIncreased resource mobilization, enhanced \n \nintermediation, and risk mitigation\n \n \n \nIntermediate and Markets \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nEnhance Efficiency \n-  Computerize and \nintegrate key \noperating \nfunctions of NBC \n\ngovernance and transparency \nin the insurance industry \n-  Establish commercial dispute \n\nEconomic \ngrowth with \nequitable \ndistribution and \npoverty \nreduction \n\ninitiatives on anti-money \nlaundering and combating the \nfinancing of terrorism \n\n-  Enhance legal foundation \nto support financial and \ncommercial transactions \n\nImprove confidence and \nfinancial intermediation \n-  Improve financial \n\nintegrate informal and formal sector \nincrease efficiency \n\nMaintain  stability \nfinancial sector \n-  Update legal and \n\nPromote good governance \n-  Promote international \n\nsupervision capacity \n-  Strengthen prudential \n\n-  Promote outreach in \nthe formal sector \n\nmarket and tradable \ngovernment securities \n\nservices and upgrade \nthe payments system \n\nsupervision and \nregulations of MFIs \n\ncapacity and skills \nof MFI staff \n\n-  Develop the accounting and \n\nresolution mechanism \n\nregulatory framework  \n\n-  Enhance corporate \n\n-  Develop interbank \n\n-  Strengthen bank \n\n-  Enhance market \n\nauditing profession \n\n-  Upgrade the \n\nconfidence \n\nInvestors \n\nin  the \n\nSavers \n\nFSDS = Financial Sector Development Strategy, MFI = microfinance institution, NBC = National Bank of \nCambodia. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nV. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL SECTOR \n\nSector Description and Performance  \n\n \nA. \n \nFollowing the political instability and institutional destruction of the late 1970s and early \n14. \n1980s,  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  system  has  been  undergoing  rapid  development  based  upon \nprivate  sector  participation.  At  the  end  of  June  2008,  the  formal  financial  system  comprised \nNBC, 20 private commercial banks, 5 specialized financial institutions, 2 representative offices \nof  foreign-based  banks,  16  licensed  and  26  registered  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs),  and \n6 insurance  companies.  Cambodia  also  has  the  objective  of  developing  bond  and  securities \nmarkets  within  the  medium  term.  The  predominantly  rural  nature  of  the  economy,  high \ntransaction costs, inability of the real sector to put together bankable projects, and low creditor \nconfidence  have  been  the  main  factors  resulting  in  low  formal  intermediation  and  outreach \nwithin  the  financial  sector.  There  has  also  been  a  slow  development  of  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions,  with  a  limited  range  of  products  and  services  being  offered.  A  sector  analysis  is \nprovided in Appendix 3.  \n \n15. \nThe  performance  of  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  has  been  satisfactory,  though \nchallenging (refer to key financial data in Table 2). With a relatively strong banking subsector, \nfinancial  deepening  has  accelerated  with  more  financial  services  being  promoted  through  the \nprogressive reforms implemented under FSP I. The broad money supply (M2) to GDP rose from \n12.8%  of  GDP  in  2000  (before  FSP  I)  to  30.8%  in  June  2008  (Figure  3).  Credit  to  the  private \nsector  correspondingly  rose  from  6.5%  of  GDP  in  2000  to  an  estimated  22.9%  in  June  2008. \nTotal  deposits  to  GDP  grew  from  9.2%  in  2000  to  about  25.8%  in  June  2008.  Despite  these \npositive  developments,  and  as  noted  below,  there  are  still  policy  gaps,  implementation \nchallenges, and capacity constraints needing to be addressed in each of the subsectors. \n \n \n \n\n30.8\n\n25.9\n\n)\n\n%\n\n(\n \n\nP\nD\nG\n/\n2\nM\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n13\n\n15.6\n\n16.3\n\nFigure 3: Financial Intermediation \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n18.4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYear\n \n \n \n \n\nM2/GDP (%)\n\n2006\n\n2005\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n20.5\n\n18.4\n\n       M2 = a broad money supply measure, GDP = gross domestic product. \n\n \nSource: National Bank of Cambodia.  \n\n \n   \n . \n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2007\n\nJune-08\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n8 \n \n \n\nTable 2: Key Financial Data \n \n\nIndicators \n\n  2001 \n\n    2002 \n\n    2003 \n\n    2004 \n\n   2005 \n\n  2006 \n\n   2007 \n\n June    \n2008 \n\n         26.0 \n\n         22.9 \n\n         30.8 \n         25.0 \n\n          2.7 \n\n          1.6 \n\n       10.8 \n\n        25.8 \n\n164,931.0  197,337.0  209,053.0 \n\n80.8 \n\n62.7 \n\n12.5 \n\n10.4 \n\n  8.1 \n\n  0.6 \n\n  58.5 \n\n    6.0 \n\nreturn \n\nsector \n\n   70.3 \n\n   14.0 \n\n     1.1 \n\n    14.6 \n\n     68.6 \n\n     13.3 \n\n     12.7 \n\n     49.3 \n\n       6.3 \n\n       0.9 \n\n      13.1 \n\n      12.7 \n\n       14.6 \n\n68,167.0 \n\n86,757.0 \n\n       66.6 \n\n       63.3 \n\n         9.8 \n\n         7.3 \n\n         9.6 \n\n         3.4 \n\n         7.2 \n\n         1.8 \n\n         1.2 \n\n         2.8 \n\n         2.8 \n\n       11.1 \n\n       15.3 \n\n       11.8 \n\n       12.2 \n\n       15.1 \n\n       40.6 \n\n        26.6 \n\n        17.9 \n\n        34.5 \n\n        26.0 \n\n        32.0 \n\n        12.2 \n\n        18.3 \n\n          9.3 \n\n          8.5 \n\n123,937.0 \n\n145,161.0 \n\n105,347.0 \n\n         24.0 \n\n  13.0 \n  33.0 \n\n     15.6 \n     32.0 \n\n       16.3 \n       17.0 \n\n        25.9 \n        24.0 \n\n        20.5 \n        20.0 \n\n        18.4 \n        18.0 \n\n        18.4 \n        17.0 \n\nM2/GDP (%) \nNumber \nof \nregistered banks \nAverage \nCAR \n(%) \nPrivate \ncredit/GDP (%) \nNumber  of  loan \naccounts \nTotal \ndeposits/GDP \n(%) \nNPLs/total  loans \n(%) \nAverage \non assets (%) \nAverage  interest \nspread (%) \nTotal  assets  of \nlargest \nfive \nbanks/total \nassets (%)        \nTotal  deposits \nlargest \nof  five \ntotal \n/ \nbanks \ndeposits (%) \nNumber \nlicensed and   \nregistered MFIs \nTotal  number  of \nMFI  borrowers  \n(\u2018000) \nTotal  amount  of \nMFI \n($ \nloans \nmillion) \nTotal  amount  of \nMFI deposits  ($ \nmillion) \nTotal  number  of \nMFI depositors  \nNumber \nof \ninsurance firms \nTotal  insurance \npremium               \n($ million) \nCAR  =  capital  adequacy  ratio,  GDP  =  gross  domestic  product,  M2  =  a  broad  money  supply  measure,  MFI  = \nmicrofinance institution, NPL = nonperforming loan. \nSources: National Bank of Cambodia and Ministry of Economy and Finance. \n\n         17.5 \n\n       160.1 \n\n       624.1 \n\n           5.0 \n\n           6.1 \n\n         42.0 \n\n         73.0 \n\n137,624.0 \n\n107,150.0 \n\n158,627.0 \n\n122,984.0 \n\n       368.0 \n\n        10.8 \n\n      322.0 \n\n      471.0 \n\n       39.0 \n\n       66.3 \n\n       40.0 \n\n       70.0 \n\n       71.0 \n\n     265.0 \n\n     410.0 \n\n88,474.0 \n\n       49.2 \n\n        1.9 \n\n        2.9 \n\n        3.0 \n\n      78.3 \n\n      70.0 \n\n      92.2 \n\n       3.0 \n\n       2.0 \n\n     13.0 \n\n     38.0 \n\n     40.9 \n\n     80.9 \n\n    10.1 \n\n    34.0 \n\n      4.0 \n\n      3.0 \n\n    32.6 \n\n      8.8 \n\n     2.5 \n\n     7.1 \n\n     1.0 \n\n   30.0 \n\n   83.6 \n\n   51.3 \n\n     5.5 \n\n 328.0 \n\n  3.8 \n\n  1.0 \n\n  3.6 \n\n  0.0 \n\n35.9 \n\nof \n\n    5.0 \n\n    8.7 \n\n     6.4 \n\n  221.3 \n\n   689.2 \n\n     42.0 \n\n      61.6 \n\n113,277.0  147,966.0  154,599.0 \n\n       69.1 \n\n  \n \n16. \nBanking.  At  the  end  of  June  2008  there  were  20  private  commercial  banks, \n5 specialized  banks  (including  1  state-owned  bank,  the  Rural  Development  Bank),  and \n2 representative  offices  of  foreign-based  banks  in  Cambodia.  All  registered  banks  are \nadequately  capitalized  (Figures  4  and  5)  following  the  relicensing  process  that  set  the  capital \nrequirement  at  $13  million  equivalent  (2002)  and  the  initial  minimum  capital  adequacy  ratio  at \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n20%, which was then appropriately reduced to 15% in 2004. While banks are free to set their \nown  interest  rates  (since  1995),  the  average  annual  interest  rate  spread  tends  to  be  high \n(around  11%  in  2007,  down  from  15.3%  in  2004)  and  most  banks  continue  to  maintain  high \nliquidity.  The  number  of  active  borrowers  reached  exceeded  209,000  (1.5%  of  the  total \npopulation)  at  the  end  of  June  2008,  with  potential  for  growth.  Further  work  is  required  to \naddress key governance structures of these banks, upgrade staff skills, encourage competition, \nincrease the minimum capital requirement, and enhance their understanding of and compliance \nwith  new  statutory  requirements  (e.g.,  regular  provision  of  prudential  reports,  requirements  for \nanti-money  laundering  and  combating  the  financing  of  terrorism,  a  credit  information  sharing \nsystem,  online  filing  registry  for  movable  collaterals,  new  Cambodian  Accounting  Standards, \npublication of audited financial statements). While some progress has been made in the banking \nsupervision  area,  further  work  is  required  to  upgrade  prudential  requirements  to  international \nstandards and best practices, upgrade the skills of NBC staff, and enhance proper surveillance \n(including the complementary role of external auditors) and uniform enforcement of regulations \nto maintain the safety of public deposits and the integrity of the banking system. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFigure 4: Confidence in the Banking System \n\n25\n\n30\n\n20\n\n25\n\n35\n\n30\n\n \n\n.\n\no\nN\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nYear\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\nJune-08\n\nNo. of Registered Banks\n\nPrivate Sector Credit/GDP (%)\n\nTotal Deposits\n\n \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: National Bank of Cambodia.  \n\n15\n\n%\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n0\n\n%\n\n40\n\n10\n\n70\n\n30\n\n20\n\n60\n\n50\n\n2004\n\n2001\n\n2005\n\n2003\n\n2002\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\nYear\n\nJune-08\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAverage CAR (%)\n\nFigure 5: Soundness of the Banking System \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCAR = capital adequacy ratio, NPL = nonperforming loan. \nNote: Minimum CAR is 15%. \nSource: National Bank of Cambodia. \n\n10 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n17.  Microfinance.  Microfinance  has come a long way since licensing commenced in 2002, \nas  there  were  new  16  licensed  MFIs  and  26  registered  nongovernment-operated  MFIs  at  the \nend  of  August  2008.  The  microfinance  industry  is  expanding  rapidly,  providing  a  link  from  the \nformal  financial  sector  to  rural  households  and  microenterprises  (Figure  6).  The  number  of \nactive borrowers availing themselves of rural household credits, microbusiness loans, and small \nbusiness loans exceeded 689,000 clients (4.9% of the total population) at the end of June 2008, \nwith  potential  for  further  growth.  Microfinance  lending  also  grew  from  $92.2 million  in  2006  to \n$221.3  million  in  June  2008,  with  reported  nonperforming  loans  below  3%.  Voluntary  savings \nremain  very  small,  and  access  to  local  finance  by  MFIs  has  been  very  limited.  With  technical \nassistance7 from ADB, NBC issued a prakas8 in December 2007 setting out the criteria for MFIs \nthat are eligible to mobilize voluntary savings. A public campaign to promote MFI savings has \ncommenced.  The  NBC  supervision  unit  for  MFIs  regulates  the  operation  of  MFIs  and  further \nsupport will be required to enhance its off-site and on-site supervision capabilities.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nNPLs/Total Loans (%)\n\n                                                 \n7  ADB.  2005.

There  are  six  operating  insurance  firms  (one  state-owned),  including  one \nlocally registered reinsurer (80% state-owned). Shares in both state-owned firms are held by the \nMEF, which is also the regulator of insurance activities. Divesting government shares continues \nto be an important reform agenda item so as to allow the MEF to perform its regulatory functions \nequitably.  Negotiation  to  sell  75%  of  state-owned  Caminco\u2019s  shares  to  a  joint  venture \ncomprising an insurance firm from Thailand and a Cambodian investor is in its final stage. The \ninsurance industry is very small, with a total premium income of $17.5 million in 2007 (Figure 7). \nGrowing  the  industry  would  require  a  more  comprehensive  legal  and  regulatory  framework \n(comparable  to  those  used  in  neighboring  countries),  accompanied  by  specifically  tailored \ntraining and incentives. A risk-based capital framework is needed following amendments to the \nexisting  insurance  law  that  MEF  initiated.  Some  of  the  international  standards  have  been \nadopted. Further work is required to upgrade the remaining insurance prudential regulations to \ninternational  standards,  including  for  insurance  companies  to  adopt  an  appropriate  reporting \nstandard,  to  upgrade  staff  skills,  to  encourage  competition  on  a  level  playing  field,  and  to \nstrengthen surveillance and ensure that regulations are fully enforced. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n12 \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7: Growing Insurance Industry \n \n\n6\n\n5\n\n.\n\n1\n\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n\no\nN\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: Ministry of Economy and Finance. \n\n0\n\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\nYear\n\nNo. of insurance firms\nTotal insurance premium ($ million)             \n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nm\n \n$\n\ntransactions,  commercial  arbitration,  secured \n\n \n \n19. \nLegal  and  Supporting  Infrastructure.  Key  pieces  of  legislation  have  been  adopted \nsince  2001.  Those  include  laws  on  insurance,  accounting,  commercial  enterprises,  negotiable \ntransactions, \ninstruments  and  payment \ngovernment  and  nongovernment  securities,  insolvency,  as  well  as  anti-money  laundering  and \ncombating  the  financing  of  terrorism.  Most  of  the  enacted  laws  have  been  implemented,  and \ntraining curricula have been introduced at selected legal faculties to train legal practitioners and \njudges  on  these  new  principles.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  support  under \nSubprogram  2  to  revise  and  update  the  banking  and  financial  institutions  law,  prepare \nimplementing sub-decrees for the commercial arbitration law and secured transactions law, and \ncomplete the drafting of a new law on commercial contracts.  \n \n20. \nAccounting  Development.  Key accounting and auditing initiatives implemented so far \ninclude (i) adoption of a law on corporate accounts, their audit, and the accounting profession; \n(ii) establishment of a national accounting council to set and interpret standards; (iii) introduction \nof requirements that international accounting standards and international standards on auditing \nbe applied to all companies incorporated in Cambodia; and (iv) establishment of an association \nof accountants and auditors (Kampuchea Institute of Certified Public Accountants and Auditors), \nits bylaws, a code of ethics that complies with the requirements of the International Federation \nof Accountants, and committees on education and ethics within the association. In 2005, only 10 \nlocally  qualified  accountants  were  working  in  the  system.  To  improve  accounting  and  auditing \ncapacity,  the  Government  has  been  funding  a  scholarship  scheme  to  assist  at  least  70 \ncandidates  annually  to  meet  the  required  certified  public  accountant  (CPA)  accreditation. \nSubprogram 2 will continue to support this scholarship scheme. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nEmerging Challenges and Opportunities  \n\nB. \n \n21. \nUnderdeveloped  Commercial  and  Institutional  Framework.  As  in  other  developing \neconomies,  the  fundamental  weaknesses  that  stifle  financial  sector  development  in  Cambodia \nstem  mainly  from  its  underdeveloped  commercial  and  institutional  framework,  low  formalized \nenterprise development, and limited human capacity and technical expertise. The court system \nlacks the judicial capacity to enforce contracts and resolve commercial disputes on a timely and \nconsistent basis. This affects public and investor confidence in the sector. Enterprises that have \nenjoyed  many  years  of  operating  without  an  established  rule  of  law  prefer  to  remain  informal. \nThe  majority  of  participants  in  the  real  sector  are  reluctant  to  enter  into  any  form  of  formal \nfinancial  transactions  for  fear  of  being  exposed  to  the  tax  authorities.  To  help  mitigate  these \nissues, there are efforts to get the National Assembly to adopt the remaining commercial laws, \nhave  the  Government  establish  a  commercial  court  with  supporting  dispute  resolution \nmechanisms, and enhance institutional and technical capacity.  \n\n \n\n22. \nEmerging  Risks  and  Anticorruption  Initiatives.  Previous  decades  of  conflict  and \nisolation have resulted in weak governance and perceived high corruption. The transition from a \ncentrally controlled to a market-led economy and the speedy implementation of changes creates \nnew forms of risk and accompanying opportunities for corruption. The presence of international \nbanks,  the  offer  of  more  sophisticated  services  to  depositors,  and  the  increase  in  lending \ndemonstrate  investors\u2019  increasing  confidence  in  Cambodia's  financial  system.  Nevertheless, \nawareness of potential problems must be heightened within both the public and financial sectors \nand new ways pursued of mitigating risks.  \n \nRapid Expansion of Bank Lending. Starting from a relatively small base, credit to the \n23. \nprivate sector has been expanding very rapidly, from an already high year-on-year rate of 46% \nat  end-June  2007  to  76%  at  end-December  2007,  and  further  to  102%  by  end-June  2008 \n(Figure  8).  Total  liquidity  has  also  been  fueled  by  increased  capital  inflows,  resulting  in  the \nincrease  of  net  official  international  reserves  from  $1.4  billion  at  end-September  2007  to  $1.6 \nbillion at end-December 2007, and further to $2.0 billion toward end-June 2008. Broad money \ngrew at an annual rate of 60% to December 2007, then dropped to 31.4% in August 2008. The \nbanking system is still in a position of excess unrestricted liquidity, equivalent to almost 22% of \ntotal deposits after July 2008. With real economic growth in the neighborhood of 8%, this excess \nliquidity  has  been  creating  demand  pressures  reflected  in  the  acceleration  of  inflation.  Along \nwith foreign direct investment inflows, rapid credit expansion is adding to growth in real estate \nand  construction  investment  that  has  been  fueled  by  rising  property  prices.  Credit,  which  is \nconcentrated  in  a  few  banks,  is  almost  entirely  collateralized  against  the  booming  real  estate \nmarket.  Some  banks\u2019  assets  are  increasingly  vulnerable  to  real  estate  risks.  NBC  has  issued \nguidelines  to  help  improve  banks\u2019  classification  and  reporting  of  exposure  to  housing, \nconstruction, and real estate loans. It also introduced a 15% ceiling on commercial bank credit \nto  real  estate  trading  with  effect  from  June  2008.  While  reported  system-wide  nonperforming \nloans remain below 5%, there are concerns about the quality of asset classification. The rapid \ncredit expansion reinforces the critical importance of strong banking supervision and enforcing \ncompliance with prudential regulations while giving priority to assessing asset quality. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\nFigure 8: Credit to the Private Sector \n \n \n\n120\n\n90\n\nKR trillion \n\n6\n\n3\n\n% \n\n60\n\n \n \n \nTrillion riel\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: National Bank of Cambodia, National Institute of Statistics, Staff Estimates. \n\n2003           2004           2005            2006           2007     June-2008 \n2003\n2007 Mar-2008\n\nGrowth\n\nYear\n\nLevel\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n30\n\n0\n\n0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n24. \nBank  Supervision  and  Vulnerability  to  Shocks.  Regulatory  standards  have  been \ngradually  improved  and  relevant  prudential  regulations  added  to  maintain  NBC\u2019s  primary \nobjective of enhancing the banking system\u2019s soundness. Moreover, NBC\u2019s capacity for off-site \nsupervision of banks has been upgraded and strengthened. All banks adopted a uniform chart \nof accounts in 2004 and commenced publishing their annual audited financial reports in 2005. \nAt  the  end  of  2006,  NBC\u2019s  Bank  Supervision  Department  published  its  second  annual  report \nproviding  a  very  detailed  and  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  banking  system.  NBC  has \nasked external auditors of each bank to undertake a comprehensive review of loan portfolios to \nJune  2008  and  provide  their  opinions  on  the  quality  of  those  portfolios  and  the  application  of \nprudential regulations by end-September 2008. In an effort to further strengthen and consolidate \nthe banking system, NBC issued a directive in September 2008 requiring commercial banks that \nare owned by nonbank entities or individuals to increase their minimum capital to the equivalent \nof  $36.5  million  by  2010.  These  developments  are  evidence  that  NBC  is  serious  about  bank \nsoundness and has made significant progress to promote market transparency and establish a \nsound  regulatory  and  efficient  supervisory  regime  to  enhance  the  banking  system\u2019s  integrity. \nAlthough enforcement of prudential regulations is improving, compliance with those regulations \nremains uneven. NBC aims, however, to enforce full compliance during FSP II implementation.  \n \nC. \n\nLessons \n\nKey lessons from FSP I, Subprogram 1 of FSP II, and the associated TA projects to the \n\n25. \nsector include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\nLong-term perspective. Adoption of the medium-term blueprint for the financial \nsector meant that the Government had a set of long-term objectives to guide and \nthe \nshape  medium-term  policy  design  and \n\nimplementation.  Changes \n\nin \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nunderlying  policy  environment  necessitated  an  update  of  the  blueprint,  and  in \nFebruary  2007  the  updated  blueprint,  known  as  the  FSDS  for  2006\u20132015,  was \nadopted.  The  close  consultative  process  involving  the  Government,  ADB,  and \nother  development  partners  strengthened  the  Government\u2019s  ownership  and \nincreased the potential for funding agency buy-in.  \n\nto  program \n\nimplementation.  Design \n\nFlexibility  in  design.  Financial  sector  reforms  are  complex  and  involve  major \nchanges  to  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  institutional  arrangements, \nfinancial  infrastructure,  and  human  capacity.  Hence,  sufficient  time  must  be \nallocated \nis  also  a  key \nconsideration. The use of the program cluster approach under FSP I provided the \nopportunity to refine the proposed policy actions for succeeding subprograms to \nreflect the Government\u2019s achievements, changes in the policy environment, and \nlessons  from  the  previous  subprograms.  FSP  II  has  also  adopted  the  cluster \napproach,  with  each  of  the  four  subprograms  to  be  processed  annually.  This \nprovides  the  flexibility  to  address  new  macroeconomic  developments  and \nemerging risks to the financial sector.  \n\nflexibility \n\nTA  resources.  Under  FSP  I,  the  Government  adopted  legal,  policy,  and \ninstitutional measures, many of which were relatively new concepts and therefore \nrequired  extensive  coordination  and  consultation  to  ascertain  stakeholders\u2019 \nunderstanding, acceptance, and likely adoption of the new measures. Substantial \nTA  support  was  necessary  to  ensure  that  best practices  were  incorporated  and \nthen  consolidated  throughout  implementation  to  achieve  the  intended  results. \nFSP II has also identified a set of TA projects to help implement the medium-term \nprogram. Individual consultants have been selected not only on merit but also on \ntheir  perceived  ability  to  work  well  with  local  counterpart  staff  and  sensitivity  to \nthe local culture. These criteria are considered essential for successful transfer of \nknowledge. \n\nNational  and  commune  council  elections.  Implementation  of  subprograms  2 \nand  3  of  FSP  I  was  delayed  by  elections.  The commune  and  national elections \naffected  the  passage  of  the  draft  laws  through  the  Council  of  Ministers  and \nNational  Assembly  and  subsequently  affected  the  achievement  of  targets  in \nrelation  to  those  laws. This  is  a  lesson  for  FSP  II  Subprogram  2  design,  as  the \nnext national general election was held on 27 July 2008. \n\nEmerging  risks.  The  transition  from  a  centrally  controlled  to  a  market-led \neconomy  creates  new  forms  of  risk.  The  presence  of  international  banks,  the \noffer  of  more  sophisticated  services  to  depositors  (credit  and  debit  cards  for \nautomatic  teller  machines  and  electronic  funds  transfer  systems),  and  the \nincrease  in  lending  demonstrate  increasing  investor  confidence  in  Cambodia's \nfinancial  system.  With  these  encouraging  developments,  however,  come  new \nrisks and challenges\u2014such as lack of discipline over the use of credit cards, lax \napplication  of  credit  underwriting  and  portfolio  management  policies,  and \ninappropriate safety nets for users of electronic cards. Strengthening awareness \nof  potential  risks  within  both  the  public  and  the  financial  sectors  is  therefore \nimportant. Similarly, new ways for mitigating risks must be pursued.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n16 \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUBPROGRAM \n\nthe  FSP \n\nin  January  2008.  All  have  been  completed  prior \n\nLinks  between  Subprograms.  Following  approval  of \n\n \n26. \nII  cluster  and \nSubprogram 1 in December 2007, the momentum of implementing the policy reforms within the \nFSP  II  medium-term  framework  has  been  maintained.  As  a  continuation  of  reforms  initiated \nunder  Subprogram  1,  Subprogram  2  has  14  key  reform  actions  that  the  Government  began \nimplementing \nto  Board  circulation. \nDisbursement will follow loan effectiveness. Subprogram 3 has been designed with 11 triggers \nand 11 milestones to continue the policy reforms initiated under subprograms 1 and 2 within the \nfour broad objectives of the medium-term framework that are intended to (i) improve confidence \nand financial intermediation, (ii) maintain financial stability, (iii) promote good governance, and \n(iv) enhance efficiency of the financial sector. Implementation of Subprogram 3 will commence \nin January 2009 and will be processed for Board approval and disbursement in December 2009. \nReform measures may be added to subprograms 3 and 4 as necessary within the medium-term \nframework  after  duly  considering  the  Government\u2019s  social  and  economic  achievements  and \nchanges in the macro policy environment.   \n \n27. \nRefined  Policy  Framework.  With recent developments in Cambodia\u2019s macroeconomic \nand  financial  sectors,  and  through  extensive  consultation  between  ADB  and  the  Government, \nnew policy triggers and milestone were added. To address the rising level of inflation, NBC has \ndoubled the minimum reserve requirement imposed on banks from the current 8% to 16% with \neffect  from  July  2008  in  a  bid  to  absorb  some  of  the  excess  liquidity.  NBC  has  also  relaxed \nsome restrictions on capital outflows, by allowing, upon verification, commercial banks to invest \na proportion of their surplus funds abroad where they can earn higher rates of return. Both have \nbeen added to the policy triggers for Subprogram 2. While the liquidity position of a few small \nbanks  may  be  temporarily  affected  by  the  increase  in  reserve  requirement,  NBC  has \nencouraged  the  Bankers  Association  to  initiate  an  interbank  market.  The  NBC  indicated  that \nfurther  measures  would  be  considered  if  doubling  the  reserve  requirement  together  with  the \nrelaxation of capital outflows was not sufficient to achieve the objective of moderating inflation.  \n \nA. \n\nProgress in the Implementation of Policy Actions under Subprograms 1 and 2 \n\n1. \n\nImprove Confidence and Financial Intermediation \n\na. \n\n1.1: Improve Financial Services and the Payments, Clearance, and     \nSettlement System \n\n28. \nA payment, clearance, and settlement system is necessary to achieve modern payment \nsystems and service outreach; for development of money and interbank markets; and to support \nmacroeconomic  policy  implementation.  The  vast  majority  of  transactions  in  Cambodia  are \nconducted  in  cash  rather  than  by  check,  and  cash  transactions  are  reckoned  to  be  mainly  in \ndollars. Checks, mainly used by companies and a few individuals who maintain bank accounts, \nare  manually  cleared  and  settled  through  clearinghouses  operated  by  NBC  (in  Phnom  Penh, \nSiem  Reap,  and  Sihanoukville,  with  no  electronic  link  between  them).  Checks  are  presented \neach  morning  at  9:30,  and  dishonored  checks  flow  back  through  the  system  at  3:00  p.m. \nSettlement from clearing operations is recorded in the NBC books at each branch office. In view \nof  this  current  manual  system,  NBC  places  high  priority  on  upgrading  the  payment  and \nsettlement  system  because  it  will  help  build  confidence,  enhance  growth  in  financial \nintermediation and outreach, and encourage product and service innovation. Further, the rapidly \ngrowing  economy  is  straining  the  current  manual  system;  an  upgraded  system  is  required  to \nsupport  the  larger,  more  complex  financial  transactions  in  the  economy;  and  moving  from  the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\ncash-based  to  a  check-based  treasury  accounts  system  would  enhance  public  financial \nmanagement capacities throughout government.  \n \n29. \nIn  2005,  Cambodia  enacted  the  Law  on  Negotiable  Instruments  and  Payment \nTransactions,  which  provides  a  legal  basis  for  negotiable  instruments  such  as  checks,  bills  of \nexchange,  and  promissory  notes,  plus  regulation  of  payment  systems.  The  process  for \nmodernizing  the  national  payments,  clearance,  and  settlement  system  started  in  2006  when \nNBC  established  the  Payments  Policy  Unit  (PPU).  With  technical  support  from  ADB,  NBC \ndeveloped a road map for modernizing the payments, clearance, and settlement system. Staff \nof  the  PPU  consulted  with  banks  to  obtain  their  input  on  the  unit\u2019s  initiatives  and  to  garner \nsupport  for  implementing  the  proposed  road  map.  Under  Subprogram  1,  NBC  signed  a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  with  each  commercial  bank  endorsing  the  road  map  to \nmodernize the national payment, clearance, and settlement system. \n \n30. \nNBC  continues  to  implement  key  actions  of  phase  I  of  the  road  map  to  modernize  the \npayment,  clearance,  and  settlement  system  under  Subprogram  2.  With  a  long-term  payment \nexpert  funded  by  ADB,  the  PPU  commenced  discussions  with  banks  on  standardization  of \nchecks,  on  an  interbank  switch  to  handle  retail  electronic  payments,  and  to  identify  practical \nsolutions  to  enhance  funds  transfer  and  faster  bank  settlement.  A  prakas  on  check \nstandardization was issued by NBC in September 2008 after it was reviewed by all banks. An \ninterbank switch was launched on 28 August 2008 between four banks. The shared visa switch \nis  a  positive  beginning  and  may  develop  into  a  more  inclusive  and  beneficial  system  in  the \nfuture. To enhance funds transfer and early settlement, the PPU has been evaluating a credit \nremittance  payment  instrument  designed  with  suitable  flexibility  to  be  used  as  a  direct  funds \ntransfer  instrument;  as  a  direct  credit;  and  as  a  direct  debit  instrument  for  government  salary \npayment, utility payments, and settlement between banks. Since Cambodia presently operates \non  a  decentralized  basis,  with  every  bank  maintaining  both  riel  and  US  dollar  settlement \naccounts  at  each  provincial  NBC,  this  interim  solution  is  considered  pragmatic.  The  external \nadvice  regarding  the  importance  of  a  real-time  gross  settlement  (RTGS)  has  not  received \nparallel practical consideration because a core requirement of any RTGS is that bank settlement \naccounts are centralized so that the central RTGS has a total view, and total management, of \nthe  respective  commercial  bank\u2019s  credit  and  liquidity  exposure  on  a  real-time  basis. \nCentralization of commercial bank settlement accounts has not been considered by NBC, and it \ncannot  be  reasonably  implemented  until  the  new  core  banking  system  is  implemented  and \nrolled out to all branches sometime near the end of 2010. \n \n\nb. \n\n1.2: Enhance Consumer Access to Credit and Market Confidence \n\n31. \nTo improve the quality of credit underwriting and portfolio management, and to boost the \nconfidence  in  the  banking  system,  a  credible  credit  information  system  and  supporting \nregulations are needed. With close cooperation between NBC and the Bankers Association, a \npilot online credit information sharing system (CIS) was established in August 2006 to support \nthe  credit  appraisal  processes  of  participating  banks.  Rules,  regulations,  procedures,  and  a \ngoverning  structure  are  in  place,  but  implementation  has  not  met  expectations.  Participating \nbanks have reported that since introduction of the CIS they have had  difficulty uploading data \nand  also  accessing  the  information  online.  A  number  of  actions  have  been  taken  under  the \nSmall-and Medium Enterprise Development Program9 to improve the software system and build \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB.  2004.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Development \nProgram. Manila (Loan 2129-CAM). \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n18 \n \n \nsteering committee capacity to work with the system. Several additions have been made to the \nsystem  to  allow  \u201cno  cases  to  report\u201d  as  a  quick  option  for  participating  banks,  which  can  then \ntrigger  a  more  focused  follow-up  by  the  CIS  steering  committee.  Subprogram  1  helped \nfamiliarize stakeholders with the system while addressing important changes to the system and \nto the governing structure of the CIS to enhance its effectiveness. The NBC will continue to help \neliminate  the  systematic  issues  while  strengthening  bank  compliance  and  ensuring  the \nusefulness of the system.  \n \nThe orderly development and expansion of the financial market requires knowledgeable \n32. \ncustomers as well as financially sound providers of financial services. It requires customers to \nbe  able  to  make  informed  decisions  on  the  services  they  need  and  what  financial  institutions \nthey should be requesting to undertake their financial transactions. Since 2005, all banks have \nbeen required to publish their audited financial statements to allow the general public to make \ninformed judgments regarding where to place their deposits and with which banks to transact. \nSeveral  banks  have  published  these  annual  audited  financial  reports  on  their  own  websites. \nFollowing recent high credit growth in the banking system, NBC had requested all bank auditors \nto undertake a comprehensive portfolio review as of end-December 2007. These audit reports \nwere completed by the end of June 2008. Subprogram 2 supported NBC in its efforts to promote \nbank  transparency  by  requiring  all  audited  financial  statements  of  banks  as  well  as  new \nprudential regulations to be published on the NBC website.  \n \n\nc. \n\n1.3: Develop Interbank Market and Tradable Government Securities \n\n33. \nThe Law on Government Securities, enacted in January 2007, provides a framework for \nthe efficient issuance and management of government securities. This market will in turn ensure \nthat the Government\u2019s financing needs and payment obligations are met at the lowest possible \ncost, and it will provide key information to financial sector participants through the development \nof  a  yield  curve.  NBC  has  been  assigned  the  role  of  maintaining  the  registry  function  for  the \nissuance of government securities. NBC has established the registry and trained the staff on its \noperation and procedures under Subprogram 2.  \n \n\nd. \n\n1.4: Promote Outreach in the Formal Sector  \n\n34. \nBanking  activities  in  rural  areas,  although  not  fully  developed,  are  improving  with  MFIs \nproviding most of the formal financial services. The formal microfinance industry has undergone \na transition from the development model to a fully commercial model, although some funding is \nstill channeled from aid organizations and their affiliates. Nevertheless, by some estimates, the \ninformal sector still has a greater share by value and number of transactions undertaken within \nthe  economy  (especially  among  the  poor  and  remote  rural  population)  than  the  formal  sector, \nwhich  comprises  registered  banks  and  both  licensed  and  registered  MFIs.  At  present,  no \nreliable  data  is  available  on  the  actual  size  and  scale  of  the  informal  financial  sector.  An \nunderstanding of the size and depth of the informal sector outside of the formal financial sector \nneeds  to  be  established  to  help  determine  the  required  policies,  both  macro  and  micro,  and \namount  of  assistance  needed  to  develop  this  sector.  A  survey  would  be  useful  to  gather \ninformation on nonlicensed MFIs and moneylenders outside the formal sector and their impact \non  the  economy.  It  would  include  data  on  size,  scale,  and scope  while  covering  products  and \nservices offered, transaction costs, and locations serviced. NBC (for licensing and supervision \npurposes)  and  MEF  (policy  formulation)  have  agreed  to  jointly  undertake  this  survey  under \nSubprogram 2. Two months\u2019 technical support has been provided to assist both agencies. The \nreport of the survey was discussed at a series of workshops in September 2008. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nMaintain Stability in the Financial Sector \n\na. \n\n2.1: Update the Legal and Regulatory Framework for Banks \n\nAs  part  of  Cambodia\u2019s  efforts  to  strengthen  prudential  supervision,  update  regulations, \n35. \nand ensure stability, NBC has issued regulations (i) on large exposures of banks and financial \ninstitutions,  and  (ii)  to  amend  the  prakas  on  licensing  of  commercial  and  specialized  banks \nunder  Subprogram  1.  Further,  because  the  Law  on  Banking  and  Financial  Institutions  was \nenacted  in  1999,  a  comprehensive  review  of  this  law  is  needed  to  effectively  address  the \nfeatures  of  a  changing  domestic  market  and  the  reality  of  increasing  international  economic \nintegration. The review, with technical assistance from ADB under Subprogram 2, will take into \nconsideration  consumer  protection  in  connection  with  the  use  of  debit  and  credit  cards,  bank \nsecrecy provisions to support development of the CIS, procedures for administering distressed \nand insolvent banks, and protection or immunity of bank regulators. Based upon the findings of \nthis  review,  a  revised  and  updated  law  is  to  be  submitted  to  the  Council  of  Ministers  and  the \nNational Assembly during FSP II.  \n \n\nb. \n\n2.2: Strengthen Bank Supervision Capacity and Adopt Measures to \nSustain Financial Stability \n\nUpdating  and  upgrading  skills  is  a  priority  area  that  must  be  an  ongoing  feature  of \n36. \ndevelopment  and  the  deepening  of  the  financial  system.  New  risks  will  emerge  requiring  that \nskills  development  and  training  be  pursued  in  tandem  with  these  developments.  NBC  will \ncontinue  to  strengthen  and  upgrade  the  capacity  of  its  own  supervision  staff  to  be  able  to \neffectively  manage  these  developments.  At  the  same  time,  NBC  recognizes  that  the  financial \nsector  is  still  in  an  early  stage  of  development  and  thus  will  strengthen  its  surveillance \nmechanisms.  The  IMF  has  been  providing  a  resident  adviser  to  help  develop  the  off-site \ncapability of the bank supervision staff and will continue to provide support to 2010. With TA for \n$1.7 million approved together with Subprogram 1, ADB has been providing technical support to \nhelp  NBC  undertake  regular  on-site  examinations  of  banks.  During  Subprogram  2,  NBC \nevaluated the progress on capacity building support to bank supervision and again emphasized \nthe need for ADB support for bank on-site supervision. This is very important in view of the rapid \nincrease in the number and size of loans and concern with the quality of information reported by \nthese  banks.  ADB  is  proposing  TA  together  with  Subprogram  2  to  ensure  that  this  very \nimportant area of NBC\u2019s work is further strengthened. \n \nNBC  has  formulated  remedial  measures,  broadly  anchored  on  the  policy  matrix  and \n37. \nprogram policy framework, covering stronger sanctions to address potential vulnerabilities in the \nbanking  system.  NBC  will  closely  monitor  progress  with  implementation  of  the  remedial \nmeasures,  and  ADB  will  regularly  review  progress  reports.  Under  Subprogram  1,  NBC  has \nfor  banking  supervision,  and  (ii) \n(i) assessed  and \nstrengthened  surveillance  and  undertaken  prompt  corrective  measures  for  banks  that  are  not \nconforming  to  the  laws  and  prudential  regulations.  NBC  continues  to  require  nonconforming \nbanks  to  provide  progress  reports  and  promptly  undertake  corrective  measures,  and  these \nreports have been discussed with ADB missions. Further, NBC has reviewed its regulations to \nstrengthen  good  corporate  governance,  including  the  requirement  for  fit  and  proper  testing  of \nkey  bank  management  covering  specific  banking  qualifications  and  experience  under \nSubprogram  2.  The  regulation  on  corporate  governance  including  the  requirements  for  fit  and \nproper test of key bank management has been formally issued as a prakas in October 2008. \n \n\nidentified  capacity  building  needs \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n20 \n \n \nAs a reflection of rapid economic growth, domestic liquidity has been rising rapidly, from \n38. \na very small base, partly fueled by  the surge in  capital inflows from foreign direct investments \nand by the rapid growth of credit to the private sector. Inflation has been sparked by supply-side \nshocks and surged from an annual rate of 10.8% in December 2007 to 25.1% in June 2008. The \ndomestic excess liquidity needs to be mopped up to avoid fueling an inflationary spiral. Under \nSubprogram  2,  NBC  doubled  the  reserve  requirement  from  8%  to  16%  in  July  2008  to  help \nreturn  bank  lending  to  sustainable  levels,  and  favorably  considered  applications  from \ncommercial  banks  to place  excess reserves  abroad  with  prudentially  approved  counterparties. \nPrior  to  introducing  the  above  measures,  NBC  consulted  the  IMF  in  March  2008  and  the \nBankers  Association  in  April  2008,  neither  of  which  had  any  objection  to  the  measures.  NBC \nhas  also  encouraged  the  Bankers  Association  to  start  interbank  lending  to  finance  any \ntemporary  liquidity  requirements.  NBC  will  continue  to  provide  periodic  macroeconomic  and \nfinancial data for ADB to monitor the performance of the financial sector.  \n \n\nc. \n\n2.3: Strengthen Prudential Supervision and Regulations for \nMicrofinance Institutions \n\n39. \nAppropriate financial regulation and supervision are essential to build resilience against \nfinancial crisis. Similarly, providing incentives and guidance to financial institutions could further \nenhance their operations. NBC made significant progress in building the regulatory framework \nfor licensing and supervising registered MFIs. It established a division for prudential supervision \nof MFIs within the Banking Supervision Department and it issued several prudential regulations \nin the form of prakas. Division staff has had some training through technical support10 from ADB \nto undertake off-site and, to a limited extent, on-site supervision. Under Subprogram 1, NBC has \nissued  regulations  to  amend  the  prakas  on  the  licensing  of  microfinance  institutions.  The \naccompanying TA for Subprogram 1 also provided technical support to help strengthen NBC\u2019s \nsupervision  of  MFIs.  NBC  issued  additional  regulations  covering  MFIs  that  can  mobilize \nvoluntary  savings  and  manage  foreign  exchange  risks  in  December  2007  and  early  2008, \nrespectively. The accompanying TA for Subprogram 2 will continue ADB\u2019s support to strengthen \noff-site and on-site supervision of the growing MFI subsector. \n \n\n  \n\nd. \n\n2.4: Enhance Legal Foundation to Support Financial and \nCommercial Transactions \n\n40. \nFor  financial  transactions  to  develop  beyond  basic,  short-term,  and  mainly  cash-based \ntransactions,  a  legal  framework  for  commerce  and  finance  must  be  developed,  updated,  and \nimplemented.  Progress  in  preparing  and  enacting  a  number  of  components  of  the  legal \nframework  for  financial  and  commercial  transactions  has  been  significant.  This  includes  the \ninsurance law, accounting and auditing law, commercial enterprises law, negotiable instruments \nand  payment \nlaw, \ngovernment securities law, civil procedures code, law on anti-money laundering and combating \nthe  financing  of  terrorism,  and  insolvency  law.  Under  Subprogram  1,  MEF  submitted  the  draft \nlaw  on  nongovernment  securities  to  the  National  Assembly  and  on  12  September  2007  the \nNational  Assembly  adopted  the  law.  Most  of  the  enacted  laws  have  been  implemented,  and \ntraining curricula have been introduced at selected legal faculties to train legal practitioners and \njudges on these new principles.  \n\nlaw,  commercial  arbitration \n\nlaw,  secured \n\ntransactions \n\ntransactions \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB.  2005.

Manila (Loan 2185-CAM). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\n \n41. \nLaws  that  were  recently  enacted  require  the  adoption  of  implementing  sub-decrees \nunder  Subprogram  2.  The  Government  has  developed  the  sub-decree  for  the  secured \ntransactions  law.  ADB  has  also  provided  technical  support  to  help  the  Ministry  of  Commerce \n(MOC)  complete  the  drafting  of  a  new  law  on  commercial  contracts.  The  new  law  would \nsupplement  the  Civil  Code  provisions  with  regard  to  contract  law  and  will  include  general \nprovisions  relating  to  agencies  and  franchising.  The  law  will  help  increase  reliance  on  and \nconfidence  in  the  use  of  written  commercial  contracts  in  Cambodia  for  a  variety  of  business \nto  review \ntransactions.  Subprogram  2  continued  supporting \nCambodia\u2019s requirements for a detailed set of rules for commercial transactions, review relevant \ninternational  models  and  approaches,  and  help  draft  a  new  harmonized  law  on  commercial \ncontracts.  Submission  of  the  draft  law  to  the  Council  of  Ministers  and  National  Assembly  is \nexpected during subprograms 3 and 4, respectively.  \n \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  efforts \n\n3. \n\nPromote Good Governance \n\na. \n\n3.1: Promote International Initiatives on Anti-Money Laundering and \nCombating the Financing of Terrorism \n\n42.  Work  to  implement  an  anti-money  laundering  (AML)  and  combating  the  financing  of \nterrorism (CFT) regime in Cambodia is supporting international deterrence efforts and promotes \nstandard  governance  principles.  This  will  help  build  market  confidence  and  discipline. \nThroughout 2005 and 2006, NBC and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre \n(AUSTRAC)  conducted  joint  training  workshops  on  AML  and  CFT  in  general,  including \nprocedures  to  assess  suspicious  transactions  reports  and  the  roles  of  compliance  officers  at \nbanks  and  financial  institutions.  They  also  conducted  an  AML  and  CFT  assessment. \nSubprogram 1 supported the Government in its successful efforts to adopt the law on AML and \nCFT  in  2007.  This  was  followed  by  adoption  of  sub-decrees  to  appoint  the  board  of  directors \nand secretary general to head the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and to formally establish the \nFIU  with  5  staff  members  during  Subprogram  2.  ADB,  World  Bank,  AUSTRAC,  Asia  Pacific \nGroup on Money Laundering, the Bank Negara Malaysia, and other development partners are \nproviding technical assistance to help the Government implement the AML and CFT initiatives. \n \n\nb. \n\n3.2: Enhance Corporate Governance and Transparency in the \nInsurance Industry \n\nBuilding  consumer  confidence  in  insurance  as  a  service  will  first  require  public \n43. \nunderstanding  of  the  insurance  business  and  the  services  it  can  provide.  Business  must  be \nconducted  as  transparently  as  possible  to  protect  consumers  and  ensure  that  information \nprovided to the general public and the regulator is accurate. The goal for all participants in the \nindustry  is  to  raise  their  operations  to  international  standards.  The  reinsurer  and  regulator  are \nresponsible for reinforcing these standards. The Government and the insurance association can \ncontribute  to  the  insurance  industry\u2019s  development  by  increasing  public  awareness  about \ninsurance.  The  regulator  can  take  a  leadership  role  by  ensuring  transparency  within  the \nindustry, as well as for the general public and other government ministries. Under Subprogram \n1,  MEF  issued  regulations  on  (i)  premium  rates  for  fire  insurance,  and  (ii) licensing  of  general \nand  life  insurance  companies.  MEF  also  issued  prakas  covering  corporate  governance  and \nsolvency for insurance companies in early 2008. A prakas on accounting guidelines for general \ninsurance  was  discussed  with  international  accounting  firms,  the  National  Accounting  Council, \nand the insurance firms, and this has been adopted under Subprogram 2.  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n22 \n \n \n\nc. \n\n3.3: Establish Commercial Dispute Resolution Mechanism \n\n44. \nTo  promote  good  governance  and  boost  public  confidence  in  the  financial  system,  the \nGovernment  enacted  the  law  on  commercial  arbitration  in  2006,  and  the  draft  sub-decree  is \nbeing  reviewed  by  the  Council  of  Ministers.  Work  to  establish  a  national  arbitration  center  will \nbegin after adoption of the sub-decree. The arbitration center will improve the effectiveness and \nefficiency  of  the  commercial  and  financial  systems,  as  well  as  provide  the  commercial \ncommunity  with a cost-effective non-judicial process for dispute resolution. With greater public \nawareness  of  the  arbitration  center\u2019s  functioning,  confidence  in  the  financial  sector  should \nincrease. Before the center can commence operation, however, members of the judiciary, legal \nprofession,  and  management  personnel  will  need  to  be  trained.  TA  under  Subprogram  2  will \nsupport  MOC\u2019s  efforts  to  establish  a  national  arbitration  center  by  adopting  the  implementing \nsub-decree along with appropriate rules and procedures for commercial arbitration. \n \n\nd. \n\n3.4: Strengthen the Accounting Institutions and Professional \nCapacity of Members \n\n45. \nFor  efficient  financial  intermediation,  financial  market  infrastructure  needs  to  be \ndeveloped\u2014particularly accounting and auditing systems plus qualified personnel to implement \nthem.  In  2005,  only  10  locally  qualified  accountants  were  working  in  Cambodia  and  the  MEF \nintroduced  an  initiative  to  improve  accounting  and  auditing  capacity  through  a  Government-\nfunded scholarship scheme to assist at least 70 candidates per year to acquire the qualification \nneeded  to  become  members  of  the  Kampuchea  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountants  and \nAuditors.  These  scholarships  were  initially  awarded  to  government  civil  servants  only.  A \nsignificant  number  of  awardees  dropped  out  for  various  reasons,  and  results  were  very  poor. \nThrough policy dialogue, this was opened to the general public and selection is now based on \nmerit.  The  scholarships  were  opened  to  the  public  in  2006,  and  the  results  have  greatly \nimproved. Under Subprogram 2, MEF continued to support this public scholarship scheme. \n \n\n4. \n\nEnhance Efficiency in the Financial Sector \n\na. \n\n4.1: Computerize and Integrate Key Operating Functions of NBC  \n\n46. \nNBC\u2019s  current  information  technology  system  is  not  well  integrated  across  the  bank, \nresulting  in  duplication  and  inefficiency.  NBC  would  gain  considerable  benefits  in  terms  of  its \nability  to  provide  a  more  efficient  service  to  the  banking  sector  by  implementing  an  integrated \nsystem  that  initially  links  the  accounting  department  to  the  cash  management  functions  in  the \nissues  department,  the  customer  account  management  in  the  banking  operations  department, \nand  the  foreign  exchange  transactions  in  the  exchange  management  department.  Under \nSubprogram 1, NBC reviewed and adopted the information technology architecture model for a \ntotal estimated cost of $4.0 million. MEF has allocated a $4.0 million grant to NBC to finance the \nnew system, including the required hardware, and ADB provided two international consultants to \nassist NBC in procuring, designing, and installing the system. Under  Subprogram 2, NBC has \nreviewed  its  management  information  system  and  commenced  the  procurement  process  to \nacquire the software and hardware for an integrated accounting system.  \n \n47. \nImplementation by NBC will continue in subsequent subprograms with technical support \nfrom ADB. Benefits are foreseen, too, in providing improved application software for other parts \nof the bank, in particular departments that do not need to link to the core banking system in real \ntime, such as banking supervision, personnel, and economic research and statistics. Eventually \nthe  system  should  also  link  the  accounting  department  to  the  NBC  branches,  thus  promoting \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nfinancial  deepening  and  operating  efficiency.  A  wide  area  network  infrastructure  will  be \nestablished at NBC to facilitate real time clearing and settlement operations.  \n\nb. \n\n4.2: Upgrade the Capacity of Microfinance Institution Staff \n\n48. \nFinding  adequately  trained  and  skilled  people  to  meet  the  needs  of  a  growing \nmicrofinance  industry  is  an  ongoing  challenge.  Growth  puts  pressure  on  the  delivery  and \ncustomer  sides  of  the  business.  Capacity  development  structures  are  needed  within  MFIs.  In \nconsultation with the association of MFIs, the Center for Banking Studies (CBS) will undertake a \nreview  of  its  curriculum  with  the  objective  of  expanding  the  scope  of  training  to  include  all \naspects of MFI business and to increase management awareness of liquidity risk, interest rate \nrisk,  concentration  of  credit  risk,  and  foreign  exchange  risk.  Technical  assistance  under \nSubprogram 2 is helping to review and upgrade the CBS curriculum.  \n \nB. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $10,300,000  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \n49. \nFunds  resources  for  Subprogram  2.  The  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single  tranche  upon \nsatisfactory compliance with specific conditions indicated in the policy matrix. The loan will have \na  24-year  term,  including  an  8-year  grace  period.  The  interest  rate  will  be  1.0%  per  annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The ADB funds are to support the reforms outlined \nin the development policy letter of 26 October 2007 and the policy matrix as updated.  \n \nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management  \n\n50. \nNBC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  MEF  and  MOC  will  be  the  implementing \nagencies for Subprogram 2. The financial sector steering committee will continue to coordinate \nprogram  implementation  among  government  ministries  and  agencies  concerned.  To  ensure \ntimely program implementation, the committee, comprising senior officers from MEF, MOC, and \nNBC,  will  meet  as  required  to  review  progress  reports  from  the  technical  working  group  and \nconsider pending issues. The committee will propose concrete actions to resolve those issues. \nA senior NBC officer has been appointed as program director to assist MEF, MOC, and NBC in \ncoordinating  day-to-day  program  implementation.  The  program  director  will  be  required  to \nsubmit quarterly progress reports on Subprogram 2 implementation. \n\n \n2. \n\nPeriod of Implementation  \n\nThe  implementation  period  for  Subprogram  2  is  from  January  to  December  2008.  The \n\n51. \nGovernment has implemented all policy actions for the release of the single tranche. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement  \n\nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local \n52. \nduties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  a \nnegative  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  5)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. All procurement of goods and services produced in, and originating from, \nADB member countries will be made with due consideration to economy and efficiency, as well \nas in accordance with standard public sector procedures in Cambodia and normal private sector \ncommercial practices acceptable to ADB. In accordance with provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification \n\n \n\n\f \n\n24 \n \n \nof  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans  (1998),  the  loan \nproceeds will be disbursed to the Government as the Borrower. The Government will certify that \n(i)  the  value  of  the  country\u2019s  eligible  imports  is  equal  to,  or  exceeds,  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s \nprojected  disbursements  under  the  loan  in  a  given  period;  and  (ii)  the  loan  proceeds  will  be \nutilized  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  based  on  the \ncertification  provided  by  the  Government,  which  confirms  that  the  requirements  for  the  loan \nhave been met. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the \naccuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. Subprogram 2 will provide for retroactive financing for \nexpenditures incurred by the Government up to 180 days prior to loan effectiveness.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  the  Policy  on  Combating \n53. \nMoney Laundering (2003) were explained to the Government. All relevant ADB guidelines and \nthe  loan  regulations  were  specifically  brought  to  the  attention  and  notice  of  the  Government. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire the Government to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. All contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Program shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, and service providers as they relate to the \nProgram. \n \nAn assessment of the country\u2019s public financial management systems was carried out to \n54. \nbetter  understand  the  fiduciary  risks  and  determine  appropriate  arrangements  for  the  fiduciary \narrangements of Subprogram 2. Discussions were held with the Government during formulation \nof Subprogram 2 on the funds flow from NBC to MEF and the contribution of the ongoing public \nfinancial  management  reform  program  to  the  administration  of  loan  proceeds. 11  Very \nsatisfactory  progress  has  been  noted  in  revenue  collections,  with  greater  use  of  the  banking \nsystem to streamline revenue collection and payment processes. The redesign of an integrated \nchart  of  accounts  and  budget  classification  has  been  substantially  completed  to  improve \nexpenditure  tracking  and  reporting.  As  part  of  efforts  to  improve  governance  and  reduce \ncorruption, the Government continues to place significant emphasis on strengthening the overall \npublic  financial  management  system,  internal  systems  (including  internal  audit  functions),  and \nthe functions of the National Audit Authority. The ongoing public financial management program, \nwhich started in 2004 and is supported by 10 development partners including ADB,12 has helped \nlower the fiduciary risk of the system. \n \n55. \nA core component of Subprogram  2 focuses on promoting good governance, deterring \nmoney  laundering  and  financing  of  terrorism,  and  implementing  measures  that  will  help  deter \ncorruption in the overall economy (a good governance framework is in Supplementary Appendix \nA).  Subprogram  2  includes  measures  to  improve  the  management  information  system  and \nreporting standards within NBC, banks, and MFIs; promote transparency of information released \nby banks and MFIs; improve compliance with and usefulness of the credit information sharing \n\n                                                 \n11 Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance.  2007.

Increasing  use  of  payment  instruments  other  than  cash  will  particularly \nhelp discourage corruption at central, provincial, and district treasuries. These reforms will help \nkeep savers and investors informed, empower civil society to monitor the weaknesses in these \nfinancial institutions, and deter those who are vulnerable to corrupt activities. \n \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n\nThe  Government  will  open  or  nominate  an  account  with  NBC  to  receive  the  loan \n56. \nproceeds  for  Subprogram  2.  It  will  manage,  operate,  and  liquidate  the  account  in  accordance \nwith  terms  satisfactory  to  ADB.  ADB  will  retain  the  right  to  audit  any  account  and  records \nrelating to utilization of the loan proceeds.  \n \n\n6. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Review \n\n57. \nThe program director (para. 50) will coordinate and submit quarterly progress reports on \npolicy  and  institutional  reform  implementation  to  the  financial  sector  steering  committee  and \nADB. The reports will be submitted in such form and detail as ADB may request, and include (i) \nprogress made and problems encountered during the review period, (ii) steps taken or proposed \nto  remedy  problems  encountered,  and  (iii)  proposed  detailed  activities  planned  for  the  next \nreview period. The Government will inform ADB of outcomes of policy discussions with the IMF, \nWorld  Bank  Group,  and  bilateral  funding  agencies  having  implications  for  Subprogram  2 \nimplementation. \n \nADB,  in  cooperation  with  NBC,  MEF,  and  MOC,  will  conduct  semiannual  reviews  of \n58. \nprogram implementation progress and assess macroeconomic developments and their impacts \non the financial and related sectors of the economy. The Government and ADB will continue to \nengage in active policy dialogue throughout Subprogram 2 implementation on macroeconomic \nissues  that  may  affect  financial  sector  development  and  on  additional  reforms  that  may  be \nnecessary  or  desirable  for  sustainable  development  of  the  financial  sector.  Not  later  than  4 \nmonths  after  completion  of  Subprogram  2,  the  Government  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a \nprogram completion report. \n \n\nVII. \n\nSUBPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND RISKS \n\nA.  \n\nBenefits \n\n59.  With  a  rapidly  growing  commercial  economy  that  requires  a  sound  financial  system  to \nsustain  economic  growth,  the  Government,  if  it  is  to  achieve  long-term  sustainable  economic \ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction,  needs  to  develop  the  financial  sector  by  mobilizing  financial \nresources, channeling them to productive investments, and managing inherent risks. The Asian \nfinancial  crisis  of  the  1990s  provided  many  examples  of  the  devastating  impact  that  financial \ncrises can have on countries, wiping out several years of growth within a very short time. Thus, \nto promote economic growth, reduce poverty, and help Cambodia avoid financial crises, FSP II, \nSubprogram 2 will support the Government in its development agenda. \n \n60. \nThe policies supported by Financial Sector Program II Cluster\u2014Subprogram 2 will help \nreduce  information  asymmetry,  improve  governance,  enhance  financial  stability,  and  improve \nefficiency in the financial sector. These factors will contribute to a more conducive environment \nfor  continued  financial  market  development.  FSP  II,  Subprogram  2  is  expected  to  help  boost \nconfidence among market participants and, with improvements to the payments, clearance, and \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n26 \n \n \nsettlement  system,  financial  intermediation  will  grow.  That  will  result  in  a  wider  offering  of \nproducts and services in urban and rural areas. A sound, more efficient, and diversified financial \nsector  will  support  higher  investments  and  productivity  in  the  private  sector.  Together  with \nbroader economic reforms, the reforms in the financial sector will contribute to higher economic \ngrowth. \n\n \nB.        Social and Environmental Safeguards \n\nSubprogram 2 will not entail any involuntary resettlement or have a negative impact on \n61. \nindigenous people or the environment. It is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement, \nimpact  on  indigenous  people,  and  impact  on  the  environment.  Subprogram  2  is  a  general \nintervention aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth. In that respect, it is expected to \nhave  an  indirect  positive  effect  on  poverty  reduction.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social \nstrategy is in Appendix 6. \n \nC.    Assumptions and Risks \n\n62. \nFinancial  Sector  Program  II  Cluster\u2014Subprogram  2  assumes  political  stability  in \nCambodia and sustained implementation of sound macroeconomic policies by the Government. \nGiven  Cambodia\u2019s  encouraging  results  in  the  past  decade,  both  these  assumptions  are  valid \nand  defensible.  Implementation  of  Subprogram  2  could  face  a  number  of  risks,  however,  for \nwhich mitigation measures have been put in place.  \n \n\n(i) \n\nChallenges to sustaining economic growth. Cambodia\u2019s economic prospects \nmust  be  viewed  against  a  number  of  adverse  developments  in  the  external \nenvironment. The immediate impact of the financial crisis in the US and Europe, \nand  the  drying  up  there  of  liquidity  in  the  commercial  paper  and  related  money \nand  interbank  markets,  pose  limited  or  no  direct\u2014or  indirect\u2014financial  sector \nrisks to Cambodia\u2019s economy, either through balance sheets or liquidity factors, \nas  Cambodia\u2019s  banks  do  not  have  significant  exposure  to  borrowing  from \ninternational  banks  and  capital  markets  do  not  as  yet  exist.  However,  the \nslowdown  in  the  global  economy  resulting  from  the  fall  in  US  and  European \ngrowth rates has impacted on Cambodia\u2019s growth rate, initially through reduced \nexpansion  of  exports  due  to  reduced  demand  for  Cambodian  garments.  The \nrecent  unexpected  surge  in  international  energy  and  food  prices  has  fueled \nhigher domestic inflation in 2008, with potential knock-on effects for consumption \nand  poverty,  growth,  and  financial  sector  stability.  In  addition  to  foreign  direct \ninvestment inflows, the rapid credit expansion is adding to growth in real estate \ninvestment  and  to  rising  property  prices.  This  is  causing  the  assets  of  some \nbanks  to  be  increasingly  vulnerable  to  real  estate  risks.  The  Government  has \nintroduced  a  combination  of  fiscal  and  monetary  measures  that  have  helped  to \nmoderate inflation and slow lending. Throughout Subprogram 2, the Government \nand  ADB  have  undertaken  periodic  reviews  of  macroeconomic  and  financial \ndevelopments to assess potential risks to the financial sector. These reviews will \ncontinue  through  the  program  period  for  Subprogram  3.  Budget  assistance \nthrough  a  series  of  program  loans  in  2008,  including  via  this  program,  is  being \nprovided  to  bolster  the  economy\u2019s  resilience.  The  poverty  impact  of  food  price \n\n\f \n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\n (ii) \n\n(ii) \n\nincreases  is  being  mitigated  through  emergency  assistance  approved  for  this \npurpose.13   \nUnexpected  political  disturbance.  Cambodia  has  been  enjoying  very  high \npolitical unity and stability for several years. The national election was conducted \npeacefully  on  27  July  2008,  as  was  the  swearing-in  ceremony  of  the  new \nGovernment on 25 September 2008. In anticipation of any delays in forming the \nnew Government, Subprogram 2 was designed to ensure that most of the legal \ndrafting that closely involves midlevel officials would be done prior to formation of \nthe  Government  so  that  draft  laws  and  sub-decrees  would  be  ready  for \nsubmission to the Council of Ministers once the new Government was sworn in.  \n Weak  governance  and  corruption  in  the  sector.  Weak  governance  and \nincidents  of  corruption  could  erode  investor  confidence  and  prevent  the \nattainment  of  expected  sector  outcomes.  The  Government\u2019s  National  Strategic \nDevelopment  Plan  2006\u20132010  views  corruption  as  a  threat  to  sustained  growth \nand  development  of  the  country  in  general.  Backed  by  an  active  development \ncommunity,  the  Government  is  taking  an  increasingly  tougher  stance  against \ncorruption.  The  general  consensus  is  that  good  governance  and  measures  to \naddress  corruption  are  needed  for  a  successful  partnership  between  the \nGovernment  and  the  development  community.  This  was  considered  during \ndesign  of  the  program  cluster,  and  there  will  be  continuous  pursuit  of \nimprovements  to  the  institutional  governance  structure,  accounting  disclosure \nstandards, financial transparency, complementary legislation, regulatory updates \nand enforcement, supervision, and surveillance of the financial sector.  \n\n(iv)  Weak institutional and human capacity. Some of the financial sector risks are \nassociated with weak institutional and human capacity. The same applies to the \nimplementation and enforcement of new laws and regulations. To mitigate those \nrisks,  training  programs  have  been  initiated  at  various  training  institutions \nestablished  during  FSP  I.  Financial  Sector  Program  II  Cluster  -  Subprogram  2 \nprovides  financial  support  to  the  institutions  to  help  update  their  curricula.  The \nproposed  advisory  TA  will  help  reduce  the  risks  arising  from  weak  capacity, \nespecially  in  the  implementation  of  all  prudential  regulations.  With  these  design \nsafeguards, the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to far outweigh any \ncosts. \n\n \n\nVIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nA  program  of  annual  TA  projects  was  identified  to  help  implement  the  FSP  II  medium-\n63. \nterm  program.  Implementing  TA  for  $1.7  million  was  approved  with  Subprogram  1  to  support \nNBC, MEF, and MOC in implementing the policy and institutional reforms under Subprogram 2 \nand  some  of  the  reform  triggers  and  milestones  for  Subprogram  3.  In  response  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s  request,  ADB  has  prepared  a  TA  project  to  support  NBC,  MEF,  and  MOC  in \nimplementing  key  reform  triggers  for  Subprogram  3.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  a  total  of \n$375,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  finance  $300,000  from  its  TA  funding  program  and  the \nGovernment  will  provide  the  remaining  $75,000  equivalent  in  the  form  of  office  space, \ncounterpart staff, and other support facilities.  \n \n64. \nThe  main  activities  of  the  TA  are  to  (i)  further  strengthen  on-site  supervision  and \nsurveillance  of  the  banking  system  (4  person-months),  (ii)  help  strengthen  off-site  and  on-site \n\n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2008.

A  total  of \n17 person-months  of  consulting  inputs,  comprising  11 international  and  6  national  person-\nmonths,  are  required.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  on  an  individual  basis  to \nimplement TA activities in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time),  using  the  competitive  selection  method.

The era was marked \nby  a  rapid  rise  in  the  number  of  joint  ventures,  locally  incorporated  family-owned  banks, \nbranches of foreign banks, and state-owned financial institutions. This resulted in most financial \ninstitutions  being  poorly  managed  and  almost  half  being  considered  technically  insolvent. \nSupported  by  an  International  Monetary  Fund  poverty  reduction  and  growth  facility  that  was \nphased out in 2003, the banking system relicensing program (i) introduced a legal framework for \nbanks  and  financial  institutions,  (ii)  successfully  closed  all  nonviable  banks,  (iii) relicensed  the \nremaining  banks  under  strengthened  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC)  supervision \nrequirements, and (iv) initiated restructuring and privatization of the major state-owned foreign \ntrade  bank.  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  remains  shallow  and  fragile  with  limited  financial \nintermediation and outreach. \n \n2. \nAt  the  end  of  June  2008,  the  formal  financial  system  comprised  NBC,  20  commercial \nbanks,  5  specialized  banks,  and  2  representative  offices  of  foreign-based  banks;  16  licensed \nand 26 registered microfinance institutions (MFIs); and 6 insurance companies. Cambodia has \nyet to establish bond or securities markets. The predominantly rural nature of the economy, high \ntransaction costs, inability of the real sector to put together bankable projects, and low creditor \nconfidence  have  been  the  main  factors  causing  the  low  formal  intermediation  and  outreach \nwithin  the  sector,  slow  development  in  nonbank  financial  institutions,  and  limited  range  of \nproducts and services being offered. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  vision  for  the  financial  sector  is  for  a  sound,  market-based  system \n3. \nthat  will  enhance  resource  mobilization,  ensure  the  effective  allocation  of  financial  resources, \nand  contribute  to  broad-based  sustainable  economic  growth  as  embodied  in  the  Financial \nSector  Development  Strategy  (FSDS)  2006\u20132015.  The  FSDS  recognizes  that,  for  equitable \ngrowth to occur, a diversified, competitive, but prudentially sound financial system would play an \nimportant  role  in  national  development  by  ensuring  efficient  accumulation  and  effective \nallocation of financial resources. At the same time, expanding finance brings risks. Hence, when \npursuing  financial  development,  a  focus  on  prudential  risk  management,  transparency,  and \nuniform application of rules and regulations is needed. \n \n4. \nDominated  by  the  banking  system,  the  financial  sector  has  gone  through  major \nrestructuring  and  reforms  since  the  mid-1990s.  In  1996,  NBC  was  established  as  the  central \nbank following promulgation of the Law on the Organization and Conduct of the National Bank \nof Cambodia. In 1999, the Government enacted the Law on Banking and Financial Institutions, \nenabling NBC to undertake a relicensing program that brought about the closure of 16 nonviable \nbanks  in  2002,  raised  capital  requirements  for  the  remaining  banks  to  $13  million  equivalent, \nand set the minimum capital adequacy requirement at 20% of risk-weighted assets (which was \nthen  appropriately  reduced  to  15%  in  2004).  In  an  effort  to  further  strengthen  and  consolidate \nthe banking system, NBC issued a directive in September 2008 requiring commercial banks that \nare owned by nonbank entities or individuals to increase their minimum capital to the equivalent \nof $36.5 million by 2010. The Financial Sector Development Blueprint,14 formulated and adopted \nin 2001, provided a clear set of objectives and a sequenced program of reforms in the financial \nsector.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  the  lead  development  partner  in \nsupporting the Government\u2019s efforts to implement the blueprint to improve financial soundness \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2001. Cambodia Financial Sector Blueprint for 2001-2010. Manila \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n41\n\nand  efficiency,  restore  confidence,  attract  a  broader  base  of  high-quality  financial  institutions, \nand broaden the sector\u2019s outreach within the blueprint framework. \n \n5. \nThe  economy  is  largely  cash-based  and  highly  dollarized.  Dollarization  emerged  in \nCambodia because public confidence in the local currency eroded following a series of shocks \nduring the conflict and financial mismanagement prior to 1989. In some instances, dollarization \nhas assisted development of the financial sector,  but, in other respects, dollarization limits the \ntools  the  Government  can  use  in  its  monetary  policies.  With  recent  improvements  in \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  measures  taken  by  the  authorities  to  restore  confidence  in \ninstitutions and in the banking system, public confidence is growing but slowly, and dollarization \nremains high. In the absence of reliable data, the amount of dollars and other foreign currencies \ncirculating in Cambodia cannot be verified. Thai baht and Vietnamese dong banknotes are also \nwidely used in some of the provinces bordering Thailand and Viet Nam. The cash nature of the \neconomy means that even major transactions are settled in cash outside of the banking system \nand paper trails are minimal.  \n \nThe private sector is characterized by a high degree of informality, and it is dominated by \n6. \nthe informal sector. Enterprises that have enjoyed years of operating without established rule of \nlaw prefer to remain informal. The tax regime is still very open to negotiation and the majority of \nparticipants  in  the  real  sector,  especially  in  rural  areas,  are  reluctant  to  enter  into  any  form  of \nformal financial transactions for fear of being exposed to the tax authorities. Private enterprises \nare generally family owned with no separation between management and owners who usually \ndo not maintain proper records, including financial reports, that can be considered reliable.  \n \nBanking System. No legal barriers are in place for the entry of foreign banks. At the end \n7. \nof June 2008, nine commercial banks had majority foreign ownership. The commercial banking \nsubsector at the end of June 2008 consists of 20 commercial banks, 5 specialized banks, and  \n2  representative  offices  of  foreign-based  banks.  Despite  the  increase  in  the  number  of  banks, \nhigh transaction costs and markups remain. Nevertheless, competition is starting to pick up and \nthere  is  some  evidence  of  market  segmentation  emerging.  With  the  exception  of  the  Rural \nDevelopment  Bank,  the  banking  system  is  almost  entirely  owned  by  the  private  sector.  Most \nbanks  have  established  branches  in  other  urban  centers  and  are  planning  to  open  additional \noffices in those areas.  \n \n8. \nTo date most branches are concentrated in large urban centers, but this is expected to \nchange. ACLEDA bank, a former MFI, currently has branches in every province and a total of \n212 sites provide banking services. Canadia bank has 17 branches outside Phnom Penh. Five \nother  banks  have  more  than  3  branches  outside  Phnom  Penh,  including  ANZ  Royal  bank  (12 \nbranches) with automated teller machines at each of its branches. At the end of 2007, bank staff \ntotaled more than 6,869, with one bank (ACLEDA) employing 4,401 and other banks employing \nbetween 20 and 250. Technical capacity is still weak and most banks provide their own in-house \ntraining to complement the training programs offered by the Bankers Association. \n \n9. \nCommercial  banking  is  relatively  small  but  growing  quickly.  The  more  aggressive  and \nprogressive  banks  attained  average  year-on-year  growth  rates  of  77%  for  credit  and  74%  for \ndeposits  at  the  end  of  2007.  The  number  of  commercial  bank  loans  increased  by  127%  from \n2002 to total 209,053 at the end of June 2008. If these loans were all to individual borrowers, \nthen  it  would  be  the  equivalent  of  providing  loans  to  1.5%  of  Cambodia\u2019s  population.  Total \nbanking  assets  represented  about  38.75%  of  the  estimated  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in \n2007. The banking system is fairly concentrated, with about 77.63% of deposits held by the six \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nlargest commercial banks. These six also accounted for about 84.6% of total loans at the end of \n2007.   \n \n10. \nCommercial  banks  mainly  offer  simple  services  to  retail  and  corporate  customers  in \nurban areas (time and term deposits, savings accounts, basic loans, domestic and cross-border \nwire  transfers,  foreign  exchange,  letters  of  credit,  etc.).  Specialized  banks  are  not  allowed  by \nlaw to accept deposits, and commercial banks had about 603,992 depositors (more than 4% of \nthe total population) at the end of 2007. Most deposit products are short-term in nature and, as \na  consequence,  loan  terms  are  also  short  (average  3  years)  with  high  interest  rates.  Banks \ncontinue to rely on physical collateral and personal guarantee as loan security. More advanced \nbanking  services  are  being  introduced,  such  as  electronic  banking  and  private  banking.  As  of \nthe end of 2007, 177 ATMs had been installed throughout the urban areas. Several banks have \nindicated that they plan to increase this number. \n \n11. \nThe  noncash  payment  system  is  very  small  and  of  limited  sophistication.  It  is \npredominantly  paper-based  and  manual.  NBC  runs  the  clearinghouse,  which  operates  in  both \nriels  and  dollars.  The  riel  clearinghouse  has  19  members  (NBC,  Ministry  of  Economy  and \nFinance  [MEF],  and  17  banks)  and  the  dollar  clearinghouse  has  22  members  (NBC  and  21 \nbanks). Daily amounts passing through the clearinghouses average about $36 million, of which \nriel clearances represent only around 3%. About 1,811 checks are cleared each day, of which \naround 94% are drawn in dollars. The first clearance is at 9:30 a.m., with a second clearance at \n3:00  p.m.  to  handle  returns.  Banks  bring  their  balances  to  the  clearinghouse  on  flash  drives. \nInterbank settlement is by check drawn on the banks\u2019 accounts with NBC. The enactment of the \nnegotiable  instruments  and  payment  transactions  law  in  late  2005  and  the  issuance  of  key \nregulations  in  December  2006  provided  the  legal  framework  for  developing  the  payments \nsystem, introducing new negotiable instruments, and promoting the development of money and \ninterbank markets. \n \nNBC\u2019s  principal  mission  is  to  formulate  and  implement  monetary  policy  aimed  at \n12. \nmaintaining  price  stability  and  economic  development.  Its  main  functions  are  to  (i)  act  as  the \nmonetary authority and conduct monetary policy (NBC has actively intervened in the riel foreign \nexchange market to deliver a stable exchange rate and ensure price stability in riels), (ii) act as \nthe  sole  issuer  of  the  national  currency  (as  such  NBC  has  increased  the  number  of  currency \ndenominations and replaced worn and dirty bank notes), (iii) act as the supervisory authority of \nthe  banking  and  financial  system,  (iv)  oversee  the  payments  system  in  Cambodia,  and  \n(v) manage the international reserves of the country.    \n \n13. \nThe banking supervision program and standards have greatly improved since 2001 and \nbeen  extended  to  cover  all  banks,  a  move  made  possible  with  the  addition  of  skilled  staff. \nPrudential supervision was enhanced with the adoption of the uniform chart of accounts by all \nbanks in 2004, and by the same banks making their annual audited financial statements publicly \navailable since 2005. Several banks have published these annual audited financial statements \non  their  own  websites.  In  2006,  NBC  enhanced  its  regulatory  and  supervisory  system  by \nimplementing  an  off-site  supervision  system  known  as  Cambodian  Bank  Reporting  for  Prompt \nCorrective Action. The system enables staff to perform a regular analysis of off-site reports, to \nidentify  risks  faced  by  banks  and  infringements  caused  by  banks,  and  then  for  the  staff \nconcerned  to  recommend  immediate  actions  to  NBC  management.  The  development  and \nimplementation of the system has been supported by a resident advisor from the International \nMonetary Fund. NBC continues to undertake on-site inspection of each bank once a year. \n \n14. \n\nBanking,  along  with  other  financial  and  commercial  subsectors,  continues  to  face  high \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n43\n\ntransitioned \n\nin  2002.  A  number  have \n\ntransaction  costs  attributable  to  the  lack  of  mechanisms  to  enforce  contracts  and  absence  of \nreliable information. The establishment of the credit information sharing system in 2006 should \nimprove  the  situation,  but  some  time  will  be  required  to  build  a  sufficient  database.  Dispute \nsettlement  remains  a  major  issue  and,  if  unresolved,  will  continue  to  affect  the  degree  of \ncertainty  associated  with  financial  and  commercial  transactions.  Financial  sector  stakeholders \nwould  undoubtedly  welcome  the  operations  of  a  commercial  court  and  commercial  arbitration \ncenter to provide a greater degree of certainty. \n \n15.  Microfinance  Subsector.  Microfinance  is  growing  rapidly,  with  assets  expanding \ngenerally  at  around  73%  in  2007  and  some  institutions  expanding  at  146%  per  annum.  The \nexpansion  is  allowing  microfinance  to  support  and  grow  the  economy,  especially  in  its  target \nmarket of the poor and remote rural population. The microfinance subsector now comprises 16 \nlicensed  MFIs,  26  registered  rural  credit  operations,  and  around  60  nongovernment \norganizations  operating  unrestricted  across  the  whole  country.  Registration  and  licensing \ncommenced \nfrom  aid-focused  nongovernment \norganizations  to  commercial  MFIs,  and  some  were  set  up  as  commercial,  profit-oriented  MFIs \nfrom  the  outset.  Most  MFIs  have  plans  to  continue  rapid  expansion  with  the  establishment  of \nadditional branches and increased lending activities at existing branches. \n \n16. \nAs of the end of June 2008, MFIs had around 689,200 clients (about 4.9% of the total \npopulation)  and  loans  outstanding  with  an  average  size  of  $250.  The  expansion  in  the  net \nnumber of loans is currently around 32% per annum. Voluntary savings of MFIs are very small. \nLicensed MFIs have adopted a wide range of business models with good corporate governance \nand orderly market development to deliver their services and products. This was highlighted in \n2007,  when  Cambodian  MFIs  won  4  of  20  financial  transparency  awards  presented  by  the \nConsultative Group to Assist the Poor.    \n \n17.  MFIs,  while  growing  rapidly,  have  major  challenges  to  expanding  their  services. \nAddressing these issues should assist them to continue to grow in a sound manner. MFIs face \ncompetition from informal operators in their markets. The scale of this competition is anecdotally \nsaid to exceed the size of the formal financial sector, but no reliable data is available to support \nthis view. A number of costs and challenges are imposed on the industry, such as nonresident \nwithholding  tax,  lack  of  a  reliable  method  to  track  the  use  of  certificates  of  title  for  collateral \nbetween institutions, and extremely limited access to domestic funding sources. Growth brings \nits  own  challenges,  such  as  whether  management  is  able  to  maintain  control  over  business \nprocesses  when  the  scale  of  operations  begins  to  outstrip  the  capabilities  of  current  systems \nand  processes.  Foreign  borrowing  does  bring  growth  and  benefits  in  terms  of  improved \ngovernance and transparency, but, at the same time, foreign borrowing brings growing foreign \nexchange risk as institutions increase their lending in the riel-based rural areas. \n \n18.  Moneychangers.  In  addition  to  banks,  the  Law  on  Foreign  Exchange,  1997,  allows \nindividuals and legal entities to undertake currency exchange if they register with NBC. They are \nnot allowed to undertake any other financial activity. As of the end of April 2008, the country had \n649 registered moneychangers (34 in Phnom Penh and 615 in the provinces). Statistics on the \ntransactions undertaken by moneychangers are not available. \n \n19. \nInsurance  Subsector.  The Department of Financial Industry within MEF is responsible \nfor prudential regulation and supervision of the insurance industry, which consists of one state-\nowned  and  four  private  nonlife  insurance  companies  plus  a  reinsurance  company  that  is  80% \nstate-owned. Negotiation for the sale of 75% of Caminco\u2019s (the state-owned firm\u2019s) shares to a \njoint venture comprising an insurance firm from Thailand and a Cambodian investor is in its final \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nstage.  The  insurance  industry  is  young  and  small.  It  has  gone  through  a  turbulent  period,  but \nwith  the  introduction  of  regulations  and  the  enforcement  of  those  regulations,  stability  and \ngrowth have returned. The regulator requires the capital of each company to be distributed as \nfollows:  10%  deposited  with  NBC,  50%  deposited  in  commercial  banks,  with  the  decision  on \nhow to invest the 40% balance left to the insurance company concerned. Insurance companies \nhave  indicated  that  they  would  like  these  ratios  to  be  changed,  and  the  40%  increased.  A \nrevision of the insurance law has been initiated by MEF. \n \nGrowth has been steady (averaging 11\u201315% in the last 3 years) from a limited range of \n20. \ninsurance products. The total gross premiums were $17.5 million at the end of 2007. The three \nnonlife  categories  of  insurance  products  (commercial  vehicles,  construction  sites,  and \npassenger  vehicle  liabilities)  underwritten  in  this  market  are  compulsory  by  regulation.  Growth \nhas been steady since 2003, with commercial fire and miscellaneous policies making up 63% of \nthe market and motor vehicle insurance 19%. Other products sold include hospital and surgical, \npersonal  and  accident,  marine  cargo,  and  travelers  insurance.  The  insurance  companies \noperating in Cambodia are conservatively managed.   \n \n21. \nThe  insurance  industry  requires  a  number  of  specialist  skills  that  are  not  required  in \nother industries. As insurance is a fairly new concept in Cambodia, these specialist skills are not \navailable and need to be acquired (e.g., the skills of underwriters, actuaries, loss adjustors, and \nfund  managers).  The  framework  for  insurance  supervision  has  been  developed,  but  material \ndeficiencies in terms of capacity for supervision remain.  \n \n22. \nCapital  Market.  Cambodia  has  no  bond  and  securities  markets.  The  Law  on \nGovernment Securities was promulgated by the King in January 2007 and the Law on Issuance \nand Trading of nongovernment securities was subsequently adopted by the National Assembly \nin  September  2007.  The  most  recent  short-term  government  securities  were  issued  in  2005. \nThe placement of government securities is jointly organized by NBC and the commercial banks. \nThe  Government  has  established  a  capital  market  unit  in  MEF,  and  in  April  2007  it  signed  a \nmemorandum of understanding with the stock exchange of the Korea International Cooperation \nAgency  for  $1.8  million  worth  of  technical  assistance  to  help  with  the  initial  training  and \npreparation for establishing a securities market in the near future. \n \n23. \nAccounting  and  Auditing  Infrastructure.  The  continuing  growth  of  the  commercial \nsector is creating significant challenges to improving the quality of accounting and auditing, as \nwell  as  to  producing  sufficient  numbers  of  qualified  accountants.  Cambodia  has  established  a \nlegal  and  regulatory  framework  for  accounting  and  auditing,  but  inconsistencies  between  the \nvarious  laws  and  regulations  remain.  Some  aspects  are  difficult  to  interpret,  and  there  is \nweakness in the overall framework. As of May 2008, 20 Cambodian accounting standards and \n10  Cambodian  auditing  standards  have  been  introduced  based  on  international  standards.  A \nstandards advisory body and a local institute of accountants have been established to oversee \nthis. \n \n24. \nThe  accounting  profession  is  in  its  infancy.  As  of  May  2008,  the  19  public  accounting \nand auditing firms employed 30 resident qualified accountants\u201410 of whom are locally qualified. \nCurrently  more  than  12,000  companies  are  registered,  and  the  rate  of  registration  is  growing. \nThe  public  accounting  firms  have  few,  if  any,  local  clients.  To  date  more  than  1,000  students \nhave enrolled in the local accounting qualification course, but approximately 40% of those have \neither  dropped  out  or  been  dismissed.  Seventeen  students,  including  those  not  employed  in \npublic accounting, are qualified certified public accountants, but the vast majority of students are \nexperiencing difficulties in completing the early stages of the course.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n45\n\n \n25. \nLegal  Infrastructure.  An  enabling  legal  framework  for  financial  and  commercial \ntransactions  could  be  achieved  by  continuing  support  for  Cambodia\u2019s  process  of  law  reform, \nincluding  for  the  adoption  and  implementation  of  core  financial  and  commercial  laws  that  are \nharmonized  and  aligned  with  the  legal  system.  The  law  reform  process  in  financial  and \ncommercial  areas  aims  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for  the  financial  sector  and  for \neconomic growth in general. The Government has taken important steps to prepare, adopt, and \nimplement  certain  major  laws.  The  second  stage  of  development  is  for  additions  and \nrefinements to be made to the legal framework. \n \n26. \nThe  process  for  enacting  a  new  law  is  subject  to  several  documented  steps.  In  a \ncommon situation, where an international legal expert has provided assistance and produced a \ndraft document in English, the translation into Khmer would take a minimum of 2\u20133 weeks. Then \nthe  process  of  internal  debate  and  consultation  is  held  within  the  ministry  responsible  for \nintroducing the new law. Following these steps, the procedures pertaining to passage of the law \nthrough  the  Council  of  Ministers  and  National  Assembly  are  usually  lengthy:  approval  by  the \nCouncil  of Ministers  typically  takes  at  least  6 months  (but  usually  longer),  and  the  process  for \nsubmission  to  the  National  Assembly  and  the  approval  process  within  the  Assembly  itself  are \nestimated to take approximately 1 year. Consequently, delay is always a risk at any given stage \nof the legislative process. \n \n27. \nThe current court process for the enforcement of collateral is seen as lengthy, uncertain, \nand  subject  to  delays  (including  for  the  appeals  process).  The  current  situation  calls  for  an \nurgent strengthening of Cambodia\u2019s dispute resolution system, as this is a critical element of the \nemerging financial and commercial legal framework. The introduction of commercial arbitration \nunder the new Law on Commercial Arbitration will be a key mechanism to consistently enforce \ncontracts and fairly resolve commercial disputes. A new commercial court law sponsored by the \nUnited  Nations  and  other  bilateral  development  partners,  still  in  the  planning  stages,  has  the \npotential to improve transparency and finality under clearly established court procedures. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nBanking and Formal Credit \n(including SME and judicial reforms) \n\nAsian Development Bank \n \nFinancial Sector Program I  \n\u2022  Budget: $30 million program \n\nloan \nTime frame: 2001\u20132007 \n\n\u2022 \n \nLegal and regulatory foundation for \nbanking, insurance, and commercial \ndevelopment; established \nsupervision and surveillance \nframework; foundation for developing \ninterbank and money markets; key \nfinancial market infrastructure.  \n \nFinancial Sector Program I \nimplementation \n\u2022  Budget: $500,000 TA grant \n\u2022 \nTime frame: 2005\u20132007 \n \nFinancial Sector Program II  \n\u2022  Budget: $40 million program \n\nloan \nTime frame: 2007\u20132010 \n\n\u2022 \n \nFinancial Sector Program II \nimplementation \n\u2022  Budget: $1.7 million TA grant \nTime frame: 2007\u20132009 \n\u2022 \n \nInternational Monetary Fund \n \nPoverty Reduction and Growth \nFacility \n\u2022  Budget: $81.6 million \n\u2022 \n \nMacroeconomic, structural, and \nsocial policies to foster growth and \nreduce poverty. \n \n\u2022 \n\nTime frame: 1999\u20132003 \n\n\u2022 \n\nLong-term resident adviser on \nbanking supervision at NBC. \nTechnical assistance to NBC on \nmonetary policy development, \nlegal framework for the \npayments system, and on-site \ninspection of selected banks \n\n \nAUSTRAC \n \nPublic awareness workshops and \ninitial preparatory work on anti-\nmoney laundering and prevention of \nfinancing of terrorism activities. \n \n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n \nCapital Markets, Corporate \nGovernance, and Public Financial \nManagement \n\nAsian Development Bank \n \nPreparing the Financial Sector \nProgram \n\u2022  Budget: $800,000 project \npreparatory TA grant \nTime frame: 2000\u20132007 \n\n\u2022 \n \nImproving Insurance Supervision \n\u2022  Budget: $400,000 TA grant \n\u2022 \nTime frame: 2002\u20132006 \n \nCapacity Building for Banking and \nFinancial Management \n\u2022  Budget: $1,000,000 TA grant \n(Government of France) \nTime frame: 2001\u20132005 \n\n\u2022 \n \nImproving Legal Infrastructure in the \nFinancial Sector \n\u2022  Budget: $800,000 TA grant \nTime frame: 2002\u20132006 \n\u2022 \n\nRural and Microfinance \n\nTime frame: 2000\u20132006 \n\nAsian Development Bank \n \nRural Credit and Savings Project  \n\u2022  Budget: $20 million project loan \n\u2022 \n \nCredit Facility to Promote Rural and \nMicrofinance Services \n \nDeveloping Deposit Services in Rural \nCambodia \n\u2022  Budget: $600,000 TA grant \nTime frame: 2005\u20132007 \n\u2022 \n\nGovernment of the Republic of \nKorea \n \nDevelopment of the Capital Market \n\u2022  Budget: $1,800,000 TA grant \nTime frame: 2006\u20132009 \n\u2022 \n \n\nTraining and initial preparation for \nthe establishment of a Cambodian \ncapital market. \n \nIFC/MPDF \n \nTechnical support to draft a sub-\ndecree on microinsurance. \n\nIFC/MPDF \n \nSupport the establishment of the \nCambodian Microfinance Association \nand its ongoing activities. \n \nPublic workshops to discuss good \ngovernance and best practices for \nmicrofinance institutions and the \ndevelopment of the national \narbitration center. \n\nADB, AusAID, CIDA, DFID, EC, \nIMF, JICA, SIDA, UNDP, World \nBank \n \nPublic Financial Management \nReform Program \n \n\nUnited Nations Development \nProgramme \n \nPublic awareness and annual \nsummit to promote microfinance \nactivities. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n47\n\nRural and Microfinance \n\nInclusive Financial Services Support \n(Project is under preparation.) \n\n \n\nCapital Markets, Corporate \nGovernance, and Public Financial \nManagement \n\nTime frame: 2005\u20132011 \n\nMulti-Donor Trust Fund \n\u2022  Budget: $14 million \n\u2022 \n \n \n \n\nTime frame: 2005\u20132007 \n\nAsian Development Bank \n \nStrengthening Debt Management \n\u2022  Budget: $600,000  \n\u2022 \n \nThe overall vision is to install much \nhigher standards of management \nand accountability in the mobilization \nof all government current and capital \nresources and to achieve greater \neffectiveness and efficiency in the \nuse of resources in their application \nto the Government\u2019s National \nPoverty Reduction Strategy and \nother priority programs.

By promoting the development \nof  a  sound,  market-based  financial  system  to  enhance  the  potential  for  economic  growth  and  the  creation  of \nemployment opportunities, FSP II will be pivotal in improving financial intermediation in Cambodia. A sound, efficient, \nand integrated financial system is crucial for achieving broad-based sustainable economic growth; it will help reduce \npoverty by increasing job opportunities, lowering transaction costs of economic activities, and extending the outreach \nof  the  formal  financial  sector  to  poor  and  rural  areas.  An  efficient  financial  system  will  promote  private  sector \ndevelopment  and  foreign  direct  investment.  Beneficiaries  are  expected  to  include  the  poor  and  near-poor.  A  robust \nfinancial  sector  will  protect  the  economy  from  unfavorable  exogenous  shocks  that  are  becoming  more  common  in \nincreasingly global financial markets and which have serious implications for the poor. \n \n \nB.

Implementation of the reforms will \nrequire technical inputs and targeted on-the-job support to equip the key government agencies \n(NBC,  MEF,  MOC)  with  the  required  knowledge  and  skills  to  ensure  that  the  results  of  the \nreforms will be sustained even after the second Financial Sector Program Cluster (FSP II). \n\n \n2. \n \n\nThe components of the TA are as follow: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nStrengthen  bank  supervision  and  surveillance.  Strengthen  the  on-site \nsupervision capacity of the bank regulator in tandem with anti-money laundering \n(AML)  and  combating  the  financing  of  terrorism  (CFT)  implementation,  and \ndevelop remedial measures to address emerging problems with high-risk banks. \nAssist NBC to evaluate progress of capacity building for banking supervision and \ndetermine  the  nature  of  further  capacity  support,  as  well  as  to  help  assess  the \nfeasibility of rating major banks. \nStrengthen supervision of microfinance institutions (MFIs) with appropriate \nregulations.  Improve  the  prudential  regulations  for  MFIs  and  strengthen  the \ncapacity of the regulator within NBC to implement those regulations through both \noff-site  and  on-site  supervisions.  Assist  NBC  to  develop  a  code  of  conduct  for \nregistered moneychangers. \nUpdating regulations and strengthen supervision of the insurance industry. \nAssist the MEF in revising the insurance law and its submission to the Council of \nMinisters,  implementing  the  new  standard  on  accounting  for  insurance  firms, \nupdating  regulations,  and  strengthening  staff  capacity  to  supervise  and  enforce \nthose regulations. \n\n \nMethodology and Key Activities \n\nB. \n\n3. \nThe TA consultants will provide expertise in the following: (i) on-site supervision of banks \nand training (4 person-months), (ii) supervision of MFIs (3 person-months), and (iii) regulations \nand  supervision  of  the  insurance  industry  (4  person-months).  One  national  consultant  will  be \nengaged, an insurance expert (6 person-months), to assist the international insurance expert.  \n \nC. \n\nCost and Financing \n\n4. \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  a  total  of  $375,000  equivalent  of  which  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will provide $300,000 on a grant basis from its TA funding program. \nThe  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  $75,000  equivalent  in  the  form  of  office  space, \ncounterpart staff, and other support facilities (Table A7). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nTable A7: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \nItem \nA.
