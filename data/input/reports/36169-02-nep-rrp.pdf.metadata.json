The report \nalso  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  Nepal  for  Capacity  Building  for  Rural \nFinance Sector Development, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. In this report, RFSDCP \ndenotes  the  cluster  program  comprising  subprograms  1  and  2.  Subprogram  1  refers  to  the \nsubprogram implemented in 2006\u20132009. Subprogram 2, to be implemented in 2010\u20132012, will \nconsist  of  the  loan  and  the  grant  project  described  in  this  report.  The  design,  implementation \nmodality,  and  other  aspects  covered  in  this  report  refer  to  subprogram  2,  unless  specified \notherwise.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT CLUSTER PROGRAM \n\n \nA. \n\nRationale  \n\n2. \nNepal is in reconciliation, rehabilitation, and reconstruction after its decade-long conflict. \nAs peace has set in, the macroeconomic environment has also turned positive and, in 2008, the \ngross  domestic  product  grew  by  4.7%.  Nepal  has  also  substantially  reduced  the  incidence  of \npoverty, from 42% in 1996 to 31% in 2004. But severe poverty persists in various parts of the \ncountry  and  economic  growth  is  uneven.  Poverty  in  Nepal  is  largely  a  rural  phenomenon  and \nrural poverty is closely associated with limited access to social and economic infrastructure such \nas roads, energy, markets, and finance.  \n \n3. \nDespite the recent rapid growth of the financial sector, just 30% of Nepalese households \nhave an account with or a loan from formal or semiformal financial institutions,2 and 70% have \nno access to institutional finance but rely only on informal sources3 of finance or are financially \nexcluded.  The  percentage  of  financially  excluded  households  are  higher  in  the  hills  and \nmountain areas (80% of the households) and among the poorest households (75%). Exclusive \nreliance on informal lending is more common in the Western region (77%). Unequal access to \nformal financial services is a critical economic  constraint, especially given the relatively higher \ninterest rates charged in the informal sector.4  \n \n4. \nThe  limited  access  to  finance  in  Nepal  is  largely  due  to  (i) excessive  government \ninvolvement  and  distortional  policies,  (ii) poor  governance  and  the  limited  outreach  of  public \nrural finance institutions (RFIs),5 (iii) the limited scale and capacity of semiformal RFIs, (iv) the \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Sector \nDevelopment Program Cluster of Loans, Asian Development Fund Grant, and Technical Assistance Grant to Nepal \nfor the Rural Finance Sector Development Cluster Program. Manila.  \n\n2  Formal  financial  institutions  are  licensed  and  regulated  by  the  Nepal  Rastra  Bank  (NRB),  the  central  bank. \nSemiformal  institutions  are  registered  under  various  acts,  such  as  the  Cooperative  Act  (1992)  and  the  Societies \nRegistration Act (1977) but are not licensed or regulated by NRB.  \n\n3  Main sources of informal lending are families, relatives, friends, and moneylenders. \n4  Asian  Development  Bank,  World  Bank,  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  and \nInternational Labor Organization. 2009. Country Diagnostic Studies\u2014Nepal: Critical Development Constraints. \n5  Rural finance is defined as financial intermediation in the rural sector and is a subset of the broader finance sector. \nThis  report  defines  RFIs  as  financial  intermediaries,  formal  and  semiformal,  that  serve  the  rural  areas.  Even \ncommercial banks with head offices in the urban areas are considered RFIs if they serve rural clients. Microfinance \ninstitutions are financial intermediaries that mainly provide non-collateral loans below NRs150,000. Because of the \nhigh  concentration  of  the  poor  and  low-income  households  in  the  rural  areas,  most  microfinance  institutions \noperate in the rural areas and are categorized as RFIs. This report, however, refers to microfinance institutions to \ndistinguish financial intermediation for small borrowers from other forms of lending. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nlack  of  appropriate  laws  and  regulations  for  the  supervision  of  RFIs,  (v) insufficient  support \ninfrastructure for rural finance, and (vi) the inaccessibility of the hills and mountain areas.  \n \n5. \nAt the core of the problems in the rural finance sector in Nepal is the omnipresence of \nthe  government  in  RFI  ownership  and  management.  Public  institutions  dominate  the  rural \nfinance  sector,  and  the  outreach  of  the  three  key  public  RFIs\u2014the  Agricultural  Development \nBank Limited (ADBL), the Small Farmers Development Bank (SFDB), and the Grameen Bikash \nBanks (GBBs)\u2014is estimated to account for more than 60% of the total outreach of formal and \nsemiformal  rural  finance.  Despite  their  extensive  rural  network,  however,  these  public \ninstitutions have not made the most of their outreach potential because of weak governance and \nmanagement,  limited  staff  skills,  and  scant  attention  to  profitability  and  sustainability.  To \nimprove access to finance the government has (i) directed banks to set aside 3% of their total \nloan portfolio for low-income households and small businesses (the so-called \u201cdeprived sector \nlending  scheme\u201d),  and  (ii) created  special  microfinance  windows  and  programs.  But  most \ngovernment-sponsored  microfinance  programs  have  performed  poorly  and  have  limited \noutreach.  The  government\u2019s  \"deprived  sector  lending  scheme\"  has  also  weakened  market \nincentives  by  discouraging  microfinance  institutions  from  expanding  their  outreach  through \nefficiency improvements and innovation.  \n \n6. \nSemiformal  RFIs  such  as  microfinance  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and \nsavings  and  credit  cooperatives  are  expected  to  fill  the  gap.  But  semiformal  RFIs  also  suffer \nfrom weak capacity, limited scale of operations, and insufficient skills to be viable and provide \noutreach.  Most  lack  suitable  accounting,  reporting,  and  management  information  systems \n(MISs).  In  the  absence  of  regulatory  requirements  for  accountability  and  transparency,  RFIs \nhave not been able to improve their accounting and internal controls and boost their operating \ncapacity.  There  are  no  regulations  specific  to  semiformal  RFIs.  Formal  RFIs,  licensed  and \nregulated by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank, make up only a small portion of \nrural  finance  intermediaries  in  number.  An  estimated  2,300  cooperatives  and  15,000 \nmicrofinance NGOs provide financial intermediation and take deposits without license. The poor \nsupervision  of  these  institutions  does  not  bode  well  for  the  security  of  depositors  and  the \nstability of the rural finance sector.  \n \n7. \nThe  rural  finance  sector  needs  support  infrastructure  such  as  a  Credit  Information \nBureau (CIB) and a Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) to grow. The CIB that was created in 2005 \nserves mainly commercial banks. The service must be extended to more RFIs to improve their \nrisk mitigation and the governance of the rural finance sector. A three-member DRT was formed \nto make debt recovery decisions for financial institutions, but its low capacity has delayed loan \nrecovery. This burden on RFIs lowers the credibility of the rural finance sector.   \n \n8. \nThe topography of the hills and mountains hampers the organization of group members \nand raises the transaction cost of microcredit beyond the cost in the terai (plain areas). Savings \nand credit cooperatives, managed by their own members, are considered more suitable for the \nhills and mountains. But they are hard put to mobilize resources, expand credit, and improve the \nefficiency of microfinance operations. The Grameen-type group-based microcredit model,6 while \neffective  in  the  terai  region,  is  difficult  to  implement  in  the  hills  and  mountains,  where \nhouseholds  are  sparsely  located,  and  roads  and  communication  networks  are  scarce.  More \nappropriate approaches need to be developed for those areas through pilot initiatives.  \n \n9. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development \nCluster Program and its subprogram 1 on 26 October 2006 to develop an enabling environment \nfor  the  rural  finance  sector  through  policy,  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reforms. \n\n                                                 \n6  In  the  Grameen  microcredit  model,  started  by  the  Grameen  Bank  in  Bangladesh,  women  form  themselves  into \n\ngroups of 5\u201320 members each and borrow on the basis of a group guarantee.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nSubprogram 1,  which  was  completed  in  December  2009,  achieved  successful  policy  and \ninstitutional reforms.7 According to the progress report for the release of the second tranche of \nthe loan for subprogram 1, 14 of 19 conditions were fully complied with, one was substantially \ncomplied  with,  and  four  were  partially  complied  with.8    The  partial  compliance  was  due  to  the \ndelay  in  the  passage  of  supporting  laws  and  regulations,  and  in  product  and  process \ninnovations,  caused  mainly  by  the  low  implementation  capacity  of  NRB,  the  implementing \nagency  for  the  component.  Qualified  consultants  were  subsequently  fielded  to  assist  NRB \nduring subprogram 1. Currently, of the four partially complied conditions, two are fully complied \nwith.  The  condition  relating  to  pilot-testing  a  crop  insurance  program  for  small  and  marginal \nfarmers has been removed from subprogram 2. This made little progress under subprogram 1 \nbecause of the technical complexity of the scheme and the lack of institutions that could capably \npilot-test  it.  The  removal  of  the  component  will  not  affect  the  expected  outcome  of  the  cluster \nprogram. The remaining condition relating to approval of draft Microfinance Act has been carried \nto subprogram 2. The two tranches of the loan for subprogram 1, totaling $56 million, were fully \ndisbursed.  \n \n10. \nSubprogram  2,  the  second  phase  of  RFSDCP,  will  complete  the  rural  finance  sector \nreform  agenda.  It  is  consistent  with  the  strategic  focus  of  the  country  partnership  strategy  for \nNepal  (2010\u20132012)  on  making  financial  services  more  accessible  to  the  poor  and  the  rural \nareas.9  The  RFSDCP  supports  the  government\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Reform  Program  in \ncoordination with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.10  \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe impact of the RFSDCP will be economic growth and poverty reduction in rural areas \nthrough  improved  rural  financial  intermediation  and  easier  access  to  affordable  rural  finance \nservices,  with  special  attention  to  marginalized  groups  and  women.11  The  outcome  will  be  an \ninclusive rural finance system that is more sound and efficient, and has wider outreach. As the last \nsubprogram of RFSDCP, subprogram 2 will develop a sound rural finance sector environment that \nis conducive to the expansion of rural finance outreach. The policy and institutional reform actions \nunder  subprogram  2  will  (i) transform  key  RFIs  into  viable  rural  finance  intermediaries  with  a \nstrong client orientation and pro-poor focus, and (ii) improve the efficiency and widen the outreach \nof semiformal RFIs.12 \n \nC. \n \n12. \nsubprogram 1.13 \n \n\nSubprogram  2  will  continue  the  policy  and  institutional  reform  actions  begun  under \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs  \n\n                                                 \n7  The impact of ADB\u2019s assistance through subprogram 1, according to the country assistance program evaluation for \nNepal (2009), is \u201clikely [to be] substantial. RFSDCP helped reinstate ADBL as a strong financial institution focused \non agricultural and rural development, [and] improved [the] delivery mechanism for rural finance. The institutional \ndevelopment  of  the  major  rural  finance  institutions  is  expected  to  result  in  a  credit  environment  with  improved \nsupervision  and  regulation.  The  institutions  are  moving  [toward]  eventual  privatization.\u201d  ADB.  2009.  Country \nAssistance Program Evaluation: Nepal\u2014Delivering Assistance in a Challenging Environment.

The process of establishing a legislative \nact and a regulatory authority\u2014the second-tier institution (STI)\u2014to supervise RFIs, which was \nset  in  motion  under  subprogram  1,  will  continue.  Key  component  outputs  will  be  (i) the \ndevelopment  of  a  legal  framework  for  RFI  supervision  and  regulation,  the  Micro  Finance  Act; \n(ii) the establishment of the STI; and (iii) information dissemination and the start of RFI licensing \nand  regulation.  The  Government  will  also  review  and  update  its  Micro  Finance  Policy  (2008). \nThe  STI  is  envisaged  to  be  an  autonomous  regulatory  body  governed  by  a  board  of  directors \nrepresenting  the  government,  NRB,  and  the  private  sector.  For  this  initiative,  the  grant  project \nwill  finance  consultant  experts  at  NRB  to  (i) draft  regulations,  operating  manuals,  and \nprocedures for the STI; (ii) set up and start operating the STI; and (iii) disseminate information to \nRFIs and train them. An MIS will also be developed for the STI as part of the grant project. \n \n14. \nInstitutional  restructuring  and  reforms:\u00a0 Agricultural  Development  Bank  Limited. \nTransforming ADBL, the country\u2019s largest commercial bank, into a viable and effective financial \nintermediary  is  a  key  objective  of  RFSDCP.  The  ADBL  restructuring  under  subprogram  1 \ninvolved voluntary retirement, the divestment of 15% of the government\u2019s shareholding in ADBL \nto  small  shareholders,14  and  the  launch  of  the  initial  public  offering,  along  with  organizational \nand operational restructuring. An international consultant who served as chief technical adviser \nand national consultants assisted in the restructuring.  \n \n15. \nKey outputs of subprogram 2 will be the implementation of (i) the capital restructuring of \nADBL,  and  (ii)  the  second  phase  of  the  ADBL  institutional  restructuring.  A  private  strategic \ninvestor  will  buy  into  ADBL  to  provide  the  leadership  needed  to  modernize  the  financial \ninstitution and make it more competitive. The government\u2019s ordinary shareholding at ADBL will \nalso  be  reduced  to  21%  by  July  2011,  in  the  first  major  financial  privatization  in  Nepal.  Along \nwith  the  capital  restructuring,  comprehensive  improvements  will  be  made  in  governance, \ntransparency,  organization,  marketing,  human  resources,  business  management,  portfolio \nmanagement,  MIS,  compliance,  treasury,  and  internal  audit  in  the  second  phase  of  the  ADBL \ninstitutional restructuring. Consultants will assist ADBL management and staff in carrying out the \nrestructuring.  The  MIS  will  also  be  expanded  and  strengthened  to  enable  ADBL  to  offer \ntechnology-based financial services.15  \n \n16. \nInstitutional  restructuring  and  reforms:\u00a0 Small  Farmers  Development  Bank.  The \nADBL  restructuring  will  be  complemented  by  institutional  reform  of  SFDB,  an  apex  bank  for \nsmall  farmer  cooperatives  with  a  strong  grassroots  orientation.  The  SFDB  reform  will  deepen \nrural  finance  outreach  and  make  financial  services  more  inclusive,  especially  to  women.  The \nSFDB  restructuring  plan  will  be  updated  and  implemented.  The  board  of  directors  will  be \nreconstituted,  the  management  professionalized,  a  portfolio  audit  carried  out,  the  bank \nreorganized,  internal  controls  improved,  an  MIS  installed,  and  private  capital  increased.  An \ninternational microfinance institution  development specialist  and national experts  will help SFDB \nimplement  the  plan  under  the  grant  project.  The  development  of  MIS  for  SFDB  and  SFDB \nmember cooperatives will also receive consultant support.16  \n \n17. \nStrategies in the SFDB restructuring plan for expanding microfinance services in the hills \nand  mountain  areas  involve  (i) mapping  cooperatives,  self-help  groups,17  and  microfinance \nNGOs;  (ii) assessing  and  rating  institutions;  (iii) designing  a  TA  project  and  building  capacity; \n\n                                                 \n14 The Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal Act (1967) requires a person borrowing more than NRs10,000 from \nADBL  to  \u201chave  purchased  at  least  one  share  of  ADBL  (small  shareholders).\u201d  Small  shareholders  could  be  small \nfarmers, a group of small farmers, a village committee or cooperative institution. \n15 Agricultural Development Bank Limited Capital Restructuring Plan (Appendix 2). \n16 Summary Small Farmers Development Bank Second Phase Restructuring Plan (Appendix 2). \n17 Self-help  groups  are  village-based  financial  intermediaries,  usually  composed  of  10\u201315  local  women,  which  are \n\nlargely unregistered and carry out voluntary savings and credit activities. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nand  (iv)  providing  onlending  support  for  outreach  expansion.  SFDB  intends  to  make  credit \naccessible to 20,000 more marginal farmers in the hills and mountain areas by 2012.18  \n\n \n18. \nInstitutional restructuring and reforms:\u00a0Grameen Bikash Bank. Subprogram 2 looks \nforward to the successful privatization of the Far Western GBB19 and its transformation, with full \ntechnical  advisory  and  capacity  development  support,  into  an  effective  grassroots  financial \nintermediary.  \n \n19. \nSector  capacity  building.  The  RFSDCP  advocates  the  establishment  of  a  banking \ntraining institute to develop sector capacity. The National Banking Training Institute (NBTI), set \nup under subprogram 1, will continue to be assisted in raising professional standards throughout \nthe financial sector including rural and microfinance. An output under subprogram 2 will be the \nstart of professional training for a wide range of financial institutions. NBTI will hold short-term \ntraining,  first  in  Kathmandu  and  later  in  other  regions,  and  eventually  long-term  diploma  and \ndegree  programs.  Under  the  grant  project,  consultant experts will  (i) develop  training  curricula, \n(ii) assess the training needs of financial institutions, (iii) conduct classroom and off-site training, \n(iv) design  in-house  training  programs  for  RFIs,  and  (v) arrange  financial  literacy  training  for \nrural communities. The project will also support the marketing, information dissemination, staff \ntraining, and other initial operating costs of NBTI. \n\n \n20. \nEnabling infrastructure for rural finance. Subprogram 2 will fund the development of \nthe  CIB\u2019s  credit  information  services  to  class  D  institutions  (micro-credit  development  banks, \nmicrofinance  NGOs  and  savings  and  credit  cooperatives).  CIB  will  begin  providing  credit \ninformation  services  to  class D  institutions  and  expand  its  client  database  from  the  present \n40,000 to 2 million, including small borrowers. An MIS will be developed at CIB under the grant \nproject  to  meet  its  larger  data  needs.  The  DRT,  on  the  other  hand,  will  undergo  capacity \ndevelopment  to  speed  up  debt  recovery  and  make  it  less  costly.  DRT  staff  will  improve  their \nskills in legal and financial management and office automation. DRT will also be given specialist \nassistance in legal, financial, and MIS aspects to strengthen its operating capacity. \n \n21. \nProject  management  support.  Project  management  and  coordination  assistance  will \ncome  from  a  rural  finance  specialist  at  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF).  The  grant  project  will \nfinance  the  services  of  a  consultant  rural  finance  specialist  for  program  implementation  and  the \ncapacity development needs of the program management unit of MOF.  \n \nD. \n \nThe  overall  adjustment  cost  of  the  ADBL  restructuring  is  estimated  at  $145  million, \n22. \ncovered  as  follows:  (i)   $65 million  from  the  government\u2019s  loan  to  ADBL  converted  into \npreference shares, (ii) further $65 million in performance-linked equity in the form of preference \nshares  from  the  government  to  ADBL,  and  (iii) $15 million  equivalent  in  ADBL  staff  size \nreduction  through  voluntary  retirement.  The  government  injected  preference  shares  to \nrecapitalize ADBL and improve its capital adequacy ratio to the statutory level set by NRB. The \nRFSDCP  cluster  at  the  time  of  subprogram  1  approval  amounted  to  $91  million  comprising  a \n$56  million  loan  for  subprogram  1  and  a  $35  million  loan  for  subprogram  2.  The  government \nused  the  entire  loan  proceeds  under  subprogram  1  to  recapitalize  ADBL  through  cash \nsubscriptions of additional preference shares equivalent to NRs3.9 billion. \n \n23. \nto \nSDR39,290,000 ($60.4 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \n\nin  various  currencies  equivalent \n\nProgram Costs and Financing  \n\nThe  government  has \n\nrequested  a \n\nloan \n\n                                                 \n18 Summary Strategies for Expanding Microfinance Services in Hills and Mountains (Appendix 2). \n19 GBBs started by replicating the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. There are now five GBBs, one each for the Eastern, \n\nFar-Western, Central, Mid-Western, and Western regions. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nthe  adjustment  cost  of  subprogram  2.  The  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and program \nagreement.  The  loan  will  be  released  in  two  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $30  million  will  be \nreleased  at  loan  effectiveness  and  the  second  tranche  of  $30.4  million  will  be  released  24 \nmonths  after  the  release  of  the  first  tranche.  The  release  of  the  first  tranche  is  subject  to  the \ncompliance of 16 conditions as specified in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). Of 16 conditions, 14 \nwere fully complied. The two conditions: (i) the approval of the ADBL Capital Restructuring Plan, \nand (ii) endorsement of the SFDB Restructuring Plan by the Ministry of Finance and ADBL are \nin the process of being complied with. \n \n24. \nThe total amount for the RFSDCP cluster has been increased by $25.4 million to $116.4 \nmillion, reflecting the increase in local cost requirements, particularly for the establishment of the \nlegal  and  regulatory  framework  for  RFI  supervision,  the  further  divestment  of  ADBL,  and  the \nstrengthening of rural finance outreach. More resources are needed for the expansion of rural \nfinance  outreach  in  the  post-conflict  period.  The  counterpart  funds  will  finance  the  structural \nadjustment  costs  of  the  government  and  the  program  implementing  agencies  relating  to  the \nimplementation of reforms under subprogram 2. \n \n25. \nGrant project financing plan. The grant project will cost about $14.2 million (Table 1). \nThe government has requested a grant not exceeding $12.1 million from ADB's Special Funds \nresources to help finance the project. The financing plan is in Table 2. The grant proceeds will \nfinance  equipment,  international  and  national  consulting  services,  training,  a  credit  line, \nmanagement  support,  and  taxes  and  duties.  Although  some  implementing  agencies  are \noperating  on  a  commercial  basis,  grant  financing  will  be  provided  under  the  project  for  the \nexpansion  of  rural  finance  outreach  because  existing  institutions  will  not  normally  undertake \nsuch  financial  inclusion  activities  nor  attempt  rural  financial  deepening  for  lack  of  economic \nincentives.20  For  example,  many  rural  areas  of  Nepal  are  remote  and  hence  tend  to  be  by-\npassed by financial institutions. Government and counterpart contributions will be mostly in kind \nand will cover counterpart staff salaries, office expenses, training, local travel, and other costs.21  \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nShare (%) \n\n1.

There has nonetheless \nbeen progress toward the transparent and accountable management of public finances.24 All the \nformal  financial  institutions  in  Nepal  are  supervised  by  NRB  and  undergo  rigorous  inspection \nwith various financial reporting requirements. NRB\u2019s supervisory capacity has improved over the \nyears  under \nIn  addition,  under \nsubprogram 2,  risks  in  public  fiscal  management  will  be  controlled  through  records  and \naccounts maintained by the government and the program implementing agencies in accordance \nwith sound accounting principles. \n \nB. \n \n29. \n In recent years, the government has taken a number of initiatives to address corruption, \nincluding the Promoting Market Competition Act (2006); Right to Information Act (2007); Special \nCourt  Act  (2002;  amended  in  2007);  and  Anti-Money  Laundering  Act  (2008).  The  government \nhas  also  passed  the  Public  Procurement  Act  (2007)  and  the  Public  Procurement  Regulations \n(2007),  both  generally  acceptable  to  ADB  and  encompassing  best  international  procurement \npractices.  The  government  has  also  established  a  \u201cprocurement  watchdog\u201d  in  the  form  of  the \nPublic  Procurement  Monitoring  Office  under  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  Council  of \nMinisters.  Furthermore,  it  has  established  the  National  Vigilance  Centre  under  the  direct \nsupervision  and  control  of  the  Prime  Minister  to  control  corruptions  through  preventive  and \npromotional  measures.  RFSDCP  is  designed  to  reduce  vulnerability  to  corruption  by  ensuring \nthat  (i)  the  boards  of  financial  institutions  can  monitor  corruption  and  mismanagement  in  their \nown  institutions,  and  take  action  against  these  problems;  (ii)  all  relevant  institutions  take \nadequate  steps  to  improve  corporate  governance;  (iii)  all  relevant  institutions  and  the \ngovernment give assurances that they will abide by the transparency and disclosure stipulations \nof  the  NRB;  and  (iv)  rigorous  monitoring  mechanisms  are  put  in  place  to  ensure  continuous, \nproper accountabilities of mandated actions and full funds flow management. \n \nC. \n \n30. \nThe  institutional  restructuring  and  reform  of  RFIs  will  strongly  emphasize  inclusiveness \nwhile  improving  operational  and  financial  efficiency.  Further,  the  support  for  SFDB  will  include \nextending access to financial services to the most remote areas. The financial and performance \nmonitoring of the institutional restructuring and reforms will cover outreach to marginalized groups \nand women.25  \n \nD. \n \n31. \nAdverse  impact  from  policy  and  institutional  reform  actions  on  the  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlements, and indigenous peoples is unlikely. The safeguard classification is C. \nThe  environmental  implication  of  the  SFDB  restructuring  for  financial  intermediation  was \n                                                 \n23 Agricultural Development Bank Limited Capital Restructuring Plan (Appendix 2). \n24 Government  of  Nepal.  2008.

Because  of  the  micro scale  of  the  investment  activities  of  sub-borrowers,  adverse \nenvironmental impact is unlikely.  \n \nE. \n \n32.  With  the  appropriate  mitigation  measures  in  place,  the  overall  risk  of  subprogram  2  is \nlow. Key risks and mitigation measures are summarized in Table 4.26  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\n \nRisks \nProcurement. The government\u2019s limited \ncapacity and knowledge of ADB\u2019s \nprocurement process may delay procurement. \n\nTechnical. The reform and restructuring of \nfinancial institutions involves complex \ntechnical tasks. The staff of the participating \nfinancial institutions may not have the \nnecessary technical capacity to turn the \ninstitutions into modern financial institutions. \n\nLabor union. Unions in the participating \nfinancial institutions may oppose the \nproposed restructuring. \n\nEconomic. The recent international economic \ncrisis may slow down the financial sector \nreform in Nepal. \n\nManagement Plan \nA  national  consultant  to  the  project  coordinator  who  is  familiar  with \nADB\u2019s  procurement  guidelines  will  be  placed  at  the  executing \nagency  to  guide  and  supervise  the  procurement.  Program  staff  will \nalso be given intensive training in implementation.  \n\nthe  participating \n\nStaff  of \ninstitutions  will  be  given \nfinancial \ncomprehensive training in banking and financial subjects to meet the \nchanging needs of the sector. In addition, a qualified chief technical \nadviser (international consultant) will lead and advise on all facets of \nthe restructuring.  \n\nDuring  the  preparation  of  subprogram  2,  the  ADBL  management \nand  the  consultant  team  conducted  extensive  and  continuous \nconsultations with the unions, As a result, the second phase of the \nADBL restructuring has their general support. Ongoing consultations \nand  discussions  with  the  unions  will  be  conducted  during  the \nrestructuring. \n\nBecause of limited exposure to foreign investments and international \ncapital  markets,  Nepal  has  been  largely  isolated  from  the  recent \ncrisis. It has made consistent progress in financial sector reform and \nthe probability of sustained financial sector reform is high.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADBL = Agricultural Development Bank Limited. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n33. \nADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the \nAnticorruption  Policy  relating  to  subprogram  2.
