This  approval  includes  provision  of  loans  to  Bank  Eskhata  and \nInecobank, with pricing to be determined based on the procedures applicable to ADB\u2019s private \nsector operations and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board.  \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\n \nA. \n\nBackground \n\n2. \nDefining  Micro  and  Small  Enterprise  Finance.  Micro-  and  small  enterprise  finance \nconsists  of  a  broad  range  of  funding  modalities  and  options.  According  to  the  Consultative \nGroup to Assist the Poor (CGAP),1 an MFI is an organization that provides financial services to \na  clientele  poorer  and  more  vulnerable  than  traditional  bank  clients;  within  this  definition, \nhowever,  the  diversity  of  organizations  is  immense.  Ownership  structures  of  MFIs  include \ngovernment-owned institutions such as (i) the rural credit cooperatives in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China; (ii) member-owned organizations like the credit unions in West Africa; (iii) institutions \nowned  by  socially  minded  shareholders,  such  as  the  many  transformed  nongovernment \norganizations  in  Latin  America;  and  (iv)  institutions  owned  by  profit-maximizing  shareholders, \nsuch as the microfinance banks in Eastern Europe.  \n \n3. \nThe  focus  of  MFIs  also  varies;  while  the  focus  of  some  institutions  is  the  provision  of \nfinancial  services  exclusively  to  the  poor,  others  offer  a  wide  range  of  financial  services  for \nmultiple markets. Some MFIs focus narrowly on traditional microcredit (i.e., microloans without \ncollateral, delivered through a range of group-based and individual methodologies) while other \nMFIs offer a range of services including savings, insurance, and remittances.2 Within this same \nfield of microfinance fall MFIs like the Grameen Bank, which serves poor women with tiny loans, \nand the ProCredit banks, with a commercial approach to providing micro- and small businesses \nwith loans of thousands of dollars.  \n \n4. \nWhen one expands the spectrum to encompass not only microfinancing but also small-\nenterprise financing, the field of funding organizations grows larger still. Even the definition of a \nsmall  enterprise  is  open  to  debate,  and  most  countries  establish  their  own  definitions.  The \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), for example, defines microloans \noffered through its small and medium enterprise facility for the European Union as loans of up to \na  maximum  of  \u20ac30,000  (approximately  $40,000),  and  a  small  loan  as  between  \u20ac30,000  and \n\u20ac125,000  (approximately  $170,000).  In  their  micro-  and  small-enterprise  lending  programs,  a \nmicroloan is a loan of up to $10,000 and a small loan can go up to $200,000. Sub-borrowers are \nin  turn  defined  in  terms  of  size,  either  by  number  of  employees,  value  of  assets,  or  the \ncompany\u2019s  turnover.  The  European  Union  small  and  medium  enterprise  definition  delineates \n\n                                                 \n1 The CGAP is a consortium of 33 public and private development agencies (including ADB as a consortium member \nand donor) that  work together to expand  access to financial services for the poor in developing countries. CGAP \nwas created by these agencies to help create permanent financial services for the poor on a large scale. CGAP is a \nresource  center  for  the  microfinance  industry,  where  it  incubates  and  supports  new  ideas,  innovative  products, \ncutting-edge  technology,  novel  mechanisms  for  delivering  financial  services,  and  concrete  solutions  to  the \nchallenges of expanding microfinance. Available: http://www.cgap.org. \n\n2  Available: http://www.cgap.org/portal/site/CGAP/menuitem.5cb3955e9924016067808010591010a0/ \n\n\f 2 \n \n\nmicroenterprises  as  companies  with  up  to  nine  employees,  and  small  enterprises  as  having  \n10\u201349 employees.3 The institutions that provide small-enterprise financing (which one can refer \nto as small-business banks) are as varied in legal structure, mission, and lending methodology \nas their microfinancing peers.  \n \n5. \nNeed  for  Funding  in  the  Micro-  and  Small  Enterprise  Financing  Sector.  This \nprofusion of types of MFIs and small-business banks, however, has two things in common. The \nfirst  is,  simply,  a  commitment  to  financing  micro-  and  small  enterprises,  however  those  are \ndefined in any given country. The second is an often endemic difficulty in accessing financing \nfrom commercial lenders. Equity funds investing in microfinance and small-business banks are \nincreasingly appearing on the landscape of micro- and small enterprise financing, and this is a \nwelcome  development.  However,  although  infusions  of  equity  are  beneficial  for  MFIs,  CGAP \nstates that MFIs often already have high levels of equity capital relative to debt, and therefore \nhave greater interest in increasing liabilities rather than in raising new equity.  \n \n6. \nAlthough  this  is  the  case  for  both  MFIs  and  small-business  banks,  MFIs  are  often \nparticularly  challenged  in  this  regard.  Unlike  small  banks,  MFIs  are  often  purely  lending \ninstitutions  and  either  do  not  take  deposits  or  do  not  take  them  until  rather  late  in  their \ninstitutional lives, thus making access to debt financing crucial to growth. (Some MFIs, including \nthose  registered  as  nongovernment  organizations,  do  not  have  legal  authorization  to  mobilize \ndeposits and as such are compelled to rely solely on debt financing to fund expansion.)  \n \n7. \nThe result of these issues in accessing debt financing is demonstrated by the fact that, \nalthough  most  countries  allow  such  institutions  to  maintain  debt-equity  ratios  of  8x,  10x,  or \nhigher, most regulated MFIs have lower (often much lower) levels of leverage.  \n \n8. \nThe  MFIs  seeking  loans  and  partial  credit  guarantees  (PCGs)  through  the  MFI  Facility \nare,  for  the  most  part,  highly  constrained  in  this  regard.  This  includes  (as  will  be  discussed \nfurther) Bank Eskhata and Inecobank.  \n \n9. \nCommercial  Lenders  Reluctant  to  Provide  Debt  Financing  to  MFIs  and  Small-\nBusiness  Banks.  Commercial  lenders  are  reluctant  to  provide  loans  to  MFIs  and  small-\nbusiness banks for a variety of reasons. The following reasons apply to MFIs. \n \n\nMany institutions lack operational and accounting transparency, which are key to \nencouraging large, sophisticated institutions to seriously consider lending.  \n\nLenders  often  perceive  risks\u2014political,  macroeconomic,  contract,  collateral, \nsupervision, management, competition, and currency\u2014to be high in environments \n(such  as  various  frontier  economies)  where  MFIs  and  small-business  banks \noperate, and foreign sources of capital may not be inclined to expend the money \nand effort to discern the security of lending.  \n\n(iii) \n\nExisting laws and regulations can make it difficult for MFIs to borrow or transform \ninto other legal forms that can borrow more easily.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3   Available:  http://www.ebrd.com/about/policies/sector/msme.pdf.  Micro,  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises \n\nStrategy, as approved by the EBRD Board of Directors at its meeting on 7 February 2006. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)  Certain  donor  practices  work  against  enhancing  the  creditworthiness  of  MFIs, \n\nmaking it harder for them to secure commercial financing.4  \n\nSmall-business  banks  face  a  similar,  although  not  identical,  set  of  constraints  to  those \n\n \n10. \nfaced by MFIs in attracting debt in the form of loans from commercial lenders. \n \n\nAlthough  frequently  more  transparent  from  the  standpoint  of  operations  and \ntransparency \nthan  MFIs,  small-business  banks  are  often  equipped  with \nsubstandard information technology and management information systems, which \nhave difficulty producing the sophistication of reporting on issues like portfolio-at-\nrisk and liquidity management, which would give confidence to foreign investors.  \n\nPerceived  risks  are  still  substantial  in  many  frontier  countries,  even  when  the \ninstitution in question is a small bank rather than an MFI.  \n\nIn  many  countries,  particularly  the  more  frontier  DMCs,  there  is  effectively  no \ninterbank  lending  market,  and  banks  (especially  those  operating  in  very  small \nbanking  systems)  view  one  another  as  competitors  rather  than  as  reciprocal \nproviders of liquidity.  \n\n \nADB  to  Help  Address  the  Debt  Financing  Gap  to  MFIs.  Given  this  need  for,  and \n11. \nconstraint to, debt financing of MFIs and small-business banks, ADB has developed the concept \nof  a  loan  facility  that  will  be  flexible  enough  to  serve  multiple  MFIs  and  small-business  banks \nwith the relatively small amounts of debt that they require. This facility structure thus diversifies \nrisks  across  a  sizeable  portfolio  of  institutions  and  countries  (described  further  below),  to  be \nselected  based  on  strict  due-diligence  criteria.  Financing  will  be  provided  in  the  form  of  both \nloans  and  PCGs,  and  may  be  extended  in  both  hard  and  local  currencies,  based  on  the \nrequirements of the specific institution.  \n \n12. \nEligibility  for  ADB  Financing.  As  noted  above,  there  is  a  large  field  of  possible \ncandidate MFIs and small-business banks that ADB could finance. The MFI Facility will be open \nto working with the full range of MFIs and small-business banks described above. All candidate \ninstitutions, however,  must  meet  certain  eligibility  criteria,  including  the  following:  (i)  they  must \nbe commercial organizations that will use the ADB funding to expand their lending to micro- and \nsmall  enterprises;  (ii)  they  must  face  a  genuine  constraint  in  accessing  term  loans  from \ncommercial  sources;  (iii)  they  must  work  with  recognized  auditors;  (iv)  their  shareholding \nstructures  must  be  clear;  (v)  they  must  have,  or  be  working  to  develop,  acceptable  risk-\nmanagement  systems  and  other  operational  structures;  and  (vi)  ideally  they  should  have \ninvestors  or  creditors  that  include  international  finance  institutions  (IFIs)  that  demand  certain \nlevels  of  transparency  and  information  disclosure  (although  this  may  not  always  be  possible). \nPoint  (ii),  above,  is  of  particular  importance;  international  financial  institutions  (IFIs),  including \nADB\u2019s peers, have been cited repeatedly for their inclination to lend only to the latest and most \nsuccessful  microfinance  and  small-business  banking  MFIs,  while  avoiding  the  needier  next \ngeneration. This creates market distortions as IFIs undercut commercial lenders, crowding them \nout of the market. To avoid this, the MFI Facility will seek to provide loans to \u201cnext-generation\u201d \nMFIs and small-business banks that have not yet attracted significant commercial funding.5  \n                                                 \n4  Available: http://microcapital.org/downloads/whitepapers/Eastern.pdf \n5  For  further  information,  see  \"Access  to  All:  Building  Inclusive  Financial  Systems\"  (CGAP,  2006),  which  states: \n\u201c\u2026IFIs, with their low-cost public money, should move away from the same regulated MFIs they have funded over \nthe  past  several  years  and  encourage  them  to  develop  their  own  links  to  domestic  capital  markets.  This  means \nfocusing more on the next generation of strong institutions, offering seed capital and support for the development \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n \n\n \nB. \n\nComplementary  ADB  Initiatives  and  Consistency  with  the  Country  Strategy  and \nProgram \n\nADB  has  supported  microfinance  and  micro-  and  small-enterprise  initiatives  for  almost \n13. \ntwo  decades.  Between  1988  and  1999,  ADB  approved  14  microfinance-specific  projects,  13 \nprojects with microfinance components, and 45 technical assistance projects (total operations of \nabout  $380  million).  In  2000,  recognizing  that  the  industry  landscape  has  changed  over  the \nyears,  ADB  formulated  and  approved  the  Microfinance  Development  Strategy  (MDS),  which \nprovides  a  consistent  and  comprehensive \nframework  and  guides  ADB\u2019s  microfinance \noperations.6  \n \nThe  MDS  aims  to  ensure  permanent  access  to  institutional  financial  services  for  a \n14. \nmajority  of  poor  and  low-income  households  and  their  microenterprises.  The  purpose  is  to \nsupport  the  development  of  sustainable  microfinance  systems  that  can  provide  diverse,  high-\nquality  services.  The  strategy  focuses  on  (i)  creating  a  policy  environment  conducive  to \nmicrofinance,  (ii)  developing  financial  infrastructure,  (iii)  building  viable  institutions,  (iv) \nsupporting  pro-poor  innovations,  and  (v)  supporting  social  intermediation.  Indeed,  the  MDS \nstates  that  ADB  will  catalyze  expanding  the  supply  of  microfinance  by  focusing  on  building \nfinancial  systems  that  can  grow  and  provide  financial  services  on  a  permanent  basis  to  an \nincreasing  proportion  of  the  poor.  The  MDS  encourages  ADB  to,  among  other  things,  support \ndevelopment  of  viable  MFIs  that  can  set  in  motion  a  process  of  commercialization  of \nmicrofinance services.7\n \nAfter  the  MDS  strategy  was  adopted,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  shifted  from  providing  support \n15. \nfor particular microcredit projects to building financial systems for the poor. From 2000 to 2004, \n10 microfinance loan projects and 16 projects with microfinance components (total operations of \nabout  $482  million)  were  funded.  In  2004,  ADB  also  made  an  equity  investment  in  ShoreCap \nInternational of $2.5 million. This was ADB\u2019s first intervention in commercial microfinance, i.e., a \nmicrofinance project offering financing in the absence of a sovereign guarantee.  \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nor  transformation  of  this  new  crop  of  stars.\u201d  (Helms,  Brigit.  2006.

Development institutions are \u201ccrowding\u201d \nprivate  lenders  out  of  the  best  MFIs.  IFIs  publicly  claim  to  take  risks  the  private  sector  is  unwilling  to  take.  One \nwould therefore have expected government-owned development institutions to shift their lending to more risky MFIs \nas soon as private lenders entered the field. The opposite is happening. Development agencies are today heavily \nconcentrating their funding in the largest and most successful MFIs, exactly the target investment market of private \ninvestors. A MicroRate-commissioned study of funding patterns confirmed that IFIs are not complementing private \nlenders,  they  are  crowding  them  out  of  the  most  attractive  parts  of  the  MFI  market.  IFIs  nearly  doubled  (88% \nincrease)  their  direct  funding  to  top-rated  MFIs  in  2005.  In  the  largest  and  most  successful  MFIs,  IFIs  are  the \ndominant  and  growing  foreign  funding  source.  MIX  data  on  over  160  MFIs  confirm  this  trend.  A  number  of  the \nlargest MFIs in the MIX database have received all of their foreign loans from IFIs. In some cases, private lenders \nwanted to provide funding to a MFI, but were unable to do so because they were unable to match terms offered by \nIFIs.\"  (Abrams,  Julie,  and  Damian  von  Stauffenberg.  2007.

Manila (pages 25\u201326). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n16. \nDeveloped over nearly 20 years, ADB's total ongoing microfinance portfolio as of 31 May \n2007  was  $2.1  billion.  This  amount  includes  $446  million  of  loans  from  ADB's  concessional \nwindow  of  funds  and  $1.6  billion  from  its  commercial  window.  The  portfolio  also  includes  an \nequity investment of $2.5 million, a grant of $16.0 million under the Asian Tsunami Fund, and a \n$8.5 million grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and Japan Fund for Information \nand Communication Technology. \n \nAs  has  been  described,  a  clear  theme  of  ADB\u2019s  microfinance  strategy  is  a  focus  on \n17. \nbuilding  viable  institutions.  The  proposed  MFI  Facility  is  fully  in  line  with  this  strategy;  viable \ninstitutions require multiple forms of financing, and in particular require commercial financing, to \nensure  their  long-term  sustainability.  The  intervention  builds  on  the  precedent  set  by  the \nin \nShoreCap \nmicrofinance  institutions  in  a  more  scalable  manner.  Importantly,  this  represents  the  first  time \nthat ADB will lend directly to MFIs, as opposed to working through government agencies, apex \ninstitutions, or funds managed by third parties (as was previously the case).  \n \nC. \n\nDevelopment Objectives \n\nfacilitating  ADB\u2019s  direct \n\nInternational  equity \n\ninvestment  by \n\ninterventions \n\nADB\u2019s funding of the MFI Facility will promote development at several levels.  \n\n18. \n \n19. \nDirect  Support  to  MFIs.  The  MFI  Facility\u2019s  loans  will  immediately  allow  the  recipient \nMFIs  and  small-business  banks  to  scale  up  and  expand  their  microloan  portfolios,  increasing \ntheir  ability  to  make  more  loans  and  provide  more  services  in  their  communities.  The  MFI \nFacility will also seek to provide institutions with longer tenor of funding, thus helping to address \nasset  and  liability  mismatches.  Additionally,  financial  support  from  a  well-regarded  institution \nsuch as ADB would help to increase depositor confidence in the selected recipient institutions \nand in these relatively young banking markets overall.  \n \n20. \nSupport  to  MFI  Borrowers.  The  loans  from  ADB  to  the  MFIs  and  small  banks  will  in \nturn be used to lend to micro- and small-business owners, thereby granting access to loans for \nmore  of  these  clients  in  the  various  countries.  The  loans  are  frequently  used  to  expand  the \noperations of the micro- and small businesses, translating directly into job creation, often at the \nlower end of the skill spectrum.  \n \n21. \nPoverty  Reduction.  The  combination  of  more  small  companies  doing  more  business \nand  employing  more  people  will  contribute  to  rising  incomes,  higher  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)  rates,  and  ultimately,  it  is  hoped,  a  lower  incidence  of  poverty  in  the  countries  where \nthese MFIs and small-business banks operate. The loans will also help very small businesses to \ngrow  and  at  some  point  enter  the  formal  economy,  thus  beginning  to  pay  taxes  that  the \ngovernments can direct towards social services and infrastructure requirements.  \n \n22. \nAssistance with Market Development. Increased financial resources will help the MFIs \nand  small-business  banks  to  expand  their  operations,  thus  extending  the  reach  of  the \ncommercial microlending sector as a whole. Additionally, the capacity of the MFIs to repay their \nloans on time and at appropriate commercial interest rates will signal to commercial lenders that \nlending  to  MFIs  is  not  only  not  as  risky  as  they  perceive,  but  is  also  profitable.  This  should \nattract more lenders into the market and should begin to counter the reluctance of commercial \nlenders to lend, as described in para. 9, thus encouraging them to begin lending.  \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n \n\n \nD. \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n23. \nCatalytic  and  Demonstration  Effect.  Given  the  reluctance  of  lending  institutions  to \nprovide  loans  to  MFIs,  by  its  intervention  ADB  will  demonstrate  the  capacity  of  MFIs  to  repay \nloans in a timely fashion at commercial interest rates. This will serve to catalyze other lenders \n(e.g., commercial banks) into the market of lending to MFIs. In general, the MFIs are unable to \nsource  loans  from  local  banks,  and  ADB\u2019s  added  value  comes  in  the  form  both  of  providing \ndirect financing to the institutions themselves, and also by providing PCGs that in effect link the \nMFIs to the indigenous financial system.  \n \n24. \nBetter  Matching  of  Assets  and  Liabilities. One key issue constraining the growth of \nMFIs is frequently that of mismatches. In terms of tenor, for example, it is frequently difficult for \nMFIs and small banks to attract long-term loans, and they thus end up in a situation where the \nloans  they  provide  are  longer  in  tenor  than  the  loans  they  receive,  resulting  in  a  mismatch  of \nshorter-term  assets  and  longer-term  liabilities.  ADB\u2019s  ability  to  provide  financing  for  longer \ntenors  allows  the  MFI  to  avoid  this  problem  and  to  properly  match  assets  and  liabilities.  ADB \nmay also seek to structure a local currency PCG in which ADB absorbs part or all of the foreign \nexchange risk, which would also allow the institutions to better match assets and liabilities with \nregard to currency; this component of the MFI Facility, however, is yet to be developed.  \n \n25. \nPrivate-Sector  Development.  ADB\u2019s  establishment  of  this  MFI  Facility  will  make  a \ndirect contribution to private sector development through encouraging such mechanisms as (i) \nenhanced  disclosure  and  accounting  standards  at  MFIs,  (ii)  better  matches  of  assets  and \nliabilities (as described above) at individual institutions, and (iii) an increased share of private-\nsector financial institutions in the total assets of the financial sector. The MFI Facility will in this \nmanner  help  ADB\u2019s  DMCs  to  implement  their  respective  country-specific  private  sector \ndevelopment strategies.  \n \nE. \n\nMeasuring Development Effectiveness \n\n26. \nA  design  and  monitoring  framework  has  been  developed  (see  Appendix  1).  The  MFIs \nwill be required to collect and periodically submit information that will facilitate this analysis, both \nduring project implementation and as part of a project completion report. Participating MFIs will \nbe required to submit their annual reports and audited financial statements, as well as summary \ninformation regarding the subloans funded from ADB loans.8  \n \n\n                                                 \n8  Additionally, many of the MFI Facility\u2019s loan recipients are registered on the MixMarket (www.mixmarket.org), the \nglobal  information  exchange  for  the  microfinance  industry,  which  strives  to  facilitate  exchange  and  investments \nflows, promote transparency, and improve reporting standards in the microfinance industry. For each of the MFIs \nregistered on the website, the MixMarket collects information on the following: (i) number of personnel, (ii) number \nof active borrowers, (iii) average loan balance per borrower, (iv) percentage of loans below $300, (v) percentage of \nwomen borrowers, (vi) average loan balance per borrower divided by gross national income per capita, (vii) number \nof  savers,  (viii)  average  savings  balance  per  saver,  (ix)  average  savings  balance  per  saver  divided  by  gross \nnational income per capita, (x) percentage of clients below the poverty line, (xi) percentage of clients in the bottom \nhalf of the population below the poverty line, (xii) clients in households earning less than $1 per day per household \nmember, and (xiii) clients starting microenterprises for the first time. The MixMarket collects this information on a \nyearly  basis,  and  the  data  will  be  of  benefit  to  ADB  in  its  efforts  to  collect  information  (both  through  continuous \nmonitoring and at project completion stage) that substantiates development impact.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\nA. \n\nProject Overview  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nADB  proposes  to  provide  loans  and  guarantees  (MFI  Facility),  in  the  aggregate  not \n27. \nexceeding $20 million, to microfinance institutions and banks in ADB DMCs, including loans to \nBank Eskhata and Inecobank. Loans and guarantees under the MFI Facility may be provided by \nADB during a period of 3 years from the date of the approval of the MFI Facility by the Board of \nDirectors. \n \nB. \n\nLoans  \n\nA  direct  loan  from  ADB  to  an  MFI  or  small-business  bank  would  be  appropriate  for \n28. \ninstitutions  that  desire  longer-tenored  foreign  currency  funding  than  that  available  in  local \nmarkets.  In  countries  such  as  Armenia  and  Tajikistan,  large  fractions  of  the  respective  bank\u2019s \nloan portfolios are in US dollars, thus currency mismatch will not be a significant issue for these \ninstitutions. \n \n29. \nLoans  to  the  beneficiaries  will  range  in  tenor  between  3  and  7  years,  and  will  be \ndenominated in US dollars in amounts of between $1 million and $5 million. The majority of the \nloans will be in the 3\u20135 year range. Maturities of longer than 5 years will be considered only for \nbanks with well-established track records, which are building a longer-dated portfolio. \n \n30. \nLoan interest will be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s lending facility based on the \nLondon interbank offered rate. Loan pricing and other terms will be benchmarked against, and \nconsistent with, observed market rates.  \n \nC. \n\nCredit Guarantees \n\n31. \nIn certain countries, where there is a need for long-term, local-currency funding, ADB will \nseek to work with a local commercial bank that will provide local-currency financing to the MFI \nor small-business bank, with the support of a PCG from ADB.  \n \n32. \nThis would be appropriate for MFIs that desire local-currency financing, and are unable \nto secure this from local commercial lenders because of the small size of their capital base and \ntheir lack of sufficient traditional collateral.  \n \n33. \nADB\u2019s  guarantee  would  be  denominated  either  in  US  dollars  or  in  local  currency, \ndepending upon the circumstances of a particular transaction. On a case-by-case basis it will be \ndetermined whether the transaction would be a dollar or a local-currency PCG, depending upon \nthe sharing of foreign exchange risks.   \n \n34. \n \nD. \n\nPricing for the PCG will be market-based.  \n\nTransaction Processing \n\n35. \nConstructing  the  Portfolio.  ADB  will  construct  a  portfolio  of  MFIs  that  meet  certain \ncriteria,  including  (i)  the  need  for  financing  and  an  inability  to  access  sufficient  financing  from \ncommercial  sources;  (ii)  dedication  to,  and  competence  in,  microlending;  and  (iii)  commercial \nconsiderations  as  mentioned  above  (including  using  recognized  auditors,  having  transparent \nshareholder structures, and developing adequate risk management processes). In allocating the \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n \n\nMFI  Facility,  ADB  will  construct  a  portfolio  of  6\u201310  institutions,  each  of  which  will  receive \nbetween  $1  million  and  $5  million  in  financing.  Risk  will  thus  be  spread  across  multiple \ninstitutions  in  multiple  countries,  creating  a  highly  diversified  portfolio  of  MFIs  and  small-\nbusiness banks.  \n \n36. \nProcessing and Procedures. Each institution to be funded through the MFI Facility will \nundergo  the  same  process  for  assessment  and  approval  of  a  loan  or  PCG.  This  process  has \nbeen followed for the two loans being approved in this report, and the process will be followed \nfor allocating the remainder of the MFI Facility. The process is as follows. \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nIdentify candidate institutions  \nDue diligence  \nProject proposal   \nRisk Management Unit assessment  \nLoan or PCG pricing  \nLoan or PCG documentation and disbursal  \n\n \n37. \nGeographical  Diversification.  The  first  two  institutions  to  be  served  under  the  MFI \nFacility  will  be  located  in  Armenia  and  Tajikistan.  The  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  India, \nKazakhstan, Malaysia, and Viet Nam are not considered as eligible for the MFI Facility due to (i) \nADB\u2019s large private-sector presence in the financial sector in those countries, and (ii) the degree \nof development of the financial sectors in those countries. Afghanistan is not considered eligible \nfor the MFI Facility due to the high degree of risk associated with the country. Further loans will \nbe contemplated to MFIs and small-business banks in ADB\u2019s other DMCs.  \n \n38. \nSelection Criteria and Portfolio Parameters. No more than 30% of the MFI Facility ($6 \nmillion) will be lent to institutions in any given country. No more than 20% ($4 million) will be lent \nto any specific MFI.  \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE BENEFICIARIES \n\nA. \n\nBank Eskhata \n\nADB  proposes  to  make  a  loan  of  $1.5  million  to  Bank  Eskhata,  denominated  in  US \n39. \ndollars, at a rate to be determined in accordance with the market.   Bank \nwas \nincorporated as an open joint-stock company in Tajikistan in 1993, and was reregistered as an \nopen  joint-stock  company  in  2002.  Today  it  has  a  6.6%  market  share  by  equity  and  a  3.5% \nshare by assets.9 The bank is headquartered in Khujand, operates a network of 8 branches, 20 \nmoney transfer centers, and 3 ATMs, and employs 553 staff. Bank Eskhata\u2019s primary business \nconsists  of  commercial  activities,  credit  and  debit  cards,  foreign  currencies,  and  originating \nloans  and  guarantees.  The  bank  offers  different  types  of  corporate  and  consumer  loans  in \naddition  to  account  management,  sight  and  term  deposits,  and  trade-finance  facilities.  Bank \nEskhata\u2019s vision is to become the leading bank of the Sogd region, providing diversified banking \nservices to retail and corporate clients, while best serving the interests of its shareholders. \n\nEskhata \n\n                                                 \n9 Although the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) does not disclose bank rankings, Bank Eskhata estimates that it is \nranked approximately   fourth or fifth by assets, deposits, and loans, with higher shares in the north of the country.   \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\n \nB. \n\nInecobank \n\n40. \nADB proposes to make a loan of $3 million to Inecobank, denominated in US dollars, at \na rate to be determined in accordance with the market.  Inecobank was established as a closed \njoint-stock company in Armenia in 1996. Today, of the 21 banks currently operating in Armenia, \nInecobank  is  established  as  a  medium-sized  commercial  bank,  ranked  10th  by  total  assets \n(4.1% of the market), 10th by loan portfolio (4.0% of the market), and 11th by deposits (3.27% \nof the market). Inecobank is headquartered in Yerevan, operates four branches throughout the \ncountry,  and  has  244  employees.  Inecobank  offers  a  full  range  of  interest-  and  noninterest-\nrelated banking services, including different types of corporate and consumer loans in addition \nto  account  management,  sight  and  term  deposits,  debit  and  credit  cards,  and  trade  finance \nfacilities (letters of guarantees and of credit) (all offered in Armenian dram [AMD] and US dollars) \nto  both  corporate  and  retail  customers.  Inecobank  excels  in  automated  consumer  lending  and \nhas readily adopted cash-flow microlending methodology. \n \n\nV. \n\nADB POLICIES, RISK FACTORS, AND EXPOSURE LIMITS \n\nA. \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguard Policies \n\n41. \nLoans  and  guarantees  the  MFI  Facility  makes  will  be  classified  category  FIs  (financial \nintermediaries) under ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). On a transaction-by-transaction basis, \nADB will determine whether a particular loan or PCG extended through the MFI Facility is likely \nto  result  in  environmental  impacts,  and  will  design  an  environmental  management  system  as \nappropriate.  \n \n42. \nADB\u2019s loans and PCGs extended through the MFI Facility will be classified category C \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  no  involuntary  settlements  are \nforeseen in relation to any of the loans or PCGs extended.  \n \n43. \nADB\u2019s loans and PCGs extended through the MFI Facility will be classified category C \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  and  no  loans  or  PCGs  extended  are \nexpected to have any impact on indigenous peoples.  \n \nB. \nTerrorism \n\nAnticorruption  Policy;  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \n\nThe borrowers were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \n44. \nand  policy  relating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism \n(2003).10 Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB will require each borrower to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and \ncontrols following international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption \nor  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain \nfrom  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  loan  and  PCG  documentation  between  ADB  and  the \nborrowers  will  further  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential  violation  of  these \nundertakings.  \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2003.
