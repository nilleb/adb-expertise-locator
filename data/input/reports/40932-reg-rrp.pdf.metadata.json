I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation for proposed loans \nand guarantees (the MFI Facility), in the aggregate not exceeding $20 million, to microfinance \ninstitutions (MFIs) and small-business banks in Asian Development Bank (ADB) developing \nmember countries (DMCs). This approval includes provision of loans to Bank Eskhata and \nInecobank, with pricing to be determined based on the procedures applicable to ADB\u2019s private \nsector operations and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board.  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background \n2.  Defining Micro and Small Enterprise Finance. Micro- and small enterprise finance \nconsists of a broad range of funding modalities and options. According to the Consultative \nGroup to Assist the Poor (CGAP),1 an MFI is an organization that provides financial services to \na  clientele  poorer  and  more  vulnerable  than  traditional  bank  clients;  within  this  definition, \nhowever,  the  diversity  of  organizations  is  immense.  Ownership  structures  of  MFIs  include \ngovernment-owned institutions such as (i) the rural credit cooperatives in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China; (ii) member-owned organizations like the credit unions in West Africa; (iii) institutions \nowned  by  socially  minded  shareholders,  such  as  the  many  transformed  nongovernment \norganizations in Latin America; and (iv) institutions owned by profit-maximizing shareholders, \nsuch as the microfinance banks in Eastern Europe.  \n \n3.  The focus of MFIs also varies; while the focus of some institutions is the provision of \nfinancial services exclusively to the poor, others offer a wide range of financial services for \nmultiple markets. Some MFIs focus narrowly on traditional microcredit (i.e., microloans without \ncollateral, delivered through a range of group-based and individual methodologies) while other \nMFIs offer a range of services including savings, insurance, and remittances.2 Within this same \nfield of microfinance fall MFIs like the Grameen Bank, which serves poor women with tiny loans, \nand the ProCredit banks, with a commercial approach to providing micro- and small businesses \nwith loans of thousands of dollars.  \n \n4.  When one expands the spectrum to encompass not only microfinancing but also small-\nenterprise financing, the field of funding organizations grows larger still. Even the definition of a \nsmall enterprise is open to debate, and most countries establish their own definitions. The \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), for example, defines microloans \noffered through its small and medium enterprise facility for the European Union as loans of up to \na maximum of \u20ac30,000 (approximately $40,000), and a small loan as between \u20ac30,000 and \n\u20ac125,000 (approximately $170,000). In their micro- and small-enterprise lending programs, a \nmicroloan is a loan of up to $10,000 and a small loan can go up to $200,000. Sub-borrowers are \nin  turn  defined  in  terms  of  size,  either  by  number  of  employees,  value  of  assets,  or  the \ncompany\u2019s turnover. The European Union small and medium enterprise definition delineates \n                                                 \n1 The CGAP is a consortium of 33 public and private development agencies (including ADB as a consortium member \nand donor) that work together to expand access to financial services for the poor in developing countries. CGAP \nwas created by these agencies to help create permanent financial services for the poor on a large scale. CGAP is a \nresource center for the microfinance industry, where it incubates and supports new ideas, innovative products, \ncutting-edge  technology,  novel  mechanisms  for  delivering  financial  services,  and  concrete  solutions  to  the \nchallenges of expanding microfinance. Available: http://www.cgap.org. \n2  Available: http://www.cgap.org/portal/site/CGAP/menuitem.5cb3955e9924016067808010591010a0/ ", "2   \n \nmicroenterprises as companies with up to nine employees, and small enterprises as having  \n10\u201349 employees.3 The institutions that provide small-enterprise financing (which one can refer \nto as small-business banks) are as varied in legal structure, mission, and lending methodology \nas their microfinancing peers.  \n \n5.  Need  for  Funding  in  the  Micro-  and  Small  Enterprise  Financing  Sector.  This \nprofusion of types of MFIs and small-business banks, however, has two things in common. The \nfirst is, simply, a commitment to financing micro- and small enterprises, however those are \ndefined in any given country. The second is an often endemic difficulty in accessing financing \nfrom commercial lenders. Equity funds investing in microfinance and small-business banks are \nincreasingly appearing on the landscape of micro- and small enterprise financing, and this is a \nwelcome development. However, although infusions of equity are beneficial for MFIs, CGAP \nstates that MFIs often already have high levels of equity capital relative to debt, and therefore \nhave greater interest in increasing liabilities rather than in raising new equity.  \n \n6.  Although this is the case for both MFIs and small-business banks, MFIs are often \nparticularly  challenged  in  this  regard.  Unlike  small  banks,  MFIs  are  often  purely  lending \ninstitutions  and  either  do  not  take  deposits  or  do  not  take  them  until  rather  late  in  their \ninstitutional lives, thus making access to debt financing crucial to growth. (Some MFIs, including \nthose registered as nongovernment organizations, do not have legal authorization to mobilize \ndeposits and as such are compelled to rely solely on debt financing to fund expansion.)  \n \n7.  The result of these issues in accessing debt financing is demonstrated by the fact that, \nalthough most countries allow such institutions to maintain debt-equity ratios of 8x, 10x, or \nhigher, most regulated MFIs have lower (often much lower) levels of leverage.  \n \n8.  The MFIs seeking loans and partial credit guarantees (PCGs) through the MFI Facility \nare, for the most part, highly constrained in this regard. This includes (as will be discussed \nfurther) Bank Eskhata and Inecobank.  \n \n9.  Commercial  Lenders  Reluctant  to  Provide  Debt  Financing  to  MFIs  and  Small-\nBusiness  Banks.  Commercial  lenders  are  reluctant  to  provide  loans  to  MFIs  and  small-\nbusiness banks for a variety of reasons. The following reasons apply to MFIs. \n \n(i)  Many institutions lack operational and accounting transparency, which are key to \nencouraging large, sophisticated institutions to seriously consider lending.  \n \n(ii)  Lenders  often  perceive  risks\u2014political,  macroeconomic,  contract,  collateral, \nsupervision, management, competition, and currency\u2014to be high in environments \n(such  as  various  frontier  economies)  where  MFIs  and  small-business  banks \noperate, and foreign sources of capital may not be inclined to expend the money \nand effort to discern the security of lending.  \n \n(iii)  Existing laws and regulations can make it difficult for MFIs to borrow or transform \ninto other legal forms that can borrow more easily.  \n \n                                                 \n3  Available:  http://www.ebrd.com/about/policies/sector/msme.pdf.  Micro,  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises \nStrategy, as approved by the EBRD Board of Directors at its meeting on 7 February 2006. ", "    3\n(iv)  Certain donor practices work against enhancing the creditworthiness of MFIs, \nmaking it harder for them to secure commercial financing.4  \n \n10.  Small-business banks face a similar, although not identical, set of constraints to those \nfaced by MFIs in attracting debt in the form of loans from commercial lenders. \n \n(i)  Although  frequently  more  transparent  from  the  standpoint  of  operations  and \ntransparency  than  MFIs,  small-business  banks  are  often  equipped  with \nsubstandard information technology and management information systems, which \nhave difficulty producing the sophistication of reporting on issues like portfolio-at-\nrisk and liquidity management, which would give confidence to foreign investors.  \n \n(ii)  Perceived risks are still substantial in many frontier countries, even when the \ninstitution in question is a small bank rather than an MFI.  \n \n(iii)  In many countries, particularly the more frontier DMCs, there is effectively no \ninterbank lending market, and banks (especially those operating in very small \nbanking  systems)  view  one  another  as  competitors  rather  than  as  reciprocal \nproviders of liquidity.  \n \n11.  ADB to Help Address the Debt Financing Gap to MFIs. Given this need for, and \nconstraint to, debt financing of MFIs and small-business banks, ADB has developed the concept \nof a loan facility that will be flexible enough to serve multiple MFIs and small-business banks \nwith the relatively small amounts of debt that they require. This facility structure thus diversifies \nrisks across a sizeable portfolio of institutions and countries (described further below), to be \nselected based on strict due-diligence criteria. Financing will be provided in the form of both \nloans and PCGs, and may be extended in both hard and local currencies, based on the \nrequirements of the specific institution.  \n \n12.  Eligibility  for  ADB  Financing.  As  noted  above,  there  is  a  large  field  of  possible \ncandidate MFIs and small-business banks that ADB could finance. The MFI Facility will be open \nto working with the full range of MFIs and small-business banks described above. All candidate \ninstitutions, however, must meet certain eligibility criteria, including the following: (i) they must \nbe commercial organizations that will use the ADB funding to expand their lending to micro- and \nsmall  enterprises;  (ii)  they  must  face  a  genuine  constraint  in  accessing  term  loans  from \ncommercial  sources;  (iii)  they  must  work  with  recognized  auditors;  (iv)  their  shareholding \nstructures  must  be  clear;  (v)  they  must  have,  or  be  working  to  develop,  acceptable  risk-\nmanagement  systems  and  other  operational  structures;  and  (vi)  ideally  they  should  have \ninvestors or creditors that include international finance institutions (IFIs) that demand certain \nlevels of transparency and information disclosure (although this may not always be possible). \nPoint (ii), above, is of particular importance; international financial institutions (IFIs), including \nADB\u2019s peers, have been cited repeatedly for their inclination to lend only to the latest and most \nsuccessful microfinance and small-business banking MFIs, while avoiding the needier next \ngeneration. This creates market distortions as IFIs undercut commercial lenders, crowding them \nout of the market. To avoid this, the MFI Facility will seek to provide loans to \u201cnext-generation\u201d \nMFIs and small-business banks that have not yet attracted significant commercial funding.5  \n                                                 \n4  Available: http://microcapital.org/downloads/whitepapers/Eastern.pdf \n5 For further information, see \"Access to All: Building Inclusive Financial Systems\" (CGAP, 2006), which states: \n\u201c\u2026IFIs, with their low-cost public money, should move away from the same regulated MFIs they have funded over \nthe past several years and encourage them to develop their own links to domestic capital markets. This means \nfocusing more on the next generation of strong institutions, offering seed capital and support for the development \n ", "4   \n \n \nB.  Complementary ADB Initiatives and Consistency with the Country Strategy and \nProgram \n13.  ADB has supported microfinance and micro- and small-enterprise initiatives for almost \ntwo decades. Between 1988 and 1999, ADB approved 14 microfinance-specific projects, 13 \nprojects with microfinance components, and 45 technical assistance projects (total operations of \nabout $380 million). In 2000, recognizing that the industry landscape has changed over the \nyears, ADB formulated and approved the Microfinance Development Strategy (MDS), which \nprovides  a  consistent  and  comprehensive  framework  and  guides  ADB\u2019s  microfinance \noperations.6  \n \n14.  The MDS  aims to ensure permanent access to institutional financial services for a \nmajority of poor and low-income households and their microenterprises. The purpose is to \nsupport the development of sustainable microfinance systems that can provide diverse, high-\nquality  services.  The  strategy  focuses  on  (i)  creating  a  policy  environment  conducive  to \nmicrofinance,  (ii)  developing  financial  infrastructure,  (iii)  building  viable  institutions,  (iv) \nsupporting pro-poor innovations, and (v) supporting social intermediation. Indeed, the MDS \nstates that ADB will catalyze expanding the supply of microfinance by focusing on building \nfinancial systems that can grow and provide financial services on a permanent basis to an \nincreasing proportion of the poor. The MDS encourages ADB to, among other things, support \ndevelopment  of  viable  MFIs  that  can  set  in  motion  a  process  of  commercialization  of \nmicrofinance services.7\n \n15.  After the MDS strategy was adopted, ADB\u2019s assistance shifted from providing support \nfor particular microcredit projects to building financial systems for the poor. From 2000 to 2004, \n10 microfinance loan projects and 16 projects with microfinance components (total operations of \nabout $482 million) were funded. In 2004, ADB also made an equity investment in ShoreCap \nInternational of $2.5 million. This was ADB\u2019s first intervention in commercial microfinance, i.e., a \nmicrofinance project offering financing in the absence of a sovereign guarantee.  \n                                                                                                                                                          \nor transformation of this new crop of stars.\u201d (Helms, Brigit. 2006. Access to All: Building Inclusive Financial \nSystems.  Washington,  DC:  Consultative  Group  to  Assist  the  Poor.          Available: \nhttp://www.cgap.org/portal/binary/com.epicentric.contentmanagement.servlet.ContentDeliveryServlet/Documents/B\nook_AccessforAll.pdf.) \n    As quoted in Role Reversal (MicroRate, 2007): \"IFIs are concentrating their loans in the strongest MFIs, leaving \nprivate lenders to look for opportunities among smaller, riskier borrowers. Development institutions are \u201ccrowding\u201d \nprivate lenders out of the best MFIs. IFIs publicly claim to take risks the private sector is unwilling to take. One \nwould therefore have expected government-owned development institutions to shift their lending to more risky MFIs \nas soon as private lenders entered the field. The opposite is happening. Development agencies are today heavily \nconcentrating their funding in the largest and most successful MFIs, exactly the target investment market of private \ninvestors. A MicroRate-commissioned study of funding patterns confirmed that IFIs are not complementing private \nlenders, they are crowding them out of the most attractive parts of the MFI market. IFIs nearly doubled (88% \nincrease) their direct funding to top-rated MFIs in 2005. In the largest and most successful MFIs, IFIs are the \ndominant and growing foreign funding source. MIX data on over 160 MFIs confirm this trend. A number of the \nlargest MFIs in the MIX database have received all of their foreign loans from IFIs. In some cases, private lenders \nwanted to provide funding to a MFI, but were unable to do so because they were unable to match terms offered by \nIFIs.\" (Abrams, Julie, and Damian von Stauffenberg. 2007.

Annual Report 2004,  Manila (pages 17\u201318).  \n7 ADB. 2000. Finance for the Poor: Microfinance Development Strategy. Manila (pages 25\u201326). ", "    5\n \n16.  Developed over nearly 20 years, ADB's total ongoing microfinance portfolio as of 31 May \n2007 was $2.1 billion. This amount includes $446 million of loans from ADB's concessional \nwindow of funds and $1.6 billion from its commercial window. The portfolio also includes an \nequity investment of $2.5 million, a grant of $16.0 million under the Asian Tsunami Fund, and a \n$8.5 million grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and Japan Fund for Information \nand Communication Technology. \n \n17.  As has been described, a clear theme of ADB\u2019s microfinance strategy is a focus on \nbuilding viable institutions. The proposed MFI Facility is fully in line with this strategy; viable \ninstitutions require multiple forms of financing, and in particular require commercial financing, to \nensure  their  long-term  sustainability.  The  intervention  builds  on  the  precedent  set  by  the \nShoreCap  International  equity  investment  by  facilitating  ADB\u2019s  direct  interventions  in \nmicrofinance institutions in a more scalable manner. Importantly, this represents the first time \nthat ADB will lend directly to MFIs, as opposed to working through government agencies, apex \ninstitutions, or funds managed by third parties (as was previously the case).  \n \nC.  Development Objectives \n18.  ADB\u2019s funding of the MFI Facility will promote development at several levels.  \n \n19.  Direct Support to MFIs. The MFI Facility\u2019s loans will immediately allow the recipient \nMFIs and small-business banks to scale up and expand their microloan portfolios, increasing \ntheir ability to make more loans and provide more services in their communities. The MFI \nFacility will also seek to provide institutions with longer tenor of funding, thus helping to address \nasset and liability mismatches. Additionally, financial support from a well-regarded institution \nsuch as ADB would help to increase depositor confidence in the selected recipient institutions \nand in these relatively young banking markets overall.  \n \n20.  Support to MFI Borrowers. The loans from ADB to the MFIs and small banks will in \nturn be used to lend to micro- and small-business owners, thereby granting access to loans for \nmore of these clients in the various countries. The loans are frequently used to expand the \noperations of the micro- and small businesses, translating directly into job creation, often at the \nlower end of the skill spectrum.  \n \n21.  Poverty Reduction. The combination of more small companies doing more business \nand employing more people will contribute to rising incomes, higher gross domestic product \n(GDP) rates, and ultimately, it is hoped, a lower incidence of poverty in the countries where \nthese MFIs and small-business banks operate. The loans will also help very small businesses to \ngrow  and  at  some  point  enter  the  formal  economy,  thus  beginning  to  pay  taxes  that  the \ngovernments can direct towards social services and infrastructure requirements.  \n \n22.  Assistance with Market Development. Increased financial resources will help the MFIs \nand  small-business  banks  to  expand  their  operations,  thus  extending  the  reach  of  the \ncommercial microlending sector as a whole. Additionally, the capacity of the MFIs to repay their \nloans on time and at appropriate commercial interest rates will signal to commercial lenders that \nlending to MFIs is not only not as risky as they perceive, but is also profitable. This should \nattract more lenders into the market and should begin to counter the reluctance of commercial \nlenders to lend, as described in para. 9, thus encouraging them to begin lending.  \n ", "6   \n \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB \n23.  Catalytic and Demonstration Effect. Given the reluctance of lending institutions to \nprovide loans to MFIs, by its intervention ADB will demonstrate the capacity of MFIs to repay \nloans in a timely fashion at commercial interest rates. This will serve to catalyze other lenders \n(e.g., commercial banks) into the market of lending to MFIs. In general, the MFIs are unable to \nsource loans from local banks, and ADB\u2019s added value comes in the form both of providing \ndirect financing to the institutions themselves, and also by providing PCGs that in effect link the \nMFIs to the indigenous financial system.  \n \n24.  Better Matching of Assets and Liabilities. One key issue constraining the growth of \nMFIs is frequently that of mismatches. In terms of tenor, for example, it is frequently difficult for \nMFIs and small banks to attract long-term loans, and they thus end up in a situation where the \nloans they provide are longer in tenor than the loans they receive, resulting in a mismatch of \nshorter-term assets and longer-term liabilities. ADB\u2019s ability to provide financing for longer \ntenors allows the MFI to avoid this problem and to properly match assets and liabilities. ADB \nmay also seek to structure a local currency PCG in which ADB absorbs part or all of the foreign \nexchange risk, which would also allow the institutions to better match assets and liabilities with \nregard to currency; this component of the MFI Facility, however, is yet to be developed.  \n \n25.  Private-Sector  Development. ADB\u2019s establishment of this MFI Facility will make a \ndirect contribution to private sector development through encouraging such mechanisms as (i) \nenhanced  disclosure  and  accounting  standards  at  MFIs, (ii)  better matches  of  assets  and \nliabilities (as described above) at individual institutions, and (iii) an increased share of private-\nsector financial institutions in the total assets of the financial sector. The MFI Facility will in this \nmanner  help  ADB\u2019s  DMCs  to  implement  their  respective  country-specific  private  sector \ndevelopment strategies.  \n \nE.  Measuring Development Effectiveness \n26.  A design and monitoring framework has been developed (see Appendix 1). The MFIs \nwill be required to collect and periodically submit information that will facilitate this analysis, both \nduring project implementation and as part of a project completion report. Participating MFIs will \nbe required to submit their annual reports and audited financial statements, as well as summary \ninformation regarding the subloans funded from ADB loans.8  \n \n                                                 \n8  Additionally, many of the MFI Facility\u2019s loan recipients are registered on the MixMarket (www.mixmarket.org), the \nglobal information exchange for the microfinance industry, which strives to facilitate exchange and investments \nflows, promote transparency, and improve reporting standards in the microfinance industry. For each of the MFIs \nregistered on the website, the MixMarket collects information on the following: (i) number of personnel, (ii) number \nof active borrowers, (iii) average loan balance per borrower, (iv) percentage of loans below $300, (v) percentage of \nwomen borrowers, (vi) average loan balance per borrower divided by gross national income per capita, (vii) number \nof savers, (viii) average savings balance per saver, (ix) average savings balance per saver divided by gross \nnational income per capita, (x) percentage of clients below the poverty line, (xi) percentage of clients in the bottom \nhalf of the population below the poverty line, (xii) clients in households earning less than $1 per day per household \nmember, and (xiii) clients starting microenterprises for the first time. The MixMarket collects this information on a \nyearly basis, and the data will be of benefit to ADB in its efforts to collect information (both through continuous \nmonitoring and at project completion stage) that substantiates development impact.  ", "    7\nIII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Overview  \n27.  ADB proposes to provide loans and guarantees (MFI Facility), in the aggregate not \nexceeding $20 million, to microfinance institutions and banks in ADB DMCs, including loans to \nBank Eskhata and Inecobank. Loans and guarantees under the MFI Facility may be provided by \nADB during a period of 3 years from the date of the approval of the MFI Facility by the Board of \nDirectors. \n \nB.  Loans  \n28.  A direct loan from ADB to an MFI or small-business bank would be appropriate for \ninstitutions  that  desire  longer-tenored  foreign  currency  funding  than  that  available  in  local \nmarkets. In countries such as Armenia and Tajikistan, large fractions of the respective bank\u2019s \nloan portfolios are in US dollars, thus currency mismatch will not be a significant issue for these \ninstitutions. \n \n29.  Loans  to  the  beneficiaries  will  range  in  tenor  between  3  and  7  years,  and  will  be \ndenominated in US dollars in amounts of between $1 million and $5 million. The majority of the \nloans will be in the 3\u20135 year range. Maturities of longer than 5 years will be considered only for \nbanks with well-established track records, which are building a longer-dated portfolio. \n \n30.  Loan interest will be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s lending facility based on the \nLondon interbank offered rate. Loan pricing and other terms will be benchmarked against, and \nconsistent with, observed market rates.  \n \nC.  Credit Guarantees \n31.  In certain countries, where there is a need for long-term, local-currency funding, ADB will \nseek to work with a local commercial bank that will provide local-currency financing to the MFI \nor small-business bank, with the support of a PCG from ADB.  \n \n32.  This would be appropriate for MFIs that desire local-currency financing, and are unable \nto secure this from local commercial lenders because of the small size of their capital base and \ntheir lack of sufficient traditional collateral.  \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s  guarantee  would  be  denominated  either  in  US  dollars  or  in  local  currency, \ndepending upon the circumstances of a particular transaction. On a case-by-case basis it will be \ndetermined whether the transaction would be a dollar or a local-currency PCG, depending upon \nthe sharing of foreign exchange risks.   \n \n34.  Pricing for the PCG will be market-based.  \n \nD.  Transaction Processing \n35.  Constructing the Portfolio. ADB will construct a portfolio of MFIs that meet certain \ncriteria, including (i) the need for financing and an inability to access sufficient financing from \ncommercial sources; (ii) dedication to, and competence in, microlending; and (iii) commercial \nconsiderations as mentioned above (including using recognized auditors, having transparent \nshareholder structures, and developing adequate risk management processes). In allocating the \n ", "8   \n \nMFI Facility, ADB will construct a portfolio of 6\u201310 institutions, each of which will receive \nbetween  $1  million  and  $5  million  in  financing.  Risk  will  thus  be  spread  across  multiple \ninstitutions  in  multiple  countries,  creating  a  highly  diversified  portfolio  of  MFIs  and  small-\nbusiness banks.  \n \n36.  Processing and Procedures. Each institution to be funded through the MFI Facility will \nundergo the same process for assessment and approval of a loan or PCG. This process has \nbeen followed for the two loans being approved in this report, and the process will be followed \nfor allocating the remainder of the MFI Facility. The process is as follows. \n \n(i)  Identify candidate institutions  \n(ii)  Due diligence  \n(iii)  Project proposal   \n(iv)  Risk Management Unit assessment  \n(v)  Loan or PCG pricing  \n(vi)  Loan or PCG documentation and disbursal  \n \n37.  Geographical Diversification. The first two institutions to be served under the MFI \nFacility  will  be  located  in  Armenia  and  Tajikistan.  The  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  India, \nKazakhstan, Malaysia, and Viet Nam are not considered as eligible for the MFI Facility due to (i) \nADB\u2019s large private-sector presence in the financial sector in those countries, and (ii) the degree \nof development of the financial sectors in those countries. Afghanistan is not considered eligible \nfor the MFI Facility due to the high degree of risk associated with the country. Further loans will \nbe contemplated to MFIs and small-business banks in ADB\u2019s other DMCs.  \n \n38.  Selection Criteria and Portfolio Parameters. No more than 30% of the MFI Facility ($6 \nmillion) will be lent to institutions in any given country. No more than 20% ($4 million) will be lent \nto any specific MFI.  \n \nIV.  THE BENEFICIARIES \nA.  Bank Eskhata \n39.  ADB proposes to make a loan of $1.5 million to Bank Eskhata, denominated in US \ndollars, at a rate to be determined in accordance with the market.  Bank  Eskhata  was \nincorporated as an open joint-stock company in Tajikistan in 1993, and was reregistered as an \nopen joint-stock company in 2002. Today it has a 6.6% market share by equity and a 3.5% \nshare by assets.9 The bank is headquartered in Khujand, operates a network of 8 branches, 20 \nmoney transfer centers, and 3 ATMs, and employs 553 staff. Bank Eskhata\u2019s primary business \nconsists of commercial activities, credit and debit cards, foreign currencies, and originating \nloans and guarantees. The bank offers different types of corporate and consumer loans in \naddition to account management, sight and term deposits, and trade-finance facilities. Bank \nEskhata\u2019s vision is to become the leading bank of the Sogd region, providing diversified banking \nservices to retail and corporate clients, while best serving the interests of its shareholders. \n                                                 \n9 Although the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) does not disclose bank rankings, Bank Eskhata estimates that it is \nranked approximately   fourth or fifth by assets, deposits, and loans, with higher shares in the north of the country.   ", "    9\n \nB.  Inecobank \n40.  ADB proposes to make a loan of $3 million to Inecobank, denominated in US dollars, at \na rate to be determined in accordance with the market.  Inecobank was established as a closed \njoint-stock company in Armenia in 1996. Today, of the 21 banks currently operating in Armenia, \nInecobank is established as a medium-sized commercial bank, ranked 10th by total assets \n(4.1% of the market), 10th by loan portfolio (4.0% of the market), and 11th by deposits (3.27% \nof the market). Inecobank is headquartered in Yerevan, operates four branches throughout the \ncountry, and has 244 employees. Inecobank offers a full range of interest- and noninterest-\nrelated banking services, including different types of corporate and consumer loans in addition \nto account management, sight and term deposits, debit and credit cards, and trade finance \nfacilities (letters of guarantees and of credit) (all offered in Armenian dram [AMD] and US dollars) \nto both corporate and retail customers. Inecobank excels in automated consumer lending and \nhas readily adopted cash-flow microlending methodology. \n \n \nV.  ADB POLICIES, RISK FACTORS, AND EXPOSURE LIMITS \nA.  Social and Environmental Safeguard Policies \n41.  Loans and guarantees the MFI Facility makes will be classified category FIs (financial \nintermediaries) under ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). On a transaction-by-transaction basis, \nADB will determine whether a particular loan or PCG extended through the MFI Facility is likely \nto result in environmental impacts, and will design an environmental management system as \nappropriate.  \n \n42.  ADB\u2019s loans and PCGs extended through the MFI Facility will be classified category C \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  no  involuntary  settlements  are \nforeseen in relation to any of the loans or PCGs extended.  \n \n43.  ADB\u2019s loans and PCGs extended through the MFI Facility will be classified category C \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  and  no  loans  or  PCGs  extended  are \nexpected to have any impact on indigenous peoples.  \n \nB.  Anticorruption  Policy;  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n44.  The borrowers were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nand policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003).10 Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB will require each borrower to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and \ncontrols following international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption \nor money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to refrain \nfrom engaging in such activities. The loan and PCG documentation between ADB and the \nborrowers will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these \nundertakings.  \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2003. Manual on Countering Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism. Manila. \n ", "10  \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n45.  Following the approval of the proposed MFI Facility by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, ADB \nwill  enter  into  suitable  loan  documentation,  PCG  agreements,  and  other  relevant  legal \ndocuments, and shall ensure that such documentation and other principal agreements relating \nto each transaction shall be on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB and shall incorporate all \nrelevant ADB policies. No-objection letters will be obtained in each DMC as a condition to ADB \nfinancing under the MFI Facility.  \n \n \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n46.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans and guarantees would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloans and guarantees to Bank Eskhata (Tajikistan) and Inecobank (Armenia), in an aggregate \namount not exceeding $20,000,000, for the Micro- and Small Enterprise Financing Facility from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate-based lending facility, and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the \nBoard.  \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \nSeptember 2007 \n ", "  Appendix 1  1 1\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n  \u2022  Income per capita  \u2022  DMCs\u2019 central bank   \nThe growth of micro-  rises by 10% over 5  statistics  \u2022  Increased access to \nand small enterprises  years     finance from banks will \ncontributes to rising  \u2022  GDP increases by  lead to more micro- and \nincomes, higher GDPs,  10% over 2 years  small businesses \nand a lower incidence  \u2022  Poverty (% of people  receiving loans and \nof poverty in ADB\u2019s  living on less than $2  expanding their role in \nDMCs.  per day) declines by  the economy \n  10% over 5 years  \u2022  Stable or increased \n  economic development \nin DMCs \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n  \u2022  Number of micro and  \u2022  MFIs\u2019 quarterly and   \nMFIs provide increased  small borrowers  annual financial  \u2022  Demand exists for micro- \nsustainable access to  increases at each  statements  and small-business \nfinance for micro- and  MFI and small- \u2022  Reporting specifically  loans \nsmall businesses in  business bank (by  requested by ADB  \u2022  MFIs do not breach \nADB\u2019s DMCs.  10% in next 24  domestic prudential or \nmonths)   central bank norms \n\u2022  Credit quality is high  \u2022  No adverse economic \nat the MFIs, with  developments in relevant \nNPL level of less  DMC economies \nthan 5%  \u2022  No regulatory changes \n\u2022  Net incomes at the  for banking or \nMFIs rise by 10%  microfinance industry  \nper year for the next  \u2022  No other external factors \n3 years  have a negative impact \n\u2022  MFIs\u2019 CAR remains  on banking or \nabove central bank  microfinance \nnorms  development  \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n  \u2022  Within the  \u2022  MFIs\u2019 quarterly and   \n1.
