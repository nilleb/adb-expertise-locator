The Project will also help strengthen the country\u2019s\ncapacity to manage the decentralized education system.\n\nin  primary  education \n\nto  and  participation \n\nin \n\nClassification\n\nPoverty intervention\nThematic: Human development/gender and development\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nCategory  C.  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed,  and  no\nsignificant adverse environmental impacts identified.\n\nRationale\n\nlimitations.  Much  remains \n\nA  population  educated  to  a  basic  level  of  literacy  and  numeracy  is\nessential  to  promote  socioeconomic  progress  and  promote  poverty\nreduction. Education in the Lao PDR has been improving, but still has\nmany \nthe\nGovernment\u2019s  target  of  universal  primary  education,  and  raise  the\nquality  of  education  to  standards  in  neighboring  countries.  Very  low\npublic  expenditure  on  education  has  been  a  major  constraint  to\nensuring continued, balanced growth in the education system, which\nis  characterized  by  inequitable  access  to  quality  basic  education,\nespecially primary education for the poor, girls, and ethnic minorities,\nand weak capacity to manage the system.\n\nto  be  done \n\nto  achieve \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  policy  priority  for  education  is  to  raise  the  quality\nand enhance the relevance of both primary and secondary education\nand  to  increase  participation  in  education,  particularly  of  girls  and\nethnic  minorities.  Improving  the  quality  of  teaching  competency  and\nthe  learning  environment  is  key  to  better  quality  education  and\nretaining  more  children  in  schools.  In  particular,  competent  teachers\nshould  be  encouraged  to  remain  in  the  profession  with  enhanced\ncareer  development  prospects.  About  16,300  of  27,600  primary\nschool  teachers  have  less  than  the  current  qualification  to  teach.  Of\nthese  16,300,  about  6,400  teachers  in  primary  education  are\nunqualified  and  have  no  teacher  training  at  all,  and  about  9,900\nteachers  are  underqualified.  At  the  lower  secondary  level,  about\n5,450 of 9,800 teachers are either unqualified or underqualified, and\nonly  about  30  percent  have  adequate  preservice  teacher  training\noffered  at  eight  teacher  training  colleges  (TTCs)  in  the  country.  The\nProject  will  develop  a  national  teacher  training  support  system,  and\nimplement  intensive  teacher  training  programs  in  selected  provinces\nand  districts.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  increased  access  to\nprimary  education  in  selected  underserved  areas  by  encouraging\nparticipation of students and support from communities, by providing\ntrained  teachers  on  a  sustainable  basis,  and  hence  by  ensuring\nquality  of  the  education  provided  in  the  schools.  The  Project  will\nespecially target the underserved ethnic minority areas where gender\n\n\fObjectives and\nScope\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\niii\n\ndisparities  in  access  to  and  retention  in  education  are  large.  The\nProject  will  also  support  the  Government\u2019s  plan  to  decentralize\neducation  management  by  providing  assistance \nto  develop\ninstitutional,  management,  and  project  implementation  capabilities  at\nthe central, provincial, district, and village levels.\n\nThe long term goal of the Project is to contribute to poverty reduction\nin the Lao PDR by helping the Government achieve quality education\nfor all children. In the medium term, the overall project objectives are\nto  (i)  improve  the  relevance,  quality,  and  efficiency  of  primary  and\nsecondary  education  by  developing  a  teacher  training  support\nsystem, developing a strategy to increase the number of female and\nethnic  minority  teachers,  enhancing  the  professional  status  and\nteachers,  constructing  and\ncareer  development  prospects  of \nupgrading  training  facilities,  and  delivering  intensive  teacher  training\nprograms  at  the  provincial  and  district  levels;  (ii) expand  access  to\nand improve retention in primary schools especially of girls and ethnic\nminority  children  in  the  poor,  underserved  areas  of  the  country;  and\n(iii) strengthen the institutional capacity of central, provincial, district,\nand  village \nthe\ndecentralized education system and implement the Project.\n\nto  plan  and  manage \n\nlevel  administrations \n\nThe  Project  will  develop  the  teacher  education  support  system\nincluding  schemes  to  enhance  career  development  prospects  and\nwelfare  of  teachers.  The  Project  will  operate  at  the  provincial  and\ndistrict  levels  in  selected  provinces  and  districts  to  deliver  integrated\npackages of activities to improve the quality of teaching and learning,\nand  access  to  and  participation  in  education.  These  integrated\npackages  include  (i)  in-service  teacher  training  and  upgrading  of\nuntrained teachers; (ii) school construction and rehabilitation; (iii) funds\nto  support  school  operation  and  maintenance,  finance  activities  to\nenhance learning in early grade classes and participation in education,\nand purchase books and learning materials.\n\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $37.6 million equivalent,\nincluding  taxes  and  duties,  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and\ninterest charge on the loan. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at\n$13.2  million,  or  35  percent  of  the  total  cost,  and  the  local  currency\ncost at $24.4 million equivalent, or 65 percent.\n\nForeign\nExchange\n8.4\n4.8\n-\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n11.6\n4.8\n8.0\n\nTotal\nCost\n20.0\n9.6\n8.0\n\n($ million)\n\nPercent\n53\n26\n21\n\nSource\nADB\nSida\nGovernment and \nCommunities\nTotal\n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  Sida  =  Swedish  International  Development\nCooperation Agency.\n\n13.2\n\n24.4\n\n37.6\n\n100\n\n\fiv\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a loan of $20 million\nequivalent from its Special Funds resources, with a term of 32 years,\nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years  and  an  interest  charge  of  1.0\npercent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period,  and  1.5  percent\nthereafter.  The  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation\nAgency  (Sida)  is  expected  to  provide  a  parallel  grant  of  about  $9.6\nmillion to cofinance the Project.\n\nPeriod of Utilization\n\nUntil 30 June 2008\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nMinistry of Education (MOE)\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nProcurement\n\nConsulting\nServices\n\nMOE  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  Project  coordination  and\nimplementation.  An  MOE  steering  committee  will  be  responsible  for\noverseeing  project  implementation.  A  project  implementation  unit\n(PIU)  will  be  established  within  MOE  to  implement  the  Project\nincluding  teacher  training,  development  programs,  and  other  project\nactivities.  The  provincial  PIUs  (PPIUs)  and  the  district  PIUs  (DPIUs)\nwill  be  set  up  in  the  provincial  education  services  (PESs)  and  the\ndistrict  education  bureaus  (DEBs)  to  coordinate,  plan,  implement,\nmonitor  and  supervise,  and  report  on  project  activities  at  the  these\nlevels.  The  PIU  will  also  coordinate  with  its  provincial  and  district\ncounterparts.\n\nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  for  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance\nwith  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  Each  contract  for  supply  of\ngoods, equipment, and materials estimated to cost $500,000 or more\nwill  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding\nprocedures, while contract packages of less than $500,000 equivalent\nwill  follow  international  shopping  procedures.  Contracts  less  than\n$100,000  may  be  procured  on  a  direct  purchase  basis.  Civil  works\ncontracts that are small and situated in remote areas are not likely to\nattract  the  interest  of  international  contractors.  Therefore,  civil  work\ncontracts less than $1.0 million will be awarded on the basis of local\ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  However,  if  any\npackage  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.0  million  or  more,  international\ncompetitive bidding procedures will be followed. For minor civil works\nto  improve  school  buildings  and  facilities  to  be  carried  out  by  local\ncommunities  costing  less  than  $10,000  equivalent  per  school,\nappropriate  procedures  satisfactory \nfor  community\nparticipation in procurement will be implemented.\n\nto  ADB \n\nAbout  205  person-months  of  international  consulting  (47  person-\nmonths financed by ADB and 158 person-months by Sida), and 1,671\nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting \n(1,512  person-months\nfinanced by ADB and 159 person-months by Sida) will be engaged to\nsupport  capacity  building  at  the  MOE  technical  departments,  PESs,\nand  DEBs  involved  in  Project  activities.  Local  contract  staff  will  be\nengaged  for  a  total  of  1,014  person-months  to  support  project\nimplementation  (678  person-months  financed  by  ADB  and  336\nperson-months  by  Sida).  All  consultants  and  local  contract  staff\nfinanced  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  selected  and  engaged  by  the\nGovernment  through  a  firm  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on\n\n\f31 December 2007\n\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\nProject Benefits and\nBeneficiaries\n\nv\n\nthe Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB\non \nthe  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Sida-financed\nconsultants will be engaged by Sida according to Sida procedures.\n\nMany teachers will benefit from new and improved training programs.\nThe beneficiaries will include (i) over 2,000 TTC graduates annually,\nwho  will  acquire  teaching  skills;  (ii)  2,400  unqualified  teachers  who\nwill be trained and become qualified and able to teach their students\nbetter; and (iii) approximately 15,000 primary school teachers, 2,500\nprimary school principals, 3,000 secondary school teachers, and 500\nsecondary  school  principals  who  will  take  part  in  regular  in-service\ntraining,  which  will  benefit  their  pupils  and  lead  to  enhanced\nperformance. This covers 55 percent of primary school teachers and\n30 percent of secondary school teachers in the country. In addition, a\ntotal  of  365  TTC  trainers,  108  teacher-upgrading  program  trainers,\n473 primary school pedagogical advisers, and 144 secondary school\npedagogical advisers will be trained on a regular and repeated basis.\nThis  will  in  turn  ensure  the  quality  of  the  preservice,  upgrading,  and\nin-service  training  programs.  TTC  management  staff  will  be  given\ntraining  and  on-the-job  support  by  consultants  to  enable  them  to\nmanage their colleges more effectively and efficiently.\n\nThe Project will increase the opportunity for children in 41 districts in\nfour provinces to receive a full five-year primary education by building\napproximately  45  classrooms  in  each  district.  The  Project  will  also\nensure  that  more  children  finish  primary  education  of  reasonable\nquality  than  now  by  providing  teacher  training  programs.  More  than\n400,000  primary  students  will  be  studying  in  the  project-assisted\nschools  by  the  end  of  the  Project,  of  whom  about  30,000  will  be  in\nnewly constructed or newly completed primary schools. In addition, in\n29 districts where teacher training alone will be implemented, another\n150,000  primary  and  secondary  students  will  benefit  from  improved\neducation  quality.  Girls  and  ethnic  minority  children  will  especially\nbenefit  both  through  geographical  targeting  and  special  assistance\nprovided  by  the  Project.  The  Project  will  ensure  that  the  education\nsystem  becomes  more  responsive  to  local  needs.  Project  inputs  will\nbe made to strengthen the management capacity of MOE, PESs, and\nDEBs.  Staff  of  MOE,  PESs,  and  DEBs  will  be  given  considerable\ntraining  in  data  collection,  planning,  implementation,  monitoring  and\nsupervising, and reporting of project activities.\n\n\fv\ni\n\f1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\nloan  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for  the  Second  Education  Quality\nImprovement Project.\n\nI. \n\nPROPOSAL\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  initiated  support  for  the  education  system  of  the\n2.\nLao PDR with an education sector study in 1989.1 Subsequently, ADB has provided three loans\nto the sector.2 ADB continued its sector and investment planning support in 1998 by helping the\nGovernment prepare the five-year (2001-2005) Education Sector Development Plan (ESDP).3 In\npursuing the recommendations of the ESDP, the Government asked ADB to provide a loan to\nfinance  the  proposed  Second  Education  Quality  Improvement  Project.  A  project  preparatory\ntechnical assistance (TA) for the Project was implemented from August 2000 to February 2001.4\nA  joint  fact-finding  mission  by  ADB  and  the  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation\nAgency  (Sida)  was  undertaken  from  26  March  to  11  April  2001.5  An  appraisal  mission  was\nfielded from 4 to 15 June 2001.6 This report is based on Government inputs, the ESDP, the TA\nreport,  and  the  agreements  reached  during  the  loan  fact-finding  and  appraisal  missions.  To\nreach a consensus on the project design, consultations and coordination were held throughout\nthe project processing period with Government officials in the Ministry of Education (MOE) and\nother  relevant  ministries,  officials  at  provincial  and  district  levels,  multilateral  and  bilateral\nassistance  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  such  as  the  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union\n(LWU)  and  Lao  Front  for  National  Construction,  and  other  stakeholders  including  community\nmembers,  school  principals,  teachers,  parents,  and  students.  The  project  framework  is  in\nAppendix 1.\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nSocioeconomic Context and Poverty Issues\n\n3.\nThe total population of the Lao PDR, estimated to be 4.95 million in 1998, is growing at\nan  annual  rate  of  2.8  percent.  The  country  is  truly  multiethnic,  with  49  ethnic  groups.\nGeographically, the Lao PDR is a rural and often isolated society with still limited infrastructure.\nOnly  17  percent  of  the  population  live  in  urban  areas.  Most  (81  percent)  rural  villages  are\nwithout  electricity  and  only  9  percent  have  regular  access  to  market.  Forty-one  percent  of  the\nvillages are located more than 6 kilometers from a main road; only 44 percent can be reached\n\n                  \n\n1 TA 1130-LAO: Education Sector Study, for $380,000, approved on 14 February 1989.\n2 Loan 1103-LAO: Education Quality Improvement Project, for $13.3 million, approved on 26 September 1991 and\nclosed  in  December  1998;  Loan  1374-LAO:  Postsecondary Education Rationalization Project,  for  $20.0  million,\napproved on 19 September 1995; and Loan 1621-LAO: Basic Education (Girls) Project, for $20.0 million, approved\non 25 June 1998.\n\n3 TA 3014-LAO: Education Sector Development Plan, for $530,000, approved on 7 May 1998.\n4 TA 3294-LAO: Second Education Quality Improvement Project, for $600,000, approved on 10 November 1999.\n5 The  Mission  comprised:  Y.  Hirosato,  Education  Specialist,  Mission  Leader;  S.  Tanaka,  Social  Development\nSpecialist; M. Fujimura, Economist; N. Nishioka, Young Professional; R. Govinda, Consultant, Sida; and A. Flinck,\nConsultant, Sida. The Lao Resident Mission supported the Mission.\n\n6 The  Mission  comprised:  Y.  Hirosato,  Education  Specialist,  Mission  Leader;  M.  Good,  Counsel;  E.  Bloom,\nEconomist,  Staff  Consultant;  and  N.  Nishioka,  Young  Professional.  G.H.  Kim,  Program  Officer,  and  the  Lao\nResident Mission assisted the Mission. D. Vongsay, Sr. Program Officer, Sida, joined the Mission.\n\n\f2\n\nby truck in the rainy season compared with 75 percent in the dry season. Agriculture contributes\nover 50 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and is the occupation of a large part of the\nworkforce.\n\n4.\nIn 1986, the Government began to transform the economy from a centrally planned to a\nmarket-oriented system. The adoption of the New Economic Mechanism in 1986 promoted less\ndirect  state  involvement  in  the  economy  and  encouraged  greater  reliance  on  market\nmechanisms. Structural reforms have taken place so that market forces are now at work in most\nsegments  of  the  economy.  Initially,  the  economy  performed  quite  well,  with  real  GDP  growing\nannually at 5 to 8 percent during 1992-1997; the service and industry sectors were the largest\ncontributors  to  GDP  growth.  However,  in  1997,  economic  conditions  began  to  deteriorate,\nlargely  because  of  the  regional  economic  crisis.  In  1998  and  well  into  1999,  conditions\ncontinued to deteriorate: new investments fell drastically; tax receipts, in terms of the purchasing\npower of the kip, declined substantially. In early 2000, the value of the kip against the dollar was\nonly 15 percent of what it had been in 1996/97. The real economy such as agriculture was not\nso  affected  by  the  crisis,  but  growth  in  services  and  industry  slowed  considerably.  At  present,\nthe  economy  seems  to  have  stabilized  and  inflation  has  slowed  to  a  manageable  level.  The\neconomy is expected to regain previously reached rates of growth.\n\n5.\nThe country can be best described as a subsistence society in which members of each\nhousehold usually carry out several activities to make a living. Based on data from the 1997/98\nLao  expenditure  and  consumption  survey  II,  a  recent  ADB-Lao  PDR  joint  study  estimates  the\naverage  total  (food  and  nonfood)  poverty  line  to  equal  KN19,184  per  person  per  month  in\n1997/98  prices.7  Using  this  poverty  line,  the  aggregate  poverty  incidence  is  estimated  at  38.6\npercent (down from 45 percent in 1992/93). The highest incidence of poverty is in the Northern\nRegion at 52.5 percent, followed by the Southern Region at 38.4 percent and Central Region at\n34.9  percent.  The  country  as  a  whole  is  poor  because  of  its  limited  ability  to  develop  its\nresources and low levels of labor productivity. The distribution of the low base national income\nis quite even by international standards. However, the degree of inequality is increasing. While\nstrict  causality  analysis  is  difficult,  inequality  in  basic  education  opportunities  is  contributing\nsignificantly to the growing inequality. Indeed, the country is in danger of falling into a poverty\ntrap  because  of  disparities  in  access  to  education  and  in  the  quality  of  education  that  is\navailable.\n\n6.\nOver 37 percent of females and 22 percent of males have no formal education. Lack of\neducation seriously limits the advancement of women and hence inhibits family planning, child\ncare,  and  basic  health  care  in  the  family.  The  high  illiteracy  rate  for  women,  estimated  at  52\npercent  compared  with  27  percent  for  men  (for  the  15  and  older  population),  is  a  significant\nfactor  causing  the  poor  social  indicators,  especially  the  high  rates  of  maternal  mortality  and\nmortality for children under five years old. The gender gap in education is also significant among\nethnic minorities, for example, among the Hmong-Yao with the female illiteracy rate at about 92\npercent.8  The  first  step  to  address  the  needs  of  the  vast  majority  of  people  for  literacy  and\nnumeracy  is  to  provide  complete  primary  education.  This  is  a  great  challenge:  getting  more\nchildren  into  primary  education,  helping  children  stay  in  school  and  successfully  learn  their\nlessons,  and  providing  them  with  primary  schools  offering  all  five  grades  so  that  they  can\ncomplete  primary  education.  Meeting  this  challenge  will  require  significant  resources  and  a\ngreat deal of effort to provide enough complete schools and the appropriate teaching and school\nresources.  Moreover,  the  poorer  provinces  lack  textbooks  and  access  to  better-qualified\nteachers.  As  a  result,  students  in  these  provinces  have  lower  student  performance  rates,\nalongside higher dropout and lower enrollment rates.\n\n                  \n\n7 Kakwani,  Nanak,  Bounthavy  Sisouphanhthong,  Phonesaly  Souksavath,  and  Brent  Dark.  ,  2001.,  Poverty  in  Lao\n\nPDR., Aa paper presented at Asia and Pacific Forum on Poverty, Manila.\n\n8 National Statistical Center. 1996.

Vientiane.\n\n\f3\n\n2.\n\nEducation System, Administration, and Financing\n\n7.\nThe  education  system  consists  of  preschool  (ages  of  3-5),  five  years  of  primary\neducation, three years of lower secondary education, three years of upper secondary education,\none  to  two  years  of  postsecondary-nontertiary  education,  and  three  to  seven  years  of  tertiary\neducation.  Curriculum  specialization  starts  in  upper  secondary  where  three  programs  are\noffered (general-academic, vocational, and teacher training) and increases at the tertiary level.\nMOE  has  responsibility  for  policy  direction,  coordination,  and  planning,  as  well  as  for  quality\ncontrol  of  formal  and  nonformal  education.  Administrative  responsibility  for  primary  education\nlies with the district education bureaus (DEBs), whereas responsibility for secondary education\nlies with the provincial education services (PESs). The country is composed of 18 provinces and\nequivalent,9  which  are  in  turn  organized  into  141  districts  and  about  12,000  villages.  An\nimportant prime ministerial decree on decentralization, issued in March 2000, applies to all the\nsocioeconomic  sectors  including  education,  and  foresees  the  province  as  a  strategic  unit,  the\ndistrict as a planning and budgeting unit, and the village as a basic implementation unit, while\nthe role of the central Government will be to supervise and control the decentralization process.\nThis decree has far-reaching implications for the management of education. The capacity of the\nPESs,  DEBs,  villages,  and  communities  should  be  strengthened  for  planning,  budgeting,\nimplementing,  and  monitoring  tasks  allocated  to  them,  while  MOE\u2019s  capacity  to  supervise  and\ncontrol the education system also needs to be strengthened.\n\n8.\nIn  particular,  the  allocation  of  budget  has  been  passed  to  the  provinces  and  districts.\nWhile  the  ultimate  budgetary  control  rests  with  the  National  Assembly,  the  provincial\ngovernments and district administrations are now assigned greater responsibility for education\nfinancing. The education budget allocation in each province depends on the province\u2019s priorities\nand its ability to raise additional resources for education. The provincial governor has authority\nfor  reallocating,  authorizing,  and  revising  both  capital  and  recurrent  expenditure  including\nteachers\u2019 salaries. However, for those provinces dependent on financial transfer, the Ministry of\nFinance and MOE determine the overall amount to be transferred, following consultations with\neach province.\n\n3.\n\nPrimary Education\n\n9.\nAccess  to  primary  education  is  not  guaranteed  for  all  children,  especially  for  girls  in\nethnic  minority  areas;  dropout  and  repetition  rates  remain  high.  In  1999/2000,  the  gross\nenrollment  rate  in  primary  school  for  the  country  is  estimated  at  109  percent  (117  percent  for\nboys and 100 percent for girls), indicating large overage enrollments and high repetition across\nall five grades. The net enrollment rate is estimated at around 77 percent in primary education,\nwith large disparities between provinces, and across gender and ethnic groups, with the ratio at\n35  percent  in  rural  remote  areas.  In  1999/00,  above  831,000  students  were  enrolled  in  about\n8,160  primary  schools,  only  19  percent  of  which  are  in  good  condition,  and  54  percent  are\nincomplete, offering only the first three grades or less.\n\nThe  primary  education  system  is  highly  inefficient;  only  41  percent  of  boys  and  37\n10.\npercent of girls entering primary education complete the five-year cycle; more than nine years of\nteaching are required to produce a graduate with five years of primary education. In 1999/2000,\ngrade  1  had  the  highest  dropout  (16.2  percent)  and  repetition  (33.9  percent)  rates,  leading  to\nexcessively  large  classes  in  the  early  grades.  The  large  number  of  incomplete  schools  is  an\nimportant  factor,  but  other  factors  include  families  giving  higher  priority  to  boys\u2019  education,\nkeeping  girls  at  home  to  care  for  younger  siblings,  and  keeping  children  at  home  to  help  with\n\n9 Including Xaisomboun Special Zone and Vientiane Municipality as \u201cprovinces.\u201d\n\n                  \n\n\f4\n\nfamily work. In ethnic minority areas, language is another barrier to participation in education, as\nthe  majority  of  inhabitants  do  not  speak  the  national  Lao  language,  which  is  the  language  of\ninstruction at school. This contributes to the high dropout and repetition rates in ethnic minority\nareas.  Compared  with  boys,  girls  are  not  equally  represented  in  their  participation  in  primary\neducation. Over the country as a whole, the proportion is 55:45 (boys:girls). The gender-ethnic\nminority disparity in participation in primary education is profound in remote areas and among\nethnic  minorities,  with  primary  education  boy:girl  ratios  of  62:38  in  upland  areas,  and  71:29  in\nhighland areas.\n\nThe  poor  quality  of  education  in  many  schools  compounds  the  problem.  Although  the\n11.\nsystem  has  no  overall  shortage  of  primary  school  teachers,  with  an  average  student-teacher\nratio across the country of 30:1, rural areas lack teachers. Trained or certified teachers tend to\nconcentrate  in  urban  or  semiurban  areas.  The  areas  with  the  highest  percentage  (up  to  70\npercent)  of  untrained  or  unqualified  teachers  are  the  remote,  mountainous  areas  with  high\nethnic minority populations. Due to the generally low educational status of women, the supply of\nfemale teachers in primary education lags behind male teachers; far fewer female teachers are\navailable in remote, mountainous areas. However, many teachers in incomplete schools teach\nmore than one class through multigrade teaching. The encouragement of multigrade teaching is\nan important government initiative to mitigate the problem of incomplete schools.\n\n4.\n\nSecondary Education\n\n12.\nSecondary  education  is  the  fastest  growing  segment  of  the  education  system.  From\n1996/97 to 1999/2000, enrollment in primary schools increased by about 45,000 students or 1.9\npercent  per  year,  while  enrollment  in  lower  secondary  education  increased  by  about  50,000\nstudents or 11.1 percent per year and upper secondary education by about 31,000 students or\n18.6 percent per year. This rapid enrollment growth is putting pressure on classroom facilities,\nteacher  supply,  and  availability  of \ninstructional  materials.  Currently,\napproximately  70  percent  of  the  children  graduating  from  primary  school  continue  on  to  lower\nsecondary school. The geographic availability of secondary education is much more limited than\nprimary  education.  Secondary  schools  are  generally  located  in  larger  towns,  and  generally\nfewer schools are in rural areas.\n\ntextbooks  and \n\n5.\n\nPostsecondary-Nontertiary Education, and Tertiary Education\n\n13.\nOne  to  two  years  of  postsecondary-nontertiary  education  are  provided  by  23  midlevel\ntechnical  colleges,  which  are  available  to  students  who  have  completed  upper  secondary\neducation.  Eleven  of  these  are  under  direct  MOE  administration;  the  rest  are  established  and\noperated by other ministries. Three to seven years of tertiary education is offered at the National\nUniversity  of  Laos  (NUOL),  which  was  formed  in  1995  by  consolidating  three  postsecondary\ninstitutions. By mid-1998, an additional 10 colleges were merged into NUOL. ADB assisted the\nprocess  of  amalgamation  and  consolidation  of  NUOL  under  the  Postsecondary  Education\nRationalization Project (footnote 2). The overall number of tertiary education students is still less\nthan  10,000.  The  Lao  PDR  has  the  lowest  per  capita  enrollment  in  tertiary  education  in  the\nregion  with  less  than  2  percent  of  Lao  children  progressing  through  secondary  school  to\nuniversity.\n\n6.\n\nTeacher Education and Training\n\n14.\nThe  59  small  teacher  training  colleges  and  schools  spread  around  the  country  and\nrunning largely without a standardized curriculum were consolidated into eight teacher training\ncolleges (TTCs) under the ADB-funded Education Quality Improvement Project (EQIP) (footnote\n2).  These  eight  TTCs  now  comprise  five  TTCs  that  train  teachers  for  both  primary  and  lower\n\n\f5\n\nsecondary schools, one TTC that trains both preprimary and primary school teachers, and two\nTTCs  that  train  primary  school  teachers.  The  TTCs  provide  two  training  courses  for  primary\nschool  teachers  comprising  (i)  a  three-year  training  program  for  those  who  have  completed\neight  years  of  schooling  (8+3);  and  (ii)  a  one-year  course  for  those  who  have  completed  11\nyears of schooling (11+1).\n\n15.\nAbout  16,300  of  the  27,600  primary  school  teachers  have  less  than  the  current\nqualification to teach, which is eight years of schooling (up to lower secondary) and three years\npreservice  training  (8+3)  or  11  years  of  schooling  (up  to  upper  secondary)  and  one  year\npreservice  training  (11+1).  Of  these  16,300,  about  6,400  teachers  in  primary  education  are\nunqualified and have no teacher training at all, and about 9,900 teachers are underqualified. At\nthe  lower  secondary  level,  about  5,450  of  the  7,800  teachers  are  either  unqualified  or\nunderqualified,  and  only  about  30  percent  of  teachers  have  adequate  preservice  teacher\ntraining  of  11  years  of  schooling  and  three  years  of  preservice  training  (11+3).  Teachers  for\nupper  secondary  schools  are  trained  at  the  Faculty  of  Education  at  NUOL  after  11  years  of\nprimary and secondary education (11+5).\n\n16.\nThree  types  of  teacher  training  programs  are  available:  preservice  teacher  training,\nteacher upgrading, and in-service teacher training. Preservice teacher training refers to teacher\ntraining  at  the  eight  TTCs  for  preprimary,  primary,  and  lower  secondary;  and  NUOL  for  the\nupper secondary level. Teacher upgrading refers to the teacher upgrading program (TUP) using\nthe network teacher upgrading centers (NTUCs) for teachers who are already teaching but who\nare  unqualified  or  have  no  preservice  training.  In-service  teacher  training  is  offered  to  current\nteachers  to  improve  their  knowledge  and  skills  by  the  teacher  development  center  (TDC),\nprovincial  pedagogical  advisers  (PAs)  for  secondary  schools,  and  district  PAs  and  a  school\ncluster system for primary schools.\n\n17.\nHowever, the delivery of preservice, upgrading, and in-service teacher training has been\nfragmented and disconnected. Capable, motivated, and well-trained teachers, who are essential\ningredients in quality education, are in critically short supply. The shortage of qualified teachers\nis  aggravated  by  the  adverse  employment  conditions  for  teachers  including  low  and  irregular\npay, often difficult work locations, poor career prospects, and poor training facilities. Approaches\nto improving teacher training include increasing the quality and relevance of preservice teacher\ntraining, expanding in-service teacher training, ensuring a sufficient supply of qualified teachers\nby providing adequate teacher compensation, creating professional development opportunities,\nupgrading  teacher  training  institutions,  and  strengthening  MOE\u2019s  capacity  to  support  teacher\ntraining and development systems.\n\n6.\n\nMajor Issues\n\nThe  many  educational  accomplishments  in  the  Lao  PDR  over  the  last  decade  include\n18.\nsystem expansion in enrollments at primary, secondary, postsecondary-nontertiary, and tertiary\nlevels;  clarification  of  roles,  responsibilities,  and  internal  structures  of  MOE,  PESs,  and  DEBs;\nconsolidation and rationalization of institutions of teacher and tertiary education; development of\nnew curriculum and instructional programs for primary and lower secondary schools; production\nand  national  distribution  of  new \nlearning  materials;\nimplementation  of  in-service  teacher  training  programs;  and  appointment  of  PAs  for  primary\nschools  in  each  district  and  for  secondary  schools  in  each  province.  At  the  community  and\nschool  levels,  several  innovations  have  been  encouraged;  for  example,  school  clusters  are\nbeing  piloted  to  support  teacher  professional  development  activities  and  the  sharing  of\nresources at the primary and secondary levels; and multigrade teaching has been introduced to\nrespond to the demand from rural, remote, and mountainous areas.\n\nteacher  guides,  and \n\ntextbooks, \n\n\f6\n\n19.\nHowever,  several  significant  issues  remain  to  be  resolved  for  education  sector\ndevelopment.  The  size  and  structure  of  the  education  budget  are  inadequate  to  ensure\ncontinued, balanced growth in the sector. A barrier to success for many children lies in the low\nquality  of  teacher  competencies  and  learning  environment  in  primary  schools.  Key  issues  are\nrelated  to  (i)  teacher  training  curriculum,  textbooks,  and  teaching  materials;  (ii) dropouts  and\nrepetitions  at  early  grades;  (iii)  teacher  qualifications  and  training  programs;  (iv) teacher\nincentives, including salaries, and career structures; and (v) TTC facilities. In addition, access to\nprimary education is not guaranteed for all children, and is especially limited for girls in ethnic\nminority areas. The education system is also constrained by inadequate numbers of staff with\nmanagement capacity to administer the system.\n\na.\n\nFinancing\n\nPrior  to  the  1997  economic  crisis,  the  education  budget  as  a  portion  of  Government\n20.\nexpenditure reached 15.2 percent and its share of GDP was 3.2 percent in FY1996/97, which\ncompared  reasonably  well  with  other  Asian  countries  at  a  similar  level  of  development.\nHowever,  the  current  size  of  the  education  budget,  which  fell  below  8  percent  of  total\nGovernment  expenditures  and  was  around  1.6  percent  of  GDP  during  1998  to  2000,  is\ninadequate  to  ensure  continued,  balanced  growth  in  the  sector.  In  addition,  while  capital\ninvestment  in  the  sector  has  been  considerable  over  the  past  few  years,  this  has  not  been\nbalanced by the necessary recurrent expenditure needed to maintain and support the operation\nof these investments. The recurrent budget share of education expenditures in recent years was\naround 50 to 55 percent, much lower than the 70 percent of neighboring Asian countries. As a\nresult, teacher wages remain low, and little or no recurrent budgets are provided to schools to\nsupport  day-to-day  teaching  and  learning  activities,  and  everyday  maintenance.  To  promote\nequitable  growth  of  the  education  system  with  improved  relevance,  quality,  and  efficiency,\nrecurrent expenditures on education, including teacher salaries and school maintenance, must\nbe substantially increased. However, following the prime ministerial decree on decentralization\nin March 2000, the situation will be exacerbated in terms of regional disparities in the provision\nof education services. To mitigate the situation, the current budget transfer system in support of\n\u201cdeficit\u201d  provinces  and  districts  needs  to  be  improved  to  ensure  equity  of  service  provision.\nSchools receive assistance from local communities, and small fees and other contributions from\nparents.  Local  contributions  are  likely  to  be  very  important,  but  only  to  complement  the\nGovernment budget. Such contributions cannot replace what should be an adequate recurrent\nbudget  from  the  central  and  provincial  government  authorities,  particularly  in  remote  or  low\nincome areas.\n\nb.\n\nTeacher Training Curriculum, Textbooks, and Teaching Materials\n\n21.\nA  new  curriculum  for  primary  and  lower  secondary  schools  was  developed  in  1993  by\nthe National Research Institute for Education Sciences (NRIES); the number of subjects to be\ntaught  was  reduced  from  12  to  7.  However,  copies  of  this  curriculum  have  yet  to  reach  most\nteachers in service. Even the trainers at the TTCs do not often have access to the curriculum.\nNew  textbooks  and  teaching  materials  were  also  produced  to  support  the  curriculum  over  the\npast  few  years.  Although  initiatives  are  under  way  to  ensure  that  schools  receive  these\ntextbooks  and  materials,  most  schools  appear  to  be  operating  with  few  or  no  textbooks  and\nother teaching materials. The upper secondary school curriculum has not yet been revised nor\nhave new materials been developed.\n\n22.\nThe existing courses in the TTCs were formulated during the EQIP. However, the quality\nof  the  courses  is  limited  by  a  predominance  of  theoretical  instruction  and  lack  of  practical\nexperience in the relevant levels of education among the college teaching staff. As a result, few\nstudents  are  adequately  prepared  for  their  careers.  TDC  carried  out  curriculum  reform  for\n\n\f7\n\nteacher education during the EQIP. The adequacy and suitability of this arrangement must now\nbe  examined  and  a  stable  arrangement  needs  to  be  created  for  continuous  renewal  of  the\nteacher training curriculum and materials. This effort should be closely coordinated with school-\nlevel programs implemented by MOE\u2019s Department of General Education (DGE).\n\nc.\n\nDropout and Repetition of Early Grades\n\n23.\nThe  unsatisfactory  quality  of  basic  education  is  resulting  in  high  dropout  and  repetition\nrates. In 1999/2000, more than 50 percent of children repeated grades 1 and 2. This is reflected\nin the class size, where in many schools grades 1 and 2 are twice the size of other classes. No\nteacher can be expected to effectively teach such a large number of children in one class. The\ncurriculum  needs  to  be  flexible  to  meet  local  needs.  In  particular,  expecting  the  same  level  of\nliteracy performance from ethnic minority children as from those with Lao as a native language\nis not realistic. Attempts should be made to make education in the early grades more relevant,\nsuitable,  and  attainable  for  these  children.  Furthermore,  as  grades  1  and  2  are  the  basic\nbuilding  blocks  on  which  the  foundation  of  the  education  system  are  built,  primary  school\nteacher  training  should  focus  on  improving  teaching  at  early  grades.  Consideration  should  be\nalso given to preschool education and its teacher training, especially in remote, rural areas.\n\nd.\n\nTeacher Qualifications and Training Programs\n\n24.\nThe  TTC  system  alone  is  unable  to  satisfy  the  country\u2019s  needs  for  primary  school\nteachers. To cover the shortages, schools and communities in rural areas are allowed to recruit\nunqualified teachers locally. Unqualified teachers are concentrated in rural, remote areas, where\nthey  often  constitute  more  than  40  percent  of  the  teaching  force.  The  official  figures  do  not\ninclude many other unqualified teachers employed as volunteers by communities. The issue of\nnonavailability  of  qualified  teachers  requires  in-depth  analysis  considering  the  available\npreservice training facilities, the performance of existing TTCs, and posttraining career paths of\nthe  trainees  at  the  TTCs.  The  shortage  of  qualified  teachers  must  also  be  analyzed  in  a\ndisaggregated  manner  to  identify  specific  localities  where  only  unqualified  teachers  are\navailable  and  the  linkage  with  the  student  completion  rates  in  secondary  school,  which\ndetermine the availability of potential teachers for primary schools.\n\n25.\nTo  counter  the  existing  problem  of  unqualified  primary  teachers,  MOE  established  the\nTUP  using  the  NTUCs  with  support  from  assistance  agencies,  including  the  United  Nations\nChildren\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  and  NGOs.  The  program,  which  is  the  responsibility  of  MOE\u2019s\nDepartment of Teacher Training (DTT), allows unqualified teachers to be trained during holiday\nperiods,  allowing  them  to  carry  out  their  usual  duties  during  school  time.  At  the  end  of  the\nprogram, the participants become certified teachers. In seven years, about 4,000 primary school\nteachers have been upgraded through the NTUC approach, but despite this achievement, over\n6,400  unqualified  primary  teachers  still  remain  in  the  system.  MOE  has  responded  very\nfavorably  to  the  TUP.  Assistance  agencies  recommend  it  as  a  model  to  be  developed  for  a\nnationwide in-service teacher training program including further upgrading.\n\nVery  few  opportunities  are  available  to  teachers  to  upgrade  their  knowledge  and  skills\n26.\nonce they have started teaching. The provincial authorities have appointed PAs for secondary\nschools, and the district authorities have appointed PAs for primary schools to provide on-the-\njob  support  to  teachers.  However,  lack  of  funding  severely  limits  the  amount  of  support  they\nactually give. A school cluster system has been developed involving master teachers recruited\nfrom  experienced  teachers;  this  system  reaches  approximately  25  percent  of  the  country\u2019s\nprimary  schools  and  gives  access  to  on-the-job  professional  development  for  teachers.  Many\nschool clusters are supported by assistance agencies. The impact of the clusters on teachers,\nstudents,  school  facilities,  and  school  community  relations  has  been  assessed  as  positive  in\n\n\f8\n\nterms  of  improved  student  performance,  increased  participation  and  completion  rates,  and\ndecreased  number  of  dropouts.  However,  the  distance  between  many  schools  prevents  the\nmore widespread adoption of the cluster system, unless alternative models are adopted.\n\ne.\n\nTeacher Incentives and Career Structures\n\n27.\nAt present, the teaching profession is characterized by low status and salaries. Teachers\neverywhere  have  second  jobs  to  increase  their  incomes,  often  significantly.  Compared  with\ncountries  in  the  region  with  a  similar  level  of  development,  teachers\u2019  salaries  are  low  with  a\nrelatively flat salary scale. Thirty years are required for a teacher to progress from the bottom of\neach  salary  grade  to  the  top,  and  financial  incentives  to  participate  in  teacher  training  are\nminimal. Promotions and transfers are unpredictable, and often based on judgement or criteria\nother than competencies. Policies are in place for incentive payments for teachers who work in\nremote  areas,  but  payment  of  these  incentives  is  irregular.  Teachers  in  remote  areas  often\ndepend on the community in which they work to meet their basic needs. No formal certification\nsystem is in place for preservice, upgrading, or in-service training, and therefore no mechanism\nto  ensure  consistent  quality  of  preservice,  upgrading,  and  in-service  teacher  training  curricula.\nCompletion  of  the  TUP  and  preservice  training  at  the  TTCs  is  linked  to  teacher  incentives\nincluding salaries, while in-service training is not.\n\nf.\n\nTeacher Training College Facilities\n\n28.\nThe TTC facilities are incomplete. In some cases, the facilities were designed based on\ninadequate standards. This has resulted in a shortage of dormitories and teachers\u2019 residences\nin some TTCs, and in unsanitary conditions where water supplies do not work satisfactorily and\ntoilet  and  bathrooms  cannot  be  used.  The  shortage  of  recurrent  budget  from  the  Government\ncompounds  the  problem.  The  classrooms  and  other  facilities  have  not  been  maintained\nproperly. The living conditions for teachers and students must be improved as a priority. Some\nof the TTCs, notably Pakse and Louang Phrabang TTCs, are at their own initiative developing\ncourses  outside  the  preservice  training  area  to  supplement  the  revenues  of  the  colleges  and\nstaff incomes. However, most TTCs are poorly managed and the teacher training offered is less\nthan adequate standard.\n\ng.\n\nAccess to and Participation in Primary Education\n\n29.\nAbout 4,000 villages, which are mostly in remote and mountainous ethnic minority areas,\nhave  no  primary  schools.  Fifty-four  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  8,150  primary  schools  are\nincomplete, with the majority offering two years of primary education or less. In some cases, the\nintroduction  of  multigrade  education  can  make  education  available  to  additional  grades,  and\nmany  two  or  three  classroom  multigrade  schools  are  being  constructed  in  rural  and  ethnic\nminority areas. Existing incomplete schools need to be improved to enable children to complete\nfive  years  of  primary  education.  Resources  can  be  used  more  efficiently  so  that  participation\nrates  are  expected  to  rise  by  33  percent.  In  addition,  a  sense  of  ownership  and  community\nsupport  for  schools  is  increasingly  viewed  as  important.  The  community  is  the  key  party  in\nschool  construction  and  support  for  the  continued  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  school\ngiven the low level of Government financial support.\n\n30.\nOnly  a  small  proportion  of  existing  primary  school  buildings  are  made  from  permanent\nbuilding materials, with floors and walls of solid construction and normally corrugated iron roofs.\nMany more buildings are semipermanent, which means they have a solid framework and floors,\nand corrugated iron roofs; the walls are normally of wood or occasionally woven bamboo. Over\nhalf  the  buildings  are  of  a  temporary  nature,  with  dirt  floors,  woven  bamboo  walls,  and  often\n\n\f9\n\nthatched roofs. The condition of the furniture and blackboards in most classrooms is very poor\nand in short supply.\n\nh.\n\nManagement of Education\n\nBased  on  the  Government\u2019s  decree  on  decentralization  issued  in  March  2000,  MOE\n31.\nplans to decentralize the education management structure to improve efficiency of the system.\nThis decentralization process needs to be accompanied by an appropriate legal and regulatory\nframework, clear delegation of responsibility, training of personnel, and availability of resources\nat each administrative level. At the MOE level, responsibilities are distributed in a way that leads\nto competing programs between technical departments. MOE has a huge workload in running\nseveral major projects with only a few adequately qualified staff. The situation is exacerbated by\novercentralized  management  systems  that  lead  to  delays  and  inefficiencies  in  implementing\nactivities. Future projects can only be implemented successfully if (i) sufficient competent staff\nand  resources  are  available  to  plan  and  implement  activities,  and  (ii) bureaucratic  procedures\nare streamlined so that decision making and budgets are delegated to the level where activities\nare to be implemented.\n\n32.\nSome  functions  have  already  been  delegated  to  lower  administrative  levels.  Provincial\nunits  for  construction  and  development  assistance  (PUCDAs)  were  set  up  to  manage  the\nprovincial  construction  programs.  Many  communities  already  build  and  support  their  own\nschools, even providing their own teachers. Districts allocate teachers to primary schools, and\nthrough  the  primary  school  PAs  and  school  clusters,  deliver  in-service  training  programs  for\nteachers on an ad hoc basis. However, these lower levels of administration do not have control\nof  budgets,  nor  do  they  often  have  the  authority  and  capacity  to  enable  them  to  manage  and\ndevelop their own programs. In particular, DEB staff generally have to work in primitive buildings\nwith  earth  floors  and  bamboo  walls  with  few  resources  to  back  them  up.  DEBs  often  lack\ncapacity in data analysis as well as the quality of data to support the planning, budgeting, and\nimplementation of programs.\n\n33.\nAt the school level, the small amount of resources given to schools severely limits their\nability  to  take  initiatives  unless  the  community  gives  assistance.  Due  to  low  salaries,  the\nenergies of teachers and principals are often channeled into second and third jobs rather than\ntheir  schools  and  the  children  they  teach.  Many  incomplete  schools  do  not  have  a  school\nprincipal who can take the lead in managing the school\u2019s resources. Necessary actions include\n(i) increasing resource allocations to schools to enable them to improve their schools; (ii) giving\nmanagement responsibility to teachers in each incomplete school; and (iii) providing training on\nproactive  school  management  to  school  principals  and  teachers  responsible  for  incomplete\nschools  and  to  community  representatives.  This  all  needs  to  be  accompanied  by  substantial\nincreases in teachers\u2019 and principals\u2019 incentives, including salaries.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\nThe ESDP has helped identify sectorwide priorities for policy reforms and investments.10\n34.\nDrawing on the ESDP, MOE produced the education strategic vision which provides a long-term\nvision  until  2020  and  a  framework  for  continued  development  of  the  education  sector.11  The\neducation strategic vision emphasizes that the overall policy framework for the education sector\nhas three pillars supported by a base of strengthened planning and management. These three\npillars  are  equitable  access,  quality  improvement,  and  improved  relevance.  The  Government\nalso  aims  to  achieve  the  goal  of  universal  primary  education  by  2015,  by  addressing  critical\n\n                  \n\n10 ADB. 2000.

In  spite  of  considerable\nprogress  in  increasing  access,  improving  quality,  enhancing  relevance,  and  strengthening\nplanning and management of education, a much greater commitment of the Government will be\nneeded to achieve the goal of quality education for all children.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n36.\nBetween 1991 and 2000, the Lao PDR received approximately $76.0 million in external\nassistance  to  the  basic  education  sector  on  a  commitment  basis.  Of  this  assistance,  about\n$52.3 million was committed by ADB and the World Bank. ADB supported the EQIP, focusing\non  the  development  of  the  teacher  education  system  for  primary  and  lower  secondary\neducation,  i.e.,  rationalizing  preservice  teacher  training,  upgrading  physical  facilities,  and\nestablishing an in-service training system and TDC. ADB is also supporting the Basic Education\n(Girls)  Project  (BEGP)  (footnote  2),  cofinanced  by  the  Australian  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment, which is providing school facilities, curriculum, teacher training, and instructional\nmaterials to girls and ethnic minorities, and developing the educational management information\nsystem.  The  World  Bank,  together  with  Norway  and  Switzerland,  supported  the  Education\nDevelopment  Project  (EDP),  which  helped  develop  and  implement  new  school  curricula,\ninstructional  materials,  and  pedagogical  support  systems  for  primary  and  lower  secondary\neducation;  constructed  primary  and  lower  secondary  schools;  and  strengthened  institutional\ncapacities in educational administration and management. In parallel with the preparation of the\nproposed  Project,  the  World  Bank  is  preparing  the  Second  Education  Development  Program\n(EDP  II)  including  constructing  schools,  revising  school  curriculum  and  textbooks,  and\nstrengthening education management.\n\n37.\nSeveral  United  Nations  agencies,  bilateral  agencies,  and  NGOs  have  smaller  but\nsignificant  programs  from  which  many  positive  lessons  can  be  learned.  UNICEF,  Save  the\nChildren Fund-United Kingdom, Save the Children Fund-Norway, Christian Relief Service, and\nChurch  World  Service  are  supporting  the  TUP  that  has  offered  teacher  training  to  many\nunqualified  teachers.  UNICEF  is  also  the  largest  supporter  of  school  cluster  networks  for\nprimary schools and is involved in community primary school construction programs. The NGOs\nhave  mainly  concentrated  on  primary  education,  teacher  training,  and  nonformal  education  in\nrural  and  ethnic  minority  areas.  Sida  is  supporting  a  pilot  project  for  TTC  administrators  and\nteachers  to  develop  participatory  action  research  approaches  for  clarifying  problems  and\nidentifying solutions, and is planning national support for teacher education and development, in\ncooperation  with  ADB.  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  supports  capacity  building  for\nTTC teachers and PAs with a focus on the delivery of science and mathematics subjects, and is\nplanning  a  school  construction  program  in  Vientiane  Province  and  Vientiane  Municipality.\nFrance has expressed interest in supporting education management, and school construction in\nChampassak. The European Union is considering providing substantial support for the primary\neducation  sector,  but  details  are  not  yet  known.  External  assistance  to  basic  education  is  in\nAppendix 2.\n\n38.\nRecently,  increasing  dialogue  has  taken  place  to  improve  aid  coordination.  Under  the\nguidance of MOE, the Embassy of Sweden-Sida are supporting the process of aid coordination\n\n\f11\n\nin  cooperation  with  ADB,  World  Bank,  and  other  concerned  assistance  agencies.  This  has\nresulted  in  a  division  of  responsibilities  in  supporting  the  education  sector.  ADB  continues  to\ntake  greater  responsibility  for  developing  teacher  education,  while  the  World  Bank  supports\ngeneral education focusing on school curriculum and textbooks. However, in responding to the\nGovernment\u2019s priority to achieve universal primary education, the Donor Roundtable Meeting in\nMay  2000  confirmed  that  multilateral  development  banks,  bilateral  assistance  agencies,  and\nNGOs  would  support  primary  school  construction  programs  as  a  priority  area  for  assistance.\nDiscussions  have  also  taken  place  to  ensure  a  rational  division  of  projects  geographically  to\navoid  overlapping  of  resources,  especially  in  supporting  school  construction  programs  and\neducation  management.  The  geographical  coverage  for  school  construction  will  not  overlap\nbetween  the  proposed  Project  and  the  BEGP.  In  the  provinces  where  bilateral  agencies  are\nexpected to provide school construction support (e.g., Champassak and Vientiane), the Project\nwill  focus  on  the  provision  of  teacher  training  to  ensure  the  complementary  role  in  these\nprovinces. The Government has agreed that the World Bank\u2019s EDP II will identify provinces that\nthe proposed Project will not cover for school construction. Strengthening management capacity\nis  another  common  area  of  concern  in  light  of  the  proposed  decentralization  of  education\nmanagement.  ADB\u2019s  support  for  capacity  building  will  focus  on  the  provincial  and  district\ndelivery of school construction and teacher training programs, while the World Bank and France\nwill strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity of MOE, PESs, DEBs, and school principals\nby  upgrading  and  improving  the  education  management  information  system.  Dialogue  also\ncontinues  among  the  development  partners  to  ensure  that  lessons  are  learned  from  each\nother\u2019s projects. In this context, the Project will build on previous assistance initiatives including\nthe  PA  and  school  cluster  systems,  the  TUP  and  NTUC  systems,  and  community  school\nconstruction initiatives.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nin \n\nIn  general, \n\ninvestment  projects \n\nthe  Lao  PDR  have  experienced \n\n39.\nfrequent\nimplementation difficulties due to the lax management at all administrative levels. A key lesson\nlearned  from  postevaluation  findings  is  the  need  to  establish  strong  management  capacity  as\nwell  as  strong  project  implementation  capabilities.12  Implementation  delays  in  several  current\nand previous projects are also caused by (i) MOE\u2019s complex procedures, (ii) bureaucratic and\novercentralized  Government  procedures,  and  (iii)  inadequate  staff  to  implement  projects.\nTherefore,  projects  should  not  be  overly  ambitious  and  should  use  existing  structures  and\nprocedures with which Government staff are familiar. Where additional management loads are\nbeing imposed, additional assistance should be provided.\n\n40.\nADB\u2019s EQIP aimed to support (i) reforms in teacher training through policy development\nby  establishing  the  National  Teacher  Education  Advisory  Board,  (ii)  curriculum  and  training\nreforms by establishing TDC, (iii) upgrading of TTC facilities; (iv) in-service training for teacher\ntrainers  and  educational  administrators;  and  (v)  development,  production,  and  distribution  of\ntextbooks,  instructional  materials,  and  teachers  guides  for  the  TTCs.  Overall,  the  EQIP  was\nsuccessful.  The  achievements  include  (i)  the  National  Teacher  Education  Advisory  Board  has\nsuccessfully guided the adoption of enhanced qualifications for TTC graduates and coordinated\nimplementation of the new curriculum for teacher training; (ii) TDC has become a key institute\nfor  in-service  training  and  research  and  development  work  related  to  curriculum  development;\n(iii) facilities of 8 TTCs have been constructed or upgraded; and (iv) a total of 140 textbooks, 78\nteachers  guides,  and  60  kinds  of  instructional  materials  were  successfully  produced  and\ndistributed. Some valuable lessons learned from the EQIP, which pertain specifically to teacher\ntraining,  include  (i) comprehensive,  well-articulated  policy,  strategies,  and  mechanisms  for\n\n12 Postevaluation Office. 1994. Country Synthesis of Postevaluation Findings in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.\n\n                  \n\nADB, Manila.\n\n\f12\n\nintegrating  teacher  training  and  development  need  to  be  developed  and  consolidated;\n(ii) stakeholder  should  be  involved  in  project  design  to  help  ensure  project  quality  including\ntimely  site  selection  and  more  effective  project  supervision;  (iii)  capacity  building  at  all\nadministrative  levels  of  project  management  and  implementation  is  essential;  (iv)  sufficient\nbudgetary  allocations  to  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  facilities  should  be  assured;  and\n(v) future  ADB  assistance  to  the  sector  should  be  based  on  a  long-term  commitment  to  the\ncountry\u2019s needs for continuity of support.13 In particular, largely due to insufficient allocation of\nrecurrent  budget  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  TTC  facilities  during  the  recent  economic\ncrisis  in  the  region,  learning  and  living  conditions  for  teachers  and  students  have  deteriorated\nand urgently need to be improved.\n\n41.\nEffectiveness  of  the  ongoing  teacher  training  programs,  consisting  of  preservice,\nupgrading,  and  in-service,  on  the  quality  of  classroom  teaching-learning  processes  have  not\nbeen comprehensively evaluated. The outcomes to be achieved in terms of changes in teaching\nperformance at the schools must be clearly specified. Teachers should be reoriented to provide\nactive,  participatory,  and  enjoyable  learning  experiences  for  students  in  and  outside  the\nclassroom.  However,  teacher  training  programs  should  be  realistic  in  what  can  be  expected;\nteachers  often  have  a  very  low  level  of  general  schooling.  This  observation  is  confirmed  by  a\nlesson  related  to  teacher  training  learned  from  the  World  Bank\u2019s  EDP.  In-service  training\nprograms  for  teachers,  which  are  separate  from  an  ongoing  professional  support  program  by\nthe PA system or the school cluster system, will have short-term benefits at best.\n\n42.\nSome early lessons learned from ADB\u2019s ongoing BEGP, which aims to expand access to\nimproved  education  for  girls  in  ethnic  minority  areas,  include  (i)  the  lengthy  processing\nprocedures for the imprest account need to be simplified so that implementation can proceed;\nand (ii) due to limited MOE capacity, qualified local staff have to be provided to assist MOE in\nimplementing the Project, together with clear job descriptions for relevant MOE staff involved in\nproject implementation.\n\n43.\nIn addition, experience with the World Bank\u2019s EDP, ADB\u2019s BEGP, UNICEF\u2019s programs,\nand  NGO  education  projects  related  to  civil  works  and  community  involvement  shows  that\ncommunity  contributions  are  best  used  for  activities  supporting  construction  and  maintenance,\ne.g.,  building  fences  and  providing  labor  for  wells,  involvement  in  planning  and  management,\nand  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  schools.  To  ensure  that  communities  make  use  of  the\nfacilities and support the schools over the long term, a sense of ownership must be developed\nin  the  communities,  and  measures  instituted  to  encourage  parents  to  send  their  children,\nespecially girls, to school.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\nADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  for  education  in  the  Lao  PDR  is  a  part  of  its  overall  strategy  for\n44.\npoverty  reduction,  of  which  human  development  and  gender  and  development  are  key\ncomponents. Investments in primary and secondary education are essential to increase human\ncapital  and  productivity  of  the  poor.  ADB  will  assist  the  Government  in  achieving  the  goal  of\nquality  education  for  all  children.  In  particular,  ADB  will  continue  to  improve  coverage,  quality,\nand relevance of basic education services by focusing on increasing primary school enrollment\nand  retaining  disadvantaged  children,  and  improving  teacher  competencies  and  learning\nachievements  mainly  through  teacher  training.  Strengthening  management  capacity  of  the\neducation  system  with  improved  efficiency  and  sustainability  of  education  financing  are\nessential aspects of this strategy. As part of the policy dialogue during project processing, ADB\nencouraged  the  Government  to  redress  existing  inequalities  in  basic  education  and  provide\n\n13 PCR: LAO 23047: Education Quality Improvement Project, June 2000.\n\n                  \n\n\f13\n\nmore  efficient  delivery  of  services  by  encouraging  active  community  involvement  in  project\nplanning  and  implementation.  The  proposed  Project  will  support  the  strategy  by  improving  the\nquality  of  teaching  and  learning,  increasing  equitable  access  to  and  participation  in  primary\neducation,  and  strengthening  the  capacity  of  MOE,  PESs,  DEBs,  and  villages  to  plan  and\nmanage  the  decentralized  education  system.  To  strengthen  institutional  and  human  resource\ncapacity for implementing decentralization policy, an advisory TA to strengthening decentralized\neducation management is included in the 2002 program.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n45.\nPolicy  dialogue  has  focused  on  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  education  sector\nincluding the Project, and the Project\u2019s potential to improve the quality of teaching and learning\nby  integrating  teacher  training  and  development  systems,  promoting  equitable  access  to  and\nincreasing participation in primary education, and strengthening the institutional capacity of the\nGovernment to manage the decentralized education system with good governance. The policy\nframework  for  the  Project  is  in  Appendix  3,  and  a  summary  of  policy  dialogue  held  with  the\nGovernment follows.\n\n1. \n\nFinancing Education\n\nThe  Government  recognizes  that  education  budgets  have  been  inadequate,  and  low\n46.\nteacher  salaries  severely  constrain  the  possibility  of  building  a  competent  dedicated  teaching\nforce.  The  need  to  ensure  budget  allocation  for  education  from  the  public  expenditure  budget\nand for efficient intersectoral allocation is a key feature of the policy framework. By interacting\nwith  the  Government\u2019s  public  expenditure  review  process  and  as  a  common  policy  agenda\nbetween  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  increase  the  budget  for\neducation  expenditure  to  at  least  12  percent  of  the  total  budget  in  FY2001/02,  at  least  13\npercent in FY2003/04, and for the medium term, up to 15 percent by FY2005/06. This level was\nachieved, on average, from FY1994/95 to FY1996/97, prior to the regional economic crisis. In\nparticular,  the  need  for  sufficient  budget  allocation  to  cover  recurrent  costs  has  been\nemphasized,  by  adjusting  the  existing  pattern  of  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures.  The\nGovernment needs to give increased priority to provisions for recurrent education expenditures\nespecially for operation and maintenance of primary schools and TTCs, and salaries for existing\nand  new  teachers.  In  October  2000,  civil  servants\u2019  salaries  including  those  of  teachers  were\nincreased by up to 40 percent, although a substantial increase is needed in subsequent years to\nbring salaries to an acceptable level. ADB and the World Bank will jointly address the need to\nretain the  share  of education budget to primary education at 55 percent of the total education\nexpenditure,  and  increase  teacher  salaries  during  project  implementation.  For  the  schools\nconstructed  or  rehabilitated  and  TTC  facilities  upgraded,  a  demand-driven  management\nstructure  will  be  installed  in  addition  to  increased  recurrent  expenditures  to  be  allocated.  For\nexample,  the  Government  will  encourage  (i)  the  community  to  contribute  in-kind  in  building\nschools and to meet basic operation and maintenance requirements, and (ii) selected TTCs to\nengage in the revenue-generating activities to cover some operation and maintenance costs.\n\n2.\n\nImproving the Quality of Teaching and Learning\n\n47.\nOne of the central thrusts of the Project is to achieve improved education quality through\na  better-trained  and  better-motivated  teaching  force.  This  can  be  accomplished  through  better\nintegration  of  preservice,  upgrading,  and  in-service teacher  training  programs;  development  of\nmodern  competencies  in  teaching;  and  improved  salaries  and  working  conditions  for  the\nteaching  profession.  First,  MOE  has  agreed  to  develop  a  teacher  education  strategy  in  which\nthe long-term measures for reforming the preservice teacher training framework will be identified\nto provide more in-depth teacher preparation at the TTCs, and to phase out the 8+3 and 11+1\n\n\f14\n\ncourses  to  be  replaced  by  the  11+2  and  11+3  courses.  Such  a  reform  would  require  a  more\ncareful analysis of the whole teacher training system both quantitatively and qualitatively, so that\na  time-bound  program  could  be  developed  to  reach  the  goal.  Second,  the  Government  will\nestablish  a  teacher  policy  working  group  (TPWG)  in  MOE  to  reform  teachers\u2019  incentive\nmechanisms  including  teachers\u2019  salaries,  and  improve  working  conditions  and  future  career\nprospects  of  teachers.  Given  the  varied  needs  of  the  system  and  the  limited  financial  and\nhuman resources available, much of ADB\u2019s dialogue has focused on the need to set appropriate\npriorities.  Accordingly,  priority  will  also  be  given  to  improving  the  system  of  preservice  and\nupgrading programs for teachers through the TTCs and TUP, and to developing the nationwide\nin-service training program based on the successful NTUC system and in cooperation with the\nTTCs  and  the  PAs.  Thus,  the  Government  will  integrate  preservice,  upgrading,  and  in-service\nteacher training with the necessary reforms of teacher incentives including salaries and working\nconditions in order to create a better motivated workforce and retain teachers in the profession.\n\n48.\nIn  addition,  dialogue  with  Government  officials,  teacher  trainers,  teachers,  and\nrepresentatives from the LWU identified a demand for local training, especially to assist women\nwho  need  to  qualify  as  teachers.  The  Government  will  continue  to  support  increasing\neducational  opportunities  for  ethnic  minorities,  support  recruitment  of  qualified  ethnic  minority\nwomen  as  teachers,  and  ensure  that  they  are  provided  appropriate  training  to  allow  them  to\nteach in their own communities.\n\n3.\n\nIncreasing Access to and Participation in Education\n\n49.\nThe  Government  will  give  priority  to  primary  education  expansion  in  underserved  and\nethnic minority areas by upgrading incomplete schools to five grades and introducing multigrade\nteaching  where  appropriate;  and  encourage  community  participation  for  school  construction,\noperation, and maintenance. To increase access to and participation in primary schooling, the\nProject  will  upgrade  incomplete  primary  schools  through  locally  supported  construction;\nrehabilitate existing primary schools as necessary; build new complete schools in villages where\ncurrently  no  primary  education  is  available;  ensure  that  teachers  are  provided  in  the  new\nschools; mobilize community support for planning, management, operation, and maintenance of\nthe school; and provide school funds to support learning activities and participation in education.\nDialogue with MOE, PESs, PUCDAs, and DEBs show a clear need to build flexibility into school\ndesigns, responding to community demands for expanding access to education, and increasing\nopportunities to complete the primary cycle. This is well reflected in recent education plans and\nin ongoing community support programs for schools, mainly by UNICEF and NGOs. With ADB\nsupport, the Government is introducing multigrade schools and teaching as a national strategy\nto  improve  access  in  remote  and  underserved  areas,  and  will  continue  to  support  multigrade\nschools  and  teaching.  In  term  of  the  prototype  designs  of  schools  to  be  constructed  or\nrehabilitated,  both  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  have  agreed  to  take  a  \u201cminimum  common\nstandard\u201d approach, which means permanent school buildings will have a life span of more than\n25 years or the semipermanent school building a life span of more than 25 years for the main\nstructure. The proposed Project and the World Bank\u2019s EDP II will include a community-managed\nschool construction or rehabilitation program.\n\n4.\n\nStrengthening Management Capacity in Education\n\n50.\nFollowing  the  prime  ministerial  decree  on  decentralization  of  March  2000,  MOE  will\nimplement  the  decree  in  a  phased  manner  by  specifying  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework,\nfunctions  of  the  different  administrative  levels  of  the  system,  and  task  description  of  each\nfunction; and by allocating adequate budget and staff resources and decision-making authority\nto  support  delegated  activities.  However, \nthe  specific\ncharacteristics  of  the  emerging  roles  and  functions  at  different  administrative  levels,  and  the\n\nthe  extent  of  decentralization, \n\n\f15\n\ndegree of ownership of activities allowed for the districts and villages is still to be defined. In the\neducation sector, dialogue and debate will continue for some time at each administrative level\nand  across  administrative  levels  on  such  issues  as  the  functions  that  are  best  performed  at\neach level, the various kinds of training required, the necessary information system to support\nthe  change,  and  the  fiscal  implications  associated  with  the  decentralization  process.  Dialogue\nwith  MOE  officials  has  produced  much  enthusiasm  and  considerable  agreement  about  the\nimportance  of  strengthening  the  institutional  capacity  of  the  central,  provincial,  district,  and\nvillage level administrations to plan and manage the decentralized education system. MOE has\nset  up  a  steering  committee  to  oversee  the  process  of  decentralization  and  a  technical\ncommittee to draw up MOE\u2019s guidelines and action plans for decentralization. MOE has agreed\nto  organize  a  workshop  to  discuss  policy  and  prepare  MOE\u2019s  guidelines  and  action  plans  for\npursuing  decentralized  education  management,  including  simplified  procedures  to  ensure\nsmooth and prompt decision making and fund flows, and the development of an accountability\nsystem at the provincial, district, and village levels.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nThe  education  system  in  the  Lao  PDR  has  improved  substantially  but  still  faces  many\n51.\nchallenges.  Much  remains  to  be  done  to  achieve  the  Government\u2019s  goal  of  universal  primary\neducation,  and  raise  the  quality  of  education  to  approach  standards  in  neighboring  countries.\nVery  low  public  expenditure  on  education  has  been  a  major  constraint  to  ensuring  continued,\nbalanced  growth  in  the  system,  which  is  characterized  by  inequitable  access  to  quality  basic\neducation,  especially  primary  education  for  the  poor,  girls,  and  ethnic  minorities,  and  weak\ncapacity  to  manage  the  system.  In  particular,  improving  the  quality  of  teaching  competencies\nand the learning environment is key to improved quality of education, and reducing dropout and\nrepetition. Project interventions to improve the quality of education were made under the EQIP\ncompleted in 1998 and are ongoing under the BEGP. These efforts have to be continued as the\noverall  competencies  and  qualifications  of  teachers  are  still  inadequate.  Competent  teachers\nshould  be  encouraged  to  remain  in  the  profession.  Therefore,  a  national  system  of  teacher\neducation should be developed with enhanced career development prospects for teachers. The\nproposed Project will develop a national teacher training support system based on the reforms\nin the teacher training system initiated under the EQIP, and implement intensive and integrated\nteacher training programs in selected provinces and districts.\n\n52.\nThe Project has been formulated within ADB\u2019s overarching objective of poverty reduction\nand  the  Government\u2019s  education  strategic  vision  (footnote  11).  In  particular,  quality  basic\neducation for every child is a right to which the Government subscribes. The Project will mainly\nfocus on developing a teacher training support system; improving teachers\u2019 incentives including\nsalaries,  and  working  conditions;  upgrading  TTC  facilities  and  other  training  facilities  and\nequipment;  and  delivering  pre-  and  in-service  teacher  training  and  teacher  upgrading.  The\nProject will contribute to increased access to primary education in selected underserved areas\nby  encouraging  participation  by  students  and  support  from  communities,  by  providing  trained\nteachers on a sustainable basis, and hence by ensuring the quality of education provided in the\nschools. The Project will especially target the underserved ethnic minority areas where gender\ndisparities  in  access  to  and  retention  in  education  are  large.  The  Project  will  also  support  the\nGovernment\u2019s plan of decentralizing education management by providing assistance to develop\ninstitutional, management, and project implementation capabilities at the provincial, district, and\nvillage levels, since much of the management of access and quality activities will occur at the\nthese levels.\n\n\fB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n16\n\n53.\nThe long-term goal of the Project is to contribute to poverty reduction in the Lao PDR by\nhelping the Government achieve quality education for all children. The objectives of the Project\nare to (i) improve the relevance, quality, and efficiency of primary and secondary education by\ndeveloping the teacher training support system, developing a strategy to increase the number of\nfemale  and  ethnic  minority  teachers,  enhancing  teacher  competencies  and  improving  the\nprofessional status and career development prospects of teachers, constructing and upgrading\ntraining facilities, and delivering intensive teacher training programs at the provincial and district\nlevels; (ii) expand access to and improve retention in primary schools especially of girls in poor,\nunderserved  areas  of  the  country;  and  (iii)  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  central,\nprovincial,  district,  and  village  level  administrations  to  plan  and  manage  the  decentralized\neducation  system  and  implement  the  Project.  The  Project  will  operate  at  the  national  level  to\ndevelop the teacher training support system including schemes to enhance career development\nprospects  and  welfare  of  teachers.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  at  provincial  and  district\nlevels in selected provinces and districts to deliver integrated packages of activities to improve the\nquality  of  teaching  and  learning,  and  access  to  and  participation  in  education.  The  Project  will\ncomplement  ongoing  and  planned  projects  including  the  ADB-funded  BEGP,  especially  in\nexpanding  access  to  primary  education,  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  EDP  II  focusing  on  general\neducation.\n\n54.\nThe  Project  includes  several  integrated  elements:  (i)  in-service  teacher  training  and\nupgrading  of  unqualified  teachers;  (ii)  school  construction  and  rehabilitation;  and  (iii)  funds  to\nsupport  school  operation  and  maintenance,  learning  especially  in  the  early  grade  classes,  and\nparticipation in education; and to purchase books and learning materials. The Project will focus its\nintegrated  packages  of  activities  in  six  project  provinces:  Bokeo,  Champassak,  Louang\nPhrabang,  Savannakhet,  and  Sayaburi,  and  Vientiane.  Improving  the  quality  of  teaching  and\nlearning,  and  strengthening  management  capacity  components  will  be  implemented  in  all  six\nprovinces  (with  61  districts).  However,  the  access  component  focuses  on  the  four  provinces\n(Bokeo,  Louang  Phrabang,  Savannakhet,  and  Sayaburi)  of  these  six  provinces  only  (with  41\ndistricts), all of which have significant poor, underserved, and ethnic group areas. The average\nprovincial  poverty  incidence  of  these  provinces  is  higher  than  the  national  poverty  incidence\nlevel of 38.6 percent (footnote 7). School construction in the other two provinces, Champassak\nand Vientiane, is expected to be supported by other assistance agencies. A more limited quality\nimprovement  program  will  be  supported  in  nine  additional  districts  in  three  provinces:  Louang\nNamtha, Saravane, and Xieng Khouang.14\n\n55.\nThe  project  provinces  are  strategically  situated  around  seven  of  the  eight  TTCs,\nincluding the four largest and most influential.15 The TTCs will be given an increased role in the\nintegrated teacher training system so that they become involved in developing, managing, and\nimplementing  upgrading  and  in-service  training  programs  for  teachers,  in  addition  to  their\ntraditional role in preservice teacher training. Thus, the TTCs will work closely with the PAs and\nNTUC  trainers  in  their  respective  provinces  and  districts.  While  the  Project  is  envisaged  to\ndevelop  the  national  teacher  training  support  system,  the  delivery  of  upgrading  and  in-service\nteacher  training  will  first  target  selected  provinces  in  and  nearby  the  provinces  where  the  TTCs\nare  strategically  located.  The  project  activities  will  be  implemented  in  four  phases  to  enable\nmodels  and  management  capacity  to  be  developed.  Accordingly,  the  proposed  choices  of\nprovinces  will  enable  integration  of  the  project  activities  at  provincial  and  district  levels,  which\nwill in turn support the process of decentralization in education management for both increasing\n\n                  \n\nsituated.\n\n14 These are the provinces in which three TTCs (Louang Namtha TTC, Saravane TTC, and Xieng Khouang TTC) are\n\n15 These  four  TTCs  are:  Louang  Phrabang  TTC  in  the  Northern  Region;  Vientiane  Province  TTC  in  the  Central\n\nRegion; and Pakse TTC and Savannakhet TTC in the Southern Region.\n\n\f17\n\naccess to and improving quality of education in a phased manner. The project components are\nbriefly described in para. 56-69 and details are in Appendix 4.\n\n1.\n\nComponent 1: Improving the Quality of Teaching and Learning\n\nAs a priority focus of the Project, the quality of teaching and learning in schools will be\n56.\nimproved  within  the  integrated  teacher  training  and  development  framework  comprising  three\nsubcomponents:  (i)  building  a  teacher  training  system  and  teacher  development  capacity\nincluding  teacher  incentives,  salaries,  and  working  conditions;  (ii)  upgrading  TTC  and  other\ntraining  facilities,  and  equipment;  and  (iii)  delivering  integrated  provincial  and  district  teacher\ntraining  programs.  The  provincial  and  district  level  training  will  be  delivered  in  a  total  of  70\ndistricts in nine provinces.\n\na.\n\nBuilding  Teacher  Training  System  and  Teacher  Development\nCapacity\n\nIn the long term, the task will be to design and develop an improved system of teacher\n57.\ntraining comparable with international standards and suitable to primary and secondary schools\nof the Lao PDR. TTC management will be improved to enable them to take a greater and more\neffective role in preservice and upgrading training, where demand exists, to expand their role to\ncontinuing  education.  The  Project  will  support  the  development  of  teacher  training  system\ncapacity as follows: MOE departments involved in teacher education, including DTT, DGE, and\nNRIES, will be given assistance to develop a coherent teacher education strategy that reflects\nthe  country\u2019s  priorities,  including  the  reform  agenda  of  the  preservice  teacher  training  system,\nand  will  improve  the  supply  and  quality  of  teachers.  DTT,  in cooperation  with  TDC  and  TTCs,\nwill  develop,  produce,  and  deliver  curricula  and  training  materials  for  preservice,  upgrading  of\nuntrained  teachers,  and  in-service  professional  training.  The  curricula  and  materials  will  be\nbased  on  a  realistic  set  of  competencies  that  are  focused  on  developing  a  higher  quality  of\nteaching in schools, and will address observed training needs. DTT will develop guidelines for\ncertification of teachers taking part in preservice, upgrading programs, training of trainers, and\nin-service  programs.  A  cadre  of  well-prepared  trainers  at  the  TTCs  will  be  created  by  training\nTTC  staff,  TUP  trainers,  PAs,  and  academic  teachers  with  adequate  attention  paid  to  ethnic\ndiversity and gender balance. Preservice teacher education takes place through training at the\nTTCs. The structure of the TTC system was rationalized under the EQIP. An attempt was made\nto  reform  the  teacher  training  curriculum  through  TDC.  The  Project  will  focus  on  further\nimprovement by reviewing, revising, and if necessary, reforming the teacher training curriculum.\nThis will involve training TTC personnel in delivering courses more effectively, including training\nTTC directors and other concerned staff on effective institutional management.\n\n58.\nA  TPWG  will  be  established  in  MOE  and  staffed  to  ADB\u2019s  satisfaction  within  three\nmonths of loan effectiveness. The TPWG will develop concrete proposals and an action plan for\nimproved career, salary, and incentive systems for teachers that link  experience,  training, and\nperformance.  The  TPWG  will  operate  within  a  strict  time  frame  and  the  Government  will  be\nexpected to formulate and implement plans based on the group\u2019s proposals, and monitor their\nimpact on teachers and schools. The TPWG should adequately reflect the concerns of women,\nethnic  minority  teachers,  and  remote  communities.  Staff  of  the  gender  and  ethnic  minorities\neducation unit (GEMEU) of MOE\u2019s DGE will be included in the TPWG to adequately represent\nthe concerns of women and ethnic minorities, and the TPWG will develop affirmative actions for\nthe promotion policy for women and ethnic minorities. The Project will assist MOE in its efforts\nto  increase  teacher  salaries  and  incentives  to  an  acceptable  level.  Completion  of  in-service\ntraining courses will be linked to upgrading qualifications, improved incentives including salaries,\nand career structures developed by the TPWG.\n\n\f18\n\nb.\n\nConstruction and Upgrading of Training Facilities\n\n59.\nTTC facilities and equipment will be upgraded to improve living conditions for teachers\nand students and enable the colleges to function more effectively, paying special attention to the\nconditions  for  female  students.  Equipment  will  be  provided  to  12  of  18  provincial  secondary\nschool  PA  resource  centers,  which  do  not  yet  have  equipment,  to  strengthen  their  capacity  to\neffectively  support  secondary  school  teachers.  The  Project  will  also  provide  similar  equipment\npackages to the NTUCs in the nine project provinces in order to support the TUP. In addition,\nresource centers will be constructed to support clusters in project districts that currently have no\ncenter.\n\nc.\n\nDelivering Provincial and District Teacher Training\n\nThe teacher training schemes will build on the successful NTUC system as the basis of\n60.\na nationwide in-service teacher training network under DTT. A system of in-service training for\nlower and upper secondary teachers will be introduced in cooperation with the TTCs and the PA\nsystem, based initially at the provincial level, but with the option to develop models based on the\nNTUC  network.  The  Project  will  work  with  other  assistance  agencies  to  support  the\ndevelopment of the school cluster network system for primary schools where appropriate, and\ndevelop  alternatives  for  schools  and  teachers  that  cannot  be  reached  by  that  system.  Finally,\nthe Project will seek to institutionalize these schemes to better ensure their sustainability after\nproject implementation.\n\n61.\nThe  delivery  of  teacher  training  programs  will  be  implemented  in  a  phased  manner  in\nline  with  the  development  of  provincial  and  district  training  and  management  capacity,  and  to\nlearn  lessons  and  make  improvements  to  programs  on  an  ongoing  basis.  The  programs  for\nprimary school teachers will be developed in four phases: phase 1 will start in 12 districts in 6\nprovinces  (Bokeo,  Champassak,  Louang  Phrabang,  Savannakhet,  Sayaburi,  and  Vientiane)  in\nyear 1. Phase 2 will start in another 12 districts in the same provinces in year 2. Phase 3 will\nstart in an additional 37 districts in the same provinces in year 3. Secondary school programs\nwill start in year 3 in the six provinces. Phase 4 will start with limited programs that will run in a\nfurther three provinces (Louang Namtha, Saravane, and Xieng Khouang) starting in the fourth\nyear.  MOE  will  submit  the  list  of  project  villages  and  schools  (selected  based  on  criteria\nacceptable  to  ADB)  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  on  the  following  time  schedule:  (i) for\nvillages  and  schools  in  the  12  project  districts  in  phase  1,  within  six  months  of  loan\neffectiveness,  (ii)  for  villages  and  schools  in  the  12  project  districts  in  phase  2,  no  later  than\nthree months after the first anniversary of loan effectiveness, (iii) for villages and schools in the\n37 project districts in phase 3, no later than three months after the second anniversary of loan\neffectiveness, and (iv) for villages and schools in the 9 project districts in phase 4, no later than\nthree months after the third anniversary of loan effectiveness.\n\n62.\nThe Project will work to raise the quality of the training provided by the TUP (para. 25) in\nthe nine project provinces by reviewing and revising the curricula and training materials, and by\ntraining  TUP  staff  and  managers.  It  will  support  the  TUP  especially  in  rural  and  remote  areas\nwith  many  unqualified  teachers,  by  coordinating  with  other  assistance  agencies  including\nUNICEF to ensure nationwide coverage. It will also train unqualified teachers recruited to teach\nin schools and classrooms built during the course of the Project.\n\n2.\n\nComponent 2: Increasing Access to and Participation in Education\n\n63.\nThe Project will increase access to and participation in primary education in 41 districts\nin  four  provinces  (Bokeo,  Louang  Phrabang,  Savannakhet,  and  Sayaburi)  in  three  phases:\nphase 1 with 8 districts, phase 2 with 8 districts, and phase 3 with 25 districts. This component\n\n\f19\n\nwill include mapping and data collection in the first year of each phase to establish the needs\nand  demand  for  school  construction,  and  school  funds  in  the  underserved  areas.  Criteria  has\nbeen  established  regarding  the  characteristics  of  such  areas  and  how  they  will  qualify  for\nsupport.  Priority  will  be  given  to  (i)  upgrading  incomplete  schools  to  five  grades;16  and\n(ii) building  new  complete  schools  in  the  villages  that  have  no  practical  access  to  primary\neducation.17 The Project will also support the construction of multigrade schools of two or three\nclassrooms.\n\na.\n\nIncreasing Access to Primary Education\n\n64.\nThe  Project  will  adopt  a  flexible  demand-driven  approach  in  districts  that  will  formulate\ntheir own plans suited to their own needs. Each of the 41 project districts will be allocated with\nconstruction funds of $150,000 on average over three years to be spent on increasing access to\nprimary  education.  The  budget  in  each  project  district  will  be  determined  by  MOE  within  one\nyear of loan effectiveness and submitted to ADB for review and approval. Districts will undertake\nschool mapping and data collection as the basis for their planning. Standard design schools and\nclassrooms will include two, three, and five classroom schools as needed. At least 50 percent of\nthe  funds  must  be  spent  on  upgrading  incomplete  schools.  The  Project  will  also  allocate\nmatching  funds  to  local  communities  to  enable  them  to  rehabilitate,  complete  or  extend  their\nschools.  The  component  will  focus  on  areas  where  local  communities  have  demand  and  are\ncommitted to help construct, support, and maintain their schools. They will also be asked to find\nteachers from their own communities, where no other source is available. The Government will\npay the salaries of these teachers, while the Project will provide training for them.\n\nb.\n\nEncouraging Participation\n\n65.\nThe Project recognizes the need to strengthen the ability of schools and communities to\nmanage  their  schools,  and  will  establish  the  principle  of  a  Government  budget  allocation  to\nschools. To support participation and learning in primary schools in project districts, the Project\nwill provide schools with an annual budget of about $130 equivalent. Schools will manage this\nfund themselves as part of the effort to encourage school-based management of resources. The\nschool  fund  will  be  mainly  used  to  support  operation  and  maintenance  of  schools.  To  make\ncommunity demand a key factor in the school building program, approximately 50 percent of the\nfunds will be used to encourage special programs devised by schools and local communities to\nsupport learning, especially in the early grade classes, and participation in education, especially\namong  girls  and  ethnic  minorities.  The  Project  will  finance  an  operational  study  to  assess  the\neffectiveness of special programs on reducing dropouts and repetition, and improving learning\nin  schools.  The  Project  will  also  provide  a  package  of  books  and  other  learning  materials\namounting  to  $125  equivalent  to  each  school  in  project  districts.  The  Project  will  thus  provide\nmodels of what the Government itself should be doing on a routine basis. After the Project, the\nschool fund and provision of books and learning materials will become the norm for all schools\nas routine education provision. Furthermore, training will be given to village heads and members\nof  the  LWU  together  with  other  village  women  to  raise  community  awareness  and  support.\nSocial  development  coordinators  will  work  with  schools  and  communities  to  support  these\nparticipation programs.\n\n                  \n\n16 Criteria  for  supporting  completion  of  incomplete  schools  are  (i)  the  school  is  not  currently  operating  up  to  grade\nfive; (ii) the school has viable numbers of students in its existing classes; and (iii) no practical alternative school is\navailable for children to complete their education.\n\n17 Criteria for supporting the building of new complete schools are (i) the village should have at least 50 children (6-10\nyears old) able to enter in the primary school or be situated in an area between villages with at least 100 children\n(6-10 years old); and (ii) the village should be a long-term settlement.\n\n\f20\n\n3.\n\nComponent  3:  Strengthening  Management  Capacity  and  Project\nImplementation\n\n66.\nThe  Project  will  improve  the  ability  of  the  different  administrative  units  to  manage  the\ntasks  allocated  to  PESs,  DEBs,  and  communities/villages,  while  strengthening  the  capacity  of\nMOE to supervise and control the decentralization process. The Project will coordinate closely\nwith  the  ADB-funded  BEGP,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  bilateral  agencies  involved  in\nstrengthening  the  management  of  education.  The  Project  will  build  on  and  improve  current\nmanagement structures and practice rather than introduce totally new structures. This includes\nthe  management  of  PESs,  PUCDAs,  DEBs,  the  TUP  system,  and  the  PA  and  school  cluster\nsystems. The Project will support the long-term development of these management structures at\neach  level  of  education  administration  and  services  in  line  with  the  decentralization  process.\nProject  activities  will  build  up  planning  and  management  capacity  at  MOE  to  support  teacher\ntraining  and  development,  and  develop  capacity  at  the  PESs,  DEBs,  and  community/village\nlevels  to  support  project  implementation  including  the  planning  and  implementation  of\nconstruction,  school  support,  and  teacher  training  programs.  In  particular,  the  coordination\nfunction of the PES to deliver in-service training and teacher upgrading programs through TTCs,\nTDC, and TUP-NTUCs will be strengthened in cooperation with the PA system and PA resource\ncenters.\n\na.\n\nStrengthening Capacity of MOE\n\n67.\nThe  Project  will  support  the  following  MOE  departments:  (i)  DTT  and  DGE,  which  will\ntogether  manage  the  development  of  the  teacher  training  system  capacity  and  supervise  the\noverall  teacher  training  programs  throughout  the  country;  (ii)  the  Department  of  Planning  and\nInternational  Cooperation  (DPC)  which  will  coordinate  project  activities  within  MOE  using  a\nstreamlined  procedure,  and  liaise  with  other  government  and  assistance  agencies;  (iii)  the\nEducation Construction Service within MOE\u2019s Department of Finance, which will supervise the\nplanning and implementation of district level construction programs; and (iv) MOE\u2019s Department\nof  Personnel,  which  will  lead  the  TPWG.  MOE  will  organize  a  policy  workshop  to  discuss  and\nprepare MOE\u2019s guidelines and action plans for pursuing decentralized education management.\nAs most of the project activities are aimed at building up systems that will continue to operate on\na  routine  basis  after  project  completion,  consulting  services  and  training  will  be  concentrated\nmore at the start of the Project and will aim to build MOE capacity to implement the programs\nindependently.  Due  to  a  shortage  of  qualified  staff  and  a  moratorium  on  new  civil  service\nappointments,  two  qualified  assistants  with  budgeting  and  accounting,  and  reporting  skills  will\nbe provided to the project implementation unit (PIU) under DTT.\n\nb.\n\nStrengthening Capacity of the PESs and DEBs\n\nThe  PESs  and  DEBs  will  have  responsibility  for  planning  and  implementing  school\n68.\nconstruction, school support, and teacher training programs, both under the Project and for the\nlonger  term  under  the  decentralization  process.  The  Project  will  help  review  PES  and  DEB\norganizational  structures  and  provide  training  to  both.  The  Project  will  in  particular  use  the\nPUCDAs,  which  were  developed  under  the  World  Bank-funded  EDP,  to  manage  and  support\nthe construction program. PES and DEB personnel are already concerned with the organization\nand implementation of teacher training. At the PES level, these include the TUP trainers and the\nsecondary  school  PAs.  At  the  DEB  level  they  are  the  primary  school  PAs.  Provincial  PIUs\n(PPIUs) will be set up at PESs and district PIUs (DPIUs) at DEBs. Units will be set up at PESs\nand DEBs to support teacher training programs. A construction unit will be formed at the DEB\nlevel to support the district construction programs.\n\n\f21\n\n69.\nThe  Project  will  provide  consulting  services  and  training  to  support  mapping  and  data\ncollection,  planning  and  management,  budgeting  and  accounting  (including  training  for\naccountants), implementing, monitoring and supervising, and reporting the integrated package\nof  school  construction,  school  support,  and  teacher  training  programs.  One  qualified  assistant\nwill  be  provided  to  each  of  six  PESs  that  will  deliver  the  integrated  package  of  school\nconstruction,  school  support,  and  teacher  training  programs.  This  assistant  will  spend\nconsiderable  time  working  at  the  DEB  level  assisting  with  local  level  planning,  budgeting,\nimplementing,  monitoring  and  supervising,  and  reporting  activities.  One  additional  qualified\nassistant will be appointed to each PUCDA in four project provinces to help plan and supervise\nconstruction. A national project engineering consultant stationed at MOE will provide consulting\nservices  and  training  to  each  PUCDA  in  managing  and  monitoring  the  construction  program.\nThe  Project  will  support  PUCDA  staff  for  their  site  visits  to  plan  and  supervise  construction.\nOperational  budgets  and  equipment  will  be  provided  to  each  PES,  PUCDA,  and  DEB.  In\naddition, new DEB offices will be built in up to 55 of the 61 project districts that do not currently\nhave permanent offices. Furniture and equipment will be provided.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n70.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $37.6  million  equivalent,  of  which  an\nestimated $13.2 million, or 35 percent, is the foreign exchange cost. The local currency cost is\nestimated  at  $24.4  million  equivalent  or  65  percent  of  the  total  cost.  A  summary  of  the  cost\nestimates is shown in Table 1, and details are given in Appendix 5.\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nComponent\n\nA.

The ADB loan will be repayable over 32\nyears  with  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  with  an  interest  charge  of  1.0  percent  per  annum\nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum  thereafter.  The  borrower  will  be  the  Lao\nPDR. Sida is expected to provide a grant of about $9.6 million to cofinance, on a parallel basis,\na  part  of  Component  1:  Improving  the  Quality  of  Teaching  and  Learning  (the  building  teacher\ntraining  system  and  teacher  development  capacity  subcomponent)  including  consulting\nservices,  equipment,  staff  development,  materials,  operation  and  maintenance,  and  costs  for\nproject  reviews  and  supervisions.  ADB  and  Sida  together  will  fund  100  percent  of  the  foreign\nexchange  cost,  totaling  35  percent  of  the  estimated  project  cost,  and  67  percent  of  the  local\ncurrency  cost.  The  Government  and  communities  will  provide  the  remaining  $8  million\nequivalent  as  counterpart  financing.  This  includes  financing  in  kind  by  local  communities;\nprovision  of  land  for  new  schools  and  offices;  sharing  the  cost  of  teacher  upgrading  and  in-\nservice training; provision of materials and labor for civil works; taxes and duties; and operation\nand  maintenance  of  project  facilities.  Project  costs  that  will  become  recurrent  costs  for  the\nGovernment  after  project  completion,  such  as  teachers  salaries,  school  funds,  and  in-service\ntraining costs, are included as part of the counterpart funds.\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nSource\n\nADB\nSida\nGovernment and Community\n\n8.4\n4.8\n0.0\n\n11.6\n4.8\n8.0\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n20.0\n9.6\n8.0\n\nPercent\n\n53\n26\n21\n\n100\n\nTotal\nADB = Asian Development Bank; Sida = Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\n24.4\n\n37.6\n\n13.2\n\n72.\nSince the items to be financed under the Project, by their nature, have a large local cost\ncomponent, the Project will require local cost financing from ADB for $11.6 million, equivalent to\n58.0 percent of the ADB loan. This provision of financing for local currency cost is considered\njustified  under  ADB\u2019s  local  currency  financing  policy.18  From  an  economic  perspective,\nassistance  is  required  to  meet  the  local  currency  cost  of  development  projects  because  a  low\nlevel of per capita income constraints national savings and public finance is under pressure. The\nGovernment  is  taking  steps  to  improve  the  rate  of  national  savings  by  enhancing  revenue\ncollection,  and  improving  the  efficiency  of  public  expenditure  and  incentives  for  private  sector\nparticipation in revenue-generating public sector projects. Although these efforts are expected to\nincrease national savings, a significant resource gap will continue for some time because of the\nneed  for  large  capital  investments.  Thus,  ADB  assistance  for  local  currency  expenditures\nrelated to the Project from the economic perspective is justified. From a technical perspective,\nthe high level of financing of local currency costs is justified because (i) many small civil works\nare  scattered  over  numerous  rural  sites,  most  of  which  will  utilize  locally  produced  materials;\nand  (ii)  the  Project  is  funding  the  delivery  of  in-country  teacher  training  programs,  and  the\nrecruitment of domestic consultants and local contract staff.\n\n18 R1-95: A Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditure on Projects. 3 January 1995.\n\n                  \n\n\f23\n\nE.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nProject Management\n\n73.\nMOE,  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project,  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  Project\ncoordination  and  implementation.  An  MOE  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  minister  of\neducation,  will  be  responsible  for  overseeing  project  implementation  and  will  be  maintained  to\nthe satisfaction of ADB during the Project. The steering committee will include representatives\nof the Ministry of Finance and Committee for Planning and Cooperation. MOE\u2019s DPC will liaise\nwith  ADB  and  Sida  during  project  implementation,  and  coordinate  with  the  MOE  steering\ncommittee.  DPC  will  also  be  in  charge  of  overall  coordination,  monitoring,  and  supervision  of\nproject  activities.  A  PIU  will  be  formed  under  DTT,  which  will  implement  the  Project  including\nteacher training and development programs, and other project activities. The PIU will comprise\nsenior staff of DTT, other concerned MOE departments, TDC, and NRIES, specifically assigned\nto  implement  project  activities  at  the  central  level.  The  PIU  was  established  prior  to  loan\nnegotiations and will be maintained to the satisfaction of ADB and Sida during the Project. The\nPIU  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  planning,  budgeting,  monitoring,  and  reporting,  and  will\ncoordinate  the  work  of  the  PPIUs  and  DPIUs.  The  PIU  will  also  coordinate  the  work  of\nconsultants  financed  by  ADB  and  Sida.  The  Project  will  provide  two  qualified  assistants  with\nbudgeting and accounting, and reporting skills to the PIU to assist with project implementation.\nThe Project will provide equipment and operating resources for the PIU.\n\n74.\nMany project activities will be delegated to the TTC, PES, and DEB levels. The PPIUs\nwill be set up in the PES to coordinate, plan, implement, monitor, and supervise, and report on\nproject  activities  at  the  provincial  level,  while  the  DPIUs  at  DEBs  will  be  responsible  for\nimplementing project activities at the district level including school data collection and funds for\nprimary  schools.  The  PPIUs  and  DPIUs  will  be  established  and  staffed  to  the  satisfaction  of\nADB on the following time schedule: (i) for the PPIUs in the initial six project provinces (Bokeo,\nChampassak,  Louang  Phrabang,  Savannakhet,  Sayaburi,  and  Vientiane),  within  three  months\nof  loan  effectiveness;  (ii)  for  the  PPIUs  in  the  final  three  project  provinces  (Louang  Namtha,\nSaravane,  and  Xieng  Khouang)  at  least  three  months  prior  to  the  third  anniversary  of  loan\neffectiveness; and (iii) the DPIU in each of the 70 project districts, (a) for the 12 project districts\nin phase 1, within six months of loan effectiveness, (b) for the 12 project districts in phase 2, no\nlater  than  three  months  after  the  first  anniversary  of  loan  effectiveness,  (c)  for  the  37  project\ndistricts  in  phase  3,  no  later  than  three  months  after  the  second  anniversary  of  loan\neffectiveness, and (d) for the 9 project districts in phase 4, no later than three months after the\nthird anniversary of loan effectiveness.\n\n75.\nBoth PPIUs and DPIUs will be staffed by existing PES and DEB personnel, and thus will\nbe mainstreamed within existing institutions. However, one additional qualified assistant will be\nprovided to each PES of the initial six project provinces and one to each PUCDA in four project\nprovinces where school construction activities will be undertaken under the Project. In addition,\neach PPIU will be responsible for coordination, monitoring, and supervision of Project activities\nin the districts. It will also be responsible via PUCDA for the coordination and management of\nconstruction  activities.  Each  DPIU  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  district  project\nactivities,  including  school  data  collection,  management  of  primary  school  in-service  training,\nand  management  of  the  construction  and  school  funds.  The  PPIUs  and  DPIUs  will  all  have\nmonitoring  responsibilities  and  will  be  responsible  for  financial  and  technical  reporting  of\nactivities  in  their  areas.  The  Project  will  provide  equipment  and  operating  resources  for  the\nPPIUs, PUCDAs, DEBs, and DPIUs.\n\n\f2. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n24\n\n76.\nThe Project will be implemented over six years from January 2002 and is expected to be\ncompleted  by  31  December  2007.  The  involvement  of  districts  will  be  phased  in  line  with  the\nmanagement capacity of the PESs and DEBs. The implementation schedule for the Project is in\nAppendix 6.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  for  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\n77.\nGuidelines for Procurement.  The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  procurement  under  the  guidance\nand  supervision  of  the  MOE  steering  committee.  Procurement  for  the  Sida-supported\ncomponent  (Component  1:  the  building  teacher  training  system  and  teacher  development\ncapacity  subcomponent)  will  be  carried  out  by  Sida  in  accordance  with  its  procurement\nguidelines. Indicative procurement packages are in Appendix 7.\n\na.\n\nEquipment and Materials\n\n78.\nEach contract for supply of goods, equipment, and materials estimated to cost $500,000\nor  more  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  procedures,  while\ncontract  packages  of  less  than  $500,000  equivalent  will  follow  international  shopping\nprocedures.  Contracts  less  than  $100,000  may  be  procured  on  a  direct  purchase  basis.\nProcurement of library books, maps, and posters will be made locally.\n\nb.\n\nCivil Works\n\n79.\nCivil  work  packages  for  TTC  facilities  upgrading,  school  buildings,  and  DEB  offices\nunder the Project are small and often situated in remote areas. These are unlikely to attract the\ninterest of international contractors. Therefore, civil works contracts less than $1.0 million will be\nawarded on the basis of local competitive bidding acceptable to ADB. However, if any contract\nis estimated to cost more than $1.0 million, international competitive bidding procedures will be\nfollowed.\n\n80.\nMany of the minor civil works (estimated at less than $10,000 per school) to rehabilitate,\ncomplete, or extend school buildings and facilities will be carried out by local communities using\npart of the construction funds. These civil works tend to be located in remote and rural sites with\nassociated  difficulties  in  material  delivery,  and  are  unlikely  to  attract  international  or  domestic\ncontractors  and  suppliers.  Experience  of  ongoing  minor  civil  works  in  the  Lao  PDR  being\nsupported  by  NGOs  indicates  that  community-managed  school  construction  ensures  greater\ntransparency, accountability, and cost effectiveness; and better ownership and maintenance by\nthe communities. Therefore, minor civil works packages for school construction or rehabilitation\nmay be procured locally by the beneficiary schools or communities if such packages (i) do not\nexceed an estimated cost of $60,000 per package or $10,000 per school, (ii) are not attractive\nto private contractors, and (iii) the capacity of the school or community has been determined to\nbe adequate based on the following procedure for community participation in procurement. The\nprocedure  for  community  participation  in  procurement  will  be  as  follows:  (i)  in  each  project\nprovince,  the  PUCDA  at  the  PES  will  explain  the  civil  work  packages  and  the  community\nmatching funds for school rehabilitation to the DEB; (ii) the DEB will explain the requirements for\ncommunity  participation  in  procurement  to  interested  communities  and  will  prepare  a  district\nschool construction plan including the use of the community matching funds and an assessment\nof  the  capacity  of  each  community  that  indicates  its  interest  in  undertaking  the  work;  (iii)  the\nPUCDA  and  the  Education  Construction  Service  at  MOE  will  review  and  approve  the  district\nschool  construction  plan;  (iv)  the  PUCDA  and  DEB  will  enter  into  discussions  with  the  local\n\n\f25\n\ncommunity  based  on  the  district  school  construction  plan;  and  (v)  based  on  the  review\ndiscussions and the criteria in the district school construction plan, the PES will award a contract\nto  communities  assessed  to  have  sufficient  capacity  to  undertake  the  work,  subject  to  ADB\nconcurrence.  The  civil  works  under  the  community  participation  will  be  supervised  by  the\nPUCDA  and  DEB  in  close  cooperation  with  the  district  construction  engineer  to  be  recruited\nunder  the  Project.  Payment  will  be  made  from  the  project  imprest  account  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook dated January 2001.\n\n4.\n\nConsulting Services, Fellowship, Training, and Studies\n\n81.\nThe  Project  will  use  consultants  to  build  the  capacity  of  MOE\u2019s  technical  departments,\nand  the  PESs  and  DEBs  involved  in  the  Project.  It  will  also  use  specialists  in  teacher  training\nand development to help develop and supervise teacher training programs in TDC and TTCs.\nWithin  three  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  MOE  will  submit  the  evaluation  criteria,  shortlists,\nterms  of  reference,  invitation  letters,  and  draft  contracts  for  recruitment  of  ADB-supported\nconsultants to ADB for review and approval. Approximately, 205 person-months of international\nconsulting  will  be  needed  (47  person-months  financed  by  ADB  and  158  person-months  by\nSida); 1,671 person-months of domestic consulting (1,512 person-months financed by ADB and\n159 person-months by Sida). This includes district construction engineers to be engaged for a\ntotal  of  984  person-months  to  supervise  civil  works  activities.  Local  contract  staff  will  be\nengaged for a total of 1,014 person-months to support the PIU at MOE, the PIUs and PUCDAs\nat  the  PES,  and  the  DPIUs  (678  person-months  financed  by  ADB  and  336  person-months\nfinanced  by  Sida).  All  international  and  domestic  consultants,  and  local  contract  staff  financed\nby  ADB  will  be  selected  and  engaged  by  the  Government  through  a  firm  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB\nconcerning  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants  and  local  contract  staff.  Consultants\nfinanced by Sida (Component 1: the building teacher training system and teacher development\ncapacity  subcomponent)  will  be  selected  and  engaged  by  Sida  through  a  firm  on  a  tied  basis\nand  administered  by  Sida  in  accordance  with  Sida\u2019s  guidelines.  The  award  of  all  consulting\ncontracts  or  specialist  subcontract  services  for  ADB-financed  studies,  monitoring,  and\nevaluation, or any activity for an amount greater than the equivalent of $10,000 will be subject to\nprior approval by ADB. For international training supported by Sida, the selection and award of\nfellowships  will  follow  Sida  guidelines.  The  PIU,  under  the  guidance  of  the  MOE  steering\ncommittee and in coordination with DPC, will be responsible for coordination between ADB- and\nSida-financed  consultants.  Consulting  service  requirements  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for\nconsultants are in Appendix 8.\n\n5.\n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\n82.\nTo expedite project implementation through the timely release of ADB\u2019s share of funds\nfor eligible expenditures, an imprest account will be established at the Bank of Lao PDR under\nthe  authority of the Ministry  of Finance within three months of loan effectiveness. The imprest\naccount will be established, operated, and liquidated in accordance with detailed arrangements\nagreed  upon  by  the  Borrower  and  ADB  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement\nHandbook  dated  January  2001.  The  imprest  account  will  be  used  mainly  for  financing  local\ncurrency expenditures, including indirect foreign exchange costs and some small expenditures\nin foreign currency. The initial deposit will be $170,000, which is the amount estimated to cover\nanticipated expenditures to meet the financing of eligible items under the imprest account in a\nsix-month  period.  Items  eligible  for  financing  through  the  imprest  account  include  staff\ndevelopment,  consultants  and  specialists,  civil  works,  equipment  and  furniture,  materials,  and\nproject implementation costs. Because project activities will take place in dispersed geographic\nareas where communication and transportation are difficult, simple mechanisms are required to\ndisburse  small  funds  quickly  through  decentralized  decision  making  while  maintaining\n\n\f26\n\nacceptable  levels  of  financial  control.  Accordingly,  subaccounts  will  be  established  and\nmanaged in MOE and in the PESs following the same guidelines. The initial amount in MOE will\nnot  exceed  $50,000  and  in  each  of  the  six  PESs  will  not  exceed  $20,000.  The  Ministry  of\nFinance  has  concurred  with  this  arrangement.  Statement  of  expenditure  procedures  with  a\nceiling of $50,000 per payment will be permitted.\n\n6.\n\nAccounts and Auditing\n\n83.\nThe Government, acting through MOE, will maintain records and accounts adequate to\nidentify goods and services financed from the proceeds of the loan. The PESs will also maintain\naccounts  for  relevant  project  activities  following  the  same  standards.  MOE  will  (i)  maintain\nseparate records and accounts for the Project; (ii) ensure that accounts and financial statements\nare audited in accordance with international auditing standards by auditors acceptable to ADB;\nand  (iii)  provide  ADB,  not  later  than  12  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year,  certified\ncopies of audited accounts and financial statements and the report of the auditor on these. ADB\nmay ask the Government to arrange for an independent audit, either local (National Audit Office)\nor international, to be financed from loan proceeds.\n\n7.\n\nReporting\n\nThe  PIU  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  project  implementation  and  submit  them  to\n84.\nADB and Sida through DPC within 30 days of the end of each respective quarter. The reports\nwill  be  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB  and  Sida,  and  will  indicate,  among  other  things,  (i)  the\nprogress  made  against  established  targets;  (ii)  problems  encountered  during  the  quarter,  and\nsteps  taken  and  proposed  to  be  taken  to  resolve  the  problems;  (iii)  compliance  with  loan\ncovenants;  and  (iv)  proposed  program  activities  to  be  undertaken  during  the  succeeding\nquarter. The PIU will prepare a project completion report and submit it to ADB through DPC not\nlater than three months following physical completion of the Project. The report will include the\ncosts and compliance with loan covenants.\n\n8.\n\nProject Performance\n\na.\n\nAnnual Operational Plans and Financial Reviews\n\n85.\nTo facilitate project implementation, four months before the start of each fiscal year, the\nGovernment  will  prepare  an  annual  operational  plan  for  the  next  Government  fiscal  year.  The\nannual  operational  plan  will  include  (i)  the  status  of  the  policy  framework;  (ii)  the  proposed\nallocations  to  the  education  sector;  (iii)  financial  plan  for  central  and  provincial  levels  for  the\ncounterpart funds and recurrent project expenditures; (iv) fully costed project activities for each\nsubcomponent, with performance targets; and (v) details of how proposed project activities are\nto be integrated into the subsector\u2019s ongoing programs. This will ensure a coherent coordinated\napproach  to  the  development  of  primary  and  secondary  education  and  will  help  to  avoid  any\nduplication of efforts. Further, the annual operational plan will confirm that the Government has\nallocated adequate resources for project implementation and recurrent budget for the Project.\n\nb.\n\nProject Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nIn accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation, monitoring,\n86.\nsupervision,  and  evaluation  will  be  built  into  the  project  activities  to  ensure  that  both  the\nimplementation  of  activities  and  their  impact  are  kept  under  constant  review.  Key  items  to  be\nmonitored are (i) the impact of training activities on the conduct of training and the impact of the\ntraining  on  the  performance  of  teachers  and  children;  (ii)  the  use  and  benefits  of  district\nconstruction funds to improve access to education; (iii) the distribution and use of school funds\n\n\f27\n\nand their impact on participation in education and children\u2019s learning; and (iv) the ability of the\nPIUs,  especially  at  PES  and  DEB  levels  to  manage  project  activities.  Key  personnel  will  be\nidentified to conduct this monitoring and evaluation. All technical departments at the MOE, PES,\nand  DEB  levels,  and  consultants  and  specialists  assisting  those  departments  will  be  charged\nwith designing monitoring activities and expanding the existing indicators. A particular focus of\nmonitoring will be on school improvement. Communities, schools (especially school principals),\nand PAs will be trained to monitor the implementation of project activities in their areas and their\nimpact  on  schools  and  their  children.  Project  resources  have  been  allocated  to  support\nmonitoring  visits  and  workshops  to  report  on  and  discuss  the  results  of  monitoring  and  plan\nfollow-up  activities  based  on  the  results  of  the  monitoring.  Civil  works  activities  will  be\nintensively  supervised  and  monitored.  Construction  engineers  will  be  stationed  in  each  district\nand a project engineer in each province. They will closely monitor and supervise the preparation\nand  implementation  of  construction  activities  in  their  areas.  They  will  be  coordinated  by  a\nnational project engineer to review the progress.\n\n87.\nThe impact indicators will be kept to a minimum and focus on the prime objectives of the\nProject: (i) increasing the supply and quality of teachers\u2014the indicators will measure changes in\nthe supply and qualifications of teachers; and the impact of project activities on teacher training\nand on teaching and learning in project classrooms, and changes in working conditions, career\nstructures,  and  accreditation  procedures  for  teachers;  (ii)  increasing  equitable  access  and\nparticipation in primary education in the project areas\u2014the indicators will measure changes in\nenrollment,  dropouts,  and  repetition,  focusing  especially  on  the  proportion  of  children  entering\ngrade  5,  particularly  with  reference  to  ethnic  minorities  and  girls;  and  (iii)  improving  education\nmanagement\u2014the \nthe  planning,\nimplementation, and monitoring of project inputs. To monitor the performance of TTCs, TDC will\ndevelop  monitoring  indicators  for  TTCs  and  teaching  improvements.  The  impact  on  student\nperformance  will  be  measured  by  a  special  study  to  be  undertaken  in  three  stages  at  the\nbeginning, middle, and end of the Project to measure changes in student performance in basic\nliteracy and numeracy.\n\ntimeliness  and  efficiency  of \n\nfocus  will  be  on \n\nthe \n\n9.\n\nMidterm Review\n\nIn  addition  to  regular  review,  the  Government,  Sida,  and  ADB  will  jointly  conduct  a\n88.\nmidterm  review  after  the  third  year  of  project  implementation.  The  review  will  be  assisted  by\ninternational and domestic consultants including a midterm review specialist. All aspects of the\nProject will be reviewed including the project scope, design and implementation arrangements,\nand  compliance  with  loan  conditions  and  covenants.  The  review  will  focus  in  particular  on  a\nnumber  of  activities  that  were  carried  out  to  determine  how  these  should  be  continued  or\nchanged  during  the  subsequent  phases.  The  review  will  recommend  areas  for  changes  in\nproject design or implementation, if any.\n\n89.\nMore  specifically,  the  midterm  review  will  focus  on  implementation  of  the  access  and\nparticipation  component,  in  particular  to  assess  the  degree  of  decentralization  of  the  planning\nand  implementation  of  activities  to  provinces  and  districts,  and  the  implementation  of\nconstruction  in  the  districts  and  of  the  matching  grant  programs  for  local  communities.  It  will\nreview the funds to schools to encourage learning and participation to determine if these funds\nshould be continued and possibly expanded to more schools. Specific attention will be given to\ntargets  to  increase  the  number  of  children  entering  grade  5.  In  the  quality  component,  the\nimplementation  of  in-service  training  programs  will  be  reviewed  to  assess  which  models  are\nproving most successful and whether they can be extended to new areas. Progress in improving\nthe  quality  of  the  TTCs  will  also  be  reviewed.  The  review  will  examine  the  progress  of  the\nTPWG and the extent to which the Government progressed toward adopting and implementing\nits  proposals  to  reform  teacher  incentives  including  salaries  and  working  conditions,  and\n\n\f28\n\nsimilarly examine progress of certification of preservice, upgrading, and in-service training. The\nmidterm  review  will  assess  the  results  of  the  studies  that  have  taken  place  and  the  extent  to\nwhich the lessons learned have been implemented.\n\nF.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n90.\nMOE will be the Executing Agency for the Project and will have overall responsibility for\ncoordinating and implementing project activities. MOE implemented the ADB-funded EQIP and\nthe  World  Bank-financed  EDP,  and  is  currently  implementing  two  ADB-funded  education\nprojects, the BEGP and the Postsecondary Education Rationalization Project (footnote 2). The\nimplementation  of  these  projects  is  generally  successful;  although  start-up  of  the  projects  and\ncivil work programs have experienced some delay. Although MOE\u2019s performance is considered\nadequate for project implementation, long-term assistance with project implementation through\nan international consultant and local qualified assistants is required. In addition, many activities\nwill  be  delegated  to  the  PES  and  DEB  levels  as  part  of  the  decentralization  of  education\nmanagement.  The  Project  will  provide  project  implementation  support  at  these  administrative\nlevels.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\n91.\nEnvironmental impacts of the Project were reviewed and no significant adverse impacts\nwere identified. However, any environmental consideration will be incorporated into all project-\nfunded school construction during implementation. The designs of the new schools will promote\nthe  use  of  local  materials  and  require  minimum  maintenance.  The  buildings  will  be  designed\nbased  on  climate  and  community  requirements.  Rehabilitated  buildings  and  extensions  of  old\nbuildings will be of minimum standard and will not negatively impact the environment. Emphasis\nwill also be strongly placed on water supply (for drinking and toilets) to promote good health and\nenvironmental sanitation for students and teachers in any new construction. Where new land is\nrequired,  the  following  steps  will  be  followed.  First,  available  public  land  will  be  identified  with\nthe  assistance  of  the  village  chief.  If  it  is  not  available  or  unsuitable,  private  land  without\nstructures and not being used for agricultural or other productive purposes will be identified and\npurchased through market transactions. The community may contribute land if the PUCDA and\nDEB staff, together with the village chief, confirm that (i) the land has no encroachers, squatters,\nor  other  encumbrances;  (ii)  the  contribution  of  land  area  is  not  more  than  5  percent  of  the\ncontributor\u2019s total landholding; (iii) the contributors are not poor; (iv) if any loss of production or\nphysical  displacement  is  envisaged,  which  should  not  be  significant,  community-based\nmitigation  measures  are  proposed  to  the  affected  people  before  they  make  the  decision;  and\n(v) verbal  or  written  agreement  by  all  the  contributors  and  affected  people  is  obtained.  If  all\nthese conditions cannot be met, which is unlikely, a short resettlement plan will be prepared by\nthe PIU in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement19 and will be submitted to\nADB for approval. The DEBs will monitor that community matching grants and school funds are\nnot directly spent for land acquisition. The PUCDA staff will be required to have experience in\nenvironmental  and  resource  management.  MOE  staff  will  receive  hands-on  training  in\nenvironmental promotion. Before any new construction, the site will be reviewed by the PUCDA\nstaff and project engineers as to its suitability.\n\n19 ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. In Handbook on Resettlement. Appendix 1. Manila.\n\n                  \n\n\f29\n\n2.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\na. \n\nGender and Ethnic Minorities\n\n92.\nA social analysis was undertaken in six provinces that examined attitudes to education\nfor  girls  and  the  situation  for  ethnic  minorities.  Focus  group  discussions  held  with  women\u2019s\ngroups, community leaders, teachers, and students were used to complement the findings of a\nlarge-scale survey covering 79 villages in 27 districts of 12 provinces carried out for the BEGP.\nThe findings pointed out that the dropout rate among girls is still very high and that girls attend\nall  levels  of  education  at  lower  rates  than  boys.  Many  girls  especially  repeat  primary  school\ngrade 1, and also dropout during the transition from the nearby incomplete school to a distant\ncomplete school. The social analysis indicates the following major constraints and obstacles to\ngirls\u2019  education:  poverty,  double  responsibilities  of  girls  within  the  family,  distances  to  school,\nlack of perceived returns in educating girls, cultural beliefs, and early marriages among ethnic\nminorities.  The  Project\u2019s  primary  school  construction  program  will  shorten  the  distance  to\nschool. Based on community demands, the Project will also provide funds to construct day-care\ncenters and recruit female community assistants to these centers, so that girls do not have to\nmiss school to take care of their younger siblings.\n\n93.\nAs a direct consequence of the low number of female graduates, the number of female\nteachers is fewer than male teachers. Among the ethnic minority communities, the gender gap\nfor  teachers  is  much  larger.  Female  teachers  face  special  constraints.  For  example,  many\nfemale teachers at the primary grade 1 level have class sizes of 110 and above. School funds\nprovided by the Project may be used to recruit community teaching assistants (mostly female) to\nassist such teachers in the overcrowded classrooms and to alleviate their burden and improve\nteaching  quality  for  both  boys  and  girls.  Where  teacher  training  facilities  are  constructed  or\nupgraded, day-care centers will be encouraged to be built to address the needs of female staff\nand  teachers.  Upgrading  of  incomplete  schools  to  complete  schools  will  also  help  reduce  the\nisolation of teachers in incomplete schools who are mainly female. Targeted training including a\npreparatory course is included to upgrade the qualifications of unqualified teachers, especially\nfemale  teachers.  Further,  the  Project  will  hire  about  1,200  new  locally  recruited  teachers,  of\nwhich at least 50 percent will be female.\n\n94.\nThe  educational  status  is  much  lower  among  the  non-Lao  ethnic  minority  groups.  While\nthe focus group discussions indicate an overwhelming interest in education opportunities for sons\nand daughters where schools already exist, this may not be the case where schools currently do\nnot exist. In fact, besides access problems, low educational status of parents and lack of parents\u2019\nunderstanding  of  the  value  of  education  especially  for  girls  appear  to  be  among  the  major\nconstraints to ethnic minority education. Under the Project, specific measures have been carefully\nconsidered to promote recruitment of ethnic minority teachers who teach in the same villages. In\nmany cases, ethnic minority students travel long distances to attend schools. The Project\u2019s access\ncomponent will begin to address this problem and open up access for students who have not had\nopportunities in the past. Ethnic minority students need to have relevant curriculum; this is being\nconsidered  at  the  early  grades  to  reduce  dropouts.  A  gender  and  ethnic  minority  strategy  has\nbeen developed for the Project, and is summarized in Appendix 9.\n\nb.\n\nCommunity Participation\n\nThe  focus  group  discussions  identified  that  in  most  places,  communities  are  playing\n95.\nmajor  roles  in  primary  education,  including  (i)  advocating  enrollment  and  education  benefits,\nespecially  for  girls;  (ii)  boosting  morale  of  school  staff;  (iii)  raising  money,  local  materials,  and\ncontributing  labor  for  school  construction  and  rehabilitation;  (iv)  providing  vendor  services  for\nlunch;  (v) identifying  suitable  land  for  school  construction  (a  role  usually  played  by  the  village\n\n\f30\n\nchief);  (vi) monitoring  students\u2019  school  attendance;  (vii)  monitoring  teachers\u2019  attendance  and\nperformance; (viii) asking the DEB to recruit teachers; (ix) providing local cultural information to\nteachers coming from outside; (x) providing security for teachers by preparing adequate housing\nfor  them;  and  (xi)  ensuring  school  schedules  meet  local  realities.  Where  complete  primary\nschools  already  exist,  a  formal  or  informal  school  committee  often  meets  monthly,  comprising\nschool  principals,  teachers,  village  chief,  and  community  representatives.  The  LWU  can  also\nplay a major role in raising the awareness of the community and school staff of the importance\nof girls\u2019 education, education that meets ethnic minority needs, and school nutrition programs.\nThe Project will strengthen partnerships between the community and schools through training,\nschool  management  planning,  and  provision  of  community  and  school  funds.  Participatory\nmonitoring  by  the  communities  of  the  use  of  funds  will  be  also  carried  out  to  ensure  the\naccountability  and  sustainability  of  community-based  school  management,  which  will  improve\nthe quality of primary education.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nSocioeconomic Analysis\n\n1.\n\nDirect Beneficiaries\n\n96.\nMany  teachers  will  benefit  from  new  and  improved  training  programs.  These  programs\nwill  include  over  2,000  graduates  annually  from  the  TTCs  who  will  emerge  better  fitted  for\nteaching; 2,400 unqualified teachers who will be trained and become qualified and able to teach\ntheir students better; and approximately 15,000 primary school teachers, 2,500 primary school\nprincipals, 3,000 secondary school teachers, and 500 secondary school principals who will take\npart in regular and repeated in-service training that will benefit their pupils and lead to enhanced\nperformance. This covers 55 percent of primary school teachers and 30 percent of secondary\nschool  teachers  in  the  country.  In  addition,  365  TTC  trainers,  108  TUP  trainers,  473  primary\nschool  PAs,  and  144  secondary  school  PAs  will  be  trained  on  a  regular  and  repeated  basis.\nThis  will  in  turn  ensure  the  quality  of  the  preservice,  upgrading,  and  in-service  training\nprograms.\n\n97.\nThe Project\u2019s access component will operate in poor, underserved areas in the selected\n41  districts.  The  Project  will  greatly  increase  the  opportunity  for  children  in  these  districts  to\nreceive  a  full  five-year  primary  education  by  building  approximately  45  classrooms  in  each\ndistrict.  The  emphasis  will  be  on  upgrading  the  incomplete  schools  to  complete  schools,  as\ndropout  is  high  for  the  early  grades.  The  Project  will  also  ensure  that  children  obtain  a  better\nquality primary education by assigning new teachers who will be trained through the Project. For\nprimary education, more than 400,000 students will be studying in the project-assisted schools\nby  the  end  of  the  Project;  about  30,000  in  newly  constructed  or  newly  completed  primary\nschools.  Through  in-service  teacher  training  and  upgrading  of  unqualified  teachers  in  an\nadditional  29  selected  districts  where  teacher  training  alone  will  be  implemented,  another\n150,000  primary  and  secondary  students  will  benefit  from  improved  education  quality.\nFurthermore,  the  improvements  to  preservice  training  through  the  TTCs  will  benefit  students\nnationwide.  Girls  and  ethnic  minority  children  will  especially  benefit  both  through  geographical\ntargeting and special assistance provided by the Project.\n\n2.\n\nEfficiency Benefits\n\n98.\nThe Project will ensure that the education system is more responsive to local needs. It\nwill,  for  example,  ensure  that  schools  are  built  of  an  appropriate  minimum  size  in  locations\nwhere they are needed, and that communities are able to maintain and support these schools.\n\n\f31\n\nThe Project will also ensure that teachers, learning materials, and operation and maintenance\nsupport are available in these schools. It will train new and existing teachers in more practical\nand relevant teaching methods, and primary schools will focus on basic literacy, numeracy, and\nmulti-grade teaching. This will ensure that teachers in the future will be more able to address the\nbasic needs of students, which will reduce dropouts and repetition and increase the number of\nschool  graduates,  while  simultaneously  decreasing  the  number  of  person-years  needed  to\nproduce each graduate. Economic analysis, including the assessment of cost-effectiveness and\ninternal efficiency gains, is in Appendix 10.\n\n3.\n\nInstitutional Strengthening\n\n99.\nConsiderable inputs will be made to upgrade institutional capacity at the MOE, PES, and\nDEB  levels.  Concerned  staff  of  MOE,  PESs,  and  DEBs  will  be  given  considerable  training  in\ndata  collection,  planning,  implementation,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  reporting  of  project\nactivities. MOE, NRIES, NUOL, TTC, and TDC staff will take part in graduate degree training.\nTTC  management  staff  will  be  given  training  and  on-the-job  support  by  consultants  to  enable\nthem  to  manage  their  colleges  more  effectively  and  efficiently.  Teachers,  principals,  trainers,\nand  senior  staff  at MOE, PESs, and  DEBs will enhance their understanding of good practices\nlearned  from  study  tours  to  neighboring  countries.  Awareness  raising  on  gender  and  ethnic\nminority issues in education management and delivery will be provided to relevant target groups\nby the MOE\u2019s GEMEU.\n\n100.\nThe  Project  will  also  assist  the  Government  in  strengthening  the  management  of\neducation,  in  particular  in  developing  appropriate  management  structures  and  capabilities  at\nprovince,  district,  and  village  levels,  thereby  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  decentralization\ninitiatives. It will introduce construction funds to enable districts to plan, manage, and implement\ntheir  own  construction  programs,  and  will  support  the  devolution  of  the  implementation  of\ntraining  activities  to  provinces  and  districts.  It  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  TTCs  to\nmanage and deliver pre- and in-service teacher training, and will help them expand their role to\ncontinuing education for the community, based on local demand. The Project will strengthen the\nplanning capacity of MOE departments involved in teacher training and development, and help\nthem with strategic planning for prioritizing expenditures through a variety of operational studies,\nand  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities.  It  will  also  assist  MOE  with  its  efforts  to  institute\nimproved  salaries  and  working  conditions  for  teachers.  It  will  work  with  other  assistance\nagencies,  especially  the  World  Bank,  to  establish  better  data  collection  systems  and  to  train\nconcerned  staff  in  planning  and  budgeting.  Although  most  project  activities  will  be  delivered\nthrough existing delivery systems, the Project will strengthen these systems and the capability\nof their staff to plan, manage, monitor and evaluate, and report their activities.\n\n4.\n\nSustainability\n\n101. Adequate measures have been incorporated into the Project to ensure its sustainability\nafter  implementation.  As  a  prerequisite  to  project  participation,  communities  must  be  willing  to\nsupport schools constructed in their areas including assisting with construction, operation, and\nmaintenance, and mobilizing their students. Recognizing that communities, especially those in\npoorer areas cannot be expected to cover the full cost of their children\u2019s education, the Project\nwill provide school funds to support local management of resources. This model is expected to\nbe taken over by the Government and to become the norm for all schools in the country. The\nProject  will  develop  training  capacity  at  TTCs  that  will  become  the  source  of  the  future\ngenerations of teachers. The Project will also take advantage of low-cost models of in-service\nteacher  training,  in  particular  using  primary  school  clusters  and  the  NTUCs.  Government\ncounterpart funding is being mainly allocated to: the funding of new teachers for schools built by\nthe Project, school funds, upgrading of unqualified teachers, and in-service teacher training. As\n\n\f32\n\na  percentage  of  total  education  spending,  this  accounts  for  about  2.6  percent  of  projected\nrecurrent  expenditure  for  basic  education  spending  and  is  sustainable  after  the  end  of  the\nProject, even under conditions of modest GDP and education budget growth. The Government\nwill provide counterpart funding for civil works. This financial contribution will equal an estimated\n8 percent of total domestic investment in the education sector during project implementation.\n\n102.\nThe  success  and  sustainability  of  the  Project  depends  on  ongoing  reforms  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s  education  finance  policy.  Central  to  this  is  a  commitment  to  increase  recurrent\nspending to levels that are more in line with regional standards. This is necessary to ensure that\n(i)  higher  salaries  are  paid  to  teachers  to  encourage  teachers  to  remain  in  their  jobs,  (ii)  new\nteachers are hired to meet growing enrollment, and (iii) investments made by the Project in new\nand rehabilitated infrastructure will be properly maintained. ADB engaged in long-term dialogue\nwith  Government  and  assistance  agencies  during  project  preparation  concerning  the  need  to\nincrease recurrent spending on education to regional norms. Based on reasonable assumptions\n(including  a  5.5  percent  real  GDP  growth  per  annum  and  a  gradual  increase  in  the\nGovernment\u2019s  education  budget  share  up  to  15  percent  of  total  expenditure),  the  Government\nwill  be  able  to  meet  these  challenges  to  the  education  sector.  These  assumptions  are\nconservative, given the Lao PDR\u2019s recent economic performance and the assumptions included\nin the Government report presented at the seventh Roundtable Meeting, November 2000. The\nGovernment  has  given  further  assurances  that  the  social  sectors,  including  education,  will  be\ngiven increasing priority. One sign of this commitment has been a recent substantial increase in\nteachers\u2019 salaries, which is expected to be followed-up by an additional increase in the next two\nto three years.\n\nB.\n\nImpact on Poverty and Gender\n\n103.\nThe  Project  is  classified  as  poverty  intervention.  The  Project  will  promote  significant\nintergenerational  improvements  raising  income  and  reducing  poverty  among  families  in  the\ntarget  districts.  With  the  component  packaging  under  the  Project,  the  proportion  of  poor\nbeneficiaries of the Project will be higher than the national poverty incidence level. This estimate\nis  based  on  certain  assumptions  on  prioritized  outreach  of  teacher  training  and  school\ncompletions  associated  with  the  project  design  and  focus  that  lead  to  the  Project  having  a\nhigher poverty impact (on a headcount basis) than the national poverty incidence level of 38.6\npercent (footnote 7). While the whole country can be considered poor, the Project is envisaged\nto  disproportionately  benefit  those  living  below  the  poverty  line.  Children  who  graduate  from\nprimary  education  are  likely  to  be  more  productive  than  their  parents.  Educated  farmers  are\nbetter equipped to adopt new practices that will raise crop yields; they are more likely to improve\ntheir  animal  husbandry  practices  and  adopt  more  modern  methods  of  sustainable  agriculture\nand forest management. In addition, reasonable levels of literacy and numeracy are immediate\nbenefits to those in trade and cash generating activities. Once educated, their career aspirations\nmay  improve,  and  the  receptiveness  to  new  ideas,  information,  and  technology  will  increase.\nEconomic analysis including poverty impact of the Project is in Appendix 10.\n\n104.\nFurther  the  improvements  to  preservice  teacher  training  through  the  TTCs  will  benefit\nstudents nationwide. The focus of the training for primary teachers is to improve (i) basic literacy\nand  numeracy,  especially  in  the  early  grades,  and  (ii)  implementation  of  multigrade  teaching,\nwhere  appropriate.  In  these  areas,  failure  in  the  early  grades  is  one  of  major  issues  of  the\nsystem, which leads to huge numbers of children repeating classes and dropping out of school.\nProject activities are expected to have a significant impact on reducing dropouts and repetitions,\nand  increasing  student  performance  in  basic  literacy  and  numeracy,  especially  in  those  poor,\nremote areas where these problems are at their greatest.\n\n\f33\n\n105.\nThe  Project\u2019s  thematic  classification  is  gender  and  development.  Nearly  50  percent  of\nstudents  who  will  be  studying  in  the  project-assisted  primary  schools  will  be  girls.  Women  will\nconstitute at least 50 percent of newly recruited or appointed teachers, new PAs, and trainees\nfor  teacher  training  programs.  Furthermore,  better  educational  results,  particularly  for  women,\nand more so for ethnic minority women, are expected to have significant social consequences,\nnamely  improved  maternal  mortality  rates;  more  widespread  adoption  of  preventive,  primary\nhealth care measures; and more acceptance of family planning methods. Through the improved\neducational  results  for  girls,  women,  and  ethnic  minorities,  as  well  as  the  emergence  of  more\nrole models of educated girls, the cultural barriers to girls\u2019 education including the perceived low\nreturn  and  cultural  traditions  such  as  early  marriage  are  expected  to  change  in  the  long  term.\nThe specific measures to address gender issues have been included in the gender and ethnic\nminority strategy, which is in Appendix 9.\n\nC.\n\nRisks\n\n106.\nThe  Project  covers  a  wide  range  of  teacher  training,  construction,  and  management\nactivities  at  various  administrative  levels.  Previous  projects  have  faced  delays  because  of  the\nestablishment of new systems and procedures. This Project has tried as far as possible to build\non and collaborate with existing systems, for example, the PA system, school clusters, and the\nTUP-NTUC system for teacher training, and using PUCDAs to plan and supervise construction.\nHowever,  it  places  a  heavy  responsibility  on  the  PIU  under  DTT  to  effectively  implement  the\nProject  by  coordinating  with  other  departments  of  MOE  and  concerned  agencies,  and  PPIUs\nand DPIUs; and on DPC to provide overall project coordination including liaison with ADB, Sida,\nand  other  development  partners.  These  responsibilities  will  challenge  the  capacity  of  these\nMOE departments. To address this concern, the Project will focus, during the first year of each\nof  four  phases,  on  working  in  a  limited  number  of  districts  to  develop  the  core  project\nmanagement  and  implementation  capacity  by  providing  extra  staff,  facilities,  logistic  support,\nand  training.  A  second  risk  is  increased  recurrent  costs,  resulting  mainly  from  operating  and\nmaintaining new or rehabilitated complete primary schools, upgraded TTCs, and the large-scale\ntraining  program  covering  primary  and  secondary  teachers  nationwide  on  a  continuous  basis.\nBased on likely financing scenarios during and beyond the project period, this risk is likely to be\nmanageable.\n\n107.\nThe  major  development  will  be  in  the  extent  of  the  decentralization  of  planning  and\nimplementing  construction  activities,  and  the  fund  channeling  mechanisms  needed  to  support\nthis. The project activities will be carefully phased with only eight districts taking part in the first\nstage  of  the  construction  activities.  The  first  year  activities  consist  mainly  of  planning  and\npreparation. These districts and the PESs will be given substantial and concentrated consulting\nservices and training, particularly during the first two years of the Project, when all involved will\nbe  at  a  learning  stage.  The  DEBs  will  be  provided  with  district  construction  engineers  to\nsupervise  the  civil  works,  and  budgets  to  support  day-to-day  operations,  undertake  fieldwork,\nand hold meetings.\n\n108. Previous projects have reported long delays in the approval of activities, as plans have\nhad  to  be  referred  to  much  higher  levels,  often  to  the  minister  of  education.  Delays  have  also\noccurred  as  funding  mechanisms  have  not  been  in  place  to  allow  the  flow  of  funds  to  the\nappropriate levels in the system in time. Procedures must be streamlined so that activities can\nbe  implemented  without  long  delays  while  waiting  for  approval,  and  that  efficient  mechanisms\nexist to channel sufficient funds to provinces, districts, clusters, and schools. This should be a\npriority of the Government during the pre-project implementation period.\n\n109.\nThe  involvement  of  communities  in  school  construction  and  improvement  has  clearly\nbeen shown to be the most effective way of improving access to and participation in education,\n\n\f(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n34\n\nand  has  a  significant  role  in  raising  quality.  To  match  the  investment  to  the  varying  needs  of\nlocal\nlocal  communities,  several  different \ncommunities  and  schools.  These  have  proved  effective  when  given  by  other  assistance\nagencies  such  as  UNICEF  and  some  NGOs,  where  close  supervision  has  been  exercised  to\nensure that the use of the funds is well planned and executed. By the use of district construction\nengineers and project engineers, consulting services provided to MOE, PESs, and DEBs, and\nthe  openness  of  the  local  community  to  monitor  use  of  funds,  the  proposed  schemes  can  be\nsimilarly effective under this Project.\n\ninitiatives  are  proposed, \n\nincluding \n\nfunds \n\nto \n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n110.\nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:\n.\n\nThe Government will make available an annual budget for education of at least\n12 percent of total Government expenditure in FY2001/02, at least 13 percent in\nFY2003/04,  and  for  the  medium  term,  up  to  a  minimum  of  15  percent  by\nFY2005/06.\n\nThe  PPIU  in  each  of  six  provinces  (Bokeo,  Champassak,  Louang  Phrabang,\nSavannakhet,  Sayaburi,  and  Vientiane)  will  be  established  and  staffed  to  the\nsatisfaction to ADB within three months of loan effectiveness.\n\nThe  PPIU  in  each  of  three  provinces  (Louang  Namtha,  Saravan,  and  Xieng\nKhouang) will be established and staffed to the satisfaction of ADB at least three\nmonths prior to the third anniversary of loan effectiveness;\n\nThe  DPIU  in  each  project  district  will  be  established  and  staffed  to  the\nsatisfaction  of  ADB  on  the  following  schedule:  (a)  for  the  12  project  districts  in\nphase 1, within six months of loan effectiveness; (b) for the 12 project districts in\nphase  2,  no  later  than  three  months  after  the  first  anniversary  of  loan\neffectiveness;  (c)  for  the  37  project  districts  in  phase  3,  no  later  than  three\nmonths  after  the  second  anniversary  of  loan  effectiveness;  and  (d)  for  the  9\nproject districts in phase 4, no later than three months after the third anniversary\nof loan effectiveness.\n\n(v) \n\nMOE  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  an  annual  operational  plan,  including  a\nproposed  financial  plan  for  the  central  and  provincial  counterpart  funds  and\nrecurrent expenditures of the Project, four months before the start of each fiscal\nyear of the Government during the Project.\n\n(vi)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, MOE will appoint all members of the\n\nTPWG including staff of the GEMEU satisfactory to ADB.\n\n(vii)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, MOE will appoint all members of the\n\ncurriculum and material development team satisfactory to ADB.\n\n(viii)  Each  of  the  MOE  steering  committee,  PIU  at  DTT,  PPIUs,  DPIUs,  and  TPWG,\nafter  it  is  established  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  this  report,  will  be\nmaintained during the Project.\n\n\f35\n\n(ix)  MOE will submit the list of project villages and schools (selected based on criteria\nacceptable  to  ADB)  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  on  the  following  time\nschedule: (a) for villages and schools in the 12 project districts in phase 1, within\nsix  months  of  loan  effectiveness;  (b)  for  the  villages  and  schools  in  the  twelve\nproject districts in phase 2, no later than three months after the first anniversary\nof loan effectiveness; (c) for the villages and schools in the 37 project districts in\nphase  3,  no  later  than  three  months  after  the  second  anniversary  of  loan\neffectiveness;  and  (d)  for  the  villages  and  schools  in  the  9  project  districts  in\nphase  4,  no  later  than  three  months  after  the  third  anniversary  of  loan\neffectiveness;\n\n(x)  Within two years of loan effectiveness, MOE will develop guidelines satisfactory\nto ADB for certification of teachers and the National Teacher Education Advisory\nBoard will formally approve the guidelines; and\n\n(xi) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  environmental  and  social  considerations,\nincluding the existing laws and regulations of the Lao PDR; ADB\u2019s environmental\nguidelines  and  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement,  indigenous  peoples,  and\ngender  and  development;  and  the  Project\u2019s  gender  and  ethnic  minority  strategy\nare implemented for all project activities.\n\nB.\n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness\n\nThe  Government  and  the  Government  of  Sweden  will  have  entered  into  an  agreement\n111.\nrelating  to  the  Sida  grant,  and  all  conditions  precedent  to  the  effectiveness  of  the  Sida  grant\n(other  than  a  condition  requiring  the  effectiveness  of  the  ADB  loan)  will  have  been  fulfilled  or\narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  have  been  made  for  the  fulfillment  of  those  conditions\nwithin a period of time satisfactory to ADB.\n\nVII.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n112.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  15,756,000  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  the  Second\nEducation Quality Improvement Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8\nyears, and with an interest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period\nand 1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially\nin accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\n31 August 2001\n\n       TADAO CHINO\n\n    \n\nPresident\n\n\fPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n37\n\n43\n\n44\n\n47\n\n57\n\n59\n\n62\n\n63\n\n69\n\n73\n\n1, 2\n\n10, 37\n\n13, 45\n\n17, 55\n\n21, 70\n\n24, 76\n\n24, 77\n\n25, 81\n\n29, 94\n\n31, 98\n\n36\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\n\nTitle\n\nProject Framework\n\nExternal Assistance to Basic Education\n\nPolicy Framework\n\nDescription of Project Components\n\nProject Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nIndicative Procurement Packages\n\nConsultant  Service  Requirements  and  Outline  Terms  of\nReference for Consultants\n\nSummary Gender and Ethnic Minority Strategy\n\n10\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\n\nKey Features of ADB and the World Bank Funded Projects\n\nLessons Learned\n\nCriteria for Village Selection and Proposed Models for\nSchool Construction and Rehabilitation\n\nProject Management and Implementation Chart\n\nFund Flow Chart\n\nProject Performance and Monitoring Indicators\n\nProject Ethnic Minority Strategy\n\nDetails of Economic Analysis\n\nFinancial Sustainability Analysis\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\n\fDesign Summary\n\n1.

This should include a\ncommitment to increasing\nrecurrent expenditures by\nretaining the share of primary\neducation budget at 55 percent of\nthe total education expenditure\nand by raising teachers\u2019 salaries\ncloser to the regional average\nbased on a more appropriate\nincentive system.\n\n(i)  Consulting services will be given to\nthe MOE\u2019s Department of Finance\nand Department of Planning and\nInternational Cooperation to formulate\neducation budgets and proposals,\nand to promote these within the\nGovernment. The TPWG will propose\na way to improve teacher incentives\nincluding salaries and career\nstructures. The Project will assist the\nTPWG in obtaining acceptance by the\nGovernment and incorporating its\nrecommendations into Government\nplans.\n\n(i)  Recurrent expenditures are\n\nincreased, which provide for an\nadequately sized and\nremunerated teaching force,\nadequate operation and\nmaintenance of schools, and\nsustainable teacher training\nprograms.\n\n2.  The Government will continue to\nrecognize the leadership role of\nthe technical departments of\nMOE.\n\n(i)  Planning and management training\nto be offered to MOE personnel\ninvolved in the project activities.\n\n(i)  Government plans are more\n\nuseful for management purposes.\nPlans are linked with education\nbudgets.\n\n3.  The Government will support the\n\n(i)  Planning, budgeting, and\n\n(i)  Provinces and districts are\n\ndecentralization of\nresponsibilities for planning,\nbudgeting, and implementation to\nthe provincial and district levels\nand the allocation of budgets to\nsupport activities at these levels.\n\nimplementation of teacher training\nand school construction programs\nwill be delegated to the provincial\nand district levels. Technical and\nlogistical support and capacity\nbuilding training will be given to\nfacilitate the transitional phase.\n\nincreasingly engaged in strategic\nand action planning that are\nmatched to their own needs and\ndemands.\n\n4.  The Government will introduce\nsimplified procedures to ensure\nsmooth and prompt\nimplementation of project\nactivities.\n\n(i)  Subaccounts will be established and\n\n(i)  Project activities are carried out\n\nmanaged in MOE and PESs\nrespectively.\n\n(ii)  Implementation of Project activities\n\nis delegated to various agencies and\nlevels including the teacher\ndevelopment center, TTC, PESs,\nDEBs, school clusters, and villages.\n\nefficiently and without procedural\ndelays caused by waiting for\nplanning or budget approval or\nwaiting for budgets to be\ntransferred.\n\n5.  The Government will facilitate\ninformation exchange across\nprovinces and districts related to\nproject progress, and encourages\nthe development of a community\nlevel accountability system.\n\n(i)  MOE will build a stronger network of\n\n(i) \n\neducation planners and managers.\n\n(ii)  Communities will be involved in such\ngroups as school management\ncommittees, parents groups, and\nother citizens groups in the design\nand management of school plans.\n\nInformation and insights from\ntarget provinces and districts\nbecome part of decision making\nat the MOE level.\n\n(ii)  Community decision making\n\nbecomes more transparent and\nprovides open access to\navailable information.\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 4, page 1\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROJECT COMPONENTS\n\nA.\n\nComponent 1: Improving the Quality of Teaching and Learning\n\n1.\n\nBuilding Teacher Training System and Teacher Development Capacity 1\n\na.\n\nTeacher Education Strategy Development\n\n1.\nThe  Department  of  Teacher  Training  (DTT)  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  will\nproduce  a  teacher  education  strategy  paper  within  18  months  of  loan  effectiveness  to  the\nsatisfaction  to  the  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida)  and  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  The  paper,  among  others,  will  address  the  need  to  reform  the\nexisting  preservice  teacher  training  framework,  based  on  a  long-term  teachers\u2019  supply  and\ndemand  analysis,  and  in  light  of  the  increasing  role  of  teacher  training  colleges  (TTCs)  in  in-\nservice  teacher  training  programs.  In  addition,  consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  support\nDTT,  Department  of  General  Education  (DGE),  National  Research  Institute  for  Education\nSciences  (NRIES),  teacher  development  center  (TDC),  Faculty  of  Education  of  the  National\nUniversity  of  Laos  (NUOL),  and  other  MOE  departments  involved  in  teacher  training  to  help\nthem  review  the  priorities  and  develop  more  detailed  and  operational  plans  to  achieve  these\npriorities.\n\nb.\n\nCourse Development\n\n2.\nA  Coordinated  Approach  to  Teacher  Training.  DTT  will  direct  and  coordinate  the\ndevelopment of all teacher training programs. This will include ensuring that programs follow a\nset  of  objectives  agreed  by  all  the  various  stakeholders,  and  that  training  and  curriculum\nmaterials  are  shared  across  programs.  Staff  of  DTT,  DGE,  TDC,  NRIES,  NUOL,  TTCs,\npedagogical  adviser  (PA)  master  trainers,  teacher  upgrading  program  (TUP)  trainers  and  PAs\nwill form a curriculum and materials development team and collaborate with TDC to develop the\nvarious curricula, guidelines, and supporting materials.\n\n3.\nTraining  Needs  Assessment.  DTT,  working  with  the  curriculum  and  materials\ndevelopment team to be established within three months of loan effectiveness, will undertake a\ntraining needs assessment survey. This will include: visits to TTCs to review the effectiveness of\nthe implementation of the preservice teacher training curriculum developed under the Education\nQuality Improvement Project (EQIP)2; discussions with staff and students of TTCs; visits to the\nTUP and network teacher upgrading centers (NTUCs), school clusters, and schools to consult\nwith principals and teachers; and classrooms observations and discussions with PAs.\n\n4.\nDeveloping  National  Teacher  Competencies.  To  monitor  various  training  activities,\nclear  outcomes  of  training  must  be  defined,  based  on  models  of  effective  teaching  as  well  as\nreal conditions prevailing in schools across the country. Such outcomes will be laid out in a list\nof national teacher competencies with core competencies required for teachers. Development of\nthe  national  teacher  competencies  will  be  the  responsibility  of  TDC  and  the  curriculum  and\nmaterials development team. The competencies will be reviewed, discussed and refined during\nthe  training  of  trainers  and  provincial  and  district  training.  They  will  be  modified  at  annual\nworkshops. Monitoring and evaluation activities based on the national teacher competencies will\nbe designed during TTC staff, PA, academic teacher, and school principal training.\n\n                  \n\n1 Subject  to  minor  adjustments  according  to  the  project  agreement  between  the  Government  and  the  Swedish\nInternational Development Cooperation Agency, which will be finalised to the satisfaction of the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) prior to the effectiveness of ADB loan.\n\n2 Loan 1103-LAO: Education Quality Improvement Project, for $13.3 million, approved on 26 September 1991.\n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\n5.\nCurriculum  and  Materials  Development  for  All  Training  Courses.  The  curriculum\nand materials development team will develop training curricula and materials, using the national\nteacher competencies as their guide and according to certification guidelines as appropriate, for\n(i)  preservice  training  at  the  TTCs,  (ii)  the  TUP,  (iii)  PAs  and  academic  teachers,  (iv)  school\nclusters,  (v)  secondary  school  principals,  and  (vi)  TTC  management  staff.  Training  materials,\nincluding  curriculum  handbooks,  TTC  textbooks,  TUP,  and  PA  training  materials,  will  be\ndeveloped,  produced,  and  delivered  in  sufficient  quantities  to  support  the  implementation  of\neach curriculum. The curricula and materials developed will need to be flexible enough to take\ninto account the diversity of needs and situations in the educational context of the country.\n\n6.\nEstablishing  Guidelines  for  Certification  of  Teachers.  DTT,  working  with  DGE,\nDepartment  of  Personnel,  TDC  and  TTCs,  will  develop  guidelines  for  certification  of  teachers\ntaking  part  in  preservice,  upgrading  programs,  training  of  trainers,  and  in-service  programs.\nThese  guidelines  will  include  consideration  of  the  learning  outcomes,  course  content,\nassessment strategies, and the national teacher competencies. The guidelines will be flexible in\norder to cater to the diversity of needs and situations in the country\u2019s educational context. Within\ntwo years of loan effectiveness, MOE will develop guidelines satisfactory to ADB for certification\nof  teachers,  and  the  National  Teacher  Education  Advisory  Board  will  formally  approve  the\nguidelines, for certification. New training courses will be developed according to the guidelines,\nand  the  existing  training  courses  will  be  reviewed  according  to  the  guidelines.  A  database  of\ncourse  implementation  and  teacher  participation  in  teacher  training  courses  will  be  created  at\nthe provincial education service (PESs).\n\nc.\n\nTraining of Trainers\n\n7.\nThe  Project  will  as  far  as  possible  use  and  improve  existing  training  structures  with\nwhich the education management authorities are already familiar, rather than setting up totally\nnew  structures.  It  will  strengthen  the  system  capacity  to  provide  coherent  teacher  training\nprograms using the existing trainers. These include TTC staff, TUP trainers, secondary school\nPAs based in each province, primary school PAs based in each district, and academic teachers\nbased  at  the  school  cluster  level.  Training  for  PAs  and  academic  teachers  should  focus  on\nimproving the performance of schools and will reflect local priorities. The training will encourage\nparticipatory training, practical activities, and interactive methodology. The focus of the training\nfor  primary  schools  will  include  multigrade  teaching,3  where  appropriate,  and  a  school  and\ncommunity-based  approach  to  problem  solving  in  schools  related  to  pupil  retention,  large\nclasses, and raising literacy and numeracy attainment.\n\n8.\nMaster  and  Doctoral  Courses  for  TTC  and  Other  Staff.  A  cadre  of  well  trained\nprofessionals in the country is needed to introduce and develop new approaches to education and\ntraining on a self-sustaining basis. Sixty persons will participate in specially designed master level\nprograms,  including  five  months  on-campus  training  outside  the  country  during  holiday  periods\nover two years and field activities carried out in-country during term time. Forty participants will be\nfrom the 8 TTCs (an average of 5 per TTC), 5 from TDC, 5 from DTT, 5 from DGE, and 5 from\nother Government agencies, including NRIES and NUOL. At least 30 percent of the trainees will\nbe women and 35 percent of the trainees will represent ethnic minorities. Content will include an\naction research focus and will be linked to actual work carried out in TTCs and classroom practice\nin  schools.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  develop  the  course  jointly  with  NUOL,  TDC\nstaff, and TTC representatives. A total of 10 persons will be nominated from MOE and TTCs to\ntake a doctoral course outside the country.\n\n9.\nProfessional Development for TTC Staff. Professional training will be given to all staff\nof the eight TTCs. A group of six staff from each TTC will be selected for training as trainers and\n\n                  \n\n3 The  training  in  multigrade  and  Lao  language  will  make  use  of  materials  and  approaches  developed  under  Loan\n\n1621-LAO: Basic Education (Girls) Project (BEGP), for $20 million, approved on 25 June 1998.\n\n\f49\n\nAppendix 4, page 3\n\nwill receive 56 days training by consultants at the central level to prepare them to deliver training\nin  their  TTCs.  One  of  the  six  from  each  TTC  will  be  nominated  as  a  counterpart  for  the\nconsultant and act as a leader of the group in each TTC. The trainers at each TTC working with\nthe  consultants  will  organize  training  for  60  days  during  the  second  and  the  third  years  of  the\nProject. This will include approximately 30 days training in the TTC and 30 days practical work\nmainly in the schools. The training will focus on developing more practical training approaches\nlinked  to  the  new  preservice  and  upgrading  curriculum,  which  the  staff  of  the  TTC  will  be\ncharged with delivering. All the TTC staff (currently 365 persons) will take part in these activities.\nTeacher training consultants will be stationed for the second and the third years of the Project in\ntwo strategically situated TTCs: Louang Phrabang, and Pakse to assist with the training in the\nTTCs located in the north (Louang Namtha, Louang Phrabang, and Xieng Khouang) and south\n(Pakse, Saravane, and Savannakhet) of the country respectively, while the consultant stationed\nat MOE will assist the TTCs situated in Vientiane Province and Vientiane Municipality.\n\n10.\nSupport  for  PAs.  Secondary  and  primary  school  PAs  are  key  persons  to  support  and\nsupervise teachers at provincial and district levels in delivering classroom teaching and learning\nactivities. Duty statements laying out their role will be developed together with the PAs (during\ntraining), and discussions will take place with the Government to ensure the status of the PAs is\ninstitutionalized. Funding will be included in the Project for them to make regular school visits for\non-the-job training and monitoring. Motorcycles will be replaced where necessary, and operation\nand maintenance costs will be provided by the Government.\n\n11. Workshops for Master Trainers. Two teams of PA master trainers exist, whose duty it\nis  to  train  primary  and  secondary  school  PAs.  They  include  staff  from  DGE,  TTCs,  TUP,  and\nPESs. There are 47 primary school master trainers (including 7 from DGE) and 42 secondary\nschool  master  trainers,  including  6  from  DGE).  The  Project  will  support  seven-day  annual\nworkshops at the national level for these master trainers to prepare for the PA training.\n\nTraining  of  PAs  to  Support  the  Primary  School  District  Level  Programs.  Although\n12.\nthe in-service training and upgrading activities to be developed under the Project will not be fully\nimplemented in all districts in the country within the project period, it is proposed to sustain and\ndevelop  the  existing  PA  training  capacity  in  all  districts.  All  473  primary  PAs,  including  those\nnewly  appointed  under  the  Basic  Education  (Girls)  Project  (footnote  2)  (BEGP)  will  be  trained\nannually for 12 days by the primary PA master trainers for the duration of the Project.\n\n13.\nTraining  of  Lower  Secondary  In-Service  Trainers  (PAs  and  TTC  staff).  The  PA\ntraining  for  secondary  schools  will  also  cover  all  provinces,  although  the  delivery  of  training\nprograms  supported  by  the  Project  will  cover  only  9  provinces.  One  hundred  and  forty-four\nsecondary  PAs  covering  all  18  provinces  will  be  trained  as  trainers  for  secondary  teacher  in-\nservice courses. They will be supplemented by 60 TTC staff (an average of 10 from each of the\n5  TTCs  that  have  a  secondary  school  program),  as  the  number  of  secondary  PAs  will  be\ninsufficient to carry out the in-service training program. Training of PAs and TTC trainers will be\n12 days each year.\n\nTraining  of  Replacement  PAs.  Provision  will  be  made  for  initial  training  of  new  and\n14.\nreplacement  PAs.  Four  hundred  and  twenty  new  primary  and  216  new  secondary  PAs  will  be\ntrained  over  six  years,  representing  a  replacement  rate  of  approximately  15  percent  and  25\npercent. The training costs have been high in the past, over $1,000 per person for primary PAs\nand over $1,300 for secondary PAs. A new curriculum will be developed, which considers the\nquality  and  cost-efficiency  of  PA  training.  Over  350  primary  and  200  secondary  replacement\nPAs are expected to be trained over the project period.\n\nTraining  of  TUP  Trainers.  Provision  has  been  made  for  the  annual  training  of  TUP\n15.\ntrainers to prepare them for upgrading unqualified primary school teachers; 108 trainers (6 from\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 4, page 4\n\neach of the 18 provinces) will be trained annually for 28 days by the national trainers provided\nby DTT. These trainers will support the whole TUP, which will be funded partly by this Project\nand  partly  by  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  and  be  managed  by  a  DTT  unit.\nMotorcycles  will  be  replaced  where  necessary,  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  will  be\nprovided by the Government.\n\n16.\nTraining of Academic Teachers. Each primary school cluster is supported by a group\nof  academic  teachers.  These  are  teachers  of  above  average  performance  who  are  trained  to\nlead  activities  for  other  teachers  in  the  cluster.  Approximately  700  academic  teachers  will  be\ntrained as facilitators for primary in-service training conducted at the cluster level. The academic\nteachers will be trained for 10 days annually by primary PA master trainers.\n\nd.\n\nTTC Management\n\n17.\nManagement Training for TTC Directors and Senior Staff. TTC management must be\nstrengthened  to  improve  existing  programs  and  to  enable  the  introduction  of  new  programs.\nManagement training of 24 days over two years will be provided at TDC for 32 senior TTC staff,\nwith follow-up on-the-job support at the TTCs from the consultants. This will focus on improving\nthe  management  (including  resource  mobilization  for  operation  and  maintenance)  of  teacher\ntraining facilities, equipment, and activities.\n\n18.\nDeveloping  Continuing  Education  Models  at  the  TTCs.  A  number  of  TTCs,  notably\nthose  in  Louang  Phrabang  and  Pakse,  have  started  to  diversify  their  activities  by  offering\ncourses  for  the  community  based  on  local  demand.  In  the  long  term,  the  Government  plan  to\ndevelop  certain  TTCs  into  regional  colleges.  A  study  will  be  conducted  during  the  first  year  of\nthe  Project  to  review  current  continuing  education  models  and  their  potential  for  expansion\n(para. 21). The Project will support the TTCs in developing pilot models of continuing education\nwhere there is demand.\n\n19.\nPilot  Project  on  Use  of  Distance  Learning  Strategies.  Many  new  teachers  who  are\nnot fully qualified will likely be recruited to meet the needs of the expanding primary education\nsystem.  A  pilot  project  will  be  launched  to  reach  out  to  the  newly  recruited  teachers  through\ndistance learning in a selected province with the TTC as the main coordinating institution. The\nexisting materials will be used with appropriate modification for this purpose.\n\ne.\n\nStudy Visits to Neighboring Countries\n\n20.\nThe  Project  will  support  study  visits  mainly  for  teachers,  principals,  and  trainers  (75\npercent  of  participants;  of  which  at  least  40  percent  will  be  women)  so  that  they  can  make\ncomparisons and learn lessons from other countries, and upgrading and training.\n\nf.\n\nOperational Studies\n\n21.\nA  number  of  studies  will  take  place  to  support  the  planning  and  implementation  of  the\nquality improvement program, including studies on (i) the performance of teachers with different\ntraining  backgrounds  (5+3,  8+3  etc.)  as  part  of  an  assessment  of  their  training  needs;  (ii)  the\neffectiveness  of  existing  school  clusters,  their  patterns  of  activities  and  their  potential  for\nexpansion; (iii) TTC students to discover how many do not enter teaching and reasons for this;\n(iv)  existing  continuing  education  activities  at  the  TTCs  and  the  potential  for  expansion;  and\n(v) student performance in language and mathematics to assess the impact of teacher training\nprograms, subject to agreement between Sida and MOE.\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 4, page 5\n\ng.\n\nImproving  Teacher  Incentives  (Including  Salaries)  and  Working\nConditions\n\n22.\nTeacher Policy Working Group. A teacher policy working group (TPWG), consisting of\nappropriate MOE personnel including staff of the Gender and Ethnic Minorities Education Unit\nand to be led by the Department of Personnel, will be established and staffed to the satisfaction\nof ADB within three months of loan effectiveness. The TPWG will make policy recommendations\nfor  teacher  incentives  including  salaries,  teacher  career  development,  duty  statements,  and\nrecommendations  to  improve  the  supply  of  teachers.  The  work  of  the  group  will  include\n(i) recommendations  for  revisions  to  salary  scales  to  link  them  more  realistically  and\nsystematically  to  years  of  experience,  completion  of  training,  and  promotional  opportunities;\n(ii) the  development  of  duty  statements  for  school  principals,  cluster  heads,  teacher  trainers,\nacademic  teachers,  supervisors,  resource  center  managers,  and  teachers,  and  for  various\npositions  within  the  TTCs;  (iii)  seeking  agreement  for  revised  transfer  and  promotion  policies;\n(iv)  seeking  agreement  for  creating  an  equitable  system  of  teacher  deployment;  and\n(v) conducting studies to make policy recommendations on future teacher supply and demand\ntaking  into  account  retirements,  attrition  rates,  areas  of  high  demand  for  teachers,  population\ndata, and the current TTC quota system. The Government has agreed that an initial report and\nrecommendations  will  be  produced  within  one  year  of  the  start  of  the  Project.  This  will  be\ndiscussed  with  all  the  concerned  stakeholders  including  Sida  and  ADB,  and  a  final  report\nproduced within 18 months after the project start. The Government will then produce an action\nplan showing how it will implement the recommendations within two years after the start of the\nProject.\n\n2.\n\nConstruction and Upgrading of Training Facilities\n\n23.\nTTC  Facilities  Upgrading.  The  TTC  facilities  remain  incomplete  or  have  serious\ndefects,  which  affects  their  usability.  A  survey  report  of  the  TTCs  was  undertaken  under  the\nproject preparatory technical assistance.4 Funding will be provided to upgrade TTC facilities and\nequipment  in  line  with  the  recommendations  of  the  report.  This  includes  ensuring  adequate\nwater  supplies  and  sanitary  arrangements,  power  supplies,  rehabilitation  of  buildings  in  poor\ncondition,  and  some  construction  of  additional  dormitories  and  staff  housing.  It  also  includes\nfunds for instructional materials and books to stock the libraries.\n\n24.\nSecondary School PA Resource Centers and Network Teacher Upgrading Centers.\nEighteen  PA  resource  centers  have  been  built  around  the  country  to  serve  as  a  base  for  the\nprovincial secondary school PAs. The Project will provide packages of materials and equipment\nto 12 secondary school PA resource centers that have not yet received such packages and will\nsupport  the  use  of  the  centers  in  the  nine  project  provinces  to  strengthen  their  capacity  to\neffectively support lower and upper secondary school teacher and principals. NTUCs also exist\nin  each  of  18  provinces.  The  Project  will  provide  similar  packages  to  the  NTUCs  in  the  nine\nproject provinces to support the TUP program.\n\n25.\nResource  Centers  for  School  Clusters.  Depending  on  the  result  of  an  operational\nstudy  on  the  effectiveness  of  school  clusters  and  the  potential  for  expanding  the  number  of\nclusters in the country, the Project will support the construction of up to 115 resource centers for\nschool  clusters.  It  will  train  academic  teachers  in  each  cluster  to  support  the  activities  taking\nplace in the resource centers.\n\n                  \n\n4 Manodham,  Himmakone.  2001.  Teacher Training Colleges and Teacher Training Schools, Site Survey Report.\nVientiane (prepared under TA 3294-LAO: Second Education Quality Improvement Project, for $600,000, approved\non 10 November 1999).\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 4, page 6\n\n3.\n\nDelivery Provincial and District Teacher Training\n\na.\n\nProvince Level Training\n\n26.\nTeacher  Upgrading  Programs  for  Unqualified  Primary  School  Teachers.  The\nProject  will  support  the  training  of  over  2,400  teachers  under  the  TUP  for  unqualified  primary\nschool  teachers.  The  expanded  programs  should  focus  on  districts  where  schools  or\nclassrooms are being built under the Project to ensure that the unqualified teachers appointed\nto  these  newly  constructed  schools  and  classrooms  receive  upgrading  training  as  soon  as\npossible.  In  the  longer  term,  the  TUP  should  also  enable  more  coverage  of  remote  and  rural\nareas in other provinces. To increase the coverage in the future, the modules of the TUP will be\nelaborated and designed in a self-learning way to fit into a distance learning mode allowing the\nteachers to study on their own. The Project will support preparatory courses for underqualified\nupgrading  trainees,  which  will  be  made  available  to  a  maximum  of  240  (mainly  underqualified\nfemale teachers) of the 1,200 teachers to be newly recruited under the Project. It will focus on\nsubjects that teachers need most help, such as mathematics and Lao language.\n\n27.\nLower Secondary and Upper Secondary In-Service Training Programs. No system\nsuch  as  the  primary  school  cluster  system  yet  exists  at  the  secondary  education  level.  The\nProject  will  support  the  development  of  in-service  activities  for  lower  and  upper  secondary\nschools in cooperation with TTCs and the PA system, based initially at the provincial level, but\nwith  the  option  to  develop  models  based  on  the  NTUC  network.  The  Project  will  support  in-\nservice  training  of  12  days  per  year  during  holiday  time  for  teachers  of  core  subjects  at  the\nprovincial  level,  starting  form  the  third  year  of  the  Project.  Patterns  will  be  developed  in  each\nprovince  in  response  to  local  circumstances.  Training  content  will  focus  on  specific  subjects,\nand practical teaching approaches and materials. Initially, secondary PAs supplemented by TTC\nstaff  will  conduct  training.  Over  3,000  secondary  school  teachers  from  project  provinces  will\nparticipate in annual in-service training over four years.\n\n28.\nSecondary  School  Principal  Training.  Principals  of  approximately  500  lower  and\nupper secondary schools in project provinces will participate in 12 days of training annually. The\nfocus  of  training  will  be  on  school  development  and  quality  improvement  including  support  for\nteacher training. Training will take place at the PESs or TTCs. Training will be conducted by a\nteam comprising MOE, the Faculty of Education of NUOL, and TTCs as appropriate.\n\nb.\n\nDistrict Level Training\n\n29.\nSchool  and  Community  Training  at  Cluster  and  District  Levels.  The  Project  will\nsupport  the  training  of  over  15,000  primary  school  teachers,  and  appropriate  numbers  of\nprimary school principals (approximately 2,500) and community members (approximately 7,500)\nin 70 districts at either district or cluster level. The training will take place annually and consist of\ntwo parts.\n\n30.\nTraining for Developing School and Community Plans. School principals, teachers,\nand  community  members5  from  all  schools  in  the  project  districts  will  take  part  in  three  days\nannual training to develop school and community plans to increase the quality of teaching and\nlearning  and  increase  participation  in  education  in  their  schools,  especially  among  girls  and\nethnic minorities. This will include making plans for the use of school funds allocated to schools\nunder  the  Project  to  support  school  operation  and  maintenance,  and  promote  learning  and\nparticipation. It will also include planning for the use of matching grants allocated to schools by\ndistricts to carry out new school construction and rehabilitation.\n\n                  \n\n5 Three  community  members  will  attend  the  training:  the  village  head  or  representative,  a  woman\u2019s  representative\n\nwho may be from the Lao Women\u2019s Union, and a parent selected by the community.\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 4, page 7\n\ninteractive  methodologies,  multigrade \n\n31.\nTraining  for  Improving  the  Quality  of  Teaching  and  Learning.  All  teachers  and\nschool principals in project districts will take part in 12 days annual in-service training (including\nthe three days community training [para. 30]) focused on improving the quality of teaching and\nlearning in their schools. The teachers and principals will share practical ways of teaching and\nlearning, \nliteracy.  Action  or\nparticipatory  research  on  solving  problems  in  schools  will  be  adopted  to  address  problems\nrelating to pupil retention, large classes, low literacy, and numeracy attainment. The training will\nsupport  the  development  of  school  libraries,  using  the  packages  of  books  delivered  by  the\nProject. Where school clusters exist or can be developed, this training should take place using\nthe  existing  cluster  patterns  of  activities.  Where  cluster  activities  cannot  practically  be\nimplemented  alternative  arrangements  for  the  training  should  be  made.  These  arrangements\nshould be locally appropriate and may include training at the district level to take place during\nschool holidays. The training will be given by PAs and academic teachers, and in the future, a\nnationwide  in-service  teacher  training  network  to  be  based  on  the  NTUC  system  will  be\nintroduced in cooperation with TTCs, the PA system, and school clusters.\n\nteaching,  and  basic \n\nB.\n\nComponent 2: Increasing Access to and Participation in Education\n\n1.\n\nExpanding Access\n\nModels  for  School  Construction.  The  review  of  many  models  of  primary  school\n32.\nbuildings  in  the  country  showed  that  the  availability  of  local  materials  and  labor,  contributions\nfrom the communities, and the accessibility to the road determine the model of school buildings.\nBased on the review, the Project proposes two options of flexible models for school construction\nand rehabilitization: (i) the medium standard of permanent building with a life span of more than\n25  years  in  the  villages  having  an  access  road;  and  (ii)  semipermanent  building  with  three\ndifferent standards but having a life span of more than 25 years for the main structure. These\ntwo options are expected to be adapted by the Government, which will apply to this Project and\nthe  World  Bank\u2019s  Second  Education  Development  Program  under  preparation  as  a  \u201cminimum\ncommon  standard\u201d  approach  in  the  school  construction  program.  Within  six  months  of  loan\neffectiveness, MOE will submit the prototype designs of project schools to ADB for review and\napproval, in line with the proposed \u201cminimum common standard\u201d approach.\n\n33.\nSchool Mapping and Data Collection. The project activities will be based on bottom-up\nplanning  and  a  demand-driven  approach.  Districts  involved  in  the  Project  will  be  required  to\nundertake  school  mapping  and  data  collection  in  the  first  year  of  each  project  phase,  prior  to\nany school construction and teacher training taking place. The mapping and data collection will\nprovide  accurate  data  on  school  buildings,  teachers,  students,  village  populations,  and  the\nnature  of  community  support  to  assess  demand  for  education.  The  data  will  form  the  basis  of\nplanning for school construction and quality improvement activities.6\n\n34.\nDistrict  Construction  Plans.  Districts  will  be  allocated  a  budget  to  carry  out  a  school\nconstruction program. This construction fund will initially be set at an average of $150,000 per\ndistrict to support the program expected to last up to three years. The size of the fund will not be\nuniform  for  each  district,  but  will  be  weighted  according  to  the  following  factors:  (i)  the  total\nschool  age  population,  (ii)  the  net  enrollment  rate  in  primary  education,  (iii)  the  number  of\nincomplete  schools,  and  (iv)  the  number  of  villages  without  primary  schools.  This  will\nautomatically ensure the weighting of funding to the poor and ethnic minorities. The size of the\nfund  for  each  district  will  be  determined  by  MOE  with  assistance  from  the  consultants  and  in\ncooperation with the PESs during the first year of project implementation, and submitted to ADB\nfor review and approval.\n\n                  \n\n6 The  data  to  be  collected  and  its  format  will  be  coordinated  with  data  collection  developed  by  other  projects\nincluding  the  ADB-funded  BEGP,  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Second  Education  Development  Program  under\npreparation.\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 4, page 8\n\nBased on the data collected by the DEB, assisted by the provincial unit for construction\n35.\nand  development  assistance  (PUCDA)  and  advisory  support  provided  by  the  Education\nConstruction Service at MOE, the DEB will draw up a list of prioritized construction needs, and\ncosted  programs  for  primary  school  construction  in  the  district  within  the  budget  allocated.\nAccordingly,  the  district  construction  plans  include  the  following  activities  (i)  completing\nincomplete primary schools (At least 50 percent of the construction funds should be allocated to\ncompleting  schools);7  (ii)  building  new  primary  schools;  (iii)  building  additional  classrooms  for\nexisting complete primary schools; and (iv) rehabilitating schools.\n\n36.\nOver 1,000 new classrooms are expected to be built in the 41 project districts during the\nproject  period.  This  will  result  in  approximately  320  newly  completed  schools  and  120  new\nmainly multigrade schools. In addition, approximately 1,400 classrooms will be rehabilitated with\nthe help of the construction funds, mainly by local communities.\n\n37.\nConstruction activities will be carried out either by contractors or by local communities as\nfollows  (All  construction  activities  will  include  the  provision  of  furniture,  water  supply,  and\ntoilets):\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nBuilding  Permanent  and  Semipermanent  Structures  using  Contractors.  At\nleast  60  percent  of  the  construction  funds  (whether  for  rehabilitation,  or\nconstruction  of  new  schools  or  classrooms)  will  be  allocated  to  building\npermanent  or  semipermanent  structures  to  the  minimum  common  standard,\nwhich includes concrete floors, concrete or hardwood columns, plastered brick or\nwooden  walls,  and  fiber  cement  or  galvanized  iron  sheets.  The  buildings,  if\nproperly maintained, should have a life span of more than 25 years.\n\nMatching Funds to Communities. The Project will encourage the use of at least\n20  percent  and  not  more  than  40  percent  of  the  construction  funds  being\nallocated  as  matching  funds  to  local  communities,  that  wish  to  rehabilitate,\ncomplete,  or  extend  their  schools.  The  funds  may  also  be  used  to  construct\nsimple  daycare  facilities  to  shelter  younger  siblings  to  enable  girls  to  attend\nschool.  As  a  general  rule,  materials  such  as  roofing  sheets  and  wood  will  be\ngiven to local communities to support their building activities. Funds can also be\nspent in poor villages to pay for labor costs or provide food for laborers.\n\nQuality Assurance. A qualified construction engineer will be appointed to each district\n38.\nto supervise all aspects of construction, assist the village with management of the construction\nprocess,  and  report  regularly  to  the  DEB  and  PUCDA  on  progress  and  any  problems\nencountered.  Provincial  project  engineers  will  be  posted  in  each  of  the  four  project  provinces\nwhere  school  construction  is  to  take  place.  They  will  be  attached  to  the  PUCDAs,  and  will\ncoordinate and supervise the work of the district construction engineers. MOE will ensure that\nenvironmental  considerations,  including  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines,  are  followed  for  all\nproject school construction and rehabilitation.\n\n39.\nTeachers  for  New  Schools  and  Classrooms.  Where  possible  the  PES  will  provide\nteachers  for  additional  schools  and  classrooms  built  under  the  Project  from  the  resources\navailable. However, in many of the remote areas in which the Project will be operating, villages\nwill need to recruit unqualified school graduates as teachers. The Government has guaranteed\nto pay the salaries of these teachers, and they will be offered training under the TUP program.\nAfter  completing  the  training,  the  teachers  will  become  permanent  Government  teachers.\nTeachers  recruited  should  be  of  the  highest  level  of  education  available  in  the  village.\n\n                  \n\n7 A complete school is one that caters for all primary school grades (1-5). Where there are small numbers of children\n\ntwo- or three-classroom multigrade schools will be constructed.\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 4, page 9\n\nAccordingly,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  at  least  one  trained  teacher,  or  in  some\nexceptional cases, untrained teacher, is appointed to each classroom to be constructed under\nthe Project at least three months prior to the physical completion of each school/classroom, and\nwill submit the name and qualification of each appointed to teacher to ADB within one month of\nappointment for ADB\u2019s review.\n\n2.\n\nEncouraging Participation in Education\n\n40.\nProvision  of  School  Funds.  The  Project  will  establish  the  principle  of  Government\nprovision  of  school  funds  to  encourage  school-based  management  of  resources.  After  the\nProject, such funds will become the norm for all schools. The school funds will supplement, and\nnot  replace,  the  community  funding  already  provided  in  schools.  The  Project  will  provide  an\nannual  budget  averaging  approximately  KN1,040,000  (currently  $130)  to  schools  in  districts\ntaking  part  in  the  Project  as  the  Government  counterpart  fund.  The  actual  amount  for  each\nschool  will  be  determined  by  existing  Government  regulations  that  allocate  school  budgets\naccording  to  the  size  of  schools.  The  school  funds,  which  must  not  be  used  to  supplement\nteachers\u2019  pay,  will  be  used  for  (i)  support  for  school  operation  and  maintenance  including\npurchase  of  books,  teaching  materials,  and  equipment,  and  minor  maintenance  of  school\nbuildings,  furniture,  equipment,  and  blackboards;  and  (ii)  special  programs  to  encourage\nlearning and participation in education (focusing on small-scale programs by schools and local\ncommunities  to  increase  enrollment  and  improve  student  performance.  Approximately  50\npercent of the school funds will be used for programs that include such activities as organizing\nextra  classes  to  support  basic  literacy,  running  classes  for  parents  and  the  community,\nemploying  community  assistants  to  support  teachers.  Proposals  for  such  programs  must\nindicate measurable improvements in learning, repetition rates or school attendance, by which\nthe success of the initiative can be monitored. The Project will support an operational study on\nthe  effectiveness  of  special  school  and  community  level  programs  in  reducing  dropout  and\nrepetition, and improving learning in schools.\n\n41.\nRelease  of  the  school  funds  to  schools  will  be  dependent  on  schools  making  a  school\nplan that will show how the funds will be used. The school plan will be drawn up as part of the\nannual school and community training, and will have to be approved by the DEB. The training\nwill  enable  communities  to  monitor  the  use  of  these  funds.  Schools  will  have  to  report  on  the\nuse of the previous year\u2019s funds before the release of the next year\u2019s funds is approved. This\nfunding  scheme  will  be  reviewed  in  the  midterm  review  and  the  number  of  funds  may  be\nincreased if the scheme is judged successful.\n\n42.\nProvision  of  a  Package  of  Library  Books,  Maps,  and  Posters  to  Schools.  A  small\ncollection of library books and a collection of instructional posters on Lao language for primary\nschools have been produced by NRIES with assistance from UNICEF. A small selection of other\nbooks for primary schools is also available from other funding sources. The Project will provide\neach  school  in  the  project  districts  with  a  package  of  books,  maps,  and  posters  worth\nKN1,000,000  (currently  $125)  to  enable  them  to  start  a  small  library.  Training  in  the\nmanagement and use of these resources will be included in teacher training programs.\n\n43.\nLao Women\u2019s Union Training of Trainers. The Project will support and strengthen the\ndistrict  and  village  level  of  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  (LWU)  and  education  initiatives.  The  social\ndevelopment specialist and social development coordinators will work with LWU at national and\nprovincial level to develop a program to support education initiatives in the project districts. An\norientation program will be provided for provincial LWU staff in the north and south. The social\ncoordinators will work with LWU national trainers to train LWU district coordinators as trainers at\nthe village level. The district LWU trainers will receive a four-day training program consisting of\ntwo sessions of two days at an interval of 18 months. Topics to be covered include encouraging\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 4, page 10\n\ngirls  to  stay  in  school,  supporting  mothers  in  learning  about  the  value  of  education,  and\npromoting nutrition for school children.\n\nC.\n\nComponent 3: Strengthening Management Capacity and Project Implementation\n\nThe  Project  will  support  the  long-term  capacity  building  of  management  structures  at\n44.\neach level of the education services under the decentralized education system. The Project will\nbuild up planning and management capacity at MOE to support the teacher training system and\nteacher  development,  and  develop  management  capacity  at  PES,  DEB,  and  village  levels  to\nsupport planning and implementation of school construction, school support and teacher training\nprograms.\n\n1.\n\nStrengthening Capacity of MOE\n\n45.\nConsultants will provide technical assistance in planning and policy development to DTT,\nDGE, other MOE departments, and NRIES staff engaged in teacher training to develop strategic\nplans.  Support  will  also  be  provided  to  the  TPWG  led  by  the  Department  of  Personnel.\nConsulting services will be provided to DTT and DGE, Department of Planning and International\nCooperation  and  Department  of  Finance  in  managing  the  teacher  training  and  development,\nconstruction,  and  other  project  programs.  The  consultants  will  provide  advice  and  training  in\ntechnical  matters  related  to  the  Project  and  will  provide  assistance  and  training  in  planning,\nbudgeting  and  accounting,  implementation,  monitoring  and  supervising,  and  reporting.  Two\nqualified  project  assistants  will  be  provided  to  strengthen  the  project  implementation  unit  in\nproject  planning,  budgeting  and  accounting,  monitoring  and  supervising,  and  reporting.\nWorkshops  to  support  project  management  and  implementation  will  be  supported  by  the\nProject. Operational budgets and equipment will be provided to support their daily tasks, and to\nmonitor and supervise activities in the field.\n\n2.\n\nStrengthening Capacity of the PES and DEB\n\n46.\nThe Project will provide consulting services to review the structure of the PES and make\nrecommendations for changes in structure to support its expanded role under the Project, which\nwill  in  turn  prepare  it  for  decentralization.  Institutional  development  and  management\nconsultants and MOE staff will provide training in school mapping and data collection for school\nconstruction,  and  planning,  budgeting  and  accounting, \nimplementing,  monitoring  and\nsupervising, and reporting teacher training programs. One qualified assistant will be provided to\neach of six PESs. One additional qualified assistant will be appointed to each of four PUCDAs in\nproject provinces to help plan and supervise construction. A national project engineer stationed\nat  MOE  will  give  advice  and  training  to  each  PUCDA  in  managing  and  monitoring  the\nconstruction  program.  The  Project  will  support  PUCDA  staff  for  their  site  visits  to  plan  and\nsupervise construction. Operational budgets and equipment will be provided to each PES and\nPUCDA. This will include computers and printers for PES and PUCDA.\n\n47.\nNew  DEB  offices  will  be  built  in  up  to  55  out  of  the  61  project  districts  that  do  not\ncurrently  have  permanent  offices.  These  will  be  permanent  structures  (medium  standard)  with\nthe life span of more than 25 years and a floor area of approximately 220 square meters, similar\nto  the  design  used  in  the  ADB-funded  BEGP.  Furniture  and  equipment  will  be  provided.  The\nDEB  staff  will  be  given  intensive  training  in  school  mapping  and  data  collection,  planning  and\nbudgeting  teacher  training  programs  and  school  funds,  and  substantial  assistance  in\nimplementing  the  these  activities.  The  qualified  assistants  assigned  to  PESs  will  spend  a\nconsiderable part of their time working at the DEB level to assist with these activities Computers\nand printers will be provided on an experimental basis to DEBs that have a power supply. The\nability of the DEBs to make use of these computers will be reviewed periodically.\n\n\fPROJECT COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\nTable A5.1: Financing Plan with Percentage Breakdown\n\n($'000)\n\nForeign\n\nTotal Cost\nLocal\n\nExchange Currency\n\nADB Financed\n\nTotal \n\nCost\n\nForeign\n\nLocal\n\nExchange Currency\n\nTotal \n\nCost\n\nSida Financed\nLocal\n\nForeign\n\nGovernment Financed\nLocal\n\nTotal \n\nForeign\n\nExchange Currency\n\nExchange Currency\n\nCost\n\nTotal \n\nCost\n\nActivity\n\nA.

The education status of lowland ethnic groups has been higher than that of other\nethnic groups, and boys have received significantly more education than girls. The problems of\nequal access to the education system by girls and ethnic minorities are closely related; among\nethnic  minorities,  the  gender  gap  is  significantly  greater  than  for  the  lowland  Lao-speaking\npopulation. Any strategy seeking to address the low enrollment of girls will also have to focus on\nethnic  minority  issues  and  any  strategy  focusing  on  the  low  enrollment  of  ethnic  minority\nchildren  will  also  have  to  focus  on  gender  concerns.  The  Project  is  committed  to  support  an\nincrease  in  access  to  education  for  both  of  these  groups.  The  Project\u2019s  Gender  and  Ethnic\nMinority  Strategy  (GEMS)  has  been  prepared  in  consultation  with  the  gender  and  ethnic\nminorities  education  unit  (GEMEU)  in  the  Department  of  General  Education  (DGE),  the  Lao\nFront for National Construction, and the Lao Women\u2019s Union (LWU).\n\nB.\n\nProject Gender and Ethnic Minority Strategy\n\n2.\nBuilding upon the ongoing initiatives carried out in the Asian Development Bank-funded\nBasic Education (Girls) Project (BGEP),1 the Project\u2019s GEMS has the following basic principles:\n(i)  where  possible,  prioritize  resource  allocation  to  geographically  targeted  remote  ethnic\nminority  areas  where  gender  disparities  tend  to  be  larger;  (ii)  promote  participation  of  ethnic\nminorities  and  women  in  project  activities  throughout  the  project  cycle;  (iii)  promote  gender-\nsensitive  and  ethnic  minority  curriculum,  materials,  and  policy  and  strategy  development;\n(iv) address  special  needs  and  constraints  of  ethnic  minorities  and  female  students,  teachers,\ngovernment  officials,  and  project  staff;  and  (v)  strengthen  capacity  of  relevant  institutions  that\naddress ethnic and gender concerns and equality.\n\nSpecific  activities  and  approaches  for  each  project  components  are  explained  in  Table\n\n3.\nA9:\n\nTable A9: Components and Targets for the Gender and Ethnic Minority Strategy\n\nComponent/Activity\nComponent 1 (Quality)\nTeacher education strategy\ndevelopment\n\nTraining materials and\ncurricula development\n\nApproach and Target\n\nTechnical  assistance  provided  by  the  Project  will  ensure  that  the\npriorities and operational plans address  gender  and  ethnic  equity and\nspecial needs, such as quota for female teacher training.\n\nAdequate  representation  and  participation  of  women  and  ethnic\nminorities will be ensured in the curriculum and materials development\nteam formed under the Project, and as respondents and discussants of\nteacher training needs.\n\nIn  reviewing  and  revising  various  current  curricula,  assessment  and\nrecommendations  will  be  made  to  address  the  needs  of  female  and\nethnic  minority  teachers  (including  future  teachers).  Gender  and\nethnicity-sensitive  teacher  training  curriculum  and  materials  will  be\ndeveloped.\n\n1 Loan 1621-LAO: Basic Education (Girls) Project, for $20.0 million, approved on 25 June 1998.\n\n                  \n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\nComponent/Activity\n\nApproach and Target\nCurriculum  development  for  distance  education  for  in-service  training\nwill  especially  benefit  teachers  in  remote  ethnic  minority  areas  and\nfemale teachers whose mobility is limited.\n\nTraining of trainers\n\nWhere  additional  pedagogical  advisers  are  required  (initially  as\nreplacements  for  existing  pedagogical  adviser),  female  and  ethnic\nminority candidates will be given priority.\n\nImprovement of teacher\nsalaries, incentives, and\nworking conditions\n\nSeparate focus group discussions by gender and ethnic groups will be\nheld  so  that  their  special  concerns  and  constraints  will  be  addressed,\nsuch  as  women\u2019s  need  for  child  care  facilities  and  difficulty  of  ethnic\nminority teachers in being assigned away from home.\n\nEfforts will be made to increase awareness of female teachers\u2019 rights,\nand benefits issues will be raised, including maternity leave benefits.\n\nAffirmative  actions  in  the  promotion  policy  for  women  and  ethnic\nminorities  will  be  considered  by  the  teacher  policy  working  group,\nwhich will review the current conditions and policies.\n\nConstruction and upgrading\nof teacher training facilities\n\nConstruction  will  be  done  in  consultation  with  potential  users  of\nfacilities to ensure that concerns are taken into account. Separate toilet\nfacilities  for  female  teachers  will  be  included  and  other  concerns  can\nbe taken into account (provision for day care, location of facilities, etc.).\n\nDelivery of in-service teacher\ntraining at a local level\n\nIn-service training will be made available to teachers in the 70 districts\nin nine provinces, most with a large ethnic minority population. Training\nof unqualified teachers locally will especially benefit ethnic minority and\nfemale  teachers,  as  many  are  unqualified  and  they  have  mobility\nconstraints.\n\nComponent 2 (Access and Participation)\nConstruction of primary\nschools, rehabilitation, and\ncompletion of incomplete\nschools\n\nThe  component  will  cover  four  provinces,  three  of  which  have  large\nethnic  minority  populations  and  large  gender  disparities  in  primary\nenrolment.\n\nTo  accommodate  the  needs  of  shifting  communities  while  achieving\noverall  sustainability  of  building,  the  percentage  of  permanent  versus\nsemipermanent  buildings  in  each  district  will  be  decided  according  to\nthe local situation.\n\nWithin  a  province,  the  Project\u2019s  budget  allocation  among  districts  will\nbe  based  upon  the  selection  criteria  prioritizing  underserved  districts,\nwhich  will  benefit  remote  ethnic  minority  areas  with  lowest  female\nattendance.  Within  a  district,  budget  allocation  will  also  be  based  on\ndistrict mapping, which will target the underserved areas in a district.\n\nUpgrading  of  incomplete  schools  to  complete  schools  with  additional\nteachers  will  also  solve  the  isolation  problems  typically  felt  by  female\nteachers at incomplete schools.\n\nRecruitment of new school\nteachers for the new\nclassrooms\n\nAbout 1,200 new teachers will be recruited locally, of which at least 50\npercent  will  be  women.  Local  recruitment  will  make  the  life  of  female\nand ethnic minority teachers easier, as they will not have to relocate.\n\n\fComponent/Activity\nProvision of community\nmatching grants\n\nProvision of funds to schools\n\nCommunity and school staff\ntraining for annual planning\nand monitoring of the use of\ngrants\n\n71\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\nApproach and Target\nLocal communities will be provided with grants matched by community\ncontribution in kind and/or labor. Based on the demand, the community\nmay  rehabilitate,  complete,  or  extend  their  schools.  The  funds  may\nalso be used to construct simple day-care facilities attached to primary\nschools to encourage ethnic minority girls to attend school.\n\nfor  children  and \n\nThe funds may be used for purchasing books, teaching materials, and\nblackboards,  and  supporting  special  programs.  Such  programs  may\nilliterate  adults\ninclude  extra  reading  classes \n(especially  women);  recruitment  of  pre-school  assistants  (most  likely\nwomen) who will take care of preschool children at day-care centers ;\nrecruitment of paid community teaching assistants (most likely women)\nwho  will  assist  especially  grade  1  teachers  who  have  to  take  care  of\novercrowded classrooms. Many of these will specifically benefit women\nand girls, especially those of ethnic minority groups, and allow them to\nconcentrate better on education.\n\nA  committee  for  community  education  development  (CCED)  or\nequivalent,  comprising  the  school  principal,  teacher  representatives,\nvillage head and representatives, LWU or women representatives, and\nparents  will  be  trained  annually  to  prepare  a  school  plan  that  will\nfunds  will  be  used.  LWU  and  women\ndetermine  how  school \nrepresentatives  will  be  trained  by  district  LWU  staff  to  ensure  that\nschool  funds  will  prioritize  activities  specifically  benefiting  women  and\ngirls. CCED will also be trained on participatory monitoring of the use\nof  funds.  This  approach  will  better  ensure  that  local  specific  gender\nneeds are addressed and that differences among ethnic minorities are\ntaken into account in education activities.\n\nTraining of trainers for the\ndistrict LWU staff who will\ntrain communities\n\nAwareness  raising  on  the  importance  of  girls  education  and  school\nnutrition will be carried out in the community. This will especially benefit\nethnic  minority  girls.

GEMEU at MOE\u2019s DGE will have overall responsibility for monitoring and\nsupervising the implementation of the project GEMS and provide technical advice. GEMEU will\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 9, page 4\n\nbe a member of the MOE steering Committee. The Lao Front for National Construction and the\nEthnic  Minority  Education  Division  in  DGE  will  also  be  consulted  as  necessary.  Specific\nimplementation  responsibilities  will  lie  with  the  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  at  the  central\nlevel,  provincial  PIUs  (PPIUs),  and  district  PIUs  (DPIUs).  LWU  will  be  also  consulted  and  will\nparticipate  as  a  local  facilitating  group.  Nongovernment  organizations  will  be  consulted  for\ndeveloping  more  innovative  approaches  to  reach  ethnic  minority  students  in  remote  areas\nduring the implementation.\n\nInstitutional  Capacity.  In  MOE,  only  DGE  and  Department  of  Nonformal  Education\n5.\nhave  significant,  direct  experience  in  dealing  with  ethnic  minority  education.  GEMEU  in  DGE\ngained  significant  experience  through  the  ongoing  BEGP.  Therefore,  GEMEU  will  provide\nawareness raising on both gender and ethnic minority issues to the central PIU, curriculum and\nmaterials  development  team,  teacher  policy  working  group,  and  other  relevant  project  staff  at\nthe central level. Provinces and districts also have experience in promoting ethnic and gender\nequity and addressing special needs and aspirations of female and ethnic minority students and\nteachers. The social development specialist and social development coordinators will build upon\nongoing training and awareness raising for provinces and districts carried out under the BEGP,\nassisted by GEMEU. One or more staff members from GEMEU will be invited to participate in\nthe long-term capacity building proposed in this Project, including postgraduate training.\n\nBudget and Financing Plan. The GEMS does not require a separate budget because it\n6.\nis  fully  integrated  into  the  overall  project  budget.  The  benefits  of  component  1  will  spread\nnationwide  at  different  levels;  estimating  how  much  will  accrue  to  ethnic  minorities  is  difficult.\nApproximately  60  percent  of  the  component  2  civil  works  in  the  four  provinces  (approximately\n$3.7  million)  will  directly  result  in  increasing  access  in  remote  and  ethnic  minority  areas.  The\nProject  will  also  have  various  specialist  assistance  through  component  3;  among  others,\ninstitutional  development  and  management  adviser  and  team  leader  (42  person-months,\ninternational),  curriculum  and  teacher  training  consultants  (24  person-months  each  for  two\npersons, international), social development specialist (39 person-months, domestic), and social\ndevelopment coordinators (51 person-months each for two persons, domestic) will especially be\ninvolved  to  help  the  implement  the  GEMS.  GEMEU  will  be  provided  with  incremental  budget\nand one incremental staff under component 3.\n\n7.\nImplementation  Schedule.  The  schedule  of  GEMS  implementation  will  be  in  line  with\noverall  project  implementation.  A  four-phased  approach  will  be  taken  for  the  delivery  of  the\nteacher training subcomponent in component 1 and a three-phased approach for component 2.\nEach phase will last for three years.\n\n8.\nMonitoring  and  Evaluation.  GEMEU  will  be  responsible  for  overall  monitoring  and\nevaluation  of  GEMS  implementation,  combined  by  participatory  benefit  monitoring  and\nevaluation  by  ethnic  minority  beneficiaries  themselves  in  the  communities.  For  the  building\nteacher training system and teacher development capacity subcomponent under component 1,\nthe PIU will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of GEMS in such areas as teacher\neducation strategy development, curriculum and materials development, and teacher incentives\nimprovement.  The  PIU  will  be  also  responsible  for  monitoring  provincial  implementation  of  the\nGEMS, while PPIUs will be responsible for monitoring district level implementation. DPIUs will\nmonitor community and school-based implementation of GEMS. A GEMEU staff will participate\nin the midterm review.\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 10, page 1\n\nA. \n\nEconomic Rationale\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS\n\nAt  the  moment,  only  40  percent  of  Lao  citizens  who  are  entering  the  workforce  for  the\n1.\nfirst time have completed primary education: one third of those have never entered school and\nthe others dropped out before successful completion. In these circumstances, efficient programs\nthat significantly increase the number of children who enter and successfully complete primary\nschool  are  one  of  the  most  cost-effective  investments  for  socioeconomic  development.  The\nProject  has  been  formulated  within  the  overall  objective  to  provide  universal  quality  primary\neducation. It also proposes limited interventions to improve the quality of secondary education,\nwhich should feed back into improvements in primary education by providing better recruits for\nteaching.  The  Project  will  also  serve  an  equity  objective  by  contributing  to  the  extension  of\naccess to primary education in selected underserved areas, in line with the overarching goal of\nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) to reducing poverty.\n\nB.\n\nLabor Market and Social Needs\n\n2.\nAssuming  that  government  employment  follows  population  growth  (at  2.4  percent  per\nannum),  an  additional  2,600  government  jobs  will  be  created  each  year.  For  nongovernment\njobs,  if  economic  growth  follows  the  precrisis  trend  (e.g.,  5.2  percent  per  annum  for  industrial\nsector  growth  and  12.2  percent  per  annum  for  service  sector  growth),  as  many  as  7,000  new\njobs would be created each year in the private sector or state enterprise firms. Those who do\nnot find work in the formal sector will be absorbed into the family subsistence economy: some\ncombination  of  agriculture,  household  businesses,  and  the  informal  sector.  The  size  of  these\nlabor  market  entrants  will  be  at  least  110,400.1  Women  are  underrepresented  in  the  formal\nsector  and  overrepresented  in  the  informal  sector.  This  labor  pattern  continues  to  have  an\nimpact on girls who drop out at higher rates to support family farming and household activities.\nCurrent student flows out of the education system do not meet the needs of the nongovernment\nlabor market and those who work there. A particular problem is that most of those who will be\nabsorbed into the family subsistence economy\u2014about 70,000 persons each year\u2014will not have\ncompleted primary education. They will be largely illiterate and with little or no numeracy, greatly\nlimiting  their  opportunities  to  make  a  decent  living.  These  individuals  will  not  fully  share  in  or\ncontribute to the development that is going to occur.\n\n3.\nA lack of education also seriously limits the advancement of women and seriously limits\nfamily  planning,  child  care,  and  basic  health  care  in  the  family.  High  illiteracy  rates  among\nwomen  are  a  significant  influence  on  the  country\u2019s  poor  record  in  social  indicators,  especially\nthe high rates of maternal mortality for children under five. The first steps to meet the needs for\nthis vast majority of people is literacy and numeracy\u2014that is, completing primary education.\n\nC.\n\nBeneficiaries\n\n4.\nActivities  under  component  2  will  operate  in  remote  and  poor  areas  in  the  selected  41\ndistricts. The emphasis will be on upgrading the incomplete schools to complete schools with all\nprimary school grades (1-5), as a high dropout occurs in early grades. The Project will greatly\nincrease  the  opportunity  for  children  in  these  districts  to  receive  a  full  five-year  primary\neducation  by  building  approximately  45  classrooms  in  each  district  and  by  completing\nincomplete schools. This will amount to a new supply of about 1,000 classrooms in total. Using\nthe average primary level pupil-teacher ratio of 30:1, this means that about 30,000 students per\n\n1  ADB. 2000.

Manila.\n\n                  \n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nyear  are  expected  to  complete  primary  education  in  the  project-assisted  newly  constructed  or\nnewly  completed  primary  schools.  The  Project  will  also  ensure  that  more  of  them  finish\nreasonable  quality  primary  education  than  now  by  assigning  new  teachers  who  will  be  also\ntrained  through  the  Project.  Based  on  the  total  number  of  primary  school  students  in  the\nprovinces  that  will  receive  either  full  access  and  quality  programs  (Bokeo,  Louang  Namtha,\nSavanakhet,  and  Sayaburi)  or  full  quality  program  (Champassak  and  Vientiane)  under  the\nProject, more than 400,000 primary level students are expected benefit from the higher quality\nof instructions by the end of the Project.\n\n5.\nUnder  component  1,  many  teachers  will  benefit  from  new  and  improved  training\nprograms.  This  will  include  over  2,000  graduates  annually  from  the  teacher  training  colleges\n(TTCs); 2,400 unqualified teachers who will be trained and better qualified; and approximately\n15,000  primary  school  teachers,  2,500  primary  school  principals,  3,000  secondary  school\nteachers, and 500 secondary school principals who will have taken part in regular and repeated\nin-service  training.  This  amounts  to  55  percent  of  primary  school  teachers  and  30  percent  of\nsecondary school teachers in the country. To provide intensive training inputs, 365 TTC trainers,\n108 teacher upgrading program (TUP) trainers, 473 primary school pedogogical advisers (PAs)\nand 144 secondary school PAs will be trained on a regular and repeated basis.\n\nD.\n\nCost-Effectiveness and Internal Efficiency\n\n6.\nA  key  element  for  cost-effectiveness  of  education  spending  is  per  student  cost.  Table\nA10 shows the annual recurrent cost per student by education level and expenditure category.\nFrom  this  table,  two  facts  are  obvious.  First,  primary  education  is  by  far  the  least  expensive\nspending  per  student.  Second,  the  share  of  teacher  salaries  makes  up  the  largest  share  at\nprimary  education  level.  This  indicates  that  improvement  in  teacher  quality  at  primary  level\nwould  be  the  single  most  important  and  most  cost-effective  educational  spending,  which  will\nbetter  prepare  students  for  higher  level  education.  Therefore,  it  makes  good  economic  sense\nthat  various  activities  planned  under  the  Project  aim  to  improve  quality  and  access  mainly  of\nprimary education.\n\nTable A10: Unit Recurrent Cost by Expenditure Type and By Schooling Level (1996-97)\n(KN per student per year)\n\nExpenditure Type\n\nGeneral Administration\n    % share in total exp\nOperation and Maintenance\n    % share in total exp\nScholarships\n    % share in total exp\nNonteaching Staff\n    % share in total exp\nStudent/Nonteacher Ratio\nTeachers\n    % share in total exp\nStudent/Teacher Ratio\nAverage Class Size\nTotal\n\nPre-\nSchool\n4,295\n\nPrimary\n\n1,351\n\nLower\nSecondary\n4,424\n\nUpper\nSecondary\n5,298\n\nTechical/\nVocational\n8,127\n\nTeacher\nTraining\n7,651\n\nHigher\nEducation\n5,928\n\n2,785\n\n1,532\n\n2,883\n\n3,455\n\n35,398\n\n30,273\n\n23,042\n\n9.0\n\n5.8\n\n5.7\n\n6.5\n\n9.6\n\n6.2\n\n9.6\n\n6.2\n\n7,967\n\n16.7\n83\n32,752\n\n68.5\n18\n28\n47,799\n\n916\n\n3.9\n\n262\n19,725\n\n83.9\n30\n28\n23,524\n\n1,196\n\n1,801\n\n2.6\n\n90\n37,627\n\n81.6\n15\n35\n46,130\n\n3.3\n\n104\n44,728\n\n80.9\n16\n40\n55,282\n\n81,542\n\n62,541\n\n41,994\n\n3.2\n\n14.0\n\n32.3\n\n33,818\n\n13.4\n13\n93,552\n\n37.1\n7\n22\n252,437\n\n3.2\n\n12.8\n\n26.4\n\n3.3\n\n12.6\n\n23.0\n\n38,922\n\n16.4\n12\n97,804\n\n41.2\n6\n\n40,908\n\n22.4\n17\n70,379\n\n38.6\n6\n\n237,191\n\n182,251\n\nSource: Bouapao, L., O. Sengchandavong, and S. Sihavong. 2000. Educational Financing and Budgeting in Lao  PDR,\n\nInternational Institute for Educational Planning: Paris. pp. 133-34, tables F and G.\n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\nA rough estimate of annualized capital (building and facilities with assumed 30-year life)\n7. \ncost  per  student  in  primary  education  was  about  $20  in  1996/97.  This  is  about  KN20,000  at\n(KN1,000 per dollar in that year).  This is about equal or slightly less than the recurrent cost per\nstudent in primary education. In comparable countries, the ratio of capital to recurrent cost is 25-\n30:70-75 percent (footnote 1, 186). This means that the relative cost of using these schools is\nabout  four  times  larger  than  what  is  observed  in  comparable  countries.  While  the  country\u2019s\nunfavorable  topography  partly  explains  this  comparison,  the  message  is  that  building  new\nprimary schools will not be cost-effective as a reasonable level of recurrent spending cannot be\nmatched against them. This fact has led to the Project\u2019s priority of teacher quality improvement\n(Component  1)  and  completing  schools  with  less  than  five  grades  (component  2),  while\ncomponent 3 is aimed at strengthening institutional capacity to improve efficiency of education\nsystem under the country\u2019s new decentralization mandate.\n\nE.\n\nExternal Efficiency\n\n8.\nSome  of  the  primary  school  graduates  in  project  districts  will  go  on  to  higher  levels  of\neducation  but  most  will  leave  school  after  completing  primary  school  and  eventually  be\nabsorbed  into  the  family  subsistence  economy.  The  record  in  other  countries  shows  that\ncompared with those who have little or no education, farmers with a primary education are more\nproductive. Once educated, their career aspirations may improve, and the receptiveness to new\nideas,  information,  and  technology  will  increase.  Completion  of  basic  education  will  not  only\nmean  that  such  individuals  will  share  in  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth,  but  also  contribute  to\nthat  growth  through  rising  productivity  in  the  long  run.  In  addition,  basic  education  is  a\nnecessary  input  to  various  government  goals;  e.g.,  for  rural  populations  to  change  practices\nsuch as slash-and-burn and consuming a dwindling supply of wildlife, and to promote successful\nhealth  programs.  Basic  education  is  critical  if  people  are  to  adopt  preventive,  primary  health\ncare measures. Without basic education, people may not appreciate the potential net benefits of\nimmunization  or  mosquito  control.  However,  as  in  other  basic  education  projects,  no  attempt\nhas been made to quantify these external efficiency effects attributable to the Project.\n\nF.\n\nPoverty Impact\n\nAs  of  this  writing,  the  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR  has  not  yet  decided  on  an  official\n9.\npoverty  line.  Two  alternative  lines  developed  by  the  World  Bank  and  the  Swedish  Statistics\nOffice  give  conflicting  information  poverty  incidence.  The  latest  ADB  study  attempted  a\ncalculation  of  a  poverty  line  that  is  consistent  between  the  1992/93  Lao  Expenditure  and\nConsumption Survey and the 1997/98 update, based on which the average total poverty line for\nthe  Lao  PDR  is  estimated  to  be  KN19,184  per  person  per  month  in  1997/98  prices.2  The\nfollowing analysis is based on this poverty line.\n\nAs the Project will serve currently underserved areas, it is expected to make a significant\n10.\ncontribution to intergenerational income improvements and poverty reduction among families in\nthe  target  districts.  This  estimate  is  based  on  certain  assumptions  on  prioritized  outreach  of\nteacher training and school completions associated with the project design and focus that lead\nto the Project having a higher poverty impact (on a head-count basis) than the national poverty\nincidence  level  of  38.6  percent  (footnote  2).  While  the  whole  country  can  be  considered  poor,\nthe Project is envisaged to disproportionately benefit those living below the poverty line.\n\n                  \n\n2 Kakwani, Nanak, Bounthavy Siouphanhthong, Phonesaly Souksavath and Brent Dark. 2001.
