It will improve\naccess  to  quality  health  services  by  upgrading  health  centers  in  rural\nareas  and  enhancing  the  skills  of  health  care  service  providers.  The\nProject  will  also  strengthen  the  demand  for  health  services  through\ntargeted information, education and communication activities, improved\ncommunity  participation,  and  more  equitable  health  financing.  In\nparticular, the Project will support the Government\u2019s scheme to provide\nfree health cards to the poor. The Project will also support preventive\nhealth  care  by  strengthening  food  safety  infrastructure  and  behavior\nchange  communication  (BCC)  centering  on  human  immunodeficiency\nvirus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  (HIV/AIDS),  prevention  of\ninjuries  and  accidents,  tobacco  use,  malnutrition  and  reproductive\nhealth.  United  Nations  Population  Fund,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s\nFund,  and  World  Health  Organization  will  cofinance  the  Project  on  a\nparallel basis.\n\nPrimary objective: Poverty reduction\nSecondary objective: Human development\n\nEnvironmental category: C\n\nEnvironmental implications were reviewed, and no significant  adverse\nenvironmental impacts were identified.\n\nDespite  impressive  achievements  in  the  health  sector,  health  status\nand the use of health services in Viet Nam remain much poorer in rural\nareas  than  in  urban  areas.  These  inequities  are  even  more  stark  in\npoor and remote rural areas and those inhabited by ethnic minorities.\nPoor health is both a cause and effect of poverty. Improving the health\nstatus  of  people  in  rural  areas  will  substantially  contribute  to  poverty\nreduction.  This  will  require  interventions  that  address  both  demand-\nand  supply-side  constraints.  More  appropriate  and  better  quality\nservices  need  to  be  provided  in  rural  areas.  Management  and\nsupervision of health services need to be improved. Financial barriers\nto access must also be addressed through supporting innovative health\nfinancing  mechanisms.  At  the  same  time,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to\npay  greater  attention  to  prevention  activities,  generating  demand  for\nservices, and ensuring greater community participation in the provision\nof services.\n\nClassification\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nRationale\n\nObjectives and\nScope\n\nThe objective of the proposed Project is to improve the health status\nof the rural population, especially the poor and disadvantaged, in 13\nprovinces.  The  objective  will  be  achieved  by  (i)  promoting  access  to\nquality primary health care (PHC) services\u2014with special emphasis on\n\n\fiii\n\nimproving the quality of health services for women, children, the poor\nand  ethnic  minorities\u2014by  upgrading  preventive  and  curative  health\nstructures, basic equipment, and staff skills; (ii) strengthening overall\nfinancial  management,  facilitating  government  policy  for  providing\nhealth  care  to  the  poor,  and  developing  a  pilot  model  for  voluntary\nrural  health \nthe  Ministry  of  Health\u2019s\nmanagement \nimplement  PHC  programs;  and\n(iv) strengthening  communication  support  to  services\u2014especially\nthose  focused  on  reproductive  health,  HIV/AIDS,  injury  prevention,\nsmoking, and nutrition\u2014through community participation.\n\ninsurance;  (iii) improving \nto \n\ncapacity \n\nThe  Project  has  three  components:  (i)  improving  access  to  quality\nthe  health  system;  and  (iii) strengthening\ncare;  (ii) \nprevention and community participation.\n\nimproving \n\nthe  Project \n\ntotal  cost  of \n\nThe \nincluding  physical  and  price\ncontingencies,  and  taxes  and  duties  is  estimated  at  $98.7  million\nequivalent. Of this amount, $26.7 million equivalent, or 27 percent of\nthe  total  cost,  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $72.0  million\nequivalent, or 73 percent of the total cost, is the local cost.\n\nSource\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nPercent\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nADB\nUNICEF\nUNFPA\nWHO\nGovernment\n\n   Total\n\n25.8\n0.5\n0.2\n0.2\n0.0\n\n26.7\n\n42.5\n0.5\n0.3\n0.1\n28.6\n\n72.0\n\n68.3\n1.0\n0.5\n0.3\n28.6\n\n98.7\n\n69.2\n1.0\n0.5\n0.3\n29.0\n\n100.0\n\n_________________________________________________________\nADB = Asian Development Bank, UNFPA = United Nations Population Fund, UNICEF =\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund, WHO = World Health Organization.\n\nThe  equivalent  in  various  currencies  of  Special  Drawing  Rights\n52,354,000  ($68.3  million  equivalent)  from  the  Asian  Development\nBank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Special  Funds  resources,  with  a  term  of  32  years,\nincluding a grace period of 8 years and an interest charge of 1 percent\nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter, and equal amortization.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nFinancing Plan\n\n______________________________________($ million equivalent)__\n\nPeriod of Utilization\n\nUntil 31 December 2006\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nMinistry of Health (MOH)\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nThe Project will be implemented by a central project management unit\nestablished  within  MOH  and  by  provincial  project  management  units\n\n\fProcurement\n\nConsulting\nServices\n\niv\n\nestablished within the provincial departments of health in the 13 project\nprovinces.  Overall  guidance  will  be  provided  by  a  project  steering\ncommittee,  chaired  by  the  minister  of  the  Ministry  of  Health,  with\nrepresentation  from  concerned  departments  of  MOH,  Ministry  of\nFinance,  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  and  the  State  Bank  of\nViet Nam.\n\nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  for  the  Project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. Civil works under the Project are scattered\nthroughout  the  country  and  are  not  likely  to  attract  the  interest  of\ninternational  contractors.  Thus,  it  is  proposed  that  civil  work  contracts\nbe awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures\nacceptable  to  ADB.  Contracts  for  the  supply  of  materials,  equipment,\nand medical supplies in packages valued at $500,000 or more will be\nprocured  through  international  bidding;  contracts  valued  at  less  than\n$500,000  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping.  Some\nmedical equipment (e.g., hospital beds, delivery beds, and tables) that\nis  locally  produced  and  is  unlikely  to  attract  foreign  suppliers  will  be\nprocured  through  LCB.  Minor  items  or  packages  costing  $100,000  or\nless will be procured under direct purchase procedures in accordance\nwith Government rules acceptable to ADB.\n\nOne  international  (8  person-months)  and  98  domestic  consultants\n(522  person-months)  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The\nconsultants will (i) prepare and adapt integrated care  guidelines  and\nquality of care guidelines (1 international and 2 domestic); (ii) prepare\ntraining  modules  for  district  and  commune  service  providers  (12\ndomestic,  including  3  for  ethnic  minority  areas);  (iii)  undertake\nfeasibility  studies  for  the  rural  health  insurance  pilots,  design  health\ninsurance cards, develop a health insurance management information\nsystem,  and  develop  training  programs  for  health  insurance  officials\n(10  domestic);  (iv)  develop  training  modules  and  materials  for\nmanagement training for provincial and district officials (10 domestic);\n(v) prepare  and  adapt  guidelines \nfor  BCC  planning  and\nimplementation,  and  develop  training  modules  and  materials  for\ntraining BCC officials (3 domestic); and (vi) provide support to village\nhealth workers (5 domestic). In addition, domestic consultants will be\nrecruited for (i) a survey and design of health facilities (31 domestic);\n(ii)  training  health  staff  in  using  management  information  system\n(4 domestic); (iii) undertaking the household survey and analyzing of\ndata  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  the  Project  (15  domestic);  and\n(iv) preparing  guidelines  for  bidding  and  procurement  of  equipment\n(6 domestic).  This  level  of  consulting  services  is  the  minimum\nrequired to effectively carry out the Project.\n\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\n30 June 2006\n\n\fv\n\nProject Benefits and\nBeneficiaries\n\nThe  Project  will  improve  access  to  quality  health  services  for  12.7\nmillion  people  (about  6.7  women  and  6  million  men)  living  in  rural\nareas, thereby directly or indirectly improving their health status. The\nProject will especially benefit 3 million women in the reproductive age\ngroup,  1.3  million  people  from  ethnic  minorities,  6.2  million  poor\npeople,  2  million  children,  and  1.5  million  elderly.  The  Project  will\nbenefit  about  1.5  million  pregnant  women  and  1.3  million  newborn\nchildren  during  the  project  period.  Due  to  self-selection  and  specific\nproject design, the majority of the project beneficiaries will be the poor\nand  women.  In  addition,  the  project  interventions  will  directly  benefit\n800,000 poor people through free health cards.\n\nThe  Project  will  train  about  7,500  health  care  providers,  the  majority\nof whom will be women.\n\nAt  the  national  level,  the  Project  will  assist  in  establishing  standards\nand procedures for ensuring food safety. It will improve management\nand  supervision  of  health  services  and  assist  the  government  in\nmaking health financing more equitable and efficient. The Project will\nalso  build  capacity  for  preventive  health  and  BCC  at  the  provincial\nand district levels.\n\n\fI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\n\n1.\nloan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Rural Health Project.\n\nI.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nAs requested by the Government, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project\npreparatory  technical  assistance1  in  1999  to  help  prepare  the  Rural  Health  Project  to  improve\nthe health status of the rural population, especially the poor and disadvantaged, in 13 provinces\nof  Viet  Nam.  The  proposal  was  developed  with  the  close  participation  of  a  wide  range  of\nstakeholders  including  representatives  from  the  related  government  ministries,  provincial\ngovernments, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), potential beneficiaries, service providers,\nand international development agencies. The Project will be cofinanced by the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  United  Nations  Population  Fund  (UNFPA),  and  World  Health\nOrganization  (WHO)  on  a  parallel  basis.  Fact-finding  was  carried  out  from  14  January  to  2\nFebruary 2000. An Appraisal Mission2 was fielded 5-24 April 2000. The project framework is in\nAppendix 1.\n\nA. \n\nThe Health Sector\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n3.\nViet Nam has achieved a health status level beyond what is expected for a country at its\nstage  of economic development. Life expectancy, for example, is 11 years longer than that of\nother countries at a similar stage of economic development. Infant mortality in the past 20 years\nhas  been  significantly  reduced,  from  90  per  1,000  live  births  in  1980  to  38  per  1,000  now.\nImmunization  is  almost  universal  and  fertility  rates  have  fallen  by  about  25  percent  in  the  last\nfive years to 2.4 children per women. Compared with other economic development measures,\nmalnutrition  is  one  of  the  few  indicators  in  which  Viet  Nam  may  be  lagging\u201339  percent  of\nchildren are malnourished.\n\n1.\n\nGeneral Health Patterns\n\n4.\nViet  Nam  is  currently  facing  epidemiological  polarization  whereby  communicable\ndiseases  coexist  with  noncommunicable  diseases.  While  infectious,  vector-borne  and  other\ncommunicable  diseases  still  account  for  a  large  percentage  of  mortality  and  morbidity,\nespecially in rural areas, the incidence of noncommunicable diseases is also rising rapidly. The\nrural population has three times as large a burden of disease per unit population as the urban\nthe  rural  populations  have  a  substantial  burden  of\npopulation.  At \nnoncommunicable  diseases,  some  of  which  can  be \ninjuries  and  chemical\ncontamination during the Indochina war of the 1960s and later.\n\nthe  same \n\ntraced \n\ntime, \n\nto \n\n                                                \n1 TA 3077-VIE: Rural Health Project, for $600,000, approved on 25 September 1998.\n2 The  Mission  comprised  I.  Bhushan,  Senior  Project  Economist/Mission  Leader;  T.  Konishi,  Young  Professional;\n\nD.C. Jayasuriya, Consultant; and E. Whitney, Consultant.\n\n\f2\n\nThe aging population, increasing trend towards urbanization, and unhealthy lifestyles are\n5.\nexpected  to  further  increase  the  incidence  of  noncommunicable  diseases  and  thereby  add  to\nthe  disease  burden.  For  example,  mortality  from  coronary  disease  in  Viet  Nam  is  projected  to\nincrease  by  60  percent  from  1995  to  2010.  The  rate  could  increase  by  even  more  if  smoking\nbecomes  more  widespread.  Similarly,  increased  hypertension  and  deaths  from  apoplexy  will\nresult.  Deaths  caused  by  chronic  pulmonary  obstructive  disease  could  increase  due  to  aging,\npollution,  and  smoking.  Cancers  are  expected  to  increase  at  similarly  rapid  rates.  Diabetes\nmellitus  and  endocrinologic  diseases  have  not  been  widely  studied,  but  it  is  estimated  that\ndiabetes afflicts 1-2 percent of the population.\n\n6.\nSince  about  1990,  accidents  have  become  a  leading  cause  of  mortality  and  morbidity,\nparticularly  for  men  aged  15-49.  In  1990-1997,  mortality  caused  by  traffic  accidents  increased\nthree  times.  The  prevalence  of  tuberculosis  has  been  falling  due  to  overall  development,  but\nmay have slightly increased in recent years, in part due to the growing HIV/AIDS3 problem. The\ndisease burden of malaria has been significantly reduced for the vast majority of the population.\nIn 1998, the Ministry of Health reported 383,000 cases with 183 deaths.\n\na.\n\nHealth and Poverty\n\n7.\nHealth status is closely associated with poverty in Viet Nam. Sickness and ill-health lead\nto  poverty,  and  the  health  status  of  the  poor  tends  to  be  worse  than  that  of  the  nonpoor.  The\noccurrence of illness\u2014leading to loss of labor resources and significant costs for curative health\ncare and associated expenditure\u2014is reportedly one of the prominent causes of poverty. Studies\nshow  that  once  a  household  loses  an  adult  member  to  sickness  or  disability,  income  levels\nsuddenly drop and the household slides into poverty. The burden of disease\u2014as measured by\nthe  disability  adjusted  life  years  (DALYs)4  lost  per  thousand  people\u2014among  the  poorest  rural\nyoung  children  is  more  than  27  times  the  rate  among  those  in  urban  areas.  For  the  entire\npopulation, the poor rural population has a four fold greater disease burden than urban dwellers.\n\n8.\nMalnutrition among children less than 4 years is nearly three times greater for the rural\npoor than for urban dwellers. The average duration of illness restricting normal activity is greater\namong the poor than the well-off\u201417.5 percent greater in rural areas and 33 percent in urban\nareas. The  infant  mortality  rate  in  1998  in  the  rural  poor  areas  of  the  country  was  nearly  50\npercent  greater  than  that  in  all  rural  areas  and  fourfold  greater  than  that  in  urban  areas.  This\ndifference partly reflects the relatively poor availability of maternal and child health services in\nrural areas. Similarly, in the mid-1990s, life expectancy was over 10 years greater in the more\nurban  and relatively affluent Red River delta (70.8 years) than in the poorer and mountainous\ncentral highlands (60.5 years).\n\nb.\n\nChildren and Women\n\n9.\nInfant mortality in rural areas is typically 50 percent higher than that in urban areas. In\naddition, there are pockets of poor and disadvantaged groups, such as ethnic minorities, where\nthe rate is 50 percent higher than that in the average rural area. The leading causes of infant\nmortality  in  areas  of  high  mortality  are  acute  respiratory  infection,  diarrhea,  malaria,  and\ndiseases  preventable  by  immunization.  Respiratory  infections  and  diarrhea  account  for  nearly\n60  percent  of  infant  mortality.  Neonatal  mortality  is  mostly  due  to  umbilical  tetanus  (about  40\n\n                                                \n3 Human immunodeficiency virus/Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\n4 Disability adjusted life year (DALY) is defined as the present value of the future years of disability-free life that are\n\nlost as the result of premature death or cases of disability occurring in a particular year.\n\n\f3\n\npercent), trauma at birth (about 30 percent), and pneumonia (about 15 percent). Malnutrition is\na major contributing factor in most infant deaths occurring in poor areas.\n\n10. Women of reproductive age bear more than 80 percent of the burden of communicable\ndiseases,  nutritional  deficiency,  and  perinatal  and  maternal  conditions  in  the  rural  areas.\nMaternal mortality in Viet Nam is estimated to be 110 for every 100,000 live births\u2014160 in rural\nareas and 200 among the poor. In the remote mountainous areas, maternal mortality is probably\nfour  times  that  in  the  average  rural  area.  This  is  because  services  to  address  sudden  acute\nconditions  that  may  occur  during  delivery  are  simply  not  available.  The  leading  causes  of\nmaternal  mortality  are  hemorrhaging,  postpartum  infection,  eclampsia,  tetanus,  and  uterus\nrupture. Thirty  percent of  women of  reproductive age suffer from malnutrition, which is closely\nlinked  with  women's  social  status  and  stunting  from  chronic  protein-energy  malnutrition.    This\nimpacts  on  women's  quality  of  life,  productivity,  stamina,  and  capacity  for  postnatal  recovery.\nMost of these conditions can be prevented through regular prenatal examinations and medical\nsupervision during risky pregnancies.\n\n11. While the total fertility rate has fallen to 1.8 children per woman in urban areas, the rate\nis  high  in  rural  areas  (2.9  children  per  woman),  especially  among  ethnic  minority  groups  (3.4\nchildren per woman). The contraceptive prevalence rate is 79.3 percent at the national level; the\nfigure  is  lower  in  rural  areas  (74.4  percent)  and  much  lower  in  ethnic  minority  areas  (66.4\npercent). Although no reliable figures are available, it is widely believed that the prevalence of\nreproductive tract infections is very high among women of reproductive age and contributes to\nsexually transmitted diseases. HIV/AIDS is a growing concern in the country, especially in areas\nbordering the People\u2019s Republic of China and Cambodia. A recent World Bank study indicates\nthat  domestic  violence,  which  affects  women's  mental  and  physical  health  status,  is  widely\nprevalent.\n\n2.\n\nHealth System\n\n12.\nThe  public  sector  health  system  in  Viet  Nam  is  organized  in  four  tiers.  At  the  central\nlevel, the Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for formulating health policies and establishing\ntechnical  standards  for  the  health  system.  MOH  has  15  departments  divided  into  general\ndepartments (planning, personnel, finance, legislation, international cooperation and inspection\nboard)  and  specialty  departments  (therapy,  preventive  medicine,  mother  and  child  care  and\nfamily  planning,  traditional  medicine,  medical  equipment  and  construction,  drug  administration\nand food safety and hygiene). MOH also has a Health Strategy and Policy Center and a Health\nEducation  Center.  In  addition,  the  central  offices  of  MOH  operate  10  specialty  hospitals,  19\ninstitutes  (typically  involved  in  the  vertical  programs),  11  medical  and  pharmacy  schools  and\nstate-owned  enterprises  such  as  the  health  insurance  company,  a  publishing  corporation,  and\nan equipment corporation. The organization of MOH is shown in Appendix 2.\n\n13.\nThe country has a well-developed infrastructure of health services with a wide network of\nprovincial,  district,  intercommune,  and  commune  health  centers.  On  average,  families  are  4.4\nkilometers (km) from a commune health center and 10 km from a district health center.\n\n14.\nAt the provincial level, the provincial People\u2019s Committee supervises the health service\nand is responsible for managing and directing health care. It is also responsible for preventive\nmedicine centers, provincial-level medical training schools, local production of medical supplies,\nand  operating  the  provincial  hospital.  The  provincial  health  service,  while  under  the\nadministrative  control  of  the  People\u2019s  Committee,  receives  technical  guidance  and  monitoring\nfrom MOH.\n\n\f4\n\n15.\nThe district health center (DHC) is a unit of the provincial health service under the direct\ntechnical  management  of  the  director  of  Provincial  Health  Services,  with  guidance  and  policy\nprovided by the district People\u2019s Committee. The DHC manages the first-level referral curative\nservices  and  is  responsible  for  formulating  and  implementing  a  district  health  plan;  providing\ncurative, preventive, and family planning services in the district; and giving technical support to\nintercommune polyclinics (ICPs) and commune health centers (CHCs).\n\nThe CHC is the first level of health care in the public health system. It is responsible for\n16.\nprimary-level  curative  care  as  well  as  preventive  care,  normal  delivery,  provision  of  essential\ndrugs, family planning, and overall health improvement in the community. It functions under the\nguidance  of  the  DHC  for  technical  matters  and  under  the  chairman  of  the  commune  People\u2019s\nCommittee for planning and supporting health development activities in the commune.\n\n17.\nThe village health worker (VHW) is an integral part of the health system network. About\n40  percent  of  the  80,000  villages  have  a  VHW.  VHWs  play  a  particularly  significant  role  in\nextending health care services in poor and remote areas, in ethnic minority communities, and in\nthe highly populated communes. MOH policy is to increase the coverage of these workers.\n\n18.\nPrivate sector services have grown rapidly in recent years. The number of private health\nproviders has almost doubled since 1996. However, this growth is less visible in terms of health\nclinics than in the number of private pharmacies, which grew from an estimated 2,000 in 1990 to\naround 7,500 by end-1996.\n\n3.\n\nHealth Care Utilization\n\n19.\nCoverage  and  utilization  of  maternal  and  child  health  services  are  adequate,  except\namong  ethnic  minorities  and  poor  people.  About  89  percent  of  deliveries  are  supervised  by  a\ntrained service provider: 99 percent in urban areas and 87 percent in rural areas. However, the\nquality of service providers varies significantly. While 75 percent of deliveries are supervised by\na doctor in urban areas, only 19 percent of rural deliveries are so supervised.\n\nThe  rural  poor  use  public  health  services  only  about  half  as  much  as  the  urban\n20.\npopulation  do.  The  pattern  of  utilization  is  the  most  strikingly  different  for  hospital  outpatient\nservices,  where  the  rural  poor  use  only  25  percent  of  that  by  the  urban  population.  Surveys\nshow  that,  once  sick,  the  poor  are  less  likely  to  use  health  facilities  and  more  likely  to  self-\nmedicate.  Even  when  they  use  health  services,  they  are  more  likely  to  go  to  unqualified\nproviders and low-quality health facilities. This is a manifestation of both more limited physical\naccess to quality health services in rural areas and lower affordability of health services.\n\nStudies  on  the  quality  of  health  services  point  to  the  need  for  modernizing  equipment,\n21.\nupgrading dilapidated facilities, improving staff skills and motivation, and increasing supervision\nand support. Ninety percent of the surveyed DHCs have difficulties in providing quality care due\nto limited equipment. District laboratory capability is extremely limited, and in most facilities, the\nX-ray  equipment  is  very  old.  Referral  services  for  emergencies,  surgery,  and  obstetric  and\ngynecological  services  can  also  be  significantly  improved  by  the  provision  of  the  basic\nequipment prescribed for these services by MOH standards. Staff are available at most districts,\nbut as services have not been available for some time, their skills have become outdated. Very\nfew ICPs have any diagnostic equipment.\n\n\f5\n\n4.\n\nHuman Resources\n\n22.\nMOH, with a staff of approximately 213,000 employees, is the largest employer of health\npersonnel  in  Viet  Nam.  There  are  over  10,000  health  workers  in  other  ministries.  The  armed\nforces operate a medical service independently of the health sector.\n\n23.\nThere  are  substantial  differences  in  access  to  qualified  health  personnel  between\nprovinces  and  even  within  provinces.  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  Hai  Phong,  and  Quang  Ninh,  for\nexample,  have  at  least  5  doctors  per  10,000  population,  while  in  provinces  of  the  northern\nhighlands  and  Mekong  River  delta,  this  ratio  is  significantly  lower\u20142  doctors  per  10,000\npopulation. Within a province, health resources tend to be concentrated in the provincial capitals\nand, to a lesser extent in the districts.\n\n24.\nThe  Government  has  consistently  placed  high  priority  on  the  development  of  human\nresources  for  health.  In  the  early  part  of  the  transition  after  doi  moi,  as  the  number  of\ncommunity-supported  commune  health  workers  rapidly  declined,  the  Government  quickly\nadopted  a  policy  of  providing  financial  support  for  these  workers  directly  from  the  Central\nGovernment budget. This reversed the decline in utilization of services at the CHC. The current\npolicy is to provide 40 percent of CHCs with a physician by the year 2000, the current coverage\nbeing 22.5 percent.\n\n25.\nMany  health  workers  have  not  had  sufficient  opportunity  to  upgrade  their  skills  and\ntechnical knowledge. Consequently, there is a need for retraining in the districts and communes\nto upgrade workers\u2019 skills and inform them of advances in medical science and new technology.\nIt is difficult to precisely assess the quality of health staff in the project provinces. However, the\nlow utilization of health services and high morbidity rates for some common diseases reflect the\npossibility that quality of care is an issue. In remote areas, the quality of the typical health staff\ncan be improved.\n\n26.\nThe  formal  training  system  of  MOH  includes  a  network  of  university  and  technical\ntraining  schools  some  80  in  all  nationwide.  The  Department  of  Science  and  Training  is\nresponsible  for  the  technical  aspects  of  the  training.  Each  province  has  a  secondary  medical\nschool  (SMS),  which  trains  mainly  secondary-level  personnel  and,  occasionally,  elementary-\nlevel  health  workers.  There  are  approximately  50  SMSs,  10  training  centers,  and  7  national\nschools  of  nursing,  pharmacy,  traditional  medicine,  and  medical  technicians  that  train\nsecondary-level  workers.  Provincial  SMSs  and  training  centers  are  under  the  control  of  the\nprovincial health service.\n\n5.\n\nHealth Financing\n\nThe  health  sector  has  grown  rapidly  in  recent  years.  Per  capita  spending  for  health\n27.\nincreased  from  about  $12  in  1993  to  more  than  $19  in  1998.  About  one  half  of  total  health\nexpenditure  was  spent  on  publicly  operated  health  facilities  and  related  preventive  programs.\nPrivately  provided  diagnostic  services  comprised  about  one  sixth  of \ntotal,  with\npharmaceutical services making up about one third. Households remain the dominant source of\nfinancing health care services, accounting for about 80 percent of all health expenditures. The\nshare  of  health  expenditures  financed  by  health  insurance  is  2-2.6  percent.  International  aid\nagencies  finance  a  similarly  small  share.  User  charges  constitute  an  important  source  of\nrevenue  for  hospitals,  and  contribute  about  7  percent  of  total  health  expenditure.  The\nGovernment at all levels finances the remaining 11-15 percent from its general revenues. While\nprivate  sector  spending  for  health  care  services  clearly  dominates  the  sector,  public  sector\n\nthe \n\n\f6\n\nspending for health has increased significantly since 1986. Per capita government expenditure\non health increased 4.1 times between 1986 and 1998. However, it still represents only over 1.0\npercent  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita,  and  at  less  than  $4  per  capita  remains\nmuch  lower  than  the  World  Bank-recommended  level  of  $12  to  provide  basic  primary  health\ncare (PHC) services.\n\n28.\nHealth insurance, introduced in 1992, covers 9.8 million people\u2014about 15 percent of the\npopulation.  There  are  two  insurance  programs  operated  by  the  same  agency.  A  compulsory\nprogram  of  health  insurance  includes  all  government  employees,  workers  of  state-owned\nenterprises,  foreign-owned  firms,  and  international  organizations  and  any  private  firm  with  more\nthan 10 employees. The voluntary health insurance scheme is intended to primarily cover family\nmembers of those insured under the compulsory scheme, farmers, other rural populations, school\nstudents, and informal sector workers. While the compulsory program has enrolled more than 75\npercent  of  its target population,  the voluntary program has barely made a dent into its intended\ntarget  group.  This  implies  that  the  growth  of  health  insurance  in  the  future  must  focus  on  the\npopulation intended to be served by the voluntary program.\n\n6.\n\nMajor Issues in the Sector\n\na.\n\nEquity and Quality of Care\n\n29.\nOne  of  the  biggest  challenges  facing  policy  makers  in  the  health  sector  is  the  large\ninequities  in  health  outcomes  and  utilization  of  health  services.  People  in  rural  areas  and  the\npoor  are  at  greater  disadvantage  than  their  urban  and  better-off  counterparts.  Analysis  shows\nthat while the health care needs of women, children, and the poor are much greater than those\nof  others,  these  groups  do  not  adequately  use  health  services.  The  major  reason  for  low\nutilization of health services by the poor is the high cost. Other contributing factors are the poor\nquality  of  services  in  rural  areas  and  the  indifference  of  service  providers.  For  ethnic  minority\ncommunities,  difficult  geography  and  barriers  of  language  and  culture  also  play  an  important\nrole.  These  factors  have  contributed  to  increased  use  of  self-treatment  among  disadvantaged\ngroups.\n\nAnother  priority  issue  for  health  services  is  the  need  for  improved  quality  of  care.  The\n30.\neconomic  transition,  with  general  fiscal  constraints  and  the  disappearance  of  the  agriculture\ncooperative system that supported CHCs, has resulted in marked deterioration of PHC services\nat  all  levels.  This  is  manifested  in  dilapidated  buildings,  acute  shortage  of  equipment  and\nsupplies, inadequate retraining, and low productivity of service providers due to difficult working\nconditions  and  poor  salaries.  The  experience  of  the  Population  and  Family  Health  Project5\nshows  that  improvements  in  quality  of  care  can  be  achieved  by  supporting  services  that  are\nrequired  to  meet  the  most  serious  health  needs  at  commune  and  district  levels.  These  needs\ninclude  complications  from  delivery,  access  to  referral  facilities  for  high-risk  pregnancies,  and\nimmediate  referral  services  for  childhood  diseases  and  accidents.  These  services  must  be\nreadily available at district centers.\n\nb.\n\nChanging Disease Patterns and Emerging Challenges\n\n31.\nViet  Nam  is  undergoing  an  epidemiological  transition:  the  pattern  of  diseases  is\nchanging  from  a  predominance  of  communicable  diseases  to  a  predominance  of  largely\nnoncommunicable  diseases.  A  significant  emerging  issue  for  the  health  system  is  how  to\n\n                                                \n5 Loan 1460-VIE: Population and Family Health, for $43 million, approved on 19 September 1996.\n\n\f7\n\nappropriately  address  the  changing  burden  of  disease.  Evidence  shows  that  this  changing\npattern of disease is already affecting the health system in some rural areas. The challenges for\nthe health system are to provide the most appropriate cost-effective care, and to diagnose the\nearly  signs  of  lifestyle  diseases  including  cancer  and  cardiovascular  conditions  before  they\nevolve  into  life-threatening  conditions  entailing  costly  treatments  for  the  individuals  and  the\nhealth system. This will also require greater emphasis on health education and behavior change\ncommunication (BCC).\n\nThe rapid increase of HIV/AIDS infection, growing illicit drug use, declining but still high\n32.\nlevels of tobacco use, a large increase in accident-related deaths, and persistently high levels of\nchild  malnutrition  require  priority  attention.  In  addition,  the  area  of  food  hygiene  and  safety  is\nemerging  as  a  major  public  health  challenge.  The  number  and  types  of  food  processing\nbusinesses and facilities are expanding at a phenomenal rate in response to increasing demand\nfor ready-to-eat food and the withdrawal of the government from such services. Many of these\nnew enterprises are using ingredients and chemicals that, if not efficiently monitored, can create\nmajor health hazards for the public. Chemical contamination caused during the Indo-China war\nis also believed to have affected the food chain and poses a threat to health of the population.\nThe  food  safety  inspection  program,  particularly  at  the  province  level,  needs  substantial\nstrengthening.\n\nc.\n\nHealth Sector Financing\n\n33.\nThe  overall  public  financing  of  the  health  sector  in  Viet  Nam  is  low  by  international\nstandards.  Moreover,  public  financing  remains  concentrated  on  subsidizing  curative  services.\nOne unfortunate consequence of the low levels of public financing is that the poor have to bear\nthe burden of high user charges at public health facilities. These fees have discouraged use. In\naddition,  there  are  large  disparities  in  government  health  expenditure  across  provinces  since\nricher provinces are able to spend more than poorer provinces. The situation also exacerbates\ninequities in provision of health services across the country. Pharmacies take a large share of\nspending  on  health.  Current  spending  patterns  show  inefficiency  due  to  poor  prescribing\npractices and overuse of antibiotics.\n\nUser  fee  collection  has  increased  dramatically  in  recent  years\u2014increasing  more  than\n34.\nfour times from 1991 to 1998. In theory, the poor and disadvantaged should not be subject to\nuser charges. In practice, however, these guidelines rarely work, especially in the communes.\nStudies  have  found  a  weak  correlation  between  fee  exemptions  and  household  income.\nIdentification  of  the  poor  at  public  facilities  is  based  on  the  subjective  judgment  of  the  health\nproviders.\n\n35.\nHealth  insurance  primarily  covers  people  working  in  the  formal  sector,  thereby  almost\ncompletely  leaving  out  the  poor.  Comprehensive  coverage  through  voluntary  health  insurance\ncan  potentially  make  a  significant  contribution  to  health  financing  requirements  and  effectively\npool  the  health  risks  of  the  population.  Appropriately  designed  health  insurance  programs  can\nyield both efficiency and equity gains. Insurance policies can influence where people seek care\nand discourage inefficient use. The health care provider can be influenced by the design of the\npayment  mechanism  so  that  the  most  appropriate  care  is  provided.  The  poor  can  also  be\ntargeted by directly subsidizing their premiums.\n\n\f8\n\nd.\n\nHealth Management\n\n36.\nThe  health  system  works  under  conditions  dominated  by  the  past  culture  of  central\nplanning. This is manifested in two ways: first, significant amounts of funds and resources are\nallocated  through  the  rigid  structure  of  top-down  vertical  programs,  which  are  not  adequately\nresponsive to local needs. Second, previous processes have never offered opportunities for the\ndevelopment of capacity and initiative for program planning and implementation at the provincial\nand  district  levels.  There  is  a  strong  need  to  integrate  various  vertical  programs  and\ndecentralize the planning functions of MOH, while developing capacities at provincial and district\nlevels  so  that  they  can  provide  effective  leadership  in  addressing  local  problems.  Another\nmanagement  concern  relates  to  service  delivery.  Improvements  in  the  referral  system,\nsupportive  supervision  of  health  facilities  in  districts  and  communes,  improved  management\ninformation system (MIS) and more intensive community participation can significantly improve\nthe efficiency of services.\n\ne.\n\nRegulation of the Private Sector\n\n37.\nThe national health policy encourages the development of the private sector. However,\nthe  role  of  the  private  sector  in  the  health  system  needs  to  be  clarified  and  supervision  and\nmonitoring of the quality of care provided by private practitioners strengthened, especially since\nmany  providers  operating  in  the  private  sector  are  also  employed  in  the  public  sector.  Also,\nrapid expansion of retail pharmaceutical outlets in recent years has encouraged self-treatment\nand overuse of drugs. This unsupervised and often irrational use of drugs has resulted in high\nlevels of antibiotic resistance, which poses a serious threat to the country\u2019s ability to control and\nprevent  the  spread  of  infectious  diseases.  Stronger  efforts  are  required  for  controlling  both\ndemand for and supply of pharmaceuticals.\n\n38.\nAnother private sector issue that has direct impact on health is the safety and hygiene of\nfood items available in the market. The trend toward consumption of ready-to-eat food is rising\nand the number of private sector suppliers of processed food items shows a manifold increase.\nTherefore a major challenge for the public health system is to ensure a safe and hygienic food\nsupply. Current regulations on food adulteration remain ineffective and there are concerns about\nthe ability of provincial health services to enforce them.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\nGovernment  policies  in  the  health  sector  support  the  provision  of  health  for  all,  with\n39.\nspecial emphasis on the health needs of the poor and disadvantaged. The Government policy,\nas articulated in the Law on Protection of People\u2019s Health 1989, recognizes the major role of the\ngovernment  in  managing,  improving,  and  developing  systems  for  preventing  and  controlling\nepidemics,  medical  examination  and  treatment,  production  and  distribution  of  equipment  and\ndrugs,  and  monitoring  the  implementation  of  all  regulations  on  professional  medicine  and\npharmaceutical  practices.  Specific  programs  and  guidelines  have  been  developed  for  specific\nhealth needs, including tuberculosis, malaria, immunization, malnutrition, diarrheal disease, and\nacute respiratory diseases.\n\n40.\nThe  MOH\u2019s  1996  policy  statement\u2014The  Strategy  Orientation  for  People\u2019s  Health  Care\nand  Protection  from  Now  to  the  Year  2000  and  2020\u2014provides  a  medium-term  vision  for  the\nhealth sector. The document lays down specific goals in terms of health status, organizational\nstructure, training, research, promotion of management, socialization strategies, and promotion\nof priority health programs, placing rural health at its center. The objectives of the strategy are to\n\n\f9\n\nexpand  the  health  network,  improve  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  health  care  provision,  and\nimplement  a  policy  to  achieve  social  equity  in  health  care.  The  key  feature  of  the  policy  is\nstreamlining the organizational structure and developing a decentralized health care network.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  basic  law  guiding  health  institutions  and  structures,  other  laws  that\n41.\nhave been enacted add specificity to the strategy for achieving the basic goals. For example, for\nthe first time, the Ordinance on Private Medical and Pharmaceutical Practice6 provides the legal\nbasis  for  private  medical  practice  both  modern  and  traditional.  The  law  outlines  the  types  of\nprivate practice allowed and the criteria for licensing of practitioners.\n\n42.\nIn  1989,  the  Government  established  well-defined  policies  and  procedures  for  cost\nrecovery  for  health  services.  The  Government  defined  the  types  of  services  that  could  be\ncharged to the patient, patients that were provided exemptions, and the system for distribution\nand use of the collected fee. This decision was replaced in 1994 by a Decree7 providing more\nclarification  on  collection  and  use  of  fees  by  hospitals,  including  their  relationship  to  health\ninsurance cardholders.\n\n43.\nGovernment  policies  that  have  evolved  over  the  last  decade  pay  more  attention  to  the\nneeds of the poor and disadvantaged. The cost recovery policy promulgated in 1994 specifically\nprovides exemptions for the poor and disadvantaged groups. A particularly significant measure\nwas  a  decision8  on  setting  priorities  for  poor  and  remote  communities.  This  decision  identified\n1,715 communes that will have special priority for investment in all sectors. Particular attention\nis placed on 1,000 of these communes where poverty reduction and other social and economic\ngoals are specifically targeted. In addition, the Government has specific policies and guidelines\nfor addressing priority target groups such as children and women, in response to various United\nNations conventions. For example, the National Plan of Action for Child Survival is based on the\n1991  law  on  the  Protection  and  Care  of  Children.  This  Law  entitles  all  Vietnamese  children\nunder six years of age to receive free medical examinations and immunizations. Recently, the\nGovernment  also  announced  a  new  initiative  of  providing  free  health  insurance  coverage  to  4\nmillion poor people in the country.\n\n44.\nThe Government recognizes that, with the growing demand for processed foods and the\nexpansion of food service establishments, there is an urgent need to ensure a hygienic and safe\nfood supply for the population. Two recent regulations provide the policy direction and technical\nrequirement for MOH and other agencies to establish programs that will guarantee a safe food\nsupply.9  These  regulations  assign  MOH  as  the  main  agency  responsible  for  ensuring  food\nsafety.  The  specific  responsibilities  include  dissemination  of  information  and  education,\ninspection  and  monitoring  analysis,  and  reporting  on  food  safety  activities.  The  regulations\nfurther  define  inspection  and  control  activities  that  will  be  carried  out  by  the  provincial  food\nsafety units, including the specific tests to be performed.\n\n                                                \n6 Ordinance No. 26 L/CTN of October 13, 1993 on Private Medical and Pharmaceutical Practices.\n7 Decree No. 95/CP of August 27, 1994, of the Government on Collection of Hospital Fees.\n8  Decision  No.135/1998/QD-TTg,  July  31,  1998;  Socioeconomic  Development  in  Mountainous  and  Remote\n\nCommunes with Special Difficulties.\n\n9  Directive No. 08/1999 CT-TTg, dated 15 April 1999, of the Prime Minister outlines goals and the organization of the\nnational food safety program; Directive No. 14/1999 QD-TTg of the Prime Minster outlines the specific duties of the\nMinister of Health and provincial level in ensuring a safe food supply for the country.\n\n\fC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n10\n\n45.\nMany external agencies have been involved in financing the health sector in Viet Nam.\nAbout 179 projects have been financed by international development agencies and NGOs since\n1991.  However,  most  of  the  projects  are  small  in  size  and  scope.  The  details  of  total  official\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) for the sector are in Appendix 3. The seven largest contributors\naccount  for  nearly  90  percent  of  total  official  ODA  resources  to  the  health  sector.  These  are\nADB,  Australia,  Japan,  Sweden,  UNICEF,  European  Union,  and  World  Bank.  In  addition,\nUNFPA, WHO, and the Netherlands have played an important role in strengthening the health\nsector in Viet Nam.\n\n46.\nThe annual financial flows into the health sector have almost doubled between 1991 and\n1998, with $75 million of external assistance disbursed in 1998. However, external assistance in\nthe  last  five  years  has  remained  almost  constant  in  real  terms.  In  fact,  the  share  of  ODA\nfinancing  for  the  health  sector  has  declined  over  time\u2013from  14  percent  of  total  health  sector\nspending  in  1991  to  7  percent  in  1996  and  9  percent  in  1997.  Grant  assistance  also  shows  a\ndeclining trend in absolute terms and is being gradually replaced with loan funds.\n\n47.\nThe  pattern  of  external  assistance  for  health  in  Viet  Nam  has  been  lopsided,  leaving\nseveral  geographic  areas  and  critical  sectors  underfunded.  Assistance  has  been  highly\nconcentrated among a few provinces. For example, a large proportion of total disbursements of\nODA over the period 1991-1998 has gone to Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, and Hanoi. Studies\nshow  that  more  than  80  percent  of  ODA  in  this  period  went  to  provinces  accounting  for  only\nabout  30  percent  of  the  population.  Targeting  of  external  assistance  to  a  few  provinces  may\nhave been justified if the selected provinces were the poorest in the country. However, analysis\nshows  no  systematic  relationship  between  external  assistance  and  the  per  capita  GDP  of  the\nprovince,  with  the  result  that  some  of  the  neediest  provinces  have  not  benefited  much  from\nexternal assistance.\n\n48.\nThe  focus  of  external  assistance  has  been  on  providing  support  to  vertical  health\nprograms of MOH. More than 60 percent of the committed funds between 1990 and 1998 were\nfor  nine  vertical  programs.  This  focus  is  probably  based  on  ease  of  implementation  and\ndisbursement,  since  vertical  programs  are  clearly  defined  programs  with  well-developed\nimplementation  structures.  Human  resource  development  (excluding  that  conducted  in  the\nvertical programs) has accounted for only about 4 percent of committed external support.\n\nOnly  recently  has  significant  support  gone  into  upgrading  health  facilities,  mainly  from\n49.\nthe recent projects supported by the World Bank and ADB. The Population and Family Health\nProject  supported  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  and  the  National  Health  Support  Project\nsupported by the World Bank cover 36 of the 61 provinces of Viet Nam. In addition, the Health\nProject  financed  by  the  European  Union  will  upgrade  PHC  facilities  in  three  provinces.\nTherefore, not counting the three relatively well-off provinces of Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Da\nNang,  the  remaining  19  provinces  do  not  have  any  major  support  for  upgrading  the  PHC\ninfrastructure.\n\n50.\nThe presence of a large number of international agencies in the sector is a challenge for\nMOH.  In  last  few  years,  MOH  has  gained  valuable  experience  in  coordinating  the  activities  of\ndifferent  agencies.  Recently,  it  demonstrated  its  capacity  to  effectively  coordinate  external\nassistance  by  leading  a  health  sector  review  supported  by  all  the  major  international\ndevelopment  agencies  and  NGOs  in  the  sector.  Different  international  agencies  have  made\n\n\f11\n\nincreasing  efforts  to  coordinate  their  activities  and  leverage  their  interventions  and  projects\naround a common set of objectives and priorities.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n51.\nMOH  has  implemented  several  externally  funded  health  projects  in  the  last  decade.\nSome  lessons  learned  from  implementing  these  projects  and  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  in\nimplementing health projects in other countries are as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nAid  agency  coordination.  Lack  of  aid  agency  coordination  in  designing  and\nimplementing  projects  has  led  to  inefficient  and  wasteful  use  of  resources;\nconflicting  philosophies  about  health  system  processes  including  training,  MIS,\nand  information,  education  and  communication  (IEC);  and  delays  in  project\nimplementation.  Smooth  flow  of  information  among  the  involved  international\nagencies is essential for optimal outcomes from project investments, during both\nproject design and implementation.\n\nPreproject \nthe  project\nimplementation  activities.  Early  establishment  of \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  and  provincial  PMUs  and  their  close  involvement  in\nproject  preparation  are  important  for  the  success  of  a  project.  It  is  beneficial  to\ntrain  senior  staff  in  competitive  bidding  and  project  implementation  procedures,\nbefore commencing project implementation.\n\nPMU staffing. It is important to have a critical pool of full-time staff for the PMU to\nensure  continuity  and  adequate  planning,  support,  and  supervision.  In  general,\nprojects  largely  staffed  by  contracted  personnel  and  headed  by  junior  officials\nhave not performed well.\n\nInvolvement  of  community  leaders.  The  quality  of  interventions  and  beneficiary\nownership  of  the  project  investments  are  better  when  community  leaders  are\ninvolved and consulted during planning and implementation.\n\nDecentralization.  Decentralization  of  appropriate  management  control  and\ndecision making by the PMU to the provinces increases operational efficiencies,\nboosts the morale of the provincial project teams, and reduces the management\nburdens of the central PMU.\n\nFlexibility  in  project  design.  Assessment  of  the  ongoing  ADB-funded  Population\nand Family Health Project highlights the need for keeping project design flexible.\nIn several communes with large populations, slightly different CHC designs were\nconsidered more appropriate. Similarly, centrally procured drugs, from a common\nlist of essential drugs were not found useful in many communes.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n52.\nADB\u2019s  strategic  objective  for  Viet  Nam  is  poverty  reduction  through  equitable  growth,\nwith  special  emphasis  on  rural  development.  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  emphasizes  that\nsupport  for  human  development  activities  should  focus  on  improving  the  quality  of  the  labor\nforce, including the health of disadvantaged groups. This approach recognizes that investments\nand  creation  of  an  appropriate  enabling  environment  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  health  sector  are  vital  for\nreducing  the  vulnerability  of  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  to  ill  health,  increasing  their\n\n\f12\n\nproductivity, and expanding their choices. The operational strategy also meshes well with ADB\u2019s\nrecently  adopted  poverty  reduction  strategy  based  on  the  three  pillars  of  (i)  pro-poor  growth,\n(ii) social  development  including  development  of  human  capital  through  investments  in  health\nand education, and (iii) good governance. The guiding principles for ADB activities in the health\nsector  are  elaborated  in  ADB\u2019s  health  sector  policy10  and  include  (i)  focus  on  improving  the\nhealth of the poor, women, children, and indigenous peoples; (ii) encouraging governments of\ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs)  to  take  an  appropriate  and  activist  role  in  the  health\nsector  including  increasing  public  investment  in  PHC  health  care,  facilitating  private  sector\ninvolvement  in  health,  and  increasing  the  focus  on  public  goods;  and  (iii)  assisting  DMC\ngovernments  in  strengthening  their  managerial  capacity  and  strengthening  linkages  with  other\nsectors.\n\nThese  strategic  considerations  are  generally  relevant  for  Viet  Nam.  Specifically,  a\n53.\nnumber of areas of concern have been instrumental in shaping ADB\u2019s health sector activities in\nViet  Nam,  including  (i)  deterioration  in  the  quality  of  publicly  provided  health  services;\n(ii) declining utilization of such services, particularly by disadvantaged groups including women\nand ethnic minorities; (iii) need for greater clarity on the government\u2019s role in the health sector;\n(iv) limited capacity for policy development and planning at the central level and need for skills\ndevelopment  at  the  provincial,  district,  and  commune  levels;  and  (v)  inadequate  integration  of\nthe implementation of health sector policies with policies in related sectors.\n\n54.\nGiven these needs and areas of concern, ADB\u2019s main objectives in the health sector in\nViet Nam are to (i) help revitalize the quality of commune-level health services; (ii) help improve\nutilization  rates,  especially  in  rural  areas,  with  better  targeting  of  women,  children,  and\ndisadvantaged  groups;  (iii)  encourage  shift  in  emphasis  of  public  spending  toward  preventive\nand primary health care; (iv) assist in repositioning the role of the government in the sector and\nstrengthen  public-private  partnership  in  health  while  ensuring  equitable  access  to  health  care;\n(v) provide support for health policy development, strategic planning, and investment planning;\nand  (vi)  improve  human  resources  in  the  health  sector.  In  the  family  planning  subsector,  the\nobjectives are to (i) increase coverage of family planning services with an expanded supply of\ncontraceptive devices and methods; (ii) promote an integrated approach linking family planning\nwith  public  health  programs;  (iii)  improve  and  expand  Viet  Nam\u2019s  IEC  capability;  and\n(iv) increase the involvement of the private sector.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nA  health  sector  review,11  supported  by  all  major  international  development  agencies,\n55.\nwas  recently  completed.  The  draft  report  shows  that  investments  to  upgrade  and  improve  the\nquality  of  health  facilities  at  district  and  commune  levels  will  benefit  the  poor.  Moreover,\nincreasing  the  utilization  of  DHCs  by  improving  the  quality  and  coverage  of  their  services  and\npromoting  community  participation  is  a  cost-effective  approach.  The  findings  from  the  draft\nreview formed the basis for policy dialogue with MOH. During project preparation, discussions\nwere held with senior officials from MOH and related ministries. In addition, a workshop of key\npolicy  makers  was  organized  to  discuss  the  issues  and  options  for  financing  health  sector\nprograms in Viet Nam. The following issues were discussed and actions agreed upon.\n\n                                                \n10 Asian Development Bank. 1999. Policy for the Health Sector.\n11 Ministry of Health. 1999. Viet Nam Health Sector Review.\n\n\f13\n\n1.\n\nHealth Care for the Poor\n\n56.\nThe Government is committed to improving the health status of the poor and increasing\ntheir  access  to  quality  health  services.  The  recently  introduced  policy  to  provide  free  health\ncards  to  4  million  poor  people  demonstrates  this  commitment.  However,  the  following  related\nissues need further urgent consideration:\n\na.\n\nCoverage for All Poor People\n\n57.\nThe free health card scheme covers 4 million people, whereas the total number of poor\nin  the  country  is  estimated  to  be  28  million  (37  percent  of  population),  with  the  extreme  poor\nnumbering an estimated 11 million (15 percent).12 The Government does not have the financial\ncapacity  to  cover  all  poor  people  through  the  health  card  scheme  at  present,  however,  it\nrecognizes  the  need  to  develop  and  test  various  modalities  for  subsidizing  health  care  for  the\npoor. Piloting a compulsory health insurance system is one option. The Government has agreed\nto  review  the  health  card  scheme  within  two  years  of  loan  effectiveness  and  will  introduce\nappropriate  revisions.  Using  the  review  as  basis,  the  Government  will  develop  options  for\nexpanding the free health card scheme to cover a wider segment of the poor population.\n\nb.\n\nSustainable Level of Premiums\n\n58.\nUnder the free health card scheme, the Government will pay a premium of D30,000 per\ncapita for providing health insurance to the poor. There are concerns that this premium may not\nbe sufficient to cover the costs of health care, especially after the scheme matures. The level of\npremium  will  need  to  be  constantly  reviewed  considering  costs  and  trends  in  health  service\nutilization  by  the  cardholders.  In  conjunction  with  the  review  of  the  health  card  scheme,  the\nGovernment  will  review  the  adequacy  of  the  premium  after  gaining  experience  from\nimplementation of the scheme.\n\nc.\n\nInformation Dissemination\n\n59.\nCurrently,  the  poor  lack  information  about  the  health  card  scheme.  Even  service\nproviders  are  not  fully  aware  of  the  details  of  the  scheme.  For  successful  implementation,  the\nGovernment  has  agreed  to  organize  communication  campaigns  to  disseminate  information\nabout the scheme to potential beneficiaries, community leaders, and service providers.\n\nd.\n\nReimbursement to CHCs\n\n60.\nMore than 90 percent of the poor live in rural communes, where they are most likely to\nuse commune-level health services. However, the health insurance structure currently does not\nreimburse health care services at the commune level. The health insurance system deals with\nhigher level health institutions, since it does not have sufficient administrative capacity to deal\nwith the large number of CHCs. Since the inability of health cardholders to obtain free services\nfrom CHCs will defeat the basic objective of the scheme, a more effective system needs to be\ndeveloped whereby CHCs are reimbursed for health care provided to the poor either on a fee-\nfor-service basis or capitation basis. Since reimbursing CHCs on a fee-for-service basis may not\nbe  administratively  feasible,  the  Government  will  consider  channeling  part  of  the  premium  to\nCHCs on a capitation basis to cover all the PHC costs. The Government has agreed to develop,\n\n                                                \n12 World Bank. 1999. Viet Nam Development Report 2000-Attacking Poverty. Washington, DC.\n\n\f14\n\nwithin  two  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  policy  guidelines  for  reimbursing  at  least  all  inter-\ncommune polyclinics for services provided to health cardholders.\n\n2.\n\nEssential Drugs\n\n61.\nAn adequate supply of drugs and medicines is key to improving the quality of services\nand  raising  utilization  rates.  Within  three  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will\nestablish revolving funds for essential drugs in all CHCs in the project area, where there is no\nlicensed drug store. This will ensure an adequate supply of good-quality drugs at the commune\nlevel. To regulate the irrational use of drugs, especially antibiotics, the Government will aim to\ndevelop,  implement,  and  enforce  a  new  drug  law  within  the  next  two  years,  which  will  include\ndetailed  regulations  on  prescriptions,  over-the-counter  sales,  and  division  of  medical  and\npharmaceutical practices.\n\n3.\n\nProject Sustainability\n\nThe  proposed  additional  investments  at  the  province  level  have  implications  for  the\n62.\noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  budget  for  health  facilities.  In  the  absence  of  a\ncorresponding  increase  in  the  budget,  the  project  investment  will  not  be  effective  in  improving\nquality,  and  service  delivery  and  project  results  will  not  be  sustained.  The  Government  has\nagreed to increase its health sector budget for the project provinces by 3 percent per annum in\nreal terms and the provincial governments have agreed to allocate sufficient budgets for O&M of\nhealth facilities.\n\n4.\n\nFood Safety\n\n63.\nChemical  contamination  and  food  adulteration  are  emerging  as  major  public  health\nproblems in Viet Nam. Among the communicable diseases, diarrheal diseases contribute to the\nsecond highest burden of disease, next to influenza. The Government fully realizes the need to\nstrengthen the policy framework for food safety and is committed to carry out policy reforms in\nthis  area.  The  Government  will  promulgate  an  ordinance  laying  down  the  standards  for  food\nsafety  and  establishing  procedures  and  role  and  responsibilities  at  different  levels  of\nadministration  for  ensuring  the  hygiene  and  safety  of  food  for  human  consumption.  ADB  is\nproviding  technical  assistance13  to  the  Government  to  build  the  capacity  for  implementing  the\nprovisions of the ordinance.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n64.\nDespite  impressive  achievements  in  the  health  sector,  health  status  and  the  use  of\nhealth  services  in  Viet  Nam  remain  much  poorer  in  rural  areas  than  in  urban  areas.  These\ninequities  are  even  more  stark  for  poor  and  remote  rural  areas  and  those  inhabited  by  ethnic\nminorities.  Women  suffer  the  most  from  such  inequities.  Evidence  shows  that  the  economic\ntransition  has  adversely  affected  the  ability  of  the  poor  to  seek  access  to  quality  health  care.\nMalnutrition,  especially  among  the  poor,  remains  a  challenge.  In  addition,  there  are  emerging\nhealth problems related to smoking, injuries through automobile accidents, and HIV/AIDS.\n\n                                                \n13 TA  3483-VIE:  Capacity Building for Prevention of Food-borne Diseases,  for  $500,000,  approved  on  29  August\n\n2000.\n\n\f15\n\n65.\nPoor health is both a cause and effect of poverty. Improving the health status of people,\nespecially women and children, in rural areas will contribute substantially to poverty reduction.\nHowever,  the  situation  will  require  interventions  that  address  both  demand-  and  supply-side\nconstraints. More appropriate and better quality health services need to be provided in the rural\nareas,  and  management  and  supervision  need  to  be  improved.  Financial  barriers  to  access\nmust  also  be  addressed  by  supporting  innovative  health  financing  mechanisms.  At  the  same\ntime, there is an urgent need to pay greater attention to prevention activities, generate demand\nfor services, and ensure greater community participation in the provision of services.\n\n66.\nAlthough many international agencies have contributed significantly to the health sector\nto  date,  there  is  still  a  substantial  financing  gap  in  the  coverage  of  the  PHC  sector  in  the\ncountry.  Several  provinces  require  large  investments  for  improving  health  infrastructure.  ADB,\nwith  the  support  of  UNICEF,  UNFPA,  and  WHO,  is  well-placed  to  supply  and  mobilize  both\nfinancial  and  technical  resources  to  fill  this  gap.  The  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s\npolicy to improve the health status of the poor, and is in line with ADB\u2019s overarching strategic\nobjective of poverty reduction. The Project is also in line with ADB\u2019s operational strategy for Viet\nNam, which emphasizes efficient economic growth with equity and poverty reduction.\n\n67.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  13  provinces  over  a  five-year  period.  The  project\nprovinces  have  a  population  of  15  million,  comprising  about  20  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  total.\nThe  project  provinces  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  (i)  financing  needs  and  absence  of  any\nlarge  externally  funded  project,  (ii)  poverty  incidence,  and  (iii)  health  care  needs.  All  have\nsubstantial financing needs for rehabilitating the PHC infrastructure. The project provinces have\na much larger proportion of the country\u2019s rural and poor population than the country as a whole.\nIn general, the health status of their people is among the poorest in the respective regions. The\ntotal  proportion  of  the  poor  in  the  project  area  is  49  percent  compared  to  a  proportion  of  37\npercent  in  the  country  as  a  whole.  The  Project  will  cover  1.4  million  of  the  ethnic  minority\npopulation.  Basic  information  about  the  project  provinces  and  the  selection  criteria  are  in\nAppendix 4.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nThe Project\u2019s goal is to improve the health status of the rural population, especially the\n\n68.\npoor and disadvantaged in 13 provinces. The specific objectives are to\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\npromote  access  to  quality  PHC  services\u2014with  special  emphasis  on  improving\nthe quality of health services for women and children, ethnic minority groups, and\nthe  poor\u2014by  upgrading  preventive  and  curative  health  structures,  basic\nequipment, and staff skills;\n\nstrengthen  overall  financial  management  by  facilitating  a  government  policy  to\nprovide  health  care  to  the  poor  and  developing  a  pilot  model  for  voluntary  rural\nhealth insurance;\n\nimprove  management  capacity  to  implement  PHC  programs  and  strengthen\nprevention programs at the provincial and district levels; and\n\nstrengthen community participation and support behavior change communication\n(BCC),  especially  focused  around  safe  motherhood,  child  survival,  nutrition,\nHIV/AIDS, injury prevention and smoking.\n\n\f16\n\n69.\nThe  Project  has  three  components.  The  components  and  subcomponents  were\ndesigned  in  a  participatory  manner  with  the  involvement  of  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders,\nincluding  potential  beneficiaries,  service  providers,  program  managers,  NGOs,  related\nministries,  and  international  agencies.  Several  meetings  and  workshops  were  organized  to\nobtain  feedback  on  the  Project  design.  An  ethnic  minority  plan  was  developed  under  ADB-\nfinanced  technical  assistance14  with  the  participation  of  representatives  from  ethnic  minorities.\nThe project components are described below.\n\n1.\n\nImproving Access and Quality of Care (Component A)\n\n70.\n\nThis component will focus on improving access to and quality of health care by\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\ndeveloping  and  mainstreaming  national  guidelines  for  integrated  and  quality\nhealth services,\nupgrading health care facilities and equipment, and\ntraining service providers.\n\na.\n\nGuidelines for Integrated and Quality Services (A.1)\n\nThe  Project  will  develop  integrated  care  guidelines  that  provide  a  comprehensive\n71.\nframework  for  improving  the  health  of  the  rural  population,  especially  that  of  children  and\nwomen,  through  prevention,  cure,  and  care.  The  integrated  approach  requires  health  service\nproviders to have a broader understanding of care and not simply of treating the specific present\ncondition. The purpose of the integrated care guidelines is to (a) give health workers technical\nguidance  on  how  to  provide  comprehensive  care  to  women  and  children;  and  (b) provide  a\nframework for design of services, and facilities and equipment needs.\n\nThe  guidelines  will  be  based  on  in-country  experience  gained  from  implementing  the\n72.\nMother-Baby  Package,  Integrated  Management  of  Childhood  Illness  strategies,  and  some\nadditional elements of reproductive health. A number of linkages with other parts of the health\nsystem  are  required  to  make  the  integrated  care  concept  work.  The  linkages  will  be  explicitly\ndefined  for  such  activities  as  referral  services,  training,  supervision,  planning  and  organizing,\ninformation, support and general management. The Project will also assist in developing quality\nstandards for each service element based on the integrated care guidelines. Quality standards\nwill be classified in relation to input (human and material resources and organization), process\n(the actual practice of delivering care or prevention strategies), and output (the direct end result\nof input and process). Key indicators for each quality standard will be finalized and monitored.\nThe  ongoing  TA  Capacity  Building  for  Rural  Health15  will  also  support  the  activities  in  this\nsubcomponent.\n\nb.\n\nUpgrading Health Facilities and Equipment (A.2)\n\nThe  Project  will  strengthen  CHCs,  ICPs,  DHCs  and  regional  hospitals16  in  the  13\n73.\nprovinces to increase access and improve the quality of services. The Project will finance (i) civil\nworks;  and  (ii)  medical  equipment,  furniture  and  essential  drugs  and  supplies  to  enable  the\n                                                \n14 TA 5794-REG: Study of the Health and Education Needs of Ethnic Minorities, for $800,000 approved on 30 June\n\n1998.\n\n15 TA 3337-VIE: Capacity Building for Rural Health, for $600,000 approved on 14 December 1999.\n16 Regional hospitals are upgraded DHCs in remote areas. They provide services similar to those of the DHCs, but\n\nhave larger capacity for both inpatient and outpatient services.\n\n\f17\n\ncenters to deliver the basic package of PHC. The Project will provide the inputs required to bring\neach facility up to the specified standard.\n\n74.\nCivil Works. The Project will upgrade or build approximately 99 ICPs, 74 DHCs, and 13\nregional  hospitals.  The  requirements  have  been  estimated  on  the  basis  of  detailed  surveys\nduring  project  preparation.  However,  the  Project  will  update  the  requirements  at  inception  to\naccount  for  potential  changes  due  to  conditions  including  the  creation  of  new  districts  and\ncommunes, unforeseen contingencies such as floods, and construction of some buildings from\nother sources. All civil works will be completed within the first two years of the Project, so that\nsubsequent  quality  improvement  measures  may  be  institutionalized  within  the  project  period.\nThe  criteria  for  upgrading  health  facilities  are  given  in  Appendix  5.  The  Government  has\nprovided  assurances  that  these  criteria  will  be  strictly  followed.  Also,  all  health  facilities\nupgraded under the Project will be adequately maintained during and after the life of the Project,\naccording to the agreed upon guidelines (Appendix 5).\n\n75.\nFor upgrading, the Project has carefully selected health facilities with good potential for\nbeing utilized. The Project may upgrade a small number of commune level health facilities in the\nproject  area,  primarily  located  in  remote  and  poor  areas,  although  its  main  focus  will  be  on\nupgrading DHCs, which function as the first level of referral and are more likely to be used by\nthe  poor.  At  the  district  level,  the  Project  will  strengthen  surgery,  emergency,  obstetrical  and\ngynecological  services,  and  diagnostic  activities.  The  Project  will  support  the  establishment  of\nregional  hospitals  in  each  province.  These  centers,  located  in  remote  areas,  will  provide\nadditional and specialized services for more than one district and will serve the poor and ethnic\nminorities.\n\n76.\nThe  designs  of  health  facilities  under  the  Project  will  conform  to  the  guidelines\ndeveloped by MOH and will be similar to those in similar externally aided projects. The designs\nwill  provide  adequate  visual  and  auditory  privacy  to  the  patients.  They  will  be  simple  and  use\nindigenous  materials  for  ease  in  local  maintenance.  All  facilities  will  have  adequate  medical\nwaste  disposal  units.  The  Project  will  not  cover  communes  under  the  Primary  Health  Care\nProject  funded  by  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  in  three\nprovinces.\n\n77.\nEquipment  and  Supplies.  The  Project  will  finance  medical  equipment,  furniture,  and\nsupplies at regional, district, commune and intercommune polyclinic levels. A standard package\nof inputs has been developed for all levels (Appendix 6). In addition, equipment will be supplied\nto village midwives and commune nurses. Procurement and supply of equipment will be closely\ncoordinated with civil works. The Project will ensure that health personnel are properly trained to\nuse the equipment and operational manuals are in Vietnamese. The Government has provided\nassurances  that  equipment  will  be  maintained  during  and  beyond  the  project  period  by\nadequate increases in O&M budgets.\n\n78.\nThe Government will finance the essential drugs and supplies through its own budget or\nthrough  grant  financing  from  UNICEF  or  other  international  agencies.  Revolving  funds  for\nessential  drugs  will  be  established  in  all  communes  of  the  13  provinces  where  there  are  no\nlicensed drug stores. The poor and disadvantaged will be exempted from user charges. These\nexemptions will be carefully monitored for proper targeting. The Government will appropriately\nreplenish  revolving  funds  that  get  depleted,  especially  in  communes  of  the  poor  and  ethnic\nminorities.\n\n\f18\n\nc.\n\nTraining of Health Service Providers (A.3)\n\n79.\nThe  Project  will  support  two  types  of  training  activities.  The  first  will  strengthen  the\ncommune  health  staff  by  training  more  than  5,500  workers  in  the  delivery  of  integrated  care.\nThe  second  will  upgrade  the  technical  skills  of  district  staff  by  training  about  500  doctors  and\n1,400  other  health  care  providers  working  at  DHCs.  Training  activities  will  focus  on  improving\ntechnical  skills  competency  in  medicine,  public  health,  and  service  quality  improvement  for\ncommune and district staff. Priority emphasis at the commune level is on learning to work with\nthe  community.  District  and  commune  staff  will  be  involved  as  partners  in  the  process  of\nlearning  to  work  more  effectively  with  the  community,  thereby  strengthening  an  important\nmanagement  linkage  between  the  two  levels.  WHO,  UNICEF,  and  UNFPA  will  support  the\ndevelopment of training modules and materials. Special training modules will be developed for\nservice providers working in ethnic minority areas. NGOs will be involved in training commune-\nlevel health workers. The Project will collaborate with the AusAID-funded Primary Health Care\nProject in three provinces.\n\nTraining  activities  cut  across  all  Project  components.  Sixteen  types  of  training  are\n80.\nenvisaged (details are in Appendix 7). Recognizing the need for greater coordination between\ntraining  activities  within  and  outside  the  Project,  each  province  will  prepare  an  annual  training\nplan.  The  annual  plans  will  take  into  account  the  training  needs  of  health  providers  in  the\nprovince  and  available  training  resources  in  terms  of  trainers,  facilities,  and  funds.  Special\nattention  will  be  paid  to  ensuring  proper  linkages  between  the  different  training  programs,\nfacilitating  appropriate  scheduling,  and  avoiding  overlaps.  The  plans  will  also  provide  for\nmonitoring and evaluation of the training programs.\n\n2.\n\nImproving Health System (Component B)\n\n81.\nThis component will increase the efficiency, equity, and sustainability of health services\nby  focusing  on  both  the  financing  and  management  aspects.  The  component  has  three\nsubcomponents:\n\na.\n\nHealth Financing (B.1)\n\n82.\nThe  financing  intervention  will  support  two  initiatives,  namely,  (i)  facilitating  the\nimplementation  of  the  health  cards  for  the  poor,  and  (ii)  piloting  the  development  of  a  more\nsustainable rural health insurance.\n\n83.\nThe  Government  has  decided  to  make  access  to  health  services  more  equitable  by\nproviding free health cards to the poor. The Project will assist the Government in implementing\nthe  scheme  by  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  Viet  Nam  Health  Insurance  Authority  (VHIA)\nand developing systems for effectively monitoring costs and use of services under the scheme.\nThe  Government  will  provide  free  health  cards  to  about  800,000  poor  people17  in  the  project\narea. The free health card scheme will increase the workload of VHIA by 30 percent. The health\ninsurance management information system (HIMIS) will be improved to ensure close monitoring\nof membership, costs, and reimbursements. The Project will also support studies to establish a\nsustainable  level  of  premiums  for  health  cards,  benefit  package,  appropriate  targeting\n\n                                                \n17 The  poor  people  will  be  selected  by  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids  and  Social  Affairs  based  on  criteria  in\nNotification  No.  1751/LDTBXH  dated  20  May  1997.  The  guidelines  are  based  on  household  income.  The  poor\nhouseholds  will  be  further  ranked  according  to  the  household  and  other  assets.  The  approximately  bottom  30\npercent of poor people will be eligible for free health cards.\n\n\f19\n\nmechanisms,  and  cost-effective  provider  payment  options.  This  subcomponent  will  be\nimplemented in collaboration with WHO, which will provide international consulting services and\nsupport capacity building for VHIA.\n\nThe Project will pilot voluntary rural health insurance initiatives in two communes each in\n84.\nNinh  Binh,  Quang  Binh,  Khanh  Hoa,  and  Long  An  provinces.  The  objective  is  to  develop\neffective and sustainable models for community health insurance in rural areas. The Project will\nsubsidize health insurance premiums on a declining level during the project period. It will also\nsupport marketing of the scheme to people in the communes during the first two years of pilot\nimplementation.  The  pilots  will  be  carefully  documented  and  monitored  to  facilitate  future\nreplication.  The  Project  will  support  the  timely  analysis  of  information  related  to  enrollments,\npremiums paid, services used, and expenditure.\n\nb.\n\nManagement (B.2)\n\n85.\nThis  subcomponent  will  strengthen  management  and  planning  capabilities  at  the\nprovincial,  district,  and  commune  levels.  A  series  of  training  workshops  will  be  organized  to\nupgrade planning and management skills at provincial and district levels with main emphasis on\nusing  financial  resources  efficiently  and  directing  services  to  priority  target  groups.  Provincial-\nlevel  management  training  will  focus  on  overall  planning  of  services  including  allocation  and\nefficient  use  of  resources  and  providing  technical  support  to  the  districts.  District-level  training\nwill focus on supervision and monitoring.\n\n86.\nRecognizing  the  need  for  information  for  planning  and  management,  the  Project  will\ninvest in improving the MIS. MOH is in the process of finalizing the software and detailed plans\nfor improved MIS in the country. A similar MIS will be implemented in the project area. It will be\nfully computerized at national, provincial, and district levels and linked through the Internet. The\nProject  will  support  the  costs  of  computers,  associated  software,  other  MIS  office  equipment,\nplanning  and  training  workshops,  and  development  of  a  homepage  for  each  province.  The\nProject  will  focus  on  improving  the  use  of  existing  information.  An  attempt  will  be  made  to\nensure  that  information  is  not  only  routinely  collected  but  adequately  analyzed  and  that  the\nresults of the analyses are shared at other levels within the organization.\n\n87.\nThe Project will support the MOH initiative in community-based monitoring (CBM) as a\ntool  to  involve  the  community  in  planning  and  improving  commune-level  services.  Pilot  CBM\nmodels  have  been  implemented  in  the  last  few  years  with  the  support  of  UNICEF.  MOH  has\ndeveloped guidelines to structure the involvement of communities in the activities of CHCs. The\nProject will replicate these models in collaboration with UNICEF, which will support development\nof prototype materials, training of key trainers, and monitoring and evaluation.\n\nThe Project will support policy studies to fill existing information gaps. Some areas that\n88.\nrequire more research include province-level information about burden of disease, malnutrition,\nabortion,  HIV/AIDS,  and  health  status  of  ethnic  minorities.  Areas  for  policy  research  will  be\nprioritized by provinces, and studies undertaken with the concurrence of ADB.\n\nc.\n\nProject Management (B.3)\n\n89.\nThe  Project  will  finance  necessary  equipment,  furniture,  and  consulting  services  for\neffective  implementation,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  project  activities.  A  domestic\nconsultant will be engaged to supervise surveys and studies for the midterm review and prepare\n\n\f20\n\na background report. A household health survey will be undertaken in the last year of the project\nperiod to assess the impact of the Project.\n\n3.\n\nStrengthening Prevention and Community Participation (Component C)\n\nThis component will strengthen the public health infrastructure\u2014especially that related to\n\n90.\nfood hygiene and BCC\u2014and community participation in the project area.\n\na.\n\nPreventive Care (C.1)\n\n91.\nThe Project will strengthen the capacity of the provincial preventive centers to ensure the\nsafety of food for public consumption. The Project will finance laboratories for preventive health\ncare including food testing, training for epidemiologists working in provincial preventive centers,\nand  development  of  policies  and  guidelines  for  routine  testing  of  food  items.  This  component\ndirectly responds to the urgent need for strict regulations for food safety.\n\nb.\n\nBehavior Change Communication (C.2)\n\n92.\nThis  subcomponent  will  (i)  strengthen  BCC  planning  and  management  capacity  at  the\nprovincial  and  district  levels,  and  (ii)  support  and  expand  BCC  programs  and  activities.  The\nobjective is to achieve improved health knowledge among the rural population and to facilitate\ncommunity participation in improving their own health status. BCC can improve access to and\nquality of care. It can enhance access by providing families with knowledge about the availability\nof services, and improve the quality of care by improving knowledge about when care may be\nrequired and emphasizing the importance of continuing care.\n\n93.\nThe  Project  will  build  the  planning  and  management  capacity  of  the  newly  established\nprovincial  health  education  centers.  The  Project  will  finance  communication  equipment  and\ntraining  at  provincial  and  district  levels  to  build  the  capacity  to  plan,  implement,  and  monitor\nBCC  activities  and  campaigns.  Counseling  and  interpersonal  communication  skills  of  health\ncare  providers  in  districts  and  communes  will  also  be  improved  by  training  and  providing\ndiscussion  aids,  such  as  flip  charts.  The  design  of  communication  material  will  pay  special\nattention  to  the  language  and  cultural  needs  of  ethnic  minorities.  Training  for  health  providers\nwill be part of the integrated care package and will be undertaken in collaboration with UNICEF\nand UNFPA. Health providers working in ethnic minority areas will be given specialized training,\nkeeping in view the special health conditions and cultural perceptions of modern medicine.\n\n94.\nEach  province  will  make  an  annual  BCC  plan  based  on  the  priority  health  problems  in\nthe  province.  The  Project  will  focus  on  these  areas:  (i)  malnutrition,  (ii)  reproductive  health,\n(iii) HIV/AIDS, (iv) prevention of accidents/injuries, and (v) awareness about the adverse effects\nof  smoking.  The  Project  will  finance  special  BCC  campaigns  focusing  on  the  priority  health\nissues.  The  campaigns  will  be  organized  in  partnership  with  the  Viet  Nam  Youth  Union,  Viet\nNam  Women\u2019s  Union,  and  NGOs.  The  BCC  plans  will  take  into  account  the  special\ncommunication needs and low reach and acceptability of media in the poor and ethnic minority\nareas, and will use local and culturally acceptable media channels and methods.\n\nc.\n\nVillage Health Workers (C.3)\n\nThe  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy  of  expanding  the  VHW  network  in\n95.\nremote and disadvantaged areas. VHWs play a key role in facilitating community involvement in\nthese areas since they live in the same village and share the same culture and language. VHWs\n\n\f21\n\nact as an effective link between the health system and the community. The Project aims to have\none  trained  VHW  in  each  remote  and  ethnic  minority  village  by  the  end  of  the  project  period.\nThe Project will train or retrain (if already identified) VHWs in communication skills, effective use\nof IEC material, and basic PHC messages. Selected subcontractors will conduct the courses for\nVHWs.  The  VHW  training  program  will  be  the  same  as  that  currently  used  by  provinces\nincorporating  the  new  activities  of  integrated  care  packages.  VHWs  will  play  a  key  role  in\nimplementing the BCC strategy.\n\nC.\n\nTechnical Justification\n\n96.\nThe  Project  takes  an  integrated  approach  focusing  on  both  supply-  and  demand-side\ninterventions. This approach ensures that improvements in the quality of services will proceed\nsimultaneously  with  improvements  in  supervision  and  management  of  services,  generation  of\ndemand for services, and improvements in affordability of services. Experience has shown that\nattention  to  only  supply-side  interventions  does  not  lead  to  increased  utilization  of  services  or\nhealth  improvements,  especially  by  the  poor  who  cannot  afford  services  to  begin  with  and  do\nnot often have sufficient knowledge about the availability of and need for using the services. The\nProject  will  focus  on  improving  the  quality  of  services  by  improving  facilities  and  the  skills  of\nhealth  care  providers.  At  the  same  time,  the  Project  will  improve  the  affordability  of  services\nthrough free health cards for the poor and generate demand for services through BCC activities.\n\n97.\nFor  both  efficiency  and  equity  reasons,  the  Project  supports  the  strengthening  of  PHC\ninfrastructure and public health services as opposed to secondary and tertiary levels of health\ncare.  PHC  interventions  have  been  found  to  be  one  of  the  most  cost-effective  strategies  for\nimproving health. Public subsidies for PHC facilities are much more equitably captured than are\nthose  for  provincial  and  central-level  hospitals.  Hence,  increasing  the  resources  for  PHC\nfacilities will also have more than a proportionate positive effect on the poor.\n\n98. Within PHC, the Project will focus on district hospitals with special emphasis on maternal\nand  child  health  services,  diagnostics,  surgery,  and  emergency  services.  The  health  sector\nreview  has  shown  that  increased  use  of  district  hospital  services  is  highly  cost-effective  since\nthe marginal returns outweigh the marginal costs. Moreover, district hospitals are a first level of\nreferral system in rural areas largely inhabited by the poor. Therefore, increased use of district\nhospitals will lead to both increased efficiency and better health care for the poor.\n\n99.\nThe  emphasis  on  maternal  and  child  health,  and  diagnostic,  surgical,  and  emergency\nservices  is  justified  on  the  ground  that  these  services  (i)  cover  most  diseases,  (ii)  benefit  the\nvulnerable  population  including  women  and  children,  (iii)  help  in  reorienting  the  system  for\nongoing epidemiological transition, and (iv) have positive externalities or are public goods. The\nBCC component will revolve around malnutrition, reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, prevention of\naccidents/injuries, and awareness of the adverse effects of smoking, which represent the major\nexisting and emerging challenges in the health sector in Viet Nam.\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n100.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  taxes  and\nduties  is  estimated  at  $98.7  million  equivalent.  Of  this  amount,  $26.7  million  equivalent,  or\n27 percent of total cost, is the foreign exchange cost, and $72.0 million equivalent, or 73 percent\nof total cost, is the local currency cost. A summary of the cost estimates is given in Table 1 and\ndetailed estimates are in Appendix 8.\n\n\f22\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nComponent\n\nA.\n\nImproving Access and Quality of\nCare\n\nB.\n\nImproving Health System\n\nC.

It is\n101.\nproposed that ADB provide a loan of $68.3 million equivalent from its Special Funds resources\nto finance 69.2 percent of the total project cost (Table 2). This covers $25.8 million of the foreign\nexchange  cost  (including  interest  on  loan)  and  $42.5  million  equivalent  in  the  local  currency\ncost,  or  59  percent  of  the  total  local  currency  cost.  ADB  financing  will  be  used  to  finance  a\nportion  of  the  costs  relating  to  civil  works,  procurement  of  vehicles,  medical  and  office\nequipment,  consulting  services,  training,  research,  and  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation,  but\nexcludes  costs  of  land,  salaries  of  regular  project  staff,  rental  of  office  space,  and  taxes  and\nduties. The term of the proposed loan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with\nan interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nthereafter.\n\n\f23\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nPercent\n\nADB\nUNICEF\nUNFPA\nWHO\nGovernment\nTotal\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  UNFPA  =  United  Nations  Population  Fund,  UNICEF=  United  Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund, WHO = World Health Organization.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\n69.2\n1.0\n0.5\n0.3\n29.0\n100.0\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n42.5\n0.5\n0.3\n0.1\n28.6\n72.0\n\nTotal\nCost\n68.3\n1.0\n0.5\n0.3\n28.6\n98.7\n\nForeign\nExchange\n25.8\n0.5\n0.2\n0.2\n0.0\n26.7\n\n102. WHO  will  support  implementation  of  the  health  insurance  component  by  providing\ninternational  consulting  services  and  capacity  building  for  VHIA.  UNFPA  will  support  training\nand BCC activities in three project provinces. UNICEF will support the implementation of CBM\nactivities and BCC activities. Support from UNFPA, UNICEF, and WHO will be on a grant basis.\n\nFinancing for the local currency cost is considered justified under ADB\u2019s local currency\n103.\nfinancing  policy.18  Viet  Nam  needs  a  large  investment  program  to  rehabilitate  and  upgrade\ndilapidated  physical  and  social  infrastructure.  The  need  to  generate  domestic  resources  to\nfinance  investments  for  sustaining  economic  growth  is  well  recognized.  However,  it  will  take\nsome time before the country can develop the necessary resource base to adequately finance\nthe required level of investment without external finance. Under current circumstances, a large\ninvestment-savings  gap  will  continue,  hindering  in  particular  programs  that  are  aimed  poverty\nreduction  and  human  development  with  a  large  local  currency  content.  Consistent  with  ADB\npolicy, a higher percentage of local cost financing for this poverty reduction project is justified.\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nProject Management Structure\n\n104. A  central  project  management  unit  (CPMU)  with  the  assistance  of  provincial  project\nmanagement  units  (PPMUs)  in  the  13  project  provinces  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day\nimplementation of the Project. The organizational structure of project management is shown in\nAppendix  9.  The  province  will  be  the  principal  unit  in  project  implementation,  while  the  CPMU\nwill provide technical, coordination, and logistics support. The CPMU will work under the overall\nguidance of a Project Steering Committee headed by the minister of health, or the vice-minister\nauthorized by the minister. The CPMU will be headed by a project director. It will have at least\nfour other full-time staff seconded from MOH and other contractual staff as needed to provide\nparticular technical expertise. Four technical groups dealing with (i) quality of services, (ii) health\ninsurance, (iii) health management and preventive health services, and (iv) BCC and community\nparticipation  will  support  the  CPMU  and  prepare  annual  action  plans  for  submission  to  the\nproject director.\n\n105.\nThe PPMU will work under the overall guidance of the vice-chairperson of the provincial\nPeople\u2019s Committee and will be headed by the director of provincial health services. The PPMU\n\n                                                \n18 R1-95: A Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditure on Projects, 3 January.\n\n\f24\n\nwill  have  at  least  two  full-time  staff  seconded  from  the  provincial  health  services  and  other\ncontractual staff as needed.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nThe Project will be implemented over five years beginning in 2001 and ending in 2006.\n\n106.\nThe implementation schedule is in Appendix 10.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\n107. All  ADB-financed  procurement  under  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  The  CPMU  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  carrying  out\nprocurement.  In  cases  where  procurement  is  done  by  PPMUs,  the  CPMU  will  ensure  that  the\nprocedure follows the ADB guidelines.\n\na. \n\nCivil Works\n\n108. Under  the  Project,  most  civil  works  will  consist  of  the  construction  of  structures  for\nDHCs, ICPs, regional hospitals, preventive health centers, and health education units. None of\nthe civil works will exceed $500,000. To allow for adequate supervision of construction, and due\nto  the  geographically  dispersed  locations  of  these  structures,  packages  for  all  health  units  will\nneed to be limited to less than 20 each. Due to the small and scattered nature of the facilities to\nbe constructed, it is unlikely that the civil works will attract foreign bidders. Hence, it is proposed\nthat local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB be employed for these structures.\nTo  rationalize  design  and  construction  specifications,  detailed  survey  and  design  activities  will\nbe required prior to tendering to assure that the facilities are appropriate for the population being\nserved and the level of service to be provided.\n\nb. \n\nEquipment and Materials\n\n109. Medical  equipment  and  supply  packages  for  DHCs,  ICPs,  regional  hospitals,  CHCs,\npreventive  health  centers,  and  health  education  units  will  be  procured  under  international\ncompetitive  bidding  if  the  package  exceeds  $500,000.  Packages  for  equipment  costing  less\nthan  $500,000  will  be  procured  using  international  shopping,  and  those  costing  less  than\n$100,000,  through  direct  purchase.  The  CPMU  and  PPMUs  will  procure  office  equipment  and\nvehicles  under  international  shopping  or  direct  purchase.  Office  furniture,  motorcycles,  and\nbicycles  will  be  purchased  using  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  or  direct  purchase.  To\nachieve  economy  and  efficiency,  goods  of  similar  nature  will  be  grouped  into  packages  under\none  or  more  tenders.  Contracts  may  be  awarded  on  a  package  basis,  or  on  a  least-cost\ncombination of packages basis.\n\nc.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n110. One international (8 person-months) and 98 domestic consultants (522 person-months)\nwill  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other\narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants\nwill  (i)  prepare  and  adapt  integrated  care  guidelines  and  quality  of  care  guidelines\n(1 international and 2 domestic); (ii) prepare training modules for district and commune service\nproviders  (12  domestic,  including  3  for  ethnic  minority  areas);  (iii)  undertake  feasibility  studies\nfor the rural health insurance pilots, design health insurance cards, develop the health insurance\nmanagement  information  system,  and  develop  training  programs  for  health  insurance  officials\n\n\f25\n\n(10  domestic);  (iv)  develop  training  modules  and  materials  for  management  training  for\nprovincial and district officials (10 domestic); (v) prepare and adapt guidelines for BCC planning\nand  implementation  and  develop  training  modules  and  materials  for  training  BCC  officials  (3\ndomestic);  and  (vi)  support  VHWs  (5  domestic).  In  addition,  domestic  consultants  will  be\nrecruited  for  (i)  survey  and  design  of  health  facilities  (31  domestic);  (ii)  training  health  staff  in\nusing  MIS  (4  domestic);  (iii) undertaking  the  household  survey  and  analyzing  data  to  evaluate\nthe  impact  of  the  Project  (15  domestic);  and  (iv)  preparing  guidelines  for  bidding  and\nprocurement  of  equipment  (6 domestic).  This  level  of  consulting  services  is  the  minimum\nrequired to effectively carry out the Project. Consulting services requirements and brief terms of\nreference are outlined in Appendix 11.\n\n4.\n\nAdvance Action\n\n111. MOH will take advance action to expedite project implementation. In particular, MOH will\n(i) issue a ministerial decree establishing the CPMU and PPMUs; (ii) shortlist firms to carry out\nengineering design and construction supervision; (iii) shortlist individual consultants for technical\nassignments  in  the  project;  and  (iv) develop  the  roles,  structure,  and  functions  of  CPMU  and\nPPMUs.\n\n5.\n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\n112. Expenditures  for  procurement  contracts  and  other  payments  larger  than  $50,000\nequivalent  will  utilize  direct  payment  and  commitment  procedures  for  withdrawing  loan  funds.\nExpenditures  valued  at  $50,000  or  less  will  utilize  statement-of-expenditure  procedures.\nDisbursement  will  follow  the  detailed  guidelines  established  in  interministerial  circular  number\n81. An imprest account will be established within three months of loan effectiveness. It will be\nliquidated and replenished according to the procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.\nADB  will  reimburse  the  imprest  account  following  the  procedure  in  the  Loan Disbursement\nHandbook. Second-generation  imprest  accounts  will  be  opened  in  all  provinces.  They  will  be\nreimbursed  by  the  central  account  on  submission  of  full  supporting  documents  for  the\nexpenditure.\n\n6.\n\nAccounts and Auditing\n\n113.\nThe Government, acting through MOH, will maintain records and accounts adequate to\nidentify  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds.  The  CPMU  will  (i)  maintain\nseparate  accounts  for  the  Project;  (ii)  ensure  accounts  and  financial  statements  are  audited\nannually, in accordance with sound accounting principles, by auditors acceptable to ADB; and\n(iii) submit to ADB, not later than 12 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified copies\nof audited accounts and financial statements, and the auditor\u2019s report on them.\n\n7.\n\nReporting\n\n114.\nThe  CPMU  will  prepare  project  progress  reports  every  six  months  and  submit  them  to\nADB  within  six  weeks  after  the  end  of  the  semi-annual  period.  The  reports  will  be  in  a  format\nacceptable  to  ADB,  and  will  include  (i)  progress  made  against  established  targets,  including\naspects  of  quality;  (ii)  delays  and  problems  encountered,  and  actions  taken  to  resolve  issues;\n(iii) compliance with loan covenants; (iv) proposed program of activities to be undertaken during\nthe next six months; (v) expected progress during the succeeding period; and (vi) maintenance\nand  repair  activities  undertaken  on  the  health  facilities.  Within  three  months  of  physical\n\n\f26\n\ncompletion of the Project, the Government will prepare and submit to ADB a project completion\nreport on the execution of the Project, including costs and compliance with the loan covenants.\n\n8.\n\nMidterm Review of the Project\n\n115. While  the  Project  will  be  continuously  reviewed,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  also\njointly undertake a midterm review during the third year of implementation. The midterm review\nwill (i) review the scope, design, implementation arrangements, and other relevant issues in light\nof  the  Government\u2019s  development  strategies  and  the  policy  framework  and  strategic  social\nconcerns  of  ADB;  (ii)  examine  progress  toward  achieving  the  measurable  objectives  of  the\nProject;  (iii)  identify  changes  since  the  time  of  appraisal  relating  to  sector  issues,  resource\nmanagement  and  allocation,  etc.,  and  reassess  their  impact  with  regard  to  future  project\nimplementation and sustainability; (iv) assess implementation performance against appropriate\nprojections;  (v)  review  and  establish  compliance  with  various  loan  covenants;  (vi)  identify\nproblems  and  constraints;  and  (vii)  formulate  appropriate  recommendations  for  corrective\naction.\n\n9.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation System\n\n116.\nIn accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation, the Project\nhas  selected  a  short  list  of  verifiable  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  (Appendix  12).\nBaseline values for these indicators will be estimated using data from the national health survey\nbeing undertaken in 2000. The final values of the indicators will be estimated from data from a\nhousehold survey planned under the Project in 2005.\n\n117. Analysis of the verifiable indicators will be disaggregated by income, sex, and ethnicity.\nThe  analysis  will  include  non-Project  areas  to  allow  comparison.  The  Project  will  monitor  the\nenvironmental  impact  of  the  interventions  by  monitoring  waste  disposal  and  by  checking  the\nwater  quality  of  randomly  selected  wells  near  the  regional  hospitals  constructed  under  the\nProject. An independent firm under the supervision of MOH will carry out the final evaluation of\nthe  Project.  The  Executing  Agency  will  collect  data  but  analysis  and  reporting  will  be  the\nresponsibility  of  the  independent  firm.  The  evaluation  will  be  financed  with  proceeds  from  the\nloan.  For  benefit  monitoring,  the  CPMU  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  data  collection,\nanalysis, and reporting to all interested parties, including ADB. Delivery of services to recipients,\nuse of services by recipients, and effects of services will be monitored through regular reports\nand routine data collected through the health MIS. Focus group discussion with beneficiaries will\nbe carried out at midterm and at the end of the Project.\n\nG.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\nThe  MOH  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  MOH  has  gained  useful  experience  in  project\n118.\nimplementation from the existing National Health Support Project supported by the World Bank.\nNevertheless,  MOH\u2019s  implementation  capacity  needs  to  be  strengthened,  especially  at  the\nprovincial level. ADB is separately providing capacity building TA to improve the management\nand  financing  of  health  services.  The  Project  also  includes  interventions  to  strengthen\nmanagement capacity at central and provincial levels.\n\n\f27\n\nH.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\nThe Project will have no significant adverse environmental effect. Most civil works entail\n119.\nrehabilitation  of  existing  structures.  The  location  of  all  new  facilities  and  the  design  and\nconstruction of all project facilities will cause minimal disturbance to the environment and natural\nresources.  Optimal  use  of  local  materials,  natural  light,  and  natural  ventilation  will  be\nconsidered.  Handling  of  refuse  and  measures  for  disposing  of  hazardous  medical  waste,  e.g.,\nsyringes  and  needles,  will  be  specifically  addressed  in  the  design  and  operation  of  the  health\ncenters.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\n120.\nForty nine percent of the population in the project area is poor and 10 percent belong to\nethnic minorities. The health status of these groups is significantly poorer than that of the better-\noff, urban, and ethnic majority (Kinh) communities, and is heavily influenced by communicable\nand  infectious  diseases,  and  morbidity  and  mortality  associated  with  childbearing.  During  the\nproject preparation phase, communities were consulted to identify their health priorities and the\nbarriers that they face in seeking access to health services. Feedback from them was factored\ninto the project design to ensure that the poor and disadvantaged will adequately benefit from\nthe Project and actively participate in its implementation. The Project expects no negative social\nimpact such as that caused by land acquisition and resettlement. New structures will be built on\ngovernment land with existing health facilities.\n\na.\n\nPoverty\n\n121. Poverty incidence19 within the project area is 49 percent compared with 37 percent in the\ncountry.  Poverty  and  health  status  are  closely  associated  (Appendix  13  gives  a  detailed\ndiscussion). The occurrence of illness\u2014leading to loss of labor resources and significant costs\nfor curative health care and associated expenditure\u2014is reportedly one of the prominent causes\nof poverty. While the poor suffer from the heaviest disease burden, they are also less likely to\nseek  health  care.  They  also  use  poorer  quality  service  providers  than  the  nonpoor.  The  main\nreasons  for  the  poor\u2019s  lower  utilization  of  health  care  services  are  (i) poor  access  to  quality\nservices,  (ii)  unaffordability  of  such  services,  (iii)  lack  of  knowledge  about  the  need  for  and\navailability  of  services,  (iv)  less \nthan  encouraging  attitude  of  service  providers,  and\n(v) inadequate insurance coverage.\n\n122.\nThe  project  design  specifically  addresses  the  constraints  often  faced  by  the  poor  in\nseeking  health  care  services.  First,  the  Project  will  improve  access  to  quality  services  in  poor\nareas.  Second,  it  will  support  free  health  card  schemes  for  the  poor,  thereby  improving  the\naffordability of services. Third, under the BCC component, the Project will generate a demand\nfor  health  services,  especially  among  the  poor.  Fourth,  training  of  health  care  providers  will\nfocus not only on technical areas but also on the interpersonal communication skills to reduce\nthe social distance between them and their clients. Fifth, the Project will assist the Government\nin developing models for comprehensive health insurance, which would be helpful in providing\ninsurance coverage to all including the poor. Finally, the Project encourages participation of the\npoor in management of health services through CBM and VHWs.\n\n                                                \n19 The  poverty  line  in  Viet  Nam  is  defined  as  the  minimum  per  capita  expenditure  required  in  consuming  2,100\ncalories and corresponding nonfood items. The poverty line was estimated to be $128 per capita per year in 1998.\n\n\f28\n\nb.\n\nGender\n\n123.\nIn  all  subcomponents,  the  Project  will  target  women  and  girls,  who  will  comprise  the\nmajority  of  the  project  beneficiaries.  Rural  women,  especially  those  of  ethnic  minority  groups,\nare  most  affected  by  poverty,  as  they  bear  a  disproportionate  burden  of  coping  with  daily\nhardships due to their multiple roles in both productive and reproductive areas. They engage in\nheavy daily tasks for long hours, often at the cost of their own health. As women perceive the\nopportunity cost of using health services to be high, it is essential to bring health services closer\nto  them  through  improved  service  quality  and,  where  possible,  reduced  costs,  as  well  as  to\nattract  them  closer  to  services  by  generating  demand.  The  Project  will  address  poor  women\u2019s\nneeds through all subcomponents, especially:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nimproved  maternal  and  child  care  services  based  on  the  integrated  care\napproach and extended by better trained health staff; and\n\nspecial counseling services for women as part of the BCC subcomponent, which\nwill  enable  women  to  deal  with  sensitive  health  issues  including  reproductive\nhealth and domestic violence.\n\nFurthermore, the community participation efforts of the Project will emphasize the role of\n124.\nwomen  in  planning  and  using  community  health  services,  in  collaboration  with  the  Viet  Nam\nWomen\u2019s Union. Children will also benefit through the improved health services and improved\nhealth status and knowledge of mothers. The Viet Nam Youth Union will be engaged to facilitate\ncommune activities to strengthen the preventive programs.\n\nc.\n\nEthnic Minorities\n\n125. Some  project  provinces,  especially  those  in  the  northern  highlands  and  central  region,\nhave  a  significant  number  of  ethnic  minorities  (e.g.,  69  percent  in  Hoa  Binh).  The  ethnic\nminorities are the most challenging of all target groups, due to their general poverty, difficulties\nin  reaching  them,  lack  of  health  awareness  combined  with  high  illiteracy  rate,  and,  in  many\ncases, health services that do not address their culturally sensitive needs. Therefore, the Ethnic\nMinorities Development Plan (EMDP) was prepared in accordance with ADB policy and will be\nimplemented as part of the Project (Appendix 14).\n\n126. Under  the  EMDP,  the  health  needs  and  concerns  of  the  ethnic  minorities  were\nmainstreamed  through  training  for  district  and  commune  health  staff  and  VHWs  and  CBM.  In\naddition,  special  activities  are  planned  for  implementation:  training  traditional  birth  attendants,\npreparing of an ethnic minorities health handbook, establishing commune-level herbal gardens,\nand translating IEC materials into ethnic languages, where possible. Much of the ethnic minority\npopulation  will  also  benefit  from  the  health  cards  for  the  poor,  given  the  high  incidence  of\npoverty  among  them.  To  monitor  the  project  implementation,  communities  will  be  heavily\ninvolved and external assistance will be sought through NGOs, where necessary.\n\nd.\n\nCommunity Participation\n\n127. Community participation is a key strategy of the Project, given that the effectiveness of\nhealth programs, especially maternal and child health, reproductive health, and preventive care,\ndepends on the capacity of communities to address their specific needs and absorb improved\nhealth services. Through the CBM scheme developed by UNICEF, communities will be involved\n\n\f29\n\nin  planning,  implementing,  and  monitoring  commune-level  health  services.  Under  CBM,\ncommunity  representatives  will  consolidate  community  perceptions  of  the  quality  of  health\nservices,  monitor  behavior  changes  among  community  members,  and  provide  feedback  to\ncommune  health  staff  and  VHWs.  The  expansion  of  the  VHW  network  will  also  encourage\ncommunity participation through their monthly household visit. The CBM and VHW network are\nespecially  important  among  ethnic  minority  communities,  many  of  whom  are  difficult  to  reach.\nWherever  possible,  the  Project  will  work  closely  with  NGOs  and  mass  organizations  (i.e.,\nWomen\u2019s  Union  and  Youth  Union)  in  training  commune-level  health  workers  and  VHWs,\nmonitoring the implementation of the EMDP, and CBM.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nProject Benefits\n\n128.\nThere is a strong justification for investments proposed under the Project, both on equity\nand efficiency grounds (Appendix 15). In particular, the Project is justified on the following basis:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe Project supports the government in taking a proactive stance on issues that\nexhibit  significant  market  failure  or  strongly  positive  externalities  or  both.  There\nare  compelling  reasons  for  an  active  role  for  the  Government  on  these  issues,\nsince left to normal market forces, investment in these interventions will be less\nthan  optimal.  The  project  intervention  related  to  food  safety  and  prevention  of\ncommunicable diseases will have strong positive externalities, because the social\nbenefits  of  the  interventions  far  outweigh  the  private  benefits.  Therefore,  the\nprivate sector does not have sufficient incentive to invest in these interventions.\nSimilarly, the Project focuses on issues known to have significant market failure,\nsuch  as  health  insurance,  catastrophic  illnesses  and  information  asymmetry\nbetween  the  health  care  providers  and  patients.  In  the  absence  of  active\ngovernment  interventions,  the  market  outcomes  on  these  issues  will  be  non-\noptimal.\n\nThe Project will improve access to quality health services for 12.7 million people,\nthereby  improving  their  health  status.  Improving  the  health  status  will  lead  to\nsubstantial  economic  gains  in  terms  of  improved  productivity,  better  returns  on\ninvestment in children, and savings in the direct and opportunity cost of treating\nprevented  illnesses.  For  example,  in  1997/98  the  economic  cost  of  people\u2019s\nillness in terms of foregone earnings in Viet Nam was estimated to be about 8.7\npercent  of  GDP.20  In  addition,  the  total  expenditure  on  health  care  amounts  to\nabout  $400  million  every  year.  Even  a  10  percent  reduction  in  sickness  in  the\nproject provinces will translate into an additional annual productivity gain of $50\nmillion. It will also mean a saving of $40 million in the direct cost of health care,\nand much more if the indirect costs are included.\n\n(iii) \n\nThe  proposed  interventions  are  among  the  most  cost-effective  ones  available,\nsuch as health education, reproductive health care, and immunization. The Project\nwill  yield  improvement  in  health  status  at  a  relatively  low  cost,  estimated  at\nbetween  $12  and  $24  per  DALY  saved.  Interventions  costing  below  $100  per\nDALY saved are considered to have high cost-effectiveness.\n\n                                                \n20  Ministry of Health. 1999. Viet Nam Health Sector Review.\n\n\f30\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  current  health  system  is  already  in  place  in  the  form  of  buildings,  staff,  and\nland, but is seriously underutilized. A modest investment for improving quality and\ngenerating  demand  is  expected  to  substantially  increase  utilization,  and  thereby\nimprove efficiency. Econometric analysis in the Health Sector Review shows that\ndistrict  hospitals  have  short-  and  long-run  economies  of  scale.  The  results  imply\nthat there will be gains from expanding the output at district hospitals.\n\nFinally,  the  Project  will  provide  long-term  benefits  by  strengthening  the  health\nsystem in terms of (a) developing and mainstreaming integrated care guidelines,\n(b) improving management and supervision of health services, (c) more rational\nand  equitable  health  financing,  (d)  improving  policies  and  capacity  for  food\nsafety, and (e) better capacity for planning and organizing BCC activities.\n\nB.\n\nPoverty Reduction\n\nThe  Project  was  designed  as  a  core  poverty  project  and  will  meet  the  health  needs  of\n129.\nthe  remote  rural  poor  and  ethnic  minorities  (detailed  discussion  in  Appendix  13).  While  the\nProject aims to provide curative and preventive health services to all segments of the population\nin  the  project  provinces,  the  majority  of  the  beneficiaries  will  be  the  poor.  Interventions\nsupported  by  the  Project  will  be  targeted  toward  the  poor  as  a  result  of  the  specific  design\nfeatures  and  through  self-selection.  The  Project  has  also  been  designed  to  benefit  women.\nWomen will constitute the majority of project beneficiaries, and there are specific interventions\naimed at improving their health.\n\n130. Self  Targeting.  Poverty  incidence  in  the  project  area  is  49  percent  compared  with  the\ncountrywide  incidence  of  37  percent.  Because  of  this,  the  Project  will  yield  more  than\nproportionate  benefits  for  the  poor.  In  addition,  almost  all  the  project  interventions  target  the\npoor. For example, the Project focuses on maternal and child health. Since the poor in Viet Nam\nhave higher fertility rates than the non-poor the majority of pregnant women, mothers of young\nchildren (aged one and under) and children (aged five and under) are poor. Interventions aimed\nat mothers and children will provide proportionately greater benefits to the poor. More than 70\npercent  of  malnourished  children  are  poor.  Therefore,  interventions  aimed  at  reducing\nmalnutrition  will  have  poor  beneficiaries  as  the  majority.  Another  example  is  smoking  and\ntobacco  use.  The  BCC  campaign  to  reduce  tobacco  use  will  have  the  poor  as  major\nbeneficiaries.\n\n131. Design Features. The Project has special features to specifically target the poor and will\nreduce poverty in several ways. First, it will focus on improving access to quality health services\nin remote areas, which will reduce the travel and opportunity costs of seeking health services.\nSecond,  it  will  support  the  government  scheme  to  provide  free  health  cards  to  800,000  poor\npersons, in effect reducing the financial barriers to their use of services. Third, the Project will\nsupport  interventions  to  cure  and  prevent  catastrophic  and  prolonged  illnesses,  which  make\npeople  vulnerable  to  poverty.  Some  of  these  health  conditions  are  accidents  and  injuries,\nHIV/AIDS, TB and cancers. They not only have devastating and irreversible adverse impacts on\nthe poor, but also drag the nonpoor into deep poverty. Finally, the Project will assist the poor by\nhelping to create a financially sustainable, rural-based social health insurance program.\n\n\fC.\n\nSustainability\n\n31\n\n132.\n Since the Project entails a large investment to expand the availability and improve the\nquality  of  health  service  provision  in  13  provinces,  care  has  been  taken  to  ensure  that  the\ninvestments  are  sustained  during  and  after  the  project  period.  Most  of  the  additional  health\nfacilities will be provided at the district level by rehabilitating the existing DHCs or by enhancing\nthe supply of diagnostic or treatment-related equipment. Some project design features that will\nensure  sustainability  include  the  following:  (i)  wherever  possible,  existing  facilities  will  be\nrenovated  rather  than  new  facilities  constructed;  (ii)  civil  works,  including  renovation,  will  be\ndesigned  to  minimize  maintenance  costs;  (iii)  only  technologically  appropriate  and  locally\nserviceable equipment will be procured; (iv) maintenance programs and schedules for facilities\nand  equipment  will  be  developed  and  carefully  monitored;  and  (v)  the  Project  will  involve\ncommunities  in  implementation,  which  will  ensure  community  ownership,  supervision,  and\noptimal use of the facilities.\n\n133. An analysis of likely scenarios relating to investment costs and estimated recurrent costs\nwas conducted. The results show that under all realistic scenarios, the project provinces will be\nable to obtain the necessary resources to finance the recurrent costs (Appendix 15). Financing\nfor the recurrent costs associated with the project investments will be met through the following\nsources:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nUser  charges.  Historical  trends  show  that  hospital  revenue  from  user  charges\nhas increased at a compounded rate of 14 percent from 1991 to 1994 and at a\nrate of 40 percent between 1994 and 1997. Presently, user charges account for\nmore  than  a  third  of  total  hospital  expenditure.  It  is  estimated  that  about  30\npercent  of  the  incremental  recurrent  costs  related  to  project  investments  will  be\nmet through this source.\n\nHealth insurance. Hospital revenues from health insurance reimbursements have\nincreased  by  an  annual  rate  of  more  than  30  percent  during  1994  and  1998.\nEven  with  a  conservative  projection  of  future  growth  in  these  revenues,  health\ninsurance is estimated to account for more than 20 percent of hospital revenues\nin the next 10 years.\n\nFree  health  cards.  The  new  scheme  of  free  health  cards  for  the  poor  will  yield\nadditional  funds  for  the  health  system.  Under  the  scheme,  the  Government  will\nprovide a subsidy of D30,000 for each health cardholder. This will contribute an\nadditional  $1.5  million  for  financing  recurrent  costs  every  year  in  the  13  project\nprovinces.\n\nGovernment budget. It was assumed that government budgets would continue to\nincrease by an annual rate of 3 percent in real terms over the next 10 years. In\nview  of  the  fact  that  provincial  health  budgets  had  increased  by  more  than  12\npercent  in  real  terms  during  the  period  1991-1997,  this  assumption  is  on  the\nconservative side.\n\nD.\n\nRisks\n\nThe  project  interventions  involve  very  little  technical  risk.  The  technologies  and\n134.\ntechniques  for  providing  effective  PHC  are  well-understood  and  well-tested.  Viet  Nam\u2019s\nexperience  in  the  sector  is  long  and  highly  successful,  demonstrating  both  implementation\n\n\f32\n\nability and sustained commitment. The major risk to the Project arises from the macroeconomic\nconditions.  Sustainability  of  project  investments  is  contingent  on  the  provision  of  Government\nbudgets for the health sector. Although the Government has been able to increase health sector\nbudgets in the past, its ability to do so in the future critically depends on the macroeconomic and\nfiscal situation. Any future economic downturn will be a potential risk for the Project.\n\n135.\nThe  other  project-related  risk  is  the  possible  implementation  delays  caused  by\n(i) inefficient  project  management  structure,  disbursement  procedures,  and  fund  flow  system;\nand  (ii)  inefficient  procurement  procedures  for  civil  works,  drugs,  medical  equipment  and\nsupplies,  and  consulting  services.  The  risk  of  delays  in  implementation  has  been  minimized\nthrough (i) training of CPMU and PPMU officials in procurement and disbursement procedures\nand  project  management;  (ii) a  decentralized  project  management  structure  that  shifts  the\nresponsibility and authority from the central level to the provinces where essential activities such\nas training and supervision will be implemented; and (iii) procurement units of sufficient size at\nthe central and regional levels, staffed by qualified consultants using streamlined procurement\nprocedures.\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n136.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nMOH will ensure that, within six months of loan signing, the project management\nstructures will have been fully staffed in accordance with agreements reached at\nappraisal.\n\nMOH  will  make  data  from  the  national  health  survey  available  to  the  CPMU  for\nanalysis as soon as possible after completion of the survey. Baseline and target\nvalues  of  the  project  indicators  will  be  established  within  one  year  of  loan\neffectiveness.\n\n(iii)  Within  three  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  MOH  will  establish  revolving  funds  for\ndrugs in all rural communes in the 13 provinces, where there is no licensed drug\nstore.\n\n(iv) \n\nThe  provinces  will  ensure  that  the  provincial  health  sector  budget  will  be\nincreased  at  least  by  3  percent  in  real  terms  during  the  project  period  and  that\nthey  allocate  sufficient  O&M  budget  funds  for  the  proposed  facilities  and\nequipment.\n\n(v)  Within two years from loan effectiveness, MOH will complete its ongoing review\nof  the  existing  drug  policy  and  submit  the  draft  Drug  Law  to  the  National\nAssembly for approval.\n\n(vi)  Within  six  months  from  loan  effectiveness,  MOH  will  submit  to  ADB  for  review\ndraft national regulations for regional hospitals and after taking into account the\ncomments of ADB, adopt the regulations within one year from loan effectiveness.\n\n\f33\n\n(vii)  Within  two  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  develop  policy\nguidelines  to  reimburse  all  intercommune  polyclinics  for  services  to  the  health\ncardholders.\n\n(viii)  After  two  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  review  and  revise,  if\nappropriate and necessary, the scheme of health cards for the poor. The review\nwill  assess  the  operational  issues  of  the  scheme  including  the  targeting,\neffectiveness, and appropriateness of premium levels.\n\n(ix)  Within  two  years  from  loan  effectiveness,  MOH  will  review  the  existing\nmechanisms  for  cost-recovery  exemptions  for  the  poor,  and  after  taking  into\naccount  ADB\u2019s  views,  take  the  necessary  legal  and  administrative  steps  to\nensure that such mechanisms are implemented more effectively.\n\n(x)  Within  three  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  submit  a  draft\nhealth care policy to ADB for review. The draft policy will address, among other\nthings,  improving  access  to  and  the  cost  of  public  health  services  to  the  rural\npoor.  Within four years of the effective date, the Government will have finalized\nthe policy.\n\n(xi)  Within  one  year  from  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  submit  a  draft\nordinance (the ordinance) specifying standards and procedures for ensuring food\nsafety to the National Assembly for approval.\n\n(xii)  Within  one  year  after  the  approval  of  the  ordinance,  MOH  will  develop\nimplementation  guidelines  and  an  action  plan  for  improving  the  capacity  to\nenforce laws on food safety.\n\nVII.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n137.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  52,354,000  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Rural  Health\nProject, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge\nat  the  rate  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those\nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\n6 October 2000\n\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n\n\f34\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber Title\n\nProject Framework\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\nOrganization  Structure  of  Health  System  in  Viet\nNam\n\nExternal Assistance to the Health Sector\n\nCriteria  for  Selecting  the  Project  Area  and  Details\non the Provinces\n\nDetails of Civil Works\n\nIndicative List of Equipment\n\nIndicative List of Training Activities\n\nCost Estimates\n\nProject Management Structure\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nSummary of Consulting Services\n\nBME Indicators\n\nPoverty Analysis\n\nSummary Ethnic Minorities Development Plan\n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIX\n(available on request)\n\nA\n\nEthnic Minority Development Plan\n\n1, 2\n\n3, 12\n\n10, 45\n\n15, 67\n\n17, 74\n\n17, 77\n\n18, 80\n\n21, 100\n\n23, 104\n\n24, 106\n\n25, 110\n\n26, 116\n\n27, 121\n\n28, 125\n\n29, 128\n\n\f35\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nDesign Summary\n\nProject Targets\n(Verifiable Indicators)\n\nMonitoring\nMechanisms\n\nAssumptions\n\n1.

The level of external funding for Binh Phuoc and Hoa Binh is double the average per\ncapita rate for the project provinces. Support in both provinces includes a large malaria project.\nExcluding this project, the rate for Binh Phuoc is $3.90, and that for Hoa Binh is $3.36. With this\nadjustment, 8 of the 13 provinces over the period 1990-1998 had a per capita external funding\nof around $3-4. Clearly, Tien Giang and Vinh Phuc were at the lower end of external funding.\n\n\f41\n\nAppendix 4, page 1\n\nCRITERIA FOR SELECTING THE PROJECT AREA\nAND DETAILS ON THE PROVINCES\n\nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  health  status  of  the  population  in  the\n1.\npoorest areas of the country and to provide experience on health development measures that\nmay  be  applied  throughout  the  country.

Thirty-nine provinces are already\ncovered by other major projects, namely, the Population and Family Health Project, supported\nby  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  World  Bank,  the  World  Bank-supported  National  Health\nSupport Project, and the European Union-supported Health Project. These projects are already\nproviding support similar to that envisaged under the present Project.\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\nOf  the  remaining  provinces,  the  neediest  and  the  poorest  were  selected.  Table  A4\n3.\nshows  that  these  provinces  have  greater  needs  than  the  country  as  a  whole.    All  the  project\nprovinces  have  a  proportionately  larger  rural  population  than  does  the  country  as  a  whole.\nQuang Ninh and Khanh Hoa show a high urban percentage because of the larger than average\nprovincial  capitals  in  the  two  provinces.  The  average  GDP/capita  is  lower  than  the  national\naverage. Again the large city populations in Quang Ninh and Khanh Hoa provinces distort the\naverage  for  these  two  areas.  However,  the  estimated  income  levels  in  rural  areas  of  the  two\nprovinces  are  significantly  lower  than  the  national  average.  The  southern  provinces  would\nappear to be much better-off or nearly on par with national economic conditions; however, these\ndata are not corrected for a cost-of-living adjustment for higher prices in the south.\n\n4.\nThree  provinces\u2014Ben  Tre,  Long  An  and  Quang  Ngai\u2014are  covered  by  the  Australian\nAgency  for  International  Development-supported  Primary  Health  Care  project.    However,  this\nproject  does  not  cover  all  communes  and  all  health  areas.  The  proposed  Project  will  provide\ncomplementary  investments  and  focus  on  the  remaining  communes  and  uncovered  health\nareas in these three provinces.\n\n5.\nThe  proportion  of  communes  without  doctors  clearly  shows  that  most  of  the  project\nprovinces  are  below  the  national  average  in  the  level  of  rural  resources  for  health.  The  most\nsignificant  indicator  of  need  and  overall  development  status  relative  to  a  national  norm  is\nreflected in the 1992/93 indicator of rate of GDP growth minus population growth. This indicator\nreflects whether an area is developing at or below its ability to keep up with population growth.\nAs shown for the country as a whole, economic development significantly exceeded the growth\nin  population.  However,  for  the  project  provinces  this  indicator  would  reflect  that,  with  the\nexception  of  three,  the  provinces  are  still  struggling  with  their  overall  economic  development.\nHoa  Binh  and  Quang  Binh  are  not  only  at  a  lower  base  than  the  country  as  a  whole  but  are\ndropping further behind their neighboring provinces. The three provinces that are exceptions to\nthe rest of the project provinces are all starting from a low base.\n\n6.\nTable A4 further shows the status of the project provinces in relation to the government's\ncriterion  for  communes  with  needs  for  special  development  assistance.  The  government  has\nidentified 1,715 communes in the country that meet this criterion. The project provinces include\n249 (14.5 percent) of the communes that are considered the most needy in the country.\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 5, page 1\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nDETAILS OF CIVIL WORKS\n\nThe primary objective of the Project is to improve access and increase the quality of care\n1.\nfor  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  in  rural  areas  of  the  project  provinces.  One  aspect  of  the\nstrategy  to  achieve  this  objective  is  to  improve  the  physical  appearance,  functional  capability,\nand  hygienic  conditions  of  the  health  facilities,  especially  at  the  district  level.  The  civil  works\nactivity will upgrade health facilities in the commune health centers, intercommune polyclinics,\nand district health centers to support the achievement of the project objective.\n\nThe  Project  will  support  upgrading  of  new  or  existing  facilities  based  on  the  following\n\n2.\nguidelines:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nthe design is based on support for a health service need such as improving the\nefficiency  of  services,  improving  the  quality  of  care,  or  increasing  equity  of\nutilization of care;\nthe design will be financially viable; and\nthe design is based on a change in service structure that will yield effectiveness\nand efficiency improvements, such as with a new regional district center.\n\n3.\nEach  facility  upgrading  plan  prepared  by  the  province  will  show  how  the  civil  works\ndesign  addresses  the  above  general  criteria  and  meets  the  following  specific  criteria  for  each\ntype of facility.\n\nB.\n\nIntercommune Polyclinics\n\nIntercommune  polyclinics  will  be  strengthened  in  technical  areas,  based  on  needs\n\n4.\ncommon to a number of commune health centers such as:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nneed  for  field  supervision  where  effectiveness  depends  on  coverage  of  more\nthan one commune,\nneed for laboratory and other diagnostic facilities that require higher volumes of\nwork for cost efficiency,\nneed  for  relatively  intensive  medical  services  to  manage  infectious  and\ncommunicable disease as well as for higher level competencies in maternal and\nchild health care, and\nneed  for  better  emergency  care  capabilities  for  management  of  common\ndiseases and facilities for patient transport.\n\nInvestment  in  civil  works  will  be  targeted  to  support  new  equipment  and  improved\n5.\nhygienic conditions for the above functions, normally through modification of existing spaces. A\nwhole diagnostic and treatment block may be built if the design meets the general criteria noted\nabove for civil works not to exceed 150 square meters. Additional civil works may be considered\nbeyond  the  basic  model  for  polyclinics  in  mountainous  areas  and  those  most  remote  from\nreferral  centers.  The  polyclinic  will  have  10-15  beds  with  supporting  equipment  based  on  the\nabove functions. A new polyclinic may be constructed when rehabilitation would cost 60 percent\nor more of a new facility.\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 5, page 2\n\nC.\n\nDistrict Health Center and Regional Hospital\n\nDistrict  health  centers  will  be  a  priority  facility  for  civil  works  upgrading  and  will  be\n\n6.\nstrengthened with regard to the following technical and managerial capabilities:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nimproving  field  supervision  (technical  and  managerial)  for  commune  health\ncenters and polyclinics in its area;\nproviding  laboratory  and  diagnostic  services  to  support  health  conditions  in  its\narea;\nproviding  medical  and  surgical  services \nfor  managing  care  of  persons\nhospitalized  for  infectious  and  communicable  diseases,  as  well  as  higher\ncompetencies in maternal and child health care; and\nproviding emergency care for common conditions in the area.\n\n7.\nInvestment in civil works will be targeted to support the district health centers technical\nand  management  capabilities  for  public  health  operations.  District  clinical  capabilities  as  a\nhospital may be improved primarily because credible and effective leadership and supervision in\npreventive  care  are  more  effective  when  provided  in  tandem  with  reliable  and  quality  curative\ncare.  Investment  will  be  made  to  support  new  equipment  and  improve  hygienic  conditions  for\nthe  above  functions,  normally  through  modification  of  existing  space.  A  whole  diagnostic  and\ntreatment block not to exceed 1000 square meters, may be built if the design meets the general\ncivil  works  criteria  noted  above.  Renovations  may  be  required  for  proper  X-ray,  laboratory,\noperating,  delivery,  centered  sterible  obstetrics  and  gynecological  services  and  emergency\nrooms.  A  district  center  will  not  be  considered  for  civil  works  if  it  is  within  30  minutes\u2019  normal\ntravel time of a provincial hospital.\n\n8.\nSpecial investment consideration will be given to district center proposals that are part of\na provincial regional district plan including the rationalization of current services, reducing some\nservices or providing for new services to meet a changing burden of disease in the community.\nDistrict  hospitals,  called  regional  hospitals,  will  be  located  in  remote  areas  (at  least  2  hours\u2019\ntravel  time  from  the  provincial  health  centers).  The  investment  for  the  facility  will  be  similar  to\nthat  for  district  health  center,  but  with  a  larger  capacity  of  up  to  150  beds.  The  size  of  the\nbuilding including the diagnostics, treatment, and inpatient facilities will not exceed 4,000 square\nmeters.\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 6, page 1\n\nINDICATIVE LIST OF EQUIPMENT\n\nA.\n\nCommune Health Center\n\nNo.\n\nItem\n\nQty\n\nNo.\n\nItem\n\nQty\n\n1. \n2. \n\n3. \n4. \n\nAspirator nasal infant size 30ml\nBag  hot  water  and  ice  combination  2  liters\nrubber\nBath baby oval 25 liters polyethylene\nCupboard for drugs and instruments\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n5. \n6. \n7. \n8. \n9. \n10.

While living conditions in Viet Nam have been improving during the\n1.\n1990s,  a  significant  proportion  of  the  country\u2019s  population  remains  poor.  A  recent  World  Bank\nstudy1 on poverty in Viet Nam reports that the population living below the poverty line dropped\nfrom  58  percent  in  1993  to  37  percent  in  1998.  While  Viet  Nam\u2019s  achievements  in  poverty\nreduction are impressive, the gains remain fragile. A significant number of the poor positioned a\nlittle below the poverty line in 1993 improved their living conditions to cross the poverty line and\nwere  clustered  just  above  the  poverty  line.  A  relatively  small  deterioration  in  their  living\nstandards\u2014triggered by community-wide, household or individual crises\u2014would be sufficient to\npush them below the poverty line again.\n\n2.\nCharacteristics  of  the  Poor.  Poverty  in  Viet  Nam  is  closely  linked  to  access  to\neconomic opportunities, education levels, and ethnicity. Poverty is largely a rural phenomenon,\nwith 90 percent of the poor living in rural areas and about 45 percent of rural people living below\nthe  poverty  line.  The  income  differential  between  rural  and  urban  areas  is  significant  and\nwidening.  In  1998,  the  median  household  income  in  rural  areas  amounted  to  D2.3  million,\nwhereas  in  urban  areas  it  was  D5.1  million,  more  than  2  times  larger.  Not  surprisingly,\neducational status is one of the important determinants of poverty. In 1998, 57 percent of those\nwithout any education were poor, whereas only 25 percent of those who had attained an upper\nsecondary  education  were  poor.  Among  the  more  educated,  the  percentage  of  the  poor  was\neven lower (4 percent among university graduates). Poverty is concentrated among small-scale\nagriculturists  or  those  who  are  unemployed.  Finally,  over  half  (51  percent)  of  the  poor  live  in\nmountainous or isolated areas of either the north or central highlands or the north coast regions.\nThese are the areas of the country where most of the ethnic minorities reside.\n\nB.\n\nHealth Status and Poverty\n\n3.\nPoverty  and  health  status  are  closely  associated  in  Viet  Nam.  The  occurrence  of\nillness\u2014leading  to  loss  of  labor  resources  and  significant  costs  for  curative  health  care  and\nassociated  expenditure\u2014is  reportedly  one  of  the  prominent  causes  of  poverty.  Studies  show\nthat once a household loses an adult member to sickness or disability, income levels suddenly\ndrop  and  the  household  slides  into  poverty.  Most  of  the  poor  are  self-employed  in  small\nbusiness  or  agriculture,  or  depend  on  daily  wages.  Unlike  people  with  fixed  salaries,  the  self-\nemployed poor find the opportunity cost of sickness and treatment a heavy burden. The direct\ncost of treatment has in fact grown tremendously during the period after doi moi (transition from\nthe centrally planned economy to the market economy).\n\nWhile  sickness  and  ill  health  lead  to  poverty,  health  indicators  for  the  poor  tend  to  be\n4.\nworse than those for the nonpoor. Some selected health indicators (Table A13.1) demonstrate\nthis link. The burden of disease\u2014as measured by the disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost\nper  thousand  people\u2014among  the  poorest  rural  young  children  is  more  than  27  times  the  rate\nexperienced by those in urban areas. For the entire population, the poor rural population has a\nfourfold greater disease burden than do urban dwellers.\n\n                                                          \n1 World  Bank.  1999.

Washington D.C.: World Bank.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\nMalnutrition among children less than 4 years is nearly three times greater for the rural\n5.\npoor  than  for  urban  dwellers.  Tobacco  use\u2014an  indicator  of  future  chronic  health  problem\u2014is\ngreater  among  the  poor  than  among  the  nonpoor.  For  example,  about  58  percent  men  in  the\npoorest  quintile  use  tobacco  products  compared  with  43  percent  in  the  richest  quintile.  The\naverage duration of illness restricting normal activity is greater among the poor than among to\nthe well-off\u201417.5 percent greater in rural areas and 33 percent in urban areas.\n\n6.\nIn  1998,  the  infant  mortality  rate  (IMR)  among  the  rural  poor  areas  of  the  Project  was\nnearly  54  percent  greater  than  that  in  all  rural  areas  and  fourfold  greater  than  that  in  urban\nareas. In part, this difference reflects the relative availability of MCH services. Similarly, in the\nmid-1990s, life expectancy was over 10 years longer in the more urban and relatively affluent\nRed River Delta region (70.8 years) than that in the poorer and mountainous central highlands\n(60.5 years).\n\nTable A13.1: Health Status and Poverty\n\nHealth Indicator\n\nUrban\n\nRural\n\nRural Poor\n\n1.

They use poorer quality service providers compared with the nonpoor. Table A13.2\nshows  that  the  affluent  seek  health  care  services  45  percent  more  frequently  than  do  the\npoorest group. If contacts with drug vendors are excluded, this difference is further magnified.\nThe affluent seek care nearly twice as often as the poorest (4.6 times compared with 2.4 times\nper person per year).\n\n8.\nWhen sick, the poor often do not seek any health care, mainly due to the large direct and\nindirect costs. More than 30 percent of poor people in the project area reported that they did not\nseek health care when they last fell sick. When they did seek services, it was often from drug\nvendors and commune health centers, whereas the affluent went more often to public hospitals\nand private physician clinics. The personnel in health facilities where the poor tend to seek care\nare usually less trained and less capable of providing high-quality service. Hospital use is highly\nskewed toward the affluent, with the admission rate nearly twice as high for the affluent as for\nthe  poorest  group.  The  affluent  also  tend  to  have  longer  hospital  stays,  in  part  due  to  their\nhigher health insurance coverage.\n\na. 0-4 years\nb. 15-44 years\nc. 65+ years\n\nTotal\n\n(weight < 2.5 kg)\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 13, page 3\n\nTable A13.2: Health Service Use in Viet Nam,\n\nby Expenditure Quintile, 1998\n\nHealth Service Use Indicator\nPer Capita Contacts with All Providers\nPer Capita Health Service Contacts (excluding\nDrug Vendors)\n\nShare of Contacts at Public Hospitals\nShare of Contacts at Commune Health Centers\nShare of Contacts at Private Clinics\nShare of Visits to Drug Vendors\n\nInpatient Admission Rate/1,000 person/year\nAverage Length of Stay\n\nPoorest\n7.9\n2.4\n\nSecond\n10.5\n3.2\n\nThird\n11.3\n3.8\n\nFourth\n10.6\n3.7\n\nRichest\n11.4\n4.6\n\n3.2\n7.4\n15.8\n69.3\n\n33.9\n10.3\n\n3.8\n6.8\n15.4\n69.7\n\n43.5\n10.9\n\n4.6\n6.9\n22.8\n66.6\n\n49.3\n13.9\n\n7.2\n5.6\n18.5\n64.8\n\n61.9\n14.6\n\n9.6\n1.7\n24.2\n59.4\n\n63.3\n18.8\n\nD.\n\nHealth Financing by the Poor and the Nonpoor\n\nNot only are the poor less healthy, seek care less frequently from health care providers\n9.\nand from poorer quality providers, they also spend considerable sums on the health care they\ndo use. This is partly because a smaller proportion of the poor have health insurance coverage\ncompared with the nonpoor (Table A13.3). Although, the poor spend a smaller amount on health\ncare,  the  expense  is  much  more  onerous  for  they  pay  a  larger  share  of  their  nonfood\nexpenditure for health care. Even a single contact with the public hospital represents as much\nas 22 percent of the annual nonfood expenditure for a person from the poorest quintile. Health\ninsurance coverage is also the lowest among the poorest groups\u2014with 1 in 20 covered in the\npoorest group as opposed to about 1 in 3 for the affluent. To assist the poor in gaining better\nfinancial  access  to  health  care,  their  health  insurance  coverage  needs  to  be  significantly\nincreased.\n\nTable A13.3: Fees, Relative Cost of Selected Health Services, and Health Insurance\nCoverage of the Poor and the Affluent in Viet Nam, 1998\n\nIndicator\nPer Capita Expenditure (D\u2018000)\nShare of Nonfood Expenditure per Contact\nat Public Hospital (%)\nShare of Persons with Health Insurance\n(%)\nShare of rural population with health\ninsurance (%)\n\nPoorest\n1.219\n\n    22.0\n\n6.2\n\n5.8\n\nConsumption Quintile\nThird\n2.251\n\nSecond\n1.767\n\nFourth\n3.073\n\n21.8\n\n9.5\n\n9.3\n\n17.6\n\n13.5\n\n11.8\n\n12.2\n\n18.9\n\n16.4\n\nRichest\n6.259\n4.6\n\n28.7\n\n19.5\n\nE.\n\nProject Assistance to the Poor\n\n10.\nThe Project will be implemented in 13 provinces, where 49 percent of the population are\npoor  compared  with  the  countrywide  poverty  incidence  of  37  percent.  Because  of  the  high\nincidence  of  poverty  in  the  project  provinces,  the  Project  will  provide  more  than  proportionate\nbenefits  to the poor. In addition, almost all the project interventions will self-target the poor. The\nmajority of the project beneficiaries will be poor. The Project has special features to assist the\npoor and has been designed to reduce poverty by (i) improving access to health services for the\npoor, (ii) improving the affordability of health services to the poor, (iii) investing in health issues\nthat disproportionately affect the poor, (iv) investing in prevention of health conditions that make\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 13, page 4\n\nthe  people  vulnerable  to  poverty,  and  (v)  developing  model  approaches  for  comprehensive\nhealth insurance.\n\n11.\nImproving  Access.  The  Project  will  seek  to  enhance  the  health  status  of  the  poor  by\nimproving services and ensuring that these are more accessible. The poor tend to live in more\nremote  areas.  They  are  also  typically  self-employed  in  small  business  enterprises  or  work  for\ndaily  wages.  By  reducing  geographic  distances  to  better  health  facilities  at  the  commune,\nintercommune,  and  district  levels,  the  project  will  mainly  benefit  the  poor  whose  travel  and\nopportunity costs in seeking health care will be reduced.\n\n12.\nIncreasing  Affordability.  The  Project  will  support  the  government  scheme  to  provide\nfree health cards to the poor, which will benefit them by reducing the financial barriers to their\nuse  of  services.  The  approximately  800,000  free  health  cardholders  in  the  project  area  will\ndirectly benefit from the project interventions.\n\n13.\nSupporting Health Issues Affecting the Poor. The Project will improve the quality of\nspecific  health  care  services,  including  those  related  to  maternal  and  child  health  and\ndiagnostics. In addition, the Project will focus on malnutrition, smoking, and reproductive health\nin its behavior change communication component. All these interventions will provide more than\nproportionate  benefits  to  the  poor,  since  they  are  more  likely  to  be  affected  by  these  health\nconditions. For example, more than 50 percent of children and pregnant women in the project\narea are poor. The majority of beneficiaries from intervention for reproductive health or maternal\nand child health services are likely to be poor. Similarly, more than 70 percent of malnourished\nchildren are poor and the majority of tobacco users are poor. Clearly, interventions focusing on\nthese issues will be pro-poor.\n\n14.\nPrevention. Catastrophic and prolonged illnesses have been found to drag households\ninto  poverty.  Some  of  these  health  conditions  are  accidents  and  injuries,  HIV/AIDS,2\ntuberculosis,  and  cancers.  Project  interventions  for  emergency  services,  surgery,  and\ndiagnostics  will  assist  in  providing  timely  care  for  accident-related  and  other  emergency\nconditions  and  in  timely  identification  and  cure  of  long-term  illnesses.  At  the  same  time,  the\nbehavior  change  communication  component  of  the  Project  will  assist  in  preventing  HIV/AIDS\nand injuries. These interventions will prevent the poor from becoming further marginalized, and\nthe nonpoor from sliding into poverty.\n\n15.\nHealth  Insurance.  The  Project  will  assist  the  poor  by  helping  to  create  a  financially\nsustainable rural-based social health insurance program, which over time might be extended to\nother  parts  of  the  country.  This  new  social  health  insurance  program  will  eventually  cover  all\nrural  families,  regardless  of  economic  status.  It  will  be  partly  financed  in  the  short  term  by\nsupport from the Project as well as from a number of other sources, including public subsides\nfrom  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  other  ministries,  and  from  the  community.  The  targeted\nsubsidies  from  the  project  will  facilitate  the  development  of  a  sustainable  health  insurance\nmechanism through which the poor would gain access to the health care services they need to\nmaintain and improve health status.\n\n                                                          \n2 human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 14, page 1\n\nSUMMARY ETHNIC MINORITIES DEVELOPMENT PLAN1\n\nA.\n\nSocioeconomic Profile of Ethnic Minority Groups\n\nThe  objective  of  the  Ethnic  Minority  Development  Plan  (EMDP)  is  to  ensure  that  the\n1. \nethnic minority population, especially women and children, in the 13 project provinces will have\nequal  access  to  health  benefits  and  community  participation  opportunities  provided  by  the\nProject.  In  general,  ethnic  minority  groups,  especially  those  in  rural  remote  and  mountainous\nareas,  are  among  the  most  disadvantaged  subgroups  of  Vietnamese  society.  Their  access  to\neconomic resources and social services, and their capacity to absorb opportunities, are limited.\nPoverty  incidence  among  them  is  75  percent,  much  higher  than  the  national  average  of  37\npercent.2  Social  indicators  show  stark  gaps  between  the  ethnic  minorities  and  the  national\naverage. According to the 1997 Demographic and Health Survey, the percentage of women of\nreproductive  age  without  formal  education  was  27.7  percent  among  ethnic  minorities,  much\nhigher than 2.0 percent for the urban population and 6.4 percent for the rural population. This\nfinding  has  the  prevailing  major  implications  for  the  health  status  of  family  members.  These\nwomen are also far more disadvantaged in terms of their access to socioeconomic infrastructure\nand services.\n\n2.\nThere  are  53  ethnic  minority  groups  in  Viet  Nam,  comprising  around  13  percent  of  the\ntotal  national  population.  The  main  groups  are  Tay  (1.8  percent),  Thai  (1.5  percent),  Hoa  (1.4\npercent), Khmer (1.3 percent), Muong (1.3 percent), and Nung (1.1 percent); they make up two\nthirds  of  the  total  ethnic  minority  population.  Among  the  13  project  provinces,  3  have  high\nconcentrations  of  ethnic  minority  groups:  northern  highlands  (Hoa  Binh,  Phu  Tho,  and  Quang\nNinh), Quang Ngai Province in central coast region, and Binh Phuoc Province in the southeast\nregion (see Table A14).\n\n3.\nThe main ethnic minority groups in the northern mountainous project provinces are the\nMuong, Thai, Tay, Dao, and San Diu. Most of them belong to the Austrasiatic linguistic family,\nincluding the Viet-Muong linguistic group (e.g., Muong, Viet), H\u2019mong-Dao linguistic group (e.g.,\nH\u2019mong,  Dao),  and  Tay-Thai  linguistic  group  (e.g.  Tay,  Thai,  Nung  San  Chay).  The  San  Diu\nbelongs to the Chinese-descendent Han linguistic group together with the Hoa. The most typical\ncharacteristic  of  the  ethnic  groups  in  the  northern  mountainous  provinces  is  their  mixed\nresidence across ethnic groups, although topography determines a general locational pattern for\neach  group.  While  there  are  employment  opportunities  in  mining,  hydroelectric  power  plants,\nand  forestry  enterprises  in  some  of  the  northern  mountainous  provinces,  the  ethnic  minorities\ndepend mainly on subsistence agriculture (rice and other food crops) and small-scale livestock\nraising, with some engaging in shifting cultivation. In some places, they also grow fruit crops or\nmedicinal herbs.\n\nThe main ethnic minority groups in the central coastal project provinces are the Hre, Co,\n4.\nand  Ra  Glai.  The  Hre  and  Co  belong  to  the  Mon-Khmer  linguistic  group,  while  the  Ra  Glai\nbelong to the Malayo-Polynesian linguistic family. These groups are concentrated in the western\nhighlands  of  the  provinces,  which  are  difficult  to  access.  Unlike  the  northern  mountains  ethnic\nminorities, the central ethnic minority groups tend to live in separate communities. The majority\nof  them  practice  shifting  agriculture  and  have  a  very  low  socioeconomic  status.  Their  location\n\n                                                          \n1 The  plan  was  originally  prepared  as  part  of  a  regional  technical  assistance-A  Study  of  the  Health  and  Education\n\nNeeds of Ethnic Minorities in the Greater Mekong Subregion (TA 5794).\n\n2  Viet Nam Living Standards Survey (1997-1998).\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 14, page 2\n\nand nature of their primary economic activity make their access to health, education, and other\nsocial services very difficult.\n\nTable A14: Major Ethnic Minority Groups in Project Provinces, by Geographic Region\n\nPopulation\n(\u2018000)\n\nEthnic Minority Population\n\n\u2018000\n\nMajor Ethnic Minority Groups\n\n Region,\n Province\nNorthern Highlands\n Hoa Binh\n\n Phu Tho\n Vinh Phuc\n Quang Ninh\nRed River Delta\n Ninh Binh\nNorth Central Coast\n Quang Binh\nCentral Coast\n Quang Ngai\n Khanh Hoa\nSoutheast\n Binh Phuoc\n\nMekong River Delta\n Long An\n Tien Giang\n Ben Tre\n Can Tho\n\nTotal\n\nrounding.\n\n770\n\n1,283\n1,085\n938\n\n906\n\n806\n\n1,234\n994\n\n549\n\n1,300\n1,726\n1,394\n1,905\n14,890\n\n531\n\n172\n31\n101\n\n115\n\n18\n\n133\n44\n\n88\n\n4\n10\n9\n66\n1,322\n\n%a\n\n68.9\n\n13.4\n2.8\n11.7\n\n1.7\n\n1.7\n\n10.8\n4.5\n\n16.0\n\n0.3\n0.6\n0.7\n3.5\n8.9\n\nMuong (60.3%), Thai (3.9%), Tay (2.6%), Dao\n(1.6%)\nMuong (12.2%), Dao (0.8%)\nSan Diu (2.5%), San Chay (0.1%)\nDao (4.5%), Tay (2.8%), San Diu (1.8%)\n\nMuong (1.7%)\n\nBru-Van Kieu (1.2%)\n\nHre (8.3%), Co (1.2%)\nRa Glai (3.2%), Hoa (0.6%)\n\nHoa (0.3%)\nHoa (0.5%)\nHoa (0.6%)\nKho Me (1.8%), Hoa (1.7%)\n\nStieng  (10.9%),  Kho  Me  (2.3%),  M\u2019nong\n(1.2%)\n\na Percentage is not necessarily equal to the population percentage calculated by the figures presented here, due to\n\nSource: The Committee for Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Area, 1997.\n\n5.\nLiving  on  the  border  with  Cambodia,  the  majority  of  the  ethnic  minority  groups  in  Binh\nPhuoc  Province  in  the  Southeast  belong  to  the  Mon-Khmer  linguistic  group,  including  the\nStieng, Kho Mu and M\u2019nong. These groups engage mainly in subsistence or shifting agriculture.\nSome (especially the Stieng) have had to adjust to the modern lifestyle that the migrating Kinh\nhave brought in.\n\nB.\n\nHealth Status of Ethnic Minority Groups in the Project Provinces\n\n6.\nThe  health  status  of  the  ethnic  minorities  is  the  most  challenging  among  all  the  target\ngroups,  due  to  their  general  poverty,  difficulties  in  outreach,  their  lack  of  awareness  combined\nwith high illiteracy rates, and, in many cases, health services that do not address their culturally\nsensitive  needs  and  constraints.  Their  most  common  health  problems  leading  to  morbidity  and\nmortality are communicable diseases (e.g., malaria, goiter, helminthiasis), nutritional deficiency,\nand  poor  perinatal  and  maternal  conditions.  Women  of  reproductive  age  bear  the  heaviest\nburden  of  diseases.  The  estimated  maternal  mortality  among  ethnic  minorities  is  four  times\nhigher than the national average of 160-200 per 100,000 live births, and some data show even\nhigher  figures  for  some  ethnic  groups  (e.g.,  1,080  for  Stieng  in  Binh  Phuoc  Province).\nReproductive  health  problems  are  common  among  ethnic  minority  women.  Their  contraceptive\nprevalence  rate  is  lower  than  the  national  average.  Among  children,  those  under  five  years  of\nage  bear  the  heaviest  burden  of  ill  health.  Infant  mortality,  child  malnutrition,  respiratory\ninfections,  and  prevalence  of  diarrhea  are  all  higher  among  ethnic  minority  groups  than  the\nnational average.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 14, page 3\n\n7.\nIn  general,  the  health  needs  of  ethnic  minority  groups,  especially  women  and  children,\nare for more affordable, closer, and better quality services. However, there is wide variation in\nhealth seeking behavior between ethnic groups and even within the same group, depending on\ntheir  economic  status,  the  severity  of  the  disease,  distance  to  health  care  services,  level  of\nhealth  and  hygiene  awareness,  and  culture  and  religious  beliefs.    The  utilization  level  of  both\ntraditional  and  modern  medicine  also  varies.  A  case-by-base  approach  is  required  to  tackle\nsuch  diverse  needs.  In  addition,  since  these  target  groups  belong  to  the  low  and  very  low\nsocioeconomic  strata,  they  are  inevitably  preoccupied  with  the  immediate  needs  of  improving\nincome, and family health care is given lower priority. Therefore, raising their awareness about\nhygiene  and  primary  health  care  is  also  important,  to  generate  greater  demand  for  health\nservices.\n\nC. \n\nProject Strategy and Components\n\n8.\nThe  project  EMDP  will  support  and  strengthen  the  ongoing  Government  strategy  for\nethnic  minorities  in  the  health  sector,  including  Program  135  and  Program  133  as  part  of  the\nHunger  Eradication  and  Poverty  Reduction  (HEPR)  Program,  while  adding  new  components\nthat are specific to the Project. To achieve the goal of the EMDP, the Project will (i) mainstream\nspecial cultural and socioeconomic needs and concerns of ethnic minority women and children\ninto all project activities, and (ii) provide ethnic minority-specific services and facilities.\n\n9.\n\nThe mainstreaming strategy will be implemented through the following components:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nguidelines and training responsive to the special needs of ethnic minority women\nand children (components A.1, A.3);\nupgraded  or  new  health  facilities  and  equipment  taking  into  account  easier\nphysical access by ethnic minority groups (A.2);\nimproved quality of health system and project management (B.2, B.3);\ncommunity-based  approach  responsive  to  diverse  needs  of  ethnic  minority\ncommunities (B.2, C.3);\nimproved  awareness-raising  activities  on  primary  health  care \nstrengthened behavioral change communication (BCC) activities (C.2, C.3); and\n\nthrough\n\n(vi)  more  affordable  access  to  public  health  care  through  free  health  cards  for  the\n\npoor (B.1).\n\n10.\ncomponents:\n\nThe  ethnic  minority-specific  strategy  will  be  implemented  through  the  following\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nestablishment  of  herbal  gardens  at  commune  health  centers  where  relevant\n(A.2);\ntraining of traditional birth attendants (A.3);\nproduction  of  ethnic  minority  handbook  for  commune  and  village  health\nstaff/workers (C.2); and\ntranslation of BCC materials into ethnic minority languages where possible (C.2).\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 15, page 1\n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES\n\nA.\n\nRationale for Public Investment in Viet Nam\u2019s Rural Health Sector\n\n1.\n\nEconomic Returns\n\n1.\nThere  is  a  strong  economic  rationale  for  public  investment  in  the  rural  health  sector.\nInvestment in the health status of people and prevention of diseases in the project area will yield\nthe following economic gains:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nProductivity. The project interventions are likely to save at least 1 million healthy\nlife  years  within  10  years  of  project  completion.  Improvements  in  health  status\nwill lead to improved productivity. Data from the 1998 Viet Nam Living Standards\nSurvey show that the economic cost of the number of days lost due to sickness\namounts to about 8.7 percent of gross domestic product. If a healthy life year is\nvalued at per capita gross national product, the project interventions will lead to\naddition of at least $330 million to the national income over 10 years from project\ncompletion.\n\nSavings. Prevention of diseases will result in substantial savings in the direct and\nopportunity  costs  of  treating  the  prevented  illness.  The  total  private  expenditure\non health care in the project provinces amounts to about $400 million every year.\nA 10 percent reduction in sickness will mean a saving of $40 million per annum in\nthe direct cost of health care, and much more if the indirect costs are included.\n\nIntergenerational  benefits.  Benefits  from  the  Project  go  beyond  the  existing\ngeneration, since improvements in the health status of mothers and prevention of\nHIV/AIDS1  promise  better  health  for  the  children.  Studies  show  that  a  mother\u2019s\ndeath  significantly  reduces  the  survival  probability  and  well-being  of  the  child.\nThe Project interventions are likely to prevent at least 1,000 maternal deaths in\n10 years after project completion.\n\nHealthy children. The project interventions are expected to prevent about 26,000\ninfant deaths and improve the health status of millions of children during and 10\nyears  after  the  project  period.  Better  health  and  nutritional  status  in  childhood\nleads to better cognitive and learning abilities. Thus the project investments will\nmean  better  returns  on  investment  in  children.  In  addition,  reduction  in  infant\nmortality will also lead to better population planning.\n\n2.\n\nRole of the Government\n\n2.\nThe  question  arises  as  to  why  the  Government  should  invest  in  the  proposed  services\nand  not  leave  it  to  the  market  forces.  There  are  clearly  identified  areas  of  market  failures  in\nproviding and financing rural health services in Viet Nam. In the absence of public investment,\nthe availability and use of these services will be inadequate. The main economic arguments for\na proactive role for the Government are as follows:\n\n(i) \n\nPrimary health services are mostly public goods or have large externalities and,\ntherefore, will not be adequately provided by the private sector;\n\n                                                          \n1 human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 15, page 2\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPrimary  health  services  are  marked  by  uncertainty  and  incomplete  information\nleading  to  low  levels  of  demand  and  poor  supply  response  from  the  private\nsector; and\n\nFailure  of  insurance  markets  puts  the  cure  for  catastrophic  health  conditions,\nsuch  as  delivery  complications  and  accidents,  out  of  the  reach  of  common\npeople, thus necessitating public intervention.\n\nPublic Good and Externalities. Many of the planned interventions such as prevention\n3.\nof  food  adulteration,  and  behavior  change  communication  to  reduce  tobacco  use  and  prevent\naccidents  are  public  goods.  Since  these  services  can  be  used  by  anyone  without  paying,  the\nprivate  sector  does  not  have  any  incentive  to  provide  them.  In  the  absence  of  public\nintervention,  such  services  will  simply  not  exist.  Other  proposed  interventions  have  large\npositive  externalities,  i.e.,  the  social  benefits  of  using  these  services  are  far  greater  than  the\nprivate benefits. For example, immunization against a communicable disease not only protects\nthe  individual  but  also  contributes  toward  creating  herd  immunity  and  breaking  the  infection\ntransmission  chain,  and  thus  protects  the  entire  community.  Similarly,  improved  reproductive\nhealth  services  lead  to  lower  fertility,  which  may  reduce  expenditure  and  encourage  higher\nsavings and investments, enhancing the overall standard of living. However, individuals would\nnot take into account these spin-off benefits when deciding to use or provide these services. In\nthe  absence  of  public  financing,  therefore,  the  effective  demand  for  and  provision  of  these\nservices are likely to be below the socially optimal levels.\n\n4.\nLack  of  Information.  Communities  and  families  in  rural  areas  often  lack  information\nabout  the  availability  of  services  and  the  need  for  using  these  services.  They  learn  from  their\nown  experiences  rather  than  through  modern  research  findings.  Lack  of  information  about\nmodern  medical  practices  leads  to  a  poor  demand  for  health  services,  especially  among  the\npoor  and  disadvantaged.  This  also  results  in  a  poor  supply  response  from  the  private  sector,\nsince  it  does  not  consider  providing  health  services  in  rural  areas  sufficiently  remunerative.\nClearly, the Government has a critical role to play in providing information, generating demand\nand demonstrating benefits from modern medical practices.\n\nAbsence  of  Insurance  Markets.  Another  type  of  market  failure  that  affects  the  health\n5.\nstatus of people relates to the failure of the rural insurance system. The high cost of emergency\ncare  at  the  tertiary  level  is  a  major  constraint  to  utilization  of  these  services  in  case  of\nemergencies. Faced with such emergency cases, families cannot decide on the timely referral\nto  a  tertiary  hospital  before  it  is  too  late.  These  price  constraints  potentially  affect  all  but  the\nrichest  families.  Effective  risk  pooling  mechanisms  through  insurance  systems  do  not  exist  to\nprevent increasingly frequent and fatal cases that require emergency and expensive care. The\ngovernment  provision  of  services  is  the  only  alternative  in  the  absence  of  effective  insurance\nsystems in the rural areas.\n\n3. \n\nPoverty Reduction\n\nPerhaps the most important economic justification for the Project is the equity or want-of-\n6.\nmerit rationale. While the doi moi policy has expanded economic opportunities for many and has\nassisted in achieving rapid economic growth, it has not sufficiently benefited certain sections of\nthe population. The poor and people living in remote areas do not have sufficient human capital\nto  benefit  from  the  opportunities  created  by  economic  liberalization.  While  these  groups  have\ngained little from these policies, the declining investments in social sectors and introduction of\nuser fees have increased the inequities in access to health services. They have also stretched\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 15, page 3\n\nthe social solidarity of the country to a breaking point. Today, rural people do not have the same\naccess  as  urban  dwellers  to  either  publicly  operated  or  private  health  services.  At  the  same\ntime,  rural  dwellers,  especially  the  poor,  generally  have  a  lower  health  status  than  urban\ndwellers.  Moreover,  the  inequities  in  access  to  health  services  and  health  status  have  in  fact\nwidened in the last few years. The Government has initiated several social safety net programs\nto  provide  a  minimum  floor  of  social  services  for  all  persons  dwelling  in  Viet  Nam,  and,  is\nseeking  to  rebuild  the  past  strong  sense  of  social  solidarity.  However,  without  external\nassistance, government resources will not be adequate to cover both demand- and supply-side\nconstraints  faced  by  the  poor.  The  Project  will  assist  the  government  in  reducing  poverty  by\nimproving the access of the poor to health services (a detailed discussion is in Appendix 13).\n\nB.\n\nWill the Proposed Project Crowd Out Private Spending?\n\n7.\nAccording  to  the  Health  Sector  Review,  health  sector  private  investment  has  not\ngenerally been located in rural areas, especially in the most impoverished areas2. Thus, to the\nextent that the project is targeting its investments to impoverished rural areas, it is not likely to\ncrowd  out  private  spending  in  the  health  sector.  The  majority  of  the  proposed  hospital\ninvestments  will  be  in  rural  district  facilities.  The  average  rural  per  capita  income  is  about  55\npercent lower than the urban income. So far, only three private hospitals have actually become\noperational  in  urban  areas  in  Viet  Nam.  Thus,  the  demand  for  hospital-based  care,  while\ngrowing,  has  not  yet  reached  the  point  where  private  payments  can  fully  support  the  financial\ncosts of operating a hospital facility, especially in a rural area. A recent study shows that, in Viet\nNam, investments in public facilities strengthen the private sector instead of crowding it out. It\nhappens  because  a  large  number  of  public  health  care  providers  also  work  for  the  private\nsector.  Therefore,  improving  the  skills  of  the  public  sector  workers  through  training  indirectly\nimproves  the  quality  of  private  sector  services.  Increased  competition  from  public  sector\nhospitals encourages the private sector to improve quality.\n\nC.\n\nProject Beneficiaries\n\n8.\nThe  13  project  provinces  have  a  population  of  15  million,  of  whom  12.7  million  live  in\nrural  areas. The  Project will improve access to quality health services for the rural population,\nthereby  directly  or  indirectly  improving  their  health  status.  Beneficiaries  will  include  3  million\nwomen in the reproductive age group, 1.3 million people from ethnic minorities, 6.2 million poor\npeople,  2  million  children,  and  1.5  million  elderly.  The  Project  will  benefit  about  1.5  million\npregnant  women  and  1.3  million  newborn  children  during  the  project  period.  In  addition,  the\nproject interventions will directly benefit about 800,000 poor people through free health cards.\n\nD.\n\nCost-Effectiveness  and  Benefit/Cost  Assessment  of  Proposed  Project\nInterventions\n\n9.\nThe  cost-effectiveness  of  project  investments  was  analyzed  with  alternative  scenarios\nfor the flow of benefits and costs. Project benefits and costs are going to accrue well beyond the\nproject period. This  analysis  takes a  time horizon of 20 years, beyond which disease patterns\nand  medical  technologies  can  be  assumed  to  significantly  differ  from  the  present  situation.\nMoreover,  any  net  flow  from  the  period  after  20  years  will  have  only  a  very  small  net  present\nvalue.\n\n                                                          \n2  See Chapter 5, Health Sector Review, op. cit., 1999.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 15, page 4\n\nValuation  of  Benefits.  In  this  analysis,  the  project  outcomes  of  health  improvements\n10.\nare assessed by quantifying the burden of disease by the number of disability adjusted life years\n(DALYs) lost due to premature illness, disability, and death. Reductions in the disease burden\u2014\nthe number of DALYs saved during and after the project period\u2014represent a direct estimate of\nthe  project  impact.  The  disease  burden  for  Viet  Nam  for  1999  was  estimated  based  on  the\nrecent  work  of  Western  Pacific  Region  of  the  WHO3  and  the  earlier  work  of  C.  Murray  and  A\nLopez of WHO/Geneva4.\n\nIt was assumed that without the project investments, the current rate of improvement in\n11.\nlife  expectancy  will  decline  over  time  to  a  level  about  one  half  the  rate  experienced  over  the\nprevious 25 years. This assumption is justified on the basis that earlier investments in the health\nsystem  and  social  sectors  would  have  already  run  their  course.  With  the  project  investments,\nthree benefit scenarios were investigated.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nLow  scenario.  Since  the  Project  will  rehabilitate  the  old  primary  health  care\ninfrastructure,  the  rate  of  increase  in  life  expectancy  would  equal  the  previous\ntrend rate. In other words, the past rate of reduction in DALYs will be maintained\nin the future.\n\nModerate Scenario. This scenario assumes that the rate of DALY reduction is 10\npercent greater than the previous trend rate.\n\nHigh scenario. This scenario assumes that the rate of DALY reduction achieved\nby the project investments is 30 percent greater than the previous trend rate.\n\n12.\nValuation  of  Cost.  The  costs  considered  in  this  analysis  include  the  five-year  project\ncapital and recurrent costs, plus an additional 15 years of recurrent costs to continue operating\neach  project  component  that  extends  or  refurbishes  services,  or  improves  service  quality  or\nmanagement.  While  the  project  capital  costs  are  known,  recurrent  costs  during  and  after  the\nproject period are difficult to estimate with certainity. These recurrent costs will be substantially\ninfluenced  by  the  change  in  utilization  pattern  of  health  services  after  the  Project.  For  the\nanalysis,  the  relationship  between  project  capital  costs  and  subsequent  recurrent  costs,  as\ndefined by the \u201cr\u201d coefficient, is assumed to be similar to what has occurred in other developing\ncountries.  The  \u201cr\u201d  coefficient  has  been  found  to  vary  between  0.2  and  0.4  in  most  other\ncountries for the types of investment envisioned in the Project.5\n\nBenefit-Cost  and  Cost-Effectiveness  Analyses.  Several  benefit-cost  and  cost-\n13.\neffectiveness analyses were conducted. These were based on the cost and burden of disease\n(BOD) reduction analyses defined above, assumptions regarding the rate of time preference (or\ndiscount rate), and the relationship between capital and subsequent recurrent costs. The results\nare summarized in Table A15.1.\n\n14.\nThe cost-effectiveness of the project interventions is estimated in the range of $12-$45\nper  DALY  saved  depending  on  the  assumption.

The second part of Table A15.1 shows that the\nproposed  investment  will  yield  considerably  greater  returns  in  terms  of  economic  growth  than\nthe attendant costs. At the 3 percent discount rate, the benefits are expected to be greater than\nthe capital and recurrent costs by a factor of 11 to 21. The results suggest that, assessed in its\nentirety,  the  project  is  highly  cost-effective  relative  to  most  investments  not  only  outside,  but\nalso within the health sector.\n\nTable A15.1: Summary of Benefit-Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analyses\n\nAlternative\nScenario\n\n3%\n\nDiscount Rate\n7%\n5%\n\n10%\n\nA.

An  analysis  was  undertaken  to\nassess the recurrent cost implications of the project activities and the capacity of the central and\nprovincial governments and communities for pay for such costs.\n\n                                                          \n6  Asian Development Bank. 1999.

As  discussed  above,  it  is  difficult  to  estimate  with\n16.\nprecision  the  recurrent  costs  of  facilities  planned  under  the  Project.  Studies  in  other  countries\nwith similar socioeconomic status have shown that recurrent costs in hospitals are typically 20-\n40  percent  (r-value  of  0.2  to  0.4)  of  the  capital  costs.  Since  the  project  investments  relate  to\nprimary health care and are located in poor areas of the country, it would be safe to assume that\nthe recurrent costs would be on the lower side of the observed range. Therefore, analysis was\nundertaken for r-value of 0.2 and 0.3. On these assumptions, the recurrent cost liabilities of the\nProject after the project period are shown in Table A15.2. The estimates show that the liabilities\nare relatively low in Tien Giang and high in Hoa Binh.\n\n17.\nFinancing  of  Recurrent  Costs.  Four  main  sources  for  financing  the  recurrent  cost\nassociated with the project investments were considered: (i) out-of-pocket expenditure through\nuser  charges,  (ii)  health  insurance,  (iii)  free  health  cards,  and  (iv) government  budgets.  Trend\ndata from 1992-1997 was used to predict the value of available resources during and after the\nproject period. The revenue from the various sources was estimated as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nUser charges. Revenue from user charges increased at a compounded rate of 14\npercent from 1991 to 1994 and at a rate of 40 percent between 1994 and 1997. It\naccounts for more than a third of total hospital expenditure. It was assumed that\nuser  charges  would  continue  to  provide  one  third  of  the  operating  costs  of  the\nupgraded hospitals.\n\nHealth  insurance.  Hospitals  revenue  from  health  insurance  reimbursements\nincreased  by  an  annual  rate  of  more  than  30  percent  during  1994  and  1998.  It\nwas assumed that these revenues would continue to grow by 20 percent in the\nnext  10  years.  The  assumption  of  reduced  growth  in  reimbursement  revenue  is\nbased  on  the  belief  that  enrollment  of  new  members  will  not  grow  at  the  same\nrate as before due to market saturation.\n\nFree health cards. The new scheme of free health cards for the poor will provide\nadditional funds for the health system. It was assumed that the entire subsidy of\nD30,000 per person would be used by the health system. This is plausible since\nthe  average  per  capita  reimbursement  of  the  usual  health  insurance  scheme  is\nmore than D50,000.\n\nGovernment budget. It was assumed that government budgets would continue to\nincrease  by  an  annual  rate  of  3  percent  in  real  terms  over  the  next  10  years.\nSince  the  rate  of  increase  has  been  more  than  3  percent  in  the  last  few  years,\nthis assumption is on the conservative side.\n\nAnalysis shows that the Government has the capacity to sustain the project investments\n18.\nbeyond the project period. From the above projections, the recurrent cost estimates for r = 0.2\nwould constitute less than 1 percent of provincial GDP in all provinces and 3-10 percent of the\nhealth budget. Since the facilities to be upgraded under the Project cover about 90 percent of\nthe  population,  allocation  of  these  budget  amounts  for  maintaining  the  facilities  would  be\njustified.  Moreover,  if  we  assume  that  the  health  budgets  will  grow  by  more  than  3  percent,\nwhich  is  a  likely  scenario,  the  proportion  of  the  budget  required  to  be  allocated  to  sustain  the\nproject inputs would be even less. Even with r =0.3, the recurrent cost liabilities range from 5 to\n15 percent, which is clearly affordable. However, the recurrent cost implications in Binh Phuoc\nand  Hoa  Binh  are  clearly  much  higher  than  in  the  other  provinces.  The  two  are  among  the\npoorest provinces and have relatively weaker health infrastructure. Therefore, special attention\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 15, page 7\n\nwould  need  to  be  paid  to  ensuring  that  government  budgets  adequately  increased  in  these\nprovinces to support the project inputs.\n\nTable A15.2: Recurrent Cost of the Project\n\nProject\nProvince\n\nRecurrent Cost\nLiabilities in 2006\n(D per Capita)\n\nRecurrent Cost\nLiabilities After Cost\nRecovery\n(D per Capita)\n\nShare of GDP\n(percent)\n\nShare of Health\nBudget\n(percent)\n\nr = 0.2\n\nr = 0.3\n\nr = 0.2\n\nr = 0.3\n\nr = 0.2\n\nr = 0.3\n\nr = 0.2\n\nr = 0.3\n\nHoa Binh\n\n13,640\n\n20460\n\n9,548\n\n14,322\n\n10\n\nPhu Tho\n\n7,645\n\n11,468\n\n5,352\n\nVinh Phuc\n\n8,317\n\n12,475\n\n5,822\n\nQuang Ninh\n\n8,319\n\n12,478\n\n5,823\n\nNinh Binh\n\n9,847\n\n14,770\n\n6,893\n\n10,339\n\nQuang Binh\n\n8,424\n\n12,637\n\n5,897\n\nQuang Ngai\n\n6,148\n\n9,222\n\n4,303\n\nKhanh Hoa\n\n7,362\n\n11,043\n\n5,153\n\nLong An\n\n6,375\n\n9,562\n\n4,462\n\nTien Giang\n\n4,580\n\n6,870\n\n3,206\n\nBen Tre\n\n7,070\n\n10,605\n\n4,949\n\nCan Tho\n\n4,891\n\n7,337\n\n3,424\n\n0.39\n\n0.19\n\n0.22\n\n0.12\n\n0.27\n\n0.24\n\n0.17\n\n0.10\n\n0.28\n\n0.09\n\n0.08\n\n0.13\n\n0.07\n\n0.59\n\n0.28\n\n0.33\n\n0.18\n\n0.40\n\n0.36\n\n0.26\n\n0.14\n\n0.42\n\n0.13\n\n0.11\n\n0.20\n\n0.11\n\n8,028\n\n8,732\n\n8,735\n\n8,846\n\n6,455\n\n7,730\n\n6,694\n\n4,809\n\n7,424\n\n5,136\n\n15\n\n8\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n9\n\n7\n\n8\n\n7\n\n5\n\n8\n\n6\n\n5\n\n6\n\n5\n\n6\n\n6\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n3\n\n6\n\n4\n\nBinh Phuoc\n\n12,085\n\n18,128\n\n8,460\n\n12,689\n\n10\n\n15\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 26 September 2000)\n", "Currency Unit\nD1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013\n=\n=\n", "Dong (D)\n$0.000070\nD14,204\n", "For the purpose of calculations in this report, a rate of $1.00 = D14,000 is used.
