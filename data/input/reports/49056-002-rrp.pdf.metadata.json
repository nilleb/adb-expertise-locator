The \nreport  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  capacity  development  and \nperformance monitoring for the program, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2. \nThe  proposed  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  will  contribute  to  Pakistan\u2019s \nnational goal of enhanced energy security. The program will be implemented over 5 years and \nwill  support  the  governments  of  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  Province  (KPP)  and  Punjab  province  to \nachieve  increased  access  to  sustainable  and  more  reliable  electricity  services,  particularly  for \nvulnerable communities in KPP and Punjab.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nStrategic Context \n\nA. \n \n3. \nCountry context. Pakistan\u2019s economic growth declined significantly in FY2010\u2013FY2014, \nlargely  as  a  result  of  increasingly  intense  energy  shortages,  rising  food  prices,  security \nchallenges,  and  natural  disasters.3 In  2014,  29.5%  of  the  population  of  180  million  was  living \nbelow  the  national  poverty  line,  with  substantial  disparity  in  the  poverty  rate  between  urban \n(18.2%)  and  rural  (35.6%)  areas. 4  Energy  access  and  affordability  plays  a  critical  role  in \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Although  Pakistan  has  abundant  renewable  and \nnonrenewable  energy  resources,  public  and  private  investment  in  energy  infrastructure  has \nremained  inadequate  and  the  system  suffers  heavily  from  the  low  efficiency  of  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution networks. Although the timing of outages has become predictable, \nthe  5\u2013gigawatt  demand\u2013supply  gap  combined  with  the  stressed  transmission  and  distribution \nsystem result in significant load shedding\u201410 hours per day in rural areas and 4 hours in urban \nareas.  Overreliance  on \nfuel-based  generation,  high  consumer \nreceivables, and insufficient tariffs have resulted in persistent circular debt.5 Pakistan\u2019s potential \nrenewable  energy  resources  total  more  than  65,000  megawatts  (MW),  but  current  installed \ngeneration  capacity  from  these  sources  is  only  7,100  MW  (35%  of  total  generation).  The \nnational electrification rate is only 67%,6 and it is even lower (57%) in rural areas. \n \n4. \nProvincial  context.  The  focus  on  renewable  energy  development  in  KPP  and  Punjab \nsupports  the  Government  of  Pakistan\u2019s  strategy  of  lowering  stress  on  the  national  grid, \ndecreasing load shedding, and increasing access to electricity using the least-cost option, which \n\nimported  conventional \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  In 2015, ADB provided program preparatory TA for Access to Clean Energy Investment (TA 9047-PAK). \n3  Average annual economic growth during FY2010\u2013FY2014 was 3.5%, down from 5.1% in FY2005\u2013FY2009.

Manila. \n\n6  Government of Pakistan. Ministry of Planning, Development & Reform. 2014.  Pakistan Vision 2025: One Nation\u2013\n\nOne Vision. Islamabad (Executive Summary). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fwill reduce circular debt. KPP, with a population of 28.3 million, is one of the poorest provinces \nin Pakistan,  and the most  unequal,  with 38%  of its  rural  population living  in households in the \npoorest  quintile. 7 In  some  districts,  the  electrification  rate  is  below  20%  (it  is  just  2.9%  in \nKohistan and 15% in Shangla). Geographic constraints make extending the national grid to such \nremote  areas  costly  and  technically  difficult.  In  these  areas,  the  least-cost  option  is  off-grid \nrenewable  energy  sources.  Punjab  has  the  largest  population  of  Pakistan\u2019s  provinces  and \nconsumes  around  68%  of  the  country\u2019s  electricity  and  gas.  The  economy  is  based  largely  on \nagriculture and industry, and depends heavily on a reliable electricity supply. In Punjab, service \ndelivery  can  be  improved  and  the  transmission  and  distribution  system  stress  reduced  by \nshifting some demand to off-grid/self-generation using solar power. In view of the overstretched \nnational  grid,  the  2017\u20132026  provincial  energy  sector  master  plans  of  the  KPP  and  Punjab \nprovincial  governments  have  prioritized  renewable  resources, 8  with  a  view  to  expanding \nelectrification  and  reliable  energy  in  line  with  the  national  strategy,  and  with  an  emphasis  on \nproviding  an  uninterrupted  electricity  supply  for  schools  and  primary  health  care  facilities \n(PHFs).9 In  KPP, the  installation of  up to 1,000 kilowatts  of micro-hydropower  plants  (MHPs)10 \ncould supply off-grid communities with basic electricity services. \n \n5. \nSocial  and  gender  context.  An  estimated  38%  of  KPP\u2019s  population  lives  below  the \nnational  poverty  line, 11  while  49%  of  the  population  in  KPP  and  31%  in  Punjab  live  in \nmultidimensional  poverty. 12 The  most  deprived  communities\u2014such  as  Kohistan,  with  a \nmultidimensional poverty incidence of 96%\u2014were selected for off-grid electrification. About 20% \nof  schools  in  KPP  and  10%  in  Punjab  are  not  connected  to  the  electricity  grid.  PHFs  in  rural \nareas are subject to long hours of load shedding, making it difficult to provide effective services, \nand keep lifesaving drugs and vaccines for diseases such as polio refrigerated. \n \n6. \nThe  availability  of  electricity  in  schools  improves  the  learning  environment,  and \ncontributes  to  student  enrollment.  Women  and  girls  benefit  from  access  to  electricity  through \ntime savings  associated  with  firewood  or  water  collection  activities,  and  the  use  of  appliances \n(e.g., washing machines, cell phones, refrigerators, fans, and irons). Electric appliances improve \nindoor air quality. Providing solar power to PHFs that provide antenatal care, delivery, and child \nhealth  benefits  rural  women  in  particular.  Over  2.7  million  women  in  KPP  and  48.2  million  in \nPunjab could benefit from improved electricity access at PHFs.13 \n \nB. \n \n7. \nFit  with  national  priorities.  Pakistan\u2019s  overall  national  goal  for  2025  is  to  achieve \ninclusive and dynamic economic growth, with energy security as a supporting pillar (footnote 6). \nThe energy sector goal is to ensure uninterrupted access to affordable and clean energy for all \nPakistanis, with quantitative targets for (i) increasing electricity access from 67% to over 90% by \n2025,  (ii)  eliminating  the  current  electricity  supply\u2013demand  gap  by  2018, 14  and  (iii)  adding \n                                                \n7  Government of Pakistan. 2015.

These  national \ntargets  cannot  be  achieved  without  increasing  the  share  of  renewable  energy  in  the  energy \nmix.15 This  is  the  context  in  which  the  government  has  requested  ADB  support  to  increase \naccess to sustainable and reliable electricity services. \n \n8. \nProvincial  priorities.  The  results-based  lending  (RBL)  program  will  help  address  the \nenergy shortage and low electrification rate in KPP and Punjab by supporting the installation of \nMHPs  (small  run-of-the  stream  or  canal  plants)  in  off-grid  communities,  and  solar  facilities  in \nschools and PHFs. The KPP and Punjab development strategies emphasize inclusive and pro-\npoor  economic  growth,  which  requires  access  to  reliable  electricity.  The  relevant  provincial \ntargets  include (i)  by  2026,  expanding  solar  power generation  capacity  by  42  MW in  KPP  and \n2,330  MW  in  Punjab,  and  adding  5,204  MW  of  hydropower  generation  capacity  in  KPP;  (ii) \nproviding  electricity  to  more  than  1.5  million  people  from  MHPs  in  KPP;  and  (iii)  achieving \nsavings  from  energy  efficiency  in  Punjab.  The  two  provinces  have  requested  ADB  support  to \nfinance  and  build  capacity.  In  KPP,  ADB  helped  develop  the  electrification  road  map  and \ninstitutional strengthening plan, which will serve as the foundation for the program. \n \nFit  with  ADB\u2019s  strategic  priorities.  The  program  is  in  line  with  (i)  the  ADB  Strategy \n9. \n2020  midterm \ninfrastructure \ndevelopment, and engagement in middle-income countries; and (ii) the ADB country partnership \nstrategy, 2015\u20132019 for Pakistan.17 The provision of energy to poor, remote rural areas outside \nthe  national  grid  (i)  is  a  priority  in  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy;18 (ii)  will  expand  energy  access  and \ncontribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, \nreliable, sustainable and modern energy for all; and (iii) with its renewable energy outputs, will \ncontribute to ADB climate financing. The program has strong linkages with other ADB projects, \nas it will provide relief to stressed national transmission and distribution systems, and balance \nthe energy mix, which are the basis for key ADB interventions. \n \nResults-based  lending.  RBL  is  the  most  suitable  modality  because  (i)  the  program\u2019s \n10. \nbusiness model, which is community-driven from design to operation and maintenance, requires \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)\u2014and  the  private  sector  for  the  MHPs\u2014to  lead  the \ncontractor  team  and  be  responsible  for  community  mobilization  and  sustainability;  the  NGOs \nsuccess and eligibility for further projects are measured by the results achieved, which fits RBL \nrather  than  investment  projects:  (ii)  by  monitoring  results,  RBL  reduces  transaction  costs \ncompared  with  investment  projects,  which  would  have  extremely  difficult  to  control  inputs  to \nthousands  of schools,  health facilities,  and communities;  (iii)  RBL foster  government  and local \nownership  on  a  large  decentralized  scale  and  leverage  system  improvements  at  provincial, \ndistrict,  and  local  levels,  without  which  provincial  targets  for  electrification  from  decentralized \nrenewable  sources  cannot  be  achieved;  (iv)  by  focusing  on  achieving  results,  which  requires \ngreater  engagement  and  attitudinal  changes  from  all  stakeholders,  the  targeted  indicators  will \nensure  greater  benefits  for  vulnerable  communities  and  women,  and  enhance  coordination \namong  the  program\u2019s  diverse  stakeholders;  (v)  both  provinces,  having  managed  and \nimplemented  ADB  as  well  as  other  donor  funded  projects  before,  have  adequate  capacity  for \nthe  RBL  program;  and  (vi)  ADB\u2019s  vast  experience  and  knowledge  of  the  energy  sector  in \nPakistan lays a technically sound and robust basis for the first energy RBL for the country. \n                                                \n15 Government  of  Pakistan,  2006.

The RBL program will support each of these \ntwo provincial programs, notably those portions that cover community-based renewable energy \ninitiatives and public sector energy efficiency (Table 1). Under the RBL program, the MHPs will \nprovide electricity to around 1.5 million people in rural areas of KPP, and solar plants installed at \nschools will provide electricity to more than 2.6 million students, including 1.2 million girls. The \nMHP  program  will  be  implemented  with  the  assistance  of  NGOs,  hired  through  a  competitive \nprocurement  process  serving  as  the  lead  partner  of  the  contractor,  and  responsible  for  site \nselection, feasibility study and community mobilization. The contractor will be responsible for the \nconstruction of the plant and the training of the community team on operation and maintenance. \nThe community organizations will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the plant \nand collection of the cost recovery tariff to ensure sustainability.

The  RBL  program\u2019s  impact  is  aligned  with  the  national  goal \n(footnote 14) of inclusive economic growth through sustainable energy access. The outcome will \nbe  increased  access  to  sustainable  and  more  reliable  electricity  services,  particularly  for \nvulnerable communities in KPP and Punjab. This will be achieved through four outputs: \n\nProgram Results \n\n2017\uf02d2021 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nOutput  1:  Renewable  energy-based  power  plants  installed.  This  output  will \nsupport  the  installation  of  1,000  MHPs  in  off-grid  areas  of  KPP.  MHPs  will  be \ndeveloped based on reliable business models and sustainable tariff structures.20 \nThe output will also support the provision and installation of rooftop solar plants \nfor  23,000  schools  and  2,587  PHFs  in  the  two  provinces  and  a  university  in \nBahawalpur, Punjab. Facilities without any electricity and those receiving only a \nfew hours of electricity per day will be prioritized. \nOutput  2:  Opportunity  for  women  and  girls  to  obtain  energy  services  and \nbenefits  increased.  This  output  will  facilitate  providing  basic  services  that  can \ncontribute to women\u2019s empowerment and well-being, and gender mainstreaming. \nGirls\u2019 schools in both provinces will be prioritized for the provision of electricity. In \nKPP,  the  program  will  identify  and  prioritize  households  headed  by  women, \nwhich are usually the poorest and most marginalized, by providing electricity from \nMHPs. Women will benefit from the time saved and the improved living standards, \nand  have  increased  access  to  training  and  enhanced  livelihood  opportunities. \nThe program will ensure round-the-clock electricity to PHFs. \nOutput  3:  Institutional  capacity  to  foster  sustainability  enhanced.  This \ncomponent will address capacity challenges that constrain program sustainability. \nThe  output  will  ensure  institutional  strengthening  of  critical  systems  (e.g.,  for \nmonitoring, procurement, and internal audit). A web-based program performance \nmonitoring system will be established under the program. \nOutput  4:  Public sector  energy  efficiency  promoted. This output will support \nenergy  efficiency  audits  in  Punjab,  and  develop  a  methodology  for  follow-up  on \naudit recommendations. It will also support to develop standards and the design \nfor  a  net-zero  energy  building,  based  on  the  results  achieved  from  the \nconstruction of a model building for the energy department. \n\n \n14. \nEight  disbursement-linked  indicators  selected.  Each  disbursement-linked  indicator \n(DLI)  meets  the  criteria  of  being  specific,  measurable,  achievable,  relevant,  and  time-bound. \n\n                                                \n20 AF-Mercados  EMI.  2016.

The outcome DLI \n(DLI  1)  measures  the  number  of  people  that  benefit  from  access  to  reliable  electricity  (target: \n240,000  households  and  2.6  million  students).  Under  output  1,  DLI  2  monitors  the  power \ngeneration capacity added from clean energy sources (target: 182 MW additional capacity), and \nDLI  3  tracks  the  number  of  locations  with  installed  renewable  energy-based  power  plants \n(target:  1,000  MHPs,  23,000  schools,  and  2,587  PHFs).  Under  output  2,  two  DLIs  4  and  5 \nensure  that  planning  and  targeting  give  special  attention  to  girls\u2019  schools  and  households \nheaded  by  women.  Under  output  3,  DLI  6  focuses  on  improving  governance  and  systems  for \nfinancial  management  and  procurement,  while  DLI  7  promotes  effective  and  continuous \nperformance  monitoring,  which  is  essential  to  the  program\u2019s  success.  Under  output  4,  DLI  8 \ntracks progress on energy efficiency measures. \n \nThe  DLI  selection  process  was  based  on  the  outcomes  of  due  diligence  conducted \n16. \nunder  the  project  preparatory  TA.  Best  practices  have  been  structured  into  the  program\u2019s \nbusiness model, with adoption of such practices made part of the program. The targets for each \nquantitative DLI were based on provincial averages, which are quite high when compared with \nthe rural areas targeted by the program. Similarly, targets for DLIs 4 and 5 (regarding gender) \nwere  developed  based  on  current  statistics  and  on  empirical  evidence  that  girls\u2019  schools \nhouseholds  headed  by  women  need  special  attention  in  planning  and  targeting.  DLIs  6  and 7 \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fseek to strengthen institutional setups; these are ambitious in seeking to institute essential new \nprocedures  and  systems  (e.g.,  the  establishment  of  institutionalized  procurement  procedures; \nan internal audit function that meets the standards set by the  auditor-general of Pakistan; and \nmost importantly, a web-based monitoring system with functions beyond traditional monitoring). \nFor the quantitative indicators on households and students (DLI 1), off-grid generation capacity \nand  number  of  sites  (DLIs  2  and  3),  indicative  baseline  numbers  are  not  available  as \ninterventions  must  be  site-specific.  These  targets  have  been  set  based  on  terrain,  results \nachieved  by  similar  projects  developed  by  NGOs,  and  a  comparison  with  provincial  data. \nSimilarly, the disbursement amount allocated to each DLI depends on its proportion for program \nsuccess,  with  bigger  shares  allocated  to  critical  DLIs  (e.g.,  MHP  development,  which  has  the \nlargest impact on results). \n \nDisbursement  allocation  and  schedule.

The use \n24. \nof  off-grid  renewable  energy  is  the  least-cost  option  for  rural  communities  scattered  over  the \nmountainous areas of KPP province. The program will increase energy security, reduce reliance \non imported fuel, reduce the carbon footprint, and contribute to social equity. These conclusions \nunderpin  the  program\u2019s  result  areas,  key  actions,  and  performance  indicators.  Design  and \nimplementation  arrangements  are  sound  and  the  results  framework  is  well  designed,  being \nbased on a robust causal analysis of the results chain. Each DLI indicator represents an action \ncritical to the achievement of the results. \n \n25. \nThe program will supply reliable electricity to schools, PHFs, and rural communities that \ncurrently either lack electricity or receive it for a very limited period, and use other sources (e.g., \nkerosene  or  candles)  as  alternatives.  This  benefit  is  incremental  and  valued  at  willingness  to \npay.  Some  incremental  benefits  will  also  be  contributed  through  the  sale  of  saved  electricity, \nwhich  is  assumed  to  be  redistributed  to  the  grid  for  customers  without  alternative  means  of \ngenerating electricity, valued at the current tariff rate plus subsidies. Similarly, non-incremental \nbenefits have been estimated at the resource saving value for electricity supplied to schools and \nPHFs  that  use  alternative  means,  such  as  gasoline  or  diesel  for  generating  electricity.  The \neconomic internal rate of return is 17.4%, confirming the economic viability of the program.24 \n \n26. \nClassification.  The  RBL  program  is  classified  general  intervention,  which  supports \npoverty  reduction  indirectly  by  providing  electricity  to  poorer  households,  schools,  and  PHFs, \nand  by  supporting  skills  development.  The  program  is  classified  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming,  with  (i)  a gender-specific  output  and  three  gender-related  DLIs,  (ii)  training  on \ngender-inclusiveness, (iii) consultations with men and women during site selection and program \nimplementation,  (iv)  collection  of  baseline  data  for  DLI  verification,  and  (v)  monitoring  and \nevaluation of gender-related components. \n \nB. \n \n27.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  The  M&E  systems  of  PEDO  and  EDP  were \nassessed  and  measures  to  strengthen  were  identified.  The  current  M&E  indicators  are  limited \nand  are  the  responsibility  of  project  directors.  PEDO  focuses  on  monitoring  construction \n                                                \n23 The  program  will  be  financed  by  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  and  cofinancing  from  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement. The funds of ADB and Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement will be commingled and jointly used \nto finance the common expenditure framework of the program, including the individual procurement packages for \ngoods,  works,  and  consulting  services  under  the  program.  ADB.  2015.  Enhancing  Operational  Efficiency  of  the \nAsian Development Bank. Manila. \n\nProgram Systems Assessments \n\n24 Program Soundness Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fprogress  and  not  operation  and  maintenance,  while  EDP  has  no  established  indicators.  Data \ncollection  and  reporting  are  done  manually  with  assistance  from  management  consultants, \nwhich  will  become  challenging  given  the  expanded  number  of  monitoring  indicators  under  the \nRBL, and the large number of sites. Institutional arrangements are satisfactory, with PEDO and \nEDP  reporting  to  provincial  authorities  on  program  progress.  The  program  will  support  a  web-\nbased M&E system, which will enable PEDO and EDP to manage the expanded M&E activities. \nADB\u2019s TA (para. 22) will support training on verifying and monitoring indicators. \n \nFiduciary systems. The program will use country fiduciary systems for public financial \n28. \nmanagement,  procurement,  and  anticorruption.  These  systems  were  assessed  to  determine \nwhether they would be able to manage fiduciary risks and provide assurance that RBL program \nfunds  are  used  for  their  intended  purposes,  with  economy  and  efficiency.  The  financial \nmanagement  assessment  confirms  that  adequate financial  management  capacity  exists  in  the \nKPP  and  Punjab  provincial  governments,  with  sound  budgeting,  accounting,  and  financial \nreporting;  and  auditing  procedures  and  practices.  Improvements  are  needed  to  strengthen \ninternal control and establish internal audit functions. The PAP includes mitigating measures to \nmanage fiduciary risks. \n \n29. \nProcurement  systems.  The  procurement  systems  and  practices  are  sound  and  can \ndeliver  the  intended  outcomes.  Procurement  will  follow  the  respective  KPP  and  Punjab \nprovincial  procurement  rules,  which  are  both  largely  modeled  on  the  Federal  Public \nProcurement  Rules  of  Pakistan.  These  rules  are  substantially  aligned  with  international  best \npractices  and  allow \nfor  advertising \nprocurement opportunities, and the use of standard bidding documents. The risks are assessed \nas  high,  because  some  provisions  in  the  national  procurement  rules  can  be  used  to  restrict \ncompetition  and  endow  procuring  entities  with  discretionary  powers  that  may  compromise \nfairness  and  transparency.  The  lack  of  established  procedures  and  procurement  manuals \nrepresents  major  weaknesses.  The  PAP  sets  out  mitigating  measures,  including  institutional \nstrengthening and ensuring that restrictive clauses are not used in bidding documents. \n \n30. \nThe Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities \nin  Results-Based  Lending  Programs  were  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government, \nPEDO, and EDP.25 The government\u2019s anticorruption system is led by the National Accountability \nBureau at the federal and provincial levels. The Federal Investigation Agency, with its provincial \noffices,  has  the  authority  to  investigate  corruption  and  fraud  cases.  The  main  risk  is  the \nseemingly  reactive  nature  of  the  anticorruption  system  and  can  be  mitigated  through \nimplementing a proactive policy and increased awareness training. \n \n31. \nSafeguard  systems.  A  program  safeguard  systems  assessment  was  conducted  and \ndiscussed  with  program  stakeholders.  The  safeguard  classification  is  category  B  for  the \nenvironment, indigenous peoples, and involuntary resettlement. The climate risk to the program \nis  rated  as  high.  The  potential  impact  of  climate  change  on  hydrology  and  irradiation  can  be \nmitigated  to  some  extent  during  site  selection.  Activities  under  the  program  will  involve  civil \nworks with site-specific environmental impacts, which will be limited to the construction period, \nand will be addressed through adequate mitigation measures. Solar plants are to be placed on \nrooftops of existing facilities, while the land required for the MHPs will be provided voluntarily by \nthe beneficiary communities. MHP sites will be screened to exclude sites assessed category A \nfor the environment and with involuntary resettlement impacts.

For solar sources, the DLI refers to the total \nnumber of students in schools provided with solar electricity by the RBL \nprogram, to be obtained from education authorities.  \n \nConditions for disbursement are met when (i) the total number of \nhouseholds provided with electricity by the program from MHPs equals or \nexceeds the annual cumulative target specified, and (ii) when the total \nnumber of students in beneficiary schools is equal to or exceeds the annual \ncumulative target specified. In KPP, MHP component counts for 80% of full \ndisbursement and solar sources component counts for 20% of full \ndisbursement. For example, if all the household targets are achieved but \nstudent targets are not, then 80% of the target amount allocated for KPP for \nthat year will be disbursed.  \n \nPartial disbursement: The DLI is scalable and partial disbursement is \nallowed for each of the above components.

If the target \nachievement is early, early disbursement can be made.  \n\nInformation \nSource and \nTime Frame \n\nFrequency for \nreporting will be \nannual. \n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n25 \n\nVerification Agency and \nProcedure \nThe IVA will verify the results \nfor energy audits in 2017, \n2018 and 2019 on the basis of \nthe energy audit reports \nproduced in 2017 and 2018, \nand the approval of follow up \non energy audit \nrecommendations in 2019.   \nFor the construction and \ngovernment standards on  net-\nzero building, the IVA will \nconduct checks of the site and \nthe notification of standards.  \nWithin three week of receiving \nthe independent verification \nreport, ADB confirms that the \ntarget is met and initiates the \nprocess of disbursement. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DLI = disbursement-linked indicator, EDP = Energy Department of Punjab, ICT = Information and Communication Technology, IVA = \nindependent verification agent, KPP = Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, MHP = micro-hydropower plant, MW = megawatt, PAP = program action plan,7 PEDO = \nPakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization, PPMS = program performance monitoring system, PPTA = program preparatory technical assistance, RBL = \nresults-based lending. \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Energy Department of Punjab, and Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization. \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n7 Program Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nTable A3.3: Disbursement Schedule for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab Combined \n($ million) \n\nDisbursement Linked Indicator \nBy 2021, access to electricity is provided to an additional  240,000 \nhouseholds  and  2,600,000  students  in  un-electrified  and  poorly \nelectrified areas. \n\nBy 2021, power generation capacity from clean energy sources is \nincreased by an additional amount of 182 MW. \nBy  2021,  at  least  26,587  sites  have  renewable  energy-based \npower plants installed. \nBy 2021, at least 30% of schools with solar plant installed are girls \nschools. \nBy  2021,  at  least  7%  of  target  households  newly  connected  to \nelectricity are women-headed households. \nBy  2021,  governance,  financial  management  and  procurement \nfunctions are improved. \n\nICT-driven  program  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  is \noperationalized to produce annual performance monitoring reports \non all indicators and PAP actions \n\n100%  of  identified  public  sector  buildings  have  conducted  energy \naudits  and \nfollow-up  on  energy  audit \nrecommendations has been approved. \n\nthe  methodology \n\nfor \n\nSubtotal \nInterest During Construction \nTotal \n\n76.75 \n\n61.40 \n\n22.35 \n\n17.85 \n\n30.70 \n\n307.00 \n18.00 \n325.00 \n\nTotal ADB \nFinancing \nAllocation \n\nShare of total \nADB \nFinancing \n(%) \n\n2017 \n\n2018 \n\n2019 \n\n2020 \n\n2021 \n\n61.40 \n\n20% \n\n12.28  12.28  12.28  12.28  12.28 \n\n25% \n\n15.35  15.35  15.35  15.35  15.35 \n\n20% \n\n12.28  12.28  12.28  12.28  12.28 \n\n7% \n\n6% \n\n4.47 \n\n4.47 \n\n4.47 \n\n4.47 \n\n4.47 \n\n3.57 \n\n3.57 \n\n3.57 \n\n3.57 \n\n3.57 \n\n10% \n\n18.42 \n\n6.14 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n6.14 \n\n29.86 \n\n10% \n\n15.34 \n\n5.31 \n\n3.07 \n\n3.07 \n\n3.07 \n\n6.69 \n\n2% \n\n1.67 \n\n2.51 \n\n2.51 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n100% \n\n83.38  61.91  53.53  51.02  57.16 \n\n \n \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  DLI  =  disbursement-linked  indicator,  ICT  =  Information  and  Communication  Technology,  MW  =  megawatts.
