THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Recovery through Improved Systems and Expenditure Support \nProgram, and (ii) proposed policy-based loans to the Republic of Palau for subprogram 1 of the \nRecovery through Improved Systems and Expenditure Support Program.1 \n \n2.  The program comprises two subprograms supporting public sector management reforms \nthat will facilitate Palau\u2019s recovery from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis. It seeks to \nstrengthen public financial management (PFM), reduce fiscal risks, and support private sector \ndevelopment toward restoring sustained and equitable economic growth. The program will also \nprovide further support for Palau\u2019s COVID-19 mitigation measures\u2014initially supported under the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Health Expenditure and Livelihoods Support Program\u2014with the \navailability of assistance having been extended beyond January 2021 (para. 5).2 The program is \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  priorities  of  strengthening  governance  and \ninstitutional capacity, including a differentiated approach to institutional strengthening and private \nsector development in small island developing states (para. 9), and accelerating progress in \ngender equality.3 It is also consistent with the Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020 strategic priorities of \nmanaging risks by promoting sound public sector management and reducing costs by creating a \nmore enabling business environment, as well as with the proposed Pacific Approach 2021\u20132025.4 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Development context. Palau is a small island developing state with a population of about \n18,600 (as of 2019) and a land area of 458 square kilometers. It is the most vulnerable economy \nglobally, based on the United Nations\u2019 Economic Vulnerability Index.5 Recent shocks include \ntyphoons Bopha in 2012 and Haiyan in 2013, a drought in 2016, and COVID-19 impacts in 2020. \nPalau receives grants averaging 9.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) through its Compact of \nFree Association with the United States. Although Palau is classified a high-income economy with \nnominal per capita gross national income of $16,490 in 2019, elevated cost structures stemming \nfrom its remoteness and small domestic market erode purchasing power.6  \n \n4.  Tourism-driven economy hit hard by COVID-19. With annual tourism receipts reaching \nthe equivalent of 36.5%\u201353.4% of GDP during FY2010\u2013FY2019, Palau is among the most \ntourism-driven economies globally. However, the tourism industry has struggled since FY2016. \nFrom a peak of nearly 170,000 tourists in FY2015, arrivals declined to less than 90,000 in \nFY2019.7 The drop was initiated by a drought that affected water supply in hotels and resorts, \n \n1  The lending proposal is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

Official triennial review dataset (accessed 2 March 2020). \n6  Gross national income per capita adjusted for purchasing power parity in 2019 for Palau (19,580, in current \ninternational dollars) was below that of some upper middle-income countries such as Kazakhstan (24,080) and \nMalaysia (28,830). Data are from the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators (accessed 15 March 2021). \n7  Government of Palau. Visitor Arrivals (accessed 19 November 2020). ", "2 \nrestrictions on tour groups from the People\u2019s Republic of China, and subsequent reductions in \nflight services because of weak demand. Amid COVID-19 travel restrictions, arrivals fell by 53% \nto below 42,000 in FY2020 and could plunge to less than 10,000\u2014mostly essential travelers and \nreturning residents\u2014if travel remains restricted until end-FY2021. Because of this prolonged \ntourism downturn, Palau had seen successive economic contractions during FY2016\u2013FY2019, \nexcept  for  FY2018  when  the  economy  was  boosted  by  the  advent  of  high-speed  internet \nservices.8 Early assessments projected economic contractions of 9.5% in FY2020 and 12.8% in \nFY2021.9 The latest assessment of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates a deeper \ncontraction of 10.3% in FY2020, with a further 7.8% decline projected for FY2021.10 However, the \nearly commencement of COVID-19 vaccination in Palau provides an upside to the outlook.11 \n \n5.  Reversal from fiscal surpluses to near-term deficits. Even amid its pre-pandemic \neconomic downturn, Palau demonstrated solid fiscal management by maintaining annual fiscal \nsurpluses averaging 3.0% of GDP during FY2011\u2013FY2019 (footnotes 9, 10, and 12). However, \nbecause of COVID-19 impacts on economic activity, tax collection declined by 25% in FY2020 \nand another 24% drop is expected in FY2021.12 With $20 million in additional spending to mitigate \nadverse impacts on the private sector authorized under the Coronavirus Relief One-Stop Shop \n(CROSS) Program, the IMF estimates that a fiscal deficit equivalent to 11.2% of GDP was \nrecorded in FY2020.13 Another $12 million will be needed to extend CROSS assistance measures \nuntil the end of FY2021, which could push the deficit to 15.7% of GDP during this fiscal year.14 \n \n6.  Sound macroeconomic management underpins positive outlook. Robust macro-\nfiscal management, which helped achieve surpluses before the COVID-19 shock, can facilitate a \nreturn to a positive fiscal position over the medium term when growth resumes in Palau. On \nrevenues, reforms to raise tobacco taxes and departure taxes pushed the tax\u2013GDP ratio up to an \naverage of 20.2% in FY2015\u2013FY2019 from 17.3% in FY2005\u2013FY2014. Similarly, on expenditures, \nPalau has successfully controlled the public sector wage bill, which declined as a share of GDP \nto an average of 14.7% during FY2015\u2013FY2019 from 17.1% during FY2005\u2013FY2014. The IMF \nrecognizes Palau\u2019s record of fiscal prudence, which led to a buildup of government deposits \n(footnote 10). The government saved the bulk of FY2011\u2013FY2019 fiscal surpluses, which resulted \nin the general fund reserve rising to 11.2% of GDP in FY2019.15 In line with the IMF\u2019s projections, \nADB expects the fiscal deficit to fall to 14.4% in FY2022 as growth resumes, and the government \npursues expenditure consolidation measures (including controlling recurrent expenditures).16 \nPublic debt is also projected to be sustainable (para. 27). \n \n8  ADB.

Thus, \nPalau is on track to be among the first countries globally to be mostly vaccinated against COVID-19, which can \nsupport an earlier revival of tourism and a less severe FY2021 economic contraction. \n12 Graduate School USA. 2020.

Details \nof a further extension in availability of assistance are being finalized, to refine existing delivery systems. \n15 In FY2014, the government established a permanent general fund reserve as a fiscal buffer to be drawn on during \nstates of national emergency or periods when projected local revenues fall by more than 5% from the previous year. \n16 Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides more information \non the fiscal outlook. The IMF\u2019s projected FY2022 fiscal deficit is smaller (at 8.7% of GDP) as it does not account for \nanticipated transfers to state governments, whose fiscal buffers have been depleted by the COVID-19 crisis. \n ", "3 \n7.  Key fiscal constraints. The IMF highlights several challenges that the government needs \nto address for fiscal sustainability, especially with the impending expiry of Compact financial \nassistance in FY2024 (para. 3), which are made more critical by the COVID-19 crisis.17 \n(i)  Lack  of  a  medium-term  outlook.  Palau\u2019s  budget  is  missing  a  multiyear \nperspective, with fiscal policy only required to adhere to a legal requirement of \nmaintaining at least a balanced budget for spending financed through the general \nfund. Although a medium-term fiscal strategy (MTFS) was prepared with ADB \ntechnical assistance (TA), this requires updating given COVID-19 pressures.18 \n(ii)  Outdated and inefficient tax regime. Palau\u2019s tax system relies heavily on gross \nrevenue  taxes  and  import  duties,  which  together  account  for  half  of  annual \ncollections. This system is inefficient and distortionary, and discourages private \ninvestment. During FY2015\u2013FY2019, Palau\u2019s tax\u2013GDP ratio was 20.2%, below the \n24.4%\u201329.0% range for other tourism-driven Pacific economies. \n(iii)  Significant transfers to state-owned enterprises and social security funds. \nWith tariffs set below full cost recovery, Palau Public Utilities Corporation (PPUC) \nrequired subsidies averaging $1.5 million (2.3% of recurrent spending) in 5 of the \n7 years from FY2013 to FY2019.19 Further, in FY2019, Palau\u2019s social security \nfunds received transfers totaling $3.7 million (3.4% of recurrent spending) and \nneeds are projected to rise because of substantial unfunded liabilities. \n \n8.  Weak business environment. Although Palau\u2019s private sector contributes about two-\nthirds of annual GDP, weak legal frameworks contribute to low investment\u2014private sector credit \nwas  only  11.9%  of  GDP  during  FY2015\u2013FY2019\u2014and  constrain  growth  in  business  and \nemployment  opportunities.  The  absence  of  unified  rules  and  procedures  for  international \ncommercial arbitration discourages cross-border investment because of perceived risks from \ndomestic dispute resolution mechanisms. Palau\u2019s corporations legislation is also outdated, still \nrequiring incorporators to appear before a clerk of the Supreme Court or a notary to sign \napplication documents, for approval by the President of Palau.20 Further, the absence of a modern \nelectronic corporations registry leads to information gaps that can be exploited by beneficial \nowners of companies for tax avoidance or evasion and for possible money laundering. Moreover, \na framework for public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) is absent. In April 2019, Palau entered its first \nPPP arrangement\u2014for the upgrading and management of a new international airport terminal\u2014\nfacilitated by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. With more PPPs expected in the \nmedium term, including in renewable energy generation, a formal PPP framework will be needed \nto guide the selection, monitoring, and regulation of private sector partners to minimize the \npotential for incurring new contingent liabilities that would add to the government\u2019s debt burden. \nThe government plans to encourage PPPs to expand the revenue base for tax collections. \n \n9.  Reform context. A differentiated approach to supporting public sector reforms is needed \nin small island developing states constrained by limited capacity, including Palau. For policy-\nbased operations, this involves using a programmatic approach with initial actions that lay the \nfoundation for more substantive reforms, interim milestones to sustain momentum and maintain \nthe government\u2019s focus on reform outputs, broad-based engagement while building capacity for \ndeeper reforms, and integration with ADB country activities to reinforce results achievement.21 \n \n17 IMF. 2019.

Previous ADB policy-based operations in Palau demonstrated the need for \n(i) parallel TA to supplement the reform design and implementation capacities in key government \nagencies, and (ii) sustained consultations with stakeholders to mitigate risks of reform delays \namid changes in political leadership.22 Further, lessons from ADB\u2019s implementation of Pacific \nbudget support programs during the 2008\u20132009 global crisis highlight the critical need to support \naggregate demand, while protecting the fiscal position through well-targeted stimulus packages.23 \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n11.  Program description. The government recognizes the need for complementary policy \nreforms to safeguard fiscal sustainability amid the COVID-19 crisis. This is demonstrated in its \ncommitment to (i) implement its MTFS, (ii) adopt a fiscal responsibility act (FRA), and (iii) restart \nthe tax reform process, as expressed in the June 2020 development policy letter for the Health \nExpenditure and Livelihoods Support Program (footnote 2). A policy-based loan is a suitable \nmodality to support the government\u2019s wide-ranging reform agenda. A programmatic approach \nallows for the prioritization and sequencing of policy actions\u2014to account for implementation \ncapacity constraints\u2014while bridging budget support needs to sustain reform momentum. It also \nprovides the flexibility to adapt the reform agenda to emerging opportunities and constraints. \n \n12.  The program aligns with the government\u2019s reform agenda to safeguard Palau\u2019s longer-\nterm fiscal sustainability (para. 11). Both subprograms will support reforms in three areas: \n(i)  the  policy  and  legislative  framework  for  PFM  strengthened;  (ii)  fiscal  risks  from  weak \nmanagement of public revenue, expenditure, and liabilities reduced; and (iii) private sector \ndevelopment supported (Appendix 4). Subprogram 1 lays the foundation for improving fiscal \nsustainability through the introduction of upgraded policy frameworks, guidelines, and plans \n(paras. 15 and 17); the approval of comprehensive reviews and evaluations, with recommended \nreforms (paras. 19 and 20); and the preparation and President\u2019s transmittal of critical legislative \nbills to Palau\u2019s National Congress (Olbiil Era Kelulau [OEK]) for approval (paras. 14, 16, 18, and \n20). Subprogram 2 will build on this foundation by starting to implement refined guidelines and \nplans; adopting reform recommendations from reviews and evaluations; and institutionalizing key \nreforms. The program seeks to include strong reform actions by the government. However, it is \nalso important to ensure that reforms move forward steadily with attention to the achievement of \nmedium-term objectives. To promote this, the program includes a critical administrative action \nthat sets a high-level direction to initiate the strengthening of the legal and regulatory framework \nfor PPPs, which will facilitate increased private sector participation in public service delivery.24 \nReform targets account for implementation capacity constraints, given Palau\u2019s small public \nadministration (para. 9). \n \n13.  Under subprogram 1, ADB supports 10 prior actions, all of which have been completed. \nTen  indicative  triggers  have  been  identified  for  subprogram  2,  for  refinement  based  on \ngovernment priorities and capacity, considering possible continued COVID-19 disruptions. \n \n14.  Reform area 1: Policy and legislative framework for public financial management \nstrengthened. Subprogram 1 supports the development of a bill that sets out the FRA, with \n \n22 ADB\u2019s budget support operations experience in Palau has been limited to ADB. Palau: Water Sector Improvement \nProgram; ADB. Palau: Health Expenditure and Livelihoods Support Program; and ADB. Palau: Palau Public Utilities \nCorporation Reform Program (Subprogram 1). \n23 A summary of economic recovery support programs in the Pacific during the global financial and economic crisis is \nin ADB. 2011. Policy-Based Programs for the Pacific Islands. Policy Brief. Manila. \n24 For subprogram 1, policy action 3.2 (Appendix 4) is considered an administrative action, as establishing a technical \nworking group is a critical step toward developing a robust PPP policy statement under subprogram 2 (para. 20). \n ", "5 \nprovisions for managing public revenue, expenditure, debt, and fiscal buffers. The FRA includes \nprovisions to be reflected in annual national budgets, for (i) maintaining operating expenditures \nwithin medium-term targets; (ii) prioritizing capital spending to upgrade public assets over time; \n(iii) maintaining debt at prudent levels; (iv) preserving the real value of Palau\u2019s Compact Trust \nFund (footnote 17) by establishing investment and withdrawal rules; (v) adopting a modern and \nefficient tax regime suitable for a tourism-based economy; (vi) managing reserves as insurance \ncoverage for cyclical downturns, disasters, and climate change impacts; and (vii) managing fiscal \nrisks from public sector entities, including state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and social security \nfunds. The President has transmitted the bill to the OEK for approval. The FRA prescribes a strict \nprocess for departure from these provisions to allow for flexibility during fiscal shocks. The \ngovernment may deviate from FRA provisions provided that the departure is temporary, with \nreasonable justification and specification of a clear period after which fiscal policy must revert to \nadherence  to  FRA  provisions.  Subprogram  2  will  commence  the  implementation  of  FRA \nprovisions, starting with the inclusion of a new economic and fiscal update section to underpin the \nFY2022 budget. This section will provide a detailed assessment of how the government\u2019s fiscal \nprogram adheres to specific FRA provisions toward safeguarding fiscal sustainability. \n \n15.  Subprogram 1 also supports the preparation of MTFS guidelines that adhere to FRA \nprovisions, which were issued as a presidential directive. The implementation of the guidelines \nwill begin under subprogram 2 through the presentation of an MTFS that applies a multiyear \nbudgeting approach in the FY2022 budget. The MTFS will be refined annually to reflect the \nprevailing macro-fiscal context. Annual budget statements will supplement and update the MTFS. \n \n16.  Reform area 2: Fiscal risks from weak management of public revenue, expenditure, \nand  liabilities  reduced.  Since  COVID-19  requires  substantial  borrowing,  greater  domestic \nresource mobilization, more efficient public spending, and improved debt management are \nneeded to create sufficient fiscal space to service debt. Subprogram 1 supports the design and \ndevelopment of a tax reform package that (i) broadens the revenue base by replacing the general \nimports  tax  with  a  value-added  tax  that  brings  consumption  of  services  into  the  tax  net, \n(ii) eliminates distortions by moving from gross revenue taxation to a net profits tax and replacing \nimport duties for alcohol and tobacco with an excise tax that also applies to local production, \n(iii) promotes equity by adjusting income thresholds for the wages and salaries tax and aligning \nthe net profits tax with the highest marginal tax rates for wages and salaries, and (iv) includes \nactions to help remove barriers to businesses owned by women. The President has transmitted \nthe tax reform package to the OEK for approval. Under subprogram 2, a tax reform committee \nwill be established and operationalized by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), with at least 30% female \nstaff, to oversee tax reform implementation, including the development of implementing rules and \nregulations and the identification of systems upgrading and capacity-building needs. \n \n17.  On expenditures, subprogram 1 supports the MOF in (i) adopting public expenditure \nreprioritization measures during FY2021, including adjustments to the targeting and delivery of \nCOVID-19 assistance, based on recommendations from the FY2020 Economic and Fiscal Review, \nthe first of regular evaluations of budget execution amid the pandemic; and (ii) preparing and \nendorsing a climate-resilient and gender-sensitive national infrastructure investment plan (NIIP), \nprioritizing timely upgrades to and adequate maintenance of existing assets. The NIIP supports \nthe FRA provision of prioritizing capital expenditures to ensure an increase in national net worth. \nSubprogram 2 aims for the implementation of the NIIP, as reflected in annual capital budgets \nstarting in FY2022. Expenditure reprioritization will continue in FY2022 (and beyond, potentially \nsupported by a post-program partnership framework [para. 28], as needed), informed by a \nsuccessive review of evolving COVID-19 impacts and relief measures (footnote 14). \n \n ", "6 \n18.  Subprogram 1 supports the development of a bill for an external debt management \nframework, with provisions for strengthening the review of the fiscal and economic implications of \nnew borrowing, while improving debt transparency. The framework requires the creation of a debt \nmanagement unit responsible for the technical due diligence and debt sustainability analysis \n(DSA) of any proposed borrowing. The President has transmitted the bill to the OEK for approval. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  MOF  will  issue  a  debt  management  policy  that  supports  the \nimplementation of the framework toward ensuring positive societal returns from public borrowing. \n \n19.  The MOF has endorsed the results of an actuarial evaluation of the social security pension \nfund under subprogram 1, including reforms to restore longer-term sustainability. The evaluation \nassesses the adjustments required to restore sustainability in the long-term contribution\u2013benefit \nratio.25 Pressures from the COVID-19 crisis will be considered in developing options to limit \nlegislative action on unfunded benefits. Subprogram 2 targets the transmittal by the President of \na social security reform bill, based on the evaluation\u2019s recommendations, to the OEK for approval. \n \n20.  Reform  area  3:  Private  sector  development  supported.  The  program  supports \nbroadening the revenue base through expanded business opportunities, which are critical for \nfiscal sustainability and long-term growth. Subprogram 1 supports (i) the preparation of an \ninternational arbitration bill, which the President has transmitted to the OEK for approval\u2014\nallowing for and recognizing clauses on the international arbitration of commercial disputes in \nbusiness  contracts  between  local  and  foreign  partners\u2014to  encourage  more  foreign  direct \ninvestment;26 (ii) the creation of an interministerial technical working group through a presidential \ndirective, with guidance on developing a policy statement for a PPP framework to facilitate private \nsector participation in public service delivery;27 and (iii) MOF endorsement of a comprehensive \nreview of the corporations bill, identifying additional provisions including for the development of \nan electronic companies registry that supports increased transparency on beneficial ownership to \nincrease tax compliance and reduce integrity risks. Subprogram 2 aims for the international \narbitration bill to be approved by the OEK and signed into law, as well as the President\u2019s issuance \nof a PPP framework and transmittal to the OEK for the approval of an updated Corporations Bill. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s value addition. The program builds on previous ADB policy-based operations and \npublic sector management TA in Palau.28 It complements concurrent ADB policy-based lending \nsupport for tariff, financial management, and corporate governance reforms in the PPUC that will \nreduce subsidy requirements and contingent liability risks for Palau\u2019s largest SOE (para. 7). \nADB is also mobilizing parallel TA to help advance critical reforms, including for preparing key \npieces of legislation\u2014such as the FRA and the international arbitration bill\u2014and undertaking an \nactuarial study of the social security fund.29 Further TA may be provided in coordination with the \n \n25 In FY2017, an additional $50 per month in benefits was legislated, supported by a government transfer of $2 million \nand an increase in the contribution rates of employers and employees from 6% to 7%. A further $50 per month was \nawarded to beneficiaries in FY2019, but with no compensating increase in rates, leaving the system imbalanced. \n26 The bill is based on model legislation that provides rules and procedures for parties to conduct arbitration. It covers \nall stages of the arbitral process from the arbitration agreement, the composition and jurisdiction of the arbitral \ntribunal, and the extent of court intervention through to the recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award. \n27 The technical working group is composed of members from various divisions of the MOF and the Ministry of Public \nInfrastructure, Industries and Commerce. It was directed by the President to prepare a PPP policy statement that \noutlines the regulatory and legal framework for PPPs in Palau by no later than end-March 2021. \n28 ADB.

Given the change in political leadership in January 2021, following the November 2020 \nelections, ADB consulted closely with both the outgoing and incoming administrations to ensure \nsustained commitment to the reform agenda. The new President fully supports the program, as \nindicated by the new Minister of Finance\u2019s signed Development Policy Letter (Appendix 3). \n \n23.  Development partner coordination. The program was developed in coordination with \nthe IMF to help safeguard macroeconomic stability during the COVID-19 crisis. TA from the \nPFTAC helped the government to assess options for making the tax system more efficient and \nequitable, including an impact analysis of the potential introduction of value-added tax. This led \nto the development of the tax reform package, which is supported under reform area 2 of the \nprogram (para. 16). The PFTAC is supporting parallel tax administration reforms, including \nsystems strengthening for on-time filing and payment as well as the management of tax arrears.30 \nAn IMF assessment letter was received by ADB in January 2021. The government is engaging \nwith other partners, including the World Bank and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, \nfor possible budget support. ADB is in regular dialogue with these development partners. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n24.  The reforms will shift Palau\u2019s economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis toward a more \nsustainable fiscal path. A strengthened policy and legislative framework for PFM will support \nfiscally responsible and strategic budgeting toward efficient allocation of government resources. \nBy reducing fiscal risks and improving the management of public revenue and expenditure, the \ngovernment can generate fiscal space for more productive spending to support recovery. Further \nprivate sector development will help broaden the economic and revenue bases, which, in turn, \nwill contribute to longer-term fiscal sustainability. The impact that the program is aligned with is \nenhanced quality of life for current and future generations of Palauans.31 The subprogram reforms \nwill contribute to this through sequenced policy actions (paras. 14\u201320). The program is expected \nto help reduce the fiscal deficit to 5.5% of GDP or less (from 14.4% of GDP projected in FY2022), \nand raise the tax\u2013GDP ratio to above the pre\u2013COVID-19 average of 20.2% by FY2023. Further, \nthe implementation of reforms of both revenue and expenditure will help the government generate \nsufficient fiscal space to service higher debt levels arising from the COVID-19 crisis.32 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support  \n \n25.  The impacts of COVID-19 restrictions are expected to raise the government\u2019s financing \nneeds significantly, as reflected in projected fiscal deficits of $37.1 million (15.7% of GDP) in \nFY2021 and $37.9 million (14.4% of GDP) in FY2022 (Table 1). Based on these substantial needs, \nthe government has requested program financing of $55 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources. The proposed financing will be disbursed in two subprograms\u2014$25 million in FY2021 \nand $30 million in FY2022. Along with the program supporting PPUC reforms (footnote 19), ADB\u2019s \nbudget support will total $30 million in FY2021 and $35 million in FY2022. \n \n \nInitiative, Phase IV; and ADB.

To help finance subprogram 1, the government has requested (i) a concessional loan of \n$20 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources that will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an interest rate of 2.0% per year during the grace period and thereafter; and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement; and (ii) a regular loan of \n$5 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources that will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nTable 1: Development Financing Needs, FY2019\u2013FY2022 \n  FY2019  FY2020e  FY2021p  FY2022p \n  $  % of  $  % of  $  % of  $  % of \nItem  million  GDP  million  GDP  million  GDP  million  GDP \nRevenues  121.9   43.5   108.7   42.8   95.1   40.2   104.3   39.5  \n  Tax and nontax  76.2   27.2   61.3   24.1   51.3   21.7   61.0   23.1  \n  External grants  45.7   16.3   47.4   18.6   43.8   18.5   43.3   16.4  \nExpenditures  120.9   43.1   137.2   54.0   132.2   55.9   142.2   53.9  \nFiscal balance  1.0   0.3   (28.5)  (11.2)  (37.1)  (15.7)  (37.9)  (14.4) \nFinancing needs  (1.0)  (0.3)  28.5   11.2   37.1   15.7   37.9   14.4  \n  Government deposits    (0.3)  (6.5)  (2.6)  6.5   2.7      \n  ADB CDF      15.0   5.9          \n  ADB HEALS      20.0   7.9          \n  ADB RISES          25.0   10.6   30.0   11.4  \n  ADB PPUC          5.0   2.1   5.0   1.9  \n  Other: TBD          0.6   0.3   2.9   1.1  \nNominal GDP  280.4    254.0    236.6    263.9   \n( ) = negative, ADB = Asian Development Bank, CDF = contingent disaster financing, e = estimate, FY = fiscal year, GDP \n= gross domestic product, HEALS = Health Expenditure and Livelihoods Support, p = projection, PPUC = Palau Public \nUtilities Corporation, RISES = Recovery through Improved Systems and Expenditure Support, TBD = to be determined. \nNotes: \n1.

Debt sustainability. Palau\u2019s public debt is mostly external, with domestic debt equivalent \nto 7.0% of GDP as of FY2019. External public debt fell gradually from 38.3% of GDP in FY2009 \nto 23.1% in FY2015, before a rise to 31.1% in FY2019 amid infrastructure investments supported \nby ADB.33 The onset of the COVID-19 crisis pushed Palau\u2019s public debt\u2013GDP ratio to 57.7% in \nFY2020. Although a further rise in public debt\u2013GDP to 70.9% in FY2021 and a peak of 74.4% in \nFY2022 is projected, ADB\u2019s updated DSA shows that debt will maintain a steady downward trend \nin the medium term as the economy recovers (footnote 16). With sustained recovery, the public \ndebt\u2013GDP ratio can revert below the pre-COVID-19 level by FY2030, even under conservative \neconomic growth assumptions. Further, while total projected borrowing during FY2021 and \nFY2022 will add to debt service obligations, the complementary implementation of fiscal reforms \ncan ensure sufficient resources for annual repayments. Program support to contain fiscal risks \nfrom SOEs and the social security pension fund will also help ensure that contingent liabilities are \nminimized. ADB\u2019s DSA concludes that Palau\u2019s debt remains sustainable and fiscal vulnerabilities \nare contained. These results align with the conclusions of the IMF (footnote 10). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n28.  The MOF will be the executing agency responsible for overall program monitoring, as well \nas the primary implementing agency coordinating progress toward policy actions. Implementing \nagencies include the President\u2019s Office and Office of the Attorney General for preparation of \n \n33 ADB. Palau: Koror\u2013Airai Sanitation Project; and ADB. Palau: North Pacific Regional Connectivity Investment Project. \n ", "9 \nlegislative bills, as well as the Palau Social Security Administration for implementation of reforms \nto ensure long-term sustainability of its pension fund. A program steering committee headed by \nthe Minister of Finance has been established to monitor progress in reform implementation. \nADB regional TA has been mobilized to facilitate the implementation of program policy actions \n(para. 21). The program implementation period is July 2020\u2013July 2022 (subprogram 1: July 2020\u2013\nJuly 2021; subprogram 2: August 2021\u2013July 2022). ADB and the government will discuss a post-\nprogram partnership framework to support the continued implementation of subprogram 2 actions \nbeyond the program. The proceeds of the policy-based loans will be withdrawn in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).34 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n29.  Governance. Palau has a strong recent record of sound fiscal management, as exhibited \nby the achievement of annual fiscal surpluses since FY2011, but the IMF points to broader PFM \naspects that need to be improved over the medium term (para. 7). Although a public expenditure \nand financial accountability (PEFA) self-assessment was conducted in 2013, the results are not \npublicly available and a planned follow-on formal assessment has been delayed. The PFTAC is \npreparing to conduct a streamlined or AgilePEFA, along with pilot-testing of a PEFA climate \nmodule, as indicated in its FY2021 work plan for Palau (footnote 30). These assessments, which \nshould lead to a formal PEFA assessment, will be critical to identify further actions for inclusion in \nan updated PFM reform plan. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government. \n \n30.  Poverty and inequality. With per capita incomes at risk of falling to pre-FY2001 levels in \nreal terms, basic needs poverty could rise from 19.4% of Palau\u2019s population in 2014 to 26.5% by \nthe end of FY2021.35 A strengthened policy and legislative framework for PFM will allow more \nstrategic fiscal planning for efficient allocation of public finances. Reduced fiscal risks from the \nmanagement of public revenue, expenditure, and liabilities will create additional fiscal space that \ncan be harnessed to increase productive public spending, including for basic services and social \nprotection. Private sector development will result in expanded income-generating opportunities. \n \n31.  Gender. The program is classified some gender elements. It ensures more resources in \nthe short term to support disadvantaged groups against COVID-19 crisis impacts and to preserve \nrecent gender equality gains. Actions to reduce fiscal risk and improve public revenue and \nexpenditure management ensure that gender analysis is considered as part of decision-making \nand creates opportunities to support women entrepreneurs: (i) the tax reform bill minimizes \ndisincentives for new and small businesses, including potential and existing women entrepreneurs, \nby moving to a more efficient and equitable net profits tax; (ii) the FY2020 fiscal review includes \ngender analysis of the impacts of cost-saving measures and gender-sensitive lessons for national \nbudgets, particularly in light of COVID-19 impacts; and (iii) the MOF has approved an NIIP that \nincludes processes to ensure that women\u2019s needs and priorities are considered in the prioritization \nand selection of projects. Further measures to support gender equality outcomes will be pursued \nfor subprogram 2, including the collection of sex-disaggregated data in PFM systems to support \ninitial gender-responsive budgeting actions and through an electronic companies registry. \n \n32.  Safeguards. Based on an evaluation of the potential impacts of supported policy actions, \nthe  program will  not  result  in any  adverse  consequences  for  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, or indigenous peoples. In line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the \nprogram is classified category C for environment, involuntary settlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \n34 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Government of Palau. 2019.
