The  proposed  Project  will  finance  the  Government\u2019s  expanded \ncompensatory  safety-net  programs  for  the  consumption  and  production  of \nfood by the poor and vulnerable in selected rural areas of seven provinces \nin the Tonle Sap Basin, and in selected urban slums of Phnom Penh.  \n \nThe  Project  will  have  three  components:  (i)  compensatory  consumption \n(iii)  capacity \nsupport, \ndevelopment  for  emergency  response  to  the  food  crisis  and  project \nmanagement.  \n \nThe expected major activities supported by the project will include \n\n(ii)  productivity  enhancement  support,  and \n\n \n\n(i)   \n\n(ii)   \n\n(iii)  \n\n(iv)  \n\n(v)   \n\n(vi)  \n\n(vii)  \n\n(viii) \n\n(Beungkok,  Stung  Meanchey,  and \n\nfree  distribution  of  rice  to  the  most  vulnerable  population \ngroups in the Tonle Sap Basin;  \nlimited food distribution (cash transfer or voucher system) to \nthe poor and vulnerable for food purchase in urban slums of \nPhnom  Penh \nthe \nRiverside);  \nprovision  of  food  for  the  Government\u2019s  school  feeding  and \ntake home ration programs, to benefit students in grades 1\u2013 \n4 and families of selected girl students in grades 4\u20136;   \nprovision  of  food  to  children  in  selected  early  childhood \nlearning centers (ECLCs);  \ncreation  of  employment  for  the  landless  and  low-income \nhouseholds through a food-for-work program;  \nprovision  of  appropriate  seed  and  fertilizer  for  small  and \nmarginal  farmers  whose  capacity  to  purchase  inputs  has \nbeen significantly eroded by price increases; \ndevelopment  of  a  system  for  emergency  food  security \nreserve and rapid response; and \nstrengthening of the capacity of implementing agencies.    \n  \n\nRationale \n\n \n\nCambodia  has  been  badly  affected  by  soaring  food  prices.  The  domestic \nprice of rice and fertilizer has doubled over past year, while meat and fish \nprices have increased 30%\u201360%. The rice price increase has accentuated \n\n\fii \n\nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nProject \nInvestment Plan  \n \n\nthe  vulnerability  of  food  deficit  households,  including  the  urban  poor.  In \naddition, input price increases threaten immediate future food production as \nfarmers reduce fertilizer use, thereby reducing paddy yield, which is one of \nthe  lowest  in  Asia  even  in  the  best  years.  Gasoline  price  increases  have \nincreased  the  cost  of  transport,  processing,  and  water  pumping  for \nirrigation.  Consequently,  poverty  and  hunger  have  increased;  migration  to \nurban  areas  and  movement  of  people  across  the  borders  (Thailand  and \nViet Nam) have also increased. School attendance has declined as children \nare  reportedly  joining  the  workforce  in  order  to  help  families,  and  in  some \ncases  have  stopped  coming  to  classes  because  of  the  discontinuation  of \nthe  school  feeding  program.  Some  families  are  selling  land  and  other \nassets to buy food and necessities. Home-based crafts are on the decline \nbecause raw material prices have escalated.  \n \nThe  rate  of  inflation  has  been  accelerated  by  the  combined  effects  of  the \nsurge  in  the  price  of  food,  inputs,  and  fuel.  The  situation  has  created \nadditional  demands  on  the  Government\u2019s  limited  revenue  base,  and \nthreatened  the  livelihood  of  millions  of  vulnerable  Cambodians.  The \nGovernment  recognizes  the  need  to  immediately  strengthen  safety-net \nprograms for the most vulnerable population to cope with the drastic rise in \ntheir food bills. It has released 300 tons (t) of rice onto the open market in \norder to bring down rice prices. In addition, the Government has contributed \n4,000  t  of  rice  to  the  World  Food  Programme  feeding  program,  including \nschool  feeding.  It  is  under  these  dire  circumstances  that  the  Government \nhas  requested  emergency  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) to augment its ongoing efforts and help offset some of the short-term \nhuman costs of this exogenous shock.  \n \nThe proposed Project is an integral part of the overall commitment made by \nADB in May 2008 at its Annual General Meeting in Madrid, Spain to provide \nassistance to countries hit hard by food price rises. Those most vulnerable \nto  food  price  shocks  need  to  be  protected  from  nutritional  deprivation, \nerosion of their real purchasing power, and asset alienation. It is proposed \nthat  the  project  financing  should  be  covered  by  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and \nEmergency Assistance Policy to support urgent mitigation measures by the \nGovernment in order to tackle the food price crisis.  \n \nThe  expected  impact  is  reduced  vulnerability  of  food-insecure  households \nin Cambodia. The expected outcome is improved access to sufficient food \nand  production  inputs  by  food-poor  Cambodians  in  the  target  provinces. \nThe Project will improve the food security of an estimated 500,000 poor and \nvulnerable  people  affected  by  higher  food  prices.  Food  intake  by  the  poor \nwill  increase,  while  the  lowest  quintile  of  farmers  (the  poorest  20%  of  the \nnational  population)  will  be  able  to  increase  food  production.  Employment \nand income of households with limited purchasing power will increase. The \nProject  will  reduce  poverty  of  low-income  groups,  and  will  strengthen  the \ncapacity  of  the  Government  institutions  involved  in  emergency  food \nassistance. The focus of the Project will be on improving access of the poor \nto  food,  income,  and  livelihood  support.  The  Project  will  assist  in  relieving \nfiscal pressures caused by a sharp rise in safety-net program expenditure.  \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $40.08 million, including \ntaxes and duties of $3.54 million. \n\n\f \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n  \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting \nAgency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $17.50  million  equivalent  in \nspecial drawing rights and a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $17.50 \nmillion, both from its Special Fund resources, in order to finance 87.32% of \nthe total Project cost. The Government will provide $5.08 million (12.68% of \nthe  total  Project  cost)  to  finance  taxes  and  duties  of  $3.54  million  and \nrecurrent costs of $1.54 million. The loan portion will carry an interest rate \nof 1% per year, a maturity of 40 years and a grace period of 10 years, with \nrepayment of principle at 2% per year for the first 10 years after the grace \nperiod, and 4% per year thereafter. Interest charges on the loan are to be \ncapitalized. \n\n($ million) \n\nSource \n Asian Development Bank ADF Grant \n Asian Development Bank ADF Loan \n Government of Cambodia \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n17.50 \n17.50 \n5.08 \n40.08 \n\nPercent \n43.66 \n43.66 \n12.68 \n100.00 \n\n \nCambodia  is  eligible  for  an  Asian  Development  Fund  grant.  Its  fiscal  and \nforeign  exchange  resources  plus  its  donor  funds  are  inadequate  to  meet \nthe  required  wide-ranging  emergency  support  arising  from  soaring  food, \ninput, and energy prices. Cambodia\u2019s debt sustainability analysis suggests \nthe  necessity  to  channel  a  significant  portion  of  development  assistance \ninto grants for years to come. \n \n1 October 2008 to 30 September 2011 \n\n31 March 2011 \n\n \nMinistry of Economy and Finance (MEF) \n\n \n\n \nThe  project  will  utilize  existing  effective  delivery  mechanisms  and \ninstitutions,  and  enhance  their  capacity,  as  appropriate.  MEF  will  be  the \nexecuting agency of the Project. The proposed implementing agencies  will \nbe  (i)  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries  (MAFF)  for  the  seed \nand  fertilizer  assistance;  (ii)  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  (MRD)  for  the \nfood-for-work  program;  (iii)  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology \n(MOWRAM)  for  the  food-for-work  program;  (iv)  the  Ministry  of  Commerce \n(MOC) for the emergency food security system; (v) National Committee for \nDisaster  Management  (NCDM)  and  provincial  committee  for  disaster \nfor  overall  coordination,  management,  and \nmanagement \ndistribution  of  food  and  input  assistance,  and  establishment  of  the \nemergency  food  security  reserve  and  rapid  response  system;  (vi)  Ministry \nof Education, Youth and Sports (MOEYS) for the school feeding program; \n(vii) Ministry of Women Affairs (MOWA) for the ECLC feeding program; and \n(vii)  commune  councils  and  village  development  committees \nfor \nidentification of target groups and distribution of food and inputs. \n \nThe  National  Food  Security  Task  Force,  headed  by  MEF,  with \n\n(PCDM) \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\nrepresentation  from  concerned  Government  ministries  and  agencies  and \nkey  development  partners,  will  provide  overall  policy  guidance  to  Project \nimplementation.  A  central  project  management  unit,  led  by  a  Project \ndirector,  will  be  established  at  MEF  to  oversee  daily  implementation. \nProvincial  project  management  units  (PPMUs)  will  be  established  at  the \nPCDM in all seven Project provinces. Interdepartmental coordination will be \nassured  by  NCDM  at  the  central  level,  and  by  PCDM  (chaired  by  the \nprovincial governor) at the provincial level. \n \nProject  funds  will  flow  from  ADB  to  MEF,  which  will  establish  a  project \nimprest account at the Cambodian National Bank. Funds will flow to various \nimplementing agencies to finance activities they are individually responsible \nfor. Each PPMU will establish a second-generation imprest account at the \nCambodian  National  Bank.  ADB  will  audit  the  use  of  the loan  proceeds  in \naccordance with its fiduciary responsibilities and verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification.  \n \nThe Project will entail procurement of rice, seeds, fertilizers, vehicles, office \nequipment, and a large number of community-based civil works under the \nfood-for-work  program.  All  procurement  to  be  financed  under  the  Project \nwill  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Retroactive financing for a maximum \nof 30% of the total loan, grant, and technical assistance (TA) amounts will \nbe considered for eligible expenditure if incurred not earlier than 22 August \n2008 and provided that the expenditure is in compliance with the following \nconditions:  (i)  it  is  in  accordance  with  acceptable  procedures  specified  by \nADB,  (ii)  it  is  verified  by  ADB,  (iii)  it  is  certified  by  MEF,  and  (iv)  the \ncertification  is  acceptable  to  ADB.  ADB  will  audit  the  use  of  the  loan \nproceeds  in  accordance  with  its  requirements  on  fiduciary  management \nand control, and verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. The \nGovernment  has  been  advised  by  ADB  that  provision  of  retroactive \nfinancing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  any  part  of  the  Project.  The \nborrower  will  review  the  relevant  agency\u2019s  capacity  to  ensure  compliance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Flexible  procedures  pursuant  to  the \nprovisions under ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines will be adopted. \n \nThe proposed Project will enhance Cambodia\u2019s capacity to respond to food \nemergencies  and  cope  with \nincrease.  The \nGovernment will be able to expand its modest safety-net programs, which \ncould not be put in place due to severe budget constraints. The nutritional \nstatus of the Cambodian people will improve. This is particularly crucial for \nthe  people  who  are  chronically  vulnerable  and  are  therefore  at  risk  of \nundernutrition and malnutrition. Groups that are likely to benefit most from \nthe Project are landless households, daily casual laborers, female-headed \nlike \nhouseholds, \ntuberculosis and AIDS), the lowest quintile of farmers (the poorest 20% of \nthe  national  population),  family  fishers,  ethnic  minority  groups,  vulnerable \nschool children,  pregnant  and  lactating  mothers,  fixed-salary  workers,  and \nurban  slum  dwellers.  Rice  production  will  increase;  increased  production \nwill  come  from  area  expansion  and  yield  increase  due  to  improved  rice \nseeds,  fertilizer,  and  irrigation  facilities.  The  food-for-work  program  will \ngenerate  the  much-needed  employment  for  vulnerable  households  and \ncreate  community  assets.  Improved  market  links  will  aid  marketing  and \n\n(physical  and  chronic \n\nthe  handicapped \n\nfood  price \n\nthe  global \n\nillnesses \n\n\f \nRisks and \nMitigations \n\nincrease  family  cash  incomes.  The  food  price  crisis  has  highlighted  the \npoint  that  the  natural  resources  of  Cambodia\u2014land,  water,  forests,  and \nfisheries\u2014must  be  conserved  and  used  in  a  sustainable  way  in  order  to \nenhance food security for all Cambodians and to improve the quality of life. \nGovernment,  nongovernment,  and  civil  society  organizations  will  become \nbetter equipped to deal with any food crisis in the future, especially in terms \nof  reducing  human  suffering.  Budget  management  will  be  improved  in \nterms of prioritization and activity expansion in a sustainable way. \n \nCapacity  of  the  people  at  the  grassroots  level  to  help  themselves  will  be \nenhanced.  There  will  be  greater  synergy  between  various  development \ninterventions.  This,  together  with  the  coordinated  donor  response  to  the \nfood  price  crisis,  will  have  greater  multiplier  effects.  Collaboration  among \ngovernment  and  nongovernment  organizations  will  increase,  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  deconcentration  and  decentralization  policy  may  receive \nadded  impetus.  Positive  macroeconomic  impact  will  flow  from  reduced \ninflationary pressures, which threaten Cambodia\u2019s growth prospects. About \n500,000  residents,  or  89,000  households,  living  in  and  around  the  Tonle \nSap  Basin  will  benefit  from  the  proposed  project  assistance.  The  use  of \nquality seed and fertilizer, combined with extension advice on their optimal \nuse,  will  open  the  door  for  longer-term  productivity  growth  and  enhanced \nfood supply. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  social  safety-net  programs  for  protecting  the  poor  and \nvulnerable  groups  are  underdeveloped,  and  relevant  institutions  are  weak \nin  their  capacity  to  run  the  social  safety-net  programs.  The  concept  of  a \nfood  security  reserve  system  is  relatively  new  to  the  country,  and \nconcerned institutions lack operational skills and management experience. \nThe Project design provides for addressing these institutional weaknesses \nthrough  one  of  the  Project  outputs  (component  3,  Capacity  Development \nfor Food Crisis and Project Management). The component scope provides \nfor \n(ii) \nestablishment of a system of emergency food reserve and rapid response, \nand  (iii)  strengthening  of  the  capacity  of  the  executing  agency  and \nimplementing agencies. \n \nThe  governance  of  the  program  will  have  built-in  transparency  and \naccountability, with output monitoring and independent evaluation of effects \nand  impact.  The  Project  and  attached  TA  include  definitive  fiduciary \noversight of the funds provided and disbursed.  \n \nImmediate procurement program may at risk if there is a shortage of grain, \nseed,  and  fertilizer  for  purchase  domestically,  in  which  case  prices  are \nlikely  to  rise.  This  risk  can  be  mitigated  by  staggering  the  purchase  of \ngrains  and  extensive  canvassing  among  potential  suppliers  to  ensure \nadequate supply at reasonable price both within the Project provinces and \nother surplus localities. Given that seed supply sources in the country  are \nlimited,  AQIP  Seed  Company  has  been  identified  as  the  main  supplier  of \nseed,  and  provision  has  been  made  for  direct  procurement  of  seed  from \nseed  producers  associations,  if  needed,  for  distribution  to  target  farmers. \nSince the divestment of the national agricultural inputs supply company, the \nprivate  sector  has  successfully  evolved  as  the  importer  and  supplier  of \nfertilizer to local markets across the country.  \n\nindependent  monitoring  system, \n\n(i)  establishment  of  an \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLinking  of  short-term  safety-net  programs  with  long-term  productivity \nimprovement measures will be a challenge, as it will require speedy design \nand  implementation  of  investment  projects  by  a  multitude  of  Government \nagencies  whose  capacity  is  limited.  The  Government  recognizes  the \nchallenge and has initiated actions to accelerate implementation of ongoing \nprojects aimed at production improvement and livelihood development. The \nGovernment has also attached priority to the pipeline projects of its bilateral \nand multilateral development partners that will target rural development and \npoverty reduction.  \n \nThe success of the Project relies on effective community mobilization in the \nproper identification and selection of target groups. The Project will mobilize \nlocal  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  to  supervise  and  monitor \ntarget-group  selection,  and  distribute  food  and  inputs.  A  grievance \nmechanism  will  be  set  up  by  the  executing  agency  to  address  public \ngrievance with regard to procurement and distribution irregularities.  \n \nDue  to  the  large  volume  of  emergency  food  to  be  distributed,  there  are \npotential  risks  in  the  areas  of  storage  and  distribution.  Enhancement  of \npublic  sector  food  storage  capacity  is  now  a  priority  for  the  Government, \nand it has taken steps to establish emergency food warehouses in strategic \nlocations.  The  Government  is  currently  working  with  the  rice  millers \nassociation  and  Green  Trade  to  use  their  storage  facilities.  The  Project \nprocurement  system  will  include  delivery  to  the  commune  distribution \npoints. Commune council buildings and facilities will be used for temporary \nstorage prior to distribution to villages. \n \n \nAn  attached  TA  project  of  $1.6  million  will  accompany  the  Project  to \nstrengthen  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  deal  with  food  crisis  and  related \nemergencies  with  the  involvement  of  MAFF,  MRD,  MOWRAM,  MOC, \nNCDM,  PCDM,  and  commune  councils.  ADB  will  finance  the  TA  of  $1.5 \nmillion on a grant basis from its TA funding program, and the Government \nwill  contribute  $100,000.

The surge in food prices since early 2008 has caused the \n2. \nworld food situation to take a dramatic turn, impacting the poor and vulnerable people who spend a \nsubstantial  part  of  their  income  on  food.  Many  countries  are  facing  the  challenge  of  sharp \nincreases  in  food  and  fuel  prices  threatening  macroeconomic  stability  and  overall  growth.  Poor \nhouseholds in the cities, smallholders, landless and marginal farmers who are net food buyers, and \nnonfood producers in rural areas who spend a large share of their incomes on food, are the most \nadversely affected.  \n \nFalling  stocks  of  food  grains  (such  as  rice  and  wheat),  growing  imbalance  in  supply  and \n3. \ndemand  due  to  rising  demand  for  food,  and  unilateral  trade  policy  measures  undertaken  by \ncountries to ensure domestic food availability, have exacerbated price instability on world markets \nand threatened global food security. From mid-2007 to early 2008, international food prices soared \ndrastically. The price of rice almost doubled (98%), wheat rose by 130%, and maize by 38%; meat \nprices have increased by about 40% during this period. The situation has been compounded by the \ndoubling  or  more  than  doubling  of  fertilizer  prices  in  2007,  followed  by  the  almost  doubling  of  oil \nprices. While the price pressure has eased a bit in the international market, the general consensus \nis that the high price regime of inputs and outputs is here to stay, pushing up the inflation rate with \nconsequent negative implications for economic growth.  \n \n4. \nIn the current situation of high food prices, providing emergency assistance and supporting \nagricultural  productivity  enhancement  and  income  earning  by  food-insecure  people  are  the  main \nmeans  to  reduce  hunger  and  ensure  an  improved  world  food  situation.  Protecting  the  most \nvulnerable  people  in  rural  and  urban  areas  will  require  targeted  direct  food  distribution,  food \nsubsidies,  cash  transfers,  and  nutrition  programs,  including  school  feeding.  Strengthening  social \nprotection  is  especially  important  for  vulnerable  groups,  including  children,  pregnant  women,  the \nHIV infected, and the elderly. As a short-term response, support for boosting local food production \nis urgently needed. These measures should include the distribution to small-scale farmers of seed, \nfertilizer,  animal  feed,  and  other  inputs  through  vouchers  or  other  forms  of  subsidies.  If \nimplemented effectively, such programs are expected to (i) increase supply in poor countries and, \nthus,  improve  food  availability;  and  (ii)  increase  the  income  of  small  producers.  They  may  also \nreduce price increases in local markets.  \n \nThe UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Bank, ADB, International Fund for \n5. \nAgricultural  Development  (IFAD),  and  many  others  have  called  for  urgent  and  immediate \nassistance  for  social  safety-net  and  production  enhancement  programs.  FAO  has  called  for  $1.7 \nbillion  to  provide  low-income  food-deficit  countries  with  rice  seeds,  fertilizers,  and  other  inputs  to \nboost  production.  ADB  has  pledged  to  provide  $0.5  billion  in  immediate  support  to  member \ncountries  on  a  priority  basis  in  2008,  and  an  additional  $1  billion  in  2009  to  support  medium-  to \nlong-term investment in agricultural and rural development. \n\n \n\n\f2  \n \n \nCambodian Gross Domestic Product Growth. Cambodia has experienced continued and \n6. \nsignificant  economic  growth  in  recent  years,  but  growth  of  the  agriculture  and  natural  resources \n(ANR)  sector  has  lagged  and  it  has  been  fluctuating  widely  depending  on  variations  in  weather \npatterns  and  occurrence  of  natural  calamities.  The  importance  of  the  ANR  sector  in  the \ndevelopment process for poverty reduction and food security, and the need for a holistic approach \nto  rural  development,  is  reinforced  by  the  food  price  crisis.  Total  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \ngrew steadily at an average annual rate of nearly 10%, ranging between 6.6% and 13.3%, during \n2001\u20132007; the corresponding rate for agriculture was 5.8%, fluctuating between \u20132.5% and 15%. \nFluctuations  in  agricultural  growth  performance,  coming  mainly  from  the  crops  sector  (especially \npaddy) will have implications for household food security, and can exacerbate the poverty situation \nfurther  in  the  absence  of  alternative  employment  opportunities.  The  modest  single-digit  inflation \nrate of the early 2000s has more than trebled to a record rate of 18.7% in January 2008, according \nto  unofficial  estimates  of  the  National  Institute  for  Statistics;  the  inflation  rate  has  now  exceeded \n25%, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Higher international oil and food prices, \nhigher prices of imported goods due to the depreciation of the riel and dollar, and very high growth \nin commercial bank lending are the main sources of inflation in Cambodia. The annual food price \ninflation  of  24%,  combined  with  slowing  garment  exports  due  to  weaker  external  demand  and \nheightened regional competition, led the IMF to reduce GDP growth projections for 2008 from 9.5% \nto 7%.1 The Government has undertaken a number of measures, including credit control by raising \nreserve requirements, to curb inflation. \n \n7. \nThe Food Price Crisis and Implications for Cambodia. As a result of the unprecedented \nincrease  in  food  and  fuel  prices,  Cambodian-marketed  paddy  has  quickly  found  its  way  to \nneighboring  countries  lured  by  relatively  high  prices.  Cambodian  farmers,  many  of  whom  sell \npaddy  right  after  harvest  under  compulsion  to  pay  back  loans  taken  from  moneylenders  and \ntraders,  have  benefited  little  from  the  rise  in  international  prices.  On  the  contrary,  these  farmers, \nalong  with  other  food  deficit  families,  had  to  buy  rice  on  the  domestic  market  at  a  much  higher \nprice.  Across  the  country,  85%  of  the  population  live  in  rural  areas,  40%  of  the  households  are \nlandless or land poor, and nearly 60% of total household expenditure is for food. Over one third of \nthe  rural  population  lives  under  the  poverty  line.  The  consequences  of  rising  prices  of  food  and \nagricultural  production  inputs  have  been  severe  for  poorer  households  and  smallholder  farmers. \nThe situation has triggered the sale of household assets, increased the taking out of high-interest \nloans  (exacerbating  the  debt  trap),  decreased  school  attendance,  and  increased  child  labor,  and \nresulted in internal migration pressure. \n \nHousehold food stocks are declining. The lack of exchange entitlement2 is a major source \n8. \nof concern for the vulnerable population in rural and urban areas. The Tonle Sap Basin provinces \nhave been adversely hit by the crisis, since most people of this region either have small agricultural \nholdings (less than 1 hectare [ha]) or very limited sources of cash income. Rice is the main staple \nfood  item  in  Cambodia  and  constitutes  50%  of  the  total  food  consumption  of  poor  families.  The \nhigh price of rice will impact poverty reduction efforts, and it was predicted that a 10% increase in \nthe  rice  price  would  increase  the  national  poverty  rate  by  0.5%3  (in  both  rural  and  urban  areas). \nThe increase in rice prices has pushed up the food poverty line, resulting in a substantial addition \nto  the  population  below  the  food  poverty  line.  Persistence  of  this  situation  could  lead  to \nmacroeconomic  turmoil  if  it  is  not  properly  handled  through  effective  urgent  measures,  and  will \n\n                                                \n \n1  IMF. 2008. Statement by IMF Staff Mission. Press Release 08/137. Cambodia. (6 June). \n2 \u201cA person\u2019s exchange entitlement for food is the amount of food the person already owns or can acquire using what the \nperson does own (including labor power) for production and trade.\u201d Sen, A. 1981. Poverty and Famines - An Essay on \nEntitlement and Deprivation. Oxford, 257.  \n\n3  World Bank. 2008. Development Research Group Implications of High Global Food Prices for Poverty in Low Income \n\nCountries. Washington DC. \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n \n\n3\n\nexacerbate  hunger  and  malnutrition  among  the  food-poor  population  (2.6  million),  comprising  the \nurban poor, economic migrants and their families, fixed-income people, wage workers, landless or \nland poor, poor rural families, and families affected by HIV.  \n \n9. \nThe Longer-Term Burden of Poverty and Hunger. Cambodia mirrors the global image of \nunderinvestment in agriculture. Degradation of the natural resource base, misallocation in the use \nof land, declining household food stocks, and lack of exchange entitlement of the poor, combined \nwith a host of cyclical and long-term factors, have affected the supply and demand and prices, and \npushed  millions  of  people  into  the  food  poverty  trap.  Paddy  rice  production  increased  from  3.5 \nmillion  t  in  1996  to  about  6.73  million  t  in  2007.  The  milled  rice  surplus  was  estimated  at  1.64 \nmillion t in 2007 (Appendix 2). Much of the marketed surplus finds its way across the border to Viet \nNam and Thailand unprocessed. However, this surplus does not mean absence of hunger among \nvulnerable  groups  during  the  wet  season  (July\u2013November),  when  household  food  reserves  and \nmarket supply are at their lowest, and income sources in rural areas are limited.  \n \n10. \nThe Government\u2019s efforts to maintain steady macroeconomic growth and stability are being \nhampered by the need to support the poor and vulnerable groups through feeding programs and \nincome support programs. Due to the high cost of food and budgetary stress, Cambodia\u2019s children \nfeeding  program  has  been  substantially  scaled  down,  and  this  is  already  affecting  school \nattendance  and  child  health.  The  World  Food  Programme  (WFP)  has  asked  for  help,  as  its \nresources are inadequate to continue with the feeding program for schoolchildren given the rising \nprice of food, and the necessity to expand its safety-net programs in the country. About 2.6 million \nCambodians were food-poor in 2004 on the basis of the food poverty line of $0.50 per capita per \nday,  according  to  WFP.  The  increase  in  rice  prices  has  pushed  up  the  food  poverty  line  and \npushed down the exchange entitlement, resulting in a substantial addition to the population below \nthe  food  poverty  line.  Rural  poverty  in  Cambodia  is  embedded  in  slow  and  variable  growth  of \nagriculture  and  the  low  level  of  rural  sector  development,  causing  persistent  low  incomes, \nincreasing inequality of income, food insecurity, asset alienation, and marginalization. \n \nIn Cambodia, population groups at risk from the sharp increase in food prices are landless \n11. \nhouseholds,  daily  casual  laborers,  female-headed  households,  the  handicapped  (those  with \nphysical and chronic illnesses such as tuberculosis and AIDS), the lowest quintile of farmers (the \npoorest 20% of the national population), fisher families, ethnic minority groups, vulnerable school \nchildren, pregnant and lactating mothers, fixed-salary workers, and migrant families. These groups \ninclude (i) the chronically vulnerable, who lack adequate access to food throughout the year; (ii) the \nseasonally vulnerable, who lack access to food during the lean season (August\u2013November) when \nhousehold  reserves  and  market  supply  of  rice  are  at  their  lowest;  and  (iii)  others  who  may  be \nperiodically  vulnerable  due  to  sudden  increases  in  food  prices,  such  as  the  one  currently \nexperienced.  The  sudden  spike  in  food  prices  has  significantly  deepened  suffering  of  groups  (i) \nand  (ii),  and  has  added  group  (iii)  to  the  pool  of  the  food  insecure,  creating  an  unprecedented \nemergency. Cambodia lacks the means to deal with the underlying cyclical and structural factors \ncausing the food emergency. \n \n12. \nInstitutional  Inadequacies  to  Deal  with  Food  Insecurity  and  Emergency.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  long-term  strategy  for  food  security,  which  is  to  provide  local  grain  storage  and \nreduce  post-harvest  losses  at  the  farm  gate,  is  yet  to  be  realized.  Limited  private  and  public \nstorage  and  processing  capacity  is  a  major  constraint  in  dealing  with  seasonal  production \nfluctuations.  Consequently,  parts  of  the  country  still  experience  food  deficits  due  to  production \nshortfalls as well as distribution and infrastructure constraints. In the absence of an effective and \nfunctioning emergency procurement system or strategic reserve to deal with the food crisis, WFP \nand other donors have worked with the National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM) to \ndevelop  modest  capacity  for  procurement,  transport,  storage,  and  distribution  of  food  at  the \n\n \n\n\f4  \n \nnational, provincial, district, and local levels. However, due to resource constraints, progress in this \nregard  has  been  modest.  The  food  price  crisis  has  strained  WFP  resources  and  reduced  its \ncoverage.  The  impact  of  any  cutback  of  WFP's  budget,  and  the  absence  of  substantial \nGovernment and other development partner food assistance programs, will be more severe in the \nTonle Sap Basin where there is a high concentration of food-insecure people,   \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nFood Price Shocks \n\n  \n13. \nHigh  food  prices  have hit  the  poor  and  food-insecure  households  the hardest.  In some  of \nthe provinces, more than half of the rural households suffer from food deficit during any given year, \nand this percentage has increased. Field data suggests that the proportion of hungry households is \nat  an  all-time  high  of  one  third  or  more.  Higher  food  prices  have  led  families  to  reduce  their \nconsumption, and there is real danger of widespread undernutrition as the country moves into the \nlean  production  season  over  the  August\u2013November  period.  Food  assistance  must  reach  food-\ndeprived families at the earliest possible time. In order to fill the rice gap, families' diets may also \nbecome  less  diversified  (meat  and  fish  consumption  has  declined),  raising  the  specter  of \nmalnutrition, which is a problem in Cambodia among children, women, and the poor, even at the \nbest of times. As an importer of beef, chicken, pork, and cooking oil, Cambodia has suffered from \nsoaring  food  prices.  As  a  dollarized  economy,  Cambodia  also  received  a  shock  from  the  recent \ndollar depreciation, which made non-dollar-denominated imports more costly.  \n \n14. \nDomestic  prices  of  rice  have  doubled  over  the  past  year,  as  has  the  price  of  fertilizer.  In \nsome provinces fertilizer prices have trebled; seed prices have gone up by an average of 50% or \nmore,  and  meat  and  fish  prices  have  increased  by  30%\u201360%.  Notwithstanding  the  Government \nsubsidy, gasoline prices have nearly doubled. The increase in the price of rice has accentuated the \nvulnerability  of  food  food  deficit  households,  including  the  urban  poor.  At  the  same  time,  the \nstability in the food supply at the farm household level in the coming season(s) is being hampered \nby the high prices of inputs. Input price increases threaten immediate food production, as farmers \ncan no longer afford to buy the required quantities of fertilizers. Reduced fertilizer use is likely to \nreduce  paddy  yield,  particularly  for  the  poor  and  marginal  farmers.  Fuel  price  increases  have,  at \nthe same time, increased the cost of transport, processing, and water pumping for irrigation. The \nreduced  paddy  yield  will  reduce  both  household  and  market  supplies  of  rice,  increase  price \nvolatility,  and  affect  the  rural  economy  of  Cambodia,  which  already  suffers  from  many  structural \nfactors hindering the growth of the agriculture sector. \n \nVulnerability  of  the  food-poor  Cambodians  arises  not  only  from  export  of  rice  immediately \n15. \nafter  the  harvesting  season  and  the  existence  of  pockets  of  hunger,  but  also  from  the  lack  of \nprocessing  and  storage  capacity  in  the  country.  The  Government  does  not  have  an  emergency \nprocurement system or a strategic reserve large enough to deal with a potential food crisis. Rice \ntraders and millers lack capital and banks do not extend adequate finance to them to build private \nstorage and processing capacity. Vietnamese and Thai traders can come in and purchase paddy in \nbulk.  Hence  the  paradox  of  food  deficit  in  a  country  that  potentially  has  surplus.  The  situation  is \nmost  acute  at  the  household  level,  where  a  combination  of  debt  burden  and  inadequate  storage \ncapacity forces families (food surplus or deficit) to sell much of the grain immediately after harvest. \nThey  buy  back  food  later  in  the  season  at  a  much  higher  price  and  thus  remain  extremely \nvulnerable to any sharp rise in food prices. Chronic and seasonally food-insecure families become \neven more insecure and suffer nutritional deprivation, while food surplus or potentially food surplus \nfamilies become food insecure. Their plight is further aggravated by the tendency of local traders to \nhoard paddy and/or rice through the harvest season and well into the lean season in order to gain \nmaximum price.  \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n5\n\nPoverty and Macroeconomic Impacts  \n\n2. \n \n16. \nPoverty  Impact.  As  in  other  Asian  countries,  high  food  prices  are  undermining  gains  in \npoverty  reduction  efforts  in  Cambodia.  The  percentage  of  the  population  below  the  poverty  line \ndeclined between the mid-1990s and 2004, but the trend seems to have been reversed in recent \nmonths due to the slow growth of the agriculture sector and food and input price rises. Food and \nenergy  accounts  for  a  disproportionately  large  share  of  total  household  expenditure\u2014up  to  80% \nand above in rural Cambodia. More than 6 million poor people are vulnerable to food and energy \nprice increases. The extent of price increase over the last one year suggests that an additional 2 \nmillion  people  may  have  slipped  below  the  poverty  line,  while  the  existing  poor  have  been \nexperiencing deeper poverty. This is in line with findings from simulation models of the Philippines \nand  Pakistan,  and  is  similar  to  the  experience  of  Bangladesh.  In  consultation  with  the  provincial \nauthorities and commune council leaders, ADB has assessed the poverty rate in the rural areas of \nseven  selected  provinces  at  38%,  which  is  higher  that  than  the  estimated  35%  in  the  2004 \nsocioeconomic  survey.  In  Cambodia,  due  to  the  increase  in  rice  prices,  many  families  have \nreduced  their  usual  three  daily  rice-based  meals  to  two  or  less,  with  each  consisting  of  less  and \nless  food.  It  has  been  reported  that  children  have  stopped  going  to  school  in  order  to  work \nelsewhere and bring home additional income for the household. Disease incidence has increased \nas  family  expenditure  on  health  has  declined.  The  pressure  from  food  price  increases  obviously \nundermines  poverty  reduction  efforts.  It  is  reported  that  remittances  by  garment  workers  to  their \nfamilies in rural areas have declined drastically due to the rising cost of living.     \n  \n17.  Macroeconomic Impact. Food demand has increased over the past few years as a result \nof  higher  economic  growth,  the  increase  (18%  in  2007)  in  tourist  numbers  to  2  million/year,  and \nhigher income among urban and suburban households. Inflation accelerated in 2008, mainly as a \nresult of increases in food prices. At the end of 2007, inflation stood at 10.8% on a year-on-year \nbasis;  in  the  following  months,  the  inflation  rate  went  much  higher.  Rice  prices  rose  due  to \ndomestic supply shortages, and prices of other food items also rose, reflecting rising consumption, \nincluding  imported  food  items  (mostly  from  Thailand).  The  price  of  meat  (pork  and  chicken)  also \nincreased, in part following a ban on meat imports from Viet Nam to prevent the spread of animal \ndiseases.  Higher  global  fuel  prices  added  to  inflationary  pressures,  as  did  the  weakening  of  the \ndollar,  which  is  widely  used  in  Cambodia  (its  depreciation  against  the  Thai  baht  contributed  to \nimported inflation). High oil prices have driven up the cost of transportation and energy, which are \nlargely  oil-dependent.  This  has  added  to  production  costs,  which  are  already  high  in  the  present \nsituation of poor rural road infrastructure and expensive electricity. The Government had to allocate \n$14  million  from  the  current  budget  for  purchase  of  grain  at  a  time  when  much  of  the  road  and \nirrigation  infrastructure  is  deteriorating  due  to  poor  maintenance  which  itself  is  caused  by \ninadequate budget allocation. This fund represents a subsidy to traders who would have otherwise \nbought paddy or built warehouses up to that amount had they not diverted their own resources to \nspeculative  land  purchases.  Land  grabbing  and  speculation,  combined  with  frequent  turnover  of \nownership,  have  caused  land  prices  to  increase  phenomenally,  contributing  to  inflation.  On  the \nother  hand,  the  sale  of  farm  land  is  affecting  production,  and  dispossessed  landowners  are  now \njoining  the  ranks  of  net food  buyers,  putting  additional  pressure  on  prices.  Green  Trade,  a  state-\nowned company which has had to sell grain at less than market price, has been incurring losses \nand  putting  an  additional  strain  on  the  Government  budget.  Higher  food  prices  have  slowed \neconomic activity in Cambodia as savings and investments are reduced.  \n \n\nImmediate Response to Food Price Shocks  \n\n3. \n \n18. \nThe  Government  Responses.  The  food  price  crisis  has  created  an  urgent  need  for  the \nGovernment  to  support  and  strengthen  social  safety-net  programs,  and  this  has  strained  its \n\n \n\n\f6  \n \nresources.  Despite  the  absence  of  established  social  safety-net  programs  and  institutionalized \nresponse  mechanisms,  the  Government  has  adopted  a  number  of  short-term  measures  to  ease \nthe crisis. The National Task Force for Emergency Food Assistance has recently been established \nto  provide  strategic  direction  and  policy  guidance  in  coordination  with  development  partners  to \ninterventions  aimed  to  support  the  vulnerable  population.  The  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance \n(MEF),  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC),  NCDM,  and  a  number  of  Government  agencies  have \ncoordinated their efforts to undertake the following direct and indirect measures: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nRice export was temporarily banned from all provinces. However, this initial ban was \ncompletely  lifted  in  stages,  first  from  the  three  provinces  bordering  Viet  Nam, \nfollowed by the northern provinces bordering Thailand. \nAt the instruction of the Government, Green Trade released approximately 300 t of \nrice to the market at lower than market price (KR1,800/kilogram [kg] compared with \nthe prevailing market price of around KR2,500/kg). The rice millers association also \ncontributed  to  this  effort.  The  Government's  administrative  actions,  such  as  the \nexport ban and release of stock by Green Trade during the height of the food price \ncrisis,  had  some  dampening  impact  on  the  market  but  not  enough  to  fully  insulate \nthe poor from food price shocks. \nThe Government provided WFP with 4,000 t of rice to support (a) the school feeding \nprogram  and  take  home  ration  or  food  scholarships,  and  (b)  people  with  AIDS  or \ntuberculosis. \nDuties on food imports were reduced to zero.  \nThe Government removed the ban on pork imports. \nSome business taxes were suspended so that concerned companies could increase \nthe salaries of employees. \nIn  order  to  stem  the  flow  of  paddy  to  neighboring  countries,  the  Government \nprovided  a  $10  million  cash  flow  facility  to  the  Rural  Development  Bank  to  extend \nshort-term loans to the private sector for purchase of paddy.  \n\npurchase rice. \nIn  moderating  inflation  caused  by  rising  food  prices,  the  Government  continued  to \nimplement tight control on fiscal policy and stabilize the exchange rate. There is also \na  growing  role  for  monetary  policy  in  controlling  the  rapid  growth  in  money  supply \n(63% in 2007).4 \nThe  Government  has  continued  past  policies  geared  towards  expanding  food  and \nother  agricultural  production.  These  include  improving  the  availability  of  high-yield \nseed  supply,  strengthening  disease  and  pest  control,  providing  more  irrigation \nfacilities  for  dry  paddy  lands,  and  increasing  the  popularity  of  the  system  of  rice \nintensification, which contributed to improving land productivity. \nThe Government\u2019s spending on agriculture has trebled since 2001, which excludes \ncapital spending for construction of rural roads and irrigation facilities. \n\n(viii)  Green  Trade  received  a  cash  flow  facility  of  $4  million  from  the  Government  to \n\n \n19.  \nIn addition, the Government approached its development partners for support in tackling the \nproblem  of  soaring  food  prices.  ADB  received  a  request  from  the  Government  to  provide \nassistance of $30 million to finance its emergency measures against the negative effects of soaring \nfood  and  agricultural  inputs  prices  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  in  Cambodia.  A  similar \nrequest  was  sent  by  the  Government  to  the  World  Bank.  WFP,  FAO,  and  other  donors  have \nworked  with  the  Government  to  develop  a  modest  capacity  for  procurement,  transport,  storage, \nand  distribution  of  food  at  the  national,  provincial,  district,  and  local  levels.  However,  due  to \nresource  constraints,  the  progress  with  the  program  development  and  its  coverage  has  been \n\n \n                                                \n4  IMF. 2007.

It has \ntargeted  to  provide  assistance  to  1.5  million  of  the  2.6  million  food-insecure  people  under  its \nProtracted  Relief  and  Recovery  Operation5  through  food-for-work  and  school  feeding  programs, \nsupport to tuberculosis and HIV victims, vocational training, and mother and child health activities. \nHowever, funding shortages may halve that target.  \n  \n20. \nADB  and  Development  Partner  Response.  Following  the  Government\u2019s  request  for \nassistance  to  deal  with  the  food  price  crisis,  ADB,  World  Bank,  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme  (UNDP),  IFAD,  FAO,  WFP,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development \n(USAID),  and  a  number  of  development  partners  have  coordinated  their  efforts  to  assess  the \ncountry\u2019s immediate needs for supporting the food-insecure population. The ADB Reconnaissance \nMission which visited Cambodia from 26 May to 6 June 2008 joined the development partners and \nconducted a preliminary needs assessment for the emergency food assistance project. The ADB \nmission conducted joint and separate field visits to provinces around the Tonle Sap Basin, where \nthe food poverty rate is one of the highest. According to WFP, 40% of the food-insecure people live \nin the Tonle Sap Basin, which is home to 30% of the national population. A severe erosion of the \npurchasing  power  measured  by  change  in  terms  of  trade  of  milled  rice  against  daily  wages  was \nobserved in the Tonle Sap Basin (23.08%) as compared to the national average (15.04%). At the \ninvitation of the Government, an ADB fact-finding mission visited Cambodia from 23 June to 4 July \n2008. The mission had meetings with relevant stakeholders and representatives of donor partners, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and the private sector.  \n \n21. \nThe mission agreed with the Government and the development partners that the target of \nADB assistance will be mainly the Tonle Sap Basin, which has been the main priority for medium- \nto  long-term  ADB  intervention  under  the  Tonle  Sap  Initiative,  considering  the  high  incidence  of \npoverty and greater vulnerability of the basin ecosystem.6 A summary matrix of external assistance \nto  food  security  is  outlined  in  Appendix  3.  The  mission  visited  seven  provinces  in  the  Tonle  Sap \nBasin\u2014Banteay  Meanchey,  Battambang,  Kampong  Chhnang,  Kampong  Thom,  Pursat,    Odor \nMeanchey and Siem Reap, \u2014 to discuss with local stakeholders (i) the impacts of soaring prices of \nfood and crop inputs, (ii) delivery mechanisms of ADB\u2019s assistance to ease negative impacts in the \nshort  term,  and  (iii)  integration  of  appropriate  measures  in  the  Government\u2019s  existing  strategies  to \naddress medium- and long-term food security issues. In addition, the mission visited those extremely \nvulnerable  slum  communities  (Beungkok,  Stung  Meanchay,  and  Riverside)  in  Phnom  Penh  where \nthe Government plans to extend its social safety-net program. \n \n\nNeeds Assessment  \n\n4. \n \n22. \nThe  needs  assessment  was  conducted  in  cooperation  with  key  development  partners, \nparticularly  WFP,  to  examine  the  impacts  of  soaring  prices  on  Cambodia  as  a  whole  and  on  the \npoor  section  of  the  economy  in  order  to  provide  a  basis  for  prioritizing  external  assistance.

In addition, the \nupcoming  Tonle  Sap  Poverty  Reduction  and  Smallholder  Development  Project:  ADB.  2007.  Technical  Assistance  to \nthe  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  Preparing  the  Tonle  Sap  Poverty  Reduction  and  Smallholder  Development  Project. \nManila  will  support  productivity  improvement  and  household  income  diversification  with  better  risk  management; \nimproved  market  access  with  biosecurity  and  information  and  communication  technology,  and  institutional \nstrengthening with good governance and effective service delivery. \n\n \n\n\f8  \n \nparticular, it analyzed the situation in the Tonle Sap Basin, where poverty incidence is already very \nhigh and where ADB has ongoing and planned intervention projects under the Tonle Sap Initiative. \nThe findings of the assessment are summarized as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nIn  2007,  Cambodia  had  a  surplus  of  approximately  1.3  million  t  of  rice,  but  this \nscenario  is  likely  to  change.  Estimates  show  that  production  in  2008\u20132010  might \ndecline as a consequence of higher prices of inputs such as rice seeds and fertilizer, \nputting further pressure on domestic food price inflation. The higher the input prices, \nthe  less  quality  inputs  smallholders  will  use,  resulting  in  lower  per-hectare  yield.  A \nconservative estimate indicated that the national surplus will fall to 754,000 t in 2010 \nif  the  price  trend  continues  upwards.  This  level  will  drop  further  in  the  event  of  a \nminor price shock. \nRising  food  prices  have  seen  the  purchasing  power  of  households  nationwide \ndecline significantly. This is most evident in the poor section of the economy, where \npeople lack resources to generate additional income to compensate for the loss due \nto  high  prices.  It  is  estimated  that,  other  things  being  equal,  the  Cambodian  poor \nneed  $387  million  in  the  current  year  to  equalize  their  rice  purchasing  power  of \n2007.  \nAside from the loss in rice purchasing power, the rising prices of inputs such as rice \nseeds  and  fertilizers  have  significantly  increased  the  financial  burden  of  the  low-\nincome and poor farming communities, and is estimated at $119 million.  \nTogether,  the  two  shocks  of  soaring  food  and  input  prices  have  increased  the \nburdens of the poor households nationwide by $506.5 million. \nThe equivalent estimate for households in and around the Tonle Sap Basin alone is \n$209.9 million, or 41.4% of the nationwide purchasing power loss. The food, seed, \nand  fertilizer  purchasing  power  for  the  lowest  20%  quintile  of  the  population  is \nestimated at $86 million. With around 30% of the national population, this suggests \nthat the Tonle Sap Basin is suffering more seriously than the rest of the country and \nneeds  emergency  responses  from  the  Government  and  development  partners. \nDetailed estimates are outlined in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n \n5. \n \n23. \nIn  2004,  the  prime  minister  of  Cambodia  presented  the  Rectangular  Strategy  for  Growth, \nEmployment, Equity and Efficiency at the Third Legislature of the National Assembly. The strategy \nstressed  the  need  \u201cto  improve  agricultural  productivity  and  diversification,  thereby  enabling  the \nagriculture  sector  to  serve  as  the  dynamic  driving  force  for  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction\u201d. This priority has now taken on greater importance in light of the current global situation \nwhere soaring food and fuel prices are severely affecting the poor, and undercutting achievements \nmade in poverty reduction. The Technical Working Group on Agriculture and Water of the Ministry \nof  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries  (MAFF)  and  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and \nMeteorology (MOWRAM) has formulated the Strategy for Agriculture and Water 2006\u201320107 which \nincludes  five  action  programs,  including  one  on  food  security.  The  Working  Group  on  Food \nSecurity  has  prepared  Cambodia\u2019s  National  Strategic  Framework  for  Food  Security  and  Nutrition \n(SFFSN)8 covering the period 2008\u20132012, the stated goal of which is that by 2012, poor and food-\ninsecure Cambodians will have substantially improved physical and economic access to sufficient, \nsafe, and nutritious food at all times, in order to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for \nan  active  and  healthy  life.  This  is  to  be  achieved  through  increased  food  production  and \nemployment  creation,  better  natural  resource  management,  improved  food  use  and  utilization, \n \n                                                \n7 Technical Working Group on Agriculture and Water. 2008.

However, \nCambodia\u2019s  efforts  to  maintain  the  SFFSN\u2019s  goal  and  objectives  are  being  threatened  by \nescalating food prices, high prices of crop inputs, and budgetary stress. Over the medium- to long-\nterm,  the  Government\u2019s  main  priorities  in  the  ANR  sector  are  improved  productivity,  increased \nvalue  addition  from  production,  improved  food  security  and  nutrition,  enhanced  energy  security, \nand  the  introduction  of  measures  to  combat  the  effects  of  climate  change.  These  are  to  be \nachieved through improved research and extension, increased public investment in land and water, \nincreased private investment in marketing and the export chain, crop diversification, and policy and \ninstitutional reforms. \n \n\nMedium- and Long-term Assistance to Address Food Security \n\n6. \n \n24. \nIn the ANR sector, Cambodia received $184 million for nine loans, $30 million for two grant \nprojects,  and  $18  million  for  26  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  from  ADB  since  1994.  ADB\u2019s \noperations  in  Cambodia  are  defined  by  a  three-pronged  strategy  of  (i)  policy  and  institutional \nreform  including  governance  reform,  (ii)  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  physical  and  social \ninfrastructure, and (iii) natural resource management. The first Agriculture Sector Program9 (1996\u2013\n2000),  addressed  land  legislation,  agricultural  inputs,  rural  infrastructure,  rural  finance,  public \nenterprises,  and  decentralization.  The  subsequent  Agricultural  Sector  Development  Program10  is \nan attempt to fill the gaps of the Agriculture Sector Program and to deepen the reform process with \na  view  to  improving  productivity  and  promoting  diversification,  private  agro-based  enterprise \ngrowth,  and  agricultural  commercialization  by  improving  access  to  production  factors,  quality \ninputs,  and  good  research  results,  and  by  eliminating  state  intervention  in  input  and  output \nmarkets. \n \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program11 for 2005\u20132009 aims to (i) foster broad-based private \n25. \nsector-led  economic  growth,  (ii)  support  inclusive  social  development,  and  (iii)  strengthen \ngovernance  for  development.  ADB's  country  operations  business  plan 12   for  2008\u20132010  for \nCambodia seeks to enhance rural development to foster more inclusive growth, and to accelerate \npoverty  reduction,  especially  around  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin.  In  addition  to  providing  immediate \nassistance  through  the  Emergency  Food  Assistance  Project,  subsequent  interventions  will  be \nsequenced  to  ease  some  of  the  key  binding  constraints  to  accelerated  agricultural  and  rural \ndevelopment. Interventions will mostly be geared towards (i) improving the management of water \nresources  and  irrigation  assets,  as  well  as  mitigating  flood  and  drought  risk;  (ii)  expanding  the \nconnectivity internally between rural roads and the provincial and national network, and externally \nwith  emerging  subregional  transport  corridors;  (iii)  fostering  the  development  of  smallholder \nagricultural producers; and (iv) widening access for the poorest to rural water supply and sanitation \nand strengthening local community management capacity. These will be accompanied by private \nsector development and risk management through governance reform. In agriculture, the focus will \nshift  to  rural  infrastructure  and  transport,  rural  credit,  skills  development,  rural  electrification,  and \nservice delivery (Appendix 2). \n \n26. \nIn  the  medium  to  long  term,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  provide  the  basis  for  (i)  productivity \ngrowth;  (ii)  promoting  biosecurity;  (iii)  improving  access  to  information  and  communication \ntechnology;  (iv)  improving  market  access  and  income  diversification;  (v)  better  risk  management; \n(vi)  continued  dialogue  with  the  Government  to  deepen  and  widen  policy  reform;  and  (vii) \n\n \n                                                \n9  ADB.  1995.

Such \nassistance would be considered in the broader framework of agricultural linkages to the rural and \nwider national economy, and in cooperation with other development partners through cofinancing \narrangements.  \n  \n\nGovernance and Corruption \n\n7. \n \n27. \nGood  governance  is  at  the  core  of  ADB\u2019s  operations  in  its  developing  member  countries \nincluding  Cambodia.  ADB\u2019s  governance  and  anticorruption  policies  and  the  Second  Governance \nAction  Plan,  2005\u20132008 13   (GACAP  II)  adopted  in  2006  outline  a  comprehensive  approach  to \nimproving  public \nfinancial  management  (PFM),  strengthening  procurement  systems,  and \ncombating corruption. ADB helped the Government establish the National Audit Authority, which is \ncurrently  active  and  functional.  ADB  also  helped  formulate  the  Medium  Term  Expenditure \nFramework, 14   which  is  regularly  issued  by  MEF.  Despite  efforts  by  the  Government,  weak \ngovernance continues to be a key challenge. Cambodia adopted the Public Financial Management \nReform  Program:  Strengthening  Governance  through  Enhanced  Public  Financial  Management  in \nDecember  2004,  outlining  an  action  plan  for  PFM  reform  in  order  to  raise  standards  of \nmanagement and accountability in the mobilization, effectiveness, and efficiency in the utilization of \nGovernment resources. In April 2007, the Government agreed to implement GACAP II under the \nADB-financed  regional  TA  Governance  and  Capacity  Development 15  project.  The  World  Bank, \nDepartment  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  and  ADB  have  jointly \ndetermined that PFM, public administration reform, and decentralization require immediate priority \nattention.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  2005\u20132009  recognizes  good  governance  as \ncritical to improving the responsiveness, cost-effectiveness, and quality of public service delivery.     \n \nPublic procurement, which is an area generally associated with a high level of corruption, is \n28. \nundergoing  major  reforms.  The  procurement  process  lacks  effective  control  mechanisms,  and \nthere  is  no  effective  regulatory  framework  to  regulate  procurement  practices.  In  order  to  avoid \ncorruption and fraud in the procurement process, the Government mandated the use of Standard \nOperating  Procedures  (SOP)  and  Procurement  Manual16  on  26  February  2007.  Both  documents \nare  in  line  with  ADB  guidelines.  Internal  control  procedures  specified  in  the  SOP  and  Financial \nManagement  Manual17  are  applied  in  project  management,  internal  control,  and  reporting.  ADB \nlooks  at  public  financial  management  as  an  enabling  condition  for  poverty  reduction  and  good \ngovernance. Under a proposed ADB-funded project,18 assistance will be provided to improve PFM \ncapacities  for  achieving  aggregate  fiscal  discipline  in  rural  priority  sectors  in  order  to  improve \nservice delivery to the rural population. \n  \n \n \n29. \nPublic procurement and distribution of food through an emergency food reserve system and \nregular  safety-net  programs  are  relatively  new  to  Cambodia.  WFP  and  a  number  of  NGOs  have \nbeen supporting safety-net programs, such as food-for-work and food-for-education programs, and \ntuberculosis  and  AIDS  sufferers  for  a  number  of  years.  These  programs  are  usually  run  through \n \n                                                \n13  ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anti-Corruption Action Plan (2005\u20132008).

At  the  onset  of  the  food  price  crisis,  the  Government \nmobilized  NCDM,  MOC,  Green  Trade,  and  the  rice  millers  association  to  undertake  procurement \nand  distribution  of  food,  including  support  to  WFP  (para  18).  The  present  crisis  is  a  learning \nexperience for the Government, and the situation warrants the need to develop its capacity for an \nemergency  response  system  for  food  security  and  expand  its  social  safety-net  programs.  The \nexperiences  from  countries  such  as  India  and  Bangladesh,  where  governments  have  relatively \ngood  records  of  managing  public  food  distribution  through  well-targeted  and  well-managed \nprograms, will be useful for Cambodia. These models can provide a solid basis for supporting the \ndevelopment  of  an  envisaged  food  security  reserve  system,  and  provide  Cambodia  with  several \nadaptable models for its safety-net programs, many of which have added social benefits, such as \nthe  use  of  food-for-work  programs  to  support  the  construction  and  maintenance  of  essential \ninfrastructure\u2014rural roads, river embankments, irrigation, and other public facilities. \n \n30. \nAn  important  factor  limiting  immediate  and  medium-term  productivity  enhancement  is  the \nabsence  of  financing  from  microfinance  institutions  for  operational  inputs  for  small  and  marginal \nfarmers.  Mobilizing  effective  credit  delivery  from  among  the  microfinance  institutions  to  provide \nshort-term credit to the target farmers and households has proven to be difficult. The segment of \npopulation  to  be  covered  by  the  Project  will  have  difficulty  fulfilling  the  eligibility  criteria  of  the \nmicrofinance institutions, an issue currently being examined by the ongoing project preparatory TA \nfor the Tonle Sap Smallholder Development and Poverty Reduction Project19 due to start in 2009 \nwith cofinancing possibilities from IFAD and the Government of Finland. In addition to supporting a \nstrategy  that  combines  technology,  infrastructure,  and  market  access,  this  upcoming  project  is \nexpected to address policy concerns in rural microfinance, develop sustainable credit financing for \nsmallholders,  and  support  the  transitional  requirements  of  credit  to  farmers  for  increasing  and \nsustaining farm productivity. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA. \n \nThe  expected  impact  is  reduced  vulnerability  of  food-insecure  households  in  Cambodia. \n31. \nThe expected outcome is improved access to sufficient food by food-insecure Cambodians in the \ntarget  provinces.  The  Project  will  improve  the  immediate  food  security  of  an  estimated  500,000 \npoor and vulnerable people affected by higher food prices through higher food intake. The lowest \nquintile of farmers (the poorest 20% of the national population), who are also net food buyers, will \nbe  able  to  increase  food  production,  and  employment  and  income  of  households  with  limited \npurchasing  power  will  increase.  The  Project  will  reduce  the  poverty  of  low-income  groups  and \ncontribute  to  the  efforts  of  the  Government  to  strengthen  the  safety-net  programs  for  poor  and \nvulnerable population in the face of rising food prices. The Project will emphasize improving access \nof the poor to food, income, and livelihood support. It will assist in relieving fiscal pressures caused \nby a sharp rise in safety-net program expenditure.  \n \nB. \n \n32. \nThe  Project  consists  of  three  components:  (i)  compensatory  consumption  support \ncomprising  (a)  food  distribution,  and  (b)  a  food-for-work  program;  (ii)  productivity  enhancement \nsupport;  and  (iii)  capacity  development  for  emergency  response  to  the  food  crisis,  and  Project \nmanagement. Three expected outputs are (i) increased availability of food to vulnerable households; \n \n                                                \n19 ADB.  2007.

Manila, \n\n \n\n\f \n\n12 \n \n(ii) supported input needs of smallholders and marginal farmers; and (iii) an operational national food \nsecurity response system. The Project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n33. \nComponent 1: Compensatory Consumption Support. Under this component food will be \nprovided  for  free  distribution  among  selected  families  and  for  the  food-for-work  program.  This \ncomponent will encompass (i) identification of target groups for free food distribution and the food-for-\nwork  program;  (ii)  procurement  of  rice,  transport,  and  storage;  (iii)  free  rice  distribution  to  target \ngroups; (iv) free food distribution (cash transfer or voucher system) to selected urban poor in Phnom \nPenh; (v) provision of food to the Government\u2019s school feeding and take home ration programs; (vi) \nprovision of food to children in selected early childhood learning centers (ECLCs); (vii) organization of \ntarget  groups  for  the  food-for-work  program;  and  (viii)  organization  of  technical  support  and \nmanagement of the  food-for-work program.  Activities  under  the  food-for-work  program  will  include \nrehabilitation  of  small  tertiary  irrigation  canals  and  village  roads,  which  will  mainly  involve  manual \ndredging, resurfacing, cutting grass, and filling up road holes within the existing right-of-way. The \nrehabilitation of small tertiary irrigation canals will help optimize the Project assistance by completing \nthe  essential  package  of  water\u2013seed\u2013fertilizer  that  will  contribute  to  increased  production  in  the \ncoming  crop  seasons.  The  rehabilitation  of  village  roads  will  help  enhance  connectivity  among \nvillages  and  communes,  ensuring  better  access  to  markets  and  social  services.  Construction  of \nnew  canals  or  roads  will  not  be  undertaken  under  this  food-for-work  program.  Specific  work \naccounts  will  be  identified  during  implementation  based  on  the  needs  assessment  and  selection \ncriteria. It is envisaged that each individual work account will not exceed $5,000. The program will \ncomply with national labor laws and regulations, particularly on child labor, and provide equal pay \nfor equal work regardless of gender and ethnicity. \n \n34. \nComponent  2:  Productivity  Enhancement  Support.  Under  this  component,  seed  and \nfertilizer  will  be  sold  to  selected  farmers  at  subsidized  prices.  This  component  will  include  (i) \nidentification of target groups (farmers) for subsidized seed and fertilizer distribution; (ii) procurement, \ntransport, and storage of seed and fertilizer; and (iii) sale of seed and fertilizer at subsidized prices to \ntarget beneficiaries. Smallholders and marginal farmers, the majority of whom are net food buyers, \nwill  receive  subsidized  fertilizer  and  seed  together  with  extension  services,  and,  where  feasible, \nthese will be combined with supplementary irrigation which will be enhanced by field channels and \nsubsidiary canals rehabilitated under the food-for-work program.  \n \nComponent  3:  Capacity  Development  for  Emergency  Response  to  Food  Crisis  and \n35. \nProject  Management.  This  component  has  three  parts:  (i)  establishment  of  an  independent \nmonitoring  system  to  oversee  target-group  selection,  distribution  of  food  and  inputs,  organization \nand  management  of  the  food-for-work  program,  and  compliance  with  fiduciary  requirements;  (ii) \nestablishment  of  a  system  of  emergency  food  reserve  and  rapid  response,  which  will  involve  (a) \nsurveys and diagnosis of the current nationwide food security situation; (b) institutional analysis of \nthe food procurement, storage, transportation, and distribution system; (c) essential hardware and \nlogistics support and related facilities to enhance the capacity of NCDM and PCDMs in the Project \nprovinces to respond to the food crisis; and (d) baseline surveys and monitoring and data collection \nin the Project areas; and (iii) strengthening financial management capacity of the executing agency \n(EA),  implementing  agencies  (IAs),  and  provincial  project  management  units  (PPMUs)  in  Project \nmanagement  and  monitoring.  These  are  designed  to  enhance  the  Government\u2019s  longer-term \ncapability to deal with food emergencies, and provide support to ongoing efforts at sustaining the \ngrowth of productivity by minimizing the impacts of natural disaster.  \n   \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n36. \nADB\u2019s  Framework  of  Response  to  the  Soaring  Food  Prices.  The  design  of  the \nproposed  Project  follows  ADB\u2019s  response  to  the  soaring  food  prices  presented  in  Soaring  Food \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n13\n\n \n \nPrices, Response to the Crisis20 which was released by the President of ADB at its Annual Meeting \nin  Madrid  in  May  2008.  The  Project  provides  a  strong  link  between  short-term  emergency  relief \nassistance  and  medium-  to  long-term  production  and  productivity  growth,  generating  a  supply \nresponse together with institution building for food emergency response.   \n \nConsultation,  Coordination,  and  Partnerships.  The  Project  was  designed  in  close \n37. \nconsultation with the Government, civil society, and development partners active in Cambodia both \nat the central level and Project provinces. The Project preparation team visited seven provinces21 \nand  11  communes 22   holding  in-depth  discussion  with  officials,  civil  society  members,  local \ngovernment  representatives,  and  beneficiaries  in  order  to  assess  the  need  for  assistance,  and \nissues  related  to  food  emergency  preparedness,  immediate  productivity  increase,  method  of \nidentification of beneficiaries, and fiduciary controls. The needs assessment was shared with, and \nfeedback on the Project design was obtained from, development partners including representatives \nof  the  World  Bank,  European  Commission,  UNDP,  WFP,  FAO,  and  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr \nTechnische  Zusammenarbeit  (German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation).  The  World  Bank  and \nEuropean  Commission  are  expected  to  complement  the  Government\u2019s  effort  to  provide  food, \ninputs,  and  income  assistance  to  the  vulnerable  population  using  the  Project-developed \nmethodology. In addition, the Project will provide a special opportunity for deepening Government \nand NGO partnership.  \n \n38. \nDisaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  (DEAP).  The  Project  will  be  implemented \npursuant  to  the  DEAP23  and  in  accordance  with  the  Action  Plan24  for  its  implementation,  which \ndefines disaster as a series of disruptions to the functioning of a community or a society causing \nwidespread  human,  material,  economic  or  environmental  losses  that  exceed  the  ability  of  the \naffected  community  or  society  to  cope  using  its  own  resources.  ADB's  Disaster  and  Emergency \nAssistance  Policy,  expressly  contemplates  the  inclusion  of  quick-disbursing  components  in \nemergency assistance loans to finance immediate and urgent procurements.25 The draw down for \nthe  retroactive  financing  and  the  advance  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  quick-disbursing  as \nprovided under the policy. \n \n39. \nOne-off  Emergency  Measure.  All  interventions  are  one-off  short-term  emergency \nmeasures, while long-term measures, such as operational national food security response systems \nand productivity enhancement programs, are in place. The proposed one-off subsidy on rice seeds \nand  fertilizers  will  help  farmers  recover  and  maintain  and  increase  crop  yields,  enabling \nreinvestments  of  surplus  in  the  succeeding  crop  seasons,  and  ensuring  adequacy  of  community \nfood-grain  stocks.  The  Government,  ADB,  and  a  number  of  development  partners  are  working \ntogether  on  policy  issues  and  productivity  enhancement  concerns  in  agriculture,  particularly  in  the \nTonle  Sap  Basin.  The  one-off  support  for  a  national  food  security  response  system  will  help  the \nGovernment  develop  a  more  sustainable  safety-net  program  to  tackle  food  emergencies  in  the \nfuture through the implementation of component 3 and the attached TA.   \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2008.

The  Government  will  finance  taxes  and  duties  of  $3.54 \nmillion,  and  recurrent  costs  of  $1.54  million  accounting  for  12.68%  of  the  total  Project  cost.  The \nloan and grant will finance the Project on a joint basis. The loan portion will carry an interest rate of \n1% per year, a maturity of 40 years and a grace period of 10 years, with repayment of principal at \n2%  per  year  for  the  first  10  years  after  the  grace  period,  and  4%  per  year  thereafter.  The \nGovernment  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  related  to  the  loan.  Interest  charges  on  the  loan \nare to be capitalized.

The  Government  has \n\n \n43. \nCambodia  is  eligible  for  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  grants.  Cambodia\u2019s  fiscal  and \nforeign  exchange  resources  as  well  as  donor  funds  are  inadequate  to  meet  wide-ranging \nemergency  requirements  arising  from  soaring  food,  input,  and  energy  prices.  Cambodia\u2019s  debt \nsustainability  analysis  suggests  the  need  to  channel  a  significant  portion  of  development \nassistance in grants for years to come. \n \nfrom  other \n44. \ndevelopment  partners,  especially  from  the  World  Bank.  During  a  needs  assessment  mission,  a \nnumber  of  development  partners  showed  their  willingness  to  complement  ADB\u2019s  fund  for \nemergency  food  assistance.  The  World  Bank  has  recently  held  discussions  with  ADB  on  needs \nassessment and cofinancing. It has indicated that up to $40 million from its poverty reduction grant \noperation  could  be  made  available  for  Cambodia,  and  it  is  willing  to  work  with  ADB  and  the \nGovernment in using these funds for additional activities under the Project.  \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nrequested \n\nfinancing \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n45. \nThe Project will utilize existing effective delivery mechanisms and institutions, and enhance \ntheir capacity as appropriate. MEF will be the Project EA, while the proposed IAs will be: (i) MAFF \nfor the seed and fertilizer assistance; (ii) Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) for the food-for-work \nprogram; (iii) MOWRAM for the food-for-work program; (iv) MOC for the emergency food security \nsystem; (v) NCDM and PCDMs in seven Project provinces for overall coordination, management, \nand  distribution  of  food  and  input  assistance,  and  establishment  of  the  emergency  food  security \nreserve  and  rapid  response  system;  (vi)  MOEYS  for  the  school  feeding  program;  (vii)  MOWA  for \nthe  ECLC  feeding  program;  and  (vii)  commune  councils  and  village  development  committees \n(VDCs)  for  identification  of  target  groups  and  distribution  of  food  and  inputs.  The  Project \nimplementation and funds flow diagram are in Appendix 5. \n \nThe National Food Security Task Force (NFSTF), headed by MEF and with representation \n46. \nfrom  concerned  Government  ministries  and  agencies  and  key  development  partners,  will  provide \noverall policy guidance to Project implementation. A central project management unit (CPMU), led \nby a Project director, will be established at MEF to oversee daily implementation. Provincial project \nmanagement  units  (PPMUs)  will  be  established  in  all  seven  Project  provinces,  and  will  be \nresponsible  for  organizing  Project  activities  comprising  target-group  selection,  procurement, \nstorage,  and  distribution  of  food,  rice  seeds,  and  fertilizer  in  their  respective  provinces,  and \nreporting  to  the  CPMU  on  all  matters  relating  to  the  Project  management  in  their  respective \nprovinces.  In  view  of  the  fast-track  processing  under  the  Disaster  and  Emergency  Policy,  and \nprocurement  requirements  of  the  Project,  the  Government  established  the  CPMU  and  appointed \nthe  Project  director  immediately  after  the  signing  of  the  memorandum  of  understanding,  and  has \nadvised ADB thereon. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n16 \n \n \nTechnical  support  units  will  be  established  at  each  implementing  ministry  or  department. \n47. \nInterministerial  and  interdepartmental  coordination  will  be  assured  by  NCDM  at  the  central  level \nand by the PCDM (chaired by the provincial governor) at the provincial level. Selected commune \ncouncils,  assisted  by  respective  VDCs,  will  be  responsible  for  receiving,  storing,  and  distributing \n(free)  rice,  seed,  and  fertilizers  to  the  target  groups  in  accordance  with  a  list  of  potential \nbeneficiaries  prepared  through  a  participatory  process  by  commune  councils  and  VDCs,  and \nagreed upon by the PCDM on the basis of the criteria outlined in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nThe  food-for-work  program  will  be  implemented  through  available  effective  existing \n48. \nGovernment  structures  of  MRD,  MOWRAM,  MOEYS,  and  MOWA  in  the  Project  areas,  including \nthe  commune  councils.  Where  such  capacities  are  lacking,  other  competent  organizations, \nincluding  UN  agencies,  will  be  contracted  to  implement  the  food-for-work  program.  MAFF  will \nprovide  extension  services  to  assist  farmers  in  the  optimal  utilization  of  the  seed,  fertilizers,  and \nwater package. Quality control of rice, seed, and fertilizers will be carried out jointly by designated \ndepartments of MAFF and MOC. \n \nPreparation of the list of target beneficiaries and procurement and distribution of rice, seed, \n49. \nand  fertilizers  will  be  supervised  and  monitored  by  independent  monitors  reporting  to  ADB  and \nNFSTF (paragraph 56), and technically supported by qualified experts from the respective IAs, as \nmay  be  required.  Consultant  support  will  be  provided  to  the  respective  IAs  for  capacity-building \npurposes and to ensure timely execution of Project activities. NCDM will receive support to develop \na framework to establish a national emergency food security reserve and rapid response system, \nincluding expansion of existing community rice banks. \n \n50. \nThe  Government  envisages  closer  guidance  and  supervision  by  ADB  throughout  the \nimplementation of the Project. In view of the emergency nature of the Project, the Government has \nrequested  ADB  to  administer  the  specialist  inputs  and  consulting  services.  To  ensure  timely \nimplementation,  staff  at  ADB  headquarters  will  work  closely  with  staff  at  the  ADB  Cambodia \nResident Mission, which will assign one dedicated staff member to monitor Project compliance with \nADB requirements to ensure quality control and accelerated implementation through regular follow-\nup,  and  provide  guidance  to  the  relevant  IAs  on  project  implementation  matters.  Extended \nmissions by ADB will be required to provide constant supervision during the early phase of Project \nimplementation.  ADB  will  redeploy  one  professional  staff  member  to  the  resident  mission  early \n2009,  and  a  staff  consultant  experienced  in  audit  will  also  be  recruited.  The  Tonle  Sap  Initiative \nCoordination  Unit,  based  at  the  Cambodia  Resident  Mission,  will  assist  the  resident  mission  in \nproviding necessary oversight functions.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  implementation  period  will  be  from  1  October  2008  to  31  March  2011.  The \n\n51. \nProject implementation plan is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n  \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n52. \nThe Project will entail the procurement of rice, seed, fertilizers, vehicles, office equipment, \nand  a  large  number  of  community-based  civil  works  under  the  food-for-work  program.  All \nprocurement  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Retroactive  financing  for  a \nmaximum  of  30%  of  the  total  loan  and  grant  amounts  will  be  considered  for  eligible  expenditure \nincurred not earlier than  22 August 2008, provided that the expenditure is in compliance with the \nfollowing  conditions:  (i)  it  is  in  accordance  with  acceptable  procedures  specified  by  ADB,  (ii)  it  is \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n \n\n17\n\nverified by ADB, (iii) it is certified by MEF, and (iv) the certification is acceptable to ADB. ADB will \naudit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  in  accordance  with  its  fiduciary  responsibilities  and  verify  the \naccuracy of Government certification. The Government has been advised by ADB that provision of \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project. \n \nNo international procurement is envisaged under the Project. Rice will be procured directly \n53. \nfrom  a  list  of  prequalified  and  approved  rice  millers  who  will  be  selected  based  on  capacity \nassessment  and  financial  status.  This  selection  will  be  conducted  in  consultation  with  provincial \nand  central  rice  millers  associations.  Procurement  of  rice  will  involve  multiple  awards  for  partial \nquantities  based  on  the  needs  of  the  provinces  and  various  programs.  In  accordance  with  the \nProcurement Guidelines, suppliers will be invited to quote prices linked to the market price. These \ncontracts  may  also  include  delivery  options.  Fertilizer  will  also  be  procured  in  phases.  National \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures,  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  be  adopted.  Similar  procedures  will  also \nbe  adopted  for  procurement  of  vehicles.  Flexible  procedures  pursuant  to  the  provisions  under \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines will be adopted. \n \nDuring 2000\u20132008, AusAID assisted in developing and implementing the Agriculture Quality \n54. \nImprovement  Program  (AQIP)  which  developed  a  number  of  seed  production  centers  that  were \nsuccessful in developing high-yielding rice seeds suitable for Cambodia. Subsequently, the AQIP \nSeed Company was incorporated as a registered commercial entity. This entity is largely owned by \nthe  private  sector,  with  some  ownership  maintained  by  research  institutes.  The  company  has \ndeveloped  a  commercially  viable  business  for  the  production  and  distribution  of  high-quality  rice \nseeds.  Regional  production  centers  have  been  established  which  provide  cleaned,  tested,  and \npackaged  rice  seeds  to  farmers,  dealers,  government,  and  nongovernment  agencies.  Under  this \nProject, procurement of the rice seeds will be serviced by the AQIP Seed Company following direct \ncontracting procedures, along with provision for direct procurement of rice seeds from local seed \nproducers  associations.  The  food-for-work  program  will  involve  a  large  number  of  small, \ncommunity-based small contracts for which compensation will be in the form of food, in accordance \nwith  existing  procedures  under  various  government  programs  as  well  as  under  UN-sponsored \nprograms.  Before  the  commencement  of  any  procurement  activity  under  national  competitive \nbidding,  ADB  and  the  borrower  will  review  the  relevant  agency\u2019s  capacity  to  ensure  compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The procurement plan is in Appendix 6. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n55. \nThe  Project  will  require  325  person-months  of  consulting  services,  comprising  75  person-\nmonths  of  international  consultants  and  250  person-months  of  national  consultants.  The  Project \nwill  also  provide  independent  monitoring  services  by  local  NGOs.  It  is  proposed  that  the  cost  of \nconsulting services and independent monitoring will be financed by both the allocated fund under \ncomponent 3 and an attached TA project for strengthening the Government\u2019s capacity to respond \nto  food  crisis  and  improving  food  security,  and  enhancing  fiduciary  oversight  of  the  Project.  All \nconsultants,  including  the  independent  monitors,  will  be  recruited  by  ADB  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time). Para 64 describes the \ntechnical assistance and Appendix 7 provides cost estimates and a financing plan; outline terms of \nreference for consultants are provided in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n\n5. \n\nProject Monitoring and Anticorruption Measures \n\nStrong Oversight Mechanisms to Manage Fiduciary Risks. Emergency assistance must \n56. \nbe  supported  by  sound  financial  management  and  operational  procedures,  as  well  as  monitoring \nand evaluation mechanisms. The Cambodia Resident Mission will closely monitor compliance with \nADB\u2019s requirements under the Project to reduce fiduciary risks in the implementation of the safety-\n\n \n\n\f \n\n18 \n \nnet  programs.  Strengthened  fiduciary  risk  mitigation  measures,  such  as  quality  government  audit \nassurance,  as  well  as  performance  audits  and  independent  monitoring  by  local  NGOs,  will  be \nadopted  under  the  proposed  project.  Considering  the  Government\u2019s  expanded  safety-net \nprograms, joint fiduciary oversight arrangements will be established with the participation of ADB, \nindependent audit experts, and the Government. To strengthen field monitoring of food and input \ndistribution and execution of the food-for-work program, the Government has agreed to utilize the \nservices  of  competent  NGOs  as  independent  monitors  who  will  report  directly  to  the  NFSTF  and \nADB.  The  Project  quarterly  report  will  cover  the  progress  and  expected  completion  date  of  the \nprocurement of food grains, and on their distribution through different safety-net programs. \n \n57. \nGovernance  issues  are  of  major  concern  in  the  Project.  Necessary  safeguards  and \nsupervision  will  be  provided  under  the  attached  TA  to  ensure  transparent  food  procurement  and \ndistribution  operations.  The  Cambodia  Resident  Mission  will  closely  monitor  anticorruption \nmeasures undertaken by the EA, and will carry out random checks on procurement and accounts \nof  the  EA,  IAs,  and  PPMUs,  and  inspect  procurement  activities  and  storage  facilities  under  the \nProject. Other anticorruption measures will include (i) strict financial management with submission \nof  annual  audited  accounts  and  internal  audit  report  by  the  EA;  (ii)  strengthened  Government \nmonitoring;  (iii)  strong  Project  supervision;  (iv)  periodic  reviews  of  accounts  and  statements  of \nexpenditure  (SOEs);  (v)  close  monitoring  of  the  investments  and  safety-net  programs  under  the \nProject; and (vi) close coordination of the Project with the proposed Public Financial Management \nfor Rural Development Project26. The list of specific governance risk mitigation measures that have \nbeen taken into consideration in designing the Project is in Appendix 8.  \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy   \n\n \n\n58. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  Cambodia.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. The \nGovernment and the EA agree to cooperate with any such investigation and extend the necessary \nassistance,  including  access  to  all  relevant  books  and  records,  as  well  as  engagement  of \nindependent  experts  that  may  be  needed  for  satisfactory  completion  of  such  investigations.  To \nsupport  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan \nregulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB \nin  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The  Project  incorporates  several  specific \nanticorruption  measures,  including  (i)  strict  financial  management  with  strengthened  Government \naccounting,  auditing,  monitoring,  and  independent  monitoring  and  review  by  TA  consultants;  (ii) \nstrong project supervision of public procurement and distribution of food grains financed from this \nloan  with  appropriate  consultancy  input;  (iii)  delegation  of  project  administration  to  the  Cambodia \nResident Mission; and (iv) random and independent spot checks by ADB officials and the project \nconsultants. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n59. \nProject  funds  will  flow  from  ADB  to  MEF  (CPMU),  which  will  establish  a  Project  imprest \naccount  at  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia.  The  initial  ceiling  of  the  imprest  account  will  be  the \nlower of the estimated expenditures to be funded from the imprest account for the first 6 months, or \n\n \n                                                \n26 ADB.  2007.

Funds will flow to various IAs to finance the activities they are \nindividually responsible for. Each PPMU will establish a second generation imprest account (SGIA) \nat  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia.  A  total  of  seven  SGIAs  (one  for  each  PPMU)  will  be  opened \nunder  the  Project.  The  initial  ceiling  of  each  SGIA  will  be  equivalent  to  6  months  estimated \nexpenditures  to  be  funded  from  the  imprest  account,  or  $50,000,  whichever  is  lower.  Funds  will \nflow  to  subproject  bank  accounts  held  at  the  various  IAs  to  finance  the  activities  they  are \nindividually responsible for. The IA\u2019s will be required to submit full supporting documentation to the \nCPMU or PPMU as the basis of funding the accounts. The CPMU and each PPMU will open two \nsets of imprest accounts (one for the grant fund and another for the loan fund, as appropriate). The \nSOE  procedure  will  be  used  to  liquidate  and  replenish  the  imprest  accounts  for  eligible \nexpenditures. Any individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under this procedure shall not \nexceed the equivalent of $50,000. SOE documentation will be retained at the CPMU and PPMUs. \nImprest  account  and  SOE  records  will  be  audited  during  the  annual  audit  process.  All \ndisbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The EA and IAs will be responsible for managing and administering \nthe imprest account in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nThe  EA  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  the  goods  financed  by  the \n60. \nloan proceeds. Project accounts will be set up in accordance with sound accounting principles. The \nEA will ensure that the consolidated Project accounts and related financial statements will be audited \nannually  by  an  independent  audit  authority  of  Cambodia.  The  audited  reports  and  related  financial \nstatements in English will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year \nto which they relate. In addition to the Government audit, for the procurement of goods financed from \nthe loan and grant, ADB or its agents will undertake a special audit which could involve independent \nfinancial  and  performance  auditing  and  review  to  ensure  transparency,  financial  integrity,  and \nobjective performance assessment of the goods procured and distributed from this loan. A separate \naudit opinion is to be issued on the use of imprest accounts, including SGIAs, and the use of SOE \nprocedure.  Financial  and  performance  monitoring  and  review,  including  spot  checks,  will  be \nconducted from time to time during and after the Project period and be carried out by external private \nsector auditors or by ADB. The Government will provide ADB, through the EA, with a midterm and \nan  overall  Project  completion  report,  providing  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  Project  design,  costs, \nperformance, social and economic impact, and other details as requested by ADB. \n   \n\n \n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring System \n\n \n61. \nA project performance management system (PPMS) will be developed on the basis of the \nProject design and monitoring framework to examine the Project\u2019s technical performance, evaluate \ndelivery of Project facilities, assess achievement of Project objectives, and measure the Project\u2019s \nsocial, economic, financial, and institutional impacts. The EA will be responsible for developing and \noperating the PPMS with information provided by PPMUs and IAs, and will report monthly to ADB. \nProgress  monitoring,  safeguard  monitoring,  and  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  carried \nout during project implementation. Post-evaluation review will be carried out 3 years after project \ncompletion. Baseline, covering both target and control groups, and periodic surveys will be carried \nout through subcontracting competent local NGOs, who will collect data disaggregated by income \ngroup, gender, types of vulnerability, and other characteristics as appropriate. The EA will maintain \na Project-specific webpage, in English and Khmer, on its official website for wider dissemination of \nprocurement  and  distribution-related  information,  and  to  provide  a  feedback  mechanism. \nConsultant services will be provided to assist the EA and IAs to develop and implement the PPMS. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n20 \n \n62. \nIn addition, an independent monitoring system will be established to conduct monitoring of \nbeneficiary screening and selection, and project procedures, including fiduciary compliances. The \nindependent monitors will report to NFSTF and ADB. The IAs will provide the CPMU with monthly \nand  quarterly  progress  reports,  as  appropriate,  which  will  be  consolidated  into  a  single  progress \nreport for the Project. The consolidated report will be submitted to ADB. The CPMU, together with \nPPMUs  and  IAs,  will  establish  the  baseline  indicators  at  the  commune  level  within  3  months  of \nProject  inception  from  secondary  sources,  baseline  survey,  and  participatory  observations.  A \nProject  completion  report  will  be  prepared  by  the  CPMU  and  submitted  to  ADB  within  3  months \nafter completion of the project. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n63. \nADB will conduct regular reviews throughout Project implementation, at least twice a year. \nThe reviews will assess implementation performance and achievements of Project outcomes and \nobjectives,  examine  financial  progress,  identify  issues  and  constraints  affecting  the  Project,  and \nwork  out  time-bound  action  plans  for  their  resolution.  Given  the  implementation  period  and \nemergency  nature  of  the  Project,  no  midterm  review  will  be  conducted  unless  ADB  and  the \nGovernment deem it necessary.    \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n64. \nAn  attached  TA  project  of  $1.6  million  will  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  deal \nwith food crises and related emergencies. ADB will finance $1.5 million of the TA project on a grant \nbasis  from  its  TA  funding  program,  and  the  Government  will  contribute  $100,000.  The  TA  fund, \ntogether  with  the  allocated  fund  under  component  3,  will  help  (i)  establish  an  independent \nmonitoring  system  to  oversee  target-group  selection,  distribution  of  food  and  inputs,  organization \nand  management  of  the  food-for-work  program,  and  compliance  with  fiduciary  requirements;  (ii) \ndevelop  a  system  of  emergency  food  reserve  and  rapid  response;  (iii)  strengthen  financial \nmanagement  capacity  of  the  EA,  IA,  and  PPMUs,  including  capability  to  deal  with  food \nemergencies;  and  (iv)  manage  and  monitor  Project  implementation.  The  TA  will  finance \ninternational and national consulting services and independent monitoring services in conjunction \nwith  the  consulting  services  financed  through  the  Project  funds.  Appendix  7  provides  cost \nestimates  and  a  financing  plan.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Retroactive financing for a maximum of 30% of \nthe  TA  amounts  will  be  considered  for  eligible  expenditure  incurred  not  earlier  than  22  August \n2008. \n   \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nSocioeconomic Benefits and Impacts \n\n1.  \n\nImpacts on Consumers \n\n \nRice is the staple food item in Cambodia and constitutes 50% of the total food consumption \n65. \nof  poor  families.  Between  March  2007  and  May  2008,  rice  prices  in  Cambodia  doubled.  Such \nfluctuations in the price of rice will have an impact on poverty reduction efforts; it was predicted that \na 10% increase of the rice price would increase the national poverty rate by 0.5% (in both rural and \nurban  areas).  In  addition  to  critically  low  levels  of  global  food  stocks  and  higher  production  and \ntransport  costs,  the  problem  posed  by  high  global  rice  prices  has  been  compounded  by  export \nrestrictions from large exporting countries and significant rice purchases from importing countries \nat higher prices. \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n \n\n21\n\n \nThe  Project  will  enhance  food  entitlement  of  the  vulnerable,  increase  production,  and \n66.  \ncontribute  to  medium-  and  long-term  productivity  growth.  About  500,000  residents,  or  89,000 \nhouseholds, living in and around the Tonle Sap Basin27 and three slum areas28 in Phnom Penh will \nbenefit  from  the  proposed  Project  assistance.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the  restoration  of  the \npurchasing power of the poor and vulnerable who are at greater risk of hunger and malnutrition. In \nso  doing,  it  will  ease  the  negative  impacts  of  rising  food  prices  mentioned  earlier.  Greater  food \navailability  will  ease  the  pressure  of  starvation  and  reduce  the  risk  of  loss  of  lives,  particularly  in \nrural areas. Nutritional status will improve for the urban slum dwellers, economic migrants and their \nfamilies, fixed-income people, wage workers, landless, poor rural families, and families affected by \nHIV. This is particularly crucial for the people who are chronically vulnerable and are therefore at \nrisk of undernutrition and malnutrition. \n \n\n2.  \n\nImpacts on Producers \n\n \n67.  \nA  major  part  of  the  Project  financing  (approximately  67%)  will  be  used  to  finance \nproductivity  enhancement  by  way  of  appropriate  seed,  fertilizer,  and  irrigation  and  rural  roads \n(under  the  food-for-work  program).  The  assistance  will  cover  about  200,000  hectares  (ha)  of \nproductive  rice  land,  which  is  cultivated  by  smallholders  and  marginal  farmers  for  two  crops \nannually  (rainy  and  dry  season  crops).  Within  the  context  of  rising  crop  input  prices,  Project \nassistance will help smallholders and marginal farmers continue to produce rice to take advantage \nof  the  rising  rice  market  price.  Discussions  with  various  farmer  groups  during  the  fact-finding \nmission indicated that rising input prices have made them think of alternatives, including reducing \ninputs for the same crop area, using no inorganic inputs for rice crops, selling land, and looking for \na daily wage job in urban centers. The assistance through the Project will enable smallholders and \nmarginal farmers to afford crop inputs for continued rice production. The application of crop inputs \n(seed  and  fertilizer)  along  with  extension  services  will  directly  improve  rice  harvests,  and  enable \ntargeted  households  to  meet  food  needs  and  reinvest  surpluses  in  subsequent  production \nseasons. This will serve as a springboard for many to uplift their livelihoods. \n \n68. \nRising  input  prices  have  seriously  reduced  affordability  and  willingness  of  farmer \nhouseholds  (particularly  smallholders  and  marginal  farmers)  to  purchase  appropriate  crop  inputs \nand,  in  the  majority  of  cases,  farmers  will  decide  to  grow  rice  with  low-quality  seed  and  without \nessential nutrient input (fertilizer). Based on the Project financing plan, it is estimated that Project \nassistance will cover a rice production area of about 200,000 ha.29 The Project will help ease the \nfinancial  pressure  of  rising  input  prices  and  enable  target  farmer  households  to  use  quality  seed \nand  fertilizer  to  restore  crop  productivity.  Support  for  proposed  productivity  enhancement \ncomponent  under  the  project  will  contribute  significantly  to  increased  crop  yield  and  stability  of \nCambodia\u2019s national rice production and rice stock.   \n \nAn impact analysis was conducted on rising prices of seed and fertilizer on rice crop yields \n69. \nfor  the  without-project  and  with-project  scenarios.  Field  data  collected  during  the  fact-finding \nmission  indicated  that  seed  prices  increased  from  $300/t  in  2007  to  $400/t  in  June  2008,  and \nfertilizer prices increased from $434/t in 2007 to $627/t in June 2008. According to the Institute for \nMekong  Delta  Rice  Research  in  2007,  about  60%  of  the  land  used  for  growing  rice  in  the  Tonle \nSap Basin is cultivated using 50 kilograms (kg)/ha of fertilizer per crop, and the average yield is 2.5 \nt/ha  of  paddy  rice  per  crop.  Based  on  available  information  provided  by  the  institute  and  field \ninformation on targeted low-income farmers in the Tonle Sap Basin provinces, it is assumed that \n                                                \n \n27 Provinces of Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, Odor Meanchey, Pursat, and Siem \n\nReap. \n\n28 Beungkok, Stung Meanchey, and the Riverside. \n29 The total land area available for rice cultivation in Cambodia is estimated at 2.54 million ha. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n22 \n \n40%  of  200,000  ha  operated  by  the  targeted  farmers  is  cultivated  using  50  kg/ha  of  fertilizer  per \ncrop, and the average yield is 2.5 t/ha per crop. Due to the increase in prices of seed and fertilizer, \nthe area cultivated using fertilizer by low-income farmers would fall from 40% to 20% in 2008, 15% \nin 2009, and 10% in 2010. As a consequence, the total annual yield would fall from the 2007 level \nof  404,500  t  to  101,100  t  in  2010.  The  Project  assistance  is  assumed  to  help  restore  the  2007 \nproductivity  level.  From  the  perspective  of  Cambodia\u2019s  national  rice  stock,  the  analysis  indicates \nthat  in  the  without-project  scenario,  the  national  rice  stock  surplus  is  estimated  to  fall  from  1.27 \nmillion t at year-end 2007 to an average annual level of 0.88 million t for the 2008\u20132010 period. As \na  result  of  the  above  analysis,  the  Project  support  would  contribute  to  restore  this  level  during \n2008\u20132010 to ensure national food security (Supplementary Appendix F).  \n  \nB. \n\nPoverty and Social Impacts \n\nThe Project will help to restore the purchasing power of the poor and vulnerable who are at \n70. \ngreater  risk  of  hunger  and  malnutrition.  Those  most  vulnerable  to  food  price  shocks  will  be \nprotected  from  nutritional  deprivation,  erosion  in  real  income,  and  asset  shedding.  No  negative \nsocial  impact  is  foreseen  from  any  Project  activity.  The  major  social  impacts  of  the  Project  are \nexpected  to  be  positive.  The  nutritional  status  and  food  security  of  the  target  population  will \nimprove, and poverty will be reduced. Women, especially those who are heads of households, will \nbenefit  through  improved  entitlement  to  food  and  enhanced  income-earning  opportunities \nsupported  by  credit,  skills  development,  and  market  access.  Pregnant  and  lactating  women  will \nreceive  nutritional  supplements.  Particular  effort  will  be  made  to  ensure  participation  of  ethnic \nminorities. There will be no resettlement issue under any of the activities supported by the Project. \nThe summary poverty reduction and social strategy is outlined in Appendix 9. \n \nC. \n\nLand Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n\nA  resettlement  framework  was  not  prepared  since  the  Project  will  not  involve  any  land \n\n71. \nacquisition and resettlement. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n72. \nThe  proposed  Project  aims  to  reduce  vulnerability  of  food-insecure  households  through \nincreased access to food and production inputs. As part of the food-for-work program, rehabilitation \nof  needed  rural  infrastructure  will  be  carried  out  to  provide  employment  opportunities  for \ncommunities  and  facilitate  improved  productivity,  connectivity,  and  access  to  markets  and  social \nservices. Specific work accounts and communes will be identified during implementation based on \nthe needs and selection criteria, including environmental screening criteria. Since rehabilitation is \nsmall in scale and community-based, and mainly done by manual labor in a participatory manner in \ntarget  villages,  significant  potential  impacts  that  would  require  field  analysis  are  not  anticipated. \nTherefore, the Project is classified as Category C. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigations \n\nThe Government\u2019s social safety-net programs for protecting the poor and vulnerable groups \n73. \nare underdeveloped, and relevant institutions are weak in their capacity to run the social safety-net \nprograms.  The  concept  of  a  food  security  reserve  system  is  relatively  new  to  the  country,  and \nconcerned  institutions  lack  operational  skills  and  management  experience.  The  Project  design \nprovides  for  addressing  these  institutional  weaknesses  through  one  of  the  Project  outputs, \ncomponent  3  (Capacity  Development  for  Food  Crisis  and  Project  Management).  The  component \nscope  provides  for  (i)  establishment  of  an  independent  monitoring  system,  (ii)  establishment  of  a \nsystem of emergency food reserve and rapid response, and (iii) strengthening the capacity of the \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n \n\n23\n\nEA  and  IAs.  Governance  of  the  program  will  have  built-in  transparency  and  accountability  with \noutput monitoring and independent evaluation of effects and impact. The Project and attached TA \ninclude definitive fiduciary oversight of the funds provided and disbursed.  \n \n74. \nThe  immediate  procurement  program  may  face  risks if  there  is  a  shortage  of  grain,  seed, \nand fertilizer for purchase internally and externally, in which case prices will be high, thereby using \na significant share of project resources. This risk can be mitigated by staggering the purchase of \ngrains  and  extensive  canvassing  among  potential  suppliers  to  ensure  adequate  supply  at \nreasonable  price  both  within  the  Project  provinces  and  other  surplus  localities.  Given  that  seed \nsupply  sources  in  the  country  are  limited,  AQIP  Seed  Company  has  been  identified  as  the  main \nsupplier  of  seed,  and  provision  has  been  made  for  direct  procurement  of  rice  seeds  from  seed \nproducers  associations,  if  needed,  for  distribution  to  target  farmers.  Since  the  divestment  of  the \nnational  agricultural  inputs  supply  company,  the  private  sector  has  successfully  evolved  as  the \nimporter and supplier of fertilizers to local markets across the country.  \n \n75. \nLinking  of  short-term  safety-net  programs  with  long-term  productivity  improvement \nmeasures  will  be  a  challenge  as  it  will  require  speedy  design  and  implementation  of  investment \nprojects  by  a  multitude  of  Government  agencies  whose  capacity  is  limited.  The  Government \nrecognizes  the  challenge  and  has  initiated  actions  to  accelerate  implementation  of  ongoing \nprojects aimed at production improvement and livelihood development. The Government has also \nattached  priority  to  the pipeline  projects  of its  bilateral  and multilateral development  partners  that \nwill target rural development and poverty reduction.  \n \n76. \nThe  success  of  the  Project  relies  on  effective  community  mobilization  in  the  proper \nidentification and selection of target groups. The Project will mobilize local NGOs to supervise and \nmonitor  target-group  selection  and  distribute  food  and  inputs.  Due  to  the  large  volume  of \nemergency food to be distributed, there are potential risks in the areas of storage and distribution. \nEnhancement  of  public  sector  food  storage  capacity  is  now  a  priority  for  the  Government,  and  it \nhas taken steps to establish emergency food warehouses in strategic locations. The Government \nis currently working with the rice millers association and Green Trade to use their storage facilities. \nThe  Project  procurement  system  will  include  delivery  to  commune  distribution  points.  Commune \ncouncil buildings and facilities will be used for temporary storage prior to distribution to villages. \n \n\nVI. \n\nSTAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION AND CONSULTATION DURING \nIMPLEMENTATION \n\nThe  Government  has  set  up  the  NFSTF  with  membership  drawn  from  relevant  agencies \n77. \nincluding  MEF,  MAFF,  Ministry  of  Interior,  MRD,  Ministry  of  Planning,  MOWRAM,  NCDM,  the \nNational Institute of Statistics and the Supreme National Council to assist in, among other things, \nthe implementation of the Project, and provide feedback and advice, as appropriate, during Project \nimplementation.  Senior  officials  of  concerned  ministries  have  been  designated  members  of  the \nNFSTF, which is supported by technical experts. The task force is chaired by MEF and will meet as \noften as necessary, with participation of the Project implementation team. All stakeholders will be \ndirectly  involved  in  key  decisions,  especially  the  selection  of  target  groups,  assistance  package, \nformal \npolicy  reform, \nconsultation  forums,  such  as  NFSTF  and  PCDM  meetings,  community  discussion,  debate,  and \nconflict resolution will be encouraged through informal local committees. \n \n\ninstitutional  strengthening,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Beyond \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances  of  the  financing  agreement,  the  Government  has \n\n78. \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:   \n\n \n\n\f24 \n \n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nG).  \n\n \n\nThe Government will ensure that the target beneficiaries under Components 1 and 2 \nare  selected  in  strict  compliance  with  the  screening  and  selection  criteria  agreed \nbetween the Government and ADB. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  an  independent  monitoring  system  will  be \nestablished to monitor selection and distribution activities under Components 1 and \n2,  and  independent  NGO  monitors  will  be  recruited  for  this  by  ADB,  and  the \nmonitors will report to ADB and the NFSTF.  \nThe Government will ensure that the type of work that will be offered to the targeted \ngroup  under  the  food-for-work  program  will  be  decided  in  participation  with  the \naffected  communities.  The  work  so \nidentified  will  not  have  any  adverse \nenvironmental  impact  and  will  be  carried  out  on  vacant  land  owned  by  the \nGovernment,  free  from  all  encumbrances,  habitation,  dispute  or  controversy;  and \nproposals  for  civil  works  will  include  confirmation  that  no  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement  will  be  required  under  the  Project.  In  the  event  of  unforeseen  land \nacquisition or involuntary resettlement, the Government will immediately inform ADB \nand  prepare  the  necessary  planning  documents  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). If there are any indigenous peoples issues \nidentified, they will be appropriately addressed in a manner acceptable to ADB. \nThe Government will ensure that women and men will be paid equal remuneration \nfor work of equal value. Child labor will not be allowed. \nThe Government will ensure that a good governance framework will be prepared as \npart  of  the  Project  in  order  to  promote  good  governance  and  mitigate  corruption \nrisks.30 \nThe Government will ensure that (a) information about categories of target groups, \nnames  of  beneficiary  households  or  recipients  under  each  category,  and \nprocurement  activities  will  be  made  publicly  available  for  public  scrutiny;  (b)  a \ngrievance  mechanism  will  be  set  up  and  effectively  implemented  at  the  provincial \nlevel,  in  each  province,  and  a  focal  point  will  be  appointed  in  each  of  the  IAs  to \naddress  any  public  complaints  on  financial  irregularities  in  procurement  and \ndistribution  of  goods,  construction  of  works  and  other  services,  including  conflicts \narising  from  target  group  selection  that  cannot  be  resolved  by  the  respective \ncommune councils; (c) specific phone lines are dedicated, at the CPMU and ADB's \nCambodia  Resident  Mission,  to  be  used  by  the  public for reporting  of irregularities \nand  misappropriation  of  the  project resources, if  any,  and  advertised  to  the  public; \nand (d) the EA provides a bi-annual review and report to the NFSTF and ADB on all \nrelevant complaints received and resolutions undertaken. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  counterpart  funds  required  during  the  Project \nimplementation period are provided on time at the central and provincial levels; (b) \nannual budgetary appropriation requests are submitted in a timely manner; and (c) \nappropriated funds are disbursed promptly when needed for Project implementation \npurposes. \n\n(viii)  The Government will comply with, or will cause the EA and the IAs to comply with, \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time to time). The Government \n(a)  acknowledges  ADB\u2019s  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any \nalleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project; \nand (b) agrees to cooperate fully with, and to cause the EA and the IAs to cooperate \nfully  with,  any  such  investigation  and  to  extend  all  necessary  assistance,  including \n\n                                                \n \n30 A draft Good Governance Framework  has  been prepared and agreed by the Government (Supplementary Appendix \n\n\f \n \n\n25\n\nproviding  access  to  all  relevant  books  and  records,  as  may  be  necessary  for  the \nsatisfactory completion of any such investigation. \n\nto \n\n(x) \n\nthe  above  requirements, \n\n(ix)  Without limiting the generality of the preceding paragraph, the Government will (a) \nensure  that  the  EA  conducts  periodic  inspections  on  the  contractors\u2019  activities \nrelated  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  and  (b)  ensure  and  cause  the  EA  to \nensure  that  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and \naccounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service \nproviders as they relate to the Project.  \nincrease \nIn  addition \ntransparency,  the  Government  will  cause  the  EA  to  maintain  a  Project-specific \nwebpage  on  its  website  to  disclose  information  about  procurements  related  to  the \nProject. For each contract, the webpage shall include information on, among others, \nthe list of participating bidders, name of the winning bidder, basic details on bidding \nprocedures adopted, amount of contract awarded, and the list of goods and services \nprocured.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects 9.1% growth for \n2007,  7.9%  growth  for  2008,  and  7.5%  annual  growth  for  2009\u20132012. 1   The  construction, \ngarments, and tourism sectors have contributed most to GDP growth. Rapid economic growth \nhas led to a significant reduction in the poverty rate over the decade of 1993/94\u2013 2004.2 \n \n\n2. \nCambodia  has  a  total  land  area  of  181,035  square  kilometers.  The  country  consists  of \n20  provinces,  three  cities,  and  one  municipality,  and  is  divided  into  184  districts,  1,621 \ncommunes,  and  13,707  villages.  Of  the  total  land  area,  67%  (12.1  million  hectares  [ha])  is \nclassified as forest area; the cultivated area is 21% (3.78 million ha), with 91.2% of this devoted \nto  paddy  cultivation.  The  main  crops  are  paddy  (wet  season,  dry  season,  receding,  and \nfloating),  corn,  soybean,  mung  bean,  cassava,  sugarcane,  peanut,  sesame,  sweet  potato, \nChinese cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, watermelon, and tobacco. Plantation and industrial crops \ninclude rubber, cashew nut, pepper, palm sugar, palm oil, and fruit (mango, pineapple, jackfruit, \ndurian,  rambutan,  and  banana).  Forest  products  include  teak  wood  and  acacia  (timber),  and \nnontimber  forest  products  such  as  bamboo,  grass,  fodder,  honey,  mushrooms,  and  firewood. \nFish  production  (freshwater,  community,  and  ricefield  production,  aquaculture,  and  marine)  in \n2004 was 321,000 tons (t). The share of agriculture, fisheries, and forestry in the total economy \ndeclined from close to half (46%) in 1993 to under a third (30%) in 2006. Within agriculture, the \nshare of the crop sector increased from about 40% of total GDP to about 50%. Correspondingly, \nthe share of the noncrop sectors declined from about 60% of total GDP to 50%. This is contrary \nto the expectation that, over time, the contribution of the non-crops subsector to the growth of \nthe agriculture sector and the overall economy will rise. The share of agriculture, fisheries, and \nforestry in total employment declined from 70% in 2001 to 57% in 2006.3 \n \n3. \nThe importance of the agriculture and natural resources sector to poverty reduction and \nfood security and the need for a holistic approach to rural development are highlighted by the \ncurrent global food price crisis, which is straining resources and public order in many developing \ncountries.  Underinvestment \nthe  natural  resource  base, \nin  agriculture,  degradation  of \nmisallocation of land, declining food stocks, and lack of exchange entitlement of the poor, have \ncombined with a host of cyclical and long-term factors affecting supply and demand and prices \nto  put  the  lives  of  millions  in  jeopardy.  Within  the  above  context,  the  situation  confronting \nCambodia  merits  close  scrutiny.  Paddy  rice  production  increased  from  3.5  million  t  in  1996  to \nabout 6.7 million t in 2007; the milled rice surplus was estimated at 1.6 million t in 2007.4 Much \nof  the  marketed  surplus  finds  its  way  out  across  the  border  to  Viet  Nam  unprocessed.  This \nsurplus, though, does not mean absence of hunger, as it is pervasive among vulnerable groups \nduring  the  wet  season.  In  parallel  with  the  international  market,  rice  prices  in  the  domestic \n\n                                                 \n1  IMF.  2007.  IMF  Country  Report  No.  07/290.

Table 1. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nIssues \n\nmarket  increased  throughout  2008, 5   while  grain  continued  to  be  exported  to  Viet  Nam, \ninformally lured by high prices, forcing the Government to finally call for a temporary ban on rice \nexports for 2 months (although it was lifted later). The vulnerability of Cambodia arises not only \nfrom exports and pockets of hunger but also from the fact that the Government does not have \nan emergency procurement system or strategic reserve to deal with potential food crisis. It has \nvery little private and public storage and processing capacity in the country, which aggravates \nthe situation. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe slow pace of rural development has resulted in the declining capacity of agriculture \nto support the growing population and absorb the additional labor force. Agricultural growth has \nlagged behind GDP growth and has shown wide yearly variations. The Government has made \nattempts  to  move  away  from  a  rice-based  agricultural  economy  by  promoting  diversification \ntogether  with  the  expansion  of  non-farm  rural  activities.  These  initiatives  did  not  receive  the \nnecessary  resource,  policy,  and  institutional  support,  with  the  result  that  low  rural  incomes \npersist and income inequality has increased. Low incomes and increasing inequality have led to \nthe high incidence of rural poverty (37%). As IMF puts it, despite robust economic growth in the \npast  several  years,  rural  poverty  in  Cambodia  has  remained  stubbornly  high.  That  is  not  all. \nFood  insecurity  affects  about  a  fifth  to  a  third  of  rural  households,  and  persists  even  during \ncropping  seasons.  With  a  low  level  of  commercial  and  industrial  development,  the  pressure  is \nheavier  on  the  natural  resources  sector  to  provide  additional  means  of  subsistence  to  the \npoverty stricken farmers and landless population.  \n \nFactors that hinder growth in agriculture are (i) low factor productivity; (ii) bio-insecurity; \n5. \n(iii)  lack  of  access  to  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT);  (iii)  lack  of  market \naccess for products, inputs, services, and alternative employment and livelihood; (iv) poor risk \nmanagement to hedge against uncertainties and fluctuations; (v) policy inadequacies and slow \nimplementation  of  the  reform  process;  and  (vi)  weak  governance  and  institutions  and  lack  of \nparticipation. Each of these can be traced back to a set causes. Low productivity is caused by \npoor  resource  management,  lack  or  inadequate  access  to  resources,  lack  of  education  and \nskills, poor health and nutrition, weak extension and research, and lack of social and physical \ninfrastructure. Bio-insecurity emanates from loss of biodiversity, threat to food safety, and loss \nof  environmental  sustainability.  Access  to  ICT  is  constrained  by  low  investment,  lack  of \nhardware and software, lack of ICT skills and training, lack of markets, and lack of power and \nconnectivity.  Lack  of  market  access  is  due  to  the  low  level  of  comparative  and  competitive \nadvantage  and  the  low  level  of  regional  integration,  market  fragmentation,  and  inadequate \ninfrastructure,  asymmetry  of  information,  and  slow  private  sector  development.  Poor  risk \nmanagement is caused by lack of capacity to analyze and manage risks and low resilience to \nnatural disasters. Policy inadequacies are manifested in the absence of supporting legislation, \nweak  capacity  to  implement  new  laws,  lack  of  incentives  for  improved  resource  management, \nand  inadequate  budget  allocation  for  infrastructure  and  public  works.  Weak  governance  and \ninstitutions  are  linked  to  lack  of  appropriate  institutions;  weak  structure  and  organization;  poor \nmanagement and leadership; a weak financial sector; weak civil society and community-based \norganizations; and overlap, duplication, and poor agency and sector coordination. \n                                                 \n5   According to the Economic Institute of Cambodia (available: http://www.eicambodia.org/), as of 5 May 2008 the rice \nprice had increased by 100% to KR3,150/kilogram (kg) in a year; fish and meat prices had increased by 30%\u201360%. \nField investigation by an Asian Development Bank (ADB) fact-finding mission revealed that over the past year the \nprice  of  average-quality  rice  had  increased  by:  163%  in  Odor  Meanchey,  164%  in  Banteay  Meanchey,  103%  in \nBattambang,  45%  in  Kampong  Chhnang,  113%  in  Kampong  Thom,  63%  in  Pursat,  and  105%  in  Siem  Reap \nprovince, with the seven-province average rise being 113%.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2          31 \n\n \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\nC. \n \n6. \nDuring  the  past  decade,  the  Government  articulated  a  number  of  strategies  and \nprograms  aimed  at  promoting  socioeconomic  development  and  poverty  reduction 6 .In  2004, \nfor  Growth, \nPrime  Minister  Samdech  Hun  Sen  presented  The  Rectangular  Strategy \nEmployment,  Equity  and  Efficiency  at  the  Third  Legislature  of  the  National  Assembly.  The \nstrategy  stressed  that  the  role  of  agricultural  policy  is  \u201cto  improve  agricultural  productivity  and \ndiversification, thereby enabling the agriculture sector to serve as the dynamic driving force for \neconomic growth and poverty reduction\u201d.  \n \n7. \nIn  addition,  the  Technical  Working  Group  on  Agriculture  and  Water  (TWGAW)  of  the \nMinistry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) and the Ministry of Water Resources and \nMeteorology  (MOWRAM)  formulated  the  Strategy  for  Agriculture  and  Water,  2006\u20132010,7  as \nrequired by the Second Socioeconomic Development Plan, together with five subsector action \nprograms,  including  one  on  food  security.  The  Working  Group  on  Food  Security  and  Nutrition \nprepared Cambodia\u2019s National Strategic Framework for Food Security and Nutrition (SFFSN)8, \n2008\u20132012.  The  stated  goal  of  the  framework  is  that  by  2012,  poor  and  food-insecure \nCambodians will have substantially improved physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, \nand nutritious food, at all times, to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active \nand  healthy  life.  This  is  to  be  achieved  through  increased  food  production  and  employment \ncreation,  better  natural  resource  management,  improved  food  use  and  utilization,  enhanced \ncapacity  to  cope  with  food  shocks,  and  policy  and  institutional  reform.  However,  Cambodia\u2019s \nefforts  to  maintain  SFFSN\u2019s  goal  and  objectives  are  being  challenged  by  escalating  prices  of \nfood, high prices of crop inputs, and budgetary stress. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nBy  the  end  of  2007,  Cambodia  had  received  $945  million  for  42  loans,  $104  million  in \nnine grant projects, and $94 million for 144 technical assistance projects. In the agriculture and \nnatural resources sector, Cambodia had received $184 million for nine loans, $30 million in two \ngrant  projects,  and  $18  million  for  26  technical  assistance  projects.  The  (Asian  Development \nBank's)  ADB\u2019s  operations  in  Cambodia  are  guided  by  a  three-pronged  strategy:  (i)  policy  and \ninstitutional  reform  including  governance  reform  (program  loans,  technical  assistance  [TA] \ngrants,  and  contribution  to  the  Financial  Sector  Blueprint  2001\u20132010);  (ii)  rehabilitation  and \nconstruction  of  physical  and  social  infrastructure  (rural  roads,  irrigation,  water  supply  and \nsanitation, and commune council buildings and others); and (iii) natural resource management \n(projects and TA under the Tonle Sap Initiative). Policy and institutional reforms are an ongoing \nprocess  to  which  ADB\u2019s  contribution  has  been  substantial,  especially  in  agricultural  policies, \nresearch,  and  financial  sector  reform.  ADB-financed  rural  roads  have  strengthened  market \nlinkages  and  improved  mobility;  irrigation  schemes  are  providing  water  for  irrigation,  thereby \nincreasing agricultural production and reducing poverty; water supply and sanitation works have \ncontributed  to  better  health;  while  the  recently  completed  commune  council  buildings  will \n\nADB Strategy \n\n                                                 \n6  These  are  (i)  National  Program  to  Rehabilitate  and  Develop  Cambodia,  1994\u20131995;  (ii)  First  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment  Plan,  1996\u20132000;  (iii)  Long-Term  Triangle  Strategy,  2001\u20132015;  (iv)  Second  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment  Plan,  2001\u20132005;  (iv)  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy,  2003\u20132005  promulgated  in  December \n2002; and (v) National Strategic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010. \n\n7  Technical  Working  Group  on  Agriculture  and  Water.  2008.

Finally, the Tonle Sap Initiative, with projects \nand TA, provides the blueprint for protecting the Tonle Sap environment and resources, hence \nprotecting the livelihood of communities in six provinces surrounding the lake. Notwithstanding \nthese  accomplishments,  ADB  operations  in  the  agriculture  and  natural  resources  and  other \nsectors suffer from lack of synergy, which limits realization of the multiplier effect. \n \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program for 2005\u201320099 has three components: (i) fostering \n9. \nbroad-based private sector-led economic growth, (ii) pursuing inclusive social development, and \n(iii)  strengthening  governance  for  development.  The  country  operations  business  plan  for \nCambodia  for  2008\u2013201010  seeks  to  realign  the  focus  on  agriculture  and  rural  development, \nprivate  sector  development,  and  risk  management  through  governance  reform.  In  agriculture, \nthe  focus  will  shift  to  rural  transport,  rural  credit,  skills  development,  other  infrastructure,  rural \nelectrification,  and  service  delivery.  In  terms  of  country  programming,  major  elements  of \nsequential  interventions  are  being  conceived  in  (i)  emergency  assistance  in  response  to  the \nglobal  food  price  rise,  (ii)  rural  development,  (iii)  rural  energy,  (iv)  non-farm  activities,  (v)  rural \ncredit,  (vi)  private  sector  development,  and  (vii)  governance  and  capacity  building.  Under  the \ncurrent country strategy and program sector outcomes are (i) increased agricultural production \nthrough  increasing  agricultural  land  under  irrigation  and  rice  yield,  (ii)  improved  market \nenvironment  for  private  agro-based  enterprise  growth,  (iii)  effective  decentralized  rural  service \ndelivery,  (iv)  sustainable  management  and  conservation  of  natural  resources,  (v)  reduced \neconomic  losses  from  floods  and  droughts,  (vi)  deepening  of  the  Tonle  Sap  Initiative  as  an \noperational  piloting  of  such  multisector  rural  poverty  reduction,  (vi)  expansion  of  the  public \nfinancial  management  reform  program  for  rural  development  to  ensure  effective  delivery  of \nagriculture  and  rural  development  and  catalyze  additional  donor  support,  and  (vii)  subregional \ninitiatives in new agriculture solutions. \n \n10. \nAt  its  Annual  Meeting  in  Madrid  in  May  2008,  ADB  announced  a  comprehensive \nstrategic  approach  to  deal  with  soaring  food  prices.  Within  its  long-term  strategic  framework \n2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020)11,  ADB  outlined  short-term  responses  and  medium-  to  long-term \nresponses to the food price crisis in Soaring Food Prices, Response to the Crisis 12. The short-\nterm  response  will  include  targeted  interventions  to  protect  the  food  entitlements  of  the  most \nvulnerable groups and income and livelihood programs for the poor. In the medium to long term, \nADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  agriculture  and  natural  resources  sector  would  seek  to  (i)  enhance \nproductivity  growth;  (ii)  promote  biosecurity;  (iii)  improve  access  to  ICT;  (iv)  improve  market \naccess  and  income  diversification;  (v)  encourage  better  risk  management;  (vi)  continue  the \ndialogue to deepen and widen policy reform; and (vii) strengthen institutions, enhance capacity \nand skills, and promote good governance. Such assistance would be considered in the broader \nframework of agriculture\u2019s links to the rural and wider national economy. \n\n \n                                                \n9   ADB. 2004.

The outcome is strengthened institutions dealing with food crisis. The TA will \nhave  four  outputs:  (i)  establishment  of  an  independent  monitoring  system  to  oversee  target-\ngroup  selection,  distribution  of  food and  inputs, organization  and  management  of  the  food-for-\nwork  program,  and  compliance  with  fiduciary  requirements;  (ii)  development  of  a  system  of \nemergency  food  reserve  and  rapid  response;  (iii)  strengthening  of  financial  management \ncapacity  of  the  executing  agency  (EA),  implementing  agency  (IA),  and  provincial  project \nmanagement  units  (PPMUs),  including  longer-term  capability  to  deal  with  food  emergencies; \nand (iv) management and monitoring of Project implementation. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  TA  will  involve  oversight  and  capacity  building.  The  oversight  function  will  cover \nmonitoring and auditing by independent agents. Capacity building will cover direct consultancy \nexpert  input  for  system  development  and  human  resource  upgrading  through  on-the-job \ntraining.  Key  tasks  include  (i)  assessing  the  overall  state  of  food  security  in  Cambodia;  (ii) \nmonitoring the state of poverty and hunger in project provinces; (iii) assessing the potential for \nagricultural  productivity  improvement  in  project  area;  (iv)  assisting  in  identification  of  rural \nmarket link roads and irrigation channels which could be rehabilitated immediately through the \nfood-for-work  program;  (v)  assessing  the  existing  food  and  input  procurement  and  distribution \nsystem  including  logistics;  (vi)  assessing  the  capacity  of  nongovernment  organizations  and/or \ncommunity-based  organizations  in  the  Project  area  to  undertake  beneficiary  mobilization  for \nparticipation  in  and  implementation  of  project  activities;  (vii)  examining  the  impact  of  free  food \ndistribution, the food-for-work program, and subsidized input distribution on prices, supply, and \ndemand  in  the  market;  (viii)  monitoring  (a)  target-group  selection,  (b)  procurement  and \ndistribution of food and inputs, (c) organization and management of the food-for-work program, \nand  (d)  compliance  with  fiduciary  requirements;  (ix)  establishing  a  food  security  database;  (x) \nstrengthening  financial  management  capacity  of  EA,  IA,  and  PPMUs,  including  longer-term \ncapability  to  deal  with  food  emergencies;  and  (xi)  developing  a  system  of  emergency  food \nreserve and rapid response, including size of reserve, strategic location, procurement, utilization \nand  replenishment,  organizational  and  institutional  structure,  legal  and  regulatory  framework, \noperational  modalities,  physical \ninfrastructure  and  equipment,  early  warning  systems, \nidentification and monitoring of indicators, crop assessment, and reporting and dissemination. \n \nC. \n\nCosts and Financing \n\n3. \nIt  is  estimated  that  the  consulting  services  for  capacity  development  and  project \nmanagement will cost $4.72 million, of which the attached TA will finance $1.50 million, the fund \nallocated  under  component  3  will  finance  $3.12  million,  and  the  Government  will  provide \n$100,000  as  part  of  the  TA  to  cover  incremental  administrative  expenses,  office  space,  local \ntravel,  and  per  diem  for  counterpart  staff.  Retroactive  financing  for  a  maximum  of  30%  of  the \ntotal TA amounts will be considered for eligible expenditure incurred not earlier than 22 August \n2008,  provided  that  the  expenditure  is  in  compliance  with  the  following  conditions:  (i)  it  is  in \naccordance  with  acceptable  procedures  specified  by  ADB,  (ii)  it  is  verified  by  ADB,  (iii)  it  is \ncertified by MEF, and (iv) the certification is acceptable to ADB.\u00a0 Cost estimates and a financing \nplan is in Table A7.1. \n\n \n\n\fTable A7.1: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan for Technical Assistance for Capacity \nDevelopment and Project Management \n($\u2019000)\u00a0\n\n46 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nItem\n\nA.

The  proposed  implementing  agencies  include  MEF  for \n4. \ncapacity  building,  and  MEF,  the  National  Committee  for  Disaster  Management,  and  provincial \ncommittee  for  disaster  management  for  independent  monitoring  and  emergency  food  reserve \nand rapid response system. The  National Food Security Task Force will provide overall policy \nguidance for the TA implementation and monitor activities of the TA.  \n \n5. \nThe TA will be implemented over a period of 24 months beginning in October 2008. To \nensure  harmonious  inputs  and  outputs  of  consulting  services  and  independent  monitoring \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n47 \n\nservices,  the  TA  fund  and  the  fund  allocated  under  component  3  will  be  utilized  as  a  merged \nsource to achieve outputs stated in para 1.  \n \n6. \nOverall,  a  total  of  312  person-months  of  consulting  services,  comprising  54  person-\nmonths of international and 258 person-months of national consultants, will be provided by the \nattached TA fund and the fund allocated under component 3. The attached TA will provide 119 \nperson-months  of  consulting  services,  comprising  30  person-months  of  international  and  89 \nperson-months of national consultants. The work of the consultants will be coordinated and led \nby an international team leader and a national project manager. Other individual consultants will \nhave  core  expertise  in  procurement  and  logistics,  sociology  and  community  facilitation,  food \nsecurity, and project facilitation at the provincial level. NGOs will be contracted as independent \nmonitors  of  key  project  activities.  A  tentative  schedule  of  consultant  expertise  (in  person-\nmonths)  is  provided  in  Table  A7.2.  The  international  team  leader,  national  project  manager, \nprocurement/logistics  expert,  sociologist/community  facilitator,  and  provincial  facilitators  will  be \nengaged directly by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  For  the  remaining  consulting  services,  a  firm  will  be  recruited \nfollowing  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  using  the  80:20  ratio  for  scores  related  to \ntechnical  and \nfollowing  consultants' \nqualifications selection procedures. \n \n\nfinancial  proposals.

POVERTY ISSUES \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n\nCambodia\u2019s National Strategic Framework for Food Security and Nutrition (SFFSN, 2007\u20132010) aims to provide poor and food-\ninsecure Cambodians with improved physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary \nneeds and preferences. In recent months, soaring food prices, along with fuel and crop input prices, have severely hampered \nthe attainment of Cambodia\u2019s national strategy to increase food supply and capacities of food-insecure households to cope with \nrisks and vulnerabilities to price shocks. The food crisis has further increased food-deprived vulnerable groups from 20% of the \ntotal population to 35%. As of June 2008, it is estimated that 4.5 million people (35%) are living below the food poverty line. The \nproject  responds  to  the  Government  of  Cambodia\u2019s  request  to  provide  short-term  assistance  to  reduce  vulnerability  of  food-\ninsecure households through increased access to food and production inputs, and to keep on track with SFFSN targets. This is \nconsistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank's  (ADB\u2019s)  country  strategy  and  program  (2005\u20132009)  and  Strategy  2020a  that \nsupport  measures  in  response  to  disasters  and  emergencies  such  as  food  crisis  to  protect  the  food  entitlements  of  the  most \nvulnerable groups and income and livelihood programs of the poor. \n \nB.     Targeting Classification: TI-H      \n\nThe  project  will  target  vulnerable  and  at-risk  categories  as  follows:  (i)  landless  households  (ii)  daily  casual  laborers;  (iii)  low \nincome;  (iv)  women-headed  households;  (v)  handicapped,  physical,  and  chronic  illnesses,  including  AIDS  and  tuberculosis \naffected;  (vi)  lowest  quintile  of  farmers  (the  poorest  20%  of  national  population,  having  less  than  1  hectare  [ha]);  (vii)  ethnic \nminority groups; (viii) vulnerable school children; (ix) pregnant and lactating mothers; (x) fixed salary workers and urban poor \nslum dwellers. \n\nC.  Poverty Analysis \nIn May\u2013June 2008, ADB conducted a socioeconomic profile assessment of eight provinces with participation from districts and \ncommunes to identify targeted vulnerable groups. Similarly, Cambodia Development Resource Institute (CDRI, an EU-funded \nproject,  is  currently  undertaking  a  comprehensive  survey  on  poverty  impact  of  the  food  crisis  in  Cambodia  to  help  donors \nidentify  appropriate  responses  and  inform  their  programming  assistance.  The  participatory  poverty  assessment  provides \nstatistical  and  qualitative  information  to  design  measures  to  address  issues  relating  to  efficient  and  effective  delivery  of  the \nproject to targeted beneficiaries.  \n\nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \n\nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nIt was apparent that the poor were the most affected by the rising food prices and accompanying price hikes in fuel and crop \ninputs. The coping mechanisms included reduction in food intake by the poor, and deterioration in the quality of food, negatively \naffecting people's nutritional levels. The temporary suspension of the school feeding program by the World Food Programme in \nMay 2008 was disruptive, signaling uncertainty in food supply, and observed increased absences in school attendance.    \n \nThe  main  agricultural  inputs  of  fertilizer,  quality  rice  seeds,  and  capital  are  also  in  short  supply.  Farmers  cope  by  reducing \nfertilizer  use  and  substitute  poor-grade  rice  seeds  for  high-quality  rice  seeds,  thereby  limiting  their  yield.  Some  farmers  use \norganic  fertilizers  to  supplement  or  substitute  for  chemical  fertilizers,  or  do  not  use  fertilizer  at  all  in  less  favorable  land. \nReduction  in  real  wages  due  to  inflation  also  meant  that  young  female  workers  in  textile  factories  and  the  service  sector  are \nunable to send remittances to their families in the rural areas. The increasing cost of living in urban areas potentially threatens \nopportunities for women\u2019s employment in industrial and service sectors while their families recall them to the rural areas where \nthe cost of living is relatively affordable, and where women provide additional help with farm work during the peak season.  \n \nIn  the  selected  project  sites  in  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin,  it  is  estimated  that  the  loss  in  households\u2019  purchasing  power  is  $209.9 \nmillion, or 41.4% of the nationwide purchasing burden of $506.5 million. The population of the Tonle Sap Basin is around 30% \nof the national population, which suggests that the Tonle Sap Basin is suffering more seriously than the rest of the country and \nrequires emergency responses from the Government and development partners. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\nThis  emergency  response  project  was  conceptualized  in  consultation  with  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance;  Ministry  of \nAgriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; Ministry of Interior; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports; Ministry of Rural Development; \nNational  Committee for Disaster Management; and representatives  of donor  partners, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \nand  the  commercial  sector.  The  Government  has  demonstrated  strong  support  and  ownership  of  the  project.  Views  of  the \nWorld  Bank,  European  Commission,  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (German  Agency  for  Technical \nCooperation), Food and Agriculture Organization, World  Food Programme, and the United Nations  Development Programme \nwere  sought  on  potential  areas  for  collaboration,  procurement  strategy,  modalities  of  delivery  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  ease \nnegative impacts in the short term, and lessons learned were discussed at length.  \n \nThe  outputs  of  the  mission  were  (i)  a  memorandum  of  understanding  specifying  the  objectives  and  scope  of  the  project, \nimplementation arrangements, government assurances, costs and timing; and (ii) an estimate of the investment and financing \nplan. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues  \nWomen  often  manage  the  consumption  and  nutritional  requirements  of  the  household.  During  the  lean  and  food  shortage \nperiod,  women  tend  to  favor  the  needs  of  other  family  members,  especially  children,  over  their  own  nutritional  and  health \nneeds.  This  has  adverse  implications  for  women\u2019s  health  and  the  overall  food  security  of  the  household.  The  erosion  in \npurchasing  power  of  wage  workers  and  the  resulting  increase  in  the  cost  of  living  in  urban  areas  limit  women\u2019s  employment \nopportunities as their families living in the rural areas expect them to send remittances. The project will assist the Government \nto make food available to needy households in selected provinces, and create sufficient rice stocks to stabilize the market. The \ntargeted assistance will ensure access of women and children to food and relevant services.  \n\n2.  Key Actions  \nMeasures include equal access by men, women, and children within poor and vulnerable groups. The screening and selection \nprocess will be conducted by commune councils with support from village chiefs. The process will be subject to the supervision \nand monitoring by NGOs and/or community-based organizations acceptable to ADB. The intuitive wealth ranking approach will \nbe used to identify Project beneficiaries. Furthermore, a specific number of women-headed households will be targeted in the \ndevelopment  of  the  project  framework.  The  commune  councils  will  provide  the  mechanism  to  addresses  any  grievances \nregarding access to project benefits at the ground level. Women represented at commune and village councils will participate \nactively in the decision-making processes for food and production input support, and employment creation under the food-for-\nwork program, in order to ensure equal participation of women.   \n \nActivities under the food-for-work program will encompass rehabilitation of small tertiary irrigation canals and village roads, which \nwill  mainly  involve  manual  dredging,  resurfacing,  cutting  grass,  and  filling  up  road  holes  within  the  existing  right-of-way.  The \nrehabilitation  of  small  tertiary  irrigation  canals  will  help  optimize  the  project  assistance  by  completing  the  essential  package  of \nwater\u2013seed\u2013fertilizer  that  will  contribute  to  the  productivity  enhancement  for  coming  crop  seasons.  The  rehabilitation  of  village \nroads  will  help  enhance  connectivity  among  villages  and  communes,  ensuring  better  access  to  markets  and  social  services. \nThe program will comply  with national labor laws and regulations, particularly on child labor, and provide equal pay for equal \nwork regardless of gender and ethnicity. \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\nNature of Social Issue \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\nNo Impact \n\n \n\n \n\nLimited \n\n \nIndigenous Peoples \n \n \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact/Not Known \nThe project does not involve \nresettlement, land acquisition, \nor construction of \nwarehouses. \n\nPlan or Other Action \nRequired \n\n  Full Plan \n  Short Plan \n  Resettlement  Framework \n  No Action \n  Uncertain \n\nThere are no indigenous \npeoples in the project areas. \nThe project will benefit ethnic \nminorities in targeted \nlocations.  \n\n \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n  Indigenous Peoples \n\nFramework \n\n  No Action \n  Uncertain \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nLabor \n\n Employment Opportunities \n Labor Retrenchment \n Core Labor Standards \n\n \nAffordability \n\nLimited \n\n \n\n \n\n \nSignificant \n\nand/or \n\nRisks \n\n \nOther \nVulnerabilities \n HIV/AIDS \n Human Trafficking \n Others (conflict, political \n\ninstability, etc.), please \nspecify \n \n\n \nSignificant  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nAppendix 9      51 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n  No Action \n  Uncertain \n\n  Action \n  No Action \n  Uncertain \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n  No Action \n  Uncertain \n\nAdditional employment \nopportunities will be \ngenerated through the food-\nfor-work program. \n\nThe project will facilitate \naccess to food and \nagricultural inputs of fertilizer \nand rice seeds of the poor. \n \nThe project will design \nmeasures to ensure intended \nbenefits are not diverted away \nfrom the poor or misused by \ninfluential stakeholders.  \n \nAny further increase in food \nand crop inputs will adversely \naffect the poor.
