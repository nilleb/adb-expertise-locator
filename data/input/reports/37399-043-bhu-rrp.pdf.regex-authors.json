I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Bhutan for the additional financing of the Green Power Development Project.1  \n \n2.  The additional financing will cover a cost overrun for construction of the Dagachhu \nhydropower plant component of the project, which was approved in 2008. The higher-than-\nestimated  costs  have  mainly  resulted  from  unexpected  geological  conditions  found  during \nexcavation works for underground facilities. The overrun will not change the scope of the project \nand is relatively small in relation to the original cost estimate. The financial and economic \nviability of the component remains viable despite the overrun. There are no outstanding or new \nsafeguards issues.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The Green Power Development Project has two components: the Dagachhu hydropower \nplant, and a rural electrification program. Now nearing completion, the run-of-river generation \nplant will have an installed capacity of 126 megawatts (MW), and its output will be exported to \nIndia through an existing cross-border grid network.2 The electrification investment has been \ncompleted and provides electricity to 8,886 households and public institutions in remote rural \nareas by extending an existing grid and through the use of off-grid solar home systems.3  \n \n4.  The Dagachhu hydropower development is the first public\u2013private partnership in the \nBhutan\u2019s infrastructure sector. The private partner is the Tata Power Company, one of India\u2019s \npremier companies. Its subsidiary, the Tata Power Trading Company, will be the offtaker for the \nplant\u2019s electricity. The government\u2019s investment has been channeled through its national utility, \nthe Druk Green Power Corporation (DGPC). The new assets have been placed under a special \npurpose company\u2014the Dagachhu Hydro Power Corporation (DHPC). The government and its \npublic agencies own 74% of DHPC\u2019s shares.4 The project\u2019s rural electrification component was \nexecuted by another national utility, the Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC), and the Ministry of \nEconomic Affairs.5 \n \n5.  The remaining Dagachhu plant construction work will be physically completed by the \noriginal loan closing date of 31 December 2013. About 95% of the work is done.6 More than \n98%  of  the  overall  finance  extended  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been \ndisbursed, except for a small amount set aside for interest during construction.  \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans, Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grant, Technical Assistance Grant, and Administration of Grant to the Kingdom of Bhutan for \nthe Green Power Development Project. Manila. \n2  The Dagachhu hydropower plant is in southwestern Bhutan and 20 kilometers (km) from the border with India. \n3  The rural electrification component has achieved the target within the planned cost and timeframe. \n4  The project\u2019s shares are held by DGPC (59%), the National Pension and Provident Fund of Bhutan (15%), and the \nTata Power Company (26%).   \n5  BPC is mainly responsible for transmission and distribution while DGPC looks after generation. The off-grid rural \nelectrification was carried out by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.  \n6  The main works outstanding are (i) 0.3 km of tunnel excavation (out of 11 km in total), and (ii) overall aligning. The \nremaining rock conditions in the tunnel are good. The electromechanical equipment has been installed in an \nunderground powerhouse. The transmission line is ready to evacuate power. \n ", "2 \n6.  The original project cost was $234.5 million. ADB provided and administered $106.3 \nmillion under the financing plan (Table 1). The hydropower plant cost was estimated at $201.5 \nmillion, $80.0 million of which was to be provided by ADB in (i) a $29.0 million loan from the \nhard-term facility of the Asian Development Fund, and (ii) a $51.0 million loan from ordinary \ncapital  resources.  The  project  received  cofinancing  from  an  Austrian  commercial  bank\u2014\noperating under the Austrian export credit agency (OeKB)\u2014and Bhutan\u2019s National Pension and \nProvident Fund (NPPF). The balance has been mobilized as equities from the government and \nproject sponsors including DGPC, NPPF, and the Tata Power Company. \n \nTable 1: Original Financing Plan   \n($ million) \n   Dagachhu  Rural \nSource  Hydropower  Electrification  Total \nA.

On 26 February 2010, the Dagachhu hydropower component was registered as the \nworld\u2019s first cross-border Clean Development Mechanism project. DHPC later signed a certified \nemissions reduction purchase agreement with ADB, which acts as a trustee of the Future \nCarbon Fund, to sell carbon credits generated from the Dagachhu plant.   \n \n8.  The project was classified as safeguard category B for environment and resettlement \nand category C for indigenous peoples. No households were relocated for the plant component \nbut 25 were compensated for partial loss of land for the construction of access roads. All \nenvironmental safeguards have been complied with in full. The cost overrun raises no new \nsafeguard issues.  \n \n9.  The plant\u2019s planned capacity was optimized from 114 MW to 126 MW.7 The bid prices \nfor the equipment were 20% higher than the estimates, but this extra cost was financed by \nproportionate additional equity investments by the project sponsors.8 All civil work costs fell \nwithin the original estimate. However, the underground tunneling excavations required extra \nreinforcement due to unexpected poor geological conditions, which raised the cost of the works \nover time.9 The civil work costs were also increased by large escalations in the labor and \n                                                \n7  This optimization improved generation efficiency but did not change actual output substantially.  \n8  The 20% cost increase was over the original base cost plus contingencies.  \n9  Bad rock conditions led to extra costs. As a result, the contractor was allowed to raise unit rates. Contract \nvariations were also required for extra reinforcement.  \n ", "3 \nmaterial prices.10 The two factors combined raised the overall cost estimates for the Dagachhu \nplant by 16.6%.11 In spite of these cost increases, the project remains technically sound and \nfinancially  and  economically  viable.  The  sponsors  are  fully  satisfied  with  the  technical \nperformance of the contractors.12   \n \n10.  Construction of the Dagachhu plant is near completion. The overall project has been \nperforming well and is rated satisfactory on the ADB project performance rating system. It meets \nthe standard performance criteria of (i) expected output delivery; (ii) satisfactory implementation \nprogress;  (iii)  satisfactory  compliance  with  safeguard  requirements;  (iv)  successful  risk \nmanagement for implementation; and (v) an on-track rating in terms of technical performance, \ncontract awards, disbursements, financial management, and safeguard compliance.13 \n \n11.  The government is requesting additional financing from ADB to complete the project. \nThe government sees the Dagachhu hydropower development as a high national priority. The \nproject  has  been  implemented  along  with  its  Sustainable  Hydropower  Policy,  2008,  which \nintroduced private sector investment in hydropower development in Bhutan for the first time. \nADB is also helping the government prepare a second public\u2013private partnership project to \ngenerate hydropower for export as a follow-up to the Dagachhu project.14 The government thus \naims to accelerate power exports through both public and private investments. Based on an \numbrella agreement between Bhutan and India, an additional 10,000 MW of hydropower is to be \ndeveloped and exported by Bhutan by 2020.15 Bhutan now exports 70% of the electricity it \ngenerates to India, and the power sector is the largest source of both government revenue and \ngross domestic product.16 Hydropower is the backbone of Bhutan\u2019s economy.   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n12.  The impact will be sustained inclusive economic growth through cross-border power \ntrade and domestic electricity access. The outcome will be expanded coverage of sustainable \nclean power supply.17 \n \nC.  Outputs  \n \n13.  The outputs of the Green Power Development Project will be (i) constructed hydropower \nplant; (ii) extended rural electrification; and (iii) improved DGPC management systems. The \nDagachhu hydropower plant is expected to be commissioned in 2014 after construction work is \ncompleted within 2013. The intended rural electrification output has already been achieved \n(para.  3).  DGPC  management  systems  have  been  improved  as  a  result  of  capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance attached to the project.       \n                                                \n10 The unit prices of labor, cement, steel, and fuel were adjusted on the basis of a price adjustment formula under the \ncontract because prices for these commodities increased due to inflation over the period.   \n11 Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 There are two contractors: (i) India\u2019s Hindustan Construction Company for civil works, and (ii) an Austrian \nconsortium of Alstom and Andritz for electromechanical equipment.      \n13 Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB. 2011.

Three mega \nhydropower  projects  with  overall  capacity  of  about  3,000  MW  are  under  construction  under  the  umbrella \nagreement.  \n16 The power sector has contributed 30%\u201340% of annual government revenue since 2008. The power industry and \nrelated construction works make up one-third of the gross domestic product.  \n17 Revised Design and Monitoring Framework (Appendix 1).  \n ", "4 \nD.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR25,689,000 ($39 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (hard-term loan) \nto help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 \nyears,  an  interest  rate of 1.0% per  annum  during the grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements. The rest of the additional cost will be covered by the government and/or the project \nsponsors, calculated pro rata based on their shares of project equity.  \n \n16.  Because of local currency depreciation against the US dollars since the project approval, \nthe sponsors have had to make extra contributions  in ngultrum to cover the project costs \nexpressed in US dollar terms.19 The additional financing will be used to pay retroactive costs for \ncivil works and milestone base payments to be incurred in the remainder of 2013 and 2014. The \ngovernment will relend the ADB additional loan to DHPC at a higher fixed interest rate of 10% \n                                                \n18 The revised cost for the Dagachhu hydropower component alone is estimated at $241.5 million. \n19  The overall project costs including equities were originally estimated in US dollar terms. Each project sponsor was \nrequired to contribute around 30% more than its initial equity contribution.  \n ", "5 \nunder  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  on  terms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB.20 The \ngovernment  will  bear  the  currency  exchange  risk.  This  relending  arrangement  will  avoid \nsubsidizing DHPC\u2019s private development partner.

Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The project\u2019s scope is unchanged, and the implementation arrangements will remain the \nsame. The executing agency is DGPC, and the implementing agency is DHPC. As the special \npurpose project company, DHPC is fully staffed and functional.  \n \n18.  The additional financing will be used for extra costs of the existing Dagachhu civil works \nprocured under ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Retroactive financing will be allowed for an \namount not exceeding 20% of the additional financing loan amount for the civil work costs \nincurred prior to loan effectiveness of the additional financing and within 12 months of the \nsigning of the additional loan agreement.   \n \n19.  The Dagachhu hydropower plant is expected to be in full operation in April 2014 after \ntesting and commissioning.    \n \n20.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.21   \n                                                \n20 This rate is determined on the prevailing local financial market conditions. \n21  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2012\u2013December 2013a \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2013 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economic Affairs \n(ii)  Executing agency  Druk Green Power Corporation \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Dagachhu Hydro Power Corporation \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Dagachhu Hydro Power Corporation (with 121 staff) \nRetroactive financing   The existing civil work contract\u2019s expenditure will be for retroactive \nfinancing. \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and \nthe Asian Development Bank.  \na  Includes 12 months for the retroactive financing period prior to the loan effectiveness date. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n21.  To  reflect  the  increased  project  cost  in  the  tariff,  DHPC  agreed to revise  a  power \npurchase  agreement  (PPA)  with  the  offtaker.  DHPC  also  adopted  the  foreign  exchange \nfluctuation reserve fund to mitigate the currency exchange risk of foreign debt repayment.22  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n22.  The generators have been installed in the plant\u2019s underground powerhouse, and 19 km \nof 220 kV transmission lines from the plant are completed and ready to evacuate power. The \nmajor remaining work is tunnel excavation, although it involves only 0.3 km of the 11 km total \nworks.23 The assessment of an ADB project site technical inspection was that this would be \ncompleted before the loan closing date of 31 December 2013. DHPC intends to operate the \nplant at full generation capacity in the second quarter of 2014, when the next rainy season starts. \nSince Dagachhu will be the country\u2019s fifth major hydropower plant, the staff of DGPC and DHPC \nare  experienced  in  plant  operations.  The  project  construction  designs  and  operations  are \ntechnically sound.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  The PPA base tariff was increased from Rs2.4 per kilowatt-hour to Rs2.9 per kilowatt-\nhour on a cost-plus basis (para. 21). The conservative financial internal rate of return adjusted \nfor higher tariffs and costs is 2.61%, higher than the weighted average cost of capital.24 The \neconomic  adjusted  internal  rate  of  return  is  16.04%,  and  the  Bhutan\u2013India  subregional \n                                                \n22 The power sales are priced in Indian rupees. To mitigate the foreign currency exchange risk during the loan \nrepayment period, part of DHPC profits and losses arising out of the foreign exchange rate fluctuation will be \nreserved in a separate account every year.  \n23 This is the status as of 31 July 2013. The excavation work progressed by 0.9 km over 5 months during March\u2013July \n2013. The tunneling works and geological investigation have been supported by experienced resident international \nconsultants under the technical assistance provided by Austria.  \n24 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR) and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) are calculated in real terms on an after-tax basis. WACC \nis estimated at 1.60% in real terms. In nominal terms, FIRR is 8.17%, compared with a WACC of 7.29% (FIRR \nestimated under the original loans was 10.44% in nominal terms). \n ", "7 \neconomic internal rate of return with the adjustments is 22.57%.25 These results exceed the \nhurdle  rates  by  margins  sufficient  to  substantiate  the  project\u2019s  financial  and  economic \nsustainability with the additional financing. \n \n24.  Climate change modeling analysis has suggested hydrological increases in the project \narea for the future, which would enable the plant to increase annual generation output (para. \n32). The revised PPA includes profit-sharing mechanisms to sell electricity in the India\u2019s power \ntrading market at higher rates. These scenarios will increase the power sales, and improve the \nDagachhu plant\u2019s financial and economic performance. Even under several negative business \nscenarios considered, DHPC will maintain the covenanted debt service coverage ratio of 1.2. \nThe additional financing will increase DHPC\u2019s financial leverage where the debt\u2013equity ratio will \nrise from 60:40 to 66:34.  \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  The ADB capacity development technical assistance provided under the original project \nwas successfully implemented and achieved institutional improvements. As a result, DGPC and \nDHPC adopted comprehensive corporate policies and manuals on accounting and financial \nmanagement, inventory and procurement management, internal audit, human resources, and \nsafeguards. In 2011, these improvements were supported by management information systems \nprovided through an enterprise resources system package. The external independent auditor \nreported that these entities have adequate internal control systems, suitable budgetary systems, \nadequate competitive bidding, and sufficient organizational system control to carry out their \noperations in an orderly and efficient manner. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, DGPC, and DHPC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  The  project  site  is  in  Dagana  District,  a  remote  area.  During  implementation,  the \nDagachhu development has greatly improved the local community\u2019s access to many services \nand opportunities. The following improvements have had a positive poverty and social impact in \nlocal communities:    \n(i)  Transportation. To carry heavy machines and materials, the conditions of roads \nand bridges in the area were drastically improved. These benefits were realized \nearly  on  in  project  construction.  Better  connectivity  and  improved  physical \naccessibility  are  greatly  needed  in  Bhutan\u2019s  remote  communities  due  to  the \ndifficulties of travel in the country\u2019s mountainous terrain.  \n(ii)  Social  services.  DHPC  adopted  its  corporate  social  responsibilities.  It \nconstructed and renovated school classrooms and provided school buses for \nsafe student transport. It made clinic services available to local people for free.26 \n(iii)  Electrification. Rural electrification was carried out in project area communities \nalong with Dagachhu plant\u2019s construction. BPC extended its distribution lines, \nwhich accelerated rural electrification in the project-affected areas and the district \noverall. This was the main tangible benefit from power generation development \n                                                \n25 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The economic internal rate of \nreturn was estimated at 13.80% under the original loans. The subregional economic internal rate of return was \n22.00% as well.  \n26 More than 1,600 local people had received the medical services as of February 2013.  \n ", "8 \nfor local people. Most of households in the  project areas had no access to \nelectricity previously or only limited access on off-grid solar lighting.27   \n(iv)  Commercial  activities.  A  local  economic  boon  of  the  project  has  included \nemployment opportunities, rental income, increased small business activity, and \nsales of farm products to project staff and workers. 28  \n \n28.  The  original  project  aimed  to  sustain  the  country\u2019s  inclusive  economic  growth  by \npromoting cross-border power trade and access to domestic electricity access.29 Royalties from \nthe  project\u2019s  power  export  revenue  will  help  sustain  affordable  electricity  prices  for  rural \nhouseholds  through  a  clear  regulatory  framework.  The  power  exports  will  also  generate \nadditional government resources to promote socioeconomic development in rural areas.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  The cost overrun and additional financing will change neither the project\u2019s scope nor its \noriginal safeguards categorizations for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples. DHPC\u2019s environmental unit has provided ADB with periodic monitoring and updated \nreports on the implementation of safeguards.30 There are no outstanding safeguard issues.31 \n \n30.  Social safeguards. The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement \nand  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  In  June  2008,  DHPC  prepared  a  resettlement  plan.  The \nresettlement  activities  were  carried  out  under  this  plan  at  the  initial  stage  of  project \nimplementation  in  2008\u20132009,  before  the  construction  contract  award.  All  25  affected \nhouseholds who lost part of their land due to construction of plant access roads opted for land \nreplacement.32 Of these households, 20 also received cash compensation for crop losses on \ntheir  land  at fair market  value.33 There  are  no outstanding  involuntary  resettlement  issues \nassociated with the additional financing.   \n \n31.  Environmental safeguards. The project\u2019s environmental category is B. Based on an \ninitial environmental examination, an environmental management plan has appropriately been \ncarried  out.34 During  implementation,  DHPC  conducted  separate  studies  that  included  (i) \nadditional fish migration monitoring; (ii) water, soil, and air quality measurements; and (iii) \nappropriate  minimum  ecological  flow  assessment  based  on  more  data  on  seasonal  water \n                                                \n27 Almost 1,000 households in the project-affected areas were connected to the grid under BPC\u2019s own program after \nthe Dagachhu project started.    \n28 The Dagachhu project created about 1,500 job opportunities, including employment for about 300 local workers, \ndrivers, and helpers hired by DHPC and its contractors.   \n29 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nWhile the original project had positive gender impacts through the rural electrification component, the project as a \nwhole needed no gender elements or specific gender measures beyond the core labor standard requirements.    \n30 DHPC assigned five full-time staff to the unit. ADB provided capacity development technical assistance to train \nthem and develop the safeguard manuals.  \n31 Social Safeguard Compliance Assessment and Environmental Safeguard Compliance Assessment (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 The  affected  households  were  asked  to  choose  land  of  an  equivalent  size  and  similar  productivity  from \ngovernment-owned land to replace what the land they lost. In 2009, all had received ownership certificates for the \nreplacement lands. \n33 Cash compensation was done in two stages in May and September 2008. Because recent market data for crop \nand tree prices were lacking, the compensation rates were revalued by the government\u2019s property assessment \nvaluation authority. The resultant rates were 3\u20134 times higher than the previous rates. Bhutan has since based its \napproach to crop compensation in other projects on this practice.   \n34 A team of environmental experts and other experts from ADB, DGPC, and DHPC visited all project construction \nsites in May 2013. Site rehabilitation, slope stabilization, and tree planting were in evidence at all the sites. Other \nenvironmental management was satisfactory and reflected the requirements of the environment management plan. \n ", "9 \nquantity variation. Bhutan\u2019s National Environment Commission was also involved in the process. \nWhile there were no endangered or long-distance migratory fish in the Dagachhu River, DHPC \nadopted construction of a fish ladder to help maintain the native ecosystem. The commission \nhas verified periodic assessments of water, soil, and air quality. The minimum ecological water \nwas found sufficient to aquatic habitat conditions. While DHPC continues monitoring activities, \nthere are no existing or developing issues related to environmental safeguards. \n \n32.  Climate change impacts. Hydropower resources are vulnerable to negative climate \nchange  impacts.  Climate  change  modeling  analyses  were  undertaken  using  eight  climate \nmodels  from  various  organizations.  They  projected  long-term  water  flow  increases  in  the \nDagachhu  watershed  that  should  benefit  the  plant.35 The  analysis  showed  the  Dagachhu \nhydropower plant to be hydrologically sound and its adaptation design to be effective. The plant \nfaces low technical, financial, social, and environmental risks from climate change. It will have a \npositive  climate  change  impact  under  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism,  eliminating  the \n500,000 tons of potential carbon dioxide emissions that would otherwise be produced each year \nin India by fossil fuels to generate the electricity it will provide for export from Bhutan.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Since  the  Dagachhu  hydropower  plant  is  near  completion  and  adequate  mitigation \nmeasures have been built into the original design and implementation arrangements, the overall \nproject risks are considered low. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table \n5 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.36  \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nConstruction  The  major  work  outstanding  involves  only  a  short  distance  of  the  overall  tunnel \nrisk  excavation works. The work has been progressing steadily, and geological conditions \nhave been assessed as manageable. Experienced international geologist, engineers, \nand contractors are on site.     \nOperational  The plant\u2019s run-of-river hydropower operations are straightforward. DGPC staff with \nrisk  experience operating existing hydropower plants have been assigned to DHPC. The \n(management)  private  development  partner  (Tata  Power  Company)  has  sufficient  experience  in \nimplementing and operating other hydropower projects.    \nOfftake risk  A long-term PPA was signed with one of the leading power trading companies in India. \nThe offtaker\u2019s credit risk is further mitigated in the PPA by an adequate payment \nsecurity mechanism.   \nClimate  Climate change modeling analysis assesses the Dagachhu watershed as hydrologically \nchange risk  sound. Sufficient adaptation measures were adopted in the structures, facilities, and \nadjoining areas of the project to address such potential disasters as floods, landslides, \nand earthquakes.       \nCurrency risk  DHPC adopted a foreign exchange fluctuation reserve fund to mitigate the repayment \nrisk of foreign currency loans.  \nDGPC = Druk Green Power Corporation, DHPC = Dagachhu Hydro Power Corporation, PPA = power purchase \nagreement. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n                                                \n35 Climate Change Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Under the climate \nchange modeling analysis, the annual water flow in the Dagachhu watershed is projected to increase by 1%\u20134% \nduring the non-monsoon months (November\u2013March) and by 10%\u201315% during the monsoon months (June\u2013\nOctober) toward 2041\u20132060. \n36 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "10 \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n34.  The government, DGPC, and DHPC have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures, safeguards, gender, procurement, and disbursement as described in detail in the \nproject administration manual and loan documents. \n \n35.  The government, DGPC, and DHPC have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. A condition for the effectiveness \nof the additional financing will be that the subsidiary loan by the government to DHPC is \nacceptable to ADB in form and substance.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR25,689,000 to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the additional financing of \nthe Green Power Development Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest \ncharge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; \nfor a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n6 September 2013 \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORKa  \nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact       \nCurrent project   Current project  Current project  Current project \nCross-border power  Energy sector share of  Government fiscal  Assumptions \ntrade and increased  GDP raised from 25%  statements  Government\u2019s policy \ndomestic electricity  (2007) to 40% (2017),    priority on hydropower \naccess sustain inclusive  with annual GDP growth    export development \neconomic growth of  increased at least 2%\u2013   continues. \nBhutan  3% from 2012 to 2017     \n    India\u2019s bilateral funding \nEnergy sector share of  Government fiscal  for 10,000 MW in \ngovernment revenue  statements  hydropower \nraised from 45% (2007)    development continues.  \nto 75% (2020) through     \nclean energy export to    Bilateral and multilateral \nIndia with an additional    funding support for rural \n10,000 MW power    electrification is available \ngeneration (2020)    and timely.  \n     \nUse of electric lighting (to  Government power  Risk \nreplace kerosene lamps)  data book   Exogenous economic \nincreased from 40%    and political shocks \n(2007) to 100% (2013) of    occur.  \nrural households   \nWith additional financing  With additional financing  With additional financing   With additional financing \nUnchanged  Unchanged   Unchanged   Unchanged \nOutcome       \nCurrent project   Current project   Current project   Current project  \nCoverage of sustainable  Access to electricity of  Government power  Assumptions \nclean power supply  rural and urban  data book   Bilateral assistance from \nexpanded   households increased,    JICA for rural \n  with a cumulative    electrification is \nnational electrification    completed on time.  \nratio up from 60%     \n(2007) to 84% (2012)    The government \n    maintains the investment \nHydropower export  Government fiscal  program from both public \nrevenue of the total  statements  and private sectors in \ngovernment revenue    hydropower \nincreased from 40%    development.   \n(2007) to 45% (2013)      \n    With strong demand, a \nInvestment size from  Government power  supply shortage \nthe public and private  data book   continues in India\u2019s \nsectors to hydropower    power market.  \ndevelopment projects     \nincreased by at least    Risks \n1,314 MW by 2014    A serious default by the \n    offtaker in India occurs. \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nAnnual emissions  National Environment   \nequivalent to 500,000  Commission statistical  Natural disaster creates \ntons of CO  avoided in  reports  a significant hydrological \n2\na cross-border basis in    shortage for the plant. \n2013 and onward     \n     \nOverall power system  BPC and DGPC annual \nloss maintained below  reports \n10%, and power \nsector\u2019s financial health \nstable as indicated by \nsufficient debt service \ncoverage (minimum 1.2) \nand net profit \ngeneration \n \nWith additional financing   With additional financing   With additional financing   With additional financing   \nUnchanged  Increase in hydropower  Unchanged  Unchanged \nexport revenue and \nsaving in CO  emission \n2\nrealized from 2014  \nOutputs       \n1.        \nCurrent project  Current project  Current project  Current project \nHydropower plant  114 MW run-of-river  DHPC annual reports  Assumptions \nconstructed  Dagachhu hydropower    Counterpart funds, \n  plant constructed by    equities, and other \n2012     financing are mobilized \n    on schedule. \n19 km transmission line  BPC annual reports   \nto evacuate to the grid    Power purchase \nsystem constructed by    agreement and \n2012    shareholders agreement \n    continue to be valid.  \nClean and renewable  DHPC annual reports   \nenergy of additional 500    Risks \ngigawatt-hours (GWh)    Costs of commodities \nexported to India after  and raw materials and \n2012  currency appreciation \n  increase unexpectedly \nand beyond \ncontingencies. \n \nNatural disaster and/or \nunexpected geological \nconditions cause delays \nin construction. \n \nWith additional financing  With additional financing  With additional financing  With additional financing \n ", "Appendix 1  13 \nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nUnchanged.
