THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $300,000,000, comprising (i) a senior unsecured A loan of up to $200,000,000; and (ii) a B \nloan of up to $100,000,000 distributed among commercial lenders to the Joint Stock Commercial \nBank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BIDV) for the Mainstreaming Small and \nMedium-Sized Enterprises Lending Project in Viet Nam.1 The B loan will be syndicated by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to commercial banks and other eligible participants on a best-\neffort basis and subject to market conditions. \n2.  The proposed loan will support the growth of BIDV\u2019s lending to small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs), providing critically needed financial products to this underserved segment. \nAn increase in BIDV\u2019s capacity to serve SMEs will improve market standards and contribute to \nenterprise development and economic growth in Viet Nam through job creation. The longer-term \nfunding provided under the proposed loan will also assist BIDV to better balance its asset\u2013liability \nmaturity profile in line with the recent regulations of the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV). \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Finance sector overview. Viet Nam\u2019s financial system is relatively large in terms of \nnumber of lenders for a middle-income country, with D10,001 trillion in total assets for credit \ninstitutions as of fiscal year (FY) 2017. However, the system remains bank-centric, comprising 35 \ncommercial banks, 2 policy banks, 16 finance companies, 11 leasing companies, 1 cooperative \nbank, people\u2019s credit funds, 3 licensed microfinance institutions, 8 wholly foreign-owned banks, 2 \njoint venture banks, and 51 foreign bank branches in 2017. As of the end of 2017, total financial \nsector assets were D10,001 trillion. The four major state-owned commercial banks\u2014Agribank, \nBIDV, Vietcombank, and VietinBank\u2014continued to dominate banking, accounting for 45.7% of \nsubsector assets in 2017. \n \n4.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  banking  system  has  expanded  rapidly,  paralleling  the  country\u2019s  overall \neconomic growth since liberalization, with average credit growth of 23% per year (2005\u20132017). \nWhile immediate efforts by the SBV to manage these crises were effective, longer-term reform \nmeasures, such as the bank restructuring plan, are still in progress. In line with the SBV\u2019s strategic \nobjective to strengthen the capital base of domestic commercial banks, the implementation of \nBasel II standards is planned by 2020, with 10 banks, including BIDV, currently in the pilot phase. \n \n5.  SBV\u2019s efforts to tackle the bank\u2019s weak asset quality are also ongoing. In 2013, it adopted \ntighter loan classification standards as part of the measures to maintain the nonperforming loan \n(NPL) ratio below the prescribed 3.0%. This followed the establishment of the Vietnam Asset \nManagement Company (VAMC) in 2013, which buys NPLs from banks in exchange for a special \nclass of zero-interest bonds. Banks gradually provide these bonds, which typically have tenors of \n5 years (and exceptionally 10 years), to reach 100% coverage by maturity, at which point the \nNPLs (if still unresolved) are returned to the bank at zero book value in exchange for the fully \nprovisioned bond. In a sector report dated 5 February 2018, Moody\u2019s rates Vietnamese banks\u2019 \nprogress in resolving legacy problem assets as credit positive. The report highlights that with a \nfavorable macroeconomic environment and improved profitability, more banks are now capable \n                                                \n1  BIDV defines SMEs as companies with up to D500 billion of average annual revenues. \n \n ", "2 \nof increasing credit provisions and building up buffers against problem assets, allowing them to \nfully write down their VAMC bond holdings by the end of 2018.2 \n \n6.  Small and medium-sized enterprises overview. SMEs account for the majority of Viet \nNam\u2019s total business population, amounting to more than 590,000 active businesses.3 According \nto the White Book on Viet Nam\u2019s SMEs published by the Ministry of Plans and Investment, 97.6% \nof enterprises in Viet Nam are SMEs by the labor scale (fewer than 100 employees), accounting \nfor an estimated 40% of gross domestic product and over 50% of employment.4 Despite their \nsignificant contribution to the economy, SMEs encounter numerous obstacles that inhibit their \noverall development and economic potential. In addition to such constraints as difficulty with land \nuse rights, limited use of technological advancements that could enhance product development, \nand lagging efficiency and productivity, a key obstacle is access to finance. This is echoed by the \nVietnam  Bank  Association,  which  reports  that  Viet  Nam\u2019s  SMEs  have  faced  considerable \nchallenges in accessing credit. In a 2017 market study on Viet Nam\u2019s SMEs, the International \nFinance Corporation found that only 47% of male owners and 37% of women owners of SMEs \nhad received bank loans over the preceding 2 years. SMEs located in rural areas would find it \neven more difficult to access financing. The lack of adequate funding to support the working \ncapital and investment needs of SMEs has considerable implications, not only for the incremental \ngrowth of these enterprises and their job creation, but also for broader economic growth. The \nGovernment of Viet Nam views SMEs as one of its priority areas, as reflected in the recent Law \non Support for SMEs, which became effective in January 2018. The law aims to provide support \nto SMEs through government-sponsored mechanisms such as a new credit guarantee fund, tax \nincentives, subsidies to rent production sites in industrial zones, creation of incubators, training, \nand consultancies. \n7.  Investment  rationale.  Complementing  ADB\u2019s  sovereign  operations  to  reform  and \nmodernize Viet Nam\u2019s financial sector, ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations has met with several \nbanks in Viet Nam in recent years and seek to partner with suitable financial institutions to provide \nmeaningful impact and enhance their ability to serve underbanked segments. In 2017, ADB \napproved a $100 million loan to AB Bank for onlending to SMEs.5 Correspondingly, PSOD has \nidentified BIDV as another partner to promote increased financing to SMEs. BIDV, with an SME \nportfolio of $9.1 billion as of December 2017, is the largest lender to the SME segment. The bank \nhas made lending to SMEs a key strategic priority in line with the government\u2019s efforts to boost \nlending  to this  segment.  Having  the  second-widest  network  in the  country,  BIDV  is  in  an \nadvantageous position to increase access to finance for SMEs. It created a specialized SME \ndepartment, expanded the SME product range, and developed a comprehensive digital strategy \nto augment its distribution channels and improve the SME customer experience. With an expected \nSME portfolio growth of 17.5% during FY2018 and FY2019, BIDV\u2019s funding needs for SME \nlending are substantial. ADB\u2019s longer-term financing is particularly impactful in Viet Nam, where \ndebt  markets  are  still  nascent\u2014limiting  the  funding  channels  and  options  for  financial \ninstitutions\u2014and where longer-tenor products are needed to address client demand and to \n                                                \n2  Vietnam  News.  2018.

Business Overview and Strategy \n \n8.  Overview. Founded in 1957 as a government agency to finance infrastructure-related \nprojects during the war, BIDV began providing a full range of banking services at market terms in \n1995. Today, it is the largest bank in Viet Nam with total assets of D1,200,449 billion, a market \ncapitalization  of  D111.8  billion,  859,786  customer  depositors,  more  than  25,000  staff,  190 \nbranches, 854 transaction offices, 1,825 ATMs, and 50,924 points of sale as of FY2017.6 With a \n95.3% government ownership, BIDV is one of four state-owned commercial banks. It has grown \nits gross loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.4% since FY2013 (18.7% \nin 2017, outpacing the overall market\u2019s credit growth of 18% in 2017). BIDV\u2019s deposit base has \ngrown at a CAGR of 23.4% since FY2013, reflecting the strength of its brand name in attracting \ncustomers. In April 2015, BIDV acquired the majority state-owned Mekong Housing Bank (MHB) \nvia a stock swap. MHB was the fifth-largest state-owned bank in Viet Nam, with operations \noriginally focused on housing finance, but gradually shifting to agricultural lending in the Mekong \nDelta. BIDV is rated in line with the sovereign; B (short); B+ (long); stable outlook (September \n2017) by S&P, and Ba3 issuers rating, stable outlook (August 2018) by Moody\u2019s. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n9.  Ownership. BIDV is almost entirely state-owned (95.3% in FY2017) through the SBV, \nwhile the remaining 4.7% is publicly listed on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange. A sizable portion \nof the public float (2.3%) is held by foreign investors as of FY2017. In line with an overall market \nrally, BIDV\u2019s stock price has more than doubled since March 2017, currently trading at a price\u2013\nbook ratio of 2.2 times. No beneficial owner, apart from the SBV, controls more than 2.0% of its \nshares. BIDV is currently in discussions with potential strategic and financial investors to raise \nadditional capital and support the government\u2019s plan to reduce its stake in BIDV to 65% by 2020. \nIntegrity due diligence was conducted.7 No significant or potentially significant integrity risks were \nidentified. Tax integrity due diligence was not required. \n \n10.  Corporate governance. BIDV follows a three-tiered corporate governance structure: the \nshareholder\u2019s general assembly, the board of directors (BOD), and the supervisory board. The \nBOD has eight members, including one independent director and two executive directors (the \nchief  executive  officer  [CEO]  and  the  chief  controller).  All  non-independent  directors  are \nnominated by SBV and are generally former members of senior management of BIDV or MHB. \nThe only independent director, Le Viet Cuong, is from academia and held the position of chief of \noffice in SBV. The BOD meets monthly and has four committees responsible for human resources, \nrisk management, IT, and strategy and organization. A three-member supervisory board acts on \nbehalf  of the shareholders  as  a  bridge  between  shareholders  and the  BOD  to  objectively \nsupervise and assess business operations, corporate governance, and the financial performance \nof BIDV. The three members are elected by the shareholders and also have audit and compliance \nsupervision functions. \n \n11.  Management. The management team has 11 members: the CEO, nine senior executive \nvice presidents, and the chief accountant. All have extensive banking experience, in most cases \n                                                \n6  All BIDV numbers related to the financial statements are under the International Financial Reporting Standards, \nunless stated otherwise. \n7  ADB. 2003.

The CEO, Phan Duc Tu, joined BIDV \nin 1987 as a branch manager and became CEO in 2012. He holds a master\u2019s degree in business \nadministration  and  has  been  the  chairperson  of  the  Vietnam  Bankers  Association.  The \nmanagement team is organized in various committees, e.g., asset and liability management \ncommittee, credit committee, and off-balance sheet debt sale committee. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n12.  ADB will provide a senior unsecured loan to BIDV of up to $200 million in up to two \ntranches in tenors of up to 5 years. ADB expects to syndicate a B loan of up to $100,000,000 \namong commercial banks and other eligible B loan participants on a best-effort basis and subject \nto market conditions. ADB also expects to provide a transaction technical assistance (TA) grant \nof up to $1,000,000.8 The TA is expected to support BIDV\u2019s digital finance strategy, strengthen \nenvironmental and social standards, and enhance its risk management capabilities, as well as \nenable it to start tracking loans to SMEs owned by women and developing targeted marketing \nand product strategies. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  Use of proceeds. BIDV will use the proceeds of ADB\u2019s loan to finance business loans to \nSMEs in Viet Nam. Not less than 25% of ADB\u2019s A loan will be used for SMEs in rural areas. \n \n14.  Monitoring and reporting. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department will monitor the \nproject. BIDV will, at predetermined regular intervals and as requested, provide ADB with financial \nreports\u2014(i) quarterly unaudited financial statements, (ii) annual audited financial statements, (iii) \nquarterly compliance certificates for financial covenants, (iv) semiannual reporting on the SME \nloan portfolios, (v) annual reporting on selected development indicators agreed upon by ADB and \nBIDV, and (vi) an annual environmental and social management system performance report. \n \n15.  Evaluation. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB at least annually. \nThe first report will be submitted no later than 12 months after the first disbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n16.  Supporting the growth of SMEs. ADB\u2019s funding will support the growth of SMEs, which \nare the backbone of the Vietnamese economy and lack access to finance, particularly of longer \ntenors. By partnering with a bank that has a large network and an established and growing SME \nbusiness line, ADB can maximize its development footprint. In addition to providing SMEs with \nfunding to support working capital and investment needs, the proposed transaction will also \ncontribute to broader economic growth and job creation. ADB\u2019s funding will also target SMEs in \nmore underdeveloped areas in the country and ADB has also set a target for the bank to increase \nits lending to SMEs owned by women. \n \n17.  Providing access to longer-tenor debt. To support growth of its SME portfolio and better \nservice its smaller customers with longer-term products, BIDV needs longer-tenor financing to \n                                                \n8  The TA will be processed separately. \n ", "5 \ncomply with regulatory requirements that restrict the ratio of short-term funding to long-term \nfunding. ADB\u2019s 5-year loan will help BIDV increase the average tenor of its SME portfolio and \nclose part of this funding gap. About 90% of BIDV\u2019s funding is still below 1 year, while 25% of its \nSME book has tenors above 1 year. About $2 billion per annum is needed to support its SME \nportfolio growth, which is not readily available given the relatively underdeveloped nature of the \ncountry\u2019s capital markets. ADB\u2019s A and B loans represent 15% of BIDV\u2019s 2018 funding needs for \ngrowing its SME portfolio. \n \n18.  Catalyzing private sector financing. ADB will be providing a B loan of up to $100 million, \nthereby mobilizing private financing for BIDV to help close its large funding gap.  \n \n19.  Establishing market-leading standards and strengthening capacity. ADB will be \nBIDV\u2019s first development finance institution providing long-term lending. As such, ADB will play \nan important role in developing and supporting the bank\u2019s adoption of stronger social and \nenvironmental standards and an improved risk management framework. In addition to ADB\u2019s loan, \nADB is preparing to provide TA of up to $1 million to strengthen BIDV\u2019s risk management and \nenvironmental and social systems by helping it implement a new environmental and social \nmanagement system (ESMS) and support investments in BIDV\u2019s digital strategy, as well as \ndevelop systems to track female borrowers and develop a strategy and products to support this \nimportant market segment. ADB\u2019s loan and TA are expected to give a positive signal to the market \nand help attract future commercial and development bank lenders, as well as equity investors, \nwhich will contribute to the government\u2019s goal of gradually diluting its ownership stake. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcomes, and Outputs \n \n20.  Impacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: Viet Nam\u2019s vision for socially \nequitable economic development, better access to finance for the underserved population, and \ndevelopment of the finance sector, as well as the goals of the new Law on Supporting Small and \nMedium Enterprises, i.e., for SMEs to gain better access to finance and land, integrate in global \nvalue chains, and enjoy equal treatment with foreign and bigger firms. \n \n21.  Outcomes. The project will have the following outcomes: provision of sustainable and \nlonger-term  financial  services  to  SMEs  increased,  and  BIDV  enabled  to  expand  its  SME \nbusinesses.9 \n \n22.  Outputs. The outputs will be (i) BIDV\u2019s increased capacity to serve SMEs with longer-\ntenor financing and (ii) BIDV\u2019s improved processes to manage social and environmental risks. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 emphasizes its support to the financial sector to achieve greater \nfinancial inclusion; gender equality; job creation; and access to affordable housing, insurance, \nand  savings.10 The  proposed  transaction  contributes  to  financial  sector  development  by \nsupporting the growth of a financial institution that plays a key role in Viet Nam\u2019s finance sector. \n                                                \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n10 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and Pacific. \n ", "6 \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 also seeks to promote inclusive growth. Without access to formal financial \nservices, underserved segments of the population will be excluded from the growth process and \nits benefits. According to ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 and country operations \nbusiness plan, 2017\u20132019 for Viet Nam, ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations will support investments \nthat  promote  more  inclusive  economic  growth  based  on  promoting  job  creation  and \ncompetitiveness.11 The proposed transaction will support the development of SMEs in Viet Nam, \nwhich is part of the inclusive economic growth objective of the country partnership strategy and \nalso a high government priority, and will complement ADB\u2019s efforts to strengthen the financial \nsector under the Financial Sector Development and Inclusion Program.12 \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n24.  This transaction is classified as category FI for impacts on the environment and FI treated \nas  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  transaction\u2019s  potential \nenvironmental and social impacts, risks associated with the financial intermediary\u2019s existing \nand/or likely future portfolio, and commitment to and capacity for environmental and social \nmanagement have been assessed. Prior to the disbursement of the ADB financing, the company \nwill design and implement a project-specific ESMS to comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) requirements. BIDV will use the proposed loan to support SME finance, \ntargeting customers involved in a variety of industries, including trading, manufacturing, service, \nretail, agribusiness, wholesale, and distribution. BIDV will not use ADB funding to finance projects \nclassified as category A for environmental impacts or category A or B for involuntary resettlement \nor indigenous peoples. BIDV will apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list, ensure that \nsubloans using ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and regulations, and comply with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. It will also comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to \nADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy (2001),  will  take measures to  comply  with  internationally \nrecognized core labor standards.13 BIDV will report regularly to ADB on its compliance with such \nlaws, and any measures taken. Information will be disclosed and affected peoples consulted in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s requirements. The transaction is classified as having some gender \nelements.  The  ESMS  will  include  procedures  for  BIDV\u2019s  periodic  reporting  to  ADB  on \nimplementation of gender mainstreaming measures in its lending using ADB proceeds. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n25.  BIDV was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.

ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in \nthe event of noncompliance. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2016.
