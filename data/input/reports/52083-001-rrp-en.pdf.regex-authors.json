THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Republic of the Philippines for the Malolos\u2013Clark \nRailway Project. The project will support the construction of two sections, totaling 53.1 kilometers \n(km), of the North\u2013South Commuter Railway (NSCR), connecting the regional center of Clark in \nCentral Luzon with Metro Manila and Calamba, Laguna.1 The Malolos\u2013Clark Railway Project will \nprovide affordable, reliable, and safe public transport; reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and \ncontribute to cutting travel time from Metro Manila to Clark from 2\u20133 hours (by bus) to less than 1 \nhour by rail.2 The project is included in the country operations business plan, 2019\u20132021 of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for the Philippines.3 \n \nII.  RATIONALE \n \n2.  Development problem. The Philippines is among the fastest growing economies in \nSoutheast Asia, with an average annual economic growth rate of 6.2% from 2010 to 2015. The \nPhilippine Development Plan (PDP), 2017\u20132022 looks to maintain this momentum by continuing \nthe government\u2019s emphasis on inclusive growth.4 Under the PDP, the government has set a \nstrategic target to reach upper-middle-income status by 2022 by increasing gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) per capita from $3,550 in 2015 to $5,000 by 2022. However, while the national \npoverty rate fell from 25.2% of the population in 2012 to 21.6% in 2015, this still translated into \n22 million poor people in 2015. Such a level is quite high for a middle-income country. Household \nincome inequality in the Philippines is also among the highest in Southeast Asia. Wide income \ndisparities across the country\u2019s regions indicate that the benefits of economic growth have not \nbeen distributed evenly. \n \n3.  To sustain high growth and ensure it is more inclusive, the Philippines needs to increase \nboth public and private investments in climate-resilient infrastructure. The World Economic \nForum\u2019s  Global  Competitiveness  Report,  2017\u20132018  ranked  the  country\u2019s  infrastructure \ncompetitiveness 97th out of 137 countries surveyed, well behind regional peers Malaysia (22nd), \nThailand (43rd), and Indonesia (52nd).5 This is the result of years of low spending specifically on \npublic infrastructure. At 35% of GDP in 2015, Philippine public capital stock is the lowest among \nmembers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The ASEAN simple average \nis 69% of GDP (Figure 1). Not only is the infrastructure deficit an impediment to accelerating long-\nterm economic growth and reducing poverty, but it also leads to significant economic losses \nbecause of pollution and time delays caused by road congestion. The PDP estimated economic \nlosses due to road congestion in 2014 to be at least $53.6 million per day (equivalent to around \n$18 billion per year) in Metro Manila. Moreover, the lack of safe and efficient public transport \n                                                \n1  The Malolos\u2013Clark Railway Project comprises: (i) Malolos\u2013Clark section (51.2 km) from Malolos to Clark and Clark \nInternational Airport, and (ii) Blumentritt extension (1.9 km) connecting Solis and Blumentritt stations in Metro Manila \nDistrict I (City of Manila). Both sections are part of the North\u2013South Commuter Railway (NSCR) and extensions of \nthe Tutuban\u2013Solis\u2013Malolos section financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The NSCR will \nbe completed during 2022\u20132025 as an integrated 163 km dedicated suburban passenger railway system comprising \nfour sections: (i) Tutuban\u2013Solis\u2013Malolos, (ii) Malolos\u2013Clark\u2013Clark International Airport, (iii) Solis\u2013Blumentritt\u2013\nCalamba, and (iv) Clark\u2013New Clark City (paragraph 7). \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2018.

In recognition of this challenge, in April 2017 the government launched Build, Build, Build \n(BBB), a comprehensive infrastructure development program.6 Embodied in the spatial strategy \nof the PDP, the BBB program aims to attract investments, connect regions and markets, generate \njobs, and spur economic growth through infrastructure development. The BBB program aims to \nraise public spending on infrastructure from 5.1% of GDP in 2016 to 7.0% of GDP by 2022. The \ntotal estimated funding requirement under the BBB program to achieve the targeted infrastructure \noutlays over this period is $158 billion. To meet these requirements, the government plans to \nraise funds from three primary sources: direct government spending through the national budget, \nprivate capital, and official development assistance. BBB projects include railways, expressways, \nbridges, airports, urban public utilities, and flood risk management investments. For FY2018, \nactual public spending on infrastructure was equivalent to 6.2% of GDP in terms of budget \nobligations and 4.6% of GDP in terms of cash disbursements (Figure 1).7 This has been the \nhighest level attained in more than 10 years. \n \n5.  Road map. In the Philippines, substantial underinvestment in infrastructure has led to \nchronic capacity constraints in the transport sector, resulting in economic losses due to road \ncongestion (paragraph 3) and in significant air pollution, as 98% of passenger transport and 55% \nof freight transport are by road.8 It is however estimated that by 2040, 30%\u201340% of passengers \nin the corridor from Clark to the National Capital Region (NCR) will use the new rail line. Today, \ncommuter railways are operated only in Metro Manila and the Laguna Province. Comprising just \nthree elevated rail lines, Metro Manila\u2019s rail-based public urban transport system has a total length \nof 48.5 km; these transported 283 million passengers in 2015.9 In addition, Philippine National \nRailways (PNR) operates a suburban commuter railway from Tutuban southbound to Alabang \n                                                \n6  Build, Build, Build. http://www.build.gov.ph. \n7  Budget obligations refer to construction contract commitments made for projects, while cash disbursements refer to \ncash releases to pay for construction (footnote 5). \n8  The remaining 2% of passenger transport is by air and sea, and the remaining 45% of freight transport is by sea. \n9  JICA. 2018. The Detailed Design Study (Including Supplementary Feasibility Study) of Malolos\u2013Clark Railway \nProject: Feasibility Study Report. Tokyo. \n \n ", "3 \n(28 km), which transported 21 million passengers in 2016.10 Considering the population size and \ndensity of the NCR, the railway network is sparse, and the lack of high-capacity public transport \nis a primary reason for the NCR\u2019s chronic road congestion.11 No northbound railway linking the \nNCR with Central Luzon exists, with buses and jeepneys being the only modes of public transport. \nThe main highways\u2014the North Luzon Expressway and the MacArthur Highway\u2014serve very high \nlevels of demand: up to 120,000 vehicles a day just north of Manila\u2019s circular road 4 (EDSA) in \n2018, and more than 50,000 vehicles a day further north around Malolos. Demand on the corridor \nexceeds 50% of the network\u2019s capacity\u2014a level at which traffic quickly builds up, especially during \npeak hours.  \n \n6.  Air transport infrastructure in the NCR is also unable to satisfy growing demand for air \ntransport because of capacity constraints. Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) and Clark \nInternational Airport (CIA) are the two major airports serving the NCR. NAIA handled about 42 \nmillion passengers in 2017, which substantially exceeded the airport\u2019s 35 million maximum \ncapacity.12 NAIA has become increasingly congested, but its location in the heart of Metro Manila \nlimits the potential for further expansion. The government plans to decongest traffic at NAIA and \nmeet growing demand for air travel by diverting more passengers to CIA, which will have an \nannual capacity of 12 million passengers when the new terminal is completed in 2020.13 To \nachieve this, it is vital to have affordable, fast, and reliable transport links between CIA and Manila. \n \n7.  The project is in line with the PDP and the National Transport Policy, 14 and is part of the \ngovernment\u2019s flagship NSCR project, a 163 km suburban railway network connecting Clark \n(including CIA and New Clark City) with Metro Manila and Calamba, Laguna, by 2025. To be \nconstructed in sections, the network comprises (i) the 37 km Tutuban\u2013Solis\u2013Malolos section, \nconstruction of which will begin in early 2019, with operation expected to begin in 2022; (ii) the \n53.1 km Malolos\u2013Clark Railway Project (footnote 1), construction of which will launch in 2019, \nwith partial operation scheduled to commence in 2022; (iii) the 55 km Blumentritt\u2013Calamba South \nCommuter Railway Project, construction of which is expected to begin in 2020, with operation \nslated for  2024; and (iv) the extension from Clark to New Clark City, construction of which is \nexpected to start in 2022 for operation by 2025. An extension for long-haul services to the port of \nBatangas and to Legaspi in Southern Luzon is planned beyond 2025. \n \n8.  Policy framework. The government is taking a threefold approach to developing transport \ninfrastructure in the NCR and surrounding regions. Its first step was to streamline infrastructure \npolicy to accelerate investment approvals and construction. In June 2017, the government \napproved  the  National  Transport  Policy,  which  guides  transport-related  agencies  on  policy \ndecisions and future investment and coordinates national and local efforts. Embedded in the \nNational Transport Policy is the Philippine Transportation System Master Plan, which will ensure \na holistic, well-coordinated, and evidence-based project selection process. Additionally, the \ngovernment  has  adopted  a  hybrid  policy  for  financing  and  operating  large  and  complex \ninfrastructure investments. Under this policy, the government will finance public infrastructure \nthrough a combination of the national budget and official development assistance, with operation \n                                                \n10 The Philippine National Railways (PNR) commenced limited services to General Pascual Station in the north of Metro \nManila and to Calamba in Laguna Province in 2018. Limited local services are operated in the Bicol Region between \nNaga City and Legaspi City. \n11 The National Capital Region (NCR) comprises the 16 cities known as Metro Manila. \n12 Manila  International  Airport  Authority.  2018.

The second facet of the government\u2019s threefold approach to transport infrastructure \ndevelopment is the national spatial strategy embedded in the PDP, which seeks to integrate \nleading areas with lagging areas and promote urban\u2013rural links through improved transportation. \nThe  strategy  emphasizes  the  development  of  regional  growth  centers  providing  affordable \nhousing, quality education, quality health care, and other social and economic services. The \nregional growth centers will be linked by improved transport infrastructure to support accelerated \neconomic growth. The government is developing Clark and New Clark City as a regional growth \ncenter, with CIA as a regional gateway integrating Central Luzon with the Asian region thereby \nfurther deepening regional cooperation. This will contribute to better integration of the Philippines \nwith  ASEAN  economies  and  attract  more  foreign  direct  investment.  New  Clark  City  will \naccommodate 1.2 million residents and 800,000 jobs by 2045 and will become an administrative \ncenter and education hub for the country. The railway network will be the backbone of the public \ntransport system. Connecting Clark, New Clark City, and CIA with the NCR by rail will also help \nrelieve road congestion and reduce high transport and logistics costs. Developing Clark as a \nregional center and promoting a shift of population growth from the high-density NCR to Central \nLuzon will spur economic growth along the entire North-South corridor.  \n \n10.  The third component of the government\u2019s threefold approach is the 2017\u20132022 Public \nInvestment  Program,  through  which  the  government  has  approved  several  large  transport \ninfrastructure  investments  in  the  NCR  to  reduce  congestion,  environmental  pollution  and \nassociated high transport and logistics costs.16 These investments include (i) rehabilitating Metro \nRail Transit (MRT) line 3; (ii) extending Light Rail Transit (LRT) lines 1 and 2; and (iii) constructing \nMRT line 7 and MRT line 4 (15 km Ortigas\u2013Rizal line); constructing a Quezon City\u2013NAIA subway; \nbuilding elevated pedestrian walkways known as Edsa Greenways; building up to 10 new Metro \nManila bridges across the Marikina and Pasay rivers; and constructing additional connector roads. \nThe government is also improving interchanges between the MRT and LRT lines and improving \nintermodal integration with buses and with other transport modes. South of Metro Manila, the \ngovernment plans to build a 50 km expressway along the shoreline of the Laguna de Bay lake to \nfurther ease traffic congestion. \n \n11.  Strategic context. To sustain high growth, the Philippines needs to significantly increase \ninvestments  in  climate-resilient  infrastructure;  improve  connectivity  between  regions, \ncommunities, and people; and raise infrastructure competitiveness (paragraph 3). Investments in \nurban development are needed to address infrastructure deficits in large cities resulting from rapid \npopulation  growth  and  urbanization.  The  government\u2019s  BBB  program  emphasizes  physical \nconnectivity, urban development, and water resource management to address the infrastructure \ndeficit. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS), 2018\u20132023 for the Philippines consolidates \nlending activities into larger programmatic approaches and increases synergies across ADB \noperations.17 ADB will add value to the financing it provides by helping the government design, \nprepare, bring to the market, and implement priority public investment projects under the BBB \nprogram through large-scale capacity development technical assistance (TA). The project is \n                                                \n15 Selection of the O&M contractor for the NSCR is under preparation.

ADB\u2019s experience in the Philippine\u2019s infrastructure sector. ADB has supported the \ngovernment\u2019s BBB program through a mix of modalities. First, ADB has provided TA to support \nthe government  in  simplifying  infrastructure  policy  and  streamlining approval  procedures.18 \nSecond, through policy-based lending, ADB has supported the government in establishing a \npolicy framework for increased private participation in infrastructure projects and in reforming \ncapital markets to improve the availability of long-term financing for infrastructure.19 Third, ADB \napproved in October 2017 an Infrastructure Preparation and Innovation Facility (IPIF) TA loan of \n$100 million to support the Department of Public Works and Highways and the DOTr to prepare \nquality, large, and complex infrastructure projects under the BBB program and to strengthen the \ncapacity to implement the projects.20 ADB has also provided an IPIF TA grant of $5 million to \ndevelop the capacity of the Department of Public Works and Highways and the DOTr to manage \nlarge projects.21 Fourth, ADB has increased financing for transport infrastructure projects in the \nPhilippines. From 1990 to 2016, ADB financing for transport infrastructure totaled only $860 \nmillion  (nominal  values)\u2014an  average  of  $32  million  per  year.  The  CPS,  2018\u20132023  has \nsubstantially  rebalanced  the  lending  pipeline  toward  infrastructure  projects,  with  transport \naccounting for at least 47% of the scaled-up indicative lending pipeline for 2019\u20132021. In addition \nto sovereign loans, the Private Sector Operations Department provided a nonsovereign loan to \nthe Mactan Cebu International Passenger Terminal Project, which was completed in 2018.22 \nMeanwhile, ADB\u2019s Office of Public\u2013Private Partnerships has signed a mandate with the Philippine \ngovernment-owned Bases Conversion Development Corporation to provide transaction advisory \nservices for urban investments in New Clark City.  \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s value addition. Cofinancing of the project and of additional segments of the NSCR \nby ADB and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) will help ensure that the project \nis delivered within a short time frame and with high technical, social, and environmental standards. \nCapacity development support for the DOTr through the IPIF TA loan and grant will support \ninstitutional strengthening of the DOTr throughout the project. A consulting firm financed by ADB \nthrough the IPIF with specialization in the railway subsector will support the DOTr, especially \nduring project preparation and procurement, while the Railway Project Implementation Support \nand Institutional Strengthening TA project (footnote 2) supports the implementation of safeguard \nmeasures and gender action plan. The institutional development component under the project will \nfurther support the DOTr in managing the large investment by establishing an information \ntechnology system to handle the document flow for improved project management, scheduling, \nand coordination between the parties involved. \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2014.

Lessons learned. ADB\u2019s experience with financing large railway projects provides several \ncritical lessons that have been incorporated into the project. First, large railway projects financed \nby ADB in South Asia and Southeast Asia have shown that the following are vital to delivering \nhigh-quality projects in a timely manner: (i) conducting advance planning and detailed project \npreparation; (ii) making sure that executing agencies have strong capacity for project preparation, \nprocurement, land acquisition and resettlement, and project implementation; (iii) integrating the \ndesign with other transport modes for strong intermodal integration; and (iv) considering O&M \nrequirements at an early stage. A consulting team financed by JICA incorporated these lessons \nin preparing the design for the NSCR (including the Malolos\u2013Clark section covered by this project). \nThe addition of the Blumentritt extension will address the need for integrating the new system with \nthe existing MRT lines in Metro Manila. The JICA-financed design consulting team will continue \nits services until the general consultant and construction supervision consultants, which will also \nbe financed by JICA, are mobilized. To further strengthen the DOTr\u2019s capacity during project \npreparation and project implementation, consultants engaged through the IPIF are supporting the \nDOTr with railway-specific knowledge and will act as the \u201cshadow operator\u201d until the operation \ncontractor is selected.23 \n \n15.  The second lesson is that past greenfield railway projects implemented under public\u2013\nprivate partnerships have failed because of a lack of sufficient revenues in the initial years of \noperation, or because of delays in project implementation. The DOTr will therefore cover the entire \ncost of O&M for the NSCR, using government resources, until traffic has picked up to a level that \nwill allow the operation contractor to recover the full O&M costs, including replacement of \nequipment, from revenues.24 The third lesson is that resettlement plans for large railway projects \nmust (i) focus on large numbers of poor project-affected households and (ii) ensure adequate \nliving standards and conditions at resettlement sites and provide an effective grievance redress \nmechanism.  Railway-related  resettlement  can  impact  large  numbers  of  informal  settler \nhouseholds  residing  on  government  land  near  railway  tracks,  resulting  in  a  much  larger \npercentage of project-affected households living in poverty than for other infrastructure projects. \nThe project\u2019s resettlement action plans (RAPs) will address poverty among displaced people \nthrough a robust livelihood restoration and improvement program that will provide additional \nsupport to vulnerable households and assist low-income informal settlers in gaining tenure of a \nhome.25 The site validation process will include criteria on accessibility to schools, health facilities, \nand transport; and the DOTr will be required to ensure that all utilities are in place and functioning \nat resettlement sites before families are relocated. \n \n16.  Alignment with Strategy 2030. The project is aligned with pillar 1 of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \non accelerating infrastructure and long-term investments of the CPS (footnote 17), which aims to \ndevelop  climate-resilient  infrastructure  to  meet  expanding  demand;  better  connect  regions, \ncommunities, and people; and raise competitiveness.26 The project supports the implementation \nof Strategy 2030 as summarized in Table 1.27 \n \n                                                \n23 The consultant firm engaged under this Technical Assistance Loan is the \u201cshadow operator\u201d for the project and acts \nas the operator of the railway during the design and construction phase of the project, until the operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) contractor has been selected and mobilized. \n24 Once O&M cost including replacement of equipment are fully covered by revenues, the DOTr intends to replace the \nO&M contract with a concession agreement. \n25 TA for Poverty Reduction in Communities Affected by the Malolos\u2013Clark Railway Project, which will be financed by \nan ADB-administered trust fund and will further support the livelihood restoration program for poor displaced persons, \nis under preparation. \n26 ADB. 2018.

THE INVESTMENT PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  local,  national,  and  international \nconnectivity improved (footnote 4). The investment project will have the following outcome: \nefficiency and capacity of transportation along the Manila\u2013Clark corridor improved.28 \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n18.  Output 1: New railway line commissioned. The project will help finance the construction \nof an elevated double-track railway lines totaling 53.1 km, including the 51.2 km Malolos\u2013Clark\u2013\nCIA  section  (Malolos\u2013Clark  section),  and  the  1.9  km  Solis\u2013Blumentritt  section  (Blumentritt \nextension) linking the project to the existing rail-based public urban transport system in Manila. \nThe project also includes (i) construction of a depot near CIA for the maintenance of rolling stock \nand fixed assets, with a training center for railway staff and an operation control center; and (ii) \nseven stations integrating design features that are friendly to and safe for elderly people, women, \nchildren, and people living with disabilities. \n \n19.  Output 2: Institutional capacity strengthened. Implementing the project and preparing \nfuture O&M arrangements require a high level of capacity in managing projects, contracts, and \n                                                \n28 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "8 \ndocument flow.

Consulting services. Project design, implementation, and capacity development for the \nentire  NSCR  network  will  be  supported  by  the  following  consulting  services:  (i)  detailed \nengineering design consultants financed by JICA; (ii) JICA-financed general consultant and \nconstruction supervision consultant who will coordinate all project activities and construction \nsupervision for contracts financed by ADB and JICA; (iii) advisory services to the DOTr provided \nby the consulting firm recruited under the IPIF (footnote 20), which will also support procurement \nand serve as the shadow operator (footnote 23) until the O&M contract is awarded; and (iv) project \npreparation and implementation support consultants financed by ADB TA (footnotes 2 and 21). \n \n21.  Use of multitranche financing facility. These outputs are best financed by an MFF to \nachieve the outcome in an efficient and effective manner.29 The Malolos\u2013Clark Railway Project \nwill be financed by an MFF with three tranches adopting the time-slicing approach for large-scale \nstand-alone projects. At the time of MFF processing, the design, procurement, and safeguards \nhave been appraised for the entire MFF. Each tranche will finance slices of a group of contracts \nper the indicative tranche schedule, and the amount for each tranche will be requested per the \ndisbursement progress and projection. The tranche schedule is based on the disbursement \nprojection. The MFF modality enables ADB to support implementation of the road map under the \npolicy  framework  through  a  long-term  partnership  with  the  government  and  to  combine \ninfrastructure investments with policy dialogue and sector reforms. \n \n22.  Scope of project 1. Tranche 1 will finance the first slice of the contract packages under \nthe project. \n \nC.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n23.

The  project  will  be  cofinanced  by  JICA  on  a  parallel \ncollaborative basis, but the cofinancing will not be administered by ADB.31 The JICA loan was \napproved in December 2018 and signed on 21 January 2019. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n28.  The DOTr will be the executing agency for the project. A project management office (PMO) \nwill be established under the office of the undersecretary for railways. A full-time project manager \nwill head the PMO and will be directly responsible for day-to-day implementation of the project. \n                                                \n30 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 ADB is financing civil works (i.e., viaducts, bridges, stations, tunnels, and depot buildings) while JICA is financing the \ncore system (i.e., tracks, depot equipment, power supply and electrification, signaling and telecommunication \nsystems, and procurement of rolling stock) and consulting services. The audited project financial statements for the \nproject will cover expenditures financed by ADB and/or the DOTr only, and will not include JICA cofinancing. \n ", "10 \nConsultants financed  by  ADB  under  the  IPIF will  advise  the  PMO  on  project  preparation, \nprocurement, and project management. The project will be implemented under the government\u2019s \nhybrid policy for infrastructure investments (paragraph 8); specific O&M arrangements will be \nestablished during project implementation. Under this framework, a private service contractor will \noperate and maintain the Malolos\u2013Clark Railway, together with other sections of the NSCR. The \nDOTr will be assisted by consultants engaged under IPIF, who will also serve as the shadow \noperator (footnote 23), until the O&M contract is signed in 2020. The DOTr will cover O&M \nexpenditures, especially in the initial years of operation before all sections have been completed \nand revenue is insufficient to cover the full cost of O&M.

ADB will support to ensure timeliness and quality of the \nprocurement process in accordance with ADB\u2019s procurement requirements. \n \n30.  Project readiness. Project readiness is high, as the entire scope to be financed by the \nMFF has been appraised by ADB, the detailed engineering design has been completed, and \nbidding for the first three contracts financed under the MFF started in January 2019. The \ncontractor will be mobilized by October 2019. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n31.  Consultants recruited under the IPIF have confirmed the project\u2019s technical viability. The \nrailway line is fully grade-separated; this will minimize the impact on communities along the line, \nreduce the risk of flooding and improve the safety of operations. Adaptation measures related to \n ", "11 \nthe location and elevation of the depot, slope protection at river crossings, cross-drainage, and \nconstruction of the line mainly on the viaduct have been incorporated in the project design to \nreduce climate change risks. The design criteria are based on international best practices and \nproven technologies for suburban commuter railways and have been standardized for the NSCR \nto ensure interoperability and simplify O&M. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n32.  Economic and financial analyses concluded that the project is economically viable and \nfinancially sustainable.32 The project will provide faster rail connectivity for commuters along the \nManila\u2013Clark  corridor,  where  road  transport  has  traditionally  been  the  primary  mode  of \ntransportation. Demand forecasts were prepared using DOTr\u2019s multi-modal transport model for \nthe greater NCR. It is estimated that by 2040, 30%\u201340% of passengers in the corridor will shift to \nthe new rail line. The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return is 12.3%, and the net present value \nis $1.9 billion using a 9% discount rate. The economic analysis compared the benefits and costs \nof with-project and without-project scenarios. The main project benefits relate to (i) savings in \ntravel time for rail passengers: direct express rail services will connect Manila with CIA within 1 \nhour, while travel by bus from Manila to Clark takes 2\u20133 hours depending on the time of the day; \n(ii) savings associated with reduced congestion on parallel roads (traffic on these roads is \nprojected to decline by about 10%); and (iii) reduced carbon dioxide emissions associated with \nroad travel. A sensitivity analysis tested the effects of possible negative changes in the key \nparameters that determine the project\u2019s costs and benefits. The analysis indicates that the \nproject\u2019s economic viability would remain satisfactory even under adverse scenarios. \n \n33.  A financial assessment was undertaken to examine the viability of the project investment. \nThe project\u2019s lending decision is based on economic viability rather than financial viability. The \nincremental revenues generated by the project during its first 40 years of operations will be \nsufficient to finance the project\u2019s recurrent costs, including replacement of rolling stock. In the \ninitial years of operation, particularly before the southern section is completed, revenues will be \ninsufficient to cover all O&M costs. The government has committed to fully finance project O&M. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n34.  Financial management. The financial management assessment was prepared following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and Financial Due \nDiligence: A Methodology Note, and related technical guidance notes.33 The assessment found \nthat the DOTr has sound financial and accounting systems; adheres to the procedures, manuals, \npolicies, guidelines, and reporting framework prescribed by the Commission of Audit; follows \naccrual-based accounting in an enterprise resource planning system based on Philippine Public \nSector Accounting Standards; and has a robust internal control system with a separate internal \naudit division. The overall financial management assessment risk is substantial, with appropriate \nrisk mitigation measures in place. Details of risks and key mitigating measures are in the FAM. \n \n35.  Procurement  and  anticorruption  measures.  ADB  will  review  procurement-related \ndocuments at all major milestones before proceeding with bidding and contract awards. Six large \nworks packages will be procured to complete the project and will be financed by ADB under \ntranche 1 and subsequent tranches. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \n                                                \n32 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 ADB. 2005.

Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n36.  The project will contribute to economic growth and employment by facilitating mobility and \nimproving accessibility to centers of job opportunities. By 2022, it is estimated that 81,000 \npassengers per day will travel along the Blumentritt\u2013Malolos\u2013Clark\u2013CIA section of the NSCR. \nConstruction activities under the project will create temporary employment for more than 23,900 \nworkers, and the operation of the project railways will provide employment to more than 1,400 \npeople. The train services will help poor and low-income families, including women, access \nincome-generating opportunities, health services, and educational facilities. This will reduce \npoverty and alleviate disparity among urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. The project benefits of \nreduced travel time, increased social mobility, and safety\u2014factors that facilitate getting out of \nincome poverty\u2014will benefit women in particular by better access to jobs and education. Informal \nsettlers along the PNR right-of-way will also benefit from secured tenure options through social \nhousing programs included in the resettlement activities, as well as livelihood restoration and \nimprovement programs included in the RAPs. \n \n37.  Gender action plan. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The gender \naction plan includes the following key measures: (i) integrating gender-responsive and inclusive \ndesign features in the new rail stations; (ii) implementing interventions to prevent and address \nsexual harassment in public transport and during executing civil works; (iii) strengthening capacity \nfor gender mainstreaming within the DOTr and partner agencies; and (iv) strongly encourage the \nO&M contractor to promote gender equality and to employ 40% women in the O&M workforce.34 \nFor women directly affected by the project, the gender action plan will also ensure that livelihood \nskills programs are gender-responsive in line with the gender mainstreaming mandate of partner \ngovernment agencies, such as the technical education and skills development authorities and the \npublic employment service offices of the local government units. \n \n38.  HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. HIV infection and human trafficking are risks in the \nproject areas. The influx of workers in the project area during construction could create additional \nHIV transmission risks. The project will mitigate these risks by providing HIV awareness and \nprevention programs to construction workers. as set out in the environmental management plan \n(EMP) that will form part of the contractor\u2019s obligations. Livelihood disruptions resulting from land \nacquisition and relocation will create additional human trafficking risks, that will be addressed by \na detailed livelihood restoration and improvement program set out in the RAPs. \n \n39.  Communication strategy. A communication and participation strategy for the project is \nunder preparation with support by ADB TA (footnote 2). Incorporating stakeholder analysis \nfindings, the strategy will identify effective communication channels, best approaches to foster \nparticipation  and  partnerships,  key  messages,  and  means  of  integrating  activities  with  the \ngrievance redressal mechanism. The strategy will set forth implementation time lines, roles and \nresponsibilities, budget, monitoring and evaluation requirements for project communication. Key \ncomponents of the strategy will include proactively disclosing project information and activities to \nlocal communities and stakeholders; soliciting stakeholders\u2019 input and feedback on beneficial \nmitigation measures; encouraging community participation in project activities that affect or could \nbenefit  stakeholders,  such  as  civil  works  construction;  and  conducting  awareness-raising \nactivities related to HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, and safety measures. The PMO will have overall \n                                                \n34 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "13 \nresponsibility for the implementation of the strategy, supported by the construction supervision \nconsultant. Required resources will principally take the form of human resource input from local \ngovernment units, local community-based organizations, and contractors involved in the project. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n40.  The project comprises the (i) Malolos\u2013Clark section (51.2 km) and (ii) the Blumentritt \nextension; (1.9 km). The project is cofinanced by JICA, and the facilities financed by JICA are \nincluded in the assessment of safeguard impacts.35 Implementation of the project will follow ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). The Malolos\u2013Clark section and the Blumentritt extension are \nextensions of the Tutuban\u2013Solis\u2013Malolos project, which was conceptualized earlier and is being \nimplemented by the government with financial support from JICA. The Tutuban\u2013Solis\u2013Malolos \nproject will be implemented following safeguard procedures agreed between the government and \nJICA. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard categories of \nthe project are as follows.36 \n \n41.  Environment (category A). The project was assessed category A for the environment. \nEnvironmental impact assessments (EIAs) have been prepared for the Malolos\u2013Clark section and \nfor the Blumentritt extension in compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement.37 Key project \nenvironmental issues identified and addressed are dust emissions during construction, noise and \nvibration during construction and operation, waste generation, traffic congestion and impediments \nto public access, and occupational and community health and safety. Public consultations were \nundertaken during EIA preparation. The DOTr will ensure that (i) the EMP in the EIAs will be \nincorporated in bid documents for all packages regardless of financing source; (ii) consultations \nwith people affected by construction activities are carried out throughout construction; and (iii) the \ngrievance redress mechanism will be adequately resourced, and publicized before commencing \ncivil works. The DOTr will allocate resources for proper EMP implementation and will designate \nstaff to supervise and monitor EMP implementation, supported by the construction supervision \nconsultant. The DOTr will engage an external environmental monitor and will submit semiannual \ninternal  and  external  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  for  review  and  public  disclosure.  The \nenvironmental assessment and review framework for the MFF following the Safeguard Policy \nStatement will guide the preparation of environmental assessment documents, if required, for \nsubsequent tranches. The environmental assessment and review framework and the draft EIAs \nwere disclosed on ADB\u2019s website, the draft EIAs were published on 3 December 2018.38 \n \n42.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  A).  The  project  was  assessed  category  A  for \ninvoluntary resettlement. The project will require acquisition of 49 hectares (ha) of land: 46 ha for \nthe Malolos\u2013Clark section and 3 ha for the Blumentritt extension. Resettlement impacts have \nbeen minimized by using PNR-owned land and government-owned land wherever possible. Out \nof the estimated 1,889 project affected households, equivalent to a total number of 7,581 project \naffected persons, the majority are expected to be severely affected and required to relocate and \nmost of them are informal settlers. A resettlement and indigenous peoples planning framework \n(RIPPF) has been prepared for the MFF following the Safeguard Policy Statement to guide the \npreparation of the RAPs. The RAPs have been prepared for the Malolos\u2013Clark section and the \nBlumentritt extension based on resettlement surveys, social assessments, and consultations. The \n                                                \n35 ADB and JICA will closely coordinate the implementation of the projects, including any safeguard matters. \n36 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n37 The EIA for the Blumentritt extension is part of the EIA for the Solis\u2013Calamba section, which will be financed as part \nof ADB\u2019s South Commuter Railway Project, planned for board consideration in 2020. \n38 Environmental Impact Assessments and Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "14 \nRAPs will be updated based on the detailed engineering design. The RAPs mitigate involuntary \nresettlement impacts by providing compensation at replacement cost along with assistance for \nrelocation and livelihood restoration. Measures have been incorporated to improve the living \nstandards of vulnerable affected people. As the DOTr has limited experience in implementing \nRAPs for foreign-assisted projects, capacity building will be supported by ADB TA (footnote 2). \nThe DOTr has set up a right-of-way PMO and a technical working committee. A comprehensive \ngrievance redress mechanism has been established, and ADB staff and consultants have initiated \ntraining sessions on rolling out the mechanism. RAP implementation will be financed by the \ngovernment. The RIPPF and RAPs have been disclosed on ADB\u2019s website.39 \n \n43.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  B).  The  whole  project  is  assessed  category  B  for \nindigenous peoples because of the project\u2019s proximity to indigenous ancestral domain land in \nPampanga province. However, due diligence confirmed that the project does not encroach on \nindigenous peoples\u2019 land and a certificate of non-overlap with ancestral domain land has been \nissued  by  the  Philippines\u2019  National  Commission  on  Indigenous  Peoples.  Furthermore,  due \ndiligence for the project indicated that impacts on indigenous peoples are not anticipated, and an \nindigenous peoples plan was not prepared. The RIPPF for the MFF follows the Safeguard Policy \nStatement to guide the preparation of indigenous peoples plans, should impacts on indigenous \npeoples be identified when subsequent tranches are processed. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n44.
