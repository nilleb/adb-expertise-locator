The Torugart post is a major border \ncontrol  and  customs  facility  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the \nPRC.  The  road  condition  is  poor;  border-crossing  facilities  and \nprocedures  are  outdated  and \nthey  obstruct \ninefficient,  and \nImproved  road  and  customs \ntrade. \ninternational \ninfrastructure will  remove the obstruction and open up this corridor \nfor  wider  regional  trade  and  economic  cooperation.  It  will  reduce \ntravel and transit times from the current 3\u20134 days to 2 days.  \n \nImprovement  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  will  be  implemented  in \nthree  phases  and  includes  (i)  improving  488  km  of  the  Bishkek\u2013\nTorugart road in the Kyrgyz Republic and the 20 km Bishkek bypass \nroad,  (ii)  modernizing  infrastructure  and  facilities  at  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2013PRC  border  crossing  at  Torugart,  and  (iii)  policy  and \ninstitutional  support  in  the  road  subsector.  This  proposal  is  for \nProject 1 (the Project), the outputs of which are (i) an improved 39-\nkm  road  section  from  Km  400  to  Km  439  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart \nroad, (ii) modernized customs infrastructure at the Kyrgyz Republic\u2013\nPRC border crossing at Torugart, (iii) a transport sector master plan \nfor  2010\u20132025,  and  (iv)  a  fully  operational  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  Road \nCorridor Management Department (BTRMCD). \n \nRegional  cooperation  in  Central  Asia  has  centered  on  transport, \nenergy, and trade facilitation for the last decade since the launch of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB)-sponsored CAREC Program in \n1997.  This  proposal  supports  transport  and  trade  facilitation  under \nthe  CAREC  Transport  and  Trade \nCAREC.  Endorsed  under \n\ntraffic  and \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\nFacilitation  Strategy,  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  forms  part  of  the \nCAREC Transport Corridor 1. It is the shortest road link from Kashi, \na vibrant cultural and trade center in the PRC, to consumer markets \nin \nthe  northern  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Kazakhstan,  and  Russian \nFederation. As part of the Silk Road that linked ancient China to the \nWestern world, it also represents an important historical heritage. \n \nDevelopment of the transport sector is a priority of the Government \nof the Kyrgyz Republic (the Government), as reflected in its Country \nDevelopment  Strategy  for  2007\u20132010.  Substantial  investments  of \nabout $350 million were made in the last decade to rehabilitate the \ncountry\u2019s  major  road  corridors.  Along  with  these  investments,  the \nKyrgyz  Republic  has  also  made  progress  in  reforming  transport \nsector operations. It adopted the Road Sector Development Strategy \nfor 2007\u20132010, increased road financing, and plans to outsource and \nprivatize road maintenance operations. Improvement of the Bishkek\u2013\nTorugart  road  is  a  priority  investment  project  included  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s strategy. \n \nADB  is  the  lead  partner  in  developing  the  transport  sector  in  the \nKyrgyz  Republic.  The  Project  is  included  in  the  Joint  Country \nSupport  Strategy  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  (2007\u20132010).  It  will \ncomplement  ADB-led  investment  and  policy  dialogue  in  the \ncountry and complete a key transport corridor connecting Bishkek, \nthe capital of the Kyrgyz Republic, to Kashi in the PRC. \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  reducing  transport  costs  and \nfostering regional trade and tourism between the Kyrgyz Republic \nand the PRC. The outcome is improved access to markets, social \nservices, and tourist destinations. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $30.3  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $4.0 million.  \n \n\nItem \n\nRoad Improvement \nCustoms Infrastructure Modernization \nProject Management Support \nPolicy and Institutional Support \nDuties and Taxes \nContingencies \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n16.5 \n1.5 \n2.3 \n1.0 \n4.0 \n5.0 \n  30.3 \n\n\fFinancing Plan  \n\n \n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization  \n \nEstimated Completion \nDate \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\niii\n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n\n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n20.0 \n10.3 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n% \n66.0 \n34.0 \n\nTotal \n\n  30.3 \n\n 100.0 \n\n      Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  grant  not  exceeding  $20.0  million  from  its \nSpecial  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The \nproposed grant will finance 66% of the cost. The Government will \nprovide  counterpart  financing  of  $10.3  million  to  cover  taxes  and \nduties,  part  of  the  civil  works  for  road  improvement,  and  the  civil \nworks for customs infrastructure modernization works. \n \nUntil 30 September 2012 \n \n31 March 2012 \n\nin  2007  under \n\n \nMinistry of Transport and Communications \n \nProject  implementation  units  for  various  donor-assisted  projects \nunder  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC) \nInvestment  Projects \nwere  centralized \nthe \nImplementation  Department,  which  will \nthe  road \nimplement \nimprovement component. The existing project implementation unit \nunder  the  State  Customs  Committee  will  implement  the  customs \nmodernization  component.  Through  the  project  implementation \nunit,  the  State  Customs  Committee  will  report  to  MOTC  on  the \nimplementation  status  and  activities,  and  obtain  MOTC\u2019s \nclearance for payments to contractors and suppliers. \n \nAll procurement to be financed with the ADB grant will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Contracts estimated to cost in excess \nof  $500,000  equivalent  for  goods  and  $1.0  million  for  civil  works \nwill  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Civil \nworks for the road improvement component have been packaged \ninto  one  contract  to  be  financed  by  ADB  following  ADB\u2019s \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Civil  works  for  the \ncustoms  infrastructure  improvement  (estimated  to  cost  less  than \n$1.0  million)  will  be  financed  by  the  Government  following  its \nprocurement  procedures.  Customs  operations  and  control \nequipment  (estimated  at  $1.0  million)  will  be  procured  through \nADB\u2019s \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  The \nGovernment has been advised that before the commencement of \nany procurement activity under national competitive bidding, ADB \nand  the  Government  will  review  the  national  public  procurement \nlaw  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines. \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nfollowing \n\nto  select \n\nfirm  will  be  engaged \n\nAny necessary modifications and clarifications will be reflected in \nthe procurement plan. A tentative procurement plan was prepared \ncovering the first 18 months of the Project.  \n \nthe  services  of \nthe  Project  will  require \nImplementation  of \nconsulting  firms  for  construction  supervision,  project  monitoring \nand  evaluation,  and  preparation  of  subsequent  phases.  The \nProject  will  require  input  of  a  team  of  international  (46  person-\nmonths)  and  national  (137  person-months)  consultants,  who  will \nsupervise  the  civil  works  and  provide  on-the-job  training  for \ncounterpart staff. A simplified technical proposal with quality- and \ncost-based  selection  method  will  be  used \nthe \nconsultants. In addition, the following advisory consulting services \nwill  be  required:  (i)  23  person-months  of  international  and  35 \nperson-months of national consulting services for preparation of a \ntransport  sector  master  plan,  and  (ii)  30  person-months  of \ninternational and 50 person-months of national consulting services \nfor  institutional  support  to  BTRCMD.  Quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  with  a  simplified  technical  proposal  will  be  used  for \nselection of advisory consultants. The services of an independent \naudit  firm  will  be  required  for  financial  audit  of  project  accounts. \nThe \nleast-cost  selection \nprocedures.  All  consulting  services  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will \nfollow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). \n \nBy \nthe  Project  will \nsubstantially  reduce  the  existing  obstruction  to  trade  and  foster \nregional  economic  cooperation.  The  entire  region  will  benefit  from \nthe  Project,  while  the  project  area  will  gain  through  economic \ndevelopment and increased access to markets and social services. \nImproving  the  project  road  will  reduce  transport  costs,  contribute  to \ncommercial  and  industrial  development,  develop  tourism,  and \ngenerate  employment  opportunities.  The  overall  economic  internal \nrate  of  return  of  the  Project  is  14.7%,  and  the  net  present  value  is \nabout  $37.8  million.  The  Project  is  expected  to  help  boost  trade \nbetween  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  PRC.  The  total  volume  of \nbilateral trade is expected to grow from 0.5 million tons in 2007 to 3 \nmillion  tons  in  2015,  of  which  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2013PRC  border  at \nTorugart is expected to contribute more than half. \n \nThe Project is not a targeted poverty intervention. Nevertheless, by \nstimulating  economic  development,  it  will  have  poverty  reduction \nimpact  and  benefits.  While  the  Project  aims  to  facilitate  regional \ntrade  and  thereby  benefit  major  businesses  and  those  involved  in \ntrade  and  commerce, \nit  will  also  significantly  benefit  rural \ncommunities  and  especially  rural  poor.  Specifically,  the  Project  will \nindirectly benefit 2.3 million people living along the project road, 51% \nof  whom  are  women  dominant  in  intra-  and  inter-oblast  (province) \ntrade and commercial activities in the Kyrgyz Republic. Two of the \nthree  oblasts  where  the  project  road  passes  have  poverty  levels \n\nthe  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road, \n\nimproving \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nv\n\nbelow  the  national  average  of  46%.  Extreme  poverty  in  these  two \noblasts is almost double the national average of 13.5%. \n \nKey  assumptions,  on  which  the  Project  design  is  based,  are  (i) \ncontinued political stability and strong economic performance in the \nKyrgyz Republic; (ii) continued commitments of the governments of \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  PRC  to  regional  cooperation  and  to \ncompleting improvement of  the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road corridor; (iii) \ncontinued  external  assistance  to  the  road  subsector  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic;  and  (iv)  implementation  of  the  cross-border  agreement \nbetween the Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Tajikistan. The main project \nrisks include (i) projected international traffic may not materialize, and \n(ii)  cost  overruns  due  to  sharp  escalation  of  prices  for  construction \nmaterials  and  labor.  Given  current  economic  development  in  the \nregion  and  trends  in  trade  and  transport  turnover  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  it  is  anticipated  that  projected  traffic  levels  will  indeed \nmaterialize.  It  is  expected  that  the  economies  of  the  regional \ncountries will grow at least at the same pace as currently, and growth \nis likely to accelerate further. Price escalation factors were adjusted \nfor current trend in world prices for major construction inputs and \nincorporated into the cost estimates to minimize the risk of project \ncost  overrun.  Based  on  these  assumptions  and  the  likelihood  of \nrisks, the Project\u2019s benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh its \ncosts. \n\n \n\n\fo\n69  00'E\n\nKYRGYZ REPUBLIC\nCAREC TRANSPORT CORRIDOR 1\n(BISHKEK--TORUGART  ROAD) PROJECT\n\nDzhambyl\n\nMaimak\n\nTalas\n\nTALAS\n\nShu\n\nKara\nBalta\n\nAlmaty\n\nt\no\n \n\nA\n\ns\nt\na\n\nn\n\na\n\nKaskelen\n\no\n79  00'E\n\nKAZAKHSTAN\n\nBISHKEK Tokmok\n\nShopokov\n\nCHUI\n\nCholpon-Ata\n\nBalykchy\n\n- K u l\n\nk\n\ny\n\ns\n\ns\n\nI\n\ne  \n\nL a k\n\nKochkorka\n\nTyup\n\nKara Kol\n\nDzhergalan\n\nISSYK-KUL\n\nShymkent\n\nKAZAKHSTAN\n\no\n40  00'N\n\nToktogul Reservoir\nKarakul\n\nTerek Sai\n\nToktogul\n\nChaek\n\nLake Song-Kul\n\nKYRGYZ  REPUBLIC\n\nNARYN\n\nNaryn\n\nJALAL-ABAD\n\nTash Kumyr\n\nShamaldy Sai\nKochkor Ata\n\nTashkent\n\nSAMARKAND\n\nAngren\n\nAlmalyk\n\nNamangan\n\nNAMANGAH\n\nANDIZHAN\n\nAndijan\n\nKara Su\n\nJALAL-ABAD\n\nUzgen\n\nOsh\n\nAt Bashy\n\nLake Chatyr-Kul\n\nTorugart\n\nDJIZAK\n\nGulistan\n\nTakeli\n\nUZBEKISTAN\n\nSYRDARYA\n\nBekabad\n\nDjizzak\n\nSpitamen\n\nKhujand\n\nMargheelan\n\nFERGANA\n\nFergana\n\nKokand\nKanibadam\n\nIsfara\nShurab\n\nBatken\n\nFrunze\n\nGulcha\n\nKyzyl Kiya\n\nNaiman\n\nOSH\n\nSopu Kurgon\n\nIstaravshan\n\nSulyukta\n\nVorukh\n\nBATKEN\n\nIrkeshtam\n\nHaidarkan\n\nJordan\n\nSary Tash\n\nPendzhikent\n\nAyni\n\nSUGHD  REGION\n\nDaroot-Korgon\n\nNimich\n\nGarm\n\nDzhirgatal\n\nTAJIKISTAN\n\nNavobod\n\nKaraart\n\nLake Karakul\n\nSAMARKAND\n\nSamarkand\n\nKASHKADARYA\n\nOklya\n\nREGIONS OF\nREPUBLICAN\nSUBORDINATION\n\nTavildara\n\nNurobod\n\nDUSHANBE\n\nVahdat\n\nObigarm\n\nDarvoz\n\nTursunzoda Nurek\n\nFaisabod\n\nNilvan\n\nSURKHANDARYA\n\nDenau\n\nDangara\n\nSarband\n\nKurgan-Tyube\n\nKHATLON\nREGION\n\nHamadoni\n\nDzhilikul\n\nPyandzh\n\nDarqad\n\nKulyab\n\nKhwahan\n\nBADAKHSHAN\n\nShighnan\n\nKhorog\n\nTermez\n\no\n37  00'N\n\nShortepa\n\nHairatan\n\nBALKH\n\nBalkh\n\nNizhniy Pyandzh\n\nShakhrituz\n\nKaldar\n\nAyvadzh\n\nShirkhan\nBandar\n\nKUNDUZ\nKonduz\n\nC\nA\nR\ns\n \n0\n8\n-\n1\n4\n4\n7\n \nH\nR\n\n \n\nMazar-e-Sharif\n\nSholgara\n\nSamangan\n\nSAMANGAN\n\nDara-i-Suf\n\nBaghlan\n\nNahrin\nBAGHLAN\n\nul\nb\no\na\n69  00'E\nto K\n\nRustaq\n\nTAKHAR\n\nFaizabad\n\nKeshem\n\nTaloqan\n\nAFGHANISTAN\n\nKuran Wa Munjan\n\nIshkashim\n\nEshkashem\n\nNURESTAN\n\nBaharak\n\nWakhan\n\nLake Sarez\n\nGORNO-BADAKHSHAN\nAUTONOMOUS  REGION\n\nMurgab\n\no\n40  00'N\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA\n\nt o   U r u m q i\n\nKashi\n\nAtush\n\nN\n\n50\n\n0\n\n100\n\nKilometers\n\nNational Capital\n\nRegional Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nCAREC Transport Corridor 1\n\nCAREC Transport Corridor 3\n\nBishkek--Torugart Road - Project 1\n\nBishkek--Torugart Road - Project 2\n\nBishkek--Torugart Road - Project 3\n\nProjects Financed by Other Donors\n\nProject Financed by ADB and Cofinanciers\n\nMain Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\no\n37  00'N\n\nRegional Boundary\n\nAutonomous Regional Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\no\n79  00'E\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \n\n1. \nto the Kyrgyz Republic for the CAREC Transport Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nRegional  cooperation  in  Central  Asia  has  centered  on  transport,  energy,  and  trade \nfacilitation  for  the  last  decade  since  the  launch  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-\nsponsored  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Program  in  1997.  This \nproposal supports transport and trade facilitation through improvement of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart \nroad  and  a  major  border  control  and  customs  facility  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  The  500  kilometer  (km)  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  is  part  of \nCAREC Transport Corridor 1, which is identified in the CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation \nStrategy.1 It is the shortest road link from Kashi, a vibrant cultural and trade center in the PRC, \nto consumer markets in the northern Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, and Russian Federation. As \npart  of  the  Silk  Road  that  linked  ancient  China  to  the  Western  world,  it  also  represents  an \nimportant historical heritage. \n \n3. \nThe road condition is poor and border-crossing facilities and procedures are outdated and \ninefficient,  thus  obstructing  international  traffic  and  trade.  Improvement  of  the  project  road  and \ncustoms infrastructure at Torugart will remove the obstruction and open up this corridor for wider \nregional trade and economic cooperation. It will reduce travel and transit times from the current 3\u20134 \ndays  to  2  days.  Feasibility  and  social  studies  were  undertaken  under  ADB  technical  assistance \n(TA) projects. 2 The design and monitoring framework of the Project is in Appendix 1.   \n  \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nRegional Trade and the People's Republic of China as Trading Partner \n\n4. \nFueled by robust economic growth in Central Asia and the PRC, Central Asian countries \nhave experienced increasing trade among themselves, and predominantly with the PRC. Trade \nvolumes  in  Central  Asian  countries  have  more  than  doubled  since  1999,  with  total  freight \nturnover growing from 145 billion ton-kilometers (ton-km) in 1999 to about 300 billion ton-km in \n2006.  The  PRC  has  emerged  as  a  major  trading  partner,  with  its  share  in  the  total  imports  of \nCentral Asian countries3 exceeding 20% in 2006. A remarkable increase in trade with the PRC \nhas  been  exhibited  by  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  (with  15-fold  growth  from  2001  to  2005)  and \nTajikistan (with 20-fold growth in the same period). The PRC\u2019s growing investments in Central \nAsia, particularly in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, will further boost trade. Once the project \nroad  and  associated  border  infrastructure  and  procedures  are  improved,  the  road  share  of \nimports from the PRC will grow significantly and the proportion of exports will pick up gradually, \nespecially once negotiated and potential mining and resource concessions to Chinese investors \nbecome operational in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan.  \n \nThe Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s trade volume with the PRC rose from 141,606 tons (81% of total \n5. \ntrade)  in  2002  to  540,147  tons  (92%  of  total  trade)  in  2007.

The railway network consists of \ntwo separate branch lines, one linking the north of the country to the Kazakhstan\u2019s rail system \nand another linking the south to Uzbekistan\u2019s rail system, with no direct link between the two. Air \ntransport  accounts  for  less  than  1%  of  passenger  movements,  and  these  are  mainly  between \nBishkek and Osh. Water transport is confined to a few vessels on Lake Issyk-Kul. \n \nThe  demand  for  transport  has  fallen  dramatically  since  the  country\u2019s  independence  in \n7. \n1991. The lowest levels were reached in 1995, when the volume of freight in ton-km was only \n14%  of  its  1990  level  and  passenger  movement  was  33%  of  its  1990  level,  reflecting  a  sharp \ndecline  in  real  incomes  and  output.  In  2001,  freight  turnover  (measured  in  ton-km)  was  only \n20% of its 1990 levels and passenger turnover was 57%. Demand grew steadily after 2001, with \nthe railway\u2019s share increasing from one third of the total freight turnover in 2001 to almost one \nhalf by 2006 (Table 2).  \n \n\nTable 2: Transport Turnover Statistics (2001\u20132006) \n\nTotal \n\n2002 \n\n2001 \n\n2005 \n\n2004 \n\n2003 \n\n2006 \n\n331.6 \n1,050.5 \n49.6 \n1,431.7 \n\nTransport Mode \nFreight Transport (million ton-kilometers) \n394.6 \nRailways \n875.1 \nRoads \n38.8 \nAir \n \n1,308.5 \nPassenger Transport (million passenger-kilometers) \n43.1 \nRailways \n4,857.3 \nRoads \n341.9 \nAir \n \n5,242.3 \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n8. \nRoad  Subsector.

The remaining 15,910 km \nof  roads  are  mainly  rural  roads  under  the  jurisdiction  of  local  governments.  About  40%  of  the \nrepublican roads are paved, 50% are gravel, and the remaining 10% are dirt roads. \n \n9. \nDue to a backlog in road maintenance and insufficient funding in the past two decades, the \nroad network is estimated to have lost about $1 billion in road assets. Based on survey data of \n2005, two thirds of 4,300 km were in critical condition, and one fifth of the surveyed roads were so \ndegraded  that  rehabilitation  of  the  asphalt  pavements  was  impossible.  Only  urgent  action  can \nprevent  further  degradation  of  the  road  infrastructure.  Cognizant  of  this,  the  Government  of  the \nKyrgyz Republic (the Government) has set improvement and maintenance of road infrastructure \nas one of its priorities and has embarked on a Road Sector Development Strategy for 2007\u20132010 \n(RSDS), 4 which  proposes  eight  medium-term  tasks  with  an  objective  of  improving  access  to \nregional  and  local  markets.  These  tasks  are  (i)  rehabilitation  and  adequate  maintenance,  (ii) \ntransport  independence,  (iii)  improvement  of  the  road  financing  system,  (iv)  involvement  of  the \nprivate  sector  in  road  construction  and  maintenance,  (v)  involvement  of  local  communities  in \nmaintenance  of  local  roads,  (vi)  institutional  reforms,  (vii)  improvement  of  road  safety,  and  (viii) \nuse of modern technologies in road management and monitoring. RSDS also lists eight prioritized \ntransport  corridors  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  which  include  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road,  with  the \ntarget of improving 35% of the road up to international standards by 2010.  \n \n10. \nTo implement the RSDS, the Government estimated that (i) investment of $490 million \nwould  be  needed  to  rehabilitate  the  remaining  two  key  regional  corridors  (i.e.  the  Bishkek\u2013\nTorugart road and Osh\u2013Isfana road); and (ii) annual maintenance funding of $48 million would \nbe  required  for  MOTC  administered  roads.  While  funds  for  improvement  of  regional  corridors \nwill be sourced mainly from international financial institutions, financing road maintenance at the \nrequired  level  remains  a  challenge.  However,  the  Government  has  made  progress  towards \nachieving  the  required  level  of  financing.  The  total  allocation  for  roads  has  increased  11-fold \nsince 2000, and has tripled since 2005 (Table 3).  \n \n\nTable 3: Budgetary Allocation to the Road Subsector (2000\u20132007) \n(Som \u2018000) \n\nTotal \n\n2005 \n209,350 \n221,674 \n40,790 \n473,819 \n\n2003 \n93,219 \n99,996 \n29,624 \n224,842 \n\n2007 \n319,430 \n1,058,758 \n78,700 \n1,458,895 \n\nItem \n2000 \nCapital Investments \n38,919 \nRoad Maintenance \n74,339 \nAdministration \n16,683 \n131,941 \n \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n11. \nThe Road Fund enacted in 1998 has never truly functioned. Taxes are collected in the \nname of the Road Fund but are consolidated under the Government\u2019s central budget. With the \ndecree in 2003, the Road Fund Council was responsible for overseeing the management of the \nRoad Fund, but it never met. The RSDS suggests the need for clearer and predictable financing \nmechanisms, including full functionality of the Road Fund and revisions to the revenue structure \nand sources. Several countries have introduced second-generation road funds with independent \nboards and management representing the interests of main stakeholders and road users. Unlike \nfirst-generation  funds  that  received  earmarked  revenues  with  service  delivery  following \ntraditional models, these funds have adopted the following commercially oriented principles: (i) \n\n                                                 \n4 Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  2007.

RSDS supports these principles and calls for changes in road financing. A review of \nthe  existing  Road  Fund  and  preparation  of  a  strategy  for  commercialization  of  road  financing \nand  management  are  being  pursued  under  the  CAREC  Regional  Road  Corridor  Improvement \nProject.5 \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nConstraints in the Transport Sector \n\n12. \nStrategically  located  in  Central  Asia  and  given  the  fast-growing  economies  of  its \nneighbors (i.e. Kazakhstan and the PRC), the Kyrgyz Republic has potential to play a key role in \nbringing the external markets closer to Central Asia. Its transport infrastructure\u2014constrained by \nthe  country\u2019s  landlocked  nature  and  mountainous  terrain\u2014suffers  from  frequent  climatic \ncalamities,  operates  inefficiently  with  substantial  maintenance  backlog,  and  faces  severe \nshortages  in  capital  investment.  At  the  same  time,  it  is  confronted  with  growing  demand  for \nregional  access  and  trade.  Key  challenges  that  the  Government  face  to  fully  realize  its \naspirations of becoming a conduit for regional trade are (i) removing barriers to regional trade, \n(ii) building efficient and integrated transport systems, and (iii) catching up on the accumulated \nshortfall  in  sector  financing  and  investment.  As  the  country\u2019s  transport  sector  is  dominated  by \nroad  transport,  these  challenges  are  directly  linked  to  the  road  subsector.  An  analysis  of  the \nroad subsector in the Kyrgyz Republic is in Appendix 2. \n \n\na. \n\nBarriers to Regional Trade  \n\n13. \nRoad conditions are poor and customs infrastructure and facilities at the Torugart border \npost  do  not  comply  with  international  standards,  and  need  modernization.  Border  crossing  is \noften  delayed  due  to  inadequate  customs  facilities  and  complicated  procedures.  Travelers  are \nrequired to go through clearance at the border by several government agencies, including those \nresponsible  for  border  control,  customs,  sanitary,  and  transport.  This  results  in  the  prolonged \nborder  crossing  and  travel  time  from  Bishkek  to  Kashi  takes  up  to  4  days.  This  situation \nconstitutes a major barrier to regional trade. Improved roads and customs infrastructure, as well \nas  efficient  cross-border  procedures\u2014such  as  a  single-window 6  service  and  automated \nclearance  of  border  traffic\u2014  would  help  remove  this  barrier  to  ensure  free  flows  of  traffic  and \nboost trade and commerce. \n \n14. \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic,  as  an  active  member  of  the  CAREC  Program,  has  committed  to \n\u201cworking  together  for  trade  openness,  transport  corridors  for  integrating  the  region  and \nconnecting to external markets, and for developing and sharing the region\u2019s energy resources\u201d \nduring the Fourth Ministerial Conference in Bishkek in 2005.7 The CAREC Transport and Trade \nFacilitation Strategy (footnote 1) calls for (i) establishing competitive transport corridors across \nthe CAREC region; (ii) facilitating efficient movement through corridors and across borders; and \n                                                 \n5   ADB.  2007.

Cross-border \ntransport  procedures  are  being  addressed  under  the  Regional  Customs  Modernization  and \nInfrastructure  Development  Project,8 and  a  cross-border  agreement  between  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nPRC, and Tajikistan will be developed under the CAREC Regional Road Corridor Improvement \nProject  (footnote  5).  Developing  a  harmonized  transport  regulatory  framework  is  one  of  the \ntasks undertaken by the CAREC Transport Sector Coordination Committee. Major improvement \nof  road  corridors  and  efforts  for  better  sector  funding  and  management  are  under  way,  with \nassistance of ADB and other donors.  \n \n\nb. \n\nInefficient Transport Systems \n\n15. \nDespite  the  recent  progress,  the  transport  system  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  remains \ninefficient  mainly  because  of  (i)  weak  strategies  and  regulations,  (ii)  inefficient  planning  and \nmanagement, and (iii) limited institutional capacity.  \n \n16.  Weak  Strategies  and  Regulations.  ADB  has  been  intensively  involved  in  policy \ndialogue with the Government in the past decade, and played an instrumental role in introducing \nmarket-based reforms in the transport sector and developing transport policy statements.9 While \nRSDS was the first step in defining the priorities to achieve road sector development, it largely \nremains a short-term output-oriented document with weak links to available financial resources. \nA  comprehensive  and  coherent  long-term  strategic  master  plan  is  needed  with  emphasis  on \ndevelopment of efficient and integrated transport systems.   \n \n17. \nInefficient  Planning  and  Management.  Planning  and  management  practices  in  the \ntransport sector remain inefficient. Priorities have been driven by the imperative to link different \nparts  of  the  country  or  provide  regional  access.  ADB  has  assisted  MOTC  to  introduce  best \npractices  through  recently  completed  TA10 that  aimed  to  help  (i)  set  up  highway  information \nsystems  and  a  database,  (ii)  introduce  prioritization  tools,  and  (iii)  prepare  road  sector \nintervention  plans.  In  recognition  of  the  need  of  a  new  approach  to  sector  planning  and \nmanagement,  MOTC  was  reorganized  in  2007.  Its  current  organizational  structure  is  in \nAppendix  3.  Four  separate  agencies, \nthe  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  Road  Corridor \nincluding \nManagement  Department  (BTRCMD),  were  set  up  to  operate  and  maintain  main  international \nroad corridors. Two more agencies are expected to be established in 2008. Institutional support \nwill  be  needed  to  strengthen  capacity  of  MOTC  and  help  implement  tasks  outlined  in  RSDS, \nparticularly  those  relating  to  institutional  reforms,  road  management,  road  safety,  and \nintroduction of modern technologies for planning and monitoring.  \n \n18. \nLimited Institutional Capacity. Constrained institutional capacity in the transport sector \nlimits the introduction of best practices on planning, management, operation, and maintenance. \nThe sector\u2019s financial management capacity is weak; and international accounting and auditing \nprocedures have yet to be followed. Despite the growing need, the sector is losing experienced \nmanagerial  and  technical  personnel  because  of  low  salaries  and  lack  of  incentives.  No  effort \nhas  been  made  to  coordinate  with  the  academic  institutions  to  train  qualified  technical \npersonnel.  Neither  is  there  a  strategy  to  supply  professionals  to  meet  the  demand  of  current \nsector needs.   \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB.  2004.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nc. \n\nAccumulated Financing Shortfall \n\n19. \nThe severe fiscal constraints in the Kyrgyz Republic have limited budget allocations for \nimproving  and  maintaining  roads  to  only  20%  of  the  required  level.  The  Government  relies \nheavily  on  external  funding,  which  amounted  to  $350  million  over  the  last  10  years.  RSDS \nstates that the Kyrgyz Republic would need over $1 billion to rehabilitate its 2,242 km of major \nroad  corridors  and  $48  million  for  annual  maintenance  over  the  next  5  years  to  bring  its \ndevastated  road  network  back  into  a  maintainable  condition.  This  is  a  challenge  to  the \nGovernment. The way forward is to raise sufficient revenues by introducing revenue-generating \nmechanisms and involve the private sector to efficiently utilize available funds. To address some \nof  the  above  issues,  the  Government  has  requested  ADB  assistance  to  develop  a \ncomprehensive  long-term  transport  sector  master  plan.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  reducing \nthe  shortfall  in  capital  investment  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  will  develop  a  transport  sector \nmaster plan. \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Strategies  \n\n20. \nDevelopment of the transport sector is a high priority of the Government as reflected in \nits  Country  Development  Strategy  for  2007\u20132010.  It  calls  for  developing  international  road \ncorridors  to  facilitate  regional  trade  and  transit  traffic,  as  well  as  establishing  legal  and \nregulatory frameworks to encourage private sector participation in transport. The Government\u2019s \npolicy  directives  also  require  developing  the  transport  sector  based  on  market-oriented \nprinciples to improve efficiency.  \n \nSubstantial  investments,  as  mentioned  in  para.  19,  were  made  to  rehabilitate  the \n21. \ncountry\u2019s  major  road  corridors.  Along  with  these  investments,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  also \nmade  progress  in  reforming  transport  sector  operations.  It  adopted  the  RSDS,  increased  road \nfinancing,  and  plans  to  outsource  and  eventually  privatize  road  maintenance  operations. \nImprovement  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  is  a  priority  investment  project  included  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s strategy. \n \n\n3. \n\nADB Strategy  \n\n22. \nADB  is  the  lead  partner  in  developing  the  country\u2019s  transport  sector.  The  Project  is  fully \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  CAREC  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy  and  Program. 11  The  Project \nsupports  two  of  the  four  strategic  objectives  identified  in  the  regional  cooperation  strategy  and \nprogram: (i) increasing trade and integration with large markets in South Asia, PRC, Iran, Turkey, \nand  Russian  Federation;  and  (ii)  improving  economic  cooperation  to  reduce  transport  costs  and \nfacilitate  trade  and  transit,  allowing  Central  Asian  countries  to  become  integrated  and  use  their \nlocation to their advantage. Development of the transport sector is also a priority area in the Joint \nCountry  Support  Strategy  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  (2007\u20132010).12 The  Project  will  complement \nADB-led  investment  and  policy  dialogue  in  the  country  and  complete  a  key  transport  corridor \nconnecting its capital Bishkek to Kashi in the PRC. \n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n23. \nThe  Project  is  the  sixth  road  project  for  ADB  financing  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  ADB \nassistance to the road subsector, which totals $210 million, was provided for rehabilitating roads \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2004.

The \nWorld  Bank,  Islamic  Development  Bank,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  and  the \nPRC  have  also  extended  assistance.  In  recognition  of  the  need  for  close  coordination,  key \ndonors  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  have  jointly  prepared  a  strategy  (footnote  12),  which  identifes \nroad subsector development and regional cooperation as priorities for assistance. The external \nassistance provided to the road subsector is summarized in Appendix 4.  \n \n24. \nThe  Government  is  seeking  loans  from  the  PRC\u2019s  Export-Import  Bank  of  China  to \ncomplement  ongoing  improvement  of  sections  of  CAREC  corridors  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nincluding $75 million for improvement of the Osh\u2013Irkeshtam road and up to $200 million for the \nBishkek\u2013Torugart  road.  A  long  stretch  (about  2,800  km)  of  CAREC  Transport  Corridor  1  that \ncrosses Kazakhstan from east to west will be improved with assistance of ADB, European Bank \nInternational \nfor  Reconstruction  and  Development, \nCooperation Agency, and World Bank.  \n  \n\nIslamic  Development  Bank,  Japan \n\n5. \n\nLessons  \n\n25. \nA  project  of  similar  size  and  scope\u2014the  ADB-financed  rehabilitation  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh \nroad in the Kyrgyz Republic13\u2014was implemented in three phases over 10 years. Each phase was \nseparately  prepared  through  ADB  technical  assistance  followed  by  detailed  engineering  designs \nand  the  bidding  process.  Despite  the  complexity  and  geographical  challenges,  the  project  was \nimplemented successfully at a total cost of about $265 million. However, benefits accrued to the \neconomy  of  the  country  could  have  been  greater  if  the  project  had  been  implemented  more \nexpeditiously. The proposed fast-tracked phased approach for the Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road Project \nwill help shorten the implementation period as described in para. 30.  \n \nThe  project  completion  report  (draft)  for  the  Third  Road  Rehabilitation  Project14 indicates \n26. \nthat the capacity of MOTC (the project\u2019s executing agency) remains weak in managing the bidding \nprocess and contract administration, and monitoring social and environmental impacts. Integrated \nhuman  resource  planning  and  adequate  skills  are  the  cornerstones  for  success  in  building \ninstitutional  capacity,  and  unless  the  Government  has  developed  a  comprehensive  sector \ndevelopment  strategy  that  is  based  on  sound  human,  technical,  and  financial  resource \ndevelopment  targets,  it  is  difficult  for  the  executing  agencies  to  get  support  from  the  central \nGovernment for investing in sustainable human resource development initiatives. The Project will \ndevelop such a strategy as part of the transport sector master plan (para. 31). \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  reducing  transport  costs  and  fostering  regional  trade  and \n27. \ntourism  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  PRC.  The  outcome  is  improved  access  to \nmarkets, social services, and tourist destinations. \n\n                                                 \n13 Financed  through  three  ADB  loans:  ADB.  1996.

Outputs  for  the  first  project  are  specified  in  para.  28.  Subsequent \nphases  will  (i)  improve  remaining  sections  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road,  (ii)  upgrade  the  20-km \nBishkek bypass road, and (iii) construct an interchange at the Bishkek bypass road (at Km 9) to \nease traffic congestion and improve road safety. \n \n30. \napproach is adopted and built into the project design: \n   \n\nFor  efficient  and  fast-tracked  implementation  of  all  project  phases,  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nfull feasibility of improving the entire Bishkek\u2013Torugart road is appraised as part \nof the due diligence for the first project; \npreceding  projects  include  resources  and  management  support  components  for \npreparation  of  succeeding  projects,  which  include  updating  the  initial  feasibility \nstudy;  preparing  detailed  designs,  specifications,  and  bidding  documents;  and \nsocial and environmental safeguard documents; and \napproval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  that  allows  the \nexecuting  agency  to  proceed  with contracting and  implementation  prior  to  grant \neffectiveness.   \n\n \n31. \nTo build an efficient and integrated transport system, the Government needed to formulate \na  long-term  transport  sector  development  strategy.  Hence,  the  Project  will  provide  advisory \nconsulting  services  to  prepare  a  holistic  transport  sector  master  plan  targeting  sector  investment \nand noninvestment priorities for 2010\u20132025. The master plan will (i) build on the existing country \nand sector strategies; (ii) refine the policy framework for the transport sector; (iii) develop long-term \ninvestment  programs  in  road,  railway,  and  civil  aviation  subsectors;  and  (iv)  lay  the  ground  for \ndevelopment of intermodal services. \n  \n32. \nThe  Project  also  includes  advisory  consulting  services  to  help  MOTC  strengthen  the \ncapacity  of  BTRCMD  (para.  17),  introducing  (i)  adequate  institutional  arrangements,  (ii)  effective \nroad  asset  planning  and  management  systems,  (iii)  a  reliable  emergency  response  system,  and \n(iv) best practices in effective operation and management of corridor assets.  \n\n                                                 \n15   The initial list of equipment is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n33. \n$4.0 million (Table 4 and Appendix 5).    \n \n\nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $30.3 million, including taxes and duties of \n\nTable 4: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmount \n\n \nBase Costs a \n1.

The  proposed  grant  will  finance  66%  of  the \nproject cost. The Government will provide counterpart financing of $10.3 million to cover (i) all taxes \nand  duties,  (ii)  part  of  the  civil  works  for  road  improvement,  and  (iii)  civil  works  for  customs \ninfrastructure modernization. The proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 5, and detailed in \nAppendix 5. \n \n\nTable 5: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n\n \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n20.0 \n10.3 \n  30.3 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n% \n66 \n34 \n100 \n\n \nADB\u2019s Policy on Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants16 provided \n35. \nthat, for countries eligible for grant assistance, the percentage of ADB financing on a grant-basis \nin the country will be based on such country\u2019s debt-distress classification. The Kyrgyz Republic \nis  classified  as  a  country  with  high  risk  of  debt  distress  and  therefore  is  eligible  to  receive \nfinancing on a 100% grant-basis.  \n \n36.  While  the  Project  will  improve  first  39-km  stretch  of  the  road,  the  investment  cost  of \nimproving the entire road from Bishkek to Torugart is estimated at about $210 million (Appendix \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2007. Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\n9,  Table  A9.4).  As  available  external  funding  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  limited  to  loans  on \nconcessional terms or grants due to the country\u2019s high debt-distress classification, a substantial \namount of cofinancing from other donors would be needed. The Government is seeking up to \n$200  million  from  the  Export-Import  Bank  of  China  and  may  tap  into  other  donor  funds17 to \nsupplement  subsequent  phases  of  improving  the  entire  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road.  As  financing \nfrom  these  sources  has  yet  to  be  confirmed,  ADB  has  programmed  $30  million  for  2009  and \ntentatively $40 million each for 2010 and 2011 from the Special Fund resources to help finance \nthe Bishkek\u2013Torugart road improvement.    \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n37.  MOTC,  which  is  currently  an  executing  agency  (EA)  for  the  ongoing  ADB-financed \nproject18,  will  serve  as  EA  for  the  Project.  MOTC  has  implemented  several  ADB-financed  road \nrehabilitation  projects  and,  with  support  of  the  project  consultants,  has  developed  required \ncapacity  to  effectively  implement  the  Project.  Project  implementation  units  for  various  donor-\nassisted  projects  under  MOTC  were  centralized  in  2007  under  the  Investment  Projects \nImplementation  Department  (IPID).  IPID  will  implement  the  road  improvement  components,  and \nthe  existing  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  under  the  State  Customs  Committee  (SCC)  will \nimplement the customs modernization component. Through the PIU, SCC will report to MOTC the \nimplementation  status  and  obtain  MOTC\u2019s  clearance  for  payments  to  contractors  and  suppliers. \nThe  directors  of  IPID  and  the  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  supervision  of \nimplementation  activities.  Additional  staff\u2014including  professional  staff  with  experience  in \nprocurement, road engineering, construction supervision, and environment, and support staff\u2014will \nbe added to IPID prior to the award of the civil works contracts in order to support implementation \nactivities. IPID will also be responsible for advance procurement action activities. MOTC and SCC \nwill coordinate closely during project implementation.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n38. \nAll three projects will be implemented over 6.5 years from July 2008 to December 2014, \nincluding  advance  procurement,  mobilization  and  implementation,  plus  the  defects  liability \nperiod  (the  period  during  which  the  contractor  is  responsible  for  maintenance).  Civil  works  for \nthe  first  project  are  scheduled  to  start  in  July  2009  and  to  be  completed  by  March  2012 \n(including  mobilization  and  one  year  defects  liability  period).  Subsequent  projects  will  follow \nsimilar  timing  with  about  1  year  lag.  The  tentative  implementation  schedule  is  shown  in \nAppendix 6. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n39. \nAll procurement to be financed with the ADB grant will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Contracts  estimated  to \ncost in excess of $500,000 equivalent for goods and $1.0 million for civil works will be procured \nthrough international competitive bidding (ICB). Civil works for the road improvement component \n\n                                                 \n17 The  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  hosting  Arab  Coordination  Group  meeting  in  Bishkek  on  22\u201324  October  2008.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\nhave been packaged into one contract to be financed by ADB following ADB\u2019s ICB procedures. \nCivil works for the customs infrastructure improvement estimated to cost less than $1.0 million will \nbe  financed  by  the  Government  following  its  procurement  procedures.  Customs  operations  and \ncontrol equipment estimated at $1.0 million will be procured through ADB\u2019s ICB procedures. The \nGovernment has been advised that, before the commencement of any procurement activity under \nnational competitive bidding, ADB and the Government will review the national public procurement \nlaw to ensure consistency with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Any necessary modifications and \nclarifications will be reflected in the procurement plan. A procurement plan was prepared covering \nthe first 18 months of the Project (Appendix 7).  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nImplementation  of  the  Project  will  require  services  of  consulting  firms  in  the  fields  of \n40. \nconstruction  supervision,  project  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  preparation  of  a  subsequent \nproject. The Project will require input of a team of international (46 person-months) and national \n(137 person-months) consultants, who will supervise civil works and provide on-the-job training \nfor  counterpart  staff.  A  simplified  technical  proposal  with  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod will be used to select the consultants. A weighting system of 80% for quality and 20% \nfor cost will be applied. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 8. In addition, \nthe following advisory consulting services will be required: (i) 23 person-months of international \nand  35  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  for  preparation  of  a  transport  sector \nmaster  plan,  and  (ii)  30  person-months  of  international  and  50  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services for institutional support to BTRCMD. Quality- and cost-based selection with \na  simplified  technical  proposal  will  be  used  for  selection  of  advisory  consultants.  The  outline \nterms  of  references  for  consultants  for  the  transport  sector  master  plan  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  B,  and  for  the  institutional  support  to  BTRCMD  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  The \nservices  of  an  independent  audit  firm  will  be  required  for  financial  audit  of  project  accounts.  The \nfirm  will  be  engaged  following  least-cost  selection  procedures.  All  consulting  services  to  be \nfinanced  by  ADB  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n41. \nTo expedite the bidding process, ADB Management has, in principle, approved advance \ncontracting  and  retroactive  financing  from  the  grant  proceeds  for  expenditures  incurred  on \neligible  civil  works  and  consulting  services.  Advance  contracting  allows  the  Government  to \ncommence procurement activities, at its own risk, prior to signing of the grant agreement. The \nGovernment was informed that, in order for expenses incurred under advance contracting to be \neligible  for  retroactive  financing,  such  procedures  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with \nADB\u2019s Procurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Once  the  grant \nbecomes effective, up to 20% of the grant proceeds may be used to retroactively finance eligible \nexpenditures  incurred  during  the  period  not  exceeding  12  months  prior  to  signing  of  the  grant \nagreement.  Alternatively,  the  Government  may  also  opt  for  advance  contracting  without \nretroactive  financing,  in  which  case,  the  procurement  procedures  adopted  under  advance \ncontracting do not conclude with the award of  contract until after the grant becomes effective. \nThe  Government  acknowledges \nthe  procedures, \ndocumentation, or proposal for award does not commit ADB to finance such expenses. \n \n\nthat  any  concurrence  by  ADB  with \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n42. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \nFor greater transparency and accountability, the Government will disclose to the public, \n43. \nand  update  annually,  the  current  status,  annual  financial  statements,  and  future  plans  of  the \nRoad  Fund  through  the  local  media  and  on  the  websites  of  Ministry  of  Finance  and  MOTC. \nMOTC will also disclose (i) its annual financial statement of the funds it receives from the central \nbudget; and (ii) the status and implementation progress of all donor-funded investment projects, \nincluding,  among  other  things,  procurement  activities,  bidding  and  recruitment  procedures \nadopted,  amounts  of  contracts  awarded,  a  list  of  goods  and/or  services  purchased,  and  their \nintended use. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n44. \nAll disbursements of the ADB grant under the Project will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To facilitate \nproject  implementation  and  funds  flow,  imprest  account  will  be  established  upon  grant \neffectiveness at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB and will be exclusively used to finance \nADB\u2019s  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  MOTC  will  manage  an  imprest  account.  The  initial \nadvance to be deposited to the imprest accounts will not exceed either 6 months of estimated \nexpenditures  or  10%  of  the  grant  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and \nsimplify  the  documentation  process,  the  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  used  for \nliquidating and replenishing the imprest account for eligible expenditures not exceeding $50,000 \nper payment. The payments in excess of the statement of expenditures ceiling will be liquidated \nor replenished based on the supporting documentation process.  \n \n45. \nFinancial  management  assessment  (Supplementary  Appendix  D)  of  the  EA  was \nconducted and it concluded that the associated risks are low due to the EA's adequate experience \nwith  donor-funded  projects.  IPID  has  adopted  an  accrual  accounting  system  supported  by \nstandardized accounting software. MOTC is subject to three levels of audit: (i) an internal audit by \nthe  Department  of  Economic  and  Financial  Planning  and  Control,  (ii)  a  statutory  audit  by  the \nChamber  of  Accounts  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  (iii)  a  mandatory  external  audit  for  ADB-\nfinanced projects by an independent audit firm. IPID will closely monitor the physical and financial \nprogress of the Project in accordance with ADB policies and guidelines. ADB will reserve the right \nto verify the financial accounts of IPID and related parties. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n46. \nThe EA will maintain separate accounts for all project components financed by ADB and \nthe Government, and have them audited by an independent auditor that has adequate knowledge \nand  experience  of  international  accounting  practices  and  is  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited \nproject accounts and the auditor\u2019s reports will be provided to ADB within 6 months after the end of \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\neach financial year. The auditor\u2019s report should include a separate opinion on the proper use of \nthe  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditures  procedures.  The  Government  has  been \ninformed of ADB\u2019s requirement for the timely submission of audited project accounts and financial \nstatements,  including  the  suspension  of  disbursements  in  case  of  noncompliance.  The  EA  will \nprepare and submit to ADB quarterly and annual progress reports on project implementation, the \nform  and  content  of  which  will  be  agreed  with  ADB.  To  facilitate  evaluation  of  the  Project,  the \nGovernment  will  provide  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB  within  3  months  of  physical \ncompletion of the Project. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n47. \nADB  and  the  EA  will  agree  upon  a  preliminary  set  of  indicators  for  monitoring  and \nevaluating project performance in relation to its impact and outcome prior to its commencement. \nRepresentative  indicators  are  included  in  the  project  design  and  monitoring  framework.  At  the \nbeginning  of  project  implementation,  the  EA  will  confirm  baseline  values  for  economic,  social, \nand environmental impact indicators. Monitoring indicators will be measured, with the necessary \nfrequency,  during  project  implementation.  Comments  and  findings  regarding  these  indicators \nwill  be  incorporated  in  every  other  quarterly  report  to  ADB.  In  addition  to  indicators  for \nimplementation  monitoring,  indicators  for  project  evaluation  will  be  measured  at  completion  of \nthe  Project,  and  1  and  3  years  after  completion.  Where  relevant,  indicators  will  be \ndisaggregated by gender. Participatory surveys will take place, and the results will be compared \nwith the baseline values. A final report will consist of an evaluation of changes that occurred in \nthe preceding 3 years. The EA has developed the capability to monitor the Project. To facilitate \nassessment  of  the  socioeconomic  and  environmental  impact  of  the  Project,  an  international \nconsultant will be recruited to monitor and evaluate all relevant project impacts. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\nADB and the Government will jointly carry out a midterm review of implementation of the \n48. \nProject  16  months  after  commencement.  The  review  will  focus  on  outputs,  particularly  those \nrelating  to  institutional,  administrative,  technical,  environmental,  and  social  aspects.  The \nProject\u2019s economic viability and other aspects that may have an impact on overall performance \nwill  be  assessed  after  completion  of  the  Project,  or  as  necessary  during  implementation.  The \nreview  will  examine  the  implementation  progress  of  the  reforms  and  compliance  with \nassurances specified in the Grant Agreement. \n \nG. \n\nStakeholders\u2019 Participation and Consultation \n\n49. \nDuring  the  project  preparation  activities\u2014including  ADB  missions,  feasibility  studies, \nenvironmental impact assessment, and social surveys\u2014consultations were carried out with the \nGovernment,  nongovernment  organizations,  local  communities,  road  users,  external  aid \nagencies,  and  other  project  stakeholders.  These  consultations  covered  major  issues  such  as \nroad alignment, transport services, project benefits, and social and environmental impacts of the \nProject. The results showed a high degree of support from project stakeholders. Consultations \nwith the stakeholders are summarized in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBy  improving  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road,  the  Project  will  substantially  reduce  the \n50. \nexisting obstruction to trade and will foster regional economic cooperation. The entire region will \nbenefit from the Project, while the project area will gain through economic growth and increased \naccess  to  markets  and  social  services.  Improving  the  project  road  will  reduce  transport  costs, \ntourism,  and  generate \ncontribute \nemployment opportunities. \n \n\nindustrial  development,  develop \n\nto  commercial  and \n\n1. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n51. \nTraffic forecasts for the Project were based on the following three key assumptions: (i) \npolitical stability and strong macroeconomic performance in the Kyrgyz Republic, (ii) continued \ncommitment of the governments of the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC to regional cooperation, \nand  (iii)  continued  external  assistance  to  the  road  subsector  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The \nforecasts  were  made  for  the  2009\u20132032  period  and  are  based  on  expected  growth  in  gross \ndomestic  product,  income  elasticities  of  demand,  and  analysis  of  regional  trade  patterns \n(Appendix  9).  Passenger  traffic  volumes  are  expected  to  grow  at  an  annual  average  rate  of \n10%, and freight traffic volumes are expected to grow at annual average rate of 12%. After road \nimprovement, additional traffic will be diverted to some sections of the project road from exiting \ndiversions and parallel roads. It is assumed that diverted traffic will constitute about 30\u201340% of \nnormal  traffic.  Generated  passenger  traffic  has  been  estimated  at  15%  of  normal  traffic,  and \ngenerated freight traffic at 20% of normal traffic.  \n \n52. \nInternational  traffic  is  minimal  at  present  but  it  is  expected  to  grow  rapidly  after \nimprovement  of  the  project  road.  Based  on  an  analysis  of  trade  patterns  between  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  and  the  PRC,  international  generated  traffic  is  projected  to  grow  from  the  current  80 \ntrucks per day to over 200 trucks per day by 2015 (85% of the total traffic). Total international \ntraffic  is  projected  to  reach  1,500  vehicles  per  day  by  2032.  Other  international  traffic  may  be \ndiverted  from  rail  or  other  modes  of  transport,  or  other  CAREC  transport  corridors.  Potential \nbenefits  related  to  such  traffic  are  uncertain  at  this  stage  and  therefore  disregarded  in  this \nanalysis.   \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n53. \nThe  economic  analysis  entailed  projecting  costs  and  benefits  for  with-  and  without-\nproject  scenarios  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.19 The  difference  between  the  with-  and \nwithout-project  cost  and  benefits  streams  represents  the  net  benefits  of  the  Project.  The \neconomic  analysis  covers  25  years  (2009\u20132032),  comprising  5  years  of  construction  and  20 \nyears  of  operation.  The  least-cost  option  was  selected  among  mutually  exclusive  project \nalternatives  and  various  pavement  treatment  options.  Details  of  the  economic  analysis  are  in \nAppendix 9. \n \n54. \nThe  major  benefits  of  the  Project  are  (i)  reduced  road  user  costs  through  savings  in \nvehicle operating costs and travel and transit times; (ii) induced roadside industrial, commercial, \nand  tourism  development;  and  (iii)  increased  mobility  and  access  to  social  services  for  local \ncommunities  along  the  road  corridor.  The  project  costs  include  the  resource  cost  of  road \n\n                                                 \n19 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\nimprovement  and  maintenance  throughout  the  project  life,  which  were  estimated  in  financial \nterms  and  factored  by  0.8520 to  convert  them  to  economic  terms.  Both  costs  and  benefits  are \nexpressed in US dollars at mid-2008 price levels. \n \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the overall Project is 14.7%, and the net \n55. \npresent value is about $37.8 million, using a 12% discount rate. Sensitivity analysis tested the \neffects  of  negative  changes  in  key  parameters  determining  project  benefits  and  costs.  The \nresults of the sensitivity analysis show that the Project would maintain economic viability with an \nEIRR  of  12%  under  various  adverse  scenarios.  The  most  adverse  scenario  entails  the \ncombined  effect  of  surging  oil  prices  and  therefore  reduced  traffic  demand  coupled  with \nsustained inflation for construction inputs, which reduces the EIRR to 9%. To mitigate this effect, \ndue  diligence  for  subsequent  phases  of  improving  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  will  need  to \ncarefully  examine  prevailing  prices,  inflation  trends,  and  road  conditions  to  ensure  that \nimprovement  options  are  aligned  with  economic  sustainability  requirements.  The  Project  is \nexpected  to  help  boost  trade  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  PRC.  The  total  volume  of \nbilateral  trade  is  expected  to  grow  from  0.5  million  tons  in  2007  to  3  million  tons  in  2015,  of \nwhich the Kyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC border at Torugart is expected to contribute more than half.  \n \nB. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impacts  \n\nThe Project is not a targeted poverty intervention, but it will have poverty reduction impact \n56. \nand  benefits  by  stimulating  economic  development.  The  results  of  the  social  and  poverty \nassessments  undertaken  are  presented  in  the  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  in \nAppendix  10.  While  the  Project  aims  to  facilitate  regional  trade  and  thereby  benefit  major \nbusinesses  and  those  involved  in  trade  and  commerce,  it  will  also  significantly  benefit  rural \ncommunities  and  especially  rural  poor.  Specifically,  the  Project  will  indirectly  benefit  2.3  million \npeople living along the project road, 51% of whom are women dominant in intra- and inter-oblast \n(province) trade and commercial activities in the Kyrgyz Republic. Two of the three oblasts through \nwhich  the  project  road  passes  have  poverty  levels  that  are  below  the  national  average  of  46%; \nextreme poverty in these two oblasts is almost double the national average of 13.5%.  \n \n57. \nThe  project  road  passes  mostly  through  rural  areas  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  where \nagriculture  is  the  main  source  of  income  and  poverty  incidence  is  among  the  highest  in  the \ncountry.  Residents  considered  improvement  of  the  road  as  one  of  their  top  priorities  for \ndevelopment. Those to benefit most would be people whose livelihoods are directly linked to the \nroad,  such  as  truck  owners  and  drivers,  shuttles  and/or  taxi  services,  merchants,  owners  and \nemployees of caf\u00e9s, fuel stations, maintenance shops, and farmers. Increased labor and trade \nmobility  in  the  area  will  lead  to  increased  incomes  and  employment  opportunities  for  the  local \ncommunities.  Overall,  connectivity  is  seen  as  increasing  transboundary  transport  and  tourism \ndevelopment,  thereby  augmenting  local  employment  and  incomes.  The  immediate  benefits  of \nthe Project are the opportunity for laborers in road construction works. \n \n58. \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  in  the  early  stages  of  the  HIV/AIDS  epidemic.  However, \nHIV/AIDS  has  still  been  identified  as  a  potential  risk.  A  public  awareness  campaign  for \nHIV/AIDS prevention will be included as part of project management. The EA, with the help of \nproject  supervision  consultants,  will  design  specific  links  with  national  and  donor-assisted \nHIV/AIDS  prevention  programs,  and  will  monitor  implementation.  Specific  provisions  will  be \nincluded  in  the  bidding  documents  for  civil  works  requiring  contractors  to  conduct  health  and \n\n                                                 \n20 Economic conversion factor is adopted from a previous ADB-financed project in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nsafety  program  for  workers  employed  under  the  Project  and  the  risk  of  sexually  transmitted \ndiseases, including HIV/AIDS. \n \nC. \n\nSocial Safeguards  \n\n59. \nThe  Project  classification  for  resettlement  impact  is  category  C.  All  civil  works  will take \nplace  within  the  existing  right-of-way  or  on  unused  state-owned  land.  No  relocation  of \nhouseholds or acquisition of productive land is expected. If the Project needs new borrow pits or \nquarries, these are expected to be located on unused state-owned land.  \n \n60. \nThe  project  classification  for  impact  on  indigenous  people  is  category  C.  In  2005  the \npopulation in the project area consisted of 99% Kyrgyz and other nationalities including Uzbek, \nUygurs,  Russians,  Tajiks,  and  Tatars.  Although  the  cultures  and  languages  of  these  groups \ndiffer, there are many similarities. They have lived in the same region for a long time and have \nbeen  integrated  in  the  same  economic  and  social  structure.  Moreover,  the  project  road \nalignment  touches  only  the  Kyrgyz  settlements  and  none  of  them  will  be  adversely  affected. \nThere are no groups with characteristics of indigenous people (as defined by ADB\u2019s Policy on \nIndigenous Peoples [1998]) affected by the Project.  \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts  \n\n61. \nThe environmental classification for the Project is category B. The initial environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines. 21  Based  on  results  of  the  IEE,  the  Project  is  not \nexpected  to  generate  significant  environmental  impacts,  provided  the  mitigation  measures \noutlined in the IEE and environmental management plan (EMP) are implemented appropriately. \nThe summary IEE is in Appendix 11. The EMP as detailed in the IEE and outlined in summary \nIEE  includes  mitigation  measures  and  a  monitoring  program  for  both  the  construction  and \noperation phases of the Project.  \n  \n62. \nThe Government will ensure that the level of environmental impact from improvement of \nthe project road will be kept to a minimum, especially in those areas of high ecological value. This \nwill be achieved through effective monitoring and supervision of construction activities, as well as \nimplementation  of  all  necessary  environmental  mitigation  measures.  All  contracts  will  clearly \nidentify  the  environmental  responsibilities  of  all  parties  and  the  Government  will  enforce  these \ncontractual requirements. All works will be carried out in accordance with the environmental laws \nand  regulations  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  policies,  procedures  and \nguidelines, specifically ADB's Environment Policy. \n \nE. \n\nProject Assumptions and Risks \n\n63. \nThe  Project  was  designed  with  reasonable  assumptions  and  taking  into  account  the  risks \nthat  could  prevent  the  Project\u2019s  intended  impact  and  outcome  from  fully  materializing.  Key \nassumptions  are  (i)  continued  political  stability  and  strong  economic  performance  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic; (ii) the commitments of the governments of the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC to regional \ncooperation  and  to  completing  improvement  of  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  corridor;  (iii)  continued \nexternal  assistance  to  the  road  subsector  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic;  and  (iv)  implementation  of  the \ncross-border  agreement  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  PRC,  and  Tajikistan  with  ADB  assistance \n(footnote 5).   \n\n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\nThe  Project  may  be  exposed  to  the  following  risks:  (i)  the  forecast  international  traffic \n64. \nmay  not  materialize,  and  (ii)  cost  overruns  due  to  sharp  escalation  of  prices  for  construction \nmaterials and labor. Given the current economic development in the region and trends in trade \nand  transport  turnover  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  forecast  traffic  levels  are  anticipated  to \nmaterialize. The economies of the regional countries are expected to grow at least at the same \npace  as  currently,  and  growth  is  likely  to  accelerate  further.  Price  escalation  factors  were \nadjusted for current trend in world prices for major construction inputs and incorporated into the \ncost estimates to minimize the risk of project cost overrun. Based on these assumptions and the \nlikelihood of risks, the Project\u2019s benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh its costs. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n65. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  the  Ministry  of  Transport \nand Communications have given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal \ndocuments: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\nCounterpart  funding.

The  Government  will  introduce  a  \u201csecond  generation\u201d  road  fund \n(para. 11) or other revenue generating mechanisms by 31 December 2010. The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  proceeds  of  such  mechanisms  finance  the  road \nsubsector  stabilization  period  indicated  in  the  Government\u2019s  Road  Sector \nDevelopment Strategy for 2007\u20132010. \n\nTransparency  and  good  governance.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all \ncontracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  include  provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the \nEA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as \nthey relate to the Project. \n\nThe  Government  will  disclose  to  the  public,  as  described  in  para.  43,  (a)  status, \nfinancial  statement,  and  future  plans  for  road  fund;  and  (b)  MOTC\u2019s  financial \nstatement  and  implementation  progress  of  all  investment  projects  including \ninformation on bids, procurement procedures and processes, amounts of contracts \nawarded, the list of goods and/or services purchased, and their intended use. \n\nRoad  maintenance  financing. The Government will ensure timely allocation of \nsufficient funds for the operation and maintenance of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road \nand that the project road is adequately maintained in accordance with applicable \nstandards  and  best  international  practices.  The  Government  will  ensure  that \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nannual funding for routine maintenance of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road is no less \nthan $1.0 million or $2,000 per kilometer per year (plus inflation since 2008) for \nmaintenance of its completed sections. \n\n \n(vii)  Outsourcing  and  commercialization  of  road  maintenance. The Government \n\nwill adopt the road maintenance privatization strategy by 31 December 2010. \n\n \n(viii)  Cross-border  issues.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  modernization  of  the \nTorugart  Customs  Checkpost  is  completed  and  automated  procedures  are \nimplemented by 31 December 2010. The Government will also introduce single-\nwindow (para. 13) customs clearance procedures by 31 December 2011. \n\nConstruction quality. The Government will ensure that MOTC (a) improves the \nBishkek\u2013Torugart  road  in  accordance  with  the  design  technical  specifications; \nand  (b)  performs  construction  supervision,  quality  control,  and  contract \nmanagement in accordance with internationally accepted standards. \n\nRoad  safety.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  MOTC  installs  appropriate  road \nsafety  facilities  during  project  implementation  and  after  completion,  such  as \npavement  markings,  roads  signs  and  signals,  communications  facilities,  hazard \nbarriers,  and  traffic  monitoring  facilities,  all  in  compliance  with  appropriate \ninternational conventions that the Kyrgyz Republic is a signatory to. \n\nEnvironment.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  designed, \nimplemented,  maintained,  and  monitored  in  compliance  with  (a)  all  applicable \nenvironmental laws and regulations; (b) ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002); and \n(c)  the  EMP,  including  the  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  requirements \narising  from  the  implementation  of  the  IEE.  The  Government  will  also  ensure \nthat  (a)  civil  works  contractors\u2019  specifications  include  requirements  to  comply \nwith  the  environmental  mitigation  measures  contained  in  the  IEE  and  EMP, \nand  (b)  civil  works  contractors  are  supervised  to  ensure  compliance  with  the \nrequirements of the IEE and EMP. \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\n \n(xi) \n\n \n(xii) \n\nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  No  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nactivities are expected.  However, if such activities are required, the Government \nwill  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  are  carried  out  promptly  and \nefficiently following the resettlement plan agreed with ADB in line with applicable \nlaws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  is \nmonitored, evaluated, and reported to ADB as required in the resettlement plan. \nThe  Government  will  also  ensure  that  all  land  and  right-of-way  required  for \nimplementation of the Project are made available in a timely manner. \n\n \n(xiii)  Local  consultation  and  gender.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  local \nconsultations  to  address  safety,  social,  and  cultural  issues  during  Project \nimplementation  are  carried  out  as  recommended  in  the  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy. The Government will further ensure that men and \nwomen  are  given  equal  employment  opportunities  directly,  or  indirectly,  arising \nfrom  the  Project  and  without  any  differentiation  of  wages  for  equal  work.  The \nmechanisms  for  maximizing  local  employment  benefits  shall  be  included  in  the \nbidding documents. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\nIf  compensation  measures  associated  with  land  acquisition  and  other  project \nimpacts are needed, households headed by women will be given equal opportunities \nin  the  negotiation  of  entitlements.  The  Government  will  ensure  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nGender and Development (1998) is followed during project implementation. \n\nLocal  labor.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  civil  works  contracts  include \nlegally mandated provisions on health and sanitation and on appropriate working \nconditions, including, as appropriate, accommodation for construction workers at \ncampsites during the construction period. The Government will also ensure that \ncivil works contractors do not employ children for construction and maintenance \nworks. A specific clause shall be included in the bidding documents to this effect \nand compliance shall be strictly monitored during project implementation. \n\n(xiv) \n\n \n(xv) \n\n \n(xvi) \n\nIllegal  trafficking.

The  road \nnetwork comprises 34,720 kilometers (km) of roads, 18,810 km of which are public roads and \n15,910 km of which are urban, rural, agricultural, industrial, and other roads. The road network \nof the Kyrgyz Republic carries about 95% of the country's passenger and freight traffic. The total \nlength  of  international  roads  is  4,163  km,  national  roads  total  5,678  km,  and  local  roads  total \n8,969 km; the length of paved public roads is 7,228 km, comprising 11 km of cement-concrete \nroads,  4,969  km  of  asphalt  roads,  and  2,248  km  of  bitumen  treated  gravel  roads.  The  total \nlength of gravel road is 9,961 km, and there is 1,621 km of unpaved roads.   \n \n2. \nAbout  18,800  km  of  roads  (9,800  km  of  state  roads  and  9,000  km  of  local  roads)  are \nunder  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC)  (Table  A2.1). \nAbout 40% of the roads are sealed, including some with gravel mixed with bitumen binder. Over \n50% are gravel and less than 10% are earth roads. Since most of the roads were designed for \nhigher  traffic  capacity  and  are  underutilized,  the  existing  basic  transport  infrastructure  is \nadequate for the level of economic activity likely to occur in the medium term. Consequently, the \nprimary  concern  is  not  expansion  or  major  upgrading  of  the  transport  system,  but  proper \nmaintenance  and  rehabilitation  to  preserve  the  existing  network.  Roads  at  all  levels  are \ndeteriorating; over 60% now require periodic maintenance or rehabilitation.  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Summary of the Road Network (2007) \n\nBy Class \nLength (km) \n% \nBy Type \nLength (km) \n% \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n\nInternational \n4,163 \n22 \nPaved \n7,228 \n38 \n\nNational \n5,678 \n30 \nGravel \n9,961 \n53 \n\nLocal \n8,969 \n48 \n\nEarth Road \n1,621 \n9 \n\nTotal \n18,810 \n100 \nTotal \n18,810 \n100 \n\n \n3. \nAbout 16,000 km of rural roads are outside MOTC\u2019s jurisdiction. Most were formerly the \nresponsibility of state and collective farms, but the responsibility for maintaining rural roads now \nlies  with  the  district  administrations  following  the  break  up  of  the  state  and  collective  farm \nsystem. \n \n4. \nThe  road  network  was  primarily  developed  under  the  former  Soviet  Union.  Due  to  a \nbacklog in road maintenance and insufficient funding in the past two decades, the road network \nis  estimated  to  have  lost  about  $1  billion  in  road  assets.  Based  on  survey  data  of  2005,  two \nthirds  out  of  4,300  km  were  in  critical  condition.  One  fifth  of  the  surveyed  roads  were  so \ndegraded  that  rehabilitation  of  asphalt  pavements  was  impossible.  Only  urgent  action  can \nprevent further degradation of the road infrastructure.  \n \n5. \nCognizant  of  this,  the  Government  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  (the  Government)  has  made \nimprovement  of  road  infrastructure  one  of  its  priorities  and  embarked  on  a  Road  Sector \nDevelopment  Strategy  for  2007\u20132010  (RSDS),  which  proposes  nine  medium-term  tasks  with  an \nobjective  of  improving  access  to  regional  and  local  markets.  These  included  (i)  rehabilitation  and \nadequate maintenance, (ii) transport independence, (iii) improvement of the road financing system, \n(iv) involvement of the private sector in road construction and maintenance, (v) involvement of local \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n23 \n\ncommunities in maintenance of local roads, (vi) institutional reforms or a road management system, \n(vii)  improvement  of  road  safety,  and  (viii)  use  of  modern  technologies  in  road  management  and \nmonitoring. It also lists eight prioritized transport corridors in the Kyrgyz Republic, which include the \nBishkek\u2013Torugart  road  with  the  target  of  improving  35%  of  the  road  according  to  international \nstandards by 2010. The Bishkek\u2013Osh and Bishkek\u2013Georgievka roads were improved with funding \nfrom  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  Islamic  Development  Bank,  and  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation.  Improvement  of  the  Osh\u2013Isfana  road  is  being  pursued  under  World  Bank  auspices. \nThe Government is also finalizing a program for improving local roads. \n \n6. \nMost  technical  standards  and  specifications  for  road  design,  construction,  and \nmaintenance  date  from  the  Soviet  era.  Although  the  standards  are  based  on  sound  technical \nprinciples,  they  contain  rigid  criteria  for  upgrading  road  capacity  that  are  based  on  traffic \nvolumes and do not consider the level of services or economic viability. The inappropriateness \nof  such  standards  for  a  market-based  economy  is  widely  recognized;  they  need  updating  to \nmatch the needs and economic resource base of the country. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe  motorization  rate  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  low  by  international  standards.  The \nvehicle fleet numbered about 271,000 in 2007, including around 229,000 cars and buses, and \n41,700  trucks  (Table  A2.2).  This  was  equivalent  to  54  vehicles  per  1,000  people.  The  vehicle \nfleet has recently grown rapidly at an annual rate of 5%. This trend is projected to gain further \nmomentum with continued strong economic growth in the country. The rapid increase in vehicle \nfleet size will require development or improvement of road infrastructure.  \n \n\nVehicle Fleet \n\nTable A2.2: Vehicle Fleet \n\nVehicle Type \n\nCars/buses \nTrucks \n \n\nTotal \n\n1992 \n\n1995 \n\n2000 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n176,643\n77,845\n254,488\n\n200,043\n68,394\n268,437\n\n191,423\n54,638\n246,061\n\n202,520\n42,679\n245,199\n\n220,359 \n41,566 \n261,925 \n\n229,644\n41,716\n271,360\n\nInstitutions \n\n     Source: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe Automobile Roads Act gives the main responsibility for planning and administration \nof  road  policies,  programs,  and  projects  to  MOTC,  which  is  responsible  for  policy,  regulation, \nplanning,  and  development  of  transport  and  communications,  including  road,  railway,  and \naviation  sectors.  To  increase  efficiency  and  in  line  with  RSDS  objectives,  MOTC  was \nreorganized  in  2007.  It  plans  to  gradually  devolve  its  operational  functions  to  a  multilevel \nexecuting  body.  Its  current  organizational  structure  is  in  Appendix  3.  Four  separate  corridor \nmanagement  agencies  to  replace  existing  regional  roads  departments  were  established;  two \nmore agencies are expected to be established in 2008. These corridor agencies are responsible \nfor operation and maintenance of the core international road network and roads interconnecting \nwith  them.  The  functions  of  the  existing  regional  road  agencies  (PLUADs  and  UADs)1 will  be \ndownsized  to  contractual  and  financial  oversight  for  MOTC,  while  58  existing  local  road \nmaintenance units are planned to be privatized as required under RSDS. \n  \n\n                                                 \n1 These  are  Russian  acronyms  for  regional  road  maintenance  department  (PLUAD)  and  local  road  maintenance \n\nsubdivision (UAD) of PLUAD. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nFinancing and Maintenance \n\nOther important agencies in the road sector are (i) KyrgyzIntrans, a holding agency for \n9. \nsix freight transport companies and forwarding agencies engaged mainly in international trade; \nand (ii) technical agencies in various stages of divestment under MOTC\u2019s control, including the \nRoad  Design  Institute  (Kyrgyzdortransproekt)  and  a  small  agency  responsible  for  developing \nand testing new road construction techniques and equipment (Kyrgyztranstekhnika). \n \nD. \n \nThe Road Fund enacted in 1998 has never truly functioned. Taxes are collected in the \n10. \nname  of  the  Road  Fund,  but  are  consolidated  under  the  Government\u2019s  central  budget  of  the \nMinistry of Finance. The Road Fund Council, with the responsibility to oversee the management \nof the Road Fund, was decreed in 2003, but it never met. RSDS suggests the need for clearer \nand  predictable  financing  mechanisms,  including  full  functionality  of  the  Road  Fund,  and \nrevisions to the revenue structure and sources. \n \n11. \nTo implement the RSDS, the Government estimated that (i) investment of $490 million \nwould be needed to complete the rehabilitation of the remaining two key regional corridors, i.e., \nthe  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  and  Osh\u2013Isfana  road;  and  (ii)  annual  maintenance  funding  of  $48 \nmillion  would  be  required  for  all  MOTC-administered  roads.  While  funds  for  improvement  of \nregional corridors will be sourced mainly from international financial institutions, financing road \nmaintenance  at  the  required  level  remains  a  challenge.  However,  the  Government  has  made \nprogress  towards  achieving  the  required  level  of  financing.  The  total  allocation  for  roads  has \nincreased 11-fold since 2000, and tripled since 2005 (Table A2.3).  \n \n\nTable A2.3: Budgetary Allocation to the Road Subsector (2000\u20132007) \n(Som \u2018000) \n\nTotal \n\n2003 \n93,219 \n99,996 \n29,624 \n224,842 \n\n2000 \n38,919 \n74,339 \n16,683 \n131,941 \n\n2005 \n209,350 \n221,674 \n40,790 \n473,819 \n\n2007 \n319,430 \n1,058,758 \n78,700 \n1,458,895 \n\nItem \nCapital Investments \nRoad Maintenance \nAdministration \n \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n12. \nBased on the survey results of 2005, about 502 out of 2,231 km of surveyed roads are in \ngood condition, 133 km are satisfactory, 250 km are unsatisfactory, and 1,346 km of roads are \nin critical condition. About 200 km of paved roads are lost annually due to inadequate financing \nfor maintenance in the past; about 1,000 km were lost during the last 5 years.  \n \n13. \nIn 2003, the total budget allocation to MOTC for roads was Som224.8 million (or $5.15 \nmillion). This figure was slightly increased in 2004 to Som278.6 million due to emergency costs. \nIn addition, the funds allocated for road maintenance constitute less than 30% (27.4% in 2003) \nof the total allocation to the road sector when external financing for capital investment projects is \ntaken  into  account.  However,  if  only  budget  allocation  is  considered,  road  maintenance \nallocation  to  MOTC  represents  60\u201365%  of  the  total.

The original allocation in 2003 was Som157.37 million. Usually in \nmid-year, following requests for emergency repairs (mostly due to landslides), a supplementary \nbudget is allocated. In 2003, an additional amount of Som67.5 million was allocated to MOTC \n(Som41.5 million for the Bishkek\u2013Osh road and Som26 million for the rest of the network). Over \nthe  years,  the  supplementary  budget  varied  while  the  original  budget  remained  relatively \nconsistent. \n \n15. \nThe  average  road  maintenance  expenditure  of  the  MOTC  network  is  $375/km,  where \nfunds  are  highly  skewed  towards  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road.  This  amount  is  far  lower  than  the \nusually  quoted  figure  of  $2,000/km  needed  to  adequately  maintain  a  road  network.  Moreover, \nonly 20% of the maintenance work is routine maintenance, giving a very low average figure of \n$60/km  for  the  network.  In  some  cases,  roads  have  deteriorated  so  much  that  the  size  of \npotholes does not permit any further routine maintenance and major repairs are needed. \n \nThe Bishkek\u2013Osh Road Directorate accounts for approximately 10% of the total network \n16. \nbut  received  40%  of  the  annual  budget  allocation.  On  a  per-kilometer  figure,  it  means  that  in \n2003 the Bishkek\u2013Osh road spent $1,327/km while over the rest of the network only $257/km \nwas spent.  \n \nE. \n \n17. \nRecognizing  that  road  safety  is  critical,  the  Government  stressed  the  need  for \nimprovement  in  this  area  in  RSDS  as  one  of  the  major  tasks  and  set  a  target  to  reduce  the \ncurrent  rate  of  accidents  from  22  fatalities  per  1,000  vehicles  to  17  during  2008\u20132010.  The \nPermanent Secretariat for Road Safety, established in 2004 under the Asian Development Bank \nassistance, has been actively working to revise existing road safety guidelines and prepare the \nNational Road Safety Program, which is expected to be approved in late 2008. The Road Safety \nSecretariat  has  identified  an  alarming  national  problem  of  road  accident  injuries  and  property \ndamage.  \n \nIncreased motorization contributes to a higher number of accidents, with the fatality rate \n18. \ngrowing  steadily.  Analysis  of  accident  data  shows  that  speeding  and  reckless  driving  are  the \nmajor factors contributing to high fatality rates. The poor road network condition is also a major \ncontributor.

The private sector plays a \nkey  role  in  provision  of  road  transport  services,  accounting  for  more  than  80%  of  freight  and \npassenger  transport.  The  state-owned  road  transport  operators  were  largely  privatized  and \nforeign road transport operators are allowed to set up their businesses. Freight charges and bus \nfares  for  domestic  road  transport  are  determined  based  on  market  conditions,  though  the \nGovernment is setting up tariffs and prices for urban passenger transport, and cross-border and \ninternational  transit  traffic.  The  Government  has  recently  introduced  vehicle  licensing  to \nenhance axle-load control and improve road safety.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\nMANAGEMENT STRUCTURE OF THE \nMINISTRY OF

The Project will reduce transport cost by improving the Bishkek\u2013\nTorugart  road  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  which  is  part  of  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Transport Corridor 1,1 connecting the Kyrgyz Republic and the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). The Project will be implemented in three phases during 2009\u20132013. \nThe  entire  road  from  Bishkek  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2013PRC  border  at  Torugart  is  divided  into \nnine homogenous sections for the purpose of economic analysis. Project 1 will improve about \n40 kilometers (km) of the road stretch from Km 400 to Km 439 (within Char Pass\u2013Ak Beit Pass \nsection). \n \nThe  economic  analysis  examined  the  expected  contribution  of  the  project  road  to  the \n2. \ncountry and region based on a comparison of with- and without-project scenarios in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Project.2 The economic analysis covers the \nperiod  of  2009\u20132032,  comprising  5  years  of  implementation  and  20  years  of  operation, \nexpressed in mid-2008 dollar price levels.  \n \nB. \n \nRoad  Condition.

The traffic forecasts are based on expected growth in gross domestic \nproduct,  income  elasticities  of  demand,  and  analysis  of  regional  trade  patterns.  Additional \nassumptions  include  (i)  continued  political  stability  and  strong  macroeconomic  performance  in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic, (ii) continued commitments of the governments of the Kyrgyz Republic and \nthe PRC to regional cooperation and to completing improvement of the Bishkek-Torugart road \ncorridor, and (iii) continued external assistance to the road subsector in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \nThe normal passenger traffic volume is expected to grow at an average annual rate of \n7. \n10%, and freight traffic volumes are expected to grow at 12%. Additional traffic will be diverted \nto  (i)  the  Kuvaki  Pass  section  (Km  146\u2013Km  214),  upon  completion  of  project  2;  and  (ii)  the \nBishkek bypass road (Km 9\u2013Km 82), upon completion of project 3. It is estimated that about half \nof  the  heavy  trucks  travel  via  Balykchi,  making  an  additional  47-km  detour  due  to  road \nconditions  and  traffic  safety  restrictions  at  the  Kuvaki  Pass.  Similarly,  traffic  between  Bishkek \nand Buruldai travels along the two parallel alternatives roads. It is assumed that diverted traffic \nwill  constitute  about  30\u201340%  of  the  normal  traffic  along  the  sections  in  question.  Improved \nproject road conditions and facilities are expected to (i) reduce road user costs through savings \nin vehicle operating costs and travel and transit times; (ii) induce roadside industrial, commercial, \nand  tourism  development;  and  (iii)  increase  mobility  and  access  to  social  services  for  local \ncommunities  along  the  road  corridor.  Hence,  generated  volume  for  passenger  traffic  was \nestimated  at  7%  of  normal  traffic,  and  generated  freight  volume  at  10%  of  normal  traffic.  The \ntraffic forecast is summarized in Table A9.3. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\nSection Name \nBishkek Bypass (east)  \n(Km 9\u2013Km 18) \n\nBishkek Bypass (east)  \n(Km 18\u2013 Km 82) \n\nChim Korgon\u2013Buruldai  \n(Km 82\u2013 Km 103) \n\nBuruldai\u2013Kuvaki Junc.  \n(Km103\u2013 Km 146) \n\nKuvaki Pass Sec.  \n(Km146\u2013 Km 214) \n\nKuvaki Sec\u2013Dolon Pass  \n(Km 214\u2013 Km 280) \n\nDolon Pass\u2013Char Pass  \n(Km 280\u2013 Km 365) \n\nChar Pass\u2013Ak Beit Pass \n(Km 365\u2013 Km 476) \n\nAk Beit\u2013Torugart Pass  \n(Km 476\u2013 Km 539)  \n\nTable A9.3: Forecast Annual Average Daily Traffic (2008\u20132032) \n(vehicles per day) \n\nTrucks \n\n \n  Motor \ncycles \n\n \n \nYear \n2008 \n2014 \n2020 \n2026 \n2032 \n2008 \n2014 \n2020 \n2026 \n2032 \n2008 \n2014 \n2020 \n2026 \n2032 \n2008 \n2014 \n2020 \n2026 \n2032 \n2008 \n2014 \n2020 \n2026 \n2032 \n2008 \n2014 \n2020 \n2026 \n2032 \n2008 \n2014 \n2020 \n2026 \n2032 \n2008 \n2014 \n2020 \n2026 \n2032 \n2008 \n2014 \n2020 \n2026 \n2032 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCars \n3,250 \n7,308 \n12,946 \n22,934 \n40,630 \n1,847 \n5,484 \n9,716 \n17,213 \n30,493 \n3,834 \n7,810 \n13,835 \n24,510 \n43,420 \n2,761 \n5,624 \n9,963 \n17,650 \n31,269 \n467 \n2,169 \n3,842 \n6,806 \n12,058 \n544 \n2,021 \n3,580 \n6,342 \n11,235 \n832 \n1,772 \n3,139 \n5,561 \n9,852 \n217 \n442 \n783 \n1,387 \n2,457 \n10 \n20 \n36 \n64 \n113 \n\nVans  Buses \n75 \n197 \n348 \n617 \n1,093 \n50 \n148 \n261 \n463 \n820 \n99 \n197 \n349 \n619 \n1,096 \n95 \n193 \n341 \n605 \n1,071 \n4 \n20 \n35 \n61 \n109 \n6 \n22 \n38 \n68 \n120 \n12 \n26 \n46 \n81 \n144 \n2 \n4 \n8 \n13 \n24 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\n538 \n813 \n1,440 \n2,551 \n4,520 \n205 \n610 \n1,081 \n1,915 \n3,392 \n628 \n1,282 \n2,271 \n4,023 \n7,127 \n546 \n1,111 \n1,969 \n3,488 \n6,180 \n63 \n293 \n519 \n920 \n1,629 \n44 \n162 \n287 \n509 \n901 \n35 \n74 \n130 \n231 \n409 \n11 \n23 \n40 \n71 \n126 \n4 \n8 \n14 \n24 \n43 \n\n2/3-\naxle  \n367 \n426 \n841 \n1,659 \n3,275 \n92 \n320 \n631 \n1,245 \n2,458 \n173 \n413 \n815 \n1,608 \n3,174 \n143 \n336 \n663 \n1,309 \n2,584 \n41 \n221 \n436 \n860 \n1,697 \n64 \n276 \n546 \n1,077 \n2,125 \n79 \n196 \n387 \n764 \n1,509 \n19 \n45 \n88 \n174 \n344 \n7 \n17 \n33 \n65 \n128 \n\nMulti-\naxle \n124 \n270 \n533 \n1,052 \n2,077 \n59 \n203 \n400 \n790 \n1,559 \n75 \n183 \n362 \n715 \n1,411 \n89 \n207 \n408 \n805 \n1,590 \n25 \n136 \n269 \n531 \n1,048 \n53 \n229 \n453 \n893 \n1,763 \n58 \n143 \n283 \n559 \n1,103 \n50 \n119 \n234 \n462 \n913 \n69 \n164 \n323 \n637 \n1,257 \n\nTotal \n4,363\n9,026\n16,125\n28,835\n51,625\n2,259\n6,774\n12,101\n21,643\n38,744\n4,840\n9,926\n17,687\n31,548\n56,326\n3,637\n7,481\n13,358\n23,875\n42,719\n601\n2,841\n5,104\n9,181\n16,546\n728\n2,753\n4,962\n8,966\n16,247\n1,016\n2,211\n3,985\n7,196\n13,017\n300\n634\n1,155\n2,109\n3,867\n90\n209\n406\n790\n1,541\n\n9 \n12 \n17 \n22 \n30 \n6 \n9 \n12 \n17 \n22 \n31 \n41 \n55 \n73 \n98 \n3 \n10 \n14 \n18 \n25 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n3 \n5 \n17 \n43 \n58 \n77 \n103 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n1 \n1 \n2 \n2 \n3 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\nKm = kilometer. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n41 \n\nEconomic Costs \n\nC. \n \n8. \nConstruction Costs. The economic costs were estimated based on the financial cost of \nthe  capital  expenditure,  including  physical  contingencies,  but  excluding  price  contingencies, \ninterest during construction, and taxes and duties. Using a world price numeraire, nontradable \ncosts were converted from financial to economic costs by applying a standard conversion factor \nof  0.85. 3  The  construction  period  of  the  project  road  was  estimated  based  on  the  project \nimplementation schedule. The least-cost option was selected among mutually exclusive project \nalternatives  and  various  pavement  treatment  options.  Options  analyzed  were  (i)  rehabilitation, \n(ii) partial reconstruction, and (iii) full reconstruction and new alternative alignments. In all cases, \npartial  and/or  full  reconstruction  of  the  road  within  the  existing  right-of-way  was  preferred, \ndepending on the existing condition of the road.

It  was  assumed  that  the  existing  gravel  and/or  paved  surfaces \n9. \nwould require $1,200\u2013$1,350/km for annual routine and winter maintenance and regraveling at \nregular  intervals.  The  paved  road  sections  would  require  resealing  with  a  single  bituminous \nlayer  every  5\u20137  years  at  an  average  cost  of  $35,000/km.  The  economic  maintenance  costs \nwere based on unit rates derived from ongoing operations and estimated quantities.  \n \n10. \nRoad  User  Costs.  The  Highway  Development  and  Management  Model  HDM-4  was \nused  as  a  basis  for  the  analysis.  The  analysis  focuses  on  savings  in  transport  costs.  Value \nadded from better transport links resulting in new industries and employment are not quantified \nspecifically, but are captured through benefits to generated traffic. Vehicle cost data by vehicle \ntype  and  road  condition  of  each  road  section were  used  for  projecting  vehicle  operating  costs \nand road agency costs for the with- and without-project cases. The net present value (NPV) and \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) were calculated by section.  \n \n11. \nAdditional  benefits,  such  as  savings  in  environmental  and  road  accident  costs,  were  not \ncalculated  as  there  is  no  reliable  data  and  the  current  level  of  traffic  on  the  project  road  is \nrelatively  low.  It  is  assumed  that  savings  that  could  be  accrued  from  these  contributors  are \ncurrently negligible.  \n                                                 \n3 Economic conversion factor is adopted from a previous ADB-financed project in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\nEconomic Benefits and Rate of Return \n\nD. \n \n12. \nThe  incremental  economic  costs  and  benefits  were  calculated  by  road  section  and  by \nyear  to  give  an  overall  NPV  and  EIRR.  The  combined  results  are  shown  in  Table  A9.5.  The \noverall EIRR is 14.7% and NPV is $37.80 million.  \n \n13. \nThe sections between Bishkek and the Kuvaki Pass all appear robust. The sections from \nthe Kuvaki Pass to the Torugart Pass have a reasonable probability of meeting the 12% cut off,  \nand  the  EIRR  for  two  sections  is  less  than  12%  because  of  the  relatively  low  traffic  and  high \ncapital costs.  \n\n \nTable A9.5: Combined ENPV and EIRR for the Project \n($ million) \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nGenerated \n\n  \n\nEconomic Costs \n\nRecurrent \n\nB\n\nfit\n\nCapital \n22.87 \n54.44 \n57.56 \n36.07 \n10.08 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n5.85 \n5.23 \n7.84 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n5.85 \n5.23 \n7.84 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n  (84.66) \n 134.19 \n \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.42 \n0.76 \n1.08 \n1.08 \n1.08 \n1.08 \n1.08 \n1.08 \n1.08 \n1.08 \n1.08 \n1.08 \n1.08 \n1.08 \n1.08 \n1.08 \n1.08 \n1.08 \n1.08 \n1.08 \n20.54 \n \n\nNormal + Diverted \nTime \n(0.01) \n(0.02) \n(0.02) \n(0.01) \n0.06 \n0.07 \n0.07 \n0.06 \n0.07 \n0.07 \n0.07 \n0.07 \n0.07 \n0.08 \n0.07 \n0.06 \n0.06 \n0.05 \n0.05 \n0.05 \n0.03 \n0.05 \n0.07 \n0.08 \n1.19 \n\nVOC \n(6.12) \n(6.44) \n(6.14) \n(2.35) \n2.53 \n8.16 \n9.06 \n5.09 \n5.86 \n6.61 \n6.78 \n7.79 \n8.84 \n9.85 \n4.97 \n5.12 \n6.14 \n7.01 \n7.68 \n8.91 \n9.17 \n4.09 \n5.48 \n6.22 \n114.33 \n \n\n \n\nVOC \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.12 \n0.38 \n0.69 \n0.77 \n0.45 \n0.51 \n0.57 \n0.58 \n0.67 \n0.76 \n0.84 \n0.44 \n0.45 \n0.54 \n0.61 \n0.67 \n0.77 \n0.79 \n0.37 \n0.48 \n0.55 \n12.02 \n\nTime \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.01 \n0.01 \n0.01 \n0.01 \n0.01 \n0.01 \n0.01 \n0.01 \n0.01 \n0.01 \n0.01 \n0.01 \n0.01 \n0.01 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.01 \n0.01 \n0.13 \n\nNet \nEconomic \nBenefit \n (25.98)  \n (49.34) \n (46.00) \n (23.75) \n   (2.12) \n9.01 \n20.41 \n5.61 \n6.45 \n5.41 \n5.93 \n6.68 \n9.68 \n15.53 \n5.50 \n5.63 \n5.88 \n7.01 \n7.57 \n9.74 \n12.14 \n4.51 \n6.04 \n12.32 \n37.80 \n14.70% \n\nNPV \nEIRR \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, VOC = vehicle operating costs. \nNote:  Negative  costs  indicate  incremental  costs  saved  under  the  project  would  have  been  incurred  without  the \nProject. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nYear \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n2030 \n2031 \n2032 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n43 \n\nSensitivity Analyses \n\nE. \n \n14. \nThe rate of return is sensitive to the increase in construction cost and reduction in traffic \ndemand. Looking at these factors individually, a cost increase of 30% would reduce the overall \nreturn  to  12%,  whereas  reducing  the  annual  traffic  growth  rate  to  8%  would  bring  the  EIRR \nbelow  the  12%  threshold  value  for  economic  viability.  Assuming  world  prices  for  oil  and \npetroleum  products  continue  to  increase,  and  inflation  for  construction  inputs  remain  high,  the \ncombined effect of these factors would reduce the EIRR to 12% under the assumptions shown \nin Table A9.6. The most adverse scenario entails the combined effect of surging oil prices and \ntherefore reduced traffic demand coupled with sustained inflation for construction inputs, which \nreduces  the  EIRR  to  9%.  Hence,  the  due  diligence  for  subsequent  phases  of  improving  the \nBishkek\u2013Torugart  road  will  carefully  examine  prevailing  prices,  inflation  trends,  and  road \nconditions  to  ensure  that  improvement  options  are  aligned  with  economic  sustainability \nrequirements.  \n \n\n \nSensitivity Scenarios \nBase case \nScenarios: \n(i) Capital costs increase by 30% \n(ii) Prices of petroleum products double \n(iii) Combined effects of (i) and (ii) \n(iv) Traffic growth reduced to 8% \n(v) Combined effects of (i), (ii), and (iv) \n\nTable A9.6: Sensitivity Analysis \nEIRR \n(%) \n14.7 \n \n12.0 \n15.1 \n12.3 \n11.1 \n9.0 \n\n \n0.14 \n42.93 \n5.27 \n(10.97) \n(44.14) \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nNPV \n($ million) \n37.80 \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\n \n\nProject \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: Kyrgyz Republic/CAREC Transport Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\nCentral and West Asia Department \nInfrastructure Division \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.

The  strategies  support  the  Government\u2019s  approach  to  reducing  poverty  and  achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals by balancing social goals with the need to stimulate growth through improving market access to rapidly \ngrowing  neighboring markets and investing  in agriculture to create economic opportunities in rural areas  where most of the \npoor reside. The Project directly supports one of the goals in the country partnership strategy, which is to improve trade and \nroad linkages with regional markets. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe Project is not a targeted poverty intervention. Nevertheless, by stimulating economic development, it will have significant \npoverty reduction impact and benefits. While the project aims to facilitate regional trade and thereby benefit major businesses \nand those involved in trade and commerce, it will also benefit rural communities and especially rural poor.  \n \n2. Design Features.  \nNo specific pro-poor design features are included under the Project.  \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe Project  will indirectly benefit 2.26 million people living along the road, 51% of  whom are  women dominant in intra- and \ninter-oblast  (province)  trade  and  commercial  activities  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Two  of  the  three  oblasts  through  which  the \nproject road passes have poverty levels that are below the national average of 46%. Extreme poverty in these two oblasts is \nalmost double the national average of 13.5%.  \n \nThe  project  road  passes  mostly  through  rural  areas  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  where  agriculture  is  the  main  source  of  income \nand poverty incidence is among the highest in the country. Residents considered improvement of the road as one of their top \npriorities for development. Those to benefit most would be people whose livelihoods are linked to the road: truck owners and \ndrivers,  shuttles  and/or  taxi  services,  merchants,  owners  and  employees  of  caf\u00e9s,  fuel  stations,  maintenance  shops,  and \nfarmers. Increased labor and trade mobility in the area will lead to increased incomes and employment opportunities for the \nlocal  communities.  Overall,  connectivity  is  seen  as  increasing  transboundary  transport  and  tourism  development,  thereby \naugmenting  local  employment  and  incomes.  The  immediate  benefits  of  the  Project  are  the  opportunity  for  laborers  in  road \nconstruction works. \n \nRoad improvement in the Kyrgyz Republic has special significance for women as they are extensively involved in trading for \nsupporting their families. Hence, women are the major road users in the country. Improvement of the road will have positive \nimpact  on  these  women  providing  increased  self-employment.  The  potential  negative  impacts  on  women  as  suspected  are \nincreased  risks  of  HIV  infection  and  trafficking.  Opportunities  for  women  will  be  explored  for  income  and  employment  in \nconstruction activities with equal wages, and their increased self-employment in business and trade. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n45 \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nDuring preparation of stakeholder participation analysis, representatives of the Ministry of Transport and Communications and \ntechnical  assistance  consultants  undertook  socioeconomic  surveys  and  public  meetings  at  village,  akimiat  (village  cluster), \nand/or rayon (district) levels. These surveys and meetings raised awareness and gained local support. There were extensive \nconsultations with the local communities at Naryn and At-Bashi in selecting the final road alignment, and due consideration \nwas  given  to  technical,  environmental,  social,  resettlement,  and  economic  impacts  of  the  selected  road  alignment. \nConsultations will continue throughout project implementation to address implementation-related issues.  \n \nBased on the results of consultations, the Project does not negatively impact people\u2019s livelihoods, social and cultural habits, \nincomes,  and  the  way  of  participating  in  socioeconomic  development  activities  of  the  local  communities.  Therefore,  the \nProject  does  not  involve  sensitive  social  or  participatory  issues,  nor  there  were  concerns  raised  by  the  interested  groups. \nProject stakeholders express support for the Project. A consultation and participation plan was therefore not required. \n \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \n \nGender  assessment  undertaken  under  the  Joint  Country  Support  Strategy  (2007\u20132010)  did  not  identify  infrastructure \ndevelopment projects as a potential area for widening gender inequality in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \nWhile women stand to benefit from the Project, they are also likely to experience potential adverse social impacts, including \nincreased exposure to communicable diseases. \n \n2.  Key  Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \nThe project documents will have specific provisions to address (i) gender equality in employment opportunities related to civil \nworks, (ii) non-gender-based discrimination in labor standards, and (iii) gender dimensions of possible negative externalities \nof increased risk of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. \n \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\n \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\n \nLimited/No Impact \n \n\n \nIndigenous Peoples \n \n\n \nLimited/No Impact \n \n \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n   Resettlement Framework \n   No Action \n\n \n\n \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   Indigenous Peoples \n\nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\n \nAll project activates will be \nlimited to existing right-of-way. \nNo resettlement or land \nacquisition action is expected. \n \nIn 2005 the population in the \nproject area consisted of 99% \nKyrgyz and other nationalities \nincluding Uzbek, Uygurs, \nRussians, Tajiks, and Tatars. \nAlthough the cultures and \nlanguages of these groups \ndiffer, there are many \nsimilarities and historically they \nhave lived in the same region. \nThey are integrated in the same \neconomic and social structure.  \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nIssue \n\n \n\n \nLabor \n\n \nNo Impact \n \n\n \nNo Impact \n \n\n \nLimited Impact \n \n\n Employment  \nopportunities \n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor standards \n\n \nAffordability \n\nand/or \n\nOther  Risks \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman trafficking \nOthers(conflict,  political \ninstability,  etc),  please \nspecify \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\n \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action  \n   No Action \n\n   Action \n   No Action \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n   No Action \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nthe  project \ntouches  only \n\nroad \nMoreover, \nalignment \nthe \nKyrgyz  settlement  and  none  of \nthem will be affected. \n \nThe Project is expected to \ncreate equal employment \nopportunities for all social \ngroups. \n\n \nThe Project does not involve \ntolling or user-pay schemes and \naffordability is not expected to \nbe an issue. \n \nThe Kyrgyz Republic is in the \nearly stages of the HIV/AIDS \nepidemic. However, HIV/AIDS \nis still identified as a potential \nrisk. A public awareness \ncampaign for HIV/AIDS \nprevention will be included as \npart of the overall project \nmanagement. The executing \nagency, with the help of project \nsupervision consultants, will \ndesign specific links with \nnational and donor-assisted \nHIV/AIDS prevention programs \nand monitor implementation. \nSpecific provisions will be \nincluded in the bidding \ndocuments for civil works \nrequiring contractors to conduct \nhealth and safety programs for \nworkers employed under the \nproject and the risk of sexually \ntransmitted diseases, including \nHIV/AIDS. \n\nIV.

The  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  is  about  500  kilometers  (km) \n1. \ninternational road linking the Kyrgyz Republic with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The \nKyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  Country  Development  and  Road  Sector  Development  strategies  for  2007\u2013\n2010  identified  rehabilitation  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  as  one  of  the  priority  tasks  in \ntransport sector. Therefore, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, acting through its Ministry \nof Transport and Communications (MOTC), has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand other donors to provide financing for upgrading the road corridor in order to improve road \nsafety, achieve shorter travel times, lower vehicle operating costs, enhance the welfare of poor \npeople, and increase trade and transit links between the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC.  \n \n2. \nImprovement  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  will  be  implemented  in  three  phases.  This \nproposal  is for  Project  1  of CAREC  Transport  Corridor  1  (Bishkek\u2013Torugart  Road)  Project  (the \nProject). The Project will improve the 39-km road stretch from Km 400 to Km 439 (within Char \nPass\u2013Ak Beit Pass section). \n \n3. \nSummary  Initial  Environmental  Examination.  The  initial  environmental  examination \n(IEE) report was prepared for sections of the road from Km 280 to km 480 (Dolon Pass\u2013Ak Beit \nPass) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines.1 This is the summary of \nthe IEE report. \n \nScope  of  Work.  The scope of work is as follows: (i) collection of information related to \n4. \nthe  environmental  conditions  along  the  proposed  road  section,  (ii)  assessment  of  potential \nenvironmental impacts, (iii) development of preventive and/or mitigation measures for significant \nimpacts,  (iv)  assessment  of  alternative  alignments  and  technologies,  (v)  elaboration  of \nenvironmental management and environmental monitoring plans (included in the IEE), and (vi) \npublic consultations. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nType  and  Category  of  Project. The Project includes improvement of the existing road \nand modernization of customs facilities. The activities include (i) earthworks and erosion control, \n(ii)  concrete  and  drainage  works,  (iii)  asphalt  concrete  works,  (iv)  ancillary  traffic  safety \nmeasures,  and  (v)  modernization  of  customs  infrastructure.  No  significant  realignments  or \ndevelopment of new alignments in previously undisturbed areas are expected. No construction \nand/or rehabilitation activities for feeder roads were included in the Project. The environmental \nclassification  for  the  Project  is  category  B  under  the  ADB  environmental  categorization \nrequirements.  \n \n6. \nLocation.  The  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  is  located  in  the  east\u2013central  part  of  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  and  links  its  capital  (Bishkek),  Issyk-Kul  and  Naryn  oblasts  (provinces),  and  Xingjian \nUygur Autonomous Region of the PRC. The road sections covered by IEE are located in Naryn \nand At-Bashi rayons (districts) of Naryn oblast as shown in Figure A11. \n \n\nProject Description \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\nFigure A11: Dolon Pass\u2013Ak Beit Pass Section (Km 280\u2013Km 480) \n\n \n\n \n7. \nMagnitude  of  Operation. The road sections between the Dolon Pass and the Ak Beit \nPass  will  be  designed  as  a  two-lane  road  with the  carriageway  width  of  7  meters  (m)  and  the \nroad-bed width of 15 m (road category III, as per Kyrgyz Republic road standards SNIP 2.05.02-\n85).2 The  proposed  improvement  options  are:  (i)  road  upgrading  on  the  existing  alignment;  (ii) \nroad safety (road markings, road signs, and guide posts); and (iii) reconstruction of a number of \nbridges and culverts. \n \n8. \nAlternatives  Considered.  If  the  no-action  alternative  is  adopted,  the  existing  road  will \ncontinue to deteriorate, transportation costs and travel times will continue to increase, and access of \nlocal  communities  to  markets  in  Bishkek  will  be  affected.  Alternatives  on  the  location  and  the \ntechnology of improving the Bishkek\u2013Naryn\u2013Torugart road suggested in previous projects were: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nProviding  a  bypass  of  Naryn  town  from  the  west.  This  alternative  was \ndetermined not feasible as it runs through a residential part of the town for 6\u20137.5 \nkm and can cause substantial noise and air pollution, and reduce road safety.  \nLandslide-prone  area  at  Kyzyl-Bel  Pass  (Km  355\u2013Km  357).  Three  alternatives \nwere examined: providing a bypass of the landslide-prone section, a viaduct solution, \nand using the existing route. The Design Institute defined using the existing route in \ncombination with geotechnical measures towards landslide as the optimal alternative. \nProviding  a  bypass  of  the  At-Bashi  Ridge  from  the  east. This would require \nconstruction  of  a  long  section  of  new  road  through  a  remote  and  relatively \n\n                                                 \n2 SNIP  is  a  Russian  abbreviation  for  \u201cconstruction  rules  and  regulations,\u201d  a  standard  that  extends  to  the  design  of \n\nnew roads and reconstruction of existing roads.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n49 \n\nundisturbed area. Construction of a new road was determined to be beyond the \nscope of the Project. \n\n \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nC. \n \n9. \nThe  potentially  affected  environment  is  described  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines in terms of its physical, ecological, and socioeconomic resources, each \nof which is summarized below. \n \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Resources \n\n \n10. \nTopography.  The  section  is  located  within  the  mountain  system  of  the  Internal  Tien-\nShan. The section begins near the Dolon Pass (altitude 3,030 m) at Km 280. From the Dolon \nPass  the  right-of-way  (ROW)  descends  to  the  Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk  Gorge  and  continues  to  the \nMiddle Naryn Valley, where it passes through the eastern part of Naryn town (altitude 2,100 m) \nand crosses the Naryn River. A few kilometers further on, the section ascends to the Kyzyl Bel \nPass  (altitude  2,500  m)  and  Char  Pass  (2,600  m),  and  crosses  them  to  enter  the  At-Bashi \nValley. The section traverses the At-Bashi Valley parallel to the At-Bashi Ridge, until it reaches \nthe western part of the ridge. It then turns south and ascends to the Ak Beit Pass (altitude 3284 \nm), crosses the northern branch of the At-Bashi Ridge, and continues down to the Arpa Valley. \nThe final point of the section is located passed the Ak Beit Pass in the Arpa Valley at Km 476. \n \n11. \nGeological and Seismic Characteristics. Geologically, the section is located within the \nMiddle Tien-Shan that is separated from the North Tien-Shan by so called \u201cNikolaev line\u201d. The \nline  (fault)  crosses  the  section  several  kilometers  to  the  south  of  the  Dolon  Pass.  The  whole \nsection lies within the area where the probability of an earthquake is assessed as 82, i.e., two \nseismic events with a magnitude of 8 points on the Richter scale over 100 years. \n \nSoils  and  Permafrost.  The  Project  area  comprises  a  number  of  soils  that  belong  to \n12. \nsoils  of  mountain  slopes  and  soils  of  intermountain  valleys:  mountain  meadow  steppe  sub-\nalpine  soil,  mountain  dark-chestnut  soil,  mountain  light-chestnut  soil,  mountain  valley  light-\nchestnut  soil,  mountain  light-chestnut  soil,  mountain  valley  light-brown  soil,  and  mountain \nmeadow steppe alpine soil. The top of the Dolon Pass (Km 282\u2013Km 283) and the Ak Beit Pass \n(Km 464\u2013Km 476) are located within island permafrost distribution areas. \n \n13. \nClimate and Air Quality. The climate in the Internal Tien-Shan is continental with little rain, \ncool summers, and cold winters. Climatic conditions vary considerably with elevation. The average \nwinter temperature ranges from \u201325\u00b0\u0421 to \u201345\u00b0\u0421 (the lowest may exceed \u201354\u00b0\u0421), while in summer it \nvaries from 20\u00b0\u0421 to 30\u00b0\u0421. In winter frosts occur in all regions. Rain and snow usually fall in autumn, \nwinter, and spring. Average yearly precipitation is 230\u2013560 millimeters. The air quality is generally \ngood, except on unsurfaced sections where dust generated from passing vehicles was observed. \nThere are no ambient air quality monitoring stations in proximity to the section. \n \n14. \nHydrology. The alignment crosses the River Naryn, the largest in the Kyrgyz Republic, \nas well as two other major rivers, the At-Bashi and the On-Archa. On  descent from the Dolon \nPass it runs parallel to the Karaunkur and Ottuk rivers. High groundwater tables occur in Kara-\nSuu  and  Ottuk  villages.  An  initial  visual  assessment  suggests  that  water  quality  is  good.  This \nappears to be confirmed by reports that the rivers support a healthy and diverse population of \nfish  and  macroinvertebrates.  Chemical  analysis  and  analysis  of  macrozoobenthos  in  major \nrivers  of  the  project  area  was  carried  out  as  part  of  the  environmental  assessment.  The \nchemical  analysis  of  samples  from  the  Naryn,  At-Bashi,  On-Archa,  and  Karaunkur  rivers  was \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\nconducted  in  the  laboratory  of  Kyrgyz  Agency  on  Hydrometeorology.  It  was  concluded  that \nwater quality of all the samples was good, and pollutant concentrations were within acceptable \nstandards. The presence of a diverse range of macrozoobenthos species supports this finding. \n \nNatural  Hazards.  Natural  hazards  related  to  the  section  include  landslides,  mudflows \n15. \nand  seasonal  flooding,  rock  falls,  and  avalanches.  The  section  is  susceptible  to  a  massive \nlandslide in the proximity of the Kyzyl-Bel Pass at Km 355\u2013Km 356. The possibility of mudflow \nexists  at  Km  300,  306,  312,  451,  and  455.  At  Km  460  the  ROW  is  currently  destroyed  by  a \nmudflow. Rock falls can pose a risk to the section at Km 285\u2013Km 303, and Km 354\u2013Km 355. \nAvalanche-prone areas are located in the Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk Gorge at Km 287\u2013Km 313, and the \nKyzyl-Bel and Char passes at Km 353\u2013Km 362. \n \nNoise and Vibration. The majority of the alignment runs through areas with no settlements, \n16. \nbut only mountains, hills, and open steppe. Rare settlements through which the road corridor runs \nare  Naryn  town  and  the  villages  of  Karaunkur,  Ottuk,  Kara-Suu,  and  Karabulung.  Although  no \nsensitive receptors such as schools and hospitals were noted near the ROW, noise and vibration \nare the serious concern to the communities that were raised repeatedly during public consultations. \nDwellings  are  typically  made  of  clay  brick.  For  those  located  close  to  the  roadside,  noise  and \nvibration from heavy trucks have the potential to significantly impact the houses and their occupants. \nAlso, it was noted during the field investigations that the actual speed of vehicles passing through \nthe settlements rarely matches the speed limits. This contributes to safety and noise problems. \n \n\nEcological Resources \n\n2. \n \nFlora. The distribution of flora in the project area fulfills the vertical zoning rule. Sub-alpine \n17. \nmeadows are typical of the Dolon Pass; at lower altitudes they change to fescue steppe, artemisia \ndeserts, and cropland near Naryn town; fescue steppe occurs to the south of Naryn. The At-Bashi \nValley is largely cropland, which changes to fescue steppe in the western part of the valley. In the \nAk Beit Pass area the flora is typical high-altitude meadow steppe. In the Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk Gorge \nthe road passes through areas of Naryn forestry with floodplain and slope forests. \n \n18. \n \n\nFauna. The faunal associations dominant in the project area are shown in Table A11.1.  \n\nTable A11.1: Dominant Terrestrial Faunal Associations \n\n \nArea \n\nAmphibians Reptiles \n\nDolon Pass \n\n \n\nlidless skink \n\nKaraunkur Gorge, Kyzyl-\nBell Pass, east and west \npart of At-Bashi Valley \n\ngreen toad \n\nlidless skink \n\nOttuk Gorge \n\ngreen toad \n\nsteppe runner \n\nMiddle Naryn Valley, \ncentral part of At-Bashi \nvalley  \n\ngreen toad \n\nsteppe \nrunner, diced \nsnake \n\nAk Beit Pass \n\ngreen toad \n\nlidless-skink \n\nTerrestrial Fauna \n\nBirds \nred-mantled rose finch, \nrufous-backed redstart  \n\nrock and white-capped \nbunting, linnet, chukar \n\nIsabelline and common \nchat, pink-billed lark \n\nMammals \nTien-Shan shrew, \nnarrow-skulled vole \ngray marmot, \nmouse, gray \nhamster  \ntolai hare, Siberian \njerboa \n\nwhite and yellow chat, \nred-headed bunting \n\nhouse mouse, gray \nhamster \n\nIsabelline and common \nchat, Hodgson's rosy \nfinch, snow finch \n\nmole vole, marmot, \nnarrow-skulled vole \n\nSource: 1987.

Twenty-two  ecosystems  are  distinguished  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and \n19. \nseven  of  them  were  found  in  the  project  area.  An  assessment  of  ecosystems  health  by \nbiological  indicators  (in  points,  from  1  =  poor  to  3  =  excellent)  was  undertaken  as  part  of  this \nIEE. Table A11.2 presents the results of the study. \n \n\nTable A11.2: Assessment of Ecosystem Health in the Study Area \n\nAssessment ( 1= poor to 3 = excellent) \n  2 \n1.5 \n2.5 \n2.3 \n1.5 \n  2 \n  2 \n\nEcosystem \nAlpine Sub-Alpine \nMid-mountain Herbaceous  \nMid-mountain Spruce Forest \nMid-mountain Floodplain Forest  \nMid-mountain Steppe (lower reaches of Karaunkur River) \nMid-mountain Steppe (middle reaches of Karaunkur River) \nHigh-Mountain Meadow Steppe  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTherefore,  the  condition  of  ecosystems  can  be  assessed  as  \u201csatisfactory\u201d.  Sensitive \n20. \necosystems  identified  by  the  survey  are  mid-mountain  spruce  forest,  mid-mountain  flood  plain, \nalpine/sub-alpine and high-mountain meadow steppe. The survey reports also that the migratory \nroutes of hoofed mammals pass near the Ak Beit (Km 473\u2013Km 474) and Dolon passes (Km 283). \n \n21. \nProtected  Areas. The section does not run through any specially protected area. One \nprotected  area  is  found  close  to  the  project  area;  this  is  the  Salkyn-Tor  State  Natural  Park, \nseveral kilometers to the east of the road corridor (Figure A11). According to International Union \nfor  Conservation  of  Nature  classification,  a  national  park  (category  II)  is  a  protected  area \nmanaged mainly for ecosystem protection and recreation.  \n\n \n\nSocioeconomic Resources \n\n3. \n \n22. \nIndustry  and  Agriculture.  Industry  in  the  Naryn  oblast  is  represented  by  the  electric \npower industry, mining, food processing, and the construction materials industry. Naryn oblast is \nan important agricultural region, specifically in animal agriculture. It supports a large population \nof sheep and horses. In 2005, industrial production of Naryn oblast was Som754.1 million and \nagricultural production was Som4,786.1 million. \n \n23. \nTourism.  Naryn  oblast  has  vast  tourist  potential  that  is  presently  not  exploited.  Major \ntourist  attractions  in  Naryn  oblast  are  Tash-Rabat  (a  caravanserai  dating  to  the  15th  century), \nthe site of the ancient town of Koshoi-Korgon, and the high-altitude Song-Kul Lake.  \n \n24. \nLand  Use.  The  Land  Code  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  specifies  the  following  land-use \ncategories: (i) agricultural land; (ii) settlement land; (iii) land of industry, transport, communication, \ndefense, and other nonagricultural purposes; (iv) lands of specially protected natural territories; (v) \nforest  fund;  (vi)  water  fund;  and  (vii)  reserve  land.  The  land  use  in  the  project  area  is  mostly \nagricultural;  pasturelands  are  prevalent  in  mountain  areas,  while  croplands  are  prevalent  in  the \nvalleys. The Law on Highways specifies the category \u201cland of road transport\u201d. \n \n25. \nNontransport Infrastructure. Infrastructure within the section is represented by electric \npower lines, telecommunication lines, water supply systems, irrigation systems, and canalization \nsystems. As the section crosses nontransport infrastructure in Naryn and other portions of the \nProject area, coordination with the relevant authorities will be required. \n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\nTransport  Networks.  The  Bishkek\u2013Naryn\u2013Torugart  road  is  an  international  road  corridor \n26. \nand one of two roadways linking the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC. On a larger scale, the road is a \npart of CAREC Transport Corridor 1 linking Kashi in the PRC to Almaty in Kazakhstan. \n \nPopulation and Communities. Naryn oblast\u2019s population was reported as 266,500 people \n27. \n(2006), the majority of whom (82.2%) live in rural areas. Communities served by the road include \nKaraunkur, Ottuk, and Naryn (in Naryn rayon), and At-Bashi, Kara-Suu, and Karabulung (in At-Bashi \nrayon)  villages.  Karaunkur  (Km  295)  is  a  small  village  comprising  about  10  houses  located  in \nKaraunkur  Gorge.  There  is  one  three-storey  building  and  several  clay-brick  dwellings.  Ottuk  (Km \n314\u2013Km  316)  is  a  larger  settlement  with  a  population  of  about  1300  people.  Houses  are  mostly \nmade of clay brick. Naryn town (Km 347\u2013Km 352) with a population of about 40,000 is the largest \nsettlement.  This  stretch  has  both  multi-storey  buildings  and  small  dilapidated  houses.  At-Bashi \n(population 11,300) is a rayon center several kilometers from the alignment. Other settlements in the \nproject  area  are  Kara-Suu  (Km  410)  with  a  population  of  4,540,  and  Karabulung  (Km  417),  with \n1,508 inhabitants; the alignment runs through both villages. People usually use clay brick to build \ntheir houses. Ak Beit is a very small village of five houses at Km 464. The ethnic composition in the \nproject area is homogeneous and consists of virtually only Kyrgyz people.  \n \n28. \nCultural and Historical Heritage. According to the List of Historical and Cultural Sites of \nNational Significance, there are 12 historical and archeological sites in Naryn rayon and 28 in At-\nBashi  rayon.  Although  none  of  the  sites  are  located  within  the  ROW,  some  of  them  are  within \nseveral kilometers of it. There are also about 10 Muslim graveyards in the proximity of the road.  \n \nD. \n \n29. \nPotential  impacts  have  been  identified  by  reviewing  each  relevant  parameter  and \nscreening out insignificant impacts from those that can have significant adverse impacts in the \nconstruction and operation phases of the project. It was concluded, as will be shown below, that \nthe  implementation  of  the  project  will  have  significant  social  benefits  and,  if  the  prescribed \nmitigation  and  management  measures  are  fully  implemented,  it  is  unlikely  to  have  major \nadverse environmental impacts. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n \n1. \n\n \n\nPhysical Resources \n\na.  \n\nTopography \n\n \n \nImpacts. Topographic impacts could occur due to altered road embankments, borrow-pit \n\n30. \nexcavations, and quarry operations.  \n \n31.  Mitigation.  No  significant  cut  and  fill  operations  are  required;  therefore  no  significant \nimpacts to topographic characteristics are anticipated.  \n \n \n \nImpacts. Soil impacts may occur due to altered road embankments, borrow-pit excavations, \n32. \nand quarry operations. However, no significant cut and fill operations are anticipated. Provided that \nerosion  prevention  measures  in  the  construction  and  operation  phases  are  taken,  no  substantial \nadverse impacts to soils are foreseen. No long-term impacts to area soils due to increased pollutant \nlevels  are  anticipated.  The  permafrost  island  areas  occur  at  altitudes  of  more  than  3,000  m, \ntherefore  potential  impacts  to  the  permafrost  areas  are  likely  to  occur  during  construction  and \noperation phases near the Dolon (Km 282\u2013Km 283) and Ak Beit passes (Km 364\u2013Km 376).  \n\nSoil and Permafrost \n\n b.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n53 \n\n \n\nc. \n\nAir Quality \n\nImpacts.  Air  quality  impacts  could  occur  in  both  the  construction  and  operation  phases, \n\n33.  Mitigation. Mitigation measures include integration of the geocryological considerations \ninto the detailed design by surveying at the pre-project stage the current condition of permafrost \nat  the  Dolon  and  Ak  Beit  passes,  identifying  and  mapping  areas  of  concern  (if  any),  and \ndeveloping  mitigation  measures.  The  mitigation  measures  can  include  the  avoidance  of  areas \nwith degraded permafrost and engineering measures.  \n \n \n \n34. \nbut no significant violations of standards are anticipated amid the provisions noted below.  \n \n35.  Mitigation. Contracts will require asphalt and hot-mix plants to be located at least 500 m \nfrom the nearest sensitive receptor (e.g., schools, hospitals, or communities), and they will not \nbe  located  within  sensitive  ecosystems  identified  above.  Operators  will  be  required  to  install \nemission controls. Blasting (if any) will be carried out using small charges, and dust-generating \nitems  will  be  conveyed  under  cover.  Road  surfaces  and  excavation  and  construction  sites  will \nbe sprayed with water to keep them moist for dust control. Trucks carrying earth, sand, or stone \nwill  be  covered  with  tarpaulins  to  avoid  spillage.  Contracts  will  require  pre-construction  and \nroutine  air  quality  monitoring.  Construction  sites,  asphalt  plants,  quarries,  and  transportation \nroads will be monitored for total suspended particles during the construction phase. An ambient \nair quality monitoring station will be set up in Naryn town to monitor pollution in the vicinity of the \nroad corridor in the operation phase. (Currently there is no ambient air quality station in Naryn.) \nThe upgraded road will improve air quality and reduce dust emissions, as the sections of road \nthat do not have an asphalt surface will be upgraded and covered with asphalt. \n \n \n \n36. \nImpacts.  Surface  water  impacts  could  occur  during  construction  period  due  to  the \nerosion  and  construction  activities.  Provided  that  road  drainage  systems  are  improved, \nenhancement of water quality can occur at the operation phase. No impacts are anticipated to \navailability of water for domestic or agricultural use, except in Naryn town where water supply \npipelines  may  be  temporarily  impacted  during  construction.  Potential  impacts  to  local  water \nsupplies  include  the  possibility  of  temporary  labor  camps  wastewater  disposal  during  the \nconstruction  period.  No  impacts  to  groundwater  resources  are  anticipated  as  a  result  of  the \nproposed activities in the road corridor in either the construction or operation phases.  \n \n37.  Mitigation.  The  Project  will  install  adequately  sized  drainage  facilities  to  accommodate \nforeseeable  flood  levels  and  will  stabilize  downstream  slopes  with  concrete  or  rock  gabions  or \nwalls to avoid erosion. Potential adverse impacts to the surface hydrology in construction phase of \nthe Project will be avoided through the enforcement of contract provisions. Contract provisions will \nensure  that  construction  camps  and  other  potential  sources  of  secondary  impacts  are  properly \nsited  and  provided  with  drainage  and  wastewater  facilities.  Water  quality  will  be  monitored  by \nchemical analysis and bioindicators during construction and operational phases. Monitoring points \nwill be located at the Karaunkur, Ottuk, On-Archa, Naryn and At-Bashi rivers. \n \n \n \n38. \nImpact.  Landslides,  rock  falls,  avalanches,  and  mudflows  may  be  triggered  by  different \nnatural and anthropogenic factors, pose hazards to people and infrastructure, and may block roads.  \n \n\nSurface and Groundwater \n\nNatural Hazards \n\nd.  \n\ne. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n \n\nf. \n\nNoise and Vibration \n\n39.  Mitigation.  For  the  landslide-prone  area  (Km  355\u2013Km  357)  the  Design  Institute \nproposes  using  the  existing  road  in  combination  with  the  geotechnical  measures.  Mitigation \nmeasures  for  rock  fall-prone  areas  will  include  installation  of  rock  fall  retaining  structures  and \nrock fall warning signs as will be decided in the detailed design stage of the Project. Mudflows \nwill  be  mitigated  by  installation  of  box  culverts.  Artificial  release  of  avalanches  with  artillery  (a \ncommonly used method for avalanche control in the Kyrgyz Republic) will be used. \n \n \n \n40. \nImpacts. According to the local people from Karaunkur, Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and Karabulung \nvillages living in proximity to the road, noise and vibration have an impact on their houses. Special \nconcern is expressed over overloaded trucks transporting cargo to and from the PRC.  \n \n41.  Mitigation.  A  survey  that  includes  baseline  instrumental  measurements  of  noise  and \nvibration levels and damage susceptibility study will be conducted, along with the inspection of \nthe  present  condition  of  houses,  at  the  preconstruction  stage.  In  case  of  excessive  noise  or \nvibration  levels,  remedial  measures\u2014such  as  special  road  surface  design,  noise  barriers, \nplanting trees, or antivibration layers\u2014will be used along with monitoring. \n \n\n2. \n\nEcological Resources \n\n \n\n \n\na. \n\n b.\n\nFlora \n\nFauna  \n\n \n \n \n42. \nImpact. No threatened or endangered plant species are located in the potentially affected \nROW  and  no  adverse  impacts  to  such  species  are  likely  to  occur  due  to  the  rehabilitation \nactivities. Plant species present within the ROW are either introduced species or ubiquitous native \nspecies,  which  are  highly  tolerant  of  grazing,  compaction,  and  other  physical  disturbances. \nConstruction activities will impact only a narrow band of vegetation adjacent to the existing road. \nNo substantial removal of trees or other vegetation is anticipated. \n  \n43.  Mitigation. The Project will include roadside planting to ensure slope stabilization. Existing \ntrees and roadside plants will be retained. Topsoil from borrow-pit areas will be saved and reused.  \n \n \n \n44. \nImpact.  Habitat  fragmentation  as  well  as  accidents  involving  wildlife  can  occur  due  to \nblocking  wildlife  migration  routes  near  the  Dolon  and  Ak  Beit  passes.  Construction  camp \nworkers and drivers can contribute to poaching or hunting wildlife.  \n \n45.  Mitigation.  Mitigation  will  include  an  extended  study  of  wildlife  migratory  routes  during \ndetailed design stage and providing findings on exact locations of routes and behavior of wildlife \ntogether  with  recommendations  on  specific  mitigation  measures  to  the  project  implementation \nunit. Clauses should be written into construction contracts resulting in immediate dismissal and \nprosecution of individuals involved in poaching and wildlife hunting. \n \n \n \n46. \nImpact. The field assessment of ecosystems conducted within the frame of the IEE shows \nthat,  whereas  no  significant  impacts  are  anticipated  for  mid-mountain  steppe  and  meadow \necosystems as they have already experienced broad-scale changes as a result of overgrazing, mid-\n\nEcosystems \n\n c.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n55 \n\nmountain  flood-plain  and  meadow  ecosystems  in  the  Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk  Gorge  and  sub-alpian \necosystems (Dolon and Ak Beit passes) are at a greater risk of degradation.  \n \n47. \nMitigation. Mitigation measures to reduce risks posed to ecosystem health include siting of \nconstruction camps, asphalt plants, and other related facilities outside environmentally sensitive areas.  \n \n \n \nImpact.  No  direct  impacts  to  the  Salkyn-Tor  State  National  Park  are  anticipated.  The \n48. \nProject  could  have  an  indirect  impact  on  the  national  park  by  attracting  more  tourists.  The \npotential impact is perceived as beneficial and within the environmental management capacities \nof the national park administration. \n \n\nProtected Areas \n\nd. \n\n \n\n \n\na. \n\nb. \n\nInternational Trade \n\nSocioeconomic Resources \n\nIndustry, Agriculture, and Services \n\n3. \n \n \n \n49. \nImpact.  The  improvement  of  the  road  is  anticipated  to  have  positive  impacts  for \ninternational  trade  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  PRC  and  other  countries  by \ndecreasing the transportation costs and travel time. Modernization of the customs infrastructure \nand complementary measures from the Government to improve customs procedures\u2014such as \nenforcement of overloading regulations, longer hours of operation, and also introduction of one-\nwindow  operation  whereby  all  transactions  are  undertaken  together\u2014will  facilitate  border \ncrossing and also result in decreased transportation costs and travel time. \n \n \n \n50. \nImpact. The improved road and modernization of customs facilities and procedures will \nenhance import and export opportunities for industries and facilitate connectivity and access of \nagricultural producers to Bishkek and Issyk-Kul oblast markets. It will have a positive impact on \nthe construction materials industry. Agricultural producers will have better access to markets of \nBishkek and Issyk-Kul oblast.  \n \n51.  Mitigation.  To  gain  the  most  benefit  from  the  Project,  training  on  the  development  of \nroadside  businesses  should  be  organized  for  the  local  population,  and  microcredit  programs \nlaunched as complementary projects.  \n \n \n \n52. \nImpact.  The improved road and modernized customs facilities and procedures will have a \npositive impact on tourism development. Tourists traveling from/to PRC will have more comfortable \nand  faster  travel,  and  local  tourist  attractions  will  be  more  accessible.  The  local  population  will \nbenefit from increased activity such as hotel business, horse rental, handicraft trade, and entrance \nfees collected from tourists. Provided that the tourist season lasts only for 3\u20134 months, the potential \nof tourist attractions is still far from being fully exploited; even if increasing number of tourists visit the \narea, it can be concluded that no adverse impacts are anticipated in the foreseeable future.  \n \n53.  Mitigation. In order to maximize benefits of the Project, the rehabilitation of the road corridor \nshould be complemented with projects on facilitation of border-crossing procedures for tourists, and \ndevelopment of ecotourism ventures. Tourist-oriented road signage should be introduced. \n \n\nTourism \n\nc. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nf. \n\ne. \n\nd. \n\nTransport Networks \n\nHealth and Road Safety \n\nPopulation and Communities \n\nImpact. No adverse impacts on settlement patterns and communities are anticipated.  \n\n \n \n54. \nImpact.  Detours  and  traffic  inconveniences  will  occur  during  construction.  Following \nconstruction, the primary transport impact of the Project will be to improve the performance of the \ntransport sector and greatly facilitate the flow of traffic, goods, and travelers.  \n \n55.  Mitigation.  Care  will  be  taken  during  the  construction  period  to  ensure  that  traffic \ndisruptions to road transport are minimized. Traffic management plans should be prepared. \n \n \n \n56. \nImpact. Improvement of the road corridor will contribute to a safer journey and a reduction in \nthe  number  of  road  accidents,  and  will  facilitate  access  to  advanced  oblast  and  national  health \nservices. However, the improved road will increase vehicle operating speeds on the road and, if not \ncontrolled, accidents involving people and livestock may increase.  \n \n57.  Mitigation.  In  Naryn,  Karaunkur,  Ottuk,  Kara-Suu,  and  Kara-Bulung  provisions  should \nbe made for paved shoulders, road signage and speed limits, and service roads for local traffic.  \n \n \n \n58. \n \n59.  Mitigation. Opportunities for complementary actions to strengthen the community aspects \nof the project area are addressed by the social assessment. In summary, they include training for \npeople (especially women) living along the road on new opportunities opened by improved road \nsuch as roadside trade, tourist accommodation, and microcrediting of roadside businesses. \n \n \n \n60. \nImpact.  No  impacts  to  archaeological  and  historic  resources  are  anticipated,  with  the \nexception of a graveyard (Km 314) located close to the alignment that may be affected by vibration.  \n \n61.  Mitigation.  No  mitigation  related  to  known  cultural  resources  is  warranted.  Contract \nprovisions  are  recommended  to  ensure  that  construction  works  are  suspended,  local \nadministration  and  state  organizations  on  cultural  heritage  are  informed,  and  all  necessary \nmeasures  to  protect  cultural  resources  are  taken  in  the  event  of  unexpected  discoveries.  The \nfencing of the graveyard located at Km 314 should be strengthened. \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n \n62. \nLegal and Institutional Framework. According to the Law on Environmental Expertise, any \nproject  activities  should  be  preceded  by  preparation  and  submission  of  OVOS  (the  Russian \nacronym  for  \u201cassessment  of  environmental  impacts\u201d),  and  its  approval  by  Ecological  Expertise \n(State Environmental Review). The OVOS documentation should include endorsements from local \nadministration,  sanitary  control  bodies,  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Water  Resources  and  Processing \nIndustry and other organizations, depending on environmental attributes affected by the Project. \n \nInstitutional  Requirements.  The  Investment  Projects  Implementation  Department  (IPID) \n63. \nwill be responsible for ensuring that environmental procedures are incorporated in each stage of the \n\nCultural and Historical Heritage \n\ng. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n57 \n\nwork\u2014such as document tender and contract preparation, bid reviews and awards, and supervision \nof preconstruction baseline monitoring\u2014as an integral part of construction supervision.  \n \n64. \nIPID will be responsible for overall contract administration and day-to-day project supervision \nincluding environmental management. An environment and/or social officer will be appointed within \nIPID  to  be  responsible  for  ensuring  the  environmental  management  plan,  including  monitoring \nrequirements, are implemented effectively. The construction supervision consultant will assist IPID \nin its responsibilities, including instrumental environmental monitoring of the Project.  \n \n65. \nEnvironmental  Monitoring  Program.  The environmental monitoring program includes \nroutine  site  inspections  and  reporting  related  to  soil  and  erosion  control;  embankment  and \nerosion  protection;  borrow-pit  restoration;  noise,  vibration,  air,  and  water  quality  monitoring \n(including  baseline  and  routine  periodic  water  quality  monitoring);  and  terrestrial  and/or  river \necosystem health monitoring. Specific monitoring provisions include:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nWater  quality.  Instrumented  baseline  and  routine  periodic  water  quality \nmonitoring.  It  will  be  complemented  with  routine  monitoring  of  water  quality  by \nmacrozoobenthos (once a year for 2 years). \nAir quality. Instrumented baseline and routine periodic air quality monitoring.  \nNoise. Instrumented baseline and routine periodic air quality monitoring.  \nEcosystem  degradation.

The summary plan is in Table A11.3. \n\n \n66. \n  \nF. \n \nA  number  of  public  consultations  with  experts,  local  administrations,  nongovernment \n67. \norganizations, and the general public were held in May\u2013June 2008. Informal consultations with the \nlocal population in Karaunkur, Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and Karabulung villages, and with representatives of \nnongovernment  organizations  were  held \nlocal \nadministrations of Naryn and At-Bashi rayons was conducted on 16 June 2008. Also, consultations \nwith  experts  from  the  Ministry  of  Emergencies,  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications,  and \nAcademy  of  Sciences  were  held.  The  comments  from  previous  large  stakeholder  workshops \nconducted in Naryn and Bishkek in 2006 were used to assess the actuality of the problem. \n \n68. \n\nin  Bishkek.  A  stakeholder  workshop \n\nA summary of the opinions of the public consultations is as follows: \n(i) \n\nfor \n\nThe local population supports the upgrading of the road corridor provided that it \nwill bring more socioeconomic benefits to the local population. \nFeeder roads were proposed by locals to be included in the Project, specifically two \nroads  connecting  rayon  center  At-Bashi  and  EM-07,  and  the  main  street  in  Naryn \nthat is a part of the road linking Ak-Talaa rayon and Tash-Bashat village. \nDue  to  safety  and  noise  and/or  vibration  issues,  it  was  proposed  that \nconsideration be given to bypasses of Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and Karabulung villages. \nNoise  and  vibration  issues  were  the  major  concern  in  Ottuk,  Kara-Suu,  and \nKarabulung villages and Naryn town. The recent letter from the people of Ottuk to \nMOTC repeatedly raised these issues.  \nLocal people should be involved in the road construction. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n \n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\nG. \n\n69. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n \nThe findings of the IEE are as follows: \n(i) \n\nConstruction activities under the Project will be largely of a rehabilitation nature \nwithin  the  previously  disturbed  road  corridor  and  no  significant  environmental \nimpacts are anticipated. \nThe Km 355\u2013Km 357 (Kyzyl\u2013Bel Pass) section is a landslide-prone area for which \nat least three alternatives were proposed: existing route, bypass, and viaduct. On \nthe basis of information available, the Design Institute proposes the existing route \nin combination with geotechnical measures as the optimal alternative.  \nThe  study  of  ecosystems  health  conducted  in  the  frame  of  this  IEE  showed  that \nthere  are ecosystems  in the  Project area  that are  more sensitive  to  environmental \nimpacts,  specifically:  mid-mountain  flood-plain  and  meadow  ecosystems  located  in \nthe Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk gorge, and sub-alpine ecosystems (Dolon and Ak Beit passes). \nAccording to the local people from Karaunkur, Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and Karabulung \nvillages living in proximity to the road, noise and vibration have an impact on their \nhouses.  However,  visual  examination  showed  that  the  houses  are  located \noutside the ROW, and the major problem is probably related to overloaded trucks \nand their noncompliance with the 30 km/hr speed limit.  \nThe  examination  of  baseline  water  quality  in  rivers  of  the  project  area  by \nchemical  analysis  and  bioindicators  survey  undertaken  within  the  frame  of  the \nIEE showed that water quality is good. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n70. \n\n \nThe following recommendations are proposed based on the findings of the IEE: \n(i) \n\nEnvironmental  provisions  in  contract.  Specific  environmental  provisions  are \nrecommended  for  inclusion  in  contract  documents  including  provisions  related \nbut not limited to: (a) erosion control and air and water quality control; (b) location \nof asphalt plants, construction camps, and other facilities (not in environmentally \nsensitive areas indicated above); (c) borrow-pit restoration; (d) quarry operations; \n(e)  safety  provisions;  (f)  baseline  and  routine  monitoring  of  air  quality,  water \nquality, noise, and ecosystem health; and (g) community relations. \nEnvironmental  monitoring. Baseline noise, vibration and air quality monitoring \nis recommended at the preconstruction stage in settlements along the road. \nCapacity  building  for  environmental  management.  A  training  program  for \nselected  staff  and  addressed  to  the  goals  and  techniques  of  environmental \nmanagement activities in road projects is recommended. \nRecommended  complementary  projects.  A  training  program  to  ensure  that \nlocal  businesses  and  population  will  be  able  to  use  all  the  benefits  provided  by \nbeing  adjacent \nrecommended.  A \ncomplementary  project  to  increase  attractiveness  of  the  Salkyn-Tor  State \nNational Park for ecotourists is recommended.  \n \nConclusions \n \nThe  Project  will  have  significant  social  benefits  and,  if  the  prescribed  mitigation  and \n71. \nmanagement  measures  are  fully  implemented,  the  Project  is  unlikely  to  have  major  adverse \nenvironmental impacts. An environmental monitoring plan has been prepared and responsibilities \nfor  implementation  assigned.  A  budget  has  been  allocated  for  environmental  management  and \nmonitoring. A full environmental impact assessment under ADB guidelines is not required. \n \n \n\nroad  corridor \n\ninternational \n\nthe \n\n(iv) \n\nH. \n\nto \n\nis \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n59 \n\nTable A11.3: Summary Environmental Management Plan \n\nEnvironmental \nIssue \nA.
