While  agriculture  has \ntraditionally  been  India\u2019s  largest  economic  sub-sector,  the  past  decade  has  seen  the  services \nsector emerge as the largest component of gross domestic product (GDP). According to recent \nresearch,  the  main  factors  underlying  India\u2019s  long-term  growth  are  rationalization  of  the \ndomestic economy (i.e., improving total productivity) and, more recently, exports of information \ntechnology and information technology\u2013enabled services.1  \n \n3. \nOver the last 10 years, the Indian Government has introduced wide-ranging changes to \naccelerate economic growth and integrate the Indian economy with the rest of the world. These \nreforms have primarily minimized or reduced the role of government in industry and trade, and \nimproved the competitiveness of Indian industry.  \n \n4. \n \n\nSome of the key governmental measures have been: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nSimplifying  the  process  of  setting  up  businesses.  In  particular,  the  business \nlicensing requirement has been abolished for most industries.  \n\nRationalizing the tax regime, including lowering tariff barriers, reducing marginal \ntax rates, and simplifying tax procedures. \n\nSimplifying the trade regime and achieving full convertibility of the rupee.  \n\nImproving  the  overall  investment  climate  by  liberalizing  many  restrictions  on \ninvestment, including some major limitations on foreign investment, deregulating \ninterest rates, and opening up the insurance sector to private sector participation. \n\nDeveloping  the  infrastructure  sector  by  encouraging  private  participation  in \npower,  telecom,  ports,  and  roads,  and  reforming  the  power  sector  to  improve \nefficiencies. \n\nReducing the role of government in industry and introducing a program to make \nprices in the petroleum sector market-driven. \n\nImplementing labor reforms, including amendments to the Industrial Disputes Act \nallowing  easier  closure  and  layoffs  of  workers  in  economically  unviable \ncompanies,  to  encourage  companies  to  hire  employees  more  quickly,  and \nchanges in the wage ceilings set in the Payment and Wages Act. \n\n                                                 \n \n1 Morgan Stanley. 2004. India and China: A Special Economic Analysis. Hong Kong, China. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDespite  these  positive  changes,  which  will  ultimately  support  the  development  of  a \n5. \nsustainable  private  equity  industry,  much  more  effort  must  go  into  reform  to  facilitate  private \nsector development and sustainable economic growth. \n \n\n1. \n\nIndian Private Equity Industry \n\nThe  private  equity  industry  in  India  is  more  than  15  years  old.  The  first  venture  capital \n\n \n6. \nfund, TDICI Ltd. (now known as ICICI), was established in 1988. \n \nIn  India  today,  many  funds  that  have  been  set  up  in  the  last  6  years  are  focused  on \n7. \ninformation technology (IT). In contrast, the portfolio of more established funds shows a broad \nexposure to a variety of commercial sectors and stages of investment including investments in \nearly-stage companies. The portfolio performance of many of the IT-focused funds has, with few \nexceptions,  mimicked  the  dismal  performance  of  similar  portfolios  globally.  Many  institutional \ninvestors that invested in such funds in the late 1990s therefore became wary of any potential \ninvestment  management  entity  that  called  itself  a  \u201cventure  capital\u201d  or  \u201cprivate  equity\u201d  fund, \nresulting  in  a  drop  in  assets  managed  by  these  entities.  However,  the  funds  that  built  a  more \ndiverse portfolio have tended to perform better and demonstrated a number of successful exits \nthrough trade sales and initial public offerings (IPOs). \n \n8. \nIn  2004,  funds  broadened  their  interest  to  a  range  of  sectors  including  manufacturing, \nhealth  care,  banking  and  financial  services,  pharmaceuticals,  engineering,  textiles,  and \ntelecommunications technology. The thriving market for business process outsourcing services \ncontinued to be a favorite.2\n \nThe  current  Indian  private  equity  industry  can  be  categorized  into  four  distinct  market \n9. \nsegments:  (i)  top-end  funds  investing  in  large  capital  transactions  (e.g.,  Warburg  Pincus  and \nGeneral  Atlantic  Partners  [GAP]);  (ii)  funds  managed  by  investment  banks,  with  a  rather \npassive,  transactional  investment  approach  (e.g.,  Chrys,  Westbridge,  and  View);  (iii)  smaller \nlocal  players  exploiting  a  specific  market  niche  like  SME  finance  (e.g.,  Jumpstart,  Andhara, \nIL&FS, and BTS India Investment Advisors [BTS India]); and (iv) locally entrenched, traditional \nprivate  equity  funds  focusing  on  expansion  capital  (e.g.,  CVC,  Actis,  Barings,  and  ICICI).  The \nIndian private equity industry still has few syndicated investments and limited competition in the \nSME  finance  segment.  ADB  has  recently  invested  in  Baring  India  Private  Equity  Fund,  which \ntargets larger transactions and is therefore complementary to BTS India, which operates in the \nSME finance niche.  \n \nSuccessful  exits  in  recent  years  and  good  returns  by  diversified  funds  have  led  to  a \n10. \nslight  change  in  thinking  among  many  Indian  banks,  financial  institutions,  and  insurance \ncompanies.  With  their  relatively  robust  returns,  these  funds  and  investment  teams  look  more \nattractive  to  domestic  institutional  investors.  As  interest  rates  have  fallen  precipitously,  asset \nmanagers  have  had  to  start  looking  at  private  equity  as  an  alternative  asset  class  for \ninvestments.  \n \n11.  While many investors have allocated more to private equity as an alternative asset class, \nprivate  equity  is  still  underinvested  because  not  enough  fund  managers  have  the  experience \nand  financial  backing  needed  to  ensure  sustainable  operations.  As  a  result,  the  private  equity \n\n                                                 \n \n2 Economist Intelligence Unit. 2005. Country Finance: India.

In addition, inflation is likely to \nremain at managed levels, although federal and state budgetary deficits must be controlled. The \nconsumer  market  counts  50  million  households  (more  than  200  million  people)  with  a  yearly \nincome in excess of $1,000. The country has the second-largest English-speaking population in \nthe  world  and  a  technical  employment  base  of  4.1  million.  This  pool  is  augmented  yearly \nthrough  an  excellent  tertiary  education  system.  Leading  corporations  like  Citibank,  General \nElectric, and Unilever are extensively staffed by Indian expatriate staff recruited and trained in \nIndia.  \n \n13. \nAs  a  result  of  these  factors,  the  pool  of  SMEs  with  growth  potential  has  significantly \nincreased  in  India.  To  take  advantage  of  these  opportunities,  SMEs  need  diverse  sources  of \nfinance  for  expansion.  ADB\u2019s  assessment  of  India\u2019s  private  sector  leads  it  to  recommend \nproviding  assistance  to  increase  the  variety  of  financing  instruments  that  are  accessible  to \nprivate  firms.5  In  particular,  SMEs  require  long-term  finance  for  capital  expenditure  and \nexpansion projects. \n \n\nFigure 1: Entrepreneurial Activity by Region\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nLatin America\n\nWestern Europe\n\nUnited States\n\nEastern Europe\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nPersons per 100 adults, 18-64 yrs. old \n(95% Confidence Interval)\n\nNote: \u201cDeveloping Asia\u201d includes PRC, India, Thailand, and Korea. \nSource: Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, 2002 Executive Report. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n \n3 The private equity investment rate as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2003 was 0.59% in Singapore, \n0.47%  in  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and  0.14%  in  India.

Although \ndebt  is  available  at  competitive  rates,  commercial  banks  will  not  lend  without  comprehensive \ncollateral coverage, which is not available to SME entrepreneurs.  \n \n15. \nThe Government in India has recognized the beneficial role of the private equity industry \nin spurring economic development and its ability to promote high value-added employment, and \nhas  therefore  started  to  improve  the  regulatory  environment.  In  1999  a  number  of  new \nregulations  were  issued  and  later  enhanced.  Appendix  1  reviews  the  Government\u2019s  recent \nmeasures to foster private equity investments.  \n \n16. \nThe  lessons  learned  from  its  long  experience  in  investment  fund  operations  will  guide \nADB  in  taking  advantage  of  opportunities  in  entrepreneurial  finance  and  supporting  the \ndevelopment of the Indian private equity industry, while addressing its challenges. \n  \n17. \nIn  conclusion,  a  large  and  growing  pool  of  entrepreneurial  SMEs  in  India  have  great \npotential  for  expansion.  These  SMEs\u2019  demand  for  long-term  equity  finance  is  not  met  by \ntraditional financial institutions, and the private equity investment rate still has a long way to go \nto  reach  the  levels  achieved  in  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Singapore,  and  Taipei,China.  This  gap \nprovides an opportunity for ADB to stimulate the diversification of the financial sector in India by \nsupporting  a  domestic  private  equity  team  with  an  excellent  track  record  in  the  niche  of  SME \nequity finance, and to mobilize funds from institutional investors by actively participating in the \nFund\u2019s structuring and supervision. \n \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  5\n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED FUND \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n\nObjectives and Description  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n18. \nADB proposes to make an equity investment in the Fund of up to $15 million or 25% of \nthe Fund\u2019s total share capital, whichever is less. ADB will not be the largest investor in the Fund.  \n \n19. \nThe primary objective of the Fund will be to achieve medium- to long-term capital gains \nby primarily investing through equity or equity-related instruments in high-growth SMEs in India. \nThe investment size will range from $3 million to $6 million.  \n \nB.  \n\nSponsor and Co-investors \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n\n \n20. \nBTS Investment Advisors Limited will be the investment adviser of the Fund (the Fund \nmanager). BTS Investment Advisors is also the investment adviser of Swiss Technology Fund \n(Swiss Tec), a $22 million fund established in 1998 to invest in Indian SMEs. BTS Investment \nAdvisors in  Mumbai, an Indian subsidiary of the Fund manager, will carry out the investments \nfor  the  Fund.  BTS  Investment  Advisors  in  Zug,  Switzerland,  will  undertake  investor  relations, \nfund raising, and supervision tasks, but the investment activity will be undertaken in Mumbai.  \n \nBTS Group is a financial services provider for the Indian subcontinent. It advises foreign \n21. \nclients on investing in the Indian markets as well as Indian companies expanding outside India. \nBTS Group is owned by the Guggenb\u00fchl-Even family and Volkart Holding AG, which has been \nactive in India for more than 150 years.  \n \n22. \nBTS Investment Advisors has four investment professionals in Mumbai\u2014A. K. Srinivas, \nPramod Shedde, Suneet Gupta, and Bharat Dighe, who collectively have more than 50 years\u2019 \nprivate equity investment experience in India. The managing partner, Alastair Guggenb\u00fchl, has \nbeen involved with Indian private equity investments for 5 years, but in an oversight capacity.  \n \n23. \nThe  investment  team  has  established  a  good  track  record  during  volatile  conditions  in \nIndia since 1998, when the predecessor fund was incorporated. Since BTS Investment Advisors \ntook  over  its  management  in  2000,  the  fund  has  successfully  changed  its  investment  strategy \nfrom providing venture capital finance for start-ups to offering SME expansion finance.  \n \nC.  \n\nGovernance Structure  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n\n \n24. \nThe  Fund  will  be  managed  by  BTS  Investment  Advisers  Ltd,  Zug,  Switzerland,  and  its \nIndian  subsidiary,  BTS  Investment  Advisors  Ltd.  The  Indian  subsidiary  operates  from  Mumbai \nand  will  carry  out  the  investment  activities  for  the  Fund.  The  Swiss  parent  company  will \nundertake investor relations, fund raising, and supervision tasks.  \n \nThe  Fund  manager  (i)  identifies  potential  fund  investment  opportunities,  (ii) screens \n25. \ninvestment proposals by making a thorough appraisal of the feasibility and risks, (iii) supervises \nand monitors fund investments, (iv) disposes of the shares of companies invested at the time of \n\n \nA.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nexit,  and  (v)  undertakes  all  Fund  accounting,  compliance,  and  investor  reporting.  The  Fund \nmanager  will  be  contractually  bound  to  carry  out  its  responsibilities  according  to  the  Fund\u2019s \ninvestment policy. Please refer to section III-C for a detailed description of the Fund manager. \n \nTo encourage individual team members to select companies with the most promise for \n26. \nentrepreneurial growth, and to enhance the value of their investees, the team members earn a \ncarried interest, i.e., performance fee, if the return to investors exceeds 7% per year, after the \nvalue of their invested capital has been returned.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nINVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nJustification \n \n1. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n27. \ndevelopmental objectives: \n \n\nBy  providing  financing  for  this  transaction,  ADB  intends  to  achieve  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nMobilize  long-term  capital  in  the  form  of  private  equity  for  SMEs  in  India  to \nfinance expansion and productivity improvements. \n\nDiversify  the  sources  of  finance  available  to  SMEs  by  including  equity  finance, \nwhich  enables  SMEs  to  buy  fixed  assets  and  to  use  them  as  collateral  for \ncommercial bank loans to leverage their expansion. This dynamic process helps \nIndian SMEs to evolve into larger enterprises.  \n\nDemonstrate  to  the  private  sector  that  investments  in  entrepreneurial  SMEs  in \nIndia  can  be  commercially  attractive,  and  thus  catalyze  further  investments  by \ninvestments.  This \nbuilding  up \ndemonstration  effect  will  be  achieved  most  effectively  by  supporting  domestic \nprivate equity teams. \n\nto  manage  private  equity \n\nlocal  capacity \n\n(iv) \n\nProvide management advice to SMEs  in financial planning, business expansion \nstrategies,  human  resource  development,  and  implementation  of  international \nstandards of corporate governance. \n\n(v) \n\nCreate sustainable employment in India vis-\u00e0-vis the Fund\u2019s investee companies. \n\n(vi) \n\nStimulate private sector development to serve as a vehicle for the country\u2019s long-\nterm economic growth and stability. \n\n(vii)  Contribute  to  the  development  of  a  well  functioning  regulatory  and  legal \nenvironment in India. The Fund will be required to collect consistent information \non  regulatory  issues  that  their  SME  portfolio  companies  encounter.  This \ninformation will be reported on a regular basis to the South Asia Department to \nsupport  the  formulation  of  a  conducive  regulatory  framework  for  expanding \nSMEs.     \n\n \n\n \nA. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  7\n\n2. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\nCatalytic and demonstration effect.  Given the significant risks and challenges \nfacing  potential  investors,  ADB  will  serve  a  catalytic  role  in  attracting  additional \nlocal and foreign long-term private investments to India. ADB will demonstrate by \nits intervention the credibility of SME equity finance in India and mobilize capital \nto support other private equity funds. This Fund is particularly well positioned to \nachieve  a  demonstration  effect  as  local  financial  institutions  are  expected  to \ninvest alongside international investors.  \n\nPrivate  sector  development.  The  Fund,  similar  to  others  in  which  PSOD \ninvests, will make a direct contribution to private sector development. The Fund, \nwith a portion of its funding coming from private institutional investors, will employ \nmarket-based  mechanisms  to  develop  profitable  and  sustainable  enterprises. \nADB\u2019s  contribution  to  this  type  of  initiative  helps  its  DMCs  to  implement  their \nrespective country specific private sector development strategies.  \n\n(iii) \n\nValue  added  by  Fund  manager.  ADB  will  support  domestic  teams  providing \nhands-on management advice to SMEs in financial planning, business expansion \nstrategies,  human  resource  development,  and  implementation  of  international \nstandards of corporate governance.  \n\nMeasuring Development Effectiveness \n\n \n28. \nADB  has  undertaken  to  develop  an  appropriate  investment  strategy,  which  includes  a \nportfolio  approach  to  its  investment  fund  operations.  This  strategy  makes  a  case  for  the \nrelevance  and  impact  of  ADB\u2019s  private  equity  investments  and  describes  the  intended \nrefinement  of  the  approach  through  products  tailored  to  the  specific  needs  of  the  beneficiary \ncountries.   \n \nB. \n \n29. \nPSOD and the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) are formulating guidelines for \nimplementing  the  Good  Practice  Standards  (GPS)  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment \nOperations,  which  were  prepared  by  the  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group6  of  the  multilateral \ndevelopment banks. These GPS cover the roles of the independent evaluation department and \nthe private sector department itself, the evaluation dimensions for private sector operations, the \nnature of annual reporting, and dissemination of reports and lessons. According to the GPS, the \nthree  principal  dimensions  for  private  sector  evaluation  are  development  outcome,  investment \nprofitability  for  the  institution,  and  operational  effectiveness.  PSOD  will  measure  the  expected \ndevelopment  outcome  of  this  Fund  at  the  Fund  and  sub-project  levels  as  well  as  beyond  the \nFund  by  monitoring  certain  performance  measures  throughout  the  life  of  the  Fund.  The \nperformance measures are grouped into three key areas:  \n\n(i) \n\nBusiness  performance.  The  extent  to  which  the  Fund  has  reached  its \nobjectives in terms of the overall profitability and commercial viability of the Fund \nand subprojects. \n\n                                                 \n \n6 The Evaluation Cooperation Group was formed by the multilateral development banks to design common evaluation \nstandards for private sector operations. The group\u2019s work is ongoing and some aspects of the present evaluation \nframework might change to correspond to best practices. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nEconomic sustainability. The effects of the Fund and subprojects on the DMC\u2019s \neconomy,  and  the  associated  benefits  and  costs.

There are no legal \nor regulatory differences between venture capital and private equity firms. The Government first \npermitted  financial  institutions  (Industrial  Development  Bank  of  India,  ICICI,  and  IFCI), \ncommercial banks (including foreign banks), and subsidiaries of commercial banks to establish \nventure  capital  companies  under  guidelines  issued  in  1988.  In  addition,  under  current  central \nbank  regulations,  banks\u2019  investments  in  mutual  funds  catering  to  venture  capital  funding  are \nconsidered to be outside the ceilings applicable to banks\u2019 investments in corporate equity and \ndebt. \n \n2. \nForeign venture capital funds have been permitted to operate in India since 1995. They \nmay either  hold the shares of unlisted Indian companies directly (up to a maximum of 25%  of \nequity)  or  route  their  investments  through  domestic  venture  capital  funds  and  companies. \nBefore  guidelines  were  issued  in  September  2000,  direct  exposure  by  offshore  private  equity \nfunds in shares of unlisted companies was treated as a foreign direct investment and had to be \napproved in line with the Government\u2019s general policy on foreign investments. Indocean Venture \nFund (now Indocean Chase), originally set up by George Soros and Chemical Bank in October \n1994, was the first such overseas private equity fund. \n \n3. \nThe regulatory environment for the private equity industry was simplified in 1995\u20132000. \nForeign institutional investors participated in the growth of the private equity industry through the \nforeign  direct  investment  regulations  of  the  Government  and  the  simplified  tax  administration \nprocedures under the Indo-Mauritius Double Taxation Avoidance Treaty. While the foreign direct \ninvestment  route  offered  minimum  investment  restrictions  for  private  equity  funds,  exit  pricing \nand  repatriation  of  capital  were  regulated  by  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI).  To  bring  these \ncapital  flows  under  the  regulation  of  the  venture  capital  industry,  new  SEBI  regulations  were \nissued with simplified exit pricing and repatriation procedures for foreign investors.  \n \n4. \nFollowing amendments to the 2000 budget, the Government has allowed private equity \nfunds \u201cpass-through\u201d status, meaning that the distributed or undistributed income of the funds is \nnot  taxed.  To  avoid  double  taxation,  the  income  of  a  private  equity  fund  is  taxed  only  in  the \nhands of the investor. \n \nSEBI was also made the sole regulatory authority, and private equity funds must submit \n5. \nquarterly  reports  to  it.  In  September  2000  SEBI  announced  the  guidelines  that  now  govern \nventure  capital \nthe \nChandrashekhar committee on venture capital. After another set of amendments in April 2004, \nthe following rules now apply: \n \n\ninvestment,  based  on \n\nrecommendations  of \n\nthe  January  2000 \n\nForeign venture capital investors can invest in India without the need for approval \nfrom the Foreign Investment Promotion Board if they register with SEBI. \n\nEach  investor  in  a  venture  fund  must  invest  at  least  Rs500,000,  and  each  fund \nmust have at least Rs50 million in capital. \n\nA  fund  may  invest  in  one  company  up  to  25%  of  the  fund\u2019s  capital.  It  cannot \ninvest in associated companies of ventures that it finances. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n  Appendix 1   \n\n \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nA  fund  must  invest  66.67%  (lowered  from  75%  in  April  2004)  of  its  investible \nfunds  in  unlisted  equity  or  equity-linked  instruments.  The  remaining  33.3%  can \nbe  invested  in  subscriptions  to  initial  public  offerings  (IPOs)  of  companies  or  in \ndebt instruments of a  company in which the  venture fund has already  made an \nequity investment. \n\nThe April 2004 amendments removed the previous 1-year lockup period for IPO \nsubscriptions.  They  also  allowed  investments  within  the  33.3%  category  in \npreferential allotments of equity shares of a listed company, subject to a 1-year \nlock-in, and in equity shares or equity-linked instruments of a listed company that \nis financially weak. \n\nThe removal of the profitability criterion as a listing requirement had an important \neffect  on  the  private  equity  industry  as  it  provided  an  exit  mechanism  for \ninvestors. To replace the profitability requirement, a firm would be delisted if it did \nnot earn a profit within 3 years of listing. \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  acquisition  of  shares  in  a  venture  fund  by  the  investee  company  or  its \npromoters is exempt from the provisions of the takeover code and will therefore \nnot mandate an open offer. \n\n(viii)  Mutual funds may invest 5% of the capital of an open-ended scheme and 10% of \n\nthe capital of a closed-ended scheme in a venture fund. \n\n(ix) \n\nIn  April  2004  the  SEBI  also  removed  some  previous  restrictions  and  allowed \nventure funds to invest in real estate companies, gold financing companies, and \nequipment leasing and hire-purchase companies registered with the RBI. \n\n \nThese  regulations  have  significantly  improved  the  regulatory  environment  for  private \n6. \nequity funds operating in India, such as BTS India Private Equity Fund. In addition, they reflect \nthe  strong  commitment  of  the  Indian  Government  to  support  the  provision  of  long-term  equity \nfinance to domestic entrepreneurial companies.1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n \nSource:  Dossani,  Rafiq,  and  Martin  Kenney.  2002.
