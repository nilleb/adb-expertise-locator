I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment in BTS India Private Equity Fund (the Fund) of up to $15 million or 25% of the \nFund\u2019s total share capital, whichever is less. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: BACKGROUND, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \nA.  Background \n \n2.  The Indian economy has been growing at an average rate of 6% per year since the 1991 \nlaunch of economic reforms and liberalization of trade and investment. While agriculture has \ntraditionally been India\u2019s largest economic sub-sector, the past decade has seen the services \nsector emerge as the largest component of gross domestic product (GDP). According to recent \nresearch,  the  main  factors  underlying  India\u2019s  long-term  growth  are  rationalization  of  the \ndomestic economy (i.e., improving total productivity) and, more recently, exports of information \ntechnology and information technology\u2013enabled services.1  \n \n3.  Over the last 10 years, the Indian Government has introduced wide-ranging changes to \naccelerate economic growth and integrate the Indian economy with the rest of the world. These \nreforms have primarily minimized or reduced the role of government in industry and trade, and \nimproved the competitiveness of Indian industry.  \n \n4.  Some of the key governmental measures have been: \n \n(i)  Simplifying  the  process  of  setting  up  businesses.  In  particular,  the  business \nlicensing requirement has been abolished for most industries.  \n(ii)  Rationalizing the tax regime, including lowering tariff barriers, reducing marginal \ntax rates, and simplifying tax procedures. \n(iii)  Simplifying the trade regime and achieving full convertibility of the rupee.  \n(iv)  Improving  the  overall  investment  climate  by  liberalizing  many  restrictions  on \ninvestment, including some major limitations on foreign investment, deregulating \ninterest rates, and opening up the insurance sector to private sector participation. \n(v)  Developing  the  infrastructure  sector  by  encouraging  private  participation  in \npower, telecom, ports, and roads, and reforming the power sector to improve \nefficiencies. \n(vi)  Reducing the role of government in industry and introducing a program to make \nprices in the petroleum sector market-driven. \n(vii)  Implementing labor reforms, including amendments to the Industrial Disputes Act \nallowing  easier  closure  and  layoffs  of  workers  in  economically  unviable \ncompanies,  to  encourage  companies  to  hire  employees  more  quickly,  and \nchanges in the wage ceilings set in the Payment and Wages Act. \n \n                                                 \n \n1 Morgan Stanley. 2004. India and China: A Special Economic Analysis. Hong Kong, China. \n ", "2         \n5.  Despite these positive changes, which will ultimately support the development of a \nsustainable private equity industry, much more effort must go into reform to facilitate private \nsector development and sustainable economic growth. \n \n1.  Indian Private Equity Industry \n \n6.  The private equity industry in India is more than 15 years old. The first venture capital \nfund, TDICI Ltd. (now known as ICICI), was established in 1988. \n \n7.  In India today, many funds that have been set up in the last 6 years are focused on \ninformation technology (IT). In contrast, the portfolio of more established funds shows a broad \nexposure to a variety of commercial sectors and stages of investment including investments in \nearly-stage companies. The portfolio performance of many of the IT-focused funds has, with few \nexceptions, mimicked the dismal performance of similar portfolios globally. Many institutional \ninvestors that invested in such funds in the late 1990s therefore became wary of any potential \ninvestment management entity that called itself a \u201cventure capital\u201d or \u201cprivate equity\u201d fund, \nresulting in a drop in assets managed by these entities. However, the funds that built a more \ndiverse portfolio have tended to perform better and demonstrated a number of successful exits \nthrough trade sales and initial public offerings (IPOs). \n \n8.  In 2004, funds broadened their interest to a range of sectors including manufacturing, \nhealth  care,  banking  and  financial  services,  pharmaceuticals,  engineering,  textiles,  and \ntelecommunications technology. The thriving market for business process outsourcing services \ncontinued to be a favorite.2\n \n9.  The current Indian private equity industry can be categorized into four distinct market \nsegments: (i) top-end funds investing in large capital transactions (e.g., Warburg Pincus and \nGeneral  Atlantic  Partners  [GAP]);  (ii)  funds  managed  by  investment  banks,  with  a  rather \npassive, transactional investment approach (e.g., Chrys, Westbridge, and View); (iii) smaller \nlocal players exploiting a specific market niche like SME finance (e.g., Jumpstart, Andhara, \nIL&FS, and BTS India Investment Advisors [BTS India]); and (iv) locally entrenched, traditional \nprivate equity funds focusing on expansion capital (e.g., CVC, Actis, Barings, and ICICI). The \nIndian private equity industry still has few syndicated investments and limited competition in the \nSME finance segment. ADB has recently invested in Baring India Private Equity Fund, which \ntargets larger transactions and is therefore complementary to BTS India, which operates in the \nSME finance niche.  \n \n10.  Successful exits in recent years and good returns by diversified funds have led to a \nslight  change  in  thinking  among  many  Indian  banks,  financial  institutions,  and  insurance \ncompanies. With their relatively robust returns, these funds and investment teams look more \nattractive to domestic institutional investors. As interest rates have fallen precipitously, asset \nmanagers  have  had  to  start  looking  at  private  equity  as  an  alternative  asset  class  for \ninvestments.  \n \n11.  While many investors have allocated more to private equity as an alternative asset class, \nprivate equity is still underinvested because not enough fund managers have the experience \nand financial backing needed to ensure sustainable operations. As a result, the private equity \n                                                 \n \n2 Economist Intelligence Unit. 2005. Country Finance: India.

Challenges and Opportunities \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n \n12.  Entrepreneurial  opportunities  are  likely  to  abound  in  India  in  the  next  few  years \n(Figure 1)  because  of  expected  sustained  growth;  a  large  and  growing  pool  of  qualified \nengineers, scientists, managers, and technicians, many returning from industrialized countries;4 \nand a growing middle class with substantial purchasing power. In addition, inflation is likely to \nremain at managed levels, although federal and state budgetary deficits must be controlled. The \nconsumer market counts 50 million households (more than 200 million people) with a yearly \nincome in excess of $1,000. The country has the second-largest English-speaking population in \nthe world and a technical employment base of 4.1 million. This pool is augmented yearly \nthrough an excellent tertiary education system. Leading corporations like Citibank, General \nElectric, and Unilever are extensively staffed by Indian expatriate staff recruited and trained in \nIndia.  \n \n13.  As a result of these factors, the pool of SMEs with growth potential has significantly \nincreased in India. To take advantage of these opportunities, SMEs need diverse sources of \nfinance  for  expansion.  ADB\u2019s  assessment  of  India\u2019s  private  sector  leads  it  to  recommend \nproviding assistance to increase the variety of financing instruments that are accessible to \nprivate  firms.5  In  particular,  SMEs  require  long-term  finance  for  capital  expenditure  and \nexpansion projects. \n \nFigure 1: Entrepreneurial Activity by Region\nDeveloping Asia\nLatin America\nWestern Europe\nUnited States\nEastern Europe\n0 5 10 15 20 25\nPersons per 100 adults, 18-64 yrs. old \n(95% Confidence Interval)\nNote: \u201cDeveloping Asia\u201d includes PRC, India, Thailand, and Korea.   \nSource: Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, 2002 Executive Report. \n                                                 \n \n3 The private equity investment rate as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2003 was 0.59% in Singapore, \n0.47% in the Republic of Korea, and 0.14% in India.

However, there is still a gap in long-term finance in India because most SMEs are set up \nby professionals with limited personal resources to meet growth capital requirements, and most \nSMEs tend to operate at high gearing levels, limiting their ability to raise fresh debt. Although \ndebt is available at competitive rates, commercial banks will not lend without comprehensive \ncollateral coverage, which is not available to SME entrepreneurs.  \n \n15.  The Government in India has recognized the beneficial role of the private equity industry \nin spurring economic development and its ability to promote high value-added employment, and \nhas  therefore  started  to  improve  the  regulatory  environment.  In  1999  a  number  of  new \nregulations were issued and later enhanced. Appendix 1 reviews the Government\u2019s recent \nmeasures to foster private equity investments.  \n \n16.  The lessons learned from its long experience in investment fund operations will guide \nADB  in  taking  advantage  of  opportunities  in  entrepreneurial  finance  and  supporting  the \ndevelopment of the Indian private equity industry, while addressing its challenges. \n  \n17.  In conclusion, a large and growing pool of entrepreneurial SMEs in India have great \npotential  for  expansion.  These  SMEs\u2019  demand  for  long-term  equity  finance  is  not  met  by \ntraditional financial institutions, and the private equity investment rate still has a long way to go \nto reach the levels achieved in the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Taipei,China. This gap \nprovides an opportunity for ADB to stimulate the diversification of the financial sector in India by \nsupporting a domestic private equity team with an excellent track record in the niche of SME \nequity finance, and to mobilize funds from institutional investors by actively participating in the \nFund\u2019s structuring and supervision.    \n \n \n ", "    5\n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED FUND \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \nA.   Objectives and Description  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n18.  ADB proposes to make an equity investment in the Fund of up to $15 million or 25% of \nthe Fund\u2019s total share capital, whichever is less. ADB will not be the largest investor in the Fund.  \n \n19.  The primary objective of the Fund will be to achieve medium- to long-term capital gains \nby primarily investing through equity or equity-related instruments in high-growth SMEs in India. \nThe investment size will range from $3 million to $6 million.  \n \nB.   Sponsor and Co-investors \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n \n20.  BTS Investment Advisors Limited will be the investment adviser of the Fund (the Fund \nmanager). BTS Investment Advisors is also the investment adviser of Swiss Technology Fund \n(Swiss Tec), a $22 million fund established in 1998 to invest in Indian SMEs. BTS Investment \nAdvisors in Mumbai, an Indian subsidiary of the Fund manager, will carry out the investments \nfor the Fund. BTS Investment Advisors in Zug, Switzerland, will undertake investor relations, \nfund raising, and supervision tasks, but the investment activity will be undertaken in Mumbai.  \n \n21.  BTS Group is a financial services provider for the Indian subcontinent. It advises foreign \nclients on investing in the Indian markets as well as Indian companies expanding outside India. \nBTS Group is owned by the Guggenb\u00fchl-Even family and Volkart Holding AG, which has been \nactive in India for more than 150 years.  \n \n22.  BTS Investment Advisors has four investment professionals in Mumbai\u2014A. K. Srinivas, \nPramod Shedde, Suneet Gupta, and Bharat Dighe, who collectively have more than 50 years\u2019 \nprivate equity investment experience in India. The managing partner, Alastair Guggenb\u00fchl, has \nbeen involved with Indian private equity investments for 5 years, but in an oversight capacity.  \n \n23.  The investment team has established a good track record during volatile conditions in \nIndia since 1998, when the predecessor fund was incorporated. Since BTS Investment Advisors \ntook over its management in 2000, the fund has successfully changed its investment strategy \nfrom providing venture capital finance for start-ups to offering SME expansion finance.  \n \nC.   Governance Structure  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n24.  The Fund will be managed by BTS Investment Advisers Ltd, Zug, Switzerland, and its \nIndian subsidiary, BTS Investment Advisors Ltd. The Indian subsidiary operates from Mumbai \nand  will  carry  out  the  investment  activities  for  the  Fund.  The  Swiss  parent  company  will \nundertake investor relations, fund raising, and supervision tasks.  \n \n25.  The  Fund  manager  (i)  identifies  potential  fund  investment  opportunities,  (ii) screens \ninvestment proposals by making a thorough appraisal of the feasibility and risks, (iii) supervises \nand monitors fund investments, (iv) disposes of the shares of companies invested at the time of \n ", "6         \nexit, and (v) undertakes all Fund accounting, compliance, and investor reporting. The Fund \nmanager will be contractually bound to carry out its responsibilities according to the Fund\u2019s \ninvestment policy. Please refer to section III-C for a detailed description of the Fund manager. \n \n26.  To encourage individual team members to select companies with the most promise for \nentrepreneurial growth, and to enhance the value of their investees, the team members earn a \ncarried interest, i.e., performance fee, if the return to investors exceeds 7% per year, after the \nvalue of their invested capital has been returned.  \n \nIV.  INVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Justification \n   \n1.  Development Impact \n27.  By  providing  financing  for  this  transaction,  ADB  intends  to  achieve  the  following \ndevelopmental objectives: \n \n(i)  Mobilize long-term capital in the form of private equity for SMEs in India to \nfinance expansion and productivity improvements. \n \n(ii)  Diversify the sources of finance available to SMEs by including equity finance, \nwhich  enables  SMEs  to  buy  fixed  assets  and  to  use  them  as  collateral  for \ncommercial bank loans to leverage their expansion. This dynamic process helps \nIndian SMEs to evolve into larger enterprises.  \n \n(iii)  Demonstrate to the private sector that investments in entrepreneurial SMEs in \nIndia can be commercially attractive, and thus catalyze further investments by \nbuilding  up  local  capacity  to  manage  private  equity  investments.  This \ndemonstration effect will be achieved most effectively by supporting domestic \nprivate equity teams. \n \n(iv)  Provide management advice to SMEs in financial planning, business expansion \nstrategies, human resource development, and implementation of international \nstandards of corporate governance. \n \n(v)  Create sustainable employment in India vis-\u00e0-vis the Fund\u2019s investee companies. \n \n(vi)  Stimulate private sector development to serve as a vehicle for the country\u2019s long-\nterm economic growth and stability. \n \n(vii)  Contribute  to  the  development  of  a  well  functioning  regulatory  and  legal \nenvironment in India. The Fund will be required to collect consistent information \non  regulatory  issues  that  their  SME  portfolio  companies  encounter.  This \ninformation will be reported on a regular basis to the South Asia Department to \nsupport  the  formulation  of  a  conducive  regulatory  framework  for  expanding \nSMEs.     \n \n \n \n ", "    7\n2.  Value Added by ADB \n \n(i)  Catalytic and demonstration effect.  Given the significant risks and challenges \nfacing potential investors, ADB will serve a catalytic role in attracting additional \nlocal and foreign long-term private investments to India. ADB will demonstrate by \nits intervention the credibility of SME equity finance in India and mobilize capital \nto support other private equity funds. This Fund is particularly well positioned to \nachieve a demonstration effect as local financial institutions are expected to \ninvest alongside international investors.  \n \n(ii)  Private  sector  development.  The  Fund,  similar  to  others  in  which  PSOD \ninvests, will make a direct contribution to private sector development. The Fund, \nwith a portion of its funding coming from private institutional investors, will employ \nmarket-based  mechanisms  to  develop  profitable  and  sustainable  enterprises. \nADB\u2019s contribution to this type of initiative helps its DMCs to implement their \nrespective country specific private sector development strategies.  \n \n(iii)  Value added by Fund manager. ADB will support domestic teams providing \nhands-on management advice to SMEs in financial planning, business expansion \nstrategies, human resource development, and implementation of international \nstandards of corporate governance.  \n \n28.  ADB has undertaken to develop an appropriate investment strategy, which includes a \nportfolio  approach  to  its  investment  fund  operations.  This  strategy  makes  a  case  for  the \nrelevance  and  impact  of  ADB\u2019s  private  equity  investments  and  describes  the  intended \nrefinement of the approach through products tailored to the specific needs of the beneficiary \ncountries.   \n \nB.  Measuring Development Effectiveness \n \n29.  PSOD and the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) are formulating guidelines for \nimplementing the Good Practice Standards (GPS) for Evaluation of Private Sector Investment \nOperations, which were prepared by the Evaluation Cooperation Group6 of the multilateral \ndevelopment banks. These GPS cover the roles of the independent evaluation department and \nthe private sector department itself, the evaluation dimensions for private sector operations, the \nnature of annual reporting, and dissemination of reports and lessons. According to the GPS, the \nthree principal dimensions for private sector evaluation are development outcome, investment \nprofitability for the institution, and operational effectiveness. PSOD will measure the expected \ndevelopment outcome of this Fund at the Fund and sub-project levels as well as beyond the \nFund  by  monitoring  certain  performance  measures  throughout  the  life  of  the  Fund.  The \nperformance measures are grouped into three key areas:  \n(i)  Business  performance.  The  extent  to  which  the  Fund  has  reached  its \nobjectives in terms of the overall profitability and commercial viability of the Fund \nand subprojects. \n \n                                                 \n \n6 The Evaluation Cooperation Group was formed by the multilateral development banks to design common evaluation \nstandards for private sector operations. The group\u2019s work is ongoing and some aspects of the present evaluation \nframework might change to correspond to best practices. \n ", "8         \n(ii)  Economic sustainability. The effects of the Fund and subprojects on the DMC\u2019s \neconomy,  and  the  associated  benefits  and  costs.  On  the  one  hand,  these \nmeasures  assess  the  extent  to  which  the  Fund  improved  the  allocation  of \nresources and provision of financial services to viable private enterprises. On the \nother hand, these measures evaluate whether the subprojects directly generated \npositive effects on the local economy.  \n \n(iii)  Private  sector  development.  The  impact  of  the  Fund  on  private  sector \ndevelopment beyond the Fund itself and its immediate stakeholders, e.g., the \nFund\u2019s contribution to the growth of viable financial institutions and financial \nmarkets development. \n \n30.  Quantitative  and  qualitative  measures  of  performance  are  outlined  below  and \nsummarized in Appendix 7.  \n \n(i)  Business performance (Fund) \n \nOverall profitability of the Fund: gross and net IRR. \n \n(ii)  Economic sustainability (subprojects) \n \n(a)  Efficient  allocation  of  finance  and  provision  of  financial  services  to \neconomically viable enterprises. \n \n(i)  Sub-project  economic  performance:  annual  net  profits  and \nrevenues of subprojects. \n \n(ii)  Stronger  local  entrepreneurship:  (a)  number  of  entrepreneurial \nprojects  receiving  finance  from  the  Fund,  and  (b)  number  of \nreturning  entrepreneurs  and  skilled  workers  from  industrialized \ncountries receiving finance and transferring skills. \n \n(iii)  Contribution to widening the access to finance of SMEs: additional \ndebt raised by subprojects as a result of the equity investments. \n \n(iv)  Provision of value-added services enhancing the viability of SMEs: \n(a) number of enterprises advised, and (b) quality of advice in \nfinancial  planning,  expansion  strategies,  human  resource \ndevelopment, accounting standards, corporate governance, and \nmanagement training. \n \n(b)  Direct  contribution  of  subprojects  to  the  local  economy  and  living \nstandards. \n \n(i)  Contribution to government revenues: increased amount of taxes \npaid by subprojects. \n \n(ii)  Employment  generated:  (a)  number  of  jobs  created  by \nsubprojects, and (b) quality of jobs created by subprojects (e.g., \ntechnical jobs). \n \n ", "    9\n(iii)  Adoption  of  new  technologies  and  production  processes: \n(a) increased  investment  in  new  technologies  or  improved \nproduction  processes  by  subprojects,  and  (b)  number  of \nsubprojects implementing successful new technologies. \n \n(iii)  Private sector development (impact beyond the Fund and subprojects) \n \n(i)  New  technology,  development  of  management  skills,  and \nemployee training in domestic financial sector: (a) number of local \ninvestment  professionals  in  SME  private  equity  trained  by  the \nFund,  and  (b)  number  of  the  Fund\u2019s  investment  professionals \nraising a subsequent fund in a DMC. \n \n(ii)  Resource mobilization through private equity: (a) domestic finance \nfor  investments  in  SMEs  mobilized  by  the  Fund,  and \n(b) international finance for investments in SMEs mobilized by the \nFund.  \n \n(iii)  Positive  effect  on  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  and  its \nadministration: (a) quality and volume of the Fund\u2019s feedback to \nADB  on  improvements  in  the  regulatory  environment,  and \n(b) evidence  of  lobbying  by  the  Fund  for  improvements  in  the \nregulatory framework. \n \n(iv)  Growth  in  financial  services  in  the  domestic  financial  markets: \n(a) growth in the private equity market in the domestic financial \nsector, and (b) increased access to long-term finance.7 \n \nC.   Environmental Protection and Social Safeguard Guidelines \n \n31.  The  Fund  is  classified  as  category  FI  (Financial  Intermediary)  and  no  significant \nenvironmental impact is anticipated. The Project\u2019s impact on indigenous peoples has been \nclassified as C (no impact). All companies in which the Fund invests will (i) comply with national \nenvironmental laws, regulations, and standards; or (ii) agree to adopt a program to comply with \nsuch standards; or (iii) as soon as possible, reasonably mitigate any noncompliance with such \nstandards. All companies in which the Fund invests will also comply with ADB\u2019s environmental \nand  social  safeguard  policies,  including  policies  relating  to  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous people. The Fund will also comply with policies against money laundering and \nfinancing of terrorism. \n \n32.  The implementation of an environmental management system, which includes ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental and social safeguards, represents an essential value addition by ADB to this \nprivate equity fund. Close coordination with ADB will be necessary to ensure that the Fund \nmanager possesses the skills to screen and categorize prospective investments on the basis of \nenvironmental and social impact. . The Fund will ensure that at least one of its employees has \nreceived environmental training and training in application of ADB's social safeguard policies. \nThe Fund manager will appoint a senior officer to implement and supervise the environmental \n                                                 \n \n7 Growth in financial services in the domestic financial markets will be measured at the level of the whole economy, \nnot at the level of the Fund. \n ", "10        \nand social management system, and an environmental coordinator to review compliance by \ninvestee companies with all applicable ADB policies. The Fund has developed an environmental \nmanagement  system  satisfactory  to  ADB  and  is  committed  to  its  implementation.  The \nenvironmental management system might be adapted to accommodate bilateral investors, in \nwhich case it will first be submitted to ADB\u2019s Environment and Social Safeguards Division for \napproval.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued its Regulations for Venture \nCapital in 1996, thus establishing the agency\u2019s authority over the funds, the limits on their \nactivities, and incentives for them to finance and rescue troubled companies. There are no legal \nor regulatory differences between venture capital and private equity firms. The Government first \npermitted  financial  institutions  (Industrial  Development  Bank  of  India,  ICICI,  and  IFCI), \ncommercial banks (including foreign banks), and subsidiaries of commercial banks to establish \nventure capital companies under guidelines issued in 1988. In addition, under current central \nbank regulations, banks\u2019 investments in mutual funds catering to venture capital funding are \nconsidered to be outside the ceilings applicable to banks\u2019 investments in corporate equity and \ndebt. \n \n2.  Foreign venture capital funds have been permitted to operate in India since 1995. They \nmay either hold the shares of unlisted Indian companies directly (up to a maximum of 25% of \nequity)  or  route  their  investments  through  domestic  venture  capital  funds  and  companies. \nBefore guidelines were issued in September 2000, direct exposure by offshore private equity \nfunds in shares of unlisted companies was treated as a foreign direct investment and had to be \napproved in line with the Government\u2019s general policy on foreign investments. Indocean Venture \nFund (now Indocean Chase), originally set up by George Soros and Chemical Bank in October \n1994, was the first such overseas private equity fund. \n \n3.  The regulatory environment for the private equity industry was simplified in 1995\u20132000. \nForeign institutional investors participated in the growth of the private equity industry through the \nforeign direct investment regulations of the Government and the simplified tax administration \nprocedures under the Indo-Mauritius Double Taxation Avoidance Treaty. While the foreign direct \ninvestment route offered minimum investment restrictions for private equity funds, exit pricing \nand repatriation of capital were regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). To bring these \ncapital flows under the regulation of the venture capital industry, new SEBI regulations were \nissued with simplified exit pricing and repatriation procedures for foreign investors.  \n \n4.  Following amendments to the 2000 budget, the Government has allowed private equity \nfunds \u201cpass-through\u201d status, meaning that the distributed or undistributed income of the funds is \nnot taxed. To avoid double taxation, the income of a private equity fund is taxed only in the \nhands of the investor. \n \n5.  SEBI was also made the sole regulatory authority, and private equity funds must submit \nquarterly reports to it. In September 2000 SEBI announced the guidelines that now govern \nventure  capital  investment,  based  on  the  January  2000  recommendations  of  the \nChandrashekhar committee on venture capital. After another set of amendments in April 2004, \nthe following rules now apply: \n \n(i)  Foreign venture capital investors can invest in India without the need for approval \nfrom the Foreign Investment Promotion Board if they register with SEBI. \n(ii)  Each investor in a venture fund must invest at least Rs500,000, and each fund \nmust have at least Rs50 million in capital. \n(iii)  A fund may invest in one company up to 25% of the fund\u2019s capital. It cannot \ninvest in associated companies of ventures that it finances. \n ", "12   Appendix 1      \n(iv)  A fund must invest 66.67% (lowered from 75% in April 2004) of its investible \nfunds in unlisted equity or equity-linked instruments. The remaining 33.3% can \nbe invested in subscriptions to initial public offerings (IPOs) of companies or in \ndebt instruments of a company in which the venture fund has already made an \nequity investment. \n(v)  The April 2004 amendments removed the previous 1-year lockup period for IPO \nsubscriptions.  They  also  allowed  investments  within  the  33.3%  category  in \npreferential allotments of equity shares of a listed company, subject to a 1-year \nlock-in, and in equity shares or equity-linked instruments of a listed company that \nis financially weak. \n(vi)  The removal of the profitability criterion as a listing requirement had an important \neffect  on  the  private  equity  industry  as  it  provided  an  exit  mechanism  for \ninvestors. To replace the profitability requirement, a firm would be delisted if it did \nnot earn a profit within 3 years of listing. \n(vii)  The acquisition of shares in a venture fund by the investee company or its \npromoters is exempt from the provisions of the takeover code and will therefore \nnot mandate an open offer. \n(viii)  Mutual funds may invest 5% of the capital of an open-ended scheme and 10% of \nthe capital of a closed-ended scheme in a venture fund. \n(ix)  In April 2004 the SEBI also removed some previous restrictions and allowed \nventure funds to invest in real estate companies, gold financing companies, and \nequipment leasing and hire-purchase companies registered with the RBI. \n \n6.  These regulations have significantly improved the regulatory environment for private \nequity funds operating in India, such as BTS India Private Equity Fund. In addition, they reflect \nthe strong commitment of the Indian Government to support the provision of long-term equity \nfinance to domestic entrepreneurial companies.1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n Source: Dossani, Rafiq, and Martin Kenney. 2002.
