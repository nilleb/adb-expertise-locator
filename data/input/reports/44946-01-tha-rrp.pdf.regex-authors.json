I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Gulf JP NS Company Limited (JPNS) for the Nong Saeng Natural Gas Power Project up \nto $170,000,000 to be financed from the ordinary capital resources of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) without government guarantee. If approved, the project will constitute ADB\u2019s fifth \nprivate sector investment in Thailand. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  The Thai power sector is structured under a single-buyer model whereby the Electricity \nGenerating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the state utility, enables private sector participation in \nthe power generation sector while maintaining control over system planning, operation, and \npricing. EGAT owns and operates the largest share of Thailand\u2019s installed generation capacity \nand is the country\u2019s single wholesale purchaser of electricity and supplier (as transmission \nowner and operator) to the country\u2019s two state-owned electricity distribution authorities: the \nMetropolitan Electricity Authority and the Provincial Electricity Authority. \n \n3.  The government has opened access to private sector participation in the generation \nbusiness  through  three  public  \u2013  private  partnership  (PPP)  programs:  independent  power \nproducers (IPPs), small power producers, and very small power producers. The IPP and small \npower  producer  programs  allow  private  developers  to  construct,  own,  and  operate  power \nprojects and enter into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with EGAT with terms of up to 25 \nyears. The very small power producer program allows power producers with projects of 10 \nmegawatts (MW) or less to sell power to the Metropolitan Electricity Authority and the Provincial \nElectricity Authority. IPPs are large private power producers with generating capacity greater \nthan 90 MW that use commercial coal, natural gas, and heavy oil and sell their electricity to \nEGAT through PPAs. Thailand\u2019s IPP program was introduced in the early 1990s to promote \ncompetition, enhance generating efficiency, lower electricity prices, and reduce the financial \nburden on the Government of Thailand of expanding generation to meet rising demand. Since \nthe inception of the IPP program, its share of electricity generation supplying Thailand has \nsteadily increased \n \n4.  In accordance with the government\u2019s policy to promote private sector participation in the \npower sector, EGAT invited qualified generators in 2007 to participate in IPP bidding. This was \nthe second IPP bidding round since the program was initiated and the first IPP bidding round \nsince the Asian financial crisis.1 At the time, ADB was asked for financial assistance and \nexpressed to potential bidders interest in providing a guarantee that would help extend the tenor \nof IPP financial assistance.  \n \n5.  In 2008, the financial crisis triggered by subprime mortgage lending in the United States \nspiraled into a global economic crisis. Thailand reduced its economic growth forecasts as power \ndemand declined significantly. Accordingly, the recently awarded IPP projects were postponed, \n                                                \n1  In the first IPP bidding round, ADB provided assistance to BLCP Power Limited (ADB. 2003. Report and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans and a Proposed Political Risk \nGuarantee to BLCP Power Limited. Manila). The project was a 1,434 MW coal-fired power plant in Rayong \nProvince, 200 kilometers southeast of Bangkok. The plant was completed ahead of schedule on 1 February 2007 \nand generates electricity at one of the lowest costs in Thailand.   \n ", "2  \nas the capacity and willingness of banks around the world to supply credit tightened. Thailand \nsimultaneously  experienced  political  demonstrations  that  added  to  economic  uncertainty. \nDespite these factors, the Thai economy demonstrated remarkable signs of recovery in 2010, \nwith power demand in the first 7 months of 2010 more than 10% higher than in the same period \nof 2009. The latest demand forecast indicates that Thailand must promptly bring new capacity \nonline to avoid an impending supply as the reserve margin is expected to reach a critical level \nby 2019.2   \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n2.  The Borrower and Sponsor \n6.  The  project  will  be  developed  and  operated  by  JPNS,  a  special-purpose  vehicle \nincorporated in Thailand. JPNS is a subsidiary of Gulf JP, which is 90% owned by JP Holdings \nThailand,  the  Thai  subsidiary  of  J-Power.  The  remaining  shares  are  held  by  Gulf  JP \nmanagement.3 \n \n7.  J-Power supplies electricity to 10 major electric power companies in Japan. It was \nestablished in 1952 as a special public corporation, was fully privatized in 2004, and is currently \nlisted on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Table 1 summarizes J-Power\u2019s financial and operational \nperformance in recent years. Reflecting the steady nature of its business, both revenues and \nincome remained relatively stable despite the financial crisis. J-Power\u2019s long-term credit rating is \nvery high (para.6).  \n \nTable 1: Summary of Financial and Operational Performance of Electric Power \nDevelopment Company (J-Power) \n \nItem  FY2007  FY2008  FY2009  FY2010 \nIncome          \nOperating revenues (\u00a5 million)   573,277    587,780   704,936   584,484  \nNet income (\u00a5 million)   35,167    29,311   19,457  29,148 \n \nBalance Sheet         \nTotal net assets (\u00a5 million)   462,654    468,118   382,112   414,981  \nTotal assets (\u00a5 million)  1,999,794   2,013,131   2,005,489  2,024,080  \nRatios         \nReturn on equity (%)  7.9  6.3  4.6  7.4 \nShareholders\u2019 equity ratio (%)  23.1  23.2  19.0  20.4 \nReturn on assets (%)  2.8  2.1  2.0  2.1 \nGenerating capacity (MW)   16,940    16,940   16,991   17,610  \n                   MW = megawatt. \n                   Source: Electric Power Development Company. \n \n8.

Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n9.  The project supports long-term, sustainable, and inclusive economic growth through the \nprovision  of  reliable,  low-cost,  and  efficient  base-load  power.  A  major  challenge  for  ADB \ndeveloping member countries such as Thailand is bringing significant new power generation \nonline to maintain economic growth. Underinvestment in the power sector reduces the integrity \nof  the  system,  making  it  more  prone  to  outages.  Supply  disruptions  are  costly  for  local \nbusinesses and discourage foreign direct investment. The project\u2019s timely addition of 1,600 MW \nof capacity will help Thailand maintain a reserve margin above the Ministry of Energy\u2019s critical \nthreshold of 15%. Low cost is important for making electricity accessible and affordable to \nreduce  poverty.  Low-cost  electricity  enhances  Thailand\u2019s  labor  productivity  and  global \ncompetiveness and expands livelihood opportunities. Further, energy projects that use natural \ngas and efficient combined-cycle technology are more sustainable than coal-fired projects, \nwhich is the only other IPP alternative for adding new domestic base-load capacity in Thailand. \n \n2.  Outcome \n10.  The outcome of the project is the provision of competitively-priced power generated from \ntechnically and financially stable gas-fired technology, which emits substantially less carbon \ndioxide than a coal-fired generation. Using natural gas with efficient combined-cycle technology6 \ncontributes to long-term sustainable growth. In addition, the project will provide environmental \nand social benefits. Compared with coal-fired generation, the only IPP alternative for domestic \nbase-load generation, the project will avoid 5.7 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per \nannum, as well as dust and ash waste. Cleaner air and a lower carbon footprint provide \nhealthier and more sustainable living conditions for the poor. Other socioeconomic benefits \ninclude employment creation and tax contributions. \n \n                                                \n5  Ownership share 1,023 MW. \n6  The project\u2019s net efficiency is 57.7%, using one of the industry\u2019s most efficient, commercially proven technologies.  \n ", "4  \n11.  The project reduces poverty by providing a significant amount of electricity at a low cost, \nwhich is essential for economic growth and human development.7 On average, the project will \ncontribute 11,845 gigawatt-hours of cleaner energy to the grid per annum by 2015. Modern \nforms of energy must be available, accessible, and affordable to communities, businesses, and \nhouseholds  to  reduce poverty and  set  development on an  inclusive  path.  Energy  can  be \nconsidered the missing Millennium Development Goal because it is a significant driver toward \nachieving the others.  \n \n3.  Outputs \n12.  The project outputs include the first PPP worth over $1 billion to reach financial close \nand the first IPP of over 1,000 MW to be brought online in Thailand since the global financial \ncrisis.  Both  are  important  signals  to  the  market  and  power  sector  that  will  demonstrate \nconfidence  in  the  country  as  it  recovers from the  economic  downturn and  recent political \ndisruptions. The financial close will be made possible through ADB and a bilateral co-lender, \nwhich will catalyze the long-term financing required for infrastructure development. The design \nand monitoring framework in Appendix 1 outlines the project\u2019s impact, outcome, and output \nindicators. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n13.  Capitalizing on ADB\u2019s core strength of financing infrastructure development, Strategy \n20208 sets forth that ADB will help expand the supply of energy; promote energy efficiency; \nsupport clean energy; and facilitate the removal of policy, institutional, regulatory, technological, \nand legal constraints on efficient energy use. Strategy 2020 aims to promote a larger role for the \nprivate sector in financing infrastructure development by supporting PPP. \n \n2.  Consistency with the Country Strategy \n14.  The central thrust of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Thailand, 2007\u201320119 is to \naddress  the  main  constraints  on  its  achieving  sustainable  economic  growth.  Ensuring  the \ndevelopment  of  infrastructure,  which  is  one  of  three  core  strategic  areas  of  the  country \npartnership  strategy,  will  ultimately  shape  the  magnitude,  direction,  and  sustainability  of \nThailand\u2019s future economic growth and development.  \n \n3.  Consistency with the Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations   \n15.  ADB\u2019s Energy Policy10 emphasizes investments in energy efficiency, least-cost supply, \nprivate sector participation, and wider access for the poor. ADB supports projects that use \nefficient technologies such as combined cycle, as well as projects that incorporate state-of-the-\nart  emission-control  equipment.  Natural gas  is preferred over  coal for providing  base-load \nelectricity.  \n \n                                                \n7  Nong Saeng submitted a very competitive international bid to secure a PPA with a capacity charge of $1.18 per \nkilowatt-hour (kWh) which covers the plant\u2019s fixed operation, maintenance, and capital costs, including debt service \nand equity return. \n8  ADB. 2008.

In 2003, ADB approved financing for the BLCP Power Project (footnote 1), a successful \nconventional power plant in Thailand under the IPP program. In 2009, an extended annual \nreview was conducted and found that the project had played an important role in securing \nreliable, least-cost power in Thailand, as one of the lowest-cost, highest-dispatch generators in \nthe sector, after hydropower imports from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. The project \nserves today as a model in Thailand for developing and implementing IPP projects sensitive to \nenvironment, safety, and community relation standards. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nD.
