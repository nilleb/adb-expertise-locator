Despite the \nprogress  made  in  agricultural  production  and  export  growth,  and \nin liberalizing commodity, land, and credit markets in recent years, \nrural  poverty  remains  high  and  the  level  of  private  sector \ninvestment  remains  low.  Growth  in  the  past  was  the  result  of \n(i) reliance on higher input use (labor, land, fertilizer, tractors, and \nirrigation);  (ii)  policy  reforms  in  land,  markets,  and  trade;  and \n(iii) high  public  investment,  mainly  in  irrigation  and  roads.  This \nstrategy  will  not  be  able  to  sustain  growth  in  the  future  because \n(i) the potential for expanding the rural labor force and land under \ncultivation  is  limited;  (ii)  new  investment  in  irrigation  exhibits \ndecreasing  marginal  returns  as  the  stock  of  irrigation  capital  is \nalready  very  high  and \nincreased  operation  and \nrequires \nmaintenance  rather  than  new  expansion;  and  (iii)  revenue  from \nrice  export  is  declining.  Viet  Nam  is  already  experiencing \noverproduction  of  rice,  coffee,  and  other  commodities  and \ndeclining  export  revenues  from  unprocessed  commodities.  As  a \nresult,  the  Government  is  paying  high  storage  costs  for  these \nunsold goods.  \n \nPolicy  makers  in  the  Government  are  interested  in  sustaining \ngrowth,  employment,  and  exports  in  agriculture  so  as  to  reduce \nrural  poverty  and  in  effecting  policy  reforms  for  commercial \nagriculture, \nforestry.  Policy \nreforms  in  the  development  and  use  of  technologies  through \nresearch  and  extension  and  improved  access  to  credit  by  small- \nand  medium-sized  enterprises \nto \n(i) increase  factor  productivity;  (ii)  improve  yields;  (iii)  foster \ndiversification  into  available  markets  for  higher  value  crops; \n(iv) improve the quality of products such as rice, coffee, livestock \nproducts,  fruits  and  vegetables  that  respond  to  and  meet  the \nrequirements  of  specific,  well-targeted  domestic  and  export \nmarkets;  (v)  increase  value-added  production;  and  (vi)  expand \nrural industries and services. With increased understanding of and \nresponsiveness  to  different  markets,  competitiveness  in  export \nmarkets  is expected  to  improve.  In  turn,  this is  expected  to  have \nbeneficial impacts on rural poverty by increasing employment and \nreducing indebtedness and sales of landholdings.  \n \n \n\nlivestock,  water  resources,  and \n\n(SMEs)  are  expected \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nthe  development  and  partially  closing \n\n \n \nThe Program has been designed to assist the Government address \nkey  agriculture  constraints  related  to  productivity,  profitability,  and \ncompetitiveness  with  emphasis  on  small  farmers  and  SMEs.  The \ngoals  are  to  increase  sustainable  agricultural  growth  and  rural \nemployment.  \n \nThe  Program  will  involve  (i)  restructuring  the  management  of \nresearch  and  extension,  (ii)  improving  market  intelligence,  and \n(iii) encouraging \nthe \nfinancing  gaps  of  agro-industry  SMEs  that  will  increase  their \ncompetitiveness  with  other  public  and  private  enterprises  in  the \nsector. Increasing the quality and funding of agricultural research \nand  extension  will  (i)  improve  crop  diversification  and  yields  of \nhigher  income  crops  with  market  opportunities,  (ii)  facilitate \nintegration  with  postharvest  systems  and  agroprocessing, \n(iii) improve  the  quality  of  production  with  market  potential,  and \n(iv)  increase  stakeholder  participation  in  extension  and  improved \ntechnology dissemination \n \nADB will provide a loan of $60 million equivalent from its Special \nFunds resources, with a term of 24 years, including a grace period \nof  8  years;  and  with  an  interest  charge  of  1%  per  annum  during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nThe loan will finance policy reforms and will be released in three \ntranches  over  3  years  from  April  2003  to  March  2006.  The  first \ntranche of $20 million equivalent will be available for release upon \nloan  effectiveness,  subject  to  full  compliance  with  first-tranche \nconditions.  The  second  tranche  of  $20  million  equivalent  will  be \nreleased approximately 18 months later after the Government has  \ncomplied with the second-tranche conditions. The third tranche of \n$20 million equivalent will be released within 36 months of the first \ntranche  after  Government  compliance  with  the  third-tranche \nconditions. \n \nThe  Government  has  agreed  to  use  the  local  currency  proceeds \nof the loan to support reforms in the agriculture sector. \n \nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD).  A \nprogram implementation unit has been established with a director \nand  a  deputy  director.  In  addition,  a  program  steering  committee \nhas been established with a vice minister as its chairman. \n \n \n \nA project loan will improve the availability of and access to funds \nfor private agro-industry SMEs which have largely been bypassed \nby the formal banking sector.  \n \n\nThe Program Loan \n \n \n\nObjectives \n\nComponents \nand Outputs \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nProgram Period \nand Tranching \n\nCounterpart \nFunds \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Project Loan \n \n \n\nObjectives \n\nExecuting  Agency \nand \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nto  SMEs \n\nThe  project  loan  will  provide  funds  for  medium-  and  long-term \nloans \nin  agro-industry.

Potential  businesses  cover  broad  categories  of \neconomic  activities  including  (i)  agricultural  input  producers  and \nfruits,  vegetables,  and  other \nsuppliers; \n(ii)  processors  of \nhorticultural  crops,  and  processors  of \nindustrial  crops; \n(iii) processors of fish and livestock products; (iv) services such as \nmechanization;  (v)  small-scale  manufacturers  producing  goods \nsuch  as  baskets  and  bags,  mats,  furniture,  woven  products;  and \n(vi) storage and marketing businesses. \n \nADB will provide a loan of $30 million equivalent from its Special \nFunds resources, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof  8  years;  and  with  an  interest  charge  of  1%  per  annum  during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n \nVietnam  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (VBARD). \nA project  implementation  unit  has  been  established  with  a  part-\ntime  director.  It  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  submitting  withdrawal \napplications  to  ADB;  (ii)  coordinating  and  consolidating  the \ninvestment  loan  reporting  requirements;  (iii)  undertaking  benefit \nmonitoring  and  evaluation;  (iv)  advertising  the  credit  line  and \nsupervising  its  implementation;  (v)  carrying  out  a  midterm  review \nand  evaluation;  and  (vi)  producing  progress  reports,  project \ncompletion  reports,  and  other  reports  as  may  reasonably  be \nrequired by ADB during implementation. \n \nThe proceeds of the program loan will be utilized to finance the full \nforeign  exchange  costs  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of \ngoods and services produced in and procured from ADB member \ncountries  (other  than  items  specified  in  the  negative  list  and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources). \nEligible items will be procured on the basis of normal commercial \npractices  for  procurement  by  the  private  sector  or  standard \nprocurement  practices  by  the  Government  or  its  representatives \nacceptable to ADB. Procurement under subloans by subborrowers \nof the project loan will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines for \nloans to development institutions and private SME subborrowers. \n \nThe  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Program  (ASDP)  will \naddress  policy \nimpeding  agriculture  sector \nperformance  and  have  socioeconomic,  poverty-related,  and \nineffective \nenvironmental \nresearch  and  extension  services  that  are  top-down  and  largely \ninaccessible  to  small  and  poor  farmers  and  nonfarm  rural \nhouseholds;  (ii)  unsatisfactory  performance,  staffing  problems, \nand  overlapping  functions  of  research  institutes  and  extension\n\nimpacts.

Given  the \nacceptability  and  urgency  of  the  reforms,  the  agreed-upon \ntimetable  for  implementation  is  considered  realistic.  The  positive \nresponse from all major stakeholders minimizes the risk of policy \nreversal.  There  is  a  major  risk  of  delays  in  implementation  and \nrelease  of  the  second  and  third  tranches.  The  Program  was \ndesigned in a highly consultative process to ensure that the views \nof  all  the  stakeholders  (the  Government,  farmers,  private  sector \nrepresentatives,  and  nongovernment  organizations)  were \nacknowledged,  and  agreement  was  reached  on  the  policy \npackage.  Multiple  stakeholders,  including  government,  mass \norganization,  and  private  sector  participation,  will  be  involved  in \nthe  program  steering  committee  and  in  provincial  extension \nadvisory  councils.  The  chosen  reforms  comprise  fewer  but \nessential  measures  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  priority  for  the \nsector  and  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  Viet  Nam.  The  program \nloan  will  be  released  in  three  tranches  about  18  months  apart. \nThis  will  allow  greater  dialogue  between  ADB  and \nthe \nGovernment,  allow  more  time  for  the  Government  to  implement \nthe  reforms,  and  enable  the  various  stakeholders  with  different \ninterests to develop a sense of ownership of the policies. Also, a \nsteering committee comprising senior staff from all the concerned \nministries and agencies has been established to oversee program \nimplementation and the policy reforms. \n \n\n \nRisks  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed loans \n\n1. \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Agriculture Sector Development Program.  \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n2. \nBy  most  measures  of  performance,  Viet  Nam  has  experienced  successful  economic \ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction  over  the  last  15  years  since  economic  reform  or  doi  moi  was \nintroduced in 1986. During the 1990s, gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average rate of \nabout 7.5% per year, and in 2002 was an estimated 5.7%.1 Agriculture accounts for about 22% \nof  GDP.  Per  capita  GDP  almost  doubled  during  the  last  decade,  and  the  ratio  of  domestic \nsavings  to  GDP  increased  by  2.5  times.  Capital  formation  also  almost  doubled  during  this \nperiod. The economic slowdown that started in 2000 and was accentuated after 11 September \n2001  has  dampened  GDP  growth  in  recent  years.  Foreign  direct  investment  has  slackened \nsince  its  peak  in  the  mid-1990s,  largely  due  to  perceptions  that  the  cost  of  doing  business  in \nViet  Nam  is  high  and  that  the  Government  is  not  willing  to  accelerate  economic  reforms. \nNevertheless,  macroeconomic  indicators  such  as  inflation,  fiscal  deficits,  current  account \ndeficits, and external debt are within manageable limits. \n \n3. \nThe incidence of poverty had been cut in half, from about 70% in 1990 to 37% in 2000. \nRural poverty was reduced from 66% in 1993 to 45% in 1998. There has also been significant \nimprovement in social indicators, with almost universal primary education access, and reduced \nincidence  of  infant  mortality,  under-five  mortality,  child  malnutrition,  and  maternal  mortality. \nHowever, there are major challenges in reducing poverty further. The incidence of rural poverty \nis much higher, and about 90% of the total poor population reside in rural areas. Poor villages \nand communes lack basic infrastructure and health facilities. Poverty incidence is higher in the \nnorthern areas (60%) and among ethnic minorities (75%).  \n \n4. \nAgricultural growth and rural poverty reduction have also been impressive over the last \ndecade.  Growth  in  agricultural  production  averaged  4-5%  per  annum,  and  the  value  of \nagricultural output (80% in the form of crops and livestock, with the remainder from forestry and \nfisheries)  grew  4.2%  per  year  (Appendix  1).  Agricultural  growth  was  among  the  highest  in  the \nworld  during  the  1990s,  comparable  with  that  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  This \ngrowth  was  mainly  due  to  market-oriented  reforms  that  recognized  the  farm  household  as  the \nkey  unit  of  production,  liberalized  land-use  rights,  and  liberalized  decision  making  on  the \npurchase  of  inputs  and  sale  of  outputs.  The  ratio  of  cultivatable  land  per  person  is  very  low, \nsuggesting  that  Viet  Nam  has  a  comparative  advantage  in  production  that  maximizes  value-\nadded  per  unit  of  land.  Agriculture  will  continue  to  grow  at  a  lower  rate  than  industry  and \nservices; thus, acceleration of employment in rural services and industry is essential to minimize \nwidening income disparities. Rice production (accounting for 60% of the cultivated area) grew at \n4.3%  during  the  1990s  due  to  increases  in  yield  and  cropping  intensity.  The  growth  in \nagricultural exports was also noteworthy. The value of agricultural exports grew at over 13% per \nyear  during  this  period,  and  is  currently  about  $4.4  billion  per  year,  more  than  60%  of \nagricultural  GDP.  Rice,  coffee,  rubber,  cashews,  tea,  pepper,  and  seafood  are  the  major \nagricultural export items. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Asian Development Outlook 2002 Update. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB)  contributed  to  sector  growth  in  the  1990s  and  the \n5. \nresultant reduction in rural poverty through the Agriculture Sector Program.2  This program had \nthree components: (i) market orientation and efficiency, (ii) rural financial intermediation, and (iii) \nland  tenure.  The  program  was  rated  as  successful  in  increasing  market  orientation  and \nincreasing rice production and exports, fertilizer imports; providing sustainable banking services \nto  farmers  including  the  poor;  and  increasing  the  issue  of  land  use  certificates  for  agricultural \nland  and  forestland.3  However,  there  remains  some  unfinished  business  in  terms  of  complete \nmarket liberalization, access to credit, and land use rights. These are discussed below. \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nProblem Analysis \n\n6. \nThe  past  agricultural  strategy  was  largely  successful  in  generating  and  sustaining  self-\nsufficiency in food, expanding exports, increasing rural employment, and reducing rural poverty. \nHowever,  the  strategy  is  no  longer  sufficient  to  ensure  future  sustained  agricultural  growth  in \nproductivity and poverty reduction, because of declining (i) returns to labor, (ii) rice demand and \nexports due to low quality, and (iii) returns to irrigation infrastructure where rice is the dominant \noutput. Also, growth in agriculture value-added declined from a high of 5.2% in 1999 to 2.3% in \n2001, and an estimated 2.1% in 2002.4  In contrast, industry and services experienced higher \nand  increasing  growth  rates  in  this  period.  Viet  Nam  has  been  a  successful  exporter  of  low-\nquality  rice  (e.g.,  high  quantity  of  broken  rice  to  Africa,  Indonesia,  and  Philippines),  coffee, \nrubber, cashew, tea, and black pepper. Viet Nam has not been successful in producing higher \nquality and higher priced agricultural commodities for export. As a result, while export volumes \nof  these  major  commodities  have  continued  to  rise  since  2000,  export  values  and  revenues \nhave fallen due to low prices for rice, coffee, and tea in international markets.5 This situation is \nexpected to continue in the medium term. Agricultural value-added per hectare (ha) is relatively \nhigh in Viet Nam by international standards (about $1,000/ha). However, the small  size of the \naverage farm (0.14 ha/capita) means that value-added per person is low ($140/person). A new \nstrategy  based  on  crop  diversification  and  growth  in  high-quality  and  high-value  products  is \nneeded. It will require shifting the focus from a primary commodity to a finished or intermediate \nproduct, and from production volume to quality value addition. \n \n7. \nThe  core  sector  problems  are  low  productivity  and  profitability,  lack  of  production \ndiversity, low quality, and low competitiveness of the agricultural system. The causes of these \nproblems  include  (i)  low  agricultural  diversification;  (ii)  weak  integration  with  postharvest \nsystems  and  response  to  market  quality  requirements;  (iii)  poor  management  of  natural \nresources; (iv) low private sector investment in agricultural processing, trade, and input supply; \nand (v) weak stakeholder participation in efforts to improve extension and production. The major \nfactors  contributing \ninclude \n(i) underdeveloped  and  weak  research  and  extension,  (ii)  underdeveloped  seed  production \nsystems,  (iii)  restricted  land  use  rights,  (iv)  limited  access  to  financial  services,  and \n\nlow  agricultural  diversification \n\nlow  productivity  and \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n2  Loan  1340(SF),  for  $80  million,  approved  on  8  December  1994,  and  completed  on  30  June  1998,  and  two \nassociated technical assistance (TAs): TA 2224, Rice Market Monitoring and Policy Options Study, for $832,000, \ncompleted  in  December  1996;  and  TA  2225,  Land  Information  System  and  Agricultural  Taxation  Study,  for \n$646,000, completed in June 1998.

Asian Development Outlook 2002. Manila. \n5  Due to declining prices, the total value of agricultural commodity exports fell from $3.2 billion in 1999 to $2.8 billion \nin  2000  and  $2.6  billion  in  2001,  despite  increased  volumes.

Agricultural growth has \nrelied increasingly on intensification and diversification. Intensification has expanded production \nbut has also led to some soil degradation problems, particularly in upland areas. Maintenance of \nsoil fertility is more difficult in upland areas. A major factor inhibiting private sector investment in \nagriculture  has  been  the  dominant  role  of  inefficient  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs).  As \ndiscussed  below,  SOE  reforms  with  donor  support  and  new  Government  policies  to  provide \nincentives to small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development and removal of directed \nlending programs from commercial banks to SOEs are being implemented to help reverse the \nbias against private sector involvement in marketing, trade, and production activities.  \n \n8. \n Agricultural research in Viet Nam is characterized by a fragmentation of efforts. About \n37  research  institutes  with  small  budgets  exist.  Their  concentration  in  the  Red  River  and \nMekong  Deltas,  with  insufficient  representation  in  other  agroecological  zones,  limits  the \nrelevance  of  research  results.  Viet  Nam  spends  only  about  0.3%  of  agricultural  GDP  on \nresearch,  compared  with  0.6%  in  the  PRC  and  1.4%  in  Thailand.  Other  problems  are  poor \ncoordination  among  research  institutions,  weak  linkages  with  extension,  a  shortage  of \nresearch \nsufficiently  qualified \ninfrastructure,  and  insufficient  involvement  of  stakeholders.  On  the  other  hand,  irrigation \nabsorbs the largest share (50%) of the state budget to agriculture; most (90%) of this is used for \ncapital expenditures. As a result, operation and maintenance are neglected. \n \n9. \nThe national extension system created recently in 1993 is operational in only 50% of the \ncommunes  (collection  of  villages).  The  farmer-agent  ratio  is  estimated  at  1,250:1.  Other \nconstraints  include  a  top-down  approach  in  dealing  with  farmers,  insufficient  knowledge  and \nskills  in  effective  communication,  poor  technological  recommendations,  lack  of  funding  for \neffective operations (despite the fact that provincial governments provide about 50% of annual \nbudgets), and ineffective use of mass media and information technology. Public expenditure on \nagricultural extension in 2002 was  only D441 billion ($29 million) or 0.4% of agricultural GDP. \nThis is very low compared with that in neighboring PRC, Thailand, and Malaysia. \n \n10. \nImproved seed is produced by a variety of organizations, including universities, research \ninstitutes,  public  seed  agencies,  and  private  seed  companies.  Because  of  limited  funding  for \nbreeding and research operations, research institutes supplement their budgets with the sale of \nseed directly to both seed companies and farmers. Quality control is insufficient and limited to \ntesting  by  the  National  Center  for  Variety  Evaluation  and  Seed  Certification.  The  Danish \nInternational  Development  Agency  (Danida)  is  currently  funding  a  seed  project  as  part  of  the \nAgriculture  Sector  Program  Support,  with  a  focus  on  seed  certification,  quality  control  and \nregulation,  seed  research  and  pathology,  and  seed  production  and  processing.  Efforts  are \nfocused on rice and maize seeds, the two most important food crops, and institutional support at \nnational,  provincial,  and  on-farm  levels.  De  facto  restrictions  prevent  trade  in  seed  between \nprovinces. As a result of these problems, the use of certified seed is small in the Mekong River \nDelta, rice yields have stagnated over the past 5 years, and maize yields are low (2.5 tons/ha) \ndespite  the  increasing  adoption  of  improved  seed.  Subsidies  on  the  commercial  production  of \nhybrid  rice  and  maize  seeds,  administered  by  provincial  governments  and  the  national \nextension  service,  are  becoming  increasingly  unnecessary  given  the  widespread  adoption  of \nhybrids. Such subsidies divert needed funds away from agricultural extension to small farmers, \nand  discourage  to  some  extent  private  seed  company  sales  of  these  hybrids.  However,  the \npromotion of hybrid rice seeds remains an important part of poverty reduction programs for poor \nand subsistence farmers in mountainous regions (Appendix 1). \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nThe major constraints affecting postharvest systems include (i) continued discrimination \n11. \nagainst private enterprises, (ii) incomplete market liberalization, (iii) inadequate access to land \nand  credit  for  private  investment,  (iv)  lack  of  market  information  and  support  systems,  and  (v) \nlack  of  grades  and  standards.  The  role  of  SOEs  in  agriculture  has  diminished,  but  they  still \ndominate  processing,  exports,  and  imports.  Exports  of  rice,  coffee,  tea,  cashew,  pepper,  and \nrubber,  and  imports  of  fertilizer  are  carried  out  almost  exclusively  by  SOEs.  SOEs  also  enjoy \npreferential  access  to  credit  and  land.  In  some  cases,  these  enterprises  continue  to  receive \nspecial  assistance  even  after  equitization.  On  the  other  hand,  credit  and  land  availability \nseriously constrain private enterprises wishing to expand their operations. Since the late 1980s, \nViet  Nam\u2019s  trade  policy  has  been  extensively  liberalized,  resulting  in  the  dramatic  growth  of \nexports  and  imports.  Following  the  Asian  crisis  of  1997,  however,  reforms  have  stalled,  some \nwith policy reversals. Fertilizer and sugar are subject to \u201cmanaged imports,\u201d although the policy \nis protectionist only in the case of sugar. Vegetable oil is also subject to managed imports under \n\u201ctemporary legislation.\u201d Imports of seeds, breeding animals, and other agricultural inputs require \ngovernment approval, often resulting in delays. \n \nThe existing Land Law limits the use rights of agricultural land to 3 ha. This has restricted \n12. \nland  market  transfers.  Because  households  attempt  to  evade  these  restrictions,  most \ntransactions are unregistered and official information about land distribution becomes unreliable. \nRestrictions on the conversion of paddy land limit other more profitable uses of land and slow \ndown  the  rate  of  crop  diversification.  Previous  policy  changes  have  lifted  several  of  these \nrestrictions.  However,  using  land  as  collateral  for  bank  credit  is  problematic  because  of \ndifficulties in foreclosure.  \n \nRegarding  rural  financial  services,  the  Viet  Nam  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural \n13. \nDevelopment (VBARD) has performed well in providing lending and savings deposit services to \nsmall farmers and microenterprises with very small operations and average loan sizes. VBARD \nhas  managed  strong  growth  in  lending  while  keeping  repayment  rates  high.  However,  its  loan \nportfolio  to  SOEs  has  not  performed  well.  VBARD\u2019s  capital  adequacy  ratio  (CAR)  is  below \naccepted  international  norms  (8%)  largely  due  to  poor  performing  loans  to  SOEs.  Despite \nVBARD\u2019s focus on small farmers and microenterprises, only one third of rural households have \naccess to formal credit in a given year. Most of this credit is short term (less than 1 year), and \nthe  average  loan  size  is  small  (about  $300),  reflecting  the  focus  on  small  farmers  and  other \nborrowers.  Access  to  larger  loans  on  medium  and  long  terms  to  develop  SMEs  has  been \nlimited. Interest rate ceilings in the past prevented VBARD and other banks from offering credit \nto riskier or smaller borrowers, as well as limited their ability to mobilize savings. The Bank for \nthe Poor is now completely separate from VBARD, with its own capital, ownership, and mandate \nto  lend  exclusively  to  the  poor.  Favored  treatment  of  SOEs  in  the  past  has  limited  the  pool  of \ncapital available to farmers and SMEs. However, VBARD in 2002 enacted a new policy that will \nexpand its limited SME portfolio and reduce its SOE portfolio over time. \n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n14. \nAssisted  by  ADB  in  preparing  this  sector  development  program,  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Rural Development (MARD) developed a new agriculture and rural development \nplan and strategy for 2001-2010. The strategy focuses on (i) intensifying agricultural production; \n(ii)  diversifying  into  higher  value  crops  and  new  markets;  (iii)  promoting  off-farm  employment; \nand  (iv)  targeting  poverty,  especially  in  remote  and  upland  areas.  The  instruments  for \nimplementing  this  strategy  include  (i)  science  and  technology  advancements;  (ii)  market- \nsupporting  infrastructure  and  institutions;  (iii)  private  sector  investment  with  a  focus  on  SMEs \ninfrastructure;  and  (v)  participation  of  concerned \nand  off-farm  employment;  (iv)  rural \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nThe  recently  approved  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement  between \n\nstakeholders  at  all  levels  in  policy,  planning,  and  implementation.  The  ninth  Party  Congress \napproved  this  strategy  in  mid-2001  as  part  of  its  10-year  development  plan.  Some  of  the \nquantitative targets over the next decade include (i) sustaining an annual growth rate of 4.5% in \nagriculture;  (ii)  increasing  rice  paddy  production  from  34  million  tons  to  40  million  tons;  (iii) \nincreasing  the  value  of  total  agricultural  exports  from  $4.4  billion  to  $9  billion;  (iv)  decreasing \nrural poverty from 45% to 27%; (v) sustaining an annual growth rate of 9-12% for rural industry \nand services; (vi) increasing the share of industry, trade, and services in the rural economy from \n30% to 45%; and (vii) increasing the average product value of an agricultural laborer from $310 \nto $1,500. \n \n15. \nthe \nGovernment  and  the  ADB  also  identifies  several  strategies  to  reduce  poverty:  (i)  sustainable \ngrowth,  by  reforming  agricultural  research  and  extension,  increasing  private  investment  in \nagricultural  processing,  agricultural  market  support,  improving  financial  infrastructure,  and \nencouraging  a  competitive  domestic  private  sector;  (ii)  inclusive  social  development  through \nsecondary  education  and  primary  health  care  interventions;  (iii)  improved  governance  through \npublic  administration  reform;  and  (iv)  regional  focus  on  the  central  region.  This  agreement  is \nconsistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy \napproved in 2002. \n \nGiven the Government\u2019s, ADB\u2019s and other aid agencies\u2019 planned programs in irrigation, \n16. \nforestry, land markets and tenure,6 rural poverty reduction, and rural infrastructure, the proposed \nAgriculture Sector Development Program (ASDP) will focus on gaps in science and technology, \ntechnology \nthrough  SME \nagroprocessing,  and  market  information.  Major  opportunities  exist  to  increase  agricultural \nproductivity,  growth,  efficiency,  and  competitiveness  of  agricultural  outputs  and  value-added \nproducts, which will lead to sustainable increases in rural incomes. A major factor in increasing \nagricultural  productivity  is  the  application  of  science  and  technology.  New  technologies  in  the \nform  of  higher-yielding  seeds,  improved  animal  husbandry,  and  integrated  pest  management \nresult  in  higher  productivity  and,  where  appropriate  market  conditions  exist,  higher  income. \nStrategies  for  raising  agricultural  productivity,  particularly  for  poor  households,  include  (i) \nrestructuring  and  expanding  public  support  for  agricultural  research,  (ii)  expanding  access  to \ncredit in a sustainable way, (iii) improving seed quality through agricultural research and seed \ncertification, (iv) increasing labor productivity through training and extension, and (v) improving \nmarket intelligence. \n \nIn  the  long  term,  Viet  Nam  must  develop  a  highly  competent  agricultural  research \n17. \nsystem  that  can  develop  and  adapt  cutting-edge  technology.  This  requires  (i)  clear  roles  and \nresponsibilities  of  research  institutes  to  avoid  duplication;  (ii)  increased  funding;  (iii)  increased \ntraining, both degree and nondegree; (iv) increased autonomy in research center management \nand  decision  making;  (v)  reduced  focus  on  commercial  activities  and  increased  focus  on \ndeveloping  new  technologies;  (vi)  rationalization  of  the  research  system,  consolidation  of \ninstitutes,  and  more  regional  focus  within  Viet  Nam;  (vii)  improved  feedback  from  extension \nagents and farmer representatives to researchers on the value of ongoing research and on the \n\nincreased  quality  and  value-added  production \n\ntransfer, \n\n                                                 \n6  The  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida)  has  been  assisting  the  Government  in \nimplementing land reform for the past 5 years, and is planning an extension of grant assistance for another 5 years \n(2002-2007)  to  assist  in  developing  and  implementing  the  proposed  new  land  law  (expected  by  mid-2003).  The \nWorld  Bank  is  also  considering  a  possible  loan  to  help  implement  the  new  land  law.  The  draft  of  the  new  law \nincludes  such  measures  as  increasing  the  agricultural  land  ceiling  size  from  2\u20133  hectares  (ha)  to  10  ha,  tenure \nfrom 20 years to 50 years, access by women, rent and exchange of land, joint farming, and issuing land certificates \nto all eligible households. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ndemand  for  research  in  new  areas;  and  (viii)  increased  use  of  competitive  grants  for  funding \nresearch. \n \n18. \nImproving the productivity of agricultural labor is one of the most important strategies for \nraising  rural  standards  of  living.  Increasing  labor  productivity  will  raise  the  incomes  of  the \nmajority of the rural poor. In the medium and long run, the extension service should adopt the \nfollowing  features:  (i)  increase  the  size  of  the  extension  service  to  fill  gaps  at  the  commune \nlevel, primarily in the remote and mountainous areas; (ii) increase staff training, with focus on a \nbroader range of topics, including group-based participatory methods, farm management, post-\nharvest  processing,  storage,  marketing,  and  credit;  (iii)  increase  the  proportion  of  female \nextension agents and agents from ethnic minorities, and targeting of the rural poor; (iv) increase \nfunding for the extension service with the aim of increasing the size of operating budgets and, to \nthe  extent  possible,  increasing  remuneration;  (v)  increase  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in \ntraining  extension  workers,  setting  priorities  for  public  extension  activities,  and  supporting \nfarmers in appropriate input use; and (vi) establish extension advisory boards to evaluate and \nimprove the extension services, and provide feedback from mass organizations, nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), and private sector input suppliers.  \n \n19. \nFacilitating  the  growth  of  rural  and  agricultural  SMEs  and  improving  their  efficiency  to \nincrease  the  value  of  agricultural  and  rural-based  production  and  to  stimulate  growth  in  rural \nemployment,  present  an  opportunity  to  increase  the  investment  and  participation  of  private \nenterprises  and  decrease  the  dominant  role  of  SOEs  in  processing,  marketing,  and  exporting \ncrops such as rice, coffee, rubber, and tea.7 The Government is not only reducing the access of \nSOEs to preferential credit and land, and requiring SOEs to be self-supporting, but also actively \npromoting SME development by (i) improving access to credit through state-owned commercial \nbanks; (ii) rapidly expanding access to state land in the form of rural industrial parks, rented out \nwith the provision of infrastructure (roads, electricity, water, etc.); and (iii) simplifying taxation of \nSME  and  cracking  down  on  corruption  and  fraud  of  public  officials.  Government  activities  to \nfacilitate  growth  in  private  investment  include  financial  services,  market  information,  export \npromotion,  establishing  grades  and  standards,  inspection  services,  disease  control,  strategic \nand  applied  research,  and  improved  management  of  the  natural  resource  base  on  which \nproduction and rural SME activities depend. \n \n20. \nThe  long-run  objective  for  agricultural  credit  is  to  develop  a  sustainable  system  that \nmobilizes  savings  from  rural  and  urban  households  and  provides  unsubsidized  credit  to \nhouseholds and enterprises on the basis of the quality of the proposed investment and the risks \nassociated  with  the  loan.  In  the  short  and  medium  terms,  VBARD  requires  more  flexibility  in \nsetting interest rates so as to profitably lend to an expanded set of borrowers. It also requires \nrecapitalization  and  reimbursement  for  eligible  nonperforming  loans.  The  Government  should \ndiscontinue the practice of directing loans to SOEs.8 \n \n21.  Market  intelligence,  which  is  required  to  make  markets  more  competitive,  will  benefit \nmainly SMEs, small traders, and farmers. A market information system at retail and wholesale \n\n                                                 \n7  The  World  Bank  and  IMF  are  taking  the  lead  among  aid  agencies  to  assist  with  privatizing,  equitizing,  and \n\nreforming SOEs. \n\n8  IMF and World Bank assistance with reforming and restructuring the four state-owned commercial banks, including \nVBARD,  under  the  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  and  the  Poverty  Reduction  Support  Credit,  includes \n(i) recapitalization,  (ii)  reimbursement  to  the  banks  for  nonperforming  and  directed  loans,  and  (iii)  removal  of \ndirected lending to SOEs. ADB and the World Bank have been assisting VBARD with providing financial services \nto rural households, farmers, and very small enterprises. The World Bank is proposing a $200 million loan in 2002 \nfor this target group. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nlevels will (i) gather prices from a large number of domestic and international markets for all of \nthe  main  commodities;  (ii)  provide  analysis  of  the  recent  trends\u2014on  bulletin  boards  and \nchalkboards at the village and local market levels\u2014changes from a  year ago after adjustment \nfor inflation, and the relationship between domestic prices and corresponding world prices; and \n(iii) disseminate the information through newspapers, magazines, radio, extension agents, and \nthe  Internet.  Improvements  in  the  existing  system  implemented  by  MARD  will  include  (i)  more \nfeedback  from  users;  (ii)  more  precision  on  the  quality,  the  types  of  markets,  and  the  scale \n(wholesale  or  retail)  to  help  users  interpret  price  movements  better;  (iii)  more  analysis  of  the \ntrends;  and  (iv)  greater  dissemination  of  long  term  trends  and  volatility  through  the  extension \nservice.  \n \n22. \nSustainable  growth  of  the  agriculture  sector  is  a  prerequisite  for  economic  growth  and \npoverty  reduction  in  Viet  Nam.  Despite  progress  in  agricultural  production  and  export  growth \nand  in  liberalizing  commodity,  land,  and  credit  markets  in  recent  years,  rural  poverty  remains \nhigh  and  private  sector  investment  remains  small.  Growth  in  the  past  was  the  result  of  (i) \nreliance on higher input use (labor, capital, and water); (ii) policy reforms in land, markets, and \ntrade;  and  (iii)  high  public  investment,  mainly  in  the  form  of  irrigation  and  roads.  The  annual \nsector growth of about 6% over the past decade was largely attributed to increased use of labor \n(14%), land (11%), basic intermediate inputs such as fertilizer (51%), tractors (14%), and water \npumps for irrigation (5%), with total factor productivity through other technology accounting for \nonly 4%.9 Thus, the sector strategy of the 1990s will not be able to sustain growth in the future \nbecause (i) the potential for expanding the rural labor force and land under cultivation is limited; \n(ii)  new  investment  in  irrigation  exhibits  decreasing  marginal  returns  as  the  stock  of  irrigation \ncapital is already very high and requires increased operation, maintenance, and management in \naddition  to  new  expansion  for  irrigation,  water  supply,  and  flood  control;  and  (iii)  rice  export \nrevenue  is  declining  due  to  poor  quality  and  dependence  on  low-end  markets.  Viet  Nam  is \nalready  experiencing  difficulties  in  competition  for  markets  in  rice,  coffee,  and  other \nunprocessed commodities. \n \n23. \nA new strategy is needed to sustain agricultural growth in the future. Future growth will \ndepend on growth in productivity, diversification, quality improvement, and emphasis on related \ntechnology. The Government\u2019s strategy for 2001-2010, supported by ADB and other sources, is \nthe  plan  for  agriculture  in  Viet  Nam.  Policy  makers  in  the  Government  are  interested  in \nsustaining  growth,  employment,  and  exports  in  agriculture  so  as  to  reduce  rural  poverty.  The \nstrategy includes effecting policy reforms for commercial agriculture, livestock, water resources, \nand forestry. Policy reforms in the development and use of technologies through research and \nextension and improved access to credit by SMEs are expected to (i) improve yields; (ii) foster \ndiversification into available markets for higher value crops; (iii) improve the quality of products \nsuch  as  rice,  coffee,  livestock  products,  fruits,  and  vegetables  that  respond  to  and  meet  the \nrequirements of specific, well-targeted domestic and export markets; (iv) increase value-added \nproduction  (e.g.,  processed  and  packaged  cashew,  rice  noodles,  and  brand  name  tea  and \ncoffee);  and  (v)  expand  rural \nincreased \nunderstanding of and responsiveness to different markets, competitiveness in export markets is \nexpected  to  improve.  The  consequence\u2014increased  employment,  and  reduced  indebtedness \nand sales of landholdings\u2014will have beneficial impacts on rural poverty. \n \n24.  Major  factors  contributing  to  low  agricultural  productivity,  quality,  and  diversity  include \nlimited  (i)  understanding  of  potential  market  opportunities,  (ii)  access  to  appropriate  research \n\ninfrastructure,  and  services.  With \n\nindustries, \n\n                                                 \n9  ANZDEC.  2001.  Explaining  Agricultural  Growth  in  Viet  Nam.  Prepared  for  ADB  under  TA  3223-VIE:  Agriculture \n\nSector Program, New Zealand. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nand extension, (iii) access of the private sector to financial services and market information, and \n(iv)  investment  in  new  enterprises.  Increased  investments  and  improvements  in  the  quality  of \nagricultural  research  and  extension  will  improve  crop  diversification,  integration  with  post-\nharvest  systems,  quality  of  production,  and  stakeholder  participation.  A  key  source  of \nsustainable agricultural growth will be technological change leading to levels of productivity and \nquality  that  are  comparable  with  those  of  neighboring  countries.  Effective  use  of  these \ntechnologies, which include new as well as long-standing proven methods currently little used in \nViet  Nam,  requires  access  to  inputs  and  capital,  and  knowledge  and  application  of  improved \nmanagement  practices  and  production  processes.  In  the  past  decade,  agricultural  growth \nfocused more on crop intensification than on crop diversification, and on total production rather \nthan  on  crop  profitability  and  quality.  In  the  next  decade,  with  globalization  and  increased \ncompetition with other countries, the focus must be on agricultural diversification and improved \nproduct  quality.  Specific  institutional  policy  reforms  will  be  required  to  address  major \nweaknesses  in  agricultural  research  and  extension.  Agricultural  research  institutions  have  not \nyet  reacted  flexibly  to  market  needs.  Current  government  policy  has  not  provided  enough \nincentives  to  researchers,  and  they  have  major  financing  needs.  The  agricultural  extension \nsystem  has  poor  linkages  with  research  programs  and  uses  a  top-down  methodology.  It  does \nnot address its small farmer client needs, and is understaffed and poorly trained. It makes poor \nuse  of  mass  media  and  communications,  and  also  has  funding  gaps.  Reforms  in  these \ninstitutions  will  facilitate  investments  in  human  resources  and  infrastructure  that  will  allow  a \nmore significant contribution to agricultural growth than in the past. \n \n25. \nPrivate enterprises wishing to expand their operations are seriously constrained by lack \nof  credit  and  market  information.  To  take  advantage  of  value-added  market  opportunities,  the \nGovernment will need to more actively support trade promotion and assist the private sector with \nproduct-specific  market  research.  Capacity  building  for  MARD  and  the  provincial  and  improved \ncoordination in trade promotion functions (including market analysis, exhibitions, and information \non  export  and  import  requirements)  are  needed.  Previous  projects  have  not  adequately \naddressed the financial needs of these SMEs, except for microenterprises and very small SMEs \nunder  previous  ADB  financing.  The  provision  of  market  information  and  medium-  and  long-term \nfunds will facilitate and accelerate investment in agro-industry. It will also encourage the adoption \nof  new  technologies  crucial  to  the  success  of  these  enterprises  in  a  competitive  environment. \nProgram  reforms  and  investments  intend  to  provide  the  SMEs  with  agricultural  market \ninformation, increase access to medium- and long-term credit, and encourage the development \nof SMEs in agro-industry. \n \nVBARD, the leading commercial bank in rural areas, recently started lending to private \n26. \nSMEs.  Its  new  strategy,  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  10-year  development  plan,  is  to \nsupport SMEs while reducing lending over time to SOEs. By supporting VBARD, the Program \nwill  be  able  to  reach  a  major  share  of  existing  and  potential  agro-industry  SMEs  and  partially \naddress  the  financing  gap.  Credit  to  SMEs  will  facilitate  the  adoption  of  relevant  technologies \ngenerated  by  the  research  institutes  and  promoted  by  the  extension  service.  VBARD  needs \npolicy reforms to strengthen its financial performance and capacity to deliver sustainable credit \nand expand services to SMEs. The relatively high level of liquidity in the banking system in Viet \nNam  is  mainly  due  to  short-term  deposits.  Medium-term  and  long-term  funds  are  needed  for \ninvestments.  Funds  provided  by  ASDP  will  meet  this  need,  as  well  as  improve  the  balance \nbetween  short-term  and  long-term  funds  in  the  banking  sector.  ASDP  will  help  create  an \nenvironment  conducive  to  business  expansion.  ADB\u2019s  loan  will  foster  more  balanced  and \ndiversified portfolios in VBARD and help make it less risk exposed. Being long-term, ADB funds \nwill  strengthen  VBARD  financially  by  reducing  its  duration  and  interest-variation  risks  and \nimproving its fund management. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nThe  Information  Center  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (ICARD)  will  have  a \n27. \nsignificant role in filling the gap in market information. ICARD has conducted pilot studies in a \nnumber  of  districts,  communes,  and  villages  and  have  done  follow-up  surveys  to  assess  how \nmuch  information  the  target  groups  have  actually  received  and  whether  the  information  was \nuseful.  The  percentage  of  users  receiving  the  information  has  rapidly  increased  and  its \nusefulness  is  apparent.  Bulletin  boards  and  chalkboards  have  been  found  to  be  the  most \nsuccessful means of disseminating price and market information to most farmers and retailers \n(Appendix 1). ICARD also has a web site that is kept current and is used to help prepare daily \nbulletin  board  updates.  By  supporting  ICARD,  the  Program  will  provide  price  and  market \ninformation  and  analysis  in  collaboration  with  private  sector  marketing  agents  to  encourage \ndiversification  into  high-value  commodities  and  products,  including  those  with  high  export \npotential. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n28. \nThe Program has been designed to assist the Government address declining growth in \nthe  agriculture  sector  and  rural  economy  by  addressing  key  constraints  to  agricultural \nproductivity and competitiveness. Beneficiaries will have opportunities to increase incomes and \nemployment  and  improve  the  quality  of  life  through  access  to  strengthened  and  more \nresponsive  agricultural  support  services  and  capital.  Private  sector  agro-industries  will  receive \nincentives  to  increase  investment  and  employment  through  improved  access  to  capital.  The \nobjectives  of  the  Program  will  be  to  facilitate  increases  in  agricultural  productivity,  profitability, \nand competitiveness in domestic and export markets by increasing the capacity of research and \nextension  to  deliver  relevant  technology,  improving  access  to  information,  and  increasing \naccess  of  private  sector  SMEs  to  capital.  The  expected  outcomes  are  increased  agricultural \ndiversification,  improved  postharvest  systems,  reduced  vulnerability  of  rural  households,  and \ngreater participation of rural households in sector development efforts. ASDP includes specific \nreform  measures  to  (i)  strengthen  support  services  in  science  and  technology  (research  and \nextension);  and  (ii)  promote  the  development  of  agro-industry  SMEs.10  The  chronology  of \ndesigning ASDP is in Appendix 2. \n \n29. \nASDP  consists  of  two  components  with  common  objectives:  (i)  a  program  or  policy \nreform loan, and (ii) a project or agro-industry SME loan. Policy reforms in research, extension, \nmarket information, and financial services to agro-industry SMEs are required to implement the \nGovernment\u2019s 10-year (2001-2010) development strategy and to permit meaningful investments \nin science and technology, and private sector SME development. The project loan, consisting of \nfinancial support to VBARD to provide medium- and long-term credit for the rapidly expanding \nagro-industry SMEs, is consistent with the Program\u2019s objectives and is required to help meet the \nrapidly growing demand for SME financial services. \n \nB. \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n30. \nThe goals of the program loan are to assist the Government increase agricultural growth \non a sustainable basis, create employment opportunities, and reduce poverty in the rural areas. \n\n                                                 \n10 Government Decree no. 90 of 2001 defines SMEs as having registered capital of less than D10 billion ($660,000) \n\nor permanent employees of less than 300. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nIts specific objective is to increase agricultural productivity, profitability, and competitiveness by \nrestructuring  the  management  of  agricultural  science  and  technology,  improving  market \nintelligence, phasing out commercial seed subsidies, and encouraging the development of agro-\nindustry SMEs through improved access to credit. The development policy letter describing the \nGovernment\u2019s reform measures and the proposed policy matrix are in Appendix 3. The program \nframework is in Appendix 4. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  program  loan  has  two  components:  (i)  strengthening  science  and  technology \n\n31. \n(agricultural research and extension) and (ii) promoting agro-industry SME development. \n \n\na. \n\nStrengthening Science and Technology \n\n32. \nAgricultural  Research.  As  a  first-tranche  condition,  MARD  will  have  approved  an \nagricultural  research  reorganization  plan  that  is  in  substance  acceptable  to  ADB  and  which  is \nbased on the Borrower\u2019s Master Plan for Agricultural Research prepared with the assistance of \nthe  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO).  Following  the  Master  Plan,  (i)  the  number  of \nresearch institutes and centers are reduced to about 25, including 2 new regional centers\u2014for \nthe  central  coast  and  northern  highland  agroecological  regions\u2014are  created;  (ii)  the  functions \nand  responsibilities  of  each  institute  are  clarified  and  duplications  eliminated  to  ensure  more \nfocus  on  important  agricultural  problems  in  food  crops,  perennial  and  cash  crops,  livestock, \npostharvest and engineering systems, soil and water resources, forestry, and agricultural policy; \n(iii)  standards  and  performance-based  evaluation  of  agricultural  research  institute  staff  are \nestablished  to  provide  financial  and  other  rewards  to  good  performers;11  and  (iv)  prioritize \nagricultural research toward more adaptive on-farm research which should be undertaken in a \nparticipatory manner involving extension staff and farmers. The plan should also propose how to \ndeal  with  the  surplus  staff  that  will  result  from  the  reorganization  of  the  agricultural  research \ninstitutes and centers.  \n \n33. \nAlso  as  first-tranche  conditions,  (i)  MARD  will  have  issued  regulatory  instructions, \nacceptable  to  ADB,  to  the  research  institutes  to  phase  out  commercial  activities,  including  the \nmass  production  and  sale  of  certified  seed,  allowing  only  the  sale  of  breeder\u2019s  seed  and \nfoundation  seeds  (pre-basic  and  basic  seed)  to  private  and  public  seed  companies;  (ii)  the \nMinistry  of  Science  and  Technology  (MOST)  and  MARD  will  have  established  a  system  of \ncompetitive grants for agricultural research institutes, with rationalized criteria for the award of \ngrants;  and  (iii)  MARD  will  have  issued  regulations,  acceptable  to  ADB,  giving  agricultural \nresearch institutes and centers autonomy to effectively carry out research, obtain funding from \nsources  other  than  the  national  budget,  provide  financial  incentives  to  research  staff,  and \ndevelop  personnel  and  administrative  policy  in  accordance  with  their  autonomy  status.  MARD \nwill  develop  a  system  of  governance  to  ensure  that  the  results  from  research  autonomy \nappropriately reflect national goals. Available TA may be used as needed. In addition, to provide \nan adequate recurrent and operating budget to agricultural research institutes and centers, the \nGovernment  will  submit  a  national  budget  for  2003  that  increases  allocations  for  agricultural \nresearch at a rate of at least 12%. \n \n\n                                                 \n11  MARD  will  actively  seek  opportunities  for  study-abroad  programs  to  better  prepare  its  research  staff  for  service \nunder  the  restructured  research  system.  Potential  aid  sources,  such  as  those  mentioned  in  para.  56,  should  be \ncontacted. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nAs  second-tranche  conditions,  MARD  will  have  started  implementing  the  agricultural \n34. \nresearch reorganization plan by (i) consolidating the research institutes and centers to about 25 \n(including two new regional institutes); (ii) defining the responsibilities of the regional centers, for \nimproved development of farming systems appropriate to their region; and (iii) preparing a plan \nacceptable to the Government and ADB to further reduce the number of research institutes to \nan appropriate number based on the priorities established by MARD. Also, MARD will have (i) \ncompleted  the  phaseout  of  commercial  activities  (i.e.,  the  sale  of  certified  seed)  by  the \nagricultural  research  institutes;  (ii)  issued  at  least  10  competitive  grants  to  research  institutes; \n(iii) approved a human resource development plan to strengthen agricultural research over the \nnext  5\u201310  years;  and  (iv)  pilot-tested  a  rural  system  for  integrated  research  and  extension  to \nincrease  rural  incomes  and  livelihood  at  one  of  its  regional  research  institutes  in  the  central \nregion.  Also,  the  Government  will  continue  to  increase  the  national  budget  for  agricultural \nresearch in 2004 at the rate of at least 12%. \n \n35. \nAs third-tranche conditions, (i) the reorganization, consolidation, and restructuring of the \nagricultural research institutes will have been completed according to the agricultural research \nreorganization plan, and all staff affected either placed in the surplus pool for reassignment to \nother government agencies or provided a severance package consistent with the Government\u2019s \nResolution no. 16 of 18 October 2000; (ii) MARD will have implemented the approved plan for \nstaff standards and performance-based evaluation; (iii) the research institutes will have started \noperations as autonomous organizations; and (iv) the Government will continue to increase the \nnational  budget  for  agricultural  research  in  2005  at  the  rate  of  at  least  12%.  The  Government \nhas agreed to sustain this level of financing in the future, consistent with the approved 10-year \ndevelopment plan (2001-2010). \n \n36. \nAgricultural Extension. As a first-tranche condition, MARD will have issued to at least \n20 provincial governments, operational guidelines for establishing provincial extension advisory \ncouncils  to  provide  a  forum  for  stakeholder  participation  in  the  preparation  of  extension \nprograms and other related activities. Council representation will include farmers\u2019 and growers' \nassociations,  mass  organizations,  cooperatives,  local  research  institutes,  extension  staff, \nVBARD,  NGOs,  private  sector  input  suppliers,  and  staff  from  DAFE,  planning,  land,  finance, \nscience  and  technology,  and  trade.  Also,  MARD  will  have  issued  a  regulation  to  contract  out \nsome extension services to NGOs, universities, farmers\u2019 organizations, private companies, input \nsuppliers, and agribusinesses where possible. Also as a first-tranche condition, the Government \nwill submit a national budget for 2003 that increases extension allocation at the rate of at least \n12% to provide an adequate recurrent and operating budget to agricultural extension. \n \n37. \nThe  budget  increases  and  increase  in  extension  staff  at  the  commune  level  are \nconsistent with the proposed ADB-financed Public Administration Reform Program. Currently in \nits  design  phase,  this  reform  program  is  proposing  that  rightsizing  of  government  is  more \nappropriate  than  downsizing  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  context.  In  the  longer  run,  mechanical  downsizing \ncannot be the singular aim. Instead, the numbers and skills of civil servants must be adapted to \nemerging  new  responsibilities,  functions,  structures,  and  organization  of  the  Government.  The \nnet impact of budget increases under ASDP will be minimal on the national budgets. \n \n38. \nAs a second-tranche condition, the provincial extension advisory councils will have been \nestablished  in  at  least  20  provinces.  MARD  and  representatives  of  all  the  provincial \ngovernments  will  have  approved  a  joint  plan  for  extension  work,  acceptable  to  ADB,  that  (i) \ndevelops  extension  strategies  and  priorities  that  focus  extension  efforts  in  remote  and  upland \nareas  where  there  are  large  numbers  of  poor  farmers;  (ii)  strengthens  linkages  between \nresearch  and  extension;  (iii)  redirects  training  of  extension  staff  toward  a  new  set  of  skills \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nincluding  participatory  extension  methodology,  marketing,  postharvest  activities,  and  rural \nfinance; (iv) institutionalizes the participatory approach12 in extension services in which farmers \nwill  increasingly  participate  in  planning,  implementing,  monitoring,  and  evaluating  of  extension \nactivities;  (v)  expands  the  provision  of  extension  services  at  the  district  and  commune  levels, \nparticularly in poor provinces, by hiring an additional 5,000 extension staff to fill vacancies at the \ncommune level;13 (vi) increases funding to train extension staff and farmers; and (vii) improves \ndelivery of extension services to the poor, women, and ethnic groups by increasing the number \nof female and ethnic minority staff by at least 10% in each category over a period of 36 months. \n \n39. \nASDP  gender-specific  actions,  such  as  increasing  the  recruitment  of  female  extension \nagents,  will  be  coordinated  and  consistent  with  the  gender  strategy  of  MARD  and  the  sector \nbeing  developed  with  ADB  assistance.14  Increasing  the  number  of  women  and  ethnic  minority \nstaff  in  the  extension  service  is  considered  appropriate  and  realistic,  given  the  limited,  but \ngrowing,  levels  of  qualified  candidates  at  the  commune  level.  Although  the  number  of  women \nand ethnic minority secondary graduates from agricultural universities is very small, it has been \ngrowing  in  recent  years  due  to  (i)  increasing  education  possibilities  in  the  remote  and \nmountainous  areas,  (ii)  more  active  recruitment  for  extension  agents  in  these  areas,  and  (iii) \nincreased interest of women and ethnic peoples in extension jobs. \n \n40. \nAlso  as  second-tranche  conditions,  (i)  multiple  or  pluralistic  extension  services  will  be \noperating in at least five provinces; (ii) MARD will have issued a regulation/circular to reorganize \nthe  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  Extension  by  transferring  its  National  Extension \nCenter (NEC) to a separate entity so that it will be solely responsible for agricultural extension; \n(iii) MARD in cooperation with local authorities, will have issued a regulation/circular establishing \nin  agronomy, \nteams  of  subject  matter  specialists,  comprising  experts \nprovincial-level \nhorticulture,  soil  fertility,  crop  protection,  livestock  production,  forestry,  farm  management  and \nsociology, to assist the extension staff in providing advisory services to farmers\u2019 groups and in \ntraining  extension  staff  in  specific  skills;  and  (iv)  the  Government  will  continue  to  increase  the \nnational budget for agricultural extension in 2004 at the rate of at least 12%.  \n \n41. \nAs  third-tranche  conditions,  (i)  provincial  agricultural  advisory  councils  will  have  been \nestablished in about 20 more provinces; (ii) the participatory extension approach will have been \nimplemented  in  at  least  40  communes  in  40  districts  in  at  least  10  provinces;  (iii)  provincial \ngovernments will have hired an additional 1,000 extension workers, at least 10% of whom will \nbe  women  and  10%  from  ethnic  minorities,  to  fill  vacancies  at  the  commune  level;  (iv)  about \n1,000  staff  will  have  trained  in  various  fields,  including  participatory  extension  methodology, \nmarketing,  postharvest  activities,  and  rural  finance;  (v)  multiple  extension  services  will  have \nexpanded to cover at least 10 provinces; (vi)  teams of subject matter specialists will have been \nestablished  in  at  least  10  provinces;  (vii)  NEC  will  have  been  established  and  become \noperational;  and  (viii)  the  Government  will  continue  to  increase  the  national  budget  for \nagricultural  extension  in  2005  at  the  rate  of  at  least  12%.  The  Government  has  agreed  to \nsustain  this level  of  financing  in  the  future,  consistent  with the  approved  10-year  development \nplan (2001-2010). \n \n\n                                                 \n12 Participatory  approaches  that  have  been  well  tested  in  Viet  Nam  during  recent  years  include  the  participatory \nagricultural  extension  methodology,  participatory  village  planning  and  management,  agricultural  extension  clubs, \nand farmer interest groups. The extension service can adopt any one of these approaches. \n\n13 The  people's  committees  at  the  district  and  commune  levels  will  be  responsible  for  recruiting  and  funding  these \n\ncommune-level extension workers, and there will be no cost implications to the Government. \n\n14 ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to Viet Nam for the Gender Strategy and Implementation Plan for Agriculture and \n\nRural Development.  Manila. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nb. \n\nPromoting Agro-industry Development \n\n42. \nAs  a  first-tranche  condition,  MARD  will  have  approved  a  plan,  acceptable  to  ADB,  to \nestablish and strengthen an agricultural market information system (AMIS) that links provinces \nand districts, and includes market demand and risk analysis for trade promotion. The system will \nalso allow feedback of market needs and issues to agricultural research. The plan will include (i) \na  strategy  for  establishing  the  AMIS;  and  (ii)  outputs,  activities,  monitoring  indicators,  cost \nestimates,  cost  recovery,  and  implementation  arrangements  for  phased  investment  in  the \nestablishment  of  an  AMIS  in  the  country.  Also  as  first-tranche  conditions,  MARD  will  have  (i) \nterminated subsidies on hybrid maize seed; (ii) issued letters to the four provinces that currently \nsubsidize the commercial production of hybrid rice to terminate the subsidy, and the provinces \nwill  have  terminated  the  subsidy;  and  (iii)  issued  letters  to  the  18  provinces  that  currently \nsupport poverty reduction for poor farmers through subsidized hybrid rice seeds, indicating that \n(a) the subsidy be limited to poor farmers identified in the commune list of poor farmers; (b) the \nsubsidy to the same farmer will be phased out over a 3-crop period; and (c) the amount used for \nthe subsidy should be limited and the funds should be used for extension. MARD will monitor to \nensure  that  no  province  will  subsidize  commercial  production  of  hybrid  rice  or  maize.  The \nsavings from subsidies will enable the staff to focus on group-based extension activities and to \nredirect expenditures in the field to higher priority extension activities. \n \nConsistent with international banking norms, the Government and VBARD are committed \n43. \nto  increase  and  maintain  a  CAR  of  at  least  8%.  However,  the  Government  proposes  that  this \nrequirement be achieved over several years in conformity with the IMF/World Bank policy letter \non  restructuring  state-owned  commercial  banks,  including  VBARD.  As  first-tranche  conditions, \n(i)  the  Government  will  have  paid  into  VBARD  additional  legal  capital  of  no  less  than  D480 \nbillion;  (ii)  VBARD  will  have  appropriately  classified  its  loans  and  adequately  provisioned  for \nexpected  loan  losses  and  solvency  requirements  consistent  with  SBV  Decision  488;15  and  (iii) \nVBARD will have provided commercial loans at interest rates negotiated between VBARD and \nits borrowers.  \n \n44. \nAs  second-tranche  conditions,  (i)  MARD  and  the  provincial  governments  will  have \nestablished  the  AMIS  in  at  least  50  districts  within  10  provinces;  and  (ii)  the  Government  will \nhave increased VBARD\u2019s legal capital to no less than D1.44 trillion. As third-tranche conditions, \n(i)  MARD  and  the  provincial  governments  will  have  expanded  the  AMIS  to  cover  another  50 \ndistricts  within  10  provinces;  and  (ii)  MARD  will  have  terminated  subsidies  for  the  commercial \nproduction of hybrid rice seeds, and the funds used instead for the transfer of hybrid rice seed \ntechnology  through  extension  activities.  Also  as  third-tranche  conditions,  the  Government  will \nhave (i) increased VBARD\u2019s legal capital to no less than D1.92 trillion, and (ii) provided financial \nsupport  to  VBARD  for  VBARD  to  forgive  eligible  nonperforming  loans  identified  as  of \n\n                                                 \n15 SBV  Decision  488  of  27  November  2000  from  SBV  relates to  categories  of  nonperforming  or  overdue  loans  and \n\nprovisioning to recover or retire these loans. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n31 December 2000 in accordance with Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 149 of 5 November 200116 \non resolving the nonperforming loans of state-owned commercial banks. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n45. \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $60 million equivalent denominated in Special \nDrawing Rights from its Special Funds resources for ASDP, with a term of 24 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. The loan will finance the policy reforms in three tranches over a 3-\nyear period, from January 2003 to December 2005. This amount was determined through ADB\u2019s \ncontinued  dialogue  with  the  Government  and  the  size  of  the  short-term  adjustment  costs  of \nimplementing the Program. Use of low-cost funds from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources is justified \nin support of policy reforms that address complex and long-standing issues and socially significant \nmeasures to (i) enhance benefits to small farmers; (ii) free government resources currently used \nin  subsidies;  and  (iii)  improve  the  terms  of  trade  for  agriculture  on  which  the  livelihood  of  the \nmajority  of  the  households,  especially  the  poor,  depend.  In  addition,  the  adjustment  costs  to \nimplement the Program are substantial. \n \n46. \nAn  estimated  net  adjustment  cost  of  about  $90  million  is  required  to  catalyze  the \nchanges to enhance productivity and profitability in the agriculture sector through the proposed \nreform  measures.  Reforming  the  research  and  extension  institutions  will  involve  restructuring \nthe research organization and expanding the commune-level extension services. The services \nmust  be  realigned  to  support  the  needs  of  farmers  at  the  subsistence  level  and  at  different \nlevels of commercialization through participatory processes, and to improve coverage within the \nmajor  agroecological  zones.  This  will  involve,  initially,  increased  recurrent  expenditure  for \nresearch and extension to cover operating expenses (training and facilities improvements are to \nbe covered under a subsequent investment phase). The loan will help the Government to adjust \nits recurrent budget to meet these incremental expenses. After the loan period, the Government \nwill be fully responsible for maintaining the research and extension recurrent budget at its new \nlevel.  The  adjustment  costs  include  (i)  $42  million  for  increasing  the  Government\u2019s  budgetary \nsupport  for  restructuring  and  modernizing  the  research  and  extension  systems,  and  (ii)  $49 \nmillion for Government\u2019s contributions to improve the asset quality of VBARD to resolve debts \non nonperforming loans. These costs represent less than 2% of the annual capital budget of the \nnational  and  local  governments  for  agriculture  by  during  2003\u20132007,  and  1%  of  the  average \nannual budget for all state-owned commercial banks during 2003\u20132007.  \n \n\n                                                 \n16 Nonperforming  loans  are  defined  as  loans  classified  under  groups  3  and  4  according  to  SBV  Decision  488  of \n27 November  2000,  unless  otherwise  amended  by  SBV.  Decision  149  provides  general  principles  on \nnonperforming  loan  resolution.  Specifically,  nonperforming  loans  are  categorized  into  three  types:  (i)  those  with \ncollateral,  (ii)  those  without  collateral  owned  by  operative  debtors,  and  (iii)  those  without  collateral  owned  by \nnonoperative debtors. In the first category of nonperforming loans, creditors (e.g., VBARD) can sell the assets to \nasset management companies, auction them in an auction center, or liquidate the assets. In the second category, \nthe creditor can sell the debt to a third party, conduct a debt-equity swap, reschedule the debt, reduce the interest \nrate,  or  provide  debtors  with  additional  funds.  The  creditor  can  also  reevaluate  the  true  value  of  the  debt.  The \ndifference  between  the  true  and  nominal  value  will  be  submitted  to  relevant  authorities  for  forgiving  the \nnonperforming loan. In the third category, the creditor  will classify the nonperforming loan and report to SBV and \nthe Government for forgiving the loan and recapitalization. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n4. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\na. \n\nProgram Management \n\n47.  MARD will be the Executing Agency and will (i) coordinate with the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF), the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV), and \nVBARD on the policy reforms; and (ii) oversee compliance with the tranche conditions. MOF will \nbe  responsible  for  administering  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  the  Borrower  will  be \nresponsible for requesting tranche releases from ADB. MARD will be responsible for day-to-day \nimplementation, including monitoring the implementation of the Program and use of counterpart \nfunds,  and  evaluating  the  impact  of  the  reforms  on  stakeholders.  MARD  has  established  a \nprogram  implementation  unit  (PIU),  appointed  a  program  director  and  a  deputy  program \ndirector,  and  established  a  steering  committee  chaired  by  a  vice  minister  of  MARD.  The \ncommittee  comprises  senior  staff  from  MARD,  MOF,  MPI,  SBV,  and  VBARD  and  will  meet  at \nleast quarterly. The steering committee will ensure that the reforms are undertaken in line with \nthe  agreed-upon  timetable.  The  PIU  will  have  the  following  minimum  key  personnel:  (i)  a \nprogram  director  to  oversee  program  implementation  and  policy  reforms,  and  (ii)  a  deputy \nprogram director from MARD's Agricultural Projects Management Board to monitor and evaluate \nthe  implementation  of  the  policy  reforms.  The  PIU  will  have  the  following  functions:  (i)  submit \nsemiannual  reports  to  ADB  and  MARD  on  progress  and  issues  relating  to  program \nimplementation; (ii) coordinate, monitor, and supervise program implementation; and (iii) assess \nthe  impact  of  the  Program.  Both  the  steering  committee  and  the  PIU  will  coordinate  activities \nwith MARD's existing science and technology and trade promotion advisory committees. \n \n\nb. \n\nImplementation Period  \n\nImplementation will last for 3 years, beginning in April 2003 and ending in March 2006. \n\n48. \n \n\nc. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n49. \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items produced \nand procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items (Appendix 5). The Government \nwill  certify  that  (i)  if  the  loan  proceeds  will  finance  goods  already  imported,  the  value  of  eligible \nimports in the period concerned will exceed the amount of the requested withdrawal; or (ii) if the \nloan  proceeds  finance  items  to  be  imported,  the  value  of  eligible  imports  in  the  immediately \npreceding 1-year period will be equal to or greater than the amount of the requested withdrawal \nplus  all  other  amounts  expected  to  be  withdrawn  during  the  succeeding  1-year  period. \nProcurement will be based on normal commercial practice for the private sector and government \nprocedures for the public sector. \n \n\nd. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n50. \nThe use of the loan proceeds will be audited only upon ADB\u2019s request, provided that ADB \nretains the right to (i) audit any account, and (ii) verify the validity of the certification issued by the \nGovernment  for  each  withdrawal  application.  Prior  to  withdrawal,  the  Government  will  open  an \naccount at a commercial bank, acceptable to ADB, to receive all loan proceeds. The Government \nwill manage, operate, and liquidate the account in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. The \nPIU will submit to ADB and MARD semiannual progress reports on the progress of completing the \npolicy reform measures, and also brief monthly reports. MARD will submit a program completion \nreport within 3 months after program completion. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\ne. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\nThe Government has agreed to use the local currency proceeds of the program loan to \n\n51. \nsupport reforms in the agriculture sector. Counterpart funds will not be used to support SOEs. \n \n\nf. \n\nTranching and Monitoring \n\n52. \nThe proposed program loan will be released in three tranches. The first tranche of $20 \nmillion equivalent will be available for release upon loan effectiveness, subject to full compliance \nwith the first-tranche conditions. The second tranche of $20 million equivalent will be released \napproximately 18 months later, after the Government\u2019s due compliance with the second-tranche \nconditions. The third tranche of $20 million equivalent will be released within 36 months of the \nfirst  tranche  after  the  Government\u2019s  due  compliance  with  the  third-tranche  conditions.  The \nGovernment and ADB will closely monitor actions related to the tranche conditions jointly. \n \n53.  MARD,  through  the  PIU  and  its  concerned  departments,  will  collect  benchmark  or \nbaseline  data  at  the  start  of  the  Program.  Both  the  Government  and  ADB  will  regularly  and \nclosely monitor the implementation of the Program. The policy actions and their outcomes will \nbe  monitored.  Specific  program  performance  indicators  have  been  developed  to  assist  with \nmonitoring. Program impact and outcome will be assessed, particularly from the perspective of \nproductivity  gains  for  farmers,  increased  SME  investment  and  employment,  increased \ntechnology and genetic material production and dissemination, and consumption patterns of the \nurban  and  rural  poor  due  to  shifts  in  the  market  prices  of  staple  food  items.  Mechanisms  to \nmonitor these will be assigned to independent research agencies to be appointed by MARD. \n \n\ng. \n\nProgram Performance Management System \n\n54.  MARD  will  establish  and  maintain  the  program  performance  management  system  that \nwill  include  a  database  of  the  status  of  policy  reform  measures,  program  indicators,  etc.,  and \nimpact of the policy reform measures at the sector and stakeholder levels. \n \n\nh. \n\nProgram Review \n\n55. \nThe Government, MARD, and ADB will conduct a comprehensive midterm review at the \nend  of  year  2  of  the  Program  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  the  reform  measures  on  beneficiaries \nand  the  sector  overall,  and  the  performance  of  the  PIU.  ADB  will  conduct  annual  reviews \nthroughout the program implementation period. \n \n\ni. \n\nDonor Coordination \n\nSeveral multilateral and bilateral agencies are actively involved in research and extension, \n56. \nalthough  most  of  their  activities  are  very  small  and  in  the  form  of  studies  and  limited  grants  for \ninternational scholarships. Only ADB is currently supporting SMEs in agriculture through financial \nservices.  MARD\u2019s  international  support  group  is  taking  the  lead  in  cooperation  and  information \nsharing, and ASDP will use this mechanism to continue coordinating with other agencies and to \nminimize duplication. FAO and several international agricultural research institutes are involved in \nagricultural research. Australia\u2019s Allwright Fellowship Scheme supports the Capacity Building for \nAgriculture and Rural Development program for degree training for research staff. The Center for \nf\u00fcr  Technische \nInternational  Research  and  Development \nZusammenarbeit  (GTZ),  and  Danida  also  provide  fellowships  for  international  graduate  degree \ntraining.  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida),  Danida,  Swiss  Agency \n\n(France),  ADB,  Gesellschaft \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nfor  Development  and  Cooperation,  GTZ,  Netherlands  Development  Organization,  FAO,  and \nseveral  international  NGOs  are  very  active  in  agricultural  extension,  using  participatory  group-\nbased  approaches,  extension  clubs,  and  farmer  field  schools.  Sida  is  also  active  in  other  areas \nrelevant to the proposed program, including land reform. The development coordination matrix is \nin Appendix 6. \n \nC. \n\nThe Project Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n57. \nThe  project  loan  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  reduce  poverty  and  promote \nprivate  sector  investments  in  agro-based  SMEs  by  providing  medium-  and  long-term  credit. \nVBARD  will  target  SMEs  with  up  to  300  employees.  Currently,  the  average  loan  size  is  about \n$100,000, ranging from about $20,000 to $500,000.17 No other commercial banks are currently \nassisting SMEs in the agriculture sector. SMEs in agriculture and the rural areas are expected \nto  grow  significantly.  The  demand  for  agro-industry  SME  credit  during  the  project  period  is \nestimated  at  about  $2.4  billion  equivalent,  of  which  VBARD  plans  to  provide  about  30%.18 \nVBARD has shown adequate capacity to provide credit to SMEs in previous lending operations. \nWith strengthened measures on financial prudence and SME operations, VBARD is expected to \nprovide further financial services successfully and profitably.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n58. \nThe  project  loan  will  provide  funds  for  medium-  and  long-term  loans  to  SMEs  in  agro-\nindustry.  The  Project  will  support  environmentally  sound  rural  businesses  to  improve \nproductivity,  enhance  product  quality,  and  generate  economic  growth  and  employment. \nPotential businesses cover broad categories of economic activities including (i) agricultural input \nproducers  and  suppliers;  (ii)  processors  of  fruits,  vegetables,  other  horticultural  crops,  and \nindustrial  crops;  (iii)  processors  of  fish  and  livestock  products;  (iv)  services  such  as \nmechanization;  (v)  small-scale  manufacturers  producing  goods  such  as  baskets  and  bags, \nmats, furniture, woven products; and (vi) storage and marketing businesses. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n59. \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $30 million equivalent denominated in Special \nDrawing  Rights  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  augment  VBARD\u2019s  own  resources  for \nlending to SMEs. ADB\u2019s support is proposed to provide term lending that is currently scarce in \nVBARD. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an \ninterest  charge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter. \nVBARD will provide matching funds of $6 million equivalent, so that the total loanable funds will \nbe $36 million equivalent. The beneficiaries (agro-industry SME borrowers) will contribute about \n20% own equity financing of the subproject cost in the form of labor, capital, and land. Detailed \nterms and conditions for subloan application are in paras. 62-66. \n\n                                                 \n17 Under Loan 1802-VIE(SF), clients are defined as those with less than 50 employees and whose average loan size \n\nis $7,500. \n\n18 The  Appraisal  Mission  has  estimated  from  available  government  data  that  there  are  currently  about  87,000 \nregistered SMEs in Viet Nam, of which about 42% or 37,000 are registered agro-industry SMEs. The rate of growth \nof  registered  agro-industry  SMEs  is  about  25%  per  year  and  this  trend  is  expected  to  continue  throughout  the \nprogram period. The registered capital of these SMEs is currently about D36 trillion, and the estimated demand for \ncredit  in  2002  is  D8  trillion.  The  demand  during  the  project  period  is  estimated  at  D34  trillion  ($2.4  billion).  A \ndemand analysis has been prepared. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\na. \n\nProject Management \n\nVBARD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  project  loan.  VBARD  has  established  a \n60. \nsuitably equipped and staffed PIU with a part-time director at its headquarters. The PIU will be \nthe focal point for all matters in implementing, managing, and coordinating the loan. The PIU will \nhave  the  following  minimum  key  personnel:  (i)  a  credit  officer  responsible  to  ensure  and \nfacilitate implementation of the credit line, (ii) an evaluation officer to monitor and evaluate loan \nimplementation, and (iii) a budget officer to prepare relevant withdrawal applications and submit \nperiodic  reports  to  ADB.  VBARD  has  over  1,300  branch  offices  at  the  provincial,  district,  and \ncommune levels and adequate staff to implement the Project.  \n \n61. \nThe PIU will be specifically responsible for (i) submitting withdrawal applications to ADB; \n(ii)  coordinating  and  consolidating  the  loan  reporting  requirements;  (iii)  overseeing  the \nimplementation  of  the  various  components;  (iv)  undertaking  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation; \n(v) advertising the credit lines and supervising their implementation; (vi) conducting workshops \nto  clarify  the  objectives,  scope,  targets,  and  implementation  plans  for  the  components  of  the \ninvestment;  (vii)  carrying  out  a  midterm  review  and  evaluation;  and  (viii)  producing  progress \nreports,  project  completion  reports,  and  other  reports  as  may  reasonably  be  required  by  ADB \nduring implementation. \n \n\nb. \n\nRelending and Onlending Terms and Conditions \n\nThe Borrower will relend the proceeds of the project loan in dong to VBARD to onlend to \n62. \neligible SMEs on medium and long terms, with a variable relending rate within a range between \nthe weighted average cost of time deposit funds and the average cost of funds for 12 months or \nmore of the banking system as computed and informed by SBV at the end of each quarter. The \nsubsidiary loan will be for a period of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years. VBARD will \nrepay principal and interest in equal semiannual installments to the Borrower. The Borrower will \nbear the foreign exchange risk for the loan. \n \nBeginning  with  the  line  of  credit,  VBARD  will  establish  a  revolving  fund,  known  as  the \n63. \nAgro-industry SME Fund, totaling about $36 million equivalent (including $30 million equivalent \nof ADB financing) to onlend to eligible agro-industry SMEs. Proceeds from the repayment of the \nprincipal  from  the  subloans  will  be  used  to  maintain  the  revolving  fund  for  onlending  for  the \nsame purposes and under the same terms and conditions as those for onlending the ADB credit \ninitially.  VBARD  will  onlend  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  portion  designated  for  the  agro-industry \nSME credit line in local currency to eligible subborrowers at an interest rate that will cover cost \nof  funds,  operating  costs,  loan  loss,  and  interest  variation  risks.  VBARD  will  evaluate  all \nproposed enterprise subloans in accordance with its standard procedures, supplemented by  a \ncash-flow and debt-service analysis. The subloan maturity will be consistent with the projected \nsubloan implementation period and debt-service capacity.  \n \n\nc. \n\nSubloan Application and Approval \n\n64. \nAs  prescribed  in  its  loan  sanctioning  authority  policy,  VBARD  will  utilize  its  internal \ndiscretionary authorities for subloan approval. It is not envisaged that ADB\u2019s review of subloans \nfor approval is necessary, since almost all subloans will be within the authority of the district and \nprovincial branches to approve. For subloans above the authority of a VBARD provincial branch \n(D5  billion  or  $330,000  equivalent),  the  subloan  appraisals  will  be  evaluated  at  the  respective \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nhead  office  and  the  results  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  concurrence.  The  loan  will  be \nimplemented  in  rural  areas  of  Viet  Nam,  broadly  defined  to  include  communes,  villages,  and \nprovincial  and  district  towns  whose  economic  roles  and  functions  are  closely  linked  to \nagricultural  and  rural  enterprises.  Areas  inside  the  municipal  boundaries  of  the  major  cities  of \nHanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hai Phong, and Da Nang are excluded. Special consideration will be \ngiven to areas designated as the poorest in the country, with the objective of narrowing the gap \nin incomes and attaining sectoral and regional balance in growth. To ensure the effectiveness of \nVBARD,  the  Project  will  strengthen  it  through  training  in  lending  practices,  and  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation.  \n \n65. \nEach  new  or  current  subborrower  must  meet  the  following  minimum  criteria:  (i)  is  a \nlegally  established  SME  under  Vietnamese  law;  (ii)  if  a  current  borrower,  has  a  satisfactory \ncredit  history  with  no  current  arrears  or  rescheduled  borrowings;  (iii)  is  able  to  contribute  a \nminimum  of  20%  equity  to  the  subproject;  (iv)  is  a  potentially  profitable  and  environmentally \nsound rural or agro-based business primarily engaged in nonfarm activities (defined as activities \nthat  do  not  involve  primary  agricultural  production);  (v)  requires  medium  or  long-term  credit \nincluding  semipermanent  working  capital  for  business  start-up  or  growth;  (vi)  is  in  compliance \nwith the terms and conditions of any outstanding loan agreement; and (vii) is in  compliance with \nthe regulations of VBARD. \n \nEach subproject must meet the following minimum criteria: (i) is located in a rural area; \n66. \n(ii) has the potential for creating new employment; (iii) does not involve any land acquisition or \ninvoluntary resettlement effects; and (iv) will not have any adverse environmental consequence. \n \n\nd. \n\nProcurement \n\n67. \nSubborrowers will acquire goods and services for the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement  by  small  private  subborrowers  (paras.  3.08  and  3.09).  Procuring \nequipment  for  contracts  valued  at  less  than  $500,000  equivalent  will  follow  International \nshopping  procedures,  while  contracts  costing  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  will  involve  direct \npurchase. \n \n\ne. \n\nImplementation Period  \n\nThe project loan will be implemented over 3 years, 2003\u20132006. \n\n68. \n \n\nf. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n69. \nTo  ensure  effective  implementation  and  timely  disbursement  of  the  project  loan,  the \nBorrower will open a separate imprest account denominated in US dollars at a commercial bank \nto  be  designated  by  SBV,  within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  imprest  account  will  be \noperated  and  maintained  by  VBARD  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Loan \nDisbursements. ADB will advance 3 months of estimated expenditures into the imprest account \n(about  $2.5  million).19  Direct  foreign  exchange  payments  or  letters  of  credit,  as  well  as  local \ncurrency  expenditures  may  be  paid  out  of  the  imprest  account.  The  ADB  statement-of-\nexpenditure procedure will be used to liquidate and replenish the imprest account for contracts \nor  individual  payments  below  $50,000.  The  Mission  has  reviewed  the  accounting  systems  of \n\n                                                 \n19 The total advance to the imprest account at any point in time will not exceed the estimated expenditure of 6 months \n\nor 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nVBARD and considers them adequate for the purpose of ADB\u2019s imprest account and statement-\nof- expenditure procedures. \n \n\ng. \n\nAccounts, Audits, and Reports \n\n70. \nVBARD  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  the  loan  and  its  overall  operations  and \nmanagement. The reports will include information on (i) expenditure for the different subprojects, \nby industry and subsector; (ii) credit disbursement, recoveries, overdue loans, outstanding loans, \nand status of revolving fund under the loan; and (iii) physical progress of the investment activities, \nincluding compliance with covenants. \n \n71. \nVBARD  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts,  adequate  to  identify  goods  and \nservices  financed  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  to  disclose  the  use  thereof  in  the  project  loan \nfollowing  sound  accounting  principles.  VBARD  will  have  such  accounts  and  records  audited \nannually  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  will  submit,  within  9  months  of  the  close  of  the \nfinancial  year,  certified  copies  of  the  audit  report  together  with  the  auditor\u2019s  opinion,  to  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  The  imprest  account  and  VBARD  are  also  subject  to  annual  audit.  The \naudit  reports  should  include  a  separate  audit  opinion,  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and \nVBARD. Within 3 months after all subprojects are physically completed, VBARD will prepare and \nsubmit to ADB a project completion report, in a format acceptable to ADB, on the use and impact \nof the loan on the intended beneficiaries and the economy.  \n \n\nh. \n\nProject Performance Management System \n\nVBARD will carry out a baseline survey of a stratified sample of agro-industry SMEs that is \n72. \nrepresentative of the SME sector as a whole, within 3 months of loan effectiveness. VBARD will \nestablish and maintain the project performance management system that will include a database \nof subloans to agro-industry SMEs, and performance and recovery of subloans.  \n \n\ni. \n\nProject Review \n\n73. \nThe  Government,  VBARD,  and  ADB  will  carry  out  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  of \nproject implementation at the end of year 2 to evaluate actual physical and financial progress, \nand review the relative allocations of the loan to the VBARD credit line component, compliance \nwith  specific  covenants,  and  the  performance  of  the  PIU.  Using  this  review,  modifications  and \nimprovements to the Project will be made and implemented. ADB will carry out annual reviews \nthroughout the implementation of the loan. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n74. \nGiven  the  limited  growth  prospects  from  further  increased  use  of  physical  factors  and \nbasic intermediate inputs, growth in productivity through access to and application of improved \ntechnology, information, and capital for private sector SMEs is key to maintaining growth in Viet \nNam\u2019s  agriculture  sector.  Consequently,  the  strengthening  of  agricultural  research  and \nextension  through  policy  and  institutional  reforms  is  expected  to  contribute  significantly  to \nsustaining sector growth targets over the next 10 years. Due to the exogenous macroeconomic \nand microeconomic influences on Viet Nam\u2019s agriculture sector (e.g., time required for market \nand  land  reforms  to  take  full  effect,  and  sectorwide  effects  of  world  commodity  prices  and \nmarkets)  and  the  indirect  impacts  from  institutional  reforms  in  science  and  technology,  future \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\ncontributions  to  agricultural  growth  from  the  Program  cannot  be  forecast  quantitatively. \nNevertheless,  the  future  and  critical  roles  of  access  to  and  application  of  technology  and \ninformation  in  productivity  and  quality  improvements,  and  value  addition  by  farmers  and  agro-\nindustry  enterprises  in  Viet  Nam  are  demonstrated  in  program  preparation  studies.20  The \nimpressive sector growth over the past decade was largely achieved through increased use of \nlabor,  land,  basic  intermediate  inputs  (e.g.,  fertilizer),  irrigation,  and  machinery,  with  other \ntechnology accounting for only 4% of growth. With limited options for further increasing the use \nof  these  inputs,  future  growth  will  depend  on  growth  in  total  factor  productivity,  diversification, \nand quality and technology improvements. By more effectively identifying, testing, adapting, and \ndisseminating  new  and  appropriate  technologies  and  having  them  adopted  by  farmers  and \nenterprises, the Program will significantly contribute to the Government\u2019s annual growth targets \nof  4.5%  for  the  sector.  The  sector  growth  rate  required  to  equate  to  the  minimum  targeted \nincremental annual recurrent expenditure on research and extension of $5.5 million is less than \n0.01% per annum (i.e., the break-even growth rate), a small fraction of the targeted 4.5% sector \ngrowth rate. Similarly, total estimated adjustment costs from institutional reforms were less than \n1.3% of the sector GDP in 2000. \n \n75. \nBenefits to farmers and enterprises are likely to be realized through increased access to \nand  application  of  improved  technology.  These  benefits  include  (i)  increased  productivity  of \nexisting  areas  under  production;  (ii)  increased value  through  improved  quality  of commodities; \n(iii) lower risk and avoidance of production loss; (iv) incremental production and processing; (v) \nincreased net farm incomes and enterprise gross profits; and (vi) increased employment of rural \npeople, including the poor. These increases are attributed to (i) acquisition and development of \ntechnologies  by  the  research  institutes;  (ii)  more  effective  dissemination  to  farmers  by \nagricultural extension agents, input suppliers, and traders; and (iii) farmers\u2019 improved capacity to \nrespond  to  markets  due  to  access  to  better  market  information  and  understanding  of  market \nopportunities. The full benefits of a rationalized and cost-effective research system that is more \noriented  to  market  trends  and  farmer  needs,  and  an  expanded  and  participatory  extension \nsystem  are  likely  to  be  realized  in  the  medium  term.  However,  acquisition  and  transfer  of \nexisting  proven  technologies  could  result  in  early  benefits.  Expanded  and  better  targeted \nservices  resulting  from  the  reforms  will  benefit  subsistence,  semicommercial,  and  commercial \nfarmers  in  irrigated,  rain-fed,  and  mountainous  areas.  In  addition,  expanded  support  services, \nwhile  requiring  additional  overall  fiscal  resources,  will  be  more  cost-effective  due  to  service \nrationalization  (e.g.,  reducing  the  number  of  research  institutes),  will  reduce  overheads  and \nduplication  of  services  and  expenditure  reallocation  (e.g.,  from  national  research  institutes  to \nregional and commodity- or disciplinary-specific institutes).  \n \n76. \nThe  provision  of  increased  funding  to  research,  extension,  market  information  systems, \nand  capital  for  value-adding  agro-industry  SMEs  will  facilitate  accelerated  investment  in  agro-\nindustry  and  the  adoption  of  new  technologies  crucial  to  their  success  in  a  competitive \nenvironment. Policy makers in Viet Nam see the rapid expansion of SMEs in the rural sector as an \neffective and largely neglected mechanism to increase employment and expand growth through \nprivate  investments.  The  growth  of  rural  SMEs  will  foster  crop  diversification,  agroprocessing, \ngood-quality  products,  and  exports.  These  SMEs  share  a  large  unmet  demand  for  credit  as \ndemonstrated in program preparation studies (footnotes 18 and 20, and the analysis of demand \nfor SME credit). The most effective conduit for providing agro-industry SME credit is VBARD with \nits  current  SME  operations  through  its  effective  network  of  over  1,600  rural  branch  offices  and \n25,000  employees.  Access  to  appropriate  medium-  and  long-term  funds  will  encourage \n\n                                                 \n20 Explaining  Agricultural  Growth  in  Vietnam  (Que  and  Goletti)  and  Rural  Industrialization  and  Agro-Processing  in \n\nVietnam (Smith, Goletti, and Dung): Background papers prepared for ADB TA 3223-VIE, 2001. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nhousehold businesses in the informal sector to expand and eventually transform into registered \nenterprises,  which  would  enable  them  to  better  access  financial  resources.  Financial  and \neconomic  analyses  of  representative  agro-industry  SMEs  (including  agricultural  products \ntransport,  coffee  processing,  starch  processing,  noodle  processing,  longan  drying,  tapioca \nproduction,  agricultural  machinery  repair,  rice  milling  and  polishing,  tilling  and  grain  transport) \nindicate  good  returns  and  viability.  Financial  rates  of  return  for  indicative  enterprises  analyzed \nranged  from  15%  (for  agriculture  machinery  repairs)  to  45%  (for  coffee  processing).  The \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  ranged  from  29%  (for  rice  milling)  to  86%  (for  coffee \nprocessing).  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  subprojects  are  economically  viable  and  are \nrobust and able to withstand changes in revenue and cost levels. A typical SME will create an \naverage of four full-time jobs. The credit line will generate about 11,750 total full-time jobs in the \nrural areas.  \n \nB. \n\nImpacts \n\n77. \nThe  Program  will  continue  the  support  for  market  orientation  in  agriculture  that  the \nGovernment has embraced since doi moi. The Program will specifically target restructuring and \ninstitutional  building  in  science  and  technology  that  is  necessary  for  liberalization  and  market \norientation  to  have  sustainable  benefits.  For  the  high  levels  of  growth  achieved  in  the  past  to \ncontinue into the future, a new strategy for growth in agriculture should be developed. The new \nstrategy  should  be  based  on  the  application  of  science  and  technology  to  boost  productivity, \nparticularly of the poor, and vigorous promotion of private SMEs, particularly in agro-industry.  \n \n\n1. \n\nImpact of Agricultural Research Restructuring \n\n78. \nThe direct impacts of the Program will be changes to the structure and operations of the \nsystem  of  research  institutes  under  MARD.  These  changes  will  be  implemented  in  an \nincremental  fashion  in  the  course  of  the  Program.  The  long-term  impact  of  changes  to  the \nstructure and operations of the research institutes will be to build an effective and sustainable \nagricultural  research  system  able  to  contribute  to  the  generation  of  sustainable  technologies \nappropriate to the majority of farmers in Viet Nam.  \n \nChanges  in  structure  will  involve  merging  some  research  institutes,  redesignating  a \n79. \nnumber  of  institutes,  closing  some,  and  refocusing  research  effort  along  regional  and \ncommodity group-based lines. These changes in structure may have impacts on the staff of the \nresearch  institutes,  who  may  be  redesignated,  relocated,  or  even  retrenched.  Changes  in \noperations  of  the  institutes  will  include  increasing  the  level  of  funding  provided  by  the \nGovernment to support research, increasing the autonomy of the research institutes, decreasing \ntheir  commercial  nonresearch  activities,  and  increasing  the  linkages  between  research  and \nextension. The changes in the operations of the research institutes will have an impact on the \ncapacity of the research institutes to carry out efficient and timely research relevant to the needs \nof a variety of stakeholders in agriculture. \n \n\n2. \n\nImpact of Expansion of Market Information Systems \n\n80. \nReplicating the existing pilot ICARD market information systems and analysis for farmers \nand  private  sector  agro-industry  SMEs  is  expected  to  increase  farmers  and  SME  access  to \nknowledge,  and  ability  to  respond  to  existing  and  new  market  opportunities.  This  will  help \nreduce  the  current  overproduction  of  some  basic  commodities,  facilitate  greater  focusing  on \nuntapped  and  value-added  domestic  and  export  markets,  and  help  farmers  and  enterprises \nmeet the conditions of buyers in terms of price, quality, and supply consistency.  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\n \n\n3. \n\nImpact of Expansion and Refocus of Agricultural Extension  \n\n81. \nExpanding  and  restructuring  the  extension  system  will  have  a  number  of  short-  and \nmedium-term  impacts  on  extension  services  at  the  national,  provincial,  district,  and  commune \nlevels. Training for extension staff will go beyond its current narrow focus on technical aspects \nof  production  and  will  include  postharvest  activities,  marketing,  credit,  and  environmental \nprotection  and  sustainability.  Extension  staff  will  be  able  to  make  an  increased  number  of \ndemonstrations  to  farmers  and  visits  to  poor  farmers.  They  will  be  able  to  reach  farmers  over \nwider  agroecological, social,  and  ethnographic  ranges.  Participatory  mechanisms  for  planning, \nmonitoring, and evaluating extension activities through community-based participatory extension \napproaches will enable the extension service to move from an insular, top-down approach to a \nmore integrated, group-based, and bottom-up approach. \n \n82. \nIncreases in the number of female and ethnic minorities extension staff will allow better \nservice to these groups in the rural areas, where traditionally they have had little interaction with \nextension services and little opportunity to develop new technologies. The long-term impact of \nexpanding and refocusing the extension service will be a better trained extension service staff \nable to share with the majority of farmers, especially the poor, improved technologies and farm \nmanagement knowledge. \n \n\n4. \n\nImpact of Financial Support to Agro-industry SMEs \n\n83. \nThe  major  impact  of  financial  support  for  agroindustry  SMEs  will  be  the  establishment, \nthrough  VBARD,  of  commercial  credit  lines  for  medium-  and  long-term  loans.  The  loans  will \nassist  the  start-up  of  new  agro-industry  SMEs  and  encourage  the  expansion  of  existing  ones. \nThe long-term impact of financial support to agro-industry SMEs will be an expanded sector and \nimproved ability of agro-industry SMEs to compete in the domestic and international markets. In \naddition,  the  financial  position  of  VBARD  will  be  stronger,  as  the  Government  will  both \nrecapitalize  and  reimburse  VBARD  for  all  losses  VBARD  incurs  on  account  of  loans  made  to \nSOEs and priority sectors at the directive of the Government. VBARD\u2019s CAR will be raised and \nmaintained at a minimum of 8% of its risk assets. \n \n\n5. \n\nImpact of Seed Subsidy Phaseout \n\n84. \nSubsidies on the commercial production and sale of hybrid maize and rice seed will be \nphased out during the program period, to allow both provincial and national governments to use \nthe  funds  for  extension  and  related  training  activities.  Subsidies  will  no  longer  be  required \nbecause  the  seed  technologies  are  already  well  known  by  farmers  and  seed  companies  are \nproducing  and  selling  hybrid  seeds  throughout  the  country.  The  research  system  is  actively \nworking  on  new  hybrids  and  private  seed  companies  are  actively  involved  in  producing  and \nmarketing  hybrid  seeds.  This  setup is  expected  to  promote  the  adoption  of  hybrid  seeds,  with \nresulting increases in crop yields and productivity. Hybrid rice subsidies will continue, however, \nfor  poverty  reduction  programs  in  18  mountainous  provinces  to  help  meet  the  basic  food \nconsumption needs of poor and subsistence farmers. \n \n\n6. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impacts \n\nA  poverty  and  social  impact  assessment  was  conducted.  A  summary  poverty  reduction \n85. \nand  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  7.  The  poor  are  expected  to  benefit  in  several  ways  by \nincreasing  and  reallocating  expenditure  on  agricultural  research  that  is  more  farming  system \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nspecific  (e.g.,  subsistence,  semicommercial,  or  full  commercial),  farmer-oriented,  participatory, \ngeographically better targeted, and applicable to the needs of small and poor farmers. Research \noutputs  will  be  more  accessible,  relevant,  and  adoptable  with  the  effect  that  farm  productivity \nand subsequently farm household incomes will increase. Employment for the rural unemployed \nand  underemployed  is  expected  to  increase.  Linkages  with  the  rural  economy  in  general  are \nexpected  to  be  stimulated  through  an  increased  demand  for  agricultural  inputs  and  consumer \nproducts.  Wider  coverage  of  the  extension  service,  hiring  of  women  and  ethnic  minority \nextension agents, and the adoption of more participatory methods are expected to enhance the \ncoverage  of  poor  farmers,  and  address  the  needs  of  female  farmers  and  ethnic  minorities  in \nremote areas.  \n \n86. \nImproved  and  expanded  market  information  systems  for  agricultural  products  would \nincrease  access  to  fundamental  market  information,  empowering  poor  farmers  through  both \nbetter knowledge of prices and market opportunities when dealing with traders and buyers, and \nreduce the risks of farmers. As noted in Appendix 1, subsidies will continue on hybrid rice seeds \nfor  poverty  reduction  programs  and  for  basic  food  consumption  needs  in  remote  and \nmountainous  areas.  Clarifying  and  continuing  this  program  will  help  reduce  rural  poverty  and \nencourage  farmers  to  adopt  new  hybrid  technologies  for  sustainable  crop  production.  For  a \ngiven poor farm household, the price subsidy will be phased out progressively over a 1.5-year \nperiod,  thereby  reducing  dependence  and  ensuring  sustainability  of  rice  production  for \nsubsistence  needs.  The  loan  will  improve  rural  credit  supply  and  facilitate  the  development  of \nprivate agroprocessing SMEs in rural areas.  \n \n87. \nTaken together, these developments are expected to improve the competitiveness of the \nagriculture  sector  in  domestic  and  international  markets  and  contribute  to  a  positive  growth  in \nthe  sector  rate,  translating  into  income  growth  for  rural  producers,  including  the  poor.  Inter-\ntemporal assessment of the institutional reforms suggest short-term gains are more likely from \nthe  introduction  of  participatory  extension  services,  market  information,  and  application  of \nexisting or off-the-shelf technologies, while the full benefits from a restructured research system \nand expanded extension service are likely to occur in the medium term.  \n \n\n7. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n88. \nA  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  of  ASDP  is  in  Appendix  8.  The \nexamination  found  that  the  policies  and  activities  proposed  in  the  ASDP  are  intended  to \ngenerate economic growth and employment in a manner that will generally reduce pressures on \nthe  country\u2019s  natural  resource  base.  Consequently,  ASDP  will  help  curtail  overexploitation  of \nViet Nam's environment. Several proposed policy changes will promote increased efficiency of \nViet  Nam's  natural  resource  base  (e.g.,  terminating  unneeded  subsidies  on  rice  and  maize \nseeds,  ensuring  VBARD  uses  market  lending  rates,  and  establishing  an  AMIS).  Increased \nresource efficiency will ultimately lead to sustainable and protected rural areas. ASDP will also \npromote  policies  and  activities  that  increase  stakeholder  participation  in  planning  and \nimplementing agricultural development (e.g., establishing provincial extension advisory councils, \npreparing  joint  extension  plans,  and  employing  additional  extension  subject  matter  specialists \nand more women and ethnic minority staff). Increasing stakeholder participation is expected to \nhave a positive impact on agricultural sustainability, particularly those policies and activities that \nincrease  practical  and  value-added  extension  services  to  female,  poor,  and  ethnic  farmers. \nRestructuring  agricultural  research  institutes  and  instituting  competitive  research  grants  will \nhave  a  neutral  or  negative  impact  if  research  activities  consider  only  production  and  not \nenvironmental  sustainability.  For  this  reason,  the  SIEE  proposes  that  one  or  more  institutes \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nconduct  research  on  sustainable  agriculture,  and  disseminate  the  results  through  the  same \ninformation channels used for scientific results that originate from the research institutes.  \n \n89. \nThe proposed subprojects of the project loan focus on supporting value-added services \nthat  do  not  require  increases  in  landclearing  or  crop  productivity.  This  value-added  approach \nmeans  the  loan  will  generally  have  positive,  neutral,  or  mitigable  impacts  on  the  environment. \nHowever, VBARD's environmental policy framework to implement the loan is modest and credit \nofficers  have  little  training  on  environmental  protection  and  sustainability.  For  this  reason,  the \nSIEE  recommends  strengthening  both  VBARD's  environmental  policy  framework  and  the \ncapacity of credit officers to consider environmental impacts during the loan application process.  \n \n90. \nThe  environmental  examination  did  not  identify  any  significant  negative  environmental \nimpacts  that  cannot  be  mitigated.  Indeed,  the  loans  will  provide  greater  net  positive  impacts \nthan the without-loans alternative. None of the policy reforms or representative projects require \na category A assessment. No further studies are required to complement the SIEE. The SIEE \nhas recommendations to maximize the positive impacts of ASDP and monitor the effectiveness \nof the mitigation measures. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\nThe major risk of ASDP is possible implementation delays leading to possible delays in \n91. \nthe release of the second and third tranches. ASDP has been designed to minimize the risk of \nlack  of  ownership  and  commitment  by  incorporating  the  following  measures:  (i)  during  the \npreparation of ASDP, a highly consultative process was followed to ensure that the views of all \nthe  stakeholders  (including  the  Government,  farmers,  private  sector  representatives,  and \nNGOs)  are  incorporated  in  the  final  report.  Four  participatory  workshops  were  held  in  four \nprovinces  to  discuss  the  findings  of  the  TA;  (ii)  during  the  processing  of  ASDP,  intensive \ndiscussions  were  held  between  ADB  and  the  concerned  Government  agencies  to  reach  an \nagreement on the policy package; and (iii) the draft development policy letter and policy matrix \nwere  thoroughly  reviewed  with  all  the  concerned  Government  agencies  at  each  stage  of  loan \nprocessing.  Multiple  stakeholders\u2014government,  mass  organization,  NGO,  and  the  private \nsector\u2014will  be  involved  in  the  program  steering  committee  and  the  provincial  extension \nadvisory councils. \n \n92. \nIn  consultation  with  stakeholders,  the  program  design  features  fewer  but  carefully \nchosen essential measures to make implementation of ASDP easier, given the complexity and \ncommitment  needed  to  reach  agreement  and  implement  changes  through  Vietnamese \nadministration. The policy matrix now focuses on two major areas (science and technology, and \nagro-industry  development),  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  priorities  for  the  sector  and  ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy for Viet Nam.  \n \n93. \nFurthermore,  ASDP  has  been  designed  to  reduce  delays  through  the  following \nmeasures: (i) the ADB loan will be released in three tranches, about 18 months apart; this will \ngive a longer time for dialogue between ADB and the Government, give the Government more \ntime  to  implement  the  reforms  and  promote  ownership  of  the  policies  among  the  various \nstakeholders with different interests; (ii) consulting services through an advisory TA have been \nincluded to strengthen the capacity of the Government to implement the program loan; and (iii) a \nsteering  committee  comprising  senior  staff  from  all  the  concerned  ministries  and  agencies  will \nbe established to oversee program implementation and the policy reforms. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n94. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  (for  the  program  loan)  and \nVBARD (for the project loan) have given the following assurances, which will be incorporated in \nthe legal documents: \n \n\n1. \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n2. \n\nThe Project Loan \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  Government  will  (a)  maintain  the  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken \nprior to the date of the Loan Agreement for the program loan, as described \nin the development policy letter and the policy matrix, for the duration of the \nASDP  loan  and  subsequently;  (b)  promptly  adopt  the  other  policies  and \ntake  the  other  actions  included  in  ASDP  as  specified  in  the  development \npolicy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix;  and  (c)  ensure  that  such  policies  and \nactions  continue  in  effect  for  the  duration  of  the  program  loan  period  and \nsubsequently.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  annual  budget  allocations  are  made,  so \nthat the counterpart funds required for project implementation are available \non time.  \n\nThe Government will ensure that other counterpart requirements, including \nadequate  office  space  and  support  services  for  the  PIUs,  are  provided \nduring program and project implementation. \n\nSubprojects  will  be  carried  out \nin  accordance  with  all  applicable \nenvironmental  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government  and  with  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  policies  and  procedures,  and  that  subprojects  will  (a)  have \napproved  waste  disposal  plans,  (b) not  involve  acquisition  or  involuntary \nresettlement, or (c) not use loan funds to purchase land.  \n\nExternal  auditors  will  be  engaged  to  audit  project  accounts,  including  the \nimprest  account  and  VBARD.  The  annual  audited  accounts  and  financial \nstatements, together with audit reports, in English, will be submitted within \n9 months following the end of the relevant Government fiscal year. \n\nThe  modified  CAR  of  core  capital  (defined  as  paid-up  capital,  retained \nearnings,  and  reserves,  excluding  reserves  for  bad  debts,  divided  by \nweighted  risk  assets  [defined  as  total  assets,  less  loan  loss  provisions \nand risk-free assets]) will be at least 4% by 2005. VBARD will achieve the \ntarget of a minimum CAR of 8% on total equity on or before 31 December \n2010.  \n\nThe  proceeds  of  the  credit  line  will  not  be  used  to  finance  SOEs  or \nequitized enterprises where the Government has majority control. \n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of the legal documents and except as \nADB  may  otherwise  agree,  once  the  aggregate  amount  of  disbursement \nto  the  credit  line  reaches  50%  of  the  total  credit  line,  no  further  subloan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nwill  be  approved  and  no  disbursements  will  be  made  for  new  subloans \nuntil  a  special  financial  review  mission  of  ADB  will  have  carried  out  a \nfinancial review of VBARD\u2019s operations in this regard, and an agreement \nis  reached  between  ADB,  VBARD,  and  the  Government  regarding  the \nrecommendations of this mission.  \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB \n\n95. \nand recommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 44,876,000 to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Agriculture Sector Development Program \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 24 years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement \npresented to the Board; and \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 22,438,000 to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Agriculture Sector Development Project \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements presented to the Board. \n\n21 November 2002 \n \n\nTadao Chino \nPresident \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nSECTOR AND SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nPast Performance \n\n \n1. \nAgriculture plays a dominant role in the economy of Viet Nam, as it accounts for about \n30% of gross domestic product (GDP), 70% of employment, and 50% of export value. Although \nthese shares will decline over the coming years as they have done slowly over the past decade, \nthe  agriculture  sector  will  remain  at  the  core  of  the  country\u2019s  economy  in  the  next  decade. \nFurther,  since  poverty  is  mainly  a  rural  problem,  attacking  poverty  and  promoting  economic \ngrowth and national development will be critical challenges for agriculture. At the same time, a \nmajor  challenge  is  stimulating  growth  in  investment  and  off-farm  employment  through  private \nsector industries and other rural enterprises. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  past  performance  of  the  agriculture  sector  over  the  last  15  years  since  the \nintroduction  of  doi  moi  (economic  reform)  in  1986  has  been  impressive.  Growth  in  agriculture \naveraged  4.3%  of  GDP  during  1980-1990,  and  increased  to  4.9%  of  GDP  during  1990\u20131999. \nThis  growth  was  higher  than  that  in  India,  Indonesia,  Philippines,  and  Thailand,  and  was \ncomparable  with  agricultural  growth  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  The  value  of \nagricultural  exports  rose  from  $1.1  billion  in  1990  to  $4.3  billion  in  1998.  The  sources  of \nagricultural growth were large increases in yields and production of rice, maize, industrial crops, \nfruits,  vegetables,  livestock,  and  seafood.  These  gains  were  attributed  to  policy  reforms  in \nmarkets,  land  and  trade,  widespread  use  of  improved  seeds  (including  hybrid  seed)  and \nlivestock breeds, heavy application of fertilizers and pesticides, and large-scale investments in \nirrigation and road infrastructure. The Mekong River Delta and Red River Delta are the two main \nareas  that  experienced  rapid  agricultural  growth  and  improvement  in  farm  incomes  since  they \nare well served by irrigation and road infrastructure, banking services, and agricultural support \nservices.  Other  areas,  particularly  the  northern  uplands,  the  interior  of  the  north  central  coast, \nand  northern  part  of  the  central  highlands,  experienced  much  slower  growth,  and  therefore \nsuffer from a high level of poverty.  \n \n\n1. \n\nCrop Subsector \n\n \n3. \nThe crop subsector is the largest subsector contributing about 64% of the total output in \nagriculture,  followed  by  livestock  (18%),  fisheries  (14%),  and  forestry  (4%).1  In  the  crop \nsubsector, rice dominates agricultural output since it accounts for about 7.3 million hectares (ha) \nor 60% of agricultural land, 44% of household agricultural revenue, 75% of calorific intake, and \n30% of agricultural exports. During 1990-1998, rice production increased from 19.2 million tons \nto  29.1  million  tons,  an  increase  of  about  4.3%  per  annum.  This  increase  was  attributed  to \nincreases  in  both  yields  (2.7%  per  annum)  and  cropping  intensity  (2.0%  per  annum).  The \nMekong River Delta provides about 52% of total rice production in the country and is the main \nsource  of  rice  exports,  whereas  all  other  regions  are  either  self-sufficient  or  rice-deficit  areas. \nHowever,  yields in the Mekong River Delta have been stagnant at about 4 tons per ha during \nthe past 5 years, suggesting that agricultural intensification in the region has caused soil fertility \nto decline. \n \n4. \nAnother  important  food  crop  is  maize,  which  is  widely  grown  in  upland  areas.  During \n1990-1998, maize production increased by 8.9% per annum, from 0.7 million tons to 1.6 million \ntons  resulting  from  an  increase  in  yields  (6%)  and  cropped  area  (4.8%).  The  average  yield  of \nmaize at about 3.1 tons per ha is low, considering that 63% of the total maize area is planted to \n                                                 \n1  The discussion in this paper will be confined to the crop subsector, given the Program\u2019s focus on it. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n29 \n\nthe  country\u2019s  external \n\nhybrid maize. This low yield suggests the presence of serious problems related to the quality of \nthe hybrid maize seeds available to farmers since good-quality hybrid maize seed can produce \nup to 6\u20138 tons per ha. The production of other food crops (cassava and sweet potato) is much \nsmaller, but plays an important role in upland agriculture.  \n \n5. \nThe production of industrial crops has increased rapidly in recent years in both area and \nyield. A large part of the output is destined for export. These commodities play an important role \nin  reducing \ntrade  deficit,  crop  diversification,  providing  unique \nopportunities  to  different  regions  to  display  their  respective  potentials  and  comparative \nadvantages,  increasing  incomes,  and  improving  living  standards.  Coffee,  the  second  largest \nexport crop, has expanded more than 20% per year over the 1990s. During 1990-1998, coffee \nproduction tripled from 92,000 tons to 272,000 tons, as a result of increases in both area and \nyield. However, the recent sharp reduction in world coffee prices has adversely affected coffee \nproduction.  Rubber  (the  third  largest  export  crop)  has  expanded  from  58,000  tons  in  1990  to \n200,000 tons in 1998 at an annual growth rate of 12% per year. Cashew nuts, the fourth largest \nexport crop, has grown at more than 10% per year since 1990. Cashew nut output in 1998 was \nestimated at 386,000 tons. Black tea output, largely for export, has grown at 9% per year, while \ngreen tea production (mainly for domestic consumption) has grown slowly. Pepper is grown on \njust 12,000 ha; but because of its high value, it generates about $60 million in export revenue, \nmaking  it  the  fifth  largest  export.  During  1990-1998,  sugarcane  production  increased  from  5.3 \nmillion  tons  to  13.8  million  tons.  The  country,  however,  has  no  comparative  advantage  in \ngrowing  sugarcane.  The  large  increase  in  sugarcane  production,  primarily  in  the  south,  is \nattributable  to  the  high  import  barriers  on  refined  sugar.  This  protectionist  policy  benefits \nsugarcane growers and sugar mills at the expense of consumers and food processors that use \nsugar. \n \n6. \nDuring  the  last  few  years,  the  production  of  fruits  and  vegetables  has  also  increased \nrapidly  to  meet  the  rising  demand  among  high-income  urban  consumers  and  export  markets. \nThis development is contributing to farm income, public health and well-being, and agricultural \ndiversification. Vegetable production has grown 6% per year. Citrus output has expanded three-\nfold  since  1990,  while  the  production  of  longan,  rambutan,  and  litchi  has  grown  at  over  20% \nsince  1995.  On  the  other  hand,  pineapple  output  has  fallen  by  over  40%  with  the  loss  of  the \nEastern European export markets, while banana production has stagnated. The total area under \nvegetables was estimated at 401,000 ha, while the total area under fruits reached 438,000 ha in \n1998. Although fruit and vegetable exports have increased slowly in volume (1% annually since \n1990),  the  export  value  has  risen  quickly  (15%  annually),  reflecting  a  shift  to  higher-value \nproducts. The total value of fruits and vegetable exports in 2000 was estimated at $210 million. \n \n\n2. \n\nAgricultural Research \n\n \nThe  present  system  of agricultural  research  in Viet  Nam  consists  of  37  institutions  and \n7. \n12  agricultural  universities  under  five  ministries  with  overlapping  functions,  limited  scientific \ncoordination and cooperation, and uneven geographical distribution. The Ministry of Agriculture \nand  Rural  Development  (MARD)  remains  the  main  ministry  in  charge  of  agricultural  research \nsince it supervises about 86% of the research institutes and 2 of the 12 agricultural universities. \nMost  of  the  institutes  are  located  in  the  Red  River  Delta  and  the  Mekong  River  Delta.  Many \nprovinces do not have easy access to any local research institutions. Centralization of research \nactivities and management makes it difficult for the institutes to address poverty reduction and \nenvironmental  sustainability  issues.  The  institutes  are  also  underfunded.  In  2000,  public \nexpenditure  for  agricultural  research  was  D245  billion  ($16  million).  Given  that  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nagricultural GDP for 2000 was estimated at D100 trillion ($7 billion), the spending of MARD on \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nagricultural  research  in  that  year  amounted  to  only  0.25%  of  agricultural  GDP.  This  is  low \ncompared  with  that  in  Thailand  (1.40%),  Malaysia  (1.06%),  and  the  PRC  (0.43%).  Compared \nwith  D3  trillion  spent  on  science  and  technology  by  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology \n(MOST) in 2000, the contribution to the agricultural research institutes represents only 5% of the \nMOST\u2019s  budget.  In  2002,  agricultural  research  was  allocated  a  budget  of  D297  billion  ($20 \nmillion), an increase of about 20% over the 2000 allocation. But this level of funding is still low \ncompared with that for Viet Nam\u2019s neighbors and competitors.  \n \n8. \nThe  quality  and  qualifications  of  agricultural  researchers  are  below  international \nstandards. Of the total research staff of 7,600 in MARD, only 12% have a PhD or MSc degree, \nand  the  remaining  88%  have  either  only  a  BSc  degree  or  no  university  degree.  Research \nfacilities  that  have  deteriorated  due  to  lack  of  funding  and  maintenance  also  need  to  be \nupgraded  and  modernized  to  meet  future  challenges.  The  linkage  between  research  and \nextension is weak because the research institutes are extremely centralized, on-farm research \nis  not  undertaken  in  a  participatory  manner  with  extension  staff  and  farmers,  and  the  links \nbetween researchers and the grassroots extension staff are poor. Many research institutes are \nmore involved in commercial production, such as the production of  certified seeds, rather than \nresearch activities. In 2000, about D22 billion or 14% of the total research budget was allocated \nfor  seed  production.  Agricultural  research  must  be  reorganized,  strengthened,  and  reoriented \ntoward  the  production  of  technology  packages  that  promote  agricultural  diversification  and \nlivestock,  processing \nindustrial  crops,  vegetables, \nintensification.  Research  on \ntechnologies, and marketing is important. \n \n9. \nPrivate  sector  research  is  very  limited  at  present.  Policies,  such  as  tax  incentives  and \nless government interference, will have limited impact in promoting private research. However, \npolicies that encourage (i) privatization or equitization of research institutes managed by state-\nowned  enterprises  (SOEs),  (ii)  collaboration  with  and  funding  from  both  public  sector  and \ninternational research centers, (iii) autonomy of agricultural research institutes to obtain funding \nfrom  the  private  sector,  and  (iv)  protection  of  intellectual  property  rights  will  help  stimulate \nprivate involvement in research. \n \n\nfruits, \n\n3. \n\nAgricultural Extension \n\n \n10. \nThe  current  national  agricultural  extension  consists  of  central,  provincial,  district,  and \ncommune  units.  At  the  central  level,  the  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  Extension \n(DAFE)  has  overall  responsibility  for  coordinating,  planning,  monitoring,  evaluating,  and \nbudgeting agricultural extension for the whole country. DAFE has also been given administrative \nand  regulatory  roles  in  managing  national  agricultural  production.  These  roles  pose  a  major \nconstraint  to  the  effective  functioning  of  DAFE  as  a  national  extension  agency.  The  provincial \ngovernment  is  responsible  for  implementing  extension  through  its  district  and  commune \nextension networks.  \n \n11. \nThe  national  extension  service  suffers  from  a  scarcity  of  staff  and  limited  financial \nresources.  The  total  number  of  extension  staff  in  the  country  is  about  8,000.  Given  that  there \nare about 10.7 million farmers in the country, the ratio of extension staff to number of farmers is \nonly 1:1,340. About 50% of the communes do not have any extension staff. In 2002, the total \nbudget  for  agricultural  extension  was  about  D441  billion  ($29  million)  comprising  D66  billion \nfrom the central government, and D375 billion from the provincial governments (largely from the \ncollection of land tax). Although this budget is D83 billion ($5.5 million) higher from the previous \nyear\u2019s budget, it is still low to meet the requirements for effective agricultural extension. Most of \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n31 \n\nthe budget is used to pay the salaries and wages of extension staff, leaving a very small amount \nto finance the costs of staff travel, field tours, training, and demonstration plots. \n \n12. \nAgricultural extension in the country is characterized by a top-down approach in dealing \nwith  farmers,  insufficient  knowledge  and  skills  in  effective  communication  and  new  proven \ntechnologies,  weak  linkages  with  agricultural  research  and  universities,  and  ineffective  use  of \nmass  media  and  communications.  Making  extension  services  effective  in  promoting  the \nintensification and diversification of agriculture will require a reorientation to respond to farmers\u2019 \nneeds,  rather  than  fulfill  production  targets.  Private  sector  training  of  extension  workers  in \nparticipatory  approaches,  communication  skills,  postharvest  activities,  marketing,  and  rural \nfinance  is  an  important  part  of  the  reorientation  process.  To  improve  the  delivery  of  improved \nvarieties  and  technologies  to  farmers,  funding  agencies  and  international  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) have taken a number of initiatives to strengthen agricultural extension in \nthe  country.  Most  of  the  recent  efforts  have  focused  on  developing  innovative  extension \nmethodologies, given the shortage of funding and manpower in agricultural extension. Of the six \nmethodologies tested during the past 5 years, the extension club methodology is probably the \nmost  attractive  since  the  approach  is  simple,  well  understood,  and  low  cost.  MARD  plans  to \nadopt this approach and replicate it in different parts of the country. \n \n\n4. \n\nMarket Information \n\n13. \nThe Information Center for Agriculture and Rural Development (ICARD), established in \n1997, distributes on a limited basis agriculture prices and market information. The mandate of \nICARD  is  to  (i)  collect,  review,  and  analyze  the  available  information  and  make  it  available  to \nMARD  for  formulating  strategy  and  policies  for  the  sector;  (ii)  review  and  analyze  commodity \nand market information and make it available to public and private individuals and organizations \nwho may use it for decisions related to production and marketing or in formulating policies; (iii) \nreview  science  and  technology  information  arising  within  MARD  or  elsewhere  and  make  it \navailable  to  public  and  private  agencies  as  needed;  (iv)  review  information  on  international \ncooperation  in  the  sector  and  make  it  available  to  interested  agencies;  and  (v)  participate  in \ntrade promotion activities in agriculture. In implementing the mandate, ICARD aims to maintain \nan information stream that is kept current and is channeled to end users by all available routes. \nTo  do  this,  ICARD  has  a  staff  of  45  (29  persons  with  the  BS  degree  and  5  with  postgraduate \ndegrees)  organized  into  divisions  for  library,  publications,  market  information,  and  trade \npromotion.  \n\n14. \nICARD  is  currently  developing  a  MARD  web  site  (www.agroviet.gov.vn)  to  give \ninformation  on  commodities  and  trade  in  agricultural  and  forestry  products.  The  web  site  is \naimed  at  businesses  and  individuals  who  are  engaged  in  agricultural  production  or  trade  and \nuse  the  information  as  a  guide  in  decision  making.  It  is  of  interest  to  both  consumers  and \ninvestors.  Information  on  markets,  policies,  science  and  technology,  product  quality,  and \nprograms  with  potential  impact  on  agriculture  and  rural  developments  will  be  available  at  this \nsite and will be upgraded regularly. ICARD has established a continually updated database on \nagricultural  policies,  extension  information,  area  devoted  to  various  major  crops  and  output, \nprices of 10 key export commodities, and much more. \n\n15. \nIn  pilot  studies  financed  by  the  Swedish  International  Development  Agency,  ICARD \ntested procedures for disseminating information to extension workers, and market retailers and \nwholesalers  at  different  levels,  and  directly  to  farmers  at  the  commune  level.  ICARD  first \nsurveyed a number of test communes and villages to determine what kind of information would \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nprobably  be  of  interest  to  them;  it  then  proceeded  to  gather  the  appropriate  information  and \ndisseminated  it  by  bulletin  and  chalkboards  and  through  newspapers.  Dissemination  was \nfollowed  by  a  survey  of  farmers  to  see  how  many  had  received  the  information.  In  the  first \nattempt,  somewhat  less  than  half  the  potential  recipients  actually  received  the  information.  Of \nthose receiving the information on the first pass, 37% said it was useful to them. In subsequent \nsurveys of a similar type, ICARD was able to reach 80% or more of the target population, the \ngreat  majority  of  whom  reported  that  the  information  was  useful.  Although  many  of  the  target \ngroups  found  the  information  in  a  newspaper,  the  bulletin board  route  was  the  best.  This  was \ntrue for planners and other nonfarmer groups as well. \n\n16. \nICARD  plans  to  expand  the  pilot  study  into  a  model  representative  of  six  ecological \nzones  of  the  country.  It  would  include  locality-based  information  and  a  market  for  farmers \nthrough which bulletin board material could be relayed to districts and transferred to communes. \nEventually  this  should  be  developed  into  a  nationwide  system.  Increasingly  the  material \ntransmitted will include commodity quality information. In addition, ICARD will improve its rural \nstatistics database and market analysis capability with assistance from the World Bank.2 \n\n5. \n\nSeed Subsidies \n\n \n17. \nThere  are  three  types  of  subsidy  on  hybrid  seeds:  (i)  a  subsidy  from  the  provincial \ngovernments  for  the  commercial  production  of  hybrid  rice  and  maize  seeds  in  four  provinces; \n(ii) a subsidy from the national Government, implemented through DAFE, for a pilot program in \n10 provinces to encourage farmers to grow and sell hybrid rice seeds to seed companies; and \n(iii)  a  poverty  reduction  program  administered  by  the  provincial  governments  to  provide \nsubsidized hybrid rice seeds to poor and subsistence farmers in 18 mountainous provinces. The \ntotal amount spent on these subsidies in 2002 was $4.5 million equivalent: (i) $1.3 million for the \nprovincial commercial production program, (ii) $0.5 million for the national pilot program, and (iii) \n$2.7 million for the provincial poverty reduction program. \n \n18. \nViet  Nam  currently  produces  over  50%  of  its  hybrid  maize  seed  requirements \ndomestically, so there is agreement within the Government that subsidies are no longer needed \nto  promote  its  commercial  production.  The  rationale  for  the  subsidies  on  the  commercial \nproduction  of  hybrid  rice  seeds  is  (i)  import  substitution  to  reduce  dependence  on  imported \nChinese  rice  hybrid  seeds,  and  (ii)  price  stabilization  to  counter  occasional  high  prices  in  the \nPRC. Viet Nam currently plants about 17,000 tons of hybrid rice seed yearly, but produces only \n2,500\u20133,000 tons of hybrid seed domestically. The balance is imported from the PRC, usually \nthe  male  and  female  lines  of  relatively  low-yielding  hybrids  from  private  seed  companies. \nCommercial seed companies in Viet Nam then cross these lines and the resulting hybrid seed is \nsold in domestic markets. The current price of imported hybrid rice seed is about $1,300 per ton \nand the 2002 import bill was about $22 million. The current price of hybrid seed grown in Viet \nNam is about 20% less than the import price. The Government's objective is to produce about \n50%  of  total  domestic  demand  by  2005  (about  10,000  tons).  In  addition  to  promoting \ncommercial  production  of  hybrid  rice  seed,  for  which  subsidies  will  end  in  2003,  MARD  has \nbeen financing a pilot extension program whereby farmers are provided free hybrid seeds, seed \ntreatments,  and  training.  Seed  companies  choose  these  farmers,  and  the  national  extension \nservice  gives  the  farmer  inputs  and  training  for  2\u20133  years  to  grow  seeds  for  sale  to  seed \ncompanies.  This  program  is  being  promoted  in  10  provinces  where  yields  are  highest.  The \n\n                                                 \n2   Strengthening Capacity in Rural Statistics, for $396,000 grant assistance during 2002-2003. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n33 \n\nGovernment  agreed  that  the  pilot  program  on  hybrid  rice  seeds  will  be  phased  out  during  the \nprogram period. \n \n19. \nThe  major  rationale  for  promoting  hybrid  rice  to  poor  and  subsistence  farmers  is  that \nhybrid  rice  seed  outyields  ordinary  open-pollinated  rice  varieties  by  about  2:1  in  mountainous \nareas  where  the  poorest  subsistence  farmers  are  located.  Such  seeds  are  suitable  for  small \nlandholdings  (the  average  size  is  500  square  meters).  MARD  has  estimated  that  doubling  the \ncrop  yield  for  subsistence  farmers  in  mountainous  areas  can  reduce  an  average  of  2  ha  of \nslash-and-burn  agriculture  for  every  hectare  of  land  planted  to  hybrid  rice  or  maize.  The  rice \nsubsidy for a poor farmer is spread over three crop seasons (the average is two rice crops per \nyear) and comprises 100% of the price for the first rice crop, 50% for the second crop, 30% for \nthe third crop, and 0% for the fourth crop onward. Poor farmers are usually able to sustain rice \nproduction after the termination of the subsidy since the quantity of hybrid rice seed required is \nso small: an average of 2 kilograms of rice seed, costing about $2 (equivalent to the price of two \nchickens). This poverty reduction program is financed entirely from the provincial budgets in 16 \nnorthern provinces and 2 central provinces. \n \n\n6. \n\nRural Finance \n\n \n20. \nEven though the three major rural financial institutions in Viet Nam, namely, the Vietnam \nBank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD), the Viet Nam Bank for the Poor (VBP), \nand  the  People\u2019s  Credit  Funds  (PCF),  have  made  considerable  progress  in  outstanding  loans \ngrowth, the  needs of rural households for credit are still largely unmet. The country\u2019s financial \nsystem  consists  of  the  formal,  semiformal,  and  informal  sectors.  The  formal  sector  reaches \nabout  one  third  of  rural  households  with  a  small  average  loan  size  (about  $300)  and  a  short \nrepayment  period  (less  than  1  year).  The  remaining  rural  households  obtain  their  credit  from \nsemiformal and informal sources. Less than one half of the larger and commercial farmers are \nable  to  obtain  credit  in  a  given  year.  Other  constraints  limiting  the  emergence  of  a  more \ndeveloped rural finance system include the weak link between land and credit markets, interest \nrate controls, subsidized credit, favored treatment of SOEs, and prohibition on foreign banks to \nenter the land-mortgage market. \n \n21. \nEven though land can be used as collateral in accessing bank credit, in practice this is \nnot  yet  resulting  in  expanded  rural  credit.  Banks  limit  the  collateral  to  the  amount  of  land  rent \nalready paid, implying that only insignificant amounts can be borrowed against the collateral. If \nthe borrower cannot repay the debt, banks find themselves in a very difficult position to auction \nthe  land. This  situation greatly  limits  the link  between  credit  and land markets  and  retards  the \nexpansion of rural credit. \n \n22. \nControl  of  interest  rates  on  loans  and  deposits  prevents  the  financial  system  from \nfunctioning  effectively.  When  interest  rates  on  deposits  are  limited,  banking  institutions  find  it \ndifficult to mobilize savings. The liberalization of interest rates from June 2002 and the resultant \nincrease  in  VBARD  interest  rates  will  improve  VBARD\u2019s  financial  performance,  and  raise \nincome and profitability.  \n \n23. \nThe practice of subsidizing credit to the poor may inhibit the development of commercial \nbanking and the emergence of durable financial institutions in remote areas. Subsidized credit is \nwidely practiced by VBP, NGOs, mass organizations, and to some extent by VBARD in some of \nits  programs.  Experience  with  microfinance  for  the  poor  from  Bangladesh  and  other  countries \nsuggest that a sustainable system could be developed using market interest rates. The dramatic \nincrease in PCF\u2019s lending program is probably the best evidence for the argument that there is \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nFuture Challenges \n\nlatent  demand  for  credit  at  higher  interest  rates  and  that  rural  financial  institutions  can  grow \nwithout subsidized interest rates. Interest rates charged by  PCF are higher than what VBARD \ncharges (1.2-1.3% for PCF versus 0.9-1.1% per month for VBARD). \n \n24. \nFavored  treatment  for  SOEs  in  rural  credit  does  not  bode  well  for  expanding  credit  to \nrural households. Allocating credit to SOEs on the basis of directives from the central level has \ncaused serious loan recovery problems for the commercial banking system as in the case of the \nsugar  industry.  Moreover,  giving  preferential  treatment  to  SOEs  restricts  access  to  credit  of \nmillions of rural households, and small- and medium-sized enterprises. Within the central SOEs \nengaged in agriculture, about 17% incurred losses in 1998 with an average loss of D8.4 billion. \nSupport  given  to  loss-incurring  SOEs  results in  unfair  competition  between  private  enterprises \nand  SOEs,  and  discourages  the  private  sector  from  investing  in  areas  where  SOEs  are \ndominant. \n \nB. \n \n25. \nAgricultural growth in Viet Nam over the past 15 years was the result of a combination of \n(i) institutional factors such as new incentive to farmers recognized by doi moi as autonomous \neconomic  agents;  (ii)  physical  factors  such  as  land,  labor,  and  capital  (mostly  in  the  form  of \nirrigation  system);  and  (iii)  intermediate  inputs  such  as  fertilizers  and  pesticides.  The  role  of \nscience and technology in explaining growth over the past 15 years has been relatively small, \nsince most of the growth could be explained by increasing factors of production. This strategy is \nunlikely to sustain similar growth in the future for three reasons: (i) the labor force in agriculture \nis starting to decline and with very little land available per farmer, the attractiveness of farming \nwill decline further; (ii) new investment in irrigation exhibits decreasing marginal returns as the \nstock  of  irrigation  capital  is  already  very  high  and  requires  increased  repair  and  maintenance \nrather  than  new  expansion,  (iii)  Viet  Nam  has  already  captured  a  large  share  of  world  rice \nmarkets  so  that  both  domestic  and  international  demand  for  rice  will  start  to  grow  at  a  much \nlower rate than in the past.  \n \n26. \nFuture  sustained  growth  in  agriculture  will  have  to  come  from  an  increasing  demand \n(both in the country and internationally) for high-value agricultural products. That implies a more \ndiversified  agricultural  system,  where  a  variety  of  high-quality  products  are  produced  for  the \nmarket. This will also imply a change from a perspective that is focused on production volume to \nincreasing  production  values.  Future  agricultural  growth  will  also  require  a  policy  environment \nthat promotes competition and uses science and technology applied to agricultural production to \nmeet  the  demand  of  a  more  sophisticated  market.  Policy  reforms  are  required  to  address  the \nweaknesses  in  agricultural  research,  agricultural  extension,  and  rural  finance.  Competition  will \nbe necessary to lower production cost and thus capture higher market shares and profits in the \ninternational  markets.  Science  and  technology  will  be  necessary  to  identify  new  production \nprocesses and innovative products that can increase productivity in the agricultural system to a \nmuch  larger  extent  than  addition  of  labor,  irrigated  land,  and  fertilizers.  Developing  agro-\nindustry, promoting private small- and medium-sized agro-industry enterprises, and supporting \nmarket  infrastructure  and  institutions  will  be  necessary  to  capture  higher  value-added  from \nagricultural production. If all these requirements can be fulfilled, Viet Nam will be able to achieve \na broad-based, market-oriented, and sustainable growth in agriculture in the next decade. \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n 35\n\nCHRONOLOGY \n\n \n1. \nIn response to a request from the Government of Viet Nam, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  provided  a  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  design  of  the  Program.1 \nThe  TA  (i)  assessed  the  impact  of  previous  policy  changes  in  the  sector;2  (ii)  assisted  the \nGovernment  and  ADB  develop  strategies  for  the  agriculture  and  rural  development  sector  to \n2010,  including  a  time-bound  action  plan;  and  (iii)  prepared  policy  reform  proposals  for  the \nAgriculture Sector Development Program (ASDP). Under the TA, six surveys were conducted of \n(i) 410 private agro-industries nationwide, (ii) 400 commercial farmers nationwide, (iii) 210 poor \nhouseholds  in  a  socioeconomic  survey  in  three  regions,  (iv)  institutional  constraints  in  the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), (v) contributions to agricultural growth, \nand (vi) fertilizer marketing in the Red River Delta. A highly consultative process was followed in \npreparing  ASDP.  Five  participatory  workshops  were  held  in  four  provinces  to  discuss  the \nfindings  of  the  TA.  A  national  workshop  with  about  130  participants  was  held  in  MARD  on \n5 December 2000. In addition, two workshops were held to discuss the results of the agro-industry \nsurvey  and  another  two  were  held  to  discuss  the  socioeconomic  and  productivity  surveys.  The \nconsultant team leader presented the major findings and recommendations in Manila and Hanoi \nin March and April 2001.  \n \n2. \nADB was instrumental in assisting the Government develop a new 10-year (2001\u20132010) \nagriculture  and  rural  development  strategy  during  the  preparation  of  this  sector  development \nprogram. The Government approved this strategy in mid-2001. The proposed ASDP has been \ndesigned to help the Government implement this strategy.  \n \nA Loan Fact-Finding Mission3 visited Viet Nam from 25 February to 17 March 2002 and \n3. \na  Follow-Up  Mission  during  8\u201315  April  2002.

The  Missions  held  detailed  discussions  with \ngovernment and other aid agencies, private sector agribusinesses and small- and medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs),  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  farmers.  Field  trips  were \nconducted  to  Bac  Ninh,  Quang  Ninh,  and  Vinh  Phuc  provinces  to  investigate  the  lending \noperations  of  the  Vietnam  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  to  SMEs.  Field  trips \nwere  also  conducted  in  Vinh  Phuc  and  Phu  Tho  provinces  in  the  northern  region  and  Binh \nDuong,  Long  An,  and  An  Giang  provinces  in  the  southern  region  to  meet  with  provincial \ngovernment  representatives,  and  research  institutes  and  universities.  The  Missions  also \nparticipated  in  two  workshops  in  Hanoi  during  25-27  February  2002:  (i)  a  national  agricultural \nextension  workshop  conducted  by  MARD  and  several  international  NGOs  active  in  promoting \nparticipatory  extension  methods,  and  (ii)  a  joint  World  Bank-International  Rice  Research \nInstitute workshop to present the World Bank\u2019s new global rural development strategy. \n\n                                                           \n1  ADB. 2002.

Most poor households depend on \nsubsistence production. \nLow agricultural productivity and lack of access and competitiveness in markets result in low income in rural \nareas, which is one of the main explanatory factors for poverty in Viet Nam. \nThe poor have relatively low levels of educational attainment and lack functional skills and information on \nmarkets, thereby reducing opportunities for sales in higher value and more diverse markets.  \nThe poor have limited access to assets such as land and credit. The poor are vulnerable to social isolation. They \nare vulnerable to household-specific shocks, community-wide crises, natural calamities, and food insecurity.  \n\n\u2022  Around 40% of poor households, especially the poorest of the poor households in the rural area, are unable to \n\naccess any source of credit. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nStakeholder analysis prepared \n\nParticipation Strategy \n\nYES \n(cid:131)  The Agriculture Sector Development Program (ASDP) will involve the participation of many stakeholders at \n\nYES \n\ndifferent levels and from different sectors. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and the \nprovincial governments will be actively involved. At the regional and local level, research institutes of MARD and \nextension services will play very active roles. The Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development \n(VBARD) will also be an important stakeholder. Private agriculture input suppliers and cooperatives will \nparticipate in implementing the program. Nongovernment organizations, both domestic and international, will \nalso be involved in ASDP. The participation of the key social organizations like the Vietnam Women's Union and \nfarmers\u2019 associations is essential. At provincial levels, local authorities will participate by establishing and \nstrengthening agriculture extension councils. Enhanced outreach at the commune level will be achieved by \nadding extension agents and introducing participatory extension methods. \n\n\u2022  ASDP will observe an integrated participatory approach in the implementation process. The involvement of \n\nstakeholders from different levels and from different sectors, including the target beneficiaries, will ensure that \nthis approach is carried out. One important feature is the participation of the local people, i.e. farmers and the \npoor, in the process of planning, implementing, and monitoring. It is intended that the participation of the local \npeople in agricultural research and extension will be institutionalized.  \n\n\u2022  Under the project loan, the participation of agro-industry small- and medium-sized enterprises is also ensured by \n\nthe cofinancing rate of 20% in the subproject cost. VBARD will also finance part of the costs of the investment. \n\n \n\n \nA. \n \n\n \nB. \n \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\n \nC. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nPotential Issues \n\nD. \n \n\n \n\nSignificant/\nNot \nSignificant/ \nUncertain/ \nNone \n\nResettlement \n\nNone \n\nGender \n\nNone \n\nAffordability  \nLabor \n\nNone \nNone \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\nNone \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nOutput \nPrepared \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \nNo \n\nNo \n\nfrom \n\nthrough \n\nresettlement \n\nissues  arising \n\nThere  will  be  no \nthe \nimplementation  of  the  Program.  There  may  be  some  positive \nimpacts, though uncertain, on resettlement issues\u2014rural people \nmay benefit from better agriculture production techniques, which \nare more suited to their current land conditions. \nNo  gender  issues  related  to  the  implementation  of  the  Program \nare  foreseen.  In  contrast,  a  number  of  positive  impacts  on \nwomen  are  highly  likely.  The  stipulated  increase  of  women \nextension  workers  will  have  a  beneficial  impact  on  job  creation \nfor  women  and  women  empowerment \nincome \ngeneration and knowledge. Also, women will benefit from higher \nagriculture  productivity,  and  modern  production  techniques  and \ntechnologies  as  a  result  of  improved  agriculture  research  and \ntechnology transfer. \nNone \nThere  will  be  no  issue  related  to  labor.  Similar  to  the  above-\nmentioned issues, positive impacts on job creation are expected. \nThe investment loan, through its provision of loans to small- and \nmedium-sized  enterprises \nin  agro-industry,  will  create  a \nsignificant  number  of  jobs  (approximately  11,750  full-time  jobs), \nand  part-time  jobs  for  affiliated  businesses.  Improved  market \ninformation,  higher  quality  research  and  extension,  and  easier \naccess  to  credits,  as  a  result  of  the  Program,  will  encourage \nincreased private investment and job creation. \nNo adverse issues related to indigenous peoples are anticipated. \nIn  fact,  indigenous  peoples  will  benefit  from  the  Program.  The \nGovernment will increase the employment of ethnic minorities in \nthe  agriculture  extension  service.  A  stronger  contingent  of \nextension  workers  will  be  able  to  provide  better  advice  and \nservices  to  agriculture  producers  in  mountainous  areas.  Such \nproducers  will  have  access  to  the  new  breeds  and  varieties, \nwhich  are  very  much  suited  to  their  conditions.  Market  and \nproduct  information  (through  the  improved  market  information \nsystem) will also benefit the people in mountainous areas. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n57\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nIntroduction \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe proposed loans were screened for environmental impacts using matrices based on \nthe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Environmental Guidelines for Selected Agricultural and \nNatural  Resource  Development  Projects,  1991.

The  screening  did  not  find  any  significant  negative  environmental  impacts  due  to  the \nproposed policy reforms. \n \n3. \nSignificant  positive  impacts  exist  because  the  policy  reforms  have  two  characteristics \nthat  support  sustainability:  elimination  of  market  distortions  and  participatory  planning. \nEconomic policies that help eliminate market distortions generally stimulate growth and improve \nthe environment. In many countries the reduction of subsidies on agricultural inputs has led to \nmore  efficient  use  of  these  resources  and  reduced  surface  water  and  groundwater  pollution, \nimproved air quality, and decreased the accumulation of toxic wastes. Moreover, non-distorting \neconomic  policies  that  stimulate  economic  growth  by  improving  the  allocation  of  resources \ngenerally create appropriate incentives for the protection of the environment. The program loan \nalso proposes numerous interventions that will increase the participation of farmers (particularly \nethnic  groups,  female,  and  people  working  in  marginal  farming  conditions)  in  planning  and \ndecision  making.  Proposed  policies  also  support  more  on-farm  research  and  increased \nextension services. These types of activities weave local knowledge into the planning process\u2014\na critical trait for environmentally sustainable and socially relevant agricultural development. \n \nSeveral  policy  reforms  have  unknown  impact.  In  these  cases,1  it  is  not  clear  how  the \n4. \nproposed policy reforms will specifically address environmental protection of natural ecosystems \nor environmental sustainability of existing agricultural areas.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Loan \n\n \nFollowing ADB requirements,2 environmental concerns of the project loan were reviewed \n5. \nat  two  levels:  (i)  the  national  lending  policy  of  the  Vietnam  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment  (VBARD);  and  (ii)  the  expected  impacts  of  representative  subprojects  supported \nby the loan.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  For  example,  restructuring  the  research  institutes,  designing  and  awarding  research  grants,  increasing  on-farm \n\nresearch, developing subject matter specialists, creating a human resource development plan. \n\n2  See  paras.  10,  11,  and  12  of  ADB.  1998.  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements  of  the  Asian  Development \n\nBank. Manila. \n\n\f \n58\n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\nThe  lending  policy  review  found  that  VBARD\u2019s  agency-wide  regulation  for  lending  to \n6. \ncustomers  does  not  identify  specific  provisions  for  environmental  protection.3  However, \nVBARD\u2019s guidelines for appraising loan applications clearly state that all loan applications must \nadhere  to  the  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology  (MOST).4 \nFurthermore, VBARD staff stated in meetings and written communications that VBARD has no \nseparate  policy  on  the  environment.  To  compensate  for  these  policy  deficiencies,  ADB  has \nfound it beneficial in the past to develop loan-specific guidelines and procedures for borrowers \nof VBARD funds. The most relevant VBARD example is the ADB-financed Rural Credit Project \nwhere environmental guidelines were produced and applied to rural credit loan borrowers.5 The \nguidelines  state  that  (i)  subprojects  need  to  meet  Viet  Nam\u2019s  environmental  laws  and \nregulations (footnote 4); (ii) loans cannot be used to purchase or use a specific list of banned \npesticides; and (iii) subprojects cannot have any negative impact on erosion, deforestation, the \nlocal  community,  noise,  dust,  etc.  A  second  example  is  the  State  Bank  of  Vietnam\u2019s  (SBV) \nEnvironmental Assessment of Rural Credit Loans in Viet Nam: Field Guidelines (January 2000). \nThese guidelines are for the use of credit officers assessing the environmental and health risks \nposed  by  rural  credit  loans.  The  guidelines  cover  subprojects  in  land  clearing,  fertilizer  use, \npesticide  use,  livestock,  poultry,  artisanal  fishing,  aquaculture,  food  processing,  leather \nproduction, brick manufacturing, ceramics, and an appendix containing a one-page environment \nform  for  credit  officers  and  borrowers  to  fill-out.  However,  it  was  found  that  VBARD  credit \nofficers seldom use the guidelines.  \n \n7. \nWhile  VBARD\u2019s  policy  framework  for  environmental  protection  is  modest,  VBARD \nnevertheless operates under an internal set of environmental assessment procedures. For large \nprojects that have significant environment impacts, VBARD requires the project owners to hire \nrelated  authority  agencies  to  evaluate  their  project\u2019s  environment  impacts  and  submit \nenvironmental  impacts  assessment  to  VBARD  for  consideration.  For  medium-sized  projects, \nVBARD\u2019s credit officers assessed the environment impacts during the project appraisal process \n(e.g., waste treatment measures, environmental pollution, measures to minimize environmental \nimpacts, and measures to improve environment impacts in accordance to recommendations of \nthe  related  authority  agencies).  According  to  VBARD,  the  credit  officers  primarily  use  their \npractical  work  experience  to  conduct  environmental  appraisal  duties.  VBARD  states  it  has  not \norganized  any  training  course  specifically  on  environment  issues  for  these  credit  officers,  with \nthe  exception  of  some  training  courses  organized  by  the  International  Credit  Project \nManagement Unit of SBV under the Rural Credit Project. \n \n8. \nThe expected impacts of representative subprojects supported by the Project were also \nreviewed.  The  screening  began  by  merging  representative  subprojects  into  three  categories: \n(i) transport  subprojects,  (ii)  food  processing  subprojects,  and  (iii)  light  industrial  subprojects. \nMost projects funded under the loan are expected to fall into one of these three categories. The \nscreening considered a wide range of situations and therefore a wide range of impacts for each \nsubproject category. For example, the location of a food processing plant in the forested area of \nthe central highlands may have a mitigable impact, but a food processing plant located in a rural \nindustrial  zone  of  the  Mekong  delta  may  have  no  ecological  impacts.  In  these  cases,  the \nprecautionary principle was applied by ascribing a mitigable evaluation to the potential impact of \nall food processing locations. The screening found all subproject activities for all categories to \nhave  either  not  significant  or  mitigable  impacts.  If  the  mitigation  measures  are  achieved,  it  is \n                                                 \n3  Decision No. 72/QD-HDQT-TD: The Regulations to Lending to Customers of VBARD\u2019s System (2002). \n4  These include Law on Environmental Protection (1993); CP 175 Providing Guidance on the Implementation on the \nLaw on Environmental Protection (1994); and CP 490 Circular letter of Guidance on Setting up and Appraising the \nEnvironmental Impact Assessment Report for Investment Projects (1998). \n\n5  No. 1135 (July 08/97): Environmental Advice for Loan Applicants of the ADB Rural Credit Loan (pp. 52-56). \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n59\n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\nlikely the loan will have a significant positive impact by increasing resource efficiency, reducing \npoverty, and promoting social equity while concurrently promoting environmental sustainability. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nThe loan has an environmental management plan with two parts: (i) mitigation measures \nto  minimize  potential  negative  impacts  and/or  maximize  potential  positive  impacts,  and  (ii)  a \nmonitoring framework to assess the efficiency of mitigation measures. \n \n10. \nTwo  mitigating  actions  are  proposed  for  the  policy  reform  loan.  The  first  is  promoting \nsustainable  agricultural  development  as  a  research  priority  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and \nRural  Development  (MARD).  This  mitigation  does  not  require  new  research  institutes  to  be \ncreated\u2014it  only  requires  MARD  to  assign  to  one  or  more  existing  institutes  the  specific \nresponsibility  of  designing  and  implementing  research  activities  on  agricultural  practices  that \nuse natural resources and systems, in a way that environmental quality can be maintained for \ncurrent  and  future  generations.  MARD  should  weave  the  knowledge  acquired  through  this \nresearch  into  numerous  practical  activities.  For  example,  MARD  can  ensure  that  research \ngrants  are  evaluated  in  part  by  sustainability  criteria  and/or  provide  2-3  grants  per  year  that \nfocus  specifically  on  sustainable  agriculture.  This  can  be  achieved  by  adding  \u201csustainable \nquestions\u201d  to  the  application  process.  For  example,  research  applications  could  ask:  \u201chow  will \nthe  knowledge  acquired  from  this  research  protect  Viet  Nam\u2019s  natural  environment?\u201d  (the \nanswer might be \u201cto reduce deforestation rates\u201d); or \u201chow will the knowledge acquired from this \nresearch maintain or improve the quality of arable land in Viet Nam for future generations?\u201d (the \nanswer  might  be  \u201cto  reduce  salinity  intrusion  for  arable  land  in  Mekong  delta,  therefore \nmaintaining  total  hectares  of  arable  land\u201d).  MARD  can  also  ensure  that  on-farm  research \nactivities  test  new  ideas  and  approaches  for  sustainable  agriculture  proposed  by  research \ninstitutes,  and  ensure  that  the  human  resource  development  plan  specifically  address \nsustainable agriculture as a development goal. \n \n11. \nThe second proposed mitigating action for the program loan is ensuring that extension \nservices  provide  adequate  knowledge  relating  to  sustainable  agriculture.  To  implement  this \nmeasure, MARD should ensure that (i) the joint extension plan specifically states that staff will \nfor  agricultural  sustainability  and \nreceive \nenvironmental protection; (ii) the terms of reference for contracted extension service providers \nshould  include  a  requirement  to  disseminate  information  on  environmental  protection  and \nagricultural sustainability; and (iii) MARD could consider incorporating environmental risks (e.g., \nrisks of biodiversity loss, increased air/water pollution, and soil contamination/erosion) into the \nrisk analysis component of its proposed market information system. \n \n12. \nOne  mitigation  measure  proposed  for  the  project  loan:  to  ensure  that  subprojects  are \ndesigned  and  implemented  in  a  manner  that  promotes  sustainability  and  environmental \nprotection.  Actions  to  implement  this  mitigation  measure  follow:  (i)  VBARD  will  develop  and \nsubmit to ADB an environmental and social management system (policy, procedure, resources) \nfor its operations;6 (ii) if additional capacity is required to implement the system, VBARD should \ndesign  and  submit  a  capacity  development  plan  to  ADB;  and  (iii)  VBARD  will  submit  an \nenvironmental performance report on its environmental and social management system. \n                                                 \n6  This  system  should  be  practical  and  therefore  build  on  existing  procedures  that  support  sustainability  and \nenvironmental protection (e.g., adopt relevant sections of (i) State Bank of Vietnam\u2019s Environmental Assessment of \nRural  Credit  Loans  in  Viet  Nam:  Field  Guidelines  (January  2000);  and  (ii)  VBARD\u2019s  No.  1135  (July  08/97); \nEnvironmental Advice for loan applicants of the ADB Rural Credit Loan (pp. 52-56). In addition to existing policies \nand procedures, VBARD should consider the potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures presented. \n\ntools  and  approaches \n\ntraining  on  practical \n\n\f \n60\n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\n \n13. \nThe implementation and effectiveness of mitigation measures described above need to \nbe  monitored  in  a  systematic  and  transparent  way.  The  monitoring  programs  should  include \nclear  monitoring  objectives,  indicators  to  monitor,  monitoring  locations,  and  frequency  of \nmonitoring. The results should be included in the loan\u2019s regular reporting. \n \nD. \n \nThe loan supports many policy reforms and activities that have the potential to promote \n14. \nsocial  and  environmental  sustainability  as  it  relates  to  agricultural  development  in  Viet  Nam.7 \nMaking  sustainability  an  explicit  part  of  the  long-term  goal  will  clarify  the  purpose  for \nincorporating the below recommendations in the Program. \n \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n15. \nThe program loan should have a net positive effect on the environment. However, there \nare  many  policy  reforms  with  unknown  impact.  There  is  ample  opportunity  to  increase  the \npositive  environmental  impact  of  this  loan  by  transforming  unknown  impacts  into  significant \npositive  impacts.  Adherence  to  the  following  recommendations  can  achieve  that.  The \ncombination of letters and numbers refers to items in the policy matrix (Appendix 3). \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nA1.1,  A1.6,  and  A1.12:  Restructuring  of  research  institutes  should  result  in  at \nleast  one  institute  having  sustainable  agriculture  as  a  primary  research  priority. \nThe  results  of  this  research  will  be  MARD\u2019s  knowledge  base  on  environmental \nand  social  impacts  for  new  and  existing  agriculture  activities  for  present  and \nfuture generations. The knowledge base can be communicated to other institutes \nas  a  set  of  guidelines,  sustainability  indicators,  etc.  Research  results  can  then \nbecome information inputs into performance-based evaluation, on-farm research, \nand development of competitive grants (A1.3, A1.8). \n\nA1.1:  Conduct  on-farm  research  on  issues  relating  to  sustainable  agriculture. \nThese  issues  can  be  selected  and  coordinated  with  activities  of  the  institute(s) \nconducting sustainable agriculture research. \n\nA.1.3  and  A1.8:  Ensure  research  grants  are  evaluated  in  part  by  a  set  of \nsustainability  criteria.  These  criteria  should  be  based  on  findings  of  the \nsustainable agriculture research program and the priorities of MARD and MOST \n(A1.1). \n\nA1.5,  A1.11,  and  A1.15:  Ensure  the  MARD  policy  on  proportional  increases  to \nresearch budgets explicitly states \u201cresearch on sustainable agriculture.\u201d \n\nA1.8:  Of  10  annual  research  grants,  2-3  grants  should  be  earmarked  for \nresearch on environmental protection or environmental sustainability. \n\nA1.9.  The  human  resource  development  plan  should  include  specific  objectives \nand activities relating to developing skills in sustainable agriculture. \n\n(vii)  A2.1:  Operational  guidelines  for  provincial  extension  advisory  councils  need  to \ninclude  stakeholders  that  typically  have  an  interest  in  social  equity  and \nenvironmental  protection  (e.g.,  Departments  of  Science  and  Technology, \nwomen\u2019s unions, and nongovernment organizations). \n\n                                                 \n7 Sustainable agriculture is used here to mean agricultural practices that use natural resources and systems in a way \n\nthat environmental quality can be maintained for current and future generations. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n61\n\n(viii)  A2.2:  Some  extension  service  providers  should  disseminate  information  on \n\nenvironmental protection and agricultural sustainability. \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nA2.5:  The  extension  plan  should  be  designed  to  ensure  that  extension  staff \nreceive  training  on  practical  tools  and  approaches  for  agricultural  sustainability \nand  environmental  protection.  Relevant  results  from  research  institutes  (A1.1) \nshould be woven into the plan. \n\nA2.8: Ensure subject matter specialists listed in the regulation or circular include \nthose with expertise in environmental sustainability and protection. \n\nB1.1,  B1.5,  and  B1.7:  Plan  for  agricultural  market  information  system  should \ninclude  information  on  environmental  risks.  These  risks  should  be  based  on \nexperiences of sustainable agriculture research institutes, on-farm research, and \na priori knowledge. \n\n16. \nThe  project  loan  has  the  potential  to  create  a  significant  positive  impact  by  increasing \nresource efficiency, reducing poverty, and promoting social equity while concurrently promoting \nenvironmental sustainability. However, to realize this potential, it is recommended that VBARD \nand ADB produce a set of specific lending and appraisal guidelines similar to those developed \nfor the Rural Credit Project. These guidelines should be designed through cooperative dialogue \nwith VBARD, field visits to potential project sites, and review of potential impacts and mitigation \nmeasures  identified.  A  competent  authority  should  monitor  the  progress  of  implementing  the \nmitigating  and  monitoring  measures  as  part  of  the  regular  monitoring  program.  If  the \nrecommendations are implemented successfully, the overall loan will have a greater net positive \nenvironmental benefit than the without-loan scenario. \n\nE. \n\nConclusions \n\n17. \nViet Nam\u2019s agricultural system provides national food security, generation of surplus for \nfurther \nindustrialization,  and  competitiveness  of \nthe  economy \nintensification of the farming systems being required to meet future food and fiber needs, natural \nresources will be further stressed and sustainability issues will become more critical. In light of \nthese  demands,  ADB  is  proposing  an  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Program  (ASDP).  The \nProgram  will  (i)  focus  on  a  series  of  policy  reforms  to  streamline  the  management  and \ncompetitiveness of agricultural research institutes, increase extension activities to rural farmers, \nand  increase  local  participation  in  planning  and  decision  making;  and  (ii)  support  VBARD  in \nproviding  loans  for  value-added  and  non-primary  production  activities  (e.g.,  transport,  food \nprocessing, and light industry) to small- and medium-sized enterprises. \n\nin  world  markets.  With \n\n18. \nThe  environmental  screening  of  the  program  loan  yielded  a  mix  of  significant  positive \nimpacts,  unknown  impacts,  or  no  impacts.  Recommendations  to  maximize  the  positive \nenvironmental benefits of the policy loan are proposed in the initial environmental examination \n(IEE).  The  screening  did  not  reveal  any  significant  negative  environmental  impacts  due  to  the \nproposed policy reforms. \n\nThe  environmental  screening  of  the  project  loan  found  a  mix  of  no  impacts,  mitigable \n19. \nimpacts,  or  insignificant  impacts.  Recommendations  to  mitigate  the  negative  impacts  are \nproposed in the IEE. If these mitigation measures are implemented, the loan has the potential to \ncreate  a  significant  positive  impact  by  increasing  resource  efficiency,  reducing  poverty,  and \npromoting social equity while concurrently promoting environmental sustainability.  \n\n\f \n62\n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\nTaking to account the entire loan package, the environmental impact screening identified \n20. \nno  significant  negative  environmental  impacts  that  cannot  be  mitigated.  Indeed,  ASDP  will \nprovide greater net positive impacts than the without-loan alternative. None of the policy reforms \nor representative projects are in category A. No further studies are required to complement the \nIEE.  Recommendations  to  maximize  the  positive  impacts  of  ASDP  and  monitor  the \neffectiveness of the mitigation measures are provided in the summary IEE.  \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 November 2002) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "dong (D) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "D1,000\n$1.00\n", "$0.0651 \nD15,365 \n", " \n \n", "For the purpose of calculations in this report, the rate of $1.00 = D15,000 was used. \n", "ADB \nAMIS \nASDP \nCAR \nDAFE \nDanida \nFAO \nGDP \nGTZ \n", "ICARD \nIEE \nMARD \nMOF \nMOST \nMPI \nNEC \nNGO \nPCF \nPIU \nPRC \nSBV \nSida \nSIEE \nSME \nSOE \nTA \nVBARD \nVBP \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nagricultural market information system \nAgriculture Sector Development Program \ncapital adequacy ratio \nDepartment of Agriculture and Forestry Extension \nDanish International Development Agency \nFood and Agriculture Organization \ngross domestic product \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (German Agency \nfor Technical Cooperation) \nInformation Center for Agriculture and Rural Development \ninitial environmental examination \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Science and Technology \nMinistry of Planning and Investment \nNational Extension Center \nnongovernment organization \nPeople\u2019s Credit Fund \nprogram/project implementation unit \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nState Bank of Vietnam \nSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency \nsummary initial environmental examination \nsmall- and medium-sized enterprise \nstate-owned enterprise \ntechnical assistance \nVietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development \nVietnam Bank for the Poor \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.  \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars \n", "This report was prepared by a team consisting of R.
