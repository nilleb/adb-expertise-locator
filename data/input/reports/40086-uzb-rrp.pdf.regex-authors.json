The summary initial environmental examinations are \nAssessment  in Supplementary Appendix H. \n   \nProject Description  The Project continues the support of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  for  the  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  irrigation  and \ndrainage  infrastructure  and  capacity  development  for  water \nmanagement. The Project is structured as a sector loan project. It \nwill involve two areas of the country: (i) the Zarafshan River Basin, \nand (ii) the Fergana Valley. The Project will (i) rehabilitate and \nupgrade pumping stations, (ii) rehabilitate and upgrade inter-farm \nirrigation and drainage canals and structures, and (iii) improve \ninter-farm water management through state water agencies and \non-farm management through water users\u2019 associations (WUAs). \nThe  primary  aim  is  sustained  and  increased  agriculture \nproductivity. \n   \nRationale  Agriculture remains a key sector of the economy and the main \nsource  of  livelihood  for  the  rural  population.  Irrigation  and \ndrainage are key factors in agriculture, and critical to productivity, \ncompetitiveness, and environmental management. However, the \ninfrastructure  is  deteriorating  rapidly.  Pump  stations  are  losing \ncapacity and the inter-farm facilities are contributing to substantial \nwater  losses.  Rehabilitation  of  pump  stations  and  inter-farm \ncanals is essential to avoid the partial or complete collapse of \nirrigation  systems,  with  consequent  losses  in  agricultural \nproduction and farm incomes. To realize the full benefit of the \ninfrastructure  rehabilitation  and  provide  for  more  effective \noperation and maintenance in the future, it is essential to improve \nwater management at the basin, inter-farm canal, and on-farm \nlevels.  \n \nThe rehabilitation needs are substantial, but the level of funding \navailable  from  the  Government  and  development  partners  is \nlimited. This means prioritizing investments. The Government has \nrequested the focus to be on rehabilitation of pump stations and \nrelated  inter-farm  canals,  together  with  improved  water \nmanagement from the river basin to the WUA level. \n   ", "ii   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project\u2019s  expected  impact  is  sustained  and  increased \nagriculture production and productivity. The expected outcome is \nirrigation  systems  fully  functional  and  operated  in  an  efficient \nmanner. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $148.0 million, \nincluding  taxes  and  duties,  physical  and  price  contingencies, \ninterest charges during implementation, and commitment charges. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide a blend of two loans totaling $100 million: (i) $85 \nmillion from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR), and (ii) an \nAsian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent to Special Drawing Rights 10.042 million (estimated at \n$15 million). The OCR loan will have a 26-year term, including a \ngrace period of 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and  such \nother  terms  and  conditions  to  be  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement. The ADF loan will have a 32-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% yearly during the \ngrace period and 1.5% yearly after that, and such other terms and \nconditions as are set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2015 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2014 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) \n   \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented over 6 years starting in early \nArrangements  2009. A project steering committee will guide policy and strategic \n  direction. A project director will be appointed by MAWR. A project \n  management office will be established within MAWR in Tashkent \nto  manage  day-to-day  implementation  activities.  Project \nimplementation units will be established in Samarkand city in the \nZarafshan River Basin and Fergana city in the Fergana Valley. A \nfull-time project manager, who will be acceptable to ADB, will \nmanage the project management office, while deputy managers \nwill oversee each project implementation units. \n   \nProcurement  The Project will finance the procurement of equipment, civil works, \nand consulting services. All procurement will be in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time). \n   ", "  iii\nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  provide  154  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services and 490 person-months of national consulting \nservices. A service contract for WUA training will be executed. \nThe  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time), using the quality- and cost-based selection method \nfor a firm in addition to individual consultant engagements. \n   \nProject Benefits and  Project  benefits  include  (i)  reduced  production  losses, \nBeneficiaries  (ii) increased energy efficiency, (iii) improved water management, \n(iv)  decreased  land  degradation  caused  by  soil  salinity  and \nwaterlogging,  (v)  increased  irrigation  efficiency,  (vi)  enhanced \nfarm productivity through increased yields and cropping intensity, \nand (vii) increased rural livelihoods. \n \nThe Project has an overall economic internal rate of return of \n15.5%. Two core subprojects analyzed during preparation of the \nProject had economic internal rate of return of 15.4% and 13.4%. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Major risks include ineffective project management, inadequate \nsystem  operation  and  maintenance  and  management,  and \nimplementation  delays  caused  by  cumbersome  internal \nGovernment  procedures.  Other  risks  include  macroeconomic \nshocks and commodity price instability. \n ", "60o  00'E 69o  00'E\nKAZAKHSTAN UZBEKISTAN\nWATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT\nSECTOR PROJECT\nVozrozdeniya\n      Island\n45 o 00'N Aral  Sea 45 o 00'N\nN\nMuynak\n0 50 100 150\nKilometers\nKungrad\nKARAKALPAKSTAN\nKhodzheyli\nNukus\nNAVOI\nAm Uchkuduk KAZAKHSTAN\nudarya R.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Water Resources Management Sector Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  The  Water  Resources  Management  Sector  Project  was  prepared  by  a  project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA) approved in 2008.1 This document is based on the \nconsultants\u2019 studies, surveys, and reports; the findings of Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nmissions;  and  discussion  with  government  agencies,  stakeholders,  beneficiaries,  and \ndevelopment partners. A problem tree analysis is in Appendix 1 and a project design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 2. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  Uzbekistan recorded per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of $814 in 2007. GDP \ngrowth rates increased from 3.8% in 2000 to 4.4% in 2003, to an annual average of over 7% \nduring 2004\u201320062 and 9.5% in 2007.3 Agriculture growth fluctuated from 3.2% in 2000, to \n10.1% in 2004 to 6.1% in 2007. The share of agriculture in GDP declined from 30.1% in 2000 to \n24.1% in 2006. Despite this decline, agriculture remains an important sector, accounting for \n70% of domestic trade, 35%\u201340% of industrial output (about 7.8% of GDP), 25% of export \nearnings, and 33% of employment. While poverty declined from 27.5% in 2001 to 25.8% in \n2005, poverty in rural areas remains high. About 64% of the population lives in rural areas. \nDetailed analysis of the sector is provided in Appendix 3.  \n \n4.  Uzbekistan is an arid country. It relies on the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers and their \ntributaries to support irrigated agriculture. Water supply varies on a seasonal basis, with many \nareas  not  having  enough.  Irrigated  agriculture  accounts  for  over  90%  of  all  agricultural \nproduction  and  consumes  88%  of  all  water  resources\u201457  cubic  kilometers  annually.  The \ndevelopment and management of irrigation and drainage infrastructure and improved water \nmanagement are fundamental actions to ensure that agriculture continues to develop over the \nmedium term.  \n \n5.  Uzbekistan has about 4.3 million hectares (ha) under irrigation. The irrigation network \nincludes inter-farm and on-farm systems.4 Irrigation primarily relies on surface water, which is \ndistributed by gravity and pumps. The network includes (i) 30,000 kilometers (km) of main and \ninter-farm canals, with over 33,000 hydraulic structures; (ii) 1,500 pumping facilities, with almost \n5,000  pumps  that  supply  water  to  2  million  ha;  (iii)  175,000  km  of  on-farm  canals  and \nconveyance structures; (iv) 40,000 km of on-farm horizontal drains and 4,300 vertical drains; (v) \n120,000 km of drainage ditches; and (vi) 15,000 km of large drainage collectors. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n4  The inter-farm systems comprise the intake structures for water irrigation supply, the main and distributary canals \nthat convey water to the farm level outlets, and the large collectors drains that move drainage water from irrigated \nareas. The on-farm system includes the smaller field channels and associated structures that distribute water to the \nfarmers\u2019 fields, and the smaller drainage systems that take water from the field and lower the water table to prevent \nsalinization and waterlogging. \n ", "2 \n6.  The farming structure has evolved since independence. Shirkat farms were created from \nSoviet collective farms, but all were transformed into private farms by the end of 2007. There \nare now about 190,000 private farms with an average area of 26 ha. Shirkat farm operations are \nstill controlled by the Government through the quota and state order system, especially in the \ncase of the strategic commodities of cotton and wheat. These also receive credit and inputs \nfrom the Government. Almost 1.8 million people are employed on private farms. These farms \nproduce 32% of agricultural output, including 86% of raw cotton and 73% of grain crops. The \nstate order system has been relaxed over the decade, and farms can now sell 50% of their \nwheat and cotton production to the open market. This is having a good impact on productivity \nand the system will continue to be made more flexible. Cotton comprises 41% of the irrigated \narea and wheat comprises 42%. The production system remains inefficient, and excess water \nuse  contributes  to  salinity  and  land  degradation.  The  cropping  pattern  does  not  allow  for \nperiodic fallowing of land or rotation with fodder or other crops to replenish soil nutrients and \nabsorb salts. Dekhan farms are small inheritable household plot (0.15\u20130.35 hectares) free from \nGovernment  quotas  for  crop  selection  and  marketing.  Their  land  use  rights  have  been \ntransferred  to  private  individuals.  This  allows  for  secure  possession,  inheritance,  and  free \ncropping patterns. There are 4 million\u20135 million small dekhan farms. They produce nearly one \nfifth of the country\u2019s grains and almost all of the horticulture output. They also provide important \ncash flow to farmers. \n \n7.  Cotton remains the priority crop, and Uzbekistan is the world\u2019s sixth largest producer. \nThe Government plans to increase the domestic use of cotton fibers and raise value added \nthrough the development of a better textile industry. Wheat is the other priority crop, with self-\nsufficiency achieved in 1997. Because of fluctuations in food prices and the current world food \nsecurity situation, the Government intends to maintain its policy of wheat self-sufficiency.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n8.  Irrigation and Drainage Needs. Although the infrastructure was well built, its current \ncondition  is  poor,  primarily  because  of  lack  of  investment  and  inadequate  maintenance. \nGovernment investment in agriculture as a whole has declined from 27% of all investments in \n1991 to 8% in 2001. From 1995 to 2002, government funding for the water network dropped \nfrom 3% to under 2% of GDP. Expenditure in operation and maintenance (O&M) has slowed by \none third. It is estimated that deferred capital and O&M expenditures amounts to 40% of asset \nvalue. \n \n9.  The irrigation and drainage system needs substantial rehabilitation and upgrading (R&U) \nand water losses are high. Some structures are at risk of total failure, which would cause \nagricultural  production  and  farm  incomes  to  decline  dramatically.  Investment  is  needed  in \nseveral areas: (i) total reconstruction of 32% of the main and inter-farm canals; (ii) repair of 24% \nof the main and inter-farm canal network; (iii) rebuilding of 42% of the on-farm irrigation network, \nand repair of 17%; (iv) replacement and modernization of mechanical equipment of 18 of the \n42 large intake structures, and reconstruction of 5; (v) 16 of the 27 inspected reservoirs are \nnonfunctional or threatened with sedimentation; (vi) 19,000 km of on-farm drainage need de-\nsilting,  and  11,500  km  of  open  and  subsurface  drains  need  reconstruction  or  repair;  and \n(vii) only 50% of the subsurface horizontal drainage systems are operational. The limited use of \nwater-efficient irrigation technologies means an unneeded 10%\u201315% of water supply is required \nfor irrigation. The high water table and use of drainage water for irrigation increases salinity and \nrequires substantial water for leaching. Sustained investment in R&U and better O&M will \nprevent further deterioration and ensure stability in the farming system. \n ", "  3 \n \n10.  Pumped irrigation and drainage is ubiquitous and poses special challenges. It includes \nthe three massive irrigation pump cascade systems from the Amu Darya (which includes the \nAmu  Bukhara,  Karshi,  and  Amu  Zhang  systems).  Together,  these  systems  irrigate  over \n800,000 ha of land. Amu Zhang is currently being rehabilitated under a project financed by ADB. \nThe other two large cascades also need urgent rehabilitation.5 Smaller pump-based irrigation \nfacilities are located throughout the gravity irrigation networks, with schemes of 10,000 ha of \nfarmland commonly reliant on pumps. Almost all pumps are operating beyond their design life, \nand their maintenance and repair has been poor. Pumps are starting to fail or threatening to do \nso. Of the 76 very large pumping facilities with capacities greater than 100 cubic meters per \nsecond (m3/sec), 60 require immediate rehabilitation. In addition, 400 of the 1,000 smaller \npumped  systems,  with  capacities  less  than  10  m3/sec,  need  immediate  rehabilitation  or \nreplacement. Pumped irrigation absorbs 70% of the annual O&M budget of the Ministry of \nAgriculture and Water Resources (MAWR). It consumes 20% of Uzbekistan\u2019s electricity, and the \noutdated equipment consumes 20%\u201325% more electricity than modern equipment. Substantial \ninvestment is needed to convert the pumped system into efficient and cost-effective operations. \nThe efficiency of smaller pumped systems can be improved through new technology, more \ndemand-responsive operating regimes, and improved irrigation techniques. \n \n11.  The total land area of the country is 18 million ha, of which 25% is arable land and \nlargely irrigated. The degraded state of irrigation and drainage infrastructure, combined with \npoor water management, result in low water use efficiency and agricultural productivity. Average \nwater withdrawal for irrigation is 14,000 cubic meters (m3) per ha, compared with 9,000 m3 per \nha to 10,000 m3 per ha in countries with similar climates. Irrigation efficiency nationwide is only \nabout 40% resulting in wasted water, overloaded drainage systems, environmental degradation, \nand worsening land salinization. MAWR estimates that more than 20,000 ha of land goes out of \nproduction each year because of salinity. The salinity affects cotton yields, which decline 20%\u2013\n30%  on  slightly  salinized  land,  but  up  to  80%  on  highly  salinized  land.  Some  degree  of \nsalinization and waterlogging affects 47% of all irrigated land. Productivity in irrigated agriculture \ndropped by 15% in the immediate post-Soviet era. Although recovering slowly, much more work \nis required to improve agricultural productivity. Yields are low at 2.25 tons per ha (t/ha) in the \ncase of cotton and 4.2 t/ha for wheat.  \n \n12.  Institutional Framework and Management of Irrigation and Drainage. The legal and \nregulatory framework for irrigation and drainage is derived from the Law on Water and Water \nUse, 1993. This addresses water rights and allocation, O&M of irrigation and drainage systems, \nand resolution of water disputes. Other decrees and laws support the establishment of the \ninstitutions responsible for water resources and irrigation and drainage. A generally sound \nframework for water management and irrigation is in place, but additional supporting legislation \nand revisions to existing laws are under preparation to define more clearly and establish the \nrights and roles of water users\u2019 associations (WUAs) within the irrigation sector.6 \n \n13.  The total runoff for water resources generated in Uzbekistan is about 11.5 m3 per year \nwhile the total demand for irrigation is about 57 m3, with the balance coming from upstream \ncountries via the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers. In 1992, the Central Asian republics7 \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Amu Zhang Irrigation Rehabilitation Project. \nManila. \n6 The Law on Water and Water Use, 1993, is currently being revised by the Government to incorporate WUA \nconcerns, and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) has also expressed interest in working \nwith the Government to improve water users\u2019 association (WUA) legislation. \n7  Includes Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n ", "4 \nestablished  the  Interstate  Commission  for  Water  Coordination  (ICWC)  to  oversee  water \nallocation. In the current absence of permanent water-sharing agreements, allocation is decided \ntwice a year on an ad hoc basis under ICWC and managed by the basin water management \norganizations under ICWC. ADB has just launched a new technical assistance to reestablish a \nlong-term water allocation system among the countries in the region.8 \n \n14.  MAWR has overall responsibility for water resources. Within MAWR, the Directorate for \nWater Management (DWM) is the primary organization responsible for the development, O&M, \nand management of irrigation and drainage infrastructure. DWM was reorganized in 2003 from \na provincial and district administrative basis to a water basin set-up in which irrigation and \ndrainage are managed by basin irrigation system administrations (BISAs) under DWM.9 The \nterritory of each BISA is organized into main canal administrations (MCAs) and irrigation system \nadministrations  (ISAs).  Although  the  reorganization  into  BISAs  was  an  improvement  for \nmanagement  of  water  resources  and  irrigation,  BISAs  need  improved  irrigation  and  water \nmanagement  procedures  and  practices  to  manage  water  more  effectively.  Improved \ncoordination and clarification of responsibilities among BISAs, MCAs, ISAs, and WUAs would \nalso improve water management efficiency. Capacity building to improve the technical skills of \nthe BISAs, MCAs, and ISAs for irrigation, drainage, and water management must complement \nany inter-farm investment in infrastructure to help realize its full potential. \n \n15.  Water Users\u2019 Associations. With the conversion of the shirkats to private farms, the \nformer  state-supported  O&M  and  management  of  the  on-farm  irrigation  and  drainage \ninfrastructure is no longer available. By law, WUAs have the responsibility to operate the on-\nfarm system and allocate water to farmers, yet the experience with WUAs in Uzbekistan is still \ndeveloping. Although WUAs have been established, no institutionalized program within MAWR \nexists to provide training, equipment, or other resources to support their development. Their \nsizes and responsibilities also vary, depending on the type and complexity of the system. \nFinancial sustainability is difficult since membership fees are low, as is the rate of collection \nfrom farmers. The WUAs also have limited options in their ability to extract payment. The Swiss \nAgency  for  Development  and  Cooperation  (SDC)  has  the  most  experience  in  supporting \nprograms that provide training for WUAs and has ongoing programs for WUA training and water \nmanagement in Fergana Valley.10 This program has been implemented through a joint venture \nof the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and the Interstate Commission for \nWater  Coordination,  Scientific  Information  Center  (ICWC  SIC).  The  approach  importantly \nincludes organizing the WUAs based on hydrologic boundaries consistent with best practice. \nThe program has significantly improved WUA performance for water management and system \nO&M, and provides experience from which to scale up a broader training effort. \n \n16.  On-farm water management is under the supervision of the WUAs where additional \ntraining is needed. Efficiency improvements can be achieved through better coordination of ISA \nstaff operating the inter-farm systems and WUA staff operating on-farm systems to optimize \nwater deliveries. In pump systems, which have greater flexibility and can be more demand-\nresponsive, better communication and coordination between WUAs and ISA staff could yield \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for the Improved Management of Water Resources in Central Asia. Manila. \n9  Ten basin irrigation system administrations (BISA) were formed. BISAs are organized more on the existing \nirrigation and drainage system infrastructure rather than the country\u2019s natural watersheds or catchments. However, \nthe organization is based on hydrologic boundaries, and is a more logical way to manage irrigation and drainage \nthan the previous system. \n10  In the Kyrgyz Republic, where SDC initiated WUA development before Uzbekistan, early results indicate a savings \nin water use from 6,000 m3/ha to 4,900 m3/ha in some areas. ", "  5 \n \nsubstantial benefits. WUAs play a vital role in improving the productivity of irrigated agriculture \nand water management, yet require greater support to fulfill this mandate more effectively. \n \n17.  Strategic Sector Work. During preparation of the Project, a draft Medium-Term Sector \nStrategy and Investment Plan was prepared for irrigation, drainage, and water resources in \ndiscussion with the Government (Supplementary Appendix A). The strategy is derived primarily \nfrom the substantial policy work that has already been conducted in Uzbekistan for irrigation, \ndrainage and water resources. The strategy focuses on maximizing returns and increasing the \nproductivity of water use. Essential to this strategy is improved water use efficiency to be \nachieved in part through targeted R&U investment of the inter-farm irrigation system. Many \npump schemes are currently operating very inefficiently and have effectively exceeded their \ndesign life. The failure of the pumps will result in catastrophic agricultural productivity losses, \nwith subsequent income and social implications, so selective R&U of pump schemes is a vital \ncomponent of the strategy and investment plan. In addition to infrastructure R&U, the strategy \ncalls  for  improved  water  management  at  both  the  on-farm  and  inter-farm  levels  through \nstrengthened institutions and capacity development. ADB and the Government will continue to \ndiscuss and refine the strategy, particularly in view of the additional studies being undertaken by \nthe World Bank and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  \n \n18.  In  2000,  MAWR  and  the  World  Bank  published  the  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Sector \nStrategy and Study,11 which still provides relevant guidance to sector development. According \nto the strategy, about $23 billion is required to completely rehabilitate and modernize water \nresources management, irrigation and drainage infrastructure. The World Bank is currently \nfinalizing  an  updated  study,  the  Water  Sector  Investment  Plan:  Prioritization  of  Irrigation \nRehabilitation  and  Management,  which  includes  criteria  and  a  methodology  for  prioritizing \nirrigation infrastructure and a strategy for investment. 12 In 2007, the UNDP, in cooperation with \nMAWR, prepared a comprehensive overview of the water sector in Uzbekistan. UNDP has \nprepared a follow-on proposal for an integrated water resources management strategy for \nUzbekistan, initially to be pilot tested in Zarafshan River Basin. \n \n19.  The Government\u2019s recent Welfare Improvement Strategy (2008\u20132010) aims to reduce \npoverty to 20% in 2010 without increasing inequality of income. The strategy relies on irrigated \nagriculture  as  an  engine  for  growth  and  stresses  the  importance  of  investment  in  water \nresources management, irrigation, and drainage. Restructuring irrigated agriculture for higher \nproductivity is essential to the strategy, which not only requires capital investment rehabilitation \nin water resources, irrigation, and drainage, but also includes modernization and upgrading of \nwater management systems, expanded use of water efficient technologies, rehabilitation and \nmodernization of pumping systems, and better water resources management at all levels. Other \nmeasures in the strategy include (i) development and implementation of a national program for \nimproved measurement of irrigation water, (ii) implementation of appropriate water user fees to \nencourage the efficient use of water and cash for maintenance, (iii) programs to improve the \nsustainability  of  irrigation  water  supply  to  water-stressed  regions,  and  (iv)  improving  the \nperformance of WUAs. According to the Welfare Improvement Strategy, the resources required \nfor land improvement and increasing water supply in irrigated lands for 2007\u20132011 is $2 billion, \nof which $900 million is expected to be financed by borrowings from development partners. In \n2007, the Government established the Amelioration Fund to address its strategic drainage \npriorities, with a budget of $65 million equivalent. It has identified about 23,000 km of critical \n                                                 \n11 World Bank. 2000. Irrigation and Drainage Sector Strategy and Study.

ADB continues to provide support to the R&U of \nirrigation and drainage infrastructure, capacity development, and policy reforms and has four \nongoing  projects.  The  Ak  Altin  Agricultural  Development  Project13  is  strengthening  rural \ninstitutions (e.g., rural business advisory centers), rehabilitating on-farm and inter-farm drainage \nand  irrigation  systems,  and  establishing  farm  machinery  services.  The  Grain  Productivity \nImprovement Project14 is promoting wheat production in an economical and sustainable manner \nthrough varietal testing and development, enhanced farm management including agricultural \nextension, technology development and irrigation repairs, and enterprise development for input \nsupply  and  processing.  The  Amu  Zhang  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  Project  is  increasing  the \nreliability, efficiency, and sustainability of water supply together with accelerating ongoing sector \nreforms through R&U of irrigation systems; improved irrigation management; access to inputs \nand technology; and reforms in production quotas, cost recovery, and O&M policy; and water \ndelivery  fees.  The  Land  Improvement  Project15  is  improving  land  quality  and  productivity \nthrough  policy  reforms  (reduced  quotas,  deregulated  markets,  and  improved  land  tenure); \nrehabilitation of drainage and irrigation infrastructure; improved management practices; and \ncapacity development for government and nongovernment water management organizations.  \n \n21.  There is diverse ongoing assistance from other multilateral and bilateral development \npartners  in  both  agriculture  and  water  resources.  The  World  Bank  is  financing  physical \ninvestment, capacity development, and policy reforms. Its engagement in the sector is similar to \nADB. In addition to its ongoing sector strategy development, the World Bank recently approved \nthe Rural Enterprise Support Project II to provide rural finance and business planning; on-farm \nand inter-farm irrigation and drainage rehabilitation, including capacity development for WUAs \nand demonstrations; and rural training and advisory services for farmers in seven districts in \nseven  regions.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  has  completed \nassistance in water management and farmers\u2019 business training. SDC, in addition to WUA \nsupport, has programs for integrated water resources management, canal automation, and on-\nfarm water management, and will continue to expand water management activities throughout \nthe Fergana Valley. A list of external assistance is in Appendix 4. \n \n22.  From the substantial number of ADB and other development partners\u2019 projects that it has \nimplemented, MAWR has received significant capacity development in all aspects of project \nmanagement. Therefore, MAWR has substantial experience, well developed capacity, and is \nextremely well acquainted with ADB procedures to manage ADB projects very effectively. \n \n23.  Lessons. The country assistance program evaluation16 identified key lessons, and the \nfindings suggest problems with counterpart financing, O&M, and weakness of the public sector \ninstitutions  and  governance\u2014particularly  at  subnational  levels.  With  respect  to  irrigated \nagriculture, the evaluation report stated that pilot reductions in production quotas have been \nsuccessful but that their ultimate success would depend on the extent to which they are scaled \nup  across  the  sector.  Investment  has  arrested  the  collapse  of  irrigation  systems  and  a \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2002.

Irrigation investments need improved on-farm \nwater management practices to arrest salinization, waterlogging, and reductions in soil fertility. \nWater management at all levels requires critical and long-term attention to ensure improved \nwater use efficiency and sector sustainability. The complexities involved in introducing water \ntariffs and charges for service cannot be underestimated, and a broad-based program that \naddresses  constraints  and  prepares  market  participants  for  the  development  and \nimplementation  of  a  tariff  regime  is  required.  The  country  assistance  program  evaluation \nmentions the need for a stronger geographic focus to increase synergies between projects. In \nterms of project implementation, the key lessons from experience in Uzbekistan are to (i) ensure \nstrong  government  ownership;  (ii)  reduce  start-up  delays  caused  by  the  requirements  for \nfeasibility studies to be approved by the Government prior to loan signing; (iii) reduce delays in \nprocurement; and (iv) closely monitor implementation, especially key results. The above lessons \nhave been incorporated into the design of the Project. \n \n24.  Rationale. Agriculture remains a key sector of the economy and the main source of \nlivelihood for the rural population. Irrigation and drainage are essential for agriculture; and need \nsubstantial  financial  support  in  terms  of  investment,  capacity  development,  and  improved \nmanagement. The Government has given priority to the rehabilitation of pump facilities. Given \ntheir large number, the alternatives are either to focus on single larger schemes, as was the \ncase  with  Amu  Zhang  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  Project,  or  to  select  smaller  higher  priority \nschemes. The Government has opted to rehabilitate and upgrade several smaller schemes \n(less than 15 m3/sec) together with related inter-farm irrigation and drainage canals that could \nexperience partial or complete collapse in the next few years. Because of the rapidly declining \ncapacity of some pump stations where individual pumps have ceased operation and cannot be \nrepaired, the Government has requested a strong geographic focus in terms of projects coupled \nwith improved water management from the BISA to the WUA level. ADB endorses this.  \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s  Strategy.  The  Project  is  in  full  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic \nframework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020).17 Specifically, irrigation and water management are \ncore areas for infrastructure investment in Strategy 2020. The Project is aligned with ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program (2006\u20132010) for Uzbekistan that highlights the need to maintain \nthe water infrastructure and to strengthen water institutions as key development objectives.18 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Sector Investment Approach \n \n26.  The Project will finance investments in the irrigation and drainage sector, especially \npumped  irrigation  systems.  As  a  part  of  its  sector  investment  plan,  the  Government  has \nidentified a list of priority projects throughout the country and has requested ADB to work in the \nFergana Valley and Zarafshan River Basin.19 The Fergana Valley is a strategic priority as it is \ndensely  populated  and  contributes  significantly  to  GDP.  It  is  a  highly  productive  region, \ncontaining  21%  of  the  irrigated  area  (910,000  ha)  but  providing  35%  of  all  agricultural \nproduction. About 45% of the irrigated area is served by pump irrigation. The Zarafshan River \nflows in from Tajikistan, and the associated irrigation system (575,000 ha) supports the second \nmost important agricultural center in the country. About 30% of the area is served by pump \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n18 ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010): Uzbekistan. Manila. \n19 For the purposes of the Project, the Fergana Valley comprises the Syrdarya-Sokh BISA, Naryn-Syrdarya BISA, and \nNaryn-Karadarya BISA, and the Zarafshan River Basin comprises the Zarafshan BISA. \n ", "8 \nirrigation. The irrigation and drainage infrastructure in these two strategic regions is in urgent \nneed of extensive R&U, including many pumped systems. Both areas also need improved water \nmanagement, especially in the Fergana Valley, which is covered by three separate BISAs and \nassociated institutions and has serious salinity problems in some areas. To support the sector \napproach,  two  core  subprojects  were  prepared  to  assess  the  technical,  social,  financial, \neconomic, and environmental feasibility of subsequent subprojects and the Project as a whole. \nThe  subprojects  are  representative  of  the  proposed  project  investments.  The  Narpay  and \nBesharyk core subproject feasibility studies are in Supplementary Appendixes B and C. \n \n27.  Narpay Core Subproject. The Narpay pump system is located in Narpay District in \nnorthwest Samarkand Province. The area has a continental climate with an average annual \ntemperature of 15\u00b0 centigrade and low rainfall (271 millimeters [mm]), most of which occurs \nduring winter. The command area (8,206 ha) has sierozems (gray desert soils) characterized by \nlow organic content with moderate productivity potential. The average farm size is about 27 ha; \ncotton (57%) and wheat (30%) are the main crops and fodder vegetables, melons, and orchard \nand vineyards are grown on a smaller scale. The pumping plant and irrigation system receive \nwater from the Narpay primary canal, fed by the Zarafshan River. They were established in the \nearly 1970s and have undergone subsequent modification, including the addition of secondary \npumps  with  new  irrigated  area.  The  primary  pumping  plant  has  only  six  of  eight  pumps \noperational and their capacity is only about 75% of their design. This situation\u2014coupled with the \nunreliability of the six remaining pumps\u2014results in frequent partial shutdowns and seriously \nlimits the water available for irrigation, particularly during peak demand for the cotton crop. The \ninter-farm canal system, which distributes water from the pumps, is in fair condition, yet portions \nexist  where  repair  and/or  replacement  of  the  concrete  lining  is  required;  existing  control \nstructures  need  repair  and/or  replacement;  and  a  number  of  additional  control  and \nmeasurement structures are required. The reduced and unreliable pumping plant output, along \nwith efficiency constraints of the distribution network, result in cotton yields considerably below \nthe average for the whole of Narpay District. In the absence of urgent R&U, the productivity of \nthe Narpay system will continue to decline and is in danger of partial or total collapse. \n \n28.  Besharyk  Core  Subproject.  The  Besharyk  pump  irrigation  scheme  is  located  in \nBesharyk District of Fergana Province between the Syr Darya River to the north and Besharyk \ntown to the south. The semiarid area has an average annual air temperature of 15\u00b0 centigrade \nand very low rainfall (128 mm), with most during the winter months. The command area is about \n8,400 ha and has typical (34%) and light (36%) sierozem soils with low organic content and \nmoderate production potential. Average farm size is about 32 ha in size; cotton (48%) and \nwheat (36%) are the main crops, with lesser amounts of maize, vegetables, orchard, and \nperennial fodder crops. The pumping plant takes water directly from the Syr Darya River and \nwas established in 1978. Both the capacity and the level of reliability have declined significantly. \nThe plant was designed with 10 pumps, eight for irrigation and two to supply water to extensive \nfishponds in the area. During the past seven seasons, only four pumps have been operating \nreliably, seriously limiting irrigation supplies. Crop production in the subproject area is also \nlimited by dysfunctional inter-farm and on-farm drains, the resultant high water tables, and \nassociated  increases  in  soil  salinity.  The  pumping  plant,  associated  inter-farm  distribution \nsystem, and the drainage network all require considerable R&U to prevent the possible partial or \ntotal collapse of the system. The inter-farm distribution network also needs to be expanded and \nrationalized to capture the full benefits associated with the production potential of the area. \n \n \n \n ", "  9 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n29.  The  impact  of  the  Project  is  sustained  and  increased  agriculture  production  and \nproductivity. The Project\u2019s outcome is irrigation and drainage systems that are fully functional \nand operated efficiently. \n \nC.  Components and Outputs \n \n30.  The Project will finance investments in three areas: (i) R&U of irrigation and drainage \ninfrastructure, (ii) improved water resources management, and (iii) project management. \n \n  1.  Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Irrigation and Drainage Infrastructure \n \n31.  Project  investments  will  focus  on  pumping  facilities;  gravity  head-works;  inter-farm \ndistribution canals and structures; and inter-farm and on-farm drainage to increase the reliability \nof irrigation supplies, improve water distribution, and reduce soil degradation. The R&U of \npumping facilities and replacement of pumps with more efficient equipment will result in energy \nsavings. Indicative types of R&U include (i) pumping stations comprising replacement and/or \nrepair of intake works, including bulkhead gates and trash racks; replacement of pumps and \nmotors;  upgrading  electrical  control  works;  replacement  of  problematic  and/or  unreliable \nreaches  of the  rising mains;  replacement  of  control  valves;  provision  of  appropriate  surge \nprotection systems; and repair or replacement of auxiliary works such as floor drains, overhead \ncranes, and ventilation systems; (ii) improving either major or minor surface water intakes for \nboth pump and gravity systems to provide greater capture efficiencies and improved control; (iii) \nimproving control structures and gauging stations on inter-farm canals consistent with enhanced \nwater  management  targets;  (iv)  upgrading  and/or  replacing  gated  outlets  to  on-farm  canal \noutlets from the inter-farm canal and providing a means for measuring the discharge at each \noutlet point; (v) providing necessary rationalization of both alignment and grade of the inter-farm \ncanals; (vi) providing adequate cross drainage treatment for the inter-farm canals; (vii) providing \nauxiliary facilities associated with the inter-farm canals such as vehicle and pedestrian bridges \nand canal access for non-irrigation purposes; and (viii) agricultural drainage facilities, especially \nin subproject areas affected by high water table and/or levels of soil salinity.20  \n \n  2.  Improved Water Resources Management \n \n32.  The Project will support improved irrigation, drainage, and water resources management \nfrom the basin to the on-farm level. The Project will also support a basin and irrigation and \ndrainage management institutional optimization and coordination study to prepare a plan and \ncapacity development program to improve water use efficiency and productivity for inter-farm \nirrigation and drainage in the Fergana Valley. The study will (i) analyze existing institutional and \norganization structures of BISAs, ISA, MCA, Department of Pump Station Operations (DPSO), \nWUAs,  local  government,  and  other  relevant  stakeholders;  (ii)  analyze  their  existing \nmanagement  rules,  regulations,  procedures,  and  systems  to  identify  bottlenecks  and \ninefficiencies for irrigation, drainage, and water management; (iii) analyze coordination between \nwater management stakeholders; (iv) develop options and a plan to improve (a) the institutional \nand organization structures, (b) management and operational procedures and systems,21 and \n                                                 \n20 Drainage rehabilitation and upgrading will be directed to all levels of the drainage system including on-farm, \ncollector, and transport drains. \n21 This will include use of improved computing, communications and networks, management information systems, \nand other advanced technical options. \n ", "10 \n(c) coordination between stakeholders; and (v) develop and implement a capacity development \nprogram to support the recommendations. \n \n33.  At  the  on-farm  level,  the  Project will  strengthen  WUAs  and  improve  on-farm  water \nmanagement  through  a  training  program  based  on  the  successful  experience  of  the  SDC \nprogram implemented by IWMI and ICWC SIC. WUA officials and staff will be trained and \nprovided materials in (i) O&M and repairs, (ii) water distribution and management, (iii) basic \nirrigation  system  design,  (iv)  crop  and  irrigation  scheduling,  (v)  system  monitoring  and \nevaluation  (M&E),  (vi)  management  and  collection  of  irrigation  service  fees,  (vii)  financial \nmanagement and auditing, and (viii) dispute resolution mechanisms. WUAs will review the \ndesigns for the inter-farm R&U in their subproject area, and measurement capacity within the on-\nfarm distribution system will be improved for better water management. \n \n34.  The Project will work with BISA, ISA, MCA, DPSO, and WUA staff to develop water \nmanagement and O&M plans for each subproject. WUAs, in cooperation with BISA, ISA, and \nDPSO, will develop specific management plans to optimize on-farm water delivery for efficiency \nand productivity that will be supported through improved coordination and more efficient inter-\nfarm  distribution  and  pump  operation.  To  support  creation  and  implementation  of  the \nmanagement and O&M plans, training will be provided to relevant staff in subproject areas. \n \n3.  Project Management \n \n35.  The  Project  will  provide  implementation  support  to  the  project  management  office \n(PMO),  which  will  be  established  in  Tashkent.  This  will  be  supported  by  two  project \nimplementation units (PIUs)\u2014one in Fergana city and one in Samarkand city. The PMO will \ndeal with technical issues, procurement, accounting, M&E, water resources management, and \nsafeguards. The PMO and PIUs will have national staff supported by national and international \nspecialists. Comprehensive results-based monitoring will be a critical function of the PMO. \n \nD.  Special Features \n \n36.  The Project represents a shift from previous assistance to Uzbekistan in that its focus is \non the R&U of pumps and inter-farm canals and structures and associated water management. \nThe R&U of irrigation infrastructure will introduce more efficient pumps to improve both water \nuse and energy efficiency. The Project explicitly recognizes Uzbekistan\u2019s need to improve water \nuse efficiency and productivity, and uses a comprehensive approach to implement improved \nwater management measures at the (i) overall basin level with BISAs; (ii) inter-farm level \nthrough improved water management and operations of the canal commands and pumps of the \nsubprojects; and (iii) on-farm level through the training of WUAs to manage the on-farm systems \nmore effectively. It will strengthen integration of operations between inter- and on-farm systems. \n \nE.  Investment Plan \n \n37.  The investment plan is estimated at $148 million, including taxes and duties, physical \nand price contingencies, interest charges during implementation, and commitment charges. \nCost estimates by project component are summarized in Table 1.

The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  financial  management;  (ii) \nprocurement and recruitment of consultants; (iii) preparing the periodic reports; (iv) screening, \npreparation, and implementation of subprojects; (v) ensuring compliance with ADB and the \nGovernment\u2019s  environment  and  social  safeguards\u2019  requirements;  (vi)  M&E;  and  (vii) \ncoordinating with relevant agencies. To support PMO activities in the field and coordinate local \nactivities for implementation of subprojects, prior to disbursement of loan proceeds, PIUs will be \nestablished in the Syrdarya-Sokh BISA in Fergana city and in the Zarafshan BISA in Samarkand \ncity. The Project\u2019s organizational structure is in Appendix 6. \n \n41.  The PMO will be headed by a project manager appointed by MAWR and acceptable to \nADB. The project manager will report to the project director. The project manager will be \nsupported by teams of specialists for technical, contracts and procurement, accounting, M&E, \nwater resources management, and safeguards along with administrative staff. Each PIU will be \nheaded by a deputy project manager to be appointed by MAWR, and supported by accounting \nand administrative staff. The deputy project manager will report to the project manager. Each \nsubproject  will  have  a  subproject  coordinator  located  in  the  relevant  PIU  to  facilitate ", "  13 \n \nimplementation of the subproject, and will report to the deputy project manager. PMO and PIU \nstaff will be recruited by the  Executing Agency using procedures acceptable to ADB. The PMO \nand PIUs will be supported by international and national consultants recruited by the Project. \n \n42.  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will establish a project steering \ncommittee  (PSC)  to  be  chaired  by  a  deputy  prime  minister.  The  PSC  will  comprise \nrepresentatives from the cabinet of ministers; MAWR; Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Economy; \nState Committee for Nature Protection (SCNP); and Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations, \nInvestments and Trade. The PSC will (i) guide policy and strategic direction, (ii) review and \nevaluate project performance, (iii) review audited accounts, (iv) resolve issues affecting project \nimplementation as needed, and (v) facilitate inter-agency coordination. The PSC will meet at \nleast semiannually. \n \n43.  A financial management assessment was undertaken during the PPTA. It indicated that \nthe MAWR has satisfactory management capability and systems for financial and accounting \nmanagement, reporting, auditing, and internal controls (Supplementary Appendix D). \n \n  2.  Subproject Selection and Preparation \n \n44.  Subprojects financed subsequent to the Narpay and Besharyk core subprojects will be \nscreened  by  the  PMO  and  selected  based  on  agreed  technical,  economic,  social,  and \nenvironmental criteria. Subproject screening will (i) ensure compliance with safeguards, and \n(ii) provide necessary reconnaissance level studies to confirm remaining criteria. The PMO will \nsubmit its subproject recommendation(s) to the project director and ADB for approval before \nconducting a full feasibility study. Final approval of subprojects for financing will be from both \nthe  Government  and  ADB  and  will  be  based  on  the  results  of  the  feasibility  study  and \ncompliance with the selection criteria. Selection criteria and the subproject approval process are \nin Appendix 7. \n \n3.  Implementation Plan \n \n45.  To expedite project implementation, the preparation works for all subprojects will be \nconducted during the initial 2 years of project implementation. There will be three batches of \nsubprojects, including the first batch comprising two PPTA core subprojects\u2014the Narpay and \nBesharyk subprojects. Subprojects for inclusion in batches 2 and 3 will be identified by the \nPMO, and approved by ADB and the PSC during the Project\u2019s initial year. The feasibility studies \nfor subprojects in subsequent batches will be prepared by the project consultants under the \nPMO\u2019s supervision and will be completed by the end of the third quarter of the second year of \nimplementation. Detailed design work on the two core subprojects will commence immediately \nupon fielding of the individual consultants during the second quarter of the first year. Detailed \ndesign and preparation of tender documents for the subsequent batches will be completed in \nthe first half of the third year. Equipment supply and install contracts and civil works contracts \nfor both Narpay and Besharyk will be awarded near the end of the first year. Works for batch 2 \nsubprojects will be under contract by the end of year 2, and for batch 3 by the middle of year 3. \nSupervision of all construction contracts will be the responsibility of the project consultants \nunder the PMO\u2019s supervision. The detailed implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \nH.  Implementation Period \n \n46.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years, starting in early 2009. The estimated \nproject completion date is 31 December 2014 and the loan closing date is 30 June 2015.  \n ", "14 \n \nI.  Procurement \n \n47.  All ADB-financed procurement of goods, works, and consulting services will follow ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Major contracts will include (i) \nsupply and installation of pump and motors, and rehabilitation of the pumping stations and \nassociated infrastructure; (ii) civil works for rehabilitation of the inter-farm canals, agricultural \ndrains, and associated infrastructure; and (iii) project management and training support. Civil \nworks contracts costing more than $1 million and contracts for supply (and installation) of \nequipment and materials valued at more than $1 million, will be awarded under international \ncompetitive bidding while those valued at $1 million or less will be awarded following national \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.22  Equipment  and  materials  packages \nvalued at less than $100,000 will be procured through the shopping mode. The procurement \nplan is in Appendix 9 and will be updated annually to cover the next 18 months. The relevant \nsections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all bid \ndocuments issued during implementation of the Project.  \n \nJ.  Consulting Services \n \n48.  The Project will provide 154 person-months of international consultants and 490 person-\nmonths  of  national  consultants.  Consulting  services  will  include  project  implementation  for \ncomponents  1  and  2  and  support  to  the  PMO  and  PIUs,  including  planning,  design,  and \nconstruction supervision of rehabilitation and upgrading works as well as project management, \nprocurement, financial management, institutional analysis, and M&E\u2014most of which will be \nprovided under a single contract package.23 The international and national consultants will be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time) using consulting firms, full technical proposals, and quality- and cost-based \nselection  with  80:20  weighting.  Supplementary  Appendix  E  provides  the  detailed  terms  of \nreference. \n \n49.  The joint venture of IWMI and ICWC SIC will be recruited for WUA training and support \nservices using the single source selection method. The joint venture has been involved in \nproviding such services to WUAs for the past 5 years under programs financed by SDC. Based \non this continuing experience, IWMI and ICWC SIC have developed an in-depth understanding \nof Uzbekistan\u2019s WUAs and the challenges they face that uniquely qualifies IWMI and ICWC SIC \nto provide training tailored to their specific requirements. IWMI and SIC are currently carrying \nout WUA training and other water management activities in the Fergana Valley for SDC, and \nextending these to the subproject areas to be rehabilitated under the proposed loan is a natural \nextension of their ongoing activities. Using IWMI and ICWC SIC for WUA training will help to \nmake uniform and promote stronger institutionalization of these efforts throughout the country \nrather than having a piecemeal approach with different contractors. SDC initially contracted \nIWMI and ICWC SIC through single source selection because of concern over the lack of \ncapacity in the country to perform these services. Since then, SDC has evaluated and found \ntheir performance satisfactory and engaged them for further services. The estimated value of \n                                                 \n22  Local civil works contractors in Uzbekistan have the capacity to carry out such work. \n23 To expedite final design and ensure timely procurement associated with the works for both the Narpay and \nBesharyk subprojects during the initial 5 months of project implementation, the PMO will recruit about 14 person-\nmonths of international and 14 person-months of national individual consulting services, so that this work may \nproceed prior to recruitment and fielding of the balance of the required consultants under the main consulting \ncontract. The individual consultants required for this initial effort will be recruited by the PMO in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). ", "  15 \n \nthe current SDC contract is $4 million and the proposed ADB contracting would be far less\u2014\nabout 40% of this amount.24 \n \nK.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n50.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MAWR.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n51.  In relation to the Project, the Government will ensure the disclosure of all project-related \nprocurement actions, including consulting services contracts and the procurement of major \nequipment and civil works, in local newspapers and on the internet. Such disclosed information \nwill  include,  among  other  matters,  the  list  of  participating  bidders;  the  winning  bidder;  a \nsummary of the tender procedures; the value of the contract awarded; and the general terms \nand  specifications  of  the  goods,  works,  or  services  procured.  The  financial  management \ncapacity of the Executing Agency has been assessed as satisfactory. The project civil works \nand equipment procurement have been packaged into a large contract to attract reputable \ncontractors and will require ADB\u2019s approval before being awarded. \n \nL.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n52.   The proceeds of the ADB loan will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  For  consulting  services  and  equipment \nfollowing international competitive bidding procedures, loan funds will be disbursed through \ndirect payment. For civil works following national competitive bidding procedures and small \nexpenditures related to the PMO, reimbursement and imprest fund procedures will be applied. \nAfter  loan  effectiveness,  MAWR  will  open  two  imprest  accounts,  one  for  each  loan  at  a \ncommercial bank in Uzbekistan acceptable to ADB. These imprest accounts will be established \nand managed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Total outstanding advances \nare not to exceed the estimated share of eligible project expenditures to be financed through the \nimprest account for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. ADB\u2019s \nstatement of expenditures procedure will be applied when reimbursing eligible project outlays \nand liquidating and replenishing the imprest accounts for individual payments not exceeding \n$100,000. \n \nM.  Advance Action \n \n53.  To expedite project implementation, advance action is required for recruitment of both \nthe  individual  consultants  who  will  initiate  the  design  work  and  the  preparation  of  tender \ndocuments as well as the main package of consulting services. The Government has been \n                                                 \n24  Parallel cofinancing for WUA activities is currently under consideration by the SDC for tentative approval in January \n2009. Once cofinancing is confirmed, Asian Development Bank  funds for WUA training will be reallocated to civil \nworks, and SDC will undertake recruitment and management of International Water Management Institute and \nInterstate Commission for Water Coordination, Scientific Information Center to execute the WUA training portion of \nthe Project. \n ", "16 \ninformed that (i) advance action will cover actions up to, but not including, contract signing; and \n(ii) approval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project. Advance action will \nenable  early  preparation  of  draft  documents  for  contracting  works  and  services  under  the \nNarpay and Besharyk subprojects and accelerate project implementation. \n \nN.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n54.  MAWR, through the PMO, will establish financial management and accounting systems \nfor  the  Project  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and \nManagement of Investment Projects Financed by the ADB (2002). The PMO will also maintain \nseparate records and accounts for goods, works, and services to be financed out of the loan \nproceeds following sound accounting principles. Independent auditors acceptable to ADB will \naudit these accounts and records yearly. Within 6 months of the close of the financial year, \ncertified copies of the audit report, together with the auditor\u2019s opinion, will be submitted to the \nGovernment and ADB in English. The audit reports will include a management letter and a \nseparate opinion on the use of the imprest accounts and statement of expenditures procedure. \nFor the external audit of accounts, the loan proceeds may finance the services of private \nauditors and the translation of their reports into English. The auditors are to be recruited in a \nmanner acceptable to ADB. \n \n55.  MAWR, through the PMO, will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB. The reports \nwill indicate progress made, problems encountered, steps taken to remedy the problems, and a \nprogram of activities\u2014along with expected progress during the remainder of the implementation \nperiod.  The  reports  will  incorporate  project  performance  monitoring  data  and  all  relevant \nfinancial data. The reporting system will focus on outcomes, efficiency, and quality; and will be \nconsistent with international and local reporting standards, as well as with the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 2). MAWR will also provide other reports and information \nrelating to the Project as ADB may reasonably request. Within 6 months of project completion, \nMAWR will submit a project completion report to ADB that includes information on project \nimplementation, use of both the ADF and OCR loan proceeds, and accomplishments in relation \nto the Project\u2019s outcome and impact. \n \nO.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n56.  The PMO will establish a project performance and monitoring system to monitor the \nProject\u2019s progress in achieving the planned outputs, outcome, and impact within 6 months of \nloan effectiveness. An M&E unit will be established in the PMO to measure results and report \nfindings of the project progress to the Government and ADB. A matrix of indicators will be \nestablished and baseline data for the agreed indicators will be gathered within 6 months of loan \neffectiveness. The indicator data will be updated every 6 months and reported to stakeholders \nand  the  public.  During  loan  review  missions,  the  indicators  will  be  validated  and  may  be \nmodified to reflect project performance and results more accurately. \n \nP.  Project Reviews \n \n57.  MAWR and ADB will jointly conduct periodic reviews to assess (i) physical, institutional, \nand capacity development progress; (ii) financial progress; (iii) implementation arrangements; \nand (iv) identify and resolve problems. The periodic reviews will initially be conducted on a \nsemiannual basis. Starting from the second year of the Project\u2019s implementation and if deemed \nappropriate  by  ADB,  the  periodic  review  may  be  conducted  on  an  annual  basis.  A \ncomprehensive midterm review of the Project will be carried out immediately following physical ", "  17 \n \ncompletion of the R&U of the Narpay and Besharyk core subprojects and completion of the final \ndesign for the batch 3 subprojects (expected to be toward the end of year 3 according to the \nimplementation  schedule).  The  midterm  review  will  evaluate  (i)  project scope,  design,  and \nimplementation arrangements; (ii) progress against agreed indicators, including the design and \nmonitoring framework; (iii) procurement performance; (iv) performance of the consultants; and \n(v) any other parameter agreed by MAWR and ADB. At the conclusion of the midterm review, \nADB  and  MAWR  may  agree  on  changes  in  both  project  scope  and  implementation \narrangements, as deemed necessary. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Project Benefits \n \n58.  Project benefits include (i) reduced production losses, (ii) increased energy efficiency, \n(iii) improved water management, (iv) decreased land degradation caused by soil salinity and \nwaterlogging,  (v)  increased  irrigation  efficiency,  (vi)  enhanced  farm  productivity  through \nincreased yields and cropping intensity, and (vii) increased rural livelihoods. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Analysis \n \n1.  Economic Analysis \n \n59.  A  financial and  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  for the  two  subprojects  and  an \neconomic analysis was carried for the Project as a whole. For the economic analyses, a shadow \nexchange rate of SUM1,320 to $1.00 was used. Costs are expressed in constant 2008 prices. \nEconomic values for cotton, wheat, maize, and fertilizer were calculated using border parity \nprices.  A  shadow  wage  rate  conversion  factor  of  0.85  is  used  because  of  local \nunderemployment. Appendix 10 provides a Summary Financial and Economic Analysis while \nthe detailed economic and financial information is presented in Supplementary Appendix F, and \nSupplementary Appendix G provides the detailed cost tables. \n \n60.  Economic Benefits. The total R&U costs of the Narpay subproject are estimated at \n$13.05 million, including contingencies. The R&U of the eight pumps and motors contributes \n78% to the cost while R&U of the irrigation network is estimated to cost only 10% of total cost. \nThe  R&U  costs  for  the  Besharyk  subproject are  higher,  at  a  cost of  $24.233 million  with \ncontingencies. Replacement of the pumps, repair of the rising main, and widening of the intake \nchannel  contribute  57%  of  costs  while  expansion  of  the  delivery  system  contributes  20%. \nDrainage needs are much greater in Besharyk and comprise nearly 5% of the R&U costs. \n \n61.  The  main  project  benefit  is  sustained  and  improved  agricultural  productivity.25  The \nbenefits  include  an  increase  in  crop  yield  of  5%,  a  20%  efficiency  improvement  in  pump \noperation, and a 10% improvement in water use efficiency. The Narpay subproject economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is 15.4%. The Besharyk subproject has an EIRR of 13.4%. \nBesharyk is more sensitive than Narpay, and both are most robust with regard to increases in \nelectricity, O&M, or initial capital costs. Both have some sensitivity to changes in net benefits or \nwheat and cotton prices. The analysis is based on state-mandated cropping patterns, and \nreturns will improve as policies liberalize and farmers can grow more wheat or other crops with \n                                                 \n25  Benefits are conservative since the without-project scenario does not assume complete failure of all pumps, and \ntherefore, the analysis does not assess the social costs that would result from complete pump failure and total loss \nof production. \n ", "18 \nhigher returns.26 Analysis of the core subprojects has been extended to the Project as a whole, \nincluding improved water management at the basin level, and yields an EIRR of 15.5%. \n \n  2.  Financial Analysis \n \n62.  A farm budget analysis was conducted for an average farm of 30 ha. The results indicate \nthat the Project would increase incomes up to 127% versus the without-project scenario. The \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \nC.  Environmental and Social Safeguards \n \n1.  Environment \n \n63.  The Project falls under category B for environment. Initial environmental examinations \n(IEE)  were  prepared  for  each  subproject.  The  Project  is  unlikely  to  cause  any  significant \nenvironmental impacts and will be beneficial because of drainage improvements. Potential \nimpacts, mitigation measures, and reporting requirements are presented in the environmental \nmitigation  and  monitoring  plan  (EMP)  prepared  for  each  subproject.  The  EMP  defines \ninstitutional responsibilities and provides cost estimates. The monitoring program under the \nEMP of the subprojects includes provisions for regular sampling of the water quality from the \nirrigation pump intakes and the drainage outlet from each WUA area. Individual designs for \ninfrastructure R&U are to be submitted to the SCNP for review. These designs should include a \nsite-specific environmental mitigation plan that is based on generic guidelines provided in the \nIEE, which sets out environmental safeguards and mitigation measures to be incorporated in \ntender documentation for design and works contracts. The project site supervisors and the PMO \nwill monitor compliance with these safeguards and mitigation measures, which will be subject to \ninspection by the SCNP. An environmental assessment and review procedure (EARP) was \nprepared to provide guidance for preparation of IEEs and EMPs to ensure compliance with ADB \npolicies and Uzbek law. The IEEs, EARP, and summary IEEs are in Supplementary Appendix \nH.  \n \n  2.  Involuntary Resettlement \n \n64.  The Project will involve R&U of existing pump stations, inter-farm irrigation canals, and \ndrainage systems. It is anticipated that all R&U works will be within the boundaries of the \nGovernment\u2019s right-of-way for existing structures, canals, and drains. Rehabilitation activities, \nsuch as replacement of pumps and rehabilitation of canals, will be phased to ensure there is no \ndisruption to the on-farm irrigation water supply. Civil works implementation will be scheduled \nduring the non-vegetation season to minimize the risk of disruption. It is not anticipated that any \nland acquisition or permanent displacement will take place. Any impact would be associated \nwith construction and should be limited in its scope and duration. A resettlement framework with \ncompensation matrix has been prepared and agreed with the Government, consistent with \nADB\u2019s policy for sector projects, to address any impact, should it occur. Appendix 12 provides a \nsummary and Supplementary Appendix I provides more detailed resettlement information. \n \n3.  Indigenous Peoples \n \n65.  Based on the poverty and social assessment, no ethnic minority issues are present in \nthe project area and no indigenous peoples safeguard issues exist. \n                                                 \n26 Crop prices are based on World Bank long-term projections for cotton, wheat, and other commodities. ", "  19 \n \n \nD.  Community Participation and Gender \n \n  1.  Participation \n \n66.  The Project has been prepared in consultation with stakeholders including MAWR staff, \ndistrict  agricultural  departments,  WUAs,  pump  operators,  private  farmers,  dekhan  farmers, \nhousehold plots owners, and members of the community within the Narpay and Besharyk core \nsubproject areas. Socioeconomic surveys were undertaken to inform potential beneficiaries \nabout the Project, obtain baseline socioeconomic data, seek perceptions on project activities, \nand identify indicators for M&E. The consultation process will continue with all stakeholders \nduring the course of project implementation to ensure involvement of WUA members and \nfarmers in the planning of the R&U works, especially for inter-farm canals and drains. \n \n  2.  Gender \n \n67.  More than 50% of the population in Uzbekistan is women, and 64% of the population \nlives in rural areas. Women\u2019s share in the economically active population is 48%. The Project \nwill not have an adverse impact on women and girls and will be gender-neutral. (Appendix 13 \nand Supplementary Appendix J). The project design was developed to (i) include a gender \nspecialist in the PMO; (ii) set out an information campaign that clearly identifies the role of \nwomen in the Project; (iii) establish and train monitoring groups; and (iv) disaggregate key input, \noutput, and outcome indicators by gender. \n \nE.  Project Risks and Sustainability \n \n68.  The design and monitoring framework (Appendix 2) sets out a comprehensive list of \nrisks and assumptions for the Project. \n \n69.  Sustaining  O&M  of  the  R&U  of  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  is  a  key  risk  to \nachievement of the outcome and impact. Government budget allocations will be monitored to \nassure adequate and timely provision of budgetary funds.  \n \n70.  Delays in the implementation of civil works, caused by slow procurement procedures at \nthe government level, is another risk. To avoid serious delays, especially at the start-up stage, \nadvance action will be undertaken on staff recruitment.  \n \n71.  Other risks include macroeconomic shocks and commodity price instability. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n72.  In addition to the standard assurances regarding, among others, accounting, auditing \nand anticorruption, the Government and MAWR have agreed to the following assurances:  \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that throughout the implementation of the Project, \nadequate budgetary allocation of the required counterpart funds are approved \nand released in a timely manner to ensure proper implementation of the Project. \n ", "20 \n(ii)  The Government through MAWR will ensure that timely and adequate funds will \nbe made available for the O&M of all subprojects selected for rehabilitation and \nupgrading based on the O&M plans developed under the Project. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that MAWR operates and maintains the subprojects \nselected for rehabilitation and upgrading based on the O&M plans developed \nunder the Project. \n(iv)  The Government through MAWR will make all reports, drawings, maps, and \nhistorical data on soil, water and land use characteristics, and other information \nrelevant to project implementation available to the PMO and PIU in a timely \nmanner. \n(v)  The Government through MAWR will ensure that all subprojects will be selected \nand approved based on the subproject selection criteria and approval procedures \nas detailed in Appendix 7 of the RRP and the draft Loan Agreement. \n(vi)  The  Government  through  MAWR  will  ensure  that  the  contractors  employed \nunder the Project will (a) fully comply with applicable labor laws, (b) provide \nprompt and equal pay to men and women for work of equivalent value, and (c) \nprovide  adequate  safety  and  health  protection  for  both  male  and  female \nworkers. The Government will further ensure no minors will be employed in \nproject-related activities. \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that all project-related activities will be carried out in \naccordance with (a) the applicable environmental laws and regulations of the \nGovernment, (b) ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), and (c) the IEE. For each \nsubproject, the Government will ensure that the IEE, which will include the EMP, \nwill be prepared following the EARP. The Government will further ensure that \nadequate  budgetary  provisions  will  be  made  for  (a)  conducting  IEEs, \n(b) implementation of mitigation measures, (c) environmental monitoring in the \nEMPs, and (d) institutional arrangements for coordination and supervision as \nidentified in the IEE and the EARP. \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that prior to the issuance of the bidding documents \nfor particular subproject, ADB will have (a) reviewed and approved the initial \nenvironmental  examinations  of  the  subproject  including  the  environmental \nmanagement plan or their revised versions; and (b) received the Government\u2019s \nclearances, approvals or permits for such documents. \n(ix)  The Government will ensure that all land acquisition and resettlement activities \nunder the subprojects will be done in accordance with (a) the land acquisition \nand  resettlement  framework  agreed  by  the  Government  and  ADB;  (b)  the \nrelevant laws, regulations, and procedures of the Government; and (c) ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The Government will make its best effort \nto  ensure  that  the  civil  works  under  the  Project  will  (a)  be  undertaken  on \ngovernment rights-of-way so that no persons will be affected by involuntary \nresettlement, and (b) not disrupt any agricultural activities. In the event that any \ncivil works activities will be conducted beyond the government rights-of-way, \nwhich  results  in  land  acquisition  and/or  involuntary  resettlement,  the \nGovernment will promptly prepare a resettlement plan (based on the detailed \ndesigns and) in accordance with (a) ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, and \n(b) the land acquisition and resettlement framework. \n ", "  21 \n \n(x)  Prior to the award of a civil works contract that involves land acquisition or \ninvoluntary resettlement, the Government will have submitted and ADB will have \nreviewed and approved the resettlement plan for the subproject associated with \nthe works contract. \n(xi)  Prior to the issuance of the notice to proceed for any civil works that involve land \nacquisition or involuntary resettlement, the Government will have adequately \ncompensated the affected people in accordance with the resettlement plan. \n(xii)  The Government will ensure that the gender action plan is implemented in a \ntimely manner over the project period, and that adequate resources are allocated \nfor this purpose. The implementation of the gender action plan will be closely \nmonitored, and its progress will be reported in the quarterly reports to ADB. \n \nB.  Conditions for Disbursement \n \n73.

Sector Overview \n \n1.  Economy and Agriculture. Uzbekistan had an estimated per capita gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) of about $650 in 2006. GDP growth rates have increased from 3.8%\u20134.0% \nduring 2000\u20132003 to an annual average of over 7.0% during 2004\u201320061 and 9.5% in 2007.2 \nAgriculture growth has fluctuated from 3.1% in 2000, to 10.1% in 2004 to 5.6% in 2007. It is \nexpected to decline to 4%\u20135% over the next 3 years. The share of agriculture in GDP has also \ndeclined from 30.1% in 2000 to 24.1% in 2006 (footnote 1). Despite this relative decline in \ngrowth, agriculture remains an important sector in the economy, accounting for 70% of domestic \ntrade, 35%\u201340% of industrial output (about 7.8% of GDP), about 25% of export earnings, and \n33% of national employment. However, while poverty declined from 27.5% in 2001 to 25.8% in \n2005, poverty reduction in rural areas declined less than in urban areas. About 64% of the \npopulation lives in rural areas, which are either directly or indirectly reliant on agriculture. Rural \ncommunities account for more than 70% of the poor in Uzbekistan. This underscores the \nimportance of improving rural livelihoods through increased agricultural productivity. \n \n2.  Water Resources, Irrigation, and Drainage. Uzbekistan is an arid country and has \naverage rainfall of 264 millimeters (mm), from a low 97 mm in the northwest to 425 mm in the \nmountainous areas. The country lies fully within the Amu Darya river basin that covers 86.5% of \nthe land, and the Syr Darya river basin that covers 13.5% of the land. These rivers and their \ntributaries provide all the water resources to support irrigated agriculture. However, the water \nthey supply varies considerably on a seasonal basis and with regard to the location in the \ncountry, with many areas suffering extreme water scarcity. Because of Uzbekistan\u2019s arid climate \nand the variability in availability of water resources, almost all agriculture has always been \ndependent  on  irrigation.  Irrigation  takes  place  on  90%  of  the  farmed  arable  land  and  is \nresponsible for nearly all agricultural production. It consumes 85% of all water resources and \nrequires about 57 cubic kilometers (km3) annually. Accordingly, development and management \nof irrigation and drainage infrastructure and improved water management are key government \npriorities. \n \n3.   Uzbekistan has 4.3 million hectares (ha) of irrigated land (2.35 million ha in the Amu \nDarya river basin and 1.95 million ha in the Syr Darya river basin). This is over 40% of all \nirrigation in Central Asia, and nearly double that of Kazakhstan, which ranks next in terms of \nirrigated area. In 1960, Uzbekistan had less than 2.6 million ha, yet by 1990, the Soviet Union \nhad expanded irrigation to its current area. This was mainly for intensive cotton production. The \nrapid development of intensive irrigated agriculture throughout Central Asia during this period is \nlargely responsible for desiccation of the Aral Sea and the associated environmental, social, and \neconomic disaster. However, the massive investment economically transformed many areas in \nUzbekistan  and  improved  the  livelihoods  of  rural  communities  who  are  now  completely \ndependent on the flow of irrigation water. \n \n4.  To support this vast irrigated area, Uzbekistan has an extensive network of irrigation and \ndrainage infrastructure divided into two types: (i) inter-farm, and (ii) and on-farm systems. The \ninter-farm system comprises the large intake structures for water irrigation supply, and the main \nand distributary canals that convey water to the farm level outlets as well as the large collector \n                                                 \n1  Government of Uzbekistan. 2007.

", "Appendix 3  27 \ndrains  that  move  drainage  water  from  irrigated  areas.  The  on-farm  system  comprises  the \nsmaller field channels and associated structures that distribute the water to farmers\u2019 fields as \nwell as the smaller drainage systems that take water from the field and lower the water table to \nprevent the problems of salinization and waterlogging that occur in many areas. Irrigation in \nUzbekistan primarily relies on surface water that is distributed both by gravity and a widespread \nnetwork of pumps of various sizes. In some areas, such as the Fergana Valley, all these \nirrigation  and  drainage  facilities  are  intertwined  in  a  complex  and  interlinked  system. \nUzbekistan\u2019s irrigation and drainage infrastructure includes (i) 30,000 kilometers (km) of main \nand  inter-farm  canals with  over  33,000  hydraulic structures;  (ii)  more  than  1,500  pumping \nfacilities,  with  almost  5,000  pumps  that  supply  irrigation  water  to  over  2  million  ha; \n(iii) 175,000 km  of  on-farm  canals  and  conveyance  structures;  (iv)  40,000  km  of  on-farm \nhorizontal  drains  and  4,300  vertical  drains;  (v)  120,000  km  of  drainage  ditches;  and \n(vi) 15,000 km of large drainage collectors. \n \n5.  Agriculture and Farming Systems. Cotton is the priority crop grown, and Uzbekistan is \nthe world\u2019s sixth largest producer. Cotton received extensive and intensive development under \nthe Soviet Union. Since Uzbekistan\u2019s independence in 1992, wheat self-sufficiency also became \na strategic priority of the Government, and it was first achieved in 1997. Wheat and cotton \ncomprise the vast majority of agricultural production, with cotton grown on about 41% of the \nirrigated area and wheat on 42% of the irrigated area. \n \n6.  Irrigated farm production is based on three types of farms: (i) shirkat farms, which were \ncreated  from  Soviet  collective  farms;  (ii)  private  farms;  and  (iii)  dekhan  (small  inheritable \nhousehold  plot  [0.15\u20130.35  hectares]  free  from  Government  quotas  for  crop  selection  and \nmarketing) farms. The shirkats were formed during the 1990s as a reform of the former state \nfarms, but their operation was still based on collective ownership of the farm assets, and their \nperformance  was  poor.  As  a  remedy,  the  Government  increased  efforts  to  \u201cprivatize\u201d  the \nshirkats by breaking them into smaller parcels and selling them for management and operation \nby individuals. By 2004, 125,000 private farms had been established on over 2.3 million ha, and \ntoday all of the shirkats have been eliminated and converted to private farms.  \n \n7.  While many of the shirkats have been privatized to individuals, is the private farms are \nstill controlled by the Government, which dictates the production and marketing of cotton and \nwheat. Farmers are subject to quotas to grow large areas of cotton and wheat with subsidized \ncredits and inputs. They are also required to sell 50% of the wheat and cotton harvest to the \nGovernment below world market prices. The Government controls a significant portion of the \nvalue chain for these crops. The production quotas tied to cotton and wheat also require \nintensive water use and contribute to salinization and land degradation. In addition, land use \ncontracts are often not registered or recognized, so local authorities can evict farmers who do \nnot meet production quotas, and the title of the land is not transferable to another user. This \nsituation limits incentives for private productivity investments and limits credit availability since \nfarms are not viable collateral. The wheat and cotton cropping rotation does not allow for \nperiodic fallowing of land or rotation with fodder or other crops to replenish soil nutrients and \nabsorb salts. Dekhan farms are generally quite small fringe holdings, and their land rights are \nclearly established to private individuals, which allow secure long-term possession and free \ncropping patterns. There are about 4 million\u20135 million of these small dekhan farms, and they \nproduce  nearly  one-fifth  of  the  country\u2019s  grains,  nearly  all  of  the  horticulture,  and  provide \nimportant cash income for farmers. \n \n \n \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems, Opportunities, and Lessons \n \n8.  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Needs.  During  the  time  of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  new \ninfrastructure  was  constructed  and  existing  infrastructure  improved,  but  its  condition  has \ndeteriorated since independence. The state\u2019s share in agricultural investment has declined, from \n27% in 1991 to 8% in 2001. From 1995 to 2002, government funding for the water sector \ndropped from 2.9% to 1.8% of GDP\u2014a 60% decrease. At the same time, resources for capital \ninvestment in the water sector declined from 0.9% to 0.6% of GDP, reducing funds for operation \nand maintenance (O&M) by a third. Currently, it is estimated that deferred capital and O&M \nexpenditures are about 40% of the irrigation and drainage asset value. \n \n9.  The  irrigation  and  drainage  system  needs  substantial  rehabilitation  and  upgrading \n(R&U), and major irrigation structures are at risk of failure that would cause significant losses in \nagricultural production. The following R&U needs have been identified throughout the country (i) \ntotal reconstruction of 32% of the main and inter-farm canals, and repair of 24% of them; (ii) \nrebuilding of 42% of the on-farm irrigation network, and repairs for 17%; (iii) replacement and \nmodernization of the mechanical equipment of 18 of the 42 large-intake structures (about 10\u2013\n300 cubic meters per second [m3/sec]) and reconstruction of 5; (iv) 16 of the 27 inspected \nreservoirs are nonfunctional or threatened with sedimentation; (v) 19,000 km of on-farm drains \nneed de-silting, and 11,500 km of open and subsurface drains need reconstruction or repair; \nand (vi) only about 50% of the subsurface horizontal drainage systems are operational. To \nrectify this situation will require sustained R&U investment into the system, and new modalities \nfor O&M are required to prevent further deterioration and to ensure that investment returns are \nsustainable following system R&U. \n \n10.  Pumped irrigation provides water to about half the irrigated area in Uzbekistan and \nposes unique challenges. It includes the three massive irrigation pump cascades systems from \nthe Amu Darya River that include the Amu Bukhara, Karshi, and Amu Zhang systems. Together, \nthe systems irrigate over 800,000 ha of land, and entire regions with numerous towns and \nvillages and millions of people are dependent on their continued operation. Amu Zhang is \ncurrently being rehabilitated through ADB support although the other two large cascades also \nneed urgent rehabilitation.3 Other smaller yet still substantial pumped irrigation facilities are \nlocated throughout all the gravity irrigation networks, with schemes in the range of 5,000\u201310,000 \nha  reliant  on  pumps  being  quite  common.  Almost  all  irrigation  and  drainage  pumps  in \nUzbekistan are operating beyond their design life and adequate resources have been lacking for \ntheir  maintenance  since  independence.  Many  pumps  are  starting  to  fail,  and  without \nintervention, many more are likely to fail soon. Of the 76 very large pumping facilities with \ncapacities greater than 100 m3/sec, 60 require immediate rehabilitation. In addition, 400 of the \n1,000  smaller  pumped  systems,  with  capacities  of  10  m3/sec  or  less  need  immediate \nrehabilitation or replacement. Energy for pumped irrigation accounts for 70% of the annual O&M \nbudget of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR), and consumes 20% of \nUzbekistan\u2019s electricity. Substantial investment is needed for R&U of the pumped systems since \ntheir failure would eliminate a significant portion of irrigated areas and substantially reduce the \nlivelihoods of rural communities farming in these systems. Opportunities also exist to increase \nthe  efficiency  of  smaller  pumped  extension  systems  through  new  pump  technology,  more \ndemand-responsive operating regimes, and improved irrigation techniques. \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2003.

", "Appendix 3  29 \n11.  The state of irrigation and drainage infrastructure, combined with current irrigation and \nwater resources management practices, result in generally low agricultural productivity. Average \nwater  withdrawal  for  irrigation  is  14,000  cubic  meters  (m3)  per  ha,  compared  with               \n9,000\u201310,000 m3 in countries with similar climates. Irrigation efficiency nationwide is only about \n40%. The result is wasted water, overloaded drainage systems, and worsening land salinization. \nMAWR estimates that more than 20,000 ha of land goes out of production each year because of \nsalinity caused by poor water management and inadequate drainage. The salinity affects cotton \nyields, which decline by 20%\u201330% on slightly salinized land, and up to 80% on highly salinized \nland.  Some  degree  of  salinization  and  waterlogging  affects  47%  of  all  irrigated  land. 4  \nProductivity in irrigated agriculture dropped by 15% in the immediate post-Soviet era but has \nnow recovered slightly. However, yields are still lower than they should be, with an average of \n2.25 tons per ha for cotton and 4.2 tons per ha for wheat. \n \n12.  Transboundary Water Resources Management. The total runoff for water resources \ngenerated in Uzbekistan is about 11.5 km3 per year while the total demand for irrigation is about \n57 km3. The rest of the required flow comes from upstream counties in the Amu Darya and Syr \nDarya rivers. During the time of the former Soviet Union, interstate allocations were centrally \nmanaged to support irrigation in the summer, and upstream countries were supplied with energy \nduring the winter months. In 1992, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and in response to \nthe Aral Sea crisis, the Central Asian republics5 established the Interstate Commission for \nWater Coordination (ICWC) to oversee water allocation. Although there are no permanent \nwater-sharing  agreements,  water  allocation  is  decided  twice  a  year  under  the  ICWC  and \nmanaged by the basin water management organizations for the Syr Darya and Amu Darya \nunder the ICWC.6 \n \n13.  Institutional  Framework  for  Irrigation  and  Drainage.  The  legal  and  regulatory \nframework for the irrigation and drainage in Uzbekistan is mainly derived from the Law on Water \nand  Water  Use,  1993,  that  addresses  water  rights  and  allocation,  O&M  of  irrigation  and \ndrainage systems, and resolution of water disputes. The Law on Water and Water Use, 1993, \nalso gives MAWR overall responsibility for water resources. Within MAWR, the Directorate for \nWater Management (DWM) is the primary organization responsible for the development, O&M, \nand management of irrigation and drainage infrastructure. \n \n14.  The responsibilities of DWM include the following: (i) measure and report water use on \nthe irrigation and drainage system; (ii) analyze forecasts of water supply and demand, work out \nwater balances, and determine water withdrawal limits for river basins and water use within the \nbasin; (iii) provide permits for water use and establish water allocations; (iv) annually monitor \nthe ameliorative condition of irrigated land and register the ameliorative categories of land \n(degrees  of  salinization);  (v)  propose  measures  to improve  the  condition  and  operation  of \nirrigation  and  drainage  systems  and  prevent  land  degradation;  (vi)  introduce  innovative \ntechnologies  and  create  long-term  plans  for  increasing  water  productivity;  (vii)  conduct \ninvestment policy; (viii) assess feasibility of developing new irrigation areas and reconstruction \nof existing irrigation systems; (ix) oversee project design, and research and manage civil works \nfor  irrigation  and  drainage  systems;  and  (x)  approve  projects  related  to  developing  and \nmanaging irrigation and drainage systems. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB is helping to address this situation through ADB. 2006.

The decree of the Cabinet of Ministers7 reorganized MAWR from a provincial and district \nadministrative basis to a water basin principle, in which all river basins and subbasins are \nmanaged by basin irrigation system administrations (BISAs) under DWM.8 Ten BISAs have \nbeen formed throughout the country. The territory of each BISA is organized into main canal \nadministrations  (MCAs)  and  irrigation  system  administrations  (ISAs).  MCAs  and  ISAs  are \nstructured  according  to  sections  of  the  canal  system  and  the  main  diversion  structures. \nAccording to the charters of BISAs, MCAs, and ISAs, their roles and responsibilities in O&M are \nsimilar, applied at their respective levels of the irrigation and drainage system and include the \nfollowing: (i) compile and implement plans for preventive maintenance and capital development; \n(ii) MCAs reach agreements with ISAs and pump stations for water delivery within the allocation \nlimits set by the BISA; (iii) ISAs conclude and execute agreements for water delivery from MCAs \nand pump stations and to water users\u2019 associations (WUAs); (iv) provide timely water supply to \nfarmers; (v) equip infrastructure with water-measuring devices and measure and report water \ndeliveries  and  withdrawals  on  the  system;  (vi)  enforce  the  observance  of  water-related \nlegislation and water withdrawal limits; (vii) enforce water distribution; and (viii) aid in conducting \nthe state water cadastre and making annual estimates of the availability of irrigated land within \nthe  service  area.  Although  the  creation  of  BISAs  was  a  substantial  improvement  for \nmanagement of water resources and irrigation and drainage management practice, and BISAs \nhave a legacy of Soviet engineering expertise, BISAs would benefit from exposure to advanced \nirrigation and water management methods to help them manage water more effectively. \n \n16.  The  Department  of  Pump  Stations,  Energy,  and  Communications  (DPSEC)  is \nresponsible  for  the  main  and  inter-farm  pump  stations  but  was  not  a  part  of  the  MAWR \nreorganization to the BISA framework in 2003. At the national level, DPSEC is under MAWR but \nDPSEC has branch offices in each province, directly financed from MAWR\u2014not through BISAs. \nDPSEC has its own administrative structure and management, and in addition to pumps, it is \nresponsible for providing communications to all water management organizations, including \nBISAs. DPSEC is also responsible for O&M of some on-farm pump stations because new \nWUAs cannot afford to keep the pumps running and local authorities often force DPSEC take on \nthe responsibility. \n \n17.  In  addition  to  management  of  the  surface  and  pump  irrigation  systems,  MAWR  is \nresponsible for O&M for drainage. At the province level, MAWR has a branch office of the \nDepartment of Land Reclamation, the Hydrogeological Ameliorative Expedition (HAE), which is \ndirectly financed from central Government. HAE is supposed to fall within the BISA framework, \naccording to establishing legislation. However, the BISA has no direct mandate that specifically \nrelates to the responsibilities for groundwater, drainage, and reclamation, so the relationship is \none more of close cooperation than direct control. HAE has its own administrative structure and \nmanagement and is responsible for (i) maintenance and rehabilitation of the main and inter-farm \ndrainage system (including drainage pumping stations) in each BISA, (ii) assessment of the \ncondition of drainage systems, and (iii) monitoring water table levels as well as soil and water \nsalinity levels. Normally, if a WUA wants help from HAE for cleaning or repair of any part of the \non-farm drainage network, the cost is paid by the WUA to HAE. In 2008, the Government \napproved $75 million for an amelioration fund from the land tax to improve drainage. Under this \nfund, both the inter-farm and on-farm drainage networks will be rehabilitated using government \nfunds. \n                                                 \n7  Decree No. 320, dated 21 June 2003. \n8  BISAs are organized based more on the existing irrigation and drainage system infrastructure rather than strictly on \nthe natural watersheds or catchments of the country. However, this is based on hydrological boundaries and \nrepresents a more logical way to manage irrigation and drainage than the previous system. ", "Appendix 3  31 \n \n18.  Water Users\u2019 Associations. With the conversion of the shirkats to private farms, the \nformer  state-supported  O&M  and  management  of  the  on-farm  irrigation  and  drainage \ninfrastructure has been eliminated, and WUAs have been established in their place. By law, \nWUAs have responsibility for the on-farm system and are obligated to observe water allocation \nlimits, maintain infrastructure, take measures to reduce land salinization, observe sustainable \ncrop rotations, adopt water-saving technologies, and endeavor to increase water productivity. \nWUAs  are  forbidden  to  operate  inter-farm  infrastructure  for  the  purpose  of  increasing  or \ndecreasing water supply. The experience with WUAs in Uzbekistan is limited and variable. \nAlthough they have been established in most cases, there is no institutionalized program within \nMAWR that provides for their training or resources to support their establishment, and they have \ndeveloped under various models. They also lack equipment since much of the equipment that \nwas supposed to be transferred to them from the shirkats was sold off prior to transfer or is not \nfunctional. WUA sizes vary, with some entire districts put under one WUA. Responsibilities also \nvary depending on the type and complexity of system that has been transferred. Financial \nsustainability is also difficult since WUA membership fees, along with the rate of collection from \nfarmers. The WUAs also have limited options in their ability to collect payment. The Swiss \nAgency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) has provided training and support for some \nWUAs. This has significantly improved their performance with regard to water management and \nsystem O&M, and provides experience from which to scale up a broader training effort. WUAs \nplay a vital role in improving the productivity of irrigated agriculture and water management, yet \nthey require greater support to fulfill this mandate more effectively. \n \n19.  Water Management. Given the importance of irrigation and the reliance of Uzbekistan \non water coming across its borders, effective water management is essential within the country. \nImproving the technical competence of the BISAs, MCAs, and ISAs can improve water use \nefficiency and productivity. Capacity building for water management should complement any \ninter-farm investment in infrastructure to help realize its full potential. The inter-farm irrigation \nsystem would also benefit from improved water monitoring, measurement, and more effective \nmanagement. Potential exists to improve water use efficiency by upgrading existing structures \nand controls through new operational procedures, automation, and supervisory control and data \nacquisition  systems.  MAWR  has  already  seen  positive  benefits  from  limited  use  of  these \nmeasures in the Fergana Valley and in the Zarafshan river basin under programs by the United \nStates Agency for International Development and SDC. More comprehensive application of \nthese  technologies,  with  associated  training  for  BISAs,  can  further  improve  water  use \nefficiencies.  \n \n20.  Efficiency gains can be achieved through better planning and integration of ISA staff \noperating the inter-farm canals and structures, and WUA staff operating on-farm canals, to \noptimize water deliveries. Especially in the pump systems, which have greater flexibility and can \nbe more demand-responsive, better communication and coordination between WUAs and ISA \nstaff  could  yield  substantial  benefits.  As  noted,  on-farm  water  management  is  under  the \nsupervision of the WUAs, which need capacity development for improved water management. \nIn cases where training has been provided combined with measurement structures in the on-\nfarm canals, savings of 10%\u201320% have been realized along with productivity improvements. All \nlevels of irrigation in Uzbekistan can be made more efficient with improved water management.  \n \n ", "32  Appendix 4 \n \nMAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE AGRICULTURE AND WATER SECTORS \n \nFunding  Amount \nProject  Source ($ million)  Year  Location \n \nCotton Subsector Improvement  World Bank 66.0  1995\u20132005  National \nRural Enterprise Support Project (Appraisal) World Bank 36.0  2001\u20132006  Five districts \nDrainage, Irrigation, and Wetlands  World Bank 60.0  2003\u20132010  Three districts in \nImprovement  South \nKarakalpakstan \nIrrigation and Drainage Sector Strategy  World Bank \u2014  2007\u20132008  Fergana \nRural Enterprise Support Project II  World Bank 68.0  2008\u20132020  National \nAk Altin Agricultural Development  ADB  36.0  2000\u20132006  Ak Altin \nThe Grain Productivity Improvement  ADB  26.0  2004\u20132009  Tashkent, \nSamarkand, Jizzak \nAmu Zhang Irrigation Rehabilitation  ADB  73.0  2004\u20132009  Sukhandarya \nLand Improvement Project  ADB  76.18  2006\u20132012  Three districts \nIrrigated Agriculture and Food Industry  EU  1.6  1997\u20132001  National \nDevelopment \n \nRegional Agricultural Development  EU  2.4  1997\u20132001   \nSupply of O&M Equipment to the MAWR  PRC  5.1  2005\u20132006  Navoi, Bukhara, \nKashkadarya, and \nother provinces \nIntegrated Water Management  SDC/IWMI  4.8  2001\u20132008  Kyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and \nUzbekistan \nRegional Special Initiative Water Program  USAID  10.0  2002\u20132005   \nNatural Resources Management  USAID  25.0  2000\u20132005  Kyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and \nUzbekistan (various \nprovinces) \nWater User\u2019s Associations Support  USAID  25.0  2004\u20132009  Kyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and \nUzbekistan \nTotal    515.08     \n\u2014 = under preparation, No data available. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; EU = European Union; IWMI = International Water Management Institute; MAWR = \nMinistry of Agriculture and Water Resources; O&M = operation and maintenance; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; \nSDC = Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation; USAID = United States Agency for International Development. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.

Indicative Screening Costs \n \n1.  In screening potential additional subprojects, the following broad and guiding financial \nparameters may be applied that are indicative of economic viability. For pump schemes, an \ninvestment level of generally less than $3,000 per hectare (ha) should be considered while the \nper ha cost indicators for gravity-fed schemes should be much lower, perhaps half of that for \npump schemes.1 These financial criteria would be applied at the time of initial subproject \nscreening. However, a 12% economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is the defining economic \ncriterion that will be confirmed at feasibility level preparation. \n \nB.  Subproject Approval \n \n2.  Subprojects financed subsequent to the Narpay and Besharyk core subprojects under \nthe Project will be screened by the project management office (PMO) and selected based on \nagreed  technical,  economic,  social,  agricultural,  and  environmental  criteria  listed  below. \nSubproject screening will (i) ensure compliance with social and environmental safeguards of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government, and (ii) provide adequate necessary \nreconnaissance  level  studies  to  confirm  the  remaining  criteria.  The  PMO  will  submit  its \nsubproject recommendation to the project director and ADB for approval before conducting a full \nfeasibility study. Final approval of subprojects for financing will come from both the Government \nand ADB, and will be based on the results of the feasibility study and compliance with the \nselection criteria.  \n \nC.  Criteria for Selecting Subprojects \n \n3.  Based on the experience gained in the identification and preparation of the Narpay and \nBesharyk subprojects, exclusionary selection criteria have been adopted. These can be refined \nas the Project progresses subject to the agreement of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water \nResources (MAWR), Ministry of Finance, and ADB. Given the uncertain quality of project-\nrelated data available and the difficulties associated with both locating definitive information and \ndefining  precise  development  targets,  the  exclusionary  approach  is  preferable  to  selection \ncriteria employing a ranking or weighting system. The subproject selection criteria are listed \nbelow. The first set of criteria applies to all possible subprojects, both gravity and pumped \nsystems. An additional set of technical criteria specific to pump schemes was also developed \nand follows the first set of criteria. \n \n1.  Technical \n4.  The subproject must exhibit a current irrigation command area significantly less than that \nenvisaged at design stage or a continuous decline in the size of the irrigated area within the \ncommand area.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The substantial benefits associated with the pump schemes from avoided future production losses resulting from \npump failure render total benefits associated with rehabilitating and upgrading pump schemes higher than those for \ngravity-supplied schemes. This is commensurate with the greater investment cost. ", "Appendix 7  37 \n5.  The subproject with sanctioned supplemental inflows to the irrigation distribution system \nfrom  the  drains  must  be  projected  to  exhibit  a  neutral  or  better  salt  balance  following  its \nrehabilitation and upgrading. \n \n6.  The  subproject  must  exhibit  scope  for  improved  overall  irrigation  efficiency  and \nincreased agricultural productivity. \n \n2.  Agricultural \n7.  The subproject must have bonitet values (classification system for land productivity \npotential) for its entire command area with an average value above 50, and none of the sub-\nareas within the command area will have a value less than 40. \n \n8.  The subproject must have a command area that exhibits characteristics conducive to \ndiversification to higher-value crops. \n \n3.  Environmental and Social \n9.  The subproject must not have a significant negative impact on or cause irreconcilable \nconflict with established land or water users. \n \n10.  The subproject must not have any negative environmental impact for which affordable \nmitigation treatment cannot be incorporated into the subproject design. \n \n11.  The subproject must not result in a category A environmental or resettlement category.  \n \n4.  Financial and Economic  \n12.  The subproject must have an EIRR of 12% or more. \n \n13.  The subproject must have projected incremental increase in farm income exceeding the \nprojected incremental increase in annual production cost such as, but not limited to, agricultural \ninputs, and irrigation operation and maintenance.  \n \n5.  Specific Technical Criteria for Pump Irrigation Schemes \n14.  The subproject must have adequate water available at the pumping plant to meet the \nsubproject\u2019s irrigation water requirements (with the exception of acceptable crop-water deficits) \nat least 4 out of 5 years. \n \n15.  The subproject receiving supplemental freshwater inflow from gravity canals will be \ngiven preference, provided that the monthly volumes of water transferred and an assessment of \nthe reliability of the supply are available. \n \n16.  The subproject that requires rehabilitation and upgrading of the pumping plants must \nhave a total installed capacity of 15 cubic meters per second (m3/sec) or less. \n \n17.  The subproject must have its pumping plant discharges (per pumping unit or in total) \nless than 80% of the design capacity. \n \n18.  The subproject must have (static plus dynamic) pumping heads of less than 75 meters.  \n ", "38  Appendix 7 \n \n \nD.  Indicative Investment Program \n \n19.  The  project  investment  approach  endorsed  by  the  Government  and  ADB  is  that \napproximately 75% of the investment is to take place in the Fergana Valley and 25% in the \nZarafshan river basin. It is anticipated that this will result in one additional subproject being \nimplemented in the Zarafshan river basin and all additional subprojects (about 3\u20135) being \nimplemented in the Fergana Valley. The Government has provided an initial list of priority \nirrigation systems as candidate subprojects to be taken up through the Project. Initial screening \nof these projects will be undertaken as soon as the PMO is established and implementation \nconsultants  fielded.  Additional  schemes  for  possible  inclusion  are  being  identified  by  the \nGovernment, and it is anticipated that more than an adequate number of irrigation schemes \nexhibiting a critical need for rehabilitation and upgrading will meet the criteria. \n \n20.  The initial list of priority irrigation systems identified by the Government is as follows: \n \n(i)  Rehabilitation of the \u201cKenimex-1\u201d pumping station   Zarafshan river basin \n(ii)  Rehabilitation of the \u201cKasaba\u201d pumping station  Zarafshan river basin \n(iii)  Rehabilitation of the \u201cGaloba-1\u201d pumping station  Fergana Valley \n(iv)  Rehabilitation of the \u201cBulokboshi\u201d pumping station  Fergana Valley \n(v)  Rehabilitation of the \u201cAbdusamat-1\u201d pumping station  Fergana Valley \n \n \n \n ", " \n \nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE\nTASKS 1st Year 2nd Year 3rd Year 4th Year 5th Year 6th Year\nI II III IV I II III IV I II III IV I II III IV I II III IV I II III IV\nI.

Approach and Methodology \n \n1.  Financial and economic analyses were prepared for the two core subprojects (Narpay \nand Besharyk) and an indicative economic analysis was prepared for the overall sector project. \nThe main economic benefit of the Project is sustained and increased agriculture production and \nproductivity. This is mainly achieved through the avoidance of a reduction in the area irrigated \nby the subprojects, either through failure of pump station, irrigation and drainage infrastructure, \nor waterlogging and salinization, and the resultant loss of agricultural production. The with-\nproject  situation  also  assumes  savings  in  energy  through  the  installation  of  more  efficient \nelectric motors and pumps, and increased water efficiency through better water management. A \nmodest increase in yield and cropping intensity is also applied. A full description of the financial \nand economic analyses of the Project is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nB.  Key Assumptions \n \n2.  Mid-2008 prices were used in the analysis. For traded commodities (cotton, wheat, \nmaize, and fertilizer), economic prices were prepared based on border parity using the World \nBank\u2019s commodity price forecasts. For cotton and wheat, given the current peak in prices, the \naverage of forecast prices for 2010, 2015, and 2020 has been used. This is more realistic of the \nlong-run average price, and discounts the effect of the current abnormally high price from the \neconomic analysis.1 Prices of non-traded goods and services (including fodder, vegetables, \nfruit, and agricultural inputs) are in mid-2008 prices based on prices in the subproject areas \ncollected during the feasibility study preparation. Agricultural labor is given a shadow value of \n0.85 in recognition of the high rates of unemployment and underemployment in Uzbekistan. The \neconomic cost of electricity is assumed to be $0.05 per kWh (SUM66 per kWh). The current \nfinancial price of electricity is SUM52.5/kWh For the derivation of the economic costs of capital \ninvestment  in  rehabilitation  works  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  a  standard \nconversion  factor  of  0.85  was  applied  to  reflect  the  removal  of  taxes  and  duties  and \ninefficiencies in the economy. No charge is included for water, as it is currently provided free \nand farmers are not required to contribute to water costs, except for a very low nominal charge \nto  water  users\u2019  associations  (WUAs).2  Maintenance  of  on-farm  irrigation  infrastructure  is \ncovered by the WUA charge per hectare (ha), which is assumed to increase by 4 times in the \nfuture. \n \nC.  Project Benefits \n \n3.  The project benefits will emanate from the three main interventions: (i) the rehabilitation \nand upgrading (R&U) of pump stations to serve their command areas properly; (ii) R&U of the \ninter-farm irrigation system and associated rehabilitation of drainage; and (iii) improved water \n                                                 \n1   Cotton prices are at a 10-year historical high in current prices, with prices in the first 4 months of 2008 over 30% \nhigher than the 2007 average, although they have weakened slightly. The World Bank price commodity predictions \nof May 2008 show cotton prices in real or constant prices over a 2000 base year to be at a high of $1.32 per \nkilogram (kg) for 2008, having increased from $1.20 in 2007, but they are projected to decline to the long run price \nof $1.01 per kg by 2020. International wheat stocks are close to the lowest level relative to consumption since the \n1960s. A combination of factors (drought, increased demand on cropland to produce biofuel feedstock) have \ncontributed to wheat prices more than doubling from 2007 rates by early 2008. The World Bank commodity price \nprojections predicted a price of $306 per ton of wheat in 2008 (in constant 2000 prices), to decline progressively to \n$179.9 per ton by 2020. In constant price terms, this is still above the historical prices during the 1980s and 1990s. \n2  Some WUAs charge SUM0.23/m3 for water, which is equivalent to SUM4,600 per ha for a typical consumption of \n20 km3 per ha, or $3.49. This may be included in the WUA fee. \n ", "48  Appendix 10 \n \nmanagement from the support to the basin irrigation system administrations (BISAs) and WUAs. \nThe Project does not include support for the physical development of the on-farm irrigation \nsystem, except that provision is made for rehabilitation of the inter-farm and on-farm drainage \nthrough sediment removal. However, the benefit from the support to the BISAs and WUAs \nprovided by the Project will have a direct impact on water management, irrigation efficiency, and \nfarm  productivity.  Enhanced  on-farm  water  management  is  expected  to  result  from  the \nrehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure as well as better irrigation scheduling and on-farm water \nmanagement.  \n \n4.  Future Without Project. In the without-project situation, it is assumed that the existing \npump stations and their irrigation and drainage systems will continue to deteriorate with a \ndecline in the volume of water delivered to the command area, especially during the peak \ndemand period from June to September. (The two core subprojects are both pump irrigation \nschemes, and the majority of the other subprojects is likely to be pump schemes.) The Ministry \nof Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) staff indicated the remaining life of the pumps for \nthe Narpay and Besharyk schemes is no more than 5 years. A reduced water supply will lead to \na reduced area planted and declining agricultural productivity, with reduced yields and less \nintensive cropping. As irrigation becomes more unreliable because of more frequent pump \nbreakdown, famers will lose confidence in the system, reduce their investment in agricultural \ninputs, pay less attention to good cropping practices, and eventually abandon their land.  \n \n5.  Future With Project. For pump irrigation schemes, the impact of the Project will be to \nrestore the pumps to a capacity to satisfy water demand in the command area fully and to \nimprove energy efficiency (around 20%). Some savings in the O&M costs of the pumps and \nmotors will also occur in the initial years, as the new equipment will not require the same level of \nO&M as is the case now. However, adequate levels of O&M must be provided to ensure that the \nequipment is kept fully functional throughout its design life, and to avoid the situation of deferred \nmaintenance. Agricultural productivity will be restored to the full command area, combined with \nan increase in yields and a modest increase in cropping intensity because of the gains in water \nuse efficiency brought about by the support to water management and the WUAs. The R&U of \nthe irrigation infrastructure will reduce water losses and allow better water management.  \n \n6.  For  gravity  irrigation  schemes,  the  gains  will  be  from  more  effective  irrigation  and \ndrainage infrastructure and the associated support to water management and WUAs, as is the \ncase with the pump schemes. \n \nD.  Financial Analysis \n \n7.  Crop Models. Crop budgets for the range of crops found in the Narpay and Besharyk \nsubprojects were prepared\u2014including cotton, wheat, maize silage and/or fodder, vegetables, \nannual forage, and fruit trees representing the current situation; and with the inclusion of some \nmelons and potato for the with-project situation. The predominant crop is cotton, which is grown \non around 50% of the area, followed by wheat at around 30%. Maize, lucerne, vegetables, and \nfruit are produced from the remaining area to give a current average cropping intensity of \naround 100% for the irrigated land. Private farms are compelled to produce a quota of cotton \nand wheat under the state order system, while dekhan (small inheritable household plot [0.15\u2013\n0.35 hectares] free from Government quotas for crop selection and marketing) farms are free to \nchoose  what  they  grow.  In  the with-project  situation,  the  cropping  pattern  for  Narpay  and \nBesharyk is not expected to change markedly except for a small increase in the area of lucerne, \nin recognition of its benefit as a restorative crop in the cotton\u2013wheat rotation, and increased \nproduction  of  high  value  crops\u2014vegetables,  potatoes,  and  melons.  The  average  cropping \n ", "  Appendix 10  49        \n \n \nintensity is expected to increase to about 115% with an increase in the second crop of maize \nand fodder grown after the winter wheat is harvested. This situation is expected to apply to all \nfuture subprojects. \n \n8.  Farm Budget Analysis. The objective of the financial analysis of a typical farm is to \nshow the effect of the Project on the farm household\u2019s net income and returns to labor as an \nindication of financial viability, and to indicate the famer\u2019s incentives to participate in the Project. \nIn this respect, the farm budget financial analysis is not as meaningful as for more typical \nirrigation R&U since the collapse of the pump stations will lead to a major reduction of the \nirrigated area, resulting in a drastic reduction in farm income per farm, and inevitably the \nfinancial ruin of many farmers. Moreover, the farmers are not currently required to make any \ncontribution to the Project, and as a result of the R&U, they will receive the benefits with no \ncosts. Currently, farmers are not required to contribute to the pumping costs of water or to repay \nany of the investment costs except through the WUA fee.  \n \n9.  An analysis of a typical farm budget for the Narpay subproject, based on an average \nfarm of 30 ha, has been undertaken to indicate the impact of the Project. Private farms do not \nhave much variation in their cropping patterns as they are required by Government to grow a \ncertain proportion cotton and wheat on their land, typically around 50% cotton and 30% wheat. \nThe model is indicative of the overall Project. Currently, it is estimated that an average size farm \nof 30 ha generates an annual net income of around SUM8 million ($6,060), or around $200 per \nha. In the future without-project situation, this would deteriorate to a net return of only $54 per \nha across the command area. In the with-project situation, the average farm would generate a \nnet  income  of  SUM12.3  million  ($9,300),  a  50%  increase  from  the  current  situation.  The \nincremental income per ha per year as a result of the Project (i.e., average returns per ha \nbetween the with- and without-project situations) is estimated at SUM338,000 per ha ($256.02). \nFor the average-sized farm of 30 ha, this represents an increase of over SUM10.00 million, or \n$7,685 per farm\u2014a 127% increase in net farm income.  \n \n10.  Affordability of O&M. An important element of the financial analysis is the Government \naffordability  in  terms  of  meeting  O&M  costs  of  the  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure. \nAlthough  the  Government  has  the  right  to  levy  water  charges  as  a  means  of  generating \nrevenue, the only charge currently applied is an all-inclusive land tax that covers land and \nincludes a nominal charge for water use. This tax is related to the bonitet (classification system \nfor land productivity potential) land productivity value, and currently ranges from SUM500 to \nSUM70,00 depending on the bonitet value with an average of about SUM55,000 per ha ($40). \nThe land tax has more than doubled in recent years. In 2008, the tax revenue may be as much \nas $250 million. It is not clear how the Ministry of Finance utilizes this revenue, however. In \n2005, the World Bank estimated that MAWR requires about $550 million per year to meet O&M \nrequirements, so even if all the land tax revenue was allocated for MAWR\u2019s O&M needs, there \nwould still be a significant shortfall. For the immediate future, the bulk of funding for O&M and \ncapital investment will be from the state budget, as determined by the requests from the BISAs \nand their subdivisions to MAWR. \n \n11.  In recent years, budgetary allocations for irrigation and drainage O&M have fallen short \nof  the  requirements  to  operate,  maintain,  and  develop  irrigation  and  drainage  systems \nsustainably. For the last 3 years, the state budget allocations to MAWR for irrigation and \ndrainage were equivalent to $310 million (2006), $350 million (2007), and $423 million (2008)\u2014\na shortfall of about 30%\u201345% of the estimated O&M needs. About 70% of MAWR\u2019s O&M \nbudget  is  accounted  for  by  electricity  costs  for  pumping,  with  the  allocated  portion  for \nmaintenance  at  around  23%  of  the  budget.  This  large  state  subsidy  to  the  irrigation  and \n ", "50  Appendix 10 \n \ndrainage  sector  can  be  recognized  as  compensation  for  the  indirect  taxes  applied  to  the \nagricultural producers through the Government\u2019s price and marketing policy for cotton and \nwheat. Although the system works, it is inefficient, distorting the efficient allocation of resources, \nand constraining economic incentives in irrigation production. \n \n12.  The Government needs to find a more sustainable mechanism for funding O&M and \ncapital investment. One means to increase direct revenue to pay for inter-farm O&M that has \nbeen suggested would be for the BISA subdivisions\u2014the main canal administrations (MCAs) \nand the irrigation system administrations (ISAs)\u2014to levy service charges on the WUAs for water \ndelivery,  which  in  turn  would  recoup  the  costs  from  their  members.  Reorganization  and \nestablishment of service fees will require a concerted approach to overcoming constraints at all \nlevels of the system and the agricultural economy, in combination with capacity building and \ntraining. The Government is currently considering imposing water fees to help address required \nO&M resources. \n \nE.  Economic Analysis \n \n13.  The  main  project  benefit  is  sustained  and  increased  agriculture  production  and \nproductivity, which would not happen in the absence of the subproject R&U. Other benefits \ninclude a modest increase in crop yield of 5%, efficiency gain of 20% in the operation of the \npumps, and a gain of 10% in the efficiency of water use, which results in a lower volume of \nwater having to be pumped to satisfy crop water requirements. The most important benefits are \nthose generated by the Project through the prevention of the reduction in irrigation through \npump failure, and to a lesser extent the saving in electricity consumption through more efficient \npumps and the improvement in water use efficiency through support for water management and \ntraining WUAs. For the Narpay subproject, the volume of water saved through improved water \nuse efficiency is assumed to become available for irrigation elsewhere at an average economic \nreturn of SUM300,000 per ha ($226), while for Besharyk the additional water is assumed to \nallow an expansion of the irrigated area surrounding the scheme. \n \n1.  Results of the Economic Assessment and Sensitivity Analysis \n14.  Narpay. The subproject is found to be economically viable; the economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) is 15.4%. At a 12% discount rate, the net present value is SUM3,040 million \n($2.3 million)  and  the  benefit\u2013cost  ratio  is  1.14.  The  EIRR  calculation  was  subjected  to \nsensitivity analysis to test the effects of negative changes in the key parameters that determine \nthe benefits and costs. The sensitivity analysis found that the subproject remains economically \nviable in the face of a 20% increase in costs but the EIRR would fall below 12% with a 20% \ndecrease in net benefits. The switching value for the subproject for increased R&U costs was \ndetermined to be 21.5%, and the switching value for decreased benefits was determined to be \u2013\n12.5%. The subproject is not sensitive to the economic price of electricity, with a switching value \nof  37%  indicating  that  the  price  of  electricity  could  increase  from  $0.05/kWh  to  almost \n$0.07/kWh. The EIRR is not significantly affected by either a reduction in the irrigated area to \nzero in the without-project situation after 10 years or a 20% increase in the net irrigated area in \nthe future without-project situation. Overall, the subproject is most sensitive to a reduction in the \neconomic price of wheat and cotton. \n15.  Besharyk. The subproject is found to be economically viable; the EIRR is 13.4%. At a \n12% discount rate, the net present value is SUM2,168 million ($1.5 million) and the benefit\u2013cost \nratio is 1.06. The sensitivity analysis found that the Besharyk subproject is sensitive to changes \nin the main parameters. In the face of a 20% increase in costs, the EIRR would fall below 12%. \n ", "  Appendix 10  51        \n \n \nWith a 20% increase in O&M costs, the EIRR reduces to 12%. The switching value for R&U \ncosts  was  determined  to  be  a  10%  increase  in  R&U  costs.  The  switching  value  for  the \ndecreased price of wheat and cotton was determined to be a decrease of 4.5%. The analysis is \nnot sensitive to the economic price of electricity, with a switching value of 27.5% indicating that \nthe price of electricity could increase from $0.05/kWh to $0.064/kWh. Similarly, a reduction in \nthe irrigated area in the three zones to zero from the current situation in the without-project \nsituation after 10 years did not affect the EIRR significantly.  \n16.  Overall Project Economic Analysis. An indicative economic analysis for the overall \nProject has been prepared using the Narpay and Besharyk subprojects as examples of the \nlikely costs and benefits for the three components: R&U of irrigation drainage, water resources \nmanagement, and project management. The EIRR is 15.5% which indicates that the overall \nProject is economically viable as it exceeds the opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The results of \na sensitivity analysis show that the Project is robust to a 20% increase in capital costs and O&M \ncosts, and is most sensitive to the level of benefits. A combination of a 20% increase in costs \nand a 20% reduction in net benefits reduces the EIRR to 6.1%. The estimates of the benefits \nmade  possible  by  the  Project  are  considered  to  be  conservative  because  the  economic \nevaluation  not  does  consider  that  the  pump  stations  will  stop  operating  completely  in  the \nwithout-project situation. They are assumed to continue to operate at about one third of their \ncurrent capacity, supplying water for a much reduced area but continuing to provide water for \ndomestic use, to maintain livestock and water household gardens, which are vital to the rural \neconomy. Even with this situation, there is likely to be major social dislocation in the project area \nbecause of the reduction in the irrigated area and loss of employment in agriculture, which \nwould require some families to relocate to other areas, with the assistance of government. \nThese costs have not been quantified in the analysis. \n \n2.  Benefit Distribution and Poverty Analysis \n \n17.  The population in the project area has a high dependency on agriculture for employment \nand sustenance, with little alternative employment. There would be a sharp increase in poverty \nif agriculture production were to decline through failure of the pump schemes. For most poor \nhouseholds,  production  from  dekhan  farms  and  households  and  livestock  is  important  for \nsubsistence,  which  would  be  seriously  affected  if  water  supplies  were  to  be  limited.  Poor \nhouseholds  would  benefit  from  the  increased  agricultural  productivity  resulting  from \nrehabilitation,  and  the  attention  given  to  improved  water  management.  For  the  Narpay \nsubproject, it is estimated that the Project would generate an additional 142,000 person-days \n(600 person-years) of employment as a result of the Project (mostly for harvesting activities), \nand avoid the without-project loss of a similar number of person-days. Using the Narpay labor \ninvolvement of an additional 16 person-days per ha as a gauge for the whole project, the overall \nProject  is  estimated  to  generate  over  2,500  additional  person-years  of  employment  after \nrehabilitation. Most of the additional employment is expected to accrue to rural agriculture \nworkers and poor households. Therefore, the Project\u2019s impact is likely to be pro-poor.  \n \n ", "52  Appendix 11 \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: Uzbekistan: Water Resources Management Sector Project \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  Central and West Asia Department \nSector Loan  \nModality:  Division:  Agriculture, Environment and Natural Resources Division  \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Water Resources Management Sector Project will provide funding for the rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage \nschemes in the Fergana Valley and the Zarafshan River Basin. Six to eight schemes will be rehabilitated under the \nProject. Two subprojects, Narpay in the Zarafshan River Basin and Besharyk in the Fergana Valley, have been \nidentified and full feasibility studies completed under the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA).a The \nremaining  subprojects  are  to  be  identified  and  analyzed  during  project  implementation.  The  total  area  to  be \nrehabilitated by the Project will be about 60,000 ha and the Project will be implemented over 6 years (2009\u20132015). The \nProject has three components: (i) rehabilitation and upgrading of irrigation and drainage infrastructure, (ii) improved \nwater resources management, and (iii) project management.  \n \nThe Government of Uzbekistan\u2019s Welfare Improvement Strategy 2008\u20132010 commits to pursuing the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals relevant to the country. It identifies four pillars for reducing poverty in Uzbekistan: (i) high growth \nrates by maintaining macroeconomic stability and accelerating structural reforms, (ii) human development and social \nprotection, (iii) reduced interregional inequalities in living standards, and (iv) improved environmental protection. The \nstrategy emphasizes that further reforms in agriculture and implementation of an agricultural development program are \nthe long-term strategic priorities since they will lead to improvement in incomes for a significant part of the population \nwho live in rural areas and have low-income employment.b   \nUnder  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  2006\u20132010  in  Uzbekistan,  strategic  priority  1  is  accelerated \nenvironmentally  sustainable  rural  development  with  the  following  long-term  country  outcomes:  (i)  agricultural \nproductivity and farm profitability improved in a sustainable manner, (ii) rural non-farm employment productivity \nincreased, and (iii) access to and efficiency of rural infrastructure increased. The Project is included under strategic \npriority 1 of the country strategy and program.c  \nIn 2007, 25.8% of the people in Uzbekistan were living below the poverty line with one third of the poor or 2.3 million \npeople classified extremely poor. About 70% of the poor live in rural areas. In 2001, the poverty rate in rural areas was \n30.5%, compared to 22.5% in urban areas. It declined in 2002 to 27.8%, but rose slightly in 2003 to 29%. The overall \npoverty rate dropped to 26.1% in 2004, and 25.8% in 2007.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:   Geographic \n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nUzbekistan recorded per capita GDP of $814 in 2007. GDP growth rates increased from 3.8% to 4.4% between 2000 \nand 2003, to an annual average of over 7% during 2004\u20132006 (footnote b) and 9.5% in 2007.d The impressive \neconomic growth over the last 5 years has significantly contributed to poverty reduction in Uzbekistan. From 27.5% in \n2001, the poverty incidence fell to 25.8% in 2005. Agriculture growth fluctuated from 3.2% in 2000, to 10.1% in 2004 to \n6.1% in 2007. Agriculture provides one third of national employment. About 64% of the population lives in rural areas \nwhere livelihoods largely depend on this sector. All of the country\u2019s shirkat (collective farm) farms have been parceled \nout and leased on a long-term basis to private farmers, many of whom have limited agricultural experience. This \nintroduced a fundamental production change from large collectively managed landholdings to much smaller plots. \nThese reforms have made significant progress in the agricultural sector but help is needed to improve the tenure status \nof farmers, thus spurring investment. Improving water management and increasing the efficiency and productivity of \nwater use are national objectives of Uzbekistan. \n \nThe low living standard of the population in the project area is directly linked to the low level of participation in domestic \nagricultural production and low incomes. The Project is of utmost importance to address the continuously deteriorating \nwater supply in the project area, which is the main reason for the decreasing productivity of land and diminishing \nincomes of households. The Project will have the most significant positive impact on private farms, but owners of \ndekhan (small inheritable household plot [0.15\u20130.35 hectares] free from Government quotas for crop selection and \n ", "  Appendix 11  53        \n \n \nmarketing) farms and garden plots will also benefit from the improved supply and management of irrigation water under \nthe Project, which will prevent further loss of irrigated farmland, allow potential increases in yields and cropping \nintensity, and lead to increased employment and increased farm and nonfarm incomes.  \nMost of the surveyed households (both poor and nonpoor) are concentrated near the poverty line. The Project will have \na positive effect on the productivity of farm households, both poor and nonpoor, because of the more reliable supply of \nwater and improved water management, both inter-farm and on-farm, particularly through improved WUAs. While \nfarmers will still primarily grow wheat and cotton, there will be opportunities for other second crops to be grown, thus \nincreasing overall cropping intensity. In addition, some households may increase productivity on household plots and \nimprove in-kind consumption and increase opportunities for increased marketing of agricultural products, including fruit, \ngrapes, and vegetables. While there is currently limited marketing of crops other than wheat and cotton, there is scope \nfor increased marketing of other crops over and above domestic household consumption needs. This applies to both \npoor and nonpoor households. There is also scope for some increased employment for nonfarm households as the \nirrigation areas are restored to full utilization.  \nAdditionally, potable water supply in many areas depends substantially on irrigation water, as many households use \nwater from the irrigation canals for drinking and household needs. However, if the Project is not implemented, access \nof the population to water for domestic needs, even though not potable, will become even more limited. Currently, \nsubstantial drainage water is pumped back into canals for further irrigation use. The Project will allow stabilizing water \ndelivery to households; and provide continuous supply for household needs, even at the current relatively low level. To \nthe extent that pumping of drainage water back into the irrigation canals can be reduced, the quality of the water will \nnot continue to deteriorate. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nA socioeconomic survey was undertaken in both the Narpay and Besharyk subproject areas under the PPTA. The \npopulation in the settlements within the Narpay subproject in Narpay district, Samarkand Province is 13,663 persons or \n2,973 families. In the Besharyk subproject, located in Fergana province, the population is 32,333 persons or 8,673 \nfamilies. The average household size for the surveyed households is 5.32 people in Narpay and 6.0 people in \nBesharyk. \nAccording to the World Bank study,e based on the household budget survey data in the Northern Economic Region, \nwhich includes Samarkand Province, 28.3% of the population was living below the poverty line; in Fergana Province, \nthe figure was 31.8%. In 2005, based on the household budget survey conducted by the State Committee on Statistics \nof the Republic of Uzbekistan, the World Bank identified that the poverty rate was 23.9% in Samarkand Province and \n15.8% in Fergana. At the same time, the average poverty rate for the whole country was 25.8% (footnote b). \nThe socioeconomic survey showed a household poverty rate of 30.5% in Narpay subproject area and 19.5% in the \nBesharyk subproject area, equivalent to a total of 46,000 people in the two subproject areas. The poverty line in \nmonetary terms is $26.7 per month in the Narpay subproject district and $25.0 per month in the Besharyk subproject \ndistrict. The average monthly household income is $126 for Narpay and $254 in Besharyk. Average family per capita \nincome of the poor is nearly 2 times lower than the income of the nonpoor. \nIncome from hired employment in the nonagricultural sector is the most significant for poor families. The second most \nimportant income sources are social transfers and marketing of own agricultural products. The contribution of pensions \nand social transfers to total income among poor families (including social benefits for low-income households) is 21% in \nNarpay district and 16.3% in Besharyk district.   \nThe share of the unemployed is higher in poor families (37% more in poor families) and more than 67% of the \nunemployed are women. Most of the poor are hired workers, employed in the agricultural or state-budget-funded \nsectors, or self-employed people who cultivate their own small household plots (up to 0.1 ha). \n \nThe general level of education of the population in the project area is high (similar to the country in general), but the \nshare of adults in the employable age and above, who have vocational education (particularly higher education) is \ncomparatively small, which is typical for rural areas. Education indicators are a little lower in poor families than in \nnonpoor families.  \nMore than 2.5% of the population has become private farmers, and primarily employs only family members as private \nfarm workers. Self-employment opportunities are limited because of the shortage of resources, underdeveloped market \ninstitutions, legislative limitations, and lack of information about ways and opportunities of increasing income in new \nmarket-oriented conditions.  \n \n ", "54  Appendix 11 \n \nBoth poor and nonpoor families have limited access to public utilities\u2014natural gas, electricity, and potable water. \nElectricity supply is relatively good, compared to other rural areas of the country: 98% of households in Narpay and \n73% in Besharyk have electricity, and power cuts are rare. Populated localities covered by the survey do not have \ncentralized hot water and heat supply systems. Poor gas supply, with frequent interruptions and low pressure, is a \nserious problem for Narpay\u2019s population; 20% of households do not have access to a centralized gas supply, and \nanother 23% receive natural gas irregularly. \nPotable water supply is a particularly serious problem for the project areas. Only 3.2% of surveyed households in \nNarpay and 6.5% in Besharyk have water piped into the house or in the courtyard. The situation in Besharyk is better \nthan in Narpay, where water is available for only 1\u20132 hours 3 times a week, and the quality of water is unsatisfactory. \nOpen reservoirs (mainly the Narpay machine canal) represent the main source of potable water\u2014about 75% of survey \nrespondents use this water, at least from time to time. Thirty-two percent of the population get water from water \nvendors, 13% use a public water pipeline, and 7.5% use water delivered from a water pumping station. Generally, \npeople in the project areas drink and cook with water that falls short of current sanitary standards. Children, who drink \nwater from various sources without any treatment, are particularly vulnerable. \nPoor living standards of households within the subproject areas are also due to low productivity in household plots and \nlow incomes from agriculture. The average per capita income of poor households is 1.4 times less than the nonpoor \nhouseholds and 1.3 times lower than that of the average households. The same rates were observed in terms of \nexpenses. It was also observed that monthly household expenditures are more than the monthly incomes. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \nThe consultation and participation process during project preparation included key stakeholders: MAWR, district \nagricultural staff, WUA staff, pump operators, private farmers, dekhan farmers, and members of the community who \nlive and work within the subproject areas. During implementation and monitoring, consultation and participation will \ninclude information sharing and stakeholder consultation, especially through the developed water WUAs.  \nA participation plan was not prepared as there are no significant social safeguard issues.  \nJoint project disclosure and public consultations were carried out in Narpay and Besharyk districts. A total of \n98 stakeholders attended the public consultations\u201445 in Narpay and 53 in Besharyk\u2014where women were also \nrepresented. In both consultations, the participants were given a project information booklet that defines the Project \nand its likely impacts. Following the presentation, the participants were given the opportunity to provide comments and \nquestions, which were answered and clarified by the PPTA consultants. The participants did not raise any opposition \nagainst  the  subproject  implementation  in  their  districts.  The  proceedings  were  summarized  in  the  minutes  of \nconsultations, with supporting photographs of the proceedings.  \nIn  addition,  the  socioeconomic  survey  allowed  a  better  understanding  of  the  preferences  of  residents  of  rural \nsettlements, but also informed them about the project objectives and scope. In addition to surveying, interviews were \nconducted with the chairpersons of all the rural assemblies of citizens and urban villages located within the subproject \nareas. \n \n2.

Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n \n1.  Key  issues \n \nMore than 26 million people live in Uzbekistan, 50% of which are women, and 64% of the population lives in rural \nareas. The income of women in the Narpay subproject area reflects gender inequalities indicated by the following: (i) \nthe economic activity of women is low, with 44% of women in employable age but only about 30% employed; (ii) 54% \nof  working  women are employed in the nonagricultural  sector, mainly in healthcare and education; (iii) in the \nnonagricultural sector, women occupy lower-paid positions; (iv) the share of entrepreneurs among women is almost 3 \ntimes smaller than that of men; (v) women are paid 50%\u201380% of male wages; (vi) women have less access to rural \nfinancial services; and (vii) women are generally overburdened with domestic work and household responsibilities. \nExisting gender stereotypes set household duties as a priority for women, which do not let them achieve full and \neffective employment. Women\u2019s duties include cooking, laundering, house cleaning, taking care of children and elderly \nfamily members, working on the garden plot, looking after livestock and poultry, and delivering water for drinking and \n ", "  Appendix 11  55        \n \n \ndomestic needs. When access to municipal services (gas, fuel, potable water) is limited, domestic work takes up most \nof women\u2019s time and energy. According to survey results, women and children are responsible for fetching water in \n76% of households. \n2.

This summary presents the highlights of the land acquisition and resettlement framework \n(LARF) prepared for the Water Resources Management Sector Project in Uzbekistan. The \nLARF outlines the objectives, policy principles, land acquisition and processing requirements, \ncompensation, and other assistance measures for affected persons. The LARF will serve as \nguide to prepare any required land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) for subprojects \nunder the Project. The document is based on national laws, the country\u2019s 1998 Land Code and \nrelated resolutions of cabinet ministers as well as the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) \nand related policies of Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nB.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Processing Requirements \n \n2.  Consistent with ADB\u2019s guidelines, all proposed subprojects will be screened based on \nthe following categories of impacts: (i) a full LARP is required under category A subproject if \n200 or more people will be physically displaced from housing or lose 10% or more of their \nproductive (income-generating) assets; (ii) a short LARP will be prepared for category B if fewer \nthan 200 people will be physically displaced from housing or lose less than 10% of their \nproductive (income-generating) assets; and (iii) no LARP is required for category C if the \nsubproject  does  not  require  temporary  or  permanent  land  acquisition  and/or  there  are  no \nresettlement impacts. However, a due diligence report will be prepared to indicate why the \ncomponent has been categorized as C.1 Procedures for the preparation of the LARP are \nprescribed in the LARF. However, in accordance with selection criteria for the Project and \nconsistent with the practice of the State Committee on Land Resources, Geodesy, Cartography \nand State Cadastre (SCLRGCSC), only category B and category C subprojects will be funded \nunder the Project.  \n \nC.  Resettlement Framework and Policy \n \n3.  The  relevant  laws  in  Uzbekistan  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \nrequirements were compared to assess their consistency. To fill their gaps and satisfy ADB\u2019s \npolicy requirements, the following core involuntary resettlement principles were adopted for the \nProject: (i) temporary and permanent acquisition of lands will be minimized to avoid significant \nlosses on farm revenues; (ii) where displacement cannot be avoided, the affected persons will \nbe provided assistance to at least maintain or improve their pre-subproject living standards, \nincome earning capacity, and production levels; (iii) stakeholders in the subproject locality will \nbe  systematically  informed  and  properly  consulted  (a)  to  identify  the  possible  alternative \nsubproject designs to avoid or minimize the adverse impacts of land acquisition; (b) to disclose \nthose  who  are  eligible  to  receive  compensation,  entitlements,  and  the  special  assistance \nmeasures; and (c) for the preparation and disclosures of LARPs to affected persons and others; \n(iv) all affected persons will be properly identified, recorded, and disaggregated by gender in a \ncensus instrument in which the cut-off date for their eligibility is the last day of the survey in the \nsubproject area, and they will be notified in advance when the land for subprojects will be \nacquired; (v) lack of certificate of land use right and/or certificate of permanent ownership of \nland should not deprive the affected persons from receiving compensation, entitlement, and \nrehabilitation measures; (vi) special assistance measures will be incorporated in the LARP \n                                                 \n1  The Executing Agency has prepared two diligence reports that were included in the final report of the project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA) consultants for the ADB. 2008.

Based on the preceding principles, the compensation and entitlements of affected \npersons are summarized in the entitlement matrix in Table A12.1. \n \n4.  All permanently affected lands of the farmers shall be provided with replacement lands. \nOther  affected  properties  will  be  compensated  based  on  replacement  cost.  Eligibility  for \ncompensation will be limited by a cut-off date to be established for each subproject on the \nstarting day of the census and impact assessment. The affected persons who have established \ntheir  structures  within  the  subproject  sites  after  the  cut-off  date  are  not  eligible  for \ncompensation. However, they will be given sufficient advance notice to dismantle the structures \nand vacate the affected premises prior to project implementation. Their dismantled structures \nwill not be confiscated, and they will not pay any fine or sanction. Forced eviction will only be \nused after all avenues for amicable resolution to vacate the subproject premises have been \nexhausted. Women and vulnerable groups will be given particular attention for assistance in the \npreparation and implementation of LARPs. \n \nD.  Public Participation, Documents Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n \n5.  The  Project  is  designed  for  stakeholders\u2019  participation  during  LARP  preparation. \nProvince, district, and village officials will be informed and their assistance will be solicited for \nthe conduct of the inventory of affected assets and the census of affected persons. Prior to the \nfinalization of the LARP, it will be translated into the Uzbek language so that affected persons \nwill  be  thoroughly  informed  and  validate  their  preferences  for  compensation  and/or  other \nresettlement  assistance,  including  their  opinions  on  compensation  rates.  The  meeting  with \naffected persons will be recorded in the minutes of the consultation. The LARF and the LARPs \nwill be translated into the Uzbek language for disclosure to affected persons, and copies will \nalso be made available at the concerned districts and villages. The English versions of the \nLARF and LARPs will be endorsed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) \nto ADB for posting on the ADB website.  \n \n6.  Grievances  or  complaints  from  affected  persons  will  be  solved  in  a  timely  and \nsatisfactory  manner.  The  project  management  office  (PMO)  for  the  Project  will  mobilize \ngrievance and redress committees (GRCs) whose members will comprise PMO representatives, \nprivate  farmers,  and  owners  of  dekhan  farms  (small  inheritable  household  plot  [0.15\u20130.35 \nhectares] free in crop selection and marketing) who are not necessarily affected persons, and \nrepresentatives  from  the  group  of  affected  persons  themselves.  Women  will  be  invited  as \nmembers. Any grievance or complaint will be first brought to the attention of the GRC. The GRC \nwill meet to determine the merit of each grievance, and resolve it within 15 days upon receipt of \nthe complaint. If not satisfied with the GRC decision, the affected person can bring his or her \ncomplaint to the district department of SCLRGCSC, or to its province department, where each \ndepartment is given 15 days to resolve the case. The affected person can file the grievance or \n                                                 \n2  This can include ethnic minorities, indigenous people, households headed by women and/or elderly people, and \npeople living below the poverty line. \n ", "  Appendix 12        59         \n \ncomplaint to the judicial court if he or she is still unsatisfied with the decision of the SCLRGCSC. \nThe term of each GRC will expire upon the satisfactory completion of land acquisitions and \npayment of compensation and entitlement to affected persons. \n \nE.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n7.  MAWR  is  the  Executing  Agency.  It  will  establish  the  PMO,  which  will  oversee \nimplementation of the LARF and LARPs. The PMO will be assisted by a (i) national resettlement \nspecialist to assist in LARP planning, preparation and implementation, internal monitoring and \nevaluation  (M&E);  (ii)  a  nongovernment  organization  to  provide  on-site  LARP  preparation \nassistance for surveys, information gathering, and consultations with affected persons and the \npublic in general; and (iii) an external monitoring agent to conduct periodic M&E and third-party \nvalidation of LARP implementation activities. \n \n8.  The PMO will also solicit the assistance from the government administration of provinces \nand districts and the SCLRGCSC subdivisions at the province and district levels as well as the \nconcerned parties. The concerned parties will be composed of representatives of farmers, \nowners of dekhan farms and the neighboring landowners and users, including the affected \npersons. They will serve as witness to the marking of lands and jointly issue the certificate of \nland  markings  to  PMO.  The  certificate  will  be  included  as  part  of  the  preparation  of  the \ninstruction  on  land  allocation.  Table  A12.2  summarizes  the  phasing  of  the  involvement  of \nconcerned project personnel and institutions in LARP preparation and implementation. All the \nconcerned staff of PMO, MAWR, and the local nongovernment organization involved in LARP \nactivities will undergo an orientation and training on ADB resettlement policy and management. \nThe  orientation  and  training  will  be  conducted  by  the  resettlement  specialist  (technical \nassistance consultant). \n \nF.  Resettlement Budget and Financing \n \n9.  Funds  will  be  provided  for  all  LARPs.  Provisions  will  cover  the  compensation, \nassistance,  other  allowances  to  affected  persons,  implementing  costs,  and  contingency \nallowance  for  unforeseen  expenses  and  for  cushioning  the  effect  of  inflation.  MAWR  will \napprove the budgets and facilitate the release of funds for implementing the LARP. The LARPs \nwill describe the flow of funds including the accounting systems, as these are part of the overall \nproject development expenditures for which ADB, through the external monitoring agent, will \nmonitor the disbursements for LARPs. \n \nG.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n10.  Internal and external monitoring will be conducted during LARP implementation. The \nPMO, assisted by the local NGO and resettlement specialist, will be responsible for internal \nmonitoring. Internal monitoring will cover activities related to (i) information campaigns and \nconsultation  with  affected  persons;  (ii)  status  of  land  acquisition  and  payments  on  land \ncompensation; (iii) compensation for affected structures and other assets; (iv) relocation of \naffected persons; (v) payments for loss of incomes; (vi) selection and distribution of replacement \nland areas; and (vii) income restoration activities. Related information will be collected from the \nfield  and  reported  monthly  to  the  PMO  to  assess  the  progress  and  results  of  LARP \nimplementation, and to adjust the work program, if necessary. The monthly reports will be \nconsolidated every quarter and be a part of quarterly reporting by the PMO to ADB. \n \n11.  External monitoring will be the responsibility of the external monitoring agent that will be \nhired by the PMO at the early stage of LARP implementation. The external monitoring agent will \n ", "60  Appendix 12 \n \nconduct external monitoring in two phases: (i) compliance monitoring, and (ii) social impact \nevaluation. Compliance monitoring will involve the assessment LARP implementation that will \nbe the basis of MAWR to request a \u201cno objection\u201d from ADB for the award of civil works \ncontract. The social impact evaluation will cover the post-resettlement situations of vulnerable \ngroups like households headed by women, disabled and/or elderly, and families living below the \npoverty threshold. The evaluation will also describe the outstanding future issues that are \nrequired to bring resettlement into compliance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, \ngovernment policies, and further mitigation measures needed to meet the needs of affected \npersons or households perceiving themselves to be worse off as the result of resettlement. It will \ninclude lessons from the evaluation that may be useful in developing future MAWR policies on \nland acquisition and resettlement. The PMO and ADB will prepare the terms of reference for the \nexternal  monitoring  agent  that  will  be  chosen  among  local  consultants  or  nongovernment \norganizations, prior to LARP implementation. \n ", "  Appendix 12        61         \n \nTable A12.1: Entitlement Matrix \nType of  Entitled \n  Loss  Application  Persons  Compensation Entitlements \n1.a  Temporary  Private farms,  Owner(s) of  \u2022 Restoration of land to previous condition, or better \nLoss of  dekhan farms  private farm;  \u2022 See item no. 3  \nLand  owner(s) of \ndekhan plot \n1b  Permanent  Private farms,  Owner(s) of  \u2022 Replacement land plus cash allowance for the cost \nLoss of  dekhan farms  private farm;  of clearing and development; free from all taxes, \nLand  owner(s) of  registration and administrative costs \ndekhan plot  \u2022 See item no. 3 \n2  Loss of  Structures in dekhan  Owner(s) of  \u2022 Compensation will be in cash or in kind with no \nStructure  farms or in  private farm;  deduction for depreciation \nagricultural land  owner(s) of  \u2022 Rights to salvage materials from affected structure \ndekhan plots  \u2022 Provision of cash allowance for relocation and \ntransfer assistance that includes the payment for \ndismantling and reconstruction of structure, based \non the condition in the locality  \nStructures  Non-titled  \u2022 Rights to salvage materials from affected structure \nencroaching irrigation  owners of  \u2022 Provision of cash allowance for relocation and \nfacilities  structures  transfer assistance that includes the payment for \ndismantling and reconstruction of structure, based \non the condition in the locality \n\u2022 No compensation for structure \n3  Loss of  Seasonal crops and  Owner(s) of  \u2022 For seasonal crops, compensation will be based on \nCrops  perennial crops  private farm;  the highest market price during the current season \nowner(s) of  calculated on an annual basis \ndekhan plots  \u2022 For perennial crops, compensation will be based on \nthe average prices for the last 12 months, calculated \non an annual basis \n\u2022 Compensation will not be subject to deduction of \nincome tax \n4  Loss of  Trees  Owner(s) of  \u2022 Compensation will be based on the cost of planting \nTrees  private farm,  and fertilization of a new tree, and loss of production \nowner(s) of  during the growth period of a new tree \ndekhan plots,  \u2022 Compensation will not be subject to deduction of \nhouseholds  income tax \n5  Severe  Affected persons  Severely  \u2022 Provision of land to new settlement within the village \nlosses  losing 10% or more  affected  territory, cash support for land and crop development \nof the income- persons  \u2022 Provision of cash allowance for relocation and \ngenerating assets  transfer assistance that includes the payment for \ndismantling and reconstruction of structure, based \non the condition in the locality \n\u2022 Employment of at least one member in the \nconstruction work \n6  Vulnerable  Affected persons  All vulnerable  \u2022 Additional cash or support in kind to help reestablish \nhouseholds   below the poverty   affected   and improve livelihoods  \nline and identified as  households  \nvulnerable through \nthe social impact \nassessment \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n ", "62  Appendix 12 \n \n \nTable A12.2: Institutional Roles in LAR Preparation and Implementation  \nStep  Action  Responsibility \nA.
