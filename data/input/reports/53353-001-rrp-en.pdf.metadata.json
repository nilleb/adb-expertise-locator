The program is included in the country operations business plan for \nthe Philippines, 2020\u20132022 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2 The program is consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and country partnership strategy for the Philippines, 2018\u20132023.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \nPrior  to  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic,  the  Philippines  presented  very \n3. \nstrong economic performance with an average annual economic growth rate of 6.4% from 2010 \nto 2019.4 This sustained high economic growth contributed to a reduction in the national poverty \nrate  from  23.3%  in  2015  to  16.6%  in  2018. 5  However,  during  2010\u20132018,  the  Philippines\u2019 \nagriculture sector growth was stagnant with annual growth averaging  1.3%, which was lower than \nthat of Indonesia (3.9%), Viet Nam (2.7%), and Cambodia (2.0%).6 The poor sector performance \nhas been the result of decades of underinvestment, policy distortions, uncertainties linked to the \nimplementation  of  agrarian  reform,  and  periodic  extreme  weather  events.  It  has  significantly \nimpacted people\u2019s livelihoods and rural poverty. First, it has resulted in low incomes for farmers \nand  the  majority  of  the  rural  population,  which  has  impeded  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to \nsignificantly  reduce  rural  poverty.  The  rural  poverty  rate  remains  high  at  24.5%  while  national \npoverty incidence has declined (paras. 4, 12). Second, it has pushed up rice prices about 30% \nhigher than global prices. As rice accounts for 50% of total household calorie intake in the country, \nthe high domestic rice prices (i) hurt poor households with high food expenses in proportion to \ntheir total expenses, and (ii) threaten food security. \n \nImpact  of  COVID-19.  These  development  challenges  have  been  compounded  by  the \n4. \nCOVID-19  pandemic,  which  has  serious  economic  and  social  consequences.  Measures  to \ncontain the spread of the virus have resulted in job losses and reduction in household incomes.  \nAccording to ADB estimates, the unemployment rate in Luzon, which represents about 50.0% of \nthe  country\u2019s  population  and  70.0%  of  economic  activity,  could  peak  at  22.0%  in  the  second \n\n2017\u20132022.

Poverty incidence is estimated to rise to 20.7% in 2020 \nfrom  16.6%  in  2018,  threatening  to  reverse  the gains  made on this  front  with  5.5 million  more \nFilipinos  falling  into  poverty.  Disruptions  in  the  food  supply  chain  because  of  the  community \nquarantine have severely affected the poorest citizens, including farmers and fisherfolk. Playing \na  pivotal role  in  poverty reduction  and  ensuring food  security,  agriculture  is  among the  priority \nareas for reforms in the government\u2019s COVID-19 economic recovery program. \n \n5. \nDevelopment constraints. The Government of the Philippines recognizes the need for \ncompetitive and inclusive agricultural development. However, this has been hampered largely by \n(i) decades of protective policies and regulations for agricultural trade, (ii) inadequate provision of \npublic services and finance for agricultural development, and (iii) insufficient social protection of \nrural families. \n \n6. \nPolicy  and  regulatory  barriers  to  international  and  domestic  trade  of  agricultural \nproducts. Agricultural policy over the past few decades has prioritized food (particularly rice) self-\nsufficiency  by  protecting  domestic  producers  through  import  restrictions  (including  quantitative \nrestrictions on rice imports).8 These protective policies make domestic rice prices artificially higher \nthan world prices, giving incentives for farmers to continue with basic rice production. This has \nlimited their potential to move up the value chain, and precludes them from diversifying into higher-\nvalue crops and earning higher income.9 The protective rice trade is one of the root causes of the \nslow  progress  in  agriculture  diversification  and  commercialization,  resulting  in  low  sector \nproductivity and low farm incomes.10 \n \n7. \nUnder the protective trade regime, the National Food Authority (NFA) controls rice imports \nthrough the issuance of licenses for importers, wholesalers, retailers, and rice mills operating in \nthe domestic market.11 To protect farmers, the NFA also buys domestic paddy at higher prices; \nmills, distributes, and sells most of the rice at lower-than-market prices; and keeps the rest for \nemergency stock. However, this procurement operation is poorly targeted and benefits only few \nfarmers,  as  the  NFA\u2019s  operation  covers  only  1%  of  domestic  production.12 Further,  the  NFA\u2019s \nfinancially  inviable  operation  translates  into  substantial  liabilities  (\u20b1169.7 billion  in  2017)  which \nhas considerable national budgetary implications.13 \n\n \n\n7  ADB.  2020.

In 2004 (the latest estimates available), the \naverage  effective  rates of  protection in  the  Philippines  were  14.2%  for  agriculture,  10.0%  for manufacturing,  and \n18.1% for importable agricultural products (indicating protection afforded to agriculture, with a relatively high effective \nrate  of  protection  for  rice).

Fiscal Risks Statement 2020.  \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\fHigh import tariffs and quantitative restrictions on rice imports, alongside the NFA\u2019s near-\n8. \nmonopoly on rice trade, have resulted in inadequate rice supply and a serious distortion in the \ndomestic rice market. Additionally, administrative trade barriers, such as the issuance of sanitary \nand phytosanitary certificates for import, and inadequate interagency coordination among trade \nregulatory agencies also result in a high level of protection in agriculture. \n \n9. \nUncertain  agricultural  land  ownership.  Piecemeal  and  incomplete  agrarian  reforms \nhave led to uncertainties in agricultural land ownership and titles.14 The uncertainties have been \npartly caused by restrictions imposed by the Public Land Act enacted in 1936.15 The restrictions \ncomprise (i) prohibition on the sale and mortgaging of land within the first 5 years of the patent \ngrants; (ii) possible buy back of the land titles by original landowners within a 5-year period; and \n(iii) prohibition on corporations, associations, or partnerships acquiring or owning land. Uncertain \nland  ownership  prevents  farmers  from  using  their  land  as  collateral  to  access  credit.  It  also \nimpedes agricultural land transfer among farmers and agriculture-based corporations. Uncertain \nland ownership results in creating disincentives for landowners to invest in their own land, which \nleads to low agriculture productivity and poor sector performance. These restrictions inadvertently \nencourage underpriced informal land transactions, leading to losses in tax revenue. Women also \nremain  at  the  margins  of  agricultural  land  ownership,  comprising  about  30%  of  total  agrarian \nreform beneficiaries with individual land titles during 2000\u20132016.16 \n \nIneffective  water  resources  management.  A  complex  institutional  setup  and  poor \n10. \ncoordination and planning for water resources management cause inadequate irrigation services \nand uncontrolled flood risks, eroding agricultural productivity. There are more than 30 government \nagencies  managing  water  resources  and  utilization  in  the  Philippines,  operating  without  an \neffective  coordination  mechanism.  This  results  in  substantial  inefficiencies  in  the  development \nand operation of irrigation systems and low irrigation coverage.17 To tackle increasingly intense \nand  frequent  floods,  the  government  needs  to  prepare  flood  risk  management  master  plans \n(FRMMPs) for major river basins. \n \n11. \nLimited  public  financing  and  provision  of  agriculture  extension  services. \nUncoordinated arrangements for public financing and fragmented institutional setup for extension \nservices  undermine  support  to  agriculture.  There  are  various  government  programs  and  credit \nschemes to support agriculture, with a focus on rice production. However, there is a lack of overall \nplanning  and  coordination  of  those  programs.  Farm  extension  services  are  not  effectively \ndelivered because of the structural disconnect between the Department of Agriculture and local \n\n \n\n14 Presidential Decree No. 2 issued on 26 September 1972 proclaimed the entire country as a land reform area, and \nsimultaneously the Agrarian Reform Program was decreed. On 15 June 1988, the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform \nLaw was enacted, and the government aims at distributing the targeted 5.43 million hectares (ha) of agricultural lands \nto  landless  farmers  and  farm workers  under  the  Comprehensive  Agrarian  Reform  Program  (1988\u20132008)  and  the \nComprehensive Agrarian Reform Program Extension with Reforms (2009\u2212ongoing). During 1972\u20132019, cumulative \nland distribution and registration totaled 4.82 million hectares (88.8% of the targeted area) and the total number of \nagrarian reform beneficiaries reached 2,887,914.

This hinders  farmers  from  adopting  modern seed  varieties, modern farming \ntechnologies and practices, and farm mechanization. This is particularly aggravated for female \nfarmers,  as they  are  not  recognized  as  farmers because  of  social  and  cultural  norms.  Despite \ntheir  primary  role  in  the  family\u2019s  food  security,  only  23%  of  female  farmers  have  access  to \nextension services and only 14% of them receive financial assistance.18 \n \n12. \nPersistent rural poverty and food insecurity. Despite recent strong economic growth, \nannual incomes of households engaged in agriculture, forestry, and fishery are still low, leading \nto high rural poverty. While the rural poverty rate has declined to 24.5% in 2018 from 34.0% in \n2015, it remains substantially high.19 Poverty is also directly linked to malnutrition and stunting in \nchildren.  The  2018  Expanded  National  Nutrition  Survey  showed  that  undernutrition  rates \nremained  very  high  and  stunting  stood  at  30%  among  children  under  5,  affecting  3.5  million \nchildren of the 11.7 million aged 0\u20135 years.20 Chronic malnutrition or stunting is strongly linked \nwith high rates of disease and premature death. It also has adverse effects on crucial stages of \nchild development, leading to cognitive and behavioral deficits, learning disabilities, and ultimately \nan uncompetitive and suboptimal labor force. The Philippines is lagging behind other Southeast \nAsian  countries  such  as  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam  in  terms  of  making  the  shift  from  low-value \nagricultural commodities to products that can attract higher returns and improve farmer incomes. \nThis  is  largely  because  of  distortive  policies  favoring  low-value  commodities,  particularly  rice. \nMoreover, rice is the largest expenditure item in the food basket for poor Filipinos. Among the \npoorest 20% of households, including households headed by women, rice constitutes over 19% \nof their total expenditure.21 Low farm incomes together with high rice prices reduce disposable \nincome of poor households for other necessities, including human capital investments such as \neducation and health care, that are critical for future employment prospects. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nGovernment reform agenda. The PDP promotes inclusive growth and sets a strategic \ntarget for the Philippines to reach upper middle-income status by 2022. To maximize the inclusive \ngrowth  potential  of  agriculture,  the  PDP  lays  out  strategies  to  raise  sector  productivity  and \ncompetitiveness. Prior to the onset of COVID-19, the government had set the following targets to \nbe achieved during 2016\u20132022: annual real gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 7%\u20138%, per \ncapita GDP increase from $3,550 to $5,000, and poverty rate reduction from 21.6% to 14.0%. To \naccomplish  inclusive  growth,  the  government  has  emphasized  agriculture  sector  development, \nbecause the sector is pivotal in generating employment for one-fourth of the country\u2019s labor force \nthat is dependent on agriculture, including women, thereby reducing poverty and inequality for \nthree-fourths  of  the  poor  who  are  in  rural  areas.  Female  workers  account  for  22%  of  the \nagricultural  labor  force. 22  The  sector  also  provides  raw  materials  to  the  manufacturing  and \nservices  sectors,  generating  higher-paying  and  more  stable  job  opportunities  through  forward \nlinkages. \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n \n\n18 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, International Fund for Agricultural Development, United \nNations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  World Food  Programme,  and World  Health  Organization.  2018.

The  reform  areas  are  (i)  agricultural  trade  policy  and \n14. \nregulatory  framework  improved,  (ii)  public  services  and  finance  for  the  agriculture  sector \nenhanced, and (iii) social protection to rural families increased. The program will comprise two \nsubprograms. Subprogram 1 largely addresses constraints in the enabling environment and has \nprovided much-needed government-led direction and planning to support sustainable agriculture \nproductivity growth in the long term. Subprogram 2 will continue effective implementation of these \nreforms to further boost competitiveness and expand economic opportunities for farmers, crucial \nto accomplishing inclusive growth. A programmatic approach gives a flexible and effective way of \ntackling complex policy and institutional reforms to increase agricultural competitiveness. Under \nsubprogram  1, the  government  has  accomplished  13  policy  actions,  including  5  policy  triggers \nand 8 policy milestones. Subprogram 2 comprises 15 policy actions, of which 6 are policy triggers \nand 9 are policy milestones. \n \n15. \nReform Area 1: Agricultural trade policy and regulatory framework. Under this policy \nreform  area,  the  government  has  liberalized  and  facilitated  rice  trade  to  make  sufficient  rice \navailable at affordable prices in the domestic market and to be a catalyst for resources to diversify \nproduction and shift to higher-value agricultural products. This reform area will make agricultural \nproducts and input markets more flexible and responsive to price signals. Under subprogram 1, \nthe  government  enacted  the  Rice  Tariffication  Law  (RTL),  2019  and  adopted  its  implementing \nrules and regulations. The RTL removed (i) quantitative restrictions on rice imports and replaced \nthem  with  a  pure tariff system,  and (ii) the  NFA\u2019s  regulatory  powers  and  commercial  functions \nover  the  domestic  and  international  trade  of  rice  and  other  grains. 23  The  government  also \nfacilitated  trade  of  non-rice  agricultural  products  by  removing  administrative  barriers  for  their \nimport,  and  it  rolled  out  an  online  trade  facilitation  portal  (TradeNet)  with  the  Department  of \nAgriculture  as  a  key  regulatory  agency.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  issue \nimplementing  rules  of  the  NFA\u2019s  buffer  stock management to  better  cope  with  any  emergency \nsituations, including infectious disease outbreaks. \n \nReform  Area  2:  Public  services  and  finance  for  the  agriculture  sector.  Under  this \n16. \npolicy reform area, the government has improved (i) land and water resources use planning and \nmanagement, which are key production factors for agriculture; (ii) financing to make the Philippine \nrice  industry  competitive  under  the  liberalized  trade  regime;  and  (iii)  access  and  quality  of \nextension services. \n \n17. \nUnder subprogram 1, the government enacted the Agricultural Free Patent Reform Act, \n2019  to  retroactively  remove  the  restrictions  on  the  sale  and  transfer  of  agricultural  land  to \nfacilitate efficient and effective utilization of land as an asset. The government (i) took steps to \ncreate the Department of Water Resources (DWR) as a significant institutional reform aiming to \ncentralize  management  of  water  resources;  (ii)  formulated  and  adopted  the  National  Irrigation \nMaster Plan (NIMP)  24 for efficient and sustainable planning, and management of irrigation; and \n(iii) developed FRMMPs for major river basins. \n\n18. \nThe  government  set  up  the  Rice  Competitiveness  Enhancement  Fund  (RCEF)  to \nstrengthen the rice industry in 57 rice-competitive provinces during 2019\u20132024 in accordance with \nthe Philippine Rice Industry Roadmap (footnote 10). The RCEF provides an annual budget of \u20b110 \nbillion  from  increased  tariff  revenue  from  rice  imports  for  four  primary  programs:  (i)  rice  farm \nmachineries and equipment (\u20b15 billion); (ii) rice seed development, propagation, and promotion \n\n \n\n23 The import tariff rates are set for ASEAN countries at 35% and for non-ASEAN countries at 40% within the minimum \n\naccess volume of 350,000 metric tons and 180% for over the minimum access volume. \n\n24 Government of the Philippines, National Irrigation Administration.

Manila. \n\nUnpublished. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f(\u20b13 billion); (iii) expanded rice credit assistance (\u20b11 billion); and (iv) rice extension services (\u20b11 \nbillion). If the rice tariff revenue goes beyond the \u20b110 billion, the RCEF will further support the \nfollowing: (i) rice farmer financial assistance, (ii) titling of agricultural rice lands, (iii) an expanded \ncrop insurance program on rice, and (iv) a crop diversification program. To improve the targeting \nof RCEF programs, the government started updating the Registry System for Basic Sectors in \nAgriculture (RSBSA) to identify the beneficiary farmers, farmworkers, and their dependents.  \n \n19. \nSubprogram  2  will  help  consolidate  and  solidify  these  reforms  by  (i)  transforming  the \nNational  Water  Resources  Board  into  the  National  Water  Management  Council  to  streamline \nwater resources management as a provisional measure towards the establishment of the DWR, \nand (ii) allocating national budget to implement priority investment projects under the NIMP and \nthe FRMMPs. The government will (i) develop a rice fund impact monitoring system to assess the \nimpact  of  the  RCEF  programs  on  farm  productivity  and  income;  (ii)  complete  updating  of  the \nRSBSA; (iii) develop a national agriculture and fisheries modernization and industrialization plan \nto  map  out  a  detailed  sector  strategy;  and  (iv)  develop  a  pilot  project  to  establish  provincial \nagricultural and fishery extension centers to strengthen local government units\u2019 extension services \nfor farmers, with measures to promote women\u2019s meaningful participation and benefits. \n \n20. \nReform Area 3: Social protection to rural families affected by the reforms. There are \ntwo development objectives under this policy reform area: (i) mitigate the adverse impacts of the \nRTL  on  potential  losers  from  the  reforms,  such  as  smallholder  rice  farmers,  as  well  as  the \nunforeseen impact of COVID-19 on rural communities, and (ii) expand targeted social assistance \nprograms to rural communities including national feeding program to tackle persistent malnutrition \nand  stunting  among  children  and  rural  poverty.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government \n(i) established unconditional cash transfer programs for smallholder rice farmers who were most \naffected by low farmgate rice prices as a result of the RTL, and (ii) allocated \u20b13 billion under the \nRice  Farmer  Financial  Assistance  Program  and  an  additional  \u20b13  billion  under  the  Financial \nSubsidy to Rice Farmers Program. \n \n21. \nThe  government  also  established  (i)  the  Expanded  Survival  and  Recovery  (SURE) \nAssistance Program for Rice Farmers (SURE Aid, which is one of the SURE assistance programs) \nto  issue  no-collateral,  interest-free  loans  totaling  \u20b12.5  billion  to  164,274  small  rice  farmers              \n(1 hectare [ha] or less), of which about 45% are female; and (ii) the SURE COVID-19 Program \nwith  an  additional  \u20b12.5  billion  to  provide  no-collateral,  interest-free  loans  to  small  farmers  and \nfisherfolk (3 ha or less) and agri- and fishery-based micro and small enterprises affected by the \nCOVID-19  pandemic.  The  government  institutionalized  through  legislation  a  national  feeding \nprogram for undernourished children in public day care, kindergartens, and elementary schools \nto  address  high  rates  of  child  malnutrition  and  stunting  rates,  improving  nutritional  status  of \nchildren. \n \nUnder subprogram 2, the government will (i) provide an additional \u20b12.5 billion for SURE \n22. \nassistance programs as part of emergency support for vulnerable groups, (ii) implement a national \nfeeding program, and (iii) commence planning for a nutritional food program for poor pregnant \nwomen  as  part  of  its  zero-hunger  agenda  to  address  malnutrition  and  stunting  in  newly  born \nbabies.

Climate \nmitigation will be realized by reducing (i) energy use as a result of improved \nwater resources planning and utilization, (ii) greenhouse gas emissions via \ncrop diversification, and (iii) food loss and water use. \nThe program will foster international trade of agricultural products by \nreplacing quantitative restrictions with tariffication and streamlining \nadministrative procedures. \n\nNFA = National Food Authority, RCEF = Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund, SURE = survival and recovery. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n23. \nADB experience in the agriculture, natural resources, and rural development sector. \nADB  has  had  a  long  engagement  in  the  Philippines  agriculture,  natural  resources,  and  rural \ndevelopment  (ANR)  sector through  policy  advice  and  investment  projects.  Through the Grains \n2004), ADB developed an integrated package of policy and \nSector Development Program (2000\ninstitutional reforms linked to agriculture sector investment loans and technical assistance (TA).25 \nThese  included  trade  policy  reforms  to  the  rice  sector  and  reforms  to  the  NFA.  However,  the \nprogram was canceled in 2003 because of several reasons. First, the short period of the second \ntranche (9 months  after effectiveness) required  strong  ongoing political  support  to meet timing \n\n\u2212\n\n25 ADB. 1999.

Second, the counterpart funding \nrequirements  were substantial  in  the  context  of  the  Philippines  budgetary  constraints  following \nthe  Asia  financial  crisis.  Third,  disbursements  under  the  investment  loan  were  linked  to  the \nprogram  loan  conditions.  When  the  program  loan  failed  to  meet  its  policy  objectives,  the \ninvestment loan also failed. ADB supported agricultural land reform through the Agrarian Reform \n2019) and irrigation investments through the Second \nCommunities Project, phases 1 and 2 (1999\nIrrigation  Systems  Improvement  Project  (1995\n2006)  and  the  Southern  Philippines  Irrigation \n2011). 26 Most  recently,  ADB  supported  the  preparation  of  FRMMPs  for \nSector  Project  (1998\n\u2212\nmajor  river  basins  through  the  ongoing  Infrastructure  Preparation  and  Innovation  Facility \n2021).27 The proposed program lays out the policy foundations for ADB\u2019s future investment \n(2017\nprojects and programs in the ANR sector (Figure). \n \n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n \n24. \nADB\u2019s value addition to the program. The program provides an overarching framework \nfor ADB\u2019s investment projects and TA in the ANR sector under the current country partnership \nstrategy.  ADB  provided  the  government  with  critical  policy  advisory  support  to  draft  the \nimplementing  rules  and  regulations  of  the  RTL.  These  include  the  necessary  institutional \narrangements  that  will  enhance  competitiveness,  ensure  the  country\u2019s  smooth  and  timely \ntransition  to  a  new  rice  production  and  trading  regime,  and  institute  safety  nets  to  assist  local \nfarmers.

ADB is preparing a TA to pilot farming cluster development with \nmeasures  to  ensure  women\u2019s  meaningful  participation  and  benefit.  ADB  will  support  (i)  the \nimplementation of the NIMP through the Mindanao Irrigation Development Project (for approval \nin  2021);  and  (ii)  preparation  of  FRMMPs  for  the  major  river  basins  through  the  ongoing \nInfrastructure  Preparation  and  Innovation  Facility,  and  implementation  of  these  master  plans \nthrough the Integrated Flood Risk Management Sector Project (for approval in 2021). ADB will \nalso  help  promote  value  addition  and  diversification  through  the  Mindanao  Agro-Enterprise \nDevelopment Project (for approval in 2022). To further reduce hunger, the government created \nthe  Inter-Agency  Task  Force  on  Zero  Hunger  on  10  January  2020,  and  ADB  is  advising  the \ngovernment on the design of a nutritional food program for poor pregnant women as part of its \nzero-hunger agenda. \n \nLessons. The program was designed based on relevant lessons from ADB\u2019s experience, \n25. \nparticularly the Grains Sector Development Program whose objectives are similar to those of the \nPBL, 28 as  well  as  evaluation  findings  on  the  special  study  on  PBLs. 29 These  lessons  are  as \nfollows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAgriculture reforms are complex, have a medium- to long-term gestation period, \nand  require  proper  sequencing.  Programs  should  exhibit  sufficient  flexibility  to \naccommodate  a  medium-  to  long-term  development  horizon  and  the  inevitable \nchanges that occur when dealing with complex reform areas. \nStrong  high-level  government  resolve  and  ownership  are  key  to  successful \nimplementation of reforms. \nPolicy  reforms  create  winners  and  losers,  and  adverse  impacts  on  the  losers \nshould  be  mitigated  and  supplemented  with  expansion  of  social  assistance \nprograms to vulnerable rural families and communities. \nA programmatic approach and PBL will help to promote structural policy reforms \nin the sector and support downstream investment projects in irrigation, flood risk \nmanagement,  and  agribusiness  in  the  pipeline.  The  \u201cOne  ADB  approach\u201d, \ninvolving  extensive  coordination  within  ADB\u2019s  Southeast  Asia  Department  and \nacross ADB\u2019s departments, ensures an appropriate program design, the scope of \nwhich goes beyond the agriculture sector. \n\n \n26. \nDevelopment  coordination.  Major  development  partners  in  the  ANR  sector  in  the \nPhilippines  include  the  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development,  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency,  Korea  International  Cooperation  Agency,  and  World  Bank.  Strong \ndevelopment coordination and effective and efficient use of resources provided by development \npartners are imperative for the program. ADB will continue communicating with key development \npartners to gather lessons from partner programs and projects and further improve the program\u2019s \nimpact. \n \n27. \nADB  has  coordinated  closely  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  on  macroeconomic \nconditions  and  prospects  in  the  Philippines.  The  International  Monetary Fund  has  provided  an \nassessment  letter  for  the  program.  The  government  had  demonstrated  a  sound  record  of \nmacroeconomic management before the COVID-19 crisis. The economy expanded by 6.4% on \naverage during 2010\u20132019. Inflation had been carefully managed and was only 2.5% in 2019. \n\n \n\n28 ADB. 2007. Completion Report: Grains Sector Development Program in the Philippines. Manila.

Manila. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fImpacts of the Reform \n\nSlowing food price inflation served as the main inflationary brake following the enactment of the \nRTL. ADB estimates that the GDP will contract by 3.8% in 2020 because of a significant fall in \nhousehold  spending  and  investment  as  a result of  COVID-19  impact,  down  from the  originally \nprojected 6.2% growth for 2020. With economic policies mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and \nan acceleration in public investment, growth is projected to rebound to 6.5% in 2021.30 \n \nC. \n \nEconomic impact  of  the  program.  The  program  reforms  the  agriculture  sector  with  a \n28. \nspecific focus on dismantling trade protection in the rice sector. Overall, through reforms to move \ntoward  market-based  rice  prices  the  program  is  expected  to  facilitate  a  transition  from  rice \nproduction to higher value-added crops supported by enabling reforms to the management and \nutilization  of  key  production  factors,  such  as  land  and  water  resources,  and  better  extension \nservices and targeted funding to the sector. The key effect of the program is increased agricultural \ncompetitiveness  and  inclusiveness.  Reform  area  1  will  expose  the  rice  sector  to  international \ncompetition; reform area 2 will enhance its competitiveness; and reform area 3 will enhance its \ninclusiveness. The program will increase income opportunities in the agriculture sector as well as \nin the industry and services sectors through backward and forward linkages. The assessment of \nthe economic impact of the program focused on the impact of rice trade liberalization (reform area \n1) since the economic impact of the program is expected to result substantially from the enactment \nof the RTL in 2019. \n \n29. \nThe  welfare  impact  of  the  rice  trade  liberalization  is  estimated  at  $21  billion  during \n2020\u22122040.31 This trade policy reform will benefit all rice consumers in the Philippines (i.e., nearly \nthe entire population) through reduced retail rice prices, making them as the winners of the reform. \nOn the other hand, it will hurt most of the about 2 million rice farmers who sell rice to markets \nthrough reduced farmgate prices, making them as the losers of the reform. The consumer surplus \nis estimated at $50.7 billion. Per capita rice consumption is expected to increase by 6.3% to 120 \nkilograms  per  year  by  2025  and  to  fall  to  117  kilograms  per  year  by  2040,  and the  number  of \nmalnourished children is expected to decline from 3.0 million in 2015 to 2.4 million by 2040. On \nthe other hand, the loss in producer surplus is estimated at $29.7 billion, which is expected to be \npartly mitigated by the RCEF programs under reform area 2. Some farmers are expected to shift \nto high-value crops, such as vegetables and fruits. The RCEF will be financed by the rice tariff \nrevenue, which is expected to increase from $487 million in 2020 to $640 million in 2040. The \nRCEF  programs,  irrigation  expansion,  and  agricultural  extension  programs  are  expected  to \ngenerate a producer surplus of $7.3 billion. Further, under reform area 3, the program will include \nincome distributive benefits, such as income transfers to marginal rice farmers affected by the \nreforms and transfers to rural families to tackle long-term rural poverty, including dimensions such \nas malnutrition and stunting of children residing in rural communities. \n \nD. \n \n30. \nThe government has requested a regular loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 1.32 The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\n \n\n30 ADB.  2020.

Based on the annuity repayment \nmethod, the average maturity is 12.1 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \nThe indicative loan amount for subprogram 2 is $400 million, which will be funded from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources. The annual budget deficit was originally programmed at 3.2% of GDP \nin 2020 compared to 3.4% of GDP deficit in 2019. With significantly lower revenues because of \nthe economic contraction and higher spending to respond to the impacts of COVID-19, the deficit \nis  expected  to  widen  to  8.4%  of  GDP  in  2020.  As  such,  the  financing  requirement  of  the \ngovernment is expected to reach record levels at  \u20b12.9 trillion with a financing mix of 74% from \ndomestic borrowing and 26% from foreign borrowing.33 The loan size of subprogram 1 reflects \nthe government\u2019s total financing needs, the strength of the program, and its economic benefits. \n \nE. \n \n31. \nThe Department of Finance (DOF) is the executing agency. The implementing agencies \nare  the  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority,  the  Department  of  Agriculture,  the \nDepartment  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources,  the  Department  of  Public  Works  and \nHighways,  the  Department  of  Social  Welfare  and  Development,  and  the  National  Irrigation \nAdministration.  A  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  DOF  with  the  implementing  agencies  as \nmembers will oversee the program\u2019s implementation. The implementation period is May 2018\u2013\nApril 2020 for subprogram 1 and May 2020\u2013April 2022 for subprogram 2.

The  program  is  classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009). The potential environmental and social impacts of the proposed policy reforms have been \nassessed.34 No policy action will entail any involuntary resettlement or adversely affect indigenous \npeoples  or  the  environment.  Indigenous  peoples  will  benefit  from the  program  (e.g.,  access to \nfinance,  food  security,  and  flood  risk  mitigation).  There  will  be  no  differential  impacts  on \nindigenous peoples. \n \n33. \nClimate  change.  The  Philippines  is  highly  vulnerable  to  climate  change.  The  weak \nperformance of the crop subsector, the largest subsector in agriculture, is partly attributed to its \nvulnerability to extreme weather events (e.g., droughts and typhoons). The program will contribute \nto strengthening climate resilience of the agriculture and fishery sectors and reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions. Climate resilience will be realized by (i) improving water resources management \nthrough the legislation related to establishing the DWR, (ii) ensuring effective implementation of \nthe climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction and management measures laid out by \nthe  FRMMP  and  NIMP,  (iii)  strengthening  flood  risk  management,  and  (iv)  promoting  climate-\nresilient seed development and distribution under the RCEF. Climate mitigation will be realized \nby  reducing  (i)  energy  use  as  a  result  of  improved  water  resources  planning  and  utilization, \n(ii) greenhouse gas emission from crop diversification, and (iii) food loss and water use as a result \nof farmers\u2019 investment in on-farm water management and post-harvest processing equipment and \nfacilities from credit assistance under the RCEF.35 The total estimated climate financing is $52.31 \n\n33 Government of the Philippines, Department of Finance. 2020.

The country\u2019s overall poverty rate decreased from 23.3% in 2015 to \n16.6% in 2018. The short-term impact of the program is twofold. First, smallholder farmers will \nhave increased access to extension services, credit, and other support programs (including farm \nmechanization), which will help lift productivity and incomes over the medium to long term. Further, \nthe  RTL  has  already  pushed  down  domestic rice  prices  by  as much  as 22%,  which has  put  a \ndownward pressure to the national inflation rate, benefiting poor consumers.37 Second, with falling \nrice prices, smallholder rice farmers, especially in marginal lands, will be adversely affected. The \nprogram\u2019s  extension  of  social  assistance  to  vulnerable  communities  will  help  mitigate  these \neffects. In the longer term, part of labor and capital engaged in basic rice farming will be relocated \nto more profitable and diversified agricultural activities including farming with improved and high-\nquality rice varieties as the basic rice farming becomes less profitable. The COVID-19 pandemic \nhas started having an adverse impact on poverty in the short term because of (i) loss of incomes \nand livelihood, especially for informal sector workers; (ii) disruption of trade and markets affecting \nsmall-scale  entrepreneurs  and  food  producers,  including  farmers;  (iii)  immense  increase  in \npersonal debt; and (iv) illnesses or deaths of primary income earners in families.
