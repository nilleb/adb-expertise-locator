About  97,000  residents  are  expected  to  directly  benefit  from  climate-resilient \ninfrastructure development and better access to economic opportunities. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nSector  overview  and  performance.  Remarkably,  about  80%  of  global  travel  is \nintraregional.  Forecasts  suggest  that  Asia  and  the  Pacific  will  be  the  world\u2019s  fastest-growing \nregion through 2030, when it will receive 535 million tourists, or 30% of the global market share. \nIn 2016, ASEAN countries received 116 million international tourists, up 42% compared with 2011. \nASEAN arrivals are expected to grow 5.1% per year and reach 187 million in 2030.3 Cambodia \nand  the  Lao  PDR  receive  about  8%  of  ASEAN  arrivals  and  actively  cooperate  to  promote \nmulticountry  tour  programs that  connect the two  economies  with larger, more  affluent regional \nmarkets. Tourism directly contributes 12.2% to Cambodia\u2019s gross domestic product and 4.3% to \nthe Lao PDR\u2019s gross domestic product, generating 70%\u201378% of service exports and $3.7 billion \nin annual visitor expenditure. Tourism is employment intensive, providing jobs for about 1.1 million \nCambodian  and  Lao  workers\u23afthe majority  are women  in  small  and medium-sized  enterprises \n(SMEs).  In  total,  Cambodia  and  the  Lao  PDR  aim  to  create  900,000  tourism-related  jobs  and \nincrease international visitor expenditure to $6 billion per year by 2020. \n \nGovernment  efforts  to  upgrade  gateway  airports,  transnational  railways  and  highways, \n4. \nand secondary roads to boost travel and trade are supported by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and other development partners. Regional policies to liberalize transport services and ease \ncross-border tourism complement physical infrastructure investments.4 For example, Cambodia \nand the Lao PDR permit tourist visas on arrival for about 180 countries and grant 15-day tourist \nvisa exemptions to citizens of all ASEAN countries. As a result, more than 5 million tourists enter \nthe two countries each year using private buses or personal vehicles. \n \nKey  challenges.  Even  with  these  strengths  and  opportunities,  Cambodia  and  the  Lao \n5. \nPDR rank low in the World Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index, mainly because secondary \ndestinations lack modern transport infrastructure, quality urban environmental services, and the \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided transaction technical assistance to help design the project and prepare \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion Tourism Sector Strategy 2016\u20132025.

Jakarta. \n\n \n\n\fcapacity  to  sustainably  manage  infrastructure  assets. 5 Other  underlying  constraints  are  low \nservice  standards,  inadequate  tourism  planning,  and  insufficient  marketing,  which  collectively \nweaken  the  business-enabling  environment  for  tourism.  Consequently,  in  2016  Cambodia\u2019s \ninternational tourist arrival growth decelerated to 5%, about half the medium-term rate, and the \nLao PDR\u2019s arrivals fell by 9.5% compared with 2015. Fewer visitors and lower spending because \nof  poor  sanitation  and  hygiene  reduces  economic  benefits  by  at  least  $90  million  per  year. \nMoreover, average expenditure per visitor in Cambodia ($641) and the Lao PDR ($171) is well \nbelow  Asia  and  the  Pacific\u2019s  benchmark  of  $1,500.  Imbalanced  tourism  growth  within  the \ncountries  is  another  consequence  of  underinvestment  in secondary  destinations.  About half  of \ninternational  tourist  arrivals  and  corresponding  visitor  expenditure,  destination  investment,  and \ntourism employment are concentrated in just three cities: Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Vientiane \nCapital.6 \n \n6. \nClimate vulnerability. Secondary towns in the GMS corridors are vulnerable to climate \nchange  and  natural  disasters.  Risks  include  storm  surges  along  Cambodia\u2019s  coast,  and \nintensifying rainfall and flooding in the Lao PDR\u2019s central and southern river valleys. These are \nexacerbated  by  limited  country  capacity  to  integrate  adaptation  and  mitigation  solutions. \nCountering climate change and natural disasters requires finance and knowledge to retrofit and \nconstruct climate-resilient infrastructure and promote resource-efficiency certification programs. \nPublic awareness campaigns to promote lower-carbon travel, emission offsets, and environment-\nfriendly tourism services are also needed. \n \n7. \nTo  help  remove  these  constraints,  the  project  builds  on  ADB\u2019s  well-performing  GMS \ntourism operations by strategically financing climate-resilient roads, water transport infrastructure, \nurban  infrastructure,  and  capacity  building  for  better  destination  management,  all  of  which  is \nneeded to boost tourist arrivals and spending in secondary destinations.7 Priority investments are \n(i) road improvements to decongest and link urban areas with rural community-managed tourist \nattractions,  (ii)  small  ferry  ports  to  increase  passenger-handling  capacities  and  give  private \noperators the facilities needed to expand water transport and recreation services, (iii) drainage \nand riverbank protection in flood-prone areas, (iv) modern solid waste and septic management \nsystems, and (v) capacity building to support the implementation of ASEAN tourism standards \nand  improve  the  business-enabling  environment  for  tourism.  The  integrated  design  will  assist \nCambodia and the Lao PDR in attracting more and higher-spending visitors to secondary GMS \ncentral and southern coastal corridor towns, thus contributing to more balanced tourism growth \nand employment-intensive SME development in lagging areas. \n \nPolicy strategy framework. The project is consistent with Cambodia\u2019s National Strategic \n8. \nDevelopment  Plan  2014\u20132018  and  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  National  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan \n2016\u20132020,  which  emphasize  infrastructure  improvements  and  private  sector  development  to \nsupport  employment  and  income  generation,  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  climate \nresilience,  gender  equity,  and  regional  cooperation  and  integration.  It  is  aligned  with  the \noverarching  goals  of  poverty  reduction  through  sustained  and  inclusive  economic  growth,  as \n\n                                                \n5  In 2016, Cambodia ranked 101st and the Lao PDR ranked 94th among 136 economies evaluated. \n6  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Tourism  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  and  Viet  Nam \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7  ADB. 2014.

The project directly supports the implementation of the GMS Tourism Sector Strategy \n2016\u20132025 and ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration 2016\u20132020.9 \n \n9. \nDevelopment coordination. Project activities harmonize with tourism vocational training \nsupport  from  the  Government  of  Luxembourg  and  the  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  and \nCooperation.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  and  the  World  Bank  Group  also \nsupport  transport  and  urban  development  in  the  GMS  corridors.  Regional  assistance  is \ncoordinated  by  GMS  tourism,  transport,  and  urban  development  working  groups  comprising \nsenior  officials,  ADB  and  other  development  partners,  civil  society  organizations,  and  private \nadvisors.  Working  groups  meet  at  least  once  a  year  to  direct  strategic  programming,  share \nknowledge and good practices,  and  coordinate  joint  activities.  Cambodia\u2019s  Ministry  of Tourism \n(MOT) and the Lao PDR\u2019s Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism (MICT) coordinate national \ntourism planning and policy dialogue with development partners and tourism industry associations. \n \n10. \nValue added by ADB assistance. Value added by ADB includes support to prepare the \nGMS Tourism Sector Strategy 2016\u20132025. The $58.7 billion strategy provides government and \nthe  private  sector  with  a  blueprint  for  competitive,  balanced,  and  sustainable  destination \ndevelopment  that  aligns  with  ASEAN  regional  integration  objectives.  ADB  facilitated  public\u2013\nprivate dialogue and consensus building to prioritize project investments that build synergies with \nregional agriculture, transport, and urban development initiatives. Climate risk assessments and \ndetailed  engineering  designs  for  representative  infrastructure  subprojects  were  prepared  with \nsupport from the ADB Project Readiness Improvement Trust Fund.10 The building of capacity for \ndestination  management  integrates  the  Mekong  Innovative  Startup  in  Tourism  accelerator  to \nidentify  and  scale  technologies  that  drive  secondary  destination  tourism  growth.  The  Mekong \nBusiness Initiative, supported by ADB and the Government of Australia, created the platform. \n \n11. \nLessons. To reinforce sustainability and inclusiveness, the project design assimilates key \nlessons  from  ADB\u2019s  GMS  tourism  sector  assistance  program.  First,  infrastructure  and  tourism \ncapacity-building programs were selected based on robust demand analysis and private sector \nconsultations. Second, engineering solutions were chosen in consideration of lifecycle costs and \nwere  informed  by  climate  change  vulnerability  assessments.  Third,  business  development \nservices  target  SMEs  with  low  startup  costs  that  are  predominately  led  by  women.  Fourth, \ninstitutional  strengthening  promotes  women\u2019s  attainment  of  managerial  roles.  Finally,  early \ncapacity  building  for  infrastructure  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  will  ensure  that  suitable \nasset management systems are in place before works are commissioned.11 \n \n\n                                                \n8  ADB.  2014.

This  output  focuses  on  improving  roads,  water  transport  infrastructure,  and  waste \nmanagement in tourist sites. It will (i) upgrade 10.4 kilometers of urban roads in Cambodia and \n62.6 kilometers of urban and rural roads in the Lao PDR; (ii) build two ferry ports in Cambodia \nand two ferry ports in the Lao PDR; and (iii) construct controlled landfills in Kep, Cambodia and \nVang  Vieng,  Lao  PDR.  About  32,500  residents  living  along  the  roads  will  benefit  from  better \naccess  to  economic  opportunities  and  social  services.  Road  upgrades  include  drainage  and \nembankment protection to mitigate flood risk. Ferry port construction will improve water transport \nservices between Cambodia\u2019s coast and Koh Rong archipelago. The Lao PDR\u2019s new ferry ports \nwill widen access to the Nam Ngum hydropower reservoir\u23afthe country\u2019s largest\u23afand Mekong \nRiver  islands  bordering  Cambodia.  The  ports  will  benefit  4,300  residents  and  about  300  small \nferry operators. Each landfill will safely impound up to 720,000 cubic meters of solid waste and \ninclude  technology  to  recover  recyclables,  treat  leachate  and  septage,  and  mitigate  gas \nemissions.13 Expanded and more reliable waste collection will benefit 5,700 households. \n \n14. \nOutput  2:  Capacity  to  implement  ASEAN  tourism  standards  strengthened.  This \noutput will (i) strengthen assessment frameworks, certification bodies, and compliance monitoring \nfor  the  ASEAN  green  hotel,  community-based  tourism,  homestay,  clean tourist  city,  and  clean \npublic  toilet  standards;  and  (ii)  develop  incentives  and  conduct  training  to  enable  standards \nadoption by tourism and urban service providers. The project\u2019s intensive capacity support will help \nKampot, Kep, and Preah Sihanouk in Cambodia; and Luang Prabang, Pakse, and Vang Vieng in \nthe Lao PDR attain the ASEAN clean tourist city standard. In total, the project will assist more \nthan 250 tourism SMEs in becoming more competitive by improving service quality and consumer \nconfidence. Attaining the ASEAN clean tourist city standard will improve the urban environment \nfor about 325,000 residents and 6.5 million tourists who visit the targeted towns each year. \n \n15. \nOutput  3:  Institutional  arrangements  for  tourism  destination  management  and \ninfrastructure  O&M  strengthened.  Output  3  will  strengthen  Cambodia\u2019s  provincial  tourism \ndevelopment and management committees and the Lao PDR\u2019s sustainable tourism destination \nmanagement  network.  In  both  countries,  the  project  will  support  (i)  preparation  of  destination \nmanagement  plans,  (ii)  public\u2013private  policy  dialogue  to  improve  the  business  environment, \n(iii) SME business development services, (iv) tourism management training for public officials, (v) \ntourism  marketing,  and  (vi)  knowledge  management.  In  parallel,  the  project  will  (i)  assist \ninfrastructure  management  entities  (including  private  contractors)  to  prepare  O&M  plans, \n(ii) organize  technical  training  to  improve  infrastructure  asset  management,  (iii)  conduct \nsanitation- and hygiene-awareness campaigns, and (iv) provide transaction advisors to structure \ncompetitive procurement for solid waste management and ferry services. \n \n\n                                                \n12 ASEAN Secretariat. 2016.

Suitable  engineering  solutions  were  selected \nconsidering  cost,  durability,  climate,  environmental  and  social  impacts,  and  O&M  capacities. \nPreliminary designs comply with Cambodia and the Lao PDR\u2019s construction standards and local \ncontracting  industry  capabilities.  Climate  resilience  measures  include  stronger  road-base  and \npavement structures, higher capacity drainage, energy-efficient streetlights, and bio-engineered \nriver  embankment  and slope protection.  Passenger  piers  incorporate  sturdy  elevated  concrete \nand steel structures able to withstand projected storm surges and river flow velocities. Managed \nlandfills  will  be  constructed  on  existing  open  dumpsites  and  use  impermeable  liners  and \ngreenhouse gas abatement technologies to prevent air and groundwater pollution. Programs to \nbuild destination management capacity were designed based on training needs assessments and \ninstitutional  analyses  of  tourism,  transport,  and  urban  management  entities.  Special  design \nfeatures  to  uphold  sustainable  infrastructure  maintenance  include  maximum  use  of  robustly \nengineered  steel-reinforced  concrete  roads  with  lower  lifecycle  O&M  costs,  and  resources  to \nstrengthen  provincial  infrastructure  O&M  planning  and  budgeting.  The  project  will  procure \nappropriate  O&M  equipment  and  assist  management  entities  in  incorporating  maintenance \nrequirements into ferry port and waste management services contracts. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nEconomic analyses were prepared for the integrated project components following ADB \nguidelines.16 Costs  comprise  infrastructure  and  capacity-building  investments  and  the  market \nvalue of minor land acquisition. Benefits quantified conservatively include (i) increased tourism \nreceipts from incremental visitor arrivals and length of stay in project areas, (ii) vehicle operating \ncost  savings  from  reductions  in  road  roughness,  and  (iii)  health  benefits  and  tourism  loss-\navoidance from better solid waste management practices. Base-case economic internal rates of \nreturn (EIRR) range from 19.3% to 28.0% for road improvement subprojects, and from 12.7% to \n23.2% for the ferry ports. EIRRs for solid waste management improvements in Kep (22.9%) and \nVang Vieng (29.4%) also exceed the 9% social discount rate. All subprojects remain viable under \nadverse scenarios whereby costs are 10% higher, benefits 10% lower, implementation is delayed \nby 1 year, or there are 10% fewer tourist arrivals. The expected economic benefits are consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s completed GMS tourism projects in Cambodia and the Lao PDR, which generated \nEIRRs ranging from 16.0% to 78.2% for similar road, small port, and urban waste management \nimprovements in secondary tourist destinations, which benefited about 220,000 residents.17 \n \nFinancial analyses prepared following ADB guidelines confirm the financial viability of both \n23. \nthe revenue-generating solid waste management improvement subprojects and Preah Sihanouk \nCity\u2013Koh  Rong  ferry  ports.18 Financial  internal  rates  of  return  range  from  11.9%  to  12.6%  for \n                                                \n16 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB. 2017.

The base-case \nfinancial internal rate of return for Vang Vieng solid waste management improvements is 3.5%, \nhigher than the Lao PDR\u2019s 2.5% weighted average cost of capital. Quantified revenue streams \ncomprising  waste  collection  tariffs,  environmental  fees  to  be  introduced  by  the  respective \nprovincial  governments, and port fees  are  sufficient to fund  O&M.  Roads  that  do  not generate \nrevenue and the Lao PDR\u2019s port subprojects will require additional national budgetary allocations \nfor  routine  and  periodic  maintenance.  Loan  and  grant  assurances  confirm  the  governments\u2019 \ncommitments to funding sustainable asset maintenance. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nThe  financial  management  and  procurement  risks  for  Cambodia\u2019s  executing  and \nimplementing agencies is rated high. The main constraint is the lack of qualified accountants and \nprocurement specialists in provinces. The overall risk rating for the Lao PDR is also high because \nof  similar  constraints,  exacerbated  by  weak  audit,  financial  management,  and  procurement \noversight.  Risk  mitigation  measures  in  the  financial  management  action  plans  emphasize \nintensive on-the-job counterpart staff training and requirements to use standard ADB-approved \ndocuments for all procurement transactions. Both executing agencies have significant experience \nin managing advance accounts and statement-of-expenditure procedures. The terms of reference \nfor external auditors were agreed with the executing agencies during project preparation and form \npart of the PAMs. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the governments,  MICT,  MOT,  and  other  agencies involved  in the  project.  The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAMs. \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe project will directly benefit about 23,000 people in Cambodia and 74,000 people in \nthe Lao PDR.19 Poverty rates in project areas range from 12.0% to 19.9% because of low incomes, \ninsufficient  productive  assets  and  public  infrastructure,  shortages  of  quality  enterprise  support \nservices,  and  underdeveloped  human  capital.  While  Cambodia  and  the  Lao  PDR  significantly \nreduced  poverty  during  2003\u20132013,  inequality  is  widening.  For  instance,  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  Gini \ncoefficient  rose  from  0.31  to  0.36  over  this  period.  The  project\u2019s  integrated  infrastructure  and \ncapacity investments are designed to minimize these constraints and diversify employment and \nincome-generating opportunities for rural and urban households. Stakeholder communication and \nparticipation plans include activities to help women and vulnerable groups recognize and avoid \nsocial risks associated with tourism, such as human trafficking and child exploitation. \n \n26. \nGender.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  MICT  and  MOT \nprepared  the  GAP  in  consultation  with  project  beneficiaries,  civil  society  organizations,  and \ngovernment officials. PCUs, Cambodia\u2019s infrastructure project management unit,  and PIUs will \nimplement and monitor the GAP. Specific actions to promote gender equality include (i) separate \nconsultations  with  women  and  men  to  ensure  gender-sensitive  detailed  engineering  designs; \n(ii) requirements  to  involve  women  in  infrastructure  construction  and  management;  (iii)  equal \nparticipation  in  sanitation  awareness,  road  safety,  and  HIV/AIDS  prevention  programs;  and \n(iv) women\u2019s  appointment  as managers  and leaders  of tourism  standards  assessment  boards, \ndestination  management  organizations,  and  project  management  entities.  The  project \nperformance management system will compile sex- and ethnic-disaggregated data to monitor and \nevaluate results. \n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n                                                \n19 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nE. \n \n27. \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s  Safeguard Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguards \ncategorization  is  B  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples. 20  All \nsafeguards documents were prepared based on meaningful consultations with affected people \nand  communities,  endorsed  by  government  authorities,  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  2011.  Grievance  redress,  monitoring,  and \nreporting  procedures  are  properly  established  in  all  safeguards  documents.  During  project \nimplementation, all safeguard documents will be updated based on detailed engineering designs, \nreviewed by ADB, and publicly disclosed. The project includes adequate resources to update all \nsafeguard  documents  and  build  counterpart  capacity  to  implement  environmental  and  social \nmonitoring. \n \n28. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  MICT  and  MOT  each  prepared  one  initial  environmental \nexamination  and two  environmental  management  plans (EMPs),  covering  the  project\u2019s  area  of \ninfluence and all road, port, and landfill subprojects. The EMPs provide adequate measures to \nmitigate  the  expected  minor  and  temporary  construction  impacts  and  the  potential  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  of  increased  tourism  activity,  particularly  near  marine  and  terrestrial-\nprotected areas. Improved solid waste and septage management, better roads and drainage, and \nthe  adoption  of  ASEAN  tourism  standards  are  expected  to generate  overall  net  environmental \nbenefits. Loan and grant covenants require contractors and destination management agencies to \ncomply with initial environmental examination and EMP mitigation measures. \n \n29. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  Involuntary  resettlement  impacts  will  be \nadequately managed by implementing resettlement plans agreed by the governments and ADB. \nOverall, 23 households with 76 persons will be affected by minor loss of structures and temporary \nbusiness  disruption  within the  right-of-way  in  Preah  Sihanouk,  Cambodia.  In the  Lao  PDR,  59 \nhouseholds with 274 persons  will  be  affected,  19  of them  (with  79  persons)  severely  because \nthey must move their shops about 300 meters. Initial resettlement and compensation costs are \nestimated at $64,176 for Cambodia and $300,513 for the Lao PDR. This amount is considered \nadequate  based  on  the  inventories  of  losses  prepared  in  consultation  with  the  affected \nhouseholds. \n \n30. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  B).  The  project  will  positively  affect  Hmong,  Iu  Mien, \nKhmu, and Tai Dam ethnic groups in the Lao PDR project areas by creating culturally appropriate \njobs, diversifying income, and strengthening tourism management by ethnic communities. Ethnic \ngroups  will  equally  benefit  from  improved  access  to  markets  and  social  services,  better  waste \nmanagement,  and  capacity  building.  The  Lao  PDR\u2019s  indigenous  peoples  plan  identifies  the \npotential negative impacts and adequate measures to mitigate them. The Lao PDR will appoint \nqualified  PCU  and  PIU  staff  to  properly  implement  the  indigenous  peoples  plan  using  project \nresources. Due diligence confirms that no indigenous peoples will suffer any impacts in Cambodia. \n \nF. \n \n31. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n                                                \n20 ADB.
