It will \nfinance  (i)  the  border  facilities  at  Wutung,  (ii) consulting  services \nfor  project  implementation  and  construction  supervision,  (iii) \ncapacity  development,  and  (iv)  a  social  development  program \nincluding HIV/AIDS prevention.  \n \nWSP  is  one  of  the  poorest  provinces  in  PNG  in  terms  of  both \neconomic  and  social  development.  However,  it  has  potential  to \ndevelop  itself  and  drive  the  development  of  PNG\u2019s  northern \ncoastal  region  if  it  can  capture  the  opportunities  offered  by  Asia, \nparticularly  the  neighboring  Papua  Province  of  Indonesia,  which \nprovides  25%\u201340%  cheaper  products  and  services  and  is  in \ndemand of PNG products.  \n \nThe  Project  will  help  improve  the  business  environment  in  WSP \nby  reducing  the  business  transaction  costs  associated  with \ninfrastructure, compliance with government rules and regulations, \nand thin human capital. It aims at developing WSP into a dynamic \ngrowth center for PNG, which can catalyze the development of the \nneighboring  provinces\u2014including  Manus,  East  Sepik,  Madang, \nand Morobe provinces.  \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $30  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $2.33 million.  \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of \n$25 million  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  to  finance \n83% of the total cost. The Government will provide $5 million, or \n17% of the total project cost. \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification  \n \n\n \n \nCategory B \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n\f \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nii  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe ADF loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing \nRights  15,684,000  ($25  million)  will  have  a  maturity  of  32  years \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest charge of 1% per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter, \nequal amortization, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft ADF loan agreement.  \n \nUntil 30 June 2018 \n \n31 December 2017 \n\n \nBorder Development Authority (BDA) \n \nBDA will be the Executing Agency for the Project. It will establish \na  provincial  management  office  (PMO)  in  WSP  to  manage  the \nProject  on  the  ground,  and  eventually  develop  the  PMO  into  a \none-stop office for promoting investment and trade. \n \nThe procurement will mainly consist of civil works and equipment \nand will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  There  are  two  civil  works  contract  packages \nand eight equipment packages. \n \nInternational  and  national  consultants  will  provide  (i)  support  to \nBDA  and  its  PMO  in  the  areas  of  contract  management, \ninvestment  and  tourism  promotion,  capacity  development,  and \nsocioeconomic  monitoring;  (ii)  construction  supervision  and \nenvironmental  monitoring;  and  (iii)  HIV/AIDS  prevention.  The \nconsultants  will  be  hired  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  They \nwill  be  recruited \nthrough  quality  and  cost-based  selection, \nindividual  consultant  selection,  single-source  selection,  or  other \nmethods as appropriate.  \n \nThe  Project  will  help  PNG  benefit  from  the  dynamic  economic \ndevelopment  in  Asia.  Expanded  trade  with  Papua  Province  of \nIndonesia  resulting  from  the  Project  will  (i)  encourage  PNG  to \nspecialize  according  to  its  comparative  advantages  and  enable \nefficient  deployment  of  national  resources;  (ii)  increase  PNG \nideas,  management  and \nto  PNG \nexports; \norganization skills, and technology to increase productivity of local \nbusinesses;  and  (iv) give  PNG  consumers  a  wider  range  of \nproducts at cheaper prices. \n \nThe Project is economically viable. At a 12% discount rate, the net \npresent  value  is  about  K5.52  million  and  the  economic  internal \nrate  of  return  is  14.05%.  Even  at  the  project  preparation  stage, \nbusiness  confidence  in  WSP  increased  and  a  record  level  of \nbusiness registration was reported for 2008.  \n\n(iii) disseminate \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\niii\n\nThe  investment  and  capacity  development  components  of  the \nProject will generate employment for more than 200 persons. The \nspillover  benefits  to  the  service  sector  are  difficult  to  predict,  but \nwill be significant. The social development program of the Project \nwill directly alleviate the non-income poverty of five border villages \nwith a population of about 4,000. \n \nThe Project may face the following risks: \n(i)  Procurement.  All  procurement  financed  under  the  loan  will \nfollow ADB guidelines, with which BDA is not familiar. Similar \nto other ADB projects in PNG, procurement of civil works will \nbe hampered by lack of qualified contractors. In addition, BDA \nwill  have  to  deal  with  the  Government\u2019s  lengthy  process  for \ncontract approval. \n\n(ii)  Financial  management.  Financial  discipline  is  generally \nweak  in  PNG.  Safeguarding  the  financial  integrity  of  the \nProject will be a challenge for BDA. \n\n \nThe Project includes the following mitigation measures: \n(i)  providing  procurement  and  financial  consultants  through \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  assist  BDA  in  finalizing  the \nbidding  documents  and  evaluating  bids,  and  providing \ninternational  and  national  consulting  services  under  the  loan \nto assist BDA in managing the Project; \n\n(ii)  engaging  a  reputable  accounting  firm  through  the  TA  to \nprovide  long-term  services  to  BDA,  assisting  in  financial \nmanagement;  \n\n(iii) using modified conditional cash transfer to carry out the social \ndevelopment program to minimize demand on BDA\u2019s capacity \nas well as capture, leakages, and noncompliance; and \n\n(iv) assisting  BDA  staff  in  joining  ADB  training  programs  on \nanticorruption, \n\nfinancial  management, \n\nprocurement, \ndisbursement, and project management.  \n\nIndustry \n\nin  developing \n\n \nA  TA  grant  will  be  attached  to  the  Project  to  (i)  assist  the \nDepartment  of  Commerce  and \nthe \ninvestment  legislation  and  telecommunication  strategy  for  WSP, \nand (ii) assist BDA in procuring civil works for border facilities and \nmanaging the financial aspect of the Project. The objectives of the \nTA  are  (i)  to  assist  in  catalyzing  investment  in  WSP  and \nincreasing the supply of PNG products in demand by helping the \nGovernment \nto  prepare  specific  investment  policies  and  a \ntelecommunication solution  for  WSP,  both  of  which  are  critical  to \nreduce business transaction costs and increase the attractiveness \nof WSP as a destination for investment; and (ii) to facilitate project \nimplementation. \n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  of  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nloan  to  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  for  the  Pilot  Border  Trade  and  Investment  Development \nProject.  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Trade  and \nInvestment  Institutional  Strengthening  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting \nunder  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will  approve  the  TA.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nLocated  in  the  northwest  of  PNG,  West  Sepik  Province  (WSP)  is  PNG\u2019s  third  largest \nprovince\u2014with  a  land  area  of  3,605  hectares,  accounting  for  7.77%  of  PNG's  total  land.  The \nland area of WSP consists of a high mountainous region to the south, Sepik basin in the center, \nand  the  low  coastal  region  to  the  north.  Its  four  districts  are  generally  mountainous,  and \nmountain ranges are dominated by limestone karst with a large number of caves.  \n \n3. \nWSP  is  one  of  the  least  developed  provinces  in  PNG.  It  is  remote  and  isolated  from \nPNG\u2019s major population and growth centers, and is only accessible by air and coastal shipping. \nAccessibility within the province is also poor. There is no road connection between Vanimo (the \ncapital of the province) and the four districts, and between the four districts themselves. \n \nThere  are  few  economic  activities  in  the  province.  The  modern  sector  is  dominated  by \n4. \nthe  Government  and  the  timber  industry.  Logs  are  exported  without  being  processed.  Around \n92% of the province\u2019s 190,000 population is isolated in the rural areas, surviving on subsistence \nagriculture. \n \nThe  internal  revenue1  of  the  province  totaled  less  than  K2  million  in  2007,  the  highest \n5. \nsince  2004.  The  province  relies  almost  entirely  on  national  grants  to  finance  basic  service \ndelivery such as education, health, and transport infrastructure maintenance. It received about \nK5.64 million in national grants in 2008 and is guaranteed to receive this level of grants annually \nuntil 2013, which will enable it to cover about 50% of the cost of service delivery.2 \n \n6. \nThe development indicators are among the worst in PNG. The adult literacy rate for the \nprovince is estimated around 45%. Life expectancy at birth is only 46 years, significantly shorter \nthan the national average (57.4 years). The infant mortality rate is 71 per 1,000 live births, the \nfourth  highest  in  PNG.  The  child  mortality  rate  under  the  age  of  five  is  64  per  1,000.  The \nmalnutrition rate is around 40%.  \n \n7. \nThe province, nevertheless, has opportunities to improve its development status. First, it \nis richly endowed with minerals, forest, fishery, and eco-conditions for agricultural crops such as \ncocoa, oil palm, and vanilla. Culturally, it is also diverse. The province has five different cultural \nzones and 95 local languages. Each zone has different rites, traditions, and art styles.  \n \n8. \nSecond,  the  province  shares  260  kilometers  of  land  border  with  Papua  Province  of  \nIndonesia, which is the second richest province in Indonesia and offers products and services at \n                                                 \n1 Includes licenses, fees, taxes, commercial receipts, and miscellaneous revenue.  \n2 National Economic and Fiscal Commission. 2008. Review of Provincial Revenues. Port Moresby.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nprices  25%\u201340%  lower  than  those  of  PNG.  Vanimo  (capital  of  WSP)  is  well  connected  with \nJayapura  (capital  of  Papua  Province  of  Indonesia)  by  road.  In  terms  of  development  status, \nJayapura is about 40 years ahead of Vanimo. \n \nAcknowledging the trade benefits, PNG and Indonesia signed an agreement on Special \n9. \nArrangements  for  Traditional  and  Customary  Border  Crossings  in  1993.  Border  residents  with \nborder-crossing cards are allowed to freely enter into and travel within the corresponding part of \nthe border  area of the  other solely for traditional and customary purposes. Each cardholder is \nentitled to $300 worth of goods free from taxes per month. \n \n10. \nIndonesia is in demand of beef, beer, betel nuts, cocoa, snack foods, tuna, and vanilla \nfrom PNG, while PNG  buys spare parts for trucks, rice, water, electronics, textiles, and house \nware from Papua Province of Indonesia. Official Indonesian records show that the cross-border \ntrade volume reached about $7 million in 2007. At the border, people carry betel nuts from PNG \nto Indonesia and rice from Indonesia to PNG. PNG official records3 show that WSP increased its \ncocoa  production  from  545  tons  in  2004  to  1,193  tons  in  2007.  Its  share  of  PNG  total  cocoa \nproduction  rose  from  1.6%  in  2004  to  2.7%  in  2007.  Statistics  from  WSP  indicate  that  about \n1,000  tons  of  vanilla  were  exported  to  Indonesia  through  the  Wutung  border  in  2004  and  664 \ntons of cocoa in 2008.  \n \nLogging  and  mining  can  increase  revenues  temporarily  but  will  not  be  in  the  long-term \n11. \ninterest  of  the  province.  Constructing  roads  and  delivering  services  across  the  vast  land,  with \ndifficult terrains and geotechnical conditions, will be costly and unaffordable. The development \nopportunity for the province lies in strengthening economic cooperation with Papua Province of \nIndonesia and building growth centers. \n \n12. \nInternational  experience  shows  that  trade  and  investment  promote  economic  growth, \ncreate  job  opportunities,  and  develop  human  capital.  Foreign  trade  and  investment  will \ncontribute  more  than  the  needed  finance.  More  importantly,  these  will  bring  with  them \nemployment,  technical  and  engineering  skills,  management  expertise,  technology,  a  business \nculture, and markets. \n \nExpanding  cross-border  trade  with  Indonesia  will  provide  people  in  WSP  with  a  wider \n13. \nchoice of products at lower costs and increase their welfare. It will also improve market access \nfor  PNG  exports,  increase  business  opportunities,  stimulate  investment,  create  jobs,  enhance \nproductivity, and lead to more rapid and sustainable growth. Promising economic activities that \nmay  be  stimulated  include  cash  crop  production  and  processing,  tourism,  transshipment, \nfishery, and pharmacy. The analysis of WSP and its development opportunities is in Appendix 2.  \n \n14. \nAlthough there seems to be a large number of traditional border-crossing points between \nIndonesia  and  PNG,  the  Skouw\u2013Wutung  border  is  the  most  formal  one  with  significant  trade. \nIndonesian border facilities at Skouw were built in 1992 and designed for vehicle crossing, with \na washdown area and large parking facilities for customs and other inspections. The governor of \nPapua  Province  of  Indonesia  visited  PNG  in  2008  and  made  a  joint  statement  with  the  Prime \nMinister  of  PNG  to  expand  trade  and  economic  cooperation  between  the  two  sides.  The \nGovernment of Indonesia has approved an increase of tax exemption entitlements for traditional \nborder  crossers  from  $300  to  $1,000.  In  addition  to  the  two  existing  markets,  it  has  built \n60 market houses, and is planning to build larger and better border facilities. \n \n                                                 \n3 Department of Commerce and Industry. 2008. Statistical Digest. Port Moresby. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nSince 2006, PNG and Indonesia have been in discussions to open the Skouw\u2013Wutung \n15. \nborder  post  and  Jayapura\u2013Vanimo  road  for  vehicles.  Talks  have  also  been  held  on \nimplementation of the agreement on compulsory motor vehicle insurance; direct land, sea, and \nair transportation; avoidance of double taxation; and establishment of the joint business council. \nThe  Agreement  on  Avoidance  of  Double  Taxation  and  Prevention  of  Fiscal  Evasion  is  being \nprepared for signing.  \n \n16. \nPNG, however, is reluctant to open the border for vehicle crossing because the border \nfacilities at Wutung can hardly cope with the current foot crossing, not to mention traffic flows. \nThere are no parking lots for vehicles from Indonesia and customs and quarantine facilities. The \nsocioeconomic  study  carried  out  under  the  project  preparatory  TA4  indicates  that  people  are \nconcerned  that  the  border  might  be  opened  without  a  proper  infrastructure  and  management \nsystem to protect PNG from diseases and illegal activities.  \n \n17. \nThe Project is the first step of the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto  enhance  economic  cooperation  between  PNG  and  Asia.  It  will  help  improve  the  business \nenvironment in WSP; and enable WSP to capture the opportunities offered by the fast-growing \nAsian economies for growth, development, and employment.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nChallenges \n\nDeveloping  WSP  faces  a  combination  of  challenges\u2014external,  internal,  physical, \n\n18. \ninstitutional, environmental, and social.  \n \n19. \nGlobal economic crisis. PNG performed well economically during 2004\u20132007, thanks \nto  political  and  macroeconomic  stability  and  high  international  commodity  prices.  Real  gross \ndomestic  product  growth  was  2.7%  in  2004,  3.4%  in  2005,  2.6%  in  2006,  and  an  estimated \n6.2% in 2007.  \n \n20. \nThe global financial crisis that began in late 2008 has caused large falls in the prices of \nPNG\u2019s major export items: 75% for crude oil, 50% for palm oil, 50% for copra, 15% for cocoa, \nand 15% for coffee. PNG\u2019s real gross domestic product growth is projected to slow down to 4% \nin 2009 and 3.5% in 2010. The national grants to the provinces are expected to be reduced by \n25% in 2009 as a result of the dwindling revenue.  \n \n21. \nPoor  infrastructure.  WSP  is  only  connected  with  the  rest  of  PNG  by  flight  (3  times \nweekly) and coastal shipping (twice a month). Since WSP is not interlinked by roads, air flight is \nthe only means to reach most parts of the vast province. Telecommunication services are costly \nand  unreliable.  Mobile  phones  and  even  landline  services  are  often  disrupted,  sometimes  for \ndays. Internet access is limited to slow and expensive dial-up service. There is no water supply \nin Vanimo, which depends entirely on rainwater. Most of the population has no electricity service \nat  home.  Port  facilities  have  limited  capacity  and  can  only  cater  to  small  vessels.  Border \nfacilities at Wutung post have deteriorated and are not capable of handling vehicle crossing.  \n \n22. \nDifficult regulatory framework for investment. The role of the Government of Papua \nNew  Guinea  and  its  policies,  regulations,  and  administrative  practices  are  perceived  as  a \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Preparing the Pilot Border Trade and Investment Development Project. Manila \n\n(TA 7125-PNG). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ndisincentive for businesses, as revealed by a recent survey of 243 businesses carried out by an \nADB  study  in  2007.  5    Nearly  70%  of  the  businesses  surveyed  indicated  that  the  Government \nwas  unhelpful,  and  50%  cited  costly  and  time-consuming  compliance  with  government \nregulations as a reason to abandon investments.  \n \n23. \nThe  business  regulatory  framework  does  not  provide  a  conducive  environment.  It \ninvolves  significant  administrative  discretions,  cumbersome  procedures  and  processes,  and \nunnecessary  and  unwarranted  opportunities  for  rent  seeking.  It  emphasizes  controlling  rather \nthan  facilitating  business  development.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Doing  Business  reports,  which \nquantitatively  measure  government  regulations  in  terms  of  starting  a  business,  dealing  with \nconstruction  permits,  employing  workers,  registering  property,  accessing  credit,  protecting \ninvestors,  paying  taxes,  trading  across  borders,  enforcing  contracts,  and  closing  a  business \nindicate that PNG is not improving while other countries are advancing. Most of the indicators \nfor PNG in the 2008 and 2009 reports stayed the same, but its overall ranking slipped from 89 in \n2008 to 95 in 2009. PNG regressed particularly in the areas of starting a business (requiring 8 \nprocedures  and  56 days),  dealing  with  construction  permits  (requiring  24  procedures  and \n217 days), access to credit, and trading across borders.6  \n \n24. \nThe  immigration  and  labor  regulations  and  minimum  wage  requirement  further  reduce \nthe  competitiveness  of  PNG  as  a  business  destination.  Of  1,048  occupation  codes,  578 are \nreserved  for  nationals.  Foreign  workers  must  obtain  work  permits  and  an  employment  visa. \nProcessing of work permits and employment visas is unpredictable, lengthy, and costly. Up-front \ntraining  and  localization  programs  are  also  required  from  foreign  investors.  In  February  2009, \nthe  National  Minimum  Wages  Board  proposed  a  new  minimum  wage  structure  for  unskilled \nformal  sector  workers  in  PNG.  If  approved,  the  minimum  wage  will  increase  by  274%  from \nK37.2  to  K101.8  per  week  within  1  year  of  effectiveness.  The  assessment  of  the  regulatory \nframework is in Appendix 3. \n \nAs a result of the high cost of doing business, PNG tends to attract large businesses that \n25. \nare capital-intensive with potential to yield high returns, such as mining and logging. Agriculture \nand  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  which  have  employment  potential,  have  not  seen \nrising investments. Foreign direct investments fluctuate steeply with mining activities, from about \n$100 million in 2003 to less than $40 million in 2006.7 \n \n26. \nIn WSP, Vanimo has been declared a free trade zone since 2000, but no investor has \never  applied  to  operate\u2014reflecting  investors\u2019  negative  perception  of  the  WSP  business \nenvironment.  \n \n27. \nThin human capital. The adult literacy rate in PNG is 57.3% and the combined primary, \nsecondary, and tertiary gross enrollment ratio is 40.7%. The adult literacy rate in WSP is around \n45%  and  there  is  a  skills  shortage  in  almost  all  professions.  The  liquefied  natural  gas  project, \nwith  its  skilled  labor  requirement  anticipated  to  be  8,000  in  the  medium  term,  is  expected  to \naggravate  the  labor  market.  People  in  WSP  fear  they  may  not  be  able  to  participate  in  the \ndevelopment  because  they  do  not  have  entrepreneurship,  technical  and  vocational  skills,  and \nexperience with trade and formal business enterprise.  \n \n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2007.

More than 70% of WSP\u2019s land is covered with \n28. \noriginal rainforest. Five logging companies have been authorized to operate in the province and \nillegal logging has been suspected. Preservation of the forest will be very difficult given the lack \nof  economic  activities,  vast  land,  small  population,  and  corruption.  Road  development  may \naggravate the situation. \n \n29. \nAlthough  law  and  security  conditions  seem  to  be  better  in  WSP  than  in  other  parts  of \nPNG,  social  conflicts  and  disputes  over  land  titles,  concession  fees,  and  compensation  are  a \nregular occurrence.  \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\nAs  early  as  1965,  a  piece  of  land  was  acquired  for  Wutung  border  development.  The \n30. \nGovernment  introduced  a  Border  Development  Program  in  1979  with  the  main  objectives  of \nimproving security and stability along the PNG\u2013Indonesia border by promoting the well-being of \nthe people along the border and engaging them in development activities. In 2000, the Physical \nPlanning Office of WSP prepared the Wutung (Physical Planning) Subject Development Plan in \nline  with  the  Physical  Planning  Act,1989.  The Free  Trade Zone  Act  was  also  enacted  in  2000 \nand Vanimo was declared one of the four free trade zones.  \n \nFunding for the Border Development Program and the Wutung border has been limited \n31. \nand  on  an  ad  hoc  basis.  PNG\u2019s  total  expenditure  on  projects  along  the  border  is  over \nK21 million  to  date,  in  contrast  to  $30  million  annual  expenditure  by  Indonesia  in  its  border \nareas.  The  Border  Development  Program  was  abolished  in  2000  and  reinstated  in  2001.  It \nprioritized  road  construction  and  establishment  of  border  posts  along  the  border.  During  2002 \nand  2003,  K350,000  was  committed  to  Wutung  border  post  facilities.  In  2004,  K4  million  was \nprovided for sealing Vanimo\u2013Jayapura road and for Wutung border facilities.8 The road sealing \nwas  completed  recently  and  the  road  is  in  good  condition.  However,  the  Wutung  border  was \nnever completed according to the Wutung (Physical Planning) Subject Development Plan, 2000. \n \n32. \nIn  1993,  the  governments  of  PNG  and  Indonesia  entered  into  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding to establish the Joint Border Committee. Meetings of the Joint Border Committee \nare  held  annually  in  both  countries.  To  date,  14  memorandums  of  understanding  have  been \nsigned  on  traditional  and  customary  border  crossings,  demarcation  of  the  boundary,  security, \ninternational  communication,  rescue  activities,  technical  subcommittee,  air  service,  use  of  the \nFly River, banking, motor vehicle insurance, animal and plant quarantine, and customs.  \n \n33. \nThe  PNG\u2019s  Medium  Term  Development  Strategy  2005\u20132010  included  private  sector \neconomic growth and least developed areas\u2019 interventions as two of the 10 guiding principles.9 \nIt  sets  the  goal  of  improving  living  standards  through  an  overarching  development  strategy  of \nexport-driven economic growth, rural development, and poverty reduction. In 2005, K1.7 million \nwas provided to Western Province10 for maintenance of staff housing, schools, health centers, \nairstrips, and existing feeder roads. From 2007 to 2009, K10 million\u2013K20 million was allocated \nannually  for  border  development.  In  October  2008,  the  Government  established  the  Border \nDevelopment  Authority  (BDA)  to  address  the  specific  needs  of  the  six  border  provinces \nincluding WSP, particularly infrastructure and foreign and local investment.  \n \n                                                 \n8   Department  of  Provincial  and  Local  Government  Affairs.  2008.

In  July  2008,  the  Government \namended  the  Organic  Law  on  Provincial  Governments  and  Local-Level  Governments  and \nintroduced a new intergovernmental financing system. The new system provides  for provincial \nand local governments as a group to receive funding for recurrent goods and services as a fixed \npercentage  of  net  national  revenue.  This  amount  is  referred  to  as  the  equalization  amount.  If \nnational revenues rise, provincial and local governments are entitled to share in the increase; if \nrevenues fall, the national grants will also be reduced. The percentage will increase each year \nfrom 2009 to 2013, enabling increasing funding to provincial and local governments for recurrent \ngoods  and  services.  The  equalization  amount  will  guarantee  all  provinces  not  to  receive  less \nthan the allocations they received in 2008 during 2009\u20132013. The surplus will then be allocated \non a needs basis.11 This means that a poor province such as WSP will receive relatively more \nresource allocation. \n \n35. \nIn  1993,  PNG  became  a  member  of  the  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  forum, \nwhich identified trade and investment facilitation as one of the three key areas for its future work \nprogram in 1995. PNG joined the World Trade Organization in 1995. It completed a 7-year tariff \nreform  program  in  2006  and  reduced  the  tariff  rates  to  15%,  25%,  and 40%.  It  now  maintains \none of the least restrictive trade regimes in the region. \n \nPNG has also been an active member of World Customs Organization since 2002. It has \n36. \ncompleted the necessary legislative changes to implement practices and procedures based on \nglobal  standards  approved  by  the  World  Customs  Organization,  and  is  expected  to  accede  to \nthe Revised Kyoto Convention for the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures \nby 2009.  \n \n37. \nCurrently,  50%  of  cargo  receives  instant  customs  clearance,  40%  is  subject  to \ndocumentary  check,  and  10%  requires  some  form  of  physical  intervention  by  customs.  PNG \nCustoms  Service  is  pursuing  a  customs  modernization  strategic  action  plan  and  striving  to \nachieve an 80%\u201310%\u201310% split.  \n  \n\n3. \n\nADB Strategy \n\n38. \nPNG\u2019s  National  Strategic  Plan  2010\u20132050,  expected  to  be  approved  by  2009,  aims  to \nimprove PNG\u2019s strategic planning, institutions, and systems; develop manufacturing capability; \nand turn PNG into an attractive destination for business and investment. \n \n39. \nRegional cooperation and integration is one of the five core operational areas in ADB\u2019s \nlong-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020).12  The  Pacific  Regional  Operations \nBusiness  Plan,  2007\u20132010  identified  improving  trade  links  between  PNG  and  Indonesia  as \nanother avenue for contributing to economic growth and poverty reduction in PNG.13 \n \n40. \nA  review  of  the  constraints  and  opportunities  facing  WSP  indicates  that  WSP\u2019s \ndevelopment  prospects  lie  in  strengthening  economic  cooperation  with  Papua  Province  of \nIndonesia. Given the environmental, social, financial, and institutional constraints; the existence \nof the road connection between Jayapura, Vanimo, and Bewani; and the mutual desire of PNG \nand Papua government to expand trade, ADB\u2019s strategy is to assist PNG in improving the WSP \n                                                 \n11  National Economic and Fiscal Commission. 2008.

To  make  the  Project  manageable,  and  since  it  is \npremature  to  develop  border  management  systems,  the  Project  will  only  provide  the \ninfrastructure for the border and will not address border operations.  \n  \nAlthough  business  confidence  increased  during  project  preparation  (as  reflected  in  the \n41. \nbusiness  registration  in  WSP  in  2008),  ADB  recognizes  that  the  Project  alone  will  not  be \nsufficient to boost the development  of WSP. Border operations, access to capital for business \ndevelopment,  agreements  on  cross-border  transport,  and  other  infrastructure  needs  (such  as \npower and water) will also need to be addressed. Capacity development is a long-term task and \nrequires persistent efforts by ADB. The Project is the first initiative in ADB\u2019s series of efforts to \npromote  regionalism  between  PNG  and  Indonesia.  ADB  is  considering  extending  its \nmicrofinance project to WSP, and has planned a regional TA for approval in 2010. The scope of \nthe  TA  may  include  (i)  preparing  a  profile  of  goods  and  services  tradable  between  PNG  and \nIndonesia;  (ii)  assessing  benefits  from  forward  and  backward  linkages  of  cross-border  trade \nbetween PNG and Indonesia; (iii) developing an investment plan for cross-border transport and \ntrade infrastructure; (iv) strengthening the trade-related institutions and improving the efficiency \nof ports and customs; (v) developing a blueprint for harmonizing transport, trade, tariff policies \nand standards, and regulatory frameworks; and fostering private sector growth to increase trade \nflow;  and  (vi)  developing  human  resources  in  trade,  transport,  and  transit  facilitation.  ADB  is \nalso making efforts to catalyze development partners\u2019 assistance to provide water, power, and \neducation facilities in WSP.  \n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance  \n\nThe  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  is  the  most  significant \n42. \ndevelopment partner present in WSP. Its assistance focuses on maintaining national roads and \nstrengthening the capacity of provincial and local level governments in delivering basic services. \nThe  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  has  approved  $1  million  to  assist  the  PNG \nto  streamline \nInvestment  Promotion  Authority \ngovernment  approval  processes  and  procedures  for  businesses.  The  European  Commission \nhas  been  supporting  PNG  in  strengthening  capacity  for  trade-related  policy  formulation, \nanalysis,  administration,  and  negotiation;  and  integration  of  trade  aspects  into  PNG\u2019s \ndevelopment  and  sectoral  strategies  since  2007.  The  external  assistance  is  summarized  in \nAppendix 4.  \n \n\nits  Registration  Reform  Project \n\nthrough \n\n5. \n\nLessons  \n\n43. \nThe  Project  is  the  first  to  promote  development  of  a  poor  area  through  regional \ncooperation in PNG and in the Pacific. Experience from ADB-financed regional projects in the \nGreater Mekong Subregion and Central Asia was reviewed to draw lessons. Major lessons are: \n(i)  transport  corridors  may  not  necessarily  translate  into  economic  corridors  if  they  are  not \ncomplemented  by  the  policy  and  institutional  changes  that  enable  better  opportunities  for  the \nprivate  sector;  and  (ii)  project  design  needs  to  be  simplified  and  avoid  addressing  too  many \nissues. The design of the Project is straightforward; seeks partnership with other agencies and \nADB  initiatives;  and  has  taken  into  account  the  existence  of  the  northern  transport  corridor \nlinking Jayapura, Vanimo, and Bewani. The key for economic development along the corridor is \nto  remove  the  border  facility  bottleneck  to  permit  traffic  flow,  while  addressing  constraints  to \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nprivate  sector  investment  to  increase  PNG\u2019s  supply  responses  to  Indonesian  and  other \ninternational markets.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA. \n \n44. \nThe  Project  will  help  improve  the  business  environment  in  WSP  by  reducing  the \nbusiness  transaction  costs  associated  with  infrastructure,  compliance  with  government  rules \nand  regulations,  and  thin  human  capital.  It  aims  at  developing  WSP  into  a  dynamic  growth \ncenter for PNG, which can drive the development of the neighboring provinces including Manus, \nEast Sepik, Madang, and Morobe provinces.  \n \nB. \n \n45. \nThe  Project  consists  of  three  components:  (i)  construction and  refurbishment  of  border \nfacilities  at  Wutung,  (ii)  capacity  development,  and  (iii)  a  social  development  program.  It  will \nproduce  the  following  outputs:  (i)  border  facilities  including  customs,  immigration,  and \nquarantine  facilities;  resident  housing;  roads;  parking  lots;  and  public  convenience  facilities \n(such as food houses, bus shelter, market, and clinic); (ii) a one-stop service office under BDA \nfor promoting trade, investment, and tourism for WSP; (iii) a broadened human capital base with \n500  people  trained  in  commerce  and  trade;  and  (iv)  improved  human  development  in  the  five \nborder villages.  \n \n\n1. \n\nBorder Facilities \n\n \n46. \nThe existing border facilities, including an administration building and resident houses at \nWutung, are in a state of despair. The administration building has no reliable phone or internet \nconnection and is not equipped to handle any vehicle crossing. It is too small to accommodate \nthe  number  of  staff  required  to  provide  services  of  an  acceptable  standard.  There  are  no \nadequate storage, quarantine, security, and public convenience facilities. Infrastructure services \n(such  as  roads,  power,  and  water)  are  inadequate.  Border  officials  are  demoralized  because \nthey have been in difficult working and living conditions for years. The Project will construct or \nrefurbish\u2014with  electric,  mechanical,  and  hydraulic  services\u2014customs,  immigration,  and \nquarantine  facilities;  resident  housing;  roads;  parking  lots;  and  public  convenience  facilities \n(such as food houses, bus shelter, market, and clinic).  \n \n47. \nThe border facilities will be designed based on the Wutung (Physical Planning) Subject \nDevelopment Plan, 200014 and in accordance with international border crossing and processing \nstandards  and  practices.  The  design  will  take  trade  facilitation  into  account;  and  enables  the \nprocessing  of  passports,  immigration,  customs,  and  quarantine  formalities  to  be  carried  out \nunder single window procedures for commercial, noncommercial, and pedestrian traffic. \n \n\n2. \n\nCapacity Development \n\n \n48. \n The  institutional  capacity  assessment  (Appendix  5)  identifies  weaknesses  in  informal \nand  formal  rules,  organizations,  and  human  capacity  for  PNG,  which  are  dependent  on \nindividuals  to  improve  them.  The  Government  heavily  emphasizes  basic  education,  which  is \ngenerally  available  in  WSP  and  across  the  country.  People  in  WSP  are  demanding  technical, \n                                                 \n14 Sandaun Physical Planning Office. 2000. Wutung (Physical Planning) Subject Development Plan.

The \nProject  will  include  a  comprehensive  program  (i)  to  assist  the  Government\u2019s  policy  team  to \ndeliver the investment policy legislation, (ii) to develop entrepreneurship and business skills for \npeople in WSP to enable them to participate in the development process and take advantage of \nthe opportunities opened up by the Project, and (iii) to develop human resources in the areas of \ntrade  and  investment  promotion,  business  administration,  financial  management,  information \ntechnology,  and \ninclude \n(i) overseas  study  tours  for  the  Government\u2019s  policy  team  to  acquire  exposure  to  regional \nexperience  in  trade  and  investment  promotion  and  cross-border  cooperation;  (ii)  short-term \npolicy  advisory  services  from  prestigious  government  and  business  leaders;  (iii)  in-country \nworkshops;  (iv)  short-term  business  skills  and  financial  management  training;  (v)  3\u20136  month \ninformation technology training; (vi) 6\u201312 month scholarship programs in Indonesia for mid-level \ngovernment officials and local business people; and (vii) degree study in information technology, \nbusiness  administration,  trade,  and  commerce  for  junior  government  officials  and  new \ngraduates. At least 30% of the trainees should be women and 50% should be from WSP. The \ncapacity  development  programs  will  be  designed,  in  a  consultative  manner,  by  the  training \nspecialist and investment policy strategist financed under the Project and a TA grant attached to \nthe Project.  \n \n\nfor  PNG.  Possible \n\ninitiatives \n\n3. \n\nSocial Development Program \n\n \n49. \nTo  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  social  policies;  mitigate  social  conflicts  and  disputes  over  land \ntitles,  concession  fees,  and  compensation;  and  extend  project  benefits  to  border  villages,  a \nsocial development program was prepared based on needs prioritized by villagers. The program \n(Supplementary  Appendix  A)  comprises  five  interventions:  (i) power  connection  for  Wutung \nvillage,  (ii)  construction  of  septic  tanks  and  individual  household  toilets  for  Wutung  village, \n(iii) safe motherhood for five West Coast villages, (iv) education support for at-risk children, and \n(v) HIV/AIDS  prevention.  Implementation  of  items  (i)  to  (iv)  will  be  carried  out  using  modified \nconditional cash transfer (MCCT), by which outputs will have to be delivered and verified before \ncash is paid from the Project. MCCT is appropriate because education and health services are \navailable to and accessible by the target villages, there is a willingness to pay, and MCCT is an \neffective way to minimize leakages and misuse of funds.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n \n1. \n\nRegional Cooperation \n\n \n50. \nADB\u2019s experience in the Greater Mekong Subregion indicates that neighboring countries \nworking together can enhance political trust, expand markets and economies of scale, generate \ngrowth  and  employment  opportunities,  and  brighten  development  prospects  for  all  involved. \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  identified  regional  cooperation  as  one  of  the  core  operational  areas  for \nADB assistance to free Asia and the Pacific from poverty. \n \n51. \nThe Project is the first to assist one of the least developed provinces in PNG to benefit \nfrom  the  dynamic  economic  development  of  Asia.  It  has  the  potential  to  build  an  economic \ncorridor  and  business  growth  centers  for  PNG,  which  will  lead  to  the  development  of  not  just \nWSP,  but  the  neighboring  provinces\u2014including  Manus,  East  Sepik,  Madang,  and  Morobe \nprovinces.  Trading  with  Indonesia  has  already  brought  benefits  to  the  border  villages.  The \nsample  survey  conducted  under  the  ADB  project  preparatory  TA  reports  that  border  villagers \nhave an average monthly income of K1,000 per household, which is higher than Vanimo urban \narea (K800 per household monthly). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nPartnership and Project Complementarity  \n\nthe  European  Commission,  and \n\nIn the process of preparing the Project, close coordination and consultations with major \n52. \ndevelopment  partners\u2014including  AusAID, \nIFC\u2014were \nconducted to join efforts, ensure complementarity, and maximize the comparative advantages of \neach organization. AusAID has the most significant presence in WSP. Since 2007, it has been \nassisting WSP in strengthening its administrative capacity for basic service delivery; maintaining \nthe critical national roads, including the road from Vanimo to the border; and fighting HIV/AIDS. \nIFC  is  implementing  the  Regulatory  Reform  Project\u2014addressing  business  indicators  such  as \nwork  permits,  starting  a  business,  licensing  and  registration,  enforcing  contracts,  tax \ncompliance, property registration, and investment policy; and is contemplating a national model \nfor  a  special  economic  zone.  The  European  Commission  is  assisting  in  capacity  development \nfor trade-related policy formulation, analysis, administration, and negotiation.  \n \n53. \nThe  Project  will  complement  AusAID  and  government  efforts  in  developing  WSP.  Its \npolicy development will focus on deliberate investment and telecommunication policies for WSP, \ntaking into account other development partners' activities in the same area.  \n \n54. \nThe Project may also catalyze assistance from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to \nprovide basic infrastructure in WSP such as water supply, power, and Sandaun learning center. \nWSP is preparing the project proposals and intends to seek PRC financing for them through the \nnational Government.  \n  \n\n3. \n\nPolicy Dialogue with the Government \n\n \n55. \nADB\u2019s policy dialogue with the Government focuses on (i) the development strategy for \nWSP and the design of the border facilities, (ii) the importance of deliberate investment policies \nfor WSP, and (iii) partnership between BDA and West Sepik Provincial Administration (WSPA) \nin  project  management.  The  Government  is  contemplating  a  blueprint  for  WSP  aimed  at \nopening up Lumi and building Bewani into a gateway to Indonesia. ADB considers Vanimo to be \nin the most advantageous position to develop first because of its convenient geographic coastal \nlocation,  and  proximity  and  road  connection  to  Jayapura\u2014the  location  of  Papua  Province\u2019s \nmajor  population  and  economic  activities.  The  Government\u2019s  intention  to  build  up  facilities  at \nWutung has been always clear. Two pieces of land were acquired for the Wutung border post in \n1965 and in 2003. Discussions with Indonesia on the official opening of the Wutung border have \nbeen  ongoing  since  2006.  Abided  by  PNG\u2019s  construction  standards,  the  design  life  of  the \nfacilities  is  50  years.  Unless  it  is  believed  that  WSP  will  not  progress  in  terms  of  economic \ndevelopment,  the  design  of  the  facilities  needs  to  be  forward-looking  to  save  costs  to  the \nGovernment.  The  restrictiveness  of  the  land  available  for  the  Wutung  border  development  as \nwell  as  the  land  problems  and  high  costs  of  goods  and  services  in  PNG  also  favor  a  design \ntaking into account future development trends.  \n\n56.  While  infrastructure  is  essential  for  economic  growth,  the  importance  of  the  regulatory \nframework and policies conducive to investment, trade, and private sector development cannot \nbe overemphasized. PNG maintains one of the least restrictive trade regimes in the region, but \nits investment environment is not competitive to add value to its primary goods, increase gains \nfrom global trade, create jobs for its growing population, and move PNG into a nation of wealth.  \n \nConstraints  on  investment  exist  at  both  national  and  provincial  levels.  While  there  is  a \n57. \nshortage  of  staff,  skills,  and  funding  across  almost  all  government  offices,  government \napprovals, licensing, and procedural requirements with respect to investment are numerous and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\ncomplex. In addition, foreign investors are mandated to bear the costs of knowledge transfer. It \nneeds to be realized that knowledge is not transferred, but acquired. Education is the ultimate \nway to create a skillful labor force.  \n \nGiven  the  development  challenges  faced  by  WSP,  deliberate  policies  are  required  to \n58. \nincrease its attractiveness as a destination for private investment. Public resources are always \nlimited,  given  the  competing  needs  of  the  country.  The  private  sector  has  great  potential  to \nsupplement if an enabling environment is provided. The Department of Commerce and Industry \n(DCI) has agreed to mobilize a policy team to develop investment policy legislation for WSP.  \n \n59. \nThe success of the Project depends on the quality of the project management, and it is \nin  the  interest  of  both  BDA  and  WSPA  to  ensure  project  success.  BDA  was  established  in \nOctober  2008  and  is  in  need  of  reliable  and  capable  staff  that  WSPA  can  provide.  If  BDA\u2019s \nprovincial management office (PMO) in WSP is composed of qualified staff from WSPA, it will \nnot  only  save  costs  for  BDA,  but  also  benefit  project  implementation  as  this  staff  is  already \nestablished in WSP and has local knowledge. WSPA agreed to join efforts with BDA and make \nits staff available as needed, particularly the provincial manager, a financial officer, and a female \ncommunity relations officer.  \n \n\n4. \n\nPublic Consultations \n\n \n60. \nDuring  project  preparation,  extensive  consultations  at  national,  provincial,  district,  and \nvillage levels were conducted to design the project concept, border facilities, social development \nprogram, and implementation arrangements; and assess the socioeconomic and environmental \nimpacts  of  the  Project.  The  consultations  were  conducted  in  the  form  of  (i) regular  project \nsteering  committee  meetings;  (ii)  meetings  and  discussions  with  relevant  national  government \nagencies; (iii) key informant interviews at provincial, district, and village levels; (iv) focus group \ndiscussions;  (v)  sample  surveys;  and  (vi)  a  workshop.  More  than  12  national  and  local \ngovernment agencies and 600 stakeholders were consulted. The insights obtained through the \nconsultations  have  been  incorporated  into  all  areas  of  the  Project  including  the  project \ncomponents, design of the border facilities, poverty reduction and social strategy, procurement, \nand consulting services. The public consultations are detailed in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n\n5. \n\nFinancial Management \n\nA \n\n \n61. \nfinancial  management  assessment  of  BDA  was  carried  out  (Supplementary \nAppendix C).  BDA  was  established  in  October  2008  and  has  been  allocated  a  K40  million \ndevelopment  budget,  including  K15  million  for  Wutung  border  development.  Of  its  proposed \n150 staff  positions,  15  are  financial  positions.  An  internal  audit  unit  is  also  proposed.  The \ndirector  for  finance,  with  accounting  qualifications  and  experience  with  development  partners-\nfinanced (except ADB) projects, has been appointed. The certifying officer, accounts and payroll \nofficer,  and  claim  registration  officer  have  also  been  appointed.  The  position  of  financial \nmanager is still vacant. BDA has installed the Attach\u00e9 accounting system and is only using it for \npayroll purposes.  \n \n62. \nIn 2008, ADB carried out a country financial management assessment to consider a loan \nto  the  road  sector.  The  country-level  issues  identified  include  (i)  weak  accounting,  recording, \nand  reporting;  (ii)  shortage  of  skills  in  financial  management  and  management  accounting; \n(iii) delays  in  the  submission  of  audited  annual  project  accounts;  and  (iv)  difficulty  in \nsubstantiating and liquidating the imprest accounts. \n \n\n \n\n\fThe Project, through the TA grant, will assist BDA in (i) refining its accounting principles, \n63. \npolicies, and procedures; (ii) developing budgeting, accounting, and financial management and \ncontrol  systems  in  BDA  and  its  PMO  in  Vanimo  to  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and \nfinancial statements to identify goods and services financed by various sources including ADB, \nBDA,  and  other  financiers;  (iii)  developing  controls  and  procedures  for  the  flow  of  funds, \nfinancial  information,  accountability,  and  audits  in  relation  to  BDA\u2019s  provincial  offices; \n(iv) developing a financial management reporting system; (v) evaluating the financial aspects of \nthe  bids  for  civil  works;  (vi)  maintaining  records,  accounts,  and  supporting  documents;  and \nliquidating imprest account; and (vii) ensuring the smooth financial operation of the Project.  \n  \n\n6. \n\nModified Conditional Cash Transfer \n\n \nThe social development program of the Project (except the HIV/AIDS component) will be \n64. \nimplemented using MCCT\u2014the first time under an ADB project in the Pacific. MCCT originates \nfrom  conditional  cash  transfer  (CCT),  which  transfers  cash  in  advance  to  poor  families  under \ncertain conditions or promises, e.g., sending children to school. CCT has become increasingly \npopular in the past few years as a development tool in Latin America and elsewhere. However, \nin  the  Pacific\u2014where  fund  fungibility  is  likely  to  mean  fund  misuse,  and  monitoring  and  self-\ncompliance are problematic\u2014conventional CCT is unlikely to lead to development outcomes.  \n \nThe  innovativeness  of  MCCT  is  that  it  uses  PNG\u2019s  clan  system  to  carry  out  the \n65. \nintervention  activities  and  transfers  cash  only  to  the  female  head  or  a  female  adult  of  a \nhousehold upon verification of completion of the activities. This modification takes into account \nthe weak institutions and poor record of community-based development projects in the Pacific, \nand  the  local  custom  that  relatives,  friends,  and  neighbors  often  pool  resources  together  for \nhousehold  projects.  Other  advantages  are  (i)  direct  benefits  to  households;  (ii)  delivery  of \nintervention  outputs  before  fund  disbursement;  (iii)  strong  ownership  by  communities  and \nhouseholds; (iv) minimization of capture, leakage, and noncompliance; and (v) less pressure on \nBDA\u2019s  capacity.  MCCT  has  potential  for  WSP  to  replicate  delivery  of  its  basic  social  services \nusing the national Government\u2019s functional grants. \n \nD. \n \n66. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $30  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \n$2.33  million,  which  will  be  partly  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds.  The  costs  of  different \ncomponents are summarized in Table 1 and detailed in Appendix 6. \n\nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\nItem \n\nA. \n \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \nD. \n\nE. \n \n \n \n\n \nBase Cost a \n1.

For local currency costs, 3% in 2010 and \nonwards.  \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n \n67. \nThe Government has requested ADB to provide a loan in various currencies equivalent \nto  $25  million  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF).  The  ADF  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of \n32 years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  charge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the \ngrace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  equal  amortization,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions to be set forth in the draft ADF loan agreement. \n \n \n68. \nADB  will  finance  83%  of  the  total  project  cost  including  taxes  and  duties,  while  the \nGovernment will provide $5 million equivalent to finance the remaining cost. The financing plan \nis presented in Appendix 6 and summarized in Table 2. \n \n\n  \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount \n($ million) \n25.00 \n  5.00 \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n30.00 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n83.00 \n17.00 \n\n100.00 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n \n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \nBDA will be the Executing Agency.  Of 150 positions, it has staffed 28 positions and set \n69. \nup a core engineering group in the head office. BDA will source staff from WSPA and establish \nand  maintain  a  fully  staffed  and  adequately  funded  PMO  at  Vanimo,  initially  comprising  the \nprovincial  manager,  civil  engineers  or  architects,  an  accountant,  and  a  female  community \nrelations  officer;  and  gradually  including  investment  and  tourism  promotion  officers.  The \nprovincial manager will report to the general manager. BDA and its PMO will (i) prepare bidding \ndocuments  for  civil  works  and  equipment  and  handle  the  bidding,  (ii)  manage  the  contracts, \n(iii) develop  annual \nin  WSP, \n(v) implement  the  social  development  program,  (vi)  monitor  the  progress  of  the  Project, \n(vii) prepare  applications  for  fund  withdrawals,  (viii)  prepare  the  project  progress  reports  and \nproject completion report, (ix) maintain project accounts and financial records for auditing, and \n(x) monitor the socioeconomic impact of the Project. \n  \n70. \nsubcomponent to prevent the spread of the disease.  \n \n\n \nBDA  will  engage  Volunteer  Service  Overseas  (VSO)  to  carry  out  the  HIV/AIDS \n\ntraining  programs,  (iv)  promote \n\ninvestment  and \n\ntourism \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n71. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  8  years.  Most  activities,  such  as  construction  of \nborder facilities and the social development program, should be completed by 2014. Equipment \npurchase and capacity development will continue until 2017. The implementation schedule is in \nAppendix 7.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement  \n\n \n72. \nBDA\u2019s procurement capacity was assessed (Supplementary Appendix D). Although the \nengineering group consisting of staff with degrees in civil engineering and architecture has been \nestablished,  and  one  senior  staff  member  has  experience  with  supervision  of  ADB-financed \ncontracts,  none  of  the  staff  has  experience  with  procurement  following  ADB\u2019s  procurement \nrules. The TA will provide resources to strengthen BDA\u2019s procurement capacity.  \n \nThe procurement will mainly consist of civil works and equipment for border facilities. All \n73. \nprocurement  to  be  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Constrained  by  the  land \navailability  for  the  contractors,  civil  works  will  be  divided  into  two  packages  and  will  follow \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  single-stage,  one-envelope  procedures,  as  the  cost \nestimates  of  both  contracts  exceed  $3  million\u2014the  ICB  threshold  for  PNG.  Equipment  is \ngrouped  into  eight  packages.  ICB  will  be  followed  for  contracts  estimated  above  $500,000. \nContracts below $100,000 will follow shopping procedures. National competitive bidding will be \nused for contracts between $100,000 and $500,000. The procurement plan is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n    \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n4. \n\n \n74. \nInternational and national consulting services will be required for (i) support to BDA and \nthe  PMO  in  the  areas  of  contract  management,  investment  and  tourism  promotion,  capacity \ndevelopment,  and  socioeconomic  monitoring;  (ii)  construction  supervision  and  environment \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nmonitoring; and (iii) HIV/AIDS prevention. The Project will fund a total of 350 person-months of \nconsulting services (128 international, 222 national).  \n \n75. \nAll consulting services will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Individual consultants and international or \nnational  business  volunteers  will  be  engaged  to  provide  services  required  under  area  (i) \nbecause  of  the  diverse  expertise  required  and  the  effectiveness  of  business  volunteers  in \nproviding  services.  An  international  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  based  on  the  quality  and \ncost-based selection method with a quality and cost weighting of 80:20 to provide construction \nsupervision.  HIV/AIDS  prevention  will  engage  VSO\u2019s  services  through  single-source  selection. \nSingle-source  selection  is  justified  because  VSO  is  the  only  reputable  nongovernment \norganization  active  in  WSP  fighting  HIV/AIDS.  BDA  has  requested  ADB  to  perform  the \nconsultant  selection  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  to  expedite  the  Project.  The  plan  for \nconsulting services is in Appendix 8. The outline terms of reference for implementation support \nand  construction  supervision  are  in  Supplementary  Appendixes  E  and  F.  The  HIV/AIDS \nprogram is described in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n76. \nThe border facilities are a matter of urgency for the Government, as the official opening \nof the border has been under consideration for several years. The Government requested ADB \napproval  of  advance  action  for  recruitment  of  consulting  services  for  investment  and  tourism \npromotion and capacity development, and procurement of two civil works packages for border \nfacilities  and  a  patrol  boat.  Advance  action  covers  invitations  for  bids,  bidding,  bid  evaluation, \nand limited contract awards. The advance action will be supported by the TA and undertaken in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the advance action, if granted, does not commit \nADB to finance the Project. \n \n77. \nTo facilitate project implementation, the Project will provide retroactive financing to meet \nthe costs of the consulting services and civil works. The retroactive financing will be applicable \nfor  expenditures  incurred  no  earlier  than  12  months  prior  to  the  date  of  the  Loan  Agreement. \nThe Government has been informed that the amount of retroactive financing must not exceed \n20% of the ADB loan amount and that approval of retroactive financing does not commit ADB to \nfinance the Project.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nimplementation.  Consistent  with \n\n \n78. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government and BDA. The Government and BDA shall adhere to ADB anticorruption \nto  good \nrequirements  during  project \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  BDA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  If  ADB  determines  that \nrepresentatives of the Borrower, a beneficiary, a contractor, and/or a consultant are engaged in \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices,  ADB  may  take  the  following  actions: \n\nits  commitment \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) reject any proposal for contract award, and/or (ii) declare any firm or individual ineligible for \nADB-financed contracts, indefinitely or for a stated period of time. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n79. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The disbursement procedures \nwill  include  direct  payments,  imprest  account,  and  reimbursements.  BDA  will  establish  an \nimprest account with either the central bank or a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. It will use \nthe  imprest  account  exclusively  to  finance  eligible  expenditures  as  specified  in  the  Loan \nAgreement.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  either \n6 months  of  estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed  from  the  imprest  account  or  $500,000, \nwhichever is less. For civil works and consulting services, direct payment or reimbursement will \nbe used.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n80. \nBDA and its PMO will maintain separate accounts for the Project and prepare separate \nfinancial  statements  indicating  the  sources  and  uses  of  funds,  and  have  them  audited  by  an \nindependent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  project  accounts,  BDA\u2019s  corporate \naccounts, and the respective auditors\u2019 reports\u2014which should include separate audit opinions on \nthe use of the imprest account for the loan, compliance with the financial covenants of the Loan \nAgreement, and BDA\u2019s internal financial control\u2014will be submitted to ADB within 6 months after \nthe  end  of  each  fiscal  year.  BDA  will  also  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  monthly  and  quarterly \nproject  progress  reports  and  a  project  completion  report  within  3  months  of  completion  of  the \nProject. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n81. \nBDA  will monitor the project performance and  assess the socioeconomic impact  of the \nProject  in  accordance  with  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  of  the  Project.  It  will  be \nassisted by 8 person-months of international consulting services. Since the baseline data have \nbeen  provided  under  the  project  preparatory  TA,  the  international  consultant  will  commence \nwork  1  year  after  the  Project  starts,  and  carry  out  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  exercise \nannually for 8 years. \n \n\nIV.  \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n\n82. \nA TA grant will be attached to the Project to (i) assist DCI in developing the investment \npolicy legislation and telecommunication strategy for WSP, and (ii) assist BDA in procuring civil \nworks for border facilities and managing the financial aspect of the Project. The objectives of the \nTA are (i) to assist in catalyzing investment in WSP and increasing the supply of PNG products \nin  demand  by  helping  the  Government  to  prepare  specific  investment  policies  and  a \ntelecommunication  solution  for  WSP,  both  of  which  are  critical  to  reduce  business  transaction \ncosts  and  increase  the  attractiveness  of  WSP  as  a  destination  for  investment;  and  (ii)  to \nfacilitate project implementation. The terms of reference are in Appendix 9. \n \n83. \nCost  and  financing.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.06  million  equivalent.  The \nGovernment has requested ADB to provide $900,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).  The  Government  will \nprovide  $160,000  equivalent  to  finance  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation  and  support \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nservices,  local  communication  and  transport,  and  other  services  and  facilities  required  for \nimplementation of the TA. \n \n84. \nImplementation arrangements. DCI will be the Executing Agency for investment policy \nlegislation and telecommunication strategy development, and BDA will be the Executing Agency \nfor BDA capacity development. DCI will mobilize an interdepartmental policy team to study and \ndevelop  the  investment  policy  legislation  and  telecommunication  solution  for  WSP,  comprising \nsenior  representatives  from  the  departments  of  national  planning  and  monitoring,  treasury, \nforeign  affairs  and  immigration,  communication  and  information,  provincial  and  local  level \ngovernment  affairs,  and  labor  and  industrial  relations;  National  Lands  Commission;  Internal \nRevenue  Commission;  PNG  Customs  Service;  Investment  Promotion  Authority;  BDA;  WSPA; \nand other relevant government offices.  \n \n85. \nThe  TA  will  require  a  total  of  38  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  to \ncarry out the scope of the study as defined in the outline terms of reference in Appendix 9. The \nareas  of  expertise  required \ntelecommunication, \nprocurement, and financial management. The TA will be implemented from 2010 to 2014.  \n \n86. \nThe TA will be carried out by both individual consultants as well as consultants from an \ninternational  firm.  Individual  consultants  will  be  engaged  for  the  development  of  investment \npolicy  legislation  and  telecommunication  strategy  and  procurement,  while  an  international \naccounting  firm  will  be  selected  to  provide  individual  consultants  to  assist  BDA  in  financial \nmanagement.  This is  because  required  expertise  is  diverse,  and  it  will be  difficult  for  a  firm  to \nprovide  quality  consultants  for  all  areas.  However,  a  reputable  accounting  firm  will  be  more \nreliable  and  less  risky  than  individual  financial  consultants  to  provide  financial  management \nservices. The consultant recruitment will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. \n \n\ninvestment  policy \n\nformulation, \n\ninclude \n\nV.  \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nA. \n \nThe  economic  analysis  (Appendix  10)  of  the  Project  compares  the  \u201cwith-project\u201d  and \n87. \n\u201cwithout-project\u201d scenarios. The assessment covers the period from 2010 to 2034 and assumes \nthe  implementation  schedule  in  Appendix  7  is  followed.  All  benefits  and  costs  are  in  constant \n2009 prices. Economic benefits such as business efficiency, job creation, skill development, and \nreduction  in  income  differential  between  towns  far  from  the  border  and  towns  neighboring  the \nborder, which are difficult to quantify, are excluded from the analysis.  \n \n88. \nThe  economic  costs  of  the  Project  consist  of  (i)  capital  costs,  including  labor,  material, \nequipment,  consulting  services,  and  physical  contingency;  and  (ii)  maintenance  costs.  The \neconomic cost of land is not included because there is no incremental cost between with- and \nwithout-project  scenarios,  as  the  land  has  been  allocated  for  border  development.  The  major \neconomic  benefit  arises  from  the  reduction  in  trade  transaction  costs,  resulting  in  increased \ngovernment  revenue,  producer  surplus,  and  consumer  surplus  from  increases  in  imports  and \nexports. Other economic benefits include saving in household income on waterborne diseases, \nand income gains from extended life expectancy and education. \n \nDiscounted at  a  rate  of 12%,  the  Project is  economically  viable.  The  net  present  value \n89. \n(NPV) of the Project is K5.52 million and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 14.05%. \nThe calculation was subject to sensitivity analysis, which tests the effects of negative changes in \n\n \n\n\fProject Sustainability \n\nthe key parameters that determine the benefits and costs of the Project. The sensitivity analysis \nshows  that  the  Project  remains  economically  viable  in  spite  of  a  10%  increase  in  costs  or \n10% reduction  in  benefits.  In  the  worst  case  scenario,  where  the  Project  suffers  from  both  a \n10% reduction in economic benefits and a 10% increase in economic costs, the Project provides \nan EIRR of 10.95%. \n \nB. \n \nPNG currently enjoys a comfortable debt position. By 2008, PNG\u2019s public debt stood at \n90. \n31.6%  of  gross  domestic  product,  and  its  external  debt  at  13%\u2014low  in  comparison  with  the \nInternational Monetary Fund\u2019s 30% threshold. The Project will have minimum impact on PNG\u2019s \ndebt position, given its long term of repayment.  \n \n91. \nThe  annual  average  recurrent  cost  of  the  border  facilities  is  around  K350,000, \naccounting  for  about  0.9%  of  BDA\u2019s  current  development  budget  allocation  of  K40  million. \nBDA\u2019s  operations  are  fully  funded  by  the  Government.  The  Project  will  be  sustainable  if  the \nGovernment  remains  committed  to  the  development  of  its  border  provinces  and  continues  to \nmake  efforts  to  unleash  the  potential  of  the  private  sector  by  improving  its  policy  environment \nand  administrative  efficiency.  Infrastructure  alone  will  not  be  sufficient  to  generate  economic \nactivities.  Political  will  and  policies  are  more  powerful  to  achieve  development  breakthroughs, \nincluding infrastructure.  \n \nC. \n \n\nProject Impact \n\n1. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement and Indigenous People \n\n \n92. \nThe Project has been classified category C for involuntary resettlement. The two pieces \nof land for the border facilities were acquired in 1965 and 2003, and have been cleared before. \nThe Project will not cause loss of housing, strips of land, crops, trees, or other fixed assets.  \n \n93. \nFor indigenous people, the Project is categorized category B and is required to develop \na  specific  action  for  Wutung  villagers  who  are  the  traditional  landowners  of  the  two  pieces  of \nland  acquired  for  the  border  facilities.  A  series  of  consultations,  interviews,  and  focus  group \ndiscussions and a socioeconomic survey for 85% of households in Wutung village were carried \nout to identify people\u2019s concerns and development priorities, and design the border facilities and \nan intervention program. \n \n94. \nThe  border  facilities  will  include  public  phones,  market  areas,  and  a  clinic.  A  social \nprogram  (Supplementary  Appendix  A)  was  developed  to  provide  access  to  power,  build  their \nown toilets, support pregnant women to undergo regular medical check-ups, and keep \u201cat-risk\u201d \nchildren in schools. The total cost was estimated to be around $270,000 and is budgeted under \nthe Project.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impact \n\n \n95. \nIn terms of both income and non-income poverty, WSP is one of the worst provinces in \nPNG.  Yet  WSP  has  an  opportunity  to  develop  if  it  can  manage  to  strengthen  its  economic \nlinkage with Asia and maximize the benefits. The benefits of trade with Indonesia have already \nbeen manifested in border villages where villagers are earning higher incomes than in the rest \nof  the  province.  In  addition  to  income,  exposure  to  Indonesians\u2019  way  of  doing  business  and \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nliving  standards  has  generated  a  desire  to  learn  and  catch  up,  and  a  demand  for  healthy \nlifestyles.  \n \n96. \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  WSP  by  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  investment  to  stimulate  economic  activities  in  the  province.  With  investment, \nparticularly  in  agriculture  and  tourism,  more  people  will  be  absorbed  into  modern  sector  and \nhave better access to social services. The investment and capacity development components of \nthe  Project  will  generate  employment  of  more  than  200  people.  The  spillover  benefits  to  the \nservice sector are difficult to predict, but will be significant. \n \n97. \nThe  social  development  program  of  the  Project  will  directly  alleviate  the  non-income \npoverty of five border villages. The availability of power and sanitation facilities, improved infant \nand  maternal  health,  and  education  for  children  will  not  only  improve  their  current  living \nstandards,  but  also  pave  the  way  for  future  generations  to  be  free  from  poverty.  The  social \ndevelopment  program  has  the  potential  to  be  an  alternative  for  WSP  to  improve  the \neffectiveness of its service delivery using the national grants.  \n \n\n \n3. \n\nSocial and Gender Impact \n\n \n98. \nDuring  project  preparation,  the  potential  social  and  gender  impact  of  the  Project  was \nanalyzed  through  field  consultations,  key  informant  interviews,  focus  group  discussions,  and \nsample  surveys.  These  consultations  were  complemented  by  consultations  with  government \nagencies,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  faith-based  groups\u2013including  the  National  AIDS \nCouncil, Department of Health,  Sandaun Provincial AIDS Council, provincial health, education, \ncommerce  and  trade,  forestry,  and  agricultural  divisions;  Vanimo  Green  District;  Wards; \nSandaun  Provincial  Council  of  Women;  and  the  Catholic  Diocese  of  Vanimo.  More  than \n100 women  were  consulted.  The  consultations  reveal  that  people  appreciate  the  income \nopportunities provided by the border. They are concerned about the social service delivery and \nopening of the border without proper infrastructure and systems in place to protect PNG people \nfrom  diseases,  HIV/AIDS,  and  illegal  activities.  The  design  principle  for  the  border  facilities, \npurchase  of  equipment,  and  the  social  development  program  have  factored  in  their  concerns. \nFor instance, the border facilities will include closed circuit television for security monitoring and \na  clinic,  which  will  be  operationalized  by  VSO  for  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  other  medical \nservices to the villagers. A marine patrol boat has been included under the Project to strengthen \nPNG Customs Service\u2019 law-enforcing capabilities in the northern coast.  \n \n99.  Women  and  vulnerable  groups  are  not  disproportionately  affected  by  the  Project. \nWomen may be more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS than men because of their low social status and \nviolence  against  women.  To  promote  gender  and  social  equity,  the  Project  includes \ninterventions for women and vulnerable groups as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nproviding  training  programs  to  women  to  develop  their  entrepreneurship  and \nbusiness skills; \nproviding financial assistance to pregnant women for regular medical check-ups \nand reducing infant and maternal deaths; \ntransferring  cash  to  the  female  head  or  a  female  adult  of  a  household  upon \ncompletion of the relevant intervention activities; \ninvolving local women\u2019s groups in the verification process for MCCT; and  \ntargeting young women for HIV/AIDS education.  \n\n100.  The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\n \n101.  The  Project  has  been  categorized  environment  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). The construction \nof  border  facilities  will  take  place  on  land  previously  cleared.  Sanitation  facilities  in  Wutung \nvillage  will  be  constructed  within  the  village  compound.  An  initial  environmental  examination \nreport, environmental management plan, and environmental management and monitoring plan \nhave  been  prepared.  A  summary  initial  environmental  examination  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix H. \n \n102.  Consultations  were  held  with  all  relevant  public  sector,  private  sector,  and  community \norganizations in the project area. There was universal support for the Project and open debate \non  its  environmental  risks  and  benefits.  Consultations  informed  changes  to  the  project  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, and the environmental management and monitoring plan. \n \n103.  The  project area  does  not  include  any  protected  areas  or  areas  of  conservation  value. \nThe  Project  will  not  create  any  impact  on  cultural  or  heritage  sites.  Major  environmental  risks \ninclude  the  removal  of  asbestos  during  site  preparation  and  the  appropriate  design  of  septic \ntanks in Wutung village where the groundwater is as low as 1 meter below the surface.  \n \n104.  As summarized in the environmental management and monitoring plan, which will form \npart of the construction contract, the mitigation measures to address the environmental impacts \nare  appropriate  and  comprehensive.  Environmental  management  and  monitoring  will  be \nundertaken  by  BDA  with  support  from  the  construction  supervisors.  No  further  environmental \nstudy is required. \n \nD. \n \n105.  The Project may face the following risks: \n\nProject Risks and Mitigation Measures \n\nProcurement.  All  procurement  financed  under  the  loan  will  follow  ADB \nguidelines, with which BDA is not familiar. Similar to other ADB projects in PNG, \nprocurement  of  civil  works  will  be  hampered  by  lack  of  qualified  contractors.  In \naddition,  BDA  will  have  to  deal  with  the  Government\u2019s  lengthy  process  for \ncontract approval. \nFinancial  management.  Financial  discipline \nSafeguarding financial integrity will be a challenge for BDA.  \n\nis  generally  weak \n\nin  PNG. \n\n \n106.  The Project includes the following mitigation measures: \n\nproviding procurement and financial consultants through the TA to assist BDA in \nfinalizing the bidding documents and evaluating bids, and providing international \nand  national  consulting  services  under  the  loan  to  assist  BDA  in  managing  the \nProject;  \nengaging  a  reputable  accounting  firm  through  the  TA  to  provide  long-term \nservices to BDA, assisting in financial management;  \nusing MCCT to carry out the social development program to minimize demand on \nBDA\u2019s capacity as well as capture, leakages, and noncompliance; and \nassisting  BDA  staff  in  joining  ADB  training  programs  on  procurement,  financial \nmanagement, anticorruption, disbursement, and project management.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\n \n107. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  BDA  have  given  the \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nthe  audited  project \n\nGovernance  and  anticorruption.

It has three broadly \ndefined zones: the high mountainous region to the south, Sepik basin in the center, and the low \ncoastal  region  to  the  north.  Its  four  districts  (Aitape-Lumi,  Nuku,  Vanimo-Green  River,  and \nTelefomin)  are  generally  mountainous,  while  the  coastal  areas  of  Vanimo-Green  River  and  a \nlarger  part  of  Aitape-Lumi  are  relatively  flat  with  undulating  hills  and  swampland.  Limestone \nkarst dominates highland areas, with a large number of caves. \n \nThe 2000 National Census showed that the province had a total population of 185,741, \n2. \nof which 95,523 were males and 90,218 females, indicating a ratio of 106 males to 100 females. \nThe population density was 5 persons per square kilometer, with an average household size of \n5.5  persons.  The  average  population  growth  rate  in  the  province  has  been  2.4%  since  1980. \nYouth under the age of 15 constituted about 44% of the total population.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nlevel government.

The  provincial  executive  council  and  provincial  assembly  make  decisions \nrelating to policy, budget, and project development.  \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe  provincial  administration  is  responsible  for  service  delivery  in  the  province.  It \nconsists  of  two  levels  of  administration.  The  first  level  is  the  provincial  headquarters \nadministration, and the second level comprises the four district administrations. The current staff \nceiling  for  the  provincial  administration  is  435.  Of  these,  106  positions  are  based  at  the \nprovincial headquarters while 329 positions are distributed between the four districts and local \nlevel  governments  throughout  the  province.  There  are  over  800  teachers  working  in  the \nprovince.

There are 66 sole proprietorship \nbusinesses,  25  cooperatives,  19  corporations,  40  storekeepers  (17  female  and  23  male),  and \n160  peddlers  (72  female  and  88  male)  registered  in  Vanimo.  Nine corporations  and  15  sole \nproprietorships were registered in 2008\u20132009. Not all businesses are registered in the provincial \nbusiness registry since their main companies are registered elsewhere in PNG. Most registered \nbusinesses are in agroforestry activities, construction, maintenance, wholesale, and retail.  \n\nDevelopment Challenges and Opportunities \n\nF. \n \nInfrastructure.  The  province  is  linked  with  the  rest  of  PNG  by  air  flights  and  coastal \n8. \nshipping,  but  not  by  roads.  Internally,  the  four  districts  are  not  interconnected  by  roads,  and \ntravel  is  only  possible  by  air.  Airfares  are  prohibitively  expensive\u2014a  round-trip  from \nPort Moresby (national capital) to Vanimo (provincial capital) costs about K1,600. There is only \none ship carrying goods such as rice, building materials, and vehicles from Lae or Madang to \nVanimo twice a month. Two passenger ships operate weekly between Madang, Wewak, Aitape, \nand  Vaimo.  The  ships  sometimes  break  down,  leading  to  the  stores  running  out  of  essential \nhousehold goods, particularly salt and meat.  \n \n9. \nPower supply is only available to urban communities. Power interruptions are frequent. \nMost establishments and offices have a backup power generator in place. Telecommunication \nservices  are  unreliable  and  costly.  Internet  service  provided  on  fixed  lines  is  very  slow  and \nexpensive.  The  average  fastest  download  speed  is  16  kilobytes  per  second.  Water  supply, \nsanitation,  and  sewerage  systems  are  generally  not  available.  Most  households  rely  on \nrainwater tanks or water trucks for water supply, buckets, and pit toilets.  \n \nLand  problems.  As  elsewhere  in  PNG,  the  majority  of  land  in  the  province  is \n10. \ncustomarily  owned.  There  is  no  official  measurement  of  alienated  state  and  customary  lands \nwithin  Vanimo.  Ownership  of  land  is  controversial,  and  disputes  over  land  titles,  concession \nfees, and compensation issues are regular occurrences.  \n \n11. \nAccess  to  capital.  Prospective  businesses  in  the  province  have  almost  no  access  to \ncapital. Banks do not provide loans unless the loans are 100% guaranteed by cash deposits or \n100%  secured  by  collateral.  Since  land  titles  are  subject  to  disputes,  the  use  of  land  as \ncollateral has been limited\u2014even for landowners.  \n \n12. \nHuman development. According to the 2000 census, school attendance was very low \nin  the  province.  Only  24%  of  males  and  20%  of  females  aged  5\u201329  were  in  school;  62%  of \nmales and 47% of females aged 10 years above had ever been to school. Only 14% males and \n11% females had completed grade 10.  \n \n13. \nThe infant mortality rate is 71 per 1,000 live births, the fourth highest in PNG. The child \nmortality rate before the age of 5 is 64 children per 1,000. Life expectancy is 45.6 for men and \n46.5  for  women.  The  maternal  mortality  rate  is  difficult  to  determine  as  more  than  80%  of \npregnant  women  deliver  in  the  villages.  It  was  estimated  that  200  mothers  per  10,000  die \nannually.  There  are  119  confirmed  cases  of  HIV/AIDS,  of  which  45  (38%)  are  men,  62  (52%) \nare women, and 12 (10%) unknown.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n30 \n \n\nOpportunities. The province is richly endowed with natural resources such as copper, \n14. \ngold,  rainforest,  and  tuna.  It  has  fertile  land  to  grow  cocoa,  vanilla,  oil  palm,  betel  nuts, \nvegetable,  and  flowers.  Culturally,  it  is  diverse  with  five  different  cultural  zones  and  95  local \nlanguages\u2014each  with  different  rites,  traditions,  art  styles,  rules  for  land  ownership,  settlement \npatterns, male\u2013female relationships, and food.  \n \n15. \nThe  Government  established  the  Border  Development  Authority  (BDA)  in  2008  to \naddress the infrastructure needs of six border provinces including WSP. It is contemplating an \nambitious  economic  corridor  development  plan  for  the  province,  including  road  linkages, \nairports, and development zones.  \n \n16. \nThe Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) is assisting the province \nin  improving  basic  service  delivery  such  as  education,  health,  and  infrastructure  maintenance \nthrough  provincial  performance  improvement  initiatives  (divided  into  three  phases).  Phase  1 \nfocuses  on  capacity  development  for  corporate  management;  phase  2,  service  delivery;  and \nphase 3, a combination of both. The province has received K250,000 for completion of phase 1 \nand  will  receive  up  to  K1  million  during  phase  2.  AusAID  is  also  sealing  and  maintaining  the \nmajor roads in the province, including the one connecting Vanimo with Jayapura, the capital of \nPapua Province of Indonesia.  \n \nThe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) still has about $100 million development aid that \n17. \nhas not been allocated to projects. The aid will be highly concessional loans with an interest rate \nof 2% and repayment period of about 20 years. If the PRC\u2019s aid is mobilized to provide power, \nwater  supply,  and  a  learning  center,  the  business  environment  in  WSP  will  be  significantly \nimproved.  \n \n18. \nmicrofinance project to the province.  \n \n19. \nThe  province  shares  260  kilometers  of  land  border  with  Papua  Province  of  Indonesia, \nwhich  offers  services  and  products  25%\u201340%  cheaper.  The  trade  volume  between  WSP  and \nPapua Province of Indonesia reached $7 million in 2007.  \n\nThe  Government  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  are  considering  extending  a \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\n \n\nASSESSMENT OF REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR TRADE AND INVESTMENT \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe  regulatory  framework  that  governs  trade  and  investment  in  Papua  New  Guinea \n1. \n(PNG)  is  complex.  Key  legislation  that  comprises  this  regulatory  framework  includes  the \n(i) Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local-Level Governments, 1998; (ii) Investment \nPromotion Act, 1992; (iii) Customs Act, 2006 (being amended); (iv) Free Trade Zone Act, 2000; \nand  (v) labor  law  (Employment  of  Non-Citizens  Act,  2007).  These  laws  and  regulations  have \nsound intent and objectives, but in reality, either they are not implemented, or they hinder trade \nand investment as they incur high compliance costs. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nWhile  the  Organic  Law  on  Provincial  Governments  and  Local  Level  Governments \n(Organic  Law)  does  not  directly  regulate  trade  and  investment,  it  is  a  key  element  of  the \nregulatory  framework  as  it  is  the  legislation  that  establishes  provincial  and  local-level \ngovernments and their roles. A key purpose of the Organic Law is to provide the basic human \nneeds for water, health, education, transportation, communication, accommodation, and social \norder  through  economic  self-reliance;  and  to  create  subordinate  institutions  of  government  for \nthe provinces and local government areas. \n\nOrganic Law on Provincial Governments and Local-Level Governments  \n\n3. \nThe  PNG\u2019s  Medium  Term  Development  Strategy  2005\u20132010  identified  that  the  key \nobjective  of  the  Organic  Law  was  to  improve  service  delivery  by  transferring  significant \nresponsibilities and funds to provincial and local level governments. However, the Medium Term \nDevelopment  Strategy  acknowledges  that  services  have  deteriorated  since  the  Organic  Law \nwas passed. Service delivery systems are dysfunctional and there is widespread confusion over \nfunctional  and  financial  responsibilities  across  the  three  levels  of  government.  Institutional \ncapacity to deliver services is generally poor.1  \n\n4. \nThere  is  little  evidence  in  West  Sepik  Province  (WSP)  that  these  problems  have  been \naddressed  and  impediments  to  service  delivery  overcome.  This  failure  is  disappointing  as  the \nlegislation provides for a range of benefits to be delivered to provincial and local governments. \n\n5. \nSection  91  of  the  Organic  Law  states  that  the  national  Government  shall  make  the \nfollowing  grants  to  the  provincial  and  local  governments:  (i)  administrative  support  grants, \n(ii) development  grants,  (iii)  town  and  urban  services  grants,  and  (iv)  economic  grants.  The \ndevelopment grant provides specifically for a provincial infrastructure grant, of which 50% will go \nto  social  services  and  administrative  infrastructure,  and  50%  to  land  and  other  physical \ninfrastructure development. When considered in the context of development of a free trade zone \narea, with improved forward budget planning and more efficient use of financial resources, this \ngrant has the potential to enable infrastructure development that will be important in attracting \ninvestors to the free trade zone area. \n\nSection 42 of the Organic Law provides that a provincial legislature may make laws on \n6. \n(i)  mobile  trading;  (ii)  primary,  secondary,  technical,  and  vocational  education,  but  not \ncurriculum; (iii) sale and distribution of alcohol; (iv) public entertainment; (v) culture and cultural \ncenters;  (vi) museums  and  libraries;  (vii)  sport  and  recreation;  (viii)  tourism;  (ix)  village  and \nurban  or  community  courts;  (x)  community,  urban,  and  rural  development;  (xi)  agriculture; \n(xii) fishing  and  fisheries;  (xiii)  trade  and  industry  within  the  province;  (xiv)  rural  health; \n                                                 \n1 Government of Papua New Guinea. 2004.

For  example,  items  (i), \n(viii),  (x),  (xiii),  (xvi),  (xvii),  and  (xviii)  are  all  areas  where  specific  provincial  legislations  and \npolicies could be developed to facilitate trade and investment.  \n\n8. \nFor example, town and urban planning regulations could be tailored to provide favorable \nplanning  provisions  to  attract  developers.  This  is  not  to  say  that  planning  provisions  could  be \nrelaxed  to  facilitate  unsustainable  and  inappropriate  development;  rather,  planning  regulations \ncould  more  clearly  identify  areas  suited  for  particular  types  of  development  to  encourage \ninvestment. Planning provisions should also align and be consistent with areas identified as free \ntrade zones or special economic zones. \n\nLike most provinces, WSP has not made use of any of these positive policy opportunities \n9. \nprovided  for  under  the  Organic  Law,  and  has  not  passed  any  provincial  legislation  since  the \nintroduction of the Organic Law. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Promotion Act  \n\n10. \nThe  Investment  Promotion  Act  aims  to  promote  investment  in  the  interests  of  national, \nsocial, and economic development, and for that purpose, to establish a body to be known as the \nInvestment Promotion Authority (IPA). The specific purposes of the act are to \n\npromote and facilitate investment in the country by citizens and foreign investors; \nprovide for the grant of a certificate to a foreign enterprise;  \ndefine the activities open to a foreign investor;  \nprovide for a register of foreign investment opportunities;  \npromote investments that will materially benefit the country and its people; \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi)  monitor the impact of investment and the activities of enterprises; and \nestablish the IPA to assist the state in achieving the purposes.  \n(vii) \n\nThe purposes of the Investment Promotion Act are sound, with the broad objectives of \n11. \nfacilitating investment and trade. However, in practice, many procedural aspects of the act are \nobstacles to investment, particularly foreign direct investment. \n\n12. \n\nSome of the roles of the IPA (section 6) include \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nproviding information to investors in the country and overseas;  \nencouraging  and  facilitating  investment  in  the  country  by  assisting  investors  to \nobtain all necessary licenses, compliances, and approvals;  \nfacilitating the introduction of citizens and foreign investors to each other and to \nactivities and investments of mutual benefit;  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n33 \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nproviding  a  system  of  certification  of  a  foreign  enterprise  and  requiring  that  a \nforeign enterprise may only carry on business if so certified; and \nmonitoring  the  activities  of  foreign  enterprises  to  determine  whether  a  foreign \nenterprise is certified and complies with the terms and conditions of its certificate \nto carry on business in the country.  \n\n13.  While  the  IPA  has  delivered  item  (i),  although  the  capacity  of  the  IPA  in  Vanimo  is \nlimited, the other four roles actually inhibit rather than promote investment. \n\n14.  With respect to item (ii), the Investment Promotion Act requires a raft of approvals and \nlicenses,  in  addition  to  approvals  required  under  other  acts.  For  example,  a  foreign  investor \nwishing  to  construct  a  tuna  packaging  plant  in  Vanimo  will  not  only  be  required  to  obtain \nplanning  and  building  approval  for  the  land  use  and  building  works,  but  also  need  to  obtain  a \nlicense  for  the  activity  if  it  is  within  the  free  trade  zone  area,  and  ensure  the  company  is \nregistered under the Companies Act, 1997 and then also meet the stringent requirements and \nassessment under the Investment Promotion Act. \n\nThe  IPA,  in  its  Investment  Promotion  Regulation,  1992,  defined  types  of  activities  that \n15. \nare  reserved  to  PNG  citizens  and  national  enterprises.  The  list  of  such  reserved  activities\u2014\n\u201ccottage-based  activities\u201d\u2014includes  many  small  business  industries,  where  foreign  investment \ncould very well promote overall economic growth of the country, and in particular could result in \nincreased employment in some of the less developed provinces.  \n\n16. \nThe IPA procedures for foreign direct investment approval lack clarity and transparency, \nand  have  consequently  left  IPA  vulnerable  to  accusations of  political  influence  and  corruption. \nUncertainty  about  the  future  shape  of  investment  conditions,  including  the  structure  of \nincentives, is likely to compound the unattractiveness for foreign investment. \n\nD. \n\nFree Trade Zone Act  \n\n17. \nThe  Free  Trade  Zone  (FTZ)  Act  was  developed  by  the  Government  to  establish  the \nframework and mechanism for the creation, operation, administration, and coordination of free \ntrade zones in PNG; and to make provision for the creation and establishment of authorities in \nrespect of such free trade zones and for the conferral upon such authorities of statutory powers \nand functions relating to the management, control, and regulation of such free trade zones and \nfor related purposes.2 \n\nThe  processes  of  the  FTZ  Act  that  lead  to  development  and  subsequently  trade  and \n\n18. \ninvestment are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nDeclaration of an area of a province as a free commercial or free industrial zone \n(section 3). \nAfter  consultation  with \nthe  provincial  administration,  appoint  a  company \nincorporated  under  the  Companies  Act,  1997,  as  an  authority  for  the  FTZ \n(section 4). \nThe appointed authority has the following functions (section 6): \n\n                                                 \n2 Government of Papua New Guinea. 2000.

Depending  on  whether \nbuilding  works  are  required,  the  lease  may  be  either  a  maximum  of  10  or  40 \nyears. \n\n19. \nThe FTZ Act has excellent policy objectives in terms of attempting to promote trade and \ninvestment.  However,  the  reality  on  the  ground  is  that  there  has  been  no  development \nassociated with the declaration of the FTZ Act in 9 years in WSP. \n\nThe Companies Office records indicate that Sandaun Trade Development Limited with a \n20. \nbusiness  name  of  Sandaun  Trade  Development  Authority  existed  for  a  number  of  years,  but \nwas  never  appointed  by  the  minister  as  an  FTZ  authority  in  accordance  with  section  4  of  the \nFTZ Act. Furthermore, Sandaun Trade Development Limited has since been de-registered as a \nlegal entity. \n \n21. \nThe requirement to appoint an authority is considered to be too resource-intensive. For \nan  authority  to  be  required  to  receive,  assess,  and  issue  licenses  and  permits,  it  must  have \nadequate capacity and resources. The mandate of the authority also duplicates already existing \napproval mechanisms, such as IPA and planning and building approvals for development. \n \n22. \nThe  fact  that  a  lease  can  be  granted  for  up  to  40  years  is  a  positive  step  in  terms  of \ngranting security of land tenure to a potential developer, but this is offset somewhat by the fact \nthat  under  section  23  of  the  FTZ  Act,  licenses  have  a  maximum  lifespan  of  12  months.  It  is \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n35 \n\n \n\nCustoms Act (presently being amended) \n\ndifficult  to  understand  the  merit  in  having  a  lease  for  40  years  yet  a  license  that  must  be \napproved annually by the authority. This does not promote investors\u2019 confidence. \n \nE. \n \n23. \nThe Customs Act sets out the administrative policies and procedures for external trade \nin PNG, including cross-border trade through the Wutung border crossing in WSP. It also sets \nout the policies and procedures for fiscal administration of external trade in the province. \n \n24. \nPNG has been an active member of the World Customs Organization since 2002. It has \ncompleted the necessary legislative changes to implement practices and procedures based on \nglobal standards approved by the World Customs Organization and is striving to accede to the \nRevised Kyoto Convention for the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures by \n2009. The revisions to the Customs Act with respect to administrative appeals, advance binding \nrulings, a code of ethics and conduct, and post-clearance audit are significant and will result in \nexcellent  improvements.  They  were  passed  by  Parliament  in  November  2006 and  were \nintended to be effective from January 2007 through the budgetary amendments. However, the \nSpeaker of Parliament has yet to certify the amendments, and consequently, the amendments \nhave yet to be formally announced and an updated act published. \n \nPNG Customs Service has established a customs review tribunal, which is to provide an \n25. \nindependent  adjudication  of  appeals  lodged  by  a  trader.  This  is  one  of  the  best  actions  by \ncustoms.  Provisions  should  be  made  for  publication  of  decisions  of  the  tribunal  that  are  of \ngeneral  application,  in  accordance with  the  principles of  the  Revised  Kyoto  Convention.  While \nthis policy establishes time limits for lodging an appeal to the tribunal and for lodging an appeal \nto the courts on a decision by the tribunal, there should be a time limit obligation on the tribunal \nto render a timely decision on its cases (e.g., within 60 or 90 days of the time that an appeal is \nheard). \n \nF. \n \n26. \nPNG\u2019s customary land tenure system is firmly entrenched in the nation\u2019s culture, and is \nrecognized  in  the  legal  system.  It  underpins  village  farming  systems  and  provides  a  welfare \nsafety  net  for  the  majority  of  people  in  provincial  areas.  Customary  land  ownership  is  a  major \nconstraint to economic development. \n \nAs a general rule, customary land cannot be used as collateral by landowners seeking \n27. \ninvestment  funds  because  of  the  absence  of  secure  legal  tenure.  Individual  landowners  have \nlittle  incentive  to  improve  the  land  if  the  resulting  benefits  accrue  to  a  large  number  of  people \nwho  did  not  contribute  to  the  improvement  effort.  Mobilizing  customary  land  for  large-scale \neconomic projects is costly, time-consuming, and uncertain. \n \n28. \nThe  current  legal  land  reform  initiative  before  Parliament  is  aimed  at  settling  land  title \ndisputes.  The  legislation  is  designed  to  make  the  process  of  gaining  secure  access  to \ncustomary land easier, through improvements in land administration processes, settlements of \ndisputes,  and  development  of  the  institutional  framework  for  a  viable  land  market,  including \nlong-term leases. It is intended that decisions on land use are devolved to the landowning social \nunit,  the  collective  body  claiming  rights  to  the  land  by  customary  law.  The  incorporated \nlandowning  social  unit  is  the  forum  for  decisions  about  the  use  of  land  by  customary  law  and \nnow by statute. The new law provides a framework for progress in making more productive use \nof customary land. \n\nLand Tenure and Security \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nVarious options for land tenure are embedded in the law: lease\u2013lease back, land tenure \n29. \nconversion,  state  acquisition,  and  customary  development  land  (the  new  creation  under  the \nlegislation).  Incentives  are  built  in  through  the  legislation  to  give  the  various  levels  of \ngovernment, as well as landowning units, motivation to make more productive use of land\u2014in \nparticular, there  is sharing  of  taxes  collected  with  respect  to  the  leasing  and  use  of  land.  This \nwill  give  incentives  to  local  and  provincial  governments  to  develop  infrastructure  to  attract \ninvestment in customary land under their jurisdiction. It will also give landowning units incentives \nto overcome disagreements in order to mobilize the land for investment\u2014by themselves or by \nothers. \n \nG. \n\nTrade Agreement between the Government of Indonesia and the Government of \nPapua New Guinea  \n\n \n30. \nPapua New Guinea, 2000 provides for the following: \n \n\nThe  trade  agreement  between  the  Government  of  Indonesia  and  the  Government  of \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n \n\nan undertaking to facilitate trade for business persons; \nan offer of \u201cmost favored nation treatment\u201d on trade between the two parties; \nexclusion of preferential treatment offered by either party to other trade partners; \nthe requirement to comply with domestic laws in both parties; \nthe facilitation of trade fairs; \narrangement  that  payments  for  trade  in  goods  and  services  be  made  in  freely \nconvertible currencies; \nconsultations between the parties on any problems of market access; \nestablishment of a joint trade committee to deal with any difficulties related to the \ntrade in goods; \nconfirmation  that  national  quarantine  provisions  of  each  party  apply  to  trade  in \ngoods; and \nprotection of each other\u2019s intellectual property rights. \n\nLabor Law (Employment of Non-Citizens Act) \n\n31. \nThis  agreement  is  rather  routine,  and  reaffirms  rights  and  obligations  already  covered \nunder  PNG\u2019s  and  Indonesia\u2019s  membership  in  the  World  Trade  Organization.  The  agreement \ndoes very little to actively promote and facilitate new trade and investment between Indonesia \nand PNG, which is constrained by many other regulatory aspects. \n \nH.  \n \n32. \nThe purpose of the Employment of Non-Citizens Act is to provide a balance between the \nneeds of the economy for foreign labour and the aspirations of Papua New Guineans for decent \nwork  by (i)  assisting  business  to  attract  and  retain  the  services  of  qualified,  skilled  and \nexperienced  non-citizens  without  unnecessary  impediments;  and  (ii)  promoting  a  work  permit \nsystem  that  contributes  to  the  creation  of  employment,  training  and  skills-acquisition \nopportunities for all Papua New Guineans.  \n \nThe  purpose  of  this  act  attempts  to  strike  a  balance  between  providing  a  regulatory \n33. \nframework that allows businesses to engage the services of noncitizens where required without \nunnecessary impediments, yet also ensure that the importation of foreign labor, both skilled and \nunskilled,  does  not  disadvantage  Papua  New  Guineans \nlocal \nunemployment. Key aspects of this act are as follows:  \n \n\nterms  of  causing \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n37 \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe hiring of a noncitizen requires an approval to recruit from the Department of \nLabour  and  Industrial  Relations,  as  well  as  a  work  permit  for  the  relevant \nnoncitizen employee.  \nWork  permits  are  generally  available \nfor  noncitizens  with  management, \nprofessional, or technical skills, although they are usually only issued for a limited \nperiod.  Applicants  must  be  conversant  with  English,  Pidgin,  or  Motu.  Once  a \nwork permit has been granted, an employment visa is issued by the Department \nof Foreign Affairs on application by the holder of the work permit. Work permits \nare usually for 3 years and cover a particular position. The employee working in \nthe position can be replaced without approval. Work permits are only issued after \nthe employee has arrived in PNG. \nNoncitizens  who  require  entry  into  PNG  for  business  reasons  (but  not  to  work) \ncan apply for a 12-month multiple entry (60 days at a time) business visa. \nThere  is  also  a  recently  introduced  entry  permit  class  known  as  the  working \nresident  entry  permits.  These  are  temporary  permits  that  may  be  granted  to \nemployees of major development project companies prior to a work permit being \nobtained. Application must be made to the Immigration and Citizenship Division \nof the Department of Foreign Affairs.  \nSome  jobs  are  reserved  exclusively  for  citizens  and  one  of  the  conditions  of \nemploying  foreign  workers  is  that  the  employer  must  train  citizens  to  improve \ntheir skills and equip them to take over from the foreign workers. A training levy is \nimposed on most employees to achieve this end. Specific occupations, covering \n578 vocation codes out of a total of 1,048, are reserved for nationals.  \n\n \nA  study  undertaken  by  the  IFC3  indicated  that  obtaining  a  noncitizen  work  permit  can \n34. \ntake 6 months and cost K5,000 and there is anecdotal evidence of corrupt practices. Discretion \nis  also  exercised  in  the  associated  visa  approvals  process.  A  further  impediment  is  that  staff \nnationalization plans are required up-front before permits are issued.  \n \n35. \nRequirements of the Employment of Non-Citizens Act are politically appealing, but may \nhave kept large numbers of people unemployed because of lack of investment. It needs to be \nrealized  that  skill  transfer  does  not  only  depend  on  trainers,  but  also  the  capacity  of  trainees. \nEducation is the ultimate way of creating a skilled labor force.  \n \n36. \nTimely  and  efficient  accessibility  to  noncitizen  workers,  particularly  in  remote  regions \nsuch  as  Vanimo,  is  important  to  business  where  specific  labor  skills  may  not  exist  within  the \nlocal labor market. \n\n                                                 \n3  International Finance Corporation. 2003.

The  capacity  assessment  is  carried  out  from  an  institutional  economics \npoint of view, according to which institutions including informal and formal rules are the key to \nexplaining  different  economic  performance  across  countries.  To  promote  trade  and  private \ninvestment,  it  is  essential  to  understand  the  current  institutions  of  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG) \nand design appropriate interventions accordingly.  \n \nInformal  rules.  PNG  is  linguistically  and  culturally  diverse,  with  more  than  800  ethnic \n2. \ngroups.  While  this  is  certainly  an  advantage,  it  poses  challenges  to  communication, \nunderstanding,  social  harmony,  collective  decisions  in  the  interest  of  the  majority,  and  nation \nbuilding.  The  wantok  system,  customary  land  ownership,  and  the  \u201cask  and  give\u201d  culture  suit \nsubsistence gardening production well and provide a  social safety net. However,  they hamper \nmodern  governance  that  requires  government  be  impartial  to  develop  and  enforce  laws  and \nregulations, and business development which requires clear property rights and thrift and saving \nfor business growth.  \n \n3. \nFormal  rules.  PNG\u2019s  laws  and  regulations  are  characterized  by  overcentralization  and \nprotection of nationals. Construction contracts are between the state and contractors. Contracts \nwith  values  above  K10  million  need  to  go  through  32  procedures  before  the  approval  of  the \nNational  Executive  Council,  the  cabinet.  Foreign  investment  approval  is  centralized  at  the \nInvestment Promotion Authority (IPA), which has to certify the financial and operational capacity \nof  the  foreign  investors  regardless  of  the  investment  amount.  This  also  applies  to  company \nregistration. Approval of work permits and visas and issuance of passports are all centralized in \nPort  Moresby,  and  require  months  of  waiting  time.  Compounded  by  the  underdeveloped  and \ncostly  transport  and  telecommunication  infrastructure,  administrative  discretions,  and  shortage \nof funding and staff, compliance with the formal rules is expensive and time-consuming and has \nbecome  a  major  hindrance  to  trade  and  investment.  Detailed  assessment  of  the  regulatory \nframework governing trade and investment is in Appendix 3.  \n \n4. \nThe  \u201ccottage  list\u201d  that  restricts  a  list  of  business  activities  to  nationals,  investment  and \nlabor laws that require hiring one international staff with three nationals and up-front localization \nprograms,  and  the  minimum  wage  requirements  are  understandable  and  politically  appealing. \nHowever,  they  reduce  the  attractiveness  and  competitiveness  of  PNG  as  a  destination  for \nforeign investment because these requirements translate into costs. Lack of foreign investment \nin  the  agriculture,  manufacturing,  and  service  sectors  means  job  loss,  a  sluggish  economic \ngrowth pattern, slow technical and skill development, and persistent subsistence farming.  \n \n5. \nInformation  on  the  Government\u2019s  policies,  rules,  and  regulations  is  not  generally \navailable to the public, particularly in their totality. No single source of information describes the \nregulatory  approval  procedures  and  trade,  tariff,  customs,  quarantine,  immigration,  foreign \nexchange, and tax policies. Unclear legal and regulatory requirements provide opportunities for \nrent-seeking activities and cause major delays and compliance costs.  \n \nOrganizational  capacity.  There  are  26  national  departments,  34  statutory  authorities, \n6. \nand 20 provincial governments in PNG. West Sepik Province (WSP) has 17 provincial and local \ngovernments.  More  than  50%  of  the  recurrent  budget  went  to  consumption  of  goods  and \nservices by the Government. Intergovernmental relations and responsibilities between provincial \nand  local  governments  are  unclear.  Policies  and  decisions  made  at  high  levels  may  not \nnecessarily be implemented at the operational levels. There seems to be a shortage of staff and \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nfunding across government departments. The customs officers at Wutung border have served in \ntheir posts for 8\u201310 years and were not able to be rotated because of funding constraints.  \n \n7. \nThe Commerce Division of West Sepik Provincial Administration has two staff members. \nIn  2007,  its  budget  allocation  was  K12,000.  The  Physical  Planning  Board  and  Building  Board \nare  the  two  local  authorities  for  granting  construction  permits.  According  to  the  Physical \nPlanning Act, 1989 and Building Board Act, 1978; the two boards should hold a meeting once a \nmonth but only two or three meetings were held annually in the past years.  \n \n8. \nThe  Border  Development  Authority  (BDA)  was  established  in  October  2008.  It  has \nmandates to coordinate development activities, provide infrastructure, and promote both foreign \nand local investment in the border provinces. Of 150 positions, it has filled 28 positions including \nkey  positions  such  as  the  executive  chair,  general  manager,  corporate  director,  planning  and \nimplementation director, and human resource manager. Even when all positions are filled, BDA \nwill require capacity development in project management, procurement, project evaluation and \nreporting, project supervision and monitoring, financial management, and investment promotion \nto carry out its mandates as well as the responsibilities of the Executing Agency for the Project.  \n \n9. \nPNG  Customs  Service  has  made  substantial  progress  toward  acceding  to  the  Revised \nKyoto Convention for Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures and has set an \nexample  in  the  Pacific.  However,  according  to  the  diagnostic  report  of  the  World  Customs \nOrganization,  it  needs  to  upgrade  its  information  technology  infrastructure  and  strengthen  law \nenforcement capability to further improve its clearance efficiency and facilitate trade. \n \nHuman capacity. The  adult literacy rate for PNG is 57.3% and the  combined primary, \n10. \nsecondary, and tertiary gross enrollment ratio is 40.7%. Life expectancy at birth is 57 years. For \nWSP,  the  adult  literacy  rate  is  around  45%  and  life  expectancy  at  birth  is  46  years.  Skills \nshortage exists in almost all professions\u2014particularly policy strategists, managers, mining and \ncivil  engineers,  geologists,  financial  controllers,  and  information  technology  specialists.  The \nskilled labor requirement of the liquefied natural gas project, which is anticipated to be 8,000 in \nthe medium term, will further aggravate the labor market.  \n \nHuman capacity is not just about skill, but also work ethics. It seems fairly common that \n11. \nin  PNG,  a  skilled  worker  fails  to  catch  his  flight,  turn  up  at  a  scheduled  meeting,  deliver  his \npromise; and may even disappear under a contract.  \n \nPeople  in  Vanimo  and  Wutung  border  acknowledges  that  trade  with  Indonesia  is  an \n12. \nopportunity. However, they fear they may not be able to participate because they do not have \nthe fundamental perspectives, culture, or experience with trade and formal business enterprise. \nThey  have  specifically  requested  entrepreneurship  training  and  technical  and  vocational \nbusiness  training  with  respect  to  starting  a  business;  registering  a  business;  knowledge  of  a \npotential market; understanding of technology; capacity to manage books and records; skills in \nrecruiting, training, deploying, and managing employees; and paying taxes.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n41 \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A6.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n\n(K million) \nLocal \nCurrency \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal \nCost \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n \n\n \n\n($ million) \nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \n\n \n\n13.40 \n8.06 \n\n21.46 \n \n\n \n0.10 \n\n0.50 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.15 \n\n3.00 \n\n3.75 \n \n\n \n3.17 \n\n1.01 \n\n0.00 \n\n4.18 \n \n2.73 \n \n \n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.08 \n\n0.08 \n \n \n2.15 \n\n0.58 \n\n \n\n15.72 \n\n6.87 \n\n22.59 \n \n \n\n0.60 \n\n1.01 \n\n0.38 \n\n1.19 \n\n0.25 \n\n0.00 \n\n3.43 \n \n \n\n0.00 \n\n5.36 \n\n0.80 \n\n6.16 \n \n1.35 \n \n \n0.08 \n\n0.49 \n\n0.03 \n\n0.08 \n\n0.60 \n\n1.28 \n \n \n2.26 \n\n5.67 \n\n \n\n \n\n29.12 \n\n14.93 \n\n44.05 \n \n \n\n0.70 \n\n1.51 \n\n0.38 \n\n1.19 \n\n0.40 \n\n3.00 \n\n7.18 \n \n\n \n\n3.17 \n\n6.37 \n\n0.80 \n\n10.34 \n \n4.08 \n \n\n \n0.08 \n\n0.49 \n\n0.03 \n\n0.08 \n\n0.68 \n\n1.36 \n \n \n4.41 \n\n6.25 \n\n \n\n4.90 \n\n2.95 \n\n7.85 \n \n \n\n0.04 \n\n0.18 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.05 \n\n1.10 \n\n1.37 \n \n\n \n1.16 \n\n0.37 \n\n0.00 \n\n1.53 \n \n1.00 \n \n \n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.03 \n\n0.03 \n \n \n0.79 \n\n0.21 \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n\n \n\n10.65 \n\n5.46 \n\n16.11 \n \n \n\n0.26 \n\n0.55 \n\n0.14 \n\n0.44 \n\n0.14 \n\n1.10 \n\n2.63 \n \n \n\n1.16 \n\n2.33 \n\n0.29 \n\n3.78 \n \n1.50 \n \n \n0.03 \n\n0.18 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.03 \n\n0.25 \n\n0.50 \n \n \n1.62 \n\n2.29 \n\n \n\n5.75 \n\n2.51 \n\n8.26 \n \n \n\n0.22 \n\n0.37 \n\n0.14 \n\n0.44 \n\n0.09 \n\n0.00 \n\n1.26 \n \n \n\n0.00 \n\n1.96 \n\n0.29 \n\n2.25 \n \n0.50 \n \n \n0.03 \n\n0.18 \n\n0.01 \n\n0.03 \n\n0.22 \n\n0.47 \n \n \n0.83 \n\n2.08 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nItem \nA.

As  a  new  establishment  and  executing  agency  for  the \nProject,  the  Border  Development  Authority  (BDA)  will  need  assistance  to  build  its  capacity  to \nimplement the Project. The TA will consist of three parts: (i) development of investment policy \nlegislation  for  WSP,  (ii)  study  of  telecommunication  options  for  WSP,  and  (iii) capacity \ndevelopment in the areas of procurement and financial management for BDA.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nTo  capture  the  trade  opportunity  with  Indonesia  and  worldwide,  WSP  needs  to  attract \ninvestment  to  expand  production,  increase  supplies  of  its  marketable  products,  and  promote \ntourism.  However,  WSP  faces  formidable  challenges  at  both  national  and  provincial  levels  to \nimprove the investment climate. Unless deliberate government investment policies are provided \nand economic activities are stimulated, the chance of development will be slim and investment \nin border facilities may be wasted. \n \n3. \nPolicy  development  needs  to  be  internally  driven.  The  TA  will  provide  an  investment \npolicy  strategist  (international,  18  person-months)  to  assist  a  government  policy  team  in \ndeveloping investment policy legislation for WSP. Responsibilities include but are not limited to \nthe following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nAssisting BDA in establishing a well-motivated and dedicated policy team led by \nsenior government officials. \nIntroducing to the policy team the most recent successful country experience in \ninvestment  promotion  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  particularly  the  experience  of  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, or some \nother countries.  \nDeveloping  overseas  short  visit  plans  and  agenda,  and  organizing  overseas \ntours  to  expose  the  policy  team  to  successful  experiences  in  investment \npromotion in Asia and the Pacific. \nAssisting the policy team in preparing the reports of the study tours. \nAssisting  the  policy  team  in  reviewing  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  laws  and \nregulations  governing  foreign  and  national  investment,  and  related  constraints \nsuch as land.  \nAssisting the policy team in developing an investment act for WSP. \n\n(vi) \n(vii)  Organizing  workshops  with  the  participation  of  distinguished  political  and \n\nbusiness leaders and development partners to advise on the investment act. \n\n(viii)  Assisting BDA in the Government\u2019s approval of the investment policy legislation \n\n(ix) \n\nand pilot testing in WSP.  \nAssisting  BDA  in  developing  an  information  guide  to  the  act,  customs, \nimmigration,  quarantine,  tariff,  taxes,  business  registration,  land,  construction \npermit, etc.  \n\nThe  investment  policy  strategist  needs  to  have  extensive  investment  promotion  and \n4. \ncountry  experience.  The  output  will  be  the  approved  investment  policy  legislation  for  WSP. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nStudy of Telecommunication Strategy for WSP \n\nReporting requirements include (i) monthly progress reports to be submitted in the first week of \nthe following month, (ii) a draft final report, and (iii) a final report.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nBackground.  Telecommunication  is  a  regulated  sector  in  PNG.  The  Independent \nConsumer and Competition Commission (ICCC) handles the regulatory requirements related to \nthe Telecommunications Act, 1996. ICCC provides the telecom regulatory contract and Pangtel \nprovides  any  technical  regulations.  ICCC  and  Pangtel  have  concurrent  powers  and  they  are \nrequired  to  consult  each  other.  In  the  event  of  any  disagreement,  the  decisions  of  ICCC  will \nprevail.  \n \nTelikom  PNG  is  the  corporate  entity  set  by  the  Government  as  the  sole  provider  of \n6. \ntelecommunication  services,  and  it  abides  by  the  ICCC  regulatory  contract.  Telikom  PNG \nprovides voice, internet, and data services.  \n \nA  subsidiary  of  Telikom  PNG,  Pacific  Mobile  Communications  provides  the  internet \n7. \ngateway  services.  Tiara  Internet  Gateway  (under  Pacific  Mobile  Communications)  provides \nservices  to  the  internet  service  provider.  Telikom  PNG  is  also  active  in  the  mobile \ncommunication sector, using another subsidiary B-Mobile. \n \n8. \nThe  mobile  phone  sector  is  partially  open  for  competition,  with  Digicel  offering  mobile \nphone services along with B-Mobile. There is a third company, Green Com, whose operations \nhave not been very successful. According to some media reports, a major stakeholder has left \nthe company, leaving the operations to deteriorate.  \n \n9. \nThe country\u2019s domain space of (.pg) is administered by Papua New Guinea University of \nTechnology  in  Lae.  Five  internet  service  providers  are  licensed:  DG  Computers,  Global \nTechnologies, Online South Pacific, Daltron Electronics, and Datec. \n \n10. \nThe  country\u2019s  main  internet  pipe  connects  Port  Moresby  to  Australia  and  is  owned  by \nTelikom  PNG.  Pacific  Mobile  Communications  operates  this  gateway  and  leases  the  gateway \nfor use to the internet service providers.  \n \n11. \nAnother  internet  pipe  (Pipe  Pacific  Cable  1),  under  construction  by  Australia\u2019s  Pipe \nNetworks,  is  expected  to  be  commissioned  later  this  year.  It  connects  Sydney  to  Guam  and \nprovides onward connectivity to the United States and Asia. This will have connectivity to Lae, \nthus providing another internet gateway. \n  \n12. \nIn 2008, PNG\u2019s Academic and Research Network became operational, and connects to \nAsiaSat  4  through  a  teleport  hub  in  Singapore.  This  network  is  operated  by  a  consortium  and \nmaintained by a local team. Members of this private network include the Education Department, \nOffice  of  Libraries  and  Archives,  Papua  New  Guinea  University  of  Technology,  University  of \nPapua  New  Guinea,  Vudal  University,  Goroka  University,  Pacific  Adventist  University,  Divine \nWord University, National Research Institute, National Agriculture Research Institute, and Office \nof Higher Education. \n \n13. \nA major recent development is the new information and communication technology (ICT) \npolicy  for  the  telecommunications  sector  that  was  released  in  April  2009.  According  to  the \npolicy,  the  responsibilities  of  ICCC  and  Pangtel  will  be  merged  and  managed  under  a  new \nregulatory structure. The internet gateway will open to more operators other than Telikom PNG. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n51 \n\nA universal access scheme, which is taking telecommunications to less-developed areas, will be \ngiven importance. These changes are sweeping and are expected to change the marketplace. \n\nin \n\n14. \nScope of study. The scope of the study is to investigate telecommunication options for \nWSP  that  can  promote  trade  and  investment,  be  used  by  BDA  and  customs,  and  stimulate \noverall  economic  activities \nthe  current \nthe  province\u2014taking \ntelecommunication  infrastructure,  emerging  trends  in  the  Pacific  region,  the  status  of \nimplementation of ICT policy, applicability of the technology in WSP, and affordability. \n \n15. \nObjectives.  The  objective  of  this  study  is  to  evolve  a  telecommunication  technology \nstrategy  for  WSP  by  (i)  evaluating  the  progress  of  the  new  telecommunication  policy  and  its \npossible  extension  to  WSP,  and  (ii)  evaluating  all  available  and  possible  technologies  for \ndeployment of telecommunication services in WSP. \n\ninto  consideration \n\nTerms  of  reference  for  telecommunications  specialist  (international,  4  person-\n\n16. \nmonths). The specialist will be responsible for the following:  \n\nSurveying  the  telecommunication  infrastructure  available  in  PNG,  including \ninfrastructure for mobile communications, internet connectivity, rural connectivity, \nespecially in WSP, and communication methods used (radio, satellite, etc). The \nproviders  to  be  covered  are  Telikom  PNG,  B Mobile,  Digicel,  and  any  other \ncarrier licensed since May 2009. \nStudying PNG\u2019s ICT policy and reporting on the progress of the implementation \nof the policy at the time of the study. The report should cover but not be limited to \nthe  state  of  governance  bodies  set  up,  high-level  details  of  obtaining  operator \nlicenses under the new scheme, details of the new operators, their infrastructure \nand schemes, and especially progress of the universal access scheme. \nUnderstanding  the  infrastructure  and  services  provided  by  the  academic  and \neducational  network  operated  by  PNG  Academic  and  Research  Network,  and \nexploring the feasibility of piggybacking this network for development activities in \nWSP. \nDocumenting  the  information  on  the  telecommunication  backbone  provided  by \nthe  main  carrier  and  operator,  Telikom  PNG,  and  other  mobile  operators \navailable at the time of the study. \nExploring the feasibility of using the telecommunication infrastructure available in \nneighboring Indonesia, as Vanimo, the capital of WSP, is very close to Jayapura, \nIndonesia. Identifying if a network pipe is available in Jayapura that can be used \nfor  expansion  in  Vanimo  for  internet  communication.  Identifying  if  technical \nfeasibility exists for internet connectivity, and if it exists, exploring if the new PNG \ntelecommunication  policy  will  allow  such  expansions,  either  as  a  joint  exercise \nbetween Indonesian telecom and Telikom PNG or through a new business entity. \nDeveloping a comprehensive telecom strategy for WSP based on the information \ncollected.  The  strategy  should  first  address  internet  access  for  businesses  and \ngovernment  establishments  in  Vanimo  and  possibly  end  users,  and  second \nimproving voice communication facilities in and around Vanimo. \n\n(vii)  Developing  various  options  for  implementation  of  the  strategy  (such  as \naugmenting  existing \ninfrastructure,  and \ninfrastructure,  providing  new \npiggybacking available infrastructure) from within the region and country as well \nas across the border, from Indonesia. \n\n \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n17. \n  \n\n(viii)  Analyzing the viability of each option, taking into consideration the benefits, cost, \nand  technological  viability.

This is because \n(i) trade  encourages  specialization  according  to  comparative  advantages,  enabling  efficient \ndeployment  of  national  resources;  (ii)  trade  expands  markets;  (iii)  trade  disseminates  ideas, \nlocal \nmanagement  and  organization  skills,  and \nbusinesses;  (iv)  trade  generates  investment  essential  for  employment;  and  (v)  trade  gives \nconsumers access to a wider range of products at cheaper prices. \n \nThe volume of international trade has not reached its optimal level based on differences \n2. \nin factor endowments, tastes, and technology between countries, even after a global reduction \nin  average  tariff  and  non-tariff  barriers.  The  lower  than  expected  trade  volume  is  more \npronounced  in  case  of  trade  between  neighboring  developing  countries,  often  evident  from \nsubstantial price differences between such countries. Trade transaction costs (TTCs) have been \noffered as a possible explanation of this shortfall. The most obvious examples of TTCs are (i) a \ntruck carrying goods for trade across the border will charge more for plying on a poor road or for \na  long  waiting  time,  thus  increasing  the  monetary  costs  of  the  goods;  (ii)  lack  of  warehousing \nfacilities  would  result  in  loss,  damage,  and  spoilage  of  goods  in  transit  and  may  increase \ninsurance charges; and (iii) lack of access to good transport and communication services may \nimpose a high opportunity cost by restricting market access. Empirical estimates using a gravity \ntax  equivalent  of  such  TTCs  could  be  as  high  as  74% \nequation \nthe \n(21% transportation,  44%  border-related  costs) \nfor \ndeveloping countries could be even higher.   \n \n3. \nWest  Sepik  Province  (WSP)  borders  Papua  Province  of  Indonesia,  which  offers  25%\u2013\n40% cheaper services and products. Trade across the border has taken place but is limited by \nthe closure of the Bewani\u2013Vanimo\u2013Jayapura road as the border facilities at Wutung, WSP are \nnot  ready \nfacility \naccommodating  traffic  flows  will  be built  to  facilitate  trade. Such  trade facilitation  will lead  to  a \nreduction  in  TTCs,  encouraging  exports  and  imports  from  and  to  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG); \nand resulting in a net gain in producer surplus, consumer surplus, and incremental government \nrevenues  from  exports  and  imports.  The  social  development  program  of  the  Project  is  to \nmitigate the social risks and comply with ADB\u2019s social policies. The social development program \nwas designed based on people\u2019s priorities\u2014health and education. \n \n4. \nAlternative  ways  to  promote  trade  have  been  considered  and  found  unfeasible.  The \nroom  for  further  tariff  reduction  is  very  limited  as  PNG  already  has  one  of  the  least  restrictive \ntrade regimes in the Pacific region. Compared with other constraints, such as infrastructure and \ngovernment investment policies and administrative practices, tariffs are a less binding constraint \nrestricting trade. \n \nRenovation of the current administration building will not help resolve the issue of traffic \n5. \nflow.  The  Wutung  border  area  needs  to  be  re-planned  and  new  facilities  need  to  be  built  to \nreduce TTCs associated with transportation, storage, and communications.  \n \n\nfor  handling  vehicle  crossing.

The assessment covers the period from 2010 to 2034 and assumes \nthe  implementation  schedule  in  Appendix  7  is  followed.  All  benefits  and  costs  are  in  constant \n2009 prices. The analysis excluded economic benefits such as business efficiency, job creation, \nskill  development,  and  reduction  in  income  differential  between  towns  far  from  the  border  and \ntowns neighboring the border, which are difficult to quantify. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nProject  economic  costs  include  civil  works  costs,  equipment  costs,  consulting  service \ncosts, physical contingency, and maintenance costs. The economic cost of land is not included \nbecause there is no incremental cost between with- and without-project scenarios, as the land \nhas been allocated for border development. Taxes and duties are excluded from the economic \nassessment. Costs were divided into tradable and non-tradable components. The non-tradable \ncomponents are made of domestic labor, materials, and other expenses, and are estimated to \nrepresent 73% of the costs. Costs for skilled and unskilled domestic labor were adjusted by a \nshadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.95  and  0.50  respectively  to  arrive  at  the  economic  opportunity \ncost. A standard conversion factor of 0.95 was applied to calculate the economic price of other \nnon-traded goods, and to estimate the opportunity cost of maintenance costs. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nWithout  the  Project,  TTCs  associated  with  loss,  damage,  and  spoilage  of  goods  in \ntransit; lack of access to transport and communication services; and market access restrictions \nwill be high\u2014equivalent to a tax of at least 25%. The Project will reduce the TTCs and increase \nthe  volume  of  trade.  The  total  increase  in  trade  can  be  estimated  from  the  price  elasticity  of \nexports  and  the  price  elasticity  of  imports.  As  the  trade  considered  here  is  bilateral,  the  price \nelasticity  of  both  exports  and  imports  is  expected  to  be  higher  than  the  multilateral  price \nelasticity of both exports and imports. We have assumed the price elasticity of demand for both \nimports and exports to be 1.55. Another important assumption made in the benefit estimates of \nthe border facilities is a reduction in TTCs by 12%. \n  \nThe benefits of the social development program are also significant. Providing electricity \n9. \nimproves the quality of life of the households connected with electricity, and decreases the cost \nof  using  other  sources of  fuel.  In  PNG,  the  willingness  to  pay  for  electricity  is  K1  per  kilowatt-\nhour  (kWh).  The  tariff  per  kWh  is  equivalent  to  $0.20.  Sanitation  reduces  both  morbidity  and \nmortality,  especially  for  children  under  5.  Fewer  ailments  reduce  the  portion  of  household \nincome  spent  on  treating  waterborne  diseases.  Safe  motherhood  reduces  both  maternal  and \nchild  mortality.  A  reduction  in  school  dropout  rates  increases  social  benefits,  as  the  income \ndifferential between a person with a school education and a person without a school education \nis substantial. Reduction in HIV/AIDS prevalence increases the household income by reducing \nthe expenditure on treatment. It also saves lives. To estimate the economic value of life saved \nby  the  social  development  program,  the  net  value  method  has  been  adopted.  To  find  the  net \nvalue, the gross income throughout a person\u2019s life has been computed. The average annual per \ncapita income in Wutung is K2,000 and the average working life of a person is 30 years. The \ntotal income stream discounted comes to about K21,000, which is the gross income of a person. \nGross  consumption  is  estimated  to  be  50%  of  gross  income.  With  an  assumed  probability  of \nsurvival of 85%, the net value of life saved is estimated to be K8,925. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nResults of Economic Analysis \n\nD. \n \n10. \nThe total economic benefit from the Project is quite substantial. Discounted at a rate of \n12%, the economic net present value (NPV) of the Project is K5.52 million, and the economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is 14.05%.

The analysis was conducted by \nincreasing the costs and reducing the benefits. \n \n12. \nAmong  the  individual  variables  affecting  the  Project,  TTCs  have  the  highest  impact  on \nthe  Project.  Even  small  changes  in  TTCs  affect  the  benefits  of  the  Project  as  shown  in \nTable A10.2. \n \n\nTable A10.2: Impact of Trade Transaction Costs on the Project \n\nReduction in TTC \nbenefits (%) \n\nENPV (K million) \n\nEIRR (%) \n\n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, ENPV = economic net present \nvalue, TTC = trade transaction cost.            \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n13. \nOn  the  positive  side,  the  prices  in  WSP  are  25%\u201340%  higher  than  those  in  Papua \nProvince of Indonesia. A large part of the prices is the TTC, which can be reduced by a modern \nborder  system  and  efficiency  in  operations.  A  modest  reduction  of  TTCs  can  produce \nsubstantial  economic  gains.  For  example,  if  TTCs  are  reduced  by  15%  instead  of  12%  as \nassumed in the base case, the NPV will increase by K8.11 million. Such a change will have a \nlasting impact on WSP. \n \n14. \nCapital costs also have a significant impact on the economics of the Project. An increase \nin capital costs of about 15.82% reduces the NPV of the Project to zero. The impact of capital \ncosts on the entire Project is shown in Table A10.3. \n \n\nTable A10.3: Impact of Capital Costs on the Project \n\nIncrease in Capital \nCosts (%) \n\nENPV (K million) \n\nEIRR (%) \n\n0 \n10 \n15 \n20 \n25 \n30 \n35 \n40 \n\n0 \n10 \n15 \n20 \n25 \n30 \n35 \n40 \n\n5.52 \n2.29 \n0.68 \n(0.94) \n(2.55) \n(4.16) \n(5.77) \n(7.39) \n\n5.52 \n2.32 \n0.73 \n(0.87) \n(2.47) \n(4.07) \n(5.67) \n(7.27) \n\n14.05 \n12.87 \n12.26 \n11.64 \n11.00 \n10.34 \n9.67 \n8.98 \n\n14.05 \n12.80 \n12.24 \n11.72 \n11.22 \n10.75 \n10.31 \n9.89 \n\n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, ENPV = economic net present value.            \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nThe  significant  impact  of  the  increase  in  capital  costs  would  call  for  serious  efforts  to \n\n15. \navoid cost overruns during project implementation. \n \n16. \nA  reduction  in  total  benefits  has  a  higher  impact  on  the  Project  in  comparison  with  a \nsame increase in total costs. A reduction of 12.16% in total benefits decreases the NPV of the \nProject to zero, while an increase of 13.84% in total costs decreases the NPV of the Project to \nzero. In conducting an analysis of the adverse situations the Project may face, even with either \na 10% reduction in benefits or a 10% increase in costs, the Project provides a positive NPV. In \nthe worst case scenario, where the Project suffers from both a 10% reduction in benefits and a \n10% increase in costs, the Project provides an EIRR of 10.95%. \n\n \nTable A10.4: Sensitivity Analysis \n\nEconomic Internal \nRate of Return (%) \n\nNet Present \nValue  \n(K million) \n\nSwitching \nValue (%) \n\nSensitivity Test \nBase case \nReduce benefits by 10% \nIncrease costs by 10% \nIncrease costs by 10% and \nreduce benefits by 10% \n( ) = negative. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n14.05 \n12.37 \n12.53 \n\n10.95 \n\n5.52 \n0.98 \n1.53 \n\n(3.01) \n\n \n\n \n\n12.16 \n13.84 \n\n \nOverall,  the  Project  is  economically  viable,  even  with  the  assumption  of  zero  salvage \n17. \nvalue  after  25  years,  omission  of  unquantifiable  benefits,  and  adverse  changes  considered  in \nthe sensitivity analysis. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n59 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nCountry and Project Title: Papua New Guinea: Pilot Border Trade and Investment Development Project \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\n \n\nProject \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\n \n\nPacific Department \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nImprovement  of  trade  and  investment  is  identified  in  the  Medium  Term  Development  Strategy  2005\u20132010a  as  a  strategic \npriority  to  promote  export-driven  economic  growth  and  rural  development  (including  agriculture,  forestry,  fisheries,  and \ntourism)  on  a  sustainable  basis.  Encouraging  trade  and  investment  is  particularly  stated  in  the  strategy\u2019s  guiding  principles \nunder  (i)  least  developed  areas  intervention,  (ii)  empowering  Papua  New  Guineans  and  improving  skills,  and  (iii)  \u201csweat \nequity\u201d  and  Papua  New  Guinean  character.  Although  the  draft  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  is  silent  on  trade  and \ninvestment, it is indirectly incorporated in pillar three: improve and maintain physical infrastructure to facilitate access to social \nservices and income.  \n \nImprovement of trade and investment is one of the priorities of West Sepik Province (WSP) under its commerce, trade, and \nindustry plan. It is reflected in the soon-to-be finalized provincial development plan as well as the draft district development \nplans, which encourage creation of income-earning opportunities particularly in rural areas.  \n \nThe  Pilot  Border  Trade  and  Investment  Development  Project  will  contribute  to  promoting  economic  growth  and  social \ndevelopment in WSP, with extended benefits to Manus, East Sepik, Madang and Morobe provinces by providing a trade and \ninvestment-friendly environment and improved border facilities, and encouraging the cross-border trade with Papua Province \nof  Indonesia.  It  has  the  potential  to  translate  the  Bewani\u2013Vanimo\u2013Jayapura  road  into  an  economic  corridor.  The  improved \ntrade and investment-friendly environment and improved border facilities will allow for continued and increased trade volume \nto and from Indonesia  and faster and cheaper access to the large market across the  border for Papua New Guinea (PNG) \nproducts such as tinned goods, coffee, vanilla, and other agricultural produce from WSP and the northern coastal region as \nwell as imports of capital goods and consumables from Indonesia and other parts of Asia. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  strategy  and  program  for  PNG,  2006\u20132010,b  supported  the  Medium  Term \nDevelopment  Strategy.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  was  proposed  to  focus  on  (i) public  finance  management,  (ii)  private  sector \ndevelopment, (iii) the transport sector, and (iv) health and HIV/AIDS. The Project will contribute to private sector development \nand  HIV/AIDS  prevention  in  WSP  by  improving  the  business  environment  and  supporting  nongovernment  organizations\u2019 \nefforts in combating HIV/AIDS.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nPoverty estimates for PNG have not been updated since the last household survey in 1996. From 1996 to 2003, the number \nof Papua New Guineans living below $1/day is estimated to have doubled from 1.1 million to 2.2 million people. The poverty \nheadcount  index  for  the  $1/day  poverty  line  was  about  39.4%  in  2003,  up  from  24.6%  in  1996.  An  estimated  70%  of  the \npopulation, or 3.9 million Papua New Guineans, now live on less than $2/day, up from 54% in 1996. \n \nWSP\u2019s population  has increased from  about 130,000  in 1990 to  190,000 in 2000,  with the majority (92%)  of the population \nliving in rural areas. The crude population density is five people per square kilometer (km2), an increase from four persons per \nkm2  in  1990.  The  increasing  population  is  placing  considerable  pressures  on  the  province\u2019s  capacity  to  effectively  deliver \nbasic social services, infrastructure, and income opportunities\u2014particularly for those who live in the rural areas. This is seen \nto contribute to an increasing number of the rural population moving to urban areas and settling on illegal settlements on state \nand customary lands (58% of Vanimo communities).  \n \nIn  most  parts  of  the  province,  the  annual  per  capita  income  is  K50\u2013K70.  The  west  coast  villages  have  reported  a  higher \nincome  (on  average,  K500  fortnightly  per  household  or  K1,000  monthly  per  household)  than  the  sample  urban  households \n(K400  average  fortnightly  or  K800  monthly).  Given  the  average  household  size  of  seven,  this  income  represents  a  monthly \nper  capita  income  of  about  K140  or  annual  per  capita  income  of  K1,700.  This  could  be  explained  by  the  proximity  to  the \nborder, easy access to markets, and income opportunities for these communities.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nAccess  to  basic  social  services  by  the  province\u2019s  population,  especially  those  in  rural  areas,  is  poor.  About  20%  of  the \nprovince\u2019s  aid  posts  in  all  four  districts  are  closed;  66%  of  the  schools  are  run  by  churches.  Gender  enrollment  is  biased \ntoward males because of cultural norms that restrict females\u2019 status or role. Access to water supply for most people in the four \ndistricts  is  through  rainwater  tanks,  creeks,  and  streams.  There  are  no  sanitation  and  sewerage  treatment  facilities  in  all \ndistricts  in  the  province.  Reticulated  power  supply  is  only  in  Vanimo.  All  district  centers  rely  on  limited  capacity  generators, \nwhile most rural communities depend on kerosene lamps for power. Even with the reported increase in income by the west \ncoast communities, their living conditions are as poor as other parts of WSP. \n \nRoad connectivity is also poor. There is no road connection from the capital to its four districts or between the districts. There \nare only about 60 km sealed roads and about 1,400 km gravel road networks in the four districts\u2014restricting access to social \nservices and markets. In the poorest of the four districts (Telefomin), people have to  walk on average 6 hours to get to the \nnearest village, district center, or market. Overall, remoteness and isolation as well as limited trade and investment activities \nplay a significant role in the low level of access to services and income opportunities, particularly for the rural people in the \nprovince. \n \nWomen  provide  most  of  the  subsistence  agriculture  workforce.  Females  receive  less  education  and  medical  care.  Male \nchildren  are  allocated  a  far  greater  share  of  the  household  income  than  female  children.  Female  literacy  and  school \nenrollment rates in the province lag well behind those of male students, particularly those in rural areas, with 16% of males \nand 13% of females aged 5 and over attending school in 2000. Similar to the national trend, even  with a  women\u2019s national \npolicy  being  approved  in  1990,  female  participation  in  politics  and  public  service  management  is  still  minimal.  Domestic \nviolence against women in the province is common. \n \nThe  human  development  indicators  for  the  province  are  some  of  the  worst  for  the  country.  The  infant  mortality  rate  is  the \nfourth  highest  in  the  country  at  71  per  1,000  live  births\u2014higher  than  the  national  rate  of  67  per  1,000  live  births.c  Life \nexpectancy is 45.6 for men and 46.5 for women\u2014the lowest in the country.  \n \n2. Design Features.  \n \nThe  Project  includes  a  package  of  assistance  to  address  both  income  and  non-income  poverty.  Construction  of  the  border \nfacilities  and  promotion  of  trade  with  Indonesia  and  investment  will  help  stimulate  economic  activities  in  WSP,  create  job \nopportunities, and increase people\u2019s income.  \n \nThe  social  development  program  targets  alleviation  of  non-income  poverty.  It  comprises  (i)  power  connection  for  Wutung \nvillage, (ii) septic tank and individual household toilet for Wutung village, (iii) safe motherhood for five villages, (iv) education \nsupport  for  at-risk  children  for  five  villages,  and  (v)  HIV/AIDS  prevention.  All  components  except  (v)  will  be  implemented \nthrough modified cash transfer (MCCT),  which  will transfer cash  to the female  head or  a female adult of a household upon \ncompletion  of  the  relevant  intervention  activities.  HIV/AIDS  prevention  will  be  carried  out  by  Volunteer  Service  Overseas \n(international nongovernment organization) to change people\u2019s behavior. The program is expected to improve people\u2019s living \nconditions significantly and support people to venture into new businesses such as tourism, and reduce infant mortality and \nmaternal deaths in the target villages. \n\nThe capacity development component includes training programs for local people who are eager to learn and catch up with \ntheir Indonesian neighbors. It will help develop entrepreneurship and business skills and strengthen local people\u2019s capability \nin participating in and benefiting from the trade opportunities with Indonesia. At least 30% of the trainees will be women. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nPrimary  Beneficiaries.  The  primary  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  be  the  population  of  about  190,000  in  WSP,  92%  of \nwhom  live  in  the  rural  areas.  They  include  the  following  groups  of  people:  (i) an  estimated  700  households  living  in \ncommunities  along  the  road  connecting  the  border  to  the  town  of  Vanimo  (west  coast)  who  sell  a  range  of  agriculture \nproduces  and  PNG products  along the  border and Indonesian  goods to  Vanimo town as  well as those households  living in \n26 residential  and  settlements  in  Vanimo  urban  area;  (ii)  drivers  of  public  motor  vehicles  that  provide  a  range  of  transport \nservices  within  Vanimo  and  to  the  border;  (iii)  businesses  in  WSP,  including  informal  vendors,  trade  store  owners,  and  the \nhospitality industry; and (v) high school and/or technical school graduates in the province who may find employment resulting \nfrom the project activities.  \n \nPoor and vulnerable groups\u2014their needs, demands, constraints, and capacity. Most of people in WSP are poor in terms \nof access to income and basic social services. There is no reticulated power supply, no functional aid posts, and no proper \ntoilets.  Education  is  generally  limited  to  primary  school.  With  each  new  government  administration,  increasing  access  to \nincome opportunities and access to improved social services such as power, sanitation, water supply, and education continue \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n61 \n\nas their development priorities.d  \n \nPoor  access  to  basic  services,  particularly  health  and  education,  and  limited  employment  opportunities  were  the  main \nconstraints preventing men and women including out-of-school youths in the west coast and Vanimo urban area to participate \nfully in any community and provincial development priorities. In the 2000 census, for example, there are very low proportions \nof males and females ages 5\u201329 attending school (24% males and 20% females). In particular, a higher proportion of males \nthan females had been to school and completed grade 6 for age 10 and above (67% for males and 63% for females.) This \nillustrates the overall low educational attainment in the province for both genders, particularly for women. \n \nAccording to the National AIDS Council, the HIV prevalence rate in rural PNG is predicted to jump from 2.0% to 3.5% of the \npopulation by 2010. The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) estimated that within 20 years, up to 40% \nof the adult population would be living with HIV/AIDS. WSP had a total of 119 infected persons starting from 1987 to 2007, the \n12th highest among 19 PNG provinces. More women than men are affected\u2014there are 62 female cases and 45 male cases. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nDuring the process of identifying and designing the Project, consultations were held at various levels, involving a broad range \nof  stakeholder  groups  and  over  600  individuals.  The  consultations  were  conducted  in  the  form  of  (i)  a  large  stakeholder \nworkshop; (ii) key informant interviews at provincial, district, and village levels; (iii) focus group discussions; and (iv) a set of \nsample surveys of rural (west coast) and urban (Vanimo town) households. These consultations are the basis for the social \nand poverty analyses of the proposed Project. The insights obtained through the consultations have been incorporated into \nthe  project  design  in  the  form  of  a  participation  strategy  in  general  and  for  women,  and  in  the  mitigation  measures  and \ncomplementary actions to increase the Project\u2019s benefits received by the poor and other vulnerable groups. \n\n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nExtensive consultations have been done during the project preparation phase and are being institutionalized under the Project \nthrough the project design.  \n \nThe Border Development Authority (BDA) provincial management office (PMO) in Vanimo will include a community relations \nofficer  on  a  full-time  basis.  The  community  relations  officer  will  (i) disseminate  project  information  to  stakeholders  regularly, \nand (ii) consult with relevant provincial administration officials at various levels and villagers from Wutung and the other four \nwest  coast  villages  with  respect  to  the  social  development  program  of  the  project  and  training  programs.  The  Project  has \nincluded an international training specialist to develop annual training programs for 4 years in consultation with stakeholders. \nVolunteer  Service  Overseas  will  be  utilized  to  engage  people  in  constructive  dialogues  through  healthy  activities  such  as \nsports. The total budget is about $270,000. \n \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1. Key Issues.  Although there were reported improvements in decision making in the households where couples are starting \nto make joint decisions, men are still generally the main authority who make the final decision, particularly on (i) how much is \nspent; (ii) when to stop having children; and (iii) when money is limited, which child stays in school. Men\u2019s role is so closely \ntied with economic and social status that there is still a widely held view that women without husbands are considered to be in \nhardship and are often excluded from community decision making. \n \nDespite improvements in education, women\u2019s status (including in WSP) is still low compared to that of men. Women could not \nmake independent decisions, particularly on contraception. The husband has the final say if they will use any family planning \nmethod, even in cases of life-threatening pregnancies. \n \nWith the shift from an agricultural to cash economy, facilitated by access to the border, an increasing number of women are \nstarting  to  join  the  workforce  or  getting  involved  in  small-scale  businesses.  This  places  additional  responsibilities  and  is \ncausing stress on women and the whole family.  \n \nSimilar to other women in the province, women in west coast villages have limited access to income opportunities because of \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nlow  levels  of  skills,  lack  of  capital,  and  absence  of  reliable  market  information.  As  mentioned  previously,  most  business \nopportunities originate from the Indonesian border where their business counterparts are seen to have a considerable edge. \nThe  Indonesians  have  advanced  business  skills  (i.e.,  bargaining)  and  more  evolved  marketing  strategies  (i.e.,  offering \ncompetitive prices, variety, customer service) that the west coast villages still have to develop. External assistance is needed \nto bridge the skills gap to facilitate equal trading relationships. \n \n2.  Key Actions.
