An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nundertaken, and the summary IEE is a core appendix. \n \nThe Project will provide rural water supply and sanitation facilities \nand  services  to  about  1,000  communities  in  20  districts  in  the \nprovinces  of  West  Kalimantan,  Central  Kalimantan,  Jambi,  and \nBengkulu,  combined  with  capacity  building  for  districts  and \ncommunities,  and  sanitation  and  hygiene  behavioral  change \nprograms. The Project will provide an estimated 1.2 million people \nwith  safe  drinking  water,  of  whom  about  0.6 million  will  also \nbenefit  from  improved  sanitation  facilities.  An  additional  500 \ncommunities  in  Aceh  and  Nias-North  Sumatra  will  be  covered \nselection  at \nthrough  emergency  assistance.  Subproject \ncommunity level will combine elements of poverty targeting with a \ndemand-responsive  approach  to  ensure  sustainability  of  the \nfacilities.  \n \nProviding access to water and sanitation is an integral part of the \nGovernment\u2019s  efforts  in  improving  health  and  living  conditions  in \nIndonesia and meeting the related Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs).  Indonesia  has  made  progress  in  providing  water  and \nsanitation  services  to  its  people,  but  standards  remain  below \nthose  for  many  other  Southeast  Asian  countries.  The  great \nmajority  of  rural  and  poor  households  still  rely  on  self-provision \nthrough  groundwater  abstraction,  rainwater  collection,  or  use  of \nsurface  water,  with  little  government  effort  to  ensure  sustainable \nquantity  or  to  monitor  water  quality.  Sanitation  in  rural  areas  is \nlimited  to  simple  on-site  facilities,  and  a  large  percentage  of  the \nrural  population  still  rely  on  rivers,  beaches,  and  rice  fields  for \nopen air defecation. \n\nMany rural areas in Indonesia show high levels of waterborne and \nwater-related  diseases,  including  diarrhea,  intestinal  worms,  skin \ndisease,  and  malaria  and  dengue.  Poor  people,  and  particularly \nchildren,  women,  and  the  elderly  suffer  most  from  using  water \nunfit for human consumption and from poor hygiene practices and \nbehavior. \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nObjective \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nfacilitate  sustainable \n\nThe  Government  has  therefore  developed  a  National  Policy  for \nthe  Development  of  Community-Managed  Water  Supply  and \nEnvironmental Sanitation Facilities and Services, which highlights \nthe need for a demand-responsive approach to rural water supply \nand  sanitation.  In  line  with  this  policy,  the  proposed  Project \naddresses  the  four  major  issues  that  have  led  to  unsatisfactory \nresults  of  similar  past  projects:  capacity  of  local  governments  to \nplan  and \ninvestments;  ownership  and \ncapacity  of  communities  for  implementing  and  maintaining  new \nfacilities;  appropriate  financing  of  investments;  and  need  for \nchange  in  associated  hygiene  behavior,  which  reinforces  the \nhealth impact of investments. \n \nThe objective of the Project is to enhance the health status of low-\nincome  communities  in  rural  areas  based  on  better  hygiene \nbehavior  and  sustained  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and \nimproved  sanitation.  The  Project  aims  to  (i) improve  the  capacity \nof  local  governments  for  facilitating,  regulating,  and  delivering \nquality services in water and sanitation to the target communities; \n(ii) strengthen  the  community  capability  to  design,  cofinance, \nbuild,  operate,  and  manage  community-based  water  supply  and \nsanitation  facilities;  (iii) improve  access  to  water  and  sanitation \nservices  through  construction  of  adequate  facilities  based  on \ncommunity demand; and (iv) increase hygiene awareness through \ninformation, education, and communication campaigns. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  excluding  the  grant-financed  emergency \ncomponent  is  $92.4 million  equivalent,  of  which  $12.8 million \n(13.8%) is the foreign exchange cost and $79.6 million equivalent \n(86.2%) is the local currency cost. \n \n\nSource \n\nADB \n  OCR \n  ADF \nGovernment \n  Central Govt.a \n  District Govts. \nBeneficiaries \nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n12.45 \n7.98 \n4.47 \n0.32 \n0.13 \n0.19 \n0.00 \n12.77 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n52.24 \n26.12 \n26.12 \n21.77 \n11.63 \n10.14 \n5.61 \n79.62 \n\nTotal Cost \n\n% \n\n64.69 \n34.10 \n30.59 \n22.09 \n11.76 \n10.32 \n5.61 \n92.39 \n\n70.0 \n36.9 \n33.1 \n23.9 \n12.7 \n11.2 \n6.1 \n100.0 \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  ADF  =  Asian  Development  Fund,  Govt.  = \ngovernment, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \na   Includes provincial governments. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n\n \n\n\fv \n\n \n \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\nLoan Amount and Terms  The  Project  will  be  financed  by  two  loans  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  A  loan  of  $34.1 million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will \nhave  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  6  years,  an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. \n \nAnother loan of $30.6 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nwill be provided that will have a  maturity of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years. Interest will be charged at 1% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% thereafter.  \n \nThe  total  amount  of  $64.7 million  provided  by  ADB  will  cover \n97.5%  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  (70.0%  of  total  project  cost) \nand  65.6%  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  and  the \nbeneficiaries  will  provide  the  remaining  $27.7 million  equivalent, \namounting to 30.0% of the total project cost. \n \nThe Government will forward the loan proceeds as grants to local \ngovernments  participating  in  the  Project,  taking  into  account  the \nfact that the Project will directly benefit the poor and will focus on \nessential  water,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  services  that  do  not \ngenerate revenues. Participating local governments will contribute \nto  the  project  cost  in  accordance  with  their  fiscal  capacity. \nBeneficiaries will contribute in cash and in kind to the financing of \nconstruction  costs,  and  will  shoulder  all  operation  and \nmaintenance costs. \n \nUntil 31 December 2011 \n \n30 June 2011 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \nThe  Directorate  General  of  Communicable  Disease  Control  and \nEnvironmental  Health  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  will  be  the \nExecuting Agency for the Project. \n \nA central project management unit (CPMU) will be established at \nthe  Directorate  General  of  Communicable  Disease  Control  and \nEnvironmental  Health.  An  interministerial  steering  committee  will \nprovide  overall  guidance  to  the  Project  and  make  policy  and \nstrategic  decisions.  Provincial  coordinating  committees  will  assist \ndistrict  coordinating  teams  regarding  issues  that  cross  district \nboundaries. Each participating district will set up a district project \nmanagement  unit.  Participating  communities  will  set  up \ncommunity  implementation  teams  responsible  for  project-related \ncommunity  activities.  Consulting  services  will  provide  support  at \nthe central, provincial, district, subdistrict, and village levels. \n \n\n\fvi \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nfollow \n\ncontracted \n\nlevels.

It  is \nanticipated  that  there  will  be  no  procurement  by  international \ncompetitive  bidding.  Equipment  and  material  packages  valued  at \nfollowing \n$500,000  equivalent  or \ninternational  shopping  procedures.  Certain \nitems  valued  at \n$200,000 or less may be procured under local competitive bidding \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Packages  valued  at  $50,000 \nequivalent  or  less  will  be  procured  under  direct  purchasing \nprocedures.  Civil  works  contracts  will  be  small,  with  an  average \nvalue  of  $10,000\u201430,000  equivalent  and  will \nthe \nprocedures for community participation in procurement as outlined \nin ADB\u2019s Guide on Community Participation in Procurement. \n \nThe Project will finance 538 person-months of consulting services \nto  support  the  CPMU  (78  person-months  international  and  460 \ndomestic),  and  6,256  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  at \nlocal  community \nthe  provincial  and  district \nfacilitators  will  be \nfrom \ncommunity \nnongovernment  organizations \nimplementation \nnongovernment \norganizations  will  be  recruited \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  using  a  quality  and  cost-\nbased  selection  method  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to \nADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n \nThe  main  benefits  of  the  Project  will  be  (i) reduced  poverty  and \n(ii) increased \nincreased  health  benefits \ncommunity empowerment; and (iii) strengthened local government \ncapacity. \n \nReliable  access  to  safe  water  and  sanitation  facilities  will  save \ntime  and  effort  required  to  obtain  good  quality  water,  increasing \ntime  and  capacity  for  income-generating  activities.  Better  quality \nwater  and  improved  hygiene  behavior  will  reduce  the  incidence \nand  severity  of  waterborne  and  water-related  diseases, \nparticularly among infants, young children, and the elderly, leading \nto  a  reduction  in  sick  days  and  health-related  expenditures.  This \nwill  improve  levels  of  social  welfare,  and  facilitate  efforts  to \nimprove  the  economic  welfare  of  beneficiaries.  Given  the  high \nproportion  of  poor  households  in  the  target  districts,  and  the \nproposed targeting on the poorest locations within these districts, \nthe  incidence  of  poverty  among  project  beneficiaries  is  expected \nto be well over 50%. \n\nteams.

The Government, represented by the Directorate \nGeneral of Communicable Disease Control and Environmental Health of the Ministry of Health \n(MOH),  agreed  to  a  decentralized  investment  project  in  line  with  Indonesia\u2019s  strategies  and \npolicies for the rural water supply and sanitation sector. The Project has been designed to cover \nfour  provinces.  A  small-scale  technical  assistance  was  approved  in  February  2004  for  the \npreparation  of  additional  subprojects  to  increase  the  number  of  districts  covered  under  the \nProject in these provinces from 12 to 20.3 \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nProviding  access  to  clean  water  and  sanitation  is  seen  as  an  integral  part  of  overall \nefforts  to  improve  health  conditions  in  Indonesia.4  The  Government  is  firmly  committed  to \nmeeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), including the target of reducing by half the \nproportion of people without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 (MDG 7, \nTarget 10). \n \n4. \nIndonesia has made progress in providing clean water and basic sanitation services to \nits people, but standards remain below those of many other ADB developing member countries \n(DMCs). According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), about 55% of the \nIndonesian  population  had  access  to  improved  sanitation  and  78%  to  an  improved  source  of \ndrinking water in 2000.5 These percentages were higher than in some of the poorest countries in \nthe region such as Cambodia and the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), but below \nthose  for  other  Southeast  Asian  countries  such  as  the  Philippines  and  Thailand  (Appendix  2, \nTable  A2.1).  Following  the  economic  crisis  in  1997\u201398,  access  to  water  and  sanitation  has \nexperienced  little  progress,  as  new  investments  have  been  largely  postponed  and  existing \nsystems have deteriorated due to inadequate maintenance and repair.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The Project framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  ADB. 2002.

Human Development Report 2003. New York. Improved sanitation is defined as access to adequate \nexcreta disposal facilities, such as a connection to a sewer or septic tank system, a pour-flush latrine, a simple pit \nlatrine, or a ventilated improved pit latrine. Improved  water is defined as reasonable access (20 liters per person \nper day within 1 kilometer distance) to household connections, public standpipes, boreholes, protected dug wells, \nprotected springs, or rainwater collection.  \n\n\f2 \n\nAccording  to  the  2002 National  Socioeconomic  Survey  (SUSENAS)  only  about  15%  of \n5. \nrural  households  and  just  13%  of  households  in  the  lowest  expenditure  quintile  obtained \ndrinking  water  from  pipe  or  pump  (borehole)  sources.  The  great  majority  of  rural  and  poor \nhouseholds  still  rely  on  self-provision  through  shallow  groundwater  abstraction,  rainwater \ncollection, or use of surface water from nearby rivers or springs.6 Ensuring sustainable quantity \nor monitoring water quality remains a problem. The majority of households in Indonesia use on-\nsite facilities for sanitation as access to sewerage is restricted to partial coverage in a few urban \ncenters7 and is virtually nonexistent in peri-urban and rural areas. In rural areas only about 27% \nof  households  claimed  to  regularly  use  toilet  facilities,  and  only  21%  septic  tanks  for  final \ndisposal of human waste. As with water, the number of people with lack of access to adequate \nsanitation is much higher among the poor (Appendix 2, Table A2.2). \n \nMany rural and peri-urban areas in Indonesia have priority disease profiles that include \n6. \ndiarrhea, intestinal worms,8 skin disease, and other water-related diseases such as malaria and \ndengue.  Poor  people  in  remote  rural  areas,  and  particularly  children,  women,  and  the  elderly \namong them are more affected than others. While infant mortality rates under 5 have decreased \nsubstantially over the past decades, from 145 per 1,000 live births in 1967 to 35 in 2000, they \nare  still  above  those  of  other  Southeast  Asian  countries  such  as  Thailand  (25)  and  the \nPhilippines  (30).  Diarrhea  remains  the  second  largest  cause  of  death  among  young  children, \nand  is  the  main  reason  why  children  get  stunted,  particularly  at  12\u201324  months  of  age.  The \nsituation  results  from  inadequate  levels  of  access  to  clean  water  supply  and  sanitation, \ncombined with poor hygiene practices and behavior, such as disposal of human waste in rivers. \nThere  is  an  increasing  recognition  of  the  need  to  integrate  changes  in  hygiene  behavior  into \nwater and sanitation programs in order to increase the sustainability of the investments made.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n7. \nMost water supply development in Indonesia has traditionally been directed toward cities \nand  towns  under  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW).9  Regional  water  supply  enterprises \n(PDAM) are in charge of operating and maintaining piped water supply networks in urban areas, \nthough  their  performance  over  the  last  two  decades  has  been  largely  inadequate  in  terms  of \nfinancial sustainability and increasing coverage.  \n \n8. \nRural water supply development over the past decades has essentially been undertaken \nby  MOH,  assisted  by  multilateral  and  bilateral  funding  agencies,  and  focusing  on  traditional \nsources such as wells and rivers. While service coverage figures indicate a significant increase \nsince the 1980s, many facilities do not function properly and were quickly abandoned because \ncommunities were unable to operate and maintain them. \n \n9. \nBoth MPW and MOH have taken on some responsibility for sanitation, but neither one is \npresently in the position to lead a national effort toward reaching the sanitation-related target of \nthe MDG.  MPW has installed a large number of public communal bathing, washing, and toilet \nfacilities  in  subdistrict  towns  and  rural  areas.  However,  these  facilities  have  been  largely \nunsuccessful  in  achieving  the  intended  outcomes  due  to  a  lack  of  management  and \nmaintenance support either from local authorities or from intended beneficiaries. \n\n                                                 \n6  The  2002  SUSENAS  gave  the  following  for  rural  households:  container  (0.3%),  pipe  (6.2%),  pump  (9.0%), \nprotected  well  (36.9%),  protected  spring  (12.1%),  unprotected  well  (17.8%),  unprotected  spring  (7.9%),  river \n(5.5%), rainwater (3.9%), other (0.4%). \n\n7  Only seven cities have a sewerage network, which covers only parts of these cities. \n8  Such as ascariasis, dracunculiasis, hookworm, tapeworm, threadworm, and whipworm. \n9  Formerly the Ministry of Settlements and Regional Development. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nBased on these experiences and in line with the decentralization and regional autonomy \n10. \npolicies,  the  Government  in  2002  developed  a  National  Policy  for  the  Development  of \nCommunity-Managed Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Facilities and Services.10 The \npolicy,  which  is  to  be  issued  as  a  decree,  introduces  a  paradigm  change  toward  a  demand-\nresponsive  approach  for  water  and  sanitation  facilities  and  services,  and  advocates  a \nstrengthening of local government11 and community12 capacities in the provision of water supply \nand  sanitation  services,  together  with  sanitation  and  hygiene  behavioral  change  (SHBC) \nprograms in the communities. \n \n11.  With  decentralization,  local  governments  became  responsible  for  delivering  basic \nservices to their communities. However, many of them have very limited capacities and require \nsupport to facilitate and finance necessary investments. Similarly, communities need support for \nplanning,  implementing,  operating,  and  maintaining  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation \nfacilities. Numerous studies and projects in and outside Indonesia have demonstrated that the \ninvolvement  of  the  community  in  the  decision-making,  implementation,  and  maintenance \nprocess correlates positively with the sustainability of improved services. \n \n12. \nIn  the  past,  the  lack  of  attention  on  SHBC  has  led  to  inconsistent  use  of  the  facilities \nprovided, reducing the positive impact of the improvements on the communities\u2019 health. Recent \n\u201cnew  generation\u201d  projects  such  as  the  ongoing  World  Bank  Second  Water  and  Sanitation  for \nLow  Income  Communities  Project  (WSLIC-II)13  and  the  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation \nProject  for  Nusa  Tenggara  Timur  (ProAir)14  combine  hygiene  and  prevention  of  waterborne \ncommunicable  diseases,  improved  water  services,  and  sustainability  of  services  through \ncommunity participation.15  \n \n13. \nKey  lessons  learned  from  demand-driven,  community-based,  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation  projects  in  Indonesia  and  other  Asian  countries  focus  on  the  importance  of \n(i) manageable geographic coverage of a project; (ii) a simple water and sanitation technology \nmenu for communities to chose from; (iii) the engagement of communities in the whole project \ncycle;  (iv) an  extensive  use  of  community \nfor \nconstruction,  and  full  responsibility  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs;  (vi) more \nemphasis  on  hygiene  behavioral  change  programs;  and  (vii) close  monitoring  of  construction \nquality  and  transparent  project  administration  and  procurement  procedures.16  In  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  policy,  the  proposed  Project  addresses  the  four  major  issues  behind  the \nweakness  of  similar  past  projects:  capacity  of  local  governments  to  plan  and  facilitate \nsustainable  investments;  ownership  and  capacity  of  communities  in  implementing  and \nmaintaining  investments;  appropriate  financing  of  investments;  and  need  for  change  in \nassociated  hygiene  behavior,  which  capitalizes  on  investments  and  reinforces  their  health \nimpact. The Project will be the Government\u2019s first major community water services project since \ndecentralization in January 2001, and the first after developing the National Policy. \n \n                                                 \n10 MPW, MOH, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Finance, National Development Planning Agency. 2002.

The purpose of \nthe Project is to provide sustained access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation, and to \nimprove  the  hygiene  behavior  of  low-income  communities  in  rural  and  peri-urban  areas.  The \nProject  will  improve  district  government  capacity  to  facilitate  and  regulate  basic  water  and \nsanitation  services;  empower  communities \nfor  developing  and \nimplementing  such  services  based  on  a  demand-driven,  community-based  approach;  and \nincrease  awareness  about  appropriate  healthy  and  hygienic  behavior.  The  Project  will  cover \nabout 1,000 communities in 20 districts in four provinces: West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, \nJambi, and Bengkulu. Selection of provinces and districts is based on a transparent process of \nprioritization  and  selection  criteria  agreed  upon  between  the  Government,  ADB,  and  major \nstakeholders.  All  districts  have  prepared  subproject  appraisal  reports  in  accordance  with \nMinistry of Finance decree No. 35/2003 (KMK 35).17 In addition, in light of the earthquake and \ntsunami  tidal  waves  that  hit  Indonesia  and  in  particular  the  provinces  of  Aceh  and  Nias-North \nSumatra on 26 December 2004, and based on the Memorandum of Understanding between the \nGovernment  of  Indonesia  and  ADB  dated  5  January  2005,  the  Project  will  also  include  an \nemergency assistance grant for these provinces, covering about five districts and approximately \n500 communities. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n15. \nThe  Project  consists  of  four  components:  (i) District  and  Subdistrict  Capacity  Building, \n(ii) Community  Empowerment,  (iii) Community-based  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Facilities, \nand (iv) Sanitation and Hygiene Behavioral Change. \n \n\n1. \n\nDistrict and Subdistrict Capacity Building \n\n16. \nComponent  1  will  improve  local  government  capacity  for  facilitating,  regulating,  and\u2014\nwhere  necessary\u2014delivering  quality  services  in  water,  sanitation,  and  health  to  the  targeted \ncommunities.  A  simplified  quality  management  approach  will  be  used  to  help  catalyze \ndevelopment activities that go beyond the activities directly related to the Project. To participate \nin the Project, districts will have to show commitment to reform that includes self-assessment of \ntheir  service  capacity;  identification,  formulation,  and  implementation  of  priority  quality \nmanagement projects; good governance; and a dedication to evaluate and learn from results. \n \n17. \nExisting  training  and  education  facilities  at  the  provincial  and  district  level  will  be  used \nwherever  appropriate.  District  governments  will  be  assisted  in  establishing  their  own  human \nresource development plan. Training modules will include strategic and leadership issues, such \nas  management  by  objectives  and  community-driven  development;  technical  issues  such  as \nquality  assurance  for  laboratories,  basics  of  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and  water \ntreatment; and computer skills. Capacity building on advocacy will also be provided to members \nof the local legislative assemblies to facilitate informed decisions about water supply, sanitation, \nand health-related investments. \n\n                                                 \n17 A  summary  description  of  four  pilot  subproject  appraisal  reports  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D.  Executive \nsummaries  of  all  20  subproject  appraisal  reports  are  also  in  Appendix  18  of  the  Project  Administration \nMemorandum.  \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\n2. \n\nCommunity Empowerment \n\nthe  approval  of \n\nLocal  community \n\n18. \nEfforts  to  strengthen  the  capacities  of  rural  people  are  by  definition  community-based. \nThe  second  component  will  strengthen  community  capabilities  to  develop,  cofinance,  build, \noperate,  and  maintain  community-based  water  supply  and  sanitation facilities.  The  Project  will \nfocus on (i) advocacy and awareness-raising regarding community water supply, sanitation, and \nhygiene in target villages; (ii) formal confirmation of a village\u2019s commitment to participate in the \nProject,  and \nthe  respective  districts;  (iii) formation  of  a  community \nimplementation  team  (CIT)18  with  members  drawn  from  community  stakeholders  in  a \ntransparent and inclusive manner; (iv) conducting village problem mapping to determine issues \nand  possible  solutions;  (v) formulation  of  a  community  action  plan  (CAP),  which  will  be  a \ndetailed plan on how to address the identified water supply, sanitation, and health problems at \nan  appropriate  level  of  technology  and  a  reasonable  budget  level;  (vi) signing  of  a  project-\nrelated contract between communities and districts; and (vii) organizing community groups and \nmembers to implement  and monitor water supply and sanitation improvements, and sanitation \nand hygiene behavioral change programs.  \n \n19. \nrepresentatives  of \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  will  carry  out,  and  assist  communities,  in  these \nproject  activities.  They  will  focus  on  genuine  empowerment  of  villagers  to  direct  their  own \ndevelopment by addressing their lack of information, education, skills, and physical well-being. \nCommunity  facilitators  will  undergo  an  initial  3-month  training  course  to  (i) improve  their \nmanagement  and  interpersonal  skills  as  facilitators;  (ii) provide  them  with  sufficient  technical \nunderstanding  of  water,  sanitation,  and  related  hygiene  issues;  (iii) train  them  in  poverty \nanalysis and targeting, and a variety of participatory techniques; and (iv) help them successfully \nassist  communities  with  day-to-day  issues  they  encounter  during  project  implementation,  in \nparticular  related  to  O&M.  Refresher  courses  will  be  given  periodically  to  meet  specific  needs \nthat  will  be  identified  as  the  Project  progresses.  Community  facilitators  who  have  successfully \ncompleted training will be assigned in teams of three, consisting of one community mobilization \nfacilitator, one water supply and sanitation engineer, and one sanitation and hygiene promotion \nspecialist. At least one out of the three team members will be female. Each team will cover five \nvillages on average per year, depending on the size, remoteness, and geographic spread of the \nvillages.  Productivity  and  effectiveness  of  the  community  facilitators  will  be  closely  monitored, \nand nonperforming facilitators will be replaced.19 \n \n\nfacilitators  will  be  either \n\nindividuals  or \n\n3. \n\nCommunity\u2013Based Water Supply and Sanitation Facilities \n\n20. \nThe  Project  will  finance  the  construction  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  schemes  in \napproximately  1,000  communities,  including  the  rehabilitation  of  existing  facilities  where \nfeasible. The main technical options for water supply schemes under the Project are (i) gravity \npipe  systems  from  spring,  (ii) gravity  pipe  systems  from  spring  with  booster  pumping, \n(iii) pumping  from  a  river  with  slow  sand  treatment  and  chlorination,  (iv) deep  wells  and \nboreholes  with  pumps  and  public  standpipes,  (v) medium-depth  boreholes  with  small  pumps \nand  storage  tanks,  (vi) dug  wells,  (vii) hand-pump  wells,  (viii) rainwater  harvesting  units,  and \n(ix) simple water treatment units.  \n \n                                                 \n18 The  CIT  will  act  as  the  management  committee  described  in  ADB\u2019s  Guide  on  Community  Participation  in \nProcurement,  and  will  be  responsible  for  entering  into  a  contract  with  the  DPMU.  It  will  be  composed  of  a  water \nservices unit, a hygiene and sanitation unit, and a finance and administration unit. \n\n19 The decision to replace a facilitator will be based on well-defined criteria and will be taken jointly by the consultant \n\nemploying the facilitator, the DPMU, and the provincial project secretariat. \n\n\f6 \n\nThe  main  options  for  sanitation  are  (i) ventilated  improved  pit  latrines,  (ii) pour-flush \n21. \ntoilets, and (iii) pour-flush toilets with septic tanks. The Project will support the development of \nsanitation  facilities  by  providing  a  subsidy  for  latrine  construction  for  the  poorest  10%  of \nhouseholds  per  village.  The  Project  will  also  finance  the  development  of  simple  drainage, \nwashing platforms, soak pits, and bathing and washing steps along rivers and canals.  \n \n22.  With  the  assistance  and  advice  from  community  facilitators,  communities  will  choose \nfrom  the  above  menu  the  feasible  technical  option(s)  that  they  consider  to  be  the  most \ntechnology;  raw  water  source; \nappropriate  based  on \nenvironmental, social, and institutional/management issues; and O&M costs. Technical manuals \nand guidelines prepared by MOH, MPW, and similar previous projects20 will be adapted for the \nProject  by  the  Executing  Agency  (EA).  For  these  investments,  communities  will  receive  funds \nwith  a  maximum  ceiling  of  Rp250 million  (about  Rp220 million  for  water  supply  facilities  and \nRp30 million  for  community  health  and  sanitation  facilities)  per  village.21  Communities  will \ncontribute in cash and in kind at least 20% of construction costs, and will be responsible for all \nO&M costs. Household surveys undertaken during the PPTA and similar recent projects such as \nWSLIC-II  suggest  that  the  average  willingness  and  capability  to  pay  on  a  monthly  basis  are \nsufficient to finance O&M costs of most technical options.  \n \n\ninformation  provided  regarding \n\n4. \n\nSanitation and Hygiene Behavioral Change \n\n23. \nThis  component  will  promote  SHBC  to  maximize  the  health  impact  of  project \ninvestments  in  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  waterborne  and \nwater-related diseases in the project area through improved practices. The Project will adopt the \nhygiene improvement framework,22 use the methodology for participatory assessment (MPA)23 \nand participatory hygiene and sanitation transformation (PHAST)24 techniques, and build on the \nBasic  Sanitation  Package  developed  by  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund.25  Activities  focus \non (i) a school health and sanitation program, (ii) hygiene promotion at religious facilities, (iii) a \ncommunity hygiene program, and (iv) a home water treatment and storage program.  \n \n24. \nActivities will be designed for specific target groups\u2014women, mothers of young children, \nboys  and  girls  of  school  age,  out-of-school  children\u2014applying  a  user-friendly  approach  that \ntakes into account issues of gender as well as the culture and language of indigenous peoples. \nWhere  appropriate,  the  component  will  adopt  existing  materials  from  Indonesia  and  other \ncountries and create links to ongoing activities of other organizations. Implementation of these \nactivities  will  precede,  run  in  parallel,  and  follow  up  on  the  construction  of  water  supply  and \nsanitation facilities to ensure maximum benefits.  \n \n\n                                                 \n20 For example, MPW\u2019s 2003 Guide to Prepare Design and Construction for Water Supply and Sanitation Facilities for \n\nVillages; and WSLIC-II\u2019s Guide to Construction of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Facilities. \n\n21 CAPs requesting larger amounts can be considered if adequate technical and financial justification is provided, and \n\nwill require ADB approval. \n\n22 The hygiene improvement framework is an integrated approach that combines expanded access to hardware with \n\nhygiene promotion and support to an enabling institutional framework to reduce diarrheal disease. \n\n23 Developed in 1998 by the Water and Sanitation Program and the International Water and Sanitation Centre. \n24 PHAST tools developed by the World Bank involve six steps: problem identification, problem analysis, planning for \nsolutions,  selecting  options,  planning  for  new  facilities  and  behavioral  change,  and  participatory  monitoring  and \nevaluation. \n\n25 The basic sanitation package provides implementation guidelines for community sanitation and hygiene awareness \nprograms  to  increase  knowledge  and  improve  facilities  and  practices  of  the  population.  It  will  be  adapted  for  the \nProject to be compatible with the participatory planning and M&E process set out in component 2. \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n25. \nCommunity-Driven Participatory Approach. The Project relies on a community-driven \nparticipatory  approach.  Communities  decide  on  the  type  of  technology  to  be  used,  plan  and \nimplement  the  activity  with  the  assistance  of  community  facilitators,  take  charge  of  O&M  on  a \npermanent  basis,  and  monitor  and  evaluate  the  sustainability  and  use  of  the  new  services. \nCommunities are required to demonstrate their commitment by contributing at least 20% of the \ntotal  capital  cost  (16%  in  kind,  4%  in  cash)  of  the  investment  in  water  supply  and  sanitation \nfacility  construction,  and  by  covering  all  O&M  costs.  The  Project  will  provide  training  to \nbeneficiaries  in  design  and  construction,  financial  management,  and  O&M,  which  will  help \nensure  sustainability  of  the  newly  constructed  facilities,  and  provide  communities  with  skills  to \ninitiate other community activities and improvements. Since civil works contracts will be mostly \nsmall,  community-based  contracting  will  be  allowed  following  ADB\u2019s  Guide  on  Community \nParticipation  in  Procurement.26  Direct  fund  channeling  of  community  funds  has  proven  to \nsubstantially speed up the flow of funds to the ultimate beneficiaries for community-based civil \nworks contracting. The fund-flow mechanism is outlined in Appendix 5. \n \n26. \nSelecting  Project  Locations  and  Targeting  Beneficiaries.  Provinces  and  districts \nwere selected using a screening process based on financial capacity, poverty incidence, health \nconditions,  water  and  sanitation  conditions,  and  political  commitment \nto  civil  society \ninvolvement, transparent project management, and stakeholder participation\u2014in line with ADB\u2019s \npolicies on governance. Within target districts a similar approach has been applied to define a \nlong-list  of  villages  in  each  district  (Appendix  6).  Community  facilitators  will  be  sensitized  to \nconcerns related to poverty, gender, and indigenous social or cultural issues27 to maximize the \nparticipation  of  women,  poor  households,  and  other  marginal  groups.  The  CAPs  will  need  to \ndemonstrate how the views of all segments of the community have been incorporated. \n \n27. \nGender  Focus.  A  summary  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  is  attached  in  Appendix  8.  The \nkey  strategies  underlining  the  GAP  include:  (i) active  involvement  of  women  as  implementors \nand  beneficiaries  during  community  consultations,  workshops,  and  focus  group  discussions, \nfocusing on the participation of poor women, female household heads, and mothers with infants \nand young school children; (ii) engagement of women organizations, teachers, village midwives, \nhealth  volunteers,  and  other  women  activists,  for  information,  education,  and  communication \n(IEC)  campaigns;  (iii) engagement  of  at  least  one  female  community  facilitator  per  team  to \nattract  women\u2019s  active  participation  in  IEC  campaigns  and  the  implementation  of  behavioral \nchange;  (iv) adequate  representation  of  women  on  the  CIT  to  ensure  that  CAPs  adequately \nreflect women\u2019s interests; and (v) specific training activities for village women.  \n \n28. \nImplementation  arrangements  will  enhance \ntransparency of project operations; increase accountability, quality control and assurance; and \nminimize the risk of funds diversion in the areas of (i) procurement of consulting services, goods \nand  materials,  and  civil  works;  (ii) construction  supervision  and  quality  control;  and \n(iii) monitoring and evaluation (M&E).28 Methods to improve consultant procurement procedures \nwill include training of procurement committee members, pre-bid conferences, external reviews \n\nTransparency  and  Accountability. \n\n                                                 \n26 See Appendix 2 of ADB Project Administration Instructions No. 3.05 and the Project Administration Memorandum \n\nfor details. \n\n27 An indigenous peoples development framework has been prepared and is in Appendix 7. \n28 Details are in the Project Administration Memorandum. Recommendations of the Final Report of advisory technical \nassistance (ADTA) 3842-INO (ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Strengthening the \nCapacity  of  Ministry  of  Settlements  and  Regional  Infrastructure  to  Combat  Fraud  and  Corruption.  Manila)  were \ntaken into account. \n\n\f8 \n\nof proposals, and thorough reference checking on consultant candidates as part of the proposal \nreview.  For  goods  and  services,  a  unit  cost  study  will  be  carried  out  at  the  start  and  updated \nregularly  to  ensure  cost-effective  and  market-based  construction  budgets.  All  construction \ncontracts will be publicly displayed in the communities, as will construction budgets, engineering \ndesigns,  work  schedules,  and  required  and  actual  community  contributions,  with  grievance \nmechanisms  in  place.  As  regards  M&E,  community  members  and  their  facilitators  will  receive \nM&E training during the CAP planning phase to enable them to judge the quality of consultants \nand of construction. Process monitoring consultants (PMCs) will be placed at the district level to \nmonitor  and  address  implementation  problems  and  to  carry  out  post-construction  technical \naudits focusing on quality and cost-effectiveness of the infrastructure in each community. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n29. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  to  be  $92.4 million  equivalent,  comprising \n$12.8 million  (13.8%)  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $79.6 million  (86.2%)  equivalent  in  local \ncurrency cost.

The OCR \nloan will have a term of 25 years with a grace period of 6 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per \nannum,  conversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  loan  regulations \nand  conversion  guidelines,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  Loan  and \nProject Agreements. The ADF loan will have a term of 32 years with a grace period of 8 years. \nInterest  rate  charge  on  the  ADF  funds  is  1%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i) the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n \n31. \nADB will cover 97.5% of the foreign exchange cost of the Project and 65.6% of the local \ncurrency cost, excluding taxes. The Government and the beneficiaries will provide $22.1 million \nand $5.6 million equivalent, amounting to 23.9% and 6.1% of the project cost, respectively. The \nfinancing  of  local  currency  costs  by  ADB  is  justified  by  the  nature  of  the  Project,  which  will \naddress  regional  poverty,  gender  concerns,  and  environmental  health  issues  in  the  project \nareas, as well as assist in achieving the water- and sanitation-related MDGs. ADB funding will \ncover  the  construction  of  village  water  supply  and  sanitation  systems,  health  and  hygiene \nawareness  campaigns,  training  for  local  government  staff  and  community  members,  and \nconsulting  services.  The  summary  of  the  financing  plan  for  the  Project  is  in  Table  2.

A central project management unit (CPMU) will be established at the EA. A \nsteering  committee,  chaired  by  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS)  and \nincluding  representatives  from  MOH,  MPW,  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs, \nMinistry of Environment, and Ministry of National Education, will provide guidance to the Project \nand make policy and strategic decisions. The organization chart is in Appendix 10. \n \n33. \nThe CPMU will be responsible for (i) project management, monitoring, and supervision, \nand  liaison  with  other  ministries  and  ADB;  (ii) preparing  and  managing  the  annual  project \nbudget; (iii) assisting the Borrower in the competitive procurement of consulting services for the \ncentral  support  team  (CST),  provincial  support  teams  (PSTs),  district  support  teams  (DSTs), \ncommunity  facilitator  teams  (CFTs),  and  individual  consultants;  (iv) establishing  detailed \nimplementation  guidelines  for  administration,  technical  support,  and  institutional  capacity \nstrengthening;  (v) disseminating  information  to  local  government  agencies,  institutions,  and \ncommunities  involved  in  the  Project;  (vi) undertaking  M&E  activities;  (vii) submitting  periodic \nproject progress and financial reports; and (ix) ensuring implementation of the GAP. The CPMU \nwill  be  fully  assisted  by  the  CST  consisting  of  international  and  national  consultants  with \nexpertise  in  project  management,  finance  and  accounting,  contract  management,  SHBC,  rural \nwater supply and sanitation, institutional capacity building, water quality monitoring, and quality \nassurance. The CST will be physically located within the CPMU. \n \n\nb. \n\nProvince Level \n\n34. \nA  provincial  coordination  committee  appointed  by  the  Governor  and  chaired  by  the \nprovincial development planning agency (BAPPEDA) will support the district coordinating teams \nand resolve cross-jurisdictional issues among districts. A project secretariat will be established \nto act as the main contact at the provincial level for the CPMU, to receive instructions from the \nCPMU, and to pass them on to the coordinating committee and appropriate agencies. A three-\nperson PST in each of the four provinces consisting of specialists in administration, finance, and \nmonitoring;  water  and  sanitation  engineering;  and  institutional  capacity  building  will  provide \nsupport to the district- and community-level consultants. \n \n\nc. \n\nDistrict and Subdistrict Level \n\nIn  each  participating  district,  a  district  project  management  unit  (DPMU)  will  be \n35. \nestablished, headed by the head of the district health office and staffed with members from the \nparticipating  agencies  (Health  Office,  Public  Works  Office,  Community  Empowerment  Office, \nEnvironmental  Office,  and  Education  Office).  Its  main  responsibilities  will  be  to  (i) manage  all \nproject-related activities at the district level and below; (ii) monitor and evaluate project activities \nto assure quality of project outputs, and ensure that monitoring data are properly collected and \npassed to the CPMU on schedule; (iii) work closely with the consultant teams at the provincial, \ndistrict,  and  community  levels  to  ensure  that  required  services  are  provided  in  a  timely  and \nprofessional  manner  to  communities  participating  in  the  Project;  (iv) process  and  sign  the \ncontract  with  individual  communities  for  the  release  of  village  funds;  and  (v) act  as  the \nsecretariat of the district coordinating team. \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nfrom \n\nThe district coordinating teams will be the same that were  appointed during subproject \n36. \nappraisal reports preparation by the district head, chaired by BAPPEDA, and consist of district \ngovernment  representatives \nthe  Health  Office,  Public  Works  Office,  Community \nEmpowerment Office/Village Community Development Office, Education Office, Environmental \nOffice,  and community  representatives.  The  district  coordinating  team  will  provide  guidance  to \nthe DPMU and consultants at the district and village levels, and liaise with the CPMU. \n \n37. \nIn  each  participating  district  there  will  be  a  DST  that  will  provide  support  to  the  DPMU \nand  to  the  CFTs  working  with  participating  communities.  The  DST  will  consist  of  three \nspecialists  in  community  empowerment,  water  and  sanitation  engineering,  and  SHBC  and \ntraining.  In  addition,  there  will  be  one  PMC  in  each  district  to  monitor  and  address \nimplementation problems at the district level and below. \n \n38. \nCross-sector  coordination  teams  will  also  be  set  up  at  the  subdistrict  level  to  support \ncoordination  among  villages.  The  composition  of  these  teams  will  mirror  that  of  the  district \ncoordination teams and will include the head of subdistrict and representatives of the community \nhealth  centers.  Community  health  centers  will  be  involved  in  particular  in  the  SHBC  activities, \ngiven  the  fact  that  they  are  already  offering  advisory  services  on  sanitation  in  the  context  of \nMOH\u2019s sanitation clinic program. \n \n\nd. \n\nCommunity Level \n\n39. \nIn  each  participating  community,  a  CIT  will  be  established  and  will  be  responsible  for \nensuring the full involvement of the community in all project-related planning, training, choice of \nfacilities and services, cofinancing, design and construction, SHBC, and O&M. Women will be \nadequately represented on the CITs. \n \n40. \nThe CITs will be supported by CFTs working at subdistrict and village level. CFTs with \nexpertise in community mobilization, rural water supply and sanitation engineering, and SHBC \nand  training,  will  be  recruited  either  in  an  individual  capacity  or  as  representatives  of  NGOs. \nCFTs will be mobilized after receiving intensive training as described in para. 19. Approximately \n40 CFTs will be hired to provide support to the selected 20 districts. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n41. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years.  Communities  will  be  grouped  into  four \nbatches,  with  the  first  batch  having  about  40  communities.  Community-level  activities  will  be \nimplemented  in  2-year  cycles  consisting  of  information  and  socialization  of  the  Project; \nestablishment of the CIT; preparation of the CAP; and construction and complementary training \nin O&M, M&E, and SHBC. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n42. \nAll procurement of goods and services financed under the Project will be carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  the  Government\u2019s  procurement \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. It is expected that international competitive bidding will not be \nrequired  due  to  the  small  size  of  contracts.  Equipment  and  material  packages  valued  at \n$500,000  equivalent  or  less  will  be  procured  following  international  shopping  procedures. \nCertain  items  costing  the  equivalent  or  less  than  $200,000  may  be  procured  under  local \ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. Packages valued at $50,000 equivalent or \nless  will  be  procured  under  direct  purchasing  procedures.  Civil  works  contracts  will  be  small, \n\n\f12 \n\nwith an average value of $10,000\u201330,000 equivalent, and will follow community participation in \nprocurement in ADB\u2019s Guide on Community Participation in Procurement. The first two of these \ncivil works contracts in each province will be subject to ADB approval. Subsequently, the DPMU \nwill  maintain  specified  documents29  for  review  by  ADB.  The  proposed  procurement  packages \nare listed in Appendix 12. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nConsulting  services  will  comprise  538  person-months  of  long-term  and  intermittent \n43. \nconsultants  to  support  the  CPMU  (78  person-months  international  and  460  person-months \ndomestic), and 6,256 person-months of domestic consultants for the PSTs, DSTs, and PMCs. \nThe PSTs will subcontract suitable individuals and/or NGOs30 as CFTs to assist the CITs in the \nplanning, implementation, and monitoring of their CAPs. The CST will consist of one consulting \npackage.  There  will  be  four  regional  consultant  packages,  one  per  province,  including  four \nPSTs, 20 DSTs, and 40 CFTs. The four packages will be contracted at the provincial level, with \nmembers  of  the  central  Government  on  the  selection  committee  and  with  assistance  from  the \nCST.  All  consultants  to  be  financed  under  the  loans  will  be  recruited as  firms  or individuals  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using the quality and cost-based \nselection method or other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \nDetailed terms of reference are in Appendix 13. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n44. \nDisbursement arrangements will ensure that funds reach the intended beneficiaries (i.e., \nthe communities and district governments) in an  efficient and effective manner, in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  It  is  envisaged  that  the  direct  payment  and  the \nimprest account procedures will be used. Imprest accounts will be established for both loans in \nBank  Indonesia,  with  an  initial  combined  advance  ceiling  of  $2.3 million.31  Liquidation  and \nreplenishment  of  the  imprest  accounts  will  be  based  on  the  actual  releases  to  the  village \ncontractors and suppliers, and individual village members. Disbursement arrangements are as \nfollows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nFor  CPMU,  provincial  secretariat  and  DPMU  activities,  the  direct  payment  and \nthe  imprest  account  procedures  will  be  used,  the  latter  with  a  statement  of \nexpenditures limit of $50,000 to cover small expenditures; the CPMU will review \nand certify all direct payment and statement of expenditure claims to be financed \nby ADB; and \n\nFor village-level investments, the Government will utilize the imprest accounts as \npass-through  accounts  to  make  payments  directly  to  individual  bank  accounts \nheld  by  the  CITs.  The  latter  will  be  highlighted  in  the  withdrawal  applications. \nThese  community  funds  will  have  a  maximum  ceiling  of  Rp250 million  (about \nRp220 million  for  water  supply  facilities  and  Rp30 million  for  community  health \nand  sanitation  facilities)  per  village.  Disbursement  will  be  subject  to  the \nestablishment  of  a  CIT,  an  approved  CAP,  a  signed  contract  between  the  CIT \nand the DPMU, and deposit of the community\u2019s cash contribution in the CIT bank \n\n                                                 \n29 These  include  the  CAP,  bid  invitation  letters,  bid  opening  statements,  bid  evaluation  reports  or  approval \n\ndocuments, and signed contracts between the CIT and the contractors, where applicable. \n\n30 Selection  criteria  will  include  province/district  origin  or  at  least  presence,  and  evidence  of  a  track  record  in \n\ncommunity-based projects. \n\n31 Based on the average number of villages with approved CAPs per 6-month period at Rp250 million per village. The \n\ninitial imprest account advance for the OCR loan will be $1.1 million and for the ADF loan $1.2 million. \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\naccount.  Funds  will  be  released  in  tranches  of  30%,  40%,  and  30%,  based  on \nverification  of  actual  implementation  progress  by  the  DPMUs  and  the  PMCs. \nDPMUs will monitor community bank accounts and provide the CPMU with bank \naccount  statements  and  supporting  documents  for  consolidation  10  days  after \nthe  end  of  every  month.  Proposed  fund-flow  arrangements  for  the  community \nfunds are given in Appendix 5. \n\n \n45. \nNo disbursement of loan proceeds will be made to a participating district and/or village \n(i) if a misprocurement has been declared by ADB or procurement actions have been identified \nas irregular, until the misprocurement or other irregularity has been corrected by the concerned \ndistrict  and/or  village  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Government  and  ADB;  and  (ii) until  a  DPMU \nand/or a CIT, as applicable, has been established and is fully staffed. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n46. \nThe  EA  has  implemented  a  number  of  similar  projects  financed  by  ADB  and  others \nduring the last 5 years, and its financial management capacity is considered adequate. The EA \nwill  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation  within  30  days  of \neach calendar quarter period. The Progress reports will be in English and include information on \ndisbursement and physical progress of works and the status of support programs.  \n \n47. \nThe Directorate General of Communicable Disease Control and Environmental Health of \nMOH and the provincial and district governments will maintain accounts and records showing a \nclear link between activities and expenditures related to the Project. They will be assisted by an \nadequate  number  of  suitably  qualified  accounting  staff,  including  a  financial  manager  in  the \nCPMU  who  will  establish  project  accounting  and  recording systems  and  train  staff to  maintain \nthe  systems.  Auditors  will  annually  audit  all  accounts  and  statements  of  revenues  and \nexpenditure related to the Project, in accordance with auditing standards acceptable to ADB and \nusing  international  accounting  and  auditing  standards  as  a  benchmark.  Audited  financial \nstatements and project accounts, together with the report of the auditor, will be submitted within \n6 months of the close of the financial year. A separate audit opinion on the imprest accounts will \nbe included in the annual audit report.  \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n48. \nTo  ensure  that  subprojects  are  implemented  and  managed  effectively  and  that  project \nbenefits  are  maximized,  a  draft  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  has  been \ndeveloped  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  PPMS  Handbook  and  project  objectives.  The  PPMS  will \nassist  the  Project  in  community-based  initiatives  and  interventions  through  a  participatory \napproach.32  Indicators  and  methodology  for  capacity  building  of  government  agencies  and \ncommunities,  water  improvement,  sanitation,  hygiene,  health,  financial  management,  and \nproject management are incorporated in the design of the system to facilitate the M&E of project \nbenefits.  Data  collection  for  the  PPMS  will  be  undertaken  by  the  PMCs  and  one  member  of \neach CFT, with the latter being in charge of data collection and analysis related to the status of \nactivities at the community level. \n \n\n                                                 \n32 The participatory planning, monitoring, and evaluation approach is based on the approach developed under ADB. \n2000.

Quarterly  village  progress  reports  will  be  synthesized  at  the  district  level,  and \nsummarized into one report for submission to the EA within 15 days of the end of the quarter. A \ncomprehensive  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out  by  the  Government,  the  CPMU,  ADB,  and \nsuitable external auditors, after about 500 subprojects have been approved for implementation, \nand  after  about  200  have  been  completed,  to  evaluate  in  detail  the  project  scope, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  achievements  of  scheduled  targets,  and  to  recommend \nnecessary measures to ensure successful achievement of project objectives. \n \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n50. \nDuring  project  processing,  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  government \nofficials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants,33 particularly the need for bidders, \nsuppliers, contractors, and consultants to observe the highest standards of ethics in procuring \nand executing ADB-financed contracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. \n \n\nIV. \n\nEMERGENCY ASSISTANCE GRANT \n\nActivities  under \n\nthis  emergency  assistance  grant  will  contain  elements  of \n\n51. \nTo help restore and improve access to water supply and sanitation facilities for the rural \npopulation in Aceh and Nias-North Sumatra affected by the tsunami disaster, it is proposed to \nprovide  an  emergency  assistance  grant  for  these  provinces.  The  prevalence  of  waterborne \ncommunicable  diseases  was  already  relatively  higher  than  the  national  average  before  the \ndisaster. Water and sanitation service coverage was below the national average to begin with \nand has now been wiped out in many rural areas. \n \nthe \n52. \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  phases  outlined  by  the  Government.34  Activities  during  the \nimmediate  rehabilitation  phase  will  focus  on  the  prevention  of  waterborne  disease  outbreaks \nand  vector  control  through  basic  rehabilitation  of  community  water  supply  and  sanitation \nfacilities,  along  with  capacity  building  and  training  of  relevant  staff  at  provincial,  district,  and \nvillage  levels  to  engage  in  information,  education,  and  communication  campaigns  on \nwaterborne diseases and SHBC programs. During the reconstruction phase, activities will focus \non  re-establishing  local  government  and  community  capacity  to  ensure  participatory  planning \nand  thus  sustainability  of  the  facilities  provided,  expansion  and/or  new  development  of  water \nand  sanitation  facilities,  and  intensification  of  SHBC  programs.

The grant contributions will be fully untied and administered by ADB.  \n \n54. \nInitial implementation arrangements will follow ADB\u2019s policies and procedures as stated \nin the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, to which the cofinancing governments have \nagreed. The Policy allows for procedural flexibility with regard to operational policies relating to \nprocurement,  consulting  services,  financial  management,  and  disbursement.35  Disbursements \nunder  this  grant  will  be  allowable  for  up  to  100%  of  eligible  project  costs.36  Implementation \narrangements  for  this  grant  are  summarized  in  Appendix  14  and  detailed  in  the  Grant \nAgreement. During the course of implementation, arrangements will be further refined, which is \nallowed under the Policy. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n1. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\nInvestment  in  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation,  combined  with  SHBC  programs,  will \n55. \ndirectly benefit an estimated 1.2 million people (290,000 households) in the project districts, and \nstrengthen  local  government  authorities  and  communities  in  facilitating  and  delivering  these \nbasic services. Benefits will include (i) a reduction in poverty in the target districts, (ii) improved \ncommunity  health  and  environment,  (iii) improvement  in  gender  conditions,  (iv) community \nempowerment, and (v) increased local government capacity. \n \n\na. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\n56. \nThe  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  15.  The  20  target \ndistricts  contain  a  total  population  of  around  6 million  people  of  whom  around  1 million  were \nbelow  the  official  poverty  line  in  2002.  However,  many  more  people  in  these  districts  have \nincomes  close  to  the  poverty  line.  Due  to  seasonal  demands  for  labor,  family  illnesses, \nfluctuating prices, or other external shocks, they can be expected to move in and out of poverty \nover the course of the Project, and are equally unable to accumulate sufficient capital to meet \n\n                                                 \n35 ADB. 2004. Doc. R71-04: Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila. \n36 Exclusive of local taxes and duties.  \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nneeds for safe water and improved sanitation on their own.37 Given the high proportions of poor \nand near-poor households in the target districts, and the targeting of the poorest locations with \nthe  highest  levels  of  unmet  need  (see  Appendix  5),  the  incidence  of  poverty  among  project \nbeneficiaries will be well over 50%. Access to safe and reliable water and sanitation facilities will \ntranslate  into  less  time  and  effort  spent  on  obtaining  good  quality  water,  freeing  up  time  for \nincome-generating activities. Better quality water and access to improved sanitation will reduce \nthe  incidence  and  severity  of  waterborne  diseases,  leading  to  a  reduction  in  sick  days  and \nhealth-related  expenditures.  Healthier  people  with  an  increased  disposable  income  constitute \nimproved levels of social welfare, and will facilitate efforts to improve economic welfare. \n \n\nb. \n\nCommunity Health Benefits and Environmental Improvement \n\nImproved  access  to  better  quality  water  and  sanitation  facilities  will  reduce  waterborne \n57. \ndiseases among the general village population, thus improving their health status. This benefit \nwill  particularly  accrue  to  infants  and  children  who  suffer  more  frequently  and  severely  from \nwaterborne  and  water-related  diseases.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  reduce  infant  and  child \nmortality  as  well  as  malnutrition  caused  or  aggravated  by  waterborne  diseases  in  the  project \nareas,  thus  contributing  indirectly  to  achieving  MDG  4,  target  5,  i.e.,  reducing  by  two  thirds, \nbetween  1990  and  2015,  the  mortality  rate  among  children  under  the  age  of  5;  and  MDG  1, \ntarget 2, i.e., halving, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, \nwith the prevalence of underweight children under the age of 5 as the indicator. \n\n58. \nThe  summary  initial  environmental  examination  is  in  Appendix  16.  There  is  a  positive \nimpact on the local environment of project areas due to improved sewerage management based \non new latrines, septic tanks, and waste disposal services. The amount of sewage  and waste \ndisposed of in the local rivers will be reduced. Water systems developed will include improved \ndrainage  systems  in  water  source  areas,  thereby  reducing  mosquito  habitat  and  waterborne \ndiseases.  The  potential  environmental  adverse  impacts  are  minor,  temporary,  and  can  be \nmitigated. An environmental management plan has been developed to guide the environmental \nassessment and review procedure, implementation of environmental mitigation measures, and \nenvironmental monitoring during project implementation. \n \n\nc. \n\nImprovement in Gender Conditions \n\n59. \nThe  Project  will  particularly  benefit  women  who  will  obtain  access  to  more  and  better \nquality  water  and  learn  about  healthy  and  hygienic  behavior.  Easier  access  to  better  quality \nwater  will  result  in  time  savings  for  women  and  savings  of  financial  and  other  resources \notherwise needed to take care of sick family members. Since women will be actively involved in \nimplementing  village-level  projects,  they  will  benefit  from  training  activities,  and  will  be  able  to \nuse their newly acquired experience and skills for other community-driven programs. \n \n\nd. \n\nCommunity Empowerment \n\nThe  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  communities\u2019  capacity  to  promote  their  own \n60. \ndevelopment.  The  communities\u2019  active  involvement  in  selecting,  planning,  cofinancing,  and \nimplementing  project  interventions,  and  being  responsible  for  the  outcomes  and  maintaining \n\n                                                 \n37 Raising  the  official  poverty  line  by  just  25%  (about  $3  per  capita  per  month)  would  put  an  additional  1.2 million \n\npeople into poverty in these districts. See Supplementary Appendix I for further discussion. \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nthem, will result in their empowerment. The communities will subsequently be able to use these \nskills and social capital to undertake other community improvement activities of their choosing. \n \n\ne. \n\nStrengthened Local Governments \n\n61. \nThe  performance  of  local  governments  will  be  improved  by  the  introduction  of  a \nsimplified quality management approach in public administration. Its emphasis lies in clarifying \nthe  roles  of  local  government  with  regard  to  continuous  improvement  in  service  delivery.  This \nimprovement  will  be  felt  not  only  in  the  sectors  directly  affected  by  the  Project.  With  the \nintroduction  of  a  systematic  conceptual  framework  and  clear  targets  for  improvement,  better \nservices  for  local  communities  can  be  expected,  as  well  as  greater  transparency  of  the \nfunctioning  of  local  administration.  In  combination  with  advocacy  capacity-building  measures \ntargeted  at  the  local  legislative  assemblies,  these  activities  are  expected  to  have  a  positive \nimpact on the development of local democratic governance. \n \n\nf. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n62. \nADB\u2019s  Economics  and  Research  Department  developed  a  simplified  approach  for  the \neconomic assessment of rural water supply projects, which is being pilot-tested in this Project. \nThe approach focuses on time savings as the key indicator of benefits accruing from rural water \nsupply projects. A test has been developed that is equivalent to determining whether the annual \nnet benefits of any village subproject exceed its annualized capital costs.38 The purpose of this \napproach  is  to  provide  criteria  that  can  easily  be  applied  by  district  staff  responsible  for  the \nselection of villages for each district subproject and that, if met, provide a reasonable assurance \nthat  the  village-level  schemes  included  in  the  subproject  would  meet  the  normal  tests  of \nfinancial  and  economic  viability,  i.e.,  have  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  greater \nthan  12%.  Meeting  the  criteria  established  by  the  test  will  be  a  requirement  for  all  villages \nincluded in the Project. The EIRR for the sum of all water supply facilities would therefore also \nbe greater than 12%. No overall EIRR has been calculated separately for the whole Project. The \neconomic analysis is in Appendix 17. \n \n63. \nCommunities will be responsible for choosing the water supply system, from among the \navailable  technical  options,  that  best  suits  their  needs  and  circumstances.  Costs  for  both \nconstruction  and  O&M  will  be  significant  factors  contributing  to  their  decisions.  Household \nsurveys undertaken during the PPTA suggest that the average willingness to pay on a monthly \nbasis  is  sufficient  to  finance  the  O&M  costs  of  most  technical  options.  The  application  of  the \neconomic  criteria  described  in  Appendix  17  will  identify  the  least-cost  option  for  each  village. \nHowever, villages can opt for a higher-level system that provides easier access and costs more \nas long as they agree to shoulder the additional costs. \n \n\n2. \n\nRisks \n\n64. \nPolicy. The Project assumes a stable political environment, continued positive economic \ngrowth, and continued support of the decentralization and regional autonomy policies in place. \nChanges to the main decentralization laws that may affect provincial- or district-level authorities \nand their responsibilities would need adaptation of project implementation arrangements.  \n \n\n                                                 \n38 The approach and the method for applying it are outlined in Appendix 17 and elaborated in detail in Supplementary \n\nAppendix C. \n\n\f18 \n\nLocal  Government  Capacity  and  Support.  The  full  participation  of  local  government \n65. \nagencies in supplying adequate support services to communities is imperative for the successful \nimplementation  and  long-term  sustainability  of  the  Project.  A  receptive  response  to  capacity \nbuilding  will  ensure  that  government  capacity  to  support  community-driven  projects  is \nmaintained, implementation schedules are adhered to, and counterpart funds are available and \nreleased  on  time.  Continuity  in  the  leadership  of  government  officials  is  required  for  timely \nproject  implementation.  The  Project\u2019s  emphasis  on  facilitating  change and  instigating  a  reform \nwithin  the  local  governments  will  help  generate  long-term  commitments  to  better  service \ndelivery.  \n \n66. \nCommunity Facilitation. The key to the effective empowering of communities lies with \nthe  community  facilitators.  Experienced  community  facilitators  are  generally  expensive  and  in \nshort  supply.  Intensive  training  of  the  facilitators,  coupled  with  close  supervision,  monitoring, \nand  back-stopping  will  be  required  to  ensure  quality  control  and  effective  community \nmobilization.  The  Project  has  allocated  sufficient  resources  to  intensively  train  qualified \nfacilitators and to supervise their performance. Nonperforming facilitators will be replaced. \n \n67. \nCommunity Participation and Ownership. Communities will actively participate in the \ndesign,  and  accept  responsibility  for  the  management  and  cofunding,  of  water  and  sanitation \nfacilities, and for O&M to ensure the facilities\u2019 long-term sustainability. Sufficient social cohesion \nwithin  the  community  is  required  to  manage  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  schemes  on  a \nsustainable  basis.  Participatory  planning  will  ensure  that  communities  mobilize  sufficient \nresources  and  are  willing  to  pay  for  their  share  of  construction  and  O&M  costs,  particularly  in \ncommunities where costs may be high because of physically difficult terrain.  \n \n68. \nEnvironmental  Conditions.  For  particular  villages,  especially  those  in  peat  swamps \nwhere  surface  and  shallow  groundwater  is  of  very  poor  quality,  finding  an  appropriate  and \naffordable  technical  solution  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  may  be  difficult.  The  Project  will \nundertake an initial environmental screening for each village before the communities produce a \nCAP.  The  screening  will  encompass  identification  of  the  subproject  type,  scale,  location, \nsensitivity, and nature and magnitude of potential impacts.39 Subprojects in villages that do not \npass the screening will not be pursued.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n69. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  adequate  budgetary  allocations  of  the  required \ncounterpart funds for the CPMU and the DPMUs and their timely release. \n\nThe  Government  will  seek  prior  approval  of  ADB  for  any  change  of  the  CPMU \nproject manager. The term of office of the CPMU project manager is at least for \ntwo years, and every effort will be made to identify suitable qualified women to fill \nsome of the CPMU positions. \n\n(iii) \n\nThe Government will ensure implementation of the GAP. \n\n                                                 \n39 Details are in Appendix 16 and the Project Administration Memorandum. \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  Government  will  promote  full  participation  of  indigenous  peoples  in  project \nactivities,  including,  among  other  things,  developing  mechanisms  to  include \nindigenous  peoples  in  capacity  building  and  training  under  the  Project.  The \nPPMS  will  include  performance  indicators  that  facilitate  the  monitoring  of \nparticipation  of  indigenous  peoples  in  project  activities.  The  Government  will \nensure that project activities are carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on \nindigenous peoples,  and  that  the  Indigenous Peoples\u2019  Development  Framework \nis implemented.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  a  basic  environmental  impact  assessment  is \ncarried out as part of the planning process of subprojects at the community level, \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \ninitial \nenvironmental  examination.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  design, \nconstruction,  and  operation  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  will  comply \nwith applicable national laws, regulations, and standards. \n\n(2002),  and \n\nthe \n\nThe Government will ensure that all land acquisition and resettlement plans will \nbe  approved  by  ADB  prior  to  award  of  civil  works  contracts  for  subprojects,  in \naccordance  with  the  resettlement  framework  agreed  upon  by  the  Government \nand  ADB;  the  Government\u2019s  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures;  and  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements as defined in ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement.40 In case of \ndiscrepancies between the Government\u2019s laws, regulations, and procedures and \nADB\u2019s requirements, ADB\u2019s requirements will apply. \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Government  agrees  that  no  disbursement  will  be  made  from  the  loan \naccount for any subproject scheme that is not based on an approved CAP and a \nsigned  contract  between  the  DPMU  and  the  CIT  following  the  demand-driven, \ncommunity-based approach outlined in the Project. \n\n(viii)  For the Aceh/Nias-North Sumatra Emergency Assistance Grant, the Government  \nwill  ensure  that  detailed  project  information,  including  on  bidding  procedures, \nparticipating  bidders  and  winners,  contract  awards,  goods  and  services \npurchased  and  actual  utilization,  community  block  grants  received,  and \ncooperation with other development agencies will be posted on a website to be \ndetermined by agreement of ADB and the Government.  \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness41 \n\nThe following are conditions for loan effectiveness: \n\nB. \n\n70. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe DPMUs have been set up and are staffed. \n\nThe Government has established the project steering committee. \n\nThe Government has certified that budget approval documents for the loan and \ncounterpart  funds  for  the  first  year  of  project  implementation  have  been  issued \nand all necessary budget approval documents for on-granting loan proceeds to at \nleast eight (8) participating districts have been approved and disseminated. \n\n(iv) \n\nThe Government has issued a decision or other regulation satisfactory to ADB on \nproject disbursement arrangements and the flow of funds. \n\n                                                 \n40 Details of the Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework are in Appendix 18. \n41 Conditions for effectiveness are based on the project readiness criteria agreed upon between the Government and \n\nADB. \n\n\fThe  EA  has  made  recommendations  for  the  award  of  contracts  for  major \nconsulting  services \nfirst  year  of  project \nto  commence \nimplementation. \n\nthat  are \n\nthe \n\nin \n\nGuidelines  for  implementing  the  PPMS,  satisfactory  to  ADB  in  form  and \nsubstance  and  including  requirements  for  poverty  and  gender-disaggregated \ndata, have been developed at the national level for use in training and capacity-\nbuilding project components and will be ready for implementation. \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n71. \nADB and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\nthe  loan  of  $34,100,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Community  Water \nServices and Health Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with interest \nto be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-based \nlending facility;

Pipe  and  pump  systems  remain  largely  an  urban  phenomenon  in \nIndonesia,  and  there  has  been  little  change  in  either  levels  or  the  urban-rural  gap  in  recent \nyears. In rural areas, close to one third of households still do not have access to safe water. As \nto sanitation, the use of toilet facilities and/or septic tanks for human waste disposal still remains \nthe exception rather than the rule in much of rural Indonesia. \n \n3. \nBased on data from the National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS) 2002, more than a \nthird (37%) of households in the poorest quintile (Q1) lack access to pipe, pump, or water from \nprotected wells or springs for drinking purposes, and over 80% lack access to toilets and/or final \ndisposal via septic tanks. This can be compared to the richest quintile (Q5) where only 14% of \nhouseholds  lack  access  to  similar  qualities  of  water  and  around  one  fifth  to  one  quarter  (20\u2013\n27%) access to similar levels of sanitation. \n \n4. \nAlthough  there  is  some  variation,  the  Project\u2019s  target  provinces  and  districts  are \ngenerally less well served, and the poorest quintile is worse off than national averages (Table \nA2.2).  In  most  of  the  target  districts  in  Kalimantan  and  some  in  Sumatra,  less  than  40%  of \nhouseholds have access to safe water, and in the great majority of cases less than one third of \n\n                                                 \n1  MDG 7, target 10: to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and \n\nbasic sanitation. \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nhouseholds have regular access to toilet facilities or final disposal of human waste using septic \ntanks.  The  problem  is  particularly  severe  in  the  two  provinces  in  Kalimantan  where  there  is \nheavy  reliance  on  increasingly  polluted  river  water  for  drinking,  and  only  a  small  minority  of \nhouseholds has access to toilet facilities.  \n \n\nTable A2.2: Selected Indicators on Access to Safe Water and Sanitation by Urban/Rural \nResidence and Household Per Capita Expenditure Quintiles, Project Provinces, 2002 \n \n\nHouseholds with \nPipe, Pump, \nProtected Well or \nSpring Source of \nDrinking Water \n\n \n \nHouseholds with \nFinal Disposal \nUsing Septic Tank \n\n \n \n \nItem \n\nTotal Indonesia \n     Urban \n     Rural \nJambi \n     Total \n     Urban \n     Rural \n     Q1 \n     Q5 \nBengkulu \n     Total \n     Urban \n     Rural \n     Q1 \n     Q5 \nWest Kalimantan \n     Total \n     Urban \n     Rural \n     Q1 \n     Q5 \nCentral Kalimantan \n     Total \n     Urban \n     Rural \n     Q1 \n     Q5 \n\n \n \nHouseholds with \nPipe or Pump \nSource of Drinking \nWater \n32.8 \n54.5 \n15.2 \n \n19.2 \n40.8 \n10.7 \n10.3 \n35.5 \n \n13.5 \n33.6 \n5.2 \n3.6 \n38.6 \n \n11.3 \n27.5 \n5.7 \n4.0 \n29.3 \n \n25.8 \n65.4 \n9.2 \n11.6 \n45.7 \n\n \n \n \nHouseholds with \nAccess to Toilet \nFacilities \n46.3 \n70.0 \n27.1 \n \n37.4 \n73.9 \n23.1 \n20.5 \n64.0 \n \n45.0 \n87.4 \n27.5 \n18.2 \n89.8 \n \n35.4 \n73.1 \n22.4 \n12.6 \n72.0 \n \n28.4 \n64.0 \n13.5 \n13.7 \n49.8 \n\n74.6 \n87.2 \n64.3 \n \n49.2 \n74.7 \n39.2 \n37.4 \n64.7 \n \n54.3 \n75.8 \n45.4 \n43.3 \n80.3 \n \n17.4 \n32.9 \n12.1 \n6.6 \n35.8 \n \n37.4 \n76.2 \n21.1 \n17.9 \n58.6 \n\n39.8 \n63.2 \n20.7 \n \n30.4 \n67.0 \n16.1 \n16.1 \n53.3 \n \n24.3 \n62.8 \n8.5 \n7.4 \n63.1 \n \n25.4 \n64.8 \n11.8 \n6.7 \n61.6 \n \n20.6 \n55.0 \n6.2 \n5.7 \n39.1 \n\nQ1 = poorest quintile, Q5 = richest quintile \nSource: National Socioeconomic Survey SUSENAS, 2002.  \n\nB. \n\nHealth and Hygiene Behavior \n\nCollected data and information on the status of Indonesia\u2019s health sector in general, and \n5. \non  the  incidence  and  mortality  rates  from  waterborne  or  water-related  diseases  in  particular, \nshow  varying  degrees  of  validity  and  accuracy  and  should  thus  be  treated  with  caution.

The  latest  of  these \nsurveys  in  2000  showed  a  national diarrheal  incidence  rate of  1.278  for  children  under  age 5. \nThis  suggests  that  diarrheal  disease  incidence  in  Indonesia  is  already  fairly  low  for  children \nunder  5  on  a  national  basis.  However,  diarrhea  is  only  one  aspect  of  the  general  health \nconditions of rural Indonesia, and the project focus will encompass other aspects of individual \nand  community  health  that  impact  on  the  quality  of  life  in  the  target  provinces.  A  critical \ncomponent will thus be the hygiene behavioral change interventions of the Project. \n \nThe  Indonesian  surveillance  system  for  worm  infestation4  only  began  in  2002. \n8. \nPrevalence rates have no statistical validity and there is no sampling frame for the 10 provinces \nsurveyed. Both malaria and dengue fever are included in MOH\u2019s integrated surveillance system \nof 29 selected diseases, in which all provinces are supposed to participate. For malaria, passive \ncase detection, clinical diagnosis and treatment, active case detection, and laboratory diagnosis \nare limited to Java and Bali, and mortality rates are not available.  \n \nIn the past, many programs and projects have tended to focus on technical infrastructure \n9. \nor  medical  treatment  solutions  (such  as  oral  rehydration  therapy  for  diarrhea),  rather  than \nattempting to tackle the human behavior challenge. Behavioral change strategies, which focus \non  prevention  rather  than  treatment,  are  included  in  projects  but  are  found  to  be  delayed  and \ndiluted during implementation. \n \n10.  More \ntechniques  and  various  participatory \nmethodologies  have  been  developed  to  attack  the  chronic  problems  of  implementation  of \nbehavioral change related to sanitation and hygiene. These new techniques have largely come \nfrom outside the medical establishment and have yet to be widely adopted by rural public health \nservices, which continue to either skirt the issue of hygiene behavioral change or tend to impose \ninappropriate  and  often  resented  sanctions  that  do  little  to  win  popular  support  for  improved \nhygiene  behavior  or  practices.  Addressing  this  problem  in  ways  that  are  appropriate, \nacceptable, and that lead to sustainable changes in human behavior thus constitutes one of the \nmajor challenges for the Project. \n \n                                                 \n3  These are known as the household health surveys (Survei Kesehatan Rumah Tangga).

Experience under the World Bank\u2019s Water and Sanitation for \n1. \nLow Income Communities II Project (WSLIC-II)1 has shown that coordination and application of \nuniform  operating  standards  is  difficult  when  too  many  provinces  and  districts  are  involved  (in \nthe  case  of  WSLIC-II,  40  districts  in  six  provinces).  Similarly,  the  Rural  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation Sector Project (RWSSP)2 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) covered 80 districts \nin  12  provinces,  with  over  4,400  communities  spread  over  very  large  and  often  relatively \ninaccessible areas, which had a negative impact on project implementation and monitoring. The \nProject has therefore limited the number of provinces and districts within these provinces, while \nat the same time increasing the number of villages covered in each district to maximize impact. \n \nSimplify  Implementation  and  Fund  Channeling  Arrangements.  Experience  under \n2. \nRWSSP  with  too  many  government  agencies  involved  at  various  administrative  levels  led  to \npoor coordination of activities and difficulties in monitoring a system of thousands of small works \ncontracts.  Complicated  fund  channeling  mechanisms  also  hampered  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Water \nSupply and Sanitation for Low Income Communities Project (WSSLIC). Recent decentralization \nposes a challenge in that more hierarchy levels want to have a say in project implementation. \nThe  Project  will  ensure  that  a  single  project  management  organization  will  have  sufficient \nauthority  to  resolve  coordination  and  implementation  issues  in  a  timely  manner,  and  that \ndelegation of decision making to lower levels is implemented where feasible. \n \n3. \nOffer a Simple Water and Sanitation Technology Menu. In past projects in Indonesia, \nthe  use  of  standardized  technology,  which  turned  out  to  be  too  costly  and  too  complicated  to \nmaintain  and  repair,  was  imposed  on  communities.  To  promote  a  sense  of  ownership  and  to \nincrease  the  willingness  to  pay  for  capital  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs, \ncommunities need to choose the facilities they want and are willing to pay for. The Project has \ndeveloped  a  menu  of  10  easily  understandable  water  supply  options  and  three  options  for \nsanitation along the lines of the menu that was prepared under WSLIC II to help communities \nmake an informed choice. The menu allows for incremental upgrading of basic facilities, if the \ncommunity is willing to pay the full incremental cost. Communities will receive extensive advise \non  the  costs  each  of  the  options  involve  (both  capital  and  O&M),  the  feasibility  according  to \ntopography  and  population,  and  the  potential  for  incremental  upgrading,  among  others.  Tariffs \nand user fees for services will depend on the technology option chosen by the community, and \nshould usually cover at least O&M costs. Based on the WSLIC experience, user fees will need \nto be determined and agreed upon in detail in the community action plan prior to construction. \n \n4. \nEngage  Communities  at  All  Project  Stages.  Several  previous  ADB  projects  in  rural \nwater  and  sanitation  were  affected  by  poor  community  acceptance  of  schemes  because  of \ninadequate  involvement  and  consultation,  which  resulted  in  slow  uptake  of  connections  and \ninadequate  cost  recovery.  Communities  need  to  have  the  right  to  control  key  activities  with \nregard  to  planning,  design,  and  construction  of  facilities,  which  in  turn  has  proven  to  be  an \nantidote  against  corruption  in  previous  projects.  Also,  investment  into  upgrading  community \ncapacity  and  capability  (particularly  for  O&M  and  repair)  is  needed  to  ensure  sustainability  of \nproject  investments.  In  the  Project,  communities  will  be  engaged  from  the  beginning  and \nthroughout the full project cycle.  \n\n                                                 \n1  World  Bank.  2000.

Community  facilitators  will  be  a  key  factor  in \n5. \nensuring  the  success  of  the  Project  as  they  are  responsible  for  community  planning  and \npreparation  before  the  construction  of  facilities.  In  WSLIC-II,  training  and  mobilization  of \nfacilitators  were  significantly  delayed,  thus  delaying  the  whole  project  implementation.  Under \nRWSSP, local training programs were generally not synchronized with work implementation, not \nsufficiently financed, and too short in duration. The Project will ensure that facilitator recruitment, \ntraining, supervision, and replacements will be delivered in a timely and synchronized manner. \n \nIncreasing  Community  Contributions.  The  community  contribution \n6. \nformula  under  WSLIC-II  (20%,  including  16%  in  kind  and  4%  in  cash)  is  working  well,  thus  a \nsimilar formula will be applied under the Project. However, the Project will encourage increasing \nthe cash contribution by the community, in particular for facilities that go beyond basic services \nlevels (such as fully piped, in-house water systems). \n \n7. \nMonitor  Quality  of  Construction  and  Personnel  Performance.  Poor  quality  of \nconstruction and inadequate personnel performance has plagued many rural water supply and \nsanitation  projects  in  the  past.3  In  RWSSP,  the  low  quality  of  construction  was  attributed  to \ncompulsory use of nonskilled and nontrained village labor by contractors, combined with lack of \nsupervision. Performance monitoring of consultants, NGOs, participating government agencies, \nand  private  sector  organizations  is  crucial  to  the  success  of  the  Project.  Communities  will  be \nadequately  trained  to  demand  and  assess  high quality  construction  and  assistance,  combined \nwith professional and regular independent quality monitoring and control of activities. \n \n8. \nEmphasize  Sanitation  and  Hygiene  Behavioral  Change  (SHBC).  Since  improved \nwater supply and sanitation facilities are insufficient to dramatically reduce waterborne diseases, \nSHBC needs to be given as much attention as the actual construction of facilities. In previous \nprojects, such as RWSSP, health education and community programs were treated as an \u201cadd \non\u201d  and  based  mainly  on  standard  training,  which  did  not  adequately  address  the  issue  of \nsustaining  a  change  in  behavior.  Experience  of  projects  inside  and  outside  of  Indonesia  has \ndemonstrated that a range of country- or district-specific motivating factors beyond health (such \nas social status enhancement from having a sanitary toilet, convenience, time savings, people\u2019s \ndesire for a smell-free home) will need to be emphasized in the SHBC component, particularly \nfor first-time in-house water and sanitation users.4 \n \n9. \nEnsure  Transparency  and  Accountability  of  Project  Administration  and \nProcurement. Ensuring full transparency and public accountability of project administration and \nprocurement is crucial to stimulating community participation and commitment to project policies \nand  procedures.  Rural  water  and  sanitation  projects  are  notoriously  slow  and  cumbersome  in \nimplementation, leading to high levels of frustration among initially very motivated communities. \nTo address this, advance actions in terms of establishing and staffing central- and district-level \nproject offices, and recruiting central-level consultants, will be initiated well in advance of project \nimplementation.

The long-list is only indicative \nat this stage as the selection of villages to participate in the proposed Project will be determined \nby  the  districts  during  the  early  stage  of  implementation  through  project  orientation  and \nconsultation phases. Village participation criteria are in Box A6. \n\n \n\n \nBox A6: Village Participation Criteria  \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nCommunity commitment through Letter of Intent, confirming \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n(f) \n(g) \n(h) \n\nno other clean water or drinking water projects ongoing or planned for the village; \nformation of a community implementation team (CIT); \nwillingness to prepare a community action plan (CAP); \nwillingness to contribute 16% of subproject construction costs in-kind; \nwillingness to contribute 4% in cash; \nwillingness to pay all user fees afterward (operation and maintenance, etc.); \nwillingness to conduct required operation and maintenance on the system; and \nwillingness to conduct sanitation and hygiene behavioral change program. \n\nGeographic requisite: at least three qualifying villages per subdistrict. \n\nSocioeconomic factors, including  \n(a) \n\nvillage poverty rate (based on Family Planning Agency methodology) of more than \n25% of households classified as pre-welfare or welfare-1; and  \nminimum village population of at least 100 households per village. \n\n(b) \n \nHealth and technical factors (any one factor qualifies village for inclusion in Project): \npercentage of households with access to improved latrines < 50%; \n(a) \npercentage of households requiring more than 30 minutes to access water and return \n(b) \nit to home > 30%; \nwater availability/reliability < 9 months per year for > 30% of households; \nlevel of fecal chloroform, arsenic > Ministry of Health/World Health Organization \ntechnical standard;  \npercentage of dug wells intruded by salt-water, smell, or otherwise contaminated > \n10%; or, \nper capita water availability < 15 liters per person per day  \n\n(c) \n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n \n\n \nFollowing confirmation of village participation, villages will prepare a Community Action \n2. \nPlan (CAP). The CAP will be approved by the District Project Management Unit (DPMU). The \nCAP will  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\npropose solutions to overcome water supply, sanitation, and/or health problems \nthat are at an appropriate level of technology and reasonable budget level (i.e., \nwithin  the  proposed  maximum  limit  of  Rp250 million  for  water  supply  and \nsanitation facilities per village); \nbe required to pass the economic assessment test outlined in Appendix 17; and \nbe  required  to  pass  the  environmental  screening  process  outlined  in  Appendix \n16. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n33 \n\nINDIGENOUS PEOPLES\u2019 DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK \n\nA. \n\nProject Background \n\nThe Project will provide rural water supply and sanitation facilities and services to about \n1. \n1,000  communities  in  20  districts  in  the  provinces  of  West  Kalimantan,  Central  Kalimantan, \nJambi, and Bengkulu. Following a demand-driven, community-based approach, the Project will \nprovide an estimated 1.2 million people with safe drinking water, of whom about 0.6 million will \nalso benefit from improved sanitation facilities. The Project will also facilitate capacity building of \nlocal  governments  and  the  communities  themselves,  and  raise  awareness  on  appropriate \nsanitation and hygiene behavior to maximize the investment impact. \n \nIndigenous  peoples  (IPs)1  were  identified  during  the  sample  village  field  studies \n2. \nconducted  in  Kalimantan,  and  it  is  probable  that  they  will  be  found  in  other  areas  of  all  four \nproject provinces during implementation. IP risks are expected to generally be minor due to the \ncommunity-driven,  participatory  approach  of \nrequires  adequate \nrepresentation  of  marginal  groups  on  the  community  implementation  team  (CIT).  The  Project \nwill seek to identify locations with significant IP presence and ensure that necessary information \nand facilitation is provided to ensure equal inclusion in the Project. \n \nB. \n\nObjectives of the Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Development Framework \n\nthe  Project,  which \n\n3. \nThe  objectives  of  the  Indigenous  Peoples\u2019  Development  Framework  (IPDF)  are  to \nensure that IPs (i) participate fully in the Project; (ii) are aware of their rights and responsibilities \nwith regard to the Project; and (iii) are able to voice their needs during the community problem \nmapping and planning meetings, and community action plan (CAP) formulation. \n \nC. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements/Strategy to Ensure IP Participation \n\nTo ensure full participation in the Project and adequate reflection of their specific needs \n\n4. \nin the CAPs, the following arrangements will be made: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nCommunity  facilitator  teams  (CFTs)  will  be  trained  in  the  identification  of  IPs. \nThrough  baseline  surveys,  community  self-help  exercises,  and  discussions  on \ncommunity  empowerment,  facilitators  will  identify  the  presence  and  numbers  of \nIP  groups  in  the  community  and  report  this  to  the  district  project  management \nunit (DPMU) and district support team (DST); \nFor the areas where IP groups are identified, the DSTs will organize orientation \ntraining for relevant community facilitators on how to work with groups of IPs to \nidentify mechanisms for effective participation, and address specific challenges in \nworking with such groups; \n\n(iii)  Where  IP  groups  are  identified,  efforts  will  be  made  to  ensure  that  at  least  one \nCIT  member  is  from  the  group  and  able  to  communicate  easily  with  the  group; \nand \n\n(iv)  Where  the  IPs  speak  a  language  different  from  Bahasa  Indonesia,  relevant \nbrochures and documents will be translated into the appropriate language. \n\n                                                 \n1  According  to  Presidential  Decree  No.  111/1999  on  Empowering  Social  Welfare  of  Communities  in  Isolated  and \nRemote Areas, IPs in Indonesia are defined as communities with a distinct culture, who live in remote areas, and \nhave limited access to social, economic, and political activities. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nCFT members will be hired locally to the extent possible and are likely to be familiar with \n5. \nsuch groups. They will also be rotated as necessary to ensure that those that have been trained \nin working with IP groups, or have specific skills that would be beneficial in working with such \ngroups, are available in the right places. \n \nD. \n\nImpacts on and Benefits for Indigenous Peoples \n\n6. \nThe  initial  poverty  and  social  assessments  done  by  CFTs  for  each  subproject  will \nindicate the magnitude and type of IP impacts. Participation of IPs is expected to lead mostly to \npositive benefits. If a community turns out to be fully indigenous, the CAP will serve the purpose \nof an Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Development Plan (IPDP), to be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \npolicy on indigenous peoples. These CAPs will be subject to the approval of ADB. \n \n7. \nIP-specific  actions  will  be  commensurate  with  the  impact  severity  level  of  each \nsubproject  affecting  vulnerable  groups.  Impact  severity  is  defined  based  on  the  degree  of \nvulnerability of the affected peoples and the type of impacts, i.e., (i) limited impacts occur when \n(a)  the  affected  peoples  are  fully  integrated  in  mainstream  society  and  in  control  of  the  local \nadministrative  system,  and/or  (b)  impacts  do  not  have  broad  community  or  sociocultural \ndimensions; and (ii) severe impacts occur when (a) the affected peoples maintain a degree of \nsociocultural  and  institutional  distinction  from  mainstream  society  and/or  (b)  impacts  carry  a \nbroad sociocultural dimension and have wide community effects. \n \n8. \nAction  for  limited  impacts  will  include  a  brief  assessment  of  the  affected  peoples\u2019 \nsocioeconomic and cultural status, and the preparation of specific actions to address associated \nconcerns, which will be included in the CAP. Action for severe impacts will require the CAP to \nserve as a full IPDP including (i) an assessment of the affected peoples\u2019 situation, and (ii) an IP \naction  plan  detailing  needed  rehabilitation/development  provisions  and  related  implementation \nmechanisms  and  processes.  IPDPs  will  be  designed  and  implemented  through  a  participatory \nmethodology involving the affected peoples and other stakeholders. \n \n9. \nFor  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  CAPs  to  serve  as  IPDPs,  the  Project  will \nmainly rely on the CFTs, with assistance and supervision from the DSTs. The CFTs\u2019 main tasks \nare to (i) ensure effective community self-organization; (ii) facilitate, monitor, and supervise the \nformulation  and  implementation  of  the  CAP;  and  (iii) ensure  effective  monitoring  of  CAP \nactivities, including IP-specific actions. The CFTs will consist of three experts, one of them being \na  community  mobilization  and  equity  specialist  whose  responsibility  is  to  ensure  the  active \nparticipation  of  all  village  stakeholders,  including  IPs,  women,  and  the  poor.  The  CFTs  will  be \nhired  as  part  of  the  consultant  packages  for  each  province  and  will  assist  each  community \nthroughout the whole project cycle. Thus, the preparation and implementation of IPDPs in lieu of \nCAPs or IP-specific actions as part of the CAPs are fully budgeted. \n \nE. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n10.  Where IPs are identified, these will be flagged to the DPMU by the CFTs and DSTs, and \nthe  DPMU  will  report  to  the  CPMU  and  ADB  on  IPs\u2019  participation  in  project  activities  on  a \nbiannual basis. Provisions will also be made in the project reporting system for monitoring the \ninvolvement  of  IPs.  Provisions  will  be  made  so  that  any  issues  or  complaint  can  be  raised, \nrecorded,  and  resolved  with  the  DPMU.  Designated  staff  within  the  DPMU  will  be  responsible \nfor following up on complaints, and ensuring that they are handled promptly and adequately until \nresolved. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n35 \n\nA. \n\nPreparatory Work Undertaken \n\nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n\nWorkshops,  focus  group  discussions,  and  the  socioeconomic  and  health  survey \n1. \nundertaken  during  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  stage  revealed  widespread \nenthusiasm for active involvement of women in the Project. While women and men participating \nin the survey reported that they are equally responsible for collecting water for household use, \nthis  depends  largely  on  the  closeness  of  the  source  of  water,  quantity  to  be  collected,  and \nseasons. The survey also revealed that while local sanitation conditions were dismal, little value \nwas placed on women\u2019s access to improved sanitation facilities. To get more women to adopt \nimproved  hygiene  practices,  properly  trained  community  facilitators  will  need  to  pay  particular \nattention to this through appropriate learning tools and materials in local languages.  \n \nB. \n\nGender Action Plan \n\nThe Project will make considerable efforts to actively engage women in project activities, \n2. \nhire  them  in  key  positions  as  facilitators  and  trainers,  solicit  the  support  and  participation  of \nwomen\u2019s organizations at the grassroots level, and focus on particular groups of women, among \nthem  the  poor,  mothers  with  your  children,  and  women-headed  households.  The  summary \ngender action plan (GAP) below outlines how the Project will address gender dimensions. The \nkey strategies underlining the GAP include: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nactive  involvement  of  women  as  both  implementors  and  beneficiaries;  during \ncommunity consultations, workshops, and focus group discussions, at least 50% \nof  the  participants  should  be  women,  including poor  women,  women  household \nheads, and mothers with infants and young school children; \nengagement of women teachers, the women\u2019s Family Welfare Movement (PKK), \nvillage  midwives,  health  volunteers,  and  other  women  activists,  for  information, \neducation  and  communication  (IEC)  campaigns  with  particular  target  groups  on \nthe benefits of using clean water for hygiene and sanitation purposes; \nengagement  of  female  community  facilitators  at equal  salary  to  male  facilitators \nto attract women\u2019s active participation in IEC campaigns and the implementation \nof behavioral change; \nappropriate  representation  of  women  on  the  community  implementation  team \n(CIT)  to  ensure  that  the  community  action  plan  (CAP)  adequately  reflects \nwomen\u2019s interests; and \nspecific training activities for village women. \n\n \nC. \n\nGender Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n3. \nThe Central Support Team (CST) includes a national gender specialist for a total input of \n8  months  over  the  first  three  years.  In  addition,  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  community  and \nequity specialist in the district support teams (DSTs) require gender expertise and awareness. \nThe  GAP  will  be  implemented  in  line  with  the  overall  implementation  schedule  of  the  Project. \nThe project performance monitoring system (PPMS) will incorporate gender-sensitive indicators \nspecified  in  the  GAP.  The  baseline  and  end-of-project  surveys  will  involve  at  least  50%  of \nwomen  out  of  the  total  respondents,  and  disaggregate  households  by  gender,  ethnic  groups, \nand socioeconomic background. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable A8: Gender Action Plan \n \n\nProject Components \n\n1.

The  emergency  assistance  grant \nwill  be  administered  directly  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  funded  by  the \nGovernment  of  the  United  Kingdom,  the  Government  of  Canada,  and  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands. About five districts and 500 villages will be covered by the grant over a period of 4 \nyears.  Activities  under  this  grant  will  contain  elements  of  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction \nphases outlined by the Government.1 The total cost of the grant is estimated to be $16.5 million \nequivalent,  comprising  $1.3  million  (7.7%)  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $15.2  million  (92.3%) \nequivalent in local currency cost.

Initial \nimplementation  arrangements  envisage  a  domestic  Aceh  Coordinator,  seconded  by  an \ninternational  adviser  and  a  procurement  specialist,  to  be  placed  with  the  Central  Project \nManagement Unit of the Project at the Ministry of Health. It is estimated that around 8 person-\nmonths of international and 408 person-months of domestic consulting services will be needed \nto  support  the  Central,  Provincial,  and  District Project  Management  Units.  In  addition,  suitable \nNGOs and/or individuals will be contracted as community facilitators to be placed at subdistrict \nand village level.  \n \n3. \nFollowing project \u201croad shows\u201d in districts and subdistricts, village representatives will be \nable  to  directly  hand  in  a  simple  application  form.  Village  selection  will  be  based  on  priority \ncriteria such as the extent of damage from the earthquake or the tsunami, the number of IDPs \ntaken  in,  and  health  and  technical  factors  (such  as  percentage  of  households  with  access  to \nwater  and  latrines,  water  quality  standards,  and  prevalence  rates  for  diarrhea  among  children \nunder age 5, among others). \n \n4. \nVillages  who  have  applied  will  be  visited  by  the  community  facilitators  to  conduct  a \nparticipatory  rapid  appraisal,  which  will  be  the  basis  for  a  rapid  community  action  plan  (CAP). \nCommunities  will  receive  a  block  grant  of  maximum  Rp200  million  for  the  investments.2  Cash \ncontributions of 4% of the total block grant as implemented in the other project provinces will be \nwaived;  in-kind  contribution  in  the  form  of  labor  or  material  input  will  be  strongly  encouraged, \nwith  adequate  cash  remuneration  to  help  restore  livelihoods.  Latrine  construction  will  be \nsubsidized for up to 80% of the village population to ensure adequate sanitation coverage.3 As \nin  the  other  project  provinces,  communities  will  be  fully  in  charge  of  the  continuous  operation \nand  maintenance  costs  of  the  facilities  provided.  However,  in  severely  affected  villages, \noperation and maintenance cost responsibility may be phased in after an initial period of 1 to 1 \n\u00bd years during which the grant would cover these. \n \n5. \nIn order to provide a rapid response to the natural disaster, community facilitators from \nAceh and Nias-North Sumatra will be trained while villages are enrolling, using a mentoring and \non-the-job training approach through an experienced NGO from elsewhere in the country who \nwill  provide  field  team  facilitators  for  each  district  and  will  develop  the  first  10  rapid  CAPs  for \nfunding in 2005. The community facilitator teams will have the same composition as in the other \nproject  provinces,  and  will  receive  further  stages  of  training  during  the  life  of  the  grant.  While \nbasic  approaches  to  participatory  planning  will  be  used  for  identification  of  technologies  and \nstrategies  for  implementation,  this  approach  will  be  modified  during  the  rehabilitation  phase  to \nencourage a rapid response to those areas affected by the disaster. During the reconstruction \nphase,  the  development  of  CAPs  will  be  staged  to  be  more  in  line  with  the  guidelines  for  the \nother project provinces. \n \n\n                                                 \n2  The block grant ceiling may be adjusted depending on the average size of villages to be included, which can only \n\nbe assessed during project implementation.  \n\n3  For comparison, in the original project provinces, the subsidy is for the poorest 10% of households per village only. \n\nThe sanitation subsidy program will be designed in a way to maximize village sanitation coverage. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \nAccess  to  a  reliable  supply  of  clean  water  is  a  major  problem  for  poor  rural  households.  Community  planned, \nimplemented,  operated,  and  maintained  water  services  improve  sanitation  and  health  of  residents,  increase  work \nproductivity, improve livelihood security, and provide opportunities for sustainable livelihood development for poor rural \nfamilies.  These  contributions  are  in  line  with  the  poverty  partnership  agreement  (2001\u20132004)  signed  by  the \nGovernment  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  which  emphasizes  increasing  the  productivity  of  the  poor \nthrough  empowerment,  development  of  infrastructure  (especially  in  rural  and  remote  areas),  and  human  resource \ndevelopment by improving access to and quality of basic services of the poor and in remote areas. It is also in line with \nthe  ADB  Country  Strategy  and  Program  (CSP)  Update  (2004\u20132006)  with  its  focus  on  strengthening  institutions  that \ngovern  the  poor,  supporting  sustainable  pro-poor  growth,  promoting  balanced  regional  equity  focusing  on  rural  and \nisolated  area  development,  investment  in  human  and  social  development  and  strengthening  environmental \nmanagement to ensure sustainable use of natural resources. \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe Project will provide access to reliable water supply and improved practices in sanitation and hygiene to some of \nthe  poorest  and  most  underserved  areas  in  the  country.  The  20  target  districts  contain  a  total  population  of  around \n6 million people of whom about 1 million were below the official poverty line in 2002. However, many more people in \nthese districts have incomes close to the poverty line. Due to seasonal demands for labor, family illnesses, fluctuating \nprices, or other external shocks, they can be expected to move in and out of poverty over the course of the Project, \nand would be just as unable to accumulate sufficient savings to meet needs for water and sanitation on their own as \nthe officially poor.  \nAccess to safe water and sanitation is low in the target provinces compared to national averages, especially among \nthe  poor.  Among  the  poorest  quintile  access  to  clean  water  is  less  than  25%  (compared  to  54%  among  the  richest \nquintile) and barely 10% have access to toilet facilities and/or septic tanks (compared to closer to half of the richest \nquintile). Based on the high proportions of poor and near-poor households in the target districts and given the Project\u2019s \nfocus on the poorest locations with highest levels of unmet need (Appendix 5), the incidence of poverty among project \nbeneficiaries will be well over 50%. Access to safe, reliable, water and sanitation facilities will help reduce poverty in \nthese districts in a number of ways. Improved access will translate into less time and effort spent on obtaining good \nquality water, freeing up time for income-generating activities. Better quality water and access to improved sanitation \nwill reduce the incidence  and severity  of  waterborne and water-related  diseases, leading to a reduction in sick days \nand health-related expenditures. This is expected to lead to improved levels of social welfare, and to facilitate efforts to \nimprove economic welfare of beneficiaries that are beyond the specific scope of the Project. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nThe  participation  strategy  for  activities  supported  by  the  Project  will  focus  on  empowering  people,  especially  poor \nfamilies, women, women-headed households, and other vulnerable groups in communities with significant problems of \naccess  to  clean  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  and  of  related  health  problems  due  to  poor  sanitation  and \nhygiene  behavior.  This  will  be  accomplished  through  intensive  community  consultations,  and  the  creation  of \ncommunity  implementation  teams,  which  will  include  representatives  of  the  poor  and  women.  District  government \ntechnical  staff  and  trained  community  facilitators  will  use  Participatory  Hygiene  and  Sanitation  Transformation \n(PHAST)  techniques  to  assist  in  the  creation  and  strengthening  of  these  teams.  The  teams  will  be  responsible  for \n(i) analyzing  their  own  situation  in  terms  of  water,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  behavior  affecting  health;  (ii) formulating \ncommunity actions plans as the basis for project investments; (iii) participating in the implementation and monitoring; \nand  (iv) undertaking  continuous  maintenance  and  operation  activities  in  a  participatory  manner,  with  adequate  cost \nsharing among all community members involved. \n\n \n\n\fResettlement \n\n Not significant \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n49 \n\n \nD.  Gender Development \n\n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe gender and development strategy will include various steps (including PHAST techniques) to enhance women\u2019s \naccess  to  information,  participation  in  water  service,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  behavioral  change  activities,  and  their \nability  to  protect  their  interests  and  improve  their  livelihoods.  Through  gender  sensitization,  use  of  gender-\ndisaggregated data, and gender analyses in the water and health development planning, awareness about gender and \ndevelopment  issues  will  be  created  among  the  local  government  staff  as  well  as  in  community  groups  and  among \nservice  providers.  Where  they  are  active,  the  project  will  seek  to  actively  involve  existing  women\u2019s  groups  or \norganizations in the project structure. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n   No \n\n    Yes (Appendix 9)  \n \n\nE.

However,  many  subprojects  are \nlikely  to  involve  minor  local  land,  right-of-way,  or  asset \nacquisition.  This  will  be  governed  under  the  procedures \noutlined \nthe  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement \nFramework (Appendix 18) prepared for the Project.  \nThe  project  design  is  based  on  experiences  regarding \naffordability  and  cost-recovery,  which  have  proven  to  be \nsuccessful.  When  allowed  to  make  their  own  choice, \ncommunities  tend  to  chose  water  and  sanitation  systems \nthat  are  within  their  overall  affordability  limits.  Additional \nsafeguards are in place to protect access of the poorest in \nproject communities through targeted subsidies. \nNo  disruption  to  existing  patterns  of  economic  activity  is \nanticipated.

The Project is classified as environmental category \nB.  IEEs  for  four  pilot  subprojects  were  carried  out  during  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance,  and  a  summary  of  these  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D.  The  IEE  was  prepared \nbased  on  meetings  held  with  provincial-  and  district-level  environmental  agencies,  reports  by \nrelevant government agencies, and Asian Development Bank (ADB) mission findings, and is in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and applicable environmental legislation and \nregulations of the Government of Indonesia. \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Project and Environment \n\nThe Project will provide rural water supply and sanitation facilities and services to about \n2. \n1,000  communities  in  20  districts  in  the  provinces  of  West  Kalimantan,  Central  Kalimantan, \nJambi, and Bengkulu. Following a demand-driven, community-based approach, the Project will \nprovide an estimated 1.2 million people with safe drinking water, of which about 0.6 million will \nalso benefit from improved sanitation facilities. The Project will also facilitate capacity building of \nlocal  governments  and  the  communities  themselves,  and  raise  awareness  on  appropriate \nsanitation and hygiene behavior to maximize the investment impact.  \n \nExcept for Bengkulu, all project provinces have a distinct dry season which varies from 2 \n3. \nto  5  months  and  enjoy  comparatively  high  annual  rainfall  compared  to  other  regions  of \nIndonesia, i.e., 1,500 millimeters (mm) to 3,400 mm. Water resources are generally abundant in \nthe wet season but extreme water shortages are common during the dry season. Water quality \nis  particularly  poor  in  Central  Kalimantan  during  the  dry  season  due  to  a  combination  of \nnaturally  acidic  soils,  and  poorly-planned  developments  in  the  past  involving  broad-scale \nclearing of forest, which has in some cases led to exposure of acid-sulfate deposits. Much of the \nabundant river water in these areas is only usable during the wet season. There is high reliance \non  purchasing  bottled  water  for  drinking  and  cooking  purposes  in  Central  Kalimantan  and \nJambi. Bengkulu has a much shorter dry season and relatively good quality water.  \n \n4. \nAll  four  provinces  have  had  relatively  small  populations  due  to  a  lack  of  development \nuntil  recent  times.  Growth  rates  in  the  past  10  years  have  been  relatively  high  compared  to \nIndonesia  as  a  whole  due  to  transmigration.  Kalimantan  stands  out  as  being  particularly \nenvironmentally  sensitive.  The  island  has  high  species  richness,  particularly  for  plants,  fish, \namphibians,  reptiles,  and  invertebrates  compared  to  Sumatra  and  other  islands.  At  the  same \ntime,  it  lacks  the  fertile  volcanic  soils,  which  are  the  basis  for  Java\u2019s  agricultural  productivity. \nReflecting  the  paucity  of  suitable  areas  for  intensive  cultivation,  Kalimantan\u2019s  population  is \nclustered on the more fertile alluvial plains, mostly along the rivers and around the coast. The \nlack  of  viable  development  opportunities  will  make  it  more  difficult  to  find  adequate  and \naffordable water and sanitation improvement solutions for these areas.  \n \n5. \nIn  Bengkulu  and  Jambi,  some  of  the  targeted  districts  include  or  adjoin  fragile  and \nsensitive \u201cprotected areas\u201d in the Kerinci Seblat National Park, which stretches over two other \nprovinces  in  Sumatra.  The  natural  ecological  communities  of  the  Kerinci  Seblat  area  are  of \noutstanding  biodiversity  significance.  The  biodiversity  value  of  the  Kerinci  Seblat  area  is \nconsidered  to  be  threatened  by  any  reduction  in  park  area,  and  by  a  host  of  development \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 16 \n\n51 \n\npressures  such  as  access  proposals,  encroachment  for  shifting  cultivation  and  cinnamon \nplantations, and logging in the lowland forests. \n \nC. \n\nPotential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n6. \nPotential impacts of the Project and recommended mitigation measures are indicated in \nTable  A16  below.  The  recommended  measures  are  simple  and  easy  to  integrate  in  the \nfeasibility and detailed engineering design studies.  \n \n\nTable A16: Environmental Impacts and Recommended Mitigation Measures \n\nImpacts \n\nRecommended Mitigation Measures \n\n\u2022  Potential water sources may not meet basic water \n\n\u2022  Where feasible, water treatment at source or \n\nEnvironmental Impacts due to Location: \n\nquality standards due to geological or other \nconditions \n\nEnvironmental Impacts due to Design: \n\n\u2022  Overextraction of water resources, resulting in \nlowering of the groundwater table; increasing \npumping costs; surface subsidence; and \ndeterioration of roads, buildings, and pipelines \n\n\u2022  Pollution of groundwater resources through \n\ninfiltration from pit latrines and overflow from septic \ntanks \n\nEnvironmental Impacts due to Construction: \n\n\u2022  Hazards to workers and nearby residents from \nemissions of dust, fumes, noise and vibrations \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhousehold level \n\n\u2022  Where treatment is not possible (i.e., due to \n\nmercury poisoning), water sources will not be \ntapped \n\n\u2022  Regulation of groundwater extraction to maintain a \n\nlevel less than or equal to the recharge rate \n\n\u2022  Land use and land management/development \n\ncontrols in recharge area; management of human \nand industrial waste disposal procedures; watertight \ncasing for groundwater wells; minimum distance of \n10\u201315 meters between groundwater intake and \nnearest source of pollution; construction of dug \nwells and infiltration galleries in straight line across \nthe direction of groundwater flow; ground surface \naround platform sloping away from well for good \ndrainage \n\n\u2022  Since construction impacts will be of small scale and \nlocalized, use standard operating procedures of the \nMinistry of Public Works  as an attachment to any \nformal construction contract \n\n\u2022  If works are being carried out by communities \n\nthemselves, provide adequate capacity building on \nwater resource conservation, water quality, and \ngeneral environmental awareness through training \npackage \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nD. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Management System \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\nThe  responsibility \n\nimplementation  of \n\n7. \nImpact \nManagement  System  (AMDAL)  has  recently  been  decentralized.  According  to  Ministry  of \nEnvironment  Decree  No.  17/2001,  water  supply  projects  require  a  full  environmental  impact \nassessment if they involve extraction of more than 250 liters per second (l/s). For projects with \nlower  extraction,  which  would  apply  to  all  subprojects  under  the  Project,  it  is  necessary  to \nprepare  a  brief  summary  including  a  checklist  and  management  plan  with  proposed \nenvironmental  measures  to  overcome  any  potential  environmental  impacts.  Given  the  limited \ncapability of environmental agencies at the district level, an environmental training program will \n\nIndonesian  Environmental \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nbe  carried  out  by  provincial  environmental  agencies.1  The  training  program  will  cover  a  2-day \nworkshop  for  targeted  communities  and  will  involve  a  general  introduction  to  potential \nenvironmental  issues  that  communities  may  face  during  planning,  design,  and  implementation \nof  subprojects  (catchment  protection,  impacts  of  illegal  logging  and  mining,  etc.),  and  how  to \ncomply  with  the  simplified  environmental  checklist  and  management  and  monitoring  plan  to \nsatisfy the AMDAL procedures and to ensure that communities understand their responsibilities \nin terms of subproject sustainability. \n \nVillages  submitting  an  expression  of  interest  will  be  prescreened  for  sustainability \n8. \nconsiderations,  based  on  a  proposed  screening  checklist.  The  screening  will  identify  the \nsubproject type, scale, location, sensitivity, and the nature and magnitude of potential impacts.2 \nIf  the  economic  development  opportunities  of  a  village  are  limited,  and  there  are  also  severe \nlocal  environment  constraints  regarding  further  water  resource  exploitation,  investment  in  that \nparticular village would face serious sustainability issues beyond the life of the Project and will \nthus  not  be  pursued.  The  community  facilitators  will  need  to  ensure  that  such  villages  will  be \nscreened out before submitting a letter of intent or a Community Action Plan (CAP).  \n \n9. \nTo  ensure  that  the  Project  takes  full  account  of  its  environmental  responsibilities,  an \nenvironmental  protocol  has  been  prepared  in  draft  form.  Community  facilitators  will  assist \nvillages  in  the  preparation  of  a  standard  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  as \npart  of  the CAP.  The  standard  format  will  include  a  description  of  the  activities  proposed,  and \ncompliance with any applicable guidelines on environmental impacts. All CAPs will be reviewed \nat  the  district  level  for  their  feasibility,  technical  soundness,  and  compliance  with  guidelines \nbefore they are considered for project financing. \n \n10. \nCompliance  with  the  individual  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan will  be \nperiodically  checked  by  the  community  facilitators,  and  the  districts  will  aggregate  and  review \nenvironmental reports and flag them in their quarterly reports. The CPMU will flag them in their \nreports to ADB. \n \nE. \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nPublic consultation is an inherent part of the Project as it is based on the principle that \n11. \ncommunities  develop  their  own  solutions  to  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  health.  Community \nworkshops,  the  socioeconomic  and  health  survey,  and  the  technical  survey  conducted  by  the \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  indicated  the  technical  options  preferred  by  the \ncommunity. During project implementation, each CAP will be publicly displayed and discussed \nin the village so that all stakeholders have ample opportunities to understand and discuss these \nproposals and impacts. \n \nF. \n\nConformity  of  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Procedures  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental and Social Safeguard Policies \n\n12. \nThe  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  have  been  reviewed  and  found \nto  be  satisfactory  and  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies. \nSpecific project monitoring will be carried out during the project implementation to ensure that \nthe guidelines and environmental management system are adhered to.  \n\n                                                 \n1  In three of the four project provinces, this agency is referred to as Bapeldalda. \n2  An environmental screening checklist has been developed and is in the Project Administration Memorandum. \n\n \n\n\f   Appendix 17 \n\n53\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n1. \nFor  this  Project,  a  simplified  approach  for  the  economic  assessment  of  rural  water \nsupply projects has been developed with the Economics and Research Department of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  The  approach  focuses  on  time  savings  as  the  key  indicator  of \nbenefits accruing from rural water supply projects. The purpose is to provide a criterion that can \neasily be applied by district staff responsible for the selection of village subprojects and that, if \nmet,  provides  an  assurance  that  the  village-level  schemes  to  be  constructed  would  meet  the \nnormal tests of financial and economic viability. The proposed criterion is equivalent to requiring \neach subproject to have an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) greater than 12%. The EIRR \nfor  the  sum  of  all  water  supply  facilities  would  therefore  also  be  greater  than  12%.  No  overall \nEIRR has been calculated separately for the whole Project. \n \nB. \n\nTime Savings Benefits \n\nOne  of  the  most  important  measurable  benefits  of  improved  water  supply  systems  in \n2. \nproject villages are the time savings that accrue to households because they no longer have to \ntravel  so  far  to  water  sources.  At  present,  households  travel  considerable  distances  to  water \nsources for drinking, cooking, and other in-house uses, especially in the dry season. Activities \nrequiring larger amounts of water, such as bathing and washing laundry, are carried out at the \nwater  source.  With  project  implementation,  the  greater  ease  of  access  to  water  is  likely  to \nincrease  the  consumption  of  water  at  the  house  and  reduce  the  consumption  at  source, \nalthough where households still have to carry water, some bathing and washing will continue to \ntake place at source rather than at the house. \n \n3. \nFrom the household surveys carried out for the preparation of the initial four subproject \nappraisal  reports,1  data  are  available  on  water  consumption  at  the  house.  This  is  based  on \ninformation  about  the  number  of  water  collecting  trips  made  each  day  by  members  of  the \nhousehold  and  the  average  quantity  of  water  carried  on  each  trip.  The  data  excludes \nconsumption from tap connections and rainwater since there was no way of measuring it.  \n \nTable  A17.1  shows  the  household  and  per  capita2  water  consumption  in  the  surveyed \n4. \nvillages, averaged by province and across the whole sample. The data are weighted averages \nof wet and dry season consumption. In-house consumption has been normalized to include an \nestimate for tap and rain water, based on the average of consumption from other sources. The \nsurvey provides no data on the actual amount of water consumed outside the house but a level \nof twice in-house consumption is probably a good average, based on knowledge of water use \npractices  elsewhere  in  the  country,  in  order  to  give  an  estimate  of  total  water  consumption. \nBased  on  this,  the  average  per  capita  consumption  of  water  in  the  four  project  provinces  is \naround 45 liters per capita per day (lpcd). \n\n                                                 \n1  The surveys conducted in each province covered three villages each in the districts of Landak, Kapuas, Tanjung \n\nJabung Barat, and Bengkulu Utara. \n\n2  Per capita estimates are based on average household size per province, ranging from 5.4 in West Kalimantan to \n\n4.4 in Jambi. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\n \n\nAppendix 17 \n\nTable A17.1: Household Consumption of Water \n\n \n\nLiters per Household per Day \n\nLiters per Capita per Day \n\nIn House \n\nTotal \n\nIn House \n\nTotal \n\nDistrict \n\nLandak \n\nKapuas \n\nTanjung Jabung Barat \n\nBengkulu Utara \n\n     Average \n\nOutside \nHouse \n\n 133 \n\n 217 \n\n 104 \n\n 127 \n\n 145 \n\n 66.3 \n\n 108.5 \n\n 52.1 \n\n 63.4 \n\n 72.6 \n\nOutside \nHouse \n\n 25 \n\n 47 \n\n 24 \n\n 26 \n\n 30 \n\n 12.3 \n\n 23.6 \n\n 11.8 \n\n 12.9 \n\n 15.2 \n\n 199 \n\n 325 \n\n 156 \n\n 190 \n\n 218 \n\n 37 \n\n 71 \n\n 36 \n\n 39 \n\n 45 \n\nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance household survey.  \n\n5. \nTable  A17.2  shows  average  collection  times,  waiting  times,  and  distances  traveled  to \nsources  for  each  district.  These  are  daily  totals,  including  multiple  trips  to  collect  water.  The \ndistances  and  times  are  weighted  averages  of  dry  season  and  wet  season  data.  The  table \nshows that, on average, a household will spend about 8.8 minutes collecting water each day for \nevery 50 meters to the source (or for every 100 meters of the round trip).3  \n\nDistrict \n\nLandak \n\nKapuas \n\nTanjung Jabung Barat \n\nBengkulu Utara \n\n     Average \n\nTable A17.2: Water Collection per Household per Day  \n\nCollection Time \n(minutes) \n\nWaiting Time \n(minutes) \n\nCarrying Distance \n(meters) \n\nCollection Speed \n(kilometers/hour) \n\n 19.8 \n\n 27.6 \n\n 19.0 \n\n 104.5 \n\n 42.7 \n\n 1.0 \n\n 17.2 \n\n 10.8 \n\n 1.7 \n\n 7.7 \n\n 544 \n\n 504 \n\n 221 \n\n 681 \n\n 487 \n\n 1.65 \n\n 1.10 \n\n 0.70 \n\n 0.39 \n\n 0.68 \n\nNote: Times and distances are totals per household per day.

Capital and operation and maintenance \n(O&M)  costs  have  been  estimated  for  various  system  capacity  levels.  Capital  costs  per \nhousehold  range  from  Rp300,000  for  a  well  with  hand  pump  to  Rp3.6 million  for  abstraction \nfrom a river with slow sand filter treatment. O&M costs start under Rp1,000 per household per \nmonth  but  are  significantly  higher  for  the  more  sophisticated  systems  built  for  relatively  small \nnumbers of households.  \n \n7. \nCommunities  will  be  responsible  for  selecting  the  water  supply  system  that  best  suits \ntheir needs. Costs for both construction and O&M will be a significant factor contributing to their \ndecisions. The application of the economic criterion described below will identify the least-cost \noption for each village. However, villages can opt for a higher-level system that costs more as \nlong as they agree to shoulder the additional costs. \n \nAn investment is economically justified if the annual net benefits exceed the annualized \n8. \ncosts  of  the  investment\u2014i.e.,  if  it  has  positive  net  present  value.  Supplementary  Appendix  C \nshows  that  under  certain  conditions,  this  condition  is  met  if  the  daily  time  cost  savings  are \ngreater  than  the  annualized  capital  costs  per  day  plus  the  daily  O&M  costs.  The  criterion  can \nalso  be  expressed  in  terms  of  time  savings  and  costs  per  trip.  This  criterion  must  be  met  by \neach of the proposed village water supply systems. \n\n                                                 \n3  Based on the average collection speed of 0.68 kilometers (km)/hour, which translates into 11.3 meters (m)/minute, \n\nthus 100 m/11.3 = 8.8. \n\n \n\n\f   Appendix 17 \n\n55\n\n \nThe economic analysis is based on an asset life of 15 years for all technical options. The \n9. \ndomestic  price  numeraire  is  used,  with  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.11  applied  to  the \nforeign  exchange  portion  of  costs  (mostly  pumps)  and  a  standard  wage  rate  factor  of  0.8  for \nunskilled labor costs. Local material costs are not adjusted. \n \n10. \nThe criterion has been applied to the 12 villages surveyed for the original four subproject \nappraisal  reports.  These  villages  represent  a  wide  range  of  situations.  The  two  tables  below \nshow the results of applying the economic criterion for two different system options: (i) a spring \nsource with gravity supply (Table A17.3) and (ii) shallow wells with hand pumps (Table A17.4). \nWhen  an  option  meets  the  economic  criterion  for  a  particular  village,  this  is  equivalent  to  it \nhaving an EIRR greater than 12% for that case. \n \n\nTable A17.3: Results of the Economic Test for Spring Source with Gravity Supply \n\n \n\nVillage \n\nJangkang \n\nG-5 Manggala Permai \n\nBatanjung \n\nKerohok \n\nDarit \n\nSekendal \n\nPulau Pauh \n\nTanjung Sayas \n\nBetara Kiri \n\nSuka Merindu \n\nMarga Sakti \n\nNo. of \nHouse-\nholds \n\nDaily \nCapital \n(Rp) \n\nTotal \nCost/Trip \n(hours) \n\nCarrying \nTime/Trip \n(hours) \n\nPass Test \n\nDaily \nOperation \nand \nMaintenance \n(Rp) \n\n387 \n\n188 \n\n459 \n\n223 \n\n661 \n\n630 \n\n240 \n\n205 \n\n1026 \n\n156 \n\n1891 \n\n16,047 \n\n12,209 \n\n16,047 \n\n10,466 \n\n18,840 \n\n18,840 \n\n3,086 \n\n3,086 \n\n5,556 \n\n3,409 \n\n8,280 \n\n23,748 \n\n20,954 \n\n23,748 \n\n20,954 \n\n29,336 \n\n29,336 \n\n20,954 \n\n20,954 \n\n29,336 \n\n20,954 \n\n8,280 \n\n0.019 \n\n0.154 \n\n0.084 \n\n0.063 \n\n0.041 \n\n0.020 \n\n0.022 \n\n0.028 \n\n0.031 \n\n0.018 \n\n0.002 \n\n0.019 \n\n0.500 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.038 \n\n0.065 \n\n0.023 \n\n0.017 \n\n0.021 \n\n0.285 \n\n0.022 \n\n0.000 \n\nNo \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\nTalang Rasau \nNote:  Total  cost/trip  (hours)  is  derived  from  daily  capital  and  daily  operation  and  maintenance  by  dividing  by  the \neconomic opportunity cost per hour of carrying water. \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance household survey estimates. \n\n23,748 \n\n4,481 \n\n0.006 \n\n0.016 \n\nYes \n\n443 \n\n \n\nFor  each  of  these  options  there  is  one  village  (Jangkang  for  Option  1,  Pulau  Pauh  for \n11. \nOption 2), which only just fails to meet the economic criterion.

The  analysis  of  water  supply  projects  usually  makes  a  distinction \nbetween  incremental  water  (the  additional  water  provided  by  the  project)  and  nonincremental \nwater  (the  water  provided  by  the  project  that  replaces  preproject  consumption  from  other \nsources).  The  volume  of  incremental  water  in  project  villages  will  depend  on  present  total \nconsumption levels (including consumption both at the house and at source) and the technical \noption  selected  by  villages  for  implementation.  Comparing  the  household  survey  data  with \nexpected  per  capita  with  project  consumption  levels,  it  appears  that  incremental  at-the-house \nconsumption is likely to be in the range of 10-40 lpcd. The economic test takes into account all \nfuture in-house consumption, both nonincremental and incremental, and values all in proportion \nto the cost and time savings of the new water source. \n \nHealth.  Access  to  improved  water  supplies  will  have  a  beneficial  effect  on  community \n13. \nhealth  by  reducing  the  incidence  of  waterborne  and  water-related  diseases.  More  water \nconsumption at the house will help households maintain better sanitary and hygiene conditions \nin their dwellings. Where new, unpolluted water sources will be tapped, or where filter units at \nsource or at household level will be installed, the quality of the water provided will also increase \nsignificantly,  thus  reducing  the  risk  of  consuming  contaminated  water.  Polluted  water  causes \ndiarrhea, which has a drastic impact on child morbidity and mortality, and on child growth and \nintellectual development over the long term. With lower levels of these diseases, households will \nlose  fewer  days  of  work  (or  education  for  children)  to  ill  health.  Achieving  these  benefits \ndepends  not  only  on  the  new  water  supply  systems  but  also  on  changing  individual  and \nhousehold  behavior  and  practices,  and  they  therefore  accrue  in  a  less  certain  manner  than \nfinancial benefits or time savings. Health benefits are not included among the benefits counted \nfor the simplified economic analysis but should be in marginal cases as mentioned above. \n\n14. \nSanitation. The adoption of improved sanitation facilities will add to the health benefits \nof  subprojects.  For  assessing  the  subprojects,  these  additional  benefits  are  not  considered \nseparately from the health benefits. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f   Appendix 17 \n\n57\n\n \nD. \n\nApplication of the Simplified Economic Assessment for Subprojects \n\n15. \nTo  apply  the  economic  criterion  for  the  selection  water  supply  schemes  for  villages \nunder the Project, it is only necessary that a survey be implemented in each candidate village in \norder  to  estimate  the  average  current  in-house  consumption  per  household  per  day,  average \ndistance to water sources, average number of trips per day per household, average time spent \ncollecting water per day, and average time spent waiting at source for water. Together with the \ndesign  criteria  for  the  scheme,  which  will  provide  an  estimate  of  the  future  collection  distance \nand  future  waiting  time  for  water  at  source,  this  is  sufficient  to  determine  time  cost  savings. \nSample survey sizes for each village should be 20% for villages with less than 100 households; \n10% for villages of 100\u2013300 households; and 5% for villages with more than 300 households. \n \nCapital  and  O&M  costs  for  each  option  have  been  calculated  during  the  project \n16. \npreparatory technical assistance and are in Supplementary Appendix C. The annualized costs \ndepend also on the life of the Project, the opportunity cost of capital, and the annual growth rate \nof benefits (for which the annual growth rate of population is used as a proxy). The opportunity \ncost of capital and project life are the same for all villages. Population growth rates are available \nfor  each  district.  Thus  annualized  capital  costs  are  constant  across  all  the  villages  in  each \ndistrict.  These  have  been  estimated  and  can  be  provided  to  district  staff  to  facilitate  their \napplication of the economic criterion.4 \n \nE. \n\nWillingness and Capacity to Pay, and Poverty Impacts \n\nIn the 12 villages surveyed, 90% of households expressed a readiness to pay for water. \n17. \nAverage  willingness  to  pay  (WTP)  for  a  household  connection  varied  from  Rp30,000  to \nRp134,000.  Comparing  the  average  WTP  on  a  monthly  basis  with  O&M  costs  suggests  that \nmost  villages  would  be  able  to  find  affordable  options,  at  least  as  far  as  O&M  costs  are \nconcerned, and bearing in mind that at least part of the O&M costs would be provided in kind \nrather  than  in  cash.  Only  a  few  options  have  monthly  O&M  costs  greater  than  Rp5,000  per \nhousehold. Higher levels of O&M are associated with smaller systems and with pumping rather \nthan gravity flow for piped systems. Sustainability will depend in part upon ensuring that villages \nselect a technical option that is affordable for them to maintain. \n \n18. \nTo  facilitate  participation  by  poor  households,  the  expected  monthly  O&M  charge  for \neach household should not be greater than 5% of income for poor households. Since there are \nno published data available on actual incomes of different groups at village level, the simplest \nway to apply this criterion is to identify the scale of system for the proposed options above under \nwhich  the  criterion  is  likely  to  be  met  in  most  circumstances.  For  example,  piped  systems  for \n300  households  or  less  should  include  public  hydrants  for  poor  households,  river  abstraction \nwith  slow  sand  filter  treatment  and  piped  distribution  should  not  be  set  up  for  more  than  300 \nhouseholds,  deep  wells  with  public  hydrant  should  serve  at  least  150  households  in  poor  and \nvery poor areas, and shallow wells with hand pumps should serve at least five households per \nwell  for  poor  and  very  poor  households.  Estimates  of  O&M  costs  as  a  percentage  of  poor \nhousehold income are shown in Supplementary Appendix C. \n\n                                                 \n4  A step-by-step explanation for district staff applying the test for the economic criterion is provided in Attachment 5 \n\nto Supplementary Appendix C. \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 18 \n\nA. \n\nBackground \n\nLAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n\nThe Project provides support for community-led efforts in water supply and sanitation in \n1. \nsubproject  schemes  through  an  intensive  community-based  participatory  process.  Of  the  20 \nproject  districts,  none  will  require  any  resettlement,  but  all  will  require  minor  land  right-of-way \nand  asset  acquisition.  Measures  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project  design  to  adequately \naddress land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) during the course of project implementation. \n \nB. \n\nGeneral Policy \n\nLAR  issues  will  be  handled  in  accordance  with  national  law  and  relevant  Asian \n2. \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  policies.  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement  policy  (as  detailed  in  the \nADB Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice) requires loan financed projects to \nprepare  (i) a  compensation  policy  framework  and  procedural  guidelines  (CPFPG)  for  the \nsubprojects,  (ii) an  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  for  each  subproject  indicating  the \nmagnitude  of  LAR  impacts,  and  (iii) land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  (LARPs)  for  each \nsubproject whose initial poverty and social assessment indicates significant LAR impacts.  \n \nC. \n\nCompensation Policy Framework and Procedural Guidelines \n\n3. \nThe  CPFPG  reflects  the  main  LAR  preparation  and  implementation  principles.  These \ninclude:  (i) negative  impacts  will  be  minimized  as  much  as  possible,  (ii) compensation  will  be \nsufficient  to  improve  or  at  least  restore  preproject  incomes  and  living  standards  of  affected \npersons,  (iii) affected  persons  will  be  fully  consulted  on  compensation  options  and  land \nacquisition planning, (iv) asset compensation will be provided at replacement rates, and (v) lost \nasset  compensation  and  rehabilitation  provisions/allowances  will  be  provided  in  full  before \nground  leveling  and  demolition.  ADB  approval  of  a  subproject  involving  significant  land \nacquisition or resettlement will be subject to ADB's approval of the LARP. \n \n4. \nThe CPFPG stipulates eligibility and entitlements for land and eventual house or income \nlosses,  and  sets  rehabilitation  subsidies  as  follows:  (i) permanent  agricultural/residential  land \nlosses  will  be  compensated  in  cash  at  market  rates;  (ii) temporary  land  losses  will  be  paid  in \ncash at market rates; (iii) house and building losses will be compensated in cash at replacement \nrates, free of demolition expenses and salvaged materials; (iv) crop losses will be paid in cash \nat  market  rates;  (v) relocation  expenses  covering  transport  costs  will  be  paid  to  the  affected \npersons;  and  (vi) compensation  for  business  losses  based  on  tax  declarations  will  be  paid  to \neach  affected  person  for  each  month  of  interruption  of  business  activities.  The  CPFPG \nestablishes  that  (i) after  subproject  identification  and  completion  of  preliminary  design,  the \ndistrict  government  will  carry  out  an  initial  social  assessment  (ISA)  to  determine  preliminary \nimpact  data  and  the  socioeconomic  features  of  the  affected  persons;  (ii) if  subproject  impacts \nare  identified  as  significant,  a  full  LARP  will  be  prepared;  (iii) if  impacts  are  identified  as  less \nthan significant, a short LARP will be prepared. \n \n5. \nThe CPFPG also details the main organizational features and tasks of the LAR process. \nThe Government will ensure that there are sufficient funds to cover LAR costs. The Minister of \nHome  Affairs  has  overall  supervisory,  review,  and  financial  responsibility  for  the  LAR. \nCommunity groups will prepare and implement specific LARPs with the full participation of their \nmembers  and  support  of  district  project  management  units  (DPMUs)  for  tasks  such  as  asset \nvaluation;  entitlement  delivery;  and  issuance  of  land  acquisition,  demolition,  and  building \n\n \n\n\f   Appendix 18 \n\n59\n\npermits.  Field  tasks  such  as  paying  compensation,  selecting  replacement  land,  and  providing \nlivelihood support will rest with village personnel. Subproject schemes, including LARPs, will be \ndesigned and implemented by the community groups based on a community action plan (CAP) \nprepared  with  the  full  participation  of  group  members  and  beneficiary  communities.  A  primer \nsummarizing the CPFPG will be sent to all affected persons. The CPFPG and LARP in Bahasa \nIndonesia  will  be  made  available  at  the  village  office  of  each  scheme  that  requires  land \nacquisition.  The  same  documents  in  English  will  be  put  on  the  ADB  web  site.  Primers  for \nsubprojects in indigenous peoples\u2019 areas will be compiled in local languages. \n \n6. \nBoth internal and external monitoring will be carried out. The district government will set \nup  a  monthly  reporting  system  involving  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  units.  External \nmonitoring will be assigned to an independent institution such as a nongovernment organization \n(NGO)  or  a  local  university,  and  will  be  carried  out  on  a  selective  basis  for  schemes  with \nsubstantial  impacts  resulting  from  LAR  and/or  involvement  of  vulnerable  peoples.  External \nmonitoring will be conducted through field visits, and monitoring reports will be submitted to the \nDPMU, which in turn will pass them to the central project management unit (CPMU). At project \nconclusion,  the  external  monitoring  agency  will  prepare  a  report  providing  a  comprehensive \nevaluation of the LAR program. \n \n7. \nUnit  compensation  rates  for  items  negatively  affected  by  each  subproject  and  detailed \nbudgets  for  impacts  compensation  will  be  provided  in  each  LARP.  Cost  estimates  will  be \nadjusted annually, based on the inflation rate of the preceding year. \n \nD. \n\nGuidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition \n\n8. \nLand acquisition will be kept to a minimum. No person will be physically displaced from \ntheir  places  of  residence  by  subprojects  financed  under  the  Project.  Subproject  proposals \nrequiring  demolition  of  buildings  or  acquiring  productive  land  should  be  carefully  reviewed  to \nreduce  their  negative  impacts  through  alternative  alignments  or  locations  for  pipes,  wells, \nsanitation facilities, or selection of alternative water sources. \n \n9. \nLand or other assets may be acquired through (i) voluntary contribution: in accordance \nwith traditional practices, villagers may elect to voluntarily contribute land or other assets and/or \nrelocate  temporarily  or  permanently  from  their  land  without  compensation;  or  (ii) contribution \nagainst  compensation:  a  contributor  considered  a  \u201cproject-affected  person\u201d  will  be  eligible  for \ncompensation from the village. Voluntary contributions will be closely monitored to ensure that \nno  coercion  is  exercised.  In  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines,  any  voluntary  donation  will  be \nconfirmed through oral and written record and verified by the community facilitator or any other \nindependent third party. \n \nThese  guidelines  provide  principles  and  instructions  to  compensate  affected  persons \n10. \nunder  (ii) above,  to  ensure  that  all  such  persons  negatively  affected,  regardless  of  their  land \ntenure  status,  will  be  assisted  to  improve,  or  at  least  restore,  their  living  standards,  income \nearning,  or  production  capacity  to  preproject  levels.  However,  if  acquired  assets  are  less  than \n20% of the total value of the subproject, the village facilitator may dispense with the procedural \nrequirements delineated in para. 12 below. \n \nE. \n\nCompensation Principles \n\n11. \nThe village government will ensure that any of the following means of compensation are \nprovided in a timely manner to \u201cproject-affected persons\u201d (ADB loan funds cannot be used for \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 18 \n\ncompensation):  (i) replacement  land  with  an  equally  productive  plot  or  equivalent  productive \nasset;  (ii) materials  and  assistance  to  replace  fully  solid  structures  that  will  be  demolished; \n(iii) replacement of damaged or lost crops, at market value; (iv) cash payment at market value \nfor other noncrop assets; or (v) other acceptable in-kind compensation. \n\n \n12. \nThe  village  government  will  ensure  that  all  occupants  of  land  and  owners  of  assets \nlocated in a proposed subproject area are consulted. There will be a village meeting to inform \nvillagers  about  their  rights  to  compensation  and  options  available  in  accordance  with  these \nguidelines. The minutes of the village meeting will reflect the discussions held and agreements \nreached,  including  (i) for  any  voluntary  contribution,  the  name  of  the  contributor  and  details  of \nthe  contribution;  and  (ii) for  land/asset  acquisition  against  compensation,  names  of  project-\naffected persons and details about the nature and level of compensation as summarized in the \nexample below. \n  \n\nTable A18: Sample Compensation Form \n \n\nCompensation Amount and Type \n \n \n\nSummary Agreement Reached \nAgricultural land (square meters) \nPlots affected (square meters) \nHouses/structure to be demolished (units/square meters) \nTrees or crops affected \nOther deleterious impact (loss of income) \nSignatures of villagers, village chief \nRecord of complaints filed by affected persons \nMap showing affected area and replacement area \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n13. \nThe  community  facilitator  will  provide  a  copy  of  the  minutes  to  affected  persons  and \nconfirm with them their requests and preferences for compensation, agreements reached, and \nany eventual complaint. Copies will be recorded in the CAP and be available for review. \n \nF. \n\nSubproject Approval \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nIn  the  event  that  a  subproject  involves  acquisition  against  compensation,  the  village \n14. \nfacilitator  will  (i) not  approve  the  subproject  unless  a  satisfactory  compensation  has  been \nagreed between the project-affected person(s) and the village government; (ii) not allow works \nto begin until compensation has been completed satisfactorily; and (iii) prepare a compensation \nplan for CPMU and ADB approval if more than 200 persons are affected. \n \nG. \n\nComplaints and Grievances \n\nAll  complaints  should  first  be  lodged  and  negotiated  within  the  community  group.  If  no \n15. \nsettlement is reached within 2 weeks, the complainant will have 1 month to raise the case with \nthe  DPMU,  copy  to  ADB.  If  this  fails  to  illicit  a  satisfactory  response  within  2  weeks,  the \ncomplaint  may  be  directed  to  the  district  head  for  a  decision.  All  complaints  not  solved  at  the \nvillage level should be copied to the CPMU and ADB. Final appeal is available in the courts. \n \nH. \n\nVerification \n\nThe village minutes and evidence of compensation having been made will be provided to \n16. \nthe  community  facilitator  assisting  the  village,  as  well  as  to  supervising  consultants,  auditors, \nand project monitoring and evaluation teams. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 24 February 2005) \n", "Currency Unit \nRp1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "rupiah (Rp) \n$0.000111 \nRp9,210 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nBadan Perencanaan Pembangunan Daerah  \n(Regional Development Planning Agency) \nBadan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional \n(National Development Planning Agency) \ncommunity action plan \ncommunity-based organization \ncommunity facilitator team \ncommunity implementation team \ncentral project management unit \ncentral support team \ndistrict project management unit \n", "district support team \nExecuting Agency \neconomic internal rate of return \nexpression of interest \ninformation-education-communication \ninitial environmental examination \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah (local legislative assembly) \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Millennium Development Goal \n\u2013  management information system \n\u2013  Ministry of Health \n\u2013  Ministry of National Education \n\u2013  Ministry of Public Works \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "nongovernment organization \noperation and maintenance \nPerusahaan Daerah Air Minum (regional water supply enterprise) \nparticipatory hygiene and sanitation transformation \nprocess monitoring consultant \nproject performance monitoring system \nproject preparatory technical assistance \nprovincial support team \nsanitation and hygiene behavioral change \n", " \nNOTE \n", " \nADB \nBAPPEDA \n", "BAPPENAS \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "CAP \nCBO \nCFT \nCIT \nCPMU \nCST \nDPMU \nDPRD \nDST \nEA \nEIRR \nEOI \nIEC \nIEE \nMDG \nMIS \nMOH \nMONE \nMPW \nNGO \nO&M \nPDAM \nPHAST \nPMC \nPPMS \nPPTA \nPST \nSHBC \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \nThis report was prepared by a team consisting of A.
