The program will accomplish this by building on long-\nstanding support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for government-led reforms to expand \neconomic opportunities and develop the private sector.1 The programmatic approach, with  one \nsubprogram in 2020 and  one in 2022, recognizes that reforms of this nature are  complex and \nrequire  strong  ownership  from  the  government  and  a  medium-term  horizon.  The  approach  (i) \nallows  a  degree  of  flexibility  in  aligning  policy  actions  with  macroeconomic  conditions;  and  (ii) \nsupports institutional capacity development, allowing for the implementation of policies, laws, and \nregulations methodically and chronologically. The key reforms will be delivered through a set of \npolicy actions sequenced in two subprograms, with subprogram 2 building on the progress made \nunder  subprogram  1.  Subprogram  1  consists  of  12  policy  actions,  all  of  which  have  been \naccomplished.  Subprogram  1  focuses  on  formulation  of  the  sector  policy  and  guidelines,  and \nchanging institutional structure to build the foundation for substantive reforms to improve banking \nsector  stability,  financial  sector  oversight  and  development,  as  well  as  fiscal  management. \nSubprogram 2 will align these policy and institutional reforms to the country\u2019s legal and regulatory \nframework,  and  support  implementation  of  financial  sector  development  strategy  and  fiscal \nmanagement  improvement  policies.  The targets  and  indicators  for  each  reform will  be  tracked \nthrough the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). The programmatic approach has a \nresults orientation, where upstream reforms are followed by effective downstream implementation \nand monitoring. \n\nA. \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nDevelopment  context.  Tajikistan\u2019s  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  at  an \n3. \naverage  of  7.2%  in  2016\u20132019,  driven  mainly  by  substantial  foreign  and  domestic  public \ninvestment,  remittance-funded  consumption,  and  services.  However,  the  economy  remains \nvulnerable  to  external  shocks  because  of  its  narrow  export  base  and  high  dependence  on \nremittance inflows, mainly from the Russian Federation, which amounted to 33.4% of the $8.2 \nbillion  GDP  in  2019.2 Economic  vulnerabilities  are  exacerbated  by  (i)  a  fragile  banking  sector \nineffective  in  performing  financial  intermediation,  (ii)  the  country\u2019s  close  correlation  with  the \nRussian  Federation\u2019s business  cycle,  (iii)  a  less-developed  private  sector,  and  (iv)  weak  fiscal \nmanagement. Challenges in the financial sector, including a high level of nonperforming loans \n(NPLs), weak macroprudential oversight, prevalence of state-owned commercial banks, lack of a \nsector  development  strategy,  and  an  underdeveloped  domestic  bond  market,  dominate  the \nchallenges in economic management. These factors impair not only economic development and \npoverty reduction but also the efficiency of public investment. \n\n4. \nThe  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  is  causing  significant  socioeconomic \nshock to Tajikistan. Key transmission mechanisms include  the abrupt reduction in remittances, \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\ninternational trade, and foreign direct investment; and slowdowns in transport, tourism, retail, and \nfinance industries. ADB forecasts that GDP will contract by 0.5% in 2020.3 International Monetary \nFund (IMF) also forecasts in September 2020, economic growth will decelerate sharply from 7.5% \nof GDP in 2019 to 1.0% in 2020. The fiscal deficit declined to 2.1% of GDP in 2019 but is expected \nto increase to 6.0% in 2020 because of substantial losses in revenues, which dropped by 2.2% \nof GDP during the first half of 2020, and the need to accommodate additional expenditure to fund \nthe  government\u2019s  countercyclical  response  to  the  pandemic.  Unemployment  and  poverty  are \nexpected to rise further because of containment measures  undertaken in May\u2013June 2020 and \nthe continuing lockdown. During the first half of 2020, the volume of remittances from the Russian \nFederation dropped by 38.7% because of the 57.0% decline in migration caused by the lockdown, \nand the 12.9% depreciation of the ruble against the United States dollar.4 The loss of remittance \nearnings had a significant negative social impact since more than 50% of households, mostly in \nthe poorest regions, rely primarily on remittances for their source of income.5 Unemployment is \nexpected to rise from 2.0% in February 2020 to 6.1% by the end of 2020. \n\n5. \nBinding constraints. The economy is dominated by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the \n23 largest of which collectively account for about 10% of total public sector employment.6 SOEs \naccount for more than 40.0% of total value added and are present in 21 out of 28 sectors, a share \nthat  is  considerably  above  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development \naverage  of  13.7%.  A  large  part  of  the  economy  is  informal  and  cash-based,  especially  in \nagriculture, retail trade, and consumer services. This structure has major  negative implications \nthat limit financial sector development and its capacity to support economic growth. Strong public \nfinancial management (PFM) will improve the allocative efficiency of scarce public resources by \nintroducing  fiscal  discipline  in  expenditure  allocation.  This  measure,  in  conjunction  with  strong \nrevenue mobilization efforts, will augment the fiscal space for public investment in high-quality \nkey economic infrastructure and public services needed to crowd in private investment. The main \nobjective of the National Development Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan for the Period up to \n2030 (NDS 2030) is to improve the standard of living by transitioning to an economy dominated \nby  industry.7 Accelerated  industrialization  is  expected  to  increase  labor  productivity,  which  will \nboost disposable income. The transition will be accomplished by implementing structural reforms. \nThe program will help the government achieve this objective through (i) enhanced banking sector \nstability, (ii) improved enabling environment for the financial sector, and (iii) strengthened fiscal \nmanagement. \n\n6. \nBanking sector instability. Banking sector is fragile because of several factors. It has \nyet  to  recover  from  the  2015  financial  crisis  that  left  two  large  banks  insolvent  because  of \nexcessive related-party lending, despite being recapitalized by the government, with their clients\u2019 \naccess to their deposit accounts restricted. Banking sector continues to suffer from a high level \nof NPLs, with a ratio of 31% for the entire banking system, and 19.4%, excluding the two insolvent \nbanks  at  the  end  of  June  2020.  Banks  dominate  the  financial  sector  with  commercial  banks \nholding 85% of all financial assets and about 43% of banking assets controlled by state-owned \ncommercial  banks.  The  insurance  industry  is  exceedingly  small,  with  insurance  penetration  at \n\n \n\n3  ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook 2020 Update.

Dushanbe. \n\n \n\n\fonly 0.34% of GDP in 2018.8 The limited range of financial products and expectation for credit \nlosses contribute to high-risk premiums. Borrowing costs are high (with average interest rates of \nmore  than  22.5%  in  national  currency  and  13.0%  in  foreign  currency)  driven  by  the  lack  of \ncompetition,  high  transaction  and  administration  costs,  and  asymmetric  information  between \nborrowers and lenders. While overall bank liquidity appears sufficient, with the liquidity ratio (liquid \nassets over short-term liabilities up to 30 days) standing at 65% as of 30 June 2020, compared \nwith a 30% requirement, most liabilities have a short tenor, causing banks to be hesitant to lend \nlong term.9 The high cost of borrowing has dampened loan demand and contributed to reduced \ncredit  to  the  private  sector,  which  fell  from  23%  of  GDP  in  2015  to  12%  in  2018.  Given  the \nimpediments to credit access, firms resort to other options for raising capital, including selling of \nassets and informal borrowing. Directed lending to SOEs has crowded out private borrowing and \ninvestment and increased NPLs and overall financial system risk and instability.10 The share of \noutstanding loans to SOEs increased from 15.0% of total loans (TJS773 million or $162.4 million) \nin 2012 to 26.6% of total loans (TJS2.6 billion or $252.0 million) by the end of June 2020.11 Weak \nbanking system performance lowered public confidence in the sector, encouraging households to \nkeep  savings  outside  the  financial  system.  The  Individuals  Deposit  Insurance  Fund  (IDIF) \nprovides coverage up to about $2,900 per person; however, its resources are insufficient to pay \ncurrently  insured  depositors  in  case  of  a  systemic  banking  crisis  or  liquidation  of  an  insolvent \nbank.12 A back-up funding mechanism for IDIF to cover potential shortfalls in reserves is not in \nplace, posing negative consequences for financial stability and public confidence. The financial \nposition of IDIF is jeopardized as it is authorized to invest only in government securities, which \nare issued at a low annual interest rate of 0.99%. Low domestic savings, a high share of cash in \nthe money supply, and a 20% drop in the total value of deposits held by individuals in banks in \n2015\u20132019 all reflect the public\u2019s lack of confidence in the banking system.13 \n\n7. \nWeaknesses  in  financial  sector  oversight  and  development.  No  medium-term \nfinancial sector strategy exists to help guide financial market development. The National Bank of \nTajikistan (NBT) is responsible for supervising financial sector, overseeing financial stability, and \nconducting macroprudential policy.14 While financial system oversight has evolved, deficiencies \nremain  within  the  NBT\u2019s  institutional  framework,  macroprudential  surveillance,  analysis,  and \npolicy tools. Insurance regulation is not in full compliance with international standards, and capital \nrequirements for private insurers are extremely low. The regulatory mechanism for Islamic and \ntraditional  banks  is  designed  to  generally  provide  equitable  conditions.  However,  the  law  on \nIslamic banking has shortcomings, hindering the development of Islamic finance. The law does \nnot contain provisions defining the features of banking or insurance transactions consistent with \nthe principles of murabaha (markup), mudaraba (labor), ijara (leasing), and takaful (insurance). \nThe  lack  of  a  well-functioning  government  bond  market  negatively  impacts  capital  market \ndevelopment  and  the  creation  of  a  domestic  benchmark  yield  curve.  The  securities  market  is \ncentered on issuance of short-term government securities at a fixed 0.99% interest rate, which \n\n \n\n8  V.  Gorchakov,  H.  Alvarez,  and  D.  Anokhov.  2019.

Banking Statistics Bulletin. August. Dushanbe. \n12 As of the end of 2019, IDIF reserves were about TJS285 million. Should the two state-owned and insolvent banks \nbe resolved, IDIF would have about TJS35 million in reserves remaining after paying insured depositors, against the \nrequired TJS90 million in minimum capital. \n\n13 At the end of 2018, the share of cash (M0), checking deposits, and near money (M2) averaged 78% of the money \nsupply, which was significantly greater than that of peer countries with similar per capita income (25% average). \n\n14 Macroprudential regulation refers to the use of policy tools to mitigate systemic risk in the financial system. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nresults in small volumes and little investor demand.15 IDIF is the only purchaser of these securities \nand no secondary market exists. \n\n8. \nWeaknesses in fiscal management. The recently approved Tajikistan Public Financial \nManagement  Reform  Strategy  2019\u20132030  (PFMRS  2030)  identified  several  constraints  on \nachieving  effective  PFM,16 including  (i)  the  lack  of  an  effective  medium-term  budget  plan;  (ii) \nlimited  budget  transparency;  and  (iii)  an  inadequate  financial  reporting  system  for  SOEs, \nparticularly  on  the  treatment  of  their  debts  and  associated  fiscal  risks.  There  is  no  unified \nframework for managing a public investment program. Public investment management (PIM) is \nfragmented among various agencies and in some cases guided by the rules and regulations of \nfunding partners. Robust PIM practices are lacking that would better link the public investment \nprogram portfolio with needed development strategies through a vigorous appraisal process and \nindependent  assessment  of  investment  proposals.  While  the  2017  Public  Expenditure  and \nFinancial  Accountability  assessment  reflected  some  progress  since  2017  in  PFM,  including \ngradual improvement in the comprehensiveness of annual budget information and predictability \nand control in budget execution, weaknesses remain in financial data integrity and external audit. \nA  medium-term  perspective  needs  to  be  embedded  in  expenditure  budgeting,  to  comply  with \ninternationally  recognized  accounting  standards  and  to  strengthen  fiscal  risk  management  of \nSOEs.  To  reduce  Tajikistan\u2019s  vulnerability  to  economic  shocks,  maintain  growth,  and  improve \nsocial development, PFM must be further strengthened by removing constraints on it. Strong PFM \nwill improve allocative efficiency of scarce public resources, which will augment the fiscal space \nfor  public  investment  to  crowd  in  private investment  and  contribute  to  economic development. \nUnclear taxation of certain financial services (insurance and Islamic finance) significantly affects \ntheir viability. Gaps in the tax code and distortive tax collection practices pose a significant barrier \nto private sector investment. \n\n9. \nADB engagement. Overall, ADB engagement has helped the government achieve critical \nstructural reforms that supported the expansion of economic opportunities and improvements to \nthe private investment climate. The proposed program builds upon successful reforms under the \nADB  Investment  Climate  Reforms  Program,  subprograms  1  and  2  for  improving  private \ninvestment  (footnote  1).  The  choice  of  a  policy-based  grant  modality  for  the  program  allows \ncombining  policy  dialogue  with  technical  assistance  (TA)  and  diagnostic  studies  that  support \nmeaningful policy reforms. In designing the program, ADB closely coordinated with development \npartners, including the IMF and the World Bank, to identify key reform areas that will accelerate \nand sustain medium-term growth. \n\nLessons.  Key  lessons  identified  from  interventions  and  experience  with  policy-based \n10. \nlending in Central Asia have been incorporated into the program\u2019s design, including the following: \n(i)  utilization  of  long-term  programmatic  assistance  is  best  placed  to  support  medium-term \ninvestment and business climate reforms, (ii) strong government ownership of reforms is critical \nto achieving results, (iii) the sustainability of reforms can be better ensured through the concurrent \nuse of focused TA support to guide implementation, (iv) the design of the program would have \nbenefited from leveraging critical reform progress from earlier policy-based operations, and (v) \nfocused  and  highly  impactful  policy  actions  should  be  pursued  to  help  ensure  that  the  reform \nprogram can be carried out effectively and that implementing agencies are fully connected to the \nprocess.17 \n\n \n\n15 The State Treasury Bills\u2019 rate has been capped by the Ministry of Finance at 0.99% per annum since 2016. \n16 Government of Tajikistan.

NDS 2030 identifies a number of problems hindering the \nfinancial sector, including (i) inefficient domestic resource mobilization for domestic lending and \ninvestment,  (ii)  low  level  of  capitalization  of  financial  institutions,  (iii)  limited  diversification  of \nfinancial products and channels, and (iv) high price of financial services. The PFMRS 2030 directs \nPFM reforms, underpinned by a four-pronged objective to ensure (i) fiscal discipline, (ii) allocative \nefficiency, (iii) operational efficiency, and (iv) transparency and accountability of public resources. \nThe program is closely aligned with the objectives of the strategies and ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy  for  Tajikistan,  2016\u20132020  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  for \nTajikistan,  2020\u20132022.  The  program  builds  on  ADB\u2019s  long-standing  support  to  Tajikistan  for \nbusiness  and  investment  climate  reforms  and  financial  sector  development.18 The  program  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and its focus on strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity by supporting public management reforms and financial sustainability, improving service \ndelivery, and accelerating progress in gender equality.19 \n\n12. \nReform area 1: Banking sector stability enhanced. The program will enhance banking \nsector  stability  and  improve  public  confidence  in  the  financial  system  by  (i)  helping  IDIF  fund \npayouts to depositors in the event of insolvency of an insured financial institution; (ii) improving \nthe ability of the NBT to monitor and manage financial stability and banking  sector soundness; \nand  (iii)  increasing  the  capacity  of  the  NBT  to  measure  and  manage  credit  risks  in  financial \ninstitutions  and  preventing  excessive  concentration  of  loans  to  SOEs,  which  can  pose  default \nrisks. The government adopted a resolution to provide a loan to IDIF covering any capital shortfall \nif  its  resources  are  insufficient,  so  it  can  pay  insured  depositors  during  the  liquidation  of  an \ninsolvent  bank.  This  measure  will  help  the  government  solve  lingering  banking  problems  as  it \nexpedites the adoption of a resolution mechanism for insolvent banks, as has been emphasized \nby development partners since 2017.20 IDIF adopted a resolution that indicates steps to resolve \nthe fund\u2019s current capital deficit by making participation in the fund mandatory for all banks and \ngradually raising the coverage amount for insured deposits to increase confidence in the banking \nsystem. The NBT\u2019s ability to monitor and manage financial stability and banking sector soundness \nwas improved through several actions. The NBT issued a regulation requiring banks to improve \ntheir operational risk management. The Law on Banking was amended expanding fit-and-proper \nrequirements that vet the professional competence and reliability of banks\u2019 management, board, \nand audit committee, to better control conflicts of interest. The NBT expanded the stress-testing \nframework for financial stability, improving macroprudential surveillance and analysis. To increase \nbanks\u2019 soundness and ability to manage risks while retaining sufficient capital buffers, the NBT \n\n \n\n18 ADB.  2016.

However, their financial standing \ndid not improve. Resolution of insolvent banks has been part of  the  reform discussions between the IMF and the \ngovernment,  and  stymied  by  negative  overall  public  perception  of  banks,  concern  over  potential  fiscal  impact, \nmonetary  policy  implications,  and  moral  hazard.  Bank  resolution  and  sector  reform  require  solid  government \ncommitment to deal with insolvencies, reduce NPLs, and mitigate residual implications of directed or related-party \nlending.  These  issues  highlight  the  need  for  development  partners  to  coordinate  closely  and  build  consensus  in \nproviding quality assistance and coherent advice to the government. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nadopted a plan to better align regulatory capital requirements with Basel II.21 To better mitigate \ncredit exposures, the NBT developed a comprehensive template for banks to accurately report \nlending exposure, and expanded financial reporting requirements by incorporating data needed \nunder the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9. These reforms will continue with \nfollow-up policy actions proposed for subprogram 2, including (i) improving the institutional setup \nand corporate governance of IDIF; (ii) adopting a formal backup funding arrangement and a new \nframework  to  increase  the  scope  and  level  of  deposit  insurance  coverage;  (iii)  including  all \ndeposit-taking  institutions  in  the  insurance  scheme  and  adopting  risk-based  premiums;  (iv) \nimproving financial stability reporting; (v) expanding the NBT\u2019s macroprudential policy tools and \ninstruments;  (vi)  implementing  steps  to  adopt  Basel  II;  (vii)  expanding  collection  of  sex-\ndisaggregated financial data; and (viii) adopting policies to mitigate and limit the credit exposure \nin banks, including lending to SOEs. \n\n13. \nReform area 2: Enabling environment for  financial sector development improved. \nThe  program  will  improve  the  development  of  financial  sector,  including  Islamic  banking  and \ninsurance;  increase  competition;  and  expand  gender  inclusiveness.  The  last  financial  sector \nstrategy  for  Tajikistan  covered  2010\u20132015.  The  lack of  a successor  strategy has hindered  the \ngovernment\u2019s  ability  to  identify,  prioritize,  and  sequence  critical  reforms.  The  government  will \nprepare a comprehensive financial sector development strategy. The government has formed a \nworking group (30% women), including delegates from MOF,  the NBT, and IDIF, to prepare a \nmedium-term  financial  sector  development  strategy  and  road  map.  It  includes  trackable  target \nindicators for improving access of women to finance, promotes fintech development and mobile \nfinancial  services,  and  plans  to  strengthen  financial  consumer  protection. 22  To  expand  the \nsecurities  market,  MOF  improved  the  process  of  issuing  and  circulating  state  securities  and \napproved  an  action  plan  for  modernizing  the  state  securities  auction  process.  It  includes  the \nauction of securities at tenors longer than 91 days at market rates under a pilot test. To remove \nbarriers to financial sector development and to improve supervision and clarification of the legal \nand regulatory framework, the government (i) adopted a resolution defining minimum statutory \ncapital  for  insurance  and  reinsurance  companies;  and  (ii)  issued  regulations  governing  the \nactivities  of  Islamic  credit  institutions,  including  minimum  capital  and  other  prudential \nrequirements. These reforms will continue with follow-up policy actions proposed for subprogram \n2, including (i) adoption of a medium-term financial sector strategy and road map incorporating \ngender  aspects,  (ii)  auctioning  of  government  securities  under  a  pilot  program  at  market-\ndetermined interest rates, (iii) development of an insurance industry medium-term strategy and \nroad  map,  (iv)  amendment  of  the  law  on  insurance  to  improve  insurance  supervision,  and  (v) \namendment of the law on Islamic banking to remove impediments to Islamic finance development. \n\n14. \nReform  area  3:  Fiscal  management  strengthened.  The  program  will  improve \ntransparency  and  accountability  of  the  PFM  system  to  help  ensure  that  public  resources  are \nappropriately allocated to strategic priorities. To improve budget transparency and ensure  that \nbudgets reflect the government's social and economic priorities, MOF (i) updated guidelines to \nensure transparency and public access to budget information and the semiannual state budget \nreview;  and  (ii)  approved  an  analysis  for  the  effective  rollout  of  the  medium-term  expenditure \nframework  (MTEF),  incorporating  gender-responsive  budgeting  and  analysis  and  ensuring \nconsistency with sector plans and an improved analysis of capital investment expenditure. MOF \nupgraded  public  sector  accounting  by  adopting  a  road  map  for  implementing  public  sector \n\n \n\n21 Basel II is a set of international banking regulations put forth by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which \nleveled the international regulation field with uniform rules and guidelines. Basel II expanded the rules for minimum \ncapital requirements established under Basel I, the first international regulatory accord, and provided the framework \nfor regulatory review and set disclosure requirements for assessment of banks\u2019 capital adequacy. \n\n22 Fintech is application of new technology to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services. \n\n\ffinancial reporting standards in 2020\u20132025, and the phased introduction of International Public \nSector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). To strengthen oversight and accountability of SOEs, the \ngovernment adopted (i) updated financial reporting requirements for large SOEs in accordance \nwith  IFRS,  (ii)  a  new  regulation  creating  a  supervisory  board  to  oversee  overall  financial \nperformance of SOEs, and (iii) guidelines for assessing fiscal risks. A new tax code was submitted \nto the High-Level Working Group, which provides for proper tax treatment of insurance activities \nand Islamic finance. The government adopted a decree to improve the procedure and monitoring \nmechanism of tax and customs benefits. These reforms will continue with follow-up policy actions \nproposed for subprogram 2, including (i) adopting a 3-year rolling MTEF, (ii) reconciling the MTEF \nwith  the  strategic  plans  of  pilot  sectors  that  incorporate  gender-responsive  budgeting  and \nimproved analysis of investment expenditure for robust PIM practices, (iii) approving a manual on \ncompliance  of  public  financial  statements  with  IPSAS,  (iv)  implementing  consolidated  financial \nstatements  for  large  SOEs  in  accordance  with  IFRS,  and  (v)  submitting  a  new  tax  code  to \nParliament. \n\n15. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition.  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  policy  engagement  and  capacity \ndevelopment in financial sector and fiscal management, and long-standing relationship with the \ngovernment have been important to identify and implement critical reforms. Strong value addition \nis demonstrated by (i) identifying broad binding constraints and possible legal and institutional \nsolutions in accord with international best practices; (ii) conducting detailed policy dialogue and \nin  designing  and \ngenerating  diagnostic  studies;  (iii)  having \nimplementing TA and policy-based lending supporting reforms that increase private investment, \neconomic  diversification,  and  inclusive  growth;  and  (iv)  closely  coordinating  with  other \ndevelopment partners to avoid duplication and ensure consistency of key policy messages.23 \n\nlong-standing  experience \n\n16.  Macroeconomic management and debt sustainability. Tajikistan managed to maintain \ngeneral  macroeconomic  stability  and  growth  through  the  second  quarter  of  2020  despite \nsignificant shocks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. GDP growth, however, slowed from 7.5% \nin  the  first  half  of  2019  to  3.5%  in  the  same  period  of  2020,  reflecting  the pandemic\u2019s  impact: \ndeclining  remittances,  external  trade,  and  foreign  direct  investment.  On  5  June  2020,  the \nPresident of Tajikistan signed a decree to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic.24 The \ngovernment\u2019s  countercyclical  assistance  equaled  4.5%  of  GDP,  nearly  half  of  it  earmarked  to \nsupport  firms.  Further  impact  on  the  economy  is  expected,  with  constraints  on  private \nconsumption, continuing decline in remittances, and slow progress of large infrastructure projects; \neconomic growth is forecast to decline to 1.0% for all of 2020. The fiscal deficit is expected to \nincrease to 6.0% in 2020 because of loss in revenues and the  cost of the pandemic response \nprograms.  The  IMF\u2019s  Debt  Sustainability  Analysis  indicates  that  overall  risk  of  debt  distress \nremains high.25 Total public debt is expected to rise above 50% of GDP in 2020. However, the \nIMF assessed that, based on the government\u2019s commitment to fiscal consolidation, debt  levels \nwill  stabilize  over  the  medium  term,  becoming  sustainable.  As  the  country  has  been  facing \nrevenue shortfalls since March 2020, and with the current external debt\u2013GDP ratio close to the \nlegal  ceiling  of  40%,  the  proposed  ADB  grant  will  create  fiscal  space  and  help  improve  debt \nsustainability.  To  achieve  fiscal  and  external  debt  consolidation  and  ensure  macroeconomic \nstability, the government approved PFMRS 2030 in January 2020 and committed to undertake \nreprioritizing  public  spending,  avoiding \nmedium-term \n\nfiscal  consolidation, \n\nincluding \n\n \n\n23 ADB.  2019.

ADB  has  closely  coordinated  with  development \npartners, and they have indicated broad support for the scope and coverage of the program.26 \nUnder the program, the government supported a standby lending facility between IDIF and MOF, \nwhich  is  consistent  with  the  IMF\u2019s  program  conditionality.  The  IMF  has  not  had  a  program  in \nTajikistan since 2012. Authorities have been negotiating with the IMF on a new program since \n2015, but when it will be in place is not yet known. Facilitation of capital market development is in \nline  with  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development\u2019s  TA  project  with  MOF. \nStrengthening  the  macroprudential  framework  and  overall  banking  supervision,  that  includes \nintroducing  remote  authentication  of  clients  for  low-risk  digital  banking  transactions,  matches \nWorld Bank and International Finance Corporation support for financial sector. ADB discussed \nthe reform proposals with the World Bank and the IMF and received positive support. ADB holds \nregular follow-up discussions on financial sector with the IMF. ADB closely coordinated with the \nIMF  to  assess  the  fiscal  outlook  and  risks  and  the  monitoring  of  public  debt.  Program  policy \nactions  are  consistent  with \nIV  Consultation  assessment  and \nIMF\u2019s  2019  Article \nrecommendations  for  Tajikistan.27 The  IMF  has  been  providing  guidance  to  Tajikistan,  under \nwhich the government and the NBT are expected to raise public confidence in the banking system, \nimprove banking sector regulatory and supervisory frameworks, and boost governance of SOEs. \n\nthe \n\nC. \n\nImpacts of the Reforms \n\n18. \nThe country\u2019s overarching development objective is increased private sector confidence \nin and strengthening of the financial sector, which will help increase private investment (footnote \n7).28 Raising banking sector stability will increase public confidence in financial sector, developing \nfinancial  sector  will  boost  access  to  it,  and  improving  fiscal  management  will  accelerate \nsustainable private sector growth. The effect of raising overall public confidence in financial sector \nfiscal \nand  strengthening \nmanagement, will help increase private investment. \n\nframework,  combined  with \n\nits  development \n\nimprovements \n\nin \n\nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\nDevelopment financing needs.

For subprogram 1, the government has requested \na grant not exceeding $50.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development \nFund) to help finance the program and to cover the government\u2019s urgent financing needs in 2020, \nwhich equals to $735 million. The indicative amount for subprogram 2 is not exceeding $40 million \nin 2022 to help finance policy and institutional reforms under subprogram 2. More financing is \nprovided in subprogram 1 to leverage upfront political support for the implementation of critical \nreforms  and  improved  coordination  and  collaboration  across  implementing  agencies.

Key recommendations include (i) resolution of the two insolvent banks \nand  payout  to  insured  depositors,  (ii)  strong  sector  oversight  with  implementation  of  an  improved  supervisory \nframework, and (iii) greater oversight and transparency of SOEs. The  program tackles  reforms highlighted in the \nIMF\u2019s recommendations, including (i) supporting IDIF to fund payouts to depositors in the event of insolvency of an \ninsured financial institution, (ii) improving the ability of the NBT to monitor and manage financial stability and banking \nsoundness, and (iii) updating financial reporting requirements for SOEs in accordance with IFRS. \n\n28 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fsecurities  market  and  low  demand  for  government  treasury  bills.  External  funding  needs  are \nexpected  to  be  sourced  largely  from  concessional  loans  and  grants  provided  by  international \nfinance institutions. Authorities are considering access to nontraditional donors to supplement its \nfinancing needs. The IMF approved a rapid credit facility of $189.5 million on 6 May 2020.29 ADB\u2019s \nCOVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program grant, approved on 18 June 2020, \nfinanced  $50  million.30 The  Eurasian  Fund  for  Stabilization  and  Development  approved  a  $50 \nmillion  concessional  budget  support  loan  on  4  August  2020.31 An  ADB  grant  of  $20  million  is \nprogrammed for 2020 from the Power Sector Development Program.32 The government expects \nother sources of concessional external financing to meet remaining development financing needs.  \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n20.  MOF is the executing agency for the program. The NBT, MOF, IDIF, and Tax Committee \nare the implementing agencies. The program implementation period is August 2019\u2013September \n2022,  with  subprogram  1  already  implemented  from  August  2019  to  September  2020. \nSubprogram  2  is  expected  to  be  implemented  from  October  2020  to  September  2022.  The \nproceeds  of  the  policy-based  grant  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).33 \n\nA. \n\nGovernance \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n21. \nADB completed a governance risk assessment in 2020 according to the implementation \nguidelines of ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.34 The assessment found \nthat basic legislative, regulatory, and institutional frameworks are in place for all three governance \nareas. While PFM has seen several important recent changes and improvements, anticorruption \nactivities are largely ineffective at a high level due to weak enforcement, primarily because of the \nsignificant  governance  problems  facing  the  government.  The  2018  worldwide  governance \nindicators  for  Tajikistan  are  below  regional  averages.  The  key  concerns  include  (i)  voice  and \naccountability, (ii) political stability, (iii) government effectiveness, (iv) regulatory quality, (v) rule \nof  law,  and  (vi)  control  of  corruption.  The  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability \nassessment for 2017 showed that some improvements had been made since 2012, mainly in (i) \ncomprehensiveness  and  transparency  of  budget  information,  (ii)  predictability  and  control  in \nbudget execution, (iii) accounting and reporting, and (iv) external scrutiny and audit. However, \nseveral  PFM  concerns  remain:  (i)  gaps  between  the  budgeted  and  actual  expenditures  for \nindividual budget entities, (ii) a lack of public access to fiscal information, (iii) weak investment \nproject  selection,  and  (iv)  deficient  medium-term  expenditure  estimates.  The  government  has \nbeen  implementing  reforms  to  improve  governance,  including  measures  to  increase  public \nspending  efficiency,  ensure  better  governance  of  SOEs,  and  raise  corporate  governance \nstandards for financial sector. \n\n \n\n29 The terms of the IMF loan are a 10-year tenor, 5-year grace period, and 0% interest. \n30 ADB.  2020.

The national poverty rate is high at 27.4% (12.0% of this \nfigure reflects the population that is defined as extremely poor). A further 46% of the population, \nalthough living above the national poverty line, are classified as vulnerable and at risk of falling \ninto  poverty.35 According  to  the 2016  Tajikistan  Labor  Force  Survey,  about  29.4% of  the  labor \nforce  was  informally  employed;  a  high  youth  unemployment  rate  of  21.0%  was  particularly \nproblematic.36 About 73% of the population are based in rural areas, where agriculture absorbs \n58% of the workforce, many of whom have low incomes and comprise vulnerable groups close to \nthe  poverty  line.  Through  a  standby  lending  facility  for  IDIF,  about  37,000  depositors  in  two \ninsolvent banks, who cannot access their insured deposit accounts will be paid off. With a more \nstable banking sector, poor and vulnerable households in remote areas will have better access to \naffordable  finance.  Tax  code  amendments  that  reduce  the  tax  burden  and  streamline \nadministration will give poor and vulnerable households greater business opportunities, which will \nexpand the tax base, improving fiscal space. Amendments will improve targeting of public social \nservices and investment in infrastructure. Better-targeted public investment will crowd in private \ninvestment,  which  will  accelerate  industrialization,  increase  labor  productivity,  and  boost \ndisposable income. \n\nC. \n\nGender \n\n23. \nThe program is categorized as having some gender elements and integrates actions to \nensure that women can equitably benefit from the program\u2019s outputs. The labor force participation \nrate of females (48%) was much lower than that of males (78%) in 2018. According to the Labor \nForce  Survey,  the  most  common  occupations  filled  by  females  are  unskilled  work  such  as \ncleaners and servants in institutions, hotels, and other places. In 2014, women represented 21.3% \nof individual entrepreneurs operating on the basis of a patent and 38.0% operating on the basis \nof a certificate.37 Women have impaired access to the financial system, especially in rural areas. \nThe main obstacles are the lack of products and services that meet women\u2019s unique needs and \nrequirements, low financial literacy, and social and cultural barriers.  The program ensures that \ngender  aspects,  including  ease  of  access  to  finance  by  women,  will  be  incorporated  into  a \nmedium-term finance strategy. MOF will adopt gender-responsive budgeting and analysis in the \nMTEF to better consider the needs of women through public services and investments. \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n24. \nFollowing  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  program  is  in  category  C  for \nenvironment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  Program  activities  will  be \nconfined  to  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  No  activity  will  result  in  or  lead  to  involuntary \nresettlement or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n35 Poverty figures are sourced from Tajikistan Statistics Agency. 2018.
