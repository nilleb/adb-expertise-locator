The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has \nsupported  the  development  of  the  financial  sector  through  loans \nand  TA.  The  first  phase  of  comprehensive  financial  reforms  was \nlaunched in 1996 against the backdrop of a fragile banking sector \nwith a number of illiquid and insolvent banks. Supported by ADB\u2019s \nFinancial  Sector  Program  Loan  (FSPL  I),  these  reforms  focused \nprimarily  on  bank  restructuring  and  resolution,  strengthening \nprudential  regulations  and  supervision,  and,  more  generally, \ndeveloping  a  market-oriented  banking  sector.  The  Second \nFinancial Sector Program Loan (FSPL II) supported the upgrading \nof  management \nthe \nintroduction  of  the  interbank  market,  and  the  development  of  a \nbasic  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  the  nonbank  financial \n(NBF) sector. \n \n\ninformation  system \n\nin  banks, \n\n(MIS) \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAs  a  result  of  these  reforms,  the  financial  sector  has  stabilized \nand  strengthened  since \nthe  1990s\u2019  banking  crises.  Key \nachievements  include  restructuring  and  privatization  of  state-\nowned  banks,  interest  rate  liberalization,  development  of  an \ninterbank market, and strengthening of the banking legislation and \nregulations. At the same time, the basic infrastructure to develop \nthe  NBF  sector\u2014including \nthe  securities  market,  nonbank \nfinancial  institutions  (NBFIs),  insurance  companies,  and  savings \nand credit cooperatives (SCCs)\u2014has been put in place.  \n \nDeveloping  a  well-functioning  and  broad-based  financial  system, \nhowever, is a gradual process, especially in transition economies \nwith limited market-based institutions and human resources. While \nbank  deposits  and  loans  have  increased  significantly  in  recent \nyears,  interest  rates  remain  high  and  deposits  and  loans  are \nmostly  short  term.  The  lack  of  an  effective  collateral  framework, \nincluding  weaknesses  in  debt  enforcement  and  the  high  cost  of \ncollateral  registration,  increases  the  cost  of  borrowing.  Weak \ncorporate  governance  in  banks  and  the  lack  of  an  effective  anti-\nmoney-laundering (AML) system undermine depositor protection.  \n \nThe NBF sector\u2019s development has been hampered by legal and \nregulatory  weaknesses,  inefficient  regulatory  structure,  policy \ndistortions, and low investor confidence. While SCCs have grown \nrapidly in recent years, many are believed to be engaged in risky \nand unsustainable activities. Financial services provided by NBFIs \nare  largely  limited  to  short-term  consumer  loans.  The  range  of \ninsurance products is narrow and the payout ratio (claims paid as \na percentage of total premiums) is low. Progress in developing the \ncapital market has been limited.  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  Action  Plan  for  2004\u20132008  highlights  the \nfinancial sector\u2019s role in ensuring a growth rate of about 6% over \nthe medium term. The plan therefore emphasizes the importance \nof  continued  reforms  to  develop  a  stable  and  broad-based \nfinancial sector. Specifically, it sets out to (i) consolidate financial \nsector stabilization, (ii) strengthen the stock exchange to mobilize \nsavings  for  productive  investments,  and  (iii)  develop  a  broader \nrange of financial services and instruments. \n \nThe  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  for  Mongolia  identifies \nthe underdevelopment of the financial sector and limited access of \nhouseholds  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  to \nfinancial  services  as  key  impediments  to  private  sector-led \neconomic growth and poverty reduction. A sound financial system \nwith  improved  efficiency  and  outreach  is  a  key  medium-term \noutcome envisioned in the CSP.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \nObjectives \n\n \n\niii\n\nBuilding  on  the  progress  achieved  under  the  FSPL  I  and  II,  the \nFRGP  aims  to  help  develop  a  sound  and  broad-based  financial \nsector, through a holistic approach to address the remaining legal \nand regulatory, institutional, and policy constraints. A broad-based \nfinancial  system  comprising  banks,  NBFIs,  SCCs,  securities \nmarkets,  and  the  insurance  sector  reduces  the  risks  associated \nwith  over-reliance  on  the  banking  system,  and  increases  the \nsupply  of  long-term  capital  for  productive  investment.  It  will,  in \nturn, promote growth and create jobs. Increased competition from \nalternative  sources  of \nintermediation  will  enhance \nefficiency, and the financial system as a whole will become more \nresilient to exogenous shocks. \n \n\nfinancial \n\nThe  reforms  proposed  under  the  FRGP  are  fully  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  priorities  and  medium-term  objectives.  Program \ndesign  has  benefited  from  the  lessons  learned  from  the  FSPL  I \nand  II,  and  Mongolia\u2019s  recent  strong  economic  performance  is \nconducive to the implementation of the proposed reforms. \n \nThe  FRGP\u2019s  objective  is  to  help  develop  a  sound  and  broad-\nbased  financial  sector  that  effectively  channels  resources  to \nproductive investment projects. Specifically, the FRGP will seek to \n(i)  reduce  the  cost  of  borrowing  and  expand  access  to  credit  by \nimproving  the  collateral  framework,  (ii)  improve  governance  in \nbanks  to  protect  depositors,  (iii)  enhance  the  role  of  the  NBF \nsector  in  mobilizing  savings  for  investment  capital,  and  (iv) \nimprove  investor  confidence  by  reducing  the  risks  from  money \nlaundering  through  the  financial  system.  The  FRGP  is  designed \nas  a  continuation  of  the  FSPL  II,  and  will  build  on  the  progress \nachieved under the FSPL I and II.  \n \nThe FRGP\u2019s banking sector reforms will aim to reduce the cost of \nborrowing  and  expand  access  to  credit  by  facilitating  debt \nrecovery  by  banks  and  by  lowering  the  cost  of  collateral \nregistration.  This  component  will  introduce  legal  and  regulatory \nchanges  to  strengthen  corporate  governance  in  banks  and  to \nimprove the supervision of groups and conglomerates that control \nfinancial  institutions.  The  NBF  reforms  will  seek  to  enhance  the \nsector\u2019s role in mobilizing and allocating resources by developing \nthe  legal  and  regulatory  framework;  strengthening  regulatory \ncapacity by establishing a single regulator for the NBF sector\u2014the \nNonbank  Financial  Regulatory  Commission \n(NBFRC);  and \nstrengthening corporate governance and investor protection. This \ncomponent will also aim to reduce the distortionary impact of tax \npolicies  on  the  financial sector.  The AML  component  will seek  to \nmitigate the risks from money laundering by developing the legal \nand  regulatory \nfinancial \nintelligence unit (FIU) in the Bank of Mongolia (BOM).  \n \n\nframework,  and  by  establishing  a \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \nProgram Period and \nTranching \n\n \nExecuting and \nImplementing Agencies \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nRisks and Safeguards \n\ntranches.  The \n\nfirst,  SDR3,458,500 \n\nIt is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s policy reforms \nunder the FRGP by providing a loan of SDR6,917,000 ($10 million \nequivalent). The Borrower will be Mongolia. The loan will be from \nthe ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will have a term of \n24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  an  interest \ncharge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nyear for the remaining period. The loan proceeds are expected to \nbe used over 48 months from the date of effectiveness. \n \nThe  program  period  will  be  4  years.  The  loan  will  be  released  in \ntwo  equal \n($5  million \nequivalent), will be released upon loan effectiveness. The second, \nSDR3,458,500 ($5 million equivalent), will be released 24 months \nafter  Board  approval,  subject  to  the  Government  meeting  the \nconditions specified for its release. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for \nthe  loan.  BOM  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  the  banking \nsector  and  AML  components.  NBFRC  will  be  the  Implementing \nAgency for the NBF sector component.  \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange \ncost  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries \n(other  than  the  items  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items  and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources).  The \nGovernment will certify that the volume of eligible imports exceeds \nthe  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected  disbursement  under  the  loan  for \nthe  period.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan \nthe  Government\u2019s \nproceeds  and  verify \ncertification. \n \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  local  currency  funds \ngenerated  by  the  program  loan  will  be  used,  first,  to  support  the \nadjustment  cost  of  reforms  under  the  FRGP,  and  second,  to \nfinance  expenditures \nfor  general  development  purposes  of \nMongolia. \n \nPoor  management  of  the  transition  to  NBFRC  is  a  key  risk.  A \nnumber  of  measures  have  been  taken  to  facilitate  a  timely  and \norderly  transition.  An  overall  strategy  and  a  detailed  time-bound \naction  plan  have  been  prepared  in  close  consultation  with  the \nGovernment  and  other  key  stakeholders.  During  program \npreparation,  considerable  efforts  were  made  to  reach  a  common \nunderstanding  and  consensus  among  different  government \nagencies  on  the  objectives  and  structure  of  NBFRC.  BOM  has \ncommitted  to  transfer  at  least  eight  qualified  staff  members  to \nNBFRC,  and  the  Government  has  agreed  to  allocate  budget  to \nensure an adequate pool of qualified professional staff to conduct \nregulatory, supervisory, and enforcement functions. The attached \nTA  will  provide  policy  and  technical  guidance  and  training  for  a \nsmooth transition. \n \n\nthe  accuracy  of \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n\nAnother  risk  is  that  the  introduction  of  new  legislation  and  legal \namendments will be delayed significantly and/or will not fully meet \nthe  program  objectives.  Inconsistencies  among  different  laws \ncould create confusion and loopholes. This risk is minimized to the \nextent that many of the laws to be enacted during the FRGP were \ndrafted  during  program  preparation  or  under  other  ADB  projects. \nIn line with the recommendation of the program completion report \nfor  the  FSPL  II,  stakeholder  consultations  were  held  during \nprogram preparation to ensure that the expected outcomes of the \nlegal  reforms  are  fully  understood.  A  number  of  crucial  laws, \nincluding  those  related  to  the  collateral  framework,  tax  reforms, \nand  the  establishment  of  NBFRC,  have  either  been  enacted  or \nsubmitted  to  Parliament.  The  attached  TA  will  support  the  legal \nreforms  and  ensure  that  any  revisions  made  by  the  Government \ndo not undermine the laws\u2019 effectiveness. \n \nResistance from  vested  interests  to  certain  reforms  is  a  potential \nrisk, and is particularly relevant to the AML and tax reforms. The \nGovernment  has  expressed  strong  commitment  to  implementing \nAML  reforms,  and  has  prepared  a  draft  AML  law.  Submission  of \nthe  law  to  Parliament  is  a  condition  for  loan  effectiveness.  An \nongoing  TA  is  helping  develop  implementing  regulations  and  a \nblueprint  for  information  technology  and  reporting  requirements, \nand  is  providing  related  training  to  government  agencies  and \nfinancial institutions. This will help facilitate the implementation of \nthe  FRGP\u2019s  AML  component.  With  assistance \nthe \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the United States Agency \nfor  International  Development  (USAID),  the  Government  has \nprepared a reform proposal to improve the efficiency of the overall \ntax system. The Corporate Income Tax Law recently submitted to \nParliament  incorporates  measures  to  reduce  tax  impediments  to \nNBF  development.  ADB,  IMF,  and  USAID  should  continue  to \ncoordinate  with  each  other  to  ensure  satisfactory  implementation \nof these tax reforms. \n \n\nfrom \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n \n \n \n\nforeclosure  of  collateral; \n\nintermediaries,  and  securities \n\nThe TA\u2019s purpose is to support the FRGP\u2019s policy reforms, and to \nstrengthen the capacities of NBFRC and the FIU. Specifically, the \nTA will help the Government (i) implement the procedures for non-\njudicial \n(ii)  establish  NBFRC  by \ndeveloping  transition  arrangements,  organizational  structure,  and \ninternal procedures; (iii) draft laws and regulations to address the \nweaknesses  and  gaps  in  the  legal  framework;  (iv)  introduce \ncorporate  governance  structure  and  practices  in  banks,  nonbank \nissuers;  (v)  develop \nfinancial \ninformation  technology-management  information  system  (IT-MIS) \nin NBFRC and the FIU; and (vi) provide capacity-building training \nin financial regulation; on-site and off-site supervision; accounting, \nauditing, and reporting standards; and IT-MIS. The total TA cost is \nestimated at $1,120,000, of which ADB will finance $900,000 on a \ngrant  basis  through  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment  of  Japan.  MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and \nBOM and NBFRC will be the implementing agencies. The TA will \nrequire  a  total  of  63  person-months\u2019  consulting  services  (23 \nperson-months\u2019  international  and  40  person-months\u2019  national). \nThe  consultants  will  be

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  Mongolia  for  the  Financial  Regulation  and  Governance  Program  (FRGP).  The  report  also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  for  Financial  Sector \nReforms, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n\n2. \nFollowing  a  sharp  decline  in  output  during  the  early  transition  period,  the  economy \nreturned to a positive growth rate in 1994, and grew by 3.9% annually from 1994 to 1999. The \nrelatively quick economic recovery reflected favorable international copper and cashmere prices \nand the efficiency gains from market-oriented reforms. Demonstrating the country\u2019s vulnerability \nto exogenous shocks, the annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate dropped to 1% in \n2001 as international copper prices fell and consecutive harsh winters and an outbreak of foot \nand  mouth  disease  led  to  sharp  decline  in  agricultural  output.  Boosted  by  strong  growth  in \nagriculture and mining\u2014which jointly account for 30% of GDP\u2014the annual growth rate climbed \nfrom 1.0% in 2001 to 10.6% in 2004. After many years of moderation, inflation surged in the first \nhalf of 2005, and reached 17.5% in June 2005, reflecting large increases in oil and meat prices. \nWhile  it  declined  as  the  impact  of  the  food  price  shock  was  undone,  inflation  remains  high  at \n11.5%. \n \n \nSupported  by  favorable  terms  of  trade,  better-than-expected  gold  volume,  and  capital \n3. \ninflows reflecting the recovery in tourism and increasing remittances, the current account shifted \nto  a  small  surplus  in  2004,  from  a  deficit  of  7.8%  in  2003.  The  budget  deficit  narrowed  from \n7.7%  of  GDP  in  2000  to  2%  in  2004,  reflecting  strong  growth  and  a  boom  in  minerals. \nMongolia\u2019s  reform  process  has  been  underpinned  by  development  aid,  and  the  debt  level \nstands  at  about  91%  of  GDP.  Since  most  of  the  debt  consists  of  loans  from  multilateral  or \nbilateral sources on concessional terms, however, the debt level is deemed manageable.  \n \nThe  benefits  of  economic  growth  are  not  evenly  distributed,  as  indicated  by  income \n4. \ninequality and persistent poverty; 36% of Mongolians live under the national poverty line. High \nunemployment (14.2%) and underemployment caused by a mismatch of skills stand as the main \ncauses  of  poverty.  Services  are  the  main  source  of  employment,  followed  by  agriculture  and \nindustry. \n \n5. \nThe boom in mining investment is expected to continue, given the strong prospects for \nnew  exploration  in  the  Gobi  desert  and  strong  demand  from  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China. \nGrowth is expected to settle at about 5% over the next 2 or 3 years, and with the appropriate \nmonetary  policy,  inflation  is  forecast  to  slow  down  to  about  5%  in  2006.  However,  sustained \ngrowth  faces  a  number  of  constraints.  The  narrow  economic  base  and  high  dependence  on \ncommodity  production  and  trade  make  the  country  vulnerable  to  exogenous  shocks. \nFragmented  domestic  markets  and  geographic  isolation  hinder  growth.  Manufacturing  sector \ngrowth is constrained by the prevalent use of old technology and limited human resources.  \n \n \n \n\n\f2             \n\n \n\nThe  country  strategy  and  program \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  Action  Plan  for  2004\u20132008  highlights  the  importance  of  continued \n6. \nfinancial  sector  reforms  in  ensuring  a  growth  rate  of  about  6%  over  the  medium  term.1  \nAccordingly, the plan sets out to (i) consolidate financial sector stabilization, (ii) strengthen the \nstock  exchange  to  mobilize  savings  for  productive  investments,  and  (iii)  develop  a  broader \nrange of financial services and instruments.  \n \n7. \nfinancial \nunderdevelopment  as  a  main  constraint  on  private  sector-led  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction. The banking sector has stabilized and strengthened since the 1990s\u2019 crises, and the \nGovernment  has  started  to  build  the  basic  foundation  for  the  nonbank  financial  (NBF)  sector. \nHowever, the financial sector\u2019s role in promoting economic growth has been limited. The cost of \nborrowing  is  high  and  financial  outreach  limited.  The  lack  of  long-term  funding  sources  limits \nproductive  investment.  There  are  few  savings  instruments  and  insurance  products.  A  sound \nfinancial  system  with  improved  efficiency  and  outreach  is  a  key  medium-term  outcome \nenvisioned in the CSP. \n \n \n\nfor  Mongolia \n\nidentifies \n\n(CSP)2 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES  \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance3  \n\n8. \nThe financial sector comprises the banking sector, and the NBF sector, which includes \nnonbank  financial  institutions  (NBFIs),  savings  and  credit  cooperatives  (SCCs),  securities \nmarkets and intermediaries, and insurance companies. The banking sector has grown rapidly in \nrecent years, and bank deposits and assets as percentage of GDP are the highest in the region \n(Table 1). However, at 11.2%, the interest rate spread is high, and nonperforming loans (NPLs) \nhave increased since 2001. While the NBF sector has grown in recent years, it is significantly \nsmaller  than  the  banking  sector,  and  does  not  yet  play  a  meaningful  role  in  financial \nintermediation. The excessive reliance on the banking sector makes the economy vulnerable to \nshocks. \n \n\nTable 1: Summary Statistics for Selected Transition Economiesa\n\nNo. of \nBanks\n\nInterest \nspreadb\n\nCountry\n\nLoans (% of total \nloan)\n\nNo. of Insurance \nCompanies\n\nNo. of Listed \nCompanies\n\nNo. of Credit \nAssociations\n\nBroad \nMoney\n\nBank \nAssets\n\nBank \nDeposits\n\nInsurance \nPremium\n\nEquity Market \nCapitalization\n\nMongolia\n\nArmenia\nAzerbaijan\nKazakhstan\nKyrgyz \nRepublic\n\n17\n\n20\n42\n35\n\n19\n\n11.2\n\n14\n8.9\n9\n\n22.6\n\n11\n\n7.2\n8.2\n13.1\n\n7\n\n23\n\n24\n29\n36\n\n12\n\n395\n\n196\n0c\n69\n\n6\n\n% of GDP\n\n570\n\n-\n28\n52\n\n306\n\n47\n\n15\n18\n21\n\n18\n\n61\n\n19\n18\n49\n\n19\n\n39\n\n6\n12\n30\n\n8.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n0.8\n0.7\n\n0.2\n\nGDP = gross domestic product, No. = number.\na Data are for 2003 or 2004, depending on availability.\nb Difference between average lending rate and average deposit rate.\nc Eighty-five companies are admitted for trading, but none are listed on the stock exchange.\nSources: National Authorities, IMF International Financial Statistics, Financial Sector Stability Assessments, Article IV Consultation Reports, EBRD Transition Report 2004.\n \n\n                                                 \n1 Government of Mongolia. 2004.

With  total \nassets of MNT1.1 trillion or 61% of GDP, the banking system dominates the financial sector. Of \nthe  17  commercial  banks,  1  is  state-owned  (Savings  Bank),  and  4  have  foreign  ownership.4 \nExcept for one Russian bank branch, no foreign banks are licensed to operate in Mongolia. The \nbanking  sector  is  highly  concentrated,  with  the  four  largest  banks  accounting  for  61%  of  total \nbanking  assets,  and  69%  of  deposits.  In  2006,  the  Bank  of  Mongolia  (BOM)  will  increase \nminimum  capital  requirements  of  banks  from  the  current  MNT4  billion  to  MNT8  billion.  This  is \nexpected  to  drive  consolidation  within  the  sector  as  only  three  banks  have  capital  levels \nexceeding MNT8 billion. \n \nDeposits and loans as a share of GDP grew from 14% and 8% in 1999 to 39% and 35% \n10. \nin  2004.  Bank  deposits  and  loans  are  mostly  short-term,  with  maturities  of  less  than  1  year. \nWhile  interest  rates  are  trending  down,  they  remain  high.  The  deposit  and  lending  rates  of \nbanks were about 14% and 25% in 2004. High interest spreads are symptomatic of high credit \nrisk,  high  operating  costs  of  banks,  strong  demand  for  bank  loans  because  of  a  lack  of  other \nfunding sources, and lack of effective competition among banks. \n \n11. \nThe  ratio  of  total  capital  to  assets  of  the  banking  sector  increased  from  below  4%  in \n1998  to  15%  in  2004,  and  the  entire  banking  sector  has  been  profitable  for  the  past  5  years \n(2000\u20132004).  The  NPL  ratio  declined  from  54%  in  1999  to 8%  in  2001  and  then stayed  at  7\u2013\n11%  until  2004.  The  loan  loss  reserves  are  provisioned  in  line  with  the  BOM  guidelines,  and \nstand at a high level. While the rapid increase in bank loans during 2001\u20132003 raised concerns, \ncredit  expansion  slowed  down  in  2004.  Credit  expanded  by  88%  annually  during  2001\u20132003 \nand grew by 44% in 2004. However, the NPL ratio increased from 7% in 2002 to 8% in 2003 \nand  to  11%  in  2004,  reflecting  poor  performance  of  the  loans  recently  extended  and  weak \ninternal control and risk assessment capacities in banks.  \n \n\n2. \n\nNonbank Financial Institutions  \n\n12. \nThe  term  NBFI  refers  to  a  licensee  under  the  Law  on  Nonbank  Financial  Activities \n(2002).  The  activities  covered  under  this  law  include  lending,  factoring,  leasing,  issuing \nguarantees, issuing payment instruments, electronic payments and remittance services, foreign \nexchange services, trust services, investment in short-term financial instruments, and advisory \nservices. Each NBFI is licensed for one or more activities, but there is no overall license to be \nan NBFI. NBFIs are not allowed to take deposits. While most of the smaller NBFIs are financed \nby equity, some large ones have significant loan financing and accrued interests. \n \n13. \nThe  number,  loans,  and  total  assets  of  NBFIs  have  grown  rapidly  since  2000,  when \nMongol Credit was established as the first licensed NBFI. Of the 114 NBFIs registered in 2004, \n9  were  foreign-owned  or  joint  ventures.  Most  NBFIs  provide  small  consumer  loans,  or  short-\nterm loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and a handful are engaged in other \nactivities  such  as  leasing  and  foreign  exchange  trading.  NBFIs  are  incorporated  as  limited \nliability companies, and are typically owned by an individual, a family, or a small group of related \nindividuals.  With  total  assets  of  MNT28.7  billion,  NBFIs  as  a  group  account  for  about  2.6%  of \nbanking sector assets. NBFIs\u2019 NPLs are 4.5% of total loans. \n \n\n                                                 \n4 Chinggis Bank, Khan Bank (previously Agriculture Bank), Trade and Development Bank, and Xac Bank. \n\n \n\n\f4             \n\n \n\n3. \n\nSavings and Credit Cooperatives  \n\n14. \nSCCs  are  established  under  the  Law  on  Cooperatives  to  provide  saving  and  lending \nservices  to  members.  While  SCCs  have  to  register  with  the  General  Department  of  National \nTaxation  (GDNT),  they  are  not  required  to  obtain  a  license  from  a  financial  regulator.  The \nnumber of SCCs has dramatically increased in the last several years. The joint survey by BOM \nand GDNT during the first quarter of 2004 showed that there are 570 registered SCCs, of which \n288  are  believed  to  be  inactive  or  bankrupt,  or  could  not  be  located  by  the  authorities.  SCC \nassets amount to MNT47.1 billion, about 6% of total banking sector assets. SCC activities are \nconcentrated  in  Ulaanbaatar,  which  has  166  SCCs  with  total  assets  of  MNT44.6  billion.  The \nsector  is  highly  concentrated,  with  the  14  largest  SCCs  accounting  for  76.2%  of  total  assets. \nAlthough SCCs are allowed to take deposits only from the members, many SCCs take deposits \nfrom the public. \n \n\n4. \n\nSecurities Market and Intermediaries \n\nThere  are  395  companies  listed  on  the  Mongolian  Stock  Exchange  (MSE).  Market \n15. \ncapitalization  in  2004  was  MNT29.8  billion  (1.4%  of  GDP)  and  annual  trading  value  was \nMNT654  million.  The  trading  value  at  MSE  has  been  declining  since  a  large  part  of  corporate \nshares  have  been  traded  outside  MSE  and  concentrated  in  small  number  of  shareholders.  In \n2004, only 1,300 companies and individuals owned 96% of the shares of all listed companies. \nPrivate  companies  and  financial  institutions  currently  do  not  use  MSE  to  raise  new  equity \ncapital.  Total  trade  value  of  bonds  in  2004  was  MNT15.3  billion,  of  which  81.8%  were \ngovernment bonds and 18.2% corporate bonds. Nearly all the government and corporate bonds \nare bought by banks and held to maturity, and there is virtually no secondary market trading. As \na result of rapid decline in trading activity and the increase in minimum capital requirement (from \nMNT10  million  to  MNT50  million  in  January  2003),  the  number  of  licensed  securities \nbroker/dealer  companies  declined  from  42  in  2000  to  25  in  2004.  Of  the  25  securities \ncompanies,  2  have  foreign  participation.  There  is  no  licensed  underwriter  and  no  collective \ninvestment funds.  \n \n16. \nIn  2003,  MSE  was  divided  into  two  separate  legal  entities:  MSE  and  the  Securities \nClearing House and Central Depository. The separation of trading and listing functions of MSE \nfrom  its  securities  clearing  and  depository  systems  aimed  to  improve  transparency  and \naccountability.  MSE  is  organized  as  a  government-owned  profit-making  joint  stock  company. \nMSE shares were listed on the stock exchange in 2003 but are not traded since MSE is 100% \nGovernment-owned.  MSE  continues  to  operate  as  a  traditional  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE) \nwith six government representatives on the board, including the Mongolian Securities Exchange \nCommission (MSEC), and only one private sector representative from a broker/dealer company. \n \n\n5. \n\nInsurance Industry \n\n17. \nThe number of insurance companies increased from 10 to 23 from 1999 to March 2005. \nFollowing the privatization of the largest insurance company, Mongol Daatgal, in February 2004, \nall  insurance  companies  are  now  privately  owned.  In  2003,  total  insurance  premiums  were \nMNT6.3 billion, about 0.5% of GDP. Aircraft-related insurance (hull and liability) comprises the \nlargest category and accounts for 40% of the industry. The only class of mandatory insurance is \nmotor  vehicle  liability,  accounting  for  8%  of  total  industry  premium.  The  sector  is  highly \nconcentrated,  with  Mongol  Daatgal  accounting  for  74%  of  total  insurance  sector  premiums  in \n2003.  The  recent  bankruptcies  of  two  insurance  companies  have  raised  concerns  about  the \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\nsolvency of the smaller companies. The insurance payout ratio (claims paid as a percentage of \ntotal premiums collected) is low at 20%. \n \nB. \n \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nBanking Sector \n\na. \n\nLack of an Effective Collateral Framework \n\n18. \nThe  absence  of  an  effective  collateral  framework  is  a  key  impediment  to  financial \nintermediation.  The  Second  Financial  Sector  Program  Loan  (FSPL  II)5  supported measures  to \nexpand the types of collateral that banks can accept from immovable to movable property and \nfinancial  assets,  and  to  reduce  the  cost  of  collateral  registration.  Under  the  FSPL  II,  the  Civil \nCode  was  amended  to  allow  banks  to  seize  immovable  property  without  a  court  decision. \nHowever, the 2002 Civil Code includes another article that contradicts the previous one. This is \na  major  setback  for  banks  and  removes  a  strong  incentive  for  borrowers  to  meet  their  debt \nobligations.  The  court  procedures  for  securing  and  enforcing  collateral  are  lengthy  and \ncumbersome.  After  the  court  decision,  the  Court  Decision  Enforcement  Office  (bailiff\u2019s  office) \ntakes  months  and  even  years  from  the  court  decision  to  the  actual  foreclosure,  and  charges \nfees  as  high  as  10%  of  the  property\u2019s  value.  The  information  available  from  the  Property \nRegistration  Office  (PRO)  in  the  Ministry  of  Construction  and  Urban  Development  (MOC)  is \nlimited,  making  it  difficult  for  banks  to  assess  the  creditworthiness  of  potential  borrowers. \nCombined, these factors weaken banks\u2019 leverage in foreclosure and increase credit risk, adding \nsignificantly to the interest premiums charged by banks. The high cost of notarizing documents \nfor  collateral  registration\u2014which  can  be  up  to  MNT40,000\u2014also  increases  the  cost  of \nborrowing.  \n \n\nb. \n\nWeak Governance and Depositor Protection \n\n19.  While  corporate  governance  practices  have  improved  in  recent  years,  they  vary \nconsiderably  across  the  17  commercial  banks.  In  particular,  the  three  banks  that  have  foreign \nmanagement  or  long-term  international  advisors\u2014Agricultural  Bank,  Trade  and  Development \nBank, and Xac Bank\u2014have developed sound corporate governance structures. However, some \nbanks  are  believed  to  engage  in  substantial  related-party  lending  at  below-market  rates  and \nwithout consideration of creditworthiness.  \n \n20.  Weak  Internal  Controls.  Related-party  lending  is  largely  due  to  the  weak  system  of \nchecks and balances. The Banking Law requires that banks\u2019 board of directors be shareholders. \nBy preventing the appointment of independent directors, this requirement impedes the effective \nfunctioning of banks\u2019 governing boards and auditing committees. Most of the banks are closely \nheld limited liability companies with one or two shareholders controlling the majority of shares, \nand  a  representative  of  the  majority  shareholder  chairing  the  governing  board.  The  corporate \ngovernance guidelines issued by BOM in 2002 do not include clearly specified fiduciary duties \nand  safeguards  against  related-party  transactions,  and  functions  of  board  committees. \nAddressing these gaps will help promote transparency and prevent conflict of interest and fraud, \nthereby protecting depositors. \n \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB.  2000.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to \n\nMongolia for the Second Financial Sector Reform Program. Manila (Loan 1743-MON [SF]).  \n\n \n\n\f6             \n\n \n\n21.  Weak  Supervision  of  Financial  Groups  and  Conglomerates.  Mongolian  banks  are \nprohibited from holding nonbank financial intermediaries and other companies as subsidiaries. \nHowever,  banks  may  be  owned  or  controlled  by  one  or  more  financial  or  non-financial  firms. \nThere are few limitations on the activities, including financial ones, of banks\u2019 shareholders and \ntheir affiliates, and financial supervisors have limited information about the groups of enterprises \nthat  hold  banks  and  other  financial  institutions.  As  a  result,  despite  the  strict  limitations  on \nbanks\u2019 business activities and shareholding, the potential risks arising from financial and other \nactivities of banks\u2019 shareholders and their affiliates are not properly monitored and managed by \nBOM. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many banks are funding the activities of their owners \nand  affiliates  of  the  owners.  These  concerns  highlight  the  immediate  need  to  improve \nsupervision of financial groups and conglomerates to protect depositors. \n  \n\n2. \n\nNonbank Financial Sector \n\na. \n\nFragmented Regulatory Structure and Weak Institutional Capacity \n\nNBF regulation is fragmented and weak. Regulatory and supervisory responsibilities are \n22. \ndivided  among  BOM,  which  is  responsible  for  regulating  NBFIs  and  SCCs  in  addition  to \ncommercial  banks;  the  Insurance  Supervisory  Unit  (ISU)  of  the  State  Agency  for  Professional \nInspectors; and MSEC.  \n \n23. \nHaving  several  regulators  is  costly  and  inefficient,  especially  in  a  small  country  like \nMongolia. Of the 50 or so staff members in BOM\u2019s Supervision Department, 10 are in charge of \nNBFI  supervision.  BOM  has  issued  prudential  requirements  for  SCCs,  but  it  has  neither  the \nlegal authority nor the staff resources to supervise SCCs. Therefore, BOM does not have staff \nmembers  responsible  for  monitoring  SCCs\u2019  compliance  with  prudential  regulations.  As  rapidly \ngrowing  deposit-taking  institutions,  SCCs  must  be  adequately  supervised.  MSEC  has  only  20 \nstaff  members.  It  does  not  have  a  specialized  unit  for  enforcement,  which  is  one  of  the  most \nimportant  responsibilities  of  a  securities  regulator.  The  FSPL  II  supported  institutional \nstrengthening  of  MSEC  through  investment  in  computer  information  systems  and  through \ndomestic  and  international  training.  However,  lack  of  resources  to  recruit  specialized  experts \nsuch as a chief accountant and a chief legal and enforcement officer, as would be possible in a \nlarger  financial  regulatory  body,  has  hampered  MSEC\u2019s  ability  to  effectively  regulate  the \nsecurities market. The ISU employs only seven staff members, none with adequate specialized \nexpertise  in  insurance.  Establishing  a  regulatory  structure  that  is  more  efficient  and  cost-\neffective is crucial for enhancing NBF regulation and supervision. \n \n24.  MSE  was  launched  in  February  1992  to  implement  the  Government\u2019s  privatization \nprogram. Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance was instrumental in providing policy and \ntechnical advice, and in financing basic computer equipment early on. However, MSE continues \nto be perceived mainly as a venue for SOE privatization, and further institutional strengthening \nis  needed  to  transform  MSE  into  a  modern  stock  exchange  where  private  companies  and \nfinancial  institutions  can  raise  long-term  capital.  Further  strengthening  of  the  legal  and \nregulatory framework is also crucial for capital market development. \n \n\nb. \n\nGaps and Anomalies in the Legal Framework  \n\n25. \nThe NBF sector is governed mainly by the Law on Nonbank Financial Activities (2002), \nLaw  on  Cooperatives  (1998,  amended  2002),  Law  on  Insurance  (1998),  and  the  Law  on \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\nSecurities  Market  (2002).6  They  vary  considerably  in  their  legal  bases  for  effective  regulation \nand supervision. Under the current framework, the ISU is not authorized to license and regulate \ninsurance  companies:  licensing  and  regulatory  powers  still  reside  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance \n(MOF).  This  arrangement  not  only  undermines  the  ISU\u2019s  role  but  also  significantly  delays \nlicensing.  The  Laws  on  Insurance  and  Law  on  Licensing  and  Supervision  of  Insurance \nIntermediaries,  prepared  with  ADB  support,7  have  strengthened  the  licensing  and  prudential \nrequirements  and  provide  for  a  single  agency  to  license,  regulate,  and  supervise  insurance \nintermediaries. However, the law has not yet entered into force, and implementing regulations \nhave not been finalized and issued. \n \n26. \nThe 2002 amendments to the Law on Cooperatives provide for prudential regulation of \nSCC  by  BOM.  However,  the  law  does  not  provide  adequate  basis  for  effective  regulation  and \nsupervision  of  SCC  activities.  In  particular,  it  does  not  require  that  SCCs  be  licensed  by  a \ndesignated entity, does not confer adequate supervisory powers on BOM, and does not provide \nfor the suspension or revocation of the registration of a cooperative that has breached the law.  \n \nA  fundamental  weakness  of  the  Law  on  Securities  Market  is  that  it  does  not  clearly \n27. \ndistinguish  between  the  provisions  that  apply  to  public  offers,  and  those  to  private  offers  of \nsecurities. The law is not sufficiently clear on whether joint stock companies are required to be \nlisted.  One  consequence  of  this  is  that  companies  that  do  not  meet  the  governance  and \ndisclosure  requirements  continue  to  be  listed  on  MSE.  The  ability  of  a  joint  stock  company  to \nunlist  would  enable  MSEC  to  de-list  a  joint  stock  company  that  no  longer  meets  listing \nrequirements  without  necessarily  requiring  that  the  company  convert  into  a  limited  liability \ncompany.  While the law recognizes the creation and operation of investment funds, it is weak \non the segregation and protection of fund assets and the obligations of the governing persons of \ninvestment funds and funds management companies. \u201cFit and proper\u201d standards for directors of \ngoverning  boards,  senior  managers,  and  major  shareholders  of  securities  issuers  and \nprofessional participants are not required under the law. Moreover, the law does not make it an \noffense  for  an  individual  or  a  legal  entity  to  conduct  the  business  of  a  securities  market \nintermediary without obtaining license from MSEC.8  \n \n28. \nAn  effective  financial  regulatory  regime  must  make  appropriate  use  of  self-regulatory \norganizations  (SROs)  to  exercise  some  direct  oversight  responsibility  over  its  members,  in \naddition  to  the  oversight  by  the  government  regulator.  For  instance,  the  broker/dealer \nassociation could  be  assigned  the  responsibility  of  monitoring  the  activities  of  its  member  and \ntaking disciplinary actions if necessary. The lack of such power under the law prevents MSEC \nfrom authorizing an industry body such as MSE or the Securities Dealer Association to take on \nSRO functions.  \n  \n\nc. \n\nWeak Governance, Disclosure, and Investor Confidence \n\n29. \nThe  weaknesses  in  the  Company  Law  (1999)  have  important  implications  for \ngovernance  and  stakeholder  protection.  It  provides  the  basis  for  regulating  the  formation, \nregistration,  and  governance  of  limited  liability  companies  and  joint  stock  companies.  The \ngovernance  requirements  for  limited  liability  companies  under  this  law  are  minimal.  For \n\n                                                 \n6   The Company Law (1999) is also an important element of the legal framework for financial sector. However, since \n\nit mainly has governance implications, it is discussed in the section on governance and investor protection. \n\n7  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Strengthening Financial Sector Development. Manila (TA 3459-\n\n8 This lack of clarity is a common weakness in Mongolian laws, and contributes to the culture of weak compliance and \n\nMON). \n\nenforcement.  \n\n \n\n\f8             \n\n \n\ninstance, limited liability companies are not required to have a board of directors or to prepare \nannual reports with information on corporate governance practices. The law restricts the number \nof  founders  of  a  closed  or  limited  liability  company  to  50,  but  allows  unlimited  number  of \nshareholders thereafter. Therefore, limited liability companies can admit broad public ownership \nthat may not be protected by the requirements that apply to joint stock companies.  \n \n30. \nTo  promote  internationally  recognized  standards  of  accounting,  the  Government \npromulgated the Accounting Law in 1993 (amended in 2001), requiring business enterprises to \nadopt  international  accounting  standards.  The  law  also  required  the  establishment  of  the \nMongolian  National  Association  of  Certified  Public  Accountants,  which  was  upgraded  to  the \nMongolia  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountants  in  1996.  The  Audit  Law  (1997)  requires  the \nadoption of international standards of auditing. While Mongolia was quick to adopt international \naccounting  standards  by  law,  their  implementation  has  been  slow.  As  a  result,  the  quality  of \nfinancial statements of joint stock companies and limited liability companies remains inadequate \nin  terms  of  disclosure  to  investors,  lenders,  and  other  stakeholders.  Instead,  financial \nstatements are prepared mainly to minimize tax obligations. \n \n31. \nThe range of monetary penalties that may be imposed on individuals and legal entities \nthat violate the relevant laws is evidently not adequate to act as a deterrent. For example, the \npenalty  prescribed  for  violation  of  the  Law  on  Securities  Market  is  MNT20,000\u201340,000  for \nindividuals, and MNT100,000\u2013200,000 for legal entities. A fine of MNT40,000 represents just a \nquarter more than the minimum monthly wage in Mongolia, which stands at about MNT30,000. \nIn contrast, the Law on Nonbank Financial Activities allows for a much higher range of fines: 5\u2013\n20 times the minimum wage for individuals and 20\u201340 times for NBFIs.  \n \n\n \n\nd. \n\nTax Impediments \n\n32. \nDistortions  created  by  the  tax  system  have  also  constrained  the  NBF  sector.  A  key \ndistortion arises from the corporate tax system. Mongolia levies a progressive rate, whereby the \ntax  rate  is  15%  for  companies  with  profits  less  than  MNT100  million  and  30%  for  companies \nwith  higher  profits.  This  has  had  significant  adverse  effects.  First,  it  penalizes  efficient \ncompanies with high profits. Second, the tax system encourages companies to split into smaller \ncompanies to avoid paying the higher rate. Besides not being able to benefit from economies of \nscale,  the  smaller  companies  are  not  able  to  raise  funds  through  the  capital  market.  By \nencouraging  the  creation  of  subsidiaries,  the  corporate  income  tax  system  also  complicates \nmanagement structures, resulting in inefficiency and lack of transparency.  \n\n \n33. \nThe  differential  tax  treatment  on  the  returns  of  different  types  of  financial  assets  is \nanother  distortion.  Interest  on  government  debt  is  tax  exempt.  According  to  the  Corporate \nIncome Tax (CIT) Law and Personal Income Tax (PIT) Law, interest income on bank deposits is \nsubject  to  a  15%  tax  rate.  However,  this  article  will  come  into  effect  only  in  2008.  Therefore, \ninterest on bank deposits is currently tax exempt. However, dividends are subject to a 15% tax \nrate, and capital gains on equity investment to up to 30%, discouraging investment in the equity \nmarket.  In  most  countries,  one  reason  why  founders  of  closely  held  limited  liability  companies \nlist on the stock exchange is to realize a capital gain as share prices increase. Further, reserves \nfor  expected  losses  are  tax  deductible  for  commercial  banks  and  SCCs  but  not  for  other \nfinancial institutions. Harmonizing the taxation of banking and NBF sectors is crucial to develop \na broad-based financial sector.  \n  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\n3. \n\nNeed for an Effective Anti-Money-Laundering Regime \n\n34.  Money  laundering  has  its  origins  in  graft,  corruption,  and  other  criminal  activities.  The \nperceived  risks  from  money  laundering  through  the  financial  system  can  significantly  erode \ndepositor  confidence.9  Mongolia  has  recently  received  large  capital  inflows,  the  sources  of \nwhich  are  not  properly  traced  and  tracked.  The  lack  of  transparency  and  information  leads  to \ngaps  in  the  financial  system  through  which  illegal  funds  could  flow,  which  could,  in  turn, \nundermine financial soundness and stability. Mongolia\u2019s location makes it particularly vulnerable \nto illegal funds being routed through the country to hide their origin and destination.  \n \n35. \nThe development of an effective anti-money-laundering (AML) regime is fundamental to \nstrengthening the financial sector and its governance. Proper controls for money laundering will, \nin turn, reduce the scope for other types of crime such as drug trafficking and corruption. The \nGovernment has taken the initial steps to address the potential risks from money laundering. A \ngovernment  resolution \ninternational \norganizations  in  combating  terrorist  financing  and  money  laundering.    The  Government  has \nprepared  a  draft  AML  law,  which  is  being  finalized  for  submission  to  Parliament.  Adopting  the \nlegal  framework,  however,  is  only  the  first  step.  To  establish  a  fully  effective  AML  system, \nimplementing rules and regulations need to be developed, and the institutional arrangement and \ninformation technology (IT) equipment to report and prosecute money laundering put in place.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\nto  cooperate  with \n\ninstructs  MOF \n\nin  2001 \n\nissued \n\n36. \nDespite  a  difficult  transition  period  marked  by  financial  turbulence  and  economic \ninstability,  the  Government  has  been  committed  to  substantive  financial  reform.  Government \nownership  of  previous  ADB  projects  has  been  strong.  In  2003,  the  Government  finalized  a \nnational  poverty  reduction  strategy  in  the  form  of  the  Economic  Growth  Support  and  Poverty \nReduction Strategy, from which the new Government derived a new law outlining the National \nAction  Plan  for  2004\u20132008.  The  plan  highlights  the  role  of  the  financial  sector  in  ensuring  a \ngrowth  rate  of  about  6%  over  the  medium  term.  The  plan  also  highlights  the  importance  of \ncontinued  reforms  to  develop  a  stable  and  broad-based  financial  sector.  Specifically,  the  plan \nsets  out  to  (i)  consolidate  financial  sector  stabilization;  (ii)  strengthen  the  stock  exchange  to \nmobilize  savings  for  productive  investments;  and  (iii)  develop  a  broader  range  of  financial \nservices and instruments.10 The Government has strongly endorsed the FRGP, which is fully in \nline with its priorities and medium-term objectives.  \n \nD. \n\nADB Operations and Lessons Learned \n\n37. \nFinancial  sector  development  has  been  a  key  focus  of  ADB\u2019s  operations  in  Mongolia. \nThe country operational strategies of 1991 and 1994 expressed general support for the sector, \nrecommending  assistance  in  policy  and  regulatory  reform.  The  2000  strategy  recommended \nthat  ADB  assistance  focus  on  banking  sector  reforms,  followed  by  a  second  phase  (starting \n2003)  of  broadening  assistance  to  establish  the  necessary  financial  infrastructure  beyond  the \nbanking  sector.  The  2000  strategy  also  proposed  credit  lines  for  targeted  on-lending  to  SMEs \nand rural enterprises, and for low-income housing. \n \n\n                                                 \n9  Money  laundering  also  has  a  direct  negative  effect  on  economic  growth  by  diverting  resources  to  less  productive \n\nactivities. \n\n10 Government of Mongolia. 2004.

Ulaanbaatar. \n\n \n\n\f10             \n\n \n\nProvision of TA started as early as 1991, when ADB supported MSE\u2019s establishment to \n38. \nfacilitate  the  Government\u2019s  privatization  program.  Subsequent  TA  has  supported  bank \nrestructuring  and  privatization,  capacity  building  of  BOM,  capacity  building  of  accounting  and \nauditing professionals, development of securities  market law and regulations, establishment of \nMSEC, and drafting of AML law and regulations. \n \n39. \nResponding  to  the  emerging  needs  of  the  financial  sector,  ADB  has  provided  two \nprogram loans to Mongolia. The first phase of comprehensive financial reforms was launched in \n1996  against  the  backdrop  of  a  fragile  banking  sector  with  a  number  of  illiquid  and  insolvent \nbanks. Supported by ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL I),11 these reforms focused \nprimarily on bank restructuring and resolution,12 strengthening prudential regulations and on-site \nand off-site supervision, and more generally encouraging the market orientation of the banking \nsector.  The  TA  loan13  provided  in  conjunction  with  the  FSPL  I  supported  the  upgrading  of  the \ninformation technology-management information system (IT-MIS) in commercial banks, and the \nestablishment  of  the  Bank  Training  Center  (BTC).  However,  initial  improvements  in  the  sector \nwere  short-lived,  in  part  because  of  delays  in  bank  restructuring  and  in  part  because  of  the \nonset of the Asian and Russian financial crises in the second half of the 1990s. The effects of \nthe  Asian  crisis,  in  particular,  resulted  in  a  fall  in  international  prices  of  major  export \ncommodities,  including  copper,  gold,  and  cashmere,  placing  pressure  on  loan  servicing  by \nexporters and further eroding the quality of bank assets.  \n \n40. \nIn 1999, the Government formulated the second phase financial sector reform strategy, \nwhich was implemented with support from the FSPL II14 and the World Bank\u2019s Financial Sector \nAdjustment  Credit  (FSAC).  FSAC  supported  the  restructuring  of  the  Savings  Bank  and \nAgriculture  Bank,  the  strengthening  of  banking  regulations,  and  the  strengthening  of  the \nMongolian  Asset  Recovery  Agency  and \nII \ncomplemented  FSAC  by  developing  guidelines  for  corporate  governance  in  banks,  improving \nthe collateral framework by expanding the types of assets that can be pledged and simplifying \nthe  collateral  registration  process,  supporting  the  implementation  of  IT-MIS  in  commercial \nbanks, and developing an interbank market. The FSPL II also included measures to strengthen \nthe  laws  and  regulations  governing  NBFIs  and  insurance  companies  and  to  promote  capital \nmarket development by strengthening the legislation and capacity building of MSEC. \n \n41. \nAs  a  result  of  these  reforms,  the  financial  sector  has  stabilized  and  strengthened \nconsiderably  since  the  1990s\u2019  banking  crises.  Key  achievements  include  restructuring  and \nprivatization  of  state-owned  banks,  interest  rate  liberalization,  development  of  an  efficient \ninterbank market, and strengthening of the legal and regulatory framework for banks, including \nregulatory capacity of BOM. IT-MIS in commercial banks has improved significantly, and BTC is \nemerging  as  an  increasingly  credible  and  self-sustaining  institution.  The  FSPL  II  was \ninstrumental in laying the groundwork for further NBF sector development. However, developing \na well-functioning and broad-based financial system is a gradual process, especially in transition \ninstitutions  and  human  resources.

Besides  addressing \nweaknesses specific to the subsectors, the FRGP\u2019s reform measures also take into account the \nlinks  and  complementarities  between  the  banking  and  NBF  sectors.  Strong  economic \nperformance  in  recent  years  provides  a  conducive  environment  for  financial  reform.  Using  a \nresult-based  approach,  further  ADB  assistance  will  be  determined  by  outcomes  of  the  FRGP, \nand by assessment of the financial sector\u2019s emerging needs. \n \nLessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  financial  sector  projects  in  Mongolia  were  taken  into \n43. \naccount in designing the FRGP. The country assistance program evaluation provides valuable \nlessons and recommendations based on an in-depth review of ADB\u2019s operations in Mongolia.15 \nThe evaluation notes that the efficacy of the FSPL I and II would have been strengthened had \nthe underlying issues and priorities been analyzed in more detail during program preparation.16 \nIn  line  with  this  recommendation,  the  FRGP  was  prepared  with  a  comprehensive  project \npreparatory  TA  covering  legal,  regulatory,  policy,  and  institutional  impediments  to  financial \nsector development.  \n \n44. \nA  key  lesson  from  the  FSPL  I  is  that  the  establishment  of  new  institutions  should  be \nbased  on  adequate  analysis  of  the  long-term  viability  of  the  institution,  and  that  sufficient \ncapacity building should be provided to ensure that they are sustainable. The attached TA will \nprovide policy and technical guidance and capacity-building training to ensure the sustainability \nof the proposed Nonbank Financial Regulatory Commission (NBFRC). The attached TA will also \nsupport  the  establishment  of  IT-MIS  in  NBFRC  and  in  the  financial  intelligence  unit  (FIU)  in \nBOM.  The  program  performance  audit  report  for  the  FSPL  I17  emphasizes  the  urgent  need  to \naddress  the  weaknesses  in  the  secured  transactions  framework,  and  recommends  that  the \nadoption  of  legal  reforms  to  improve  the  collateral  framework  be  a  precondition  for  any  new \nADB loan for financial sector reforms. Developing an effective collateral framework is a program \nobjective. \n \n45. \nAn important lesson from the FSPL II is the need to focus on achieving policy objectives \nrather than technical compliance. For instance, even though the policy conditions of the FSPL II \nwere  technically  met,  some  reform  measures  were  not  properly  implemented  and  did  not  fully \ngenerate  expected  results  and  objectives.  The  adoption  of  new  laws  and  regulations  was \ndelayed  partly  because  the  lack  of  understanding,  by  government  officials  and  members  of \nparliament,  of  the  intended  objectives  and  outcomes  the  policy  conditions.  The  lack  of \nunderstanding about the functioning of the capital market, in particular, impeded capital market \nreforms.  The  rationale  for  specific  policy  conditions  must,  therefore,  be  fully  clarified  during \nprogram  preparation.  To  this  end,  stakeholders\u2014including  members  of  parliament,  and \nrepresentatives  from  the  Government,  financial  institutions,  and  the  corporate  sector\u2014have \nbeen  consulted  extensively.  Policy  conditions  related  to  legal  reforms  outline  the  specific \nprovisions that are required to meet the program objectives. Another key lesson from the FSPL \nII is that program implementation is just as important as program design. The effectiveness of \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2002.

Adequate \nimplementation  requires  not  only  urging  the  Government  to  comply  with  policy  conditions, \ndrafting laws and regulations, and providing training through TA, but also maintaining intensive \ndialogue  with  the  Government  and  stakeholders  to  assess  the  relevance  of  proposed  policy \nreforms and to gauge the impact of policy actions. \n \n46. \nThe FSPL II highlighted the importance of creating a conducive policy environment. The \ndisincentive created by the tax system is a reason why the FSPL II reforms were not as effective \nas they should have been in increasing stock market listing and stimulating investor interest in \nthe  capital  market.  The  FRGP\u2019s  tax  reforms  will  help  mitigate  the  distortion  created  by  the \ncurrent tax system. \n \nE. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\n47. \nADB has coordinated closely with Mongolia\u2019s other development partners. The FSPL II \nwas developed and implemented in close coordination with the World Bank\u2019s FSAC. The World \nBank  is  helping  modernize  the  payment  system,  strengthen  risk  management  systems  in \ncommercial  banks,  and  develop  index-based  livestock  insurance.  The  International  Finance \nCorporation (IFC) has provided equity investments, subordinated loans, credit lines, and TA to a \nnumber  of  commercial  banks.  IFC  is  also  helping  promote  the  leasing  industry  by  developing \nthe legal framework and building the capacity of leasing companies. The International Monetary \nFund  (IMF)  has  provided  technical  advice  to  BOM  on  (i)  banking  supervision,  including  asset \nclassification  and  provisioning  standards;  (ii)  the  payment  and  settlement  system;  and  (iii) \naccounting and internal audit in commercial banks. The initial draft of the AML law was prepared \nwith IMF assistance, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has \nprovided short-term advisory assistance for AML regulations and investigative procedures. With \nassistance  from  IMF  and  USAID,  the  Government  recently  prepared  a  reform  proposal  to \nimprove the efficiency of the tax system. A number of bilateral and multilateral aid agencies from \nthe  European  Union,  Germany,  Japan,  and  United  Kingdom  have  provided  credit  lines  to \ncommercial  banks  and  NBFIs  for  loans  to  SMEs.  ADB  has  coordinated  closely  with  other \nexternal  agencies  during  program  preparation  to  maximize  synergies  where  possible,  and  to \navoid duplication of efforts. The development coordination matrix is in Appendix 2. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nObjective and Scope \n\n48. \nThe FRGP\u2019s objective is to help develop a sound and broad-based financial sector that \neffectively channels resources into productive investment. Specifically, the FRGP will seek to (i) \nreduce the cost of borrowing and expand access to credit by improving the collateral framework, \n(ii) improve governance in banks to protect depositors, (iii) enhance the role of the NBF sector in \nsavings mobilization for investment capital, and (iv) improve investor confidence by reducing the \nrisks from potential money laundering through the financial system. The FRGP is designed as a \ncontinuation of the FSPL II, and will build on the progress achieved under the FSPL I and II. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 3. \n \nThe FRGP includes critical policy reforms for financial sector development. The banking \n49. \nsector  reforms  under  the  FRGP  aim  to  reduce  the  cost  of  borrowing  and  expand  access  to \ncredit  by  facilitating  debt  recovery  by  banks  and  by  lowering  the  cost of  collateral  registration. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13 \n\nThis component will introduce legal and regulatory changes to strengthen corporate governance \nin  banks  and  to  improve  the  supervision  of  groups  and  conglomerates  that  control  financial \ninstitutions.  The  NBF  reforms  seek  to  enhance  the  sector\u2019s  role  in  resource  mobilization  and \nallocation by developing the legal and regulatory framework, strengthening regulatory capacity \nby  establishing  a  single  regulator  for  NBF  sector\u2014NBFRC,  and  by  strengthening  corporate \ngovernance  and  investor  protection.  This  component  also  aims  to  reduce  the  distortionary \nimpact  of  tax  policies  on  the  financial  sector.  The  AML  component  seeks  to  mitigate  the  risks \nfrom money laundering by helping develop AML legislation and regulations, and by establishing \nthe FIU in BOM. \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\nPolicy  reforms  are  presented  in  the  policy  matrix.  The  development  policy  letter  (DPL) \n\n50. \nand policy matrix are in Appendix 4. The key measures are as follows: \n \n\n1. \n\nImprove Efficiency and Stability of the Banking System \n\na. \n\nImprove the Collateral Framework \n\n51. \nThe  lack  of  a  well-functioning  collateral  framework  is  a  key  constraint  on  financial \nintermediation.  In  line  with  the  FRGP\u2019s  recommendations,  the  Government  recently  enacted \nlegislation to allow non-judicial foreclosure of collateral and to improve the information available \nfrom  the  property  registration  system.  The  introduction  of  non-judicial  foreclosure  procedures \nwill help lower credit risk by facilitating debt recovery by banks. Improved collateral information \nwill facilitate banks\u2019 credit risk assessment. The FRGP calls for the strengthening of the PRO, \nwhich  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  non-judicial  procedures,  through  adequate \ntraining.  The  FRGP  also  supports  measures \nthe  efficiency  of  document \nauthentication for collateral registration to reduce the cost of notarizing documents. \n  \n52. \nThe  effectiveness  of  the  collateral  framework  depends  not  only  on  the  design  and \nimplementation of the laws and registry system, but also on public awareness about procedures \nand  consequences  of  default.  Therefore,  the  FRGP  recommends  that  commercial  banks  be \nrequired  to  provide  adequate  information  to  potential  borrowers  before  concluding  collateral \nagreements.  \n \n\nimprove \n\nto \n\nb. \n\nStrengthen Corporate Governance \n\n53. \nImproving  banks\u2019  corporate  governance  to  ensure  financial  stability  and  depositor \nprotection  is  one  of  the  FRGP\u2019s  main  objectives.  Amending  the  Banking  Law  to  require  an \nindependent  board  of  directors  is  fundamental  to  improving  commercial  banks\u2019  corporate \ngovernance.  A  broader  ownership  structure  will  also  help  improve  governance.  Therefore,  the \nFRGP recommends that the Banking Law be amended to allow commercial banks to be listed \non  the  stock  exchange  so  that  the  closely  held  ownership  structure  can  be  diversified.  The \nFRGP  calls  for  BOM  to  establish  a  working  group  comprising  representatives  from  BOM  and \nbanks to develop a code of corporate governance to strengthen depositor protection. The code \nwill  outline  principles  on  accountability  to,  and  safeguards  for,  the  public  and  to  principal \nstakeholders;  clearly  delineate  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of  the  board  and  senior \nmanagement; provide for a professional and balanced board of directors with clearly specified \nfiduciary  duties  and  safeguards  against  related-party  transactions;  and  strengthen  disclosure \nand reporting requirements. The FRGP also calls for the designation of a compliance officer to \nensure banks\u2019 compliance with laws and regulations.  \n\n \n\n\f14             \n\n \n\nc. \n\nImprove the Supervision of Banks\u2019 Shareholders and Groups \n\n54. \nTo  monitor  and  mitigate  the  risks  arising  from  banks\u2019  ownership  structure  and  the \nnonbank  financial  activities  of  affiliates  and  major  shareholders,  the  FRGP  calls  for  the \nformation  of  well-defined  formal  groups  by  adopting  the  financial  holding  company  (FHC) \nstructure,  rather  than  informal  groups,  which  are  difficult  to supervise.  The  FRGP  calls  for  the \nGovernment  to  amend  the  Banking  Law  to  require  a  financial  group  that  owns  two  or  more \nbanks, or banks and nonbank financial intermediaries to take the form of FHC. The FRGP will \nhelp  develop  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework  for  FHCs,  including  (i)  consolidated \nfinancial  reporting  and  disclosure,  risk  assessment,  and  supervision;  and  (ii)  mechanisms  to \nenhance  coordination  and  information  exchange  among  BOM  and  other  financial  regulators. \nThe  FRGP  calls  for  the  improved  regulation  on  the  definitions,  limitations,  and  reporting  and \ndisclosure  of  related-party  transactions  to  strengthen  the  BOM\u2019s  monitoring  of  related-party \ntransactions. Establishment of FHCs will also help develop the NBF sector by allowing qualified \nbanks to engage in a wider range of financial activities (including brokering/dealing, underwriting \nand managing investment funds) through affiliates and subsidiaries under the FHC structure. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnhance the Role of the NBF Sector in Financial Intermediation \n\na. \n\nImprove Regulatory and Supervisory Structure \n\n55. \nNBF regulation is weak and fragmented. The individual NBF regulators do not have the \nresources and expertise to effectively oversee the insurance sector and the securities market. \nLikewise,  BOM\u2019s  regulatory  resources  are  focused  primarily  on  the  banking  sector.  There  is  a \nstrong rationale for establishing a single NBFRC for NBFIs, SCCs, insurance, and the securities \nmarket. Specifically, an integrated framework will improve efficiency by allowing for the sharing \nof  infrastructure  and  human  resources  such  as  administrative  and  personnel  services,  IT \nspecialist,  chief  accountant,  and  chief  enforcement  officer.  The  cost  saving  from  consolidation \ncould then be used to improve the quality of supervision by upgrading and maintaining IT-MIS; \nbuilding capacity of existing staff; and recruiting more specialized experts in the areas of credit \ncooperatives,  the  securities  market,  and  insurance.  An  integrated  agency  will  increase  the \nchances of attracting and retaining qualified staff by offering more varied and challenging career \npaths.  More  important,  having  a  single  regulator  with  an  explicit  mandate  to  promote  the \ndevelopment  of  NBF  sector  and  to  protect  investors  will  improve  accountability  and  enhance \ninvestor awareness and confidence in the sector. Having a larger pool of staff will facilitate the \nswitching  of  regulatory  staff  from  one  subsector  to  another  in  the  event  of  significant  market \nturbulence.  For  instance,  should  there  be  a  catastrophic  event  that  had  a  large  impact  on  the \ninsurance sector, NBRFC would be able to temporarily deploy additional staff to this subsector.  \n \n56.  While  Mongolia  could  adopt  a  fully  integrated  financial  services  authority  over  the  long \nterm, NBRFC is a more appropriate structure in the medium-term. There is a significant gap in \nthe  level  of  development  between  the  banking  and  NBF  sectors,  as  well  as  between  the \ncapacity of BOM and of MSEC and ISU. Gradual consolidation is important to facilitate smooth \ntransition  and  to  ensure  that  bank  supervision  is  not  compromised.  Once  a  core  group  of \nqualified regulators has been developed within NBFRC, the Government can decide to merge \nbank and NBF sector regulation under a single regulator.  \n \n57. \nThe  FRGP  supports  the  establishment  of  NBFRC,  which  will  be  responsible  for \nregulating  and  supervising  the  NBFIs,  insurance  companies,  SCCs,  and  the  securities  market \nand  intermediaries.  This  will  entail  (i)  developing  the  legal  basis  for  establishing  a  more \nindependent,  accountable,  and  transparent  regulator;  (ii)  preparing  a  time-sequenced  action \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15 \n\nplan for the start-up of NBFRC, including identification of budget and staffing requirements; and \n(iii)  developing  mechanisms  for  effective  coordination  between  MOF,  BOM,  and  NBFRC  to \nfacilitate policy coordination and harmonization of regulation and enforcement of applicable laws \nand regulations. To enable NBFRC to better manage financial sector risks, and more generally \nto meet its mandate of promoting financial sector stability and development, the FRGP calls for \nthe establishment of adequate IT equipment in NBFRC. \n \n58. \nThe FRGP incorporates measures to strengthen MSE. It recommends that MSE develop \na  plan  for  self-regulation  identifying  MSE\u2019s  functions,  and  clearly  distinguishing  between \nMSEC\u2019s and MSE\u2019s roles. In line with the Government\u2019s medium-term objective, the FRGP will \nhelp prepare MSE for divestiture by developing a medium-term strategy to improve revenue and \noperational capacity.  \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthen the Legal and Regulatory Framework  \n\n59. \nA  clear  and  comprehensive  legal  basis  is  fundamental  for  the  effective  regulation  and \nsupervision of the financial sector. The FRGP recommends a number of revisions to the Law on \nSecurities  Market  to  address  the  weaknesses  identified  above.  Specifically,  the  amended  law \nshould (i) clearly distinguish between the provisions that apply to public and to private offers, (ii) \nclarify  that  joint  stock  companies  are  not  required  to  be  listed  on  MSE,  (iii)  strengthen  the \nobligations of the governing persons of investment funds and fund management companies, (iv) \nintroduce  \u201cfit  and  proper\u201d  requirement  for  the  governing  persons  of  securities  issuers  and \nprofessional participants, and (v) clearly state that it is an offense for an individual or an entity to \nconduct the business of a securities market intermediary without obtaining license from MSEC. \n \n60. \nThe FRGP will help develop regulatory framework for the insurance sector. Specifically, \nthe FRGP recommends that the Government issue regulations that include licensing, prudential \nand reporting requirements for insurance companies. \n \n61. \nThe FRGP recommends that the Government amend the Law on Cooperatives to clearly \ndefine  membership  requirements,  authorized  business  activities,  supervision,  sanctions,  and \nauthorized methods to terminate SCC activities. In view of the scarcity of regulatory resources \nand the growing number of SCCs, the FRGP calls for the introduction of appropriate licensing \nrequirements to check excessive growth in the number of SCCs. The FRGP recommends that \nNBFRC use a risk-based approach concentrating on the larger and potential \u201cproblem\u201d SCCs. \nFor instance, the frequency of on-site inspections could be based on the size of the SCC and \nthe risk assessment from on-site and off-site inspections. \n \n\nc. \n\nEnhance Investor Confidence by Strengthening Governance and \nTransparency  \n\n62.  While investor confidence in the financial sector is generally weak, it is particularly low in \nthe case of the capital market. Confidence in the equity market was seriously undermined in the \nlate  1990s when  over  300,000  investors  lost  close  to  MNT1  billion  because  of  the  collapse of \nthe two custodian banks holding clearing funds of equity investors. In January 2002, the cabinet \ninstructed  MOF  and  the  State  Property  Committee  to  use  a  portion  of  the  proceeds  from \nprivatization of a number SOEs to compensate investors. However, so far only 3,500 investors \nhave received a total of MNT347 million in compensation. To help restore investor confidence, \nthe FRGP calls for the compensation of all eligible investors. \n \n\n \n\n\f16             \n\n \n\nThe FRGP calls for NBFRC to require regulated entities, including insurance companies, \n63. \nNBFIs, and securities market participants to appoint at least two independent directors and one \ndesignated  compliance  officer.  The  FRGP  calls  for  the  establishment  of  \u201cfit  and  proper\u201d \nstandards  for  officers  and  directors  of  regulated  entities,  whereby  NBFRC  will  be  able  to \nprescribe,  and  review  the  qualification  of,  appointed  or  elected  officers  and  directors.  The \ncompliance  officer  will  be  primarily  responsible  for  stakeholder  protection  by  detecting, \npreventing,  and  resolving  problems  before  they  become  rule  violations.  The  FRGP  thus \nrecommends  that  NBFRC,  in  coordination  with  BOM,  develop  and  administer  a  training  and \ncertification program.  \n \n64. \nAmending  the  Company  Law  will  be  crucial  for  enhancing  corporate  governance  and \ninvestor  protection.  The  main  amendments  proposed  include  (i)  limiting  the  total  number  of \nfounding and non-founding members of a limited liability company to 50; and (ii) creating a new \ncategory of \u201cpublic company\u201d, which will include (a) a joint stock company, (b) a limited liability \ncompany  licensed  by  BOM  or  NBFRC,  and  (c)  a  limited  liability  company  that  has  access  to \npublic  funds  by  offering  debt  securities.  The  first  amendment  will  prevent  limited  liability \ncompanies, which are subject to lower standards of governance, from accessing funds from the \npublic. The second amendment captures financial institutions and companies that have access \nto funds from the public, which can then be subject to higher standards of corporate governance \nand disclosure. For instance, public companies will be required to have a board of directors with \nwell-defined roles and responsibilities. Public companies will also be required to submit to MSE \nand/or  the  supervisor  their  annual  reports,  including  audited  financial  statements  and \ngovernance practices.  \n \nTo  promote  transparency  based  on  disclosure  of  reliable,  relevant,  and  timely \n65. \ninformation,  the  FRGP  recommends  that  NBFRC,  MSE,  and  BOM  gradually  publish  through \ntheir website the annual audited financial statements of all public companies. \n \n\nd. \n\nRemove Tax Impediments \n\nthe  provisions \n\n66. \nIn  line  with  the  FRGP  recommendation,  the  Government  recently  submitted  to \nParliament  draft  amendments  to  the  CIT  Law.  The  draft  amendments  aim  to  reduce  the \ndistortion created by the two-tier tax structure, which is biased against large firms and thereby \nimpedes capital market development. Specifically, the amendments will increase the threshold \nfor  the  30%  tax  bracket  from  the  current  level of  MNT100  million  to  MNT500  million,  reducing \nthe  disincentives  for  companies  to  grow.  The  Government  views  this  as  an  intermediate  step \ntoward introducing a single corporate tax rate over the long term. The amendments also aim to \nharmonize \nfinancial \nintermediaries, and to make insurance premiums paid by legal entities during ordinary course of \nbusiness tax-deductible.  \n \n67. \nHowever, the draft amendments do not fully harmonize the tax treatment of returns on \ndifferent types of financial assets, not only discouraging public investment in stocks but also the \nlisting  of  companies.  Therefore,  the  FRGP  recommends  harmonizing  the  taxation  of  interest \nincome  on  bank  deposits  and  corporate  bonds,  and  dividends  and  capital  gains  from  equity \ninvestment.  \n \n\nlosses  between  banks  and  nonbank \n\nfor  probable \n\n3. \n\nEstablish an Effective Anti-Money-Laundering Regime  \n\n68. \nAs a first step toward establishing an effective AML regime, the Government has drafted \nan  AML  law.  The  draft  law  is  being  finalized  for  submission  to  Parliament.  Once  the  AML \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17 \n\nlegislation  is  in  place,  appropriate  regulatory  and  institutional  arrangements  will  have  to  be \nestablished and institutional capacity built to effectively implement the law. The FRGP calls for \nthe development of the legal and regulatory framework, and the establishment of an FIU in BOM \nas  the lead AML  agency.  Establishing  the  FIU will  entail  the  adoption of  rules  and  regulations \nunder the AML law, approval of structure and appointment of key staff, and development of the \nIT  system  for  monitoring  and  reporting  suspicious  financial  transactions.  Besides  training  the \nFIU  staff,  the  FRGP  also  recommends  that  BOM  train  financial  institutions  in  compliance  with \nthe  AML  law  and  regulations,  and  relevant  agencies  in  the  investigation  and  prosecution  of \nmoney laundering. \n \n69. \nCoordination among all related entities is essential for the AML system to be effective. \nThe  FRGP  calls  for  the  establishment  of  a  national  coordinating  committee  (NCC)  comprising \nBOM, MOF, the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs (MOJ), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the \npolice, and NBFRC. The FRGP also recommends forming a financial sector liaison committee \n(FSLC)  representing  relevant  government  agencies  and  compliance  officers  of  financial \ninstitutions.  The  FSLC  will  provide  a  framework  for  coordination  and  consultation  between \ngovernment agencies and the financial sector. \n \nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\nThe  FRGP  aims  to  address  legal,  regulatory,  institutional,  and  policy  constraints  on \n70. \nfinancial sector development. The FRGP will enhance the efficiency of financial intermediation \nby  developing  a  broad-based  financial  system  with  alternative  channels  for  resource \nmobilization  and  allocation.  This  will,  in  turn,  promote  economic  growth  and  create  jobs.  The \ndevelopment of a robust and broad-based financial system will reduce the likelihood of financial \ncrises  that  could  wipe  out  savings  and  have  adverse  macroeconomic  consequences  such  as \nhigher  inflation  and  tax  rates.  The  FRGP  is  designed  as  a  continuation  the  FSPL  II,  and  will \nbuild on the achievements of the FSPL I and II. The reforms proposed under the FRGP are fully \nin line with the Government\u2019s priorities and medium-term objectives. \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy  reforms  by  providing  a  loan  of \n71. \nSDR6,917,000  ($10  million).  The  Borrower  will  be  Mongolia.  The  loan  will  be  from  the  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources. The loan will have a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, and an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per year for \nthe remaining period. The loan proceeds are expected to be used over a period of 48 months \nfrom the date of effectiveness.  \n \n72. \nThe  proposed  loan  size  is  based  on  the  estimated  short-  to  medium-term  adjustment \ncosts resulting from the FRGP. The adjustment costs are not easily quantifiable, but the direct \nand more obvious adjustment costs amount to about $19.5 million, including the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nNBFRC.  While  its  establishment  will  result  in  significant  cost  savings  through \neconomies  of  scale  and  improved  efficiency  in  the  long  run,  it  will  entail  certain \ncosts  in  the  short  to  medium  term.  This  will  include  mainly  costs  of  recruiting \nspecialized experts, training existing staff, developing and issuing guidelines and \nprocedures, and establishing IT-MIS. Estimated cost: $4 million. \nCollateral  framework.  Once  the  legislation  on  non-judicial  foreclosure  is  in \nplace, the Government will need to develop guidelines and procedures and train \n\n \n\n\f18             \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthe  PRO  and  commercial  bank  staff  in  the  new  procedures  for  non-judicial \nforeclosure. Estimated cost: $0.5 million. \nInvestor compensation. The FRGP calls for compensating eligible investors for \nthe  losses  incurred  in  the  equity  market  caused  by  the  failure  of  two  custodian \nbanks holding clearing funds of investors. Estimated cost: $1 million. \nTax reforms. The FRGP calls for changes in the corporate income tax to reduce \nthe  distortion  created  by  the  two-tier  structure.  The  FRGP  calls  for  harmonizing \nthe  tax  treatment  on  returns  from  bank  deposits  and  equity  investments. \nEstimated cost: $12 million. \nAML regime.  To establish an effective AML regime, the Government will need \nto develop legislation; issue regulations; invest in IT-MIS for the FIU; train the FIU \nstaff;  and  train  financial  institutions  in  compliance,  and  relevant  agencies  in \ninvestigation and prosecution of money laundering. Estimated cost: $2 million. \n\n \n73. \nAlthough  no  cofinancing  is  envisioned  now,  cofinancing  from  commercial  sources  may \nbe mobilized later to complement ADB financing. Such cofinancing may benefit from ADB credit \nenhancement, including ADB guarantee instruments, and will be presented separately for Board \nconsideration as and when it arises. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nthe \n\nincluding \n\nthe  administration  and  disbursement  of \n\n74.  MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  FRGP,  and  will  be  responsible  for  its  overall \nimplementation, \nloan  proceeds, \nmaintenance of accounts, and reporting to ADB. BOM will be the Implementing Agency for the \nbanking sector and AML components, and NBFRC will be the Implementing Agency for the NBF \nsector component. MOF will set up an interagency coordination committee headed by the MOF \nstate secretary, and comprising representatives of BOM, NBFRC, MSE, MOJ, and PRO under \nMOC. The committee will meet every quarter to coordinate and ensure effective reforms. ADB \nwill be a member of the committee to oversee the FRGP\u2019s progress.  \n \n75. \nNBFRC will oversee and coordinate the development and implementation of the IT-MIS \nfor  effective  monitoring  and  managing  of  financial  sector  risks  through  a  management  team \ncomprising  two  NBFRC  staff  members  (one  manager  and  one  IT  expert),  one  MOF  staff \nmember,  and  the  international  financial  supervisory  IT  system  specialist  recruited  under  the \nattached TA. The IT expert will be assigned full-time to develop and implement the IT-MIS. The \nteam  will  be  located  in  NBFRC.  The  international  financial  supervisory  IT  system  specialist \nrecruited  under  the  attached  TA  will  head  the  team,  and  will  report  jointly  to  the  MOF  state \nsecretary and the NBFRC managing director. \n \n76. \nBOM will oversee and coordinate the development and implementation of the IT-MIS for \nanalyzing  and  reporting  suspicious  financial  transactions  through  a  management  team \ncomprising  two  BOM  staff  members  (one  manager  and  one  IT  expert),  one  NBFRC  staff \nmember,  and  the  international  FIU  information  system  specialist  recruited  under  the  attached \nTA.  The  BOM  IT  expert  will  be  assigned  full-time  to  develop  and  implement  the  IT-MIS.  The \nteam will be located in BOM. The international FIU IT system specialist will head the team, and \nwill report to the MOF state secretary and the BOM deputy governor.  \n \n\n1. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n77. \nIn  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for \nprogram loans, all goods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19 \n\nbe  procured  in  accordance  with  standard  public  procedures  in  Mongolia  and  normal  private \nsector  commercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n78.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  items  produced \nand  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  other  than  the  items  specified  in  the  negative  list  of \nineligible  items  (Appendix  5)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources. \nThe  Government  will  certify  that  the  volume  of  eligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s \nprojected disbursement under the loan for the given period. ADB reserves the right to audit the \nuse of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  improving  public  financial  management  systems. \n79. \nOngoing  reforms  include  enhancing  public  accounting  and  auditing  standards  and  building \ncapacity  of  the  National  Audit  Office.  The  Government  is  also  making  continued  efforts  to \nimprove public financial management and to increase budget transparency by consolidating all \nbudget  resources  into  the  treasury  single  account.  The  financial  management  arrangements \nare, therefore, satisfactory. ADB will closely monitor program implementation to ensure that the \noutputs envisaged are achieved. \n \nADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government. \n80. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  will  be  included  in  the  Loan  Agreement  for  the \nProgram. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n81. \n The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  local  currency  funds  generated  by  the  program \nloan will be used, first, to support the adjustment cost of reforms under the FRGP, and second, \nto finance expenditures for general development purposes of Mongolia. \n \n\n3. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching  \n\n82. \nThe Government and ADB will continue to engage in active dialogue on sector issues, \npolicy  reforms,  and  other  measures  during  program  implementation  and  on  additional  reforms \nthat  may  be  considered  necessary  or  desirable.  ADB  will  field  regular  missions  to  confirm \ncompliance  with  conditions  for  the  second  tranche  and  advise  on  actions  to  maintain \nimplementation on course. The Indicative Implementation Schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n83. \nThe program period will be 4 years. The loan will be released in two equal tranches. The \nfirst,  SDR3,458,500  ($5  million  equivalent),  will  be  released  upon  loan  effectiveness.  The \nsecond, SDR3,458,500 ($5 million equivalent), will be released 24 months after Board approval, \nprovided  that  ADB  is  satisfied  that  the  Government  has  made  sufficient  progress  in \nimplementing the FRGP and, in particular, all the second-tranche release conditions set forth in \nthe  policy  matrix  in  Appendix  4  have  been  met.  All  the  monitorable  actions  listed in  the  policy \nmatrix  must  be  taken  by  the  Government  during  the  FRGP.  While  these  actions  are  not \nconditions  for  the  release  of  the  first  or  second  tranche,  they  are  crucial  to  achieving  the \nobjectives set forth in the policy matrix.  \n \n\n \n\n\f20             \n\n \n\n4. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n84. \nThe  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  reports  on  program  implementation. \nThey  will  describe  progress  made,  any  changes  to  the  implementation  schedule,  and  any \nproblems  encountered  and  remedial  actions  taken.  A  program  completion  report  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB within 3 months of program completion. \n \n\n5. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n85.  MOF  will  establish  and  maintain  a  program  performance  evaluation  system  that  will \ninclude  a  database  on  the  status  on  policy  measures  and  program  indicators  based  on  the \npolicy matrix and the design and monitoring framework. \n \n\n6. \n\nProgram Review \n\n86. \nThe Government and ADB will conduct a comprehensive midterm review at the end of \nyear 2, and a program performance completion review at the end of the FRGP to evaluate the \nprogress of the reform measures and their impact on the financial sector. ADB will also monitor \nimplementation through regular reviews and progress reports throughout implementation. Based \non these reviews, modifications and improvements will be considered. \n \n87. \nAbout  6  weeks  before  the  anticipated  withdrawal  of  the  second  tranche,  or  such  other \ntime  as  the  Government  and  ADB  may  agree,  ADB  will  review  the  Government\u2019s  progress  in \nimplementing  the  policy  reforms  under  the  FRGP  set  out  in  the  development  policy  letter  and \nthe policy matrix, including the fulfillment of the conditions for the second-tranche release listed \nin the policy matrix. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n88. \nThe TA\u2019s purpose is to help implement the policy reforms called for in the FRGP, and to \nstrengthen the capacities of NBFRC and FIU. Specifically, the TA will help the Government (i) \nimplement  the  procedures  for  non-judicial  foreclosure  of  collateral;  (ii)  establish  NBFRC  by \ndeveloping transition arrangements, organizational structure, and internal procedures; (iii) draft \nlaws and regulations to address the weaknesses and gaps in the legal framework; (iv) introduce \ncorporate  governance  structure  and  practices  in  banks,  nonbank  financial  intermediaries,  and \nsecurities  issuers;  (v)  develop  IT-MIS  for  NBFRC  and  FIU;  and  (vi)  provide  capacity-building \ntraining on financial regulation, on on-site and off-site supervision, on accounting, auditing and \nreporting standards, and on IT-MIS. \n \nThe  TA  will  require  a  total  of  63  person-months  of  consulting  services  (23  person-\n89. \nmonths\u2019 international and 40 person-months\u2019 national). The international consultants will include \na nonbank financial regulatory specialist/team leader, a financial sector legal expert, a financial \nsector  accounting  expert,  a  financial  supervisory  information  system  specialist,  and  an  FIU \ninformation  system  specialist.  The  TA  will  require  national  consultants  who  will  each  have \nbackground  in  the  above  five  areas,  and  will  engage  a  national  consultant  to  facilitate  the \ncollateral  reforms.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  by  ADB  through  firms,  selected  under  the \nquality- and cost-based selection method using the simplified technical proposal in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \non the engagement of national consultants. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 7. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21 \n\nThe TA is estimated to cost $1,120,000 equivalent, including the foreign exchange cost \n90. \nof  $740,000  and  local  currency  cost  of  $380,000.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to \nfinance $900,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $160,000 equivalent \nof the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide $220,000 equivalent through \nin  kind  contributions  of  counterpart  staff,  office  facilities,  and  logistical  support.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan is in Appendix 7. \n \n91.  MOF will be the Executing Agency. BOM and NBFRC will be the implementing agencies. \nThe TA will be implemented over 24 months, starting January 2006. \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\nThe FRGP will promote financial system stability and enhance economic growth through \n92. \nefficient resource mobilization and allocation. The collateral reforms will help reduce the cost of \nborrowing  and  increase  access  to  credit.  The  measures  to  improve  corporate  governance  in \nbanks  will  enhance  depositor  protection.  The  increased  role  of  the  NBF  sector  in  financial \nintermediation  will  reduce  the  risks  associated  with  over-reliance  on  the  banking  system. \nIncreased  competition  from  alternative  sources  of  financial  intermediation  will  enhance \nefficiency, and the financial system as a whole will become more resilient to exogenous shocks. \nFirms  will  be  able  to  diversify  their  source  of  capital  and  have  access  to  long-term  funds  for \nproductive investment.  \n \n93. \nBy increasing access to credit, savings instruments, and insurance products, the FRGP \nwill  help  protect  the  poor  from  income  disruptions  and  enable  them  to  meet  unanticipated \nexpenditures.  The  development  of  viable  SCCs  will  enhance  financial  sector  outreach  to  the \nvulnerable and the poor. AML reforms will help enhance investor protection and confidence and \nfinancial  stability  by  minimizing  the  scope  for  money  laundering  through  the  financial  system. \nThe summary of poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 8. \n \n94. \n \n\nSpecific benefits can be outlined as follows:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nfor  non-judicial \n\nAdopting  procedures \nforeclosure  will  reduce  credit  risk. \nStrengthening  the  PRO  and  improving  document  authentication  procedures  will \nreduce the cost of collateral registration. These measures will reduce the cost of \nborrowing and improve access to credit. \nBy  introducing  legal  and  regulatory  measures  to  improve  governance  in \ncommercial  banks,  the  FRGP  will  help  ensure  depositor  protection.  Depositor \nprotection  will  also  be  enhanced  by  improving  supervision  of  groups  and \nconglomerates that control financial institutions. \nThe  FRGP  will  help  develop  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  the  NBF \nsector, including NBFIs, the insurance sector, the capital market, and SCCs. This \nwill  increase  access  to  long-term  funding,  and  savings  and  insurance  products. \nBy helping establish an effective regulator for the NBF sector, the FRGP will help \nensure  that  the  sector  is  adequately  supervised  and  the  laws  and  regulations \nenforced, thereby enhancing investor protection. \nThe  Government\u2019s  adherence  to  its  policy\u2014as  announced  through  the  2001 \nparliament  resolution\u2014of  compensating  investors  who  suffered  losses  in  the \n\n \n\n\f22             \n\n \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nequity market in the late 1990s will help restore investor confidence and generate \ninvestment in the capital markets. \nInvestor  confidence  will  be  boosted  by  measures  to  improve  disclosure  by \nfinancial  institutions  and  securities  issuers.  By  improving  the  accuracy  and \ntimeliness  of  financial  statements,  the  FRGP  will  enable  investors  to  better \nassess the potential risks and rewards of their investments. \nBy  reducing  the  distortions  created  by  the  two-tier  corporate  tax  system,  the \nFRGP  will  promote  corporate  sector  and  capital  market  development. \nHarmonizing  the  tax  treatment  of  returns  on  different  types  of  financial \ninvestment will help develop a more balanced and resilient financial system. \nAn effective AML system will strengthen investor confidence in general and in the \nfinancial  sector  in  particular,  as  money  laundering  generally  stems  from \ncorruption and other criminal activities.  \n\nB. \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\nPoor management of the transition to NBFRC is a key risk. A number of measures have \n95. \nbeen  taken  to  facilitate  timely  and  orderly  transition.  An  overall  strategy  and  a  detailed  time-\nbound  action  plan  have  been  prepared  in  close  consultation  with  the  Government  and  other \nstakeholders.  During  program  preparation,18  considerable  efforts  were  made  to  reach  a \ncommon understanding and consensus among different government agencies on the objectives \nand  the  structure  of  NBFRC.  BOM  has  committed  to  transfer  at  least  eight  qualified  staff \nmembers to NBFRC, and the Government has agreed to allocate budget to ensure an adequate \npool  of  qualified  professional  staff  to  conduct  regulatory,  supervisory,  and  enforcement \nfunctions. The attached TA will provide policy and technical guidance and training for a smooth \ntransition. \n \n96. \nAnother  risk  is  that  the  introduction  of  new  legislation  and  legal  amendments  will  be \ndelayed  significantly  and/or  will  not  fully  meet  the  program  objectives.  Inconsistencies  among \ndifferent  laws  could  create  confusion  and  loopholes.  This  risk  is  minimized  to  the  extent  that \nmany of the laws called for in the FRGP were drafted during program preparation or under other \nADB projects. In line with the recommendation of the program completion report for the FSPL II, \nstakeholder  consultations  were  held  during  program  preparation  to  ensure  that  the  expected \noutcomes  of  the  legal  reforms  are  fully  understood.  A  number  of  crucial  laws,  including  those \nrelated to the collateral framework, tax reforms, and the establishment of NBFRC, have either \nbeen already enacted or submitted to Parliament. The attached TA will further support the legal \nreforms  and  aim  to  ensure  that  any  revisions  made  by  the Government  do  not  undermine  the \neffectiveness of the laws. \n \n97. \nResistance from vested interests to certain reform measures is also a potential risk. It is \nparticularly  relevant  to  the  AML  and  tax  reform  measures.  So  far,  the  Government  has \nexpressed strong commitment to implementing AML reforms. The Government has prepared a \ndraft AML law. Submission of the law to Parliament is a condition for loan effectiveness. A TA19 \nis helping develop implementing regulations and a blueprint for IT and reporting requirements, \nand  is  providing  related  training  to  government  agencies  and  financial  institutions.  This  will \nfacilitate AML reforms. With assistance from IMF and USAID, the Government has prepared a \nreform  proposal  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  overall  tax  system.

However,  numerous  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  were  inherited  from  the \nmonobanking  system.  Continued  directed  lending  to  poorly  performing  enterprises  further \ndamaged  the  solvency  and  stability  of  the  banking  system.  In  1996,  four  of  the  five  largest \nbanks could not meet the liquidity ratio of 20% set by the Bank of Mongolia (BOM). Two major \nbanks  were  closed  in  1996  and  their  assets  were  transferred  to  the  newly  established \nReconstruction Bank. Reconstruction Bank and another major bank were closed down in 1999, \nwhile  another  major  bank  (Agriculture  Bank)  was  placed  under  receivership  and  subsequently \nrehabilitated.  Some  small  banks  were  also  liquidated  during  the  late  1990s.  Over  the  past \ndecade, banking laws and regulations have been strengthened; the Government\u2019s involvement \nin bank operations has been substantially reduced; and a well-functioning interbank market has \nbeen  introduced.  As  a  result,  public  confidence  in  the  banking  sector  has  been  strengthened \nand the sector has grown rapidly over the past few years. \n \nMongolia has 17 banks, of which 1 is fully state-owned, 2 have state participation, and \n2. \n14 are private. All the banks are limited liability companies with a small number of shareholders \n(1\u20134) controlling majority of shares. The 17 banks have a total of 684 branches and offices, of \nwhich  around  500  are  outside  Ulaanbaatar.  The  sector  is  highly  concentrated,  with  the  four \nlargest  banks  accounting  for  61%  of  total  banking  assets  and  69%  of  deposits.  Each  of  the \nseven smallest banks has assets of less than MNT20 billion. BOM will increase minimum capital \nrequirements of banks from the current MNT4 billion to MNT8 billion in 2006. Since 10 of the 17 \nbanks have capital levels under MNT5 billion, and only 31 have capital levels exceeding MNT8 \nbillion,  the  increase  in  the  minimum  capital  requirement  is  expected  to  lead  to  consolidation \nwithin the banking sector. \n \n\n2. \n\nRegulation and Supervision \n\nThe \n\nloan \n\nloan  classification  and \n\n3. \nThe Banking Law, enacted in 1996 and amended a number of times since, provides the \nlegal basis for BOM to regulate and supervise the banking sector. About 40 staff members are \nin  charge  of  supervising  17  banks.  BOM  has  made  substantial  progress  in  strengthening  its \nregulatory  capacities  in  recent  years.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  has  been \nsupporting BOM in establishing and upgrading various regulations.  \n \n4. \nloss  provisioning  standards  are  simple  and \nconservative, and are well implemented. The classification criteria consist of quantitative criteria \nbased  on  the  duration  of  loan  overdue  and  qualitative  criteria  based  on  the  conditions  of \nborrowers.  To  minimize  discretion,  the  qualitative  criteria  are  only  used  to  downgrade  the \nclassification  derived  from  quantitative  criteria  and  are  mainly  based  on  numerical  indicators \nsuch  as  return  on  assets2  and  capital\u2013asset  ratio.  The  amount  of  loan  loss  provisioning  is \ndetermined  according  to  the  classification  under  the  BOM  guidelines  (e.g.,  1%  for  performing, \n5%  for  past  due).  The  required  provisioning  rates  for  substandard  and  doubtful  loans  were \nincreased  by  the  amendment  of  the  guidelines  (25\u201340%  for  substandard,  and  50\u201375%  for \ndoubtful) in 2004. Commercial banks submit loan classification reports monthly to BOM. \n                                                 \n1 Golomt Bank, Anod Bank, and Chinggis Bank. \n2 Net profit as a percentage of assets. \n\n \n\n\f  \n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n25\n\n \nBOM  has  established  a  standard  set  of  prudential  ratio  regulations,  including  for  (i) \n5. \ncapital adequacy, (ii) liquidity, (iii) credit concentration, and (iv) foreign exchange risk. Banks are \nrequired to submit reports on these indicators every month. A prompt corrective action program \nhas been established to allow BOM to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized banks, \nfrom  an  order  to  cease  paying  dividends  to  placement  of  the  bank  in  conservatorship, \ndepending on capital inadequacy. \n \n6. \nAlthough  standard  articles  about  related-party  lending  and  major  shareholder  rules  are \nincluded  the  Banking  Law,  they  appear  insufficient  to  check  the  transactions  within  informal \ngroups  of  enterprises.  The  multi-layered  ownership  structures  of  banks  and  company  groups \nmake it difficult for BOM to find out the scope of a single borrower, related parties, or controlling \nshareholder.  Although  BOM  has  the  authority  to  conduct  on-site  inspection  of  banks\u2019 \nshareholders under the law, it rarely uses this authority.  \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Conditions and Operations \n\nBanks\u2019  financial  conditions  have  improved  considerably  since  the  late  1990s.  The  total \n7. \ncapital\u2013asset ratio of the banking sector increased from below 4% in 1998 to 15% in 2004. The \nNPL ratio declined from 54% in 1999 to 8% in 2001, and stayed at 7\u201311% until 2004. The loan \nloss reserve has been provisioned according to BOM guidelines and stands at a high level. The \nbanking sector as a whole has been profitable for the past 5 years (2000\u20132004).  \n \n8. \nDespite  significant  improvements  in  financial  conditions,  rapid  credit  expansion  since \n2001  and  subsequent  gradual  decline  of  asset  quality  in  banks  have  raised  concerns.  The \noutstanding loan amount increased from MNT67 billion at the end of 2000 to MNT635 billion at \nthe  end  of  2004.  The  average  rate  of  annual  credit  expansion  during  2001\u20132003  was  88%, \nwhereas credit grew by 44% in 2004. The NPL ratio showed an upturn from 7% in 2002 to 8% in \n2003  and  11%  in  2004.  Although  this  may  be  partly  caused  by  stricter  asset  classification \ncriteria  set  by  BOM,  the  performance  of  the  loans  provided  during  rapid  credit  expansion \nappears poor. Judging from the increase in the absolute NPL amount (MNT10.9 billion in 2001 \nto MNT70.5 billion in 2004), a high percentage (5\u20137%)3 of loans were newly classified as NPLs \nin  each  year  during  2001  and  2004.  Weak  risk  assessment  and  management  capacity  and \ninternal controls in banks is a main reason for weak loan performance. Even the top banks have \nnot established up-to-standard internal credit rating systems. Certain banks are believed to lend \nsignificant  amounts  to  those  close  to  bank  management  and  shareholders  at  below-market \nrates,  and  without  considering  the  borrowers\u2019  creditworthiness.  The  gap  between  the  actual \ninterest income of banks and the interest income calculated from the reported interest rates is \none indication of the widespread use of such preferred interest rates.  \n \nAnother  concern  regarding  the  banks\u2019  financial  conditions  is  declining  profitability. \n9. \nAlthough the net profit (after tax) of the entire banking sector has increased from MNT8.8 billion \nin 2001 to MNT17.3 billion in 2004, return on assets has declined from 3.9% in 2000 to 1.6% in \n2004.  One  of  the  reasons  for  the  declining  profitability  is  the  increased  loan  loss  provisioning \ncaused  by  the  deterioration  of  asset  quality  and  application  of  stricter  provisioning  standards. \nThe narrowing interest rate margin and slow increase of fee income are also important factors. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3 The precise amount of newly classified NPLs is difficult to obtain. However, it can be estimated by using the data on \n\nchanges in the amount of NPLs, and data on loan loss provisioning.  \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n  Appendix 1 \n\n \nItem \n\n Commercial Banks \n Capital \n\n  \n Capital Adequacya \n Assets \n\n Deposit Base \n \n\n Outstanding Loan \n\n Nonperforming Loan \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Net Profit \n Return on Assetsb \n Interest Rate \n\n Deposit Rate \n\n Lending Rate  \n\n Central Bank Rate \n\nTable A1.1:Summary Statistics for the Banking Sector \n\nUnit \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\nNumber \n\nMNT billion, year-end \n\n$ million, year-end \nPercentage of GDP \n\nPercent  \n\nMNT billion, year-end \n\n$ million, year-end \nPercentage of GDP \n\nMNT billion, year-end \nPercentage change \n\nPercentage of GDP \n\nMNT billion, year-end \n\nPercentage change \n\nPercentage of GDP \n\nMNT billion year-end \n\nPercentage change \n\nMNT billion  \n\nPercent \n\n \n\np.a., year-end \n\np.a., year-end \n\np.a., year-end \n\n12\n\n19.1\n\n17.8\n\n2.1\n\n10.5\n\n182.3\n\n170.0\n\n19.7\n\n12\n\n29.9\n\n27.3\n\n2.9\n\n13.3\n\n225.7\n\n205.7\n\n22.2\n\n16 \n\n47.2 \n\n42.8 \n\n4.2 \n\n14.2 \n\n16 \n\n61.3 \n\n54.5 \n\n4.9 \n\n12.4 \n\n17\n\n110.4\n\n81.0\n\n8.1\n\n13.4\n\n17\n\n167.1\n\n138.2\n\n10.7\n\n15.1\n\n332.7 \n\n493.0 \n\n826.1 1,108.8\n\n301.9 \n\n438.2 \n\n707.3\n\n917.2\n\n29.8 \n\n39.7 \n\n60.6\n\n61.3\n\n126.7\n\n157.9\n\n221.9 \n\n349.3 \n\n571.8\n\n697.8\n\n40.5 \n\n19.9 \n\n57.4 \n\n28.2 \n\n63.7\n\n42.0\n\n135.1 \n\n231.4 \n\n442.1\n\n635.0\n\n(9.5)\n\n(13.9)\n\n102.3 \n\n(62.2)\n\n(31.6) \n\n14.4\n\n13.7\n\n77.5\n\n8.4\n\n42.1\n\n29.0\n\n54.3\n\n15.3\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n23.4\n\n39.3\n\n11.4\n\n24.6\n\n15.5\n\n66.8\n\n6.6\n\n15.9\n\n23.8\n\n13.4\n\n8.8\n\n3.9\n\n16.8\n\n32.8\n\n8.7\n\n71.4 \n\n18.7 \n\n16.6 \n\n52.4 \n\n7.2 \n\n12.4 \n\n11.0 \n\n2.2 \n\n \n\n13.2 \n\n28.4 \n\n9.9 \n\n91.0\n\n32.5\n\n36.7\n\n121.6\n\n8.3\n\n21.1\n\n13.8\n\n1.7\n\n14.0\n\n26.3\n\n11.5\n\n12.1 \n\n10.9 \n\n8.1 \n\n9.3 \n\n9.9 \n\n3.0 \n\n \n\n14.3 \n\n30.2 \n\n8.6 \n\n22.0\n\n38.6\n\n43.6\n\n35.1\n\n70.5\n\n92.1\n\n11.1\n\n38.0\n\n17.3\n\n1.6\n\n14.2\n\n25.4\n\n15.8\n\n Reserve for Loan Loss \n\nMNT billion year-end \n\nPercentage of outstanding loan \n\n\u2013 = not available, GDP = gross domestic product, MNT = togrog, p.a. = per annum. \na Total capital as a percentage of total assets.  \nb Net profit as a percentage of total assets. \nSources: Bank of Mongolia and International Monetary Fund. \n \nB. \n\nNonbank Financial Institutions (NBFIs) \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\n10. \nIn  Mongolia,  the  term  NBFI  refers  to  a  licensee  under  the  Law  on  Nonbank  Financial \nActivities (2002). The activities covered under this law include lending, factoring, leasing, issuing \nguarantees, issuing payment instruments, electronic payments and remittance services, foreign \nexchange services, trust services, investment in short-term financial instruments, and advisory \nservices. NBFIs are not allowed to take deposits. The number, loans, and total assets of NBFIs \nhave grown rapidly since 2000, when Mongol Credit was established as the first licensed NBFI. \nOf the 114 NBFIs registered in 2004, 9 were foreign-owned or joint ventures. Most of the NBFIs \nprovide small consumer loans or short-term loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, and a \nhandful are engaged in other activities such as leasing and foreign exchange trading. NBFIs are \nincorporated  as  limited  liability  companies,  and  are  typically  owned  by  a  single  individual,  a \nfamily, or a small group of related individuals. With total assets of MNT28.7 billion, NBFIs as a \ngroup account for about 2.6% of banking sector assets.  \n \n\n \n\n\f  \n \n\n2. \n\nRegulation and Supervision \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n27\n\n11. \nThe  Law  on  Nonbank  Financial  Activities  provides  the  legal  basis  for  regulation  and \nsupervision  of  NBFIs.  It  authorizes  BOM  to  license  entities  to  carry  out  nonbank  financial \nactivities,  to  issue  regulations  and  procedures  and  to  supervise  and  monitor  the  activities  of \nNBFIs. Each NBFI is licensed for one or more activities, but there is no overall license to be an \nNBFI.  The  penalty  provisions  of  the  law  also  empower  BOM  to  confiscate  illegally  generated \nincome  and  impose  fines  5\u201320  times  the  minimum  salary  for  individuals  and  20\u201340  times  the \nminimum  salary  for  NBFIs  for  breaches  of  the  laws.  The  minimum  capital  requirements  for \nNBFIs  are  based  on  location:  the  minimum  capital  required  for  the  NBFIs  incorporated  in \nUlaanbaatar  is  MNT100  million,  for  NBFIs  in  Darkhan  and  Erdenet  MNT30  million,  and  for \nNBFIs in rural areas MNT10 million. NBFIs are subject to a five-class asset classification system \nand  provisioning  standards  similar  to  those  for  banks.  BOM  conducts  on-site  inspections  for \nNBFIs and issues specific orders or revokes license if serious breaches are found. In 2003, five \nNBFI  licenses  were  revoked.  BOM  has  about  10  member-staff  in  its  NBFI  division,  which  is \nresponsible for supervising NBFIs and savings and credit cooperatives (SCCs). \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Conditions and Operations \n\n12. \nCompared with other nonbank financial intermediaries in Mongolia, NBFIs under the Law \non Nonbank Financial Activities are well regulated and operate in a stable manner. The asset \nquality  and  earnings  of  the  entire  sector  appear  fair  and  the  NPL  ratio  has  declined  in  recent \nyears. While most of the smaller NBFIs are financed by equity, some large ones have significant \nloan  financing  and  accrued  interests.  Total  liabilities  in  the  sector  amount  to  30%  of  sector \nassets.  \n \n\nTable A1.2: Summary Statistics for Nonbank Financial Institutions \n\nUnit \n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n \nItem \n\n Assets \n\n  \n\n \n\n Liabilities \n Capital \n\n Nonbank Financial Institutions \n\nNumber \n\n Outstanding Loan \n\n Nonperforming Loan \n\nMNT billion, year-end \n\nMNT billion, year-end \n\nPercentage of GDP \n\nMNT billion, year-end \n\nPercentage of outstanding loan \n\nMNT billion, year-end \nMNT billion, year-end \n\n7\n\n3.0\n\n0.3\n\n1.5\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n28\n\n23.4\n\n2.1\n\n13.2\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n3.1\n\n20.3\n\n2002a \n66 \n\n12.5 \n\n1.0 \n\n6.3 \n0.4 \n\n6.7 \n\n3.9 \n\n8.6 \n\n97\n\n18.9\n\n1.4\n\n11.8\n0.8\n\n6.5\n\n5.2\n\n13.7\n\n114\n\n28.7\n\n1.6\n\n16.9\n0.8\n\n4.5\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013 \n\n Net Income \n\u2013 = not available, GDP = gross domestic product, MNT = togrog. \na  Chinggis  Khan,  the  largest  NBFI,  obtained  a  banking  license  in  2002,  and  therefore  was  not  included  in  the \n\nMNT billion, year-end \n\n0.6 \n\n1.1\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nsubsequent data. \n\nSource: Bank of Mongolia. \n \nC. \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\nSavings and Credit Cooperatives (SCCs) \n\n13. \nSCCs  are  established  under  the  Law  on  Cooperatives  and  provide  saving  and  lending \nservices to members. Mongolia has seen a dramatic increase in the number of SCCs in the last \nseveral  years.  In  March  2004,  of  570  registered  SCCs,  only  282  were  found  to  be  operating. \nThe  total  assets  of  the  SCCs  nearly  tripled  from  the  end  of  2002,  and  amounted  to  MNT47.1 \nbillion in March 2004. SCC assets are about 6% of the total banking sector assets. The amount \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\n  Appendix 1 \n\nof  loans  and  deposits  held  by  the  282  SCCs  were  MNT33.9  billion  and  MNT38.4  billion, \nrespectively.  SCCs  have  a  total  of  22,200  members.  The  size  of  the  SCC  sector  may  be \nsignificantly  larger  since  many  SCCs  that  were  not  inspected  may  be  in  operation.  SCC \nactivities are concentrated in Ulaanbaatar where 166 SCCs with total assets of MNT44.6 billion \nand 15,400 members are located. The sector is highly concentrated, with the 14 largest SCCs \naccounting for 76.2% of total assets.  \n \n\n2. \n\nRegulation and Supervision \n\nSCCs  are  governed  by  the  Law  on  Cooperatives,  which  also  governs  agriculture, \n14. \nmanufacturing,  and  consumer  cooperatives.  The  law  does  not  provide  adequate  basis  to \nregulate  deposit-taking  and  lending  activities  of  cooperatives.  Although  the  law  sets  out  the \nlimitations  on  SCCs\u2019  activities,  rights,  and  obligations  of  members,  and  obligations  of \nmanagement and other governance requirements, it does not assign any government agency to \nsupervise  the  activities  of  SCCs  and  monitor  their  compliance  with  the  law.  SCCs  that  take \ndeposits and make loans are not required to obtain a license from a regulator, though SCCs are \nregistered with the General Department of National Taxation (GDNT). While the amendments to \nthe  law  in  2002  provided  for  prudential  standards  for  SCCs  issued  by  BOM,  the  law  does  not \nprovide BOM with powers to effectively supervise SCCs, such as on-site inspections, reporting \nrequirements, suspension of business, and revocation of registration.  \n \nAn SCC interim supervision unit was established under GDNT to supervise SCCs from \n15. \nJune  2003  to  June  2004.  In  accordance  with  a  parliament  resolution,  GDNT  and  BOM  jointly \nconducted inspections of all the active SCCs for the first time during the first quarter of 2004. In \nApril 2004, SCC supervision was transferred to BOM, also on an interim basis. Although BOM is \ndesignated as the supervisor of SCCs, no BOM staff member is specifically tasked to supervise \nSCCs full-time. The interim supervisory assignment with limited legal power and staff resources \nmakes it difficult for BOM to take on the full responsibility of supervising SCCs. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Conditions and Operations \n\n16. \nThe  joint  inspections  of  SCCs  by  GDNT  and  BOM  uncovered  many  serious  problems. \nAlthough  SCCs  are  allowed  to  take  deposits  only  from  the  members,  many  SCCs  are  taking \ndeposits  from  the  public  and  therefore  operating  as  banks.  Most  SCCs  are  found  to  be \nimproperly  recruiting  members4  and  exceeding  BOM\u2019s  loan  limit  to  a  single  borrower.  The \ndeposit interest rate was 1.85\u20134.00% per month, far higher than that of commercial banks, and \nlending interest rates were 2.7\u20138.0% per month. About half of the registered SCCs (288 out of \n570) were reported to be either inactive, liquidated, or could not be located by the authorities. \nSome  SCCs  were  found  to  be  collecting  deposits  to  finance  election  campaigns  of  politicians \nand some are believed to be pyramiding schemes. \n \nD. \n\nMongolian Stock Exchange (MSE) \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\n17.  MSE  is  the  only  licensed  stock  exchange  in  Mongolia.  It  was  established  in  1991  to \nimplement  the  Government\u2019s  privatization  policy.  During  1992\u20131995,  the  shares  of  475  state-\nowned  enterprises  (SOEs)  worth  MNT8.2  billion  were  sold  through  MSE.  Secondary  market \n\n                                                 \n4  The  membership  fee  is  normally  as  low  as  MNT500\u20131,000.  Ordinary  members  are  not  provided  opportunities  to \noversee  the  activities  and  financial  conditions  of  savings  and  credit  cooperatives  (SCCs)  and  to  elect  the \nmanagement  in  accordance  with  the  law.  Therefore,  recruiting  members  is  not  different  from  taking  deposit  from \nthe public. Thirty-one SCCs were found to be taking deposits from non-members. \n\n \n\n\f  \n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n29\n\ntrading started in 1995. The number of listed companies has declined from 458 in 1996 to 395 in \n2004  because  many  listed  companies  were  transformed  into  limited  liability  companies,  while \nthe number of newly listed companies is very small. About 70 of the 395 listed companies are \nfully or partially owned by the state. In 2004, market capitalization was MNT29.8 billion, or about \n1.4%  of  GDP  and  annual  trading  value  was  MNT654  million.  Annual  trading  value  at  MSE \ndeclined  from  MNT12.2  billion  in  1997  to  MNT654  million  in  2004.  Confidence  in  the  equity \nmarket was seriously undermined in the late 1990s, when over 300,000 investors lost close to \nMNT1 billion because of the collapse of the two custodian banks holding clearing funds of equity \ninvestors. After negotiated transactions between buyers and sellers outside MSE were allowed \nsince 1998, such transactions became widespread and resulted in the concentration of shares \nin  fewer  shareholders.  As  a  result,  by  the  beginning  of  2004,  only  1,300  companies  and \nindividuals had accumulated 96% of the shares of all listed companies. However, MSE has not \nbeen  used  to  raise  new  equity  capital  by  private  companies  or  financial  institutions.  All  the \ncompanies newly listed in the past 3 years were SOEs.  \n \n18. \nGovernment  bonds  and  corporate  bonds  are  also  traded  at  MSE.  Total  trade  value  of \nbonds  in  2004  was  MNT15.3  billion,  of  which  81.8%  were  Government  bonds  and  18.2% \ncorporate  bonds.  Government  bonds  were  first  issued  at  MSE  in  1996.  Since  2000,  the \nGovernment  has  been  issuing  bonds  worth  more  than  MNT10  billion  annually.  The  first \ncorporate  bonds  were  issued  at  MSE  in  2001  and  there  were  eight  issuances  of  corporate \nbonds by the end of 2004. Nearly all of the government bonds and corporate bonds are bought \nby banks and held to maturity, and there is virtually no secondary market trading. The maturity \nof  government  bonds  typically  ranges  from  1  to  8  months  and  the  longest  maturity  of \ngovernment bonds ever issued was two years. \n \n\n2. \n\nRegulation and Supervision \n\n19. \nThe  Law  on  Securities  Market  (2002)  replaced  the  1995  law.  It  provides  for  the \nMongolian  Securities  Exchange  Commission  (MSEC)  to  supervise  the  securities  markets \nactivities,  including  licensing,  regulating,  supervising  stock  exchanges  and  clearing  and \ndepository  systems,  issuing  regulations  on  securities  market  transactions,  and  monitoring  the \ncompliance of market participants. However, the law does not empower MSEC to designate and \nsupervise  self-regulatory  organizations.  MSEC  has  about  20  staff  members  to  supervise  the \nsecurities  markets  and  intermediaries.  The  capacity  of  MSEC,  such  as  external  audit  and  on-\nsite  and  off-site  inspection  functions,  has  been  upgraded  through  training  and  investment  in \ncomputer  information  systems.  However,  there  is  no  staff  or  office  dedicated  to  perform \nspecialized  technical  duties  of  accountant,  legal  officer,  and  economist,  and  there  is  no \nspecialized  enforcement  department,  which  normally  is  one  of  the  most  important  activities  of \nsecurities regulators. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Conditions and Operations \n\n20. \nIn 2003, MSE was divided into two separate legal entities: MSE and Securities Clearing \nHouse and Central Depository. The separation of the trading and listing functions of MSE from \nits  securities  clearing  and  depository  systems  was  aimed  at  improving  transparency  and \naccountability.  MSE  is  organized  as  a  government-owned  profit-making  joint  stock  company. \nThe  shares  of  MSE  were  listed  on  the  stock  exchange  in  2003.  However,  the  shares  are  not \ntraded since MSE is 100% government-owned. MSE continues of operate as a traditional SOE \nwith six government representatives on the board, including MSEC, and only one private sector \nrepresentative from a broker/dealer company. \n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n \n\n  Appendix 1 \n\n21.  MSE  has  issued  regulations  on  listing  of  securities;  these  include  listing  standards, \nclassifications of securities, and surveillance and examination of listed securities. Listing criteria \ninclude market capitalization, the number of shareholders, the activities of year conducted, and \nasset yield. The securities that meet the listing requirements are assigned to the high section, \nand others are assigned to the low section. The high section is divided into three classes (A, B, \nand C), based on the ranking of companies in the above criteria. Currently, only 21 companies \nare assigned to the high section. The shares of a company can be de-listed if the company is \nliquidated,  merged  with  another  company,  or  reorganized  as  a  limited  liability  company. \nHowever, the shares of companies that do not meet the listing standards are not de-listed. The \nvast majority of listed companies do not comply with basic requirements normally expected of a \nlisted  company\u2014i.e.,  holding  annual  meeting,  filing  audited  financial  statements,  disclosing \nimportant events to shareholders. \n \nThe financial condition of MSE has deteriorated because of the decline in trade value of \n22. \ncorporate shares and government bonds. The revenues from securities transaction commission \nhave declined from MNT223 million in 2002 to MNT30 million in 2004, and the net profit/loss of \nMSE deteriorated from a profit of MNT59 million in 2002 to a loss of MNT116 million in 2004.  \n \n\nTable A1.3: Summary Statistics for Securities Market \n\nUnit \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n \nItem \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n Government Bond Trading Volume  MNT billion \n  \n\nPercentage of GDP \n\n Corporate Bond Trading Volume \n\n Stock Market Capitalization \n\nMNT billion \nPercentage of GDP \n\nMNT billion, year-end \n\n$ million, year-end \n\nPercentage of GDP \n\n Stock Trading Volume at MSE \n\nMNT billion \n\n Companies Listed at MSE \n\n Newly Listed \n\n$ million \nNumber \n\nNumber \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n34.4 \n\n32.1 \n\n3.7 \n\n3.3 \n\n3.1 \n\n11.1 \n\n30.8 \n\n41.7 \n\n21.7 \n\n   12.5 \n\n1.1 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n40.5 \n\n36.9 \n\n4.0 \n\n3.0 \n\n2.7 \n\n2.8 \n\n1.2 \n\n0.1 \n\n41.3 \n\n37.5 \n\n3.7 \n\n1.7 \n\n1.6 \n\n3.4 \n\n3.0 \n\n0.2 \n\n35.8 \n\n31.9 \n\n2.9 \n\n1.4 \n\n1.2 \n\n1.6 \n\n     0.7 \n\n2.7 \n\n     2.8 \n\n0.2 \n\n     0.2 \n\n49.5 \n\n   29.8 \n\n42.4 \n\n   24.7 \n\n3.6 \n\n     1.4 \n\n0.9 \n\n     0.7 \n\n0.8 \n\n     0.5 \n\n418 \n\n411 \n\n401 \n\n403 \n\n402 \n\n   395 \n\n1 \n\n5 \n\n0 \n\n8 \n\n12 \n\n       4 \n\n Delisted \n Net Profit/Loss of MSE \n\u2013 = not available, GDP = gross domestic product, MNT = togrog, MSE = Mongolian Stock Exchange. \nSource: Mongolian Stock Exchange. \n \nE. \n\nSecurities Markets Intermediaries \n\nNumber \nMNT million \n\n12 \n   \u2013  \n\n10 \n\u2013  \n\n13 \n\u2013  \n\n6 \n58.9 \n\n13 \n     11 \n0.1  (116.2) \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\n23.  Mongolia has 25 licensed securities broker/dealer companies. The number has dropped \nfrom 42 in 2000 as a result of rapid decline in trading activity and increase in minimum capital \nrequirement  (increased  from  MNT10  million  to  MNT50  million  in  January  2003).  Of  the  25 \nbroker/dealer companies, two have foreign participation. The sector is highly concentrated with \nthe two largest companies, accounting for 51%, and the five largest companies, accounting for \n70%  of  the  total  purchases  and  sales  of  shares  executed  on  MSE  in  2004.  Many  of  the \nsecurities  companies  are  in  Ulaanbaatar,  and rural  areas are  largely not  served by  any  of  the \nsecurities  brokers.  Although  there  were  17  investment  funds  in  2000,  all  of  the  licenses  have \nbeen withdrawn or revoked and there are currently no licensed investment funds. There are also \nno licensed underwriters. However, in 2004, one special underwriting license was granted to a \nbank for underwriting a specific issuance of corporate bonds at MSE. \n\n \n\n\f  \n \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n31\n\n2. \n\nRegulation and Supervision \n\n24. \nThe  Law  on  Securities  Market  provides  for  MSEC  to  regulate  and  supervise  securities \nmarkets intermediaries, including licensing, monitoring, and penalizing them for breaches of the \nlaw.  MSEC  sets  requirements  regarding  the  qualification  of  the  governing  person  of  securities \nmarkets intermediaries. However, the law does not set or authorize MSEC to set such \u201cfit and \nproper\u201d requirements for securities markets intermediaries and securities issuers. Although the \nLaw on Securities Market provides the framework for licensing and regulating investment funds \nand funds management companies, the framework is weak particularly in terms of segregation \nand  protection  of  fund  assets  and  the  governance  obligations  of  the  governing  persons  of \ninvestment companies and funds management companies. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Conditions and Operations \n\n25.  Most  of  the  securities  companies  are  small  and  lack  capacity.  In  2004,  19  of  the  25 \nbroker/dealer  companies  executed  stock  purchases  and  sales  of  less  than  MNT50  million \n(minimum capital requirement for a broker/dealer company) and 8 companies less than MNT10 \nmillion. Most of the brokers rely on income from sales of the government bonds through MSE \nand  business  activities  unrelated  to  the  securities  business.  Most  brokers  are  not  engaged  in \nthe securities business on a full time basis. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some securities \nbrokers are trading their customers\u2019 securities without consent of the customers. \n \nF. \n\nInsurance Companies \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\n26. \nUntil  1991,  there  was  only  one  state-owned  insurance  company  operating\u2014Mongol \nDaatgal. In 1991, another state-owned insurance company, Tushig Daatgal, was established to \nspecialize in agriculture. The first private insurance company, Ard Daatgal, was established in \n1994. Since then, the insurance sector has grown rapidly. The number of insurance companies \nhas  increased  to  23  in  2004,  and  both  former  state-owned  insurance  companies  have  been \nprivatized.  The  amount  of  premiums  collected  by  insurance  companies  has  increased  from \nMNT3.0 billion in 1998 to MNT6.3 billion in 2003. Nevertheless, the sector remains  small with \ntotal insurance premium amounting to only 0.5% of GDP. The sector is highly concentrated with \nMongol Daatgal accounting for 74% of total insurance sector premiums in 2003. Aircraft related \n(hull and liability) insurance comprises the largest category of insurance and accounted for 40% \nof the industry. The only class of mandatory insurance is motor vehicle liability, accounting for \n8%  of  total  industry  premium.  Combined  with  property  insurance  for  motor  vehicle,  motor \nvehicle  related  insurance  accounted  for  20%  of  the  industry.  Property  casualty  insurance \naccounted for 15% and the personal accident, disability, and travel insurance in total accounted \nfor about 10%. Mongolian insurance companies do not offer life insurance products. \n \n\n2. \n\nRegulation and Supervision \n\n27.  Mongolia\u2019s  first  Law  on  Insurance  was  enacted  in  1998.  This  law  provided  for  the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) to license insurance companies and issue regulations. However, the \nlaw designated another agency\u2014Insurance Supervisory Unit (ISU) under the State Agency for \nProfessional Inspectors\u2014to make recommendations to MOF regarding license applications and \nsupervise insurance companies\u2019 compliance with laws and the terms of their licenses. The new \ninsurance  laws  (Law  on  Insurance  and  Law  on  Licensing  and  Supervision  of  Insurance \nIntermediaries), prepared with Asian Development Bank (ADB) support, were enacted in 2004. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\n \n\n  Appendix 1 \n\nThe  new  laws  designate  the  to-be-established  nonbank  regulatory  agency  to  supervise  the \nsector,  including  through  licensing,  compliance  monitoring,  investigations,  enforcement,  and \nissuing  regulations.  ISU  has  only  seven  staff  members,  none  of  whom  have  specialized \nexpertise in insurance.  \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Conditions and Operations \n\n28. \nThere are 23 insurance companies in a market of only MNT6.3 billion, with one dominant \ncompany  accounting  for  74%.  Since  most  insurance  companies  are  small,  they  are  especially \nvulnerable to shocks from large claims. Two insurance companies have gone bankrupt during \nthe past 18 months. The amount of insurance premium paid by an individual for a motor vehicle \nliability insurance or a personal accident insurance is typically as low as $2\u20133 equivalent. It is \nunlikely  that  the  cost  of  a  traffic  accident  can  be  covered  by  insurance  claim  payments  under \nsuch a low level of insurance premiums. \n \n29. \nThe  payout  ratio  (claims  paid  as  a  percentage  of  total  premiums  collected)  is  low  at \nabout 20%. The low payout ratio is largely due to the reluctance of some insurers to pay claims \nowed to policy holders. In 2003, only two insurance companies recorded a payout ratio higher \nthan  25%  (102%  and  44%),  one  of  which  went  bankrupt.  The  total  operating  expense  of  the \nentire  sector  was  MNT2.1  billion  (57%  of  the  net  premium  income,  i.e.,  insurance  premium \ncollected  minus  reinsurance  premium  paid).  Seven  of  the  21  companies  made  losses  in  2003 \nand the net profit/loss after tax of the entire sector was negative in 2003.  \n \n\nTable A1.4: Summary Statistics for the Insurance Sector

The  financial  sector  also  directly  helps  to  reduce \npoverty. By increasing access to credit, an efficient financial sector enables the poor to engage in income-generating \nactivities.  By  increasing  access  to  savings  and  insurance  products,  an  a  broad-based  financial  system  also  helps \nsafeguard the poor and the vulnerable segments of the population from negative shocks to their incomes and enables \nthem to meet unanticipated expenditure needs.  \n \nLow-income households are most vulnerable to the loss of savings from banking crises. The poor are also especially \nvulnerable to the adverse consequences of financial crises such as job loss caused by increased bankruptcies, as well \nas higher taxes and inflation and lower social expenditures. A well-governed financial sector reduces the likelihood \nand severity of financial crises, and provides safeguard against a corresponding increase in poverty incidence.  \n \nThe  country  strategy  and  program  for  Mongolia  identifies  underdevelopment  of  the  financial  sector  as  a  cause  of \npoverty.  The  cost  of  borrowing  in  Mongolia  is  high,  and  financial  outreach  is  limited.  Bank  lending  is  predominantly \ncollateral-based,  and  low-income  households  are  particularly  affected  by  the  high  cost  of  collateral  registration.  The \nlack  of  long-term  funds  limits  investment  and  constrains  economic  growth.  There  are  few  savings  instruments  and \ninsurance products. Poor governance practices undermine the stability of the financial system and investor protection. \nAddressing  these  weaknesses  to  develop  an  efficient,  well-balanced,  and  well-governed  financial  system  will  be \ncrucial for reducing the cost of borrowing, increasing investment, and creating jobs.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nIn 2003, the Government finalized a national poverty reduction strategy in the form of the Economic Growth Support \nand Poverty Reduction Strategy, from which the new Government derived a new law outlining the National Action Plan \nfor  2004\u20132008.  Two  components  are  particularly  prominent  in  the  Government\u2019s  strategy:  higher,  stable  private \nsector-led growth aimed at improving living standards and reducing income disparities; and social development aimed \nat  improving  income  opportunities  and  the  quality  of  public  services  and  accessibility  for  the  poor.  The  strategy \noutlines  financial  sector  priorities  to  support  growth,  including  the  development  of  long-term  lending  and  diverse \nfinancial  services,  lower  interest  rates,  and  wider  access  to  credit.  Toward  its  social  development  goal,  the \nGovernment  intends  to  create  jobs  and  income  opportunities  through  investment  in  education  and  private  sector \ndevelopment.  The  Financial  Regulation  and  Governance  Program  (FRGP)  is  fully  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s \nmedium-term objective of promoting private sector-led growth. \n \nThe  FRGP  supports  the  strengthening  of  corporate  governance  in  banks  and  the  improvement  of  the  collateral \nframework.  Poor  governance  in  banks  could  undermine  depositor  protection,  and  jeopardize  the  savings  of  low-\nincome households. By introducing legal and regulatory measures to improve internal controls in commercial banks, \nthe FRGP will contribute toward mitigating such risks and ensuring depositor protection. By lowering the (perceived) \nrisk  of  lending  and  the  cost  of  collateral  registration,  improved  collateral  framework  will  help  reduce  the  cost  of \nborrowing and facilitate access to credit by the poor. \n \nThe  FRGP  supports  the  development  of  the  nonbank  financial  sector,  including  capital  markets,  insurance  sector, \nnonbank  financial  institutions  (NBFIs)  and  savings  and  credit  cooperatives  (SCCs).  The  FRGP  will  promote  capital \nmarket  development  by  strengthening  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  and  strengthening  governance  and \ndisclosure to protect investors. Capital market development will support long-term economic growth and employment \ncreation by facilitating resource mobilization and investment. Further, capital market development  will help lower the \ncost of borrowing by creating alternatives to bank loans. This will improve the poor\u2019s access to credit. \n \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n67 \n\nThe FRGP also includes measures to strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for the insurance sector. This will \ncontribute to mitigating solvency risks of insurance companies, ensuring payment of claims due, diversifying insurance \nproducts, and thereby mitigating the impact catastrophic events that could destroy economic opportunities of the poor.  \nNBFIs and SCCs typically provide small loans and other financial services to households and employment-generating \nsmall-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs).  The  sound  and  orderly  development  of  this  sector  under  adequate \nsupervision will improve access to financial services, and enable SMEs to grow and create more employment. \nC.  Participation Process \n\n Yes \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nExtensive consultations with stakeholders \u2013 including regulators, government ministries, members of parliament, \nfinancial institutions and other private sector participants \u2013 have been conducted during program preparation. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nEffective participation among relevant government bodies and stakeholders will be facilitated through the \nestablishment of appropriate working groups and committees. \nD.
