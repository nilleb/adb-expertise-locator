THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nresults-based loan to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Supporting Fourth Primary \nEducation Development Program. \n \n2.  The Fourth Primary Education Development Program (the program) is the government\u2019s \nflagship  initiative  in  the  education  sector  for  FY2019\u2013FY2023.  It  aims  to  provide  quality \neducation  to  all  children  from  pre-primary  to  grade  5  through  an  efficient,  inclusive,  and \nequitable  education  system.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  joint  financing \ndevelopment partners will support the government\u2019s priorities of improving quality and equity of \nprimary education through a sector-wide approach (SWAp).1 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n  \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  Bangladesh has achieved remarkable socioeconomic development. Poverty has halved \nsince 2000 (now 24.3%).2 Real gross domestic product has grown at 6.2% annually since \nFY2007.3 The country reached lower middle-income status in 2015.4 Improvements in education \nwere a key contributor to the success. The number of educated youth has risen significantly, \nand the literacy rate for young people aged 15\u201324 years increased from 61.9% in 2007 to \n92.2% in 2016.5 \n \n4.  Rapid  expansion  of  primary  education  has  been  at  the  heart  of  the  country\u2019s \ndevelopment. Bangladesh achieved considerable progress toward universal primary education, \nwith a net enrollment rate of 98% by 2016. The country was one of the few nations that had \nachieved gender parity up to secondary education by 2005. Nearly all primary schools now offer \npre-primary education.6 The efficiency of the primary education system also improved. The \nrepetition  rate  declined  from  10.5%  (2005)  to  6.1%  (2016);  and  eight  out  of  10  students \ngraduated in 2016 while only five graduated in 2005.7 Access to school by children from low \nincome families has improved significantly.8 \n \n5.  Despite significant progress in access, Bangladesh still needs to improve quality and \nequity of primary education. The 2015 national student assessment indicated low learning \noutcomes. Only 65% of students in grade 3 grasp grade-level competency for Bangla, while \n39% do so for math; and even fewer achieve it in grade 5 (23% for Bangla and 10% for math). \nMany school-age children are out of school (2.5 million or 11% of the 8\u201314 age group); this is \n                                                \n1  ADB provided a technical assistance grant of $800,000 from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for project \npreparation.

The difference in primary net attendance rates between the poorest and richest quintiles narrowed from \n22% in 2005 to 8% in 2014. \n ", "2 \nmore  prevalent  in  poor  families  and  in  disadvantaged  locations  such  as  urban  slums.9 \nDisparities in school access and participation remain substantial in the wetlands (haor), river \nislands  (char),  coastal  zone,  and  northern  districts.  Low  learning  outcomes  and  persisting \ndisparities slow down and even prevent children from climbing up the educational ladder and \neventually participating effectively in the labor force. \n \n6.   The government is committed to education for all and to the Sustainable Development \nGoal (SDG) 4. Vision 2021 and the Seventh Five-Year Plan (FY2016\u2013FY2020) highlight human \ncapital development as a key driver for inclusive growth and identify improving education quality \nas the most critical challenge. The National Education Policy charts a reform path for systematic \nupgrades of the education sector.10 The government is launching the Fourth Primary Education \nDevelopment Program with a considerable increase in its budget allocation, aimed at improving \nquality and equity of primary education, with joint support from development partners. \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n7.  Bangladesh has one of the largest primary education systems in the world, with more \nthan 18 million children enrolled in more than 120,000 schools. It covers 1-year free pre-primary \neducation and 5-year free compulsory primary education. The system is largely centralized. \nLocal capacity for education management is still limited. Despite a series of investments, the \nsystem has not been able to match the rapid increase in student enrollment. A large share of \nschools (77.4%) are running double shifts and thus limit teacher\u2013student contact hours, which \nresults in low learning outcomes.11 The expected increase of student intake in coming years \nimposes further pressure to add  classrooms and teachers. Teachers mostly focus on rote \nlearning and lack adequate skills. Examination and assessment systems are short of capacity \nand  feedback  mechanisms.  A  shortage  of  teaching  and  learning  material  limits  effective \nknowledge transfer. Moreover, frequent disasters triggered by natural hazards curtail student \nattendance in affected schools. It is also imperative to improve school-specific quality and \nparticipation indicators through community involvement. \n \n8.  The  proposed  results-based  lending  (RBL)  program  supports  the  government\u2019s \ninitiatives to tackle these challenges and lift the overall performance of the primary education \nsystem.  It  builds  on  the  joint  experience  of  government  and  development  partners.  The \ngovernment has implemented three phases of comprehensive primary education development \nprogram, supported by development partners including ADB.12 The first two phases rolled out \n                                                \n9  The number is based on Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics projections and Education Household Survey (2014) \ndata. Poverty was indicated as the main reason for about 40% of children never being at school or dropping out. \n10 Government of Bangladesh, National Planning Commission. 2012.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nthe  compulsory  primary  education  scheme, remarkably  increased  enrollment  and  achieved \ngender parity in access. The Third Primary Education Development Project (PEDP3) supporting \nthe government\u2019s third phase program, undertook measures to further expand primary and pre-\nprimary  education,  improve  teacher  qualifications,  trigger  competency-based  learning,  and \nbolster  school-level  management.13  Lessons  from  the  PEDP3  highlight  that  (i) teacher \ndevelopment should be more systematic and needs-based to improve teacher proficiencies and \n(ii) monitoring should provide timely feedback at all levels to better inform education planning \nand management. The RBL program will address these aspects. In addition, it will help (i) revise \nthe curriculum and enrich learning resources, e.g., through information and communication \ntechnology (ICT); (ii) recruit and deploy more teachers; (iii) establish a primary education board \nto lead reforms on examinations and assessments; (iv) build more classrooms in line with \ndisaster-resilience requirements; (v) scale up the education service for out-of-school children \n(OOSC); and (vi) strengthen the autonomy and capacity of schools and upazilas (sub-districts) \nwith performance-linked incentives. It will mainstream gender equality and social inclusion, \nmonitored with data disaggregated by sex and social categories. \n \n9.  The RBL program is a step forward from the PEDP3, which adopted the disbursement-\nlinked indicator (DLI) approach.14 The RBL is the most suitable modality because (i) the large \nnational program requires strong focus on results (as opposed to inputs); (ii) the government \nhas strong leadership and commitment; (iii) key implementing agencies have demonstrated \nresults-based  management  capacity;  (iv)  government  systems  have  been  used  since  the \nPEDP3  (through  treasury  model,  and  for  national  procurement  of  goods  and  works);  and \n(v) development partners have agreed on results-based financing with a single common DLI \nmatrix,  to  harmonize  support  and  reduce  the  administrative  burden.15  The  RBL  program \nincorporates well the recommendations from ADB evaluation of the previous RBL programs.16 \nThese  include  (i)  deepening  client\u2019s  institution  building  through  the  DLIs,  (ii)  ensuring  the \nselectivity  of  program  actions  to  facilitate  monitoring,  (iii)  strengthening  monitoring  and \nevaluation (M&E) system and capacity, and (iv) using an independent verification agency (IVA). \nADB\u2019s  due  diligence  assessments,  carried  out  in  coordination  with  other  joint  financing \ndevelopment  partners,  provide  reasonable  assurance  for  effective  achievement  of  results \nthrough RBL with measures to strengthen program systems. \n \n10.  ADB value addition. ADB has been supporting Bangladesh\u2019s education sector in a \nsystematic way, and the RBL program will build on it. ADB lending will provide much-needed \nfinance for more investments to improve the quality and equity of primary education. It will add \nvalue through key initiatives, such as reducing double-shift operations at schools, stepping up \nteacher education and examination reform, enriching teaching and learning resources, and \nimproving school-level management and institution building. In coordination with other joint \nfinancing development partners, ADB will provide technical assistance (TA) by supplementary \n                                                \n13 The PEDP3 (i) improved the learning environment by hiring 95,400 teachers and building 39,000 classrooms; (ii) \nraised teacher qualification at entry (now nearly 60% of primary school teachers have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree); \n(iii) introduced the Diploma in Primary Education program for newly recruited teachers prior to service; (iv) adopted \na competency-based curriculum and provided free textbooks on time; (v) improved the relevance of primary \neducation completion examination by attaching competency-based test items; (vi) piloted second-chance education \nfor out-of-school children; and (vii) extended the school level improvement plan to all schools.  \n14 In the PEDP3, ADB\u2019s financing was 50% allocated to the DLIs and 50% based on statements of expenditures, and \nthe World Bank\u2019s financing was 100% on the DLIs. \n15 The World Bank uses the program-for-results modality for the proposed program. \n16 ADB.  2016.

The RBL program is \naligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for Bangladesh\u2014under pillar 2 for \nimproving human capital\u2014and included in the country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020.18 It \nwill directly contribute to the government\u2019s commitment to SDG in education (SDG 4), especially \non improving learning outcomes (SDG 4.1) and reducing disparities (SDG 4.5). \n \nC.  Program Scope \n \n11.  The  Fourth  Primary  Education  Development  Program  aims  to  improve  the  quality, \nequity, efficiency, and inclusiveness of primary education. The RBL program will support the \ngovernment\u2019s initiatives. The outcome and the outputs of the RBL program are almost the same \nas those of the Fourth Primary Education Development Program, except for certain activities as \nset out in Table 1. Hence, the scope and the cost of the RBL program are slightly adjusted. The \nuse of the SWAp for the program enables ADB\u2019s RBL to leverage the entire proposed program \nbudget for greater efficiency and effectiveness. \n \nTable 1: Program Scope \nItem  Broader Government Program  Results-Based Lending Program \nOutcome  Quality education to all children from pre-primary  Quality and equity of primary \n  to grade 5 through an efficient, inclusive, and  education improved for all children \nequitable education system  from pre-primary to grade 5 \n Key outputs and   (i)  quality (curriculum reforms; textbooks and  Coverage is the same as the \nactivity types  teaching\u2013learning materials; teacher  government program, with the \nrecruitment, deployment, and advancement;  following exclusions:a \nteacher education; CPD; ICT in education;  (i)  production (printing) of textbooks; \nassessments and examinations; pre-primary  (ii)  ICT equipment and accessories, \neducation);  furniture, motor vehicles, and \n(ii)  equitable access and participation (needs- land acquisition;  \nbased infrastructure, including WASH  (iii) pensions and/or gratuities;  \nfacilities; out-of-school children; special  (iv) unadjusted advances or loans; \neducation needs; education in emergencies;  (v)  any civil works other than \ncommunication and social mobilization); and  additional classrooms, WASH \n(iii) management, governance, and financing  and other facilities at schools; \n(data systems for decision-making,  and  \ninstitutional strengthening, SLIPs and UPEPs,  (vi) procurement of goods that \nstrengthened budget and fiduciary system).  require international procurement.b \nProgram expenditure $15.1 billion (estimate)c  $14.7 billion (estimate)\n   \nMain financiers  Government, ADB, EU, UNICEF, and World Bank  Samee \nin pooled fundd \nGeographic coverage  Nationwide  Same \nImplementation period  FY2019\u2013FY2023  Same \nADB = Asian Development Bank; CPD = continuous professional development; EU = European Union; ICT = information \nand communication technology; SLIP = school level improvement plan; SWAp = sector-wide approach; UNICEF = United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund; UPEP = upazila primary education plan; WASH = water, sanitation, and hygiene. \na  ADB\u2019s results-based lending (RBL) policy excludes activities that would involve procurement of works, goods, and \nservices under contracts whose estimated value exceeds specified monetary amounts (high-value contracts).

The RBL program\u2019s impact will be strengthened human capital formation. The outcome \nwill be improved quality and equity of primary education for all children from pre-primary to \ngrade 5 (DLI A  and  DLI B). It is expected to directly benefit 18.6 million students; and also \naround 340,000 teachers and more than 65,000 schools that are under the management of the \nMinistry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME). The outputs are: \n \n13.  Output 1: Quality of primary education improved. This output aims to apply quality \nteaching\u2013learning practices in all schools to enable children to acquire the essential grade-level \ncompetencies. The government will update curricula and textbooks, and develop teaching\u2013\nlearning materials (including selected supplementary reading materials) for all grades (DLI 1). It \nwill include updating and expanding the use of ICT and e-resources for teaching and learning \n(program action plan [PAP] 1.6.1). Additional teachers will be recruited and deployed for more \nschools to reach the standard pupil\u2013teacher ratio (DLI 2, PAP 1.2). The existing in-service \ntraining for teachers and teacher educators will be transformed into a continuous professional \ndevelopment (CPD) program to improve teachers\u2019 proficiencies in driving competency-based \nlearning (DLI 3, PAP 1.6). The Diploma in Primary Education (DPEd) program will be updated \nwith stronger quality assurance (DLI 3). Primary teachers training institutes will gain greater \ntraining capacities to deliver the DPEd program (DLI 3). To refresh the subsector\u2019s examination \nand assessment system, a primary education board will be established to (i) strengthen school-\nbased examinations for timely measurement of and feedback on student learning outcomes and \n(ii) reform primary education completion examination to focus more on knowledge application or \ncompetency.  This  output  will  also  include  implementing  an  updated  national  student \nassessment (DLI 4) by aligning it with the revised curriculum, drawing on international good \npractices, and providing evidence-based recommendations for education reform. \n \n14.  Output 2: Access and participation to primary education enhanced. This output will \nfurther  improve  the  learning  environment  and  scale  up  education  services  to  underserved \nchildren.  It  will  include  building  more  classrooms  conforming  to  the  infrastructure  planning \nstandard  and  turn  more  schools  into  single-shift  operations  (DLI  5).  Gender-segregated \nsanitation facilities and safe water sources will be provided in almost all schools (DLI 5), which \nwill  increase  parents\u2019  willingness  to  send  children  to  school.  New  construction  and  major \nretrofitting will meet disaster risk resilience requirements (PAP 1.7) for the safety and continuity \nof primary education, especially in disaster-prone areas.

The ADB loan will be disbursed over 5 years, based on \nthe  verification  of  achievement  of  the  DLIs.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s general account. The government will ensure that total eligible expenditures are \nequal  to  or  exceed  the  total  amount  of  disbursement  from  ADB  and  other  joint  financing \ndevelopment partners during the program period. ADB will provide financing for prior results \n($60 million), expected to be achieved by loan effectiveness. The MOPME, through the Ministry \nof Finance (MOF), will submit withdrawal applications semiannually or annually (as applicable), \nalong with evidence of achievement of the DLIs verified by the IVA and unaudited interim \nfinancial statements for the period concerned. Partial disbursements are allowed for DLIs A, B, \n2, 5, 6, 7, and 9 as described in the verification protocol. Except for those DLIs that cannot be \nrolled over (as described in the verification protocol), any amount not disbursed for an unmet \nDLI  will  be  disbursed  once  it  is  achieved.

Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n21.  The RBL program will strengthen capacities in the primary education subsector at all \nlevels, particularly at district, upazila, and school levels. Capacity development activities cover \nfinancial management, procurement, gender and social inclusion, and environmental and social \nsafeguards. Key initiatives to improve quality and equity in primary education include teacher \ntraining  through  CPD,  improvement  of  academic  supervision  and  mentoring,  student \nassessment and examination reforms, capacity enhancement for serving OOSC, ICT-enriched \nteaching and learning, and improvement of accessibility and reliability of the EMIS. These are \ncosted in the government\u2019s expenditure framework and largely incorporated in the PAP. \n \n22.  An  ongoing  transaction  TA  (footnote  17)  with  supplementary  financing  will  support \nprogram implementation by providing technical inputs and capacity development consistent with \nthe PAP. The additional TA outputs are planned as (i) annual fiduciary reviews, (ii) structuring of \nintegrated EMIS and early-stage tests, (iii) upgraded classroom observation tools for monitoring \nteaching practices, and (iv) study on designing a CPD framework by exploring ICT-channeled \ntraining. ADB will ensure that the TA activities, once approved, will align with the program needs \nunder the coordination of the program support team by working closely with and updating the \nsupport team on the TA progress and results. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The MOPME is the executing agency, and the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) is \nthe  implementing  agency.  An  interministerial  program  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the \nsecretary of MOPME, will be in charge of high-level decision-making under the program, with \nparticipation of key officials from MOPME, DPE, partner implementing agencies (namely the \nBureau of Non-Formal Education, the National Academy for Primary Education, the National \nCurriculum  and  Textbook  Board,  the  Local  Government  Engineering  Department,  and  the \nDepartment of Public Health Engineering), and other entities such as the MOF and the National \nPlanning Commission. DPE\u2019s additional director general will head the program coordination unit, \nwhich will coordinate and report on the DLIs. A program support team will be set up to support \nthe program coordination unit to  plan consulting services and coordinate the TA activities. \n \n24.  Development coordination. The program adopts SWAp, as led by the government, for \neffective implementation.21 The government harmonized with the joint financing development \npartners the implementation arrangements.22 The jointly set-forth terms and procedures include \nthe single common DLI matrix, the use of an IVA, coordination between TA activities, and joint \nreview arrangements on monitoring and reporting. ADB, as part of the development partners\u2019 \nconsortium, will coordinate with joint financing development partners to support the program. \n                                                \n20 The advance will meet the program\u2019s need for in-time budget allocation to trigger the progress for achieving early \nyear DLIs, by considering the different timing of funding from other joint financing development partners. \n21 The development partners subscribing to the SWAp are currently ADB, Government of Canada, European Union, \nJapan International Cooperation Agency, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, and the World Bank. Other donors such \nas the United Kingdom and the United States Agency for International Development support the subsector outside \nSWAp. \n22 As the funds of ADB and other joint financing development partners will be commingled to finance the individual \nprocurement packages under the RBL program, universal procurement will apply (ADB. 2013. Blanket Waiver of \nMember Country Procurement Eligibility Restrictions in Cases of Cofinancing for Operations Financed from Asian \nDevelopment Fund Resources. Manila). \n ", "10 \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n25.  Technical assessments confirm that the RBL program is technically sound and highly \nrelevant to the development needs of the country. The government prepared the program \nresults framework.23 The main program interventions  are adequate and well sequenced to \nsupport  achievement  of  key  targets.  The  joint  financing  development  partners  and  the \ngovernment have agreed on a single common DLI matrix and will hold joint reviews to monitor \nand evaluate the program progress.24 \n \n26.  The RBL program aims to strengthen quality and equity of primary education beyond \nachievements in access and by anticipating technological changes and their effect on human \ncapital requirements. It envisages that a larger number of primary schools will be turned into \nsingle-shift schools than in the PEDP3, thus increasing the teacher\u2013student contact hours that \nare critical to improving learning outcomes. This will require investment in infrastructure and \nincreased teacher recruitment and deployment. Newly recruited teachers will mandatorily go \nthrough an updated DPEd program. The routine subject- and pedagogy-based teacher training \nwill be integrated into a needs-based and structured CPD to improve teacher capacity to drive \ncompetency-based learning. The use of ICT in teacher training and the use of e-materials for \nteaching  and  learning  will  help  alleviate  the  shortage  of  teacher  educators,  support \nindividualized learning, and enable quick feedbacks that help improve learning outcomes. The \nscaled-up education service to OOSC, updated student-focused SLIP, and performance-based \nUPEP will promote pro-poor targeting and diversified response to local contexts.25 \n \n27.  The RBL program is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. Improving learning \noutcomes  and  reinforcing  equitable  access  for  boys  and  girls  are  specific  objectives.  The \nprogram will scale up efforts to solve the persisting issue of OOSC, of whom the majority are \nboys  and  mainly  victims  of  poverty,  by  offering flexible  education for  them to  acquire  the \ntargeted competency. Built on the subsector\u2019s achievement (such as higher enrollment and \ncompletion rates for girls,  and  more female than  male  teachers  recruited),  PAP  highlights \nmonitoring and reporting on the implementation of the government-led gender and inclusive \neducation actions. These include (i) establishing gender equality factors in the updated curricula \nand textbooks and sensitizing them through teacher training, (ii) providing equal access to ICT \nand  e-materials  at  school  for  both  boys  and  girls,  and  (iii)  enabling  a  friendly  schooling \nenvironment for children with special education needs and disabilities. \n \n28.  Substantial socioeconomic benefits are expected from (i) a greater number of primary \neducation completers who will earn higher wages (relative to non-completers); (ii) better-quality \neducation resulting in higher wage premiums for all primary education completers; and (iii) less \nwastage of public and private resources as a result of fewer students dropping out or repeating \nthe school year. The economic analysis resulted in a sound economic internal rate of return of \n17.5%. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the wage premium resulting from higher-quality \n                                                \n23 Program Results Framework (assessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 While not all joint financing development partners may fully link the release of funds to the DLIs, they are \nnevertheless committed to the indicators in the common DLI matrix, which will be included in a joint financing \narrangement and followed up in the joint review missions. \n25 The government\u2019s ongoing stipend and school feeding programs in the subsector are also supporting poor \nchildren\u2019s access to school (MOPME: Primary Education Stipend Project [3rd phase, 2015\u20132019], and School \nFeeding Program in Poverty Prone Areas [1st revised, 2010\u20132020]). \n ", "11 \neducation affects return on investment more than other variables, implying that elevating the \noverall education quality of the future workforce is essential. \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n29.  Monitoring and evaluation system. The M&E system had formally developed the \nannual primary school census since 2004, based on which the annual sector performance \nreports were generated from 2008. An e-monitoring system was piloted under the PEDP3. \nHowever, constrained central and local capacities for M&E hamper the analysis and distribution \nof the monitoring results for action. The RBL program will strengthen the use of existing primary \neducation M&E system. A web-based EMIS will be established by integrating the existing and \nnew data subsystems for tracking and reporting on key performance indicators. Strengthening \nof the primary education examination and assessment system will support timely measurement \nof progress in learning outcomes to inform subsequent interventions. The teacher information \nsystem will be broadened to report teacher profiles, recruitment, deployment, training planning, \ntracking  and  reporting,  and  other  teacher-related  data.  The  student  information  system, \nsupported by the national civil registration and vital statistics program, will be established for use \nunder the RBL program to track individual student information at school level. The education \nhousehold survey will continue under the RBL program to provide a cross-check mechanism for \nthe M&E system. The EMIS data will also be used to generate school report cards for public \ndisplay at each school, to improve transparency and accountability, and for social audits of the \nuse of the SLIP funds. The DLI 8 and PAP actions 1.5 and 4.1 focus on M&E enhancement.26 \n \n30.  Fiduciary  systems.  The  program  systems  will  be  used  for  financial  management, \nprocurement, and anticorruption measures. The program fiduciary system assessment was \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s staff guidance on RBL for programs. It assessed the \nextent to which the systems and practices provide reasonable assurance on the appropriate use \nof funds and the safeguarding of assets based on the experiences of the PEDP3 and other \nresults-based operations. Weaknesses are mainly in internal controls and oversight, with gaps \nin district, upazila, and school capacities. Delays in fund reconciliation and lack of timely action \non audit observations prevent efficient functioning. The overall financial management risk is \nassessed  to  be  substantial,  which  will  be  mitigated  through  a  continuous  improvement  of \nsystem. The rollout of the IBAS++ will improve timely and accurate financial reporting, as it \nconsolidates budget planning, execution, accounting, and reporting functions. A new chart of \naccounts with expanded budget classification codes will be implemented, increasing trackability \nof expenditures at each level. In addition to establishing an internal audit unit at the DPE to \nimprove internal control, annual fiduciary reviews will diagnose bottlenecks and recommend \nhow to remove them. The MOPME and the implementing agencies, chief accounts officer of the \nMOF, and Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General will meet for periodic audit reviews \naimed at timely resolution of audit matters. \n \n31.  The  assessment  indicates  that  progress  was made  under  the  PEDP3  in  improving \nprocurement.  For  example,  the  e-GP  was  fully  used  to  procure  works.  Major  remaining \nweaknesses are (i) a lack of trained procurement staff, (ii) constrained procurement planning \nand compliance monitoring, (iii) inefficient contract management, and (iv) lack of standardization \nof  model  bidding  documents  for  ensuring  competition  and  transparency.  Overall,  the \nprocurement risk is rated high in terms of the impact on procurement execution and program \nimplementation, which will influence the achievement of results. The RBL program will mitigate \nthe  risk  by  (i)  further  strengthening  procurement  capacity  through  the  establishment  of  a \n                                                \n26 PAP (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \ndedicated procurement division at the DPE with adequate staffing; (ii) rolling out the e-GP to all \nprocuring entities with sufficient training, and using the e-standard bidding documents that \nensure  competition  and  transparency;  (iii) preparing  and  updating  on  time  the  annual \nprocurement plans to support annual operations, and engaging the program support team to \ncoordinate planning for the procurement of services and monitoring of consultants;27 and (iv) \nupdating SLIP and UPEP guidelines and the fund management system in conjunction with \nannual social audits to ensure compliance. The DLI 7 and PAP actions 2.1\u20132.6 are included for \nstrengthening public financial management and procurement. \n \n32.  The assessment shows that the PEDP3 established an online and offline grievance \nredress system. The MOPME has the practice of sharing annual information reports with wider \nstakeholders through its website. The annual primary school census has improved the system \ntransparency. The RBL program will further strengthen governance and accountability through \nan  improved  EMIS,  social  audit,  public  disclosure  of  school  report  cards,  and  stronger \ninstitutional fiduciary arrangements such as anticorruption measures (as reflected in the PAP). \nThe Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities in \nResults-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with the government.28  \n \n33.  Safeguard systems. An assessment of the program safeguard systems was carried out \nto  appraise  applicable  laws  and  regulations  and  the  institutional  capacity  for  mitigating \nsafeguard risks. It confirmed categorization B for environment, C for involuntary resettlement, \nand  B  for  indigenous  people.  The  system  weaknesses  mainly  lie  in  weak  capacity  and \ninadequate  resources  to  integrate  measures  to  deal  with  safeguard  concerns  in  program \nimplementation and monitoring. Safeguard compliance will be strengthened by implementing an \nupdated environmental and social management framework and related safeguard monitoring \ntools for the program. A safeguard focal person at the DPE will strengthen the coordination of \nsafeguard  training,  monitoring,  and  reporting. Safeguard  compliance by  contractors  will  be \nensured by specifying key risks and mitigation measures through the contracts. The EMIS will \ninclude student and teacher data on social groups and integrate the primary education property \nmanagement information system, which will continue to be used for infrastructure planning and \nmanagement. The main safeguard actions are included in the PAP.  \n \nC.  Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n \n34.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5.  The  mitigating \nmeasures will reduce the risk ratings from high and substantial to moderate and low. They \nreflect  the  context  of  widely  applying  country  systems  with  necessary  enhancements  to \nimplement the RBL program. The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the \ncosts of mitigation. \n \nTable 5: Summary of Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Ratings  Key Mitigating Measures \nResults.
