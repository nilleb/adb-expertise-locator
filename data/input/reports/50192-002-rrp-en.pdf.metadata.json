It  aims  to  provide  quality \neducation  to  all  children  from  pre-primary  to  grade  5  through  an  efficient,  inclusive,  and \nequitable  education  system.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  joint  financing \ndevelopment partners will support the government\u2019s priorities of improving quality and equity of \nprimary education through a sector-wide approach (SWAp).1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nStrategic Context \n\n  \nA. \n \n3. \nBangladesh has achieved remarkable socioeconomic development. Poverty has halved \nsince  2000  (now  24.3%).2  Real  gross  domestic  product  has  grown  at  6.2%  annually  since \nFY2007.3 The country reached lower middle-income status in 2015.4 Improvements in education \nwere  a  key  contributor  to  the  success.  The  number  of  educated  youth  has  risen  significantly, \nand  the  literacy  rate  for  young  people  aged  15\u201324  years  increased  from  61.9%  in  2007  to \n92.2% in 2016.5 \n \nRapid  expansion  of  primary  education  has  been  at  the  heart  of  the  country\u2019s \n4. \ndevelopment. Bangladesh achieved considerable progress toward universal primary education, \nwith  a  net  enrollment  rate  of  98%  by  2016.  The  country  was  one  of  the  few  nations  that  had \nachieved gender parity up to secondary education by 2005. Nearly all primary schools now offer \npre-primary  education.6  The  efficiency  of  the  primary  education  system  also  improved.  The \nrepetition  rate  declined  from  10.5%  (2005)  to  6.1%  (2016);  and  eight  out  of  10  students \ngraduated  in  2016  while  only  five  graduated  in  2005.7  Access  to  school  by  children  from  low \nincome families has improved significantly.8 \n \n5. \nDespite  significant  progress  in  access,  Bangladesh  still  needs  to  improve  quality  and \nequity  of  primary  education.  The  2015  national  student  assessment  indicated  low  learning \noutcomes.  Only  65%  of  students  in  grade  3  grasp  grade-level  competency  for  Bangla,  while \n39% do so for math; and even fewer achieve it in grade 5 (23% for Bangla and 10% for math). \nMany school-age children are out of school (2.5 million or 11% of the 8\u201314 age group); this is \n\n                                                \n1  ADB  provided  a  technical  assistance  grant  of  $800,000  from  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  for  project \npreparation.

The  difference  in  primary  net  attendance  rates  between  the  poorest  and  richest  quintiles  narrowed  from \n22% in 2005 to 8% in 2014. \n\n \n\n\fProgram Rationale \n\nmore  prevalent  in  poor  families  and  in  disadvantaged  locations  such  as  urban  slums.9 \nDisparities  in  school  access  and  participation  remain  substantial  in  the  wetlands  (haor),  river \nislands  (char),  coastal  zone,  and  northern  districts.  Low  learning  outcomes  and  persisting \ndisparities  slow  down  and  even  prevent  children  from  climbing  up  the  educational  ladder  and \neventually participating effectively in the labor force. \n \n6. \n The government is committed to education for all and to the Sustainable Development \nGoal (SDG) 4. Vision 2021 and the Seventh Five-Year Plan (FY2016\u2013FY2020) highlight human \ncapital development as a key driver for inclusive growth and identify improving education quality \nas the most critical challenge. The National Education Policy charts a reform path for systematic \nupgrades of the education sector.10 The government is launching the Fourth Primary Education \nDevelopment Program with a considerable increase in its budget allocation, aimed at improving \nquality and equity of primary education, with joint support from development partners. \n \nB. \n \nBangladesh  has  one  of  the  largest  primary  education  systems  in  the  world,  with  more \n7. \nthan 18 million children enrolled in more than 120,000 schools. It covers 1-year free pre-primary \neducation  and  5-year  free  compulsory  primary  education.  The  system  is  largely  centralized. \nLocal  capacity  for  education  management  is  still  limited.  Despite  a  series  of  investments,  the \nsystem  has  not  been  able  to  match the  rapid increase  in  student  enrollment.  A  large  share  of \nschools (77.4%)  are running  double  shifts  and  thus  limit teacher\u2013student contact  hours,  which \nresults  in  low  learning  outcomes.11  The  expected  increase  of  student  intake  in  coming  years \nimposes  further  pressure  to  add  classrooms  and  teachers.  Teachers  mostly  focus  on  rote \nlearning  and  lack  adequate  skills.  Examination  and  assessment  systems  are  short  of  capacity \nand  feedback  mechanisms.  A  shortage  of  teaching  and  learning  material  limits  effective \nknowledge  transfer.  Moreover,  frequent  disasters  triggered  by  natural  hazards  curtail  student \nattendance  in  affected  schools.  It  is  also  imperative  to  improve  school-specific  quality  and \nparticipation indicators through community involvement. \n \n8. \nThe  proposed  results-based  lending  (RBL)  program  supports  the  government\u2019s \ninitiatives  to  tackle  these  challenges  and  lift  the  overall  performance  of  the  primary  education \nsystem.  It  builds  on  the  joint  experience  of  government  and  development  partners.  The \ngovernment  has  implemented  three  phases  of  comprehensive  primary  education  development \nprogram,  supported  by  development  partners  including  ADB.12  The  first  two  phases  rolled  out \n\n                                                \n9  The  number  is  based  on  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics  projections  and  Education  Household  Survey  (2014) \ndata. Poverty was indicated as the main reason for about 40% of children never being at school or dropping out. \n10 Government  of  Bangladesh,  National  Planning  Commission.  2012.

Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nthe  compulsory  primary  education  scheme,  remarkably  increased  enrollment  and  achieved \ngender parity in access. The Third Primary Education Development Project (PEDP3) supporting \nthe government\u2019s third phase program, undertook measures to further expand primary and pre-\nprimary  education,  improve  teacher  qualifications,  trigger  competency-based  learning,  and \nbolster  school-level  management.13  Lessons  from  the  PEDP3  highlight  that  (i) teacher \ndevelopment should be more systematic and needs-based to improve teacher proficiencies and \n(ii)  monitoring  should  provide  timely  feedback  at  all  levels  to  better  inform  education  planning \nand management. The RBL program will address these aspects. In addition, it will help (i) revise \nthe  curriculum  and  enrich  learning  resources,  e.g.,  through  information  and  communication \ntechnology (ICT); (ii) recruit and deploy more teachers; (iii) establish a primary education board \nto  lead  reforms  on  examinations  and  assessments;  (iv)  build  more  classrooms  in  line  with \ndisaster-resilience  requirements;  (v)  scale  up  the  education  service  for  out-of-school  children \n(OOSC); and (vi) strengthen the autonomy and capacity of schools and upazilas (sub-districts) \nwith  performance-linked  incentives.  It  will  mainstream  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion, \nmonitored with data disaggregated by sex and social categories. \n \nThe RBL program is a step forward from the PEDP3, which adopted the disbursement-\n9. \nlinked  indicator  (DLI)  approach.14  The  RBL  is  the  most  suitable  modality  because  (i)  the  large \nnational  program  requires  strong  focus  on  results  (as  opposed  to  inputs);  (ii)  the  government \nhas  strong  leadership  and  commitment;  (iii)  key  implementing  agencies  have  demonstrated \nresults-based  management  capacity;  (iv)  government  systems  have  been  used  since  the \nPEDP3  (through  treasury  model,  and  for  national  procurement  of  goods  and  works);  and \n(v) development  partners  have  agreed  on  results-based  financing  with  a  single  common  DLI \nmatrix,  to  harmonize  support  and  reduce  the  administrative  burden.15  The  RBL  program \nincorporates  well  the  recommendations  from  ADB  evaluation  of  the  previous  RBL  programs.16 \nThese  include  (i)  deepening  client\u2019s  institution  building  through  the  DLIs,  (ii)  ensuring  the \nselectivity  of  program  actions  to  facilitate  monitoring,  (iii)  strengthening  monitoring  and \nevaluation (M&E) system and capacity, and (iv) using an independent verification agency (IVA). \nADB\u2019s  due  diligence  assessments,  carried  out  in  coordination  with  other  joint  financing \ndevelopment  partners,  provide  reasonable  assurance  for  effective  achievement  of  results \nthrough RBL with measures to strengthen program systems. \n \nADB  value  addition.  ADB  has  been  supporting  Bangladesh\u2019s  education  sector  in  a \n10. \nsystematic  way,  and  the  RBL  program  will  build  on  it.  ADB  lending  will  provide  much-needed \nfinance for more investments to improve the quality and equity of primary education. It will add \nvalue  through key  initiatives,  such  as  reducing  double-shift  operations at  schools,  stepping  up \nteacher  education  and  examination  reform,  enriching  teaching  and  learning  resources,  and \nimproving  school-level  management  and  institution  building.  In  coordination  with  other  joint \nfinancing  development  partners,  ADB  will  provide  technical  assistance (TA)  by  supplementary \n\n                                                \n13 The PEDP3 (i)  improved the learning environment by hiring 95,400 teachers and building 39,000 classrooms; (ii) \nraised teacher qualification at entry (now nearly 60% of primary school teachers have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree); \n(iii) introduced the Diploma in Primary Education program for newly recruited teachers prior to service; (iv) adopted \na  competency-based  curriculum  and  provided  free  textbooks  on  time;  (v) improved  the  relevance  of  primary \neducation completion examination by attaching competency-based test items; (vi) piloted second-chance education \nfor out-of-school children; and (vii) extended the school level improvement plan to all schools.  \n\n14 In the PEDP3, ADB\u2019s financing was 50% allocated to the DLIs and 50% based on statements of expenditures, and \n\nthe World Bank\u2019s financing was 100% on the DLIs. \n\n15 The World Bank uses the program-for-results modality for the proposed program. \n16 ADB.  2016.

The RBL program is \naligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for Bangladesh\u2014under pillar 2 for \nimproving human capital\u2014and included in the country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020.18 It \nwill directly contribute to the government\u2019s commitment to SDG in education (SDG 4), especially \non improving learning outcomes (SDG 4.1) and reducing disparities (SDG 4.5). \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe  Fourth  Primary  Education  Development  Program  aims  to  improve  the  quality, \nequity,  efficiency,  and  inclusiveness  of  primary  education.  The  RBL  program  will  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s initiatives. The outcome and the outputs of the RBL program are almost the same \nas those of the Fourth Primary Education Development Program, except for certain activities as \nset out in Table 1. Hence, the scope and the cost of the RBL program are slightly adjusted.

The outcome \n12. \nwill  be  improved  quality  and  equity  of  primary  education  for  all  children  from  pre-primary  to \ngrade  5  (DLI  A    and    DLI  B).  It  is  expected  to  directly  benefit  18.6  million  students;  and  also \naround 340,000 teachers and more than 65,000 schools that are under the management of the \nMinistry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME). The outputs are: \n \n13. \nOutput  1:  Quality  of  primary  education  improved.  This  output  aims  to  apply  quality \nteaching\u2013learning practices in all schools to enable children to acquire the essential grade-level \ncompetencies.  The  government  will  update  curricula  and  textbooks,  and  develop  teaching\u2013\nlearning materials (including selected supplementary reading materials) for all grades (DLI 1). It \nwill  include  updating  and expanding  the  use of ICT and  e-resources for  teaching  and learning \n(program action plan [PAP] 1.6.1). Additional teachers will be recruited and deployed for more \nschools  to  reach  the  standard  pupil\u2013teacher  ratio  (DLI  2,  PAP  1.2).  The  existing  in-service \ntraining  for  teachers  and  teacher  educators  will  be  transformed  into  a  continuous  professional \ndevelopment  (CPD)  program  to  improve  teachers\u2019  proficiencies  in  driving  competency-based \nlearning (DLI 3, PAP 1.6). The Diploma in Primary Education (DPEd) program will be updated \nwith  stronger  quality  assurance  (DLI  3).  Primary  teachers  training  institutes  will  gain  greater \ntraining capacities to deliver the DPEd program (DLI 3). To refresh the subsector\u2019s examination \nand assessment system, a primary education board will be established to (i) strengthen school-\nbased examinations for timely measurement of and feedback on student learning outcomes and \n(ii) reform primary education completion examination to focus more on knowledge application or \ncompetency.  This  output  will  also \nimplementing  an  updated  national  student \nassessment  (DLI  4)  by  aligning  it  with  the  revised  curriculum,  drawing  on  international  good \npractices, and providing evidence-based recommendations for education reform. \n \n14. \nOutput 2: Access and participation to primary education enhanced. This output will \nfurther  improve  the  learning  environment  and  scale  up  education  services  to  underserved \nchildren.  It  will  include  building  more  classrooms  conforming  to  the  infrastructure  planning \nstandard  and  turn  more  schools  into  single-shift  operations  (DLI  5).  Gender-segregated \nsanitation facilities and safe water sources will be provided in almost all schools (DLI 5), which \nwill  increase  parents\u2019  willingness  to  send  children  to  school.  New  construction  and  major \nretrofitting will meet disaster risk resilience requirements (PAP 1.7) for the safety and continuity \nof primary education, especially in disaster-prone areas. The schools will improve preparedness \nand  response  for  education  in  emergencies.  The  output  will  scale  up  partnerships  with \nnongovernment  entities  to  reach  OOSC  aged  8\u201314  with  interventions  to  help  them  attain  the \ncompetencies  targeted  by  primary  education  (DLI  6).  Promotion  of  gender  equity  and \ninclusiveness  will  be  monitored  and  reported  (PAP  4.1)  by  including  the  measures  for \ncommunication and social mobilization. \n\ninclude \n\n \n\n\fOutput  3:  Governance  and  management  of  primary  education  system  improved.  \n15. \nTo  support  decentralization,  this  output  will  strengthen  institutional  capacities  at  all  levels  of \nprimary  education  offices,  in  line  with  the  updated  organizational  development  and  capacity-\nbuilding  guidebook  (DLI  9,  PAP  1.4).  It  will  transform  the  existing  flat-funded  school  level \nimprovement  plan  (SLIP)  to  student-linked  and  needs-based  funding,  aimed  at  enhancing \nenrollment and retention (DLI 9). The upazila primary education plan (UPEP) will be piloted with \nfunding based on needs and performance to strengthen upazila-level management (DLI 9). The \nfund management system will be strengthened to respond better to schools\u2019 needs and monitor \nbetter  fund  usage  (PAP  1.3).  This  output  will  align  subsector  management  with  the  ongoing \nreform of national fiduciary systems. It will  enable more accurate and timely financial reporting \nand audit resolutions by rolling out a web-based advanced version of the Integrated Budget and \nAccounting  System  (iBAS++)  and  initiating  internal  auditing  for  the  program  (DLI  7,  PAP  2.3\u2013\n2.6).  The  use  of  the  electronic  government  procurement  (e-GP)  system  will  be  expanded  to \naugment  transparency,  efficiency,  and  accountability  of  public  expenditures  (DLI  7,  PAP  2.1\u2013\n2.2). This  output  will  build  a web-based  integrated  education  management  information  system \n(EMIS) to boost M&E; accuracy is to be ensured through the annual primary school census and \ncross-validation with the education household survey (DLI 8, PAP 1.5). \n \n16. \nThe DLIs were derived from the results framework of the program and agreed between \nthe  government  and  joint  financing  development  partners.  Financing  of  prior  result  DLIs  is \nenvisaged  to  ensure  important  enabling  actions  by  loan  effectiveness.  These  include \n(i) adoption  of  an  action  plan  for  curriculum  revision  and  development  of  textbooks  and \nteaching\u2013learning  materials;  (ii)  endorsement  of  the  teacher  recruitment  plan;  (iii)  approval  of \nthe  DPEd  curriculum  revision  plan,  and  the  DPEd  program  target  and  annual  activities;  and \n(iv) approval of the infrastructure plan and updated guidelines. The selection of DLIs includes an \nappropriate  mix  of  results  at  outcome  and  output  levels  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  the  RBL \nprogram. The sequencing of the DLI targets ensures a gradual progression in achieving results. \nThe  allocation  among  DLIs  prioritizes  key  results  to  improve  quality  of  education,  while  also \nsupporting access and institutional capacity. The PAP includes key actions that are required for \nachieving the DLI targets.

The ADB loan will be disbursed over 5 years, based on \nthe  verification  of  achievement  of  the  DLIs.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s general  account. The government will  ensure  that total  eligible  expenditures  are \nequal  to  or  exceed  the  total  amount  of  disbursement  from  ADB  and  other  joint  financing \ndevelopment  partners  during  the  program  period.  ADB  will  provide  financing  for  prior  results \n($60 million), expected to be achieved by loan effectiveness. The MOPME, through the Ministry \nof Finance (MOF), will submit withdrawal applications semiannually or annually (as applicable), \nalong  with  evidence  of  achievement  of  the  DLIs  verified  by  the  IVA  and  unaudited  interim \nfinancial statements for the period concerned. Partial disbursements are allowed for DLIs A, B, \n2, 5, 6, 7, and 9 as described in the verification protocol. Except for those DLIs that cannot be \nrolled  over  (as  described  in  the  verification  protocol),  any  amount  not  disbursed  for  an  unmet \nDLI  will  be  disbursed  once  it  is  achieved.  Disbursements  are  allowed  for  early  or  late \nachievement of the DLIs. An advance of a maximum of $65 million, in addition to prior results \nfunding, will be provided to the government upon effectiveness, against expected achievements \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nthrough  CPD, \n\nCapacity Development and Program Action Plan \n\nof the DLI targets and subject to the terms specified in the legal agreement.20 The advance will \nbe liquidated toward the end of the RBL program. \n \nF. \n \n21. \nThe  RBL  program  will  strengthen  capacities  in  the  primary  education  subsector  at  all \nlevels,  particularly  at  district,  upazila,  and school  levels.  Capacity  development  activities  cover \nfinancial management, procurement, gender and social inclusion, and environmental and social \nsafeguards.  Key  initiatives  to  improve  quality  and  equity  in  primary  education  include  teacher \ntraining \nimprovement  of  academic  supervision  and  mentoring,  student \nassessment  and examination reforms,  capacity enhancement for  serving OOSC, ICT-enriched \nteaching  and learning,  and  improvement  of  accessibility  and reliability  of  the  EMIS. These are \ncosted in the government\u2019s expenditure framework and largely incorporated in the PAP. \n \n22. \nAn  ongoing  transaction  TA  (footnote  17)  with  supplementary  financing  will  support \nprogram implementation by providing technical inputs and capacity development consistent with \nthe PAP. The additional TA outputs are planned as (i) annual fiduciary reviews, (ii) structuring of \nintegrated EMIS and early-stage tests, (iii) upgraded classroom observation tools for monitoring \nteaching  practices,  and  (iv)  study  on  designing  a  CPD  framework  by  exploring  ICT-channeled \ntraining. ADB will ensure that the TA activities, once approved, will align with the program needs \nunder  the  coordination  of  the  program  support  team  by  working  closely  with  and  updating  the \nsupport team on the TA progress and results. \n \nG. \n \n23. \nThe MOPME is the executing agency, and the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) is \nthe  implementing  agency.  An  interministerial  program  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the \nsecretary  of  MOPME,  will  be  in  charge  of  high-level  decision-making  under  the  program,  with \nparticipation  of  key  officials  from  MOPME,  DPE,  partner  implementing  agencies  (namely  the \nBureau  of  Non-Formal  Education,  the  National  Academy  for  Primary  Education,  the  National \nCurriculum  and  Textbook  Board,  the  Local  Government  Engineering  Department,  and  the \nDepartment of Public Health Engineering), and other entities such as the MOF and the National \nPlanning Commission. DPE\u2019s additional director general will head the program coordination unit, \nwhich will coordinate and report on the DLIs. A program support team will be set up to support \nthe program coordination unit to  plan consulting services and coordinate the TA activities. \n \nDevelopment coordination. The program adopts SWAp, as led by the government, for \n24. \neffective  implementation.21  The  government  harmonized  with  the  joint  financing  development \npartners the implementation arrangements.22 The jointly set-forth terms and procedures include \nthe single common DLI matrix, the use of an IVA, coordination between TA activities, and joint \nreview  arrangements  on  monitoring  and  reporting.  ADB,  as  part  of  the  development  partners\u2019 \nconsortium, will coordinate with joint financing development partners to support the program. \n                                                \n20 The advance will meet the program\u2019s need for in-time budget allocation to trigger the progress for achieving early \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nyear DLIs, by considering the different timing of funding from other joint financing development partners. \n\n21 The development partners subscribing to the SWAp are currently ADB, Government of Canada, European Union, \nJapan International Cooperation Agency, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, and the World Bank. Other donors such \nas the United Kingdom and the United States Agency for International Development support the subsector outside \nSWAp. \n\n22 As the funds of ADB and other joint financing development partners will be commingled to finance the individual \nprocurement packages  under the  RBL  program,  universal procurement  will apply  (ADB.  2013.

The  government  prepared  the  program \nresults  framework.23  The  main  program  interventions  are  adequate  and  well  sequenced  to \nsupport  achievement  of  key  targets.  The  joint  financing  development  partners  and  the \ngovernment have agreed on a single common DLI matrix and will hold joint reviews to monitor \nand evaluate the program progress.24 \n \n26. \nThe  RBL  program  aims  to  strengthen  quality  and  equity  of  primary  education  beyond \nachievements  in  access  and  by  anticipating  technological  changes  and  their  effect  on  human \ncapital  requirements.  It  envisages  that  a  larger  number  of  primary  schools  will  be  turned  into \nsingle-shift schools than in the PEDP3, thus increasing the teacher\u2013student contact hours that \nare  critical  to  improving  learning  outcomes.  This  will  require  investment  in  infrastructure  and \nincreased  teacher  recruitment  and  deployment.  Newly  recruited  teachers  will  mandatorily  go \nthrough an updated DPEd program. The routine subject- and pedagogy-based teacher training \nwill be integrated into a needs-based and structured CPD to improve teacher capacity to drive \ncompetency-based  learning.  The  use  of  ICT  in  teacher  training  and  the  use  of  e-materials  for \nthe  shortage  of  teacher  educators,  support \nteaching  and \nindividualized  learning,  and  enable quick feedbacks  that  help improve  learning  outcomes. The \nscaled-up education service to OOSC, updated student-focused SLIP, and performance-based \nUPEP will promote pro-poor targeting and diversified response to local contexts.25 \n \n27. \nThe RBL program is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. Improving learning \noutcomes  and  reinforcing  equitable  access  for  boys  and  girls  are  specific  objectives.  The \nprogram  will  scale  up  efforts  to  solve  the  persisting  issue  of  OOSC,  of  whom  the  majority  are \nboys  and  mainly  victims  of  poverty,  by  offering  flexible  education  for  them  to  acquire  the \ntargeted  competency.  Built  on  the  subsector\u2019s  achievement  (such  as  higher  enrollment  and \ncompletion  rates  for  girls,  and  more  female  than  male  teachers  recruited),  PAP  highlights \nmonitoring  and  reporting  on  the  implementation  of  the  government-led  gender  and  inclusive \neducation actions. These include (i) establishing gender equality factors in the updated curricula \nand textbooks and sensitizing them through teacher training, (ii) providing equal access to ICT \nand  e-materials  at  school  for  both  boys  and  girls,  and  (iii)  enabling  a  friendly  schooling \nenvironment for children with special education needs and disabilities. \n \n28. \nSubstantial  socioeconomic  benefits  are  expected  from  (i)  a  greater  number  of  primary \neducation completers who will earn higher wages (relative to non-completers); (ii) better-quality \neducation resulting in higher wage premiums for all primary education completers; and (iii) less \nwastage of public and private resources as a result of fewer students dropping out or repeating \nthe school year. The economic analysis resulted in a sound economic internal rate of return of \n17.5%.  A  sensitivity  analysis  revealed  that  the  wage  premium  resulting  from  higher-quality \n\n                                                \n23 Program Results Framework (assessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 While  not  all  joint  financing  development  partners  may  fully  link  the  release  of  funds  to  the  DLIs,  they  are \nnevertheless  committed  to  the  indicators  in  the  common  DLI  matrix,  which  will  be  included  in  a  joint  financing \narrangement and followed up in the joint review missions. \n\n25 The  government\u2019s  ongoing  stipend  and  school  feeding  programs  in  the  subsector  are  also  supporting  poor \nchildren\u2019s  access  to  school  (MOPME:  Primary  Education  Stipend  Project  [3rd  phase,  2015\u20132019],  and  School \nFeeding Program in Poverty Prone Areas [1st revised, 2010\u20132020]). \n\n\f11 \n\neducation  affects  return  on  investment  more  than  other  variables,  implying  that  elevating  the \noverall education quality of the future workforce is essential. \n\nProgram Systems Assessments \n\nB. \n \n29.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  The  M&E  system  had  formally  developed  the \nannual  primary  school  census  since  2004,  based  on  which  the  annual  sector  performance \nreports  were  generated  from  2008.  An  e-monitoring  system  was  piloted  under  the  PEDP3. \nHowever, constrained central and local capacities for M&E hamper the analysis and distribution \nof the monitoring results for action. The RBL program will strengthen the use of existing primary \neducation  M&E  system. A  web-based  EMIS  will  be  established  by  integrating the  existing  and \nnew  data  subsystems for tracking  and reporting on key  performance indicators.  Strengthening \nof the primary education examination and assessment system will support timely measurement \nof  progress  in  learning  outcomes  to  inform  subsequent  interventions.  The  teacher  information \nsystem will be broadened to report teacher profiles, recruitment, deployment, training planning, \ntracking  and  reporting,  and  other  teacher-related  data.  The  student  information  system, \nsupported by the national civil registration and vital statistics program, will be established for use \nunder  the  RBL  program  to  track  individual  student  information  at  school  level.  The  education \nhousehold survey will continue under the RBL program to provide a cross-check mechanism for \nthe  M&E  system.  The  EMIS  data  will  also  be  used  to  generate  school  report  cards  for  public \ndisplay at each school, to improve transparency and accountability, and for social audits of the \nuse of the SLIP funds. The DLI 8 and PAP actions 1.5 and 4.1 focus on M&E enhancement.26 \n \n30. \nFiduciary  systems.  The  program  systems  will  be  used  for  financial  management, \nprocurement,  and  anticorruption  measures.  The  program  fiduciary  system  assessment  was \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  staff  guidance  on  RBL  for  programs.  It  assessed  the \nextent to which the systems and practices provide reasonable assurance on the appropriate use \nof  funds  and  the  safeguarding  of  assets  based  on  the  experiences  of  the  PEDP3  and  other \nresults-based operations. Weaknesses are mainly in internal controls and oversight, with gaps \nin district, upazila, and school capacities. Delays in fund reconciliation and lack of timely action \non  audit  observations  prevent  efficient  functioning.  The  overall  financial  management  risk  is \nassessed  to  be  substantial,  which  will  be  mitigated  through  a  continuous  improvement  of \nsystem.  The  rollout  of  the  IBAS++  will  improve  timely  and  accurate  financial  reporting,  as  it \nconsolidates  budget  planning,  execution,  accounting,  and  reporting  functions.  A  new  chart  of \naccounts with expanded budget classification codes will be implemented, increasing trackability \nof  expenditures  at  each  level.  In  addition  to  establishing  an  internal  audit  unit  at  the  DPE  to \nimprove  internal  control,  annual  fiduciary  reviews  will  diagnose  bottlenecks  and  recommend \nhow to remove them. The MOPME and the implementing agencies, chief accounts officer of the \nMOF,  and  Office  of  the  Comptroller  and  Auditor  General  will  meet  for  periodic  audit  reviews \naimed at timely resolution of audit matters. \n \n31. \nThe  assessment  indicates  that  progress  was  made  under  the  PEDP3  in  improving \nprocurement.  For  example,  the  e-GP  was  fully  used  to  procure  works.  Major  remaining \nweaknesses  are  (i)  a  lack  of  trained  procurement  staff,  (ii)  constrained  procurement  planning \nand compliance monitoring, (iii) inefficient contract management, and (iv) lack of standardization \nof  model  bidding  documents  for  ensuring  competition  and  transparency.  Overall,  the \nprocurement  risk  is  rated  high  in  terms  of  the  impact  on  procurement  execution  and  program \nimplementation, which will influence the achievement of results. The RBL program will mitigate \nthe  risk  by  (i)  further  strengthening  procurement  capacity  through  the  establishment  of  a \n\n                                                \n26 PAP (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\ndedicated procurement division at the DPE with adequate staffing; (ii) rolling out the e-GP to all \nprocuring  entities  with  sufficient  training,  and  using  the  e-standard  bidding  documents  that \nensure  competition  and  transparency;  (iii) preparing  and  updating  on  time  the  annual \nprocurement  plans  to  support  annual  operations,  and  engaging  the  program  support  team  to \ncoordinate  planning  for  the  procurement  of  services  and  monitoring  of  consultants;27  and  (iv) \nupdating  SLIP  and  UPEP  guidelines  and  the  fund  management  system  in  conjunction  with \nannual social audits to ensure compliance. The DLI 7 and PAP actions 2.1\u20132.6 are included for \nstrengthening public financial management and procurement. \n \n32. \nThe  assessment  shows  that  the  PEDP3  established  an  online  and  offline  grievance \nredress system. The MOPME has the practice of sharing annual information reports with wider \nstakeholders through its website.  The annual primary school census has improved the system \ntransparency. The  RBL program  will  further strengthen governance  and accountability  through \nan  improved  EMIS,  social  audit,  public  disclosure  of  school  report  cards,  and  stronger \ninstitutional fiduciary arrangements  such as anticorruption measures (as reflected in the PAP). \nThe  Guidelines  to  Prevent  or  Mitigate  Fraud,  Corruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in \nResults-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with the government.28  \n \n33. \nSafeguard systems. An assessment of the program safeguard systems was carried out \nto  appraise  applicable  laws  and  regulations  and  the  institutional  capacity  for  mitigating \nsafeguard  risks.  It  confirmed  categorization  B  for  environment,  C  for  involuntary  resettlement, \nand  B  for  indigenous  people.  The  system  weaknesses  mainly  lie  in  weak  capacity  and \ninadequate  resources  to  integrate  measures  to  deal  with  safeguard  concerns  in  program \nimplementation and monitoring. Safeguard compliance will be strengthened by implementing an \nupdated  environmental  and  social  management  framework  and  related  safeguard  monitoring \ntools for the program. A safeguard focal person at the DPE will strengthen the coordination of \nsafeguard  training,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  Safeguard  compliance  by  contractors  will  be \nensured by specifying key risks and mitigation measures through the contracts. The EMIS  will \ninclude student and teacher data on social groups and integrate the primary education property \nmanagement information system, which will continue to be used for infrastructure planning and \nmanagement. The main safeguard actions are included in the PAP.  \n \nC. \n \n34.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5.  The  mitigating \nmeasures  will  reduce  the  risk  ratings  from  high  and  substantial  to  moderate  and  low.  They \nreflect  the  context  of  widely  applying  country  systems  with  necessary  enhancements  to \nimplement  the  RBL  program.  The  overall  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the \ncosts of mitigation. \n \n\nIntegrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 5: Summary of Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nResults.
