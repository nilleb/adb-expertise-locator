An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nundertaken. The summary is in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \nThe  Domestic  Maritime  Transport  Project  (DMTP  or  the  Project) \ncomprises  (i) an  infrastructure  investment  component,  and  (ii)  an \ninstitutional  development  and  capacity  building  component.  The \ninfrastructure investment component consists of enhancements to \nthe  existing  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  through  (i)  construction  of  a  new \n290  meter  (m) long  quay,  projecting  northward  at  right  angles  to \nMarine Drive alongside the boundary to Mal\u00e9 Commercial Harbor; \n(ii) ancillary civil works; (iii) provision of cargo handling equipment; \n(iv) construction  of  a  temporary  transit  area  for  goods  and \npassengers;  and  (v)  consulting  services  for  detailed  design, \npreparation  of  tender  documents,  bid  evaluation,  construction \nsupervision, and project management assistance. The institutional \ndevelopment and capacity building component aims at increasing \nthe sustainability of the investment and enhancing ongoing sector \ninitiatives  by  providing  support  to  (i)  current  efforts  to  align  the \nthe  Ministry  of  Transport  and \norganizational  structure  of \nCommunication (MTC) to its sector mandate, in particular focusing \non  policy,  planning,  and  regulatory  functions  of  international  and \ndomestic maritime transport infrastructure and transport services; \n(ii)  capacity  building  within  MTC  in  the  areas  of:  (a)  strategic \nplanning  and  policy  analysis,  (b)  establishment  of  harbor  usage \ncharges, (c) maritime safety regulations and vessel inspection and \nregistration  procedures,  and  (d)  project  performance  and  impact \nmonitoring;  and  (iii)  capacity  building  within  the  Ministry  of \nConstruction  and  Public  Infrastructure  (MCPI)  to  enable  it  to \nmanage, operate, and maintain maritime transport infrastructure in \nMal\u00e9  in  a  sustainable  manner  through  (a)  harbor  management, \nand (b) financial management training.  \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\nfor \n\nMal\u00e9  North  Harbor  is  the  lifeline  access  point  to  the  social  and \neconomic  development  opportunities  available  in  the  capital  for \n70%  of  the population who  live  in outer  atolls,  where  the  highest \nincidence  of  poverty  occurs.  By  providing  connectivity  to  the \ncapital, Mal\u00e9 North Harbor serves a fundamental social need and \nis  the  most  important  interisland  transport  hub  in  the  Maldives. \nCongestion in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor is chronic. The current situation, \nwhich  constitutes  a  bottleneck \nthe  poorest  population \nsegment\u2019s entry to the capital, is a result of the combined effects \nof lack of capacity and lack of harbor management. Improvements \nto the existing facilities are the highest ranked sector infrastructure \ninvestment  proposal  in  the  Government\u2019s  Seventh  National \nDevelopment  Plan  2006\u20132010  (7NDP).  Construction  of  an \nadditional  quay  area  of  290  m  will  alleviate  congestion  for  quay \nspace  and  on  the  feeder  road.  The  investment  will  increase  the \nsustainability  and  operational  efficiency  of  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor, \ntogether  with  the  institutional  development  and  capacity  building \ncomponent  which  includes  support  to  (i)  introduction  of  harbor \nusage charges, and (ii) harbor management initiatives.  \n \nThrough  facilitating  access  to  markets  and  social  services,  the \nProject  will  help  ensure  redistribution  of  benefits;  and  sustained, \nequitable,  and  regionally  balanced  economic  growth  within  the \nMaldives.  The  impact  will  be  attained  by  improvements  to  the \ncountry\u2019s  main  inter-atoll  transport  hub,  supported  by  institutional \nand capacity building initiatives in the domestic maritime transport \nsector. The expanded capacity of Mal\u00e9 North Harbor will improve \nconnectivity, reduce transport cost, and facilitate interisland trade. \nIt is expected that the enhanced capacity will increase Mal\u00e9 North \nHarbor\u2019s contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.1% by \n2015.  The  increase  in  interisland  trade  is  expected  to  result  in  a \n10%  volume  increase  in  key  outputs  of  domestic  agricultural \nproduce sold in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor markets by 2014. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $6.65  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $0.43 million.  \n \n\nTable 1: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n     Total \n\nTotal \n5.33 \n1.32 \n6.65 \n\n \nSources: Feasibility study and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n% \n80 \n20 \n100 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\niii\n\nA  loan  of  $5.33  million  equivalent  from  the  Asian  Development \nBank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Special  Funds  resources  will  be  provided.

The  Borrower  will  be  the  Republic  of \nMaldives. \n \nUntil 31 December 2009 \n \n30 June 2009 \n\n \nMinistry of Finance and Treasury (MoFT) \n \nA  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  established  for  the \nProject,  chaired  by  the  Minister  of  MTC,  with  representatives  at \ndirector  levels  from  MoFT;  MCPI;  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nNational  Development  (MPND);  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopment  (MHUD);  Ministry  of  Environment,  Energy  and \nWater (MEEW); Mal\u00e9 Municipality; and other relevant agencies as \nnecessary.  The  PSC  will  provide  overall  policy  and  operational \nadvice  and  guidance  to  the  Project.  The  Implementing  Agency \n(IA)  will  be  MTC.  The  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be \nlocated  in  the  IA  and  will  be  headed  by  the  executive  director  of \nplanning and projects in MTC as the project director. The project \ndirector  will  serve  as  secretary  to  the  PSC  and  will  appoint  the \nheads  of  the  two  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  to  be \nestablished in MTC and MCPI. The PMU will be staffed with (i) a \nsenior  transport  policy  and  planning  specialist,  (ii)  a  transport \npolicy  and  planning  specialist,  (iii)  a  senior  transport  project \nmanagement  specialist,  and  (iv)  a  transport  project  management \nspecialist.  The  MTC  PIU  will  be  headed  by  a  senior  transport \npolicy and planning specialist and be staffed with (i) a policy and \nplanning expert, and (ii) a regulatory expert. The MCPI PIU will be \nheaded  by  a  senior  engineer  and  be  staffed  with  (i)  a  design \nincluding \napproval  engineer; \nenvironmental coordination; and (iii) a project accountant.  \n \nGoods,  works,  and  related  services  to  be  financed  out  of  the \nproposed  loan  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2006, as amended from time to time.) All contracts will \nbe procured through international competitive bidding (ICB). \n \n\n(ii)  a  supervision  engineer, \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nDMTP  will require 50.5 person-months of international consulting \nservices and 33.0 person-months of national consulting services. \nThe consultants will be engaged by the Government using ADB\u2019s \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  method,  based  on \nbiodata  technical  proposals  for  the  infrastructure  investment \nconsulting  component,  and  simplified  technical  proposals  for  the \ninstitutional  development  and  capacity  building  component.  All \nconsulting selection will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2006,  as  amended  from \ntime to time). \n \nThe  Project  will  minimize \nfor  cargo  and \npassenger  vessels  and  reduce  cargo  handling  cost,  cargo \ndamage,  and  road  congestion  on  Marine  Drive.  The  direct \nbeneficiaries  will  be  vessel  owners,  passengers,  and  cargo \nowners  from  outer  atolls.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is \nestimated at 22.5%. \n \nAvailability  of  skilled  and  experienced  staff \nfor  project \nimplementation  and  monitoring  is  a  critical  constraint,  which  has \nbeen  mitigated  through  the  support  of  consultants  and  the \ncapacity  building  activities  included  under  the  infrastructure \ninvestment  consulting  and  the  institutional  development  and \ncapacity building components. \n\nturnaround \n\ntime \n\n \n\n\f72  00'Eo\n\n74  00'Eo\n\nNORTH THILADHUNMATHI ATOLL\n(Haa Alifu)\n\nDhidhdhoo\n\nGailandhoo Channel\n\nSOUTH THILADHUNMATHI ATOLL\n(Haa Dhaalu)\n\nNolhivaranfaru\n\n6  00'No\n\nM oresby C hannel\n\nAlifushi\n\nNORTH MILADHUNMADULU ATOLL\n(Shaviyani)\n\nFarukolhufunadhoo\n\n6  00'No\n\nSOUTH MILADHUNMADULU ATOLL\n(Noonu)\n\nNORTH MAALHOSMADULU ATOLL\n(Raa)\n\nManadhoo\n\nUgoofaaru\n\nNaifaru\nFAADHIPPOLHU ATOLL\n(Lhaviyani)\n\nSOUTH MAALHOSMADULU ATOLL\n(Baa)\n\nEydhafushi\n\nWadu\nChannel\n\nMAL\u00c9 ATOLL\n(Kaafu)\n\nRosdhoo\n\nARI ATHOLU UTHURUGOFI ATOLL\n( North Alifu)\n\nMAL\u00c9\n\nMahibadhoo\n\nARI ATHOLU DHEKUNBURI ATOLL\n\n(South Alifu)\n\nAriyaddu Channel\n\nFulidu Channel\n\nKeyodhoo\n\nFelidhe\n\nFELIDHE ATOLL\n(Vaavu)\n\nNORTH NILANDHE ATOLL\n(Faafu)\n\nMagoodhoo\n\nNilandhoo\n\nWataru Channel\n\nMULAKU ATOLL\n(Meemu)\n\nSOUTH NILANDHE ATOLL\n\nMuli\n\n(Dhaalu)\nKudahuvadhoo\n\nKudahuvadu Channel\n\nKOLHUMADULU ATOLL\n(Thaa)\nVeymandhoo\n\nel\n\nn\n\nn\n\na\n\nh\n\nu  C\n\nd\n\nn\n\na\n\neim\n\nV\n\nHithadhoo\n\nHADHDHUNMATHI ATOLL\n(Laamu)\n\n1  00'No\n\nOne and Half Degree Channel\n\nM A L D I V E S\n\n1  00'No\n\nVilin'gili\n\nNORTH HUVADHU ATOLL\n(Gaafu Alifu)\n\nThinadhoo\n\nSOUTH HUVADHU ATOLL\n(Gaafu Dhaalu)\n\nEquatorial Channel\n\nFoamulah\n\nFOAMULAKU ATOLL\n(Gnaviyani)\n\nADDU ATOLL\n(Seenu)\n\nHithadhoo\n\n72  00'Eo\n\n74  00'Eo\n\n0\n6\n-\n4\n6\n4\n4\na\n \nH\nR\n\nMALDIVES\nDOMESTIC MARITIME TRANSPORT PROJECT\n\nMale' North West Harbor\n\nGovernment Harbor\n\nMale' North East Harbor\n\nMale' North Harbor\n\nPROPOSED MALE' \nNORTH HARBOUR\n\nINTERISLAND\nBASIN\nR I V\nE   D\nR I N\n\nE\n\nA\n\nM\n\nL\n\ni\n\ng\n\nh\n\nt\n\ne\n\nr\n\na\n\ng\n\ne\n\n \n\nB\n\ne\n\nr\nt\n\nh\n\nCOMMERCIAL\nHARBOR\n\nE\n\nRIV\nU D\nG\nA\nE M\n\nE\nN\nA\nH\nD\nN\nA\nH\nC\n\nMAJEEDHLE DRIVE\n\nI\n\n \n\nE\nV\nR\nD\nA\nS\nA\nL\n \nA\nR\nA\nK\n\nAMEENEE MAGU DRIVE\n\nMale' South West Harbor\n\nN\n\nMeters\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\nW a d u     C h a n n e l\n\nProject Area\n\nNational Capital\n\nAtoll Capital\n\nRoad\n\nReef Edge\n\nAtoll Administrative Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nM\na\np\n \n1\n\n\fMALDIVES\nDOMESTIC MARITIME TRANSPORT PROJECT\n\nExisting Breakwater\n\nMALE' NORTH HARBOUR\n\nFish\nMarket\nExtension\n(under\nconstruction)\n\nGovernment\nHarbour\n\nP\n\nr\n\no\n\np\n\no\n\ns\n\ne\n\nd\n\n \n\nQ\n\nu\n\na\n\n1\n\ny\n\n4\n\n \n\nM\n\n \n\nD\n\ne\n\ne\n\np\n\nt\n\ne\n\nr\n\ns\n\nS\n\nh\n\ne\n\nd\n\n0\n\n1 5 0   M e t e r s\n\nt\n\nh\n\n \n\n=\n\n \n\n-\n\n4\n\n \n\nM\n\ne\n\nt\n\ne\n\nr\n\ns\n\nH\n\nM C\n\nE\n\nR I V\n\nE     D\n\nR I N\n\nA\n\nM\n\ne t\n\nk\n\nr\n\nr\na l  M a\nn t e\nC e\n\nc\n\no\n\nL\n\n0\n6\n-\n4\n6\n4\n4\nb\n \nH\nR\n\nN\n\nMeters\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20 30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nM\na\np\n \n2\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  the  Maldives  for  the  Domestic  Maritime  Transport  Project1 (DMTP  or  the \nProject). \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nMaritime transport in the Maldives best compares to that of a road network in land-based \n2. \ncountries.  Well-developed  maritime  transport  infrastructure  and  capable  sector  institutions  are \nfundamental  to  sustained  social  and  economic  development  in  the  country.  The  proposed \nProject  was  included  in  the  country  strategy  and  program  update2 and  is  designed  to  address \nboth investment and institutional aspects in the sector.3 \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \n\n1. \n\nIntroduction \n\n3. \nThe Maldives gained independence in 1965 and became a republic in 1968. The country \nconsists  of  1,190  coral  islands,  with  a  total  land  area  of  approximately  250  square  kilometers \n(km2),  of  which  more  than  80%  is  less  than  1  meter  (m)  above  sea  level.  The  population  of \n298,8424 lives on less than 200 inhabited islands. The capital, Mal\u00e9, attracts more than 30% of \nthe population to its almost 2 km2 of land. Population density in Mal\u00e9\u2014more than 52,000 people \nper km2\u2014is one of the highest in the world. \n \n4. \nThe  Maldives  has  no  known  mineral  resources.  The  economic  base  is  narrow,  as  in \nother  small  island  economies,  and  relies  primarily  on  tourism  (33%  of  gross  domestic  product \n[GDP]  in  2004)  and  fisheries.  As  a  result  of  the  multiplier  effect  from  the  tourism  sector,  the \ntransport  and  communications  sector  accounted  for  approximately  15%  of  GDP  in  2004. \nDespite the limited resource base and lack of economies of scale, the Maldives had achieved \nimpressive  economic  growth  and  social  development,  with  average  GDP  growth  of  above  7% \nper annum and a GDP per capita income of above $2,500 prior to the December 2004 tsunami. \nSince  then,  economic  performance  has  deteriorated.  Tsunami-related  damage  is  estimated  at \nabout $470 million or about 62% of GDP. In 2005 compared to 2004, tourism arrivals dropped \n36%, and total budget expenditure increased by 40%, whereas total revenues increased by only \n6%.  The  economy  is  estimated  to  have  contracted  by  5.5%  in  2005.  Despite  recovery  in  the \ntourism sector, and the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MoFT) estimate of 18% GDP growth \nin  2006,  public  expenditure  levels  and  structural  issues\u2014including  diversification  of  the \neconomy and capacity constraints\u2014need to be addressed to ensure a sustainable return to pre-\ntsunami economic growth rates.  \n \n5. \nThe  geophysical  setting  of  the  Maldives  creates  a  critical  role  for  maritime  transport  in \nensuring  access  to  economic  and  social  development  opportunities.

Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Maldives for Preparing \n\nthe Domestic Maritime Transport Project. Manila (TA 4394-MLD). \n\n4  Maldives  Population  and  Housing  Census  2006,  Preliminary  Results,  Ministry  of  Planning  and  National \n\nDevelopment, Mal\u00e9, Maldives, 6 April 2006. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\neconomies  of  scale,  limited  economic  activity  in  remote  atolls  to  finance  travel  needs,  and \nadverse  seasonal  weather  conditions\u2014result  in  high  transport  cost  and  limited  transportation \nopportunities.  While  air transport  is gradually  developing,  maritime  transport  remains  the  most \nimportant transport mode in the country.  \n \n6. \nAbout 70% of the population lives in outer atolls, where the incidence of poverty is higher \nthan in the capital. Inequalities between Mal\u00e9 and the atolls increased in the period 1997\u20132004.5 \nLack of connectivity is an underlying cause of poverty, remoteness, and isolation in outer atolls; \nand is an impediment  to ensuring equitable opportunities and fairer distribution of income and \nwealth,  which  are  key  objectives  of  the  Government\u2019s  Seventh  National  Development  Plan \n(7NDP).6 \n \nMal\u00e9  North  Harbor  is  the  main  hub  for  interisland  transport  in  the  Maldives.  It  is  the \n7. \nlifeline  to  the  capital  for  the  outer  atoll  population  who  come  to  Mal\u00e9  to  source  vital  items \nnecessary for the survival of small communities in remote parts of the country. \n \n \n\nMaritime Transport Sector \n\n2. \n\n8. \nThe Government\u2019s direct role in the sector has focused on (i) provision of international \nand domestic maritime transport infrastructure; and (ii) regulation of domestic maritime transport \nservices in the areas of safety, vessel inspections, and vessel registrations.  \n \n\na. \n\nInternational Maritime Transport Infrastructure \n\nThe  limited  natural  resources  base  necessitates  substantial  imports  of  consumables, \n9. \nconstruction  materials,  manufactured  goods,  and  petroleum  products.  Until  2006,  most  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  imports  arrived  in  Mal\u00e9  Commercial  Harbor  (MCH), 7  which  is  located  on  the \nnorthwestern part of the capital island and operated by Maldives Ports Authority (MPA), a fully \nowned  government  entity  established  in  1986.  MPA  reports  to  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and \nCommunication  (MTC)  and  is  responsible  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  all \ncommercial  ports  in  the  Maldives,  including  the  two  regional  ports  commissioned  in  2006.  All \ninternational  trade  related  shipments  occur  through  the  commercial  ports.  MCH,  which  can \naccommodate ships up to 15,000 gross ton (GT) and has a 10.5 m draft, handled a throughput \nof 416,457 metric tons in 2005 (95% imports and 5% exports). About 40% of total imports are \nre-shipped to outer atolls, and 90% of this domestic interchange occurs via Mal\u00e9 North Harbor. \nMCH  currently  operates  above  capacity.  The  lack  of  space  available  on  Mal\u00e9,  especially  for \ncontainer storage and handling, severely constrains future expansion options and a relocation is \nbeing considered.  \n \n10. \nTo  ease  the  capacity  constraints  of  MCH,  and  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  national \ndevelopment  strategies  of  creating  regional  development  centers,  two  regional  ports  became \noperational in 2006: HD. Kulhuduffushi Regional Port in the Northern Development Region and \n                                                 \n5  Two vulnerability and poverty assessments were conducted in 1997 and 2004. \n6   The  7NDP  covers  the  period  2006\u20132010.  It  was  launched  with  the  first  working  draft  in  January  2006.  Upon \ncompletion  of  final  consultations  with  line  ministries,  the  7NDP  will  be  submitted  to  Cabinet  for  approval.  In  their \ncapacities as heads of line ministries, Cabinet ministers endorse the corresponding sector contents of the 7NDP. \nCabinet approval is expected by end April 2007. \n\n7   ADB  has  provided  assistance  to  the  development  of  MCH  through  two  loans:  (i)  ADB.  1988.

The regional ports cater \nto commercial import cargo and are designed to specifications that are markedly different from \nthe  vessel \ntransport. \nrequirements  and  harbor  specifications  of  domestic  maritime \nHD. Kulhuduffushi  Regional  Port  has  a  170  m  x  -5  m  quay  which  accommodates  ships  up  to \n1,000 GT, whereas S. Hithadhoo Regional Port accommodates ships up to 3,000 GT and has a \ndraft of 8 m.  \n \n\nb. \n\nDomestic Maritime Transport Infrastructure in Mal\u00e9  \n\n11.  Mal\u00e9, the national hub island, is rectangular in shape and has harbors on three of its four \nsides (Map 1). The harbors in Mal\u00e9 are used for distinctively different activities. Usage patterns \nare  codified  in  guidelines  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Construction  and  Public  Infrastructure \n(MCPI).8  \n \n12. \nThe harbor area relevant to the proposed Project is Mal\u00e9 North Harbor (Map 2), which is \nthe gateway to the capital for the outer atoll population and is reserved for inter-atoll passenger \nand  cargo  vessels.  The  harbor  currently  consists  of  a  quay  wall  of  200  m  along  Marine  Drive \nfrom the west side of the existing fish market up to the existing boundary wall of MCH. Vessels \nlonger than 20 m berth along the quay and discharge and load item by item using manual labor. \nVessels shorter than 20 m berth bows onto the quay. The harbor has an external seawall and \noffers  unused  space  with  potential  for  quay  wall  development  in  protected  waters.  At  present, \nthe  area  has  no  infrastructure  supporting  loading  and  unloading,  and  the  efficiency  of  its \noperations is hindered by lack of harbor management. Harbor management responsibilities for \nharbors located on the northern part of Mal\u00e9 up to Mal\u00e9 North West Harbor primarily rest with \nMCPI  with  inputs  from  the  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development  (MHUD),  MTC,  and \nMal\u00e9 Municipality. Detailed descriptions of the usage of each of the Mal\u00e9 harbors, as well as the \ninstitutional arrangements for harbor planning, construction, operation, and maintenance are in \nthe  sector  analysis  in  Appendix  2.  With  the  exception  of  MCH,  no  charges  for  loading  and \nunloading  are  currently  levied  for  the  use  of  harbors  on  the  northern  side  of  the  island.  O&M \ncosts are covered through the central budget.  \n \n\nc. \n\nMaritime Transport Services \n\n13. \nThe market structure for domestic maritime transport services consists of a mix of partly \npublic and private operation and ownership. The transport services sector is \u201con-demand\u201d based \nand  is  characterized  by  the  lack  of  a  system  of  regular,  scheduled  transport  passenger  and \ncargo  services\u2014in  particular  among  Mal\u00e9  and  outer  atolls.  Scheduled  transport  passenger \nservices  have  primarily  been  provided  by  the  Maldives  Transport  and  Contracting  Company \n(MTCC), 9  a  state-owned  enterprise.  The  passenger  and  cargo  transport  services  segment \nserved  by  individuals  or  island  communities  is  fragmented  and  lacks  sufficient  size  to  create \neconomies of scale.  \n \n\nd. \n\nFleet  \n\nTraditional  vessels  operated  by  individuals  or  island  communities  are  slow,  inefficient, \n14. \nand lacking in passenger facilities and safety features. Transit times are long and uncomfortable \nand passenger vessels only carry passengers who cannot afford air travel. Most of the vessels \n                                                 \n8   The most recent guidelines are in effect from 1 September 2006.  \n9  Some 52.5% of the shares in MTCC are held directly by the Government; another 7.5% of MTCC\u2019s shares are held \nby government-controlled companies, resulting in a total  government majority of 60%. Further details on MTCC\u2019s \ntransport services activities are in Appendix 2. \n\n  \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n(known as dhonis) in use for interisland passenger and cargo transport are wooden boats built \nby  hand  in  the  islands  without  design  work.  Medium-sized  dhonis  (12\u201325  m  long)  have  an \ninboard diesel engine of 80\u2013300 horsepower (hp), and a carrying capacity of 10\u201350 ton and/or \n35\u2013175 passengers.  Larger  dhonis  (26\u201335  m  long)  have  an  inboard  diesel  engine  of  250\u2013\n600 hp, and a carrying capacity of 55\u2013200 ton and/or 135\u2013225 passengers. The past usage of \ncombined  passenger  and  cargo  vessels  is  undergoing  a  change  toward  separation  of  vessel \nuse  for  passengers  and  cargo,  combined  with  an  increase  in  the  use  of  larger  cargo  vessels. \nFiberglass  is  gradually  replacing  wood  in  vessel  construction.  The  vessel  registration  system \noperated and maintained by MTC underwent comprehensive reform in 2002, and was finalized \na few months before the December 2004 tsunami. The total number of vessels registered has \nsince recovered and reached 90% of the pre-tsunami figures in December 2006. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n \n\n1. \n\nChallenges \n\n15.  Mal\u00e9 North  Harbor is the lifeline access point to the social and economic development \nopportunities available in the capital for 70% of the population who live in outer atolls, where the \nhighest  incidence  of  poverty  occurs.  By  providing  connectivity  to  the  capital  for  the  outer  atoll \npopulation,  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  serves  a  fundamental  social  need  and  is  the  most  important \ninterisland  transport  hub  in  the  Maldives.  Despite  the  potential  relocation  of  MCH  and  the \ncommissioning of the two regional ports in 2006, Mal\u00e9\u2019s current status as the center of imports \nand related interisland commerce\u2014based on the \u201chub and spoke\u201d system, with the hub in Mal\u00e9 \nand  the  spokes  radiating  out  from  Mal\u00e9\u2014is  likely  to  be  retained  for  the  expected  operational \nperiod of the proposed Project. 90% of imports for consumption by the outer atoll population is \nredistributed through Mal\u00e9 North Harbor; and 90% of cargo in the form of dried fish, agricultural \nproducts,  and  local  handicrafts  from  outer  atolls  to  Mal\u00e9  for  either  export  or  sale  and/or \nredistribution in Mal\u00e9 also occurs through Mal\u00e9 North Harbor.  \n \n \n16. \nCongestion  in  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  is  chronic.  The  current  situation,  which  constitutes  a \nbottleneck for the outer atoll population\u2019s entry to the capital, is a result of the combined effects \nof lack of capacity and harbor management. The lack of capacity results in multilayer berthing. \nLarger vessels, which are not designed for front or stern loading and unloading, frequently moor \nin  four  to  five  layers  and  initiate  unloading  and  loading  activities  across  adjacent  boats. \nConsiderable time savings, which are assumed to translate into increased passenger and cargo \nvessel calls at Mal\u00e9 North Harbor, could be achieved if these vessels were able to moor directly \nalongside the quay. Congestion also arises because of lack of harbor management. Vessels are \ntraditionally  converted  into  commercial  and  storage  facilities  rather  than  means  of  transport \nduring the period spent in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor. It is common practice that outer atoll vessels wait \nin  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  until  sufficient  cargo  and  passengers  have  been  ensured  to  justify  a \nprofitable  return  trip.  This  practice  results  in  extended  waiting  time,  severe  congestion,  and \nsignificant  losses  to  vessel  owners.  Combined  with  inadequate  institutional  frameworks,  the \nabove factors impede access to the social and economic development opportunities offered in \nMal\u00e9, and increase transport cost. Existing congestion in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor will be exacerbated \nby projected growth in demand for both cargo and passenger interisland transport services.  \n \n17.  Multiple  ministries  and  agencies  are  involved  in  sector  decisions.  The  main  ministries \nare  MTC  and  MCPI.  MTC  has  primary  responsibility  for  international  and  domestic  maritime \ntransport  infrastructure and  services,  including formulation  of  transport policies  and  regulation, \nestablishment  of  safety  standards,  and  conducting  surveys  and  registration  of  vessels.  Apart \nfrom MPA\u2019s activities, MTC\u2019s sector involvement has focused on policy and regulatory aspects \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nof  domestic  maritime  transport  services.  MCPI  is  the  primary  ministry  responsible  for \nconstruction of infrastructure in the Maldives. MCPI\u2019s Public Works Services (PWS) Section is \nresponsible  for  the  O&M  of  domestic  harbors  within  Mal\u00e9.  PWS  also  sets  and  collects  harbor \nusage charges in Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor. Organizational diagrams of MTC and MCPI are in \nSupplementary Appendixes B and C. To achieve the long-term objective of ensuring an efficient \nsector structure through separation of policy, planning, and regulatory functions from operational \nactivities,  there  is  a  need  for  organizational  realignment  and  clarification  of  roles  and \nresponsibilities among government agencies. \n \n \n\nOpportunities \n\n2. \n\n18. \nCapacity enhancements to Mal\u00e9 North Harbor will increase connectivity to Mal\u00e9 for the \nouter  atoll  population  and  enhance  their  opportunities  for  participation  in  economic  and  social \nactivities. In combination with the introduction of enhanced harbor management and supporting \ninstitutional frameworks, capacity in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor will be expanded through the investment \ncomponent  of  the  proposed  Project  by  provision  of  (i)  additional  berthing  space  to  eliminate \nwaiting  time;  (ii)  improved  cargo  handling;  (iii)  increased  basin  depth,  allowing  entry  of  larger \nvessels;  (iv)  a  transit  area  for  passengers  and  goods;  and  (v)  an  off-road  area  for  cargo \naccumulation  and  transfer  from  trucks  to  vessels.  Expanded  harbor  capacity  will  (i)  reduce \ntransport costs, (ii) directly benefit transport operators and producers of products in outer atolls \nfor  sale  and/or  redistribution  in  Mal\u00e9,  and  (iii)  ultimately  benefit  consumers  through  increased \ninterisland trade. Reduced congestion in Marine Drive will benefit all road users. \n \n19. \nThe  introduction  of  harbor  usage  charges  for  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  and  Vilin\u2019gili  Harbor \nsupported under the DMTP, in addition to the existing charges in Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor, will \nfacilitate self-sustaining operations and will act as an incentive to ensure efficient usage across \nharbors.  \n \nThe Government fully recognizes that provision of transport infrastructure will not in itself \n20. \nensure  a  socially  responsible  and  sustainable  sector;  and  that  policy,  institutional,  and \nregulatory frameworks can assist in achieving these goals. Initiatives are ongoing to realign the \norganizational  structure  of  MTC  to  its  sector  mandate.  These  efforts  need  to  be  supported.  A \nrealignment carried out on the basis of the agreed sector focus areas (Appendix 3) will assist in \nimproving  development  of  sector  policies,  integrating  planning  activities,  and  increasing \ncoordination among sector agencies. Simultaneous provision of capacity building assistance for \nthe development of strategic planning, policy, and key sector regulatory skills\u2014in the areas of \nestablishment of harbor usage charges across Mal\u00e9 and improved maritime safety regulations\u2014\nwill  enhance  MTC\u2019s  organizational  performance.  Because  of  its  increased  responsibilities  for \nO&M of maritime transport infrastructure assets provided under DMTP, MCPI\u2019s capacity needs \nto be enhanced in the areas of harbor management, financial management training, and project \nmanagement training. \n \n \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\n3. \n\nJapan  has  provided  substantial  bilateral  assistance  to  construction  of  breakwaters  and \n21. \nseawalls  around  Mal\u00e9.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  assistance  to \ndomestic  maritime  transport  infrastructure  and  transport  services,  and  for  development  of  a \ntransport  master  plan  (paras.  22\u201323).  The  Kuwait  Fund  for  Arab  Economic  Development \n(KFAED)  has  supported  the  development  of  commercial  ports  through  assistance  to  the \nestablishment  of  the  two  regional  ports  in  HD.  Kulhuduffushi  and  in  S.  Hithadhoo.  The  World \nBank is currently providing assistance though the Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility \n\n  \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nfor  rehabilitation  of  maritime \n\n(PPIAF)  to  explore  options  for  a  relocation  of  MCH  on  a  public\u2013private  partnership  basis. \nAssistance \nthe \nDecember 2004  tsunami  has  been  provided,  in  particular  through  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Cooperation  (JBIC)  and  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP).  A \nsummary of external assistance to the maritime transport sector is in Appendix 4. \n \n \n\ninfrastructure  damaged  during \n\nLessons  \n\ntransport \n\n4. \n\nADB  has  provided  assistance  to  the  transport  sector  through  four  loans. 10  The \n22. \nInterisland  Transport  Project, 11  approved  in  1981,  aimed  at  introducing  a  reliable  publicly \noperated  transportation  service  between  Mal\u00e9  and  atoll  islands  to  improve  the  efficiency  and \nsafety of interisland transport. The Project was rated \u201cunsuccessful\u201d12 because of a number of \nreasons,  including:  (i)  lack  of  a  regional  development  plan  and  interisland  transport  statistics; \n(ii) inadequate assessment of the informal sector; (iii) lack of outer island harbor infrastructure; \nand  (iv)  low  cargo  collections  in  addition  to  overpowered  vessel  engines,  which  resulted  in \nunsustainable  operating  costs.  Development  of  MCH  has  been  supported  through  two  ADB \nloans:  Mal\u00e9  Port  Development  Project,13 approved  in  1988;  and  Second  Mal\u00e9  Port  Project,14 \napproved  in  1993.  Both  loans  included  investment  components  to  relieve  the  congestion  at \nMCH through infrastructure enhancements and institutional support to MPA. The fourth loan to \nthe  transport  sector,  the  Multi-Project  Loan, 15  approved  in  1984,  included  infrastructure \ninvestments to support deepening of priority island harbors.  \n \nIn  2002,  ADB  provided  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  a  Transport  Master  Plan,16 whose \n23. \nobjectives  included  development  of  transport  policies,  strategies,  regulatory  framework, \ninvestment  programs,  and  activities  necessary  for  ensuring  a  nationwide  integrated  transport \nnetwork.  The  December  2004  tsunami  led  to  an  urgent  reconsideration  of  nationwide \ninfrastructure  investment  priorities. The  draft  final  report  submitted  under  the  TA  was  found  to \ncontain  useful  input  for  future  transport  planning  activities,  and  to  have  assisted  in  creating \ncapacity necessary for the future preparation of master plans.17  \n \n24. \nLessons from ADB involvement in the transport sector illustrate that past assistance for \nphysical infrastructure investments, supported by institutional capacity enhancement measures, \nhas  been  successful.  The  project-specific  approach  applied  in  the  Mal\u00e9  Port  Development \nProject,  Second  Mal\u00e9  Port  Project,  and  Multi-Project  Loan\u2014focusing  the  project  scope  on  a \nvery well defined area of activity supported by advisory services for both design and institutional \ndevelopment purposes\u2014has worked well. These lessons have been incorporated in the design \nof the proposed Project.  \n \n                                                 \n10  In  addition,  the  Tsunami  Emergency  Assistance  Project  included  a  transport  component  of  $2.90  million  for  the \n\nreconstruction of harbor infrastructure.  \n\n11  ADB.  1981.

The study was submitted to ADB in April 2006.  \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n\n5. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n25. \nThe  Government\u2019s  7NDP  outlines  a  development  path  based  on  economic  growth, \nsocial equity, poverty reduction, environmental protection, and good governance. It provides a \npolicy  framework  for  realizing  the  long-term  goals  of  the  President\u2019s  Vision  2020.18 The  plan, \nwhich  is  a  continuation  of  the  strategies  and  lessons  from  the  implementation  of  the  Sixth \nNational  Development  Plan  (6NDP),  focuses  on  the  creation  of  equitable  opportunities  and \nfairer distribution of income and wealth.  \n \n26. \nRecognizing  the  paramount  importance  of  the  maritime  transport  sector  in  ensuring \npopulation-wide access to social and economic development opportunities, the 7NDP includes \n12 policies with supporting sub-strategies in the form of a combined land and sea transport road \nmap.  Considering  the  lifeline  characteristics  of  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor,  the  highest  prioritized \ninvestment proposal in the land and sea transport road map is improvement through provision of \nloading  and  unloading  areas  and  new  berthing  facilities  in  this  harbor.  The  road  map  also \nincludes  (i)  institutional  changes  to  improve  the  overall  management  and  efficiency  of  the \ntransport sector, including strengthening MTC\u2019s maritime transport functions; (ii) harmonization \nof  harbor  charges  in  Mal\u00e9;  (iii)  development  of  the  sector\u2019s  human  resources  base  through \ncapacity  building;  (iv)  improvement  of  safety  measures,  including  marine  navigation  aids;  and \n(v) enhancing harbor management capacity in Mal\u00e9.  \n \n \n\nADB Strategy \n\n6. \n\n27. \nADB  shares  the  Government\u2019s  view  of  the  importance  of  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  within  the \ncountry\u2019s socioeconomic context. Therefore, assistance to improve the country\u2019s main inter-atoll \ntransport hub constitutes the core investment of the proposed Project, which was included in the \ncountry  strategy  and  program  update.19 ADB  supports  the  Government\u2019s  policy  of  maintaining \nownership  and  operation  of  domestic  maritime  transport  infrastructure  in  the  short  to  medium \nterm. ADB further supports the Government\u2019s long-term sector objectives of ensuring separation \nof maritime transport sector policy, planning, and regulatory functions from operational activities; \nthe ongoing realignment initiatives in MTC; and the strategic directions outlined in the 7NDP to \nintroduce  efficiency  and  sustainability  targets  to  enhance  public  sector  provision  of  domestic \nmaritime transport infrastructure. These sector objectives are supported under the loan through \nthe institutional development and capacity building component.  \n\n28. \nLack of access to finance has been identified as a major obstacle for increased private \nsector  participation  in  the  domestic  maritime  transport  services  sector.  In  line  with  the  policy \ndirection  outlined  in  the  7NDP\u2014to  strengthen  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in  the  provision  of \ntransport  services\u2014ADB  is  currently  exploring  options  for  inclusion  of  financial  assistance  to \nprivate vessel owners under the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development Project.20 In \naddition, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department is exploring options for providing a loan \nto  the  Maldives  Finance  Leasing  Company  Pvt.  Ltd.,  which  offers  leasing  facilities  to  private \nvessel  owners  against  security,  as  part  of  a  proposed  loan  to  the  South  Asia  SME  Leasing \nFacility.  \n \n\n                                                 \n18  Vision 2020 was outlined by the President in his Independence Day address on 26 July 1999. \n19  Footnote 2. \n20 ADB.  2005.

Manila.  \n\n  \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nDMTP will help ensure sustained equitable and regionally balanced economic growth by \n29. \nproviding  enhanced  access  to  markets  and  social  services  for  the  outer  atoll  population.  The \nimpact will be attained by enabling improvements to the country\u2019s main inter-atoll transport hub, \nincluded  as  the  highest  ranked  land  and  sea  infrastructure  investment  priority  in  the  7NDP, \nsupported  by  institutional  and  capacity  building  initiatives  in  the  domestic  maritime  transport \nsector. The expanded capacity of Mal\u00e9 North Harbor will improve connectivity, reduce transport \ncost, and facilitate interisland trade. It is expected that the expanded capacity will increase Mal\u00e9 \nNorth  Harbor\u2019s  contribution  to  GDP  by  0.1%  by  2015.  The  increase  in  interisland  trade  is \nexpected  to  result  in  a  10%  volume  increase  in  key  outputs  of  domestic  agricultural  produce \nsold  in  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  markets  by  2014.  The  improved  services  of  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  will \nreduce  congestion  and  increase  the  amount  of  larger  vessels  calling.  The  total  time  spent  in \nMal\u00e9 North Harbor by small vessels is expected to be reduced from an average of 10 days to \n8 days by early 2014, i.e., after 5 years of operation. The total time spent by larger vessels is \nexpected to decrease from an average of 15 days to 13 days by early 2014. Average traffic flow \nthrough  (defined  by  the  number  of  vehicles  passing  through  a  given  point)  on  Marine  Drive \nalong Mal\u00e9 North Harbor is expected to increase by 25% by 2014 because of additional drive-on \nthe  Project.  To  ensure \naccess  and  cargo  handling  quay  surface  constructed  under \nsustainability, and in line with the Government\u2019s policy directions, the institutional development \nand  capacity  building  component  will  result  in  (i)  an  action  plan  for  institutional  alignment  of \nMTC\u2019s  maritime  transport  activities  in  line  with  its  sector  mandate;  (ii)  an  action  plan  for  the \nintroduction of harbor usage charges; (iii) an action plan for recommended changes to maritime \nsafety  regulations,  vessel  inspections,  and  registration  procedures;  and  (iv)  an  action  plan  for \nimprovements to financial management systems.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n30. \nThe  Project  will  enhance  the  capacity  of  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  through  construction  of \nadditional  quay  wall,  provision  of  cargo  handling  equipment,  and  construction  of  a  temporary \ntransit  area  for  goods  and  passengers.  The  institutional  capacity  of  MTC  and  MCPI  will  be \nstrengthened  through  the  inputs  provided  under  the  infrastructure  investment  consulting,  and \nthe  institutional  development  and  capacity  building  components.  Capacity  building  within  MTC \nwill focus on the areas of (i) strategic planning and policy analysis, (ii) establishment of harbor \nusage  charges,  (iii)  maritime  safety  regulations  and  vessel  inspection  and  registration \nprocedures, and (iv) project performance and impact monitoring. Capacity building within MCPI \nwill  focus  on  enhancing  its  ability  to  manage,  operate,  and  maintain  maritime  transport \ninfrastructure in Mal\u00e9 in a sustainable manner through (i) harbor management, and (ii) financial \nmanagement training. \n \n \n\nInfrastructure Investment Component \n\n1. \n\nThe  civil  works  component  of  the  Project  consists  of  the  construction  of  a  290  m  L-\n31. \nshaped quay. The main part of the quay, projecting northwards at right angles to Marine Drive \n(Bodu Thakurufaanu Magu), will be 140 m long and 30 m wide. The eastward leg of the quay, \nplaced along and inside the existing breakwater, will be 150 m long and 11 m wide (Map 2 and \nSupplementary  Appendix D).  The  quay  wall  will  provide  additional  space  for  vessels  to  moor \nand undertake unloading and loading activities, while the quay surface will provide 6,600 square \nmeters  (m2)  of  additional  drive-on  access  and  cargo  handling.  A  covered  shelter  of  480  m2  to \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nprotect passengers and cargo in transit will also be provided. The quay wall depth will be -4.0 m \nto cater to the anticipated increase in the use of larger vessels. When operations begin on the \nnew quay, loading and unloading of cargo at the existing 200 m quay wall along Marine Drive \nwill be restricted in order to reduce vehicle congestion.  \n \n32. \nThe proposed harbor quay walls are comprised of sheet piling and reinforced concrete \ncapping  beams,  finished  with  precast  interlocking  concrete  paving  blocks.  This  quay  wall \nconstruction method has been used successfully with minimum maintenance costs in both MCH \nand Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor. The method is assessed to suit the unique environment of these \nharbors  and  would  also  be  suitable  for  the  proposed  Project  in  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor.  The \nstructural  stability  of  the  quay  walls  are  maintained  by  an  anchoring  system.  The  Mal\u00e9  North \nHarbor  structure  will  be  further  studied  and  designed  in  detail  under  the  infrastructure \ninvestment  consulting  component  in  accordance  with  the  standards  and  regulations  of  MCPI; \nMal\u00e9 Municipality; Ministry of Environment, Energy and Water (MEEW); Maldives Housing and \nUrban  Development  Board;  and  all  relevant  stakeholders.  The  level  of  the  quay  area  will  be \nmaintained in line with Marine Drive. A comprehensive land use plan will be completed during \nthe detailed design to ensure optimum use of the quay area and ensure accessibility to the main \nroad.  The  land  use  plan  will  include  loading  and  unloading  zones,  and  pedestrian  zones \nensuring  the  safety  of  passengers  using  interisland  ferries.  The  detailed  harbor  design  also \nincludes  usage  of  cranes,  transit  shelters  for  cargo  and  passengers,  pedestrian  and  vehicular \ncontrol  arrangements  with  gates,  fencing,  and  guard  post.  The  quay  will  be  equipped  with \nmooring bollards and fenders to protect both quay walls and vessels. Adequate elevated lighting \nwill be provided to allow for 24-hour operation, as in Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor. \n \n \n\nInstitutional Development and Capacity Building Component \n\n2. \n\n33. \nThe  Government  has  requested  that  institutional  development  and  capacity  building \nsupport  be  provided  under  the  DMTP  to  support  the  gradual  implementation  of  the  long-term \nsector  objectives  of  ensuring  separation  of  maritime  transport  sector  policy,  planning,  and \nregulatory  functions  from  operational  activities.  To  support  MTC\u2019s  sector  responsibilities  and \nensure the sustainability of the investment, the  institutional development and capacity building \ncomponent  includes  assistance  to  (i)  enhance  current  efforts  to  align  MTC\u2019s  organizational \nstructure  to  its  sector  mandate,  particularly  focusing  on  policy,  planning,  and  regulatory \nfunctions of international and domestic maritime transport infrastructure and domestic maritime \ntransport  services;  and  (ii)  capacity  building  within  MTC  in  the  areas  of:  (a)  strategic  planning \nand policy analysis, (b) establishment of harbor usage charges, (c) maritime safety regulations \nand  vessel  inspection  and  registration  procedures,  and  (d)  project  performance  and  impact \nmonitoring. \n \n34. \nIn the short to medium term, operational responsibilities for domestic maritime transport \ninfrastructure are to remain with MCPI, according to the Government\u2019s strategy. Assistance to \nenhance  MCPI\u2019s  harbor  management  capacity  is  included  under  the  institutional  development \nand  capacity  building  component  as  follows:  capacity  building  within  MCPI  to  enable  it  to \nmanage,  operate,  and  maintain  maritime  transport  infrastructure  in  Mal\u00e9  in  a  sustainable \nmanner through (i) harbor management, and (ii) financial management training.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nDMTP  combines  core  social  dimensions  with  sustainability  through  the  introduction  of \n35. \nharbor usage charges for Mal\u00e9 North Harbor and Vilin\u2019gili Harbor, at levels that will ensure full \nrecovery  of  O&M  costs  within  4  years  after  project  completion.  The  development  of  harbor \n\n  \n\n\fthe  Project\u2014is  expected \n\nusage  charges\u2014under  a  transparent  and  formal  process  delineating  regulatory  functions  from \noperational activities, in combination with enhanced harbor management practices as proposed \nunder \ntransport \ninfrastructure  in  the  capital.  Anchoring  these  project  elements  within  institutional  capacity \nbuilding  support  forms  an  integrated  sector  approach  to  solve  the  congestion  of  Mal\u00e9  North \nHarbor  in  a  holistic  manner;  ensure  timely  project  implementation,  enhance  long-term \ninstitutional and human resources sector capabilities and guarantee asset preservation. \n \nD. \n\nincrease  effective  utilization  of  maritime \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nto \n\n36. \nThe Project\u2019s total investment costs are estimated at $6.65 million, including taxes and \nduties.

MoFT  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project.  A  project  steering  committee \n(PSC) will be established for the Project, chaired by the minister of MTC, with representatives at \ndirector  levels  from  MoFT,  MCPI,  MEEW,  Ministry  of  Planning  and  National  Development \n(MPND),  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development  (MHUD),  Mal\u00e9  Municipality  and  other \nrelevant agencies as necessary. The PSC will provide overall policy and operational advice and \nguidance to the Project. The PSC will meet as often as necessary, but at least quarterly, and will \nhold its first meeting within 3 months of loan effectiveness. The Implementing Agency (IA) will \nbe MTC. The project management unit (PMU) will be located in the IA and will be headed by the \nexecutive director of planning and projects in MTC as project director. The project director will \nserve as secretary to the PSC and will appoint the heads of the two project implementation units \n(PIUs) to be established in MTC and MCPI. The PMU will be staffed with (i) a senior transport \npolicy  and  planning  specialist,  (ii)  a  transport  policy  and  planning  specialist,  (iii)  a  senior \ntransport  project  management  specialist,  and  (iv)  a  transport  project  management  specialist. \nThe  MTC  PIU  will  be  headed  by  a  senior  transport  policy  and  planning  specialist;  it  will  be \nstaffed with (i) a policy and planning expert, and (ii) a regulatory expert. The MCPI PIU will be \nheaded  by  a  senior  engineer  and  be  staffed  with  (i)  a  design  approval  engineer;  (ii)  a \nsupervision  engineer,  including  environmental  coordination;  and  (iii)  a  project  accountant.  The \nstaffing  arrangements  for  the  PMU  and  PIUs  will  be  in  place  at  the  latest  within  1  month \nfollowing  loan  effectiveness.  The  implementation  arrangements  are  in  Appendix  6.  MTC  has \nimplemented  foreign-aided  capital  projects  in  the  past.  With  support  provided  under  the \ninstitutional  development  and  capacity  building  component,  MTC  is  assessed  to  have  the \ncapacity  to  efficiently  administer  the  loan  and  implement  the  Project.  MCPI  is  responsible  for \nconstruction of all infrastructure facilities in the Maldives and has substantial experience in this \nfield. To facilitate compliance with ADB\u2019s procurement and project management requirements, \ncapacity  building  in  these  areas  is  included  in  the  infrastructure  investment  consulting \ncomponent.  \n \n \n\nImplementation Period \n\n2. \n\n39. \nDMTP  will  be  implemented  over  24  months,  including  pre-construction  activities.  The \nscheduled  completion  date  for  the  Project  is  30  June  2009.  The  proposed  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n \n\nProcurement \n\n3. \n\n40. \nThe MCPI PIU head will be responsible for all procurement activities. All contracts will be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2006,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime). The Project includes one civil works contract of $3.89 million covering all harbor and land \nworks,  as  well  as  cargo  handling  facilities,  which  will  be  procured  through  single  stage:  one \nenvelope  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  without  prequalification  procedures,  with  prior \nreview by ADB. Bidders will be given 6 weeks for preparation and submission of bids. Indicative \ncontract packages for the Project, including consulting services, are in the procurement plan in \nAppendix 8.  \n \n\n  \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n41. \nInternational  and  national  consultants,  to  be  engaged  by  the  Government,  will  assist \nMTC  and  MCPI  in  implementing  the  Project.  All  international  and  national  consultants  will  be \nengaged  in accordance with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2006,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  Consultant  services  will  be  required  for  both  the  infrastructure  investment \nand  the  institutional  development  and  capacity  building  components.  For  the  infrastructure \ninvestment consulting component, which includes environmental monitoring, consulting services \nwill be provided for (i) detailed design, (ii) preparation of tender documents, (iii) bid evaluation \nsupport, (iv) construction site supervision, and (v) project management assistance. Two groups \nof  international  and  national  consultants\u2014the  design  and  supervision  group,  and  the  project \nmanagement  assistance  group\u2014will  be  engaged  by  the  Government  through  a  firm  over  21 \nmonths  in  one  contract  package  of  25  person-months  international  and  15  person-months \nnational input. MCPI PIU will ensure the availability of office space within MCPI offices prior to \nthe  mobilization  of  consultants.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  infrastructure  investment \nconsulting component,  which  will  be  selected on  the  basis  of  quality  and  cost-based  selection \n(QCBS) based on biodata technical proposals, are in Appendix 9.  \n \n42. \nFor  the  institutional  development  and  capacity  building  component,  a  team  of \ninternational  and  national  consultants  will  be  engaged  through  a  firm,  intermittently  over \n21 months for 25.5 person-months of international input and 18 person-months of national input. \nThe  consultant  firm  will  be  selected  through  QCBS,  based  on  simplified  technical  proposals. \nMTC  PIU  will  ensure  the  availability  of  office  space  within  MTC  offices  prior  to  mobilization  of \nthe  consultants.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  institutional  development  and  capacity \nbuilding  component  are  in  Appendix  10.  The  Government  requested  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  the \nadvance  actions  necessary  to  facilitate  recruitment  of  consultants  immediately  after  loan \neffectiveness.  The  Government  has  been  informed  that  ADB\u2019s  support  of  advance  contracting \ndoes not commit ADB to approve the loan for the Project or to finance the recruitment costs.  \n \n \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Measures to Enhance Governance \n\n5. \n\n43. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the EA, the IA, and the PIUs and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n44. \nThe  Project  will  introduce  additional  specific  measures  to  enhance  governance  and \nprevent  corruption.  Such  measures  include,  but  are  not  limited  to  (i)  continued  consultant \nsupport  to  MCPI  PIU  staff  on  procurement  and  project  management;  (ii)  harbor  management \ntraining  for  MCPI  PIU  staff,  including  training  in  collection  of  harbor  usage  charges;  and \n(iii) improving  financial  management  systems  and  practices.  Specific  measures  to  increase \ntransparency  under  the  Project  include  random  and  independent  spot  checks  by  ADB  review \nmissions  on  procurement  and  financial  project  accounts.  The  Government  will  ensure  that \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nprocurement of all civil works necessary for the Project will be undertaken by the Government \nthrough the Tender Evaluation Board.21  \n \n \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n6. \n\n45. \nLoan  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook, \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  between  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  For  both  works  and  consulting  services,  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed \nusing ADB\u2019s direct payment procedures. \n \n \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n7. \n\nThe PMU and PIUs will each maintain separate project records and accounts adequate \n46. \nto  identify  goods  and  services  financed  from  loan  proceeds,  financing  resources  received, \nexpenditures  incurred, and  use  of  local  funds. All  project  accounting  systems  will be  set  up  in \naccordance with sound accounting principles and practices in line with national or international \nstandards. Annual project accounts and related financial statements, consolidated at the PMU \nlevel,  will  be  subject  to  an  annual  external  audit  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  annual \naudit  report  will  include  an  opinion  on  use  of  loan  proceeds,  compliance  with  covenants,  and \ndiscrepancies  in  accounting  records  or  policies,  if  any.  The  EA  will  monitor  project  accounting \nsystems  and  reports  at  the  PMU  and  PIUs,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  the  annual  audited \nfinancial statements and project accounts, audit reports, and management letters in English no \nlater than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year during project implementation. The EA, in \nconjunction with the PMU, will also provide quarterly project progress reports in accordance with \nthe project performance monitoring system (PPMS) framework.  \n \n \n\nResult-Based Strategic Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n8. \n\nThe  design  and  monitoring  framework  indicators  and  PPMS  have  been  discussed  and \n47. \nthe Government agrees that indicators of project impact should relate to volume increase in key \noutputs of domestic agricultural produce sold in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor markets. The relevance and \npracticability  of  indicator  data  collection  has  been  confirmed  by  the  Government.  MTC, \nsupported by the consultants engaged under subcomponent 2 of the institutional development \nand  capacity  building  component,  will  develop  a  comprehensive  PPMS  framework  to  monitor \nactivities, analyze and consolidate the data, and provide quarterly PPMS monitoring reports for \nsubmission to ADB until project completion. The PPMS framework will include the requirements \nfor ADB project progress reports as well as data for socioeconomic and environmental impact \nindicators22 to measure project impacts at the beginning of project implementation and allow for \nquarterly  reporting  on  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP).  The \nPPMS  framework  will  be  refined  to  confirm  achievable  targets,  monitoring  arrangements,  and \nwill be finalized no later than 6 months after project inception, i.e., by mid-December 2007. After \nproject  completion,  evaluation  surveys  will  be  conducted  annually  and  submitted  to  ADB  for \n5 years after project completion. The project completion report will be prepared within 3 months \nafter the physical completion of the Project. The report will include a detailed evaluation of the \nProject  covering  the  design,  costs,  contractors  and  consultant\u2019s  performance,  social  and \neconomic  impact,  economic  rate  of  return,  and  other  details  relating  to  the  Project  as  may  be \nrequested by ADB. \n                                                 \n21  The  Maldives  has  a  centralized  procurement  system  for  all  goods  and  services  across  all  sectors  through  its \nTender  Evaluation  Board  established  under  MoFT.  The  Tender  Evaluation  Board  has  experience  with \nimplementation of projects funded by international development institutions. \n\n22 Environmental quality indicators have been identified in the initial environmental examination (IEE).   \n\n  \n\n\f14 \n\n \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n\n48. \nA  project  inception  mission  will  be  fielded  soon  after  loan  effectiveness.  Thereafter, \nregular  reviews  will  be  conducted  annually  or  more  frequently  as  required  for  effective  project \nimplementation. In June 2008, a midterm review by the Government and ADB will consider the \nProject\u2019s  progress  and  agree  on  any  changes  in  scope  or  implementation  required  to  achieve \nthe Project\u2019s intended impact. The EA and IA will monitor project implementation and keep ADB \ninformed of any significant deviations that may result in the schedule not being met. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS  \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n49. \nThe DMTP will support the domestic maritime transport sector by (i) relieving congestion \nin  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor,  the  most  important  interisland  transport  hub  in  the  country;  and \n(ii) supporting  long-term  sector  objectives  of  separating  policy,  planning,  and  regulatory \nfunctions  from  operational  responsibilities  through  the  institutional  development  and  capacity \nbuilding  component.  The  Project  will  assist  in  ensuring  increased  opportunities  for  70%  of  the \npopulation residing in outer atolls to participate in economic activities in Mal\u00e9. By reducing time \nspent in the Mal\u00e9 North Harbor, total transit time for travel between outer atolls and the capital \nwill  be  reduced,  resulting  in  passenger  and  inventory  cost  savings  as  well  as  an  increase  in \nagricultural produce originating from outer islands in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor markets. The reduction \nof vessel turnaround time in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor will lead to increased frequency of service and \nsafer  traveling  conditions  for  the  atoll  community  and  thus  benefit  the  poorest  section  of  the \npopulation.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  remove  the  principal  cause  of  congestion  on  Marine \nDrive, a major Mal\u00e9 road corridor, benefiting all road and vessel users. \n \nConsulting  activities  included  under  the  infrastructure  investment  consulting  and  the \n50. \ninstitutional  development  and  capacity  building  components  are  designed  to  mitigate  gaps \nidentified  in  institutional  and  human  resources  capabilities,  and  to  support  the  creation  of \ncapacity to handle sector issues in the long term. Technical support is provided during project \nimplementation to assist in (i) development of harbor usage charges; and (ii) establishment of \nformal,  regular,  and  transparent  processes  for  setting  harbor  usage  charges.  Harbor  usage \ncharges are expected to positively impact financial O&M cost recovery for existing infrastructure \nassets in Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor and Vilin\u2019gili Harbor as well as project-created assets. MTC\u2019s \ncapacity  will  be  strengthened  in  the  areas  of  (i)  strategic  planning  and  policy  analysis, \n(ii) maritime  safety  regulations  and  vessel  inspections  and  registration  procedures,  and \n(iii) monitoring  of  project  impact  and  performance.  MCPI\u2019s  capacity  in  the  areas  of  (i)  harbor \nmanagement, and (ii) financial management will be enhanced under the Project.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n51. \nThe  economic  evaluation  compares  the  cost  and  benefits  of  the  Project  from  the \nviewpoint of the national economy by comparing the cost of the Project by identified beneficiary \ngroups:  (i)  passengers  and  cargo  owners,  and  (ii)  vessel  owners.  If  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  is  not \nimproved, the main consequence for the economy would be the loss of prospective benefits for \nexisting harbor users. Because of the current congestion caused by the heavy concentration of \ntraffic,  delays  and  time  loss  represent  the  most  significant  factor.  Annual  user  benefits  to \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\npassengers and cargo owners immediately after completion of construction exceed $0.2 million, \nwith vessel-owner benefits reaching more than $0.5 million. The annual benefits streams, which \nexceed $1.8 million per year by 2019, are compared with the total capital cost of $4.43 million. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 22.5%. Sensitivity and risk analysis \nindicate that the EIRR is robust under all conditions. A summary of the economic analysis is in \nAppendix 11 and detailed economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\n2. \n\n52. \nThe  financial  analysis  appraises  the  sustainability  and  viability  of  proposed  project \ninvestments in accordance with Financial Management and Analysis of Projects23 on a with- and \nwithout-Project  basis.  A  summary  of  the  financial  analysis  is  in  Appendix  12  and  detailed \nfinancial  analysis  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  Financial  projections  up  to  2033  for  Mal\u00e9 \nNorth  Harbor,  comprising  the  existing  200  m  quay  wall  along  Marine  Drive  and  the  proposed \n290 m quay to be developed under the Project, include assumptions for both cost and revenue. \nCost  assumptions  include  O&M  cost,  annual,  and  one-off  maintenance  costs.  Revenue \nassumptions  include  a  preliminary  analysis  of  likely  harbor  usage  charges.  Proposed  harbor \nusage  charges  vary  from  Rf4  to  Rf5  per  meter  per  day.  Impact  assessments  suggest  a  net \npositive  benefit  under  this  proposed  structure.  Details  of  harbor  usage  charge  analysis  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix G.  \n \n53. \nUnder  the  above  assumptions,  a  base  case,  after  tax,  financial  internal  rate  of  return \n(FIRR)  has  been  calculated  as  3.16%  in  real  terms  and  using  end  of  2006  prices.  This \ncompares  favorably  to  the  Project\u2019s  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  1.36%, \nsignifying  the  Project\u2019s  sustainability.  Loan  assurances  have  been  included  to  ensure \nimplementation of harbor usage charges to cover costs with regard to equity, affordability, and \nharmonization of charges between harbors. The financial management assessment conducted \nled to formulation of a financial management strengthening program included in the institutional \ndevelopment and capacity building component. \n \nC. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n \n\n1. \n\nPoverty and Social Dimensions \n\n54. \nThe project coverage is nationwide. For 70% of the population (about 209,189 people) \nresiding  in  outer  atolls,  the  need  to  commute  between  their  home  island  and  Mal\u00e9  is  high. \nImprovements  to  the  transport  network  facilitated  by  the  Project  will  decrease  transport  costs \nand provide benefits to vessel owners, passengers, and cargo owners residing in outer atolls. \n \n55. \nIsolation is an important element, resulting in human poverty in the majority of the atolls \noutside  Mal\u00e9.  Limited  transportation  opportunities  add  to  remoteness  and  isolation,  with  the \nresult  that  there  are  significant  disparities  of  income  and  of  access  to  social  services  in  the \nremote  atolls.  Limited  access  to  transport  infrastructure  negatively  impacts  planned  or \nemergency visits to schools and medical services for those residing in outer islands, particularly \nfor women and children.  \n \n56. \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  benefits  for  island-based  communities  through  reduced \nturnaround time for vessels in Mal\u00e9, and the expected resulting increase in the frequency and \n\n                                                 \n23 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n  \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nsafety of vessel trips between outer islands and Mal\u00e9. A summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy is in Appendix 13.  \n \n \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n2. \n\nAll of the land required for the Project is owned by the Government. It is expected that \n\n57. \nno land will have to be acquired from private landowners and no resettlement will be involved.  \n  \n \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n3. \n\n58. \nThe  infrastructure  investment  component  is  based  on  an  approved  land  use  plan \nprepared  by  MHUD.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines,24 the \ninvestment  component  of  the  Project  is  classified  a  \u201cB\u201d  project.  The  Project  is  subject  to  the \nEnvironmental Protection and Preservation Act, 1993, and requires the preparation of an initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  report,  according  to  the  Government\u2019s  regulations.  The  IEE \nreport  has  been  prepared  and  submitted  to  MEEW  for  review;  a  \u201cDecision  Note\u201d,  which \nconstitutes the environmental clearance of the Project, has been obtained.  \n \n59. \nThe  IEE  carried  out  a  screening  process  that  determined  the  potential  environmental \nimpacts  caused  by  the  location,  construction,  and  operation  of  the  subproject  as  well  as  the \ndirect and indirect effects on the existing environment. The impacts were assessed to be either \ninsignificant  or  temporary,  and  reversible  and  manageable.  Mitigation  measures  to  prevent  or \nminimize  unnecessary  impacts  are  also  provided.  The  mitigation  approach  is  mainly  through \nintegrating  information  and  understanding  of  the  local  hydrodynamic  process  into  the  project \nengineering design to reduce other potential environmental impacts and the need for mitigation, \nespecially  during  project  operation.  Potential  impacts  and  risks  during  construction  were  also \ncharacterized as short-term. Unnecessary impacts will be minimized through good construction \nmanagement and housekeeping practices. An EMP, including a monitoring plan to mitigate the \npotential  impacts,  has  been  prepared  to  ensure  that  the  Project  will  be  implemented  in  an \nenvironmentally  sound  and  sustainable  manner.  The  summary  IEE,  including  EMP,  is  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  H.  The  EMP  will  be  updated  by  the  infrastructure  investment \nconsultants during detailed design. Therefore, any additional requirements from MEEW will be \nincorporated during the detailed design.  \n \n60. \nThe  IEE  shows  that  there  are  no  significant  environmental  impacts  that  need  further \ndetailed study or environmental impact assessment. All potential and associated impacts can be \naddressed  through  implementation  of  the  mitigation  measures  as  proposed  in  the  IEE. \nProvisions  are  made  in  the  project  cost  to  cover  environmental  mitigation  and  monitoring. \nTherefore,  the  IEE  is  sufficient  for  the  proposed  Project  and,  with  its  proposed  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring program, can be considered the completed environmental impact \nassessment. \n \nD. \n\nRisks \n\nThe  December  2004  tsunami  resulted  in  a  significant  number  of  harbor  reconstruction \n61. \nprojects,  which  have  caused  additional  strain  on  MCPI\u2019s  limited  human  resource  base.  The \nconsequent risk of potential delays in the construction of the additional 290 m quay wall in Mal\u00e9 \nNorth  Harbor  has  been  mitigated  through  the  provision  of  consulting  services  in  the  form  of  a \ninvestment  consulting \nproject  management  assistance  group  under \n\ninfrastructure \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\ncomponent.  The  detailed  design  and  construction  supervision  will  be  carried  out  by  the  same \nconsulting  firm  engaged  under  the  infrastructure  investment  component  to  mitigate  the  risk  of \npotentially  split  liability.  Enhancement  of  MTC\u2019s  planning  and  regulatory  capabilities  are \nsupported  through  the  institutional  development  and  capacity  building  component.  The  long-\nterm sustainability of these interventions is subject to adequate staffing of the PMU and PIUs, \nand  to  the  retention  of  trained  staff.  During  processing,  the  Government  requested  ADB \nassistance in recruiting the consulting firms necessary for project implementation. Based on an \nassessment of the capacity of the agencies to be involved in project implementation, the request \nwas  considered  justified.  Consequently,  the  risk  of  delay  in  recruitment  of  consulting  services \nhas been significantly reduced. \n \n62. \nBecause  of  the  high  proportion  of  benefits  to  be  realized  from  the  outset  by  existing \nusers of Mal\u00e9 North Harbor, there are no significant risks associated with the Project\u2019s benefit \nstreams. Extensive reconstruction works undertaken recently as a result of the tsunami provide \nample  experience  for  capital  cost  estimates,  therefore  the  risk  variations  in  actual  cost  are \nconsidered  low.  O&M  cost  estimates  are  based  on  actual  cost  applied  in  Mal\u00e9  South  West \nHarbor, a comparable harbor.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n63. \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n \n \n\nInstitutional Realignment \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  implementation  of  the  action  plan  for \ninstitutional  realignment  of  MTC's  maritime  transport  activities  within  its  sector \nmandate, as developed with assistance from consultants engaged for institutional \nand capacity building component (the Institutional Consultants), commences not \nlater than 31 May 2008. \n\nHarbor Usage Charge Structures \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  a  harbor  usage  charge  structure  for  the  Mal\u00e9 \nNorth  Harbor  and  Vilin\u2019gili  Harbor  is  finalized  and  approved  for  implementation \nwithin  18  months  of  loan  effectiveness  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  cost \nrecovery  covenant.

Large distances\u2014in combination with slow and \nuncomfortable  maritime  transportation,  variable  demand,  lack  of  economies  of  scale,  limited \neconomic  activity  in  remote  atolls  to  finance  travel  needs,  and  adverse  seasonal  weather \nconditions\u2014result  in  high  transport  cost  and  limited  transportation  opportunities.  While  air \ntransport  is  a  gradually  developing  sector,  maritime  transport  remains  the  most  important \ntransport mode in the country.  \n \nB. \n\nMaritime Transport Sector \n\n2. \nThe Government\u2019s direct role in the sector has focused on provision of international and \ndomestic  maritime  transport  infrastructure  and  on  regulation  of  domestic  maritime  transport \nservices in the areas of safety, vessel inspections, and vessel registrations.  \n \n \n\nInternational Maritime Transport Infrastructure \n\n1. \n\nUntil  2006,  most  of  the  country\u2019s  imports  arrived  in  Mal\u00e9  Commercial  Harbor  (MCH),1 \n3. \nwhich is located on the northwestern part of the capital island and operated by Maldives Ports \nAuthority  (MPA),  a  fully  owned  government  entity  established  in  1986.  MPA  reports  to  the \nMinistry  of  Transport  and  Communication  (MTC)  and  is  responsible  for  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  of  all  commercial  ports  in  the  Maldives,  which  includes  the  two  regional \nports commissioned in 2006. MPA operates on a commercial basis, is debt-free, and contributes \npositively in the form of dividends and land rent to government revenues. All international trade \nrelated shipments occur through the commercial ports. MCH, which can accommodate ships up \nto  15,000  gross  ton  (GT)  and  has  a  10.5  meter  (m)  draft,  handled  a  throughput  of  416,457 \nmetric ton in 2005 (95% imports and 5% exports). About 40% of total imports are reshipped to \nouter atolls, and 90% of this domestic interchange occurs via Mal\u00e9 North Harbor. MCH currently \noperates above capacity. The lack of space available on Mal\u00e9, in particular for container storage \nand handling, severely constrains future expansion options and the Government has identified \nnew alternative sites to relocate MCH.2 To ease the capacity constraints of MCH and in line with \nthe  Government\u2019s  national  development  strategies  of  creating  regional  development  centers, \ntwo regional ports became operational in 2006: HD. Kulhuduffushi Regional Port in the Northern \nDevelopment  Region  and  the  S.  Hithadhoo  Regional  Port,  in  the  Southern  Development \nRegion. The regional ports cater to commercial import cargo and are designed to specifications \nthat are markedly different from the vessel requirements and harbor specifications of domestic \nmaritime  transport.  HD.  Kulhuduffushi  Regional  Port  has  a  170  m  x  -5  m  quay,  which \naccommodates  ships  up  to  1,000  GT.  S.  Hithadhoo  Regional  Port  accommodates  ships  up  to \n3,000 GT and has a draft of 8 m.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  assistance  to  the  development  of  MCH  through  two  loans: \n(i) ADB.  1988.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Republic  of  the  Maldives  for  the  Mal\u00e9  Port  Development  Project.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Republic of the Maldives for the Second Mal\u00e9 Port Project. Manila. \n\n2  The World Bank is providing technical assistance through the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) \nto support the Government in its objective of developing the future location of MCH on a public-private partnership \nbasis. Consultants for the 4-month assignment mobilized in January 2007. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n4. \nThe  Government  has  agreed  to  allow  a  potential  private  sector  investor  to  assess  the \nfeasibility of establishing a container transshipment terminal in the northern part of the Maldives. \nThe feasibility of the potential project is likely to be sensitive to expansions in regional capacity. \nIt is understood that the roles of the public and private sector in the potential project remain to \nbe delineated.  \n \n \n\nDomestic Maritime Transport Infrastructure in Mal\u00e9 \n\n2. \n\n5. \nMal\u00e9, the national hub island, is rectangular in shape and has harbors on three of its four \nsides.  The  harbors  in  Mal\u00e9  are  used  for  distinctively  different  activities.  Usage  patterns  are \ncodified in guidelines issued by the Ministry of Construction and Public Infrastructure (MCPI)3 as \nfollows. Starting at the eastern end of the north side of Mal\u00e9 (Map 1), the first harbor is used for \nferry  terminals  for  Mal\u00e9  International  Airport  and  the  newly  reclaimed  island  of  Hulhumal\u00e9. \nProgressing westward along the north side is the area known as the Mal\u00e9 North East Harbor, \nwhich  holds  the  moorings  for  the  National  Security  Service  patrol,  Coast  Guard  Vessels,  and \nother  government  craft.  The  main  service  jetties  for  public  passenger  transport  services  and \nofficial government jetties are also part of Mal\u00e9 North East Harbor.  \n \n6. \nA  project  to  transfer  the  existing  fish  market  from  its  current  onshore  location  along \nMarine Drive to a reclaimed area of approximately 2,000 square meters (m2) extended in front of \nits present position into the harbor basin is currently ongoing in the eastern part of Mal\u00e9 North \nHarbor.  The  construction  of  the  fish  market  will  provide  a  barrier  partitioning  the  existing \ncommon  basin  for  Mal\u00e9  North  East  Harbor  and  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  basin  into  two  separate \nbasins.  The  berthing  facilities  that  will  become  available  on  the  eastern  side  of  the  new  fish \nmarket are to be reserved for fishing vessels. The fish market relocation project is scheduled for \ncompletion by the end of 2007.  \n \n7. \nMal\u00e9  North  Harbor  is  the  gateway  to  the  capital  for  the  outer  atoll  population,  and  is \nreserved  for  inter-atoll  passenger  and  cargo  vessels.  The  harbor  currently  consists  of  a  quay \nwall of 200 meters (m) along Marine Drive from the west side of the existing fish market up to \nthe  existing  boundary  wall  of  MCH.  The  harbor  has  an  external  seawall  and  offers  unused \nspace with potential for quay wall development in protected waters. At present, the area has no \ninfrastructure  supporting  loading  and  unloading,  and  lack  of  harbor  management  hinders  the \nefficiency  of  its  operations.  Harbor  management  responsibilities  for  harbors  located  on  the \nnorthern part of Mal\u00e9 up to Mal\u00e9 North West Harbor primarily rest with MCPI, with inputs from \nMinistry  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development  (MHUD),  MTC,  and  Mal\u00e9  Municipality.  With  the \nexception of MCH, no charges for loading and unloading are currently levied for the use of the \nharbors on the northern side of the island. Operation and maintenance (O&M) costs are covered \nthrough the central budget. \n \nMal\u00e9 South West Harbor, located on the southwest corner of Mal\u00e9, is used by (i) heavy \n8. \ndomestic  cargo  vessels,  including  construction  materials;  (ii)  resort  vessels;  (iii)  landing  craft \nexporting  solid  waste  from  Mal\u00e9  to  Thilafushi;  (iv)  vessels  carrying  hazardous  materials;  and \n(v) also  functions  as  the  passenger  ferry  terminal  for  the  island  of  Vilin\u2019gili.  The  harbor  has  a \ncentral  loading  and  unloading  jetty  for  cargo  vessels.  Mobile  cranes  facilitate  loading  and \nunloading. The south side quay wall of Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor is used for berthing of vessels \nservicing the tourist resorts. Mooring is permitted in the lee of the breakwater. The Public Works \nServices (PWS) Section of MCPI manages all areas of Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor, ensures that \nquays  are  used  as  designated,  and  sets  and  collects  harbor  user  charges  sufficient  to  meet \nO&M costs. \n \n\n                                                 \n3 The most recent guidelines are in effect from 1 September 2006. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27\n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nAtoll and Island Harbors \n\n9. \nA  total  of  197  of  the  1,190  islands  in  the  Maldives  are  inhabited.  Although  a \ncomprehensive list of the status of harbor infrastructure in inhabited islands does not exist, it is \nestimated  that  approximately  50%  of  the  inhabited  islands  lack  basic  transport  infrastructure \nfacilities, adding to their isolation and lack of access to economic opportunities. A combination \nof  natural  and  artificial  harbors  constitutes  the  core  of  atoll  and  island  harbor  infrastructure. \nHarbor basins typically have a depth of \u20132.5 m, although new harbors are being constructed to \n\u20133.0 m. Harbor basins are protected by breakwaters\u2014originally constructed by corals, but now \nmostly  replaced  by  walls  constructed  of  imported  rock  and  concrete  quay  walls.  The  National \nHarbor  and  Reclamation  Programme  contains  a  non-prioritized  list  of  strategically  selected \nharbors,  involving  investments  of  an  average  of  Rf25  million  per  harbor.  Investment  decisions \nare  made  by  the  Ministerial  Committee  on  Harbor  Dredging  and  Land  Reclamation.  Other \nprograms, such as the Access Programme and the Tsunami Rehabilitation Programme, add to \nthe plans for upgrading of domestic maritime transport infrastructure facilities. In addition, MCPI \nhas developed a list comprising about half of all inhabited islands, for which it is proposed that \n\u201ca good standard harbor\u201d is constructed or upgraded through repair by the end of 2008. No user \ncharges  are  currently  levied  on  users  of  transport  infrastructure  in  atoll  and  island  harbors. \nMinor  O&M  costs  are  covered  by  boat  owners  and  through  Island  Office  funds.  Major  repair \nworks are covered through central government funds directed from the Ministry of Finance and \nTreasury (MoFT) to MCPI. \n \nC. \n\nDomestic Maritime Transport Services \n\n10. \nThe market structure for domestic maritime transport services consists of a mix of partly \npublic  and  private  operation  and  ownership.  The  transport  services  sector  is  primarily  \u201con-\ndemand\u201d based and is characterized by the lack of a system of countrywide regular, scheduled \ntransport passenger and cargo services. \n \nScheduled  transport  passenger  services  have  primarily  been  provided  by  the  Maldives \n11. \nTransport  and  Contracting  Company  (MTCC), 4  a  state-owned  enterprise.  MTCC 5  operates \nregular  passenger  transport  services  from  Mal\u00e9  to:  (i)  the  Baa  Atoll  in  the  North  Central \nDevelopment  Region;  (ii)  Vilin\u2019gili  and  Hulhumal\u00e9  Harbors  within  the  Mal\u00e9  Atoll;  and  (iii)  other \nislands within the Mal\u00e9 Atoll. Since mid-2006, MTCC has embarked on an ambitious project of \ninitiating  a  \u201ccomprehensive  prescheduled  maritime  transport  network\u201d  nationwide.  The  project \naims at providing inter-atoll and interisland maritime passenger transport services centered on \nregional airports and expected future economic growth centers on a network basis. The network \napproach  will  provide  transport  services  establishing  connections  between  Mal\u00e9,  select  atolls, \nand  islands  within  these  atolls.  Therefore,  it  is  broader  than  the  previous  \u201chub  and  spoke \nsystem\u201d. The project is likely to provide valuable lessons for the formulation of future public and \nprivate sector roles and responsibilities, based on exact demand data. \n \n12. \nThe  passenger  and  cargo  transport  services  segment  served  by  individuals  or  island \ncommunities  is  fragmented  and  lacks  sufficient  size  to  create  economies  of  scale.  The \ntraditional vessels operated by individuals or island communities are slow, inefficient, and lack \npassenger facilities and safety features. Increased private sector participation in the provision of \ntransport services is hindered by lack of (i) clear policies governing the role of public and private \n\n                                                 \n4  Some 52.5% of the shares in MTCC are held directly by the Government. Another 7.5% of MTCC\u2019s shares are held \nby  government-controlled  companies,  resulting  in  a  total  government  majority  of  60%.  The  managing  director  is \nappointed directly by the Government.  \n\n5   MTCC  does  not  undertake  cargo  transport  services  but  is  involved  in  various  other  maritime  transport  sector \nsegments  such  as  maritime  dredging  and  construction  work,  island  harbor  construction,  and  supply  of  marine \nengines and equipment. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nparticipants, and (ii) access to technical advice and financial support to adapt and expand the \nfleet to meet emerging efficiency requirements in the sector.  \n \nD. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\nAs  a  reflection  of  decision  processes  inherent  in  consensus-based  cultures,  combined \n13. \nwith the fact that changes in organizational mandates have historically developed on an ad hoc \nbasis without a whole-of-government approach, multiple ministries and agencies are involved in \ndomestic  maritime \ntransport  sector  decisions.  Formal  organizational  mandates  and \nresponsibilities  tend  to  overlap.  Therefore,  informal  consultation  and  cooperation  processes \namong  ministries  form  the  basis  of  public  service  delivery.  Senior  government  officials  are \ngenerally highly qualified and many benefit from overseas educational backgrounds at master\u2019s \nand doctoral levels.  \n \n14. \nThe  main  sector  ministries  are  MTC  and  MCPI.  MTC  has  primary  responsibility  for \ninternational and domestic maritime transport infrastructure and services, including formulation \nof  transport  policies  and  regulation,  establishment  of  safety  standards,  and  for  conducting \nsurveys and registration of vessels. Apart from MPA\u2019s activities, MTC\u2019s sector involvement has \nfocused  on  policy  and  regulatory  aspects  of  domestic  maritime  transport  services.  MCPI  is \nresponsible  for  implementation  of  infrastructure  projects  in  the  Maldives.  MCPI\u2019s  PWS  is \nresponsible  for  O&M  of  domestic  maritime  transport  infrastructure  within  Mal\u00e9,  and  sets  and \ncollects harbor usage charges in Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor.  \n \n15. \nIn  addition  to  MTC  and  MCPI,  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  National  Development \n(MPND)  has  major  sector  influence  through  its  responsibilities  for  national  development \nplanning  and  aid  integration.  MPND  has  coordination  responsibilities  for  the  Ministerial \nCommittee on Harbor Dredging and Land Reclamation, which oversees technical aspects and \nprioritizes  harbor  construction  works  included  in  the  National  Harbor  Program.  MPND  also \ncoordinates expenditure according to the Public Sector Investment Program\u2014a subcomponent \nof the national budget, which comprises expenditures for land acquisition, civil works, and large-\nscale  equipment;  and  ensures  government  counterpart  funding  for  these  budget  items  for \nnational development projects. The Ministry of Atolls Administration and line ministries (such as \nthe Ministry of Fisheries, Agriculture and Marine Resources) propose islands in need of harbor \ndevelopment and submit their requirements and recommendations to the Ministerial Committee \non  Harbor  Dredging  and  Land  Reclamation.  The  following  ministries  are  represented  in  the \ncommittee:  (i)  MPND;  (ii)  MTC;  (iii) MCPI;  (iv)  MHUD;  (v)  Ministry  of  Atolls  Administration;  (vi) \nMinistry of Environment, Energy and Water (MEEW); and (vii) Ministry of Fisheries, Agriculture \nand  Marine  Resources.  MoFT\u2019s  role  in  the  maritime  transport  sector  relates  to  its  budget \nallocation,  monitoring,  and  oversight  responsibilities  with  regard \nto  all  publicly-owned \ninfrastructures. MEEW is responsible for environmental policy and implementation, and reviews \ndetailed designs for environmental compliance. MEEW also conducts ongoing monitoring during \nand after construction. MHUD is responsible for developing, proposing, and regulating maritime \ntransport  infrastructure  and  urban  development  activities  nationwide;  and  for  preparing  the \naccompanying  land  usage  plans.  The  Coast  Guard,  reporting  to  the  Ministry  of  Defense,  is \nresponsible for enforcing safety and other regulations affecting domestic maritime transport; and \nconducts search and rescue operations in national waters. \n \nE. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n16. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Seventh  National  Development  Plan  (7NDP)  covering  2006\u20132010 \nhighlights  the  importance  of  ensuring  equitable  opportunities  and  fairer  distribution  of  income \nand  wealth.  Population  development  consolidation,  balanced  regional  development,  and \nincreasing private sector participation are part of the key strategies. In 2002\u2014with the purpose \nof  achieving  economies  of  scale  in  the  provision  of  services  and  reduction  of  the  unit  cost  of \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\n \n\ntransport  services\u2014the  Government  initiated  a  program  of  providing  incentives  for  voluntary \nmigration to larger islands.   \n \n17. \nRecognizing  the  paramount  importance  of  the  maritime  transport  sector  in  ensuring \npopulation-wide access to social and economic development opportunities, the 7NDP includes \n12 policies with supporting sub-strategies in the form of a combined land and sea transport road \nmap. Considering the lifeline characteristics of Mal\u00e9 North Harbor, improvement in the form of \nprovision of loading and unloading areas and new berthing facilities in this harbor is the highest \nprioritized investment proposal in the land and sea transport road map (included as policy 1). In \naddition, the 7NDP includes the following policies and sub-strategies of particular relevance to \nthe proposed Project: (i) harmonization of harbor charges between Mal\u00e9 North Harbor and Mal\u00e9 \nSouth West Harbor is included as sub-strategy 1.3; (ii) policy 4 notes that the role of the private \nsector  as  provider  of  transport  services  is  to  be  strengthened;  (iii)  policy  6  states  that  human \nresources development and capacity building programs are to be introduced to ensure that the \ntransport  sector  has  the  staff,  resources,  and  skills  necessary  to  meet  sector  requirements; \n(iv) policy  7  outlines  the  need  for  promptly  initiating  institutional  changes  and  includes \nstrengthening  of  MTC\u2019s  maritime  transport  section;  (v)  sub-strategy  7.5  refers  to  the  need  for \nimproving management of domestic maritime transport infrastructure in Mal\u00e9; and (vi) policy 11 \noutlines actions necessary to improve safety measures, including marine navigation.  \n \nF. \n\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Sector Strategy and Support under the Proposed \nProject \n\n \n\n1. \n\nDomestic Maritime Transport Infrastructure \n\nADB supports the Government\u2019s policy choice of maintaining ownership and operation of \n18. \ndomestic  maritime  transport  infrastructure  in  the  short  to  medium  term.  Assistance  to  the \nimprovement  of  the  Government\u2019s  highest-ranked  transport  infrastructure  investment,  Mal\u00e9 \nNorth  Harbor,  constitutes  the  core  investment  of  the  proposed  Project,  which  was  included  in \nthe  country  strategy  and  program  update. 6 ADB  also  supports  the  Government\u2019s  long-term \nsector  objectives  of  ensuring  separation  of  maritime  transport  sector  policy,  planning,  and \nregulatory functions from operational activities; the ongoing realignment initiatives in MTC; and \nthe strategic directions outlined in the 7NDP to introduce efficiency and sustainability targets to \nenhance  public  sector  provision  of  domestic  maritime  transport  infrastructure.  These  sector \nobjectives  are  supported  under  the  loan  through  the  institutional  development  and  capacity \nbuilding component (Appendix 10).  \n \n \n\nDomestic Maritime Transport Services \n\n2. \n\n19. \nLack of access to finance has been identified as a major obstacle for increased private \nsector  participation  in  the  domestic  maritime  transport  services  sector.  ADB  is  currently \nexploring options for inclusion of financial assistance to private vessel owners under the Small \nand  Medium-Sized  Enterprise  Development  Project. 7  In  tandem  with  these  efforts,  ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Operations Department is exploring options for providing a loan to the Maldives \nFinance  Leasing  Company  Pvt.  Ltd.,  which  offers  leasing  facilities  to  private  vessel  owners \nagainst security.  \n \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2005.

This pattern is largely expected to continue in the future, albeit tempered by a \ngreater role for air travel by passengers and by growth of regional economic centers and associated \nregional ports in the north and south of the country. Therefore, total traffic forecasts are based on \nanticipated  population  and  economic  growth  as  well  as  induced  traffic  generated  by  improved \nfacilities  and  services.  While  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  will  continue  to  dominate  in  domestic  travel  and \ntransport, its share of future growth\u2014both for passengers and freight\u2014is expected to decline until \ntraffic levels largely stabilize. \n \n2. \nexcluding passenger ferries: \n \n\nInterisland  traffic  volumes  at  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  have  been  estimated  as  follows  for  2005, \n\n(i)  Passengers inbound through Mal\u00e9 North Harbor (equal outbound): 174,794 persons \n(ii)  Cargo inbound through Mal\u00e9 North Harbor:  \n(iii) Cargo outbound through Mal\u00e9 North Harbor: \n(iv) Vessel calls, Mal\u00e9 North Harbor:   \n\n         45,467 tons \n       189,329 tons \n           2,500 calls \n\n \n  \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nProjected  passenger  and  freight  traffic  at  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  throughout  the  life  of  the \n\n \n3. \nProject is in Table A11.1. Further details are in Supplementary Appendix E, section C.  \n \n\nTable A11.1:  Forecast of Interisland Passenger and Freight Traffic \nthrough Mal\u00e9 North Harbor  \n\nYear \n2005 \n2010 \n2015 \n2020 \n2025 \n2030 \n\nPassengers \n(1 way MNH) \n174,794 \n228,372  \n276,500  \n300,659  \n308,251  \n316,035  \n\nInbound Cargo \n(tons to MNH) \n45,467 \n50,199  \n56,796  \n64,259  \n72,703  \n82,257  \n\nOutbound Cargo \n(tons from MNH) \n189,329 \n247,362  \n292,355  \n310,160  \n310,160  \n310,160  \n\nMNH = Mal\u00e9 North Harbor. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nDemand  for  freight  and  passenger  services  has  been  converted  into  vessel  calls  at  Mal\u00e9 \n4. \nNorth  Harbor  (Table  A11.2).1 Medium-sized  vessels  average  60  tons  cargo  capacity,  and  large \nvessels can carry an average of 150 tons. Vessels travel essentially fully loaded when they return to \nthe  islands.  With  growing  demand  over  time,  it  is  assumed  that  economies  of  scale  will  promote \ngreater  use  of  larger  vessels.  In  addition,  with  the  development  of  the  northern  and  southern \nregional  centers,  a  system  of  cargo  transshipment  and  distribution  may  develop  outside  Mal\u00e9. \nTherefore, the role of large vessels is expected to increase and their number of calls is assumed to \ngrow  by  4%  per  annum.  This  scenario  means  that,  over  the  course  of  the  planning  period,  the \nproportion of large vessel calls will grow from 20% to 50% and their share of tonnage carried will \ngrow from 38% to 73%.  \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n1 With  the  Project,  it  has  been  calculated  that  sufficient  capacity  will  exist  at  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  to  accommodate  the \nforecast cargo volumes and vessel traffic as long as the recommended harbor management and efficiency inducements \nare introduced. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n47\n\nTable A11.2: Forecast of Interisland Vessel Calls at Mal\u00e9 North Harbor \n\nYear \n2005 \n2010 \n2015 \n2020 \n2025 \n2030 \n\nMedium Vessels \n2,000 \n2,602  \n3,022  \n2,918  \n2,430  \n1,837  \n\nLarge Vessels \n500 \n608  \n740  \n900  \n1,096  \n1,333  \n\nTotal Vessels \n2,500 \n3,210  \n3,762  \n3,818  \n3,526  \n3,170  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nCosts \n\n1. \n\nLocation of Proposed Project \n\nB. \n\n \n\n5. \nAlternative  locations  for  the  proposed  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  Project  on  Mal\u00e9  island  and \nelsewhere  within  the  Mal\u00e9  atoll  were  investigated.  The  analysis  concluded  that  no  lower  cost \nlocation  is  available\u2014either  from  a  capital  or  operating  perspective.  Based  on  the  evaluation  of \npossible  alternative  layouts  at  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor,  the  proposed  Project  is  deemed  the  least-cost \noption  most  responsive  to  the  needs  identified  to  better  serve  the  interisland  fleet.  Further  details \nare in Supplementary Appendix E, section E. \n \n \n\nCapital Investment Costs \n\n2. \n\nCapital costs for the Project are estimated at $4,432,313 (Rf57.0 million). \n\nCapital  renewal  of  $100,000  for  pavement  resurfacing,  equipment  replacement,  etc.  has \n\n6. \n \n7. \nbeen budgeted at 5-year intervals. \n \n \n\nOperating Costs \n\n3. \n\nAnnual civil maintenance costs, including any future maintenance dredging if required, are \n8. \nbudgeted  at  0.5%  of  the  total  capital  cost.  For  equipment,  5%  of  initial  capital  expenditure  is \nbudgeted for annual maintenance.  \n \nIt  is  assumed  that  a  total  operational  staff  of  16  will  be  required  for  24-hour  harbor \n9. \nmanagement  (12  operational  staff  plus  4  financial  clerks  for  revenue  collection).  This  is  similar  to \nthe staffing structure currently in place at Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor.2 At an average compensation \npackage of Rf61,000, the total cost for 16 staff is Rf976,000. Ten percent has been added to this \namount  for  management  and  overhead,  and  an  additional  12%  for  utilities,  etc.,  for  an  initial  total \nannual operating cost of Rf1.2 million ($93,750). This figure is assumed to escalate by 10% at 5-\nyear intervals. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n10. \n \n\nThe cost estimates for the Project may be summarized as follows: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n \n\nInitial capital investment (excluding tariff):  $4,432,313 \n \nCapital renewal budget: \nAnnual civil maintenance:  \n \nAnnual electrical/mechanical maintenance:  $5,989     (5% of capital cost) \n \nAnnual operating budget: \n \n \n\n$100,000 every 5 years \n$18,852   (0.5% of capital cost) \n\n$93,750   (escalated by 10% at  \n \n\n     5-year intervals) \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2 In the interest of transparency, at South West Harbor, Public Works Services (PWS) assigns supervisory and operating \nstaff from its harbor management section but receipt of payments is performed by clerks from PWS\u2019s separate financial \nsection.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n11. \nAccordingly, the initial project economic costs are considered to be as follows: \n \n\nThe  standard  shadow  cost  factor  for  local  labor  and  inputs  in  the  Maldives  is  0.9. \n\n \n\n \n\n                        $3,989,082 \n\nInitial capital cost: \n $90,000 \nFive-yearly capital renewal budget: \nAnnual maintenance cost: \n                        $22,356  \nInitial annual operating cost:                          $84,375 \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n \nBenefits are calculated for a 25-year operational period beginning mid-2009. \n\n \n12. \n \n13. \nThe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  for  the  Domestic  Maritime  Transport \nProject3 calculated  that  vessels  currently  must  wait  2  days  or  more  after  arrival  in  Mal\u00e9  North \nHarbor before they can berth alongside the quay for the safest and most efficient cargo loading and \ndischarge.4 The report went on to conclude that this wait to berth can be largely eliminated by the \nadditional quay capacity created through the Project, and calculated an average saving per vessel \nof  1.4  days  in  port.  The  PPTA  also  concluded  that,  in  addition  to  time  saved  waiting  for  a  berth, \nefficient harbor management and provision of mechanical handling should further accelerate vessel \nturnaround  at  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor\u2014in  total  up  to  nearly  50%  of  time  currently  spent  in  the  harbor. \nImposition  of  a  fee  structure  is  expected  to  serve  as  a  financial  catalyst  for  more  rapid  discharge \nand  loading  (footnote  3).  Over  time,  the  foregoing  factors  are,  very  conservatively,  expected  to \nmatch  the  benefits  of  berth  waiting  savings.  A  reduction  in  trip  time  results  in  benefits  for  both \nvessel users (cargo owners and passengers) and vessel owners. \n \n14. \nThe primary benefit stream consists of vessel cost savings caused by faster turnaround in \nport.  The  PPTA  estimated  value  per  day  at  berth  for  interisland  vessels  to  be  Rf1,816  ($142)  for \nmedium-sized vessels and Rf3,175 ($248) for large vessels (footnote 3). \n \n15. \nThe planned introduction of a pricing scheme at Mal\u00e9 North Harbor will recapture a portion \nof this benefit. For this reason, harbor revenues have not been included as an economic benefit as \nthis would result in a double count. However, vessel owners still benefit since the cumulative time \nsavings over the course of a year will allow them to add extra revenue-generating trips.  \n \nThe  additional  measurable  benefit  of  the  Project  is  the  expected  easing  of  road  traffic \n16. \ncongestion  along  Marine  Drive  adjacent  to  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor.  When  the  new  quay  begins \noperations,  loading  and  unloading  of  cargo  at  the  existing  200  meter  (m)  quay  wall  along \nMarine Drive will be restricted in order to reduce vehicle congestion. It is expected that the average \nspeed of vehicles passing Mal\u00e9 North Harbor during rush hours will increase from 8 kilometer per \nhour (km/h) to 24 km/h.   \n \n17. \nthe Project with an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 22.5% (Table A11.3). \n \n\nThe findings of the benefit and cost assessment clearly confirm the economic feasibility of \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2004.

During  these  operations,  there  is  always  the \nrisk of injury and cargo loss, and constant interruption to work on intervening vessels\u2014leading to loss of efficiency for all. \n\n \n\n\fInitial Cost\n127,201\n3,502,957\n   \n358,924\n\n \n\nYear\n\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n\nTable A11.3:  Cost and Benefit Stream  \n($) \n\nCosts\n\nBenefits \n\nOperation\n\nMaintenance\n\nPassengera\n\nVessela\n\nVehicle\n\nTotal\n\nNet Benefits\n\nAppendix 11 \n\n49\n\nTotal\n127,201\n    \n3,502,957\n \n    \n401,112\n    \n106,731\n    \n106,731\n    \n106,731\n    \n106,731\n    \n205,169\n    \n115,169\n    \n115,169\n    \n115,169\n    \n115,169\n    \n214,450\n    \n124,450\n    \n124,450\n    \n124,450\n    \n124,450\n    \n224,659\n    \n134,659\n    \n134,659\n    \n134,659\n    \n134,659\n    \n235,889\n    \n145,889\n    \n145,889\n    \n145,889\n    \n145,889\n\n42,188\n   \n84,375\n   \n84,375\n   \n84,375\n   \n84,375\n   \n92,813\n   \n92,813\n   \n92,813\n   \n92,813\n   \n   \n92,813\n102,094\n \n102,094\n \n102,094\n \n \n102,094\n102,094\n \n112,303\n \n112,303\n \n112,303\n \n \n112,303\n112,303\n \n123,533\n \n123,533\n \n \n123,533\n123,533\n \n \n123,533\n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n22,356\n22,356\n22,356\n22,356\n112,356\n22,356\n22,356\n22,356\n22,356\n112,356\n22,356\n22,356\n22,356\n22,356\n112,356\n22,356\n22,356\n22,356\n22,356\n112,356\n22,356\n22,356\n22,356\n22,356\n\n110,364\n229,438\n239,371\n249,736\n258,119\n391,663\n404,845\n418,474\n432,564\n434,477\n571,907\n574,403\n576,917\n579,449\n582,000\n722,869\n726,025\n729,203\n732,404\n735,628\n880,039\n883,890\n887,768\n891,673\n895,605\n\n252,017\n524,196\n545,163\n566,970\n583,272\n900,051\n925,906\n952,489\n979,823\n974,660\n1,274,437\n1,267,095\n1,259,459\n1,251,518\n1,243,258\n1,547,683\n1,536,485\n1,524,840\n1,512,729\n1,500,132\n1,787,781\n1,771,401\n1,754,367\n1,736,651\n1,718,226\n\n8,920\n9,009\n9,099\n9,190\n9,282\n9,375\n9,469\n9,563\n9,659\n9,756\n9,853\n9,952\n10,051\n10,152\n10,253\n10,356\n10,459\n10,564\n10,670\n10,776\n10,884\n10,993\n11,103\n11,214\n11,326\n\n371,301\n762,643\n793,634\n825,896\n850,673\n1,301,089\n1,340,219\n1,380,527\n1,422,046\n1,418,893\n1,856,197\n1,851,450\n1,846,427\n1,841,119\n1,835,512\n2,280,908\n2,272,970\n2,264,607\n2,255,802\n2,246,537\n2,678,704\n2,666,284\n2,653,238\n2,639,538\n2,625,157\n\nIRR\nNPV@12%\n\n(127,201)\n(3,502,957)\n(29,810)\n655,912\n686,902\n719,165\n743,942\n1,095,920\n1,225,050\n1,265,357\n1,306,877\n1,303,723\n1,641,747\n1,727,000\n1,721,977\n1,716,668\n1,711,061\n2,056,249\n2,138,310\n2,129,947\n2,121,143\n2,111,877\n2,442,814\n2,520,395\n2,507,348\n2,493,648\n2,479,268\n22.5%\n4,004,095\n\na 1.0 day saving for the first 5 years; subsequently, an additional 0.5 day saving at 5 year intervals. \nBoat owners and passengers take economic advantage of 50% of time saved. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA  number  of  risks  and  uncertainties  were  considered  and  serve  as  the  basis  of  the \n18. \neconomic  sensitivity  analyses  (Table  A11.4).

This  financial  analysis  appraises  the  sustainability  and  viability  of  the  proposed \nproject  investments  in  accordance  with  financial  management  and  analysis  of  projects. 1 \nAssumptions with regard to the introduction of a harbor usage charge and ring fencing of Mal\u00e9 \nNorth  Harbor  operations  under  the  Public  Works  Services  (PWS)  Section  have  been \nincorporated in the sustainability analysis. \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis Methodology and Approach \n\n2. \nThe  financial  analysis  focuses  on  the  infrastructure  investment  component,  which \nincludes construction of a 290 meter (m) L-shaped quay wall in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor. The Project \naims  at  creating  a  greenfield  revenue-generating  operation  at  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor,  through \nphysical asset creation and institutional development and capacity building efforts. This analysis \nassesses  the  ability  of  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  operations  to  meet  future  costs  of  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  and  debt  servicing,  on  a  present  value  basis,  measured  by  a  financial \ninternal rate of return (FIRR) and a net present value (NPV). Key assumptions have been made \nfor Mal\u00e9 North Harbor operations, leading to a with- and without-Project basis analysis, stream \nof  incremental  costs  and  revenues  over  a  25-year  period,  commencing  from  early  2009.  This \nbase case financial model FIRR for Mal\u00e9 North Harbor is compared with the Project\u2019s weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  to  determine  financial  sustainability.  A  sensitivity  analysis \nfurther  assesses  the  impact  of  changes  in  cost  and  revenue  assumptions  on  the  base  case \nFIRR.  \n \nC. \n\nDefinitions and Assumptions \n\n3. \nAssumptions  made  are  considered  reasonable  and  comparable  to  the  existing  Mal\u00e9 \nSouth West Harbor operations. All analysis was conducted in real terms at end of 2006 prices. \nDetailed  assumptions  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  Capital  expenditures  for  Mal\u00e9  North \nHarbor are distributed in line with the proposed implementation schedule and include all costs \nrelated to the physical investment in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor, excluding consultancy, interest during \nconstruction, and contingency costs. \n \n\n1. \n\nRevenue Assumptions \n\n4. \nThe Project has proposed for harbor usage charges to be implemented for Mal\u00e9 North \nHarbor from the start of operations in early 2009, i.e., immediately after completion of civil works \nand  operationalization  of  project  assets.  The  proposed  rationale  for  harbor  usage  charges \n(Supplementary Appendix G) is rooted in achieving financial sustainability in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor \noperations  and  leads  to  four  main  lines  of  revenues  from  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  assets:  (i)  sea \nvessel loading charges for usage of the new quay wall, (ii) sea vessel mooring and or berthing \ncharges  from  usage  of  existing  quay  wall,  (iii)  charges  to  trucks  or  vehicles  for  accessing \nsurface areas, and (iv) charges for usage of cargo handling equipment. Proposed harbor usage \ncharges,  defined  as  any  charge  levied  on  vessels  or  vehicles  for  the  use  of  facilities  within  a \nharbor area, are in Table A12.1.  \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005.

The charges are considered reasonable in comparison with \nMal\u00e9 South West Harbor, which has a similarly segmented charge structure, but where charges \nare levied at a rate of Rf10 ($0.78) per meter per hour in the commercial zone. This reflects the \ndifference in user group as well as greater efficiencies at Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor.   \n\n6. \nThe revenue segmentation in Table A12.1 from segregated loading and mooring and/or \nberthing areas is proposed to achieve operational efficiencies in managing Mal\u00e9 North Harbor \nassets  and  is  comparable  to  current  operations  management  at  Mal\u00e9  South  West  Harbor.  All \nheavy loading activities are expected to be carried out along the new L-shaped quay wall being \ndeveloped under the Project, while all other activities (waiting and/or berthing and/or mooring) \nare to be carried out along the existing 200 m quay wall. This zonal segregation, combined with \nuser  charges  segmentation  impacts  revenue,  streams  from  different  activities;  and  will  be \nrefined  further  by  the  consultants  to  be  engaged  under  the  institutional  development  and \ncapacity  building  component.  Mooring/berthing  revenue  lines  include  revenues  from  multiple \nrows of vessel moorings along the existing quay wall. \n\nThe first two revenue lines are a factor of the harbor usage charges, combined with sea \n7. \nvessel waiting times in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor. Therefore, assumptions have been made for waiting \ntimes based on current data and for a gradual decrease (medium-sized vessels from 10 days to \n6 days loading time, larger vessels from 15 days to 12 days loading time) over the 25 years as \nharbor  management  efficiencies,  increase  in  physical  capacity,  and  introduction  of  gradually \nincreasing harbor usage charges encourage quicker turnaround times. \n\n8. \nThe  other  revenue  lines  include  time-based  entry  fees  from  loading  trucks  using  the \ndesignated loading areas on top of the L-shaped quay, and from cargo handling equipment. To \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nreflect  space  constraints  at  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor,  charges  at  Rf12  per  vehicle  entry  are  higher \nthan at Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor, which currently charges Rf10 per day.  \n\nResidual value for Mal\u00e9 North Harbor at the end of 25 years has been estimated at 35% \n\n9. \nof capital investment, given a 40-year life of assets. \n \n\n2. \n\nCost Assumptions\u2013Harbor Operations \n\nCosts  for  a  16-person  operational  team  at  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  have  been  estimated \n10. \n(Rf960,000  or  $75,000  per  annum)  based  on  Mal\u00e9  South  West  Harbor  operating  team \nstructures.  Staff  numbers  are  assumed  to  gradually  be  reduced  to  13  by  2013  as  staff  are \nshared  between  Mal\u00e9  South  West,  Mal\u00e9  North,  and  Vilin\u2019gili  harbors.  Administration  and \noverhead costs are assumed as 4% of wages and salary costs, gradually increasing to 7% (in \nreal  terms)  by  2014,  as  operational  activities  increase.  Based  on  actual  cost  from  Mal\u00e9  South \nWest  Harbor,  annual  maintenance  costs  are  estimated  at  Rf118,000  ($9,000)  per  annum. \nPaving works are expected to require one-off replacement every 10 years at an estimated 17% \nof the capital expenditure costs (included in the cost estimates as paving works). This periodic \ncost of Rf626,000 ($49,000) has been provisioned for annually.  \n \n\n3. \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital \n\n11. \nThe  WACC  has  been  estimated  assuming  an  80/20  financing  split  between  ADB  debt \nand  government  counterpart  funds,  designated  as  equity  capital.  From  the  perspective  of  the \nProject,  debt  has  been  assumed  at  the  higher  of  the  ADB  interest  rates  (1.5%)  as  the \nGovernment will not onlend the debt funds to the Implementing Agency. The opportunity cost of \ngovernment equity has been estimated according to local treasury lending rates of around 7% \nplus  a  risk  premium  3%.  A  long-term  domestic  inflation  rate  of  3%  and  0  taxes  per  local \nregulations are also included in the calculation.

Since  the \npositive  NPV  and  FIRR  outweigh  the  WACC  of  1.36%,  the  Project\u2019s  infrastructure  investment \ncomponent  is  financially  viable  and  sustainable.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was  undertaken  on  the \nkey  assumptions  in  the  financial  model.  Despite  various  sensitivity  scenarios,  the  financial \nmodel remains robust, with FIRR remaining above WACC (Table A12.4). Harbor usage charges \nremain  the  most  critical  issue  for  financial  sustainability  and  need  to  be  implemented  after \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nproject completion.

This is not considered to be a major risk for the \nfollowing  reasons:  (i)  strong  policy  level  support  from  the  Seventh  National  Development  Plan \n(7NDP) in implementing harbor usage charges to make the assets self-sustaining, as confirmed \nby  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  in  its  letter  of  1  February  2007  to  ADB;  (ii)  a \nprecedence  for  harbor  usage  charges  at  Mal\u00e9  South  West  Harbor;  and  (iii)  a  potential  harbor \noperator  (PWS)  with  experience  in  managing  user  fees  from  Mal\u00e9  South  West  Harbor  and \nsustaining these operations purely from internal accruals without government support. However, \nthe  user  base  in  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor,  consisting  of  vessel  traffic  from  outer  atolls,  is  of  a  less \ncommercial composition than users of Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor and cannot be expected to bear \nthe same level of charges as users in Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor.   \n \n15. \nThe  institutional  development  and  capacity  building  component  provides  consultant \nsupport to the Ministry of Transport and Communication (MTC) for the establishment of harbor \nusage  charges  based  on  broad-based  stakeholder  consultations.  Therefore,  the  Project \nmitigates  the  risk  of  introducing  unexpected  charges.  Harbor  usage  charges  are  to  be \nimplemented immediately after completion of construction. Preliminary analysis of harbor usage \ncharges  estimates  a  lower  charge  than  currently  collected  in  Mal\u00e9  South  West  Harbor  (in \naccordance with the FIRR calculation above) as being sufficient to cover capital investment and \nO&M  costs  at  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor.  Impact  analysis  comparing  harbor  usage  charge  with \neconomic benefits also shows a net positive benefit to Mal\u00e9 North Harbor users. Demand risk is \nminimal because of the current capacity constraints. \n \n16. \nFinancial  risks  at  subproject  level  include  (i)  increase  in  prices  of  civil  works  and \nmaterials, particularly reclamation material; and (ii) delays in project implementation caused by \ncapacity  constraints.  These  risks  are  considered  low,  as  (i)  cost  estimates  include  higher \ncontingencies  for  dredging  materials  than  normal;  and  (ii)  project  implementation  support  is \nbeing  provided  through  a  project  management  assistance  group  under  the  infrastructure \ninvestment consultant component.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13         55 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a \nnational priority in country poverty \npartnership agreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Maldives: \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  ensuring  sustained  equitable  and  regionally  balanced  economic  growth  through \ninfrastructure  improvements  to  the  highest  ranked  infrastructure  investment  priority  in  the  Seventh  National \nDevelopment  Plan  (7NDP)  supported  by  institutional  and  capacity  building  initiatives  in  the  domestic  maritime \ntransport sector.  \n \nThe Project will support the domestic maritime transport sector in the Maldives by (i) relieving congestion in the \nmost  important  interisland  transport  hub  in  the  country,  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor;  and  (ii)  supporting  the  long-term \nsector  objectives  of  separating  policy,  planning,  and  regulatory  functions  from  operational  responsibilities \nthrough  the  institutional  development  and  capacity  building  component.  The  investment  and  institutional \ncomponents  of  the  proposed  loan  are  designed  to  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  objectives  of  ensuring \nsustained  equitable  and  regionally  balanced  economic  growth  and  will  ensure  increased  opportunities  for  the \n70% of the Maldivian population residing in outer atolls to participate in economic activities in Mal\u00e9. By reducing \ntime spent in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor, total transit time for travel between outer atolls and the capital will be reduced, \nand  result  in  passenger  and  inventory  cost  savings  as  well  as  an  increase  of  agricultural  produce  originating \nfrom outer islands in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor markets. The reduction of vessel turnaround time in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor \nwill lead to increased frequency of service and safer traveling conditions for the atoll community and thus benefit \nthe poorest section of the population. \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nThe population of the Maldives is 298,842 (Census 2006). If those resident in Kaafu Atoll close to or excluded \nfrom Mal\u00e9 are not considered, approximately 70% of the population lives in \u201cthe atolls\u201d. The greatest incidence of \npoverty can be clearly seen to occur in the atolls.  \n \nThe  Vulnerability  and  Poverty  Assessment  2004  (VPA)  shows  that  5%  (about  14,500  persons)  of  the  atoll \npopulation  can  be  considered  to  live  in  absolute  poverty,  with  a  daily  income  per  person  of  Rf7.5  per  day, \ncompared with 3% for the country as a whole and no incidence of poverty at this level in Mal\u00e9. A total of 28% of \nthe  atoll  population  falls  below  the  Rf15  per  person  per  day  poverty  line,  representing  about  80,000  persons \nresident  in  the  atolls  according  to  the  VPA  data.  The  dispersed  geography  of  the  archipelago,  combined  with \nlimited resources for infrastructure development, contribute to the disparities in access to resources and in the \nlevels of vulnerability experienced at individual island level. The VPA analysis shows that this level of poverty is \nconcentrated  in  the  north  of  the  Maldives  and  decreases  toward  the  south.  This  is  reflected  in  the  patterns  of \naccess to transport services, although transport is not considered a key determinant of the move into or out of \npoverty.  \n \nA sample of nine islands was studied in the preparation of the Project. These islands ranged in size and distance \nfrom  regional  capitals,  only  two  had  average  incomes  over  the  Rf15  poverty  line,  with  the  regional  capital \ndemonstrating an average income of Rf15.44\u2014on the poverty line. The travel demand and trends demonstrated \nby the sample islands were thus considered representative of those for the wider atoll population and a suitable \nbasis for analysis. The vulnerability ranking developed in the VPA assesses the vulnerability that arises from lack \nof access to social services, limited infrastructure (including transportation), and lack of access to resources for \nincome generation. For the 1997\u20131998 VPA, the disparities were found to be about 2:1 between the Maldives as \na  whole  and  the  atoll  population.  The  disparities  increased  to  3:1  between  Mal\u00e9  and  the  atoll  with  the  lowest \naverage per capita income.  \n \nAny  initiative  that  reduces  the  degree  of  disparity  between  the  atoll  community  and  Mal\u00e9  will  reduce  the  VPA \ndisparities.  Specifically,  such  improvements  will  have  a  positive  benefit  for  the  approximately  80,000  persons \nwho, in the above VPA analysis, are defined as \u201cincome-poor\u201d\u2014particularly those in remote locations with the \nmost limited transport services.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nImprovements to Mal\u00e9 North Harbor will have a significant positive benefit for vessel owners, passengers, and \ncargo owners served by vessels using this harbor, provided that the financial benefits from increased efficiency \nof operation and the resultant improved turnaround time outweigh the additional cost of harbor fees. Reduced \nturnaround time will reduce the costs per trip, by reducing the delays in Mal\u00e9, and will enable more trips per year \nto meet demand. \n\n \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n  No \n\n  No \n\n  Yes \n\n  Yes  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA stakeholder analysis was carried out and a participation plan was prepared in the project preparation stage. \nThese were reviewed and modified when necessary to ensure that all key stakeholders at central Government, \nlocal  government,  and  community  levels  were  identified.  These  groups  or  individuals  were  consulted  at  all \nstages of project preparation. \n \nThese consultations formed the basis of the social and poverty assessment in the initial stages. A 15% sample \nsurvey questionnaire as well as focus groups in each of nine islands included in the sample provided baseline \ndata on socioeconomic status, demand for transport services, and willingness and ability to pay for transport. In \nMal\u00e9, detailed interviews of 1\u20132 hours were carried out with owners and operators of all cargo or mixed cargo \nand passenger vessels in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor, and a detailed questionnaire was completed for each in a separate \nvisit.  These  consultations  covered  operating  costs,  transport  routes,  etc.  A  working  meeting  was  convened,  in \nwhich  four  larger-scale  transport  operators  were  asked  to  provide  input  to  transport  improvement  options.  In \nMal\u00e9,  government  and  domestic  transport  stakeholders,  along  with  directly  affected  business  persons,  were \ncontacted to obtain their assessment of the final project concept and to check for any design or general issues \nthat needed to be address before design was completed.   \n \nThe Government will ensure that essential participation of related stakeholders, particularly boat operators, will \nbe ensured and that stakeholders are consulted at detailed design review point, and then during construction in \norder to ensure that the design is fit for its purpose and that any negative construction impacts are minimized. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe  consistent  message  from  consultation  with  women  was  the  key  role  that  affordable  and  regular  transport \nplayed  in  the  life  of  the  community,  particularly  for  women.  In  all  but  two  locations  visited  during  public \nconsultation, cases were cited of death of pregnant women with complications, who could not get prompt access \nto  better  health  services.  The  point  was  made  that  the  lack  of  transport  impacted  most  on  those  with  low \nincomes who had limited cash available to hire private transport in cases of medical emergency. Although there \nwas  some  provision  for  the  Government  to  cover  this  cost,  there  were  some  delays  associated.  Preventative \nhealth checks and health care was not possible for those in the lowest income quintile. \n \nDifficulty  of  access  was  another  key  issue  for  women  living  on  islands  with  no  jetty.  Rough  conditions, \nconstraints of female clothing, and the need to carry small infants or travel while pregnant, were all contributing \nfactors to increase the negative impacts of lack of access to transport infrastructure for women.   \n \nAs  the  Project  is  likely  to  enable  higher  frequency  of  transport  opportunities,  women  are  likely  to  experience \nproportionately greater benefits from the Project than men\u2014because of their relatively disadvantaged situation in \naccess to social services and economic resources resulting from insufficient transport infrastructure. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n Yes \n\n No  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n  \nItem \n\n \n \nResettlement \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nE.
