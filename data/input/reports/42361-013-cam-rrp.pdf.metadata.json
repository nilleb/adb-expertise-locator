It  will  (i)  expand  the  electricity  transmission  infrastructure  by  constructing \n2  (ii)  support  Electricit\u00e9  du \n2,110 kilometers  (km)  of  22-kilovolt  (kV)  sub-transmission  lines,\nimplementing \nCambodge  (EDC) \nthe  operational \nthe  subprojects,  and  (iii) \neffectiveness and efficiency of EDC.3\n  \n \n\nimprove \n\nin \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n1. \n\nSocioeconomic Context \n\nCambodia\u2019s power sector was severely damaged during long periods of conflict and civil \n3. \nwar.  Private,  independent  power  producers4\n  using  their  own  generation  from  imported  diesel \nand  heavy  fuel  oil  were  engaged  in  1994  to  provide  electricity  to  main  load  centers  such  as \nPhnom Penh, Siem Reap, Sihanoukville, and other provincial towns through isolated systems. \nSince 2005, a primary focus of power development has been to build high-voltage (230 kV and \n115 kV) and medium-voltage (22 kV) sub-transmission lines to import electricity from neighbor \ncountries  and  provide  affordable  services,  build  demand,  and  facilitate  grid  extension  by \nconnecting  the  isolated  systems.  By  2012,  four  high-voltage  lines  were  in  operation,  three  at \n115 kV (414.95 km) and one at 230 kV (91 km). Development of three distinct grid systems is \nprogressing in the southern, eastern, and northeastern economic zones. \n\n4. \nAt about 26%, the rate of household electrification in Cambodia is among the lowest in \nSoutheast Asia\u201480% of Cambodia's population lives outside provincial and district towns, and \nonly 11% of households in these areas are connected to grid electricity supply, mainly through \nisolated  systems  owned  and  operated  by  private  rural  electricity  enterprises  (REEs)  that \ngenerate their own power from imported diesel and heavy fuel oil. More than 11 million people \nuse rechargeable car batteries for electricity supply, and kerosene and candles for lighting. \n\n5. \nElectricity from rechargeable car batteries and REEs is expensive. In areas supplied by \nREEs, electricity tariffs are highly volatile due to fluctuating fuel prices and range from $0.65 per \nkilowatt-hour  (kWh)  to  $0.90/kWh.  For  electricity  from  rechargeable  car  batteries,  the  cost \naverages $1.00/kWh. \n\nBesides being expensive, electricity services from REE-operated systems are generally \n6. \nunreliable and of poor quality. Coupled with high electricity costs, this severely constrains quality \nof  life.  Domestic  firms  and  foreign  investors  name  the  high  costs  and  supply  shortages  of \nelectricity as a main constraint to doing business in Cambodia. This is critical, especially as the \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The term \u201csub-transmission\u201d is applied in Cambodia to describe these lines in contrast to the distribution networks \nowned and operated by rural electricity enterprises (REEs). Sub-transmission lines transport bulk power supplies \nfrom the  high-voltage grid  to REEs.  However,  these lines  should  not  be confused  with  high-voltage  transmission \nlines\u2014in terms of their scale and impacts these sub-transmission lines are equivalent to distribution lines. \n\n3  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2010. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Preparing the Rural \n\nElectrification Project. Manila.  \n\n4  These are the REEs mentioned in footnote 2. \n\n\f2 \n\ngovernment  aims  to  diversify  from  garments  to  other  sources  of  growth,  such  as  commercial \nrice farming, other agribusiness, tourism, and light manufacturing. \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\n7. \nThe  key  organizations  in  Cambodia\u2019s  power  sector  are  the  General  Department  of \nEnergy under the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy; the Electricity Authority of Cambodia \n(EAC); EDC; REEs; and other private domestic and foreign investors. \n\n8. \nThe  General  Department  of  Energy  guides  and  supervises  the  development  of  the \npower  sector  and  is  responsible  for  overall  energy  planning,  policy,  and  strategy.  EAC  is  the \ncountry\u2019s  regulatory  agency,  responsible  for  issuing  rules,  regulations,  and  procedures  and \ngoverning  the  power  market  operators,  both  suppliers  and  users.  EDC,  the  country\u2019s  national \npower  utility,  is  responsible  for  electricity  production,  transmission,  and  distribution  in  licensed \nareas assigned to EDC by EAC. \n\n9. \nTo  supplement  the  capability  of  EDC  in  developing  power  sector  infrastructure,  the \ngovernment is encouraging the private sector to invest. The promotion of private participation in \nelectrification  is  also  anchored  in  Cambodia\u2019s  Electricity  Law  (2001).  REEs  represent  an \nimportant  private  sector-based  framework  for  developing,  operating,  and  maintaining  the \ncountry\u2019s  distribution  network.5\n  In  addition,  private  domestic  and  foreign  investors  are \nencouraged  to  invest  in  (i)  oil  and  gas  exploitation,  (ii)  energy  generation  from  indigenous \nresources such as hydropower, and (iii) developing the high-voltage transmission system. \n\n3. \n\nSubsector Problems and Constraints \n\n10. \nTechnical  sustainability.  Cambodia\u2019s  high  electricity  tariffs  are  caused  by  its  power \ninfrastructure, which is still dominated by isolated, inefficient generation and distribution systems \npowered  by  diesel  and  heavy  fuel  oil.  With  the  realization  of  large-scale  domestic  power \ngeneration,  the  electricity  grid  will  continue  to  evolve.  It  is  planned  that  by  2015,  large-scale \npower generation, mainly from hydropower, will reach 1,116 megawatts, all of which is to meet \ndomestic demand estimated to grow at an average 26% per annum up to 2015. An additional \n1,489 km of 230 kV and 115 kV transmission lines are expected to be operational by 2015. \n\n11. \nThe expansion of power generation and the high-voltage transmission network requires \nthat medium-voltage sub-transmission and low-voltage (<0.4 kV) distribution lines be developed \ncommensurately  to  transfer  electricity  to  consumers.  It  is  estimated  that  about  17,000  km  of \nmedium-voltage  sub-transmission  lines  need  to  be  built  to  connect  the  isolated  systems \nthroughout  the  country.  These  developments  will  help  displace  expensive,  unreliable,  and \nenvironmentally  and  health-wise  hazardous  off-grid  diesel  generation  by  REEs  and  will  partly \ncontribute to reducing electricity costs. EAC is implementing a tariff policy that requires REEs to \ngradually  reduce  retail  tariffs  to  at  least  $0.28/kWh  within  2\u20133  years  of  being  connected  to \nEDC\u2019s 22 kV sub-transmission backbone.6\n \n\nFinancial  capacity.  EDC  does  not  receive  budgetary  support.  It  needs  to  mobilize \n12. \nexternal financing to build the country\u2019s grid-electricity infrastructure. While independent power \nproducers are investing in power generation and construction of high-voltage transmission lines, \nEDC is primarily responsible for investing in the extension of medium-voltage sub-transmission \n\n                                                \n5  Most REEs operate under a consolidated generation and distribution license. Most of the roughly 300 licensees In \n\n2012 are consolidated licensees. \n\n6  Through the connection to EDC\u2019s 22 kV sub-transmission backbone, REEs will receive lower-cost electricity at a \nregulated bulk-supply tariff of $0.13\u2013$0.15 per kWh. The tariff is discounted depending on the distance of the REE \nfrom EDC\u2019s network. The cost savings are gradually transferred to end-consumers in public consultation with the \nserviced community. Although affordability to pay for electricity consumption must be considered, the tariff strategy \naims to encourage REEs to further expand their distribution network into lower-density, higher-cost areas. \n\n\f3 \n\nlines.  The  cost  of  doing  so  beyond  provincial  towns,  estimated  at  $21,000  per  km,  is  high. \nCoupled with low population density and low consumption, the return on investment is marginal \nand  will,  without  concessionary  financing  from  development  partners,  imperil  EDC\u2019s  long-term \nfinancial sustainability. \n\n13. \nAffordability.  Affordability  represents  a  major  barrier  to  increasing  grid-electricity \nsupply. On an average monthly income of $98, a household will need to pay $70\u2013$120 to get \nconnected to the grid (including connection fee, wiring from the meter, and house wiring). The \ngovernment  is  trying  to  relieve  the  situation  by  piloting  a  scheme  that  provides  lower-income \nhouseholds with interest-free loans to finance connection to the grid. The pilot is implemented \nby the Department of Rural Electrification Fund, a department established under EDC in August \n2012.  The  operational  capacity  of  the  department  needs  to  be  strengthened  to  scale  up  the \ninterest-free loan scheme. \n\nHuman  resource  development.  To  allow  EDC  to  efficiently  and  effectively  keep  pace \n14. \nwith  the  expansion  requirements,  human  resource  capacity  in  the  key  business  areas  of \nstrategic, operational, financial, information technology, and human resource management need \nto  be  strengthened,  and  pertinent  strategies,  policies,  processes,  and  procedures  need  to  be \nfurther updated, developed, and implemented. \n\n4. \n\nStrategy and Road Map \n\nIn  its  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  (NSDP),  2009\u20132013,  the  government \n15. \nrecognizes the importance of developing the energy sector to ensure socioeconomic growth and \nthereby  reduce  poverty  to  at  least  19.5%  by  2015.  The  government  has  developed  the  2011 \nStrategy  and  Plan  for  Development  of  Rural  Electrification  in  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia \n(SPDRE)  to  achieve  52%  household  electrification  by  2020  and  70%  household  electrification \nby  2030,  mainly  by  expanding  the  country\u2019s  grid-electricity  infrastructure.  EDC  is  primarily \nresponsible for investing in the expansion of the 22 kV sub-transmission backbone network to \nconnect the grid substations of provincial towns to existing and new distribution networks owned \nand  operated  by  REEs.  REEs  will  continue  to  play  an  important  role  in  providing  electricity  to \nconsumers after connection to EDC\u2019s sub-transmission grid. \n\n5. \n\nAsian Development Bank Sector Experience \n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  greatly  contributed  to  the  expansion  of \n16. \nelectricity access, sector reforms, and institutional capacity building by continuously supporting \nthe power sector with investments and technical assistance.7 ADB\u2019s country assistance program \nevaluation  for  Cambodia,  1998\u20132008  assessed  the  energy  sector  assistance  strategy  and \nprogram as relevant, effective, likely sustainable, and substantial in impact.8\n \n\n17. \nThe  country  assistance  program  evaluation  identified  efficiency  issues  related  to \nimplementation  delays.  Delays  can  partly  be  attributed  to  EDC\u2019s  limited  human  resource  and \noperating  capacity  for  (i)  finalizing  detailed  technical  designs,  (ii)  handling  procurement,  and \n(iii) implementing  safeguard  measures  in  an  effective  and  timely  manner.  The  risk  of \nimplementation delays under this project will be mitigated by (i) a high degree of readiness for \nsubproject \nland  clearance  and  other \ngovernment approvals, as well as advanced procurement in place before the proposed loan is \n\nimplementation  with  detailed \n\ntechnical  designs, \n\n                                                \n7  ADB.  2003.

Those objectives are fully consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy and \nits energy assessment strategy and road map for 2011\u20132013.9 Three of five subprojects to be \nfinanced  as  part  of  the  sector  loan  have  been  appraised  and  approved  with  regard  to  their \ntechnical,  financial,  economic  viability,  and  environmental  and  social  sustainability.  Two  more \nsubprojects, already determined, will be appraised and approved during the implementation of \nthe project. The sector loan approach internalizes the appraisal and approval of these additional \nsubprojects in accordance with technical, financial, economic, environmental, and social criteria \nmutually  agreed  upon  between  ADB  and  EDC.10\n With the  existence  of  a road map,  subsector \nstrategy, and institutional development framework strongly owned by the government and EDC, \nthe key requirements for using the sector loan modality are met. \n\n7. \n\nDevelopment Partner Coordination \n\n19. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination  has  in  the  past  provided  the  government  with \nopportunities to synergize interventions from ADB, the World Bank, and bilateral partners, and \nto capitalize on best practices. Physical investment requirements of an estimated $1.0 billion are \nrequired  to  achieve  the  government\u2019s  electrification  objectives,  exceeding  the  financing \navailable from any one development partner. By providing financial support for improving both \nphysical  infrastructure  and  institutional  development,  ADB  will  continue  to  add  value  to \nCambodia\u2019s  energy  sector.  Moreover,  through  effective  development  coordination,  ADB  could \nleverage additional financing for this project from OFID. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n20. \nThe  project  will  contribute  to  increasing  access  to  grid  electricity  in  Cambodia.  The \noutcome  of  the  project  is  expanded  supply  of  reliable  and  cost-effective  grid  electricity  in \nKampong Thom, Kampong Cham, Siem Reap, Kandal and Banteay Meanchey provinces. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Expanding Medium-Voltage Sub-Transmission Network \n\n21. \nComponent 1 of the project will support EDC in the expansion of 22 kV sub-transmission \nlines. These sub-transmission lines will be connected from grid substations in provincial towns to \nexisting  and  new  distribution  and  service  lines  owned  and  operated  by  REEs.  The  project  will \nfinance  the  construction  of  2,110  km  of  sub-transmission  lines  divided  into  five  provincial \nsubprojects: (i) 625 km in Kampong Thom, (ii) 184 km in Kampong Cham, (iii) 866 km in Siem \nReap,  (iv)  263  km  in  Kandal,  and  (v)  173  km  in  Banteay  Meanchey  province.  Subproject  1  in \nKampong Thom, subproject 2 in Kampong Cham, and subproject 3 in Siem Reap province have \nbeen fully appraised and approved. \n\n                                                \n9  ADB. 2011.

The required transformer capacity, medium-voltage feeder \nroute  and  rating  have  been  sized  on  peak  household  demand  assuming  a  standard  load  of \n0.375  kilovolt-ampere  per  household  and  considering  that,  within  5  years,  at  least  80%  of \nhouseholds  will  be  connected  to  the  grid.  The  grid  substations  in  Kampong  Cham,  Kampong \nThom,  and  Siem  Reap  are  currently  supplied  with  imports  from  Viet  Nam  and  Thailand.  The \npower  purchase  is  sufficient  to  service  additional  connections.  The  supply  capacity  from  grid \nsubstations in provincial towns and the voltage performance were reviewed in a power system \nanalysis. The project includes the installation of automatic voltage regulators to maintain voltage \nperformance of long medium-voltage feeders. The design for subprojects 1, 2, and 3 is found to \nbe technically viable. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nSubprojects  appraised  for  the  project  are  economically  and  financially  viable.  The \n31. \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  is  17.4%.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  3.8%.  The \neconomic and financial internal rates of return exceed the economic opportunity cost of capital \nof 12% and weighted average cost of capital of 1.6%, respectively. The economic and financial \n\n                                                \n15 Villages in Cambodia are largely linear in nature and aligned along major roads. Most villages are located within \n\n500 meters of the road. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nnet  present  values  are  positive.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  subprojects\u2019  economic  and \nfinancial internal rates of return are viable under stressed conditions. The subprojects generate \na net financial and economic surplus.16\n  \n\n32. \nA  review  of  EDC\u2019s  financial  performance  and  projections  concluded  that  EDC\u2019s  capital \nstructure  to  meet  its  debt  service  requirements  and  its  capacity  to  finance  investments  from \ninternal resources are adequate. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nEDC  has  implemented  several  high-voltage  and  medium-voltage  transmission  line \n33. \nprojects funded by ADB, other development partners, and financing institutions. EDC staff have \nextensive  experience  and  sufficient  skills \nfinancial \nmanagement,  procurement,  and  implementation  capacity  assessment  of  EDC  concluded  that \nthe  executing  agency  has  adequate  financial  accounting,  auditing  and  reporting,  procurement \nand implementation arrangements in place for implementing the project. However, EDC will be \nrequired  to  implement  multiple  transmission  line  projects  up  to  2020  that  could  constrain  its \nhuman resource capacity. Therefore, consulting services to support and complement staff in the \nimplementation of the project will be engaged. \n\nimplement  projects.  A  project \n\nto \n\n34. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and EDC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n\nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n35. \nA  household  survey  conducted  in  the  project  areas  suggests  that  the  primary  use  of \ncommercial electricity supplies is to partially replace the use of kerosene for lighting and of car \nbatteries  for  other  electrical  appliances.  With  the  development  of  the  22  kV  sub-transmission \nline  network,  the  average  electricity  cost  for  consumers  will  be  gradually  reduced  by  at  least \n60%,  allowing  households  to  increase  consumption.  Non-household  consumers  such  as  rice \nmills,  craft  work,  and  small  service  businesses  are  present  in  the  project  areas  and  economic \nactivities are likely to increase with more cost-effective and reliable electricity supply. \n\n36. \nThe Department of Rural Electrification Fund is already implementing a pilot scheme of \nproviding  lower-income  households  with  interest-free  loans  to  finance  the  connection  to  the \nelectricity grid. Component 2 of the project supports EDC with the operational integration of the \nDepartment  of  Rural  Electrification  Fund,  which  will  involve  the  development  of  strategies, \npolicies, processes, and procedures for scaling up the provision of interest-free loans to at least \n10,000 per year. The government and EDC have given their assurances to continue efforts to \nincrease connectivity of households and lower electricity costs to consumers so as to maximize \nthe socioeconomic benefits of the project. Support mechanisms are to be provided to all eligible \nhouseholds  irrespective  of  ethnicity,  gender  of  household  head,  or  other  conditions  of \nvulnerability. \n\n37.  Women occupy key roles in EDC in management, procurement, administration, finance \nand accounting, and corporate and business planning. The project supports the implementation \nof  a  human  resource  policy  encouraging  gender  balance  at  all  levels  as  well  as  capacity \ndevelopment  of  female  staff  in  the  various  departments.  In  addition,  the  project  ensures  that \n100%  of  affected  households  headed  by  women  are  consulted  on  resettlement  plans;  joint \ncertification of male and female household members is required on compensation receipts; and \n\n                                                \n16 Economic  Analysis:  Project  1  and  Financial  Analysis:  Project  1  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\nan awareness campaign to prevent HIV/AIDS, other sexually transmitted infections, and human \ntrafficking is conducted. 17\n \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nAn  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  and  resettlement  framework  has \n38. \nbeen prepared for the project in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and \nCambodia\u2019s  regulations  and  guidelines.18\n  Both  frameworks  guide  EDC  and  the  project \nimplementation consultants in preparing and implementing safeguard measures. \n\nEnvironment.  The  safeguard  category  for  the  project  is  B  for  environment.  An  initial \n39. \nenvironmental examination report with an environmental management plan and implementation \nbudget  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  will  be \n  No  component  of  any  of  the  three  appraised  subprojects  is \ndisclosed  on  ADB's  website.\nlocated in an environmentally sensitive or protected area, and adherence to good international \nconstruction practices will mitigate any potential impacts during construction. The main impact \nduring  preconstruction  will  be  the  clearing  of  unexploded  ordnance  in  the  project's  sub-\ntransmission corridor, and before civil  works begin, a certified unexploded ordnance clearance \ncertificate needs to be obtained. \n\n19\n\n40. \nResettlement and indigenous people. The safeguard category for the project is B for \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  A  resettlement  plan  with  an  estimated \ncompensation budget has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nand  will  be  disclosed  on  ADB's  website.\n  No  physical  relocation  will  be  required  and,  in  this \ncase, the term \u201cresettlement\u201d relates to limited acquisition of livelihood trees and crops. Potential \nimpacts will be limited to the installation of concrete poles using about 0.2 square meters of land \nand the stringing of conductors requiring the trimming of some tree branches. Some trees may \nneed to be removed in a few villages and market areas. The estimated impact of tree removal is \n1 tree per 2 km, including productive trees such as mango, palm, coconut, and tamarind. \n\n20\n\n41. \nThe  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework,  resettlement  framework,  initial \nenvironmental  examination,  and  resettlement  plan  were  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on \n1 October 2012. \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n42.
