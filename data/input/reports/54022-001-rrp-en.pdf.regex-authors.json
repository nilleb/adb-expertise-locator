THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed  \npolicy-based loan to the Republic of the Philippines for the Disaster Resilience Improvement \nProgram. \n \n2.   The proposed contingent disaster financing (CDF) program will provide the government \nwith rapid access to resources to initiate disaster response and early recovery efforts and address \nthe health and economic impacts of health-related emergencies with minimal delay. The program \nis aligned with the Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u20132022 in supporting the integration of \ndisaster resilience in various sectors of the economy and increasing preparedness for health-\nrelated emergencies by upgrading healthcare facilities and building human resource capacity in \nthe health system, particularly in light of the vulnerabilities exposed by the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic.1 The program is also aligned with the second strategic pillar of the \nPhilippines  country  partnership  strategy,  2018\u20132023,  which  promotes  local  economic \ndevelopment.2 The program supports Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 operational \npriorities on addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities (operational priority 1); \naccelerating progress in gender equality (operational priority 2); tackling climate change,3 building \nclimate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability (operational priority \n3); strengthening governance and institutional capacity (operational priority 6); and fostering \nregional cooperation and integration (operational priority 7).  \n    \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.   Disaster risk. The Philippines is widely regarded as one of the world\u2019s most disaster-\nprone countries,4 with a high likelihood of its economy being severely impacted by disasters.5 It \nis located along the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, making it susceptible to earthquakes and \nvolcanic eruptions.6 The country also experiences frequent tropical cyclones (typhoons), floods, \nlandslides, and droughts. Seventy-four percent of the population is vulnerable to multiple natural \nhazards. The average annual cost of disasters is estimated at 0.7%\u20131.0% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP).7 Disaster risk modeling indicates that the country faces average annual losses of \n\u20b143.5 billion due to earthquakes and \u20b1133.2 billion due to tropical cyclones.8 Most notable was \nTyphoon Yolanda (Haiyan; 2013) with over 6,000 fatalities, 16 million affected people, and losses \nof 4.7% of 2013 GDP.9 More recently, Typhoon Ompong (Mangkhut; 2018), the Mindanao \nearthquakes (2019), Typhoon Tisoy (Kammuri; 2019), and the Taal volcano eruption (2020) have \ncollectively  affected  about  6  million  people  with  damages  estimated  at  approximately  \n \n1  National Economic and Development Authority. 2017.

Recognizing these vulnerabilities, the government enacted the Philippine Disaster Risk \nReduction and Management Act of 2010 (Republic Act No. 10121),12 which: (i) strengthened risk \nreduction and management by taking a whole-of-government approach; and (ii) institutionalized \nthe Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan and associated appropriation of funds. The \ngovernment adopted its Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI) Strategy in 2015.  \n \n5.  Public health management and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Philippines has made \nsignificant improvements in the health status of its people, with life expectancy at birth improving \nfrom 63.7 years in 1980 to 71.1 years in 2018.13 About half of the provinces in the Philippines are \nmalaria-free, and the country has achieved the Millennium Development Goal for tuberculosis.14 \nPolio-free status was maintained for 3 decades before the disease returned in 2019 because of \nparents\u2019 aversion to having their children vaccinated. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an \nunprecedented health challenge for the Philippines. The first case of COVID-19 was detected on \n30 January 2020, and by March 2020 the rapidly increasing number of confirmed cases reflected \nthe extent of community transmission. As of 13 August 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases was \n147,526  with  2,426  deaths  and  70,387  recovered. 15  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  put \nconsiderable stress on the health system, with exposed frontline health workers at particular risk \nof contracting the disease.  \n \n6.   Government response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 8 March 2020, Presidential \nProclamation No. 922 was issued declaring a state of public health emergency throughout the \nPhilippines due to COVID-19,16 which intensified government reporting and enforced quarantine, \ndisease control, and prevention measures. This was followed by a temporary closure of schools \nin Metro Manila. Further, on 16 March 2020, Presidential Proclamation No. 929 was issued \ndeclaring  a  state  of  calamity  nationwide,  together  with  enhanced  community  quarantine  in \nLuzon.17 On 24 March 2020, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal \nas One Act, which enabled measures to  address the COVID-19 pandemic. These included:  \n(i) augmenting operational budgets, financial assistance programs, and food programs of national \ngovernment agencies, the National Disaster Risk and Reduction Management Fund, and the \nQuick Response Funds of the Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of Social Welfare \nand Development; and (ii) authorizing local government units (LGUs) to utilize more than the \nmandated 5% allocated for their local disaster risk and reduction management funds, subject to \nfunding from the national government. On 22 May 2020, Inter-Agency Task Force Resolution  \n \n10 Estimates provided by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), citing sources \nfrom national government agencies. \n11 These include some of the most vulnerable rural fishing and agricultural provinces\u2014Albay, Camarines Sur, \nCatanduanes, and Sorsogon in the Bicol region (Region V)\u2014with a total population of 5.8 million, and the largely \nrural coastal provinces of Eastern and Western Samar and Leyte in the Eastern Visayas Region (Region VIII) with a \ntotal population of 4.0 million.  \n12 Republic Act No. 10121. http://www.ndrrmc.gov.ph/attachments/article/45/Republic_Act_10121.pdf \n13 World Bank.

The government has initiated a comprehensive response to the COVID-19 pandemic with \na fiscal stimulus program of $12.8 billion. On 23 April 2020, ADB approved the $1.5 billion  \nCOVID-19  Active  Response  and  Expenditure  Support  (CARES)  Program  to  support  the \ngovernment response.20 In May 2020, 900,000 units of personal protective equipment (PPE) were \nprocured, 90-day forecasts for required PPE are regularly calculated, and local production of PPE \nhas been initiated. Polymerase chain reaction and GeneXpert21 testing capacity has increased \nwith a maximum of 36,567 daily tests performed by a total of 102 laboratories as of 11 August \n2020, with capacity to administer up to 90,694 tests per day. The national health insurance \nagency, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, has expanded insurance coverage to \ninclude polymerase chain reaction testing, isolation services, and treatment of COVID-19. Income \ntransfers have helped to provide basic livelihood support to families engaged in the informal \nsector. As of 12 August 2020, 24.5 million families had received emergency cash subsidies of \n\u20b1142.2 billion.22 Under the government\u2019s small business wage Enhanced Community subsidy \nscheme, 3.1 million formal workers in small businesses unable to work during the Quarantine \nperiod received wage subsidies totaling \u20b146 billion.23   \n \n8.  Prior to the pandemic, the economy grew by 6.3% per year on average during 2010\u20132019, \ndriven by robust domestic investment and strong performance in agriculture and construction.  \nThe economy was initially forecast to grow by 6.2% in 2020; however, with the COVID-19 \noutbreak, it is now forecast to contract by 3.8%.24  The real sector has been severely impacted \nas most businesses are unable to operate, together with significant disruptions to global supply \nchains and the sharp decline in tourist arrivals. Livelihoods have been adversely affected. The \nApril 2020 labor force survey showed the unemployment rate at 17.7%. The pandemic will reverse \nthe gains in poverty reduction. An additional 5.5 million Filipinos are expected to fall into poverty, \nwith poverty incidence estimated to rise to 20.7% in 2020 (footnote 20). In its COVID-19 recovery \nplanning, the government also needs to address the long-standing problem of income inequality. \nThe degree of income inequality in the Philippines exceeds that of its regional peers, with the \nnational average masking significant regional disparities within the country.25  \n \n9.  Development constraints. The Philippines faces four development constraints. First, \ndisaster resilience policy making and coordination at the national level are fragmented across \nmultiple agencies, and there is insufficient support to build resilience in the most vulnerable \nprovinces and urban areas. Second, there is inadequate integration of disaster risk reduction \n(DRR) and climate change adaptation in local government planning and infrastructure investment \nplanning, which ultimately delays the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Third, \nthere are no clear and cohesive policy frameworks or protocols in the health and social assistance \nsystems to prepare for and proactively respond to epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, \nalthough the government reacts with speed within its constraints. These undermine levels of \npreparedness, result in delays in early recovery and rehabilitation, and exacerbate the economic \nand social impacts of physical losses following a disaster. They also place a strain on the health \n \n18 IATF Resolution No. 38. https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2020/05may/20200522-IATF-RESOLUTION-\nNO-38.pdf \n19 Philippine News Agency. https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1105226  \n20 ADB. 2020.

Fourth, disaster risk financing capacity is insufficient, as evidenced \nby the limited use of traditional and innovative risk retention and risk transfer instruments.  \nPost-disaster financing constraints restrict the opportunities to build back better and enhance \nresilience to future hazard events. \n \n10.  ADB engagement and lessons learned. ADB has extended significant post-disaster \nsupport to the Philippines dating back as far as Typhoon Sisang (Nina; 1987),26 with a total \npresent value of rehabilitation and reconstruction of damaged public assets at $1.78 billion.27 \nHowever, support had been primarily reactive (ex post) and ADB began to explore viable risk \ntransfer  solutions  for  financing  reconstruction,  to  enable  the  government  to  access  rapid  \npost-disaster liquidity and spread the costs of recovery and reconstruction over time.28 The speed \nof the response of the contingent financing instruments provided by the World Bank and Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA) to the Philippines after Typhoons Yolanda and Ompong \nalso demonstrated the importance of an instrument such as the CDF for disaster preparedness \nand response.29 The proposed CDF will form an integral part of the Philippines\u2019 broader disaster \nrisk financing framework under its DRFI Strategy, support rapid provision of liquidity for timely \ndisaster and health emergency response, and help the government to manage the fiscal risk \narising from disasters triggered by natural hazards and pandemics.30 \n \n11.   As a policy-based instrument, the proposed program provides an opportunity for ADB to \nengage in policy dialogue with the government and also build on ongoing reform programs. ADB \nis currently engaged with the government to strengthen local governance in the Philippines,31 and \nis expanding support to the employment program of the Department of Labor and Employment \n(DOLE) to include child labor prevention programs, including addressing increased vulnerability \nto child labor resulting from the economic impact of disasters and pandemics on poor families. \nThrough its reforms, the proposed program can also address disaster risk management and \nhealth policy bottlenecks in investment projects in these areas.32  \n \n12.   Development partner coordination on disaster risk management. The Department of \nFinance (DOF) leads development partner coordination through its DRFI Strategy, as it seeks to \nrefine its approach and achieve an adequate and cost-effective portfolio of disaster risk financing \ninstruments. With development partner support, the government has taken further measures to \nimprove its financial preparedness for disasters, utilizing contingent credit facilities and innovative \ninsurance and insurance-linked securities. The World Bank and JICA have been active in this \n \n26 ADB assistance includes $500.0 million emergency assistance loan for Typhoon Yolanda (ADB. 2013.

The second Cat \nDDO closed in March 2020 (footnote 29). In 2014, JICA provided a \u00a550 billion Post-Disaster \nStand-by Loan (footnote 29).The government launched a pilot in August 2017, with technical \nsupport from the World Bank, to provide $206 million in modeled loss parametric insurance \ncoverage through the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) against losses from tropical \ncyclones and earthquakes to national government assets and 25 provinces located along the \neastern seaboard. Premiums were funded through a \u20b11 billion ($19.8 million) allocation in the \n2017 General Appropriations Act, under the National Disaster Risk and Reduction Management \nFund.33 In November 2019, the World Bank issued two tranches of 3-year catastrophe-linked \nbonds to provide the Philippines with financial protection of up to $75 million against losses from \nearthquakes and $150 million against losses from tropical cyclones.34 On 15 April 2020, the World \nBank approved its $500 million Third Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Loan.35 \n \n13.   Development partner coordination in response to COVID-19. Since the onset of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, ADB has coordinated with the United Nations agencies \nand  other  development  partners.  Following  the  World  Health  Organization\u2019s  Strategic \nPreparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19, the Philippines has adopted a whole-of-society \ncoordination mechanism, comprising the DOH, the World Health Organization, the National \nDisaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), government stakeholders, the \nprivate  sector,  and  nongovernment  organizations  such  as  the  Philippine  Red  Cross.

To  complement  ADB\u2019s  previous  and  ongoing  support  to  the \nPhilippines, including the CARES Program,37 the policy actions under the proposed program will \nstrengthen disaster resilience of Philippine institutions and communities and the government\u2019s \nresponse to pandemics through three reform areas: policy and institutional arrangements for \ndisaster risk management and health-related emergencies, including social protection; resilience \nof national government assets and LGUs to disaster and climate risks; and disaster risk financing. \nThe outcome of the program is that the disaster resilience and pandemic response of institutions \nand communities will be strengthened, and financial preparedness for disasters improved. The \nCARES Program supported the government\u2019s COVID-19 Response Program, which included the \nprovision of laboratories and health facilities, and expanded the essential unconditional cash \ntransfer support to 18 million families. The Disaster Resilience Improvement Program supports \nmedium-term pandemic response reforms beyond the government\u2019s immediate COVID-19 needs \nsupported by the CARES Program. The proposed program responds directly to the COVID-19 \npandemic with support for urgent response measures required by the government to prepare for \n \n33 This program was renewed with a \u20b12 billion allocation in 2018 and discontinued at the end of 2019. \n34 World Bank. https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2019/11/25/world-bank-catastrophe-bond-transact-\nion-insures-the-republic-of-philippines-against-natural-disaster-related-losses-up-to-usd225-million. \n35 World Bank. 2020.

Reform area 1: Policy and institutional arrangements for disaster risk management, \nincluding  social  protection.  Under  this  reform  area,  a  consolidated  bill  to  establish  the \nDepartment of Disaster Resilience was submitted to Congress. The new department will merge \nthe functions of the NDRRMC and Office of Civil Defense to develop policies and implement DRR \nand management programs. Creating one department will help to integrate efforts that address \nthe concerns and needs of segments of the population with special needs or vulnerabilities such \nas women, children, the elderly, people with disabilities, and indigenous peoples with respect to \ndisaster resilience and disaster management. It will also result in a speedier response by the \ngovernment by considerably reducing coordination difficulties and bureaucratic inefficiencies.  \n \n16.  Because  disasters  disproportionately  affect  women  and  children,  their  occurrence  \ncorrelates with increases in child labor.39 To address this, DOLE implemented its Child Labor \nPrevention and Elimination Program (CLPEP). CLPEP profiled 275,614 children at risk of child \nlabor in 2018 and 2019, and provided (i) referral services for mothers and child laborers to support \nservices (such as education, employment, and medical assistance) and (ii) monitoring and \nremoval from child labor. The DOLE Integrated Livelihood Program40 administers the livelihood \nassistance grants for CLPEP. Between 2019 and March 2020, the DOLE Integrated Livelihood \nAssistance Program provided \u20b1712.4 million of livelihood grants, a portion of which benefited \n32,475 women. The DOLE has submitted a budget of \u20b11.5 billion to the Department of Budget \nand Management for inclusion in the 2021 national budget, of which \u20b1145.5 million will be \nallocated for livelihood assistance to parents of child laborers.  Providing essential livelihood \nsupport to poor families reduces their vulnerability to child labor resulting from the socioeconomic \nimpact of disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n \n17.  The government has also developed an innovative and timely Risk Resiliency Program to \nestablish climate- and disaster-resilient communities within 17 provinces and four major urban \ncenters, all of which are highly vulnerable to drought, flooding, landslides, and storm surge.41 This \nprogram supports vulnerable agriculture and fishing communities, ensures resilience of critical \ninfrastructure, and enhances knowledge and access to information through capacity building of \nnational and local government agencies. To increase women\u2019s adaptive and coping capacities, \nthe Risk Resiliency Program allocated \u20b137.5 million for 2020\u20132022 to create opportunities for \nwomen\u2019s enterprises and empowerment in priority landscapes and provinces. Institutionalizing \nnational and local government climate change and disaster risk policies will prioritize and expand \ninvestment in climate and disaster resilience, in line with the national DRFI Strategy. \n \n18.   Policy and institutional arrangements for health-related emergencies. In the absence \nof a globally and commercially available COVID-19 vaccine in the short term, a comprehensive \nand systematic approach to testing, as well as improvement in the country\u2019s testing capacity, \n \n38 ADB. 2020.

COVID-19 impact on child labour and forced labour: The response of the \nIPEC+ Flagship Programme. Geneva \n40 The DOLE Integrated Livelihood Program or Kabuhayan seeks to reduce the vulnerability to risks of the poor, \nvulnerable, and marginalized workers by providing them with access to grant assistance for capacity building on \nlivelihood ventures, either for individual or group undertakings. Eligible beneficiaries include marginalized fishing \ncommunities, women and youth, parents of child laborers, and elderly workers. \n41 The 17 provinces are Masbate, Sorsogon, Negros Oriental, Samar, Sarangani, Surigao del Sur, Surigao del Norte, \nDinagat Islands, Eastern Samar, Southern Leyte, Zamboanga del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Bukidnon, Maguindanao, \nNorth Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, and Sulu. The four major urban centers are Metro Manila, Metro Cebu, Metro Iloilo, \nand Metro Davao. \n ", "7 \nbecome  critical  factors  in  getting  the  economy  back  to  normal.  First,  in  March  2020,  the \ngovernment adopted the Philippine National Contingency Plan for COVID-19 that provides a \nframework to strengthen its capacity for detection, equip and train national rapid response teams, \nand strengthen infection prevention and control among healthcare workers. This includes training \nLGU healthcare workers on case investigation and contact tracing procedures to ensure effective \ncase  management  and  continuity  of  essential  health  services.  Second,  in  April  2020,  the \ngovernment  adopted  a  testing  capacity  policy  to  complement  the  establishment  of  a  new \nmolecular diagnostics laboratory (footnote 46). This will  allow the government to establish \nguidelines for testing targets, including: (i) prioritizing the testing of frontline healthcare workers, \nof which 75% are women; (ii) allowing all subnational laboratories to allocate up to 30% of their \ndaily testing capacity to healthcare workers; and (iii) testing procedures for complete lockdown \nscenarios. Third, in June 2020, the government prepared a draft of the Philippine Health Facility \nDevelopment Plan, 2020\u20132040 to strengthen hospital resilience and inclusiveness and to better \nmanage pandemics through healthcare facilities. Upgrading of government hospitals is under \nway, with a focus on capacities that will strengthen COVID-19 and other pandemic resilience. \nFinally,  the  Philippine  Commission  on  Women  issued  guidelines  that  require  government \nagencies to address COVID-19-related gender issues in their annual gender and development \nplans and budgets, collect disaggregated data on personnel and beneficiaries, prevent gender-\nbased violence and discrimination against women, and regularly inform men and women about \nawareness programs to prevent the spread of COVID-19. \n \n19.  Reform area 2: Resilience of national government assets and local government \nunits to disaster and climate risks. Under this reform area, the government has mainstreamed \nclimate change adaptation and DRR in the comprehensive development plans of LGUs (provinces, \ncities, and municipalities). In addition, the government enhanced existing LGU assessment \nsystems by: (i) developing the Local Resilience Readiness Monitoring Framework, the disaster \naudit component of the Local Governance Performance Management System\u2013Seal of Good \nLocal Governance (LGPMS-SGLG); and (ii) strengthening the assessment criteria in the LGPMS-\nSGLG through social protection mechanisms for gender and development plans to address \nviolence against women and to introduce maternal care insurance packages.42 The LGPMS-\nSGLG  enables  LGUs  to  access  the  Performance  Challenge  Fund  to  finance  their  local \ndevelopment initiatives and other Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) \nprograms. The Local Resilience Readiness Monitoring Framework serves as an assessment tool \nfor evaluating LGUs and broadens the scope of disaster preparedness expected for long-term \nrisk, imminent threats, and disaster recovery. It also serves as a way for LGUs to track their \nprogress and for the DILG and development partners to provide more focused interventions to \nidentify gaps and build local DRR capacity.  \n \n20.  Reform area 3: Disaster risk financing. Under this reform area, the GSIS approved the \nestablishment of a voluntary city-level parametric disaster insurance scheme on a pilot basis for \nearthquake and typhoon cover, with the possibility of an additional flood risk model. The pilot \nscheme will help inform the city-level insurance scheme before it is mainstreamed, as the GSIS \nintends to learn from such an experiment on a smaller scale. The pilot will target the 17 cities \nengaged under the ADB-led proposed Philippine City Disaster Insurance Pool project, across \nMetro Manila, Mindanao, Visayas, and Luzon.43 This pilot insurance scheme will be the first of its \nkind in Southeast Asia and will help inform similar ADB-designed projects in the future. The \nparametric disaster insurance scheme provides participating cities with timely financial resources \n \n42 Assessment criteria for provinces and cities include a gender and development (GAD) focal point system, an updated \nGAD code, a GAD database, GAD accomplishment reports, plans, and budget; and for cities, 100% of barangays \nwith Violence Against Women and Children desks and reports. \n43 ADB. 2018.

It bolsters their fiscal resilience, and provides predictable payout \nexpectations and a solution to narrow the funding gap between available resources and post-\ndisaster response costs for severe events. Finally, in light of the January 2020 eruption of the \nTaal volcano, the GSIS extended its indemnity disaster insurance coverage to include storm surge \nand volcanic eruptions. GSIS engages in institutional dialogue through its members forum to \naddress arising gender issues as part of its client-focused gender and development mandate.  \n \n21.   Post-program partnership framework. To ensure the continuity of reforms through \nstructured policy dialogue, the program incorporates a post-program partnership framework \n(PPPF). The framework will support climate tagging of expenditures and DRR tagging of national \nagency  and  LGU  budgets,  including  expenditures  that  relate  to  gender  and  women\u2019s \nconsiderations in the implementation of programs and policies. It will support the update of: (i) the \nNational Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan, 2011\u20132028; (ii) the Climate Change \nAdaptation, Mitigation, and Disaster Risk Reduction Road Map to reflect revisions to the National \nDisaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan; and (iii) the National Climate Change Action \nPlan, including efforts to improve the resilience of healthcare systems to  address disease \noutbreaks. In addition, the PPPF will help implement the government\u2019s testing capacity policy, \nincluding data sharing with its neighbors in ASEAN. A comprehensive gender-responsive and \nsocially inclusive training module and a training-of-trainers program will be rolled out to state \nuniversities and colleges. The government will develop an enhanced project development and \nevaluation manual of the National Economic and Development Authority to incorporate climate \nand disaster risk parameters in project preparation and appraisal. Finally, the program will support \nthe implementation of a city-level parametric disaster insurance scheme covering earthquake and \ntyphoons, with a target to recruit up to 20 cities per year during 2021\u20132023, and to build the \ncapacities of LGU beneficiaries to address gender and social inclusion issues in the use of \ninsurance proceeds. ADB will secure funding for the technical assistance that will support priority \nactivities during 2020\u20132023. \n \n22.   ADB\u2019s value addition in disaster risk management. The proposed program fulfills the \ndual objectives of supporting fundamental DRR reforms and providing quick-disbursing financing \nfor disaster preparedness and response (recovery and reconstruction). Working closely with \ndevelopment  partners,  ADB  has  provided  substantial  inputs  to  several  damage,  loss,  and  \npost-disaster  needs  assessments  of  natural  hazards,  which  formed  the  basis  for  all  ADB \nassistance. A $1 million technical assistance grant supported the assessment of DRF needs of \n17 cities across four regions in the country, DRF capacity building of local DRR and management \noffices,  and  a  parametric  insurance  pool  design.44  ADB  provided  legal  support,  financial \nstructuring,  actuarial  and  economic  modeling,  and  the  development  of  an  asset  exposure \ndatabase for a city-level parametric disaster insurance scheme. ADB has also supported several  \nknowledge-sharing initiatives through national workshops, and the ASEAN and Asia-Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation conferences participated in by Philippine representatives from cities \nselected to pilot the parametric disaster insurance scheme and national government agencies. \nADB\u2019s support for the Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services (Kalahi-CIDSS) \nprogram has been instrumental in building capacity of local communities in the aftermath of \ndisasters (footnote 26). \n \n23.   ADB\u2019s value addition in COVID-19 response. ADB has mobilized significant advisory \nand financial support for the government\u2019s pandemic response. In addition to the $1.5 billion \nCARES Program loan (footnote 20), ADB approved: (i) $200 million of additional financing to the \nSocial Protection Support Project to support emergency cash assistance to poor and vulnerable \n \n44 ADB. 2018. Philippine City Disaster Insurance Pool Rationale and Design. Manila. \n ", "9 \nhouseholds;45 (ii) a $3 million Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund grant to procure and establish \na modern laboratory at the J.B. Lingad Memorial Regional Hospital in San Fernando City, \nPampanga;46 (iii) the $5 million Bayan Bayanihan emergency grant for food distribution;47 and  \n(iv) policy advisory support on the design of wage subsidies, setting up a social unemployment \ninsurance scheme, and tax and financial relief for small- and medium-sized enterprises. ADB is \ncarrying  out  a  survey  of  business  establishments  to  collect  quantitative  data  on  output, \nemployment, and revenues. This will support a better understanding of the pandemic\u2019s impact on \nthe economy and enable ADB to help the government design an effective recovery strategy. ADB \nwill provide a bespoke coordination and monitoring framework to support effective implementation \nof the CARES Program and establish synergies with ADB CARES programs for other developing \nmember countries. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n24.  The impact of the program is aligned with the Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u20132022 \n(footnote 1) with regard to reduced vulnerability to climate change and disaster risk, strengthened \nintegration of disaster resilience in various sectors of the economy, and improved access to \nhealthcare. The impact of the program is demonstrated through the performance indicators in the \ndesign and monitoring framework.48 The program impact assessment concludes that the reform \nachieved under the program is expected to mitigate $692.4 million\u2013$1,275.7 million of damage \nand losses from natural hazards at present value, accrued during 2020\ua7f72025.49 Meanwhile, the \nCOVID-19 pandemic is estimated to cause economic losses of about $25.6 billion or 7.7% of GDP \nin 2020. The benefits result from the government\u2019s rapid access to resources that would enable \nthe government to initiate a timely response, thereby mitigating the indirect economic and social \nimpact of disasters and pandemics. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n \n25. The  government  has requested  a  loan  of  $500  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan \nagreement.  The  government  has  chosen  option  1  of  the  CDF  policy  where,  upon  loan \neffectiveness, the committed CDF amount will be available for disbursement immediately after a \ndisaster occurs.50 The government will pay a one-time front-end fee of 0.25% of the committed \nloan amount, which may be financed out of the loan proceeds. If the undisbursed loan amount is \nrenewed for an additional 3-year loan availability period (up to four times), the borrower will pay \na fee of 0.25% of the renewal amount (up to the undisbursed loan balance) each time, which may \nalso be financed out of the loan proceeds. The loan size is based on the Philippines\u2019 development \nfinancing needs. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, overall financing needs will reach record \nlevels, with the government requiring $58 billion for 2020.  \n \n45 ADB.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.   Institutional arrangements. The DOF will be the program\u2019s executing agency and will \noversee and coordinate the timely implementation of the program. The implementing agencies \nare the National Economic and Development Authority, DILG, the Department of Environment \nand Natural Resources, DOLE, the Office of Civil Defense (which serves as the implementing arm \nof  the  NDRRMC),  the  Climate  Change  Commission,  GSIS,  the  Philippine  Commission  on \nWomen, and the DOH. The program will be completed in 2023. Renewal of the program is subject \nto reconfirmation of the adequacy of the macroeconomic environment, the Philippines\u2019 continued \nprogress toward the PPPF, and an updated PPPF with mutually agreed objectives for the \nsubsequent  availability  period.  The  renewal  may  also  be  affected  by  changes  in  country \nclassification during the program period. \n \n27.   Disbursement  triggers  and  approach.  Disbursement  triggers  will  not  be  applied \nretroactively. For natural hazards, withdrawal requests will be deferred until the President of the \nPhilippines has declared a state of calamity in accordance with Republic Act No. 10121 (first \nparagraph,  Section  16)  or  taken  equivalent  measures.  For  health-related  emergencies, \nwithdrawal requests will be deferred until one of the following three conditions is satisfied: (i) the \nborrower has enacted a law in response to a public health emergency; (ii) the President of the \nPhilippines has declared a state of public health emergency in accordance with Republic Act No. \n11332, Section 7; or (iii) the President of the Philippines has issued a proclamation or an executive \norder (or other equivalent Presidential instruments) declaring or describing a worsening health \nsituation,51 or imposing an enhanced community quarantine or its functional equivalent. The \nPresident of the Philippines may authorize the Inter Agency Task Force for the Management of \nEmerging Infectious Diseases to impose an enhanced community quarantine or its functional \nequivalent, and under such a circumstance, a resolution by the Task Force will be deemed \nequivalent to imposition by the President himself/herself. The terms \u201cimposing\u201d, \u201cimpose\u201d, or \n\u201cimposition\u201d in this paragraph shall refer to (i) a new imposition, (ii) a reinstatement after a period \nof a break, or (iii) an extension of an enhanced community quarantine, which is imposed after the \ndate of the Loan Agreement. The government may withdraw the loan proceeds partially or \nentirely, depending on its assessment of the severity of the disaster or health-related emergency \nand resulting need. Only a single withdrawal may be requested per disaster or health emergency \nevent, and the request must be received by ADB within 90 days of the declaration of a state of \ncalamity or emergency. Any unutilized funds at the conclusion of the loan availability period may \nbe  disbursed  to  the  Philippines  under  the  deferred  disbursement  option,  subject  to  ADB \nreconfirming the Philippines\u2019 continuation of policy actions and the PPPF through submission of \na progress report. Funds will be spent through national budget processes for eligible items. \nProceeds of the CDF will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time). ADB will periodically monitor the continuing implementation \nof the policy targets and the PPPF during the availability period. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n28.   Safeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis  classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples \nsafeguards. The program is not expected to have any environmental or social safeguards impacts \nwithin the meaning of the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n29.  Gender.  The  program  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Women  are \ndisproportionately affected by climate change and disasters because of gendered vulnerabilities. \n \n51 The list of proclamations and executive orders can be found in the Official Gazette.  \n ", "11 \nAs such, women and children are 14 times more likely to succumb to disasters compared to \nmen.52 Key issues Filipino women face during disasters are: (i) increased vulnerability to gender-\nbased violence (footnote 52) (in normal times, one in four women aged 15\u201349 has experienced \nphysical, sexual or emotional violence committed by their husband or partner);53 (ii) compromised \nsexual and reproductive health services, and psychosocial counseling; (iii) a lack of gender-\nresponsive facilities and products; (iv) increased unpaid care and community work; and (v) limited \nmobility and skills typically taught to men, such as swimming and climbing, thereby hindering their \nself-rescue and self-defense capabilities. With this, children of vulnerable women are more likely \nto drop out of school and become child laborers to help the family to survive through  an \nemergency. The program addresses these issues through legislation, creating the Department of \nDisaster Resilience, which, among others, addresses the needs of segments with increased \nvulnerabilities, such as women, children, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and indigenous \npeoples.  \n \n30.  The program also provides guidance for all national government agencies to integrate \nmeasures to address COVID-19-related gender issues in their annual gender and development \nplans and budgets, and to allocate budgets to create opportunities for women\u2019s enterprises and \nempowerment as part of the government\u2019s Risk Resiliency Program. This includes dialogue to \naddress gender issues in government-issued indemnity insurance policies, prioritizing testing of \nfrontline healthcare workers (of which 75% are women), and directing all subnational laboratories \nto allocate 20%\u201330% of their daily testing capacity to healthcare workers and training LGU \nhealthcare workers in case management and contact tracing procedures. DOLE is implementing \nits Child Labor Prevention and Elimination Program, providing livelihood assistance to mothers \nand families of child laborers who are particularly vulnerable during disasters and pandemics. The \ngovernment is also enhancing performance indicators for LGUs, which include gender and \ndevelopment mechanisms to encompass LGUs\u2019 existing hazard profiles and disaster risks. \n \n31.   Governance. While the 2016 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability report is \nbeing  updated,  the  government  has  set  an  aggressive  reform  agenda  to  promote  better \ngovernance. The framework of the Public Financial Management Reform Roadmap, 2017\u20132022 \naims to strengthen the foundation of the public financial management system.54 Key reforms aim \nto  improve  costing,  cash  management,  planning  and  budgeting,  and  procurement.  The \ngovernment's performance relative to international fiscal transparency standards and indicators \nof  corruption  has  improved.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government, including the DOF.  \n \n32.   Poverty and social. The program supports sound policy frameworks at the national and \nlocal government level, based on pro-poor and gender-sensitive development strategies, to \nsupport poverty eradication. The government\u2019s policies ensure mobilization of resources from \nvarious sources to provide adequate and predictable financing for disaster insurance for the poor \nand vulnerable. The policies also build resilience of the poor and vulnerable by reducing their \nexposure and vulnerability to extreme weather and geophysical events; epidemics; pandemics; \nand other economic, social, and environmental shocks.
