The Project will maintain the momentum for \nthe reform process to create an enabling environment that will put \nRPCs  on  a  sound  financial  footing  for  long-term  sustainability \nwithout external assistance. This development will improve RPCs\u2019 \nprofitability and enable them to provide the estate workers with \nbetter working and living conditions, which are currently very poor. \nThe  Project  will  provide  long-term  financing  to  meet  RPCs\u2019 \ninvestment needs. A plantation fund (PF) will be established to \ninvest  in  equity  and  quasi-equity  instruments  of  RPCs  as  an \nalternative to traditional collateral-based lending. The Project will \naddress  the  estate  workers\u2019  poor  working,  living,  and  social \nconditions through a social component that includes amenities in \nthe residential and work areas, and empowerment of the workers \nthrough  strengthened  estate-level  institutions,  awareness \nprograms,  and  training.  Attention  will  be  paid  to  marketing \ninitiatives  and  institutional  strengthening  to  address  the  current \noverly regulated marketing of tea and to give RPCs easier access \nto export markets. \n   \nRationale  With 20 RPCs divested under the ongoing project, the sector\u2019s \nperformance  has  improved  in  terms  of  yields,  production,  and \nprofitability. However, the sector is still faced with high production \ncost and low profitability because of the legacy of neglect and poor \nmanagement  during  nationalization.  Due  to  the  excessive \nregulations,  including  restrictions  on  direct  exports  of  tea,  the \nsector has remained a producer of primary commodities and has \nnot diversified sufficiently to broaden its profit base. The banking \nsystem provides no long-term financing for long-term investments. \nThe sector also faces a looming labor shortage because of out-\nmigration and voluntary youth unemployment stemming from the \npoor living and working conditions of the estate workers that have \nstigmatized estate employment. Further assistance is needed to \ntransform  producers  of  primary  commodities  to  agribusiness \nentities capable of providing a competitive remuneration package \nto  attract  and  retain  the  talents  needed  for  development. \nAssistance to the divested RPCs is justified because the sector  is ", "  iii\n \n  one of the largest exporters and employers with 265,000 estate \nworkers. \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The Project aims to (i) enhance the profitability of the sector, and \n(ii) improve the living and working conditions of the estate workers. \nThe  project  area  covers  15  districts  where  RPC  estates  are \nlocated.  The  project  components  comprise  (i)  an  investment \ncomponent to provide long-term finance in the form of a credit line \nand  equity  and  quasi-equity  instruments  for  tea,  rubber  and \ncoconuts; crop and noncrop diversification; factory consolidation \nand automation; and effluent treatment plants and marketing; (ii) a \nsocial and environmental component to cover self-help housing \nand  amenities,  social  awareness  programs,  strengthening  of \nestate-level institutions, and land surveys to enhance planning and \nland use;  (iii) marketing initiatives through product research and \ndevelopment; fair trade labeling; and support for compliance with \nrequirements of ethical trade; and (iv) institutional strengthening \nthrough support for an industry umbrella body, consulting services, \nand training and development of outgrower models. The Project is \nexpected to replant and infill 1,750 hectares (ha) and 2,370 ha of \ntea, replant 3,750 ha of rubber, plant 2,500 ha of oil palm and \n10,000  ha  of  forest  plantation,  and  establish  five  marketing \nalliances. The Project will provide housing loans to 6,000 estate \nworkers, reroof 11,000 line rooms and provide welfare facilities and \namenities in the workplace. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $114.4 million equivalent, with \n$34.4 million (30%) in foreign exchange and $80.0 million (70%) \nequivalent in local currency.   \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million)\nSource               Foreign        Local        Total \n                             Exchange   Currency   Cost    Percent \n \nADB-OCR Loan       5.6             4.4         10.0           9 \nADB-ADF Loan       7.6           12.4         20.0         17 \nPFIs  -   8.5           8.5           7 \nBeneficiaries         -              38.3         38.3         34  \nGovernment       21.2           16.4         37.6         33 \n \nTotal                   34.4           80.0       114.4       100 \nADB=Asian Development Bank, ADF=Asian Development Fund, OCR=ordinary \ncapital resources, PFI=Participating Financial Institutions. \n   \n   \n ", " iv \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of Y1,171,600,000 (equivalent to $10,000,000) from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased lending facility for the investment component. The loan will \nhave  a  20-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-\nend fee of 1.0%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft Loan and Project Agreements. \n \nThe  equivalent  in  various  currencies  of  SDR15,043,000 \n($20,000,000)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  will  be \nprovided for the other components. The loan will have a maturity \nperiod of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, with an \ninterest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum during the amortization period. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The OCR loan will be used for a credit line and to establish the PF. \nTerms  The  funds  will  be  relent  to  the  participating  financial  institution \n(PFIs) through the apex body and the PF at the average weighted \ndeposit rate (AWDR). The PFIs will onlend to eligible subborrowers \nat AWDR plus a maximum spread of 5%. The PF will invest in \nequity and quasi-equity instruments of RPCs. \n \nA portion of the loan from Special Funds will be relent through the \napex body to qualified financial institutions at AWDR and this will \nbe onlent to estate workers for housing loans at AWDR plus  a \nmaximum 5% spread. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2008 \nCompletion Date   \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Plantation Industries (MPI) \n   \nImplementation  The project implementing unit (PIU) established in MPI for the \nArrangements  ongoing  project  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project \nimplementation  and  supervision.  The  PIU  will  implement  the \nProject  in  collaboration  with  the  Plantation  Housing  and  Social \nWelfare Trust (PHSWT), DFCC Bank, PFIs, the PF, the Planters\u2019 \nAssociation (PA), and nongovernment organization (NGOs). The \nPHSWT will assist in the self-help housing loan scheme, common \namenities, and social awareness programs. DFCC Bank will be the \napex body responsible for designating the PFIs and channeling to \nthem the funds for the credit lines. The PFIs will onlend to eligible \nsubborrowers  for  the  investment  component  and  the  self-help \nhousing loan scheme while the PF will invest in equity and quasi-\nequity instruments of eligible RPCs. PA will assist in identifying \ngaps in expertise in RPCs and recruiting of consultants and NGOs. \nThe NGOs will assist in implementing the social programs and fair \ntrade labeling. ", "  v\n \nProcurement  Goods and services for implementing the Project will be procured \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The OCR \nloan  for  the  credit  line  and  the  PF  will  follow  procurement \nprocedures  applicable  to  ADB  loans  for  development  finance \ninstitutions. Civil works to be carried out by RPCs may be done on \na force account basis. Civil works that will not be carried out by \nRPCs  may  be  undertaken  through  local  competitive  bidding  in \naccordance with procedures acceptable to ADB. \n   \nConsulting Services  PA will engage 23 person-months of international and 24 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services in consultation with the \nPIU  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging domestic consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The overall Project has a financial internal rate of return of 14% \nBeneficiaries  and economic internal rate of return of 16%. The beneficiaries are \nthe privatized RPCs and the 265,000 estate workers. The Project \nis  expected  to  enhance  the  profitability  of  the  RPCs  through \nimproved productivity, diversification, and marketing initiatives. The \nquantifiable  benefits  include  incremental  annual  production  of \n5,000 tons of tea and 7,900 tons of rubber with an export value of \n$8.5 million per annum; $2.8 million in export value from crop \ndiversification per annum; and  $10 million in incremental income \nfrom  marketing  alliances.    The  nonquantifiable  benefits  include \ngreater  opportunities  for  value  addition,  direct  sales,  enhanced \nbuyer-friendly processes, and improved outward-bound logistics. \nEnhanced profitability will give rise to more gainful employment \nand  increased  income  for  the  estate  workers.  The  social \ncomponent  of  the  Project  will  also  give  rise  to  nonquantifiable \nbenefits to the estate workers in the form of improved physical \nwell-being, self-esteem and social image, and reduced alcoholism \nand  indebtedness.  The  social  awareness  programs  will  reduce \nconflicts between management and workers, and empower the \nestate population to improve their lives by moving away from the \ncaptive labor model of the past and integrating into the mainstream \nsociety.  The  Project  will  also  have  positive  impacts  on  the \nenvironment through heightened awareness of the role of land \ncapability  and  productivity,  and  sound  forest  management  to \naddress  and  reduce  the  serious  problem  of  soil  erosion  and \ndegradation  and  to  protect  the  watersheds.  Installing  and \nrehabilitating pollution control structures in existing and new rubber \nfactories will improve the water quality of rivers and streams in the \nproject area. \n   \n ", " vi \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The main risk lies in the uncertainties of world market prices for tea \nand rubber, which will affect the profitability of the sector. Lack of \nRPC commitment and cooperation of the workers' unions for social \nchanges also constitute a risk. The Project assumes that RPCs are \nable  to  make  strategic  business  decisions  to  improve  their \nprofitability  and  adopt  innovative  technology  to  improve \nproductivity.    It  assumes  political  stability,  and  appropriate  and \nconsistent policies for the sector. It also assumes Government \ncommitment to reforms toward deregulation. \n ", "", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Plantation Development Project.1  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The tree crop (tea, rubber, and coconuts) sector contributes 15.6% of agriculture gross \ndomestic product (GDP) and 3% of total GDP. About 40% of the tea and rubber land is in the \nhands  of  the  regional  plantation  companies  (RPCs),  with  the  balance  in  the  hands  of \nsmallholders,2 whereas only about 2% of coconut land is in the hands of RPCs. The plantation \nsector accounts for 19% of foreign earnings and employs 265,000 workers.  \n \n3.  The plantation sector has underperformed since nationalization in the 1970s when 500 \ntea  and  rubber  estates  and  400  factories  were  put  under  the  management  of  two  state \nplantation  corporations:  Janatha  Estate  Development  Board  (JEDB)  and  Sri  Lanka  State \nPlantation Corporation (SLSPC). Underperformance is reflected in low productivity relative to \nthat in other countries. The current yields for tea (1,500 kilograms/hectare [kg/ha]) and rubber \n(900 kg/ha) are far below those of other producing countries such as India (1,700 kg/ha) and \nKenya (2,200 kg/ha) for tea, and Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand (1,400 kg/ha) for rubber.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n4.  The  poor  performance  of  the  sector  is  attributed  to  restrictive  regulations  and \ninappropriate  fiscal  policies  that  have  eroded  the  competitive  advantage.3  The  project \nframework is in Appendix 1.  The lessons learned from past projects (Appendix 2) show that \nproviding investment costs is not enough. Policy issues must also be addressed. In supporting \nthe state corporations, past projects had prolonged state ownership, promoted inefficiency, and \ncontributed to the sector\u2019s decline. As a result, the two state plantation corporations incurred \nhuge losses and were a drain on the state coffers.  \n \n5.  Restructuring took place in 1992 when 450 estates were formed into 22 RPCs4 and their \nmanagement contracted out to private management companies. In addition, export duties were \neliminated  and  the  cess  reduced  under  the  Second  Agriculture  Program5  to  improve  the \ncompetitiveness of the sector. Further reforms were undertaken with the support of the ongoing \nPlantation Reform Project6 (ongoing project) whose main policy agenda is to divest of the 23 \nRPCs. Other reforms included liberalization of direct tea exports, restructuring of JEDB and \nSLSPC, and reconstitution of the boards of Tea Research Institute (TRI), Sri Lanka Tea Board \n(SLTB), National Institute of Plantation Management (NIPM), Tea Smallholdings Development \n                                                 \n1  The project preparatory technical assistance was approved in December 2000. \n2  Smallholdings are defined as holdings up to 20 hectares in accordance with the Land Reform Acts of 1972 and \n1975. The estates that were nationalized and later clustered into regional plantation companies (RPCs) now make \nup the plantation sector. \n3  Asian Development Bank. 1996.

To date 20 RPCs have been divested of while an invitation to bid has \nbeen put up for one (Elkaduwa Plantation Ltd.), and two (Chilaw and Kurunegala Plantations \nLtd.) remain in private management and will be divested of in 2003. The ceiling on direct exports \nof bulk tea by producers was raised to 50% of production and further liberalization will be carried \nout in line with the policy of deregulation. The boards of TRI, SLTB, NIPM, and TSHDA were \nreconstituted and amendments to the respective acts drafted and submitted to Parliament. With \nthe dissolution of Parliament in October 2000 and the change in government, however, the bills \nneed to be resubmitted and Cabinet approval has been obtained for this. A decision has been \ntaken to divest of the estates and warehouses of JEDB/SLSPC.  \n \n6.  With divestment and assistance under the ongoing project, the RPCs' tea yields have \nincreased 3% while rubber yield has stabilized at about 900 kg/ha. The sector\u2019s profitability has \nimproved significantly: RPCs\u2019 collective losses of SLRs1.7 billion in 1993 turned into collective \nprofits of SLRS1.6 billion in 2000, thus relieving the State Treasury from supporting the sector. \nThe housing improvement program of the ongoing project has benefited an estimated 25% of \nworkers in terms of improved living conditions, and the training program has benefited up to \n30% of the workers. In addition, the ongoing project brought about an important change in the \nmanagement attitude toward the workers. \n \n7.  Nevertheless, the profitability of the plantation sector is low because of low productivity \nand high production cost, which are in turn due to the poor condition of the estates and \noveraged  plantings  (Appendixes  3  and  4).  The  mixed  financial  positions  of  RPCs  (seven \nfinancially  strong,  nine  moderate,  and  four  weak)  are  partly  attributable  to  the  inherent \nproperties of the estates and partly to RPCs\u2019 vulnerability to fluctuations in international prices \nbecause  they  remain  producers  of  primary  commodities.  The  limited  diversification  and \ndownstream activities stem partly from lack of technical expertise within RPCs and partly from \nthe  restrictive  regulations  on  import  of  planting  materials  and  direct  tea  exports.  Although \nproducers can directly export 50% of their bulk tea production, the regulations imposed by SLTB \neffectively enforce marketing through auction.   \n \n8.  The sector\u2019s development is also constrained by lack of long-term funds in the banking \nsector to finance long-gestation investments. Lending by some commercial banks has limits on \nexposure to the sector. Besides, some RPCs are considered no longer creditworthy because of \ntheir weak financial position. The extraction of management fees by parent companies7 and the \nescalation of lease rental payments to the Government also threaten to undermine the financial \nposition of RPCs.  The Government is presently negotiating with RPCs to cap management fees \nand revise the lease rental payments on a case-by-case basis. A looming labor shortage \ncaused by out-migration and reluctance of the youth to work on the estates also constrains the \ndevelopment of the sector. The stigma attached to estate employment is associated with poor \nliving environment, harsh working conditions, and traditional top-down management style.  \n \n9.   To  improve  profitability  and  provide  strategic  direction  for  the  tea  industry,  which \ncontributes 12.6% of the total export earnings, the ongoing project undertook a strategy study \nfor the tea sector. The study concluded that the global over supply of tea will continue to exert a \ndownward pressure on tea prices. This, coupled with increasing production cost, will render a \nsignificant proportion of Sri Lanka\u2019s tea industry unprofitable in the near future. To ensure long-\n                                                 \n7  Although the management fees are in accordance with the Government's privatization prospectus, they are high \nrelative to the level of profits. The minority shareholders of one RPC had raised the issue at an annual meeting, \ncausing the share price to decline. ", "  3\n \nterm industry competitiveness and viability, the industry needs to capture a greater share of the \nglobal tea value chain through branding and marketing of its tea. This would require drastic \nchanges in the industry, such as transforming RPCs from primary producers to agribusiness \nentities,  deregulation,  redirecting  research  to  product  development,  and  improving  product \nquality  through  an  industry-administered  quality  assurance  program.  The  Government  has \naccepted these recommendations in line with its policy of deregulation, and a private sector-led \nindustry umbrella body, Tea Association of Sri Lanka, is being registered under the Companies \nAct. The Ministry of Plantation Industries (MPI) has appointed three task forces to work on \nregulatory reforms, quality assurance, and process improvement. The task force on regulatory \nreforms has submitted its report, and the Government is considering the recommendations. The \nregulatory reforms will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. \n \n10.  The plantation sector is still in transition and this is reflected in changes in ownership \nwithin the private sector: one RPC has already changed hands twice. A tea marketing company \nthat bought into three RPCs reflects the vertical integration of production into blending, packing, \nand marketing. The changes in ownership and vertical integration are likely to continue as part \nof market-driven adjustments. In the meantime, the sector requires assistance to transform \nRPCs from primary producers into agribusiness entities so as to improve profitability and ensure \nsustainability.  Assistance  will  involve  strategic  investments  in  replanting  and  process \nimprovement to improve productivity, and diversification and downstream activities to broaden \nthe profit base. It will also entail maintaining the momentum for policy reforms for further \nderegulation  and  liberalization  to  build  an  enabling  environment  for  the  sector.  Further \nassistance is needed to put in place mechanisms to enable RPCs to build up their capital \nreserve and to ensure transparency in their operations. While the ultimate objective is to enable \nRPCs to provide employment terms comparable to those in other sectors, the immediate poor \nconditions  of  the  estate  workers  will  need  to  be  addressed.  Although  the  majority  of  the \nhouseholds have more than one income earner and the estate family's income is higher than \nthat of nonestate rural families, the standard of living in the estate sector is lower than that in \nother sectors of the economy. This is indicated by the lower literacy rates, higher school dropout \nrates, and negative savings rates. Mismanagement of household finances and alcoholism keep \nestate households in the lower strata of Sri Lankan society. \n \n11.  As  RPCs  are  collectively  the  largest  net  foreign  exchange  earner  and  employer, \nassistance to them will have an indirect poverty reduction impact; promote social harmony, \nstability, and ethnic reconciliation; and contribute to conflict prevention. Such assistance is in \nline with the Government\u2019s policy of transforming the plantations into engines for pro-poor \ngrowth and regional development. It is also in line with MPI\u2019s policy to promote downstream \nactivities and diversification to improve profitability in the sector. ADB\u2019s further involvement in \nthe sector is consistent with its strategy to support the Government\u2019s development efforts and \nreform objectives as well as promote the environment for higher and sustained growth to reduce \npoverty.  Assistance  in  transforming  the  plantation  sector  and  putting  in  place  a  policy \nenvironment for greater efficiency of the plantation sector will wrap up ADB\u2019s long involvement \nin the sector. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n12.  The goal of the Project is to ensure the plantation sector's long-term sustainability \nwithout further external assistance. The objectives are to (i) enhance the profitability of the \nplantation sector, and (ii) improve the living and working conditions of the estate workforce to a \n ", " 4 \n \nlevel comparable with that in other sectors. The project area (map) covers 15 districts where \nRPC  estates  are  located  (Badulla,  Chilaw,  Colombo,  Galle,  Gampaha,  Kalutara,  Kandy, \nKegalle, Kurunegala, Matale, Matara, Monaragala, Nuwara Eliya, Puttalam, and Ratnapura). \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n1.  Investment Component  \n \n13.  To improve the productivity of the core crops and broaden the profit base, investments \nare required in core crop activities and diversification. The ongoing project provided about $80 \nmillion8 through the banking sector to meet part of the requirements of RPCs for investments. \nThe amount has been fully utilized. MPI set up a revolving fund at Central Bank of Sri Lanka \n(CBSL) to recycle the funds for the credit line and about $3 million in subloans were provided to \nRPCs. However, the revolving fund will fall short of the credit demand from 2005 onward when \nrepayments fall due. To meet the sector\u2019s long-term financing requirements, the Project will \nprovide long-term funds in the form of a credit line to RPCs through participating financial \ninstitutions (PFIs) and equity and quasi-equity instruments in RPCs through the plantation fund \n(PF). By investing in these instruments, the PF will enable RPCs to strengthen their capital base \nand  increase  their  debt-bearing  capacity,  thus  generating  incremental  lending  from  PFIs \n(Appendix 5).  \n \n14.  The credit line and the PF will be available for (i) field development and mechanization in \ntea, rubber, and coconuts; (ii) crop and noncrop diversification including spices, coffee, forestry, \nand estate tourism; (iii) factory consolidation and process automation, effluent treatment for \nrubber and rehabilitation of minihydro stations; and (iv) marketing ventures.9 It is envisaged that \n1,750 ha tea and 3,750 ha rubber will be replanted; 2,375 ha tea will be infilled; 2,500 ha of oil \npalm, 2,400 ha other crops, and 10,000 ha forest will be planted and five marketing alliances will \nbe established.  \n \n15.  RPCs will be encouraged to undertake enterprise diversification on their own or by \nleasing their land to private firms, joint ventures, or subsidiary firms. As such, the credit line will \nbe available to divested RPCs, lessees of RPC land, joint ventures with RPCs, subsidiaries of \nRPCs, and divested JEDB/SLSPC estates. To avail of project funds, RPCs and the eligible \nRPC-related  entities  are  expected  to  submit  strategic  business  plans  showing  how  the \nenterprises, intend to enhance their profitability and how the subprojects fit into the strategic \nplans. The strategic plans will also indicate the plans and approaches for diversification. In \naddition, RPCs will sign an agreement with the Government to cap their management fee in \nreturn for a revision in the lease rental payments to the Government.  \n \n16.  For social and environmental sustainability, RPCs will be encouraged to consider in their \ncore crop and diversification activities various options that will optimize labor opportunities and \nland use and, at the same time, build up soil organic matter and improve soil fertility. RPCs will \nbe assisted in developing and adopting sound forest management plans to optimize land use \nand set up clear and feasible objectives for better utilization of timber and forest products. Well-\ninformed local nongovernment organization (NGOs) and community-based organizations, such \n                                                 \n8  The ongoing project (footnote 6) has a credit line of about $40 million from ADB and Y4,076 million from the Japan \nBank of International Cooperation.  \n9  If the Project will involve planting and processing of products such as palm oil, a detailed economic, physical, \nenvironmental, and social environmental impact assessment will be carried out. The report will be submitted to the \nADB for review, and the summary environmental impact assessment as well as the report will be circulated to the \nBoard 120 days before implementation. ", "  5\n \nas youth groups, recognize the value of forest preservation and diversity sufficiently to ensure \nthat RPCs harvest the timber in an environmentally sound manner. These groups have also \nexerted  pressure  on  RPCs  to  build  effluent  treatment  plants  in  accordance  with  the \nEnvironmental Protection Licensing guidelines for existing and new rubber factories so as to \nreduce toxic contamination of groundwater, streams, rivers, and adjacent lands. With respect to \nfactories,  the  implementation  of  environmental  health  and  safety  standards  is  weak. \nImprovements will not only increase the efficiency of the processing plants but will allow them to \nqualify for international certification schemes, thereby increasing their competitiveness. \n \n2.  Social and Environment Programs  \n \na.  Workers Housing and Amenities  \n \n17.  A better living environment is the first priority for the estate workers, both the resident \nworkers housed in cramped and overcrowded line rooms and the nonresident workers deprived \nof  access  to  basic  estate  facilities.  To  meet  the  workers\u2019  aspirations  for  improved  living \nconditions and house ownership, the Project will provide housing loans to 6,000 (or 3% of \nworker families) to enable the workers to construct their own houses. The maximum loan \namount will be SLRs100,000 and the lease on the land will pass on to the workers from RPCs \nupon completion of the loan repayment. Joint ownership by husband and wife will be promoted. \nBefore beginning any construction, environmental screening will assess any significant impacts \non the environment. Before starting the housing loan schemes, the Project will assist the \nworkers  in  activating/strengthening  the  Estate  Workers  Housing  Cooperative  Societies \n(EWHCS) and other estate-level institutions, which are currently inactive or nonexisting in 80% \nof the estates. These institutions are a prerequisite to successful housing loan schemes and the \nthrust of the Project is strengthening/establishing these institutions to enable the workers to \naccess credit from sources other than the Project. EWHCS will promote workers\u2019 participation in \nimplementing housing schemes and maintaining of common amenities so as to eventually \nreduce management\u2019s role in housing activities. The programs will be conducted by RPCs, \nusing their own in-house resources, or by contracted NGOs. \n \n18.  Given the time and resource constraints in replacing the existing barracks with the \nindividual estate housing model, the Project will continue the reroofing scheme for 11,000 line \nrooms to address the immediate problem of leaking roofs. In addition, the Project will provide \n150 common site services as required at the housing compounds. The Project will also examine \ndifferent options for improving sanitation\u2014upgrading septic tanks, monitoring groundwater for \nbacterial  contamination,  and  awareness  raising.  The  selected  options  should  build  on \nexperience from similar projects and activities should be low cost.  \n \nb.  Social Development Programs \n \n19.  To  improve  the  living  conditions  of  the  estate  workers,  the  Project  will  have  a \ncomprehensive social development program comprising social awareness programs, training, \nand construction of worker welfare facilities in the residential and work areas. The programs will \nseek to improve the well-being of the workers, reduce the negative social image associated with \nplantation work, and reduce tension between the workers and management. The programs also \naim  to  empower  the  workers  by  strengthening  workers  institutions  and  offering  training  in \ntechnical and life skills to reduce ethnic tension and facilitate integration into the mainstream \nsociety. The anti-alcoholism program is aimed at reducing alcoholism, domestic violence, and \nindebtedness. Orientation on human resources and social development issues will be provided \nto estate management, human resource and health staff to sensitize them to the problems and \n ", " 6 \n \nneeds of the workers and also to improve the labor-management relationship. The Project will \nassist RPCs to replicate the quality circle model and other participatory management models to \naddress the issues of productivity, quality, workers\u2019 morale, and conflict in the workplace. The \nsocial  awareness  programs,  gender  awareness  programs  and  training  in  household  cash \nmanagement conducted by NGOs under the ongoing project will be continued and expanded \naccording to need. Allocation of funds for these programs will continue to be demand-driven. \n \n20.  To improve working conditions and the productivity of the workers, the Project will \nprovide for worker welfare facilities both in the residential and work areas. Thirty playgrounds \nand 250 social development centers within the estates will meet the training and recreational \nneeds of the estate; 300 rest rooms and sanitary facilities in the factories and in the field will \nhelp RPCs to meet the requirements for the fair trade labeling schemes; and 60,000 units of \nergonomic and protective work equipment, such as aluminum plucking baskets with nylon mesh \nbags,  cutting  devices,  and  raincoats,  will  provide  more  comfort,  improve  productivity,  and \nenhance workers\u2019 dignity. A number of tea factories have been or are in the process of being \ncertified under ISO 9002. This has led to a considerable improvement in health and hygiene \nstandards. The fair trade labeling schemes will further encourage tea factories to adhere to the \nrequired standards. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is set out in Appendix 6, \nand poverty analysis in Appendix 7. \n \nc.  Environmental Initiatives  \n \n21.  Land use and cover change are important features of development in plantations. A \nbetter understanding of land use transformations should assist in developing more appropriate \nland use systems, not only to help degraded lands but also to increase profitability. Current land \nuse and management planning on the estates are not efficient for lack of detailed land and soil \nsurveys, including the exact areas and location of fields, infrastructure, property boundaries, and \nsoil and terrain types. The Project will assist RPCs to carry out these critical surveys using a \ngeographic information system (GIS) and geographic positioning system (GPS) to clearly define \nthe resource base to allow better strategic planning in land use (such as fertilizer and pesticide \nuse, and appropriate vegetative cover) and, in the process, mitigate the deterioration and \nerosion of the soil. Subsequent surveys will cover all holdings of RPCs, estates and areas for \nsubleasing. The surveys will be conducted to standards applied by professional agencies in Sri \nLanka utilizing GPS/GIS. Land surveys will cover an area of 190,000 ha. \n \n3.  Marketing Initiatives \n \na.  Research and Development \n \n22.  In recognition of the lack of work on processing, product research, and development, the \nProject will support research for developing more efficient manufacturing machinery and product \ndevelopment research in collaboration with local engineering companies and international food \ntechnology institutes. For tea, product research will focus on developing optimum Ceylon blends \nof tea and packing specifications to cater to the changing demands of the global consumer. \nSuch research will be on an industry level, and not support individual RPCs\u2019 development and \nlaunching of their own brand. To ensure sustainability, part of the cess funds allocated for \nresearch  will  be  provided  to  the  industry  umbrella  body  to  fund  such  research  by  local \nengineering companies and international food technology institutes.  \n \n ", "  7\n \nb.  Support for Alternative Marketing Initiatives  \n \n23.  The Project will support the industry in keeping up with the times by developing and \ntesting software for automated tea auction and electronic trading. To enable the industry to \nbecome more customer focused, the Project will establish and finance a Market Intelligence and \nPromotion Center to facilitate overseas alliances and promotion of Ceylon tea. The Fairtrade \nLabeling Organization (FLO) and Oxford Committee for Famine Relief (Oxfam) already have fair \ntrade labeling schemes for tea suppliers in Sri Lanka (Appendix 8). The Project will support FLO \nand Oxfam initiatives in fair trade labeling certification in the plantation sector to meet the \nrequirements of a small, albeit growing, niche market for fair trade and sustainable tea market. \nTo meet the consumers\u2019 increasing concern over the working, living, and social conditions of \nestate workers, the Project will assist RPCs to comply with the audit terms of the Tea Sourcing \nPartnership (TSP),10 by rectifying the shortcomings in the social and welfare facilities of the \nestate workers and to obtain certification as authorized suppliers. These programs aim to assist \nin marketing as noncompliance will eventually result in the inability of RPCs to sell tea in the \nopen market. They also have a direct social effect on the workers as they will ensure that RPCs \nabide by some minimum standards with regard to workers\u2019 working and living conditions as well \nas the environment. In addition, the Project will conduct awareness programs for Government \nofficials and the public in collaboration with NGOs, to raise their awareness of pressing issues, \nsuch as the present over regulation in tea marketing, and the implications of such issues for the \nfuture of the plantation sector. Oxfam is exploring the possibility of playing an advocacy role in \nfair trade of tea. FLO, through its Regional Consultative Body in Colombo, can raise awareness \nof trade issues and conduct education programs on them and eventually play an advocacy role. \n \n  4.  Institutional Development and Project Management \n \na.  Support for Industry Umbrella Body \n \n24.  The Tea Sector Strategy Study recommended the establishment of a self-regulated \nindustry umbrella body comprising all stakeholders (smallholders, RPCs, private tea factory \nowners, brokers, and exporters) to champion the implementation of the recommendations of the \ntask forces on regulatory reform, quality assurances and process improvement. The umbrella \nbody\u2019s role is to unite the divided stakeholder groups, provide a common platform for the \nindustry to work together, and represent the private sector in formulating government policy on \nderegulation.  Its  tasks  will  include  (i)  initiating  product  development  and  research,  quality \nassurance  certification  and  consumer  and  generic  trade  promotion;  (ii)  facilitating  strategic \nalliances  and  collaboration  with  supporting  institutions  (TRI,  SLTB  and  TSHDA)  to  ensure \nalignment with industry needs; (iii) serving as the conduit for establishing the market intelligence \nand promotion center, automated tea auction and electronic trading; (iv) establishing liaisons \nwith NGOs for raising awareness on international codes of conduct and certification standards \nrelating to social, welfare, and environmental conditions; (v) initiating research and development \nfor ergonomic equipment; (vi) initiating incentive and award schemes on the industry level to \npromote  social  and  processing  standards;  and  (vii)  organizing  trade  fairs    for  information \nexchange. The registration of the umbrella body, Tea Association of Sri Lanka, under the \nCompanies Act is in process. The Project will finance the initial establishment operations of the \numbrella body, which is expected to be self-financed by subscription from the private sector as \nwell as part of the cess fund on terms and conditions to be determined by MPI by the end of the \nProject. \n \n                                                 \n10  Representing 80% of the tea trade of the United Kingdom. \n ", " 8 \n \nb.  Consulting Inputs \n \n25.  With the past isolation of the sector from development in other countries, RPCs have \nlimited  experience  in  diversification  and  marketing  activities  to  identify  diversification \nopportunities and to respond to the changing preferences of consumers. To bridge the gaps in \ntechnical  expertise,  RPCs  have  hired  consultants  at  their  own  cost  to  assist  in  their \ndiversification subprojects. The Project will not finance such consulting inputs for feasibility \nstudies and implementing individual subprojects; however, it will provide consulting inputs in \nareas where expertise is commonly lacking in all RPCs with the strong involvement of RPCs \nand  the  Planters\u2019  Association  of  Ceylon  (PA)  in  identifying,  absorbing,  and  adopting  new \ntechnology  through  on-the-job-training  of  staff.  The  expertise  and  inputs  required  will  be \ndetermined  during  project  implementation  and  will  include  strategic  planning,  marketing, \nsilviculture, forest management, process engineering, and mechanical engineering. Consulting \ninputs are envisaged for studies pertaining to the industry, e.g., a study on the social and \nenvironmental implications of expanding oil palm cultivation in Sri Lanka. RPCs will bear part of \nthe cost of these consulting inputs.  \n \nc.  Training \n \n26.  Transformation of the plantation sector will depend on the ability of RPCs to reposition \nthemselves as beverage marketers and, ultimately, agribusiness companies. Such transition is \nenvisaged  to  entail  some  reorganization  to  utilize  new  production  systems.  Training  the \nmanagement  staff  is  crucial  for  the  transition  and  will  focus  on  management  for  change, \nstrategic management, and human resource development to improve management capability to \nformulate strategies and programs with available resources and to better cope with the market \neconomy. Although NIPM conducts some courses, these courses have not been revised and no \nlonger meet the industry\u2019s needs. Other avenues such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants \nof Sri Lanka should be sought for such training. \n \n27.  Technical training for estate staff will comprise estate accounting, office automation, and \ninformation technology. Training for workers will concentrate on support for mechanization and \nfactory automation, in addition to traditional training on agricultural practices such as plucking, \npruning, and tapping. The training courses will be conducted by NIPM, other public or private \ntraining organizations, or RPCs. The Project will train some estate staff as trainers to deliver \nsocial and gender awareness programs to develop RPCs' in-house training capability so as to \neventually take over from NGOs. To ensure the sustainability and efficiency of the rehabilitated \nor installed pollution control structures for the rubber factories and processing plants, the Project \nwill provide operation and maintenance training to identified staff. \n \nd.  Support for Developing Subleasing and Outgrower Models \n \n28.  In recognition of the looming labor shortage, some RPCs recognize that satisfactory \narrangements will eventually have to be developed to transform the workers to outgrowers (or \ncontract growers). RPCs\u2019 operations will then be limited to factory operation and provision of \nextension services to outgrowers. In this regard, some RPCs have allocated blocks of land to \nthe workers for maintenance and plucking/tapping to develop a sense of ownership, as a \nprerequisite to subleasing blocks of land to the workers. As land is a sensitive issue, such \nsubleasing  can  only  be  piloted  after  an  in-depth  study  of  the  legal,  social,  and  ethnic \nimplications. The Project will support the study and implementing of the pilot schemes.  \n ", "  9\n \ne.  Project Management \n \n29.  The  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  of  the  ongoing  project  will  continue  to  be \nresponsible for implementing and monitoring the Project, and coordinating social programs, and \ntraining. In line with the focus on strategic business planning, the PIU will be strengthened with \nthe recruitment of a management finance specialist to develop a comprehensive management \ninformation system and assist in preparing of strategic business plans. The Project will finance \nthe vehicles, equipment, and recurrent cost of the PIU. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n30.  Apart from meeting the investment needs of RPCs, the Project seeks to bring about \ntransformation in the plantation sector. To do so, the Project has adopted the direction of the \nfuture development set out in the Tea Sector Strategy Study. In implementing the action plan, \nthe Project has incorporated mechanisms for dialogue with the Government and consensus \nbuilding among the stakeholders through the industry umbrella body that provides the platform \nfor the industry to work together. This is essential as senior officials are still more attuned to \nbeing regulators rather than facilitators, and the stakeholders, including workers and members \nof the tea trade, have different interests.  \n \n31.  A special feature of the Project is the setting up of the PF to complement the traditional \ncollateral  based-banking  system,  promote  financial  discipline  and  strengthen  RPCs'  capital \nbase. The PF will use different equity and quasi-equity instruments depending on the associated \nrisks, such as preference shares with attractive dividends or convertible debt instruments that \ngive the right to convert debt into equity at the discretion of the fund manager. The convertible \ninstruments have special application for high-risk RPCs as such instruments impose financial \ndiscipline. The tenure of the investments may be medium to long term, depending on the \nprevailing  market  conditions,  and  the  fund  manager  may  employ  hedging  techniques  to \nminimize the default risk. As the PF\u2019s investments in RPCs will be based on their strategic \nplans, RPCs will be encouraged to do long-term planning, which will ultimately increase their \nprofitability and maximize shareholder value.  \n \n32.  Another special feature of the Project is the support for RPCs in fair trade labeling and in \nmeeting the requirements of ethical trade initiatives. Fair trade and ethical trade are relatively \nnew concepts and are sustainable alternatives to conventional international trade to provide \nstakeholders along the value chain with their fair share of margin. Supporting RPCs in the \nsustainable  tea  market  will  provide  them  with  an  alternative  in  marketing.  In  addition,  the \nrequirements of fair trade and ethical trade initiatives will lead to improvements in the social \nwelfare conditions of the workers, the relationships among the stakeholders of the industry, and \nthe environmental practices of the estates. The Project seeks to apply the concept of fair and \nethical trade to RPCs, which are charged with responsibility for the workers\u2019 welfare but are not \ntreated equitably as a trading partner because of regulations that favor marketing through the \nauction and restrict their marketing efforts.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n33.  The total project cost, inclusive of taxes and duties and physical and price contingencies, \nis $114.4 million equivalent, comprising $34.4 million (30%) in foreign exchange and $80.0 \nmillion (70%) in local currency equivalent.

Financing Plan \n \n34.  The Government has requested a loan of Y1,171,600,00011 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources (OCR) for relending and onlending through the apex body to PFIs and investment by \nthe PF for the investment component. The loan will have a 20-year term including a grace \nperiod of 5 years on account of the long gestation period of plantation crops, which have an \nimmaturity period of at least 3 years and reach peak production a few years after. The loan will \nhave an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0% (the fee will be capitalized in \nthe  loan),  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that the choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice of ADB. \n \n35.  A loan of $20 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will be provided for \nthe workers\u2019 housing loan scheme and social and other components. The loan will have a \nmaturity period of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The Borrower will relend $3.9 \nmillion equivalent through the apex body to the PFIs for onlending to estate workers under the \nworkers\u2019 housing loan scheme. The Borrower will allocate $15.3 million equivalent through \nbudgetary appropriation through MPI for RPCs and the umbrella body to carry out the social and \n                                                 \n11  Equivalent to $10 million, at the exchange rate of Y117.16=$1 as of 25 July 2002. \n ", "  11\n \nenvironmental programs, marketing initiatives, and institutional development on a grant basis. \nThe Borrower will allocate $0.8 million equivalent in budgetary appropriation to MPI for project \nmanagement. \n \n36.  The financing plan is given in Table 2.  ADB will finance 26% of the project cost. The \nbalance  of  $84.4  million  equivalent  will  be  financed  by  the  beneficiaries,  PFIs,  and  the \nGovernment. The beneficiaries are expected to contribute 34% of the total project cost in the \nform of equity contribution (20-40% for investment subprojects, 30% for workers\u2019 housing loans, \n50% for social infrastructure and training). PFIs are expected to contribute 7% of the total \nproject cost to cover at least 10% of each subproject under the credit line and the workers\u2019 \nhousing loans. The Government will make budgetary allocations equivalent to 1% of the total \nproject cost for support of the industry umbrella body and project management. In addition, the \nGovernment will make available the resources of the revolving fund established under the \nongoing project, equivalent to 32% of project cost, through the PFIs and PF for onlending and \ninvestments in equity and quasi-equity instruments. ADB is justified in financing of the local \ncurrency  cost  because  of  social  benefits  accruing  from  the  Project  and  its  positive \nenvironmental impact.  \n \nTable 2:  Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total   % \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nADB - OCR Loan  5.6  4.4  10.0  9 \nADB - ADF Loan  7.6  12.4  20.0  17 \nParticipating Financial Institutions  -  8.5  8.5  7 \nBeneficiaries  -  38.3  38.3  34 \nGovernment  21.2  16.4  37.6  33 \n         \n        Total  34.4  80.0  114.4  100 \nADB=Asian Development Bank, ADF=Asian Development Fund, OCR=ordinary capital resources. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management and Implementation \n \n37.  MPI  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  overall  supervision,  management,  and \nimplementation of the Project, including reporting, monitoring, and evaluation. For the sake of \ncontinuity and in view of its satisfactory performance, the PIU of the ongoing project will be \nappropriately strengthened to implement the proposed Project. The PIU will (i) assist the eligible \nsubborrowers in preparing their strategic business plans in accordance with the requirements of \nPFIs and the PF; (ii) assist in identifying and procuring technical and advisory services; (iii) \nchannel  project  funds  to  RPCs  and  concerned  agencies  for  the  social,  marketing,  and \ninstitutional aspects; (iv) inspect, monitor, and evaluate project activities and impact, including \nsocial and environmental measures required to be undertaken by the subborrowers; (v) conduct \nsocioeconomic  surveys  to  determine  the  baseline  and  impact  of  the  Project;  (vi)  submit \nwithdrawal applications to ADB for the noncredit components; and (vii) compile and prepare \nquarterly progress reports on overall project implementation and the project completion report. A \nmanagement  finance  specialist  will  be  recruited  to  strengthen  the  PIU  for  reviewing  and \nassisting in preparing strategic business plans. The PIU will have the required authority for \nproject implementation. \n ", " 12 \n \n38.  The  Plantation  Housing  and  Social  Welfare  Trust  (PHSWT)  will  assist  the  PIU  in \nimplementing the workers\u2019 housing loan scheme, common amenities for workers, and training \nfor the social programs. The Project will contract NGOs for the social programs, fair trade \nlabeling and strengthening of the EWHCS because of their local knowledge and experience in \nparticipatory  delivery  mechanisms  in  demand-driven  project  interventions.  The  Planters' \nAssociation of Ceylon (PA), as representatives of RPCs, will assume greater responsibilities in \nproject implementation, including identifying the gaps in technological expertise in the industry \nas well as selecting and recruiting consultants and NGOs in consultation with the PIU and in \naccordance with ADB's procedures. \n \n39.  The DFCC Bank will be the apex body for the credit line and for the workers\u2019 housing \nloan scheme. The apex body will be responsible for (i) preparing subsidiary loan agreements to \nbe entered into with the PFIs on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB, (ii) designating \nfinancial institutions for participation in the Project, (iii) preparing operating guidelines for PFIs, \n(iv) coordinating and supervising the subloan operations of PFIs, (v) channeling funds to PFIs \nand making arrangements to receive repayments, (vi) submitting withdrawal applications to \nADB, (vii) providing input for strengthening EWHCS under the workers\u2019 housing loan scheme, \n(viii) facilitating subloan approval and disbursement, (ix) operating a monitoring and evaluation \nsystem, (x) maintaining records on withdrawal application, disbursements, and project accounts, \n(xi) monitoring PFI performance, and (xii) preparing and submitting quarterly reports to the PIU \nfor submission to ADB. \n \n40.  Two groups of PFIs will implement the two credit lines based on their experience in the \nrespective  areas.  The  licensed  commercial  and  specialized  banks  will  be  responsible  for \nonlending for the investment component. PFIs with experience in housing loans using their own \nresources will be responsible for the workers\u2019 housing loan scheme. PFIs will be responsible for \n(i) approving and disbursing of subloans, (ii) monitoring the performance of subborrowers, (iii) \nsubmitting their refinancing claims to the apex body for submission to ADB, (iv) maintaining \nrecords on subborrowers and project accounts, and (v) submitting quarterly reports to the apex \nbody.  \n \n41.  The PF will invest in eligible RPCs using equity and quasi-equity instruments. In doing \nso, it will provide RPCs with long-term funds for investment and, at the same time, help build up \nthe RPCs\u2019 capital base. \n  \n42.  A  project  coordination  committee  (PCC),  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  MPI,  will  be \nestablished within 3 months of loan effectiveness with representatives from the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF), External Resources Department (ERD), CBSL, apex body, PFIs, PIU, and PA. \nThe PCC will be responsible for interagency coordination and give the PIU guidance in policy \nissues for implementing the Project.  \n \n2.  Financing Arrangements \n \na.  Relending and Onlending Terms  \n \n43.  The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk of the loans. Fifty percent of the \nOCR loan (Y585,800,00) with the resources of the revolving fund from June 2003 to December \n2008 (about $33 million) will be relent through the apex body to PFIs at the average weighted \ndeposit rate (AWDR) under subsidiary loan agreements with terms and conditions acceptable to \nADB. The relending rate will be reviewed from time to time to minimize the subsidy element. \nPFIs will onlend the funds to eligible subborrowers on a first-come first serve basis, at AWDR ", "  13\n \nplus a maximum spread of 5%. The maturity period of subloans will vary according to the \ngestation period of the subproject. It will range from 10 years for marketing, processing, and \nengineering  to  15  years  for  crop  development  and  diversification  and  20  years  for  forest \nplantations. The maximum subloan size will be the equivalent of $2 million. \n \n44.  The balance of the OCR loan (Y585,800,00) and the resources of the revolving fund as \nof 1 January 2003 (about $8 million) will be used to establish the PF. These funds will be relent \nto the PF under a subsidiary loan agreement at AWDR with terms and conditions acceptable to \nADB upon its establishment. The resources of the PF will be used to invest in RPCs through \nequity participation or debt instruments issued by the RPCs up to 10% of the PF\u2019s capital or \n20%  of  an  RPC\u2019s  paid-up  capital,  whichever  is  lower.  Although  the  economic  life  of  the \nsubprojects ranges from 10 to 20 years, the PF will have an exit mechanism through the \nsecondary market operations.  \n \n45.  The portion of the Special Funds loan to be used for the workers\u2019 housing loan scheme \nwill be made available through the apex body to the PFIs under subsidiary loan agreements at \nAWDR for 15 years, with terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. PFIs will onlend to the \nworkers on a first-come first serve basis at a rate not more than AWDR+5% for a period of 15 \nyears. The maximum subloan size is SLRs100,000. The agreement between RPCs, PHSWT, \nand JEDB/SLSPC to transfer the land lease from RPCs to the workers upon completion of \nsubloan repayment will be included in the subloan agreement. \n \nb.  Eligibility of PFIs \n \n46.  For the investment component, the apex body will designate PFIs that meet the following \ncriteria: (i) be a licensed commercial or specialized bank; (ii) have audit reports without material \nqualification by auditors for each of the past 5 years; (iii) have an annual collection ratio \nexceeding 80% of total portfolio; (iv) comply with CBSL guidelines and Basle guidelines on \nfinancial  soundness  including  capital  adequacy,  return  on  average  assets,  debt  service \ncoverage  ratio,  and  long-term  debt-equity  ratio;  (v)  have  the  organizational  setup  and \nprocedures to carry out environmental due diligence; (vi) agree to provide quarterly information \non  project  implementation  in  a  standardized  format;  and  (vii)  assign  a  senior  staff  for \ncoordination and overall monitoring of subloan operations. The DFCC Bank as the apex body, \nNational Development Bank, Bank of Ceylon, Commercial Bank of Ceylon, Hatton National \nBank,  Sampath  Bank,  Seylan  Bank,  and  other  financial  institutions  will  be  considered  for \nparticipation. \n \n47.  The apex body will designate PFIs for the workers\u2019 housing scheme according to the \nfollowing  criteria:  (i)  be  formally  incorporated  under  the  Companies  Act  or  specific  Act  of \nParliament; (ii) have audit reports without material qualification by auditors for each of the past 5 \nyears; (iii) comply with CBSL guidelines and Basle guidelines on financial soundness in terms of \ncapital  adequacy,  liquidity,  etc.;  (iv)  agree  to  provide  quarterly  information  on  project \nimplementation in a standardized format; (v) assign a senior staff for coordination and overall \nmonitoring of subloan operations; (vi) undertake that loan collection ratios show an improvement \neach year after receiving the refinance facility; (vii) be formally approved by CBSL; and (viii) \nhave the organizational setup and procedures to carry out environmental due diligence. The \nHousing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), and State Mortgage and Investment Bank \n(SMIB) already have housing loan schemes for estate workers and are likely to participate in \nthis Project.   \n \n \n ", " 14 \n \nc.  Subborrower and Subproject Eligibility Criteria \n \n48.  The potential subborrowers for the investment component will comprise the divested \nRPCs and their subsidiaries, joint ventures with divested RPCs, lessees of land from RPCs and \ndivested JEDB/SLSPC estates. PFIs will decide on the eligibility of the subborrowers based on \nthe latter's financial position and debt-bearing capacity. All subborrowers will submit strategic \nbusiness plans that indicate how the investments will enhance the future profitability of the \ncompany.  The  eligible  RPCs  must  (i)  sign  agreement  with  the  Government  to  cap  their \nmanagement fees and revise the lease payment; and (ii) agree to develop a human resource \ndevelopment plan and recruit a qualified human resource development officer and a social \nmobilizer for each cluster of estates.  \n \n49.  The eligible subprojects should be within the scope of the investment component and \nhave a rate of return greater than the onlending rate. In addition, specific subprojects must meet \nthe following criteria: (i) all activities will take place on RPC lands; (ii) areas for diversification \nand commercial forestry should be demarcated in a land-use plan/forestry management plan; \n(iii) factories for rationalization should have a capacity of not less than 1 million kg made tea per \nannum and for each factory to be rationalized, two factories of the same RPC in the vicinity \nshould be closed; (iv) a mini hydroelectric plant for rehabilitation should primarily serve the RPC \nestate and estate workers. The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) should certify the plant's \ncompliance with environmental requirements; (v) joint marketing alliances should involve at \nleast two RPCs, which will collectively contribute to at least 60% of the total equity of at least \nSLRs200 million over the first 2 years. A single RPC-marketer must invest at least SLRs75 \nmillion equity over the first 2 years and venture to own brands in the international market; and \n(vi) the subprojects must be carried out in accordance with the existing environmental laws and \nregulations of Sri Lanka and ADB\u2019s guidelines, the Environmental Assessment Requirements of \nADB, monitoring and mitigation measures indicated in the environmental management plans \nand the environmental criteria drawn up. \n    \n50.  The subborrowers for the workers housing loan scheme will (i) be registered employees \nof RPCs, (ii) be selected through a participatory procedure by EWHCS or other existing workers\u2019 \nsocieties  and  committees,  and  (iii)  have  participated  in  the  household  cash  management \ntraining and other social programs. Each subborrower\u2019s housing unit should be part of an estate \nhousing project with a minimum of 25 units and within an RPC's settlement development plan. \n \nd.  Plantation Fund \n \n51.  Subject to feasibility, the PF will be established 6 months after loan effectiveness\u2014with \nADB concurrence and, under the purview of MOF\u2014as a trust under the Trust Ordinance for an \ninitial period of 10 years to invest in eligible RPCs. The trustees, comprising two from the \nbanking sector, three from RPCs (on a 2-year rotation basis), one from PA, one from MOF, and \none from MPI, will sign the trust deed and be responsible for protecting the interest of the PF. \nThe PF will commence operation with total funds of $13 million from the revolving fund and the \nOCR loan. If and when necessary, more resources may be transferred from the revolving fund \nto the PF. The PF will be managed by a fund manager appointed by the trustees with ADB \nconcurrence. The criteria for selecting the fund manger will include (i) alliance of an international \nfund  management  company  and  a  local  financial  services  management  company  with  a \nminimum of $150 million under management, (ii) audit reports without major qualifications for \nthe past 3 years, and (iii) details of experience in the region and capability to transfer expertise \nand knowledge. The incentive plan for the fund manager is subject to negotiation and will \ninclude a management fee on the market value of the equity portfolio plus additional incentives ", "  15\n \nbased on dividend income earned by the PF and if the portfolio outperforms the plantation \nindex. The fund manager\u2019s performance will be reviewed every 2 years. \n \n52.  The PF will use a wide range of products to suit the needs of RPCs and to meet its \ninvestment criteria.  These will include direct equity to strengthen the capital base of RPCs, \npreference shares with attractive dividends, and convertible debt instruments that give options \nfor converting debt into equity. The PF\u2019s resources will be used for eligible subprojects within \nthe scope of the investment component and will have a rate of return greater than the onlending \nrate. The beneficiaries of the PF include all divested RPCs and joint ventures with such RPCs. \nThe eligibility criteria will vary according to the instrument used and the strategy of the PF, e.g., \nless stringent criteria can be used for convertible debt instruments whereby the PF can effect a \nchange in the equity structure. The criteria include (i) no major audit qualifications for financial \nstatements for the past 5 years, (ii) satisfactory current valuation on net assets, (iii) projected \nimprovements in future profitability and cash flow, (iv) clear strategic plans for improving future \nprofitability, and (v) policy on management fees dividend. As all privatized RPCs will eventually \nbe listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange, the PF will eventually require listing of the financial \ninstruments as a primary condition for investment. Although the tenure of the investments may \nbe up to 20 years, the PF can exit through the secondary market operations after achieving its \nobjectives of improving the overall financial health of the RPCs and instilling financial discipline.  \n \ne.  Revolving Fund \n \n53.  The ongoing project has established a revolving fund to credit the subloan repayments \nfor further relending and onlending. About SLRs300 million have been used for this purpose to \ndate. The resources of the revolving fund as of 1 January 2003 (about $8 million) will be \ntransferred to the PF upon its establishment and upon revision of the agreement between MPI \nand CBSL to enable the resources of the revolving fund to be used for the PF. Thereafter, the \nresources of the revolving fund that are not utilized for loan amortization of the ongoing project \nwill be used for relending and onlending on the same terms as for the OCR loan.  \n \n3.  Project Implementation Schedule \n \n54.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years: 2003-2008. The investment component \nwill start in the first year and subloan applications and equity financing will be made within the \nfirst 5 years. The other components will start in the first year except for the workers' housing \nloan scheme, which will start in the second year after the EWHCS have been strengthened and \npotential beneficiaries have been trained in household cash management (Appendix 10). \n \n4.  Procurement \n \n55.  The subborrowers will procure all goods, works, and services for the subprojects in the \ninvestment component and workers\u2019 housing loan scheme. PFIs will ensure that procurement \nprices are reasonable and the procedures are appropriate and consistent with established \ncommercial practices. All other goods and services will be procurred in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. International competitive bidding will be used for a supply contract \nfor  equipment  and  vehicles  estimated  at  $500,000  equivalent  or  more,  and  international \nshopping will be used for contracts below $500,000 equivalent. Activities including civil works \nunder the other components may be carried out by RPCs on force account basis because the \nworks are small and scattered, and are unlikely to attract international contractors. Any civil \nworks not carried out by the RPCs concerned may be awarded by those RPCs to contractors on \n ", " 16 \n \nthe  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding,  in  accordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to  the \nGovernment and ADB.  \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n56.  An estimated 23 person-months of international and 24 person-months of domestic \nconsulting inputs will supply expertise that is lacking in all RPCs: enterprise diversification, \nmarketing, strategic business planning, silviculture, forest management, process engineering, \nand mechanical engineering. The PIU, in collaboration with RPCs and PA, will determine the \ntype  of  expertise  and  the  scope  of  consulting  inputs  during  project  implementation.  The \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The PA, as \nrepresentative of RPCs, will undertake the recruitment in consultation with the PIU and in \naccordance with ADB procedures. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n57.  Three  imprest  accounts  will  be  opened  in  CBSL.  The  imprest  accounts  for  the \ninvestment component and the workers\u2019 housing loan scheme will be managed by the apex \nbody. The imprest account for the other components will be managed by the PIU. For the \ninvestment component, 50% of the OCR loan will be used to establish the PF and the balance \nchanneled through the apex body to PFIs for the credit line. The apex body will be responsible \nfor  appropriately  completing  and  submitting  all  withdrawal  applications  to  ADB  for  the \ninvestment component and the workers\u2019 housing loan scheme. The PIU will do the same for the \nother  components.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and \nliquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements \nagreed upon by ADB and the Government. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest \naccounts will not exceed $1 million for the investment component, $200,000 for the workers\u2019 \nhousing loan scheme, and $500,000 or 3 months\u2019 expenditure, whichever is lower, for the other \ncomponents. The statement of expenditure procedures (SOE) may be used for reimbursing \neligible expenditures for contracts not exceeding $50,000 and for liquidating advances from the \nimprest  account  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  detailed \narrangements agreed upon by ADB and the Government. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n58.  The  PIU,  apex  body,  PFIs,  and  PF  will  maintain  separate  accounts  and  financial \nstatements for the Project and will have these audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. \nThe annual audit will cover the imprest accounts and the SOE and the report will include a \nseparate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  accounts.  The  audited  accounts  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB within 9 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate.  \n \n59.  The PIU will coordinate and compile reports from the apex body, PFIs, and PF to \nprepare  quarterly  reports  on  overall  project  implementation,  subloan  disbursement  and \nrecovery, and recommendations for improvement. The quarterly reports will be presented to the \nPCC and ERD before submission to ADB. Within 3 months of physical project completion, the \nPIU will submit a project completion report that will review loan utilization and its impact on the \nbeneficiaries. \n \n ", "  17\n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n60.  Benefit monitoring and evaluation will be carried out, keeping in the mind the project \nobjectives  of  enhancing  the  plantation  sector\u2019s  profitability  and  sustainability  as  well  as \nimproving the workers\u2019 living and working conditions. The emphasis will be on impact monitoring \nrather than just activity monitoring. As far as possible, self-monitoring by RPCs, apex body, \nPFIs, PF, workers, and other relevant agencies will be allowed, with periodic confirmatory audit \nand submission of quarterly reports to the PIU. The reports should be in line with the pertinent \nrecords for RPCs\u2019 strategic management programs so as to reduce the administrative burden.  \n \n61.  The Project\u2019s overall performance in enhancing the sustainability of the subsector will be \nindicated by sustained business operations and sound financial positions of RPCs. The ability of \nRPCs to list their equity and debt instruments is an indicator of the performance of the PF. \nIndicators of improvements in the workers\u2019 conditions include reducted outflow of estate labor, \nimproved income, reduced incidence of sickness, higher child weight, and improved status of \nestate employment. In addition to these overall indicators, each component will be monitored \nand evaluated based on the impact on the workers and the environment. The success of the \ninvestment component will be measured by its ability to generate more gainful employment and \nhigher income for the workers although the impact will differ between male and female workers. \nAn increasing number of RPCs and estates registering for fair trade labeling and ISO standards \nwill indicate a rising number of estates that comply with the minimum standards for fair trade \nand hence improved living and working conditions for the workers. Other indicators of the \nworkers\u2019  conditions  will  be  disbursement  of  housing  loans,  factory  and  field  rest  rooms \nconstructed, use of ergonomic equipment, and levels of indebtedness and alcoholism. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n62.  In the third year, ADB, MPI, PIU, and the apex body will carry out a comprehensive \nmidterm review of all aspects of the Project: implementation progress, appropriateness of the \nproject design, and the implementation arrangements. The review will focus on the policy \nreforms to assess the relevance and impact of these reforms. Necessary adjustments in project \nscope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements  will  be  made  based  on  the  findings.  In \naddition, an environmental audit will review the progress of self-assessment of compliance with \nstandards, benefits from additional market access, and applications of the information gathered. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \n63.  Quantifiable benefits accrue from the subprojects of the investment component. At peak \nproduction, the Project will yield an incremental production of approximately 5,000 tons of tea \nand 7,900 tons of rubber valued at $7 million and $1.5 million respectively. Crop diversification \nactivities, such as oil palm, pepper, and coffee, are expected to yield an export value of $2.8 \nmillion per annum. Successful operation of the marketing alliances will yield an incremental \nannual income of $10 million. Other quantifiable benefits are reduced production cost from \nfactory rationalization and automation, and savings in energy costs from rehabilitated mini-\nhydropower stations. The opportunities for value addition, direct sales, enhanced buyer-friendly \nprocesses, and improved logistics emanating from the marketing initiatives will give rise to \nhigher profit margins and more stable revenues for RPCs. The financial and economic analyses \nof the potential subprojects show that they have financial internal rate of returns (FIRRs) and \neconomic internal rate of returns (EIRR) above the real onlending rate and opportunity cost of \ncapital (Appendix 11). The RPCs\u2019 scheduled investment programs indicate an overall project \nFIRR of 14% and EIRR of 16%. Analysis of two sample RPCs indicates that the Project will \n ", " 18 \n \nimprove their cash flows and long-term profitability, and that the impact is greater on the RPC \nthat is financially weaker. The nonquantifiable benefits of the investment component include \nincreased ability of RPCs to pay higher wages and provide better working and living conditions \nfor the workers. This will make estate employment attractive to the youth, and thus contribute to \nthe reduction in urban drift and rural unemployment.  \n \n64.  The social component has many nonquantifiable benefits. Overall, it will strengthen the \ncapacity of the estate population to improve their lives and to integrate into the mainstream of \nsociety. It will also enable both the workers and RPCs to move away from the captive labor \nmodel of the past toward a more modern management system. The self-help housing loan \nscheme will improve the physical well-being of the workers, raise their self-esteem and the \nsocial image of plantation employment, leading to reduced voluntary unemployment and out-\nmigration. House ownership and its related responsibility will provide the beneficiaries with \nmotivation for optimizing the use of funds. The improved line rooms will have a great impact on \nwomen who have to bear the effects of inferior living conditions because they are responsible \nfor all domestic work and have to deal with the consequence of poor living conditions, including \nillness in the family. Strengthening EWHCS and other estate-level institutions will empower the \nworkers, especially women. \n \n65.  The social awareness programs aim to increase gender awareness and reduce the \nincidence  of  alcoholism  and  worker-management  conflicts.  The  anti-alcohol  programs  will \nreduce domestic violence and indebtedness in the short term. In the long term, they will improve \nlabor outturn and workers\u2019 productivity, indirectly reduce the school dropout rate. The household \ncash management training will help reduce the incidence of indebtedness and raise the workers\u2019 \ndisposable  income  and  savings,  thus  reducing  their  vulnerability.  Playgrounds  and  social \ndevelopment centers within the estates will provide a better sociocultural environment, and \nsports activities will assist in integrating workers from different ethnic groups and castes, in \naddition to reducing boredom and alcohol abuse. The use of ergonomic and protective work \nequipment and provision of facilities in the residential and work areas will increase the workers' \nproductivity and enhance their well-being. Replicating the five S and quality circles system will \nbring about greater job satisfaction for workers and reduced conflict with the management, \nresulting in better labor utilization and increased productivity. In view of the different ethnic origin \nof  management  and  workers,  an  orientation  program  for  the  management  to  increase \nunderstanding of the quality circle and participatory management systems will improve industrial \nrelations and social integration of the excluded Tamil communities. \n \n66.  The Project will have positive impacts on the environment (Appendix 12). The land-use \nsurveys will heighten people's awareness of the role of land capability and productivity. This, \ncoupled with sound forest management, will address and reduce the serious problem of soil \nerosion and degradation as well as protect the watersheds. Installing and rehabilitating of \npollution control structures, and training in their operation and maintenance in existing and new \nrubber factories will improve the water quality of rivers and streams in the project area. \n \n67.  RPCs, as commodity producers, are faced with the risk of price fluctuations in the \ninternational market. This risk is compounded by RPCs\u2019 inability to make strategic investments \nto realize improvements in profitability and financial position. This risk is mitigated to a great \nextent with training in strategic planning and the requirement of strategic business plans when \nsubmitting subloan applications to PFIs. There is a risk that the social development programs \nmay not yield the envisaged benefits because of lack of commitment by RPCs and lack of \ncooperation from the workers unions. Continuous consultation with RPCs and workers as well \nas incorporation of worker participatory procedures will mitigate the risk. Lack of Government ", "  19\n \ncommitment to the reforms and the industry umbrella body will nullify the efforts to liberalize tea \nmarketing and get all stakeholders\u2019 commitment to transform the plantation sector. To mitigate \nthis risk, the Project provides for continuous policy dialogue. \n   \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n68.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The  PIU  of  the  ongoing  project  will  be  maintained  and  be  responsible  for \nimplementing the proposed Project to ensure continuity. \n(ii)  The Government will divest itself of Elkaduwa Plantation Ltd. through the stock \nmarket  by  December  2002  and  of  Chilaw  Plantation  Ltd.  and  Kurunegala \nPlantation Ltd. by June 2003. \n(iii)  The Government will divest itself of the estates and warehouses of JEDB/SLSPC \nby December 2003. \n(iv)  The Government will eliminate all restrictions on tea exports on recommendation \nof the industry umbrella body, and eliminate price control and panel ratification \nfor non-auction sales between producers and international buyers by June 2003.  \n(v)  The Government will amend the acts of the TRI, SLTB, TSHDA, and NIPM; \nreconstitute the boards for greater private sector participation; and restructure the \ninstitutions.  \n(vi)  The bill on reconstitution of the boards of CRI and RRI will be submitted to \nParliament for approval within 6 months of loan effectiveness. \n(vii)  The  Government  will  refrain  from  intervening  in  wage  determination  in  the \ncollective agreements between workers and management. \n(viii)  The Government will phase out the role of the Plantation Management and \nMonitoring Division in monitoring the management and financial performance of \nRPCs when all RPCs are divested. \n(ix)  Subject to the outcome of the feasibility study, the Government will establish the \nPF and appoint the fund manager, with ADB concurrence, within 6 months after \nloan effectiveness and prior to disbursement for the PF. \n(x)  The Government will reallocate cess funds to the umbrella body for research on \nproduct  development  and  process  improvement,  and  consider  favorably \nreallocating cess funds to the operating expenditure of the industry umbrella \nbody by June 2003. \n(xi)  Subsidiary  loan  agreements  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  be  signed  between  the \nGovernment  and  the  PF  within  9  months  of  loan  effectiveness  (prior  to \ndisbursement for the PF), and between the apex body and PFIs for the workers\u2019 \nhousing loan scheme within 1 year of loan effectiveness. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n69.   The following are the conditions for loan effectiveness: \n \n(i)  The Government will have reached agreement with at least 10 divested RPCs to \nrevise their lease payments and cap management fee. \n(ii)  A subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to ADB will be signed and will have \nbecome effective between the Government and the apex body. \n ", " 20 \n \n(iii)  The apex body will have signed a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to ADB \nwith at least one PFI for the investment component. \n(iv)  The bill for reconstituting the boards of related institutions (TRI, TSHDA, NIPM, \nSLTB) will have been submitted to Parliament for approval. \n \nC.  Condition for Disbursement \n \n70.  No project funds will be disbursed to any RPC until RPC has entered into an agreement \nwith the Government to revise the lease rental payments and cap its management fees. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n71.

The Plantation Sector \n \n1.  The tree crop (tea, rubber and coconuts) sector contributes 15.6% of agriculture's gross \ndomestic product (GDP) and 3% of total GDP. About 40% of the tea and rubber land are in the \nplantation sector, with the balance in the hands of smallholders. The plantation sector accounts \nfor 19% of foreign earnings and employs 290,000 workers.  \n \n2.  The  plantation  sector  was  nationalized  following  land  reform  in  1972  when  land \nownership was restricted to 20 hectares (ha). About 500 tea, rubber, and coconut estates \ntogether  with  400  tea  and  rubber  factories  were  nationalized  and  vested  in  two  state \ncorporations, the Janatha Estate Development Board (JEDB) and the Sri Lanka State Plantation \nCorporation (SLSPC). The threat of nationalization prior to its occurrence had discouraged \ninvestments, and the nationalized estates were in a poor state. Weak management during state \nownership as well as restrictive regulations and inappropriate fiscal policies undermined the \ncomparative competitiveness of the sector and resulted in JEDB and SLSPC turning in annual \nlosses for most of the period up to 1992. The decision was taken to restructure the plantations \nbecause the losses were a drain on the state coffers. The 450 estates were formed into 22 \nregional plantation companies (RPCs),1 which were contracted out to private management \ncompanies (MCs) for management on 5-year terms. This was not workable as the 5-year \ncontracts were too short for the MCs to invest in long-term development. \n \n3.  Divestment of the RPCs began in 1995 with support from the ongoing project,2 which \nwas designed to (i) support the policy and institutional reforms in the sector, and (ii) provide \nlong-term  funds  to  eligible  RPCs  through  the  commercial  banks.3  The  main  policy  reform \nagenda was the divestment of the 23 RPCs. Other policy reforms included raising the ceiling of \ndirect exports by tea producers to 50% of production; reconstitution of the boards of related \ninstitutions  (Tea  Research  Institute,  Sri  Lanka  Tea  Board,  National  Institute  of  Plantation \nManagement,  Tea  Smallholdings  Development  Authority,  Rubber  Research  Institute  and \nCoconut Research Institute); and restructuring of the remaining estates managed by JEDB and \nSLSPC. The project components were (i) a credit component to provide investment funds to \neligible RPCs; and (ii) a noncredit component for reforestation of watersheds, improvement of \nworkers housing, institutional strengthening, and project management.  \n \n4.  The main policy agenda was largely accomplished with 20 of the RPCs divested of. Two \n(Chilaw and Kurunegala Plantation Ltd.) remained in private management, and one (Elkaduwa \nPlantation Ltd.) was still managed by a state corporation. Divestment of Elkaduwa has been \ninitiated with an invitation to bid in the local papers, and the decision has been made to divest \nChilaw and Kurunegala in 2003. The ceiling for direct tea exports was raised to 50%. The bills \nfor  reconstituting  of  the  boards  of  the  related  institutions  were  submitted  for  Parliament \napproval.  The  dissolution  of  Parliament  in  October  2001  and  the  change  of  Government \nrequired  the  draft  bills  to  be  resubmitted  to  Parliament,  and  Cabinet  approval  has  been \nobtained. A review of JEDB and SLSPC was carried out but restructuring was limited to merging \nthe  two  boards.  The  decision  was  made  to  divest  of  the  estates  and  warehouses  of \nJEDB/SLSPC. \n                                                 \n1  Another regional plantation company was formed out of 11 estates in July 1993. \n2  ADB. 1995. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Sri \nLanka for the Plantation Reform Project. Manila, due to close in December 2002. \n3  The Project is cofinanced by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation with a loan of Y4,076 million.  \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \n5.  The project achievements of replanting/infilling/upkeep of 6,903 ha tea and 20,451 ha \nrubber, and diversification on 1,785 ha far exceed the targets of 3,124 ha, 11,750 ha, and 100 \nha, respectively. The achievements for improving workers' housing and reforestation are 45,000 \nunits and 4,605 ha against the targets of 35,000 units and 5,000 ha. As part of institutional \nstrengthening, a tea sector strategy study was undertaken to set the long-term direction for the \ntea industry. The study concluded that, with the higher growth in supply relative to demand, tea \nprices would remain low and the plantation sector would need to go downstream to capture a \ngreater  margin  of  the  retail  tea  trade.  The  study  recommended  measures  to  support  the \ntransformation from primary producers of tea to agribusiness entities, with focus on marketing, \nproduct research and development, and self-regulation through an industry umbrella body. \n \n6.  While the targets were exceeded and an estimated 25% of worker families benefited \nfrom the reroofing scheme, it is still too early to evaluate the impact of the ongoing project. The \nRPCs\u2019 tea yield has increased 3% and rubber yield has stabilized. Collectively, the RPCs\u2019 \nprofitability has improved significantly from a loss of SLRs 1.7 billion in 1993 to a profit of \nSLRs1.6 billion in 2000 (Table A3). Nevertheless, the financial positions of RPCs are still mixed, \nwith  seven  rated  as  strong,  nine  as  moderate,  and  four  as  weak.  Financial  performance \nunderscores the problems and constraints faced by the plantation sector that has just made a \ntransition from state ownership to private ownership.  \n \nB.  Constraints and Challenges \n \n7.  Despite gains made in yields after privatization, the plantation sector still faces low \nproductivity. The sector\u2019s average tea yield of 1,500 kg/ha is much lower than that of the \nsmallholder sector (2,200 kg/ha) and other tea producing countries such as India (1,700 kg/ha) \nand Kenya (2,200 kg/ha). Likewise, the rubber yield of 900 kg/ha is below the average of about \n1,400 kg/ha in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Many factors account for the low yields. The \nthreat of nationalization had discouraged investments. Although investments were subsequently \nmade during state ownership and, then after divestment, these investments were far less than \nthe  requirements.  Besides,  they  did  not  produce  the  expected  benefits  because  of  weak \nmanagement during state ownership. In addition, during state ownership the sector was isolated \nfrom development in other countries and no new technology had been introduced to improve \nproductivity and efficiency. Restrictive regulations and excessive taxes on the sector further \nundermined its competitiveness. These factors have made Sri Lanka a high-cost producer of \nthese commodities with consequent low profitability in the sector. \n \n8.  The sector remains vulnerable to fluctuations in the international prices of tea and rubber \nand will be increasingly under pressure with the current trend of higher supply growth vis-\u00e0-vis \ndemand in the world market. At the same time, RPCs remain as primary producers, unable to \ncapture a bigger margin of the increasing retail trade value. This is especially true for tea, where \n95% of production continues to be sold in the tea auction. Although the auction is seen as a \ntransparent  means  of  price  determination  and  has  the  advantage  of  a  wide  presence  of \ninternational buyers, there is growing dissatisfaction on how the auction is currently operated. \nAlthough the Government has raised the ceiling on direct tea exports by producers to 50% \nunder the ongoing project, direct exports are still very difficult in reality because tea traders and \nexporters actively discourage it. With their stronger influence with the Sri Lanka Tea Board \n(SLTB), the tea traders have effectively lobbied for a single-channel marketing system through \nthe auction. The rules and regulations imposed by SLTB also tend to favor sales through the \nauction. Other reasons for RPCs\u2019 inability to go into direct exports include their lack of marketing \nexpertise, lack of contact with buyers, and inability to offer appropriate lot sizes. The scenario is \ndifferent for rubber where regulations on marketing are less and linkages between producers ", "  Appendix 3  29 \nand marketing companies, overseas buyers,and manufacturers are more developed in spot and \nforward sales contracts.  \n \n9.  The vulnerability of RPCs to fluctuations in international prices of tea and rubber reflects \ntheir  concentration  on  these  two  core  crops.  The  plantation  sector  has  traditionally  been \nreluctant to consider enterprise diversification seriously. With the present trend of commodity \nprices, RPCs are beginning to realize the importance of diversification to reduce dependence on \none or two crops and to optimize land use. Nine RPCs have diversified into crops other than \nforestry, several are leasing land to other firms for diversification, and two are negotiating joint \nventures for crop and noncrop diversification. But the main constraint to diversification is the \nabsence of the requisite managerial, technical, and marketing skills. Other constraints are the \nrestrictive  phytosanitary  regulations  for  import  of  improved  planting  materials,  lack  of \nappropriate research and development on key crops, and high duties on agribusiness inputs.   \n \n10.  Investments to improve the productivity of core activities as well as diversification into \nother crop and noncrop activities assume an available supply of cheap labor to work on the \nestates. This is no longer the case, as economic diversification in the country and education \nhave opened up employment opportunities in other sectors. The challenge to RPCs is to retain \nthe  workers  with  a  competitive  remuneration  package  while  grappling  with  issues  of  low \nprofitability and commercial viability. Wages in the plantation sector are below those in other \nsectors  although  this  is  compensated  somewhat  by  the  housing  and  other  benefits  that \nplantations historically provided. However, the standard of living in the estate sector is lower \nthan that in other sectors. In fact, 80% of the housing is in the form of barracks-type line rooms \nthat are overcrowded, badly ventilated, badly lighted, with leaky roofs and inadequate sanitary \nfacilities. The poor living conditions and the past top-down management approach have given a \nstigma to estate employment. The estate workers are mainly descendants of migrant laborers \nfrom  India  and  their  legacy  of  living  in  enclaves  in  the  estates  has  isolated  them  from \nmainstream society. Statistics indicate that the estate sector has a high incidence of school \ndropouts, youth unemployment, alcoholism, and indebtedness. It is therefore not surprising that \nlabor  shortage  looms  because  estate  youth  prefer  employment  outside  the  estates.  The \nimportance  of  good  housing  and  working  conditions  was  stressed  during  the  participatory \nworkshops and some RPCs have recognized the impact of living and working conditions on \nproductivity. \n  \n11.  Investments to improve the productivity of the sector require long-term financing as the \nenterprises have a long gestation period. However, long-term funds are not available in the \nbanking system. In addition, the interest rates are distorted by Treasury bond rates so that \nreturns from investments do not match the interest rates. The problem of availability of long-\nterm funds was alleviated somewhat by the ongoing project but the loan proceeds for the credit \nline has been fully utilized. A revolving fund, established to plough back the repayments into the \nsector, will address this funding problem somewhat. However, some commercial banks have \nindicated that they have reached their limits in exposure to the plantation sector and would not \nbe able to finance the sector further even if funds were available. At the same time, the poor \nfinancial position of some RPCs has rendered them uncreditworthy in the eyes of the banks.  \n \n12.  The  poor  financial  position  of  some  RPCs  is  due  to  a  number  of  reasons.  The \nprivatization procedures were changed midstream to push up the share prices of RPCs, and \nsome parent companies had taken loans to pay for the shares. The parent companies then \nresorted  to  extracting  management  fees4  to  repay  these  loans.  In  addition,  RPCs'  lease \n                                                 \n4    Although in accordance with the Government's privatization prospectus, these are high relative to profit levels. \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \npayments to the Government, which are escalated annually using the GDP deflator index, also \nthreaten to reach levels beyond the capacity of RPCs in the very near future. If not addressed, \nthe excessive management fees and the escalation of lease payments will erode the financial \nposition of more RPCs and render them more vulnerable to external factors.  \n \nC.  Lessons Learned \n \n13.  The tree crop sector has received considerable assistance from aid agencies, with the \nWorld Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) being the main sources. ADB has given \neight loans to the plantation sector since 1968 (Appendix 2), but the development of the sector \nwas suppressed by inappropriate regulations and fiscal policies.5 The earlier projects provided \nthe funds for development but did not address the issue of policy environment. In providing \nassistance  to  the  state  corporations,  the  past  projects  prolonged  state  ownership  and \ncontributed to the inefficiency and decline of the sector. It was therefore recommended that ADB \ncontinue to give emphasis on assistance for reforms that will ensure market-driven adjustments \nand sustainability of the sector. Reforms started under the Second Program Loan with the \nreduction in cess and elimination of export duties. The ongoing project further addresses policy \nissues through privatization and institutional reforms. \n \n14.  The implementation of the ongoing project has provided some useful lessons. The major \nlesson is that the Government should maintain a consistent and well thought-out policy to \nachieve the desired benefits. The privatization of RPCs aimed to improve profitability by putting \nmanagement decisions with the private sector. However, the policy was not followed through \nbecause of political intervention; three RPCs were not divested and no progress took place in \nrestructuring JEDB and SLSPC.  \n \n15.  Another lesson is the difficulty of policy reform, given the vested interest of the different \nsegments of the industry. Although the Government raised the ceiling for direct exports to 50%, \nSLTB continues to impose restrictions that favor single-channel marketing through the auction \nbecause of the stronger influence of the tea buyers. Likewise, the restrictions on forestry and \nother activities restrained RPCs\u2019 efforts to diversify from their core activities. Vested interest and \npolitical interference also affected the institutional reforms that were aimed at improving the \neffectiveness of the related institutions.  \n \n16.  The ongoing project also demonstrates that the legacy of public ownership remains in \nthe management of the divested RPCs. RPCs still lack expertise in marketing and diversification \nactivities. In many cases, investments in field and factory development were carried out as a \nmatter of habit and not as a result of strategic business planning. The results are suboptimal \ninvestments and the slow pace of diversification to broaden the profit base.  \n \n17.  Lastly, the ongoing project addressed the immediate need for reroofing of the workers' \nhouses, but does not address the workers\u2019 aspirations for house ownership and improvement of \ntheir  social  status.  Experience  from  the  Dutch-financed  Plantation  Development  Support \nProgramme (1998-2005) also demonstrates the need to address the workers\u2019 aspirations for \nbetter  living  conditions  and  improvement  of  their  social  status.  However,  the  overlap  of \nresponsibilities  for  workers  welfare  and  conflicting  programs  by  different  ministries  tend  to \nundermine the sustainability of the housing and social programs. \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1996.

The policy agenda under the ongoing project remains incomplete because of lack of \npolitical  commitment.  The  Government  that  came  into  power  in  December  2001  indicated \ncommitment to the reforms, which are in line with the Government\u2019s policy of deregulation. \nSpecifically, the Ministry of Plantation Industry has declared diversification as the cornerstone of \nthe policy for the sector and accepted the recommendations of the Tea Sector Strategy Study \non the plantation sector moving into value-addition and marketing of tea. Negotiations are under \nway for divestment of Elkaduwa Plantation Ltd. and local papers have published an invitation to \nbid.  The  decision  has  been  made  to  divest  Chilaw  and  Kurunegala  by  June  2003.  The \nGovernment informed the Mission that there are plans to divest the estates of JEDB/SLSPC \nindividually, and the warehouses will be available for development by the private sector. The \nGovernment  also  informed  the  Mission  that  Cabinet  approval  has  been  obtained  for \nresubmission for Parliament approval of the draft bills for reconstitution of the boards of related \ninstitutions.  There  has  been  strong  political  commitment  to  establishment  of  the  industry \numbrella body, which is in the process of being registered under the Companies Act as the Tea \nAssociation of Sri Lanka. \n \n ", " \nTable A3: Profit before tax \n(SLRs'000) \n \n  1993  1994  1995  1996  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001a \n1.

The Need for the Plantation Fund  \n \n1.  The banking sector in Sri Lanka lacks long-term funds, and lending is based on collateral \nrather than on enterprise viability. Financing problems arise in the plantation sector where the \nfinancial health of some regional plantation company (RPCs) is deteriorating while their debt-\nbearing capacity has reached the upper limits. At the same time, the participating financial \ninstitutions (PFIs) have indicated that their exposure to the plantation sector has reached the \nceiling. The implication is that the PFIs may not be in a position to meet the credit demands of \nRPCs even though external funding is available. As availability of long-term funds is critical for \nreplanting, product development, and diversification in the plantation sector, other means of \nfinancing must be explored. An alternative is to establish a plantation fund (PF) that will provide \ndirect funding in terms of equity and quasi-equity instruments (including direct equity, preference \nshares, and convertible bonds). Thus, the PF will complement the PFIs in financing the sector \nand also help to move the sector toward using the capital markets.  \n \nB.  Objectives  \n \n2.  The main objective of the PF is to provide medium- and long-term funding to eligible \nRPCs to strengthen their capital structure. This will increase the shareholder value in the \nplantation sector. The second objective is to instill financial discipline in the RPCs through the \nuse of convertible debt instruments that enable the PF to convert debt into equity and effect a \nchange in the equity structure of RPCs.  \n \nC.  Proposed Structure  \n \n3.  The  decision  on  the  structure  of  the  PF  considered  a  company  and  a  trust.  The \nadvantages of a company are that (i) its legal status is more permanent; (ii) it can legally take \ncharge over collateral offered by the borrower and enforce it more effectively if the need arises; \n(iii) it has tax benefits, as dividends from investments in RPCs would be tax-free; (iv) it can more \neasily establish its name in the marketplace and lend itself to eventual privatization; and (v) it \nhas easier access to capital markets. The advantages of a trust are that (i) it is set up for a \nspecial  purpose  and  the  trustees  are  responsible  for  safeguarding  its  interests;  (ii)  its \nbeneficiaries  are  its  owners;  (iii)  its  structure  is  more  result-oriented  and  does  not  permit \ninterference from the Government; (iv) it is tax-free as long as all profits are distributed and self-\nliquidating;  and  (v)  consensus  building  on  the  board  of  trustees  is  much  easier  with  the \nparticipation from all sectors. \n \n4.  In view of the objective of the PF, a trust was preferred as it gives operational flexibility \nand independence to the fund manager to achieve the desired level of performance. The board \nof trustees will comprise eight trustees from various sectors of the economy: (i) one from \nMinistry of Finance (MOF), (ii) one from Ministry of Plantation Industries (MPI), (iii) three from \nRPCs on a 2-year rotation, (iv) one from the Planters\u2019 Association (PA), and (v) two from the \nbanking sector on a 2-year rotation basis.  \n \n5.  The PF will be set up for a period of 10 years initially. This period can be extended if \nnecessary. The PF will be managed by a professional fund manager appointed for a 2-year term \nby the trustees, with the concurrence of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The criteria for \nselecting the fund manager will include (i) alliance with an international fund management \ncompany and a local financial services management company with a minimum of $150 million ", "  Appendix 5  35 \nunder management, (ii) audit reports for the past 2 years, and (iii) details of experience in the \nregion  and  capability  to  transfer  expertise  and  knowledge.  The  fund  manager  will  be \ncompensated on performance basis and will take direction on policy matters from the trustees. \n \n6.  The PF will be established under the purview of the MOF, which will have primary \nresponsibility for its establishment. MOF will be responsible for (i) preparing and appointing the \ntrustees in consultation with MPI, PA, and ADB; (ii) establishing the trust under the Trust \nOrdinance; (iii) finalizing the criteria for selecting the fund manager; (iv) preparing the tender \ndocuments  to  invite  bids  from  the  fund  managers;  (v)  evaluating  the  bids  to  make \nrecommendations to the trustees; and (vi) preparing the trust deed to be signed by MOF and the \ntrustees. It is expected that the establishment of the PF will be outsourced, as personnel for this \nfunction are not available at MOF.  \n \nD.  Operation  \n \n7.  The operational details of the PF will be contained in the trust deed signed by the \ntrustees and MOF. Under the Trust deed, the trustees promise to exercise due diligence and \nvigilance in carrying out their functions and duties in protecting the rights and interests of the \nPF.  The trustees will appoint a compliance officer to ensure that the fund manager and his \nteam comply with the laws, rules, and directives pertaining to the operations of the PF. The fund \nmanager will prepare an annual budget and marketing plan for the trustees\u2019 approval. The fund \nmanager will also prepare the details of the running operations for approval by the trustees, and \nthey will form part of the trust deed. The main challenge initially will be to build a team of \nprofessionals to execute the working plans.  \n \n8.  The Government will make the loan funds available to the PF at the average weighted \ndeposit rate under a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to ADB. The initial size of the PF \nwill be about $13 million, comprising $5 million from the ordinary capital resources loan and $8 \nmillion from the revolving fund established under the ongoing project and provided through a \nsubsidiary loan agreement between the Borrower and the PF. The PF should build up to at least \n$30 million so as to attract the attention of international fund managers. Depending on the \ndemand for credit and instruments issued by the PF, further resources from the revolving fund \nwill be transferred to the PF. \n \n9.  The fund manager will invest in equity and quasi equity instruments issued by the \neligible RPCs. Instruments will be the selected on the basis of the investment criteria and \ncovenants set out for RPCs. The higher risk investment will carry strict covenants and more \ndiscretionary powers for the fund manager to protect the investment. For example, for higher \nrisk RPCs, the fund manager can use convertible preferred shares or debentures, which can be \nconverted into ordinary shares in case of any violation of the investment agreement. The fund \nmanager  will  make  investment  recommendations  to  the  trustees  based  on  predetermined \ncriteria that may take into account the RPCs\u2019 (i) past 5 years' financial statements without major \naudit qualification, (ii) current valuation on net assets, (iii) projected improvements in profitability \nand future cash flow, (iv) clear strategic plans for improving future profitability, and (v) policy on \nmanagement fees and dividends.  \n \n10.  The PF will set (i) investment limits that will cap the investment in a company to 20% of \nits capital base or 10% of the PF\u2019s capital, whichever is lower, (ii) exit mechanisms in order to \nlock  in  profits  and  create  room  for  additional  investments,  and  (iii)  stop-loss  limits  for \ninvestments in quoted equities. The investments may be medium - or long-term depending on \nthe prevailing market conditions, and the fund manager will employ hedging techniques to \n ", "36  Appendix 5 \nminimize the default risk. The fund manager will maintain a system where the investments are \nmarked to market on a weekly basis and action plans are revised in view of revised valuations. \nThe fund manager will not seek to participate in any takeover attempts on the RPC and will take \nmeasures to protect the interest of the PF.  \n \n11.  The PF will maintain separate accounts. The audited accounts accompanied by the \nauditors\u2019 certificate in accordance with Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 will be submitted to MOF, \nthe trustees, and ADB not later than 9 months after the end of the fiscal year.  \n \nE.  Benefits and Risk \n \n12.  With the high exposure of PFIs to the plantation sector acting as a deterrent for further \nonlending, the PF will create incremental credit appetite for this sector through a combination of \ndebt and equity solutions in conjunction with PFIs. Since the PF will mainly concentrate on \nequity-based solutions, it may be in a better position to cover a majority of RPCs. The PF will \nhelp promote economic efficiency of the plantation sector through efficient allocation of funds to \nthe best-managed RPCs. The introduction of equity and quasi-equity linked instruments will not \nonly enforce financial discipline in RPCs but also contribute to the development of the capital \nmarket in the country. Eventually, it will help this sector move away from the culture of subsidies \nand grants. As investment decisions of the PF will be based on profitability and risks of the \nenterprise  as  well  as  financial  accountability  of  RPCs,  they  will  require  strategic  business \nplanning and financial discipline on the part of the RPCs.  \n \n13.  The performance of the PF will depend solely on the fund manager\u2019s professionalism \nand ability to make wise investment decisions. The related risks can be mitigated by strict \ncriteria for selecting of the fund manager and a system to evaluate performance regularly. The \ninvestment risks of the PF include the interest rate risk, default risk, and liquidity risk. The fund \nmanager can manage these risks by structuring appropriate instruments, which may be listed or \nunlisted depending on the investment criteria. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 6  37 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.

A substantial fraction of the total population in Sri Lanka depends on the viability of \nthe plantation sector. The sector faces a looming labor shortage because of voluntary unemployment of the youth, \nout-migration, and high absenteeism. This is due to the present poor living and working conditions of the estate \nworkers and the low social status of estate employment. The development of the plantation sector will improve the \nprofitability of the regional plantation companies (RPCs), and enable them to provide a better remuneration package \nto workers. Improved industrial relations and social stability in the plantations will contribute to reduction of conflict-\nrelated poverty. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                       Proposed Classification: Economic Growth  \nTaking the higher poverty lines of the Department of Census and Statistics and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, \nSLRs950 and SLRs1,032 respectively, the average monthly income of SLRs2,579 per worker indicates that poverty \nshould not be as pronounced on the plantation sector. In addition, estate workers have security of employment and \nalso receive other benefits that bring the total income of the estate worker family to a higher level than that of the \nnonestate rural workers. However, the estate population experiences other forms of poverty. They are socially poor \nand among the lowest strata of Sri Lankan society. Mismanagement of the household finances results in a low level \nof savings.  High dependence on informal moneylenders and higher than average expenditure on alcohol contribute \nfurther to a high level of indebtedness. Other reasons are lack of motivation from the absence of ownership of assets \nand loss of income from voluntary unemployment of the youth. There is a very high school dropout rate, with less \nthan half the national average seen pursuing secondary education, due to lack of resources to send the children to \nschool, lack of easy access to education, and the perceived lack of social mobility in mainstream society. Social \nexclusion is a dimension of poverty that impacts heavily estate workers. To a large extent the estates are ethnic \nenclaves where the estate workers are restricted to employment opportunities available in the estates. Lack of \nmobility, lack of freedom of movement, and social stigma make the living and working conditions of the estate \nworkers even more difficult.  \nPlease refer to Appendix 7 for the Social Analysis. \n \nC.

Historical Background  \n \n1.  The estate workers are predominantly Tamils of Indian origin and have worked for \ngenerations in the plantations of Sri Lanka. From the beginning of the first labor migrations in \nthe 1830s until around 1900, the estate resident worker population was not permanent and this \nfact  was  reflected  in  the  housing  and  living  environment.  The  turn  of  the  century  was \ncharacterized by a willingness of immigrant workers to adopt the estate as a more permanent \nhome. A cholera epidemic in the mid-1860s had a serious impact on the supply of labor and led \nto the Medical Wants and Diseases Ordinances that empowered the Director of Health Services \nto prescribe the specification of the workers\u2019 line housing, including size, location, materials \nused, and sanitary standards. The result was the standardized housing model with its uniform \nline rooms located in pockets around the estates. With the nationalization of the plantations, the \nJanatha  Estates  Development  Board  and  the  Sri  Lanka  State  Plantations  Corporation \nestablished social development divisions (SDDs) to address the welfare requirements of the \nplantation  workers  in  housing  infrastructure  and  health.  After  privatization,  the  Plantation \nHousing and Social Welfare Trust (PHSWT) was established to assume the role of SDDs to \nimplement worker welfare programs with the participation of the government, trade unions, and \nthe regional plantation companies (RPCs).1  \n \nB.   Socioeconomic Profile of the Estate Workers \n \n2.  From a socioeconomic point of view, the estate workers are a uniform group. The \ndifferentiations within the communities depend on the geographic distribution. Estate workers in \nthe low country are more closely integrated with the estate\u2019s peripheral environment. Workers in \nthe up country are more isolated and tend to look inward toward their own community for \nsupport. This attitude is also reflected in their aspirations. Workers in the low elevations are \nmore prepared to work outside the estate and even migrate to the towns, and their housing \npreferences are for detached units with a high degree of privacy. On the other hand, the up-\ncountry workers prefer to remain on the estate if a desirable living environment is provided, but \ntheir offspring prefer other forms of employment off the estates.  \n \n3.  The living conditions on the estates are inferior to those in other sectors of the economy \n(Table A7). Availability of good sanitation facilities and electricity is low, as is the availability of \nhousehold assets. Barrack-type or line room housing still accounts for 70-80% of all estate \nhouses. The majority of the households have one room. The living environment is the most \nimportant issue for the workers. Improving the existing housing model, as carried out in the past, \nno longer meets their aspirations. The workers are looking beyond such short-term solutions. \n \n4.  The estate sector has the lowest unemployment rate in the country because of the \nmandatory offering of work to estate workers and the reduced economically active population. \nThe majority of the educated youth are expressing aversion to plantation work, and their parents \nwish to see their children working outside the estate. The quest of about 169,500 people for out-\nof-estate work or to out-migrate increases voluntary unemployment in the estates. A drift to \nnonestate jobs occurs mainly in the lowlands or where there are other work opportunities. As a \nresult, RPCs' depend on an increasingly small pool of estate labor and in the future will have to \ndeal with a permanent shortage of labor if estate employment is not made more attractive. \n                                                 \n1  The Plantation Housing and Social Welfare Trust was established as a transitional institution, to gradually fade \naway when the assigned tasks were completed. ", "  Appendix 7  39 \nHowever, working outside the estate was only the second-best choice for the youth, since \nestate  work  provides  job  security,  housing  and  other  amenities,  and  a  familiar  social \nenvironment, whereas out-of-estate work means insecurity and a high cost of living. \n \nTable A7: Features of Estate Workers, as of 2000a \n \nEstate Workers           Number        % \nDemographical Features \nTotal number of workers  265,000 \nResident workers  223,000  84 \nResident households  186,000 \nResident population  777,000 \nYouth population  169,386  21.8 \nChild population   241,888  31.1 \nLiving Conditions \nHouseholds living in line rooms with 1 room  139,500  75 \nHouseholds with roofing of metal sheets  130,200  70 \nHouseholds with latrine facilities  130,200  70 \nHouseholds with electricity    22,320  12 \nHealth and Education \nPer capita daily calorie intake      2,674 \nSickness incidence      8.5 \nLiteracy \n      Female    67 \n      Male    87 \nEducation\u2014Secondary level and above    20.2 \nSchool avoidance of children aged 5-14     21,216  12.7 \na  Source: Project preparatory technical assistance final report, December 2001. \n \n5.  The major problem with plantation work is the social stigma associated with it, due to the \ndifficult  working  conditions,2  substandard  living  conditions,  inferior  health  and  education \nfacilities, and the heavy top-down management style. Estate work is seen as a vocation with low \nsocial status and the plantation workers are seen as an inferior social group. The workers \nthemselves feel the management has a low regard for them and they are discriminated against \nin Sri Lankan society. Their self-esteem is also lowered by their struggle for citizenship, their \nisolation  and  powerlessness.  The  workers  feel  ashamed  to  identify  themselves  as  estate \nworkers. There is, however, a sharp geographic division in their attitudes toward this issue: \nworkers in low country estates are more conscious of the social stigma because they interact \nmore with society outside the estate. There is less of this consciousness in the up country \nestates, where \u201coutside\u201d the estate is likely to be yet another estate. \n \n6.  Among the estate population, abuse of alcohol is a problem leading to poor health, \ndomestic violence on women and children, disputes, absenteeism, and negative household \nsavings. Men and women spend up to 50% of their salaries in liquor. Awareness of the effects \nof alcoholism among the estate workers is poor; a large number believe in its \u201cmedicinal\u201d \nbenefits  and  many  women  believe  that  the  men  \u201cdeserve\u201d  to  drink.  The  difficult  working \nconditions and the lack of leisure activities within the estates also contribute to the problem.  \n                                                 \n2  The majority of the estates do not have basic amenities for workers, such as rest and toilet facilities either in the \nfield or in the factories. \n ", "40  Appendix 7 \nAlcoholism  has  only  recently  been  recognized  as  a  priority  problem,  and  anti-alcoholism \nprograms have been put in place in some estates. \n \n7.  A special feature of estate employment is a high rate of female labor participation in \nharvesting operations. Female and male workers receive the same daily salary although women \nwork longer hours than men. The greater availability of work for pluckers and tappers often \nresults in women\u2019s monthly salaries being higher than the salaries of their husbands. However, \nwomen do not have control of their earnings and are not part of the household decision-making \nprocess.  Women  often  experience  periodic  bouts  of  poverty,  when  through  illness  of  the \nchildren, they are unable to report for work or when, due to antiquated labor practices, field \nworkers are not paid if they are a few minutes late in coming to work. \n \nC.  Industrial Relationship and Workers Institutions \n \n8.  An  estate  has  a  hierarchic  structure  for  management  and  control  of  households. \nManagement and senior staff are predominantly Sinhalese. The workers are predominantly \nTamil and are peers, whether they are pluckers, tappers, factory workers, or sundry workers as \nthey have the same daily wage and can be switched to other tasks. The few office positions are \nusually filled by Sinhalese applicants from outside the estate. Due to a traditional top-down \nmanagement style and the marginalization of the estate community, there is ethnic tension in \nthe  estate  sector  that  can  potentially  be  explosive.  Unfavorable  socioeconomic  conditions, \nthinking along ethnopolitical lines, and the disadvantageous position of the ethnic community of \nTamil workers are additional factors.  \n \n9.  Formal  institutions  within  the  estates  include  the  trade  unions,  the  Estate  Worker \nHousing Cooperative Societies (EWHCS), and various other committees.3 The EWHCS were \nestablished in 1993 on the initiative of the Ministry of Plantation Industries as the umbrella \norganization of the various workers committees to plan and to monitor social welfare programs, \nthrough which the government, international aid agencies, and the RPCs channel their funds. \nThey were created on a top-down initiative and, for this reason local participation is limited: only \n20% of them are fully operational.  \n \n10.   There are currently 60 trade unions in the estates with local representatives to facilitate \ndiscussion in case of conflict. The Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) and the Lanka Jathika \nEstate  Workers  Union  (LJEWU)\u2014the  two  largest\u2014are  involved  in  the  negotiations  on  the \ncollective  agreement  with  the  Employers  Federation  of  Ceylon.  Although  traditionally  very \nstrong, the unions are now struggling to increase the number of their members. In the past the \nunions were extremely confrontational. At present, industrial relations within the plantations can \nbecome tense because of the close connection of unions to political parties. Nonetheless, the \nnumber of strikes decreased drastically from 331 (1,936 working days lost) in 1998 to 131 (337 \nworking days lost) in 1999. \n \nD.  Impact of the Ongoing Project and Lessons Learned \n \n11.  The ongoing project includes a comprehensive social and institutional strengthening \ncomponent. The investment in housing was to meet an urgent short-term need to rehabilitate \nthe existing line room units. This need was met by reroofing 25% of the line rooms. However, \nsuch  improvement  no  longer  meets  the  workers\u2019  long-term  aspirations  for  a  better  living \n                                                 \n3  Apart from the traditional religious institutions, the estates lack community organizations, and only a few community \ngroups are able to collectively deal with common problems. ", "  Appendix 7  41 \nenvironment. Nevertheless, this activity will be continued in the future, albeit at a slower pace, \nas only a limited number of separate housing units can be provided over the project period.  \n \n12.  The flexibility given to the project implementation unit to allocate funds on a demand-\ndriven basis provides an incentive for RPCs to experiment with new social initiatives, such as \nparticipatory  management  teams  and  anti-alcoholism  programs.  Christian  American  Relief \nEverywhere (CARE International) implemented in 103 estates the worker education and training \nprogram  (WET),  which  aimed  at  building  the  capacity  of  management  and  workers  and \nintroducing participatory management practices. The program provided technical assistance \nand training to the management and estate workers, worker education, and communication \nskills development. The nongovernment organization\u2014Alcohol and Drug Information Center \n(ADIC) - is active in nine estates to prevent alcoholism and drug abuse. The program consists of \nstreet  dramas;  cricket  competitions  among  young  people;  and  training  and  orientation  of \nmanagement, health staff, and workers.  \n \n13.  RPCs  adopt  different  strategies  and  policies  for  improving  management-worker \nrelationships. Some favor participatory management, while others adopt quality circles and Five \nS systems4 on the principle that employee participation in decision-making and problem solving \nimproves the quality of work. The number of industry-wide strikes involving loss of working days \ndecreased  drastically  in  the  late  1990s.  The  ongoing  project  brought  about  a  change  in \nmanagement attitudes toward workers and also toward the training of workers. Less than 1% of \nthe workers had received training before the ongoing project; now, 25-30% have since received \nsome kind of training in technical and life skills. More important, training institutions as well as \nRPCs have adapted themselves to undertake training in the plantation sector. \n \n14.  A lesson learned is that labor should be considered an investment rather than a cost, \nand human capital and social development should be an integral part of RPCs\u2019 corporate \ndevelopment  strategy  if  the  plantation  sector  is  to  be  profitable.  To  be  successful,  social \ndevelopment programs should have a strong commitment at management level and should be \ndemand-driven.  Another  lesson  learned  touches  on  the  number  of  approaches  to  social \ndevelopment and participatory decision making; each RPC should adopt the approach best \nsuited to its purpose. \n                                                 \n4  Small groups of workers who perform the same tasks meet voluntarily, on a regular basis on paid time, to discuss \nproblems, seek solutions, and cooperate with the management in implementing solutions. \n ", "42  Appendix 8 \nETHICAL TRADE INITIATIVES AND FAIR TRADE \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  The tea producers in Sri Lanka, both plantations and smallholders, currently sell 95% of \ntheir tea production in the Colombo auction although regulations allow them to directly export \n50% of production. The situation is partly due to their lack of marketing skills and limited access \nto major buyers. While it is recognized that the auction will remain the main marketing channel \non account of its transparency, its role as the sole price determination point for tea, and the \nwidespread international presence, the producers are dissatisfied with the present system. \nThere are complaints of blacklisting by the buyers at the auction if direct sales are made. \nMoreover, the direct sales of tea by producers have to be valuated and certified by an Export \nValuation Panel, which comprises representatives of the Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB), tea \nbrokers,  and  exporters,  but  with  no  representative  of  producers.  There  are  complaints  of \ninstances when the panel had refused to ratify the prices on the allegation that they are too low, \nhowever, the tea subsequently obtained lower prices at the auction. Hence, producers are \nlooking for marketing options other than the tea auction.  \n \nB.  Initiatives of NGO \n \n2.  There is a growing consumer and media-led movement in the importing countries of the \n\"North\" to demand that the tea they drink be produced under clean and hygienic conditions by \nworkers whose terms of employment and social and welfare facilities are fair and adequate. \nThis awareness is one of the prime factors for the fair trade tea, which together with sustainable \ntea (organic tea and shade tea), forms a small, but fast growing, niche market. The concept of \nethical trade initiatives is to promote an equitable trading partnership that will provide a fair \nshare of the profits along the supply chain, as market forces alone have not been able to do so. \nThe general oversupply in the global tea market has caused prices of tea as a commodity to \nstagnate for the last 40 years, while the retail prices of packet tea have been on the rise. As a \nresult, the tea producers and primary processors together capture only 20% of the total product \nvalue. This has led to the conclusion that tea producers and primary processors will need to go \ndownstream into value addition and marketing to capture a larger margin of the total value of the \ntea trade. \n \n3.  Recognizing consumers\u2019 requirements, nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and tea \nbuyers are promoting ethical trade initiatives. The Fairtrade Labeling Organizations (FLO) aims \nto contribute to change in international commercial relations so that disadvantaged producers \ncan increase control over their future by having a fair and just return for their work, continuity of \nincome, and decent working and living conditions through sustainable development. FLO has \nbeen active in the tea industry in Sri Lanka since 1995 and has registered 11 tea estates for fair \ntrade. Presently only 1% of the total tea production of these estates is exported under fair trade \nlabeling. The fair trade terms of trading ensure a price that covers the cost of production, as \nspecified by the supplier, and includes a social premium for improvement of the socioeconomic \nsituation of the workers, and contracts that allow long-term planning and sustainable production \npractices. In Sri Lanka, the FLO label attracts a premium of up to Euro1 per kilogram to be paid \ninto a fund jointly managed by the management and worker representatives. Part of the fund is \nto be used in social and welfare projects for the workers according to their priorities.  \n \n4.  Oxford Committee for Famine Relief (Oxfam) is another NGO that works on ethical trade \ninitiatives and carries out fair trade labeling for tea in Sri Lanka in conjunction with FLO. Oxfam\u2019s \nbelief in \u201cthe rights to a sustainable livelihood, and the rights and capabilities to participate in ", "  Appendix 8  43 \nsocieties and make positive changes to people\u2019s lives\u201d is in line with ethical trade initiatives. The \nOxfam Fair Trade offers a model in which the benefits of trading are shared more equitably \nbetween the producers, traders, and customers. \n \n5.  An ethical trade initiative in the consuming countries is the Tea Sourcing Partnership \n(TSP), which represents 80% of the buyers in the United Kingdom (UK). TSP has put together a \nlegal package based on relevant laws and union agreements and has completed social audits \nand certification procedures for the tea industry in Kenya and Malawi. The tea suppliers are \nmeasured against a local legal framework comprising (i) terms and conditions of employment, \n(ii) health and safety in the workplace, (iii) sanitation and water access, (iv) education and \nmaternity  provisions,  and  (v)  housing.  TSP  plans  to  begin  operations  in  India,  Indonesia, \nTanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. The methodology involves completion of the questionnaire, \nan  independent  audit  by  internationally  reputable  social  auditors,  and  certification  as  an \napproved tea supplier on compliance. In Sri Lanka, TSP has carried out a pilot social audit and \ncompleted an appropriate questionnaire for tea suppliers. It plans to audit 550 tea estates and \nfactories in Sri Lanka in 2003 because 4% of the total tea imported into the UK comes from Sri \nLanka. Eventually estates that do not meet the social audit requirements will not be able to sell \ntheir tea to tea buyers of the UK. \n \nC.  Case for Project Intervention \n \n6.  The Project will support the NGOs\u2019 fair trade labeling initiatives and expand fair trade \nlabeling in the 500 tea estates in the country. While the benefits of ethical trade initiatives to the \nworkers cannot be denied, these initiatives have put the onus of better employment terms and \nworkers\u2019 living conditions on the estate/factory owners without drawing attention to their limited \nopportunities for alternative marketing to improve their profitability. With the tea auction being in \noperation for more than a hundred years, it may be time for a review and change in the system. \nThe change should include realignment in the role of the related institutions to serve a privatized \nplantation sector as well as a change in the role of the Government from that of a regulator to a \nfacilitator.  The  Government  has  committed  to  a  policy  of  deregulation;  however,  this \ncommitment appears not to have filtered down to senior officials.  \n \n7.  The Project will therefore seek the assistance of the fair trade organizations and NGOs \nto play an advocacy role and to educate the public on the need for changes in the tea industry. \nIn particular, the Project will seek the assistance of FLO and Oxfam, the two NGOs that have \nsuccessfully highlighted the plight of coffee producers in South America during the recent \ncollapse in coffee prices. \n \n \n \n ", "44  Appendix 9 \nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN  \n \nTable A9.1: Project Cost Estimates \n($ millions) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nComponent  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  As set out in Appendix 3, the plantation sector is faced with low productivity and high \nproduction costs as a result of the age of the plantings and condition of the estates. These \nfactors,  together  with  state  ownership  and  inappropriate  fiscal  policies,  had  previously \nundermined the comparative advantage and competitiveness of Sri Lanka. Despite this, the \nWorld Bank concluded that the plantation sector still has a comparative advantage, with the \ndomestic resource cost of 0.8 for tea and 0.69 for rubber.1 This analysis is based on the \nproduction and cost streams over the economic life of the crops. The analysis is, however, \nsensitive to complex interacting factors including Government policies, changes in international \nprices, factor prices, and yields. In the simplest case, replanting of overaged plantings under the \nProject will lead to improved yields and, in turn, the comparative advantage. However, the \ndownward trend in international tea and rubber prices could erode this comparative advantage. \nTo counter this, the Tea Sector Strategy Study has recommended value addition and market \nstrategies to retain a higher margin of the retail value. \n \n2.  This  analysis  begins  with  an  evaluation  of  the  potential  subprojects  that  can  be \nundertaken by the regional plantation companies (RPCs). This is followed by an analysis of two \nsample RPCs to indicate how the different business strategies and the different subprojects \nundertaken will affect the profitability and financial viability of RPCs. The overall viability of the \nProject and its sensitivity to adverse conditions are also analyzed. \n \nB.  Subproject Analysis \n \n3.  The  potential  subprojects  include  core  crop  and  diversification  activities.  Core  crop \nactivities  include  replanting  of  tea,  rubber,  and  coconuts;  infilling  of  tea;  and  factory \nrationalization and automation. Crop diversification activities include planting of oil palm, pepper, \ncinnamon, arabica coffee, cardamom, commercial forestry, vegetables, and fruits. The noncrop \ndiversification activities include estate tourism and mini-hydropower generation. The subproject \nanalysis for field development of core crops and crop diversification is on a per hectare basis, \nwhereas the analysis for nonfield activities such as factory rationalization and mini-hydropower \nstations is on an activity basis. The subproject analysis takes into account all capital and \noperating costs, and production over the economic life of the subproject. \n \n4.  A standard conversion factor of 0.94 was used to obtain border values of nontraded \ninputs/outputs. With the labor shortage in the plantation sector, the wage rate reflects the \neconomic opportunity of labor and so the gross wage rate was taken to be the shadow wage \nrate. The gross daily wage inclusive of all benefits is SLRs136.15 for tea and SLRs126.70 for \nrubber. The January 2001 World Bank commodity price forecasts were used to derive the \nimport and export parity prices of traded inputs and commodities such as tea and rubber. For \nother commodities, the current prices given in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka's annual report \nwere used. The without project benefit was taken at 450 kg/ha for tea and zero for rubber and \nother crop and noncrop diversification activities. The detailed assumptions for subprojects are \npresented in a supplementary appendix. The analysis used constant 2002 prices. \n \n5.  The computed financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) for each subproject using the preceding assumptions are set out in Table A11.1. \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 1993.

These rates of return were compared with the onlending rate, i.e., average weighted \ndeposit rate plus maximum of 5%, which is 15-16% at present. At the historical inflation rate of \napproximately 10%, the onlending interest rate will be 5% in real terms.  Table A11.1 shows that \nall subprojects have FIRR well above the real interest rate. Hence, all the subprojects under \nconsideration are financially viable.   \n \n7.  To be economically viable, subprojects must have an EIRR in excess of the opportunity \ncost of capital, which is normally 12%. Table A11.1 shows that all subprojects have an EIRR in \nexcess of the opportunity cost of capital and are therefore economically viable.    \n \nC.  Analysis of Sample RPCs \n \n8.  Financial analysis was carried out for two sample RPCs over a 10-year period on a with-\nand without-project basis. The details are in a supplementary appendix. RPC 1 is financially \nstrong with a net operating margin of 14.8% and a debt-equity ratio of 0.4. Its current asset of \nSLRs407 million adequately covers its current liabilities of SLRs338 million. RPC 2 has a net \noperating profit margin of 3.7% and a debt-equity ratio of 0.84. Its current liabilities of SLRs518 \nmillion far exceed its current assets of SLRs194 million. While RPC 1 still has debt-bearing \ncapacity and can meet the participating financial institution criteria, RPC 2 will not meet the \ncriteria unless there is capital injection or restructuring. The two RPCs also differ in their \nbusiness strategies. While RPC 1 intends to invest in subprojects with longer gestation period \nsuch as field development and factory consolidation, RPC 2's strategy is to invest in subprojects \nwith shorter gestation period such as marketing and product processing. Both RPCs' profitability \nis sensitive to fluctuations in international tea and rubber prices. \n \n9.  The analysis indicates that RPC 1's production and average sales prices with the Project \nare expected to increase as a result of increased yields stemming from the investments in field \ndevelopment and greater uniformity in quality arising from factory consolidation. At the same \ntime, the cost of production is expected to decrease. The net result is increase profitability that \n ", "50  Appendix 11 \nwill enable RPC 1 to meet its increased obligations for debt servicing. The impact of the Project \non the RPC's profitability and financial viability is thus significant. \n \n10.  RPC 2's production of tea and rubber is not expected to increase with the Project as its \nstrategy is to diversify into marketing. The marketing efforts are expected to increase the tea \nprices  by  2%  annually.  At  the  same  time,  income  from  other  enterprises  such  as  mini-\nhydropower generation is expected to increase over the project period. Its strategy of investing \nin shorter gestation subprojects will enable it to turn around quickly in terms of profitability and \ncash flow. RPC 2 will be able to meet its debt-servicing obligations and still have surplus cash.  \n \n11.  The analysis shows that the Project will improve the profitability and cash flow of the \nRPCs to achieve the Project objective of enhancing the sector's sustainability. The analysis also \nshows that the project impact on financially weak RPCs is expected to be much greater than on \nthe stronger RPCs. \n \nD.  Project Viability \n \n12.  The  financial  and  economic  analyses  for  the  Project  assumed  a  6-year  project \nimplementation period. The analysis was done on a with- and without-project basis for 40 years \nto cover one economic cycle of tea, rubber, and forest plantations. The overall project viability \nwas  assessed  based  on  the  costs  of  all  components  and  the  quantifiable  benefits  of  the \ninvestment component as set out in Section IV of the main text. The benefits from the social \ncomponent, which are nonquantifiable, are not included.  \n \n13.  On this basis, the FIRR of the overall Project is 14%, which is much higher than the real \ninterest rate of about 5%. The EIRR of the overall Project is 16%, also substantially above the \nopportunity cost of capital of 12%. The overall Project is financially and economically viable.  \n \nE.  Sensitivity Analysis \n \n14.  Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effect of price declines and cost overruns \non the FIRR and EIRR of the Project. Table A11.2 shows that the project is equally resilient to \ncost overruns as to reduction in revenues. It is resilient to delays in realizing of benefits and \nremains viable even with a 2-year delay. Even a combination of lower revenues and higher \ncosts will still yield an EIRR of 12%, the cutoff point for projects.   \n \nTable A11.2: Results of Sensitivity Analysis \n  \nDetails  EIRR % \nBase Case  16 \n10% Decline in Revenue  14 \n10% Cost Overrun  14 \nCombination of Decline in Revenue and Cost Overruns  13 \n1-Year Delay in Benefits  15 \n2- Years Delay in Benefits  14 \nEIRR=economic internal rate of return, FIRR=financial internal rate of return. \n \n15.  A switching value analysis shows that it will take an 18.5% increase in cost to bring the \nnet present value (NPV) to zero at a 12% discount rate. It will take a 15% reduction in benefits \nto produce the same results. Thus, the Project remains viable even with adverse conditions. ", "Appendix 12  51 \nENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS IN APPROVING THE SUBPROJECT \n \n1.  The initial environmental examination (IEE) of the proposed Project was carried out to \nidentify  measures  to  prevent  or  mitigate  any  adverse  environmental  impacts,  which  could \npossibly arise from its implementation. The Project is classified as environmental category B. \nThe IEE study was prepared based on the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA), \ncomprehensive  reports  by  relevant  Government  agencies,  research  institutions,  and  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Mission findings.  \n \nA.  Environmental Requirements \n \n2.  The subprojects that could be financed under the proposed investment are varied: (i) \nfield development and mechanization of core activities of tea, rubber and coconut; (ii) crop and \nnoncrop diversification including spices, coffee, forestry, and estate tourism; and (iii) factory \nconsolidation and automation, effluent treatment for rubber factories, and rehabilitation of mini- \nhydro stations.1 As the subprojects to be financed remain to be determined and could fall into \ncategories A to C of ADB\u2019s environmental classification system, a set of environmental criteria \nfor selection is set out in Table A12. These criteria will be attached to the loan agreement \nbetween the Government of Sri Lanka and the designated apex body, and to the subsidiary loan \nagreement between the apex body and the participating financial institutions (PFIs).  \n \n3.  No subproject of the investment component will entail new clearing of forestland nor \nseek to replace any of the natural ecosystems with designed agricultural systems. All project \nactivities are to be undertaken on company lands, which either are already under plantation \ncrops (tea, rubber, or coconut) or have been under such crops but are now abandoned. In \ngeneral, the Project will result in significant environmental benefits and will not cause serious \ndisturbance  to  the  environment  and  the  ecological  balance.  None  of  the  subprojects  is \nassociated with potential significant adverse environmental impacts that cannot be avoided or \nmitigated through the environmental protection measures that are incorporated into the design \nof the Project.  \n \n4.  Besides the subprojects of the investment component, the Project has a substantial \nsocial  and  environment  program.  The  program  involves  a  construction  of  6,000  houses, \nreroofing of 11,000 existing line rooms and providing of common animenities. It also involves \nland-use surveys on 190,000 hectare to assist in land-use planning and leading to prevention of \nsoil deterioration and erosion. Measures to ensure minimal negative environmental impact are \nincorporated and the landuse surveys are expected to have positive impact. \n \nB.  Environmental Review Procedure \n \n5.  The PFIs and the subprojects to be financed will be required to comply with the relevant \nlaws and regulations of Sri Lanka, particularly with the National Environmental Act, 1980 and \nthe National Environmental Regulation No. 01 of 1993 (procedure for approval of projects). \nThey will also comply with the ADB\u2019s environmental requirements. The commitment of PFIs and \nregional plantation companies to adhere to ADB\u2019s environmental and social guidelines have \nbeen included in the loan covenants. \n                                                 \n1  If the Project will involve planting and processing of products such as oil palm, a detailed economic, physical, \nenvironmental, and social impact assessment will be carried out. The report will be submitted to the Central \nEnvironmental Authority (CEA) and ADB for review. The summary environmental impact assessment as well as the \nreport will be circulated to the Board 120 days before the subproject is implemented.  \n ", "52  Appendix 12 \n6.  DFCC  Bank  has  been  designated  as  the  apex  body  for  the  credit  line  under  the \ninvestment component and for the workers\u2019 housing loan scheme. Environmental and social \naspects have been an integral part of DFCC Bank\u2019s project appraisal. The bank has internalized \nits environmental and social impact analysis and has established its policies and procedures to \naddress environmental and social issues. The environmental policy has three main guiding \nprinciples: protection of the environment, efficient use of natural resources, and promotion of \nenvironmentally  sound  projects.  DFCC  Bank  has  an  environmental  cell  that  carries  out \nenvironmental appraisal2 for all projects being considered for financing. The cell reviews all \npipeline projects at the initial stage of appraisal and assigns a category (A to C) depending on \nthe nature of the environmental impact. Category A projects have little to no environmental \nimpact and the appraisal is limited to reviewing the documents. If the review identifies potential \nproblems, the project may be reclassified. Each category B and C project is reviewed and its \nsite  visited  when  the  project  is  evaluated.  The  records  of  appraisal  are  retained  as  the \nenvironmental due diligence report, which forms part of the covenants/conditions for the loan. \nADB should have access to those records to undertake environmental due diligence for all \nsubprojects, if necessary. The PFIs have full responsibility for undertaking environmental due \ndiligence for all subprojects. This requirement has been included in the loan covenants. DFCC \nBank has presently two senior environment officers with environmental background and its \nproject  appraisal  staff  is  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  policy  and  environmental \nassessment guidelines. \n \n7.   As the apex body for the credit line, DFCC Bank is responsible for ensuring that the \nselected PFIs have a satisfactory organizational setup, an appropriate environmental policy, and \nestablished procedures to incorporate environmental concerns into project design through their \nappraisal process. \n \nC.  Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n8.  The Project seeks to institutionalize strategic business planning that will link subprojects \nto the regional plantation companys' profitability and will be a means for avoiding and mitigating \nthe potential environmental impacts associated with the subprojects. Through strategic planning \nand by identifying key issues that will benefit strategic planning, RPCs can achieve sustainable \nprogress in handling environmental issues if they build into their management structure an \nability to monitor compliance ahead of interventions by Government agencies and PFIs in \nresponse to specific complaints. RPCs will be encouraged to monitor their own environmental, \nhealth, and safety performance, and their compliance with the requirements of ethical trading \nprograms in conjunction with other national and international quality assessment (such as ISO) \nand certification companies. The aim is to stimulate social responsibility by linking compliance \nwith market opportunities. \n \n9.  The primary responsibility for promoting sustainable practices will rest with the Central \nEnvironmental  Authority  and  relevant  research  institutions  and  the  Ministry  for  Plantation \nIndustries. DFCC Bank and the selected PFIs are responsible for monitoring the performance \n(including  environmental)  of  the  subprojects  by  submitting  to  ADB  through  the  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  quarterly  reports  containing  a  section  on  the  environmental \nperformance of the subprojects. If the borrowing RPC does not meet the loan conditionalities, \nthe PFIs will assist the RPC to meet the environmental loan conditions. However, if the RPC \ncontinually does not meet the requirements, the loan disbursement will be suspended until the \n                                                 \n2  The DFCC Bank appraisal procedure follows the guidelines given in the Manual on Environmental Assessment  of \nSMI project, prepared by the Environment Resource Management Institute (UK) for the Government of Sri Lanka ", "Appendix 12  53 \nproblems are resolved. Avoidance and mitigation of potential adverse impacts will also depend \non  the  effectiveness  of  random  monitoring  by  the  PIU.  With  regard  to  forestry  activities, \nvillagers, local nongovernment organizations, and community-based organizations are known to \nbe very vocal where the RPCs have not complied with the legislations. The Project will continue \nto engage those groups as an essential part of environmental monitoring.  \n \nD.  Public Disclosure \n \n10.  DFCC Bank and the selected PFIs will be responsible for ensuring that all environmental \ndocumentation (environmental checklists, IEE and summary initial environmental examination, \nenvironmental impact assessment and summary environmental impact assessment) are part of \nthe loan documents drawn up with RPCs. All environmental documents are subject to public \ndisclosure, therefore, they should be made available to the public, if requested. \n \n \n ", " \nTable A12: SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA \n \nProject Activity  Special Specifications \nNo subproject of the investment component will entail new clearing of forestland nor seek to replace any of the natural ecosystems with designed agricultural \nsystems. All project activities are to be undertaken on company lands. An initial environmental examination (IEE) will be prepared for each subproject and submitted \nto the participating financial institutions and Central Environmental Authority as required.
