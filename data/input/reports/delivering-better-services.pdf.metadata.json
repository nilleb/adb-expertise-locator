They  comprise  thousands  of  small \nislands scattered over an area almost as great as the land area of all ADB\u2019s other developing \nmember countries (DMCs) combined. The PDMCs constitute almost one third of ADB\u2019s DMCs.  \n \n2. \nThese basic facts directly shape both the content and the delivery of ADB\u2019s operational \nservices  in  the  Pacific  region.  While  ADB\u2019s  new  lending  commitments  have  averaged  about \n$100  million  per  year  recently,1  our  analytical  and  policy-related  work  are  an  especially \nimportant  operational  instrument.    Indeed,  the  ratio  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  lending \nvolume in the PDMCs is seven times higher than the ADB average (Appendix 1).  This presents \nunique  demands,  but  also  unique  opportunities,  with  respect  to  program  formulation,  design, \nand supervision. \n  \n3. \nIn  September  2000,  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  approved  an  ambitious  new  strategy \ndesigned  to  better  focus  ADB\u2019s  analytical  and  operational  work  on  the  core  development \nchallenges in the Pacific region. The Pacific Strategy for the New Millennium2 emphasized the \nneed  for  deeper  ADB  engagement  in  several  critical  areas\u2014through  our  operational  work;  by \nbuilding  stronger  partnerships  across  the  community  of  development  partners;  and  by  tapping \nmore  effectively  into  the  insights  and  resources  of  a  wider  range  of  partners,  including  the \nprivate sector.   \n \n4. \nADB has also taken a number of important steps over the past year to better organize \nand  align  its  operations  with  the  evolving  needs  of  the  PDMCs  and  with  these  strategic \ncommitments.    In  January  2002,  the  Office  of  Pacific  Operations  was  upgraded  to  full \ndepartment  status  while  maintaining  its  basic  structure  along  preexisting  lines.    With  a  full \nintegration of \u201cprogram\u201d and \u201cproject\u201d functions, Pacific Department (PARD) staff generally work \nin a matrix fashion, with flexibility in country assignments, and combining skills in programming, \nprocessing, and administration.  \n \n5.  \nAs  an  extension  of  these  efforts,  ADB  has  done  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  options \nwith respect to the physical location of PARD staff and, specifically, the merits of additional ADB \noffices  in  the  Pacific  region  (see  Appendix  1).    The  core  objective  in  this  work  has  been  to \nidentify whether and how an expanded field presence could significantly strengthen our capacity \nto  deliver  additional,  high-quality  services  to  the  PDMCs.    Over  the  past  year  we  have \nconducted  extensive  consultations  with  the  full  range  of  ADB  members,  including  extensive \ndirect consultations in the PDMCs by senior ADB officials.  In addition, we have benefited from \ndirect feedback from the Executive Board, both through a full discussion in October 2002 of a \nworking paper  on  possible  options,  as  well  as  in  a  subsequent  informal  seminar  on  a  revised \napproach.  All of this work has been extremely helpful in weighing alternatives, identifying and \ndiscussing issues of concern, and setting out the full range of views.   \n \n6. \nThe  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  report  to  the  Board  on  the  results  of  this  analysis  and \nconsultation,  and  to  present  a  revised  proposal,  summarized  below,  that  we  believe  is \nresponsive to the various issues and concerns that have been raised. \n\n                                                 \n1   As at 31 December 2002, there were 33 loans worth $495 million under implementation.  \n2   ADB. 2000. Pacific Strategy for the New Millennium. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \nBox 1: Proposed Approach \n\n \n\u2022  A  Pacific  Subregional  Office  will  be  opened  in  Suva,  Fiji  Islands  in  2004;  this  office  would \nhave the mandate to perform the full range of Resident Mission functions and would anchor \nour regional presence. \n\n \n\u2022  A Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office will be opened in Sydney, Australia, also in 2004; \n\nthis office would be a hybrid, performing both operational and coordination work. \n\n \n\u2022  The  current  office  will  be  maintained  in  Port  Vila,  Vanuatu,  with  a  review  after  both  the \n\nSydney and Suva offices are fully functional. \n\n \n \n7. \nSection  II  briefly  summarizes  relevant  elements  of  ADB\u2019s  Resident  Mission  Policy. \nSection III identifies the key criteria against which alternatives were assessed, and summarizes \nkey  findings  of  the  assessment.    Section  IV  presents  a  prospective  division  of  functions  and \nresponsibilities between ADB headquarters and offices in the Pacific.  Section V briefly outlines \nthe  proposed  organization  and  structure  of  the  proposed  offices.    Section  VI  highlights  the \nsecurity  considerations.  Section  VII  outlines  the  incremental  costs  of  the  preferred  option. \nSection  VIII  discusses  the  expected  benefits  of  the  approach  outlined  above.  Section  IX \npresents  the  recommendations.  Appendix  1  outlines  the  detailed  analysis  of  six  optional \nlocations.  Appendix  2  presents  the  expected  organization  and  structure  of  the  proposed  Suva \noffice, with an estimate of costs. Appendix 3 presents the expected organization and structure of \nthe  proposed  Sydney  office  and  summarizes  the  anticipated  costs  and  implementation \nschedule. \n \n\nII. \n\nADB\u2019S RESIDENT MISSION POLICY \n\n \n8. \nADB\u2019s  Resident  Mission  Policy  states  that  a  resident  mission  (RM)  should  be \nestablished \u201cin each borrowing developing member country where it is practicable to establish \nit.\u201d  However, the policy also explicitly recognizes the special circumstances of the PDMCs and \nthe need for a pragmatic approach to dealing effectively with those circumstances.  In particular, \nthe  policy  contemplates  that  individual  PDMCs  could  be  served  effectively  and  appropriately \nthrough  offices  not  physically  located  in  the  country  where  services  are  being  delivered.    The \nagreed upon policy thus builds in a degree of flexibility in light of the unique circumstances and \nchallenges  of  the  Pacific  region.    The  policy recognizes that resident missions, while primarily \noperational, also have significant representation functions. \n \n\nIII. \n\nRATIONALE AND JUSTIFICATION  \n\n \n\n9. \nAgainst  the  background  of  both  the  flexibility  of  the  Resident  Mission  Policy,  and  the \nmultiple  objectives  that  an  effective  field  presence  would  need  to  serve,  a  limited  set  of \nevaluation criteria were established.  The core objective was to arrive at a set of proposals that \nwill  position  ADB  to  deliver  the  fullest  and  best  possible  service  to  the  PDMCs  within  a  very \nconstrained resource envelope.  \n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nBox 2: Evaluation Criteria \n\n \n\n \n\u2022  Position  ADB  to  deliver  superior  KPS  to  its  PDMCs,  backed  by  financial \n\nresources.  \n\nIncrease the frequency of contact between ADB and PDMC officials, and \nthe frequency of ADB participation in PDMC events. \n\n\u2022  Optimize staff resources available for on-site operational work by reducing \n\nthe current high proportion of mission time spent in transit. \n\nIncrease ADB access to, and contact with, a greater range of key Pacific \nregion development partners from both the public and private sectors.  \n\n\u2022  Ensure cost effectiveness. \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSuva, Fiji Islands \n\n \n10. \nOf  six  possible  alternative  combinations  assessed  against  the  criteria  in  Box  2,  two \nemerged  as  the  dominant  options  for  cost-effective  offices:  Suva,  Fiji  Islands  and  Sydney, \nAustralia (Appendix 1).3 Both offer attractive and, in many respects, complementary, features.  A \ncareful assessment of the attributes and costs of each led to the conclusion that a presence in \nboth locations, commencing in 2004, and combined with an ongoing anchor function in Manila \nand a full RM in PNG4, would offer maximum benefits. ADB\u2019s current field presence in Vanuatu \nand in Timor-Leste would be reviewed once the Suva and Sydney offices are fully functional. \n \nA. \n \nOperational  Travel  Issues.  With  respect  to  operational  travel,  the  Fiji  Islands  offers \n11. \nadvantages that exceed those of any other PDMC location.  The Fiji Islands is served by eight \ninternational airlines. On average, there are three flights per week from Nadi to other PDMCs, \nwith  travel  time  of  less  than  1  day.5    Over  the  next  few  years,  the  Fiji  Islands  is  expected  to \nincrease in importance as a travel hub for the Pacific, including through prospective upgrades of \ninternational air service direct to the Suva area. \n \nDirect Contact with PDMC Officials. The international airport at Nadi is a regional hub \n12. \nthrough  which  PDMC  officials  often  transit.  The  Fiji  Islands  hosts  numerous  conferences  and \nworkshops.    Hence,  many  PDMC  working  level  officials  have  opportunities  to  travel  to  the  Fiji \nIslands,  and  about  20  senior  officials  could  be  expected  to  visit  an  ADB  office  in  Suva  each \nyear. \n \n\n                                                 \n3  Several PDMCs have kindly offered to host ADB offices (including Sam oa, Fiji Islands, and Cook Islands).  These \noffers  are  greatly  appreciated  and  each  was  carefully  examined,  particularly  in  terms  of  travel  connections  and \nproximity to other development partners. Office costs are a relatively minor component of PARD\u2019s cos t structure. \n\n4  The PNG Resident Mission (RM) has been approved and will be established in 2003. \n5  The convenience of this transport hub is limited to some extent by the need to travel from Suva to Nadi for most  \ninternational trips \u2013 a 3 hour trip by car or a domestic flight connection from Suva\u2019s Nausori airport.  Many of the \nflights to and from Nadi arrive or depart late at night, often necessitating transit accommodation in Nadi. \n\n\f4 \n\nDeepening Partnerships.  The  Fiji  Islands  is  the  regional  location  for  several  United \n13. \nNations  and  Pacific  Island  Forum  agencies,6  as  well  as  the  European  Union.  It  is  also  the \nlocation  of  the  Pacific  Financial  Technical  Assistance  Centre,  for  which  ADB  is  a  cofinancier.   \nDevelopment  funding  sources  with  offices  in  Suva  include  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development,  Peoples\u2019  Republic  of  China,  Japan,  and  New  Zealand  Agency  for \nInternational  Development.    The  University  of  the  South  Pacific,  based  in  Suva,  has  a  well-\ndeveloped distance education capacity for PDMCs. \n \nInformation  and  Communication  Technology.  Although  current  communication \n14. \nfacilities  have  limitations  and  are  relatively  costly,  the  Fiji  Islands  is  expected  to  build  up  its \ninformation  and  communication  technology  capacity  to  international  standards  in  the  medium \nterm, and ADB is assisting in this effort. \n \nB. \n\nSydney, Australia \n\n15. \nOperational  Travel  Issues.  Sydney  has  major  advantages  in  terms  of  travel \naccessibility  and  interaction  with  ADB\u2019s  stakeholders  and  development  partners  in  the  Pacific.   \nSydney is served by 44 international airlines providing 960 flights per week. On average there \nare 7.2 flights per week from Sydney to each PDMC, with travel time of less than 1 day. Sydney \nhas long been the main \u201cgateway\u201d for ADB missions from Headquarters traveling to the PDMCs.   \n \n16. \nDirect  Contact  with  PDMC  officials. On the basis of observed travel patterns, senior \nPDMC government officials and civil society delegation visits to or through Sydney would likely \naverage at least 40 per year. This compares with eight government delegation visits per year on \naverage  to  ADB  Headquarters  in  Manila.    Various  organizations  in  Sydney  regularly  host \nimportant development-related events involving senior PDMC officials.  At present, the majority \nof the ADB Institute\u2019s seminars for senior Pacific officials are being held in Australia due to its \naccessibility and the availability of suitable facilities, including for larger conferences.  \n \n17. \nDeepening Partnerships.  Sydney  has  the  largest  concentration  of  development  and \nacademic institutions, multinational businesses and financial institutions, and civil society groups \nin  the  Southern  Pacific  region.    The  World  Bank  and  International  Finance  Corporation  have \noffices  there,  and  it  is  the  headquarters  of  the  South  Pacific  Project  Facility.  The  European \nInvestment Bank is also considering opening its Pacific office in Sydney in 2003.  Sydney hosts \nnumerous  Pacific  island  research  centers,  such  as  the  Research  Institute  for  Asia  and  the \nPacific. Major international media groups are represented. Sydney is the regional headquarters \nfor many major foreign and domestic banks, and hosts more than two thirds of the Asia-Pacific \nregional headquarters of multinational corporations. An ADB presence in Sydney, with a strong \nfocus  on  liaison  and  coordination,  would  enable  ADB  to  more  effectively  project  its  own  and \nPDMC  views  to  the  wider  funding  community,  as  well  as  to  more  effectively  tap  into  the \nknowledge and experience of others.  Given PARD\u2019s particular emphasis on delivery of KPS to \nits PDMCs, access to this broad community and pool of knowledge is a significant advantage.  \n \n18. \ntechnology  and \ncommunications  facilities  are  excellent,  enabling  reliable  and  low-cost  contacts  with  key \ndevelopment partners in the region and globally; these facilities would also reduce the need for \nsome travel, including by non-PARD Headquarters staff. \n\nInformation  and  Communication  Technology. \n\nInformation \n\n                                                 \n6   These  include  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  Pacific  Forum  Secretariat,  World  Health    \n\nOrganization,  South  Pacific  Applied  Geoscience  Commission,  Pacific  Community, \nOrganization, Tourism Council of the South Pacific, and United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund.  \n\nInternational  Labor \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nOverall Assessment \n\nC. \n \n19. \nThe  combination  of  new  locations  seen  as  offering  the  highest  level  of  service, \nefficiency,  and  incremental  benefits  for  the  PDMCs  and  ADB  is  offices  in  both  Suva  and \nSydney. A Sydney-based Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office (PLCO), to be opened in early \n2004,  will  provide  PDMCs  operational  services  on  a  selective  basis,  supplementing  continued \nManila-based operations (Appendix 3). ADB would expect to open the main subregional office in \nSuva  later  in  2004  (Appendix  2),  with  our  Fiji  portfolio  having  expanded  significantly,  and  with \nbetter  travel  hub  and  communication  facilities  coming  on  stream.  Overall,  the  complementary \nnature of the two new offices in Suva and Sydney would make optimal use of their respective \nadvantages  and  provide,  for  ADB  and  the  PDMCs,  the  strongest  possible  network  of  offices \nwithin the Pacific to enhance ADB\u2019s responsiveness and the quality of its services (see Box 3).  \nOnce both offices are fully operational, our current offices in Vanuatu and Timor-Leste would be \nseriously reviewed, possibly retaining liaison staff only.7 \n \n \n\n \nBox 3:  Complementarity of Suva and Sydney Office Locations \n \n\nComplementarity \n\nAccess to key development \npartners \n\nContact with the academic \ncommunity  \n\nLogistical arrangements \n\nCommunications, both among \nsubregional offices and with \nHeadquarters \n\nSuva and Sydney Combination \n \nSuva hosts important regional organizations, plus the United \nNations and European Union subregional offices; Sydney \nhosts other key development partners. There is no \nsignificant overlap. \nSuva has the main subregional university, University of the \nSouth Pacific, and its outreach to all Pacific countries; \nSydney has five universities with academic interests related \nto the Pacific region. \nSuva/Nadi provides direct, short duration flights to Tonga, \nSamoa, Cook Islands, and Tuvalu; Sydney has frequent \nflights to all PDMCs.  There are daily flights between the Fiji \nIslands and Australia. \nA hub and spoke telecommunications system can be \nestablished with Sydney as the hub, at considerably less \ncost than separate leased lines to each office.  Broadband \nconnection via the Southern Cross Cable is possible \nbetween Suva and Sydney, but not to any other PDMCs at \nthis stage. \n\n \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nFUNCTIONS OF NEW PACIFIC REGION OFFICES \n\nStandard Functions \n\n \nA. \n \n20. \nIn line with the objectives of the Resident Mission Policy, complementary offices in Suva \nand Sydney could be expected to perform all standard functions (government, civil society, and \n\n                                                 \n7    A  decision  on  future  representation  in  Timor-Leste  will  be  made  once  the  scale  of  ADB  operations  becomes   \nclearer.  In  the  meantime,  the  Special  Office  for  Timor-Leste  is  performing  the  standard  functions  of  a  resident \nmission. \n\n\f6 \n\nfrom  close \n\nSpecific Functions \n\nprivate  sector  relations;  policy  dialogue  and  support;  country  reporting;  aid  coordination;  and \nexternal  relations  and  information  dissemination),  as  well  as  some  specific  functions  as \ndescribed below. The PLCO in Sydney would be a hybrid office combining selected operational \nfunctions with coordination work. \n \nB. \n \n21. \nOver  the  2-year  period  (2004\u20132005),  substantial  country  programming  and  project \nadministration  responsibilities  would  be  shifted,  in  a  phased  manner,  to  the  new  offices.  The \nPacific  Operations  Division  in  Headquarters  would  remain  the  focal  point  for  regional  strategy \nformulation and overall program coordination, substantial loan and TA project processing work, \nand country programming in the North Pacific DMCs (Marshall Islands and Federated State of \nMicronesia).  Continuing  significant  loan  processing  responsibility  at  Headquarters would help \ndraw \ninteraction  with  supporting  departments  (Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department, Office of the General Counsel, etc.) during the project design phase. \nHowever,  full  use  would  be  made  of  telecommunications  services  between Headquarters and \nthe field, as well as PARD\u2019s flexibility to deploy its sector experts to areas of greatest need. In \nview of the limited staff resources in PARD, it would be necessary to continue to operate in a \nflexible, matrix-style format, capitalizing on the specific expertise of staff regardless of location. \nTo the extent possible, all staff would be given additional training to reinforce this objective and \norganizational structure. By 2005, the split between Manila-based and field-based professional \nstaff  would  be  about  60:40,  although  this  would  be  kept  under  constant  review.  Importantly, \nmost PARD staff outside ADB headquarters would be located in PDMCs. The  office alignment, \nliaison and coordination with key development partners, and emphasis on KPS delivery would \nalso help ADB to make the most effective use of non-PARD staff expertise in the various ADB \nknowledge departments, in conducting research, post evaluation, training, and workshops in the \nPacific region.  \n \nThe  RM  in  PNG  is  not  envisioned  as  having  a  subregional  function,  although  staff  are \n22. \nlikely to be involved in regional activities, such as TA, training, and capacity building programs. \nThe  office  in  Port  Vila  would  continue  to  emphasize  operations  on  Vanuatu,  where  a \nconcentrated approach by ADB is needed to assist the Government to build on recent reforms \nsupported  by  ADB.  However,  current  South  Pacific  Regional  Mission  staff  (including  support \nand  regional  staff)  have  built  up  considerable  knowledge  and  expertise  covering  other South \nPacific countries, and they would be expected to contribute, as time and workloads permit, to \nthe  functions  of  the  Sydney  and  Suva  offices,  particularly  in  the  transitional  period,  until  these \noffices become fully operational. PARD expects to make significant efforts to retain and recruit \ncompetent PDMC staff for all of ADB\u2019s field locations. \n \n\nV. \n\nORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE \n\n \n23. \nThe number of staff at the Pacific Subregional Office in Suva would reflect the workload \nanticipated in 2004 and beyond. The Suva subregional office would be established initially on a \nmodest  scale,  with  three  professional  staff  (the  country  director  and  two  programs  or  projects \nofficers/economists),  redeployed  from  ADB  headquarters.  Other  staff  would  consist  of  three \nregional  officers  (one  for  finance  and  administration  and  two  for  project  administration  and \nregional  economic  work)  and  six  nationally  recruited  administrative  staff  (See  Appendix  2).    In \naddition  to  an  expanding  portfolio  of  projects  in  the  Fiji  Islands,  the  subregional  office  would \ncover operations in Tonga, Samoa, and Tuvalu. \n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nThe number of staff at PLCO would reflect its workload and hybrid nature. The Sydney \n24. \noffice would be established on a modest scale, with four professional staff (the country director \nand  three  project  specialists/economists),  mainly  redeployed  from  ADB  headquarters.  Other \nstaff  would  consist  of  three  regional  officers  (one  for  finance  and  administration  and  two  for \nproject  administration  and  regional  economic  work)  and  five  support  staff.    To  the  extent \npossible,  staff  would  be  drawn  from  the  Pacific  region.    In  addition  to  its  essentially \nrepresentation  functions,  the  office  would  be  operationally  responsible  for  all  of  the  southern \nPDMCs, and once the Pacific Subregional Office is fully functional, would remain responsible for \nCook Islands, Nauru, Solomon Islands, and Kiribati.  PLCO would also provide back up support \nfor  Timor-Leste  and  Vanuatu,  pending  future  decisions  on  the  scale  of  Pacific  offices  in  those \nlocations. \n \n\nVI. \n\nSECURITY CONSIDERATIONS \n\n \n25. \nFiji Islands has had a rather turbulent past, with coups in 1987 and 2000, in part related \nto  the  ethnic  mix.    Following  free  and  fair  elections,  the  Fiji  Labour  Party  has  challenged  the \nconstitutionality of the current Government, and the Supreme Court is scheduled to address this \nissue in June 2003.  Nevertheless, legal processes are underway to resolve this issue, the coup \nleaders have been brought to justice, and the rule of law is firmly entrenched.  Fiji Islands has \nseen  an  upsurge  in  petty  crimes  over  the  past  few  years,  partly  as  a  result  of  the  poverty \nimpacts triggered by the political unrest. The extent of criminal activities, however, is much less \nthan in many DMCs.  In Sydney, there are no significant security concerns, and PLCO would be \nable  to  act  as  a  backstop  office  in  the  event  that  there  are  natural  disasters  or  political  crises \nthat demand evacuation from other Pacific offices.  \n \n\nVII. \n\nCOSTS \n\n \n26. \nThe  one-time  establishment  costs  of  the  Pacific  Subregional  Office  are  estimated  at \nabout  $517,500  (Appendix  2),  which  reflects  the  capital  expenditure  requirements  of \nestablishing  the  subregional  office.  The  first  full  year  of  operation  would  be  2005.  Associated \ncost reductions at headquarters and at South Pacific Regional Mission include (i) salaries and \nbenefits of professional staff to be redeployed to the subregional office, and (ii) savings on the \nbusiness travel costs of missions.  The impacts on ADB\u2019s internal administrative expenses for \n2004  and  2005  are  estimated  at  $215,155  and  $292,631  respectively.  The  benefits  packages \nfor staff assigned to the Pacific Subregional Office would follow standard ADB practice. \n \nThe  one-time  establishment  costs  of  the  PLCO  are  estimated  at  about  $363,000 \n27. \n(Appendix 3), which reflects the capital expenditure requirements of establishing PLCO. As for \nSuva,  cost  reductions  at  Headquarters  and  at  the  South  Pacific  Regional  Mission  include  (i) \nsalaries  and  benefits  of  professional  staff  to  be  redeployed  to  PLCO,  and  (ii)  savings  on  the \nbusiness  travel  costs  of  missions.  The  impacts  on  ADB\u2019s  internal  administrative  expenses  for \n2004  and  2005  are  estimated  at  $627,610  and  $614,481  respectively.  The  benefits  packages \nfor  staff  assigned  to  PLCO  would  follow  standard  ADB  practice;  much  lower  staff  allowance \ncosts are expected given that the duty station is in a developed country.   \n \n\nVIII.  BENEFITS \n\n \n\nThe key potential benefits of this multinodal approach to the location of ADB\u2019s offices in \n\n28. \nthe Pacific region may be summarized as follows: \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n(i)       Place a critical mass of ADB staff within a maximum of 1 day\u2019s travel time  from \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nevery PDMC, with most staff outside Headquarters located in PDMCs. \nBy  substantially  reducing  travel  and  transit  time,  free  up  significant  staff \nresources to perform more work in the PDMCs, especially in relation to KPS and \npolicy dialogue. \nStrengthen  ADB  operations  in  the  two  largest  regional  developing  economies \n(PNG and the Fiji Islands, which are also the two largest regional borrowers from \nADB). \nProvide a stronger field presence to extend ADB\u2019s policy advice and perspectives \nmore systematically throughout the region. \nCreate a strong ADB presence in two major regional travel hubs, leading to much \nmore regular contact with senior officials from the region. \nPosition  ADB  to  liaise,  deepen  operational  contacts,  and  improve  coordination \nwith  important  development  partners,  knowledge  providers,  and  the  private \nsector. \n\n(vii)  Allow  ADB  to  deliver  training  services  much  more  effectively  to  PDMC \n\nparticipants. \n\nIX. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nIt  is  recommended  that  the  Board  approve  the  establishment  of  the  proposed  Pacific \n29. \nSubregional  Office  in  Suva,  Fiji  Islands  and  the  Pacific  Liaison  and  Coordination  Office  in \nSydney, Australia in 2004, along the lines indicated in this paper. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1\n \n\n9\n\n \n\nCOMPARISON OF LOCATION OPTIONS FOR PACIFIC OFFICES \n \n\nEvaluation Process of Alternative Locations \n\nA. \n \nTo  establish  a  resident  mission  (RM)  in  all  13  Pacific  developing  member  countries \n1. \n(PDMCs) would approximately double the operating costs of the Pacific Department (PARD) of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and (assuming no corresponding increase in professional \nstaff)  leave  an  insufficient  number  of  core  staff  at  Headquarters  in  Manila  for  country \nprogramming  and  loan  processing.  Therefore,  some  amalgamation  of  staff  in  a  subregional \noffice or offices will be necessary for the foreseeable future.  Since 1994, the number of staff in \nADB's South Pacific Regional Mission (SPRM) located in Port Vila, Vanuatu has been gradually \nreduced due to Vanuatu's high cost and inconvenience as a travel hub.  As a subregional office, \nSPRM may be regarded as being suboptimal at present and is certainly considerably changed \nfrom its previous peak of 11 professional staff. Accordingly, a more suitable office arrangement \nis urgently required.  \n \nThe primary objective of establishing office(s) in the Pacific region is not to achieve the \n2. \nleast-cost  option.  Rather,  the  objective is to meet the demands of ADB\u2019s PDMC clients in the \nmost  cost-effective  and  efficient  manner  possible.  The  PDMCs,  over  the  past  years,  have \nclearly expressed the demand side of the equation. They value most from ADB its policy advice \nand guidance on how best to develop their economies. In effect, they see ADB as augmenting \ntheir  own  human  resources,  filling  in  gaps  in  staff  competencies  and  providing  independent, \nreliable  policy  guidance,  technical  assistance  and  a  wide  variety  of  knowledge  products  and \nservices  (KPS).  Compared  with  other  regional  departments  of  ADB,  PARD  provides  almost \nseven times the ADB average ratio of TA to loans, by amount (Table A1.1).  \n \n\nTable A1.1:  Relationship of Technical Assistance and Loans by Regional Department \n\nRegional Department \n\nRatio of TAs/Loans ($) \n\nRatio of TAs/Loans (no.) \n\n \n\nEast & Central Asia \nMekong \nSouth Asia  \nSoutheast Asia \nPacific \n\nADB Average  \n\n2.1% \n4.7% \n1.9% \n1.1% \n14.5% \n2.2% \n\n2.2 \n2.1 \n1.5 \n1.0 \n4.2 \n1.8 \n\n \n3. \nOf  course,  the  PDMCs  also  appreciate  that  these  TA  services  are  backed  up  by \naffordable  loan  financing.  However,  over  the  past  few  years  total  PDMC  borrowing  has  been \nonly  about  $100  million  per  year.  In  2002,  this  dropped  to  less  than  $50  million.8 From the \nsupply side, it would be  difficult  to  justify  running  a  department  that  costs  over  $8  million  per \nyear solely on the basis of this small lending operation. \n \n4. \nAs a quantitative measure of ADB\u2019s ability to deliver improved KPS to its PDMC clients, \nthe  number  of  increased  days  in  contact  with  senior  government  officials  is  seen  as  an \nappropriate  measure.9  Viewed  in  this  manner,  the  optimization  problem  becomes  \u201cWhich \n\n                                                 \n8   Papua New Guinea (PNG), with 5 million of the total PDMC population of 8 million, has been the largest borrower, \n\nso a separate RM has been approved for PNG to help manage this loan portfolio. \n\n9   On average, each PARD staff spends about 60 days per year in the field (excluding transit time), while there are \nusually  60-90  ADB-funded  consultants  (TA  and  staff  consultants)  in  the  field  at  any  time.    Accordingly,  PDMC   \nofficials are 10 times more likely to receive policy guidance from a consultant than from staff. \n\n\f10    Appendix 1  \n\nThe Alternatives \n\ncombination of locations offers the optimum amount of contact time at an acceptable cost?\u201d An \nacceptable cost is seen as involving no more than natural growth in the number of professional \nstaff  and  no  more  than  the  expected  5-10%  staff  cost  and  travel  cost  increases  in  2004  and \n2005, compared with the 2002 budget.10 The contact time differential among the various options \ncan also be expressed in imputed value terms by assuming that staff time is at least as valuable \nas that of ADB staff consultants.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nWith  13  PDMCs  and  two  nearby  developed  countries  (Australia  and  New  Zealand),  as \nwell  as  the  Headquarters  functions  in  Manila,  Philippines,  there  is  a  very  large  number  of \npossible  combinations  of  office  locations.  To  cover  the  range  of  possibilities,  six  options  were \nexamined in considerable detail, as shown in Table A1.2, with most emphasis on the first four (a \nconsolidation  in  Manila  and  rebuilding  SPRM  were  seen  as  at  opposite  ends  of  the  range  of \noptions).  Other  possibilities,  such  as  the  kind  offers  of  Samoa  and  Cook  Islands  to  host  a \nsubregional office of ADB, and the suggestion that Auckland may be suitable, given its role as a \ntravel hub, were also examined.  \n \n\nTable A1.2:  Alternative Scenarios \n \n\nScenario \n\nOffice Locations \n\nStaffing \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\nSuva (Pacific Subregional Office)  - \nClose SPRM \nSydney (Pacific Liaison and \nCoordination Office) - Close SPRM \nSuva Subregional Office + Sydney \nOffice \u2013 close SPRM \nSuva + Sydney Offices \u2013 Retain an RM \nor Liaison Office in Vanuatu \n\nClose SPRM \u2013 Manila Only \n\nUpgrade SPRM \n\n4 PS, 3 RS, and 6 new SS \n\n4 PS, 3 RS, and 5 new SS \n\n7 PS, 6 RS, and 11 new SS  \n\nAs for scenario 3, except that 1 \nPS, 2 RS, and 3 SS would be \nretained in Vanuatu \nRelocate 2 PS and 3 RS to \nHeadquarters \u2013 NS/SS redundant \nTransfer 2 additional PS from HQ, \nretain current SPRM staff \n\nHQ=Headquarters, NS=national staff, PS=professional staff, RS=regional staff, SS=support staff \n\n \n6. \nExamining  the  flight  connections  (see  Map),  distances,  and  travel  times,  Suva  would \nappear to be best-suited to servicing Tonga, Samoa, Tuvalu as well as the Fiji Islands. Sydney \nis a more convenient location for Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Nauru, Cook Islands, and possibly \nKiribati,  as  well  as  for  providing  a  backup  to  Papua  New  Guinea  and  Timor-Leste,  but  also \nprovides same-day flights to all the above countries. Manila remains the best location to service \nRepublic of Marshall Islands (RMI), Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), and Palau. As most \nPDMCs are tourist locations, per kilometer flight costs in the Pacific are often high (particularly \nfrom Vanuatu), and physical proximity may not be the best measure. Lack of competition in the \naviation  market  in  the  Pacific,  lack  of  cooperation  among  PDMCs  on  aviation  issues,  and  the \ndesire of each PDMC to have its own national airline also add to travel costs. Accordingly, the \n\n                                                 \n10   ADB-wide, the 2003 budget provides for a 7.8% increase over 2002.  In this paper, phased opening of the two new  \noffices in 2004 is assumed. All cost estimates are on an average of 3 months in 2004 for Suva (Pacific Subregional \nOffice),  a  full  year  in  2004  for  Sydney  (Pacific  Liaison  and  Coordination  Office),  and  a  full  year  in  2005  for  both \noffices, to ensure a true comparison.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1\n \n\n11\n\n \n\nultimate assignment of responsibility for specific PDMCs to a particular office would depend on \nvarious  operational  and  comparative  cost  factors  at  the  time.    Due  to  the  matrix  structure  of \nPARD staff, sector specialists assigned to a particular office may also work outside the nominal \nambit of that office. \n \nC. \n \n\nComparison \n\n1. \n\nSuva (Pacific Subregional Office) \u2013 Close SPRM \n\n \n7. \nThere are powerful arguments that apply to a Suva-based subregional office. In terms of \ncontact  time,  the  principal  difference  between  Suva  and  Sydney  would  be  that  many  PDMC \nofficials transit through Nadi, Fiji Islands but would rarely make a side trip to Suva.  Transit time \nsavings  from  Nadi  would  be  similar  to  Sydney,  but  one  must  add  the  transit  from  Suva  to  the \ninternational  airport  at  Nadi,  which  often  makes  same-day travel to other PDMCs impossible. \nHence the critical parameter of contact time would be less in Suva than in Sydney. \n \nThe  other  significant  differences  between  scenario  1  and  scenario  2,  apart  from  one \n8. \nbeing  in  a  PDMC  and  the  other  in  a  developed  country,  are  (i)  travel  schedules  are  not  very \nconvenient from Suva (most travel is through the international airport at Nadi, 3 hours away by \nroad, and flights are often late at night or very early in the morning,11 necessitating an overnight \nstay  in  Nadi);  (ii)  several  PDMCs  are  not  directly  accessible  from  the  Fiji  Islands  and  require \ntransit  through  Australia  or  New  Zealand;  (iii)  while  a  number  of  development  partners  are  in \nSuva,  there  is  no  cofinancing  institution  based  in  the  Fiji  Islands;  and  (iv)  communications  still \nneed  to  be  improved,  partly  due  to  monopoly  control  by  FINTEL  and  Telecom  Fiji  (see  Table \nA1.3).   \n \n\nTable A1.3: Suva Only \u2013 Close SPRM - Advantage and Disadvantages \n \n\nAdvantages \n\n\u2022 \n\nIncreased contact with PDMC officials -\n109 days \n\n\u2022  Proximity to several regional institutions \n\u2022  Lower average travel costs than from \n\nDisadvantages \n\u2022  Travel outside Fiji Islands incurs 3 hour \n\ntransit time from Suva to Nadi \n\n\u2022  Communications facilities poorer quality \n\nthan Sydney \n\n\u2022  Concerns of Vanuatu Government and \n\n\u2022  Redundancy and winding up costs from \n\nHQ or Vanuatu \n\nor Vanuatu \n\n\u2022  Reduced transit time compared with HQ \n\nSS about closing SPRM \n\n\u2022  Meets PDMC preference for office \n\nlocation in DMC  \n\n\u2022  Assists processing and administration \n\nclosing SPRM \n\n\u2022  Need to recruit 6 new SS \n \n\nof projects in Fiji Islands \n\nDMC=developing  member  country,  HQ=Headquarters,  PDMC=Pacific  developing  member  country, \nSPRM=South Pacific Regional Mission, SS=support staff \n\n \n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  two  of  the  three  current  SPRM  regional  staff  are  from  the  Fiji \n9. \nIslands  and  hence  would  revert  to  national  officer  status  if  relocated  there  (with  reduced \nbenefits).  If these current staff were relocated elsewhere, staff costs would be equal to those in \nSydney  (higher  benefits  in  the  Fiji  Islands  counterbalance  higher  salaries  in  Sydney,  thus \nmaking  little  difference  between  the  two  options  on  cost  grounds).

No  reduction  in  staff  consultants  is \nassumed, although increased staff contact with government officials should reduce the need for staff consultants. \nb The PARD share of HQ administrative cost  is regarded as a sunk cost.  Although relocation of PARD staff creates \nspace for new staff in other departments, no savings are attributed to PARD. \nc  The  Office  of  Information  Systems  and  Technology  (OIST)  planned  to  install  a  satellite  system  in  Vanuatu  for  an \nestimated additional cost of $192,000 per annum, but this has been deferred until a final decision on office locations. \nThe current cost of the leased line from SPRM ($110,000 per annum) is covered by OIST\u2019s budget, not PARD\u2019s. \n \n10. \nOn  an  incremental  cost  basis,  there  is  little  to  differentiate  between  Sydney  and  Suva.   \nCost  savings  of  about  1.1%  would  yield  an  increase  in  contact  time  of  about  5.4% (less \nthan Sydney due to the additional transit time through Nadi and fewer PDMC officials traveling \nto Suva).  \n \n\n  \n                 Total \n\n2. \n\nSydney (Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office) \u2013 Close SPRM \n\n \n11. \nCompared  with  the  status  quo,  there  are  arguments  in  favor  of  closing  SPRM  and \nrelocating the professional and regional staff to Sydney. SPRM currently costs $1.7 million per \nyear (about 20% of PARD\u2019s budget).12 Moreover, while a pleasant place to work, it is not a cost-\neffective regional location. As most items are imported, largely from Australia, and there are few \neconomies  of  scale,  Vanuatu  is  a  very  high-cost  location  for  international  business.  It  is  not \nconveniently  located  in  respect  of  most  PDMCs.  and  staff  must  transit  through  the  Fiji  Islands \n(Nadi)  or  Australia    (Sydney  or  Brisbane).

The current cost of the leased line ($110,000 per annum) is covered \nby the OIST budget, not PARD\u2019s. \n\n \n14. \nThe  major  cost  saving  is  from  reduced  business  travel  costs  due  to  operating  out  of  a \nmajor travel hub. This is offset by increased communication costs (based on satellite connection \nto  Headquarters)  and  higher  office  operating  costs.  It  should  be  noted  that  (i)  this \ncommunication cost would need to be incurred in Vanuatu in 2003 if SPRM were to be retained; \n(ii)  the  technology  chosen  is  likely  to  be  replaced  by  cheaper alternatives (such as Demand \nAssigned  Multiple  Access,  which  splits  bandwidth  across  several  offices15);  and  (iii) \nvideoconferencing  facilities  would  further  reduce  the  need  for  business  travel  and  improve \ncommunication  with  Headquarters.    The  additional  cost  for  communication  would  be  about \n$100,000  over \n(allowing \nteleconferencing, for example). \n \n15. \nStaff costs are essentially budget neutral due to lower benefits paid  to professional and \nregional  staff  in  a  more  secure  location  than  Vanuatu  (where  24-hour  security  has  to  be \nprovided  for  residences,  and  staff  are  given  substantial  cost  of  living  and  hardship  benefits). \nThere  are  also  expected  to  be  some  efficiency  gains  from  Australian-based  support  staff, \ndespite  the  need  to  recruit  new  staff,  due  to  external  efficiencies  in  the  Australian  business \nenvironment.

This  would  provide  a  comparative  advantage  over  the  World  Bank \narrangement with only one Pacific regional office, in Sydney.  By ensuring that staff are located \nclosest to the countries that they are responsible for, there would be considerable reduction in \nlargely  wasted  transit  time.    Locating  the  majority  of  staff  who  are  stationed  outside \nHeadquarters in PDMCs also accommodates PDMC preferences.   \n \n\nTable A1.7: Sydney + Suva - Close SPRM  - Advantages and Disadvantages \n \n\nDisadvantages \n\u2022  Concern of Vanuatu Government and \n\nSS on closing SPRM \n\n\u2022  Redundancy and new hire of SS \n\u2022  Splits professional staff between two \n\nlocations \n\n \n\nAdvantages \n\n\u2022 \n\nIncreases contact with PDMC officials \nand others \u2013 292 days \n\n\u2022  Optimizes frequent contact with major \ndevelopment partners in the region \n\n\u2022  Partly meets PDMC preferences \n\u2022  Capitalizes on main Pacific travel hubs \n\u2022  Capitalizes on academic, private sector, \n\nand NGO contacts in Sydney \n\n\u2022  Possible hub and spoke communication \n\nsystem  \n\n\u2022  Lowest combination of travel costs \n\u2022  Assists processing and administration \nof new projects in Fiji Islands, as the \nportfolio grows over 2003-2005  \n\n\u2022  Back up to HQ missions and in case of \nevacuation from one or more offices \n\nHQ=Headquarters,  NGO=nongovernmental  organizations,  PDMC=Pacific  developing  member  country, \nSPRM=South Pacific Regional Mission, SS=support staff \n\n \n\n\f16    Appendix 1  \n\nFrom a  service  delivery  perspective,  phased  opening  of  the  two  new  offices  in  2004  is \n18. \nproposed.

Once  fully  operational, \naverage staff costs would be only about 5.3% higher than the status quo, despite having almost \none  third  of  PARD  professional  staff  in  the  field.  This  increase  in  staff  costs  also  reflects  the \naddition of 3 regional staff and 11 new support staff (including redundancy payments for SPRM \nsupport  staff).  The  cost  of  additional  regional  and  support  staff  employed,  together  with \nrelocation costs , could be by and large offset by the potential reduction in staff travel costs from \nHeadquarters and SPRM.  Several regional airlines (such as Virgin Blue) have indicated interest \nin servicing tourism destinations such as the Fiji Islands, and both competition and the number \nof  international  flights  out  of  Suva  (instead  of  Nadi)  can  be  expected  to  increase  by  2005.  To \nsummarize,  the  phased  introduction  of  complementary  offices  in  Sydney  and  Suva \nduring 2004 can be achieved within limited budget impact to achieve a 14.6% increase in \ncontact time. \n \n\n                                                 \n16  The pipeline of 16 projects for the period 2003-2005, totals $191 million. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n4. \n\nSuva  +  Sydney  Offices  +  Retain  a  Resident  Mission  or  Liaison  Office  in \nVanuatu \n\n \n21. \nADB has had an office in Vanuatu for the past 15 years. At one stage there were up to \n11  professional  staff  operating  from  that  office,  with  only  a  liaison  officer  for  the South Pacific \nbased  in  Manila.17  There  would  be  considerable  political  sensitivity  to  closing  the  office  at  this \nstage,  in  much  the  same  way  as  ADB  could  be  criticized  by  many  observers  if  it  moved \nHeadquarters  from  Manila  due  to  its  inconvenience  as  a  travel  hub  and  increasing  security \nissues. Merely shifting the office from Port Vila to Suva would not provide an additional office in \na PDMC, as requested by PDMC governments. \n \n22. \nThe  main  advantages  of  this  option  over  Scenario  3  are  (i)  the  reduced  political \nconsequences of closing a long-established office; (ii) the continued close contact of ADB staff \nwith  the  Vanuatu  Government  at  a  time  of  real  fiscal  crisis;  (iii)  continued  close  supervision  of \nongoing loan projects in Vanuatu, especially those that require travel to the outer islands; and \n(iv)  reduced  impact  on  loyal  and  experienced  local  ADB  support  staff  (see  Table  A1.9).  \nNevertheless, it is recognized that further review of the rationale for retaining Port Vila as an RM \nor liaison office would be needed once both offices in Suva and Sydney were fully functioning. \n \n\nTable A1.9:  Sydney + Suva + Vanuatu Office  - Advantages and Disadvantages \n \n\nAdvantages \n\n\u2022  Maximizes contact time with PDMC \n\nofficials \u2013 364 days \n\u2022  Acceptable to PDMCs \n\u2022  Accesses maximum range of \n\nstakeholders and knowledge providers \n\u2022  Liaison with AusAID, NZAID, and other \n\nregional organizations \n\n\u2022  Back  up  to  HQ  missions  and  in  case  of \nevacuation from one or more offices \n\nDisadvantages \n\u2022  Some additional costs, balanced by \nimputed value of increased contact \nand reduced transit time \n\n\u2022  Some redundancy and downsizing \n\ncosts for Vanuatu \n\nAusAID=Australian Agency for International Development, HQ=Headquarters, NZAID=New Zealand Agency \nfor International Development, PDMC=Pacific developing member country \n\n \n23. \nImportantly, of all scenarios examined, this option maximizes the amount of contact time \nwith government officials, thus increasing ADB\u2019s ability to meet PDMC demands for its KPS and \npolicy advice.  \n \n24. \nThis scenario examined the cost and other implications of retaining, for the time being, a \nsmall office in Port Vila, Vanuatu. The incremental operational costs over the Sydney and Suva \ncombination are not great (about  4.8%  of  current  costs)  and  would  mainly  reflect  some  short-\nterm staff cost increases and travel cost increases (Table A1.10). Administrative costs may also \nincrease depending on the merits of upgrading the communication system in Port Vila, for what \nmay be a temporary arrangement, and the technological options available. It is also likely that \nsome office space savings could be achieved by moving into a smaller office building (although \nthis  is  not  yet  factored  into  the  calculation).  On  balance,  it  should  be possible to keep the \nincremental costs below 12%, for the maximum increase in contact time (18.2%).  \n \n\n                                                 \n17  The North Pacific was covered by staff based in Manila. \n\n\f18    Appendix 1  \n\nTable A1.10: Sydney + Suva + Vanuatu Office \u2013 Costs \n \n\nCost Item \n\nOperational Costs \n    Staff Costs \n    Consultants and Business Travel \n    Overtime \n    Training \n\n \n\nAdministrative Costs \n    Office Space \n    Communication \n    Office Supplies & Others \n    Depreciation/Amortization \n \n\nTotal \n\nIncrement \n$ \n344,627 \n535,625 \n(202,248) \n- \n11,250 \n \n530,312 \n148,080 \n184,880 \n60,065 \n137,288 \n \n874,939 \n\nIncrease/Decrease \n% \n4.76 \n10.16 \n(10.36) \n- \n\n112.50 \n\n \n\n142.13 \n136.86 \n78.36 \n207.12 \n\n- \n \n\n11.48 \n\n \n\n5. \n\nConsolidation at Headquarters \n\n \nOver the years, SPRM has been progressively downsized to its current position of two \n25. \nprofessional  staff,  with  other  field  staff  returned  to  Headquarters.  This  option  examines  the \nimplications of continuing this trend. \n \nThis  strategy  would  be  counter  to  the  intent  of  the  Resident  Mission  Policy  and  the \n26. \nrecent  review  of  the  RMs,18  and  would  not  satisfy  PDMC  preferences  for  an  increased  ADB \npresence in PDMCs. Considerably more time would be lost in transit, and there would be even \nless contact with PDMC officials than at present. While this could be compensated for to some \nextent  by  increasing  the  employment  of  staff  consultants,  this  would  not  meet  the  overall \nobjective  of  ensuring  that  ADB  staff  increases  the  amount  of  contact  time  with  PDMC  senior \nofficials to offer policy advice and other KPS (see Table A1.11). \n \n\nTable A1.11: Headquarters Only  - Advantages and Disadvantages \n \n\nAdvantages \n\nDisadvantages \n\n\u2022  Eliminates high cost of SPRM \n\u2022  Increases critical mass of staff at \n\nHQ \n\n\u2022  Reduces staff contact with PDMC officials, \nespecially in Vanuatu \u2013 70 days less \n\n\u2022  Concern of Vanuatu Government and SS on \n\n\u2022  Ensures all staff linked into HQ \n\nclosing SPRM \n\nactivities (e.g., KPS) \n\n\u2022  Centralizes project administration \n\n\u2022  Redundancy and new hire of SS \n\u2022  Increased cost of travel \n\u2022  Increased time in transit \n\u2022  Not in same time zone as most PDMCs \n\nHQ=Headquarters,  KPS=knowledge  products  and  services,  PDMC=Pacific  developing  member  country, \nSPRM=South Pacific Regional Mission, SS=support staff \n \n27. \nThere  would  be  some  cost  savings  (Table  A1.12)  by  closing  SPRM  and  relocating \nprofessional  staff  and  regional  staff  to  Headquarters.

However,  the  travel  difficulties  from  Port  Vila  and  the  lack  of  officials \ntransiting  through  Vanuatu  would  make  any  change  in  this  measure  very  marginal  (see  Table \nA1.13). \n \n\nTable A1.13: Upgrade Vanuatu \u2013 Advantages and Disadvantages \n \n\nAdvantages \n\nDisadvantages \n\n\u2022 \n\nIncreases contact with PDMC \nofficials, especially in Vanuatu \u2013 \n24 days \n\n\u2022  Meets PDMC preference of \nregional office in a PDMC  \n\n\u2022  Builds on project administration \n\nexperience in SPRM \n\n\u2022  Increased operational costs of SPRM \n\u2022  Poor communications \n\u2022  Average mission cost increases  \n\u2022  Excessive time in transit \n\u2022  Has been tried before (up to 11 professional \n\nstaff) \n\n\u2022  Office capacity may need to be expanded \n\u2022  Increased security costs, hardship allowance, \n\nand other staff costs related to location \n\nPDMC=Pacific developing member country, SPRM=South Pacific Regional Mission \n \nStaff  costs  would  rise  significantly  (reflecting  higher  benefits  paid  to  staff  relocated  to \n30. \nPort Vila), and there is relatively little travel cost difference between Port Vila and Manila origins \n(Table  A1.14).  The  main  additional  administrative  cost  would  be  the  need  to  upgrade  the \n\n\f20    Appendix 1  \n\ncommunication link from leased line to satellite, to facilitate videoconferencing.  Any decision to \nlocate  even  larger  numbers  of  professional  staff  to  Vanuatu  would  considerably  increase  the \ncosts,  as  additional  support  staff  and/or  regional  staff  would  need  to  be  recruited.  The  cost  of \nmaintaining a professional staff in Port Vila is approximately 25% higher than in Manila, due to \nhardship  allowance,  security  services,  free  housing,  etc.  Hence,  there  is  little  justification  for \nreversing the recent decisions to downsize SPRM. \n\n \n\nTable A1.14: Upgrade Vanuatu \u2013 Costs \n \n\nCost Item \n\nOperational Costs \n    Staff Costs \n    Consultants and Business Travel \n    Overtime \n    Training \n\nIncrease/Decrease \n% \n0.59 \n2.16 \n(7.86) \n(22.90) \n\n            - \n\nIncrement \n($) \n(42,811) \n113,617 \n(153,428) \n(3,000) \n- \n \n81,639 \n- \n77,389 \n4,250 \n- \n \n38,828 \n\n \n\n \nAdministrative Costs \n   Office Space \n   Communicationa \n   Office Supplies & Others \n   Depreciation/Amortization \n  \n                 Total \na    An allowance is made for upgrading the communication system to satellite transmission, which \nwould  be  needed  if  SPRM  were  to  be  retained  as  the  main  subregional  office  (estimated \nincremental cost of $82,000 per annum, compared with current leased line cost of $110,000). \n\n21.88 \n- \n32.80 \n14.66 \n- \n \n0.51 \n\nSummary \n\n \nD. \n \n31. \nIf  cost  were  the  only  criterion,  closing  SPRM  and  returning  to  a  Headquarters-only \noperation  would  be  the  cheapest  option.  Given  the  undesirability  of  this  option,  opening one \nsubregional  office  in  either  Suva  or  Sydney  and  closing  SPRM  would  be  the  next  cheapest \noption. However, without any significant increase in the current PARD budget, ADB can avail of \nthe considerable complementary advantages of both locations \u2014Suva and Sydney. In addition, \nthis  combination  would  deliver  the  equivalent  of  almost  300  days  additional  contact  time  with \nPDMC officials, compared with 100 in Suva alone and almost 200 in Sydney alone. As PARD \nstaff  currently  spend  about  60  days  per  year  on  average  in  contact  with  PDMC  officials,  this \nwould  be  equivalent  to  increasing  the  contact  time  of  current  staff  by  about  20%  (see  Table \nA1.15). To reflect the monetary value of the increased or reduced contact time associated with \neach  option,  an  imputed  value  that  equates  an  additional  contact  day  by  ADB  staff  to  at  least \nthe average cost of a staff consultant (at $500 per day) can be included in the analysis. At this \nrelatively low imputed value, the actual costs of various options may be adjusted downwards by \n2-3%,  with  the  marginal  difference  increasing  as  the  number  of  contact  days  increases. \nFurthermore, this combination of complementary offices in Suva and Sydney would enable all of \nthe PARD\u2019s offices to improve communications with Headquarters (and staff on mission in other \nPDMCs)  through  a  hub  and  spoke  satellite  system,  using  Demand  Assigned  Multiple  Access. \nAccordingly, there would be corresponding reductions in the administrative costs of the Special \nOffice in Timor-Leste and the RM in Papua New Guinea, plus back-up facilities in case of the \nneed for evacuation. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1\n \n\n21\n\n \n\nTable A1.15:  Comparison of Options (without imputed value of contact time) \n\n \n\n \n\nIncremental cost compared with  \n2002 expenses \n \n\nIncrease/ \nDecrease in \n2004-2005 \n(%) \n\nIncrease/ \nDecrease in \nContact Daysa \n(days) (%) \n\nScenario 1 \nScenario 2 \nScenario 3 \nScenario 4 \nScenario 5 \nScenario 6 \n\nSuva Only \nSydney Only \nSUV+SYD \nSUV+SYD+VAN \nHQ Only \nVAN Upgrade \n\n-1.1 \n-0.2 \n5.7 \n11.5 \n-5.1 \n0.5 \n\n     109 ( 5.4%) \n     194 ( 9.7%) \n     292 (14.6%) \n     364 (18.2%) \n      -70 ( -3.5%) \n       24 ( 1.2%) \n\nHQ=Headquarters,  SUV=Pacific  Subregional  Office,  SYD=Pacific  Liaison  and \nCoordination Office, VAN=Vanuatu Resident Mission \na  Baseline is assumed to be 2,000 days per year, based on the 2001 actual travel \npattern.  This is equivalent to 200 missions, with at least 400 transit days (allowing \nthat some missions are back-to-back to avoid excessive downtime). \n\n \n32. \nFinally, for a small additional cost, a scaled-down RM or liaison office could be retained \nin  Vanuatu,  without  exceeding  ADB-wide  budget  constraints.  Such  a  decision  (even  if  only \ntemporary) would (i) be politically sound, (ii) ensure continuity of project administration expertise \nuntil the subregional offices are fully operational, and (iii) initially assist the Vanuatu Government \nas it attempts to cope with a severe fiscal crisis. In addition, of all the options considered, this \nscenario  would  maximize  the  amount  of  contact  days  with  senior  government  officials \n(estimated at about 18.2%). \n \n33. \nIn summary, to best meet the objectives set out in para. 2, a combination of Suva and \nSydney  offices,  plus  downscaling  SPRM  to  a  Vanuatu  RM  or  liaison  office  (at  least  until  both \nSuva  and  Sydney  are  fully  operational  in  2005)  is  supported  by  the  above  analysis.  A  serious \nreview  of  the  continued  viability  of  the  scaled-down  Vanuatu  office  would  be  carried  out  once \nboth the Suva and Sydney offices are fully functional. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n    \n\n \n\n22\n\n \n\nORGANIZATION, STRUCTURE, AND COST OF PACIFIC SUBREGIONAL OFFICE \n\u2013 SUVA, FIJI ISLANDS \n \n\ntechnology,  access \n\nthree  professional  staff \n\n(the  country  director  and \n\nIn accordance with its normal practice, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) would enter \n1. \ninto a host country agreement (HCA) with the Government of the Republic of the Fiji Islands to \nensure  that  recognition  of  ADB  status  and  relevant  privileges  and  immunities  are  provided  for \nADB,  its  operations,  and  staff.  The  HCA  negotiations  will  be  finalized  prior  to  opening  the \nsubregional office. \n \n2. \nThe number of staff at the Suva subregional office would reflect the workload anticipated \nin 2004 and beyond. The Suva subregional office is to be established initially on a modest scale, \ntwo  programs  or  projects \nwith \nofficers/economists),  redeployed  from  ADB  Headquarters.  Other  staff  would  consist  of  three \nregional  officers  (one  for  finance  and  administration  and  two  for  project  administration  and \nregional economic work) and six nationally recruited administrative staff.   \n \n3. \nTo ensure efficient operations and rapid response capability, the Suva subregional office \nmust  have  the  same  access  to  data  and  information  as  Headquarters  staff.  Investments  in \ninformation \nto  computer  systems  at  Headquarters,  and  good \ncommunications systems, including videoconferencing facilities, would be necessary to achieve \nthe  benefits  expected  from  the  subregional  office.  Advanced  information  technology  and \ntelecommunications  facilities  are  necessary  tools  to  make  the  subregional  office  a  real \nextension  of  ADB  and  integrate  the  subregional  office  into  Headquarters  functions.    It  is \nexpected  that  using  Sydney  as  a  communication  hub,  as  part  of  a  hub  and  spoke  satellite \nsystem,  would  facilitate  improved  communication,  and  further  investigation  of  this  option  is \nongoing. \n \nThe  Suva  subregional  office  would  be  under  the  overall  supervision  of  the  Director \n4. \nGeneral,  PARD.  To  take  full  advantage  of  ADB\u2019s  presence  within  the  Pacific  region  and \nproximity  to  Pacific  developing  member  countries,  the  subregional  office  must  be  able  to \nrespond  quickly  and  decisively.  The  benefits  of  establishing  the  subregional  office  must  be \nmatched  by  adequate  prudential  oversight  to  maintain  the  transparency  and  integrity  of  ADB \noperations.  Appropriate  fiduciary  controls  and  the  application  of  ADB\u2019s  current  procedures  for \nprocurement  of goods and services would be ensured. Disbursement functions would only be \ndelegated  to  the  subregional  office  subject  to  detailed  guidelines  issued  by  ADB\u2019s  Controller. \nInternal control mechanisms would be put in place to prevent any misuse or abuse of delegated \nauthority,  along  with  appropriate  audit  functions.  Operational  guidelines  would  be  prepared  to \nfacilitate the matrix staffing arrangement, which would permit sector specialists from one office \nto work in countries under the nominal control of another office. \n \n5. \nThe  estimated  costs  of  the  proposed  Suva  subregional  office  and  its  associated \nbudgetary impact for 2004 and 2005 are detailed below.  The one-time establishment costs of \nthe subregional office are estimated at about $517,500 (Table A2.1), which reflects the capital \nexpenditure  requirements  of  establishing  the  subregional  office.  The  first  full  year  of  operation \nwould  be  2005.  Table  A2.2  shows  the  costs  for  operating  an  office  in  Suva,  and  Table  A2.3 \nshows incremental internal administrative expenses.  Cost reduction at Headquarters and at the \nSouth  Pacific  Regional  Mission  includes  (i)  salaries  and  benefits  of  professional  staff  to  be \nredeployed to the subregional office, and (ii) savings on the business travel costs of missions.  \nThe  impacts  on  ADB\u2019s  internal  administrative  expenses  for  2004  and  2005  are  estimated  at \n\n\f$215,155  and  $292,631,  respectively.  The  benefits  packages  for  staff  assigned  to  the  Suva \nsubregional office would follow standard ADB practice. \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n23\n\nTable A2.1: One-Time Establishment Cost  \n($) \n\nItem \nFitting-Out Works a \nFurniture and Office Equipment  b \nVehicles \nProject Management \nContingencies \n \n \na Includes office partitioning, electrical work, etc. \nb Includes computers and telecommunications facilities. \n\nTotal \n\nCost \n\n118,000 \n279,500 \n  55,000 \n  40,000 \n  25,000 \n \n517,500 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A2.2: Costs of Operating the Pacific Subregional Office - Suva \n($) \n\nCost Element \n\n1.

The  HCA  negotiations  would  be  finalized  prior  to  opening  the  Pacific \nLiaison and Coordination Office (PLCO). \n \n2. \nThe  number  of  staff  at  PLCO  would  reflect  its  workload.  The  Sydney  office  would  be \nestablished  on  a  modest  scale,  with  four  professional  staff  (the  country  director  and  three \nproject  specialists/economists),  mainly  redeployed  from  ADB  headquarters.  Other  staff  would \nconsist  of  three  regional  officers  (one  for  finance  and  administration  and  two  for  project \nadministration and regional economic work) and five support staff.  To the extent possible, staff \nwould be drawn from the Pacific region.  \n \nTo ensure efficient operations and rapid response capability, PLCO must have the same \n3. \naccess  to  data  and  information  as  Headquarters  staff.  Investments  in  information  technology, \naccess  to  computer  systems  at  Headquarters,  and  good  communications  systems,  including \nvideoconferencing  facilities,  would  be  necessary  to  achieve  the  benefits  expected  from  the \noffice.  Advanced  information  technology  and  telecommunications  facilities  are  necessary tools \nto make PLCO a real extension of ADB and integrate the office into Headquarters functions. \n \n4. \nDespite  having  significant  representative  office  functions,  PLCO  would  be  under  the \noverall  supervision  of  the  director  general,  PARD.  To  take  full  advantage of ADB\u2019s presence \nwithin the Pacific region and proximity to Pacific developing member countries, PLCO must be \nable  to  respond  quickly  and  decisively.  The  benefits  of  establishing  a  Sydney  office  must  be \nmatched  by  adequate  prudential  oversight  to  maintain  the  transparency  and  integrity  of  ADB \noperations.  Appropriate  fiduciary  controls  and  the  application  of  ADB\u2019s  current  procedures  for \nprocurement  of  goods  and  services  would  be  ensured.  Disbursement  functions  would  only  be \ndelegated  to  PLCO  subject  to  detailed  guidelines  issued  by  ADB\u2019s  Controller.  Internal  control \nmechanisms would be put in place to prevent any misuse or abuse of delegated authority, along \nwith appropriate audit functions.  \n \n5. \nThe estimated costs of the proposed Sydney-based PLCO and its associated budgetary \nimpact for 2004 and 2005 are detailed below. The one-time establishment costs of the office are \nestimated at about $363,000 (Table A3.1), which reflects the capital expenditure requirements \nof establishing PLCO. Table A3.2 shows the costs for operating an office in Sydney, and Table \nA3.3 shows incremental internal administrative expenses.  Cost reduction at Headquarters and \nat the South Pacific Regional Mission includes (i) salaries and benefits of professional staff to be \nredeployed to PLCO, and (ii) savings on the business travel costs of missions. The impacts on \nADB\u2019s  internal  administrative  expenses  for  2004  and  2005  are  estimated  at  $627,610  and \n$614,481, respectively. The benefits packages for staff assigned to PLCO would follow standard \nADB practice; much lower staff allowance costs are expected, given that the duty station is in a \ndeveloped country.   \n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n25\n\nTable A3.1: One-Time Establishment Cost  \n($) \n\nCost \n\nItem \nFitting-Out Works a \nFurniture  \nOffice Equipment b \nVehicles \nProject Management \nContingencies \n \n \na  Includes office partitioning, electrical work, etc. \nb  Includes computers and telecommunications facilities. \n\n  35,000 \n100,000 \n146,000 \n  25,000 \n  40,000 \n  17,000 \n \n363,000 \n\nTotal \n\nTable A3.2: Costs of Operating the Sydney Office \n($) \n\n \n\n \n\nCost Element \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n1.
