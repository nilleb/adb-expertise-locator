INTRODUCTION \n1.  The 13 Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) have a total population of about 8 million people. They comprise thousands of small \nislands scattered over an area almost as great as the land area of all ADB\u2019s other developing \nmember countries (DMCs) combined. The PDMCs constitute almost one third of ADB\u2019s DMCs.  \n \n2.  These basic facts directly shape both the content and the delivery of ADB\u2019s operational \nservices in the Pacific region. While ADB\u2019s new lending commitments have averaged about \n$100  million  per  year  recently,1  our  analytical  and  policy-related  work  are  an  especially \nimportant operational instrument.  Indeed, the ratio of technical assistance (TA) to lending \nvolume in the PDMCs is seven times higher than the ADB average (Appendix 1).  This presents \nunique demands, but also unique opportunities, with respect to program formulation, design, \nand supervision. \n  \n3.  In September 2000, ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved an ambitious new strategy \ndesigned to better focus ADB\u2019s analytical  and operational work on the core development \nchallenges in the Pacific region. The Pacific Strategy for the New Millennium2 emphasized the \nneed for deeper ADB engagement in several critical areas\u2014through our operational work; by \nbuilding stronger partnerships across the community of development partners; and by tapping \nmore effectively into the insights and resources of a wider range of partners, including the \nprivate sector.   \n \n4.  ADB has also taken a number of important steps over the past year to better organize \nand  align  its  operations  with  the  evolving  needs  of  the  PDMCs  and  with  these  strategic \ncommitments.    In  January  2002,  the  Office  of  Pacific  Operations  was  upgraded  to  full \ndepartment status while maintaining its basic structure along preexisting lines.  With a full \nintegration of \u201cprogram\u201d and \u201cproject\u201d functions, Pacific Department (PARD) staff generally work \nin a matrix fashion, with flexibility in country assignments, and combining skills in programming, \nprocessing, and administration.  \n \n5.   As an extension of these efforts, ADB has done a comprehensive analysis of options \nwith respect to the physical location of PARD staff and, specifically, the merits of additional ADB \noffices in the Pacific region (see Appendix 1).  The core  objective in this work has been to \nidentify whether and how an expanded field presence could significantly strengthen our capacity \nto  deliver  additional,  high-quality  services  to  the  PDMCs.    Over  the  past  year  we  have \nconducted extensive consultations with the full range of ADB members, including extensive \ndirect consultations in the PDMCs by senior ADB officials.  In addition, we have benefited from \ndirect feedback from the Executive Board, both through a full discussion in October 2002 of a \nworking paper on possible options, as well as in a subsequent informal seminar on a revised \napproach.  All of this work has been extremely helpful in weighing alternatives, identifying and \ndiscussing issues of concern, and setting out the full range of views.   \n \n6.  The purpose of this paper is to report to the Board on the results of this analysis and \nconsultation,  and  to  present  a  revised  proposal,  summarized  below,  that  we  believe  is \nresponsive to the various issues and concerns that have been raised. \n                                                 \n1   As at 31 December 2002, there were 33 loans worth $495 million under implementation.  \n2  ADB. 2000. Pacific Strategy for the New Millennium. Manila. ", "2 \n \n \nBox 1: Proposed Approach \n \n\u2022  A Pacific Subregional Office will be opened in Suva, Fiji Islands in 2004; this office would \nhave the mandate to perform the full range of Resident Mission functions and would anchor \nour regional presence. \n \n\u2022  A Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office will be opened in Sydney, Australia, also in 2004; \nthis office would be a hybrid, performing both operational and coordination work. \n \n\u2022  The current office will be maintained in Port Vila, Vanuatu, with a review after both the \nSydney and Suva offices are fully functional. \n \n \n7.  Section  II  briefly  summarizes  relevant  elements  of  ADB\u2019s  Resident  Mission  Policy. \nSection III identifies the key criteria against which alternatives were assessed, and summarizes \nkey findings of the assessment.  Section IV presents a prospective division of functions and \nresponsibilities between ADB headquarters and offices in the Pacific.  Section V briefly outlines \nthe proposed organization and structure of the proposed offices.  Section VI highlights the \nsecurity considerations. Section VII outlines the incremental costs of the preferred option. \nSection  VIII  discusses  the  expected  benefits  of  the  approach  outlined  above.  Section  IX \npresents  the  recommendations.  Appendix  1  outlines  the  detailed  analysis  of  six  optional \nlocations. Appendix 2 presents the expected organization and structure of the proposed Suva \noffice, with an estimate of costs. Appendix 3 presents the expected organization and structure of \nthe  proposed  Sydney  office  and  summarizes  the  anticipated  costs  and  implementation \nschedule. \n \nII.  ADB\u2019S RESIDENT MISSION POLICY \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s  Resident  Mission  Policy  states  that  a  resident  mission  (RM)  should  be \nestablished \u201cin each borrowing developing member country where it is practicable to establish \nit.\u201d  However, the policy also explicitly recognizes the special circumstances of the PDMCs and \nthe need for a pragmatic approach to dealing effectively with those circumstances.  In particular, \nthe policy contemplates that individual PDMCs could be served effectively and appropriately \nthrough offices not physically located in the country where services are being delivered.  The \nagreed upon policy thus builds in a degree of flexibility in light of the unique circumstances and \nchallenges of the Pacific region.  The policy recognizes that resident missions, while primarily \noperational, also have significant representation functions. \n \nIII.  RATIONALE AND JUSTIFICATION  \n \n9.  Against the background of both the flexibility of the Resident Mission Policy, and the \nmultiple  objectives  that  an  effective  field  presence  would  need  to  serve,  a  limited  set  of \nevaluation criteria were established.  The core objective was to arrive at a set of proposals that \nwill position ADB to deliver the fullest and best possible service to the PDMCs within a very \nconstrained resource envelope.  \n ", "  3\n \nBox 2: Evaluation Criteria \n \n\u2022  Position ADB to deliver superior KPS to its PDMCs, backed by financial \nresources.  \n \n\u2022  Increase the frequency of contact between ADB and PDMC officials, and \nthe frequency of ADB participation in PDMC events. \n \n\u2022  Optimize staff resources available for on-site operational work by reducing \nthe current high proportion of mission time spent in transit. \n \n\u2022  Increase ADB access to, and contact with, a greater range of key Pacific \nregion development partners from both the public and private sectors.  \n \n\u2022  Ensure cost effectiveness. \n \n \n10.  Of six possible alternative combinations assessed against the criteria in Box 2, two \nemerged as the dominant options for cost-effective offices: Suva, Fiji Islands and Sydney, \nAustralia (Appendix 1).3 Both offer attractive and, in many respects, complementary, features.  A \ncareful assessment of the attributes and costs of each led to the conclusion that a presence in \nboth locations, commencing in 2004, and combined with an ongoing anchor function in Manila \nand a full RM in PNG4, would offer maximum benefits. ADB\u2019s current field presence in Vanuatu \nand in Timor-Leste would be reviewed once the Suva and Sydney offices are fully functional. \n \nA.  Suva, Fiji Islands \n \n11.  Operational Travel Issues. With respect to operational travel, the Fiji Islands offers \nadvantages that exceed those of any other PDMC location.  The Fiji Islands is served by eight \ninternational airlines. On average, there are three flights per week from Nadi to other PDMCs, \nwith travel time of less than 1 day.5  Over the next few years, the Fiji Islands is expected to \nincrease in importance as a travel hub for the Pacific, including through prospective upgrades of \ninternational air service direct to the Suva area. \n \n12.  Direct Contact with PDMC Officials. The international airport at Nadi is a regional hub \nthrough which PDMC officials often transit. The Fiji Islands hosts numerous conferences and \nworkshops.  Hence, many PDMC working level officials have opportunities to travel to the Fiji \nIslands, and about 20 senior officials could be expected to visit an ADB office in Suva each \nyear. \n \n                                                 \n3  Several PDMCs have kindly offered to host ADB offices (including Samoa, Fiji Islands, and Cook Islands).  These \noffers are greatly appreciated and each was carefully examined, particularly in terms of travel connections and \nproximity to other development partners. Office costs are a relatively minor component of PARD\u2019s cost structure. \n4  The PNG Resident Mission (RM) has been approved and will be established in 2003. \n5  The convenience of this transport hub is limited to some extent by the need to travel from Suva to Nadi for most  \ninternational trips \u2013 a 3 hour trip by car or a domestic flight connection from Suva\u2019s Nausori airport.  Many of the \nflights to and from Nadi arrive or depart late at night, often necessitating transit accommodation in Nadi. ", "4 \n13.  Deepening Partnerships.  The Fiji Islands is the regional location for several United \nNations and Pacific Island Forum agencies,6 as well as the European Union. It is also the \nlocation of the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre, for which ADB is a cofinancier.  \nDevelopment  funding  sources  with  offices  in  Suva  include  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development, Peoples\u2019 Republic of China, Japan, and New Zealand Agency for \nInternational Development.  The University of the South Pacific, based in Suva, has a well-\ndeveloped distance education capacity for PDMCs. \n \n14.  Information  and  Communication  Technology.  Although  current  communication \nfacilities have limitations and are relatively costly, the Fiji Islands is expected to build up its \ninformation and communication technology capacity to international standards in the medium \nterm, and ADB is assisting in this effort. \n \nB.  Sydney, Australia \n15.  Operational  Travel  Issues.  Sydney  has  major  advantages  in  terms  of  travel \naccessibility and interaction with ADB\u2019s stakeholders and development partners in the Pacific.  \nSydney is served by 44 international airlines providing 960 flights per week. On average there \nare 7.2 flights per week from Sydney to each PDMC, with travel time of less than 1 day. Sydney \nhas long been the main \u201cgateway\u201d for ADB missions from Headquarters traveling to the PDMCs.   \n \n16.  Direct Contact with PDMC officials. On the basis of observed travel patterns, senior \nPDMC government officials and civil society delegation visits to or through Sydney would likely \naverage at least 40 per year. This compares with eight government delegation visits per year on \naverage  to  ADB  Headquarters  in  Manila.    Various  organizations  in  Sydney  regularly  host \nimportant development-related events involving senior PDMC officials.  At present, the majority \nof the ADB Institute\u2019s seminars for senior Pacific officials are being held in Australia due to its \naccessibility and the availability of suitable facilities, including for larger conferences.  \n \n17.  Deepening Partnerships.  Sydney has the largest concentration of development and \nacademic institutions, multinational businesses and financial institutions, and civil society groups \nin the Southern Pacific region.  The World Bank and International Finance Corporation have \noffices there, and it is the headquarters of the South Pacific Project Facility. The European \nInvestment Bank is also considering opening its Pacific office in Sydney in 2003.  Sydney hosts \nnumerous Pacific island research centers, such as the Research Institute for Asia and the \nPacific. Major international media groups are represented. Sydney is the regional headquarters \nfor many major foreign and domestic banks, and hosts more than two thirds of the Asia-Pacific \nregional headquarters of multinational corporations. An ADB presence in Sydney, with a strong \nfocus on liaison and coordination, would enable ADB to more effectively project its own and \nPDMC views to the wider funding community, as well as to more effectively tap into the \nknowledge and experience of others.  Given PARD\u2019s particular emphasis on delivery of KPS to \nits PDMCs, access to this broad community and pool of knowledge is a significant advantage.  \n \n18.  Information  and  Communication  Technology.  Information  technology  and \ncommunications  facilities  are  excellent,  enabling  reliable  and  low-cost  contacts  with  key \ndevelopment partners in the region and globally; these facilities would also reduce the need for \nsome travel, including by non-PARD Headquarters staff. \n                                                 \n6  These  include  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  Pacific  Forum  Secretariat,  World  Health    \nOrganization,  South  Pacific  Applied  Geoscience  Commission,  Pacific  Community,  International  Labor \nOrganization, Tourism Council of the South Pacific, and United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund.  ", "  5\nC.  Overall Assessment \n \n19.  The  combination  of  new  locations  seen  as  offering  the  highest  level  of  service, \nefficiency, and incremental benefits for the PDMCs and ADB is offices in both Suva and \nSydney. A Sydney-based Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office (PLCO), to be opened in early \n2004, will provide PDMCs operational services on a selective basis, supplementing continued \nManila-based operations (Appendix 3). ADB would expect to open the main subregional office in \nSuva later in 2004 (Appendix 2), with our Fiji portfolio having expanded significantly, and with \nbetter travel hub and communication facilities coming on stream. Overall, the complementary \nnature of the two new offices in Suva and Sydney would make optimal use of their respective \nadvantages and provide, for ADB and the PDMCs, the strongest possible network of offices \nwithin the Pacific to enhance ADB\u2019s responsiveness and the quality of its services (see Box 3).  \nOnce both offices are fully operational, our current offices in Vanuatu and Timor-Leste would be \nseriously reviewed, possibly retaining liaison staff only.7 \n \n \n \nBox 3:  Complementarity of Suva and Sydney Office Locations \n \nComplementarity  Suva and Sydney Combination \n \nAccess to key development  Suva hosts important regional organizations, plus the United \npartners  Nations and European Union subregional offices; Sydney \nhosts other key development partners. There is no \nsignificant overlap. \nContact with the academic  Suva has the main subregional university, University of the \ncommunity   South Pacific, and its outreach to all Pacific countries; \nSydney has five universities with academic interests related \nto the Pacific region. \nLogistical arrangements  Suva/Nadi provides direct, short duration flights to Tonga, \nSamoa, Cook Islands, and Tuvalu; Sydney has frequent \nflights to all PDMCs.  There are daily flights between the Fiji \nIslands and Australia. \nCommunications, both among  A hub and spoke telecommunications system can be \nsubregional offices and with  established with Sydney as the hub, at considerably less \nHeadquarters  cost than separate leased lines to each office.  Broadband \nconnection via the Southern Cross Cable is possible \nbetween Suva and Sydney, but not to any other PDMCs at \nthis stage. \n \n \nIV.  FUNCTIONS OF NEW PACIFIC REGION OFFICES \n \nA.  Standard Functions \n \n20.  In line with the objectives of the Resident Mission Policy, complementary offices in Suva \nand Sydney could be expected to perform all standard functions (government, civil society, and \n                                                 \n7  A decision on future representation in Timor-Leste will be made once the scale of ADB operations becomes  \nclearer. In the meantime, the Special Office for Timor-Leste is performing the standard functions of a resident \nmission. ", "6 \nprivate sector relations; policy dialogue and support; country reporting; aid coordination; and \nexternal  relations  and  information  dissemination),  as  well  as  some  specific  functions  as \ndescribed below. The PLCO in Sydney would be a hybrid office combining selected operational \nfunctions with coordination work. \n \nB.  Specific Functions \n \n21.  Over  the  2-year  period  (2004\u20132005),  substantial  country  programming  and  project \nadministration responsibilities would be shifted, in a phased manner, to the new offices. The \nPacific Operations Division in Headquarters would remain the focal point for regional strategy \nformulation and overall program coordination, substantial loan and TA project processing work, \nand country programming in the North Pacific DMCs (Marshall Islands and Federated State of \nMicronesia). Continuing significant loan processing responsibility at Headquarters would help \ndraw  from  close  interaction  with  supporting  departments  (Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department, Office of the General Counsel, etc.) during the project design phase. \nHowever, full use would be made of telecommunications services between Headquarters and \nthe field, as well as PARD\u2019s flexibility to deploy its sector experts to areas of greatest need. In \nview of the limited staff resources in PARD, it would be necessary to continue to operate in a \nflexible, matrix-style format, capitalizing on the specific expertise of staff regardless of location. \nTo the extent possible, all staff would be given additional training to reinforce this objective and \norganizational structure. By 2005, the split between Manila-based and field-based professional \nstaff would be about 60:40, although this would be kept under constant review. Importantly, \nmost PARD staff outside ADB headquarters would be located in PDMCs. The office alignment, \nliaison and coordination with key development partners, and emphasis on KPS delivery would \nalso help ADB to make the most effective use of non-PARD staff expertise in the various ADB \nknowledge departments, in conducting research, post evaluation, training, and workshops in the \nPacific region.  \n \n22.  The RM in PNG is not envisioned as having a subregional function, although staff are \nlikely to be involved in regional activities, such as TA, training, and capacity building programs. \nThe  office  in  Port  Vila  would  continue  to  emphasize  operations  on  Vanuatu,  where  a \nconcentrated approach by ADB is needed to assist the Government to build on recent reforms \nsupported by ADB. However, current South Pacific Regional Mission staff (including support \nand regional staff) have built up considerable knowledge and expertise covering other South \nPacific countries, and they would be expected to contribute, as time and workloads permit, to \nthe functions of the Sydney and Suva offices, particularly in the transitional period, until these \noffices become fully operational. PARD expects to make significant efforts to retain and recruit \ncompetent PDMC staff for all of ADB\u2019s field locations. \n \nV.  ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE \n \n23.  The number of staff at the Pacific Subregional Office in Suva would reflect the workload \nanticipated in 2004 and beyond. The Suva subregional office would be established initially on a \nmodest scale, with three professional staff (the country director and two programs or projects \nofficers/economists), redeployed from ADB headquarters. Other staff would consist of three \nregional officers (one for finance and administration and two for project administration and \nregional economic work) and six nationally recruited administrative staff (See Appendix 2).  In \naddition to an expanding portfolio of projects in the Fiji Islands, the subregional office would \ncover operations in Tonga, Samoa, and Tuvalu. \n ", "  7\n24.  The number of staff at PLCO would reflect its workload and hybrid nature. The Sydney \noffice would be established on a modest scale, with four professional staff (the country director \nand three project specialists/economists), mainly redeployed from ADB headquarters. Other \nstaff would consist of three regional officers (one for finance and administration and two for \nproject administration and regional economic work)  and five support staff.  To the extent \npossible,  staff  would  be  drawn  from  the  Pacific  region.    In  addition  to  its  essentially \nrepresentation functions, the office would be operationally responsible for all of the southern \nPDMCs, and once the Pacific Subregional Office is fully functional, would remain responsible for \nCook Islands, Nauru, Solomon Islands, and Kiribati.  PLCO would also provide back up support \nfor Timor-Leste and Vanuatu, pending future decisions on the scale of Pacific offices in those \nlocations. \n \nVI.  SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS \n \n25.  Fiji Islands has had a rather turbulent past, with coups in 1987 and 2000, in part related \nto the ethnic mix.  Following free and fair elections, the Fiji Labour Party has challenged the \nconstitutionality of the current Government, and the Supreme Court is scheduled to address this \nissue in June 2003.  Nevertheless, legal processes are underway to resolve this issue, the coup \nleaders have been brought to justice, and the rule of law is firmly entrenched.  Fiji Islands has \nseen an upsurge in petty crimes over the past few years, partly as a result of the poverty \nimpacts triggered by the political unrest. The extent of criminal activities, however, is much less \nthan in many DMCs.  In Sydney, there are no significant security concerns, and PLCO would be \nable to act as a backstop office in the event that there are natural disasters or political crises \nthat demand evacuation from other Pacific offices.  \n \nVII.  COSTS \n \n26.  The one-time establishment costs of the Pacific Subregional Office are estimated at \nabout  $517,500  (Appendix  2),  which  reflects  the  capital  expenditure  requirements  of \nestablishing the subregional office. The first full year of operation would be 2005. Associated \ncost reductions at headquarters and at South Pacific Regional Mission include (i) salaries and \nbenefits of professional staff to be redeployed to the subregional office, and (ii) savings on the \nbusiness travel costs of missions.  The impacts on ADB\u2019s internal administrative expenses for \n2004 and 2005 are estimated at $215,155 and $292,631 respectively. The benefits packages \nfor staff assigned to the Pacific Subregional Office would follow standard ADB practice. \n \n27.  The  one-time  establishment  costs  of  the  PLCO  are  estimated  at  about $363,000 \n(Appendix 3), which reflects the capital expenditure requirements of establishing PLCO. As for \nSuva, cost reductions at Headquarters and at the South Pacific Regional Mission include (i) \nsalaries and benefits of professional staff to be redeployed to PLCO, and (ii) savings on the \nbusiness travel costs of missions. The impacts on ADB\u2019s internal administrative expenses for \n2004 and 2005 are estimated at $627,610 and $614,481 respectively. The benefits packages \nfor staff assigned to PLCO would follow standard ADB practice; much lower staff allowance \ncosts are expected given that the duty station is in a developed country.   \n \nVIII.  BENEFITS \n \n28.  The key potential benefits of this multinodal approach to the location of ADB\u2019s offices in \nthe Pacific region may be summarized as follows: \n ", "8 \n(i)       Place a critical mass of ADB staff within a maximum of 1 day\u2019s travel time  from \nevery PDMC, with most staff outside Headquarters located in PDMCs. \n(ii)  By  substantially  reducing  travel  and  transit  time,  free  up  significant  staff \nresources to perform more work in the PDMCs, especially in relation to KPS and \npolicy dialogue. \n(iii)  Strengthen ADB operations in the two largest regional developing economies \n(PNG and the Fiji Islands, which are also the two largest regional borrowers from \nADB). \n(iv)  Provide a stronger field presence to extend ADB\u2019s policy advice and perspectives \nmore systematically throughout the region. \n(v)  Create a strong ADB presence in two major regional travel hubs, leading to much \nmore regular contact with senior officials from the region. \n(vi)  Position ADB to liaise, deepen operational contacts, and improve coordination \nwith  important  development  partners,  knowledge  providers,  and  the  private \nsector. \n(vii)  Allow  ADB  to  deliver  training  services  much  more  effectively  to  PDMC \nparticipants. \n \nIX.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n29.  It is recommended that the Board approve the establishment of the proposed Pacific \nSubregional Office in Suva, Fiji Islands and the Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office in \nSydney, Australia in 2004, along the lines indicated in this paper. ", "Appendix 1 9\n   \n \nCOMPARISON OF LOCATION OPTIONS FOR PACIFIC OFFICES \n \nA.  Evaluation Process of Alternative Locations \n \n1.  To establish a resident mission (RM) in all 13 Pacific developing member countries \n(PDMCs) would approximately double the operating costs of the Pacific Department (PARD) of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and (assuming no corresponding increase in professional \nstaff)  leave  an  insufficient  number  of  core  staff  at  Headquarters  in  Manila  for  country \nprogramming and loan processing. Therefore, some amalgamation of staff in a subregional \noffice or offices will be necessary for the foreseeable future.  Since 1994, the number of staff in \nADB's South Pacific Regional Mission (SPRM) located in Port Vila, Vanuatu has been gradually \nreduced due to Vanuatu's high cost and inconvenience as a travel hub.  As a subregional office, \nSPRM may be regarded as being suboptimal at present and is certainly considerably changed \nfrom its previous peak of 11 professional staff. Accordingly, a more suitable office arrangement \nis urgently required.  \n \n2.  The primary objective of establishing office(s) in the Pacific region is not to achieve the \nleast-cost option. Rather, the objective is to meet the demands of ADB\u2019s PDMC clients in the \nmost cost-effective and efficient manner possible. The PDMCs, over the past years, have \nclearly expressed the demand side of the equation. They value most from ADB its policy advice \nand guidance on how best to develop their economies. In effect, they see ADB as augmenting \ntheir own human resources, filling in gaps in staff competencies and providing independent, \nreliable policy guidance, technical assistance and a wide variety of knowledge products and \nservices (KPS). Compared with other regional departments of ADB, PARD provides almost \nseven times the ADB average ratio of TA to loans, by amount (Table A1.1).  \n \nTable A1.1:  Relationship of Technical Assistance and Loans by Regional Department \n \nRegional Department  Ratio of TAs/Loans ($)  Ratio of TAs/Loans (no.) \nEast & Central Asia  2.1%  2.2 \nMekong  4.7%  2.1 \nSouth Asia   1.9%  1.5 \nSoutheast Asia  1.1%  1.0 \nPacific  14.5%  4.2 \nADB Average   2.2%  1.8 \n \n3.  Of  course,  the  PDMCs  also  appreciate  that  these  TA  services  are  backed  up  by \naffordable loan financing. However, over the past few years total PDMC borrowing has been \nonly about $100 million per year. In 2002, this dropped to less than $50 million.8 From the \nsupply side, it would be difficult to justify running a department that costs over $8 million per \nyear solely on the basis of this small lending operation. \n \n4.  As a quantitative measure of ADB\u2019s ability to deliver improved KPS to its PDMC clients, \nthe  number  of  increased  days  in  contact  with  senior  government  officials  is  seen  as  an \nappropriate  measure.9  Viewed  in  this  manner,  the  optimization  problem  becomes  \u201cWhich \n                                                 \n8  Papua New Guinea (PNG), with 5 million of the total PDMC population of 8 million, has been the largest borrower, \nso a separate RM has been approved for PNG to help manage this loan portfolio. \n9  On average, each PARD staff spends about 60 days per year in the field (excluding transit time), while there are \nusually 60-90 ADB-funded consultants (TA and staff consultants) in the field at any time.  Accordingly, PDMC  \nofficials are 10 times more likely to receive policy guidance from a consultant than from staff. ", "10    Appendix 1  \ncombination of locations offers the optimum amount of contact time at an acceptable cost?\u201d An \nacceptable cost is seen as involving no more than natural growth in the number of professional \nstaff and no more than the expected 5-10% staff cost and travel cost increases in 2004 and \n2005, compared with the 2002 budget.10 The contact time differential among the various options \ncan also be expressed in imputed value terms by assuming that staff time is at least as valuable \nas that of ADB staff consultants.  \n \nB.  The Alternatives \n \n5.  With 13 PDMCs and two nearby developed countries (Australia and New Zealand), as \nwell as the Headquarters functions in Manila, Philippines, there is a very large number of \npossible combinations of office locations. To cover the range of possibilities, six options were \nexamined in considerable detail, as shown in Table A1.2, with most emphasis on the first four (a \nconsolidation in Manila and rebuilding SPRM were seen as at opposite ends of the range of \noptions). Other possibilities, such as the kind offers of Samoa and Cook Islands to host a \nsubregional office of ADB, and the suggestion that Auckland may be suitable, given its role as a \ntravel hub, were also examined.  \n \nTable A1.2:  Alternative Scenarios \n \nScenario  Office Locations  Staffing \n1  Suva (Pacific Subregional Office)  -  4 PS, 3 RS, and 6 new SS \nClose SPRM \n2  Sydney (Pacific Liaison and  4 PS, 3 RS, and 5 new SS \nCoordination Office) - Close SPRM \n3  Suva Subregional Office + Sydney  7 PS, 6 RS, and 11 new SS  \nOffice \u2013 close SPRM \n4  Suva + Sydney Offices \u2013 Retain an RM  As for scenario 3, except that 1 \nor Liaison Office in Vanuatu  PS, 2 RS, and 3 SS would be \nretained in Vanuatu \n5  Close SPRM \u2013 Manila Only  Relocate 2 PS and 3 RS to \nHeadquarters \u2013 NS/SS redundant \n6  Upgrade SPRM  Transfer 2 additional PS from HQ, \nretain current SPRM staff \nHQ=Headquarters, NS=national staff, PS=professional staff, RS=regional staff, SS=support staff \n \n6.  Examining the flight connections (see Map), distances, and travel times, Suva would \nappear to be best-suited to servicing Tonga, Samoa, Tuvalu as well as the Fiji Islands. Sydney \nis a more convenient location for Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Nauru, Cook Islands, and possibly \nKiribati, as well as for providing a backup to Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste, but also \nprovides same-day flights to all the above countries. Manila remains the best location to service \nRepublic of Marshall Islands (RMI), Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), and Palau. As most \nPDMCs are tourist locations, per kilometer flight costs in the Pacific are often high (particularly \nfrom Vanuatu), and physical proximity may not be the best measure. Lack of competition in the \naviation market in the Pacific, lack of cooperation among PDMCs on aviation issues, and the \ndesire of each PDMC to have its own national airline also add to travel costs. Accordingly, the \n                                                 \n10   ADB-wide, the 2003 budget provides for a 7.8% increase over 2002.  In this paper, phased opening of the two new  \noffices in 2004 is assumed. All cost estimates are on an average of 3 months in 2004 for Suva (Pacific Subregional \nOffice), a full year in 2004 for Sydney (Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office), and a full year in 2005 for both \noffices, to ensure a true comparison.  ", "Appendix 1 11\n   \n \nultimate assignment of responsibility for specific PDMCs to a particular office would depend on \nvarious operational and comparative cost factors at the time.

Suva (Pacific Subregional Office) \u2013 Close SPRM \n \n7.  There are powerful arguments that apply to a Suva-based subregional office. In terms of \ncontact time, the principal difference between Suva and Sydney would be that many PDMC \nofficials transit through Nadi, Fiji Islands but would rarely make a side trip to Suva.  Transit time \nsavings from Nadi would be similar to Sydney, but one must add the transit from Suva to the \ninternational airport at Nadi, which often makes same-day travel to other PDMCs impossible. \nHence the critical parameter of contact time would be less in Suva than in Sydney. \n \n8.  The other significant differences between scenario 1 and scenario 2, apart from one \nbeing in a PDMC and the other in a developed country, are (i) travel schedules are not very \nconvenient from Suva (most travel is through the international airport at Nadi, 3 hours away by \nroad, and flights are often late at night or very early in the morning,11 necessitating an overnight \nstay in Nadi); (ii) several PDMCs are not directly accessible from the Fiji Islands and require \ntransit through Australia or New Zealand; (iii) while a number of development partners are in \nSuva, there is no cofinancing institution based in the Fiji Islands; and (iv) communications still \nneed to be improved, partly due to monopoly control by FINTEL and Telecom Fiji (see Table \nA1.3).   \n \nTable A1.3: Suva Only \u2013 Close SPRM - Advantage and Disadvantages \n \nAdvantages  Disadvantages \n\u2022  Increased contact with PDMC officials - \u2022 Travel outside Fiji Islands incurs 3 hour \n109 days  transit time from Suva to Nadi \n\u2022  Proximity to several regional institutions  \u2022 Communications facilities poorer quality \n\u2022  Lower average travel costs than from  than Sydney \nHQ or Vanuatu  \u2022 Concerns of Vanuatu Government and \n\u2022  Reduced transit time compared with HQ  SS about closing SPRM \nor Vanuatu  \u2022 Redundancy and winding up costs from \n\u2022  Meets PDMC preference for office  closing SPRM \nlocation in DMC  \u2022 Need to recruit 6 new SS \n\u2022  Assists processing and administration   \nof projects in Fiji Islands \nDMC=developing  member  country,  HQ=Headquarters,  PDMC=Pacific  developing  member  country, \nSPRM=South Pacific Regional Mission, SS=support staff \n \n9.

The estimated cost of running a larger office in Sydney (4 professional staff compared \nwith 2 in SPRM) is shown in Table A1.6.  The total costs of a Sydney office would be less (by \nabout 0.2%) than the current status quo total cost in Vanuatu and Headquarters.

The current cost of the leased line ($110,000 per annum) is covered \nby the OIST budget, not PARD\u2019s. \n \n14.  The major cost saving is from reduced business travel costs due to operating out of a \nmajor travel hub. This is offset by increased communication costs (based on satellite connection \nto  Headquarters)  and  higher  office  operating  costs.  It  should  be  noted  that  (i)  this \ncommunication cost would need to be incurred in Vanuatu in 2003 if SPRM were to be retained; \n(ii) the technology chosen is likely to be replaced by cheaper alternatives (such as Demand \nAssigned  Multiple  Access,  which  splits  bandwidth  across  several  offices15);  and  (iii) \nvideoconferencing facilities would further reduce the need for business travel and improve \ncommunication with Headquarters.  The additional cost for communication would be about \n$100,000  over  the  current  situation  for  a  considerably  improved  system  (allowing \nteleconferencing, for example). \n \n15.  Staff costs are essentially budget neutral due to lower benefits paid to professional and \nregional  staff  in  a  more  secure  location  than  Vanuatu  (where  24-hour security has to be \nprovided for residences, and staff are given substantial cost of living and hardship benefits). \nThere are also expected to be some efficiency gains  from Australian-based support staff, \ndespite the need to recruit new staff, due to external efficiencies in the Australian business \nenvironment.

On examination of the advantages and disadvantages of both Suva and Sydney listed \nabove, an obvious suggestion is to combine both options to capture the maximum advantages \nand counterbalance the disadvantages, provided there is no major cost penalty. \n \n17.  The main advantages of this arrangement would be (i) optimizing contact time with \ngovernment officials; (ii) placing staff in optimal locations to service PDMCs; (iii) maximizing \nliaison and coordination with international and regional organizations and bilateral aid agencies \nin the Pacific region; (iv) creating the potential for technical efficiencies on the communications \nside, utilizing Sydney as a communication hub; (v) responding to PDMC concerns by having the \nmain subregional operational office located in a  PDMC; and (vi) facilitating PARD\u2019s matrix \norganizational  structure,  as  Suva  is  easily  accessible  from  Sydney,  and  vice  versa,  thus \navoiding the current isolation felt in SPRM by being so remote from Manila (see Table A1.7).  \nHaving  complementary  offices  in  both  locations  would  facilitate  PDMC  officials  transiting \nthrough Sydney or Fiji Islands to have discussions with ADB staff, use the library facilities, and \naccess  other  KPS.    This  would  provide  a  comparative  advantage  over  the  World  Bank \narrangement with only one Pacific regional office, in Sydney.  By ensuring that staff are located \nclosest to the countries that they are responsible for, there would be considerable reduction in \nlargely  wasted  transit  time.    Locating  the  majority  of  staff  who  are  stationed  outside \nHeadquarters in PDMCs also accommodates PDMC preferences.   \n \nTable A1.7: Sydney + Suva - Close SPRM  - Advantages and Disadvantages \n \nAdvantages  Disadvantages \n\u2022  Increases contact with PDMC officials  \u2022 Concern of Vanuatu Government and \nand others \u2013 292 days  SS on closing SPRM \n\u2022  Optimizes frequent contact with major  \u2022 Redundancy and new hire of SS \ndevelopment partners in the region  \u2022 Splits professional staff between two \n\u2022  Partly meets PDMC preferences  locations \n\u2022  Capitalizes on main Pacific travel hubs   \n\u2022  Capitalizes on academic, private sector, \nand NGO contacts in Sydney \n\u2022  Possible hub and spoke communication \nsystem \n\u2022  Lowest combination of travel costs \n\u2022  Assists processing and administration \nof new projects in Fiji Islands, as the \nportfolio grows over 2003-2005  \n\u2022  Back up to HQ missions and in case of \nevacuation from one or more offices \nHQ=Headquarters,  NGO=nongovernmental  organizations,  PDMC=Pacific  developing  member  country, \nSPRM=South Pacific Regional Mission, SS=support staff \n ", "16    Appendix 1  \n18.

Recruitment of new regional and national staff (3 RS and 11 SS) would also take \nsome time.  In addition, a hub and spoke communication system for the network of Pacific \noffices would require locating its core facility in Sydney, with a direct link to Manila.  \n \n19.

Staff costs would increase in the first year if both offices were opened simultaneously \n(due to relocation costs of professional and regional staff and redundancy of SPRM support \nstaff), so a phased introduction over 12 months would be preferred. Once fully operational, \naverage staff costs would be only about 5.3% higher than the status quo, despite having almost \none third of PARD professional staff in the field. This increase in staff costs also reflects the \naddition of 3 regional staff and 11 new support staff (including redundancy payments for SPRM \nsupport  staff).  The  cost  of  additional  regional  and  support  staff employed, together with \nrelocation costs, could be by and large offset by the potential reduction in staff travel costs from \nHeadquarters and SPRM.  Several regional airlines (such as Virgin Blue) have indicated interest \nin servicing tourism destinations such as the Fiji Islands, and both competition and the number \nof international flights out of Suva (instead of Nadi) can be expected to increase by 2005.

At one stage there were up to \n11 professional staff operating from that office, with only a liaison officer for the South Pacific \nbased in Manila.17 There would be considerable political sensitivity to closing the office at this \nstage, in much the same way as ADB could be criticized by many observers if it moved \nHeadquarters from Manila due to its inconvenience as a travel hub and increasing security \nissues. Merely shifting the office from Port Vila to Suva would not provide an additional office in \na PDMC, as requested by PDMC governments. \n \n22.  The  main  advantages  of  this  option  over  Scenario  3  are  (i)  the  reduced  political \nconsequences of closing a long-established office; (ii) the continued close contact of ADB staff \nwith the Vanuatu Government at a time of real fiscal crisis; (iii) continued close supervision of \nongoing loan projects in Vanuatu, especially those that require travel to the outer islands; and \n(iv)  reduced  impact  on  loyal  and  experienced  local  ADB  support  staff  (see  Table  A1.9).  \nNevertheless, it is recognized that further review of the rationale for retaining Port Vila as an RM \nor liaison office would be needed once both offices in Suva and Sydney were fully functioning. \n \nTable A1.9:  Sydney + Suva + Vanuatu Office  - Advantages and Disadvantages \n \nAdvantages  Disadvantages \n\u2022 Maximizes contact time with PDMC  \u2022  Some additional costs, balanced by \nofficials \u2013 364 days  imputed value of increased contact \n\u2022 Acceptable to PDMCs  and reduced transit time \n\u2022 Accesses maximum range of  \u2022  Some redundancy and downsizing \nstakeholders and knowledge providers  costs for Vanuatu \n\u2022 Liaison with AusAID, NZAID, and other \nregional organizations \n\u2022 Back up to HQ missions and in case of \nevacuation from one or more offices \nAusAID=Australian Agency for International Development, HQ=Headquarters, NZAID=New Zealand Agency \nfor International Development, PDMC=Pacific developing member country \n \n23.  Importantly, of all scenarios examined, this option maximizes the amount of contact time \nwith government officials, thus increasing ADB\u2019s ability to meet PDMC demands for its KPS and \npolicy advice.  \n \n24.  This scenario examined the cost and other implications of retaining, for the time being, a \nsmall office in Port Vila, Vanuatu. The incremental operational costs over the Sydney and Suva \ncombination are not great (about 4.8% of current costs) and would mainly reflect some short-\nterm staff cost increases and travel cost increases (Table A1.10). Administrative costs may also \nincrease depending on the merits of upgrading the communication system in Port Vila, for what \nmay be a temporary arrangement, and the technological options available. It is also likely that \nsome office space savings could be achieved by moving into a smaller office building (although \nthis is not yet factored into the calculation).

This strategy would be counter to the intent of the Resident Mission Policy and the \nrecent review of the RMs,18 and would not satisfy PDMC preferences for an increased ADB \npresence in PDMCs. Considerably more time would be lost in transit, and there would be even \nless contact with PDMC officials than at present. While this could be compensated for to some \nextent by increasing the employment of staff consultants, this would not meet the overall \nobjective of ensuring that ADB staff increases the amount of contact time with PDMC senior \nofficials to offer policy advice and other KPS (see Table A1.11). \n \nTable A1.11: Headquarters Only  - Advantages and Disadvantages \n \nAdvantages  Disadvantages \n\u2022  Eliminates high cost of SPRM  \u2022 Reduces staff contact with PDMC officials, \n\u2022  Increases critical mass of staff at  especially in Vanuatu \u2013 70 days less \nHQ  \u2022 Concern of Vanuatu Government and SS on \n\u2022  Ensures all staff linked into HQ  closing SPRM \nactivities (e.g., KPS)  \u2022 Redundancy and new hire of SS \n\u2022  Centralizes project administration  \u2022 Increased cost of travel \n\u2022 Increased time in transit \n\u2022 Not in same time zone as most PDMCs \nHQ=Headquarters, KPS=knowledge products and services, PDMC=Pacific developing member country, \nSPRM=South Pacific Regional Mission, SS=support staff \n \n27.

Upgrade Vanuatu Subregional Office \n \n28.  An alternative to cutting back Vanuatu would be to increase the number of professional \nstaff working out of Vanuatu, as has been tried in the past.  \n \n29.  The primary advantage would be to increase the amount of contact with PDMC officials \nover the status quo. However, the travel difficulties from Port Vila and the lack of officials \ntransiting through Vanuatu would make any change in this measure very marginal (see Table \nA1.13). \n \nTable A1.13: Upgrade Vanuatu \u2013 Advantages and Disadvantages \n \nAdvantages  Disadvantages \n\u2022  Increases contact with PDMC  \u2022 Increased operational costs of SPRM \nofficials, especially in Vanuatu \u2013  \u2022 Poor communications \n24 days  \u2022 Average mission cost increases \n\u2022  Meets PDMC preference of  \u2022 Excessive time in transit \nregional office in a PDMC  \u2022 Has been tried before (up to 11 professional \n\u2022  Builds on project administration  staff) \nexperience in SPRM  \u2022 Office capacity may need to be expanded \n\u2022 Increased security costs, hardship allowance, \nand other staff costs related to location \nPDMC=Pacific developing member country, SPRM=South Pacific Regional Mission \n \n30.  Staff costs would rise significantly (reflecting higher benefits paid to staff relocated to \nPort Vila), and there is relatively little travel cost difference between Port Vila and Manila origins \n(Table A1.14). The main additional administrative cost would be the need to upgrade the ", "20    Appendix 1  \ncommunication link from leased line to satellite, to facilitate videoconferencing.  Any decision to \nlocate even larger numbers of professional staff to Vanuatu would considerably increase the \ncosts, as additional support staff and/or regional staff would need to be recruited. The cost of \nmaintaining a professional staff in Port Vila is approximately 25% higher than in Manila, due to \nhardship allowance, security services, free housing, etc. Hence, there is  little justification for \nreversing the recent decisions to downsize SPRM. \n \nTable A1.14: Upgrade Vanuatu \u2013 Costs \n \nCost Item  Increment  Increase/Decrease \n($)  % \nOperational Costs  (42,811)  0.59 \n    Staff Costs  113,617  2.16 \n    Consultants and Business Travel  (153,428)  (7.86) \n    Overtime  (3,000)  (22.90) \n    Training  -              - \n     \nAdministrative Costs  81,639  21.88 \n   Office Space  -  - \n   Communicationa  77,389  32.80 \n   Office Supplies & Others  4,250  14.66 \n   Depreciation/Amortization  -  - \n      \n                 Total  38,828  0.51 \na   An allowance is made for upgrading the communication system to satellite transmission, which \nwould be needed if SPRM were to be retained as the main subregional office (estimated \nincremental cost of $82,000 per annum, compared with current leased line cost of $110,000). \n \nD.  Summary \n \n31.  If cost were the only criterion, closing SPRM and returning to a Headquarters-only \noperation would be the cheapest option. Given the undesirability of this option, opening one \nsubregional office in either Suva or Sydney and closing SPRM would be the next cheapest \noption. However, without any significant increase in the current PARD budget, ADB can avail of \nthe considerable complementary advantages of both locations \u2014Suva and Sydney. In addition, \nthis combination would deliver the equivalent of almost 300 days additional contact time with \nPDMC officials, compared with 100 in Suva alone and almost 200 in Sydney alone. As PARD \nstaff currently spend about 60 days per year on average in contact with PDMC officials, this \nwould be equivalent to increasing the contact time of current staff by about 20% (see Table \nA1.15). To reflect the monetary value of the increased or reduced contact time associated with \neach option, an imputed value that equates an additional contact day by ADB staff to at least \nthe average cost of a staff consultant (at $500 per day) can be included in the analysis. At this \nrelatively low imputed value, the actual costs of various options may be adjusted downwards by \n2-3%,  with  the  marginal  difference  increasing  as  the  number  of  contact  days  increases. \nFurthermore, this combination of complementary offices in Suva and Sydney would enable all of \nthe PARD\u2019s offices to improve communications with Headquarters (and staff on mission in other \nPDMCs) through a hub and spoke satellite system, using Demand Assigned Multiple Access. \nAccordingly, there would be corresponding reductions in the administrative costs of the Special \nOffice in Timor-Leste and the RM in Papua New Guinea, plus back-up facilities in case of the \nneed for evacuation. \n ", "Appendix 1 21\n   \n \nTable A1.15:  Comparison of Options (without imputed value of contact time) \n \n  Increase/  Increase/ \nIncremental cost compared with   Decrease in  Decrease in \n2002 expenses  2004-2005  Contact Daysa \n  (%)  (days) (%) \nScenario 1  Suva Only  -1.1       109 ( 5.4%) \nScenario 2  Sydney Only  -0.2       194 ( 9.7%) \nScenario 3  SUV+SYD  5.7       292 (14.6%) \nScenario 4  SUV+SYD+VAN  11.5       364 (18.2%) \nScenario 5  HQ Only  -5.1        -70 ( -3.5%) \nScenario 6  VAN Upgrade  0.5         24 ( 1.2%) \nHQ=Headquarters,  SUV=Pacific  Subregional  Office,  SYD=Pacific  Liaison  and \nCoordination Office, VAN=Vanuatu Resident Mission \na  Baseline is assumed to be 2,000 days per year, based on the 2001 actual travel \npattern.  This is equivalent to 200 missions, with at least 400 transit days (allowing \nthat some missions are back-to-back to avoid excessive downtime). \n \n32.  Finally, for a small additional cost, a scaled-down RM or liaison office could be retained \nin Vanuatu, without exceeding ADB-wide budget constraints. Such a decision (even if only \ntemporary) would (i) be politically sound, (ii) ensure continuity of project administration expertise \nuntil the subregional offices are fully operational, and (iii) initially assist the Vanuatu Government \nas it attempts to cope with a severe fiscal crisis. In addition, of all the options considered, this \nscenario  would  maximize  the  amount  of  contact  days  with  senior  government  officials \n(estimated at about 18.2%). \n \n33.  In summary, to best meet the objectives set out in para. 2, a combination of Suva and \nSydney offices, plus downscaling SPRM to a Vanuatu RM or liaison office (at least until both \nSuva and Sydney are fully operational in 2005) is supported by the above analysis. A serious \nreview of the continued viability of the scaled-down Vanuatu office would be carried out once \nboth the Suva and Sydney offices are fully functional.

The HCA negotiations will be finalized prior to opening the \nsubregional office. \n \n2.  The number of staff at the Suva subregional office would reflect the workload anticipated \nin 2004 and beyond. The Suva subregional office is to be established initially on a modest scale, \nwith  three  professional  staff  (the  country  director  and  two  programs  or  projects \nofficers/economists), redeployed from ADB Headquarters. Other staff would consist of three \nregional officers (one for finance and administration and two for project administration and \nregional economic work) and six nationally recruited administrative staff.   \n \n3.
