The  Project  forms \npart  of  the  Bangkok-Phnom  Penh-Ho  Chi  Min  City-Vung  Tau \nRoad  Improvement  Project  (Greater  Mekong  Subregion  [GMS] \nis  one  of  10  high-priority \nRegional  Highway  R1),  which \nsubregional \nidentified  under  a  Subregional \nTransport  Sector  Study  completed  in  1994.  GMS  Regional \nHighway  R1  is  a  core  road  infrastructure  element  of  the  GMS \nSouthern Economic Corridor, a priority development corridor that \nconnects  central  Thailand \nthrough \nCambodia  and  that  will  increase  integration  of  the  Cambodian \neconomy  with  the  economies  of  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam.  The \nProject  will  rehabilitate  national  road  (NR)  5  and  NR6,  and \nreconstruct  about  45  bridges  between  Siem  Reap  and  Poipet  on \nthe border with Thailand, thus (i) completing a critical missing link \nin  GMS  Regional  Highway  R1,  (ii)  establishing  direct  highway \nconnection  between  Thailand  and  the  rapidly  developing  tourism \ncenter in Siem Reap and Angkor Wat, and (iii) providing access to \nnorthwestern  Cambodia  by  completing  the  primary  road  network \naround  Tonle  Sap.  The  Project  will  also  reconstruct  about  50 \nbridges  on  approximately  200  kilometers  of  the  northern  loop  of \nNR56  and  NR68,  linking  the  towns  of  Svey  Chek,  Thmar  Puok, \nand Samrong to the national road network, and providing access \nto large rural areas in the provinces of Banteay Meanchey, Oddar \nMeanchey,  and  parts  of  Siem  Reap  province.  The  Project  will \ninitiate  a  process  of  reform  for  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and \nTransport  (MPWT).  An  associated  activity  has  been  developed \nto \nunder \nthe  Japan  Fund \nfor \nmainstream  pro-poor  appropriate \nroadworks in Cambodia. \n \nEconomic  cooperation  among \nis \nconsidered a major contributor to sustainable economic and social \ndevelopment,  including  poverty  reduction,  in  the  region.  Efficient \ntransport  that  provides  improved  access  is  key  to  increased \nsubregional  trade  and  tourism,  economic  development,  and \npoverty reduction. Investments in roads in Cambodia are part of a \ncontinuing  program \ntransport \nreestablish \ninfrastructure  after  nearly  30  years  of  civil  strife.  The  Project  will \n\nfor  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR) \ntechnological  solutions \n\nthe  six  GMS  countries \n\nthe  country\u2019s \n\nto \n\n\fiv \n\n \nObjectives \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n\ninvestments \n\nthus  assist  balanced  economic  and  social  development  in \nCambodia  through  improvement  of  part  of  a  major  subregional \ntransport  corridor  in  the  country.  Specifically,  the  Project  will \n(i) improve  subregional  economic  cooperation  via  realization  of \nthe Southern Economic Corridor; (ii) ensure flood-free connectivity \nto  the  northwestern  parts  of  the  country;  (iii) support  national \neconomic  development  and  local  employment  generation  by \nfacilitating the development of tourism; and (iv) improve access in \nnorthwest Cambodia to social services, markets, and employment \nopportunities  by  connecting  primary  and  secondary  roads  to  the \ntertiary  network  in  the  project  area,  thereby  supporting  the \ninfrastructure  currently  being  rehabilitated  under  other  projects \nfinanced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the area. \n \nThe  overall  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  promote  economic \nactivities and facilitate trade among Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet \nNam and to improve the prospects for poverty reduction along the \nSouthern  Economic  Corridor.  The  Project  will:  (i) together  with \nother  ongoing  and  planned \nfunded  by  other \ndevelopment  partners,  promote  national  and  subregional \neconomic  growth  by  reducing  the  cost  and  increasing  the \nreliability of transport, which will also encourage the fast-growing \ntourism  industry  and  subregional  trade,  and  promote  general \neconomic  growth;  (ii) reduce  poverty  by  providing  all-year,  all-\nweather  access  to  employment  opportunities,  markets,  and \ngrowth  centers;  (iii) improve  social  conditions  by  providing  all-\nyear,  all-weather  access  to  education  and  health;  (iv) promote \nprivate  sector  participation  and  strengthen  the  domestic  road-\nroad \nindustry  by  providing  opportunities \ncontracting \nconstruction  and  maintenance;  (v) work  with  an  experienced \nnongovernment  organization  (NGO)  under  the  national  human \nimmunodeficiency  virus/acquired \nimmunodeficiency  syndrome \n(HIV/AIDS)  framework  to  support  efforts  to  control  the  disease \nand  create  awareness  of  it;  (vi) initiate  a  process  of  reform  for \nMPWT,  particularly \nin  which  asset \nmanagement  and  transparency  must  be  a  guiding  theme;  and \n(vii) establish  effective  road  maintenance  management  and  road \nmaintenance financing systems. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $77.5 million  equivalent, \nincluding  interest  charges,  comprising  $52.0 million  (67.1%)  in \nforeign exchange cost and approximately $25.5 million equivalent \n(32.9%) in local currency cost. \n \n\nroad  sector \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nin \n\n\fv \n\n($ million)\n\nFinancing Plan \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nSource \n \n \n \nADB \nOPEC Fund \nGovernment \n \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \n\n43.0 \n9.0 \n0.0 \n\nTotal \n\n52.0 \n\nLocal \nCurrency  \n\nTotal Costs  % \n\n7.0 \n1.0 \n17.5 \n\n25.5 \n\n50.0 \n10.0 \n17.5 \n\n77.5 \n\n64.5 \n12.9 \n22.6 \n\n100.0 \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  The Project will be financed by a loan of Special Drawing Rights \n37.885  million  ($50.0 million  equivalent)  from  the  Special  Funds \nresources  of  ADB.

The  loan  will  cover  82.7%  of  the  entire  foreign \nexchange  cost  of  the  Project  and  about  27.5%  of  the  local \ncurrency  cost.  The  bulk  of  the  remaining  local  currency  cost  of \n$17.5 million  equivalent  will  be  met  by  the  Government  from  its \nown  resources.  Cofinancing  has  been  arranged  with  the  OPEC \nFund for International Development (OPEC Fund) in an amount of \n$10.0 million, which will meet 17.3% of foreign exchange cost and \n3.9%  of  local  currency  cost.  The  OPEC  Fund  loan  will  have  a \nmaturity  of  20  years,  with  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum,  a \nservice charge of 1.0% per annum, and a grace period of 5 years. \n \n30 June 2007 \n \n31 December 2006 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nMinistry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) \n \nThe  overall  project  implementation  period  is  4  years.

The  consultants  will  be \nin \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. \n \nThe main quantifiable benefits of the Project consist of (i) savings \nin  vehicle  operating  costs,  (ii) vehicle  and  passenger  time  cost \nsavings, and (iii) benefits from traffic generated by the reduction in \ntransport  costs.  The  subregional  benefits  are  associated  with  the \nroad\u2019s  contribution  to  increased  integration  of  the  economies  of \nThailand,  Cambodia,  and  Viet Nam \nthe \nestablishment  of  new  and  more  efficient  trading  and  transport \npatterns \nthe  subregion.  These  benefits  have  not  been \nquantified.  Additional  nonquantified  benefits  include  producer \nsurplus benefits; income generated by additional tourism; income \nfrom  increased  agricultural  activity;  and  social  benefits  from \nimproved  access  to  schools,  medical  facilities,  and  other  social \nservices.  \n \nThe  major  risks  to  the  Project  relate  to  achievement  of  expected \ntraffic  levels,  adherence  to  construction  schedules,  quality  of \nworks,  and  proper  selection  of  consultants  and  contractors.  With \nthe  growing  experience  of  MPWT  in  the  construction  and \nmaintenance of externally financed roads and the engagement of \nqualified  construction  supervision  consultants,  the  risks  to  timely \nand  successful  implementation  of  the  Project  will  be  greatly \nreduced. Particular attention will be paid to the formulation of and \nadherence  to  design  standards,  and  the  implementation  of  the \nresettlement  plan  so  that  appropriate  compensation  to  affected \npersons is effected prior to start of civil works. The reorganization \nof  MPWT  is  a  continuing  and  evolving  process  that  will  also \nrequire  close  attention  and  commitment  from  the  Government  to \nensure  that  a  clear  reform  program  is  implemented  during  the \nproject period.  \n\nthat  will  enable \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand administration of a proposed loan from the OPEC Fund for International Development to the \nKingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion:  Cambodia  Road  Improvement \nProject. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, ISSUES, AND DIRECTIONS \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\nThe Project forms part of the Bangkok-Phnom Penh-Ho Chi Minh City-Vung Tau Road \n2. \nImprovement Project (Greater Mekong Subregion [GMS] Regional Highway R1), which is one of \n10  high-priority  subregional  road  projects  identified  in  a  Subregional  Transport  Sector  Study \ncompleted in 1994.1 The GMS R1 forms the core of the Southern Economic Corridor that links \ncentral Thailand, Cambodia, and southern Viet Nam. The GMS R1 project was endorsed by the \nFourth  GMS  Ministerial  Conference  in  1994  and  reaffirmed  at  the  10th  GMS  Ministerial \nConference  in  November  2001.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  a  50-kilometer  (km)  section  of \nnational road (NR) 5, thereby completing the Bangkok-Phnom Penh-Ho Chi Minh City-Vung Tau \nGMS R1, which together with ongoing and planned improvements along NR1 between Phnom \nPenh  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  and  improvement  and  bridge  replacement  on  NR5  and  NR6 \nfinanced  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  Government  of  Japan,  and  the  World \nBank, will complete the southern leg of the Southern Economic Corridor.2 At the national level, \nthe  Project  responds  to  the  Government\u2019s  infrastructure  development  emphasis  on  improving \nthe national and provincial road network to allow more effective access to the rural areas and \ninduce  economic  growth.  The  roads  covered  by  the  Project  lie  in  the  northwestern  part  of  the \ncountry  and  include  important  strategic  and  rural  access  links  that  address  trade  and  poverty \nreduction  issues.  Northwestern  Cambodia  is  one  of  the  poorest  regions  of  the  country  and \ncritically needs postconflict reconstruction to enable resumption of economic activities. It is also \nthe region containing Angkor Wat, which forms the basis for a rapidly growing tourism industry, \nand  is  the  entry  and  exit  point  for  most  of  the  trade  between  Cambodia  and  Thailand.  The \nProject Framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \n3. \nYears  of  civil  strife  have  led  to  a  widespread  and  severe  deterioration  of  Cambodia\u2019s \ntransport infrastructure. The condition of the transport system continues to restrict the economic \nand social development of the country, despite the fact that much has been achieved in terms of \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  the  transport  system  during  the  past  10  years.  Notably,  a \ncore network of national roads, comprising approximately one third of the primary road network, \nhas  been  reestablished,  with  support  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  A  list  of \nexternal  assistance  activities  for  major  roads  is  in  Appendix  2.  The  main  seaport  at \nSihanoukville,  and  the  airports  at  Phnom  Penh  and  Siem  Reap,  have  also  been  rehabilitated \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1993.

Manila. \n\n2  Among other ADB projects that support the objectives of the Program is the GMS: Phnom-Penh-Ho Chi Minh City \n\nHighway Project (Loan 1659-CAM and Loan 1660-VIE).  \n\n\f2 \n\nand improved. ADB has provided loans for six transport projects, with three focusing on the road \nnetwork.3  \n \n\n2. \n\nRoad Network \n\nThe  Cambodian  road  network  covers  about  35,500  km,  including  approximately \n4. \n4,000 km of national roads, 3,500 km of provincial roads, and 28,000 km of rural and strategic \nroads. The roads have a significant number of bridges, about 4,000 on the primary roads alone. \nMost  of  the  road  network  is  dilapidated  and  large  parts  of  the  country  are  effectively  isolated \nduring  the  wet  season.  Most  bridges  are  seriously  damaged  or  failed.  The  Ministry  of  Public \nWorks  and  Transport  (MPWT)  considers  that  at  least  half  of  the  primary  road  network  and \nnearly  all  of  the  secondary  and  tertiary  roads  are  in  need  of  urgent  repair,  rehabilitation,  or \nreconstruction. Road condition surveys in 2002 confirm that 28% of the network is in good or fair \ncondition,  35%  in  poor  condition,  28%  in  bad  condition,  and  6%  under  reconstruction  or \nrehabilitation. An assessment of the road sector is presented in Appendix 3. Road transport is \nthe  dominant  mode  of  transport  within  Cambodia,  accounting  for  65%  of  all  passenger  traffic \nand 70% of all cargo traffic, with rail, river, and air transport sharing the rest. Subregional traffic \nis  dominated  by  road  and  river  modes  catering  to  cargo  traffic,  and  air  and  road  transport \ncatering to passenger traffic. Subregional traffic is still modest, but Cambodia and its neighbors \nare making great efforts at promoting and easing international traffic, developing effective cross-\nborder  agreements  to  facilitate  movement  of  goods  and  people,  adopting  uniform  navigational \nrules  on  the  Mekong  River,  and  developing  border  crossing  infrastructure  and  border  access \nroads. \n \n5. \nSubstantial  parts  of  Cambodia\u2019s  primary  road  network  form  part  of  designated \nsubregional  road  transport  corridors,  principal  among  those  being  GMS  Regional  Highway  1 \n(also known as Asian Highway 1) connecting Bangkok, Phnom Penh, and Ho Chi Minh City via \nNR5 and NR1 in Cambodia. The road section from Poipet on the Cambodia-Thailand border to \nSisophon represents the last remaining gap on GMS Regional Highway 1 to be rehabilitated. \n \n6. \nThe  Project  has  enormous  potential  to  facilitate  the  movement  of  goods  and  people \nbetween  Cambodia  and  Thailand,  given  the  fast-growing  economic  interaction  that  is  taking \nplace  between  the  two  countries.  Cross-border  trade  between  Cambodia  and  Thailand  along \nNR5  has  expanded  significantly  over  the  past  few  years.  The  value  of  recorded  cross-border \ntrade \nfrom \n$27.0 million in 1992 to $238.0 million in 1999, an annual compound growth rate of 36%. Much \nof this growth was caused by the rerouting of trade from other entry points to Poipet, reflecting \nthe improvements in road conditions on NR5 and the restoration of peace in the area. Thus, the \nshare of total bilateral trade routed through Poipet increased from 14% in 1992 to 65% in 1999 \n(Figure  1).  Cross-border  overland  tourism  from  Thailand  has  also  become  more  common  in \nrecent years, with 73,000 persons passing through the border into Cambodia during the first 6 \nmonths  of  2002,  a  figure  that  is  expected  to  increase  significantly  when  the  road  is  improved. \nNR6 takes the network through Siem Reap, which is the site of Angkor Wat, a World Heritage \n\nthe  Poipet-Aranyaphathet  border  crossing \n\nincreased  considerably \n\nthrough \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  1992.

The  Five-Year  Road  Master  Plan  (2000\u20132005)  has  three  main \naims:  (i) to  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  the  main  national  roads,  thereby  improving  land \ntransport throughout the nation; (ii) to build road links to neighboring countries, thereby opening \nup some of the more remote areas of the country to international trade and tourism; and (iii) to \ndevelop  a  sustainable  road  maintenance  program,  thereby  ensuring  that  investment  in  road \nrehabilitation and reconstruction generates sustainable benefits. \n \n8. \nSupportive and additional aims are to (i) provide all provincial capitals, tourist areas, and \nmajor  growth  areas  with  all-weather  road  access;  (ii) ease  traffic  congestion  in  and  around \nPhnom Penh by undertaking a study of options for traffic calming solutions (such as bypasses), \nwith  a  view  to  formulating  and  implementing  appropriate  projects;  (iii) undertake  emergency \nrehabilitation of provincial roads in order to better link provincial towns with district capitals and \nurban areas; (iv) make supplementary investments in bridges and ferry sites; (v) ensure as far \nas  possible  that  the  maintenance  of  designated  national  and  provincial  roads,  bridges,  and \nferries,  and  the  control  and  regulation  of  vehicles,  be  self-financing  from  vehicle  registration \ncharges,  tolls,  international  transit  charges,  fuel  levies,  or  other  related  taxes  and  duties;  and \n(vi) ensure  that  as  far  as  possible,  all  provincial,  urban,  and  rural  roads  are  maintained  from \nlocally generated funds. \n \n9. \nA  draft  Traffic  Act  is  pending  at  the  National  Assembly  and  a  proposed  subdecree  on \nroads  is  being  developed  by  MPWT.  The  draft  Act  contains  penal  provisions,  traffic  rules, \ntechnical standards for signs and signals, technical standards for vehicle components, and other \n\n\f4 \n\nelements.  However,  there  are  no  guidelines  for  road  construction  and  repair,  road  transport, \ndriver training, the information system, and other important issues that should be included in the \nsubdecree.  Given  the  fact  that  motorization  and  road-borne  trade  are  increasing  significantly, \nthe  road  sector  will  be  the  primary  focus  of  policy,  legislative  and  institutional  support,  and  as \nsuch  will  require  an  effective  enabling  environment  that  should  be  provided  through  the  Road \nAct.  \n \n\n4. \n\nPoverty in Northwestern Cambodia \n\nThe provinces of Siem Reap, Banteay Meanchey, and Oddar Meanchey in northwestern \n10. \nCambodia, where the Project is located, have received minimal development assistance in the \npast  because  of  war  and  insecurity,  and  suffer  from  a  high  incidence  of  poverty  and \nvulnerability,  as  shown  in  a  1999  World  Food  Program  poverty  mapping  study.  Poverty  is \nwidespread  in  the  area  with  severe  problems  of  accessibility  during  the  rainy  season.  This  is \nespecially  evident  for  Oddar  Meanchey.  The  study  suggests  that  no  less  than  60%  of \nhouseholds suffer from food deficiency. Although there is some scope for foraging, hunting, and \ngathering to supplement precarious livelihoods, most households find their food stocks depleted \nwithin  4  months  of  harvest.  It  is  estimated  that  40\u201360%  of  households  are  below  the  official \npoverty line. Government services, such as health and education, rarely reach the interior and \ntend to be restricted to peri-urban areas. Family spacing is nonexistent and reproductive health \nservices are largely inaccessible due to the widely dispersed nature of the population and long \ntravel distances, especially within Oddar Meanchey. \n \n11. \nThe provinces of Siem Reap, Banteay Meanchey, and Oddar Meanchey are some of the \nmost  backward  in  Cambodia  in  terms  of  farming  practices,  physical  infrastructure,  and  social, \nhealth,  and  utility  services.  Drinking  water  is  usually  obtained  from  rainwater  stored  in  open \ndepressions,  clay  pots,  or  from  bore-wells;  latrines  are  virtually  nonexistent.  Clinics  and \nhospitals  are  located  in  the  district  headquarters,  entailing  long  travel  times  and  high  costs. \nWhile many households have cattle for tillage and transport, motorcycles and television sets are \nvery few. Generally, housing conditions are very poor, especially along NR56 and NR68 and in \nareas  further  away  from  the  main  centers.  Access  to  basic  health  and  education  services  is \nfragmentary,  owing  to  the  relative  remoteness  of  the  villages  and  populations  living  in  the \nnorthwestern area served by NR56 and NR68. Road conditions are extremely poor with virtually \nall  bridges  broken  or  unusable.  Owing  to  lack  of  continuous  access,  the  traffic  consists  of \nmotorbikes,  animal  carts,  and  taxi-vans.  Transport  costs  are  predictably  high  as  travel  time  is \nlong. \n \n12. \nThe  overall  poverty  estimate  for  the  project  area  is  about  40%.  However,  there  are \nsignificant variations, with the areas serviced by better roads displaying the lowest poverty level \n(25%), while NR56 and areas serviced by poor roads have very high poverty levels (over 60%). \nThus,  quite  apart  from  relatively  high  poverty  levels  in  the  project  area  compared  with  the \nnational situation, there are deep pockets of extensive poverty, much of which is related to the \nrelative physical remoteness and poor infrastructure in the area. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nAsian Development Bank\u2019s Goals and Objectives for Cambodia \n\nThe  three  priority  areas  of  the  ADB  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)\u2014rural \n13. \neconomic  development,  human  resources  development,  and  private  sector  development\u2014and \nthe  10  sectors  through  which  the  strategy  is  to  be  implemented,  remain  valid  in  light  of  the \ncurrent  development  situation.  The  2001  and  2002  operational  programs  constituted  a  first \n\n\f5 \n\nphase  of  implementing  the  strategy.  The  program  of  lending  and  nonlending  assistance  for \n2003\u20132005  constitutes  a  second  phase,  substantially  completing  considerable  work  in  the  10 \nsectors.  The  CSP  has  been  further  strengthened  by  provision  of  a  sharper  focus  on  the \nimplications of the state reform program\u2014especially decentralization of public administration\u2014\nand by enhancement of the poverty impact of sector interventions to support the Government\u2019s \ngoal  of  achieving  its  poverty  reduction  targets,  in  light  of  projected  gross  domestic  product  \ngrowth.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n14. \nGiven the limited duration of ADB assistance to Cambodia, it is still somewhat early to \nsystematically  assess  the  impact  of  its  interventions.  However,  as  ADB  was  the  first  major \nfunding agency to return to Cambodia, its interventions came at a critical time and undoubtedly \nhave had a positive impact. The Special Rehabilitation Assistance Loan4 is the only project that \nhas been postevaluated. The project, which was rated successful, had several components to \nsupport the transport, energy, agriculture, and education sectors. The performances of both the \nGovernment and ADB were also rated successful. \n \n15. \nFor  the  road  sector,  the  principal  lesson  thus  far  is  that  of  the  need  to  develop  more \neffective  network  planning  mechanisms,  including  road  classification  and  referencing,  road \nmanagement  systems  (operations  and  maintenance),  greater  involvement  of  private  sector \ninterests, development of the domestic contracting industry, standardization of procedures (such \nas  procurement  and  tendering  documentation,  financial  management,  and  performance \nmonitoring), and standardization of road designs. With increasing numbers and sophistication of \ncontracts,  contract  management  will  have  to  be  significantly  improved  through  appropriate \ntraining  for  officials  and  contractors.  More  effective  supervision  of  contractor  performance  will \nimprove  road  quality,  which  itself  needs  improvement  in  the  areas  of  site  supervision  and \nmaterials testing standards. At the institutional level, MPWT needs to make more effort to retain \ntrained staff for effective project supervision. Enforcement of truck overloading policies needs to \nbe strengthened, as well as roadworthiness inspections and collection of penalties. Road safety \nimprovements  should  be  addressed  with  more  extensive  awareness  and  driver  training \ncampaigns. Mine awareness programs should also be expanded.  \n \n16. \nRecent experience with resettlement issues has provided valuable lessons, including the \nnecessity  for  (i) properly  compensating  people  for  loss  of  land  use  in  the  right-of-way  (ROW) \nand  appropriately  valued  replacement  cost  for  structures;  (ii) providing  compensation  for  lost \nreporting; \nincome; \n(iv) separating  resettlement  planning  and  implementation  from  regulatory  agencies;  and \n(v) building local capacity for resettlement planning, implementation, and monitoring. \n \n\ninternal  and  external  monitoring  and \n\n(iii) appropriately  conducted \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nThe  primary  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  promote  general  economic  growth  at \n17. \nsubregional and national levels and to promote economic and social development in the project \narea  of  influence.  The  Project  will  (i) promote  economic  growth  at  subregional  and  national \nlevels  by  reducing  the  cost  and  increasing  the  reliability  of  transport,  including  transport  for \ntourism,  which  is  a  major  growth  industry;  (ii) reduce  poverty  by  providing  all-year,  all-weather \naccess to employment opportunities, markets, and growth centers; (iii) improve social conditions \n                                                 \n4  ADB.  1992.

NR5  and  NR6  connect  three  major  towns  in  the  area:  Siem  Reap, \nSisophon (both provincial capitals), and Poipet (the primary border crossing between Cambodia \nand Thailand). From Poipet there is a direct highway connection to Bangkok, and from Sisophon \nand Siem Reap there are direct highway connections to Phnom Penh, running east and west of \nTonle Sap, respectively. Siem Reap on NR6 is the center of an established and growing tourism \nindustry based on Angkor Wat and many other historic temples in the area. NR6 connects Siem \nReap  to  the  southern  part  of  Viet  Nam  through  Phnom  Penh,  while  NR5  also  links  Cambodia \nwith Thailand and southern Viet Nam.  \n \n19. \nThe  road  traverses  primarily  agricultural  land.  Only  a  few  villages  are  located  at  the \nroadside, the majority of the population living in the hinterland along the secondary and tertiary \nroad  network.  The  agricultural  potential  of  the  area  is  high,  but  presently  underutilized  due  to \nwidespread  unexploded  ordnance  (UXO),  which  also  hinders  the  resettlement  of  people \ndisplaced  during  the  years  of  civil  strife.  The  ongoing  ADB-financed  Northwestern  Rural \nDevelopment Project (NRDP),5 which is located in the general area of influence of the proposed \nProject, includes a significant component of rural roads rehabilitation. The rural roads all link into \nthe project road, which form the spine of the local road networks and provide the connection to \nhigher-growth  centers.  Full  realization  of  the  intended  benefits  from  NRDP  will  depend  on \nrehabilitation of the highways that provide access. \n \n20. \nThe  current  condition  of  the  project  roads  is  very  poor,  with  most  of  the  pavements \ncompletely  failed  and  covered  with  graded  dirt.  These  sections  of  the  road  are  impassable \nduring  the  wet  season.  The  road  has  a  large  number  of  cross-drainage  structures  (over  100 \nculverts and 50 bridges) that are located mainly between Sisophon and Siem Reap. The road \nborders  the  Tonle  Sap  floodplain  and  is  crossed  by  a  large  number  of  tributaries  to  the  Tonle \nSap.  Beyond  Sisophon  the  land  is  elevated  and  dry.  Most  bridges  were  either  severely \ndamaged  or  demolished  during  the  years  of  civil  strife  and  many  have  been  replaced  with \ntemporary Bailey bridges. The Bailey bridges are narrow and many are partly failed. The road \nembankment  is  significantly  deteriorated  in  some  places.  During  the  wet  season,  certain \nsections are often inundated. \n \n21. \nPresent traffic on the project road consists primarily of pedestrians, cycles, motorcycles, \ncars  and  pickups,  trucks  and  heavy  truck-trailer  combinations,  and  some  buses.  The \nrehabilitated road will generate significant traffic serving local traffic needs, the rapidly growing \ntourism centered around Siem Reap, and subregional trade between Cambodia and Thailand. \n                                                 \n5  ADB.  2001.

Manila. \n\n\f7 \n\nTrade  with  Thailand  via  Poipet  has  been  growing  rapidly  in  recent  years,  in  step  with  the \nongoing  rehabilitation  of  NR5  between  Sisophon  and  Phnom  Penh,  and  the  termination  of \nhostilities  in  the  area  in  1998.  The  compound  annual  growth  rate  for  cross  border  trade  via \nPoipet was 36% between 1992 and 1999. Customs data for Poipet border crossing indicate that \nimport trade averaged approximately 584,000 tons per annum in 2000 and 2001,6 generating an \nestimated 55% of current truck traffic on NR5 between Poipet and Sisophon. \n \n22. \nThe  output  of  the  Project  will  be  a  two-lane  asphalt  concrete  carriageway  with  paved \nshoulders  to  safely  accommodate  light  motorized  and  nonmotorized  traffic.  The  road  cross-\nsection will meet the Regional Highway standards agreed by the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations  (ASEAN)  member  countries.  Although  the  road  alignment  will  be  generally  retained, \nhorizontal  and  vertical  curves  at  bridge  approaches  will  be  improved.  The  road  will  have \nadequate drainage structures and the embankment will be raised to 20-year event flood level. \nThe design will ensure that possible adverse impacts of road drainage arrangements on water \nmanagement  on  adjacent  agricultural  land  will  be  minimized.  Safety  improvement  measures \nappropriate  for  accident  black  spots,  such  as  schools,  will  be  incorporated  during  the  detailed \ndesign.  Cross-border  facilities  will  be  constructed  in  Poipet,  which  will  provide  single-stop, \nsingle-window  facilities  for  vehicles.7  Weigh  stations  will  be  constructed  on  NR5  in  Poipet  and \non NR6 in Siem Reap to deter overloaded traffic. \n \n23. \nThe Project has sought opportunities to address gender concerns in road construction-\nrelated  activities.  In  civil  works  construction  contracts,  contractors  will  be  required  not  to \ndiscriminate against the employment and wages of women in the road construction labor force. \nContractors  will  also  be  required  to  ensure  that  adequate  health  and  sanitation  facilities  are \navailable to women workers. \n \n\nb. \n\nNR56 and NR68 \n\nThe Project will reconstruct about 50 bridges on the provincial roads NR56, connecting \n24. \nSisophon  to  Samrong  (114 km),  and  NR68,  connecting  Samrong  to  Kralanh  (79 km),  which \nforms  a  loop  of  about  200 km  to  the  north  of  NR6.  A  road  north  of  Samrong  links  with  the \nnational border with Thailand. In addition to Samrong, the road traverses farm villages including \nThmor  Pouk  and  Banteay  Chhmar  on  NR56,  and  Chong  Kai  and  Srei  Snam  on  NR68.  The \npavement  of  NR56  and  NR68  is  natural  gravel  with  cobblestones  embedded  in  the  laterite \nsurface.  The  formation  is  typically  7\u20138 meters  (m)  wide.  There  are  some  50  bridges  on  the \nroute,  distributed  approximately  one  third  on  NR56  and  two  thirds  on  NR68.  Most  of  the \nstanding bridges are in extremely poor condition and several others have collapsed. The critical \nneed for accessibility on the route is the replacement of all bridges. Traffic is light on NR56 and \nvery  light  on  NR68  due  to  disconnection  at  collapsed  bridges.  However,  traffic  will  increase \nwhen  access  is  restored  under  the  Project.  Two-lane  bridges  or  culverts  of  10 m  width  will \nreplace  all  the  existing  bridges.  To  avoid  entry  of  overloaded  trucks,  weigh  stations  will  be \nconstructed in the vicinity of the intersection of NR56, NR68, and the road leading to the border \nwith Thailand. \n \nRehabilitation of the pavements of NR56 and NR68 is not envisaged under the Project. \n25. \nTo  ensure  all-year,  all-weather  access,  the  construction  of  embankments  and  pavements  and \nthe  improvement  of  drainage  may  be  needed  at  certain  sections.  MPWT  will  undertake  those \nworks and continue to provide maintenance works, such as periodic regraveling and grading of \n\n                                                 \n6  Source: Cambodia Customs and Excise Department, Banteay Meanchey Province. \n7  Agreement  Between  and  Among  the  Governments  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  the  Kingdom  of \nThailand,  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam,  and  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Facilitation  of  Cross-Border \nTransport of Goods and People, 29 November 2001 (amendment to 26 November 1999 Agreement). \n\n\f8 \n\nthe road surface after each rainy season, and cleaning of the existing culverts before each rainy \nseason. \n \n\n2. \n\nResettlement Plan \n\n The  resettlement  study  (presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A)  has  shown  that  the \n26. \nProject  will  cause  minimal  land  acquisition  impact  as  it  will  follow  the  existing  alignment  with \nsome widening to about 11 m carriageway-shoulder width. The road is contained within a 60 m-\nwide ROW that is reasonably well demarcated and respected for the majority of its length. The \nmain  land  use  along  the  corridor  of  impact  (COI) is  agriculture.  The  Project  will  require  either \ntemporary (during construction) or permanent land acquisition of approximately 60 hectares (ha) \nof a combination of 70% agricultural, 10% residential/commercial, and 10% unused land along \nNR5  and  NR6,  affecting  approximately  2,000  farmers,  240  houses  and  house-shops,  300 \nroadside  stalls,  as  well  as  fruit  and  shade  trees.  The  structures  are  largely  made  of \nsemipermanent  and  movable  materials  (e.g.,  wood,  bamboo,  or  light  materials)  and  consist  of \nvarious types of shops. Some irrigation canals will be disrupted and there will be temporary land \nloss during construction. Improvements to NR56 and NR68 will involve only replacement of all \nof the bridges for which there will be very minimal, if any, land acquisition. Any land acquisition \nfor  NR56  and  NR68  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  approved  resettlement  plan.  A \ndetailed  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  in  line  with  government  and  ADB  policies  and \nprocedures. A summary of the resettlement plan is provided in Appendix 4.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPoverty Reduction Monitoring Program \n\n27. \nA detailed socioeconomic survey (presented in Supplementary Appendix B) was carried \nout to establish baseline conditions to enable poverty monitoring and impact evaluation studies \nto  be  conducted  during  and  after  project  completion.  The  baseline  data  include  demographic \nand  health  information,  with  a  particular  focus  on  HIV/AIDS.  The  survey  has  established \nbenchmarks in terms of land and asset ownership, labor use, migration patterns, incomes and \nexpenditures, access to services and credit, farm production, tenancy arrangements, conditions \nof transport infrastructure, and access to common property resources.  \n \nUnder  the  Project,  two  surveys  will  be  carried  out.  The  first  survey  will  be  conducted \n28. \nwithin 2 years of initiation of construction while the second survey will be conducted at project \ncompletion. The first survey will allow monitoring of socioeconomic conditions along the lines of \nthe baseline survey, and the second will enable impact assessment analysis. The objective of \nthe  surveys  is  to  generate  panel  data  at  two  points  in  time  to  enable  comparison  with  the \nbaseline. In principle, the methodology followed should be similar to the baseline approach. This \nwill  involve  division  of  the  project  area  into  three  categories  for  sampling  purposes:  (i)  in  the \nvicinity of a good section of the primary road, (ii) in areas close to a poor section of the primary \nroad, and (iii) areas within the influence area of the loop section. Villages along a 3\u20135 km radius \nfrom the road sections will be identified and 10\u201320% sampled at the first stage. A total of 250\u2013\n300  households  are  planned  sampled  at  random  from  those  villages.  It  is  expected  that  the \nGovernment  will  conduct  a  comprehensive  follow-up  survey  after  2\u20133  years  of  completion  of \ncivil works to establish in more detail the poverty reduction impacts of the Project.  \n \n\n\f9 \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n\n1. \n\nStrengthening the Ministry of Public Works and Transport \n\na. \n\nStrategic Planning and Project Management in the Ministry of Public \nWorks and Transport \n\n \n29. \nThe current planning process at MPWT needs considerable strengthening. Governance \nis obviously an issue. The Department of Planning (DOP) prepares overall plans by compiling \nproposals  received  by  the  planning  units  from  other  MPWT  departments.  However,  these \nproposals  are  not  based  on  proper  evaluation  processes,  particularly  economic  or  social \nanalyses. ADB earlier provided technical assistance8 for training to core DOP staff in transport \nplanning and related subjects to equip them with basic skills in undertaking strategic, multimodal \nplanning on a self-sustaining basis and to develop sector policies. Although some capacity was \ndeveloped among DOP staff, DOP has had few opportunities to use the acquired skills owing to \nbudget  and  administrative  constraints,  and  to  turnover  of  trained  staff.  The  core  planning \nfunctions,  i.e.,  policy  formulation,  traffic  forecasting,  preparing  investment  programs,  annual \nbudgeting, and database development and maintenance, are not being implemented, owing to \norganizational inefficiencies, the location of DOP in the organizational hierarchy, and a shortage \nof  funds  to  implement  change.  Appendix  5  shows  the  current  MPWT  organization  chart.  The \nchart sets DOP at the bottom of the hierarchy within the General Department of Administrative \nServices, resulting in a weakening of DOP authority and communication flows to other MPWT \ndepartments.  \n \n30. \nThere is thus a clear need to move DOP from the General Department of Administrative \nServices  closer  to  MPWT  management,  so  increasing  direct  accountability  to  the  Minister  of \nPublic  Works  and  Transport.  Being  directly  accountable  to  the  Minister,  DOP\u2019s  primary  role \nshould  be  to  provide  technical  advice  to  MPWT  management  on  matters  related  to  policy \ndevelopment and strategic planning. \n \n31.  Major  rehabilitation  works  have  been  financed  by  external  funds,  and  the  projects  are \nimplemented by ad hoc project management units (PMUs)/project implementation units (PIUs) \nthat  are  not  formally  within  the  MPWT  organizational  structure.  The  current  management \napproach  is  fragmented,  and  does  not  create  effective  responsibility  and  accountability  in \nMPWT.  The  establishment  of  PMUs/PIUs  for  each  individual  project  results  in  difficulty  in \nmonitoring, adopting uniform technical standards, and sharing experiences on matters related to \nprocurement and project management. An alternative solution for effectively managing external \nagency-funded projects will be formulated through reorganizing MPWT to address the emerging \nissues of coordination, efficiency, transparency, sustainability, and governance. \n \n\nb. \n\nThe Reorganization Process  \n\n32. \nUnder  current  government  procedures,  the  overall  organization  structure  of  each \nministry  and  the  responsibilities  of  its  general  directorates  and  departments  have  to  be \napproved  by  the  Council  of  Ministers  through  a  subdecree.  A  radical  change  in  MPWT\u2019s \norganizational  structure  is  not  realistic  in  the  short  term,  given  the  complexity  of  needed \norganizational reforms. To initiate the process of developing the new reorganization, MPWT will \nundertake the reform process in three phases, as described below. The general process, which \nshould  benefit  from  consultations  with  ADB  and  other  development  partners,  is  presented  in \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB.1995. Technical Assistance to Cambodia for Developing Planning Capacity in the MPWT. Manila. \n\n\f10 \n\nAppendix 6. In parallel, a social and environment division will be established within 4 months of \nloan effectiveness, and will become fully functional within 6 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n\ni. \n\nPhase 1 \n\nIn  the  first  phase,  a  high-level  Interministerial  Committee  for  Reorganization  (ICR), \n33. \nchaired  by  the  Minister  of  Public  Works  and  Transport,  and  comprising  representatives  from \nMPWT,  State  Secretariat  of  Public  Functions,  Council  for  Administrative  Reform  (Office  of  the \nCouncil  of  Ministers),  and  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  will  be  set  up  prior  to  loan \neffectiveness.  The  secretariat  of  the  ICR  will  be  DOP,  with  the  director  of  DOP  appointed  as \nsecretary of the secretariat. The primary function of the ICR is to review and advise on reform \ndirections proposed by MPWT. The ICR will prepare quarterly progress reports until submission \nof  the  final  report  to  the  Council  of  Ministers.  The  Project  provides  $0.5 million  in  consulting \nservices  to  support  MPWT  in  the  reform  process,  and  may  include  personnel  policies,  legal \nframeworks, financial management, procurement processes, project performance management, \nstandardization  of  technical  and  procedural  manuals,  and  concession  and  privatization \nframeworks. \n \n\nii. \n\nPhase 2 \n\n34. \nAs a first step in the overall reorganization process, DOP will be repositioned to act as \nan effective secretariat to the ICR. The ICR will begin by agreeing on the role and functions of a \nstrengthened  DOP  accountable  to  MPWT  management.  The  ICR  will  (i) define  the  role  and \nresponsibilities of each division within DOP; (ii) identify the types and numbers of management \nand staff positions; (iii) assess current staff capabilities; and (iv) assign staff to positions, and if \nneeded,  request  staff  transfer  from  the  other  departments  of  MPWT  to  fill  the  positions.  The \ncore functions of the repositioned DOP are generally indicated in Appendix 7. Within 6 months \nof loan effectiveness. The proposal for the repositioned DOP will be submitted by the Minister, \nMPWT to the Council of Ministers. The repositioned DOP will be established and fully functional \nwithin 10 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n\niii. \n\nPhase 3 \n\nto  execute \n\nthe  mandate,  and \n\nIn  parallel  with  the  repositioning  of  DOP,  and  with  the  assistance  of  consultants \n35. \n(institutional  specialists,  human  resources  specialists,  and  others  as  may  be  necessary  and \nidentified by the ICR) engaged under the Project, the ICR will: (i) using consulting services, as \nneeded  and  appropriate,  and  earlier  organizational  studies  prepared  under  various  external \nagency-financed  technical  assistance  activities,  and  other  government  documents,  identify  an \nappropriate  mandate  for  MPWT  and  define  the  functions  necessary  for  MPWT  to  accomplish \nthat mandate; (ii) define the role and responsibilities of each general directorate and department \nrecommend  creating  separate \nneeded \nagencies/ministerial  bodies  that  would  more  effectively  address  transport  and  public  works \nrequirements, e.g., civil aviation authority, inland waterways agency; (iii) develop organizational \nstructures for each agency, particularly the reorganized MPWT-based agency, including lines of \ncommunication and reporting. \n \n36. \nIn the reorganization process, the ICR will take into account the need to set up project \nmanagement  departments  in  the  structures  to  be  defined,  given  the  continuing  level  of \nexternally financed activities and the need to coordinate those properly and establish common \npractices  and  procedures,  as  appropriate,  in  areas  such  as  procurement  and  technical \nstandards.  An  overall  policy  reform  and  institutional  development  matrix  is  presented  in \nAppendix 8. \n\nif  necessary, \n\n\f11 \n\nThe  proposed  organizational  structure  of  MPWT  will  be  endorsed  by  the  ICR  and \n\n \n37. \nsubmitted to the Council of Ministers within 24 months of loan effectiveness.  \n \n\n2. \n\nRoad Network Maintenance Strategy and Funding Mechanism \n\nthe \n\ninstitutional  structure \n\n38. \nAlthough  a  first  step  has  been  made  by  establishing  the  Fund  for  Repair  and \nMaintenance of Roads (FRMR), it will be necessary for the Government to set up a road fund \nand  a  road  management  board  to  establish  fully  effective  road  maintenance  financing \nmechanisms.  Similar  approaches  are  under  consideration  and  development  by  neighboring \ncountries,  namely  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  and  Viet Nam.  Drawing \nfrom experience gained to date in the Mekong region as well as in other countries throughout \nAfrica, South America, and several republics of the former Soviet Union, earmarking of a portion \nof road user charges or setting up a road fund is by itself no solution. While this may solve part \nof the problem of security of funding source and dependability of funds for maintenance, a road \nfund  is  not  a  sufficient  condition  on  its  own  for  guaranteeing  a  sustainable  maintenance \nprogram.  Clear  institutional  processes  are  required  to  plan  and  prioritize  maintenance  works \neffectively, as well as effective procedures for managing and disbursing funds.  \n \n39. \nThe  strategy  for  developing  a  more  effective  road  fund  will  require  (i) broadening  and \ndeepening  the  revenue  base  for  the  FRMR,  (ii) ensuring  accessibility  to  fund  resources,  and \nfor  planning  and  delivery  of \n(iii) strengthening  and  building \nmaintenance services. As an initial step, the General Department of Public Works within MPWT, \ntogether  with  the  Contracts  Office  within  the  Road  Infrastructure  Department,  could  assume  a \ndriving  role  with  technical  assistance,  training,  and  support.  The  unit  would  evolve  into  a \nprofessional  procurement  structured  group  as  institutional  capacity  is  built  up,  with  mirrored \nreplication  in  the  provincial  departments.  The  intention  is  to  reduce  large  overhead  costs  of \ntraditional  bureaucratic  structures  and  provide  incentives  to  local  contractors  to  develop \nexpertise  and  invest  in  their  own  equipment  as  the  market  for  contracted  maintenance  and \nconstruction builds. Deepening the revenue base of the FRMR should include increases in the \ntransport  tax,  particularly  for  heavy  commercial  vehicles,  annual  vehicle  registration  fees, \ngradual adjustments to fuel levies, and properly designed toll operations.  \n \n40.  While  developing  the  structure  of  a  more  substantive  and  effective  road  maintenance \nfund, which will likely take several years, it is important to ensure that the current funding levels \nand allocations are maintained and applied to maintenance, with no diversion to nonroad sector \nactivities. This will require that the FRMR be dedicated solely to the road network, with principal \nallocation to the primary and secondary roads, and allowing for a specified allocation (10% as \nidentified  under  the  Poverty  Partnership  Agreement)  to  the  rural  roads.  The  FRMR  thus \nbecomes a network-directed source of maintenance financing.  \n \n41. \nTo support the Government\u2019s objective of promoting involvement of local contractors in \nroadworks,  international  contractors  are  being  encouraged  to  use  local  subcontractors  for \ncertain  types  of  works,  with  a  view  to  enabling  those  local  contractors  to  undertake  routine \nmaintenance  of  roads.  Provisions  for  training  local  contractors  and  government  officials  in  the \nplanning  and  execution  of  contract-based  road  maintenance  will  be  included  in  a  proposal  for \nmainstreaming  poverty  reduction  approaches,  that  will  be  submitted  to  the  Japan  Fund  for \nPoverty Reduction (JFPR), supplemented by some training under the construction supervision \nservices.  The  outputs  envisage  MPWT  staff  capable  of  planning,  tendering  for,  and  managing \nroutine  road  maintenance  contracts,  and  local  contractors  capable  of  bidding  for,  contracting, \nand implementing such contracts. \n \n\n\f12 \n\n3. \n\nHIV/AIDS Program \n\n42. \nHIV/AIDS is spreading in Cambodia. HIV was first detected in Cambodia in 1991 and the \nfirst AIDS case diagnosed in 1993. In less than a decade, the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Cambodia \nbecame one of the most serious and fastest rising in the region. The main mode of transmission \nis currently through heterosexual sex. In 2000, HIV rates among sex workers ranged from 7.7% \nto  58%  across  provinces  with  an  average  of  31%  among  direct  commercial  workers  and  16% \namong indirect sex workers. Sexually transmitted infection (STI) care and related interventions, \ncombined  with  100%  condom  use  promotion  and  outreach  for  population  groups  in  high-risk \nsituations, have been identified as key components of HIV prevention in the National Strategy \nfor  Prevention  and  Care  of  HIV/AIDS  and  STIs  for  2001\u20132005.  This  strategy  has  been \nimplemented  in  the  pilot  province  of  Kampong  Cham.  Banteay  Meanchey  is  one  of  five  new \ntarget provinces for the \u201cTriangle of HIV Prevention\u201d to be strengthened by the end of 2004. A \n2000 survey indicated that approximately 2.8% of all Cambodians were then infected with HIV. \n \n43. \nPMU,  with  advice  and  guidance  from  the  social  and  environment  unit  in  the  proposed, \nrepositioned Department of Planning of MPWT, will engage a suitably qualified agency (e.g., an \nNGO that is experienced in administering such programs in collaboration with MPWT) through \nlocal competitive bidding to implement a suitably designed campaign among road workers and \nin the local communities in the project-influenced area. The terms of reference for the executing \nagency includes using the \u201cToolkit for HIV Prevention\u201d developed under ADB financing for use \namong mobile populations in the GMS. \n \n\n4. \n\nCross-Border Facilities \n\nThe GMS Cross-Border Agreement (footnote 7) is intended to (i) facilitate cross-border \n44. \ntransport of goods and people among the countries in the subregion; (ii) harmonize legislation, \nregulations,  and  procedures  relating  to  cross-border  transport;  and  (iii) promote  multimodal \ntransport. Currently, there are four signatories\u2014Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \nThe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Myanmar have indicated their willingness to become \nsignatories. The Project links to the border crossing between Cambodia and Thailand at Poipet. \nThis crossing is included as a GMS pilot site at which streamlined crossing procedures will be \nestablished  to  facilitate  the  development  of  cross-border  trade  and  mobility.  The  Project \nincludes  funding  for  the  design  and  establishment  of  the  physical  facilities  required  for  single-\nstop, single-window procedures in Poipet.  \n \n\n5. \n\nMainstreaming  Poverty  Reduction  Approaches  into  the  National  Road \nNetwork \n\n45. \nThere are a number of poverty-oriented gaps in the Government\u2019s current road program. \nFirst,  there  is  a  need  to  connect  the  rural  roads  networks  to  the  national  road  network  by \nrehabilitating  the  intermediary  provincial  roads.  Second,  there  is  a  need  to  develop  more \nopportunities for and capacity of domestic private contractors who are capable and equipped to \ntake  on  construction  and  maintenance  work  on  the  national  and  provincial  roads.  Third,  more \nresearch  needs  to  be  done  on  road  technologies  best  suited  to  Cambodia  in  terms  of  directly \nand  indirectly  achieving  poverty  reduction  goals,  including  compilation  and  review  of \nexperiences from other countries. Finally, greater capacity is needed to train engineers, public \nsector  officials,  and  private  sector  contractors  and  consultants  in  road  technologies  and \nmanagement.  \n \n46. \nA project concept, Mainstreaming Poverty Reduction Approaches into the National Road \nNetwork  (MPRA),  has  been  proposed  for  grant  financing  under  JFPR  to  reduce  poverty  by \n\n\f13 \n\nmainstreaming  pro-poor  appropriate  technological  and  capability-building  approaches  into  the \nroad  development  programs  of  MPWT  and  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  (MRD).  The \nproject  will  work  toward  maximizing  the  input  of  local  entrepreneurs,  materials,  labor,  and \ningenuity.  Thus,  there  is  expected  to  be  both  an  immediate  direct  effect  on  income  through \nemployment and a long-term direct effect resulting from the provision of cost-effective tools for \nthe  management  of  the  road  network.  Reflecting  the  commitment  to  collaboration  between \nMPWT and MRD in their Joint Declaration of March 2000, a steering committee will be set up by \nJanuary 2003 cochaired by both Ministries to guide implementation of the proposed MPRA. \n \nThe  MPRA  is  expected  to  be  carried  out  in  collaboration  with  the  International  Labour \n47. \nOrganization  (ILO).  Currently,  ILO  is  implementing  a  program  of  successful  technical \ncooperation  projects  in  Cambodia  to  help  the  Government  maximize  potential  employment \nopportunities  in  the  infrastructure  development  program,  especially  in  the  construction  and \nmaintenance of the road network. Increased employment through the development of the road \nnetwork  can  be  achieved  through  the  use  of  labor-based  appropriate  technologies.  ADB  will \npartner  with  ILO  in  seeking  to  mainstream  employment-generating  approaches  within \ngovernment  agencies  such  as  MPWT,  MRD,  and  educational  institutes.  ILO  has  an  existing \npartnership  with  ADB  in  implementing  the  integrated  rural  accessibility  planning  component  in \nfour provinces under the ADB-financed Northwest Rural Development Project.  \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n48. \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $77.5 million equivalent. Foreign exchange \ncosts  are  estimated  at  $52.0 million  representing  67.1%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  local \ncurrency cost is estimated at $25.5 million equivalent representing 32.9% of the total cost. The \ncost estimates are shown in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 9. \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of SDR 37.885 million ($50.0 million equivalent) \n49. \nfrom  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  cover  82.7%  of  the  entire  foreign  cost  of  the  Project  and \n27.5% of the local currency costs. The OPEC Fund for International Development (OPEC Fund) \nhas  confirmed  cofinancing  of  the  proposed  ADB  loan.  The  OPEC  Fund  contribution  of \n$10.0 million  will  be  used  to  cover  the  remaining  foreign  exchange  requirements  ($9.0 million) \nand  part  of  the  local  currency  costs  ($1.0 million).  The  remaining  local  currency  cost  of  the \nProject ($17.5 million, 22.6% of total project costs) will be met by the Government from its own \nresources. \n \n50. \nThe Borrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia. The repayment period of the proposed \nloan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1.0% during \nthe grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The proceeds of the loan will be made available by the \nBorrower to the Executing Agency through budgetary allocations. ADB will administer the OPEC \nFund loan and for this purpose will enter into an agreement with the OPEC Fund. The terms of \nthe  OPEC  Fund  loan  are  maturity  of  20  years,  with  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum,  a \nservice  charge  of  1.0%  per  annum,  and  a  grace  period  of  5  years.

MPWT will be the Executing Agency for the Project. For project implementation, MPWT \nwill set up a project management unit (PMU), staffed with suitably qualified personnel who will \n\n\f15 \n\ncarry  out  their  tasks  under  the  general  guidance  of  the  director  general  of  the  General \nDepartment of Public Works. MPWT has substantial experience in implementing ADB-financed \nroad projects through four earlier activities. \n \n52.  MPWT  will  appoint  a  full-time  project  director  for  the  PMU,  supported  by  a  project \nmanager. MPWT will ensure that the persons appointed will be (i) senior officials with adequate \ntechnical and administration experience and qualifications acceptable to ADB, and (ii) assisted \nby  appropriate  and  adequate  technical  and  administrative  staff.  The  Government  will  exert  its \nbest endeavors to ensure that, subject to satisfactory performance, the initially appointed project \ndirector  and  project  manager  will  remain  in  the  position  for  the  duration  of  project \nimplementation.  The  project  director  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  implementation  of  the \nProject and will also act as coordinator for interministerial activities. The project manager will be \nresponsible for day-to-day operations under the Project. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n53. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  4  years.  The  Project  is  expected  to  become \neffective  in  February  2003,  and  civil  works  to  be  completed  by  31  December  2006.  The \nimplementation  schedule  is  presented  in  Appendix  10.  The  procurement  target  dates  are \npresented in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n54. \nProcurement  of  civil  works  for  the  project  roads  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement following international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures \nfor international contractors who may associate with local contractors in joint ventures. The civil \nworks will be carried out through four contract packages for ICB valued at about $17.7 million, \n$18.5 million, $14.7 million, and $7.5 million. The contract packages are presented in Appendix \n11.  The  bidding  documents  will  be  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  sample  bidding  documents,  and  will \ninclude clauses that reflect ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy. A summary of the design approach and \ntechnical standards for the roads and bridges is presented in Appendix 12.  \n \nIn  response  to  the  Government\u2019s  request,  ADB  has  approved  advance  procurement \n55. \naction,  including  selection  of  construction  supervision  services  (quality  and  cost-based \nselection),  prequalification  of  bidders,  preparation  of  ADB-approved  bidding  documents \n(including specifications), issuance of invitations to bid, evaluation of bids, and essential related \nactivities  up  to  the  award  of  contracts.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of \nadvance action does not in any way commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n56. \nA total of 200 person-months of international and 402 of domestic consulting inputs will \nbe required to support project implementation associated with the civil works. The consultants \nfinanced from ADB-administered funds will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. The outline terms of reference for construction supervision services are provided in \nAppendix  13.  Terms  of  reference  for  other  consulting  services,  such  as  those  associated  with \nreorganization, will be established during project implementation in consultation with ADB. \n \n\n\f16 \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n57. \nAn  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  and \ndetailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in \nthe  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  estimated  expenditures  for  6  months,  not  to  exceed \n$500,000.  The  account  will  be  established  with  a  reputable  commercial  bank  in  Cambodia \nacceptable  to  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedures  will  be  followed  for \nreimbursement of expenditures and for the liquidation of each imprest account for payments not \nexceeding  $50,000  equivalent  in  each  case.  Loan  disbursements  for  the  consulting  services \ncontracts that are to be procured through domestic and international selection will make use of \nthe direct payment procedures defined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n58.  MPWT will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and \nservices  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  financing  resources  received,  the  expenditures \nincurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. The accounts for all project expenditures will \nbe set up in accordance with consistent and sound accounting principles. Independent auditors \nacceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  consolidated  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements \nannually.  Unaudited  accounts  and  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  3 \nmonths, and audited accounts and financial statements not later than 9 months after the end of \nthe fiscal year to which they relate. \n \n59. \nThe  construction  supervision  consultant  will  submit  monthly  progress  reports  to  MPWT \nand ADB. MPWT will ensure that in the reports the consultant includes progress in civil works \nand disbursement, and the status of land acquisition, resettlement, environmental management, \ntraining, and any other activities identified in the terms of reference agreed with the construction \nsupervision consultant. \n \n60.  Within  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  civil  works,  MPWT  will  request  the \nconstruction supervision consultant to submit a project completion report in a format acceptable \nto MPWT and ADB. MPWT will monitor project preparation and implementation in accordance \nwith  the  implementation  schedule,  and  keep  ADB  informed  of  any  significant  deviations  that \ncould result in the schedule not being met. The form and content of the report will be in a format \nagreed with ADB during further processing of the Project.  \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n61.  MPWT,  assisted  by  the  construction  supervision  consultant,  will  develop  a  baseline  for \nperformance  monitoring  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Project  Performance  Management  System \nHandbook,  and  establish  systematic  project  performance  monitoring, \nincluding  benefit \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  The  required  surveys  will  be  conducted  prior  to  construction,  at \nproject midterm, and 6 months after project completion. The field information to be collected will \ninclude  (i) road  condition  and  road  roughness;  (ii) traffic  volume;  (iii) road  freight  rates  and \npassenger  fares;  (iii) prices  in  local  markets  for  agricultural  produce,  agricultural  inputs,  and \nbasic  household  goods;  and  (iv) any  other  essential  information,  including  socioeconomic \nindicators and key indicators. An indicative framework is presented in Supplementary Appendix \nD. The final form and content of reporting will be agreed with ADB during implementation of the \nProject. \n \n\n\f17 \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n62. \nIn addition to regular reviews by ADB, a midterm review of project implementation will be \ncarried  out  at  the  end  of  the  second  year.  Representatives  of  ADB,  the  Government,  and  any \ncofinancier  will  take  part  in  the  review.  The  review  will  allow  for  any  necessary  midcourse \ncorrections  to  ensure  successful  project  implementation  and  achievement  of  objectives.  On \ncompletion of the Project, a final review will be undertaken. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n63. \nThe  Project  will  promote  economic  growth  from  increased:  agricultural  production; \ntourism around the many historic temples throughout the project area; national and subregional \ntrade; and local employment creation, which will help combat widespread poverty, especially in \nthe  rural  areas.  The  Project  will  also  provide  efficient  all-weather  access  to  the  rural  areas  in \nthree  provinces  in  northwestern  Cambodia;  to  the  provincial  and  commercial  centers  at  Siem \nReap,  Sisophon,  and  Samrong;  and  to  Poipet,  Cambodia\u2019s  primary  border  crossing  point  with \nThailand.  By  reducing  road  transport  cost  and  improving  access  reliability,  the  Project  will \ngenerate  substantial  direct  economic  benefits  from  future  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs, \nlogistics,  and  road  maintenance.  It  will  also  relieve  the  isolation  of  remote  rural  areas  by \nreducing  travel  cost  and  time,  and  by  eliminating  seasonal  disruption  of  traffic  during  the  wet \nseason,  thus  enabling  continuous  trade  and  economic  exchange  and  undisrupted  access  to \nschools,9  health  services,10  and  other  services  in  rural  areas.  Finally,  the  Project  will  enhance \nthe impact of the Northwestern Rural Development Project by providing crucial interconnection \nof rural road networks without which \u201c. . . the country will remain fragmented and the rural roads \nwill, at best, lead to small provincial towns, isolating the poor population and limiting the benefits \nof  trade  available  to  them.\u201d11  The  main  benefits  of  the  Project  are  directly  related  to  traffic, \nincluding (i) savings in vehicle operating costs, (ii) savings in vehicle and passenger time costs, \nand  (iii) benefits  from  traffic  generated  by  the  reduction  in  transport  costs.  Additional  benefits \nderived  from  generated  traffic  include  (iv) producer  surplus  benefits,  (v) additional  income \nengendered by tourism, (vi) additional income from the increased agricultural activity stemming \nfrom the rehabilitation of the road, and (vii) social benefits arising from better access to schools, \nmedical  facilities,  and  other  social  services.  Derived  subregional  benefits  that  have  not  been \nquantified are long term, associated with the road\u2019s contribution to increased integration of the \neconomies of Thailand, Cambodia, and Viet Nam that, eventually, will enable the establishment \nof new and more efficient trading and transport patterns in the subregion. The economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) is 30.7%. The economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nB. \n\nSocial and Environmental Impacts \n\n1. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n64. \nTo maximize impacts on the poor, the Project has included the provision of all-year, all \nweather accessibility along NR56 and NR68, which form a loop in Oddar Meanchey. The loop \nwill directly feed into the Northwestern Rural Development Project and enhance the joint poverty \n\n                                                 \n9  Some schools in the project area are reported to close during the wet season due to the impassibility of the road \n\n10  Access  to  health  services  is  particularly  important  during  the  wet  season  where  the  project  area  is  severely \n\nnetwork. \n\naffected by malaria. \n\n11  ADB.  2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  for \n\nCambodia for the Northwestern Rural Development Project. Manila. \n\n\f18 \n\nimpacts  of  both  NR6  and  NR5  under  the  Project  and  the  impacts  identified  under  NRDP.  The \nProject  provides  for  an  integrated  approach  linking  feeder  roads  under  NRDP  with  provincial \nroads  and  the  national  highway.  Northwestern  Cambodia  and  the  project  area  are  potentially \nrich: there is abundant land, although large areas are yet to be cleared of mines; and there are \nvery  significant  forest  and  fisheries  resources.  The  population  would  benefit  immensely  from \nimproved accessibility, better market integration (including that of the labor market), and greater \naccess  to  services  and  resources.  Thus,  the  longer-run  outlook  for  the  project  area  is  very \npositive.  The  Project  will  seek  to  address  some  of  the  negative  aspects  of  cross-border  traffic \n(e.g., HIV/AIDS, drugs, and human trafficking)  and maximize the positive trade-enhancing and \nlabor-generating  impacts.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  presented  in \nAppendix 14. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n65. \nThe  Tonle  Sap  is  the  largest  freshwater  lake  in  Southeast  Asia.  It  covers  an  area  of \napproximately  250,000 ha  in  the  dry  season,  and  extends  to  1,000,000  ha  during  the  wet \nseason.  NR6  crosses  a  floodplain  that  is  linked  to  the  upper  part  of  the  Tonle  Sap.  Both  the \nfloodplain and the Tonle Sap are essential and linked components of the fisheries of the area. \nThe huge wetland system with its habitat diversity supports one of the most productive fisheries \nin Asia. The road linking Siem Reap and Poipet is situated at about 10 m above sea level on a \nlarge  area  of  the  central  plain  that  surrounds  Tonle  Sap.  The  plain  rises  imperceptibly  at  a \ngradient  of  about  0.03  %  until  it  encounters  the  lower  slopes  of  the  Chuor  Phnum  Dangrek \nrange that forms the divide between Cambodia and Thailand. The level of the Tonle Sap varies \nseasonally between 1.1 m and 10.0 m. As the road skirts the flood area, it is within the influence \narea, but is recognized as being in an area of least impact and hence generally environmentally \nbenign. \n \n66.  Major  potential  environmental  impacts  are  (i) impacts  on  drainage;  (ii) impacts  on \nfishery;  (iii) noise  and  dust;  (iv) mismanagement  of  construction  materials  and  sites;  and \n(v) health and safety. Mitigation measures have been identified and can be implemented without \ndifficulty.  The  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE),  together  with  an  appropriately  designed \nenvironmental management plan and monitoring programs, is considered sufficient to meet the \nenvironmental impact assessment requirements of the Project. The summary IEE is presented \nin Appendix 15. The full IEE is in Supplementary Appendix F. The Project will be implemented in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Infrastructure Projects. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\nThe  main  risks  associated  with  the  Project  are  (i) lower  than  expected  traffic  levels; \n67. \n(ii) delayed  and  suboptimal  performance  of  contractors  and  supervision;  (iii) delay \nin \nprocurement and local counterpart funding; (iv) lack of adequate counterpart staff; (v) delayed or \ninadequate execution of mitigating measures, notably resettlement and HIV/AIDS reduction, and \n(v) insufficient or late implementation of institutional strengthening required to enable adequate \nfuture  management  and  maintenance  of  the  roads.  After  construction,  the  main  risks  are \nassociated with the funding and management of maintenance of the roads, especially the loop \nroad,  which  will  require  regular  grading  and  regraveling.  Considering  the  Government\u2019s \ncommitment to the Project and the  project\u2019s high economic return, the integrated benefits and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs, given the likelihood of the risks occurring. \n \n\n\fV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n19 \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MPWT  have  given  the \n\n68. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i) \n\nEnvironmental Management. MPWT will ensure that adverse environmental impacts of \nthe  Project  will  be  minimized  through  the  appropriate  mitigation  measures  indicated  in \nthe IEE. MPWT will develop and implement an environmental management plan for the \nProject. MPWT will ensure that such problems as drainage, landslides, and erosion, as \nwell as the prevention of damage to the natural environment, receive due consideration \nand  that  the  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  IEE  are  incorporated  in  the  design, \nconstruction, and operation and maintenance of facilities supported by the Project. \n\nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  MPWT  will  be  responsible  for  the  acquisition  of \nthe land required for the Project and, if required, relocation and resettlement of project-\naffected  persons.  MPWT  will  ensure  that  such  land  acquisition,  compensation, \nrelocation,  and  resettlement  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  plan \nagreed  upon  between  the  Borrower  and  ADB,  the  Borrower\u2019s  laws,  regulations  and \nprocedures,  and  ADB\u2019s  requirements  as  defined  in  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement and the Handbook on Resettlement. In the case of discrepancies between \nthe  Borrower\u2019s  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures,  and  ADB\u2019s  requirements,  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements will apply.  \n\n \n(iii)  Maintenance  Management  System.  MPWT  will  ensure  that  the  road  maintenance \nmanagement system developed for Kampot, Kampong Cham, and Kandal provinces is \nadopted  as  the  general  approach  applicable  for  all  national  and  provincial  roads  under \nthe administration of MPWT. \n\nOperation  and  Maintenance  of  Project  Roads.  MPWT  will  be  responsible  for  the \noperation  and  maintenance  of  the  project  road  sections  through  proper  technical \nsupervision and adequate allocation of funds. MPWT will carry out routine and periodic \nmaintenance works on NR56 and NR68 to ensure all-year, all-weather access along the \nroute, especially in support of the infrastructure improvements under the Project. \n\nMaintenance  Financing.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate  funding  is  made \navailable  for  programmed  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  works  on  national  and \nprovincial roads from the existing Fund for Road Maintenance and Repair. In compliance \nwith  Prakas  399  and  Subdecree  39,  the  resources  of  the  Fund  for  Road  Maintenance \nand Repair will be used solely for the purposes of maintenance of the road network, with \nat least 10% reserved for rural roads. \n\nGovernance.  MPWT  will  (i) ensure  the  application  of  a  uniform  and  effective  financial \nand  accounting  system  that  meets  internationally  recognized  standards  and  (ii) apply \nprocurement  processes  on \ntransparency,  simplicity,  and  client \nresponsiveness.  \n\nthe  basis  of \n\n \n(vii)  Health Risks. MPWT will ensure that the civil works contracts include legally mandated \nprovisions  on  health,  sanitation,  and  appropriate  working  conditions, \nincluding \naccommodation,  where  appropriate,  for  construction  workers  at  campsites  during  the \nconstruction period.  \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\n \n(xi) \n\n \n\n(viii)  Labor  Laws.  MPWT  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works  contractors  (i) comply  with  all \napplicable  labor  laws,  including  elimination  of  gender-differentiated  wages  and  food \nrations, (ii) do not employ child labor in the construction activities, and (iii) seek to ensure \nthe maximum level of female participation in appropriate construction works. \n\nSocial  and  Environment  Division.  Within  4  months  of  the  Effective  Date,  MPWT  will \ncreate  a  Social  and  Environment  Division  in  the  Department  of  Planning  to  be \ntransferred  to  the  repositioned  Department  of  Planning  when  established.  The  Social \nand  Environment  Division  will  be  fully  functional  within  6  months  of  the  loan \neffectiveness. In coordination with relevant agencies, it will be responsible for social and \nenvironmental \nissues  across  all  sectors  under  MPWT\u2019s  authority,  particularly \nresettlement  planning  and  management,  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  efforts,  poverty \nand social impact assessments, labor practices and environmental management. \n\nRepositioned  Department  of  Planning.  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the \nproposal  for  a  repositioned  Department  of  Planning  will  be  submitted  by  the  Minister, \nMPWT to the Council of Ministers and the repositioned Department of Planning will be \nestablished and fully functional within 10 months of loan effectiveness. The Department \nof Planning or its successor, as applicable, will, among other things, be responsible for \ndeveloping,  reviewing,  negotiating,  recommending,  and  monitoring  all  concession \nagreements in the transport sector. \n\nICR Report. Within 24 months of loan effectiveness, the ICR will submit, for approval of \nthe Council of Ministers, a detailed report describing a new structure for MPWT, which \nmay involve setting out separate agencies from the existing organizational structure.  \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n69. \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  (i)   the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  37,885,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia,  for  the  Greater  Mekong

\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nSUBSECTOR ANALYSIS1 \n\nThe  road  network  in  Cambodia  covers  about  35,500  kilometers  (km),  including \n1. \napproximately 4,000 km of national roads, 3,500 km of provincial roads, and 28,000 km of rural \nand  strategic  roads.  The  roads  have  a  significant  number  of  bridges,  about  4,000  on  the \nnational  roads  alone.  The  primary  roads  consists  of  National  Roads  1-9,  which  are  national \nhighways that  extend from Phnom Penh to provincial capitals and the main access points to the \ncountry.  Lesser  national  roads  with  2-digit  numbers  are  provincial  highways  that  connect  the \nprovincial capitals and connect to minor border crossings and important domestic centers. The \nsecondary (provincial roads) and tertiary (rural and strategic roads) serve local transport needs. \nThe  road  network  was  mostly  built  before  1960.  The  general  design  standards  thus  cater  to \nlighter  traffic  than  current  loads,  with  many  existing  bridges  designed  for  gross  vehicle  road \nweights  of  10  tons,  well  below  the  current  standard  of  up  to  30  tons.  Bridges  have  often \ncollapsed  due  to  overloading.  Most  of  the  road  network  is  dilapidated  and  large  parts  of  the \ncountry are effectively isolated during the wet season. Most bridges are seriously damaged or \nfailed.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT)  considers  that  at  least  half  of  the \nprimary  road  network  and  nearly  all  the  secondary  and  tertiary  roads  are  in  need  of  urgent \nrepair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction. Road condition surveys in 2002 confirm that 28% of the \nnetwork is in good or fair condition, 35% in poor condition, 28% in bad condition, and 6% under \nreconstruction or rehabilitation. \n \n2. \nThe  unrehabilitated  sections  of  the  road  network  are  characterized  by  cracks,  ruts, \npotholes, edge failures, and pavement failures. The Government recognizes that the poor state \nof the country\u2019s road infrastructure poses a significant hindrance to economic development and \nemphasizes  the  urgency  of  reestablishing  the  country\u2019s  transport  infrastructure.  The  ongoing \nNational  Road  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Program  aims  to  rehabilitate  1,400 km  of \nnational  roads  by  the  year  2003,  thus  ensuring  that  approximately  44%  of  the  national  road \nnetwork  will  have  been  rehabilitated.  The  total  cost  of  road  rehabilitation  between  1993  and \n2003  has  been  estimated  at  approximately  $550.0 million  equivalent,  of  which  ADB  has \nfinanced  approximately  $230.0 million  equivalent.  Currently, \nfor \nmaintenance  and  rehabilitation  of  the  primary  and  secondary  road  network  is  estimated  at \napproximately $79.0 million per year, of which the Government provides approximately 20% and \ninternational sources the remainder. However, bringing the primary and secondary road network \ninto a fully functional and maintainable state within the foreseeable future will require increased \nlevels of investment\u2014and maintenance funding\u2014over the next 15\u201320 years. \n \nB. \n\ntotal  annual \n\nRoad Traffic \n\nfunding \n\nIn 2000, there were approximately 306,000 registered motor vehicles in the country, of \n3. \nwhich  approximately  73%  (226,200)  were  motorbikes;  23%  (68,900)  were  cars,  pickups,  and \nother light vehicles; and 4% (10,900) were trucks, buses, and other heavy vehicles. Compared \nwith 1996, the fleet of motorcycles has grown by an average of 8% per year and the fleet of cars \nand other light vehicles by an average of 16%. \n \n4. \nGiven the growing network of trafficable roads, the increasing number of motor vehicles \nin  the  country,  and  the  robust  growth  of  Cambodia\u2019s  economy,  traffic  have  developed  rapidly. \nRecent  traffic  counts  near  Siem  Reap  indicate  average  annual  traffic  growth  rates  of  16%  for \n\n                                                 \n1  Drawn from the Final Draft Transport Sector Strategy (ADB TA 3651-CAM) and Mission estimates. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n25 \n\nmotorbikes, 40% for light vehicles, and 195% for heavy vehicles between 1998 and 2000, albeit \nbased  on  low  initial  traffic  levels.  Similar  trends  are  noted  elsewhere  in  the  transport  system. \nThe  containerized  trade  through  Sihanoukville  Port  grew  by  an  average  of  32%  per  annum \nbetween 1994 and 2000, while the number of airline passengers passing through Phnom Penh \nairport  grew  at  a  more  moderate,  but  still  impressive,  annual  rate  of  9%  between  1995  and \n2000. \n \n5. \nA significant concern in Cambodia is the overloading of trucks, which leads to premature \ndeterioration  of  road  pavements  and  threatens  the  stability  of  the  many  bridges  designed  for \nlight  traffic.  The  legal  axle  load  in  Cambodia  is  10  tons.  There  is  evidence  that  some  trucks, \nparticularly those carrying cement, take on as much as 60 tons over a truck-trailer combination. \nA  survey  carried  out  in  1997  identified  an  average  axle  weight  of  10  tons  with  maximum  axle \nweights of up to 16 tons. Enforcement of axle load limits in Cambodia is weak, and it is essential \nto formulate an effective axle load control program to lead to greatly extended pavement life and \nlower  bridge-maintenance  costs.  This  is  particularly  important  for  bridges,  which  constitute  a \nvery large part of the network, as the passage of an exceptionally heavy vehicle could damage \nthe structure irreparably. \n \n6. \nSubdecree 744, Maximum Load Limit of Transport Vehicles Using the Road Network in \nCambodia, was approved by the Government on 3 September 1999. The Subdecree details the \nload limits and sets penalties for overloading. Such penalties should reflect actual damage and \ndiscourage  overloading.  Pavement  design  is  based  on  the  fact  that  vehicle  damage  to  a  road \ndepends  entirely  on  the  axle  load  of  those  vehicles.  The  penalties  listed  in  the  Subdecree \nincrease  only  linearly  with  increasing  loads,  but  damage  to  the  road  in  reality  increases \nexponentially as the load increases. Small increases in axle load above the legal limit of 10 tons \ncan result in a severe increase in damage to the road pavement. As far as practicable, penalties \nshould reflect the exponential increase in damage. \n \nAnother  issue  is  the  rapid  increase  in  road  traffic  accidents  that  has  accompanied  the \n7. \ngrowth in traffic in recent years, with the result that Cambodia today has a fatality rate (i.e., the \nnumber of traffic-related fatalities per year per 10,000 vehicles)2 of 12,3 compared with a fatality \nrate  of  3  in  1996.  The  trends  in  fatality  rates  and  fatality  risks  (i.e.,  traffic-related  fatalities  per \nyear per 10,000 persons) in Cambodia for the period 1994\u20132001 are shown in Figures A3.1 and \nA3.2.  Motorcycles  are  frequently  involved  in  traffic  accidents,  which  is  a  concern  due  to  their \nrole as public transport. The main causes of accidents in Cambodia are believed to be drunken \ndriving, lack of adherence by drivers to current regulations, and poor driving skills. The official \nfigures already indicate high fatality rates compared with other Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) member countries. In August 2001, the Economic and Social Commission for \nAsia and the Pacific set targets for fatality rates in all ASEAN member countries: (i) from 2001 of \nless than 10; (ii) from 2010, of less than 7; and (iii) from 2020, of less than 2. \n\n                                                 \n2  The fatality rate estimate excludes motorcycles, which are a major source of accidents and fatalities. \n3  The  current  traffic  fatality  rate  is  based  on  official  statistics  for  20  of  the  24  provinces,  including  Phnom  Penh. \n\nOfficial records before 2000 were kept only for Phnom Penh. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nNumber of vehicles\nFatality rate\n\nFigure A3.1.

Furthermore, the economic costs \nof  traffic  accidents  to  Cambodia  are  estimated  to  be  about  2\u20133%  of  gross  domestic  product, \nwhich  excludes  the  social  and  humanitarian  impact  that  loss  of  human  life  and/or  debilitating \ninjuries  can  have  on  families\u2014particularly  if  a  family  income-earner  is  involved.  A  focused, \ncomprehensive, well-planned, and multidimensional road safety program is urgently needed to \naddress  the  problem  in  Cambodia.  An  indication  of  government  commitment  has  been \ndemonstrated  by  the  issuance  of  a  draft  subdecree  proposing  to  establish  a  National  Road \nSafety Council with representation from several key ministries, including MPWT.

There  are  a  number  of  key \ncomponents that will be required for a comprehensive road safety program for Cambodia: (i) an \naccident  data  system;  (ii) the  National  Road  Safety  Council,  with  the  secretariat  located  in \n(v) traffic  police  enforcement; \nMPWT; \n(vi) education  and  publicity;  (vii) driver  training  and  testing;  (viii) vehicle  testing  and  inspection; \nand (ix) emergency services. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial and Institutional Sustainability of the Road Sector \n\n(iii) infrastructure \n\n(iv) legislation; \n\nimprovement; \n\n1. \n\nRoad Maintenance Management and Financing \n\nIn  2000  and  2001,  MPWT\u2019s  expenditures  on  the  primary  and  secondary  road  network \n9. \n(the national and provincial roads) averaged approximately $12.5 million per year, of which 20% \n($2.5 million)  were  recurrent  expenditures  for  routine  maintenance,  and  80%  ($10.0 million) \nwere  capital  expenditures  for  repair  and  rehabilitation  of  pavements.  Annual  average  external \nagency  funding  added  an  estimated  $60.0 million  for  road  rehabilitation  and  improvement;  the \nGovernment\u2019s  expenditures  for  counterpart  funding  of  externally  financed  projects  was \napproximately $6.0 million equivalent, making for total maintenance and rehabilitation funding of \n$79.0 million. No new funds are being expended on the construction of new roads. \n \n10. \nThe  management  of  a  road  network  must  be  based  on  business  principles,  using \neconomic  criteria  to  prioritize  and  schedule  maintenance  works.  An  asset  management \napproach  is  most  appropriate  as  a  long-term  goal  for  maintaining  and  preserving  the  road \nnetwork.  In  Cambodia\u2019s  situation,  this  implies  a  move  from  the  present  crisis-response \nmanagement mode to a network management mode as the core network stabilizes and normal \nperiodic  maintenance  works  can  be  scheduled  in  a  cost-effective  manner.  Essential  to  that \napproach  is  the  establishment  of  the  maintenance  management  system  with  its  basic  building \nblocks  that  include  a  road  and  bridge  inventory,  a  system  for  updating  the  inventory  and \naccompanying condition surveys, and application of evaluation tools to prioritize and schedule \nperiodic maintenance. An ADB-financed study4 has developed a decentralized approach to road \ncondition  monitoring,  and  the  programming  and  management  of  routine  maintenance  that  is \nsuitable  for  implementation  by  provincial  public  works  departments.  The  study  initiated \nimplementation  of  the  maintenance  management  system  in  three  pilot  provinces,  with  the \nsystem  now  being  adopted  by  MPWT  for  replication  in  the  remaining  provinces  of  Cambodia. \nThe system is based on a relatively straightforward road condition assessment procedure that \ninvolves  (i) vehicle  operating  speeds  and  travel  time,  (ii) drainage  considerations,  and \n(iii) engineering judgment. \n \n11. \nTo ensure an effective and sustainable planning and programming process, it is clearly \nessential  to  ensure  security  of  funding  and  reliable  cash  flow  with  the  attendant  technical  and \nfinancial  audit  instruments.  MPWT  has  two  sources  of  funding  for  maintenance  and \ndevelopment  of  the  road  network:  general  funds  from  the  annual  budget,  and  special  funds \naccumulated  in  the  Fund  for  Repair  and  Maintenance  of  Roads  (FRMR).5  General  funds \nallocated  in  the  annual  budget  in  effect  cover  only  periodic  maintenance  and  pavement \nrehabilitation. The investment budget is retained by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) \nand  disbursed  on  a  project  basis.  When  the  FRMR  was  established  in  2000,  it  required \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  1999.  Technical  Assistance  for  Strengthening  the  Maintenance  Planning  and  Management  Capabilities  at \n\nMPWT in Cambodia. Manila. \nInterministerial Prakas 399, 28 June 2000. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nprofitable companies owned by MPWT to loan a share of their net profits to support the FRMR. \nThe primary contributor to the FRMR over the years has been Sihanoukville Port. Since January \n2002, the income of the FRMR has been supplemented by the proceeds from a surcharge on \nfuel amounting to $0.02 per liter on petrol, and $0.04 per liter on diesel. By the end of May 2002, \nthe  accumulated  amount  from  fuel  taxes  was  estimated  at  $3.5 million.  In  May  2002,  the \nmanagement of the FRMR was transferred to MEF, under the direct management of the Prime \nMinister.6  \n \nThe  current  level  of  maintenance  spending,  inclusive  of  capital  expenditures  for \n12. \nrecurrent maintenance and rehabilitation, amounts to approximately 15% of total requirements \nand is clearly insufficient to meet the needs of the sector. The shortfall is partly explained by the \ndilapidated  state  of  most  of  the  road  network  after  more  than  20  years  of  neglect,  which \ntranslates into high maintenance requirements, combined with the Government\u2019s limited funding \ncapacity. The funding situation is aggravated by a small vehicle fleet and relatively light traffic, \nwhich  limits  the  scope  for  collection  of  higher  vehicle  and  fuel  taxes.  These  constraints  will \ndiminish  over  time,  in  step  with  the  ongoing  rehabilitation  of  the  road  network,  which  will \ndecrease road maintenance requirements, and the growth of the economy, which will increase \nthe tax base. It has been estimated that road maintenance requirements will fall by nearly two \nthirds  over  the  coming  15\u201320  years  while  the  potential  for  taxation  of  vehicles  in  the  same \nperiod  will  increase  fivefold,  leading  to  potential  full  funding  of  all  road  maintenance \nrequirements from vehicle and fuel taxation by 2011. \n \n13. \nInstitutional  constraints  also  contribute  to  the  low  level  of  road  maintenance  funding. \nMPWT needs to strengthen capacity and develop an effective organizational structure to carry \nout credible and efficient maintenance planning and implementation. MEF should then be able \nto  respond  more  efficiently  in  approving,  disbursing,  and  monitoring  funds  for  defined \nmaintenance programs. Disbursement of the approved road maintenance budget has been low \nand  approved  budget  allocations  have  been  falling.  This  development  needs  urgently  to  be \nreversed before substantial damage is inflicted upon the rehabilitated parts of the road network. \n \n\n2. \n\nSustainable Organizational Structure for MPWT \n\nThe current MPWT was created by Royal Decree in January 1996 and was vested with \n14. \nthe  responsibility  to  \u201cadminister  and  regulate  the  public  works  and  transport  sectors  of  the \nKingdom  of  Cambodia.\u201d  MPWT\u2019s  capabilities  in  addressing  issues  and  needs  in  the  transport \nsector  require  improvement  through  reorganization  and  institutional  strengthening,  particularly \nwith respect to: (i) defining more fully MPWT\u2019s functions, responsibilities, and job descriptions, \nand  (ii) setting  in  place  the  management  processes  necessary  for  the  development  of  policies \nand plans and the guidance and control necessary to verify that developments and operations \nconform  to  those  policies  and  plans.  Although  MPWT  has  the  overall  mandate  for  the \nmanagement  and  development  of  the  transport  sector,  the  current  legal  and  regulatory \nframework within which it seeks to fulfill this mandate needs strengthening as some of the key \nacts that would legally formalize MPWT\u2019s mandate to manage the transport sector are not yet in \nplace.7  \n \n\n                                                 \n6  Subdecree No. 39, 6 May 2002. \n7  The Road Act, drafted, but requiring review and revisions for adoption; a Rail Act, clarifying the integration of the \nrail transport system and specifying standards for reporting, legal authority, technical specifications, and safety; a \nCivil Aviation Law, drafted but not enacted\u2014however, regulations for flight safety, airworthiness, etc. have not yet \nbeen officially promulgated. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nThe primary tasks of MPWT are to prepare strategic plans and to implement the plans \n15. \nfor  the  development  of  the  transport  sector  in  the  country,  including  civil  aviation.  However, \nMPWT is constrained in its efforts to fulfill these tasks by the lack of a national transport policy \nframework  that  clearly  defines  objectives  and  organizational  responsibilities.  This  clearly  limits \nMPWT's ability to undertake strategic planning, implement projects effectively, or develop sector \npolicies. The current organization of MPWT that was developed in response to the challenges \nfaced  during  the  early  1990s  makes  no  clear  distinctions  between  the  different  functional \nstreams in the organization.  \n \n16. \nThe Government took the initiative to adopt an overall reform program by launching its \nAdministrative Reform Program in 1998. As part of this program, the Government is committed \nto reviewing the proposed reorganization and institutional-strengthening requirements of MPWT \nin order to take into account new challenges in public administration. A reform of MPWT should \nrecognize MPWT\u2019s core functions in planning, infrastructure management, and transport sector \nregulation, emphasizing private sector participation in appropriate activities. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \nA. \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n\nAs  part  of  project  preparation,  a  detailed  social  impact  survey  was  conducted  in  May\u2013\n1. \nJune 2002 along the proposed road alignments of NR5 and NR6, and NR56 and NR68. A full \ncensus  and  inventory  of  lost  assets  was  carried  out  for  all  households  potentially  affected  by \nloss  of  land  and  structures  within  the  proposed  corridor  of  impact  (COI).  Based  on  the \ninformation collected, a full resettlement plan has been prepared for the Project in compliance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and  the  Handbook  on  Resettlement:  A \nGuide to Good Practice.  \n \nThe Project will require acquisition of approximately 60 hectares (ha) of land along NR5 \n2. \nand NR6, affecting approximately 2,000 farmers, 240 houses and house-shops, and 300 small \nroadside stalls, which will need to be moved out of the COI.1 The houses and house-shops are \nmade either of timber with metal roofing sheets, or concrete, or more temporary materials such \nas  bamboo.  Many  of  the  shops  are  built  in  front  of  the  family  residence,  which  will  not  be \naffected by the Project. Irrigation canals will also be disrupted and there will be temporary loss \nof  land  during  construction.  In  addition,  572  private  fruit  trees  and  2,025  public  and  private \nshade trees will be affected within the COI. \n\n3. \nImprovements  to  NR56  and  NR68,  north  of  NR6,  will  only  involve  replacement  of  the \nbridges,  causing  minimal  or  no  land  acquisition  impacts.  Any  unforeseen  land  acquisition \nimpacts would be addressed under the approved resettlement plan for the Project. \n\nThe exact alignment will be determined during detailed design. It is anticipated that there \n4. \ncould  be  a  significant  reduction  in  the  numbers  of  permanently  affected  households  after \ndetailed design as only then will it be possible to identify which land will be required permanently \nand  which  will  be  affected  only  temporarily  during  construction.  After  detailed  design  and  the \ndetailed  measurement  survey  of  affected  losses,  the  numbers  and  budget  in  the  resettlement \nplan will be updated if required. This will provide a final headcount of affected persons, and final \nmeasurement of losses in terms of numbers of assets lost, broken down by category of loss and \ncategory  of  entitled  person,  and  by  applicable  rates  per  category.  New  categories  of  loss  not \ncurrently  included  in  the  resettlement  plan  requiring  new  entitlements  would  also  be  provided \nwhere necessary. The revised resettlement plan, which should be in compliance with the agreed \nresettlement  plan,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nthe  Handbook  on \nResettlement should be submitted to ADB for review and approval before implementation of the \nrevised resettlement plan. \n \nB. \n\nInvoluntary  Resettlement,  and \n\nSocioeconomic Background \n\nA socioeconomic survey was conducted in 20% of potentially affected households. The \n5. \nanalysis of the survey results has been included in the resettlement plan and will guide further \nresettlement planning. \n \nC. \n\nObjectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n\n6. \nThe  policy  framework  and  entitlements  for  the  Project  have  built  upon  the  laws  of  the \nGovernment of Cambodia, principally the new Land Law (issued 30 August 2001), ADB\u2019s Policy \n\n                                                 \n1  The COI for purposes of land acquisition and the inventory of losses for NR5 and NR6 is defined as 20 meters \n\neither side of the right-of-way in rural areas and 6.5 meters either side of the right-of-way in built-up areas. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\non Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice, \nand government-approved resettlement plans for other ADB2 projects. Provisions and principles \nadopted  in  the  resettlement  plan  for  the  Project  supersede  the  provisions  of  relevant  decrees \nand laws currently in force in Cambodia wherever a gap exists. \n\nThe common objective of these policies is to ensure that people displaced by the Project \n7. \nshould generally be at least as well of as, if not better off than, they would have been without the \nProject. The resettlement plan has been prepared with this as a guiding principle. The absence \nof  formal  title  or  lack  of  land  certificates  will  not  prevent  payment  of  compensation  to  affected \npersons/households. Government agreement has been obtained on the guiding principles and \napproach  to  be  adopted  for  land  acquisition,  compensation  and  resettlement,  presented  in \nsummary form in Table A4.1, and on the entitlements presented in Table A4.2. \n\nThe primary objective of the resettlement plan is to provide guidelines for compensation \n8. \npayments for lost assets and resettlement of the project-affected persons and businesses. The \nresettlement  plan  identifies  (i) the  extent  of  losses,  (ii) the  policy  and  legal  framework  for \ncompensation  payments  and  relocation,  (iii) the  institutional  framework  for  participation  and \nimplementation, (iv) provision for employment and poverty reduction, and (v) responsibilities for \nmonitoring  the  implementation  measures.  It  is  expected  that  the  impact  on  the  affected \nhouseholds will be limited due to strip acquisition. The resettlement operations in the Project will \nbe  carried  out  in  consultation  with  the  affected  persons,  including  vulnerable  groups,  and  all \nefforts will be made to minimize disruption during project implementation. \n \nD. \n\nEntitlement Policy \n\nIn  accordance  with  ADB  policy,  people  eligible  for  compensation  will  be  those \n9. \nexperiencing  negative  impacts  on  their  assets  and  livelihoods  as  a  result  of  the  Project.  In \ngeneral, people eligible for compensation will include those affected in the following ways: \n \n\n\u2022  Land to be permanently acquired for the Project: \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  owners with formal legal title \n\u2022  owners/users eligible for formal legal title under Cambodian law \n\u2022  users  of  state  land  who  provide  evidence  of  use/occupation  prior  to  30  August \n\n20013 \nthose who do not satisfy the above conditions but who can provide evidence of \nuse/occupation at the time of the completion of the socioeconomic survey on 30 \nJune 2002 are to be provided with adequate assistance so that they are able to \nimprove, or at least restore, their incomes and living standards to the preproject \nlevels; \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB.  1998.

Also,  a  number  of \nbenefits,  including  compensation  for  loss  of  business,  loss  of  income/workdays,  and  shifting \ncosts have been designed so that affected persons can at least retain their level of living in the \npostproject period. In addition, a number of income-generating opportunities have been adopted \nto improve the socioeconomic conditions and quality of life of the affected persons. The cut-off \ndate for determining the eligibility for entitlements by the affected persons has been established \nby  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT)  as  the  date  of  the  end  of  the \nsocioeconomic survey, 30 June 2002, with any legitimate omissions being identified during the \nsubsequent  detailed  measurement  survey.  The  resettlement  plan  includes  provisions  for \nassistance  in  dismantling,  transporting,  and  reconstructing  structures,  and  relocation  site \npreparation. This assistance will be provided at no cost to the affected persons. \n \nE. \n\nConsultation, Participation, and Disclosure \n\n11. \nAs a result of the household surveys and meetings with affected households, the people \nin  the  project  road  sections  are  fully  aware  and  generally  supportive  of  the  Project.  MPWT \nofficials will carry out an information campaign and, beginning in October 2002 for the duration \nof the resettlement process, will publish brochures in Khmer on the project compensation policy, \ncompensation  payment  procedures,  and  construction  schedule  aimed  at  social  preparation  for \nrelocation and resettlement of the affected persons. MPWT will be responsible for distribution of \nthe  brochures  as  well  as  monthly  newsletters  to  affected  communities  for  the  duration  of  the \nresettlement  process.  During  the  detailed  measurement  survey,  each  household  will  be \npersonally informed about the project, entitlements and procedures. \n \nF. \n\nGrievance Procedures  \n\nTo  ensure  that  affected  persons  have  avenues  for  grievances  related  to  any  aspect  of \n12. \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement,  detailed  procedures  for  redressing  grievances  have  been \nestablished for the Project and detailed in the resettlement plan. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n33 \n\nTable A4.1: Resettlement Principles and Approach Applicable to the Project \n\nPrinciple \nLand acquisition and involuntary \nresettlement should be \nminimized. \n\nPlans should be prepared for \ncompensation, resettlement, and \nrehabilitation of APs. \n\nCommunity participation is \nassured. \n\nAPs will receive fair \ncompensation for all losses, \nincluding assets and livelihoods. \n\nAPs will not be required to have \nformal legal title to the land used \nby them to be eligible for \ncompensation and rehabilitation \nmeasures.  \nResettlement planning and \nimplementation are to be an \nintegral part of project design. \nSpecial measures have been \nincluded in the RP to protect \nsocially and economically \nvulnerable groups.  \n\nThere will be effective grievance \nprocedures.  \nAPs should be fully informed and \nclosely consulted on resettlement \nand compensation options. \n\n10.  APs will receive adequate \n\nsupport if necessary to obtain \nreplacement land and \nresettlement. \n11.  The land acquisition, \n\ncompensation, resettlement, and \nrehabilitation process will be \nmonitored by the Government \nand ADB. \n\nApproach \n\nThis has been achieved through the examination of alternative \nalignments or variations in road widths to ensure that only those \nindividuals whose movement is vital to the successful implementation \nof the Project are affected. \nSocioeconomic surveys and the inventory of lost assets survey have \nbeen completed. APs have been identified, and their land, buildings, \nand other assets enumerated. A resettlement plan has been prepared \nand will be revised if necessary after completion of the detailed design \nand detailed measurement survey. \nDuring the household surveys and focus group meetings, potential APs \nwere informed about the Project and consulted about impacts and \nentitlements. Information about the Project and entitlements will be \ndistributed to all households prior to finalizing the resettlement plan. \nAll APs identified in the project-impacted areas as of the date of the \ncensus and inventory of loss assets survey will be entitled to \ncompensation and rehabilitation measures sufficient to assist them to \nimprove or at least maintain their preproject living standards, income-\nearnings capacity, and production levels. All compensation and \nassistance will be provided at one time prior to relocation. \nNo distinction will be made between APs with formal and informal title. \n\nThe compensation and resettlement activities will be satisfactorily \ncompleted and rehabilitation measures in place before the start of civil \nworks.  \nVulnerable households, such as women-headed families, children, \nelderly people without support structures, and people living in extreme \npoverty (earning less than $10 per month) will be provided with \nadditional monetary assistance and additional relocation and other \nassistance as required during the transition period. \nMechanisms are being prepared for hearing and resolving grievances \nduring the implementation of the RP. \nAn information brochure about the Project and entitlements will be \ndistributed to the APs during the resettlement planning stage. The final \nRP will be displayed in project and commune offices. \n \nReplacement residential, agricultural, and commercial land will be as \nclose as possible to the land that was lost, and acceptable to the AP. \nThe previous level of community services and resources will be \nimproved after resettlement. \nRP implementation will be closely monitored both internally by MPWT \nand externally by an independent agency to be hired by MPWT. \nQuarterly progress reports on monitoring will be provided to ADB. As \npart of its regular review missions, ADB will also review RP \nimplementation. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AP  =  affected  person,  MPWT  =  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport, \nRP = resettlement plan. \n \nG. \n\nIncome Restoration  \n\n13. \nTwo  groups  of  affected  persons  will  experience  loss  of  income  due  to  the  Project. \nFarmers  will  lose  some  or  all  of  their  productive  land  for  which  they  will  be  compensated  and \nassisted  to  obtain  replacement  land.  They  will  receive  assistance  to  help  them  during  the \ntransition period until their new land is established. Small shop-owners will have to move out of \nthe COI, but income loss will be very temporary only while the shops are dismantled and rebuilt \n\n \n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nbehind the COI. The Project will assist the affected shop-owners to either move back behind the \nCOI  or  onto  a  side  or  access  road  with  comparable  accessibility.  The  Project  will  build  shop \nsites  wherever  necessary.  These  same  shop-owners  will  also  experience  some  disturbance \nduring the construction period, for which they will receive a disturbance allowance. \n\nH. \n\nEmployment in Civil Works  \n\n14. \nThe project construction activities will require many unskilled laborers for earthworks and \nroad embankments as well as for road, bridge, and culvert works for a period of 3 years. MPWT \nwill include provisions in the civil works contracts for preferential employment of project-affected \npersons, including women, in the recruitment of local laborers. The contractors will be required \nnot  to  discriminate  against  the  employment  of  women  in  the  road  construction  labor  force. \nEmployment in project construction will be an added source of income in the income restoration \nprocess  of  the  affected  households.  The  social  and  environment  division  of  the  repositioned \nDepartment of Planning in MPWT and the construction supervision consultant will monitor and \nensure contractor compliance. \n \nI. \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n15.  MPWT is the Executing Agency for the Project. A project management unit will be set up \nto  be  responsible  for  the  land  acquisition,  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation \nprogram  for  the  Project.  MPWT  will  see  that  institutional  arrangements  are  in  place  to  ensure \neffective and timely consultation, design, planning, implementation, and monitoring of the land \nacquisition,  compensation, \nrehabilitation  program.  The  social  and \nenvironment  division  will  be  responsible  for  social  (including  resettlement)  and  environmental \nissues across all sectors under MPWT\u2019s authority. \n \nJ. \n\nresettlement,  and \n\nBudget Issues \n\n16. \nThe  total  cost  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  for  the  project  roads  is  currently \nbudgeted  at  $1.2 million.4  The  total  amount,  although  included  in  the  project  costs,  is  to  be \nfinanced entirely by the Government from its counterpart funds. \n \nK. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n17. \nA  detailed  implementation  schedule  for  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  program \nhas been agreed upon by the Government and ADB and incorporated in the resettlement plan. \nAll compensation and resettlement activities will be completed satisfactorily prior to the start of \ncivil works. \n \nL. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n18. \nThe PMU will be responsible for internal monitoring of resettlement plan implementation. \nThe  PMU  will  engage  a  capable  independent  monitoring  agency  before  implementing  the \napproved  resettlement  plan.  The  independent  monitoring  agency  will  follow  a  knowledge, \nattitude,  response,  and  experience  (KARE)  methodology,  which  will  include  a  baseline  survey \nand  follow-up  surveys  until  all  resettlement  plan  activities  are  completed,  to  be  followed  by  a \npost-resettlement evaluation. \n\n                                                 \n4  This  cost  estimate  will  be  adjusted  as  necessary  after  the  detailed  measurement  survey  and  replacement  cost \n\nstudy. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n35 \n\nApplication \n\nPermanent \n\nType of Loss \nLoss of arable, \nforest, \nresidential, or \ncommercial land  \n\nTemporary \nacquisition or \neasement \n\n \n\nStructures: \nresidential, \ncommercial or \nwell, pond, fence, \nlatrine etc.  \n\nTable A4.2: Entitlement Matrix Summary \n \n\nCompensation \n\n(i) As a priority, title to land for land of equal area \nand productivity, or cash compensation for lost land \nat replacement cost at current market value. \nReplacement land to be free from administrative, \nregistration, and transfer costs. \n \n(ii) No distinction between titled and nontitled \nlandholders.  \n \n(iii) Severely affected farmers will be eligible for \neconomic rehabilitation assistance and other \nallowances (disruption allowance, assistance to \nobtain training and employment). \n\nEntitled to provision of adequate assistance so that \nthey are able to improve, or at least restore, their \nincomes and living standards to the preproject \nlevels.

\nconstruction  of  embankment,  pavement,  replacement  bridges  and  culverts, \ndrainage  improvements,  weigh  stations,  and  cross-border  facilities;  and  dealing \nwith road safety and environmental considerations; and \n\nNR56:  Sisophon  to  Samrong  (114.0 km)  and  NR68:  Kralanh  to  Samrong \n(79.0 km),  involving  UXO  clearance  within  the  corridor  of  impact  at  bridge  and \nweigh stations sites; and construction of replacement bridges and weigh stations. \n\nNR5 and NR6 \n\nThe improvements are to be designed generally in accordance with: \n\nHighway Capacity Manual, United States Transportation Research Board (2000) \nfor the analysis of roadway capacity; \n\nAmerican Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO): \nGuide for Design of Pavement Structures (1993) for the design of pavements; \n\n(iii) \n\nAASHTO: Bridge Design Specification (2001 SI edition); and \n\n(iv) \n\nReference  to  the  Cambodian  Roads  Standards  and  other  standards  where \nsuited. \n\nThe major improvements to the roads involve: \n\nraising the embankment on low lying areas to be flood free for the 20-year design \nflood;

\n\n(iv) \n\npaving the carriageways with asphalt concrete (AC); \n\nproviding drainage and erosion protection works based on hydraulic designs, and \nroadside drainage in built-up areas; \n\nimproving  traffic  safety,  particularly  in  the  built-up  areas  by  separating  through \ntraffic from local traffic including bicycles and pedestrians;

\n\n(viii) \n\nconstructing  cross-border  facilities  in  Poipet  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the \nGMS Cross-Border Agreement; \n\n(ix) \n\ninstalling weigh stations in Poipet, Samrong, and Siem Reap; and  \n\n(x) \n\ncarrying out environmental mitigation works pursuant to the initial environmental \nexamination. \n\n \n4. \nThe highway finished level will be determined on the basis of records of the 2000 flood \nso  that  the  project  roads  can  serve  all-weather  transport  all  year.  Slope  protection  is  to  be \nprovided  for  widened  or  new  embankments,  for  instance  by  planting  sprigs  combined  with \nmulching and bitumen spraying. \n \nThe  horizontal  alignment  is  to  be  improved  to  allow  a  design  speed  of  60 km/h.  The \n5. \nexisting  alignment  will  be  followed  in  most  part  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement. \nWhere there is incompatibility between any curve and the speed environment of the road in the \nvicinity of the curve, warning signs are to be provided on the approaches to the curve. \n \n6. \nCarriageways will have two lanes and 7.0 m width. At least 2.0 m wide paved shoulder \nwith 0.5 m wide unpaved extension will be provided on both sides in the built-up areas. In the \nrural areas, 1.5 m wide paved shoulders with 0.5 m wide unpaved extension will be provided on \nboth sides. \n \n7. \nNR5  and  NR6  are  currently  estimated  to  carry  2.8  million  to  5.8  million  cumulative \nequivalent axles for 10 years. Under AASHTO standards applied to the Project, AC pavement \nwill be adopted given the estimated traffic volumes. The AC pavement designs using a 10-year \ndesign  period  are  to  be  made  based  on  investigation  and  testing  of  existing  pavements  and \nexpected embankment materials.  \n \nAll the bridge and most culvert structures existing on the project roads will be replaced \n8. \nwith  new  structures.  Under  the  actual  overloading  circumstances,  HS20-44  load  capacity  plus \n25% additional overload capacity is used for the design load. The structures will have a 7.0 m \nwide  carriageway,  1.5  m  wide  shoulders  and  side  barriers  on  both  sides  in  rural  areas,  with \nconsideration  of  at  least  2.0  m  wide  shoulders  to  be  used  in  built-up  areas.  Use  of  steel  side \nbarriers is recommended to improve safety conditions for the road users. Use of integral bridge \nabutments without expansion joints and pipe culverts with a large diameter is recommended to \nreduce potential maintenance issues. \n \n9. \nDuring implementation of the civil works, temporary access at most of the bridge sites \ncan be achieved with a dry off-road bypass. Larger structures with occasional flows will require \neither a temporary bridge or use of a raised road formation with a large culvert. For the largest \nstructures that are more than 80 m long, the new bridge will be relocated to allow for continued \nuse of the existing bridge during the construction period. Construction methods will focus on the \nuse of precast elements and prestressing of beams to ensure quality, decrease costs, allow for \nwork in the rainy season, and minimize onsite construction time. \n \n10. \nDrainage will be provided for the built-up areas along the project road where there is a \nhistory of flooding. For design of drainage structures, the water levels and flood flows must be \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n51 \n\ndetermined via modeling of the catchment using rainfall and flow data presently available from \nthe Ministry of Water Resources and the Mekong River Commission. All the existing waterway \nstructures will be replaced with new drainage structures with the flow capacity required for the \n20-year flood event as a minimum. Additional waterway structures may be needed to provide for \nthe removal of floodways. \n \n11. \nBased on the outcome of the hydraulic modeling, the removal of floodways is likely to \nrequire  the  construction  of  additional  structures  to  mitigate  any  adverse  effects  caused  by  the \nProject.  These  structures  will  be  placed  at  optimal  positions  along  the  Project  road  so  as  to \nmaximize flow capacity across the entire project length. \n \n12. \nIrrigation control structures, where they are required to be reinstated, will be separated \nfrom  the  new  bridge  structure  and  placed  at  a  safe  distance  upstream  from  the  bridges  so  as \nnot to restrict flood flows. \n \n13. \nSafety considerations are to be incorporated in the designs, particularly in the built-up \nareas of Pouk, Kralanh, Sisophon, and Poipet. To reduce the speed of traffic effectively, traffic \nsigns, pedestrian crossings, and other safety improvement means are to be provided.  \n \n14. \nCross-border facilities are to be constructed in Poipet. The arrangements will provide \nfor single stop, single-window facilities for vehicles. To avoid overloading traffic, weigh stations \nare to be constructed on NR5 in Poipet and on NR6 in Siem Reap. \n \n15. \nThe  above  designs  will  be  made  so  that  environmental  impact  may  be  minimized. \nWhere any adverse environmental impact is foreseen, adequate mitigation measures are to be \nincorporated  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  civil  works,  pursuant  to  the  summary  initial \nenvironmental examination. \n \nB. \n \n16. \nAll  existing  bridge  structures  will  be  replaced  by  two-lane  bridges  or  culverts  of  10  m \nwidth  using  the  HS20-44  capacity  plus  25%  additional  overload  capacity  in  accordance  with \nAASHTO: Bridge Design Specification (2001 SI edition). \n \n17. \nin the vicinity of the intersection of NR56, NR68, and the road heading to the Thai border. \n \n\nTo avoid entry of overloaded trucks into Cambodia, weigh stations are to be constructed \n\nNR56 and NR68 \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE: \nCONSULTING SERVICES FOR CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISION \n \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\n1. \nThe  Government  of  Cambodia  has  applied  for  a  loan  from  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  toward  GMS:  Cambodia  Road  Improvement  Project,  which  will  implement \nrehabilitation  of  (i) 48.5  kilometer  (km)  of  national  road  (NR)  5  from  Sisophon  to  Poipet,  and \n(ii) 102.0 km  of  NR6  from  Siem  Reap  to  Sisophon,  and  partial  rehabilitation  of  (i) 114.0 km  of \nNR56  from  Sisophon  to  Samrong,  and  (ii) 79.0 km  of  NR68  from  Samrong  to  Kralanh.  Part  of \nthe  loan  proceeds  will  be  applied  for  eligible  payments  under  the  civil  works  and  consulting \nservices contracts under the Project. \n \n2. \nThe Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) will be the Executing Agency for \nthe Project. MPWT will be responsible for engaging consulting services and awarding civil works \ncontracts.  The  director  general  of  the  General  Department  of  Public  Works  will  have  overall \nadministrative  oversight  of  the  consulting  services  and  civil  work  contracts,  and  the  Project \nManager will have responsibility for day-to-day operations.  \n \n3. \nThe civil works on NR5 and NR6 involves de-mining and unexploded ordnance (UXO) \nclearance  within  the  corridor  of  impact,  embankment  and  asphalt  concrete  pavement  works, \nreplacement of bridges and culverts, drainage improvement, construction of weigh stations and \ncross-border  facilities,  and  road  safety  and  environmental  considerations.  The  civil  works  on \nNR56  and  NR68  involve  de-mining  and  UXO  clearance  within  the  corridor  of  impact  at  bridge \nand weighbridge sites, bridge replacement, and weigh stations.  \n \n4. \nThe  civil  works  will  be  executed  through  four  contract  packages,  ranging  in  value  from \n$7.5 million  to  $18.5 million.  Table  A13.1  shows  details  of  the  contract  packages.  All  four \npackages  will  be  procured  using  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures.  The  civil \nworks  will  be  executed  under  ADB\u2019s  sample  bidding  documents  (Procurement  of  Civil  Works, \n1997),  which  are  based  on  F\u00e9d\u00e9ration  Internationale  des  Ing\u00e9nieurs-Conseils  (FIDIC) \nConditions  of  Contract,  fourth  edition.  The  detailed  design  and  drawings  developed  under \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  3868-CAM  will  be  used  for  the  bidding  documents.  Following  the \nFIDIC  conditions,  the  employer  will  be  MPWT,  the  employer\u2019s  representative  will  be  the  director \ngeneral of the General Department of Public Works, the consultant will be the engineer, and the \nengineer's representative will be the consultant\u2019s team leader.  \n \n\nTable A13.1: Contract Packages \n \n\nContract \nPackage \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n\nRoad Section \n\nSiem Reap-Kralanh (NR6) \nKralanh-Sisophon (NR6) \nSisophon-Poipet (NR5) \nSisophon-Samrong \n(NR56/NR68) \n\nLength \n(km) \n51.5 \n50.5 \n48.5 \n 193.0 \n\nApproximate Value \n($ million) \n17.8 \n18.5 \n14.7 \n7.5 \n\nCompletion \n(months) \n36 \n36 \n36 \n36 \n\nNote: Contracts are of approximate value, and do not include contingencies. \n \n5. \nimplementation monitoring, as well as project performance monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n\nThe  consultant  will  be  responsible  for  construction  supervision  and  resettlement \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n53 \n\nObjectives \n\nB. \n\n6. \n\nThe main objectives of the consulting services are to: \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nreview the detailed engineering designs for the project roads and revise them as \nappropriate, if necessary; \n\nfunction  as  \u201cthe  engineer\u201d  in  administering  civil  works  contracts  and  ensuring \ncompletion  of  construction,  and  closure  of  contracts  in  accordance  with  the \ncontract provisions; \n\n(iii) \n\nassist MPWT in supervising implementation of land acquisition and resettlement; \n\nassist  MPWT  and  contractors  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nguidelines and monitor implementation of mitigation measures; and \n\ncarry  out  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  civil  works  at  midterm \nand after physical completion. \n\n \nC. \n\nThe Consultant \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n7. \nThe  consulting  services  will  be  provided  by  a  consulting  firm,  joint  venture,  or \nconsortium of consulting firms, to be appointed by MPWT in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  consultant  will  provide  the  staffing,  as  indicated  in  para. 18, \nalthough in preparing the proposals, the consultant may propose alternative arrangements that, \nin their opinion, will provide services of an equivalent quality. The final staffing will be adjusted \nto suit the actual procurement and implementation schedules. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nUnder  the  overall  guidance  of  the  director  general  of  General  Department  of  Public \nWorks, the consultant will work directly with the project management unit, headed by the project \nmanager,  established  in  MPWT  for  the  Project  to  administer  construction  contracts.  The \nconsulting services are expected to continue through almost the entire period of the project, and \nthe level of inputs will depend on the annual work programs. \n \nThe consultant will establish a main office in Phnom Penh headed by the team leader; \n9. \nand  two  site  offices  in  selected  districts  (to  be  determined  during  implementation)  to  provide \nadequate coverage of the project roads. The main office will be responsible for highway design, \nbenefit monitoring and evaluation, and overall assistance in coordination with MPWT. The site \noffices will administer the civil works in accordance with the contracts.  \n \nE. \n \nThe civil works will be executed under FIDIC Conditions of Contract, as outlined in the \n10. \nbid documents. Accordingly, MPWT will be the employer and the consultant will function as the \nengineer  for  all  road  improvement  contracts  under  the  Project.  The  consultant  will  appoint  a \nteam leader to act as the engineer\u2019s representative for the contracts. \n \n11. \nAs the engineer\u2019s representative, the consultant\u2019s team leader will implement the civil \nwork contracts and ensure that the works are constructed in accordance with its provisions.

Many of \nthe poor face food shortages for several months and are vulnerable to external shocks due to reliance on subsistence \nagriculture  and  deprived  access  to  social  services.  Improved  infrastructure  will  lead  to  increased  openness  for \ncommunities  deprived  of  adequate  access  to  information  and  markets.  This  will  increase  access  to  off-farm \nemployment and diversification of risk and vulnerability. Access to markets will reduce vulnerability to food shortages \nand  reliance  on  subsistence  agriculture.  Enhanced  access  will  also  enable  the  Government  and  external  financing \nagencies to provide social services to deprived areas. \n \nB. \nSocioeconomic and Poverty Profile in the Project Area: \n \nThe area under the proposed Project includes the provinces of Siem Reap, Banteay Meanchey and Oddar Meanchey \nin Northwestern Cambodia. This area suffers from high incidence of poverty and has received minimal development \nassistance in the past because of war and insecurity. Owing to the security situation at the time of the implementation \nof  the  socioeconomic  surveys,  reliable  poverty  statistics  on  a  comparative  basis  with  the  rest  of  the  country  are \nunavailable and the statistics presented are only indicative. Although some data indicating vulnerability exist for Siem \nReap and Banteay Meanchey, the data for Oddar Meanchey are either merged with Siem Reap or do not exist. Given \nthe  more  developed  areas  around  Siem  Reap,  the  data  do  not  serve  to  adequately  reflect  the  poverty  and \nvulnerability  that  prevails  in  Oddar  Meanchey.  The  lack  of  data  in  this  province  is  in  itself  an  indication  of  lack  of \naccess to Government, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and aid agencies. Due to high labor mobility, the data \nfor Banteay Meanchey can be regarded as outdated, and vulnerability is likely to be underestimated for that reason. A \ndetailed  survey  was  fielded  to  further  investigate  poverty  and  vulnerability  and  likely  impacts  of  increased  access, \nthrough  a  socioeconomic  survey  and  participatory  focus  group  discussions.  Based  on  survey  data  on  poverty  and \nvulnerability, the proposed classification of the Project is poverty intervention.  \n \nSurvey  data  suggest  that  poverty  is  widespread  in  the  area  with  severe  problems  of  accessibility  during  the  rainy \nseason. The WFP study indicates that no less than 60% of households suffer from food deficiency although there is \nsome  scope  here  for  foraging,  hunting,  and  gathering  activities  to  supplement  precarious  livelihoods.  Most \nhouseholds find their food stocks depleted within 4 months of harvest. The overall poverty estimates for the project \narea is about 40%. However, there are significant variations, with the areas serviced by better roads displaying the \nlowest poverty level (25%), while NR56 and areas serviced by poor roads have very high poverty levels (over 60%). \nThus, quite apart from relatively high poverty levels in the project area compared with the national situation, there are \ndeep  pockets  of  extensive  poverty,  much  of  which  is  related  to  the  relative  physical  remoteness  and  poor \ninfrastructure in the area. Government services, such as health and education, rarely reach the interior and tend to be \nrestricted  to  peri-urban  areas.  Insecurity  and  lack  of  access  have  reduced  the  effectiveness  and  outreach  of  NGO \nactivities. \n \nThe  vulnerability  of  the  population  in  this  area,  and  especially  that  of  the  poor,  is  marked  by  a  number  of  factors. \nThese  include  adverse  demographic  and  socioeconomic  conditions  that  include  a  high  dependency  ratio,  illiteracy, \npoor access to drinking water and health facilities, and low school enrolment and attendance in comparison with the \noverall,  national  situation.  Adult  literacy  is  estimated  at  46%  compared  with  a  national  average  of  over  67%.  The \npopulation with access to safe drinking water and sanitary latrines is estimated at less than 7% and 4%, respectively, \ncompared  with  a  national  average  of  29%  and  15%,  and  school  attendance  (5\u201314  age  group)  is  below  60% \ncompared with 66% for the whole country. This is indicative of high opportunity costs of children to attend school and \nthe need to engage children in livelihood activities. \n \nAccess to credit is severely limited and savings are small, leading to frequent asset-liquidation to meet crises (most \nfrequently  caused  by  health  shocks).  Family  spacing  is  nonexistent  and  whatever  reproductive  services  exist  are \nlargely  inaccessible  due  to  the  widely  dispersed  nature  of  the  population  and  long  travel  distances/time  needed  to \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n57 \n\nreach these (especially in Oddar Meanchey).  \n \nThe  national  data  related  to  women-headed  households  suggest  a  lower  poverty  incidence  compared  with  similar \nmale-headed households. This may not be true for the project area where at least one report points to the serious \ndisadvantages faced by the former especially when able-bodied male labor is not available. Similarly the incidence of \ndisabled persons is high in the area (2.2 per 1000 compared with the national average of 1.5). This is a reflection of \nprolonged  civil  strife  and  the  presence  of  unexploded  ordnance  (UXO)  in  the  area.  Further,  more  recently  settled \nvillages tend to be poorer as these are yet to establish more secure livelihood systems.  \n \nIndigenous  ethnic  minorities  are  not  found  in  the  immediate  project  area  as  war  and  insecurity  led  them  to  move \nnortheast. A few remote villages, beyond the direct influence area, have ethnic minority groups such as the Pnong \nengaged in rice farming and the Cham, found around Tonle Sap, engaged in fishing. They are not considered to be \ndisadvantaged in comparison to ethnic Khmers.  \n \nLivelihood security is a chief concern of the poorest 40%. They are primarily subsistence farmers growing one (rain-\nfed)  crop  a  year,  often  of  low  quality  or  yields  (which  are  significantly  lower  than  those  in  similar  agro-ecological \nareas). Irrigation is scarce and unreliable.  \n \nMigration \n \nDue  to  its  proximity  to  Thailand,  the  area  is  prone  to  labor  mobility,  both  inward  and  outward.  A  large  number  of \npeople  migrate  to  the  towns  and  to  Thailand  in  search  of  work,  usually  illegally.  They  migrate  for  mainly  economic \nreasons, in response to wage differentials between Thailand and Cambodia, food shortages and underemployment. \nMost  of  the  migrants  are  poor  or  very  poor  with  inadequate  landholdings.  Short-term  migration  takes  place  in \nresponse  to  underemployment  during  off-peak  agricultural  seasons  and  serves  as  a  coping  mechanism  for  food \ninsecurity. The majority are women who work just across the border. Long-term migrants, the majority of whom are \nmen, belong to households with sufficient assets to finance their trips. They travel deep into Thailand and engage in \nunskilled  employment  activities  such  as  construction  work,  manufacturing  and  food  processing  activities.  While \nmigration  is  risky  and  can  cause  problems  for  those  left  behind,  many  report  positive  outcomes  and  migration  is \njudged to be good for the development of skills.  \n \nMigration to the area has occurred in response to internal displacement, prevailing poverty and landlessness in other \nareas, and the search for hope of better opportunities. This is evident in the area around Poipet, which has seen a \nrapid increase in the size of its population, from 30,000 in 2000 to over 100,000 in 2002. The town has grown largely \nin response to the casinos established on the Cambodian side. This has led to a rapid increase in urban poverty. A \nsimilar  trend  is  emerging  in  the  border  town  of  O\u2019smach  in  Oddar  Meanchey.  Newly  settled  households  tend  to  be \nmore vulnerable, lack social cohesion, and are more likely to live in poverty than older and more established settlers. \n \nHIV/STI \n\nThe Cambodian Demographic Health Survey, 2000 reveals that Banteay Meanchey is one of the provinces with the \nlowest level of awareness of AIDS, with 79% of respondents aware of HIV/AIDS compared with the national average \nof 95% awareness. A 2000 HIV surveillance testing in Banteay Meanchey found the following rates of HIV positive \npeople in the groups tested: 7.3% of police, 37.3% of direct commercial sex workers, 13.3% of indirect sex workers, \nand 4% of pregnant women attending antenatal clinics. While this is a decrease from previous years, it is still very \nhigh. The merged data for Siem Reap/Oddar Meanchey show that awareness is in line with the national average. But \nfor Oddar Meanchey this is likely to be a significant overestimation. All three provinces rank low in terms of women\u2019s \nknowledge of HIV/STD prevention. \n\n \n\nExpected Impacts on Poverty and Vulnerability  \n\nThe impacts on the poor in the project area would largely depend on how national roads 6 and 5 are linked to the \nlocal  road  network.  To  maximize  the  impacts,  the  proposed  Project  includes  road  improvements  and  all-weather \naccessibility along national roads 68 and 56, which form a loop in Oddar Meanchey. The loop will feed directly into \nthe ADB-financed Northwestern Rural Development Project1 (NRDP) and enhance the joint poverty impacts of both \nnational  roads  6  and  5  under  the  proposed  Project  and  the  impacts  identified  under  NRDP.  Thus,  the  proposed \nProject intends to provide an integrated approach linking feeder roads (under NRDP) with provincial roads and the \nnational roads. This would increase the poverty reduction impacts of both the NRDP and the proposed developments \non national roads 6 and 5. \n\n                                                 \n1  Approved 6 November 2001. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n\nRecent  studies  of  the  impact  of  feeder  roads  show  that  the  competitiveness  of  transport  facilities  is  an  important \nfactor for the impacts on poverty reduction. This would show the impacts of savings in vehicle operating costs on the \npoor. Within a competitive environment reduced costs would be transferred to the consumers of transport facilities. \nTransport services in Cambodia tend to be highly competitive and therefore the main beneficiaries would be the users \nof such facilities.  \n \nKey  impacts  include  higher  producer  prices  and  a  wider  span  of  marketing  options  for  agricultural  produce  and \nincreased opportunity for trade to reduce food shortages. Access to national roads 6 and 5, a main trade route with \ngrowing  markets,  will  further  increase  farmers\u2019  abilities  to  reach  a  variety  of  markets.  All-weather  access  along  the \nloop  and  into  the  target  villages  of  NRDP  will  reduce  the  costs  of  accessing  social  services  like  health  care  and \neducation.  The  ability  of  outreach  into  Oddar  Meanchey  and  effectiveness  of  government  and  other  agencies  in \nproviding services will significantly improve as both feeder roads and main roads are improved. Only a few NGOs, \nWFP, and de-mining companies are active in the area around the loop. They are mainly engaged in emergency relief \nand  food  for  work  programs.  Most  of  their  project  beneficiaries  are  disabled,  war  widows,  or  displaced  people \nbelonging  to  the  poor  or  very  poor.  Increased  access  to  these  areas  will  facilitate  a  more  effective  outreach  for \norganizations engaged in direct poverty reduction efforts. \n \nThe  most  immediate  impact  of  the  proposed  Project  includes  employment  opportunities  during  road  construction. \nRoad construction work tends to be self-targeting of the poor. Although this impact is deemed as short run, the design \nof  local  maintenance  contracts  under  the  Project  will  act  to  promote  longer-term  wage  and  employment  impacts. \nTogether with increased access to a wider range of employment activities labor-intensive road construction and local \nmaintenance contracts provide off-farm employment opportunities that are key to poverty reduction. This is especially \nimportant  for  the  landless  and  for  those  with  inadequate  land  resources.  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO) \nstudies show that nearly 47% of road workers are women. Local employment opportunities will reduce the need for \nmigration to Thailand, and thus reduce vulnerability for those left behind. Thus, by incorporating local labor contracts \nin the design, the Project will act to reduce the rate of increase in labor migration. \n \nSocial Risks \n \nOne of the major objectives of the proposed Project is to enhance economic integration, increase mobility and intra- \nand cross-border trade. While labor mobility is already high, mobility can be expected to increase both to and from \nthis  area.  Given  the  rather  high  incidence  of  HIV/AIDS  in  Banteay  Meanchey  and  low  awareness  together  with  an \nexpected increase of truck-drivers going through the area, there is a risk of further spread of HIV/AIDS to and from \nthe project area. In order to reduce this risk, a participatory approach to raising HIV/AIDS awareness will be followed. \nThis  will  be  based  on  best  practices  developed  under  TA  5881-REG:  Preventing  HIV/AIDS  Among  Mobile \nPopulations in the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n \nLabor-Based Appropriate Technologies \n \nThere  are  a  number  of  poverty-oriented  gaps  in  the  current  road  program.  First,  there  is  a  need  to  connect  the \nprimary  and  the  rural  roads  with  secondary  roads.  Second,  there  is  a  need  to  develop  more  opportunities  for  and \ncapacity  of  domestic  private  contractors  who  are  capable  and  equipped  to  take  on  construction  and  maintenance \nwork on the national and provincial roads. Third, more research needs to be done on road technologies best suited to \nCambodia  in  terms  of  directly  and  indirectly  achieving  poverty  reduction  goals,  including  compilation  and  review  of \nexperiences  from  other  countries.  Finally,  there  is  a  need  for  greater  capacity  for  the  training  of  engineers,  public \nsector  officials,  and  private  sector  contractors  and  consultants  in  road  technologies  and  management.  A  project \nconcept,  Mainstreaming  Poverty  Reducing  Approaches  into  the  National  Road  Network,  has  been  developed  for \ngrant  financing  under  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  to  reduce  poverty  by  refining  pro-poor  appropriate \ntechnological  solutions  recently  developed  in  Cambodia,  and  mainstreaming  them  into  the  road  programs  of  the \nMinistry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport,  and  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development.  The  Project  will  work  toward \nmaximizing  the  input  of  local  entrepreneurs,  materials,  labor,  and  ingenuity.  Thus,  there  is  expected  to  be  both  an \nimmediate  direct  effect  on  income  through  employment  and  a  long-term  direct  effect  through  the  provision  of  cost-\neffective tools for the management of the road network. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nC. \nStakeholder analysis:  \n \nStakeholder analysis undertaken through socioeconomic surveys and focus-group discussions \nParticipation strategy: Yes \n \nA  participation  strategy  is  in  preparation  for  the  HIV/AIDS  prevention  component.

This summary initial \nenvironmental  examination  was  submitted  to  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport \n(MPWT) and approved. \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nThe Project will (i) rehabilitate 150 kilometers (km) of national road from Siem Reap to \n2. \nPoipet on the border with Thailand; (ii) rehabilitate about 50 bridges along National Road (NR) \n56 from Sisophon to Samrong and NR68 from Samrong to Kralanh, which links to NR5 and NR6 \nbetween Siem Reap and Poipet.  \n \nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Resources \n\n3. \nThe  road  linking  Siem  Reap  and  Poipet  is  situated  at  about  10  meters  (m)  above  sea \nlevel (asl) on a large area of the central plain that surrounds the Tonle Sap and continues to the \nMekong river system. Protruding from the plain are a few scattered outcrops of small sandstone \nhills  that  may  rise  to  about  100  m  asl  above  the  plain.  Otherwise,  the  plain  is  flat  and \nfeatureless. From the Tonle Sap the plain rises imperceptibly at a gradient of about 0.03% until \nit  encounters  the  lower  slopes  of  the  Chuor  Phnum  Dangrek  range  that  forms  the  divide \nbetween Cambodia and Thailand. The range rises to heights of about 400 m asl. \n \n4. \n The  climate  of  the  area  is  characterized  by  a  distinct  wet  and  dry  season.  The \nsouthwest  monsoon  starts  in  May  and  ends  in  October  while  from  November  to  April  the  dry \nnortheast  monsoon  occurs.  Temperatures  are  high  throughout  the  year  with  a  daytime \nmaximum of nearly 35 degrees Centigrade occurring in April just prior to the rainy season. With \nincreased  cloud  cover  from  the  southwest  monsoon,  daytime  temperatures  decrease  while  a \nslight seasonal effect lowers the temperature to 30 degrees Centigrade in December. Average \nrainfall is 1,400\u20131,500 mm at Siem Reap with about 80% of the rainfall in the wet season. \n \n5. \nThe  hydrology  of  the  area  is  dominated  by  three  systems,  namely  (i) the  hydrological \nconditions  of  the  upper  catchment  areas  of  the  Chuor  Phnum  Dangrek,  (ii) locally  derived \ndrainage  that  originates  from  the  main  water  courses  and  enters  the  Tonle  Sap,  and  (iii) the \noperation of the Tonle Sap itself. In normal years, the Tonle Sap operates within the levels of \n1.1 m asl and 10.0 m asl. As the road is set about 10.0 m asl, parts of the road that cross the \nplain at or below this level are influenced. \n \n\n2. \n\nEcological Resources \n\n6. \nThe  dominant  land  cover  along  the  road  between  Siem  Reap  and  Poipet  is  a  mix  of \npaddy  fields  and  extensive  grazing.  Surrounding  and  within  some  of  the  paddy  areas  sugar \npalms are seen. From Sisophon to Poipet, shrub and low woody vegetation are dominant where \nthey are not cleared for paddy areas. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n61 \n\nNR56 runs through paddy fields and grazing land to the north from Sisophon. In Thmar \n7. \nPuok,  fruit  trees  are  planted.  The  road  borders,  at  a  distance,  Banteay  Chmar  Protected \nLandscape  (BCPL)  in  Banteay  Chmar  for  about  18 km.  The  road  then  runs  through  the  area \nwhere degraded forest is dominant. NR68 from Samrong runs mainly through paddy fields with \nsome  grazing  land.  The  BCPL  covers  81,200  hectare  (ha)  and  spreads  over  the  Thmar  Puok \ndistrict  of  Banteay  Meanchey  Province  and  the  Banteay  Ampil  District  of  Oddar  Meanchey \nProvince. \n \nAccording to the draft subdecree on management of natural protection prepared by the \n8. \nMinistry  of  Environment  (MOE),  development  projects  can  be  implemented  in  the  protected \nlandscape  areas,  except  for  core  areas.  However,  the  BCPL  has  never  been  surveyed  nor \ndemarcated so the location of the core area is unknown. According to a study undertaken by the \nprovincial department of environment, no rare or endangered species have been reported within \nthe BCPL. \n \n9. \nThe  Tonle  Sap  is  the  largest  freshwater  lake  in  Southeast  Asia.  It  covers  an  area  of \napproximately  250,00  ha  in  the  dry  season,  and  it  extends  to  1,000,000  ha  during  the  wet \nseason. NR6 borders the transition zone of Tonle Sap Multiple Use Area between Siem Reap \nand Sisophon. In the transition zone, a variety of activities are allowed without causing adverse \nenvironmental impacts.  \n \n10. \nThe road crosses a floodplain that is linked to the upper part of the Tonle Sap. Both the \nfloodplain and the Tonle Sap are essential and linked components of the fisheries of the area. \nOver 200 species of fish are found in the Tonle Sap with 100 species regularly occurring in the \nfish  catches.  The  huge  wetland  system  with  its  habitat  diversity  supports  one  of  the  most \nproductive fisheries in Asia.  \n \n\n3. \n\nHuman and Economic Development \n\n11. \nRice  and  fish  are  important  parts  of  the  diet  for  people  living  in  the  project  area.  Rice \ncultivation  is  the  dominant  agricultural  activity.  Ponds  located  along  the  roads  are  utilized  for \nirrigation and as duck ponds. In some areas along NR56, fruit trees and maize are planted. \n \nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nDrainage \n\n12. \nThe project area between Siem Reap and Sisophon is sometimes inundated in the wet \nseason. The raising of an embankment between Siem Reap and Sisophon to a flood-free height \nwill cause additional runoff to be held behind the embankment that will require an engineering \nsolution  in  terms  of  additional  cross-flow  discharge  capacity  to  be  incorporated  within  the \nembankment.  This  may  be  achieved  by  widening  the  existing  bridges  and  culverts  or \nconstructing additional cross-drainage through the road embankment. \n \nThe  provision  of  additional  cross-drainage  will  relieve  water  height  that  may  build  up \n13. \nagainst the embankment and if correctly designed, additional cross-drainage may maintain the \nflood  level  at  the  same  height  on  both  sides  of  the  embankment.  In  areas  where  rice  is \ncultivated,  improved  drainage  gives  landholders  better  access  to  their  paddy  fields  and \nincreased  rice  production.  In  order  to  facilitate  drainage  of  floodwater,  additional  culverts  are \nnecessary  for  cross-drainage.  In  the  project  area,  erosion  may  not  be  significant  due  to  the \nhydrology  in  the  area.  However,  good  construction  practices  will  be  implemented  to  avoid \nunnecessary sedimentation and water pollution. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nFisheries \n\n14.  Most  of  the  fish  species  that  are  found  in  and  around  the  Tonle  Sap  do  not  have \nmigratory patterns because the flood period is too short for breeding while others have definite \nmigratory preferences. They will move into flooded plain areas once these areas are inundated, \nmoving in during August or September and moving back to the Tonle Sap in October. The fish \nwill move up the natural water courses and, as the floodplain is inundated, the fish will move into \nthe plain for feeding and breeding. \n \n15. \nThe  road  crosses  a  floodplain  that  is  of  significance  to  fish  movement,  not  within  the \nrivers  that  are  the  primary  migration  routes  but  in  the  secondary  migration  areas  on  the \nfloodplain  itself.  As  the  road  will  be  raised  and  equipped  with  additional  cross-drainage,  the \naccess for fish migration within the floodplain area will be restored or improved. \n \n\n3. \n\nNoise and Dust \n\n16. \nNoise  and  dust  from  unpaved  roads  are  a  major  nuisance  for  roadside  residents, \nespecially those in built-up areas. As traffic flows increase, this problem will get worse until road \nsurfaces  are  paved.  The  Project  will  have  positive  impacts  on  the  quality  of  life  of  roadside \nresidents as it will result in a significant reduction in noise and dust generated. \n \n17. \nHowever, during the construction stage, mitigation measures against noise and dust are \nnecessary. In order to reduce impacts by noise: (i) construction activities will be avoided at night \nclose  to  residents,  and  (ii)   contractors\u2019  vehicles  will  be  equipped  with  mufflers.  In  order  to \nminimize dust: (i)  the construction sites will be watered several times a day depending on the \ncondition,  and  (ii) the  pavement  of  the  road  will  start  from  built-up  areas  to  minimize  the \nnumbers of inhabitants affected by dust. \n \n\n4. \n\nConstruction Materials \n\n18. \nBorrow  pits  will  need  to  be  located  along  the  roads  as  a  source  of  subbase  material. \nBorrow pits will be left in a safe condition or restored as close as possible to a productive use. It \nis  recommended  that  some  of  them  be  located  on  adjoining  private  land  where  they  could  be \nused as fish or duck ponds or for irrigation. \n\n \nGravel and crushed stone will be hauled by trucks to the project sites. There may be a \n19. \ntendency  to  overload  the  trucks,  and  several  bridges  along  NR5  to  Sisophon  are  already \nseverely  damaged.  To  avoid  further  bridge  deterioration  during  reconstruction,  it  will  be \nnecessary  to  ensure  that  the  contractors\u2019  haulage  trucks  do  not  exceed  the  bridge  and \npavement limits. In that way, dust from the trucks will also be reduced. \n \n20. \nThe bridge design recommends the use of precast concrete beams that would be cast in \na specialized concrete manufacturers\u2019 site. The beams are then transported to site and erected. \nThus apart from the bridge abutments and possibly for large box culverts, quantities of cement \nand aggregate that would normally have been brought on site will be significantly reduced. \n \n21. \nFuels and oil storage areas should be located well away from any water courses and be \nprovided with interceptor traps so that accidental spills do not contaminate the environment. All \nwaste oil should be stored and disposed of to acceptable oil industry standards. Washing-down \nwater  also  needs  to  be  directed  into  this  system  and  held  in  retention  areas  for  treatment. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n63 \n\nWherever  possible,  refueling  should  be  carried  out  at  a  fuel  storage  area  and  not  permitted \nwithin or adjacent to water courses. \n\n \n\n5. \n\nCleanup of the Construction Site \n\n22.  When construction is completed, the contractors must clean up the construction site by \nremoving all equipment and buildings and carrying out site remediation work. \n \n\n6. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\n23. \nThe  main  risks  during  the  construction  stage  may  arise  from  (i) inadequate  sanitation \nfacilities  in  work  camps,  (ii) lack  of  preparation  for  accidents  and  injuries,  (iii) introduction  of \nsexually  transmitted  or  other  infections  by  immigrant  workers,  and  (iv) outbreaks  of  malaria  in \nthe labor force. In order to avoid these risks, (i) the camps will be located a certain distance from \ncommunities; (ii) the contractor will prepare a worker health and safety plan, including provision \nof sanitation facilities, equipment, and medical care; (iii) workers will receive health and safety \ntraining; and (iv) workers will under go pre-employment health screening.  \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\nThe  Project  complies  with  procedures  set  out  by  MOE  on  environmental  review \n24. \nprocesses.  The  implementation  of  the  IEE  can  be  carried  out  by  the  Project  Unit  of  MPWT \ntogether  with  the  social  and  environment  division  that  will  be  established  within  the  Ministry. \nMPWT  will  develop  a  detailed  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  based  on  the  IEE. \nMPWT, construction supervision consultants, and contractors will implement EMP. \n \n25. \nDuring  the  detailed  design  stage,  close  consultations  will  be  made  with  relevant  line \nministries such as MOE, the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology on drainage, and the \nMinistry of Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry on irrigation. \n\n \n26. \nA project management unit (PMU) will carry out environmental monitoring together with \nthe  construction  supervision  consultant,  and  the  results  will  be  reported  to  the  social  and \nenvironment division to be established in the repositioned Department of Planning. The results \nwill also be incorporated in the quarterly project progress reports submitted to ADB.  \n \nF. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nThe  environmental  screening  process  for  the  Project  indicates  that  overall  negative \n\n27. \nenvironmental impacts are deemed to be minor because: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nthe  Project  comprises  rehabilitation  and  resurfacing  of  the  existing  roads  with \nlimited realignment; \nresettlement impacts are limited; \ncareful  consideration  has  been  given  to  avoiding  environmental  impacts  along \nthe project road; and \n\n(iv)  measures are readily available to mitigate potential impacts. \n\n28.  Mitigation  measures  have  been  identified  to  address  potential  impacts.  The  IEE, \ntherefore,  is  considered  sufficient  and  with  implementation  of  the  environmental  management \nplan is considered to have complied with ADB\u2019s environmental assessment requirements. \n\nConclusion \n\n \nG. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "Currency Unit\n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 September 2002) \n \nriel (KR) \n \n$0.00026 \nKR3,816 \n", "\u2013 \n \n= \n= \n", "KR1.00\n$1.00\n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nAIDS \nAusAID \nBCPL \nCSP \nDanida \nDOP \nFIDIC \nFRMR \nGMS \nHIV \nICB \nICR \nIRC \nIEE \nJFPR \nMEF \nMOE \nMPRA \n", "MPWT \nNGO \nNR \nNRDP \nOPEC \nPMU \nSida \nSTI \nSDR \nTA \nUNDP \nUSAID \nUXO \nVOC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome \nAustralian Agency for International Development \nBanteay Chmar Protected Landscape \ncountry strategy and program \nDanish Agency for Development Assistance \nDepartment of Planning \nF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des Ing\u00e9nieurs-Conseils \nFund for Repair and Maintenance of Roads \nGreater Mekong Subregion \nhuman immunodeficiency virus \ninternational competitive bidding \nInterministerial Committee for Reorganization \nInterministerial Resettlement Committee \ninitial environmental examination \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction \nMinistry of Economy and Finance \nMinistry of Environment \nMainstreaming Poverty Reduction Approaches into the \nNational Road Network \nMinistry of Public Works and Transport \nnongovernment organization \nnational road \nNorthwestern Rural Development Project \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \nProject Management Unit \nSwedish International Development Cooperation \nsexually transmitted infection  \nspecial drawing rights \ntechnical assistance \nUnited Nations Development Programme \nUnited States Agency for International Development \nunexploded ordnance \nvehicle operating cost \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "This Report was prepared by a team consisting of: A.
