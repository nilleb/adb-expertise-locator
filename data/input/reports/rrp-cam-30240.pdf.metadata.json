The Project forms \npart  of  the  Bangkok-Phnom  Penh-Ho  Chi  Min  City-Vung  Tau \nRoad Improvement Project (Greater Mekong Subregion [GMS] \nRegional  Highway  R1),  which  is  one  of  10  high-priority \nsubregional  road  projects  identified  under  a  Subregional \nTransport  Sector  Study  completed  in  1994.  GMS  Regional \nHighway R1 is a core road infrastructure element of the GMS \nSouthern Economic Corridor, a priority development corridor that \nconnects  central  Thailand  to  southern  Viet  Nam  through \nCambodia and that will increase integration of the Cambodian \neconomy  with  the  economies  of  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam.  The \nProject  will  rehabilitate  national  road  (NR)  5  and  NR6,  and \nreconstruct about 45 bridges between Siem Reap and Poipet on \nthe border with Thailand, thus (i) completing a critical missing link \nin  GMS  Regional  Highway  R1,  (ii)  establishing  direct  highway \nconnection between Thailand and the rapidly developing tourism \ncenter in Siem Reap and Angkor Wat, and (iii) providing access to \nnorthwestern Cambodia by completing the primary road network \naround  Tonle  Sap.  The  Project  will  also  reconstruct  about  50 \nbridges on approximately 200 kilometers of the northern loop of \nNR56 and NR68, linking the towns of Svey Chek, Thmar Puok, \nand Samrong to the national road network, and providing access \nto large rural areas in the provinces of Banteay Meanchey, Oddar \nMeanchey, and parts of Siem Reap province. The Project will \ninitiate a process of reform for the Ministry of Public Works and \nTransport (MPWT). An associated activity has been developed \nunder  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  to \nmainstream  pro-poor  appropriate  technological  solutions  for \nroadworks in Cambodia. \n   \nRationale  Economic  cooperation  among  the  six  GMS  countries  is \nconsidered a major contributor to sustainable economic and social \ndevelopment, including poverty reduction, in the region. Efficient \ntransport  that  provides  improved  access  is  key  to  increased \nsubregional  trade  and  tourism,  economic  development,  and \npoverty reduction. Investments in roads in Cambodia are part of a \ncontinuing  program  to  reestablish  the  country\u2019s  transport \ninfrastructure after nearly 30 years of civil strife. The Project will ", "iv \nthus  assist  balanced  economic  and  social  development  in \nCambodia through improvement of part of a major subregional \ntransport  corridor  in  the  country.  Specifically,  the  Project  will \n(i) improve subregional economic cooperation via realization of \nthe Southern Economic Corridor; (ii) ensure flood-free connectivity \nto  the  northwestern  parts  of  the  country;  (iii) support  national \neconomic  development  and  local  employment  generation  by \nfacilitating the development of tourism; and (iv) improve access in \nnorthwest Cambodia to social services, markets, and employment \nopportunities by connecting primary and secondary roads to the \ntertiary  network  in  the  project  area,  thereby  supporting  the \ninfrastructure  currently  being  rehabilitated  under  other  projects \nfinanced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the area. \n   \nObjectives  The overall objectives of the Project are to promote economic \nactivities and facilitate trade among Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet \nNam and to improve the prospects for poverty reduction along the \nSouthern Economic Corridor. The Project will: (i) together with \nother  ongoing  and  planned  investments  funded  by  other \ndevelopment  partners,  promote  national  and  subregional \neconomic  growth  by  reducing  the  cost  and  increasing  the \nreliability of transport, which will also encourage the fast-growing \ntourism  industry  and  subregional  trade,  and  promote  general \neconomic  growth;  (ii) reduce  poverty  by  providing  all-year,  all-\nweather  access  to  employment  opportunities,  markets,  and \ngrowth  centers;  (iii) improve  social  conditions  by  providing  all-\nyear,  all-weather  access  to  education  and  health;  (iv) promote \nprivate  sector  participation  and  strengthen  the  domestic  road-\ncontracting  industry  by  providing  opportunities  in  road \nconstruction  and  maintenance;  (v) work  with  an  experienced \nnongovernment  organization  (NGO)  under  the  national  human \nimmunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome \n(HIV/AIDS) framework to support efforts to control the disease \nand create awareness of it; (vi) initiate a process of reform for \nMPWT,  particularly  for  the  road  sector  in  which  asset \nmanagement and transparency must be a guiding theme; and \n(vii) establish effective road maintenance management and road \nmaintenance financing systems. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $77.5 million  equivalent, \nincluding  interest  charges,  comprising  $52.0 million  (67.1%)  in \nforeign exchange cost and approximately $25.5 million equivalent \n(32.9%) in local currency cost. \n   ", "v \nFinancing Plan \n($ million)\nSource  Foreign  Local  Total Costs  % \n    Exchange  Currency  \n \nADB  43.0  7.0  50.0  64.5 \nOPEC Fund  9.0  1.0  10.0  12.9 \nGovernment  0.0  17.5  17.5  22.6 \n \n  Total  52.0  25.5  77.5  100.0 \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank. \nLoan Amount and Terms  The Project will be financed by a loan of Special Drawing Rights \n37.885 million ($50.0 million equivalent) from the Special Funds \nresources of ADB. The repayment period of the proposed ADB \nloan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an \ninterest  charge  of  1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% \nthereafter.  The  loan  will  cover  82.7%  of  the  entire  foreign \nexchange  cost  of  the  Project  and  about  27.5%  of  the  local \ncurrency cost. The bulk of the remaining local currency cost of \n$17.5 million equivalent will be met by the Government from its \nown resources. Cofinancing has been arranged with the OPEC \nFund for International Development (OPEC Fund) in an amount of \n$10.0 million, which will meet 17.3% of foreign exchange cost and \n3.9% of local currency cost. The OPEC Fund loan will have a \nmaturity of 20 years, with an interest rate of 1.0% per annum, a \nservice charge of 1.0% per annum, and a grace period of 5 years. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  30 June 2007 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2006 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) \n   \nImplementation  The overall project implementation period is 4 years. A project \nArrangements  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be  established  in  the  General \nDepartment of Public Works of MPWT that will be responsible for \nday-to-day management of the Project. A social and environment \ndivision  will  be  established  in  the  proposed,  repositioned \nDepartment  of  Planning  of  MPWT  that  will  be  responsible  for \nmonitoring  the  HIV/AIDS  program,  implementation  of  the \nresettlement  plan,  social  development  and  poverty  impact \nassessments,  and  environmental  management.  The  proposed, \nrepositioned  Department  of  Planning  will  also  act  as  the \nsecretariat for the Interministerial Committee for Reorganization \nthat will be established to prepare the reform program for MPWT. \nThe proposed JFPR-financed program on mainstreaming poverty \nreduction approaches, which will be managed by the International \nLabour Organization, and for which MPWT will be the executing \nagency, will be supervised by a steering committee cochaired by \nsenior  management  of  MPWT  and  the  Ministry  of  Rural ", "vi \nDevelopment. \n   \nProcurement  Civil works contracts will be awarded on the basis of international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB)  among  prequalified  international \ncontractors in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\n \nConsulting Services  International and domestic consultants will be required to assist in \n(i) construction supervision services for the project roads (about \n200  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  about  402 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consultants);  (ii) reorganization  of \nMPWT (to be determined by the Interministerial Committee for \nReorganization  during  implementation  of  the  Project); \n(iii) implementation of the HIV/AIDS program; (iv) implementation \nand  monitoring  of  the  resettlement  plan,  funded  by  the \nGovernment;  and  (v) implementation  of  the  Poverty  Reduction \nMonitoring  Program.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The main quantifiable benefits of the Project consist of (i) savings \nBeneficiaries  in vehicle operating costs, (ii) vehicle and passenger time cost \nsavings, and (iii) benefits from traffic generated by the reduction in \ntransport costs. The subregional benefits are associated with the \nroad\u2019s contribution to increased integration of the economies of \nThailand,  Cambodia,  and  Viet Nam  that  will  enable  the \nestablishment  of  new  and  more  efficient  trading  and  transport \npatterns  in  the  subregion.  These  benefits  have  not  been \nquantified.  Additional  nonquantified  benefits  include  producer \nsurplus benefits; income generated by additional tourism; income \nfrom  increased  agricultural  activity;  and  social  benefits  from \nimproved access to schools, medical facilities, and other social \nservices.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The major risks to the Project relate to achievement of expected \ntraffic  levels,  adherence  to  construction  schedules,  quality  of \nworks, and proper selection of consultants and contractors. With \nthe  growing  experience  of  MPWT  in  the  construction  and \nmaintenance of externally financed roads and the engagement of \nqualified construction supervision consultants, the risks to timely \nand  successful  implementation  of  the  Project  will  be  greatly \nreduced. Particular attention will be paid to the formulation of and \nadherence to design standards, and the implementation of the \nresettlement plan so that appropriate compensation to affected \npersons is effected prior to start of civil works. The reorganization \nof  MPWT  is  a  continuing  and  evolving  process  that  will  also \nrequire close attention and commitment from the Government to \nensure that a clear reform program is implemented during the \nproject period.  \n ", " ", " \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand administration of a proposed loan from the OPEC Fund for International Development to the \nKingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion:  Cambodia  Road  Improvement \nProject. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, ISSUES, AND DIRECTIONS \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Background \n2.  The Project forms part of the Bangkok-Phnom Penh-Ho Chi Minh City-Vung Tau Road \nImprovement Project (Greater Mekong Subregion [GMS] Regional Highway R1), which is one of \n10 high-priority subregional road projects identified in a Subregional Transport Sector Study \ncompleted in 1994.1 The GMS R1 forms the core of the Southern Economic Corridor that links \ncentral Thailand, Cambodia, and southern Viet Nam. The GMS R1 project was endorsed by the \nFourth  GMS  Ministerial  Conference  in  1994  and  reaffirmed  at  the  10th  GMS  Ministerial \nConference in November 2001. The Project will rehabilitate a 50-kilometer (km) section of \nnational road (NR) 5, thereby completing the Bangkok-Phnom Penh-Ho Chi Minh City-Vung Tau \nGMS R1, which together with ongoing and planned improvements along NR1 between Phnom \nPenh and Ho Chi Minh City, and improvement and bridge replacement on NR5 and NR6 \nfinanced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Government of Japan, and the World \nBank, will complete the southern leg of the Southern Economic Corridor.2 At the national level, \nthe Project responds to the Government\u2019s infrastructure development emphasis on improving \nthe national and provincial road network to allow more effective access to the rural areas and \ninduce economic growth. The roads covered by the Project lie in the northwestern part of the \ncountry and include important strategic and rural access links that address trade and poverty \nreduction issues. Northwestern Cambodia is one of the poorest regions of the country and \ncritically needs postconflict reconstruction to enable resumption of economic activities. It is also \nthe region containing Angkor Wat, which forms the basis for a rapidly growing tourism industry, \nand is the entry and exit point for most of the trade between Cambodia and Thailand. The \nProject Framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \n3.  Years of civil strife have led to a widespread and severe deterioration of Cambodia\u2019s \ntransport infrastructure. The condition of the transport system continues to restrict the economic \nand social development of the country, despite the fact that much has been achieved in terms of \nrehabilitation and reconstruction of the transport system during the past 10 years. Notably, a \ncore network of national roads, comprising approximately one third of the primary road network, \nhas been reestablished, with support from ADB and other development partners. A list of \nexternal  assistance  activities  for  major  roads  is  in  Appendix  2.  The  main  seaport  at \nSihanoukville, and the airports at Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, have also been rehabilitated \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1993.

ADB has provided loans for six transport projects, with three focusing on the road \nnetwork.3  \n \n2.  Road Network \n4.  The  Cambodian  road  network  covers  about  35,500  km,  including  approximately \n4,000 km of national roads, 3,500 km of provincial roads, and 28,000 km of rural and strategic \nroads. The roads have a significant number of bridges, about 4,000 on the primary roads alone. \nMost of the road network is dilapidated and large parts of the country are effectively isolated \nduring the wet season. Most bridges are seriously damaged or failed. The Ministry of Public \nWorks and Transport (MPWT) considers that at least half of the primary road network and \nnearly all of the secondary and tertiary roads are in need of urgent repair, rehabilitation, or \nreconstruction. Road condition surveys in 2002 confirm that 28% of the network is in good or fair \ncondition,  35%  in  poor  condition,  28%  in  bad  condition,  and  6%  under  reconstruction  or \nrehabilitation. An assessment of the road sector is presented in Appendix 3. Road transport is \nthe dominant mode of transport within Cambodia, accounting for 65% of all passenger traffic \nand 70% of all cargo traffic, with rail, river, and air transport sharing the rest. Subregional traffic \nis dominated by road and river modes catering to cargo traffic, and air and road transport \ncatering to passenger traffic. Subregional traffic is still modest, but Cambodia and its neighbors \nare making great efforts at promoting and easing international traffic, developing effective cross-\nborder agreements to facilitate movement of goods and people, adopting uniform navigational \nrules on the Mekong River, and developing border crossing infrastructure and border access \nroads. \n \n5.  Substantial  parts  of  Cambodia\u2019s  primary  road  network  form  part  of  designated \nsubregional road transport corridors, principal among those being GMS Regional Highway 1 \n(also known as Asian Highway 1) connecting Bangkok, Phnom Penh, and Ho Chi Minh City via \nNR5 and NR1 in Cambodia. The road section from Poipet on the Cambodia-Thailand border to \nSisophon represents the last remaining gap on GMS Regional Highway 1 to be rehabilitated. \n \n6.  The Project has enormous potential to facilitate the movement of goods and people \nbetween Cambodia and Thailand, given the fast-growing economic interaction that is taking \nplace between the two countries. Cross-border trade between Cambodia and Thailand along \nNR5 has expanded significantly over the past few years. The value of recorded cross-border \ntrade  through  the  Poipet-Aranyaphathet  border  crossing  increased  considerably  from \n$27.0 million in 1992 to $238.0 million in 1999, an annual compound growth rate of 36%. Much \nof this growth was caused by the rerouting of trade from other entry points to Poipet, reflecting \nthe improvements in road conditions on NR5 and the restoration of peace in the area. Thus, the \nshare of total bilateral trade routed through Poipet increased from 14% in 1992 to 65% in 1999 \n(Figure 1). Cross-border overland tourism from Thailand has also become more common in \nrecent years, with 73,000 persons passing through the border into Cambodia during the first 6 \nmonths of 2002, a figure that is expected to increase significantly when the road is improved. \nNR6 takes the network through Siem Reap, which is the site of Angkor Wat, a World Heritage \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1992.

Government Policy for the Sector \n7.  Under the April 2001 draft Second Five-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan 2001\u2013\n2005 (SEDP II), the policy objective of rehabilitating and maintaining transport infrastructure is \nto be achieved by giving priority to road rehabilitation and to improvements in road operations \nand maintenance capability. The Five-Year Road Master Plan (2000\u20132005) has three main \naims:  (i) to  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  the  main  national  roads,  thereby  improving  land \ntransport throughout the nation; (ii) to build road links to neighboring countries, thereby opening \nup some of the more remote areas of the country to international trade and tourism; and (iii) to \ndevelop a sustainable road maintenance program, thereby ensuring that investment in road \nrehabilitation and reconstruction generates sustainable benefits. \n \n8.  Supportive and additional aims are to (i) provide all provincial capitals, tourist areas, and \nmajor growth areas with all-weather road access; (ii) ease traffic congestion in and around \nPhnom Penh by undertaking a study of options for traffic calming solutions (such as bypasses), \nwith a view to formulating and implementing appropriate projects; (iii) undertake emergency \nrehabilitation of provincial roads in order to better link provincial towns with district capitals and \nurban areas; (iv) make supplementary investments in bridges and ferry sites; (v) ensure as far \nas possible that the maintenance of designated national and provincial roads, bridges, and \nferries, and the control and regulation of vehicles, be self-financing from vehicle registration \ncharges, tolls, international transit charges, fuel levies, or other related taxes and duties; and \n(vi) ensure that as far as possible, all provincial, urban, and rural roads are maintained from \nlocally generated funds. \n \n9.  A draft Traffic Act is pending at the National Assembly and a proposed subdecree on \nroads is being developed by MPWT. The draft Act contains penal provisions, traffic rules, \ntechnical standards for signs and signals, technical standards for vehicle components, and other ", "4 \nelements. However, there are no guidelines for road construction and repair, road transport, \ndriver training, the information system, and other important issues that should be included in the \nsubdecree. Given the fact that motorization and road-borne trade are increasing significantly, \nthe road sector will be the primary focus of policy, legislative and institutional support, and as \nsuch will require an effective enabling environment that should be provided through the Road \nAct.  \n \n4.  Poverty in Northwestern Cambodia \n10.  The provinces of Siem Reap, Banteay Meanchey, and Oddar Meanchey in northwestern \nCambodia, where the Project is located, have received minimal development assistance in the \npast  because  of  war  and  insecurity,  and  suffer  from  a  high  incidence  of  poverty  and \nvulnerability, as shown in a 1999 World Food Program poverty mapping study. Poverty is \nwidespread in the area with severe problems of accessibility during the rainy season. This is \nespecially  evident  for  Oddar  Meanchey.  The  study  suggests  that  no  less  than  60%  of \nhouseholds suffer from food deficiency. Although there is some scope for foraging, hunting, and \ngathering to supplement precarious livelihoods, most households find their food stocks depleted \nwithin 4 months of harvest. It is estimated that 40\u201360% of households are below the official \npoverty line. Government services, such as health and education, rarely reach the interior and \ntend to be restricted to peri-urban areas. Family spacing is nonexistent and reproductive health \nservices are largely inaccessible due to the widely dispersed nature of the population and long \ntravel distances, especially within Oddar Meanchey. \n \n11.  The provinces of Siem Reap, Banteay Meanchey, and Oddar Meanchey are some of the \nmost backward in Cambodia in terms of farming practices, physical infrastructure, and social, \nhealth, and utility services. Drinking water is usually obtained from rainwater stored in open \ndepressions,  clay  pots,  or  from  bore-wells;  latrines  are  virtually  nonexistent.  Clinics  and \nhospitals are located in the district headquarters, entailing long travel times and high costs. \nWhile many households have cattle for tillage and transport, motorcycles and television sets are \nvery few. Generally, housing conditions are very poor, especially along NR56 and NR68 and in \nareas further away from the main centers. Access to basic health and education services is \nfragmentary, owing to the relative remoteness of the villages and populations living in the \nnorthwestern area served by NR56 and NR68. Road conditions are extremely poor with virtually \nall bridges broken or unusable. Owing to lack of continuous access, the traffic consists of \nmotorbikes, animal carts, and taxi-vans. Transport costs are predictably high as travel time is \nlong. \n \n12.  The overall poverty estimate for the project area is about 40%. However, there are \nsignificant variations, with the areas serviced by better roads displaying the lowest poverty level \n(25%), while NR56 and areas serviced by poor roads have very high poverty levels (over 60%). \nThus, quite apart from relatively high poverty levels in the project area compared with the \nnational situation, there are deep pockets of extensive poverty, much of which is related to the \nrelative physical remoteness and poor infrastructure in the area. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Asian Development Bank\u2019s Goals and Objectives for Cambodia \n13.  The  three  priority  areas  of  the  ADB  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)\u2014rural \neconomic development, human resources development, and private sector development\u2014and \nthe 10 sectors through which the strategy is to be implemented, remain valid in light of the \ncurrent development situation. The 2001 and 2002 operational programs constituted a first ", "5 \nphase of implementing the strategy. The program of lending and nonlending assistance for \n2003\u20132005 constitutes a second phase, substantially completing considerable work in the 10 \nsectors.  The  CSP  has  been  further  strengthened  by  provision  of  a  sharper  focus  on  the \nimplications of the state reform program\u2014especially decentralization of public administration\u2014\nand by enhancement of the poverty impact of sector interventions to support the Government\u2019s \ngoal of achieving its poverty reduction targets, in light of projected gross domestic product  \ngrowth.  \n \n2.  Lessons Learned \n14.  Given the limited duration of ADB assistance to Cambodia, it is still somewhat early to \nsystematically assess the impact of its interventions. However, as ADB was the first major \nfunding agency to return to Cambodia, its interventions came at a critical time and undoubtedly \nhave had a positive impact. The Special Rehabilitation Assistance Loan4 is the only project that \nhas been postevaluated. The project, which was rated successful, had several components to \nsupport the transport, energy, agriculture, and education sectors. The performances of both the \nGovernment and ADB were also rated successful. \n \n15.  For the road sector, the principal lesson thus far is that of the need to develop more \neffective  network  planning  mechanisms,  including  road  classification  and  referencing,  road \nmanagement  systems  (operations  and  maintenance),  greater  involvement  of  private  sector \ninterests, development of the domestic contracting industry, standardization of procedures (such \nas  procurement  and  tendering  documentation,  financial  management,  and  performance \nmonitoring), and standardization of road designs. With increasing numbers and sophistication of \ncontracts,  contract  management  will  have  to  be  significantly  improved  through  appropriate \ntraining for officials and contractors. More effective supervision of contractor performance will \nimprove road quality, which itself needs improvement in the areas of site supervision and \nmaterials testing standards. At the institutional level, MPWT needs to make more effort to retain \ntrained staff for effective project supervision. Enforcement of truck overloading policies needs to \nbe strengthened, as well as roadworthiness inspections and collection of penalties. Road safety \nimprovements  should  be  addressed  with  more  extensive  awareness  and  driver  training \ncampaigns. Mine awareness programs should also be expanded.  \n \n16.  Recent experience with resettlement issues has provided valuable lessons, including the \nnecessity for (i) properly compensating people for loss of land use in the right-of-way (ROW) \nand appropriately valued replacement cost for structures; (ii) providing compensation for lost \nincome;  (iii) appropriately  conducted  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  reporting; \n(iv) separating  resettlement  planning  and  implementation  from  regulatory  agencies;  and \n(v) building local capacity for resettlement planning, implementation, and monitoring. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n17.  The  primary  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  promote  general  economic  growth  at \nsubregional and national levels and to promote economic and social development in the project \narea of influence. The Project will (i) promote economic growth at subregional and national \nlevels by reducing the cost and increasing the reliability of transport, including transport for \ntourism, which is a major growth industry; (ii) reduce poverty by providing all-year, all-weather \naccess to employment opportunities, markets, and growth centers; (iii) improve social conditions \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1992.

Components and Outputs \n1.  Civil Works \na.  NR5 and NR6 \n18.  The Project will rehabilitate a road section of about 150 km of highway and about 45 \nbridges on NR5 and NR6. NR5 and NR6 connect three major towns in the area: Siem Reap, \nSisophon (both provincial capitals), and Poipet (the primary border crossing between Cambodia \nand Thailand). From Poipet there is a direct highway connection to Bangkok, and from Sisophon \nand Siem Reap there are direct highway connections to Phnom Penh, running east and west of \nTonle Sap, respectively. Siem Reap on NR6 is the center of an established and growing tourism \nindustry based on Angkor Wat and many other historic temples in the area. NR6 connects Siem \nReap to the southern part of Viet Nam through Phnom Penh, while NR5 also links Cambodia \nwith Thailand and southern Viet Nam.  \n \n19.  The road traverses primarily agricultural land. Only a few villages are located at the \nroadside, the majority of the population living in the hinterland along the secondary and tertiary \nroad network. The agricultural potential of the area is high, but presently underutilized due to \nwidespread  unexploded  ordnance  (UXO),  which  also  hinders  the  resettlement  of  people \ndisplaced  during  the  years  of  civil  strife.  The  ongoing  ADB-financed  Northwestern  Rural \nDevelopment Project (NRDP),5 which is located in the general area of influence of the proposed \nProject, includes a significant component of rural roads rehabilitation. The rural roads all link into \nthe project road, which form the spine of the local road networks and provide the connection to \nhigher-growth centers. Full realization of the intended benefits from NRDP will depend on \nrehabilitation of the highways that provide access. \n \n20.  The current condition of the project roads is very poor, with most of the pavements \ncompletely failed and covered with graded dirt. These sections of the road are impassable \nduring the wet season. The road has a large number of cross-drainage structures (over 100 \nculverts and 50 bridges) that are located mainly between Sisophon and Siem Reap. The road \nborders the Tonle Sap floodplain and is crossed by a large number of tributaries to the Tonle \nSap.  Beyond  Sisophon  the  land  is  elevated  and  dry.  Most  bridges  were  either  severely \ndamaged or demolished during the years of civil strife and many have been replaced with \ntemporary Bailey bridges. The Bailey bridges are narrow and many are partly failed. The road \nembankment  is  significantly  deteriorated  in  some  places.  During  the  wet  season,  certain \nsections are often inundated. \n \n21.  Present traffic on the project road consists primarily of pedestrians, cycles, motorcycles, \ncars  and  pickups,  trucks  and  heavy  truck-trailer  combinations,  and  some  buses.  The \nrehabilitated road will generate significant traffic serving local traffic needs, the rapidly growing \ntourism centered around Siem Reap, and subregional trade between Cambodia and Thailand. \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nCambodia for the Northwestern Rural Development Project. Manila. ", "7 \nTrade with Thailand via Poipet has been growing rapidly in recent years, in step with the \nongoing rehabilitation of NR5 between Sisophon and Phnom Penh, and the termination of \nhostilities in the area in 1998. The compound annual growth rate for cross border trade via \nPoipet was 36% between 1992 and 1999. Customs data for Poipet border crossing indicate that \nimport trade averaged approximately 584,000 tons per annum in 2000 and 2001,6 generating an \nestimated 55% of current truck traffic on NR5 between Poipet and Sisophon. \n \n22.  The output of the Project will be a two-lane asphalt concrete carriageway with paved \nshoulders to safely accommodate light motorized and nonmotorized traffic. The road cross-\nsection will meet the Regional Highway standards agreed by the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) member countries. Although the road alignment will be generally retained, \nhorizontal  and  vertical  curves  at  bridge  approaches  will  be  improved.  The  road  will  have \nadequate drainage structures and the embankment will be raised to 20-year event flood level. \nThe design will ensure that possible adverse impacts of road drainage arrangements on water \nmanagement on adjacent agricultural land will be minimized. Safety improvement measures \nappropriate for accident black spots, such as schools, will be incorporated during the detailed \ndesign. Cross-border facilities will be constructed in Poipet, which will provide single-stop, \nsingle-window facilities for vehicles.7 Weigh stations will be constructed on NR5 in Poipet and \non NR6 in Siem Reap to deter overloaded traffic. \n \n23.  The Project has sought opportunities to address gender concerns in road construction-\nrelated  activities.  In  civil  works  construction  contracts,  contractors  will  be  required  not  to \ndiscriminate against the employment and wages of women in the road construction labor force. \nContractors will also be required to ensure that adequate health and sanitation facilities are \navailable to women workers. \n \nb.  NR56 and NR68 \n24.  The Project will reconstruct about 50 bridges on the provincial roads NR56, connecting \nSisophon to Samrong (114 km), and NR68, connecting Samrong to Kralanh (79 km), which \nforms a loop of about 200 km to the north of NR6. A road north of Samrong links with the \nnational border with Thailand. In addition to Samrong, the road traverses farm villages including \nThmor Pouk and Banteay Chhmar on NR56, and Chong Kai and Srei Snam on NR68. The \npavement of NR56 and NR68 is natural gravel with cobblestones embedded in the laterite \nsurface. The formation is typically 7\u20138 meters (m) wide. There are some 50 bridges on the \nroute,  distributed  approximately  one  third  on  NR56  and  two  thirds  on  NR68.  Most  of  the \nstanding bridges are in extremely poor condition and several others have collapsed. The critical \nneed for accessibility on the route is the replacement of all bridges. Traffic is light on NR56 and \nvery light on NR68 due to disconnection at collapsed bridges. However, traffic will increase \nwhen access is restored under the Project. Two-lane bridges or culverts of 10 m width will \nreplace all the existing bridges. To avoid entry of overloaded trucks, weigh stations will be \nconstructed in the vicinity of the intersection of NR56, NR68, and the road leading to the border \nwith Thailand. \n \n25.  Rehabilitation of the pavements of NR56 and NR68 is not envisaged under the Project. \nTo ensure all-year, all-weather access, the construction of embankments and pavements and \nthe improvement of drainage may be needed at certain sections. MPWT will undertake those \nworks and continue to provide maintenance works, such as periodic regraveling and grading of \n                                                 \n6  Source: Cambodia Customs and Excise Department, Banteay Meanchey Province. \n7  Agreement Between and Among the Governments of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, the Kingdom of \nThailand, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, and Kingdom of Cambodia for the Facilitation of Cross-Border \nTransport of Goods and People, 29 November 2001 (amendment to 26 November 1999 Agreement).

The resettlement study (presented in Supplementary Appendix A) has shown that the \nProject will cause minimal land acquisition impact as it will follow the existing alignment with \nsome widening to about 11 m carriageway-shoulder width. The road is contained within a 60 m-\nwide ROW that is reasonably well demarcated and respected for the majority of its length. The \nmain land use along the corridor of impact (COI) is agriculture. The Project will require either \ntemporary (during construction) or permanent land acquisition of approximately 60 hectares (ha) \nof a combination of 70% agricultural, 10% residential/commercial, and 10% unused land along \nNR5  and  NR6,  affecting  approximately  2,000  farmers,  240  houses  and  house-shops,  300 \nroadside  stalls,  as  well  as  fruit  and  shade  trees.  The  structures  are  largely  made  of \nsemipermanent and movable materials (e.g., wood, bamboo, or light materials) and consist of \nvarious types of shops. Some irrigation canals will be disrupted and there will be temporary land \nloss during construction. Improvements to NR56 and NR68 will involve only replacement of all \nof the bridges for which there will be very minimal, if any, land acquisition. Any land acquisition \nfor NR56 and NR68 will be carried out in accordance with the approved resettlement plan. A \ndetailed resettlement plan has been prepared in line with government and ADB policies and \nprocedures. A summary of the resettlement plan is provided in Appendix 4.  \n \n3.  Poverty Reduction Monitoring Program \n27.  A detailed socioeconomic survey (presented in Supplementary Appendix B) was carried \nout to establish baseline conditions to enable poverty monitoring and impact evaluation studies \nto be conducted during and after project completion. The baseline data include demographic \nand  health  information,  with  a  particular  focus  on  HIV/AIDS.  The  survey  has  established \nbenchmarks in terms of land and asset ownership, labor use, migration patterns, incomes and \nexpenditures, access to services and credit, farm production, tenancy arrangements, conditions \nof transport infrastructure, and access to common property resources.  \n \n28.  Under the Project, two surveys will be carried out. The first survey will be conducted \nwithin 2 years of initiation of construction while the second survey will be conducted at project \ncompletion. The first survey will allow monitoring of socioeconomic conditions along the lines of \nthe baseline survey, and the second will enable impact assessment analysis. The objective of \nthe surveys is to generate panel data at two points in time to enable comparison with the \nbaseline. In principle, the methodology followed should be similar to the baseline approach. This \nwill involve division of the project area into three categories for sampling purposes: (i) in the \nvicinity of a good section of the primary road, (ii) in areas close to a poor section of the primary \nroad, and (iii) areas within the influence area of the loop section. Villages along a 3\u20135 km radius \nfrom the road sections will be identified and 10\u201320% sampled at the first stage. A total of 250\u2013\n300 households are planned sampled at random from those villages. It is expected that the \nGovernment will conduct a comprehensive follow-up survey after 2\u20133 years of completion of \ncivil works to establish in more detail the poverty reduction impacts of the Project.  \n ", "9 \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Strengthening the Ministry of Public Works and Transport \n \na.  Strategic Planning and Project Management in the Ministry of Public \nWorks and Transport \n \n29.  The current planning process at MPWT needs considerable strengthening. Governance \nis obviously an issue. The Department of Planning (DOP) prepares overall plans by compiling \nproposals  received  by  the  planning  units  from  other  MPWT  departments.  However,  these \nproposals  are  not  based  on  proper  evaluation  processes,  particularly  economic  or  social \nanalyses. ADB earlier provided technical assistance8 for training to core DOP staff in transport \nplanning and related subjects to equip them with basic skills in undertaking strategic, multimodal \nplanning on a self-sustaining basis and to develop sector policies. Although some capacity was \ndeveloped among DOP staff, DOP has had few opportunities to use the acquired skills owing to \nbudget  and  administrative  constraints,  and  to  turnover  of  trained  staff.  The  core  planning \nfunctions, i.e., policy formulation, traffic forecasting, preparing investment programs, annual \nbudgeting, and database development and maintenance, are not being implemented, owing to \norganizational inefficiencies, the location of DOP in the organizational hierarchy, and a shortage \nof funds to implement change. Appendix 5 shows the current MPWT organization chart. The \nchart sets DOP at the bottom of the hierarchy within the General Department of Administrative \nServices, resulting in a weakening of DOP authority and communication flows to other MPWT \ndepartments.  \n \n30.  There is thus a clear need to move DOP from the General Department of Administrative \nServices closer to MPWT management, so increasing direct accountability to the Minister of \nPublic Works and Transport. Being directly accountable to the Minister, DOP\u2019s primary role \nshould be to provide technical advice to MPWT management on matters related to policy \ndevelopment and strategic planning. \n \n31.  Major rehabilitation works have been financed by external funds, and the projects are \nimplemented by ad hoc project management units (PMUs)/project implementation units (PIUs) \nthat  are  not  formally  within  the  MPWT  organizational  structure.  The  current  management \napproach  is  fragmented,  and  does  not  create  effective  responsibility  and  accountability  in \nMPWT.  The  establishment  of  PMUs/PIUs  for  each  individual  project  results  in  difficulty  in \nmonitoring, adopting uniform technical standards, and sharing experiences on matters related to \nprocurement and project management. An alternative solution for effectively managing external \nagency-funded projects will be formulated through reorganizing MPWT to address the emerging \nissues of coordination, efficiency, transparency, sustainability, and governance. \n \nb.  The Reorganization Process  \n32.  Under  current  government  procedures,  the  overall  organization  structure  of  each \nministry  and  the  responsibilities  of  its  general  directorates  and  departments  have  to  be \napproved  by  the  Council  of  Ministers  through  a  subdecree.  A  radical  change  in  MPWT\u2019s \norganizational  structure  is  not  realistic  in  the  short  term,  given  the  complexity  of  needed \norganizational reforms. To initiate the process of developing the new reorganization, MPWT will \nundertake the reform process in three phases, as described below. The general process, which \nshould benefit from consultations with ADB and other development partners, is presented in \n                                                 \n8  ADB.1995. Technical Assistance to Cambodia for Developing Planning Capacity in the MPWT. Manila. ", "10 \nAppendix 6. In parallel, a social and environment division will be established within 4 months of \nloan effectiveness, and will become fully functional within 6 months of loan effectiveness. \n \ni.  Phase 1 \n33.  In  the  first  phase,  a  high-level  Interministerial  Committee  for  Reorganization  (ICR), \nchaired by the Minister of Public Works and Transport, and comprising representatives from \nMPWT, State Secretariat of Public Functions, Council for Administrative Reform (Office of the \nCouncil  of  Ministers),  and  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  will  be  set  up  prior  to  loan \neffectiveness. The secretariat of the ICR will be DOP, with the director of DOP appointed as \nsecretary of the secretariat. The primary function of the ICR is to review and advise on reform \ndirections proposed by MPWT. The ICR will prepare quarterly progress reports until submission \nof the final report to the Council of Ministers. The Project provides $0.5 million in consulting \nservices to support MPWT in the reform process, and may include personnel policies, legal \nframeworks, financial management, procurement processes, project performance management, \nstandardization  of  technical  and  procedural  manuals,  and  concession  and  privatization \nframeworks. \n \nii.  Phase 2 \n34.  As a first step in the overall reorganization process, DOP will be repositioned to act as \nan effective secretariat to the ICR. The ICR will begin by agreeing on the role and functions of a \nstrengthened DOP accountable to MPWT management. The ICR will (i) define the role and \nresponsibilities of each division within DOP; (ii) identify the types and numbers of management \nand staff positions; (iii) assess current staff capabilities; and (iv) assign staff to positions, and if \nneeded, request staff transfer from the other departments of MPWT to fill the positions. The \ncore functions of the repositioned DOP are generally indicated in Appendix 7. Within 6 months \nof loan effectiveness. The proposal for the repositioned DOP will be submitted by the Minister, \nMPWT to the Council of Ministers. The repositioned DOP will be established and fully functional \nwithin 10 months of loan effectiveness. \n \niii.  Phase 3 \n35.  In  parallel  with  the  repositioning  of  DOP,  and  with  the  assistance  of  consultants \n(institutional specialists, human resources specialists, and others as may be necessary and \nidentified by the ICR) engaged under the Project, the ICR will: (i) using consulting services, as \nneeded and appropriate, and earlier organizational studies prepared under various external \nagency-financed technical assistance activities, and other government documents, identify an \nappropriate mandate for MPWT and define the functions necessary for MPWT to accomplish \nthat mandate; (ii) define the role and responsibilities of each general directorate and department \nneeded  to  execute  the  mandate,  and  if  necessary,  recommend  creating  separate \nagencies/ministerial bodies that would more effectively address transport and public works \nrequirements, e.g., civil aviation authority, inland waterways agency; (iii) develop organizational \nstructures for each agency, particularly the reorganized MPWT-based agency, including lines of \ncommunication and reporting. \n \n36.  In the reorganization process, the ICR will take into account the need to set up project \nmanagement  departments  in  the  structures  to  be  defined,  given  the  continuing  level  of \nexternally financed activities and the need to coordinate those properly and establish common \npractices  and  procedures,  as  appropriate,  in  areas  such  as  procurement  and  technical \nstandards.  An  overall  policy  reform  and  institutional  development  matrix  is  presented  in \nAppendix 8. ", "11 \n \n37.  The  proposed  organizational  structure  of  MPWT  will  be  endorsed  by  the  ICR  and \nsubmitted to the Council of Ministers within 24 months of loan effectiveness.  \n \n2.  Road Network Maintenance Strategy and Funding Mechanism \n38.  Although  a  first  step  has  been  made  by  establishing  the  Fund  for  Repair  and \nMaintenance of Roads (FRMR), it will be necessary for the Government to set up a road fund \nand  a  road  management  board  to  establish  fully  effective  road  maintenance  financing \nmechanisms. Similar approaches are under consideration and development by neighboring \ncountries, namely the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Viet Nam. Drawing \nfrom experience gained to date in the Mekong region as well as in other countries throughout \nAfrica, South America, and several republics of the former Soviet Union, earmarking of a portion \nof road user charges or setting up a road fund is by itself no solution. While this may solve part \nof the problem of security of funding source and dependability of funds for maintenance, a road \nfund  is  not  a  sufficient  condition  on  its  own  for  guaranteeing  a  sustainable  maintenance \nprogram. Clear institutional processes are required to plan and prioritize maintenance works \neffectively, as well as effective procedures for managing and disbursing funds.  \n \n39.  The strategy for developing a more effective road fund will require (i) broadening and \ndeepening the revenue base for the FRMR, (ii) ensuring accessibility to fund resources, and \n(iii) strengthening  and  building  the  institutional  structure  for  planning  and  delivery  of \nmaintenance services. As an initial step, the General Department of Public Works within MPWT, \ntogether with the Contracts Office within the Road Infrastructure Department, could assume a \ndriving  role  with  technical  assistance,  training,  and  support.  The  unit  would  evolve  into  a \nprofessional procurement structured group as institutional capacity is built up, with mirrored \nreplication in the provincial departments. The intention is to reduce large overhead costs of \ntraditional  bureaucratic  structures  and  provide  incentives  to  local  contractors  to  develop \nexpertise and invest in their own equipment as the market for contracted maintenance and \nconstruction builds. Deepening the revenue base of the FRMR should include increases in the \ntransport  tax,  particularly  for  heavy  commercial  vehicles,  annual  vehicle  registration  fees, \ngradual adjustments to fuel levies, and properly designed toll operations.  \n \n40.  While developing the structure of a more substantive and effective road maintenance \nfund, which will likely take several years, it is important to ensure that the current funding levels \nand allocations are maintained and applied to maintenance, with no diversion to nonroad sector \nactivities. This will require that the FRMR be dedicated solely to the road network, with principal \nallocation to the primary and secondary roads, and allowing for a specified allocation (10% as \nidentified  under  the  Poverty  Partnership  Agreement)  to  the  rural  roads.  The  FRMR  thus \nbecomes a network-directed source of maintenance financing.  \n \n41.  To support the Government\u2019s objective of promoting involvement of local contractors in \nroadworks,  international  contractors  are  being  encouraged  to  use  local  subcontractors  for \ncertain types of works, with a view to enabling those local contractors to undertake routine \nmaintenance of roads. Provisions for training local contractors and government officials in the \nplanning and execution of contract-based road maintenance will be included in a proposal for \nmainstreaming poverty reduction approaches, that will be submitted to the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction (JFPR), supplemented by some training under the construction supervision \nservices. The outputs envisage MPWT staff capable of planning, tendering for, and managing \nroutine road maintenance contracts, and local contractors capable of bidding for, contracting, \nand implementing such contracts. \n ", "12 \n3.  HIV/AIDS Program \n42.  HIV/AIDS is spreading in Cambodia. HIV was first detected in Cambodia in 1991 and the \nfirst AIDS case diagnosed in 1993. In less than a decade, the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Cambodia \nbecame one of the most serious and fastest rising in the region. The main mode of transmission \nis currently through heterosexual sex. In 2000, HIV rates among sex workers ranged from 7.7% \nto 58% across provinces with an average of 31% among direct commercial workers and 16% \namong indirect sex workers. Sexually transmitted infection (STI) care and related interventions, \ncombined with 100% condom use promotion and outreach for population groups in high-risk \nsituations, have been identified as key components of HIV prevention in the National Strategy \nfor  Prevention  and  Care  of  HIV/AIDS  and  STIs  for  2001\u20132005.  This  strategy  has  been \nimplemented in the pilot province of Kampong Cham. Banteay Meanchey is one of five new \ntarget provinces for the \u201cTriangle of HIV Prevention\u201d to be strengthened by the end of 2004. A \n2000 survey indicated that approximately 2.8% of all Cambodians were then infected with HIV. \n \n43.  PMU, with advice and guidance from the social and environment unit in the proposed, \nrepositioned Department of Planning of MPWT, will engage a suitably qualified agency (e.g., an \nNGO that is experienced in administering such programs in collaboration with MPWT) through \nlocal competitive bidding to implement a suitably designed campaign among road workers and \nin the local communities in the project-influenced area. The terms of reference for the executing \nagency includes using the \u201cToolkit for HIV Prevention\u201d developed under ADB financing for use \namong mobile populations in the GMS. \n \n4.  Cross-Border Facilities \n44.  The GMS Cross-Border Agreement (footnote 7) is intended to (i) facilitate cross-border \ntransport of goods and people among the countries in the subregion; (ii) harmonize legislation, \nregulations,  and  procedures  relating  to  cross-border  transport;  and  (iii) promote  multimodal \ntransport. Currently, there are four signatories\u2014Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \nThe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Myanmar have indicated their willingness to become \nsignatories. The Project links to the border crossing between Cambodia and Thailand at Poipet. \nThis crossing is included as a GMS pilot site at which streamlined crossing procedures will be \nestablished  to  facilitate  the  development  of  cross-border  trade  and  mobility.  The  Project \nincludes funding for the design and establishment of the physical facilities required for single-\nstop, single-window procedures in Poipet.  \n \n5.  Mainstreaming  Poverty  Reduction  Approaches  into  the  National  Road \nNetwork \n45.  There are a number of poverty-oriented gaps in the Government\u2019s current road program. \nFirst, there is a need to connect the rural roads networks to the national road network by \nrehabilitating  the  intermediary  provincial  roads.  Second,  there  is  a  need  to  develop  more \nopportunities for and capacity of domestic private contractors who are capable and equipped to \ntake on construction and maintenance work on the national and provincial roads. Third, more \nresearch needs to be done on road technologies best suited to Cambodia in terms of directly \nand  indirectly  achieving  poverty  reduction  goals,  including  compilation  and  review  of \nexperiences from other countries. Finally, greater capacity is needed to train engineers, public \nsector  officials,  and  private  sector  contractors  and  consultants  in  road  technologies  and \nmanagement.  \n \n46.  A project concept, Mainstreaming Poverty Reduction Approaches into the National Road \nNetwork (MPRA), has been proposed for grant financing under JFPR to reduce poverty by ", "13 \nmainstreaming pro-poor appropriate technological and capability-building approaches into the \nroad development programs of MPWT and the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD). The \nproject will work toward maximizing the input of local entrepreneurs, materials, labor, and \ningenuity. Thus, there is expected to be both an immediate direct effect on income through \nemployment and a long-term direct effect resulting from the provision of cost-effective tools for \nthe management of the road network. Reflecting the commitment to collaboration between \nMPWT and MRD in their Joint Declaration of March 2000, a steering committee will be set up by \nJanuary 2003 cochaired by both Ministries to guide implementation of the proposed MPRA. \n \n47.  The MPRA is expected to be carried out in collaboration with the International Labour \nOrganization  (ILO).  Currently,  ILO  is  implementing  a  program  of  successful  technical \ncooperation projects in Cambodia to help the Government maximize potential employment \nopportunities in the infrastructure development program, especially in the construction and \nmaintenance of the road network. Increased employment through the development of the road \nnetwork can be achieved through the use of labor-based appropriate technologies. ADB will \npartner  with  ILO  in  seeking  to  mainstream  employment-generating  approaches  within \ngovernment agencies such as MPWT, MRD, and educational institutes. ILO has an existing \npartnership with ADB in implementing the integrated rural accessibility planning component in \nfour provinces under the ADB-financed Northwest Rural Development Project.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n48.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $77.5 million equivalent. Foreign exchange \ncosts are estimated at $52.0 million representing 67.1% of the total project cost. The local \ncurrency cost is estimated at $25.5 million equivalent representing 32.9% of the total cost. The \ncost estimates are shown in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 9. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n49.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of SDR 37.885 million ($50.0 million equivalent) \nfrom its Special Funds resources to cover 82.7% of the entire foreign cost of the Project and \n27.5% of the local currency costs. The OPEC Fund for International Development (OPEC Fund) \nhas  confirmed  cofinancing  of  the  proposed  ADB  loan.  The  OPEC  Fund  contribution  of \n$10.0 million will be used to cover the remaining foreign exchange requirements ($9.0 million) \nand part of the local currency costs ($1.0 million). The remaining local currency cost of the \nProject ($17.5 million, 22.6% of total project costs) will be met by the Government from its own \nresources. \n \n50.  The Borrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia. The repayment period of the proposed \nloan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1.0% during \nthe grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The proceeds of the loan will be made available by the \nBorrower to the Executing Agency through budgetary allocations. ADB will administer the OPEC \nFund loan and for this purpose will enter into an agreement with the OPEC Fund. The terms of \nthe OPEC Fund loan are maturity of 20 years, with an interest rate of 1.0% per annum, a \nservice charge of 1.0% per annum, and a grace period of 5 years.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n51.  MPWT will be the Executing Agency for the Project. For project implementation, MPWT \nwill set up a project management unit (PMU), staffed with suitably qualified personnel who will ", "15 \ncarry  out  their  tasks  under  the  general  guidance  of  the  director  general  of  the  General \nDepartment of Public Works. MPWT has substantial experience in implementing ADB-financed \nroad projects through four earlier activities. \n \n52.  MPWT will appoint a full-time project director for the PMU, supported by a project \nmanager. MPWT will ensure that the persons appointed will be (i) senior officials with adequate \ntechnical and administration experience and qualifications acceptable to ADB, and (ii) assisted \nby appropriate and adequate technical and administrative staff. The Government will exert its \nbest endeavors to ensure that, subject to satisfactory performance, the initially appointed project \ndirector  and  project  manager  will  remain  in  the  position  for  the  duration  of  project \nimplementation. The project director will have overall responsibility for implementation of the \nProject and will also act as coordinator for interministerial activities. The project manager will be \nresponsible for day-to-day operations under the Project. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n53.  The Project will be implemented over 4 years. The Project is expected to become \neffective  in  February  2003,  and  civil  works  to  be  completed  by  31  December  2006.  The \nimplementation  schedule  is  presented  in  Appendix  10.  The  procurement  target  dates  are \npresented in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n3.  Procurement \n54.  Procurement of civil works for the project roads will be undertaken in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement following international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures \nfor international contractors who may associate with local contractors in joint ventures. The civil \nworks will be carried out through four contract packages for ICB valued at about $17.7 million, \n$18.5 million, $14.7 million, and $7.5 million. The contract packages are presented in Appendix \n11. The bidding documents will be consistent with ADB\u2019s sample bidding documents, and will \ninclude clauses that reflect ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy. A summary of the design approach and \ntechnical standards for the roads and bridges is presented in Appendix 12.  \n \n55.  In response to the Government\u2019s request, ADB has approved advance procurement \naction,  including  selection  of  construction  supervision  services  (quality  and  cost-based \nselection),  prequalification  of  bidders,  preparation  of  ADB-approved  bidding  documents \n(including specifications), issuance of invitations to bid, evaluation of bids, and essential related \nactivities up to the award of contracts. The Government has been advised that approval of \nadvance action does not in any way commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n56.  A total of 200 person-months of international and 402 of domestic consulting inputs will \nbe required to support project implementation associated with the civil works. The consultants \nfinanced from ADB-administered funds will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. The outline terms of reference for construction supervision services are provided in \nAppendix 13. Terms of reference for other consulting services, such as those associated with \nreorganization, will be established during project implementation in consultation with ADB. \n ", "16 \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n57.  An  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook as amended from time to time, and \ndetailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in \nthe imprest account will be based on estimated expenditures for 6 months, not to exceed \n$500,000. The account will be established with a reputable commercial bank in Cambodia \nacceptable to ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures will be followed for \nreimbursement of expenditures and for the liquidation of each imprest account for payments not \nexceeding $50,000 equivalent in each case. Loan disbursements for the consulting services \ncontracts that are to be procured through domestic and international selection will make use of \nthe direct payment procedures defined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n58.  MPWT will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and \nservices financed from the loan proceeds, the financing resources received, the expenditures \nincurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. The accounts for all project expenditures will \nbe set up in accordance with consistent and sound accounting principles. Independent auditors \nacceptable to ADB will audit consolidated project accounts and related financial statements \nannually.  Unaudited  accounts  and  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  3 \nmonths, and audited accounts and financial statements not later than 9 months after the end of \nthe fiscal year to which they relate. \n \n59.  The construction supervision consultant will submit monthly progress reports to MPWT \nand ADB. MPWT will ensure that in the reports the consultant includes progress in civil works \nand disbursement, and the status of land acquisition, resettlement, environmental management, \ntraining, and any other activities identified in the terms of reference agreed with the construction \nsupervision consultant. \n \n60.  Within  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  civil  works,  MPWT  will  request  the \nconstruction supervision consultant to submit a project completion report in a format acceptable \nto MPWT and ADB. MPWT will monitor project preparation and implementation in accordance \nwith the implementation schedule, and keep ADB informed of any significant deviations that \ncould result in the schedule not being met. The form and content of the report will be in a format \nagreed with ADB during further processing of the Project.  \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n61.  MPWT, assisted by the construction supervision consultant, will develop a baseline for \nperformance monitoring in accordance with ADB's Project Performance Management System \nHandbook,  and  establish  systematic  project  performance  monitoring,  including  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation. The required surveys will be conducted prior to construction, at \nproject midterm, and 6 months after project completion. The field information to be collected will \ninclude (i) road condition and road roughness; (ii) traffic volume; (iii) road freight rates and \npassenger fares; (iii) prices in local markets for agricultural produce, agricultural inputs, and \nbasic  household  goods;  and  (iv) any  other  essential  information,  including  socioeconomic \nindicators and key indicators. An indicative framework is presented in Supplementary Appendix \nD. The final form and content of reporting will be agreed with ADB during implementation of the \nProject. \n ", "17 \n8.  Project Review \n62.  In addition to regular reviews by ADB, a midterm review of project implementation will be \ncarried out at the end of the second year. Representatives of ADB, the Government, and any \ncofinancier will take part in the review. The review will allow for any necessary midcourse \ncorrections to ensure successful project implementation and achievement of objectives. On \ncompletion of the Project, a final review will be undertaken. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n63.  The  Project  will  promote  economic  growth  from  increased:  agricultural  production; \ntourism around the many historic temples throughout the project area; national and subregional \ntrade; and local employment creation, which will help combat widespread poverty, especially in \nthe rural areas. The Project will also provide efficient all-weather access to the rural areas in \nthree provinces in northwestern Cambodia; to the provincial and commercial centers at Siem \nReap, Sisophon, and Samrong; and to Poipet, Cambodia\u2019s primary border crossing point with \nThailand. By reducing road transport cost and improving access reliability, the Project will \ngenerate substantial direct economic benefits from future savings in vehicle operating costs, \nlogistics,  and  road  maintenance.  It  will  also  relieve  the  isolation  of  remote  rural  areas  by \nreducing travel cost and time, and by eliminating seasonal disruption of traffic during the wet \nseason, thus enabling continuous trade and economic exchange and undisrupted access to \nschools,9 health services,10 and other services in rural areas. Finally, the Project will enhance \nthe impact of the Northwestern Rural Development Project by providing crucial interconnection \nof rural road networks without which \u201c. . . the country will remain fragmented and the rural roads \nwill, at best, lead to small provincial towns, isolating the poor population and limiting the benefits \nof trade available to them.\u201d11 The main benefits of the Project are directly related to traffic, \nincluding (i) savings in vehicle operating costs, (ii) savings in vehicle and passenger time costs, \nand (iii) benefits from traffic generated by the reduction in transport costs. Additional benefits \nderived  from  generated  traffic  include  (iv) producer  surplus  benefits,  (v) additional  income \nengendered by tourism, (vi) additional income from the increased agricultural activity stemming \nfrom the rehabilitation of the road, and (vii) social benefits arising from better access to schools, \nmedical facilities, and other social services. Derived subregional benefits that have not been \nquantified are long term, associated with the road\u2019s contribution to increased integration of the \neconomies of Thailand, Cambodia, and Viet Nam that, eventually, will enable the establishment \nof new and more efficient trading and transport patterns in the subregion. The economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) is 30.7%. The economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Impacts \n1.  Social Impacts \n64.  To maximize impacts on the poor, the Project has included the provision of all-year, all \nweather accessibility along NR56 and NR68, which form a loop in Oddar Meanchey. The loop \nwill directly feed into the Northwestern Rural Development Project and enhance the joint poverty \n                                                 \n9  Some schools in the project area are reported to close during the wet season due to the impassibility of the road \nnetwork. \n10  Access to health services is particularly important during the wet season where the project area is severely \naffected by malaria. \n11  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan for \nCambodia for the Northwestern Rural Development Project. Manila. ", "18 \nimpacts of both NR6 and NR5 under the Project and the impacts identified under NRDP. The \nProject provides for an integrated approach linking feeder roads under NRDP with provincial \nroads and the national highway. Northwestern Cambodia and the project area are potentially \nrich: there is abundant land, although large areas are yet to be cleared of mines; and there are \nvery significant forest and fisheries resources. The population would benefit immensely from \nimproved accessibility, better market integration (including that of the labor market), and greater \naccess to services and resources. Thus, the longer-run outlook for the project area is very \npositive. The Project will seek to address some of the negative aspects of cross-border traffic \n(e.g., HIV/AIDS, drugs, and human trafficking)  and maximize the positive trade-enhancing and \nlabor-generating impacts. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is presented in \nAppendix 14. \n \n2.  Environmental Impacts \n65.  The Tonle Sap is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia. It covers an area of \napproximately 250,000 ha in the dry season, and extends to 1,000,000 ha during the wet \nseason. NR6 crosses a floodplain that is linked to the upper part of the Tonle Sap. Both the \nfloodplain and the Tonle Sap are essential and linked components of the fisheries of the area. \nThe huge wetland system with its habitat diversity supports one of the most productive fisheries \nin Asia. The road linking Siem Reap and Poipet is situated at about 10 m above sea level on a \nlarge area of the central plain that surrounds Tonle Sap. The plain rises imperceptibly at a \ngradient of about 0.03 % until it encounters the lower slopes of the Chuor Phnum Dangrek \nrange that forms the divide between Cambodia and Thailand. The level of the Tonle Sap varies \nseasonally between 1.1 m and 10.0 m. As the road skirts the flood area, it is within the influence \narea, but is recognized as being in an area of least impact and hence generally environmentally \nbenign. \n \n66.  Major  potential  environmental  impacts  are  (i) impacts  on  drainage;  (ii) impacts  on \nfishery;  (iii) noise  and  dust;  (iv) mismanagement  of  construction  materials  and  sites;  and \n(v) health and safety. Mitigation measures have been identified and can be implemented without \ndifficulty. The initial environmental examination (IEE), together with an appropriately designed \nenvironmental management plan and monitoring programs, is considered sufficient to meet the \nenvironmental impact assessment requirements of the Project. The summary IEE is presented \nin Appendix 15. The full IEE is in Supplementary Appendix F. The Project will be implemented in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Infrastructure Projects. \n \nC.  Risks \n67.  The main risks associated with the Project are (i) lower than expected traffic levels; \n(ii) delayed  and  suboptimal  performance  of  contractors  and  supervision;  (iii) delay  in \nprocurement and local counterpart funding; (iv) lack of adequate counterpart staff; (v) delayed or \ninadequate execution of mitigating measures, notably resettlement and HIV/AIDS reduction, and \n(v) insufficient or late implementation of institutional strengthening required to enable adequate \nfuture  management  and  maintenance  of  the  roads.  After  construction,  the  main  risks  are \nassociated with the funding and management of maintenance of the roads, especially the loop \nroad,  which  will  require  regular  grading  and  regraveling.  Considering  the  Government\u2019s \ncommitment to the Project and the project\u2019s high economic return, the integrated benefits and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs, given the likelihood of the risks occurring. \n ", "19 \nV.  ASSURANCES \n68.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MPWT have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Environmental Management. MPWT will ensure that adverse environmental impacts of \nthe Project will be minimized through the appropriate mitigation measures indicated in \nthe IEE. MPWT will develop and implement an environmental management plan for the \nProject. MPWT will ensure that such problems as drainage, landslides, and erosion, as \nwell as the prevention of damage to the natural environment, receive due consideration \nand that the mitigation measures identified in the IEE are incorporated in the design, \nconstruction, and operation and maintenance of facilities supported by the Project. \n \n(ii)  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. MPWT will be responsible for the acquisition of \nthe land required for the Project and, if required, relocation and resettlement of project-\naffected  persons.  MPWT  will  ensure  that  such  land  acquisition,  compensation, \nrelocation, and resettlement is carried out in accordance with the resettlement plan \nagreed upon between the Borrower and ADB, the Borrower\u2019s laws, regulations and \nprocedures,  and  ADB\u2019s  requirements  as  defined  in  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement and the Handbook on Resettlement. In the case of discrepancies between \nthe  Borrower\u2019s  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures,  and  ADB\u2019s  requirements,  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements will apply.  \n \n(iii)  Maintenance  Management  System.  MPWT  will  ensure  that  the  road  maintenance \nmanagement system developed for Kampot, Kampong Cham, and Kandal provinces is \nadopted as the general approach applicable for all national and provincial roads under \nthe administration of MPWT. \n \n(iv)  Operation and Maintenance of Project Roads. MPWT will be responsible for the \noperation  and  maintenance  of  the  project  road  sections  through  proper  technical \nsupervision and adequate allocation of funds. MPWT will carry out routine and periodic \nmaintenance works on NR56 and NR68 to ensure all-year, all-weather access along the \nroute, especially in support of the infrastructure improvements under the Project. \n \n(v)  Maintenance Financing. The Government will ensure that adequate funding is made \navailable  for  programmed  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  works  on  national  and \nprovincial roads from the existing Fund for Road Maintenance and Repair. In compliance \nwith Prakas 399 and Subdecree 39, the resources of the Fund for Road Maintenance \nand Repair will be used solely for the purposes of maintenance of the road network, with \nat least 10% reserved for rural roads. \n \n(vi)  Governance. MPWT will (i) ensure the application of a uniform and effective financial \nand accounting system that meets internationally recognized standards and (ii) apply \nprocurement  processes  on  the  basis  of  transparency,  simplicity,  and  client \nresponsiveness.  \n \n(vii)  Health Risks. MPWT will ensure that the civil works contracts include legally mandated \nprovisions  on  health,  sanitation,  and  appropriate  working  conditions,  including \naccommodation, where appropriate, for construction workers at campsites during the \nconstruction period.  \n ", "20 \n(viii)  Labor  Laws.  MPWT  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works  contractors  (i) comply  with  all \napplicable  labor  laws,  including  elimination  of  gender-differentiated  wages  and  food \nrations, (ii) do not employ child labor in the construction activities, and (iii) seek to ensure \nthe maximum level of female participation in appropriate construction works. \n \n(ix)  Social and Environment Division. Within 4 months of the Effective Date, MPWT will \ncreate  a  Social  and  Environment  Division  in  the  Department  of  Planning  to  be \ntransferred to the repositioned Department of Planning when established. The Social \nand  Environment  Division  will  be  fully  functional  within  6  months  of  the  loan \neffectiveness. In coordination with relevant agencies, it will be responsible for social and \nenvironmental  issues  across  all  sectors  under  MPWT\u2019s  authority,  particularly \nresettlement planning and management, HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking efforts, poverty \nand social impact assessments, labor practices and environmental management. \n \n(x)  Repositioned Department of Planning. Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the \nproposal for a repositioned Department of Planning will be submitted by the Minister, \nMPWT to the Council of Ministers and the repositioned Department of Planning will be \nestablished and fully functional within 10 months of loan effectiveness. The Department \nof Planning or its successor, as applicable, will, among other things, be responsible for \ndeveloping,  reviewing,  negotiating,  recommending,  and  monitoring  all  concession \nagreements in the transport sector. \n \n(xi)  ICR Report. Within 24 months of loan effectiveness, the ICR will submit, for approval of \nthe Council of Ministers, a detailed report describing a new structure for MPWT, which \nmay involve setting out separate agencies from the existing organizational structure.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n69.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve (i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing

Introduction \n1.  The  road  network  in  Cambodia  covers  about  35,500  kilometers  (km),  including \napproximately 4,000 km of national roads, 3,500 km of provincial roads, and 28,000 km of rural \nand strategic roads. The roads have a significant number of bridges, about 4,000 on the \nnational roads alone. The primary roads consists of National Roads 1-9, which are national \nhighways that  extend from Phnom Penh to provincial capitals and the main access points to the \ncountry. Lesser national roads with 2-digit numbers are provincial highways that connect the \nprovincial capitals and connect to minor border crossings and important domestic centers. The \nsecondary (provincial roads) and tertiary (rural and strategic roads) serve local transport needs. \nThe road network was mostly built before 1960. The general design standards thus cater to \nlighter traffic than current loads, with many existing bridges designed for gross vehicle road \nweights of 10 tons, well below the current standard of up to 30 tons. Bridges have often \ncollapsed due to overloading. Most of the road network is dilapidated and large parts of the \ncountry are effectively isolated during the wet season. Most bridges are seriously damaged or \nfailed. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) considers that at least half of the \nprimary road network and nearly all the secondary and tertiary roads are in need of urgent \nrepair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction. Road condition surveys in 2002 confirm that 28% of the \nnetwork is in good or fair condition, 35% in poor condition, 28% in bad condition, and 6% under \nreconstruction or rehabilitation. \n \n2.  The unrehabilitated sections of the road network are characterized by cracks, ruts, \npotholes, edge failures, and pavement failures. The Government recognizes that the poor state \nof the country\u2019s road infrastructure poses a significant hindrance to economic development and \nemphasizes the urgency of reestablishing the country\u2019s transport infrastructure. The ongoing \nNational Road Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program aims to rehabilitate 1,400 km of \nnational roads by the year 2003, thus ensuring that approximately 44% of the national road \nnetwork will have been rehabilitated. The total cost of road rehabilitation between 1993 and \n2003  has  been  estimated  at  approximately  $550.0 million  equivalent,  of  which  ADB  has \nfinanced  approximately  $230.0 million  equivalent.  Currently,  total  annual  funding  for \nmaintenance and rehabilitation of the primary and secondary road network is estimated at \napproximately $79.0 million per year, of which the Government provides approximately 20% and \ninternational sources the remainder. However, bringing the primary and secondary road network \ninto a fully functional and maintainable state within the foreseeable future will require increased \nlevels of investment\u2014and maintenance funding\u2014over the next 15\u201320 years. \n \nB.  Road Traffic \n3.  In 2000, there were approximately 306,000 registered motor vehicles in the country, of \nwhich approximately 73% (226,200) were motorbikes; 23% (68,900) were cars, pickups, and \nother light vehicles; and 4% (10,900) were trucks, buses, and other heavy vehicles. Compared \nwith 1996, the fleet of motorcycles has grown by an average of 8% per year and the fleet of cars \nand other light vehicles by an average of 16%. \n \n4.  Given the growing network of trafficable roads, the increasing number of motor vehicles \nin the country, and the robust growth of Cambodia\u2019s economy, traffic have developed rapidly. \nRecent traffic counts near Siem Reap indicate average annual traffic growth rates of 16% for \n                                                 \n1  Drawn from the Final Draft Transport Sector Strategy (ADB TA 3651-CAM) and Mission estimates. \n ", "Appendix 3  25 \nmotorbikes, 40% for light vehicles, and 195% for heavy vehicles between 1998 and 2000, albeit \nbased on low initial traffic levels. Similar trends are noted elsewhere in the transport system. \nThe containerized trade through Sihanoukville Port grew by an average of 32% per annum \nbetween 1994 and 2000, while the number of airline passengers passing through Phnom Penh \nairport grew at a more moderate, but still impressive, annual rate of 9% between 1995 and \n2000. \n \n5.  A significant concern in Cambodia is the overloading of trucks, which leads to premature \ndeterioration of road pavements and threatens the stability of the many bridges designed for \nlight traffic. The legal axle load in Cambodia is 10 tons. There is evidence that some trucks, \nparticularly those carrying cement, take on as much as 60 tons over a truck-trailer combination. \nA survey carried out in 1997 identified an average axle weight of 10 tons with maximum axle \nweights of up to 16 tons. Enforcement of axle load limits in Cambodia is weak, and it is essential \nto formulate an effective axle load control program to lead to greatly extended pavement life and \nlower bridge-maintenance costs. This is particularly important for bridges, which constitute a \nvery large part of the network, as the passage of an exceptionally heavy vehicle could damage \nthe structure irreparably. \n \n6.  Subdecree 744, Maximum Load Limit of Transport Vehicles Using the Road Network in \nCambodia, was approved by the Government on 3 September 1999. The Subdecree details the \nload limits and sets penalties for overloading. Such penalties should reflect actual damage and \ndiscourage overloading. Pavement design is based on the fact that vehicle damage to a road \ndepends entirely on the axle load of those vehicles. The penalties listed in the Subdecree \nincrease  only  linearly  with  increasing  loads,  but  damage  to  the  road  in  reality  increases \nexponentially as the load increases. Small increases in axle load above the legal limit of 10 tons \ncan result in a severe increase in damage to the road pavement. As far as practicable, penalties \nshould reflect the exponential increase in damage. \n \n7.  Another issue is the rapid increase in road traffic accidents that has accompanied the \ngrowth in traffic in recent years, with the result that Cambodia today has a fatality rate (i.e., the \nnumber of traffic-related fatalities per year per 10,000 vehicles)2 of 12,3 compared with a fatality \nrate of 3 in 1996. The trends in fatality rates and fatality risks (i.e., traffic-related fatalities per \nyear per 10,000 persons) in Cambodia for the period 1994\u20132001 are shown in Figures A3.1 and \nA3.2. Motorcycles are frequently involved in traffic accidents, which is a concern due to their \nrole as public transport. The main causes of accidents in Cambodia are believed to be drunken \ndriving, lack of adherence by drivers to current regulations, and poor driving skills. The official \nfigures already indicate high fatality rates compared with other Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) member countries. In August 2001, the Economic and Social Commission for \nAsia and the Pacific set targets for fatality rates in all ASEAN member countries: (i) from 2001 of \nless than 10; (ii) from 2010, of less than 7; and (iii) from 2020, of less than 2. \n                                                 \n2  The fatality rate estimate excludes motorcycles, which are a major source of accidents and fatalities. \n3  The current traffic fatality rate is based on official statistics for 20 of the 24 provinces, including Phnom Penh. \nOfficial records before 2000 were kept only for Phnom Penh. \n ", "26  Appendix 3 \nFigure A3.1.

The situation is cause for great concern, given that current motorization levels are \nrelatively low but increasing at a rate of over 10% per annum. Furthermore, the economic costs \nof traffic accidents to Cambodia are estimated to be about 2\u20133% of gross domestic product, \nwhich excludes the social and humanitarian impact that loss of human life and/or debilitating \ninjuries can have on families\u2014particularly if a family income-earner is involved. A focused, \ncomprehensive, well-planned, and multidimensional road safety program is urgently needed to \naddress  the  problem  in  Cambodia.  An  indication  of  government  commitment  has  been \ndemonstrated by the issuance of a draft subdecree proposing to establish a National Road \nSafety Council with representation from several key ministries, including MPWT. It is essential \n ", "Appendix 3  27 \nthat this Council be formed as soon as possible, and provided with a secretariat to develop and \ngive  leadership  to  a  comprehensive  road  safety  program.  There  are  a  number  of  key \ncomponents that will be required for a comprehensive road safety program for Cambodia: (i) an \naccident data system; (ii) the National Road Safety Council, with the secretariat located in \nMPWT;  (iii) infrastructure  improvement;  (iv) legislation;  (v) traffic  police  enforcement; \n(vi) education and publicity; (vii) driver training and testing; (viii) vehicle testing and inspection; \nand (ix) emergency services. \n \nC.  Financial and Institutional Sustainability of the Road Sector \n1.  Road Maintenance Management and Financing \n9.  In 2000 and 2001, MPWT\u2019s expenditures on the primary and secondary road network \n(the national and provincial roads) averaged approximately $12.5 million per year, of which 20% \n($2.5 million) were recurrent expenditures for routine maintenance, and 80% ($10.0 million) \nwere capital expenditures for repair and rehabilitation of pavements. Annual average external \nagency funding added an estimated $60.0 million for road rehabilitation and improvement; the \nGovernment\u2019s  expenditures  for  counterpart  funding  of  externally  financed  projects  was \napproximately $6.0 million equivalent, making for total maintenance and rehabilitation funding of \n$79.0 million. No new funds are being expended on the construction of new roads. \n \n10.  The  management  of  a  road  network  must  be  based  on  business  principles,  using \neconomic  criteria  to  prioritize  and  schedule  maintenance  works.  An  asset  management \napproach is most appropriate as a long-term goal for maintaining and preserving the road \nnetwork.  In  Cambodia\u2019s  situation,  this  implies  a  move  from  the  present  crisis-response \nmanagement mode to a network management mode as the core network stabilizes and normal \nperiodic maintenance works can be scheduled in a cost-effective manner. Essential to that \napproach is the establishment of the maintenance management system with its basic building \nblocks that include a road and bridge inventory, a system for updating the inventory and \naccompanying condition surveys, and application of evaluation tools to prioritize and schedule \nperiodic maintenance. An ADB-financed study4 has developed a decentralized approach to road \ncondition monitoring, and the programming and management of routine maintenance that is \nsuitable  for  implementation  by  provincial  public  works  departments.  The  study  initiated \nimplementation  of  the  maintenance  management  system  in  three  pilot  provinces,  with  the \nsystem now being adopted by MPWT for replication in the remaining provinces of Cambodia. \nThe system is based on a relatively straightforward road condition assessment procedure that \ninvolves  (i) vehicle  operating  speeds  and  travel  time,  (ii) drainage  considerations,  and \n(iii) engineering judgment. \n \n11.  To ensure an effective and sustainable planning and programming process, it is clearly \nessential to ensure security of funding and reliable cash flow with the attendant technical and \nfinancial  audit  instruments.  MPWT  has  two  sources  of  funding  for  maintenance  and \ndevelopment of the road network: general funds from the annual budget, and special funds \naccumulated  in  the  Fund  for  Repair  and  Maintenance  of  Roads  (FRMR).5  General  funds \nallocated  in  the  annual  budget  in  effect  cover  only  periodic  maintenance  and  pavement \nrehabilitation. The investment budget is retained by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) \nand  disbursed  on  a  project  basis.  When  the  FRMR  was  established  in  2000,  it  required \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1999.

Manila. \n5  Interministerial Prakas 399, 28 June 2000. \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \nprofitable companies owned by MPWT to loan a share of their net profits to support the FRMR. \nThe primary contributor to the FRMR over the years has been Sihanoukville Port. Since January \n2002, the income of the FRMR has been supplemented by the proceeds from a surcharge on \nfuel amounting to $0.02 per liter on petrol, and $0.04 per liter on diesel. By the end of May 2002, \nthe  accumulated  amount  from  fuel  taxes  was  estimated  at  $3.5 million.  In  May  2002,  the \nmanagement of the FRMR was transferred to MEF, under the direct management of the Prime \nMinister.6  \n \n12.  The  current  level  of  maintenance  spending,  inclusive  of  capital  expenditures  for \nrecurrent maintenance and rehabilitation, amounts to approximately 15% of total requirements \nand is clearly insufficient to meet the needs of the sector. The shortfall is partly explained by the \ndilapidated state of most of the road network after more than 20 years of neglect, which \ntranslates into high maintenance requirements, combined with the Government\u2019s limited funding \ncapacity. The funding situation is aggravated by a small vehicle fleet and relatively light traffic, \nwhich limits the scope for collection of higher vehicle and fuel taxes. These constraints will \ndiminish  over  time,  in  step  with  the  ongoing  rehabilitation  of  the  road  network,  which  will \ndecrease road maintenance requirements, and the growth of the economy, which will increase \nthe tax base. It has been estimated that road maintenance requirements will fall by nearly two \nthirds over the coming 15\u201320 years while the potential for taxation of vehicles in the same \nperiod  will  increase  fivefold,  leading  to  potential  full  funding  of  all  road  maintenance \nrequirements from vehicle and fuel taxation by 2011. \n \n13.  Institutional constraints also contribute to the low level of road maintenance funding. \nMPWT needs to strengthen capacity and develop an effective organizational structure to carry \nout credible and efficient maintenance planning and implementation. MEF should then be able \nto  respond  more  efficiently  in  approving,  disbursing,  and  monitoring  funds  for  defined \nmaintenance programs. Disbursement of the approved road maintenance budget has been low \nand approved budget allocations have been falling. This development needs urgently to be \nreversed before substantial damage is inflicted upon the rehabilitated parts of the road network. \n \n2.  Sustainable Organizational Structure for MPWT \n14.  The current MPWT was created by Royal Decree in January 1996 and was vested with \nthe responsibility to \u201cadminister and regulate the public works and transport sectors of the \nKingdom of Cambodia.\u201d MPWT\u2019s capabilities in addressing issues and needs in the transport \nsector require improvement through reorganization and institutional strengthening, particularly \nwith respect to: (i) defining more fully MPWT\u2019s functions, responsibilities, and job descriptions, \nand (ii) setting in place the management processes necessary for the development of policies \nand plans and the guidance and control necessary to verify that developments and operations \nconform  to  those  policies  and  plans.  Although  MPWT  has  the  overall  mandate  for  the \nmanagement  and  development  of  the  transport  sector,  the  current  legal  and  regulatory \nframework within which it seeks to fulfill this mandate needs strengthening as some of the key \nacts that would legally formalize MPWT\u2019s mandate to manage the transport sector are not yet in \nplace.7  \n \n                                                 \n6  Subdecree No. 39, 6 May 2002. \n7  The Road Act, drafted, but requiring review and revisions for adoption; a Rail Act, clarifying the integration of the \nrail transport system and specifying standards for reporting, legal authority, technical specifications, and safety; a \nCivil Aviation Law, drafted but not enacted\u2014however, regulations for flight safety, airworthiness, etc. have not yet \nbeen officially promulgated. \n ", "Appendix 3  29 \n15.  The primary tasks of MPWT are to prepare strategic plans and to implement the plans \nfor the development of the transport sector in the country, including civil aviation. However, \nMPWT is constrained in its efforts to fulfill these tasks by the lack of a national transport policy \nframework that clearly defines objectives and organizational responsibilities. This clearly limits \nMPWT's ability to undertake strategic planning, implement projects effectively, or develop sector \npolicies. The current organization of MPWT that was developed in response to the challenges \nfaced  during  the  early  1990s  makes  no  clear  distinctions  between  the  different  functional \nstreams in the organization.  \n \n16.  The Government took the initiative to adopt an overall reform program by launching its \nAdministrative Reform Program in 1998. As part of this program, the Government is committed \nto reviewing the proposed reorganization and institutional-strengthening requirements of MPWT \nin order to take into account new challenges in public administration. A reform of MPWT should \nrecognize MPWT\u2019s core functions in planning, infrastructure management, and transport sector \nregulation, emphasizing private sector participation in appropriate activities. \n \n \n \n ", "30   Appendix 4 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \nA.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n1.  As part of project preparation, a detailed social impact survey was conducted in May\u2013\nJune 2002 along the proposed road alignments of NR5 and NR6, and NR56 and NR68. A full \ncensus and inventory of lost assets was carried out for all households potentially affected by \nloss  of  land  and  structures  within  the  proposed  corridor  of  impact  (COI).  Based  on  the \ninformation collected, a full resettlement plan has been prepared for the Project in compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and the Handbook on Resettlement: A \nGuide to Good Practice.  \n \n2.  The Project will require acquisition of approximately 60 hectares (ha) of land along NR5 \nand NR6, affecting approximately 2,000 farmers, 240 houses and house-shops, and 300 small \nroadside stalls, which will need to be moved out of the COI.1 The houses and house-shops are \nmade either of timber with metal roofing sheets, or concrete, or more temporary materials such \nas bamboo. Many of the shops are built in front of the family residence, which will not be \naffected by the Project. Irrigation canals will also be disrupted and there will be temporary loss \nof land during construction. In addition, 572 private fruit trees and 2,025 public and private \nshade trees will be affected within the COI. \n3.  Improvements to NR56 and NR68, north of NR6, will only involve replacement of the \nbridges,  causing  minimal  or  no  land  acquisition  impacts.  Any  unforeseen  land  acquisition \nimpacts would be addressed under the approved resettlement plan for the Project. \n4.  The exact alignment will be determined during detailed design. It is anticipated that there \ncould  be  a  significant  reduction  in  the  numbers  of  permanently  affected  households  after \ndetailed design as only then will it be possible to identify which land will be required permanently \nand which will be affected only temporarily during construction. After detailed design and the \ndetailed measurement survey of affected losses, the numbers and budget in the resettlement \nplan will be updated if required. This will provide a final headcount of affected persons, and final \nmeasurement of losses in terms of numbers of assets lost, broken down by category of loss and \ncategory of entitled person, and by applicable rates per category. New categories of loss not \ncurrently included in the resettlement plan requiring new entitlements would also be provided \nwhere necessary. The revised resettlement plan, which should be in compliance with the agreed \nresettlement  plan,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement,  and  the  Handbook  on \nResettlement should be submitted to ADB for review and approval before implementation of the \nrevised resettlement plan. \n \nB.  Socioeconomic Background \n5.  A socioeconomic survey was conducted in 20% of potentially affected households. The \nanalysis of the survey results has been included in the resettlement plan and will guide further \nresettlement planning. \n \nC.  Objectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n6.  The policy framework and entitlements for the Project have built upon the laws of the \nGovernment of Cambodia, principally the new Land Law (issued 30 August 2001), ADB\u2019s Policy \n                                                 \n1  The COI for purposes of land acquisition and the inventory of losses for NR5 and NR6 is defined as 20 meters \neither side of the right-of-way in rural areas and 6.5 meters either side of the right-of-way in built-up areas. \n ", "  Appendix 4  31 \non Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice, \nand government-approved resettlement plans for other ADB2 projects. Provisions and principles \nadopted in the resettlement plan for the Project supersede the provisions of relevant decrees \nand laws currently in force in Cambodia wherever a gap exists. \n7.  The common objective of these policies is to ensure that people displaced by the Project \nshould generally be at least as well of as, if not better off than, they would have been without the \nProject. The resettlement plan has been prepared with this as a guiding principle. The absence \nof formal title or lack of land certificates will not prevent payment of compensation to affected \npersons/households. Government agreement has been obtained on the guiding principles and \napproach to be adopted for land acquisition, compensation and resettlement, presented in \nsummary form in Table A4.1, and on the entitlements presented in Table A4.2. \n8.  The primary objective of the resettlement plan is to provide guidelines for compensation \npayments for lost assets and resettlement of the project-affected persons and businesses. The \nresettlement  plan  identifies  (i) the  extent  of  losses,  (ii) the  policy  and  legal  framework  for \ncompensation payments and relocation, (iii) the institutional framework for participation and \nimplementation, (iv) provision for employment and poverty reduction, and (v) responsibilities for \nmonitoring  the  implementation  measures.  It  is  expected  that  the  impact  on  the  affected \nhouseholds will be limited due to strip acquisition. The resettlement operations in the Project will \nbe carried out in consultation with the affected persons, including vulnerable groups, and all \nefforts will be made to minimize disruption during project implementation. \n \nD.  Entitlement Policy \n9.  In  accordance  with  ADB  policy,  people  eligible  for  compensation  will  be  those \nexperiencing negative impacts on their assets and livelihoods as a result of the Project.

Affected  persons  will  be  entitled  to  compensation  and  rehabilitation  measures  as \nsummarized in Table A4.2. The affected households will receive replacement land or cash for \nland, and compensation in cash or kind for immovable assets at replacement cost of labor and \nmaterials sufficient to restore to preproject size and standards or better. Also, a number of \nbenefits, including compensation for loss of business, loss of income/workdays, and shifting \ncosts have been designed so that affected persons can at least retain their level of living in the \npostproject period. In addition, a number of income-generating opportunities have been adopted \nto improve the socioeconomic conditions and quality of life of the affected persons. The cut-off \ndate for determining the eligibility for entitlements by the affected persons has been established \nby  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT)  as  the  date  of  the  end  of  the \nsocioeconomic survey, 30 June 2002, with any legitimate omissions being identified during the \nsubsequent  detailed  measurement  survey.  The  resettlement  plan  includes  provisions  for \nassistance  in  dismantling,  transporting,  and  reconstructing  structures,  and  relocation  site \npreparation. This assistance will be provided at no cost to the affected persons. \n \nE.  Consultation, Participation, and Disclosure \n11.  As a result of the household surveys and meetings with affected households, the people \nin the project road sections are fully aware and generally supportive of the Project. MPWT \nofficials will carry out an information campaign and, beginning in October 2002 for the duration \nof the resettlement process, will publish brochures in Khmer on the project compensation policy, \ncompensation payment procedures, and construction schedule aimed at social preparation for \nrelocation and resettlement of the affected persons. MPWT will be responsible for distribution of \nthe brochures as well as monthly newsletters to affected communities for the duration of the \nresettlement  process.  During  the  detailed  measurement  survey,  each  household  will  be \npersonally informed about the project, entitlements and procedures. \n \nF.  Grievance Procedures  \n12.  To ensure that affected persons have avenues for grievances related to any aspect of \nland acquisition and resettlement, detailed procedures for redressing grievances have been \nestablished for the Project and detailed in the resettlement plan. \n ", "  Appendix 4  33 \nTable A4.1: Resettlement Principles and Approach Applicable to the Project \n  Principle  Approach \n1.

Income Restoration  \n13.  Two groups of affected persons will experience loss of income due to the Project. \nFarmers will lose some or all of their productive land for which they will be compensated and \nassisted to obtain replacement land. They will receive assistance to help them during the \ntransition period until their new land is established. Small shop-owners will have to move out of \nthe COI, but income loss will be very temporary only while the shops are dismantled and rebuilt \n ", "34   Appendix 4 \nbehind the COI. The Project will assist the affected shop-owners to either move back behind the \nCOI or onto a side or access road with comparable accessibility. The Project will build shop \nsites wherever necessary. These same shop-owners will also experience some disturbance \nduring the construction period, for which they will receive a disturbance allowance. \nH.  Employment in Civil Works  \n14.  The project construction activities will require many unskilled laborers for earthworks and \nroad embankments as well as for road, bridge, and culvert works for a period of 3 years. MPWT \nwill include provisions in the civil works contracts for preferential employment of project-affected \npersons, including women, in the recruitment of local laborers. The contractors will be required \nnot to discriminate against the employment of women in the road construction labor force. \nEmployment in project construction will be an added source of income in the income restoration \nprocess of the affected households. The social and environment division of the repositioned \nDepartment of Planning in MPWT and the construction supervision consultant will monitor and \nensure contractor compliance. \n \nI.  Institutional Framework \n15.  MPWT is the Executing Agency for the Project. A project management unit will be set up \nto  be  responsible  for  the  land  acquisition,  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation \nprogram for the Project. MPWT will see that institutional arrangements are in place to ensure \neffective and timely consultation, design, planning, implementation, and monitoring of the land \nacquisition,  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  program.  The  social  and \nenvironment division will be responsible for social (including resettlement) and environmental \nissues across all sectors under MPWT\u2019s authority. \n \nJ.  Budget Issues \n16.  The total cost for land acquisition and resettlement for the project roads is currently \nbudgeted at $1.2 million.4 The total amount, although included in the project costs, is to be \nfinanced entirely by the Government from its counterpart funds. \n \nK.  Implementation Schedule \n17.  A detailed implementation schedule for the land acquisition and resettlement program \nhas been agreed upon by the Government and ADB and incorporated in the resettlement plan. \nAll compensation and resettlement activities will be completed satisfactorily prior to the start of \ncivil works. \n \nL.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n18.  The PMU will be responsible for internal monitoring of resettlement plan implementation. \nThe  PMU  will  engage  a  capable  independent  monitoring  agency  before  implementing  the \napproved  resettlement  plan.  The  independent  monitoring  agency  will  follow  a  knowledge, \nattitude, response, and experience (KARE) methodology, which will include a baseline survey \nand follow-up surveys until all resettlement plan activities are completed, to be followed by a \npost-resettlement evaluation. \n                                                 \n4  This cost estimate will be adjusted as necessary after the detailed measurement survey and replacement cost \nstudy. \n ", "  Appendix 4  35 \n \nTable A4.2: Entitlement Matrix Summary \n \nType of Loss  Application  Entitled Person  Compensation \nLoss of arable,  Permanent  Eligible landholder with  (i) As a priority, title to land for land of equal area \nforest,  formal legal title OR  and productivity, or cash compensation for lost land \nresidential, or    at replacement cost at current market value. \ncommercial land     Replacement land to be free from administrative, \n  registration, and transfer costs. \n   \nPossessory land holder  (ii) No distinction between titled and nontitled \neligible for formal title OR  landholders.  \n   \nPossessory landholder not  (iii) Severely affected farmers will be eligible for \neligible for formal legal  economic rehabilitation assistance and other \ntitle under Cambodian law  allowances (disruption allowance, assistance to \nbut occupying such land  obtain training and employment). \nbefore 30 August 2001.  \nThose who do not satisfy  Entitled to provision of adequate assistance so that \nthe above conditions but  they are able to improve, or at least restore, their \ncan provide evidence of  incomes and living standards to the preproject \nuse/occupancy as of the  levels.

The Project includes improvements of national highways NR5 and NR6, and provincial \nhighways NR56 and NR68, in northwest Cambodia: \n \n(i)  NR5: Sisophon-Poipet (48.5 km) and NR6: Siem Reap to Sisophon (102.0 km), \ninvolving clearance of unexploded ordnance (UXO) within the corridor of impact; \nconstruction  of  embankment,  pavement,  replacement  bridges  and  culverts, \ndrainage improvements, weigh stations, and cross-border facilities; and dealing \nwith road safety and environmental considerations; and \n \n(ii)  NR56:  Sisophon  to  Samrong  (114.0 km)  and  NR68:  Kralanh  to  Samrong \n(79.0 km), involving UXO clearance within the corridor of impact at bridge and \nweigh stations sites; and construction of replacement bridges and weigh stations. \n \nA.  NR5 and NR6 \n \n2.  The improvements are to be designed generally in accordance with: \n \n(i)  Highway Capacity Manual, United States Transportation Research Board (2000) \nfor the analysis of roadway capacity; \n \n(ii)  American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO): \nGuide for Design of Pavement Structures (1993) for the design of pavements; \n \n(iii)  AASHTO: Bridge Design Specification (2001 SI edition); and \n \n(iv)  Reference  to  the  Cambodian  Roads  Standards  and  other  standards  where \nsuited. \n \n3.  The major improvements to the roads involve: \n \n(i)  raising the embankment on low lying areas to be flood free for the 20-year design \nflood; \n \n(ii)  improving horizontal and vertical alignments to provide sight distance required for \ndesign speed of 60 km/h, particularly on horizontal and vertical curves at bridge \napproaches; \n \n(iii)  widening the existing carriageways to 7.0 meters (m), and providing at least \n2.0 m wide paved shoulder on both sides in built-up areas and 1.5 m wide paved \nshoulders on both sides in rural areas, with 0.5 m wide unpaved extension; \n \n(iv)  paving the carriageways with asphalt concrete (AC); \n \n(v)  providing drainage and erosion protection works based on hydraulic designs, and \nroadside drainage in built-up areas; \n \n(vi)  improving traffic safety, particularly in the built-up areas by separating through \ntraffic from local traffic including bicycles and pedestrians; \n \n ", "50  Appendix 12 \n(vii)  providing  road  furniture  including  traffic  signs,  pedestrian  crossings,  and \npavement marking; \n \n(viii)  constructing cross-border facilities in Poipet to meet the requirements of the \nGMS Cross-Border Agreement; \n \n(ix)  installing weigh stations in Poipet, Samrong, and Siem Reap; and  \n \n(x)  carrying out environmental mitigation works pursuant to the initial environmental \nexamination. \n \n4.  The highway finished level will be determined on the basis of records of the 2000 flood \nso that the project roads can serve all-weather transport all year. Slope protection is to be \nprovided for widened or new embankments, for instance by planting sprigs combined with \nmulching and bitumen spraying. \n \n5.  The horizontal alignment is to be improved to allow a design speed of 60 km/h. The \nexisting alignment will be followed in most part to minimize land acquisition and resettlement. \nWhere there is incompatibility between any curve and the speed environment of the road in the \nvicinity of the curve, warning signs are to be provided on the approaches to the curve. \n \n6.  Carriageways will have two lanes and 7.0 m width. At least 2.0 m wide paved shoulder \nwith 0.5 m wide unpaved extension will be provided on both sides in the built-up areas. In the \nrural areas, 1.5 m wide paved shoulders with 0.5 m wide unpaved extension will be provided on \nboth sides. \n \n7.  NR5 and NR6 are currently estimated to carry 2.8 million to 5.8 million cumulative \nequivalent axles for 10 years. Under AASHTO standards applied to the Project, AC pavement \nwill be adopted given the estimated traffic volumes. The AC pavement designs using a 10-year \ndesign period are to be made based on investigation and testing of existing pavements and \nexpected embankment materials.  \n \n8.  All the bridge and most culvert structures existing on the project roads will be replaced \nwith new structures. Under the actual overloading circumstances, HS20-44 load capacity plus \n25% additional overload capacity is used for the design load. The structures will have a 7.0 m \nwide carriageway, 1.5 m wide shoulders and side barriers on both sides in rural areas, with \nconsideration of at least 2.0 m wide shoulders to be used in built-up areas. Use of steel side \nbarriers is recommended to improve safety conditions for the road users. Use of integral bridge \nabutments without expansion joints and pipe culverts with a large diameter is recommended to \nreduce potential maintenance issues. \n \n9.  During implementation of the civil works, temporary access at most of the bridge sites \ncan be achieved with a dry off-road bypass. Larger structures with occasional flows will require \neither a temporary bridge or use of a raised road formation with a large culvert. For the largest \nstructures that are more than 80 m long, the new bridge will be relocated to allow for continued \nuse of the existing bridge during the construction period. Construction methods will focus on the \nuse of precast elements and prestressing of beams to ensure quality, decrease costs, allow for \nwork in the rainy season, and minimize onsite construction time. \n \n10.  Drainage will be provided for the built-up areas along the project road where there is a \nhistory of flooding. For design of drainage structures, the water levels and flood flows must be \n ", "  Appendix 12  51 \ndetermined via modeling of the catchment using rainfall and flow data presently available from \nthe Ministry of Water Resources and the Mekong River Commission. All the existing waterway \nstructures will be replaced with new drainage structures with the flow capacity required for the \n20-year flood event as a minimum. Additional waterway structures may be needed to provide for \nthe removal of floodways. \n \n11.  Based on the outcome of the hydraulic modeling, the removal of floodways is likely to \nrequire the construction of additional structures to mitigate any adverse effects caused by the \nProject. These structures will be placed at optimal positions along the Project road so as to \nmaximize flow capacity across the entire project length. \n \n12.  Irrigation control structures, where they are required to be reinstated, will be separated \nfrom the new bridge structure and placed at a safe distance upstream from the bridges so as \nnot to restrict flood flows. \n \n13.  Safety considerations are to be incorporated in the designs, particularly in the built-up \nareas of Pouk, Kralanh, Sisophon, and Poipet. To reduce the speed of traffic effectively, traffic \nsigns, pedestrian crossings, and other safety improvement means are to be provided.  \n \n14.  Cross-border facilities are to be constructed in Poipet. The arrangements will provide \nfor single stop, single-window facilities for vehicles. To avoid overloading traffic, weigh stations \nare to be constructed on NR5 in Poipet and on NR6 in Siem Reap. \n \n15.  The above designs will be made so that environmental impact may be minimized. \nWhere any adverse environmental impact is foreseen, adequate mitigation measures are to be \nincorporated in the design and implementation of civil works, pursuant to the summary initial \nenvironmental examination. \n \nB.  NR56 and NR68 \n \n16.  All existing bridge structures will be replaced by two-lane bridges or culverts of 10 m \nwidth using the HS20-44 capacity plus 25% additional overload capacity in accordance with \nAASHTO: Bridge Design Specification (2001 SI edition). \n \n17.  To avoid entry of overloaded trucks into Cambodia, weigh stations are to be constructed \nin the vicinity of the intersection of NR56, NR68, and the road heading to the Thai border. \n \n ", "52  Appendix 13 \nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE: \nCONSULTING SERVICES FOR CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISION \n \nA.

The civil works on NR5 and NR6 involves de-mining and unexploded ordnance (UXO) \nclearance within the corridor of impact, embankment and asphalt concrete pavement works, \nreplacement of bridges and culverts, drainage improvement, construction of weigh stations and \ncross-border facilities, and road safety and environmental considerations. The civil works on \nNR56 and NR68 involve de-mining and UXO clearance within the corridor of impact at bridge \nand weighbridge sites, bridge replacement, and weigh stations.  \n \n4.  The civil works will be executed through four contract packages, ranging in value from \n$7.5 million  to  $18.5 million.  Table  A13.1  shows  details  of  the  contract  packages.  All  four \npackages will be procured using international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. The civil \nworks will be executed under ADB\u2019s sample bidding documents (Procurement of Civil Works, \n1997),  which  are  based  on  F\u00e9d\u00e9ration  Internationale  des  Ing\u00e9nieurs-Conseils  (FIDIC) \nConditions  of  Contract,  fourth  edition.  The  detailed  design  and  drawings  developed  under \ntechnical assistance (TA) 3868-CAM will be used for the bidding documents.

The Consultant \n7.  The  consulting  services  will  be  provided  by  a  consulting  firm,  joint  venture,  or \nconsortium of consulting firms, to be appointed by MPWT in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. The consultant will provide the staffing, as indicated in para. 18, \nalthough in preparing the proposals, the consultant may propose alternative arrangements that, \nin their opinion, will provide services of an equivalent quality. The final staffing will be adjusted \nto suit the actual procurement and implementation schedules. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n8.  Under the overall guidance of the director general of General Department of Public \nWorks, the consultant will work directly with the project management unit, headed by the project \nmanager,  established  in  MPWT  for  the  Project  to  administer  construction  contracts.  The \nconsulting services are expected to continue through almost the entire period of the project, and \nthe level of inputs will depend on the annual work programs. \n \n9.  The consultant will establish a main office in Phnom Penh headed by the team leader; \nand two site offices in selected districts (to be determined during implementation) to provide \nadequate coverage of the project roads. The main office will be responsible for highway design, \nbenefit monitoring and evaluation, and overall assistance in coordination with MPWT. The site \noffices will administer the civil works in accordance with the contracts.  \n \nE.  Scope of Work \n \n10.  The civil works will be executed under FIDIC Conditions of Contract, as outlined in the \nbid documents. Accordingly, MPWT will be the employer and the consultant will function as the \nengineer for all road improvement contracts under the Project. The consultant will appoint a \nteam leader to act as the engineer\u2019s representative for the contracts. \n \n11.  As the engineer\u2019s representative, the consultant\u2019s team leader will implement the civil \nwork contracts and ensure that the works are constructed in accordance with its provisions. The \n ", "54  Appendix 13 \nconsultant will have all the powers defined in the FIDIC Conditions of Contract as being the \nengineer, except the following, which will be retained and exercised by the employer, generally \non the advice of the engineer: \n \n(i)  issuing the order to commence the works; \n(ii)  approving variation orders that have financial implications; \n(iii)  approving significant variations in quantities; \n(iv)  approving subletting of any part of the works; and \n(v)  approving extensions of time. \n \n12.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national  Sector identified as a national priority in country poverty \npriority in country poverty analysis?  partnership agreement? \nYes  Yes \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \n \nThe key contribution of the infrastructure sector is to strengthen linkages between rural and urban areas and between \ndifferent regions of the country to promote economic growth and development activities that are geographically \nbalanced.  \n \nThe majority of the poor in Cambodia live in rural areas and base their livelihoods on agricultural activities. Many of \nthe poor face food shortages for several months and are vulnerable to external shocks due to reliance on subsistence \nagriculture and deprived access to social services. Improved infrastructure will lead to increased openness for \ncommunities  deprived  of  adequate  access  to  information  and  markets.  This  will  increase  access  to  off-farm \nemployment and diversification of risk and vulnerability. Access to markets will reduce vulnerability to food shortages \nand reliance on subsistence agriculture. Enhanced access will also enable the Government and external financing \nagencies to provide social services to deprived areas. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \nSocioeconomic and Poverty Profile in the Project Area: \n \nThe area under the proposed Project includes the provinces of Siem Reap, Banteay Meanchey and Oddar Meanchey \nin Northwestern Cambodia. This area suffers from high incidence of poverty and has received minimal development \nassistance in the past because of war and insecurity. Owing to the security situation at the time of the implementation \nof the socioeconomic surveys, reliable poverty statistics on a comparative basis with the rest of the country are \nunavailable and the statistics presented are only indicative. Although some data indicating vulnerability exist for Siem \nReap and Banteay Meanchey, the data for Oddar Meanchey are either merged with Siem Reap or do not exist. Given \nthe more developed areas around Siem Reap, the data do not serve to adequately reflect the poverty and \nvulnerability that prevails in Oddar Meanchey. The lack of data in this province is in itself an indication of lack of \naccess to Government, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and aid agencies. Due to high labor mobility, the data \nfor Banteay Meanchey can be regarded as outdated, and vulnerability is likely to be underestimated for that reason. A \ndetailed survey was fielded to further investigate poverty and vulnerability and likely impacts of increased access, \nthrough a socioeconomic survey and participatory focus group discussions. Based on survey data on poverty and \nvulnerability, the proposed classification of the Project is poverty intervention.  \n \nSurvey data suggest that poverty is widespread in the area with severe problems of accessibility during the rainy \nseason. The WFP study indicates that no less than 60% of households suffer from food deficiency although there is \nsome  scope  here  for  foraging,  hunting,  and  gathering  activities  to  supplement  precarious  livelihoods.  Most \nhouseholds find their food stocks depleted within 4 months of harvest. The overall poverty estimates for the project \narea is about 40%. However, there are significant variations, with the areas serviced by better roads displaying the \nlowest poverty level (25%), while NR56 and areas serviced by poor roads have very high poverty levels (over 60%). \nThus, quite apart from relatively high poverty levels in the project area compared with the national situation, there are \ndeep  pockets  of  extensive  poverty,  much  of  which  is  related  to  the  relative  physical  remoteness  and  poor \ninfrastructure in the area. Government services, such as health and education, rarely reach the interior and tend to be \nrestricted to peri-urban areas. Insecurity and lack of access have reduced the effectiveness and outreach of NGO \nactivities. \n \nThe vulnerability of the population in this area, and especially that of the poor, is marked by a number of factors. \nThese include adverse demographic and socioeconomic conditions that include a high dependency ratio, illiteracy, \npoor access to drinking water and health facilities, and low school enrolment and attendance in comparison with the \noverall, national situation. Adult literacy is estimated at 46% compared with a national average of over 67%. The \npopulation with access to safe drinking water and sanitary latrines is estimated at less than 7% and 4%, respectively, \ncompared with a national average of 29% and 15%, and school attendance (5\u201314 age group) is below 60% \ncompared with 66% for the whole country. This is indicative of high opportunity costs of children to attend school and \nthe need to engage children in livelihood activities. \n \nAccess to credit is severely limited and savings are small, leading to frequent asset-liquidation to meet crises (most \nfrequently caused by health shocks). Family spacing is nonexistent and whatever reproductive services exist are \nlargely inaccessible due to the widely dispersed nature of the population and long travel distances/time needed to \n ", "  Appendix 14  57 \nreach these (especially in Oddar Meanchey).  \n \nThe national data related to women-headed households suggest a lower poverty incidence compared with similar \nmale-headed households. This may not be true for the project area where at least one report points to the serious \ndisadvantages faced by the former especially when able-bodied male labor is not available. Similarly the incidence of \ndisabled persons is high in the area (2.2 per 1000 compared with the national average of 1.5). This is a reflection of \nprolonged civil strife and the presence of unexploded ordnance (UXO) in the area. Further, more recently settled \nvillages tend to be poorer as these are yet to establish more secure livelihood systems.  \n \nIndigenous ethnic minorities are not found in the immediate project area as war and insecurity led them to move \nnortheast. A few remote villages, beyond the direct influence area, have ethnic minority groups such as the Pnong \nengaged in rice farming and the Cham, found around Tonle Sap, engaged in fishing. They are not considered to be \ndisadvantaged in comparison to ethnic Khmers.  \n \nLivelihood security is a chief concern of the poorest 40%. They are primarily subsistence farmers growing one (rain-\nfed) crop a year, often of low quality or yields (which are significantly lower than those in similar agro-ecological \nareas). Irrigation is scarce and unreliable.  \n \nMigration \n \nDue to its proximity to Thailand, the area is prone to labor mobility, both inward and outward. A large number of \npeople migrate to the towns and to Thailand in search of work, usually illegally. They migrate for mainly economic \nreasons, in response to wage differentials between Thailand and Cambodia, food shortages and underemployment. \nMost of the migrants are poor or very poor with inadequate landholdings. Short-term migration takes place in \nresponse to underemployment during off-peak agricultural seasons and serves as a coping mechanism for food \ninsecurity. The majority are women who work just across the border. Long-term migrants, the majority of whom are \nmen, belong to households with sufficient assets to finance their trips. They travel deep into Thailand and engage in \nunskilled employment activities such as construction work, manufacturing and food processing activities. While \nmigration is risky and can cause problems for those left behind, many report positive outcomes and migration is \njudged to be good for the development of skills.  \n \nMigration to the area has occurred in response to internal displacement, prevailing poverty and landlessness in other \nareas, and the search for hope of better opportunities. This is evident in the area around Poipet, which has seen a \nrapid increase in the size of its population, from 30,000 in 2000 to over 100,000 in 2002. The town has grown largely \nin response to the casinos established on the Cambodian side. This has led to a rapid increase in urban poverty. A \nsimilar trend is emerging in the border town of O\u2019smach in Oddar Meanchey. Newly settled households tend to be \nmore vulnerable, lack social cohesion, and are more likely to live in poverty than older and more established settlers. \n \nHIV/STI \nThe Cambodian Demographic Health Survey, 2000 reveals that Banteay Meanchey is one of the provinces with the \nlowest level of awareness of AIDS, with 79% of respondents aware of HIV/AIDS compared with the national average \nof 95% awareness. A 2000 HIV surveillance testing in Banteay Meanchey found the following rates of HIV positive \npeople in the groups tested: 7.3% of police, 37.3% of direct commercial sex workers, 13.3% of indirect sex workers, \nand 4% of pregnant women attending antenatal clinics. While this is a decrease from previous years, it is still very \nhigh. The merged data for Siem Reap/Oddar Meanchey show that awareness is in line with the national average. But \nfor Oddar Meanchey this is likely to be a significant overestimation. All three provinces rank low in terms of women\u2019s \nknowledge of HIV/STD prevention. \n \nExpected Impacts on Poverty and Vulnerability  \nThe impacts on the poor in the project area would largely depend on how national roads 6 and 5 are linked to the \nlocal road network. To maximize the impacts, the proposed Project includes road improvements and all-weather \naccessibility along national roads 68 and 56, which form a loop in Oddar Meanchey. The loop will feed directly into \nthe ADB-financed Northwestern Rural Development Project1 (NRDP) and enhance the joint poverty impacts of both \nnational roads 6 and 5 under the proposed Project and the impacts identified under NRDP. Thus, the proposed \nProject intends to provide an integrated approach linking feeder roads (under NRDP) with provincial roads and the \nnational roads. This would increase the poverty reduction impacts of both the NRDP and the proposed developments \non national roads 6 and 5. \n                                                 \n1  Approved 6 November 2001. \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \n \nRecent studies of the impact of feeder roads show that the competitiveness of transport facilities is an important \nfactor for the impacts on poverty reduction. This would show the impacts of savings in vehicle operating costs on the \npoor. Within a competitive environment reduced costs would be transferred to the consumers of transport facilities. \nTransport services in Cambodia tend to be highly competitive and therefore the main beneficiaries would be the users \nof such facilities.  \n \nKey impacts include higher producer prices and a wider span of marketing options for agricultural produce and \nincreased opportunity for trade to reduce food shortages. Access to national roads 6 and 5, a main trade route with \ngrowing markets, will further increase farmers\u2019 abilities to reach a variety of markets. All-weather access along the \nloop and into the target villages of NRDP will reduce the costs of accessing social services like health care and \neducation. The ability of outreach into Oddar Meanchey and effectiveness of government and other agencies in \nproviding services will significantly improve as both feeder roads and main roads are improved. Only a few NGOs, \nWFP, and de-mining companies are active in the area around the loop. They are mainly engaged in emergency relief \nand food for work programs. Most of their project beneficiaries are disabled, war widows, or displaced people \nbelonging to the poor or very poor. Increased access to these areas will facilitate a more effective outreach for \norganizations engaged in direct poverty reduction efforts. \n \nThe most immediate impact of the proposed Project includes employment opportunities during road construction. \nRoad construction work tends to be self-targeting of the poor. Although this impact is deemed as short run, the design \nof local maintenance contracts under the Project will act to promote longer-term wage and employment impacts. \nTogether with increased access to a wider range of employment activities labor-intensive road construction and local \nmaintenance contracts provide off-farm employment opportunities that are key to poverty reduction. This is especially \nimportant for the landless and for those with inadequate land resources. International Labour Organization (ILO) \nstudies show that nearly 47% of road workers are women. Local employment opportunities will reduce the need for \nmigration to Thailand, and thus reduce vulnerability for those left behind. Thus, by incorporating local labor contracts \nin the design, the Project will act to reduce the rate of increase in labor migration. \n \nSocial Risks \n \nOne of the major objectives of the proposed Project is to enhance economic integration, increase mobility and intra- \nand cross-border trade. While labor mobility is already high, mobility can be expected to increase both to and from \nthis area. Given the rather high incidence of HIV/AIDS in Banteay Meanchey and low awareness together with an \nexpected increase of truck-drivers going through the area, there is a risk of further spread of HIV/AIDS to and from \nthe project area. In order to reduce this risk, a participatory approach to raising HIV/AIDS awareness will be followed. \nThis  will  be  based  on  best  practices  developed  under  TA  5881-REG:  Preventing  HIV/AIDS  Among  Mobile \nPopulations in the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n \nLabor-Based Appropriate Technologies \n \nThere are a number of poverty-oriented gaps in the current road program. First, there is a need to connect the \nprimary and the rural roads with secondary roads. Second, there is a need to develop more opportunities for and \ncapacity of domestic private contractors who are capable and equipped to take on construction and maintenance \nwork on the national and provincial roads. Third, more research needs to be done on road technologies best suited to \nCambodia in terms of directly and indirectly achieving poverty reduction goals, including compilation and review of \nexperiences from other countries. Finally, there is a need for greater capacity for the training of engineers, public \nsector officials, and private sector contractors and consultants in road technologies and management. A project \nconcept, Mainstreaming Poverty Reducing Approaches into the National Road Network, has been developed for \ngrant financing under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction to reduce poverty by refining pro-poor appropriate \ntechnological solutions recently developed in Cambodia, and mainstreaming them into the road programs of the \nMinistry of Public Works and Transport, and the Ministry of Rural Development. The Project will work toward \nmaximizing the input of local entrepreneurs, materials, labor, and ingenuity. Thus, there is expected to be both an \nimmediate direct effect on income through employment and a long-term direct effect through the provision of cost-\neffective tools for the management of the road network. \n \n ", "  Appendix 14  59 \n \nC.

The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B  and  an  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  was  conducted  as  part  of  project  preparation  in  accordance  with  the \nEnvironmental Assessment Requirements of the Asian Development Bank. This summary initial \nenvironmental  examination  was  submitted  to  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport \n(MPWT) and approved. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n2.  The Project will (i) rehabilitate 150 kilometers (km) of national road from Siem Reap to \nPoipet on the border with Thailand; (ii) rehabilitate about 50 bridges along National Road (NR) \n56 from Sisophon to Samrong and NR68 from Samrong to Kralanh, which links to NR5 and NR6 \nbetween Siem Reap and Poipet.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n1.  Physical Resources \n3.  The road linking Siem Reap and Poipet is situated at about 10 meters (m) above sea \nlevel (asl) on a large area of the central plain that surrounds the Tonle Sap and continues to the \nMekong river system. Protruding from the plain are a few scattered outcrops of small sandstone \nhills  that  may  rise  to  about  100  m  asl  above  the  plain.  Otherwise,  the  plain  is  flat  and \nfeatureless. From the Tonle Sap the plain rises imperceptibly at a gradient of about 0.03% until \nit  encounters  the  lower  slopes  of  the  Chuor  Phnum  Dangrek  range  that  forms  the  divide \nbetween Cambodia and Thailand. The range rises to heights of about 400 m asl. \n \n4.   The  climate  of  the  area  is  characterized  by  a  distinct  wet  and  dry  season.  The \nsouthwest monsoon starts in May and ends in October while from November to April the dry \nnortheast  monsoon  occurs.  Temperatures  are  high  throughout  the  year  with  a  daytime \nmaximum of nearly 35 degrees Centigrade occurring in April just prior to the rainy season. With \nincreased cloud cover from the southwest monsoon, daytime temperatures decrease while a \nslight seasonal effect lowers the temperature to 30 degrees Centigrade in December. Average \nrainfall is 1,400\u20131,500 mm at Siem Reap with about 80% of the rainfall in the wet season. \n \n5.  The hydrology of the area is dominated by three systems, namely (i) the hydrological \nconditions of the upper catchment areas of the Chuor Phnum Dangrek, (ii) locally derived \ndrainage that originates from the main water courses and enters the Tonle Sap, and (iii) the \noperation of the Tonle Sap itself. In normal years, the Tonle Sap operates within the levels of \n1.1 m asl and 10.0 m asl. As the road is set about 10.0 m asl, parts of the road that cross the \nplain at or below this level are influenced. \n \n2.  Ecological Resources \n6.  The dominant land cover along the road between Siem Reap and Poipet is a mix of \npaddy fields and extensive grazing. Surrounding and within some of the paddy areas sugar \npalms are seen. From Sisophon to Poipet, shrub and low woody vegetation are dominant where \nthey are not cleared for paddy areas. \n \n ", "  Appendix 15  61 \n7.  NR56 runs through paddy fields and grazing land to the north from Sisophon. In Thmar \nPuok,  fruit  trees  are  planted.  The  road  borders,  at  a  distance,  Banteay  Chmar  Protected \nLandscape (BCPL) in Banteay Chmar for about 18 km. The road then runs through the area \nwhere degraded forest is dominant. NR68 from Samrong runs mainly through paddy fields with \nsome grazing land. The BCPL covers 81,200 hectare (ha) and spreads over the Thmar Puok \ndistrict of Banteay Meanchey Province and the Banteay Ampil District of Oddar Meanchey \nProvince. \n \n8.  According to the draft subdecree on management of natural protection prepared by the \nMinistry of Environment (MOE), development projects can be implemented in the protected \nlandscape areas, except for core areas. However, the BCPL has never been surveyed nor \ndemarcated so the location of the core area is unknown. According to a study undertaken by the \nprovincial department of environment, no rare or endangered species have been reported within \nthe BCPL. \n \n9.  The Tonle Sap is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia. It covers an area of \napproximately 250,00 ha in the dry season, and it extends to 1,000,000 ha during the wet \nseason. NR6 borders the transition zone of Tonle Sap Multiple Use Area between Siem Reap \nand Sisophon. In the transition zone, a variety of activities are allowed without causing adverse \nenvironmental impacts.  \n \n10.  The road crosses a floodplain that is linked to the upper part of the Tonle Sap. Both the \nfloodplain and the Tonle Sap are essential and linked components of the fisheries of the area. \nOver 200 species of fish are found in the Tonle Sap with 100 species regularly occurring in the \nfish catches. The huge wetland system with its habitat diversity supports one of the most \nproductive fisheries in Asia.  \n \n3.  Human and Economic Development \n11.  Rice and fish are important parts of the diet for people living in the project area. Rice \ncultivation is the dominant agricultural activity. Ponds located along the roads are utilized for \nirrigation and as duck ponds. In some areas along NR56, fruit trees and maize are planted. \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n1.  Drainage \n12.  The project area between Siem Reap and Sisophon is sometimes inundated in the wet \nseason. The raising of an embankment between Siem Reap and Sisophon to a flood-free height \nwill cause additional runoff to be held behind the embankment that will require an engineering \nsolution  in  terms  of  additional  cross-flow  discharge  capacity  to  be  incorporated  within  the \nembankment.  This  may  be  achieved  by  widening  the  existing  bridges  and  culverts  or \nconstructing additional cross-drainage through the road embankment. \n \n13.  The provision of additional cross-drainage will relieve water height that may build up \nagainst the embankment and if correctly designed, additional cross-drainage may maintain the \nflood  level  at  the  same  height  on  both  sides  of  the  embankment.  In  areas  where  rice  is \ncultivated,  improved  drainage  gives  landholders  better  access  to  their  paddy  fields  and \nincreased rice production. In order to facilitate drainage of floodwater, additional culverts are \nnecessary for cross-drainage. In the project area, erosion may not be significant due to the \nhydrology in the area. However, good construction practices will be implemented to avoid \nunnecessary sedimentation and water pollution. \n ", "62  Appendix 15 \n \n2.  Fisheries \n14.  Most of the fish species that are found in and around the Tonle Sap do not have \nmigratory patterns because the flood period is too short for breeding while others have definite \nmigratory preferences. They will move into flooded plain areas once these areas are inundated, \nmoving in during August or September and moving back to the Tonle Sap in October. The fish \nwill move up the natural water courses and, as the floodplain is inundated, the fish will move into \nthe plain for feeding and breeding. \n \n15.  The road crosses a floodplain that is of significance to fish movement, not within the \nrivers  that  are  the  primary  migration  routes  but  in  the  secondary  migration  areas  on  the \nfloodplain itself. As the road will be raised and equipped with additional cross-drainage, the \naccess for fish migration within the floodplain area will be restored or improved. \n \n3.  Noise and Dust \n16.  Noise  and  dust  from  unpaved  roads  are  a  major  nuisance  for  roadside  residents, \nespecially those in built-up areas. As traffic flows increase, this problem will get worse until road \nsurfaces are paved. The Project will have positive impacts on the quality of life of roadside \nresidents as it will result in a significant reduction in noise and dust generated. \n \n17.  However, during the construction stage, mitigation measures against noise and dust are \nnecessary. In order to reduce impacts by noise: (i) construction activities will be avoided at night \nclose to residents, and (ii)  contractors\u2019 vehicles will be equipped with mufflers. In order to \nminimize dust: (i)  the construction sites will be watered several times a day depending on the \ncondition,  and  (ii) the  pavement  of  the  road  will  start  from  built-up  areas  to  minimize  the \nnumbers of inhabitants affected by dust. \n \n4.  Construction Materials \n18.  Borrow pits will need to be located along the roads as a source of subbase material. \nBorrow pits will be left in a safe condition or restored as close as possible to a productive use. It \nis recommended that some of them be located on adjoining private land where they could be \nused as fish or duck ponds or for irrigation. \n \n19.  Gravel and crushed stone will be hauled by trucks to the project sites. There may be a \ntendency to overload the trucks, and several bridges along NR5 to Sisophon are already \nseverely  damaged.  To  avoid  further  bridge  deterioration  during  reconstruction,  it  will  be \nnecessary  to  ensure  that  the  contractors\u2019  haulage  trucks  do  not  exceed  the  bridge  and \npavement limits. In that way, dust from the trucks will also be reduced. \n \n20.  The bridge design recommends the use of precast concrete beams that would be cast in \na specialized concrete manufacturers\u2019 site. The beams are then transported to site and erected. \nThus apart from the bridge abutments and possibly for large box culverts, quantities of cement \nand aggregate that would normally have been brought on site will be significantly reduced. \n \n21.  Fuels and oil storage areas should be located well away from any water courses and be \nprovided with interceptor traps so that accidental spills do not contaminate the environment. All \nwaste oil should be stored and disposed of to acceptable oil industry standards. Washing-down \nwater also needs to be directed into this system and held in retention areas for treatment. \n ", "  Appendix 15  63 \nWherever possible, refueling should be carried out at a fuel storage area and not permitted \nwithin or adjacent to water courses. \n \n5.  Cleanup of the Construction Site \n22.  When construction is completed, the contractors must clean up the construction site by \nremoving all equipment and buildings and carrying out site remediation work. \n \n6.  Health and Safety \n23.  The main risks during the construction stage may arise from (i) inadequate sanitation \nfacilities in work camps, (ii) lack of preparation for accidents and injuries, (iii) introduction of \nsexually transmitted or other infections by immigrant workers, and (iv) outbreaks of malaria in \nthe labor force. In order to avoid these risks, (i) the camps will be located a certain distance from \ncommunities; (ii) the contractor will prepare a worker health and safety plan, including provision \nof sanitation facilities, equipment, and medical care; (iii) workers will receive health and safety \ntraining; and (iv) workers will under go pre-employment health screening.  \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n24.  The  Project  complies  with  procedures  set  out  by  MOE  on  environmental  review \nprocesses. The implementation of the IEE can be carried out by the Project Unit of MPWT \ntogether with the social and environment division that will be established within the Ministry. \nMPWT will develop a detailed environmental management plan (EMP) based on the IEE. \nMPWT, construction supervision consultants, and contractors will implement EMP. \n \n25.  During the detailed design stage, close consultations will be made with relevant line \nministries such as MOE, the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology on drainage, and the \nMinistry of Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry on irrigation. \n \n26.  A project management unit (PMU) will carry out environmental monitoring together with \nthe  construction  supervision  consultant,  and  the  results  will  be  reported  to  the  social  and \nenvironment division to be established in the repositioned Department of Planning. The results \nwill also be incorporated in the quarterly project progress reports submitted to ADB.  \n \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n27.  The environmental screening process for the Project indicates that overall negative \nenvironmental impacts are deemed to be minor because: \n(i)  the Project comprises rehabilitation and resurfacing of the existing roads with \nlimited realignment; \n(ii)  resettlement impacts are limited; \n(iii)  careful consideration has been given to avoiding environmental impacts along \nthe project road; and \n(iv)  measures are readily available to mitigate potential impacts. \n \nG.  Conclusion \n28.  Mitigation  measures  have  been  identified  to  address  potential  impacts.  The  IEE, \ntherefore, is considered sufficient and with implementation of the environmental management \nplan is considered to have complied with ADB\u2019s environmental assessment requirements. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20021107191152Z", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 4.0 for Windows", "ModDate": "D:20030117094445+08'00'"}}
