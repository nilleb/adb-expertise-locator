THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) proposed policy-\nbased loans to the Independent State of Samoa and the Kingdom of Tonga; and (ii) proposed \npolicy-based grants to the Independent State of Samoa, the Kingdom of Tonga, and Tuvalu for the \nPacific Disaster Resilience Program.1 The report also describes the proposed technical assistance \n(TA) for the Pacific Disaster Resilience Program and, if the Board approves the proposed loans \nand grants, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n2.  The proposed program will improve the resilience of the participating countries to disasters \ntriggered by natural hazards.2 It will support policy actions in disaster risk management (DRM), \nand provide participating Asian Development Bank (ADB) Pacific developing member countries \n(DMCs) with a source of contingent financing for timely disaster response, early recovery, and \nreconstruction activities. The attached TA will support DRM in participating DMCs, and assess the \noptions for, and potential costs and benefits from, a collaborative multi-country mechanism to \nprovide contingent financing in the event of disasters triggered by natural hazards. \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Disaster risk in the Pacific. Pacific DMCs are highly exposed to many different types of \nnatural  hazards,  including  tropical  cyclones,  earthquakes,  storm  surges,  tsunamis,  volcanic \neruptions, floods, and droughts. The region also experiences a disproportionately high share of \nglobal disaster impacts relative to its economic and demographic size. Disaster risk is growing \nbecause of climate change, poor development planning, unplanned urbanization, and ecosystem \ndecline. Climate change may increase the intensity of extreme weather events, including cyclones. \nRising sea levels are speeding erosion rates, and increasing the risk of storm surges for cyclone-\naffected countries, and rising ocean temperatures and ocean acidification are destroying the coral \nreefs that form natural coastal barriers. \n4.  When disasters strike, Pacific DMCs face further challenges due to their remote location \nand geographical makeup. Many countries have relatively small populations that are widely \ndispersed over several islands, many of which are isolated and difficult to reach in times of a \ndisaster. These factors contribute to the relatively high cost of disaster response. Due to the small \nsize of their economies and limited access to international financial markets, most Pacific DMCs \nhave limited resources and capacity to invest in disaster risk reduction (DRR), and to facilitate \ntimely recovery and reconstruction after a disaster. Delays in response and recovery exacerbate \nthe  indirect  economic  and  social  costs  of  disasters,  increasing  their  ultimate  impact,  and \ncompromising long-term fiscal balances. \n5.  Disasters can erode many years of economic development gains by damaging critical \ninfrastructure, disrupting social services, and diverting resources from development spending \ntoward disaster response and reconstruction. Disasters in the Pacific reduced average trend \ngrowth in gross domestic product (GDP) from 3.3% in 1980 to 2.6% in 2014.3 Considering only the \nexpected participating countries, examples of damage and loss caused by disasters in the region \n                                                \n1  ADB discussed this program with a further two countries beyond the three covered here. Other countries may consider \nparticipating in a contingent financing program in the future. \n2  The program is included in ADB. 2017. Regional Operations Business Plan: Pacific, 2018\u20132020.

Building disaster risk resilience requires actions on many fronts, such as strengthening \npolicy and institutional arrangements for DRM, including the capacity for post-disaster response \nand recovery; improving the disaster resilience of physical assets; and expanding disaster risk \nfinancing. Although Pacific governments have made significant gains in these areas, more effort \nis required, and they remain constrained by capacity and competing priorities. To establish their \neligibility to access the contingent financing under the program, the governments have undertaken \nprior policy actions to support DRM. \n7.  Governments\u2019  strategies.  To  mitigate  the  economic  risk  posed  by  disasters,  all \nparticipating DMCs have taken important steps to improve disaster resilience, and climate change \nand DRM objectives are generally well-defined within government policies and plans. All countries \ndefine legal responsibilities for DRM, including procedures for declaring a state of emergency; and \nhave some financial arrangements in place for disaster response, including annual contingency \nbudgets and, in some cases, sovereign disaster insurance.4 Pacific DMCs receive strong support \nfrom bilateral partners for immediate humanitarian aid after major events,  and development \npartners, including ADB, provide financing to support reconstruction, which typically starts several \nmonths after a disaster. However, in the event of a significant disaster, governments typically have \ninsufficient resources to meet immediate post-disaster financing needs, instead relying heavily on \nbudget reallocations, which can take some time to secure and often redirect funds away from \ndevelopment priorities.5 \n8.  Layered approach to disaster risk financing. The most cost-effective way of financing \ndisaster response is through a range of tools in a common framework to address different layers \nof risk, as no single instrument is optimal for responding to all disaster events, which range from \nfrequent, small-scale events to rare catastrophic events.6 The figure shows the range of potential \nfinancing tools, and the availability of these tools in the Pacific, from budget allocations that \naddress low-impact, high-frequency events (such as stormwater overflow), to global bonds that \naddress rare yet highly damaging events (such as high-magnitude earthquakes). \n9.  There  is strong  demand from  Pacific  DMCs for  additional  instruments  to  strengthen \nfinancial preparedness for disasters, and a clear need for this, given the rising incidence of disaster \nevents. Ideally, a comprehensive disaster risk financing strategy would combine both ex ante \n(arranged  ahead  of  a  disaster  occurring,  such  as  disaster  reserves,  contingency  budgets, \ncontingent credit, and insurance) and ex post mechanisms (post-disaster budget reallocations, \nborrowing, and international assistance). The precise mix would depend on the relative cost-\neffectiveness of alternative instruments for specific layers of risk in individual country contexts. \n10.  Contingent financing is particularly cost-effective in addressing risks pertaining to events \nthat would exhaust annual contingency budgets and any dedicated national reserves, but are too \nfrequent to be covered cost effectively through insurance. Governments typically have contingency \n                                                \n4  Disaster Risk Financing Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) describes the \nfinancial arrangements in place in each participating country to respond to disasters. \n5  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n6  D.

The  Pacific  Catastrophe  Risk  Assessment  and  Financing  Initiative \n(PCRAFI)7 offers insurance cover starting from 10-year return period attachments per peril, \ncovering the high-layer risks, together with any potential international assistance that the countries \nmight receive. As such, there is a gap for medium-layer risks in most Pacific countries, with the \nexception of the Cook Islands, which has a contingent credit facility with ADB.8 The program \nintends to cover the medium-layer risks gap, as represented in the figure. \nDisaster Risk Financing Layers and Existing Tools in the Pacific \n \n \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, INGO = international nongovernment organization. \nSource:  ADB \n \n11.  ADB engagement and lessons learned. ADB attaches significant importance to DRM in \nthe Pacific, and has provided considerable loans, grants, and TA for post-disaster disaster \nresponse, early recovery, and reconstruction. This support has progressively broadened from post-\ndisaster assistance to proactive DRR through a range of financing mechanisms. ADB provides \ndedicated funding to its concessional assistance-only countries through the Asian Development \nFund (ADF) 12 DRR financing mechanism to spur investment in DRR. ADB often plays a key role \nin post-disaster needs assessments. For the post-disaster humanitarian response phase, ADB\u2019s \nAsia Pacific Disaster Response Fund (APDRF), a dedicated quick-disbursing instrument, can \nprovide grants up to $3.0 million per event within a week of a disaster.9 Additional concessional \nfunds can be accessed through the ADF Disaster Response Facility for the early recovery and \nreconstruction phase, although processing associated projects takes time. \n12.  Since 1987, ADB has offered an emergency assistance loan instrument with extended \n                                                \n7  World Bank. 2017.

However, emergency assistance loans can still take 3 months or more to \nprocess,  and  reconstruction  loans  processed  under  normal  lending  modalities  can  take \nsignificantly longer. \n13.  ADB has piloted contingent financing in the Cook Islands (footnote 8) as a mechanism to \nprovide more timely disaster-response support, financed through a stand-alone, single-tranche \npolicy-based loan from regular ordinary capital resources. To access the contingent financing, the \nGovernment of the Cook Islands has undertaken prior actions to strengthen policy and institutional \narrangements for DRM, and the disbursement will be triggered when a state of disaster is declared. \nThe program reflects the unique features of this support. \n14.  The proposed approach. The program provides Pacific DMCs with a source of financing \nfor response, early recovery, and reconstruction activities for disaster events caused by all types \nof natural hazards. To support the development of effective and comprehensive DRM strategies \nand programs at the country level, the policy-based loan and policy-based grant modality will be \nused to agree on disaster resilience-related policy actions for each participating DMC. These policy \nactions will strengthen the resilience of institutions and communities in the participating DMCs. The \nproposed provision of financing contingent on a disaster is similar to the contingent credit facility \nprovided to the Cook Islands (footnote 8). The attached TA will support and monitor progress \ntoward achieving the governments\u2019  long-term DRM goals included in a program monitoring \nframework, and explore options for regional collaboration around contingent financing and a \npotential permanent regional contingent savings mechanism. \n15.  The  proposed  participating  DMCs\u2014Samoa,  Tonga,  and  Tuvalu\u2014face  similar  DRM \nchallenges, and will benefit greatly from a regional approach under which good practices are \nshared. The program will support coordination and cooperation both between Pacific DMCs and \nwith development partners on financing arrangements, policy reform discussions, and regional TA \nprograms. The TA activities will include regional sharing of experiences and lessons on DRM, \nparticularly on post-disaster financial management. \n16.  The program will complement existing disaster risk financing instruments available to \nPacific DMCs (figure), including annual contingency budgets, national disaster funds, parametric \ndisaster insurance, and traditional indemnity insurance. Its unique features are as follows: (i) it can \nmake a payment quickly and use the funds flexibly with no additional requirements, beyond \nnational public financial management requirements, to track and report on expenditures; (ii) the \namount that can be released is significant in terms of immediate response needs; (iii) the amount \nis not dependent on any assessment of loss or measure of the intensity of the natural hazard; and \n(iv) funds are available for disaster events triggered by any type of natural hazard. The program is \naligned with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u2013203010 and the Framework \nfor Resilient Development in the Pacific.11 \n17.  Economic impact of the disaster resilience program. The most fundamental benefit of \nthe program to Pacific DMCs is strengthened financial preparedness for disaster events. The \nprogram will provide a timely and predictable source of post-disaster financing, facilitating rapid \ndecision making and the implementation of priority actions. This will reduce the indirect economic \nand social consequences of direct physical losses. \n                                                \n10 United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. 2015.

It will only be possible to quantify the full economic impact of the DRM activities supported \nthrough the policy actions and attached TA after a disaster, as the benefits or costs avoided will \nbe determined by the scale and type of disaster and geographical area of impact. However, the \nfollowing are indicative of the expected economic benefits: \n(i)  fewer lives lost and injuries incurred during a disaster, reflecting improved DRM, \nresponse preparation, and public training; \n(ii)  reduced damage and losses to public and personal property due to (a) improved \nDRM, response preparation, and public training; (b) strengthened building codes; \nand (c) more resilient critical public infrastructure and assets; \n(iii)  reduced costs due to shorter business and public facility closures, and faster \nrestoration of livelihoods and essential infrastructure and services; \n(iv)  improved public safety and reduced risk of post-disaster health impacts due to a \nmore effectively coordinated and better targeted response; and \n(v)  reduced  opportunity  cost  associated  with  government  budget  or  aid  program \nreallocations, and/or any financial costs associated with additional commercial or \nconcessional borrowing that may be urgently needed to meet post-disaster costs. \n \n19.  Partner support. In the aftermath of disasters in the Pacific, major development partners, \nincluding the governments of Australia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, France, Japan, New \nZealand, and the United States usually move quickly to mobilize immediate relief, including in-kind \nsupport and financing through humanitarian nongovernment organizations. The United Nations\u2019 \nPacific Humanitarian Team mobilizes relief items and technical support from several offices in the \nregion. Major development partners and regional organizations are also actively supporting the \nimplementation of the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific (footnote 11). \n20.  The PCRAFI was originally established in 2007 as a joint initiative of the Pacific Community, \nthe World Bank, and ADB. The World Bank launched a disaster insurance pilot as part of this \ninitiative in 2012. Phase II of the PCRAFI program began in 2016, supported by the PCRAFI Multi-\nDonor Trust Fund with the World Bank as trustee. Phase II includes two core components: (i) the \nestablishment of a PCRAFI Facility12 as an insurance captive to provide Pacific island countries \nwith catastrophe risk insurance coverage on competitive terms, and (ii) a TA program to support \ncapacity building on disaster risk financing and the public financial management of disasters. \nGermany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States have provided grant funding toward \nthe establishment of the PCRAFI Facility, which issued its first insurance policies for the 2016\u2013\n2017 season (the PCRAFI\u2019s fifth season) for the Cook Islands, the Marshall Islands, Samoa, \nTonga, and Vanuatu. The World Bank\u2019s Pacific Resilience Program is carrying out complementary \nDRM work, and has secured some premium financing for PCRAFI insurance.13 The parametric \nnature of the insurance product and the small size of the payouts relative to total potential disaster \nlosses highlight the need for Pacific DMCs to use a mix of several financial instruments to be \nadequately prepared for disaster events of varying severity.14 \n21.  ADB priorities and contributions. ADB priorities in Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu are guided \nby the Pacific Approach, which serves as the country strategy for the 11 smaller DMCs in the \nPacific.15The Pacific Approach focuses on three strategic areas, one of which is managing risks. \n \n                                                \n12 The PCRAFI Facility was established in the Cook Islands in 2016 as a foundation with a board of directors that owns \na group captive insurer. \n13 World Bank. 2015. Pacific Resilience Program. Washington, DC. \n14 The proposed contingent financing will complement the PCRAFI insurance cover as it addresses more frequent, lower \nintensity events, as well as providing finance in response to disasters triggered by any type of natural hazards, \nincluding flooding, drought, and volcanic eruptions, which are not currently covered under the PCRAFI insurance. \n15 ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n ", "6 \nThe Pacific Approach also highlights the need to (i) expand ADB\u2019s work in climate change and \nDRM; (ii) introduce innovative solutions to strengthen disaster preparedness, address vulnerability, \nand build resilience; and (iii) pursue a more programmatic and regional approach to financing \nclimate change and DRM initiatives in the Pacific region. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n22.  The program is aligned with the following impact: strengthened resilience to climate change \nand disasters, as well as disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.16 The program will have \nthe following outcome: strengthened DRM in participating countries.17 \n \nC.  Outputs \n23.  Output  1:  Strengthened  regional  collaboration  on  disaster  risk  financing.  The \nprogram will support collaboration among the Pacific DMCs to strengthen disaster risk financing. \nSeveral countries have undertaken policy actions to strengthen disaster risk financing, including \nTuvalu setting up the Climate Change and Disaster Survival Fund and Tonga making a financial \ncommitment to their Emergency Fund in the current national budget. The participating DMCs have \nentered into a memorandum of understanding that will be the basis for collaboration among the \nparticipating countries in exploring, developing, and establishing the most suitable collaborative \nregional mechanism for contingent financing.18 The attached TA will support the participating \nDMCs to reach an agreement on the most suitable option. The participating DMCs are then \nexpected to enter into an agreement to establish the agreed mechanism. The program will provide \nparticipating  DMCs  with  quick-releasing  finance  to  support  response,  early  recovery,  and \nreconstruction activities after disaster events triggered by natural hazards. \n \n24.  While the funds disbursed through the program can partially meet immediate post-disaster \nfinancing needs, pooling such resources through a regional contingent savings mechanism can \nbring certain advantages. Doing so would (i) allow for an increased return on funds, because part \ncan be set aside in a nonliquid form as all participating countries are unlikely to experience \ndisasters and require drawdown of all funds simultaneously; (ii) provide seed financing to attract \nother development partners to provide further financing for post-disaster response, (iii) provide a \nmechanism into which participating countries can transfer further savings without incurring the \nadditional administrative burden of managing these funds themselves; and (iv) demonstrate the \neffectiveness of the contingent financing mechanism, so attracting the participation of a greater \nnumber of Pacific countries. \n25.  The attached TA will provide options for a sustainable regional mechanism to channel \ndisaster contingent financing, allowing funds to be replenished, additional countries to join, and \nother donors to contribute to the contingent funds. The mechanism would need to provide fast and \nefficient payments to DMCs following an eligible disaster, and follow best practices of good \ngovernance and financial management. Within the Pacific region, there are various existing models \nof trust funds, in addition to the PCRAFI Facility,19 while ADB brings experience in the creation of \n                                                \n16 Goal 1: Strengthened Integrated Adaptation and Risk Reduction to Enhance Resilience to Climate Change and \nDisasters, and Goal 3: Strengthened Disaster Preparedness, Response and Recovery) of the Framework for Resilient \nDevelopment in the Pacific. Under Goal 1, priority actions by regional organizations and other development partners \ninclude the following: \u201c(i) Establish a regional facility to assist governments in disaster and climate change risk \nfinancing, including insurance.\u201d \n17 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n18 Memorandum of Understanding: Pacific Regional Collaboration for Disaster Risk Contingent Financing (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 An independent legal entity domiciled in the Cook Islands. \n ", "7 \nmultidonor trust funds. These and other models will be assessed with support from the attached \nTA to identify a preferred approach for regional consideration. \n26.  Output 2: Strengthened enabling framework for disaster risk management. Each \nparticipating country must satisfy its country-specific policy actions to access contingent financing \nthrough the proposed policy-based loans and grants. These policy actions (included in the policy \nmatrix) have strengthened policy, governance, and institutional arrangements for DRM. In Samoa, \nthe Disaster Advisory Committee has endorsed the National Disaster Management Plan 2017\u2013\n2020, while Tonga has completed a comprehensive consultation process under its second Joint \nNational Action Plan on Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management, and enacted \nthe National Spatial Planning and Management Act. Policy actions have also supported improved \nDRM investment planning processes and tools. For example, (i) in Samoa, the Cabinet approved \nrecommendations from the roads vulnerability assessment and climate-resilient roads strategy, \nthe first 10 community-integrated management plans were submitted to the Ministry of Natural \nResources and Environment, and climate-resilient building codes were updated and adopted; (ii) \nTonga completed two district emergency management plans and trained government officers in \npost-disaster needs assessment; and (iii) in Tuvalu, the cabinet approved Tuvalu Climate Change \nand Disaster Survival Fund Regulations, and the National Disaster Committee approved national \nstandard operating procedures for cyclone response. \n27.  All 5 policy actions for Samoa, 6 policy actions for Tonga, and 4 policy actions for Tuvalu, \npresented in the countries\u2019 respective policy matrixes, have been completed.20 Each government \nhas also agreed upon an ongoing monitoring framework to strengthen DRM performance further. \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n28.  The single-tranche program is estimated to cost $15 million (Table 1), and will be supported \nby the attached TA.21 Post-disaster financing needs have been determined based on the likely \nfiscal impact of medium- to low-risk disasters, taking into account the resources likely available \nfrom  domestic  and  international  sources,  the  need  to  ensure  that  the  countries  maintain \nsustainable levels of debt, and the availability of concessional resources. As the proposed loan \nand grant funds are for contingent financing to support additional public spending associated with \nshort-term post-disaster financing needs, the loan and grant amounts are not directly correlated to \nthe cost of policy reforms. The financing per country ranges from 0.7%\u20138.0% of annual GDP, less \nthan the cost of a typical medium-risk disaster in the Pacific.  \n29.  The governments have requested loans of $3.1 million (Samoa) and $3.1 million (Tonga) \nfrom ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loans will \nhave a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \nloan  agreements. The governments  have  also  requested  grants  not exceeding  $2.9 million \n(Samoa), $2.9 million (Tonga), and $3.0 million (Tuvalu) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \n(ADF)  to  help  finance  the  program.  The  indicative  financing  comprises  resources  from  the \nconcessional resources regional pool, as well as countries\u2019 concessional lending and grant \nallocations. The financing plan is in Table 1. \n \n \n                                                \n20 The policy actions and areas of program monitoring are described in Appendixes 4, 6, and 8. \n21 A conservative estimate of $1.7 million (10% of total program amount, including the attached TA) was used for \nreporting climate change adaptation finance.  \n ", "8 \nTable 1: Financing Plan \nAmount ($ million)  Share of Totala \nSource  Samoa  Tonga  Tuvalu  Total  (%) \nAsian Development Bank             \nCOL PBA (loan)  1.1  1.1  0.0  2.2  14.7 \nCOL regional pool (loan)  2.0  2.0  0.0  4.0  26.7 \nADF PBA (grant)  0.9  0.9  1.0  2.8  18.7 \nADF regional pool (grant)  2.0  2.0  2.0  6.0  40.0 \nTotal  6.0  6.0  3.0  15.0  100.0 \nADF = Asian Development Fund, COL = concessional ordinary capital resources loan, PBA = performance-based \nallocation. \na Numbers may not sum precisely due to rounding.  \nSource: ADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n30.  The executing agencies will be the ministry of finance equivalents in each country,22 and \nthe implementing agencies will include ministries and offices responsible for finance, planning, \ninfrastructure, and disaster response. The policy actions were implemented from 1 January to 6 \nNovember 2017,23 while the activities of the attached TA and the program will be completed on 31 \nDecember 2022. Each participating DMC has country-specific policy actions and separate loan \nand/or  grant  agreements.  The  implementing  agencies  will  implement  an  agreed  program \nmonitoring framework with the support of country-level DRM or climate change committees24 and \nattached TA resources. \n31.  Disbursement of the policy-based loans and grants. A country\u2019s eligibility to withdraw \nloan and grant proceeds will be based on its achievement of prior actions in the policy matrix. \nHowever, actual withdrawals will be deferred and only triggered after the government declares a \nstate of disaster or emergency after a natural hazard event. In the event of a declared disaster, the \ngovernment can withdraw the loan and grant proceeds partially or entirely, depending on the \ngovernment\u2019s assessment of the disaster\u2019s severity and resultant need, and the government and \nADB have agreed on the withdrawal amount. Any remaining funds at the end of the program period \n(para. 30) will be disbursed to the respective participating countries for strengthening disaster \nresilience. Funds are spent through national budget processes. Loan and grant proceeds will be \nwithdrawn following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \nDuring TA implementation, ADB through the attached TA, will periodically monitor the continuing \nimplementation of the agreed policy actions according to the program monitoring framework. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n32.  ADB, in consultation with the governments and other stakeholders, will support actions to \nstrengthen DRM, including activities to improve disaster preparedness and reduce disaster risk, \nthrough the attached TA.25 ADB will be the executing agency and will exercise overall responsibility \nfor all TA activities. The TA will support (i) the exploration of options for a regional, collaborative, \ncontingent financing mechanism for disasters; and (ii) priority DRM activities in participating \n                                                \n22 The Ministry of Finance of Samoa, Ministry of Finance and National Planning of Tonga, and Ministry of Finance and \nEconomic Development of Tuvalu. \n23 Policy actions were identified and their implementation encouraged through policy dialogue, which has been ongoing \nsince 2016 with some support from various ongoing TA. \n24 National DRM committees and councils typically only meet in the event of major impending disasters and their \naftermath, but DRR is being increasingly covered by national climate change working groups or committees, which \ntypically meet more frequently. \n25 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \ncountries and at a regional level, including expanding engagement in the program output areas, \nbuilding on the policy actions achieved to access policy-based financing, and supporting the \nimplementation of a program monitoring framework to further strengthen DRM systems. This will \ninclude advisory and capacity development support for DRM planning and governance, the \nmainstreaming of DRM into sector policies, support for post-disaster public financial management, \nsupport for the enhancement of disaster risk financing strategies, and disaster preparedness \nmeasures. \n \n33.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.0 million, and will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6 and TASF-other sources). \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n34.  The envisaged impacts of the policy actions include (i) strengthened policy, governance, \nand institutional arrangements for DRM; (ii) improved DRM investment planning processes and \ntools that will strengthen the resilience of public and private physical assets; and (iii) expanded \ndisaster risk financing to meet countries\u2019 needs during the immediate aftermath of and early \nrecovery period following a disaster. The policy actions will improve the participating countries\u2019 \nability to withstand and cope with the short- and longer term impacts of disasters and climate \nchange. \nB.  Governance \n35.  All participating countries have some financial management arrangements in place for \ndisaster events. However, coordinating disaster responses, including the support offered by \ndonors and civil society organizations with competing requirements and procedures, can pose \nsignificant administrative challenges, and government absorption capacities are often stretched in \nthe aftermath of disaster events. The policy actions and technical support have been identified \nbased on a DRM gap and needs analysis in each country. The attached TA will prioritize capacity \ndevelopment focusing on financing and budgetary issues, including post-disaster budget allocation \nand execution, to ensure that all countries participating in the program have adequate systems in \nplace to use program resources in an effective, accountable, and transparent manner. \n36.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the governments and the Ministry of Finance of Samoa, Ministry of Finance and National \nPlanning of Tonga, and Ministry of Finance and Economic Development of Tuvalu. \nC.  Poverty and Social \n37.  The policy actions will allow the participating governments to maintain greater fiscal stability \nin the event of a disaster and to initiate relief and recovery efforts with minimum delay, mitigating \nthe immediate economic and social impacts of a disaster. Implementation of the policy actions is \nexpected  to  continue  to  strengthen  existing  social  protection  arrangements,  ensuring  that \ncommunities and vulnerable households (including households headed by women) are able to \nreach safety in the event of a disaster, access sufficient relief supplies to meet immediate needs, \nand receive support to rebuild their lives and assets. \n38.  The program is classified as effective gender mainstreaming, and includes key policy \nactions that will equally benefit both women and men. This further ensures positive poverty and \n ", "10 \nsocial impacts through stronger and gender-inclusive DRM. The TA will also ensure that any tools \nand plans are gender-sensitive, and that women are included in building knowledge in key areas \nof  DRM  accountabilities,  including  post-disaster  public  financial  management,  and  disaster \npreparedness measures. Sex-disaggregated data is included in planning tools and knowledge \nproducts, and women are involved in consultations and meetings related to the DRM activities. \nD.  Safeguards \n39.  In line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified category \nC for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Program activities will \nbe confined to policy and institutional reforms and TA, and none of the activities will result in or \nlead to any physical works that could create environmental or social impacts, physical or economic \ndisplacement, of involuntary resettlement. The activities will not negatively affect indigenous \npeoples. Stakeholder dialogue was carried out during the program design and will continue during \nprogram implementation. \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n40.  Risks to program implementation are related to possible external shocks on the economies \nand capacity constraints of the government agencies, including constraints in public financial \nmanagement systems. These risks will be managed partially through TA support for capacity \ndevelopment of government counterparts. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in \nTable 2 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.26 \nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInsufficient action on the recommendations  The governments have already actively strengthened PFM \nto improve financial management  more broadly, and the TA will provide support to address \nprocedures for disaster response  weaknesses identified in PFM during disasters. \nExternal shocks (e.g., disasters and  Development partners help the governments build buffers to \neconomic downturns) damage the  improve resilience to economic shocks. \neconomies. \nGovernment agencies lack the capacity to  The attached TA will develop the capacity of government \nimplement the DRM actions.  counterparts.

ASSURANCES \n41.  The governments and the executing agencies have assured ADB that implementation of \nthe program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described \nin detail in the loan and grant documents. The governments have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the program, which are set forth in the loan and grant agreements.
