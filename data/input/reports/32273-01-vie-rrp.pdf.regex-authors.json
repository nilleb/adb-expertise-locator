The Ministry of Finance (MOF), acting \non behalf of the Government of Viet Nam, will issue a guarantee \nto the commercial banks guaranteeing EVN's payment obligations \nunder the commercial banks' loan. \n \nProposed ADB  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will issue a guarantee to the \nGuarantee  commercial  banks  guaranteeing  the  Government's  payment \nobligations  under  the  MOF  guarantee  corresponding  to  $325 \nmillion of principal (i.e. 95% of the $342 million loan amount), plus \ninterest payable by EVN under the commercial banks\u2019 loan. ADB\u2019s \nmaximum aggregate liability under the ADB guarantee will not \nexceed  $500  million.        Furthermore,  in  no  event  will  ADB \nguarantee more than $325 million of amounts corresponding to \nprincipal payable by EVN under the commercial banks\u2019 loan.  The \nADB guarantee will be issued on the conditions that the MOF \nguarantee has been duly executed by both MOF, on behalf of the \nGovernment, and by Viet Nam and ADB\u2019s standard sovereign \nindemnity  provisions  (e.g.,  cross-default,  negative  pledge,  and \nindemnity provisions) are incorporated into the MOF guarantee, \nthereby obligating Viet Nam to reimburse ADB for all amounts \nADB pays the commercial banks pursuant to the ADB guarantee. \nThe proposed guarantee is to be anchored on two existing loans \nto EVN for the Northern Power Transmission Sector Project, and \nthe Northern Power Transmission Expansion Project. \n   \nClassification   Targeting classification: General intervention \n  Sector (subsectors): Energy (electricity transmission and \ndistribution, trade finance) \nThemes  (subthemes):  Sustainable  Economic  Growth \n(promoting  macroeconomic  stability,  promoting  economic \nefficiency  and  enabling  business  environment)  and  Private \nSector Development (private sector investment)  \n   \nEnvironment  Category B  \nAssessment   \nAn initial environmental examination (IEE) and an environmental \nassessment and review framework (EARF) have been prepared. \nIn addition, initial environmental examinations for representative \nsub projects have been prepared. One due diligence report for a \ncompleted  subproject  have  been  completed.  The  other \nsubprojects will be assessed later, together with feasibility studies \nas for a sector loan. In addition, the transaction documentation will \nonly  allow  loan  proceeds  to  fund  category  B  and  category  C \nsubprojects. Category B sensitive and category A subprojects will \nnot be financed under the commercial banks\u2019 loan to EVN. \n   ", "2 \nProject Description  The proposed project aims to provide EVN the means to access \ncommercial bank loans on competitive terms to finance short-term \ninvestments  (2010\u20132012)  in  transmission  and  distribution.  The \nproject will include the construction of about 18 kilometers (km) of \n500  kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  lines  and  268  km  of  220  kV \ntransmission lines; 153 km of 110 kV transmission lines, and will \nadd  900  megavolt-amperes  (MVA)  of  additional  transformation \ncapacity  at  the  500  kV  level,  3,400  MVA  of  additional \ntransformation capacity at the 220 kV level, and 1,483 MVA of \nadditional transformation capacity at the 110 kV level. On the \nmedium- and low-voltage grids, the project will rehabilitate rural \nand urban grids, adding more than 200 km of medium- and low-\nvoltage lines and cables.  \n \nRationale  Infrastructure  development  is  a  key  component  of  Viet  Nam's \nmedium-term  development  plan.  Urgent  expansion  of \ninfrastructure is required to remove existing bottlenecks, increase \nservice coverage, and attract private sector investments that will \nhelp  achieve  and  sustain  the  projected  economic  growth, \nespecially  given  the  huge  economic  growth  seen  in  the  past \ndecade. The government aims to concentrate on upgrading the \nexisting  infrastructure  and  urging  greater  private  sector \nparticipation in new infrastructure, including energy development \nand power generation.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  construction  of  new  transmission  lines  and \nupgrading  of  existing  transmission  lines  and  associated \nsubstations will address the transmission bottlenecks and thus \nenable evacuation of additional power generation to load centers. \nThe  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  reduced  system  losses  to \nbelow 10%, and ensuring reliable supply of electricity to meet the \ngrowing demand driven by the economic growth of the country.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  The total cost of the project is $544 million, out of which $342 \nmillion  will  be  financed  through  a  13-year  loan  made  by  a \nsyndication of foreign commercial banks; the remaining amount \nwill be financed by EVN. \n   \nExecuting Agency   Viet Nam Electricity \n   \nProcurement  EVN  and  its  subsidiaries  will  issue  tenders  following  national \nstandards in procurement (in accordance with the procurement \nplan provided in Supplementary Appendix G). In accordance with \nthe  Article  3.16  of  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time), ADB will conduct post-review of the \nprocurement  process  to  ensure  (i)  the  need  for  economy  and \nefficiency for procurement of the goods and works involved, (ii) all \neligible  bidders  from  developed  and  developing  countries  are \ngiven the same information and equal opportunity to compete in \nproviding goods and works, and (iii) there is transparency in the \nprocurement process. \n   \n ", "3 \nBenefits and Impact  The credit enhancement provided by the ADB guarantee will lower \nEVN\u2019s  cost  of  borrowing  and  lengthen  its  loan  tenure.  It  also \nallows  commercial  banks  to  reengage  in  lending  in  emerging \nmarkets and in the infrastructure sector.  \n \nThe  main  beneficiaries  of  the  project  will  be  the  industrial, \ncommercial,  residential,  and  rural  consumers  in  Viet  Nam. \nConsumers will benefit from the increase and improved quality of \npower  supply,  which  will  result  in  improved  performance  and \nlonger  life  of  electrical  equipment.  By  reducing  the  technical \nlosses, EVN will not have to resort to load shedding, which will \nbenefit  large  economic  centers  where  numerous  industrial \ncompanies are established. The stable supply of electricity in Viet \nNam  will  further  stimulate  economic  growth,  and  increase \nemployment and income-earning opportunities for the poor which \nwill support the development of the country, \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  This project involves no new technology and EVN and all of its 11 \nsubsidiaries have all the necessary skills to design and implement \nthe transmission projects. EVN's revenues are in dong, but the \nloan from the commercial banks will be in foreign currencies. The \nprimary risks are (i) the credit risk of EVN, (ii) foreign exchange \nfluctuations, and (iii) the ability of the Government to honor its \nobligations to the commercial banks under the MOF guarantee.  \n \nEVN\u2019s  failure  to  pay  under  the  commercial  banks\u2019  loan  could \ntrigger  a  call  on  the  MOF  guarantee,  which  could  result  in  a \ndemand under the ADB guarantee. These risks will be mitigated \nby (i) the sovereign indemnity provisions in the MOF guarantee, \nand (ii) the annual revision of the tariffs that will reflect the change \nin fuel costs and local inflation. \n \nIn addition, since March 2009, Viet Nam has introduced an annual \ntariff  adjustment  under  the  proposed  competitive  power \ngeneration market, which will also mitigate the risks of the project. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  Advisory technical assistance will be provided to EVN and its 11 \nsubsidiaries to supervise the implementation of the project with \nregards to compliance with ADB's procurement and safeguards \nrequirements. The cost of the technical assistance is estimated at \n$720,000  of  which  $600,000  will  be  financed  through  the \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-others). The executing \nand implementing agencies will finance $120,000 equivalent in \nkind. The ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time) will apply. \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) guarantee (the Guarantee), which will cover certain payment obligations of \nthe Ministry of Finance of the Government of Viet Nam under a guarantee issued in connection with \ncommercial loans to Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN) under the EVN\u2019s Investment Support Program. \nADB's obligations under the ADB guarantee will be counter indemnified by the Socialist Republic of \nViet  Nam.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Implementation \nSupervision and if, the Board approves the proposed ADB guarantee, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Macroeconomic Performance \n2.  Viet Nam has enjoyed rapid economic growth in the two decades since 1988, when real gross \ndomestic product (GDP) grew at the average annual rate of 7.4%. Following a modest slowdown in \n1998\u20131999 caused by the Asian financial crisis, real GDP growth accelerated more or less steadily \nduring 2000\u20132007, from 4.8% in 1999 to 8.5% in 2007.  \n \n3.  However, the country has been experiencing severe macroeconomic difficulties since 2008. \nInflation and the trade deficit surged in the first half 2008. The macroeconomic imbalances that had \nbuilt up for several years contributed to the growing inflationary pressures, and persistent trade \ndeficits were exacerbated by domestic supply-side shocks (such as poultry epidemics). The rise in \nworld commodity prices also contributed to the surge in inflation. The government responded by \ntightening monetary and fiscal policies and taking other measures to stabilize the macroeconomic \nsituation.  \n \n4.  The global economic crisis adversely affected Viet Nam in 2008 by slowing growth of exports \nand contributing to the decrease in investment inflows. It has had more adverse impacts on Viet Nam \nin 2009. In particular, the crisis has further reduced exports, and has also reduced revenue from \ninternational tourism and inflows of foreign direct investment. Exports decreased by 9.8%, the number \nof international tourist arrivals fell by 22.1%, and foreign direct investment inflows declined by 18.4% \nin January\u2013June 2009 compared with the same period in 2008. \n   \n5.  The government has taken a number of measures to mitigate the adverse impact of the global \neconomic crisis on growth and poverty in Viet Nam. These measures include one-off additional \nfinancial assistance to poor households, housing support for the poor, and provision of interest-free \nshort-term loans to firms that have had to shed at least 30% of their staff and are experiencing \ndifficulties in paying the wages of the remaining staff. Furthermore, the government has increased the \nbudgetary allocation for the existing social assistance programs, such as the program for poverty \nreduction in ethnic minority and mountainous areas (so-called Program 135) and the health insurance \nprogram for the poor and near poor. It has also accelerated the formulation and approval of the \nprogram for accelerated poverty reduction in the 61 poorest districts. A total of $935 million has been \nallocated to the social safety net in the central government budget for 2009, compared with $518 \nmillion spent in 2008. \n \n6.  Viet Nam continues its impressive progress in reducing poverty. The Millennium Development \nGoal of halving poverty has been achieved well ahead of the 2015 target, with poverty falling from ", "2 \n28.9% in 2002 to 15.9% in 2006.1 Poverty continues to persist in particular regions and ethnic \nminorities, however, with the incidence of poverty in minority populations remaining at 52.3% in 2006, \nthough reduced significantly from 86.4% in 1993. In response, the government recently identified the \n61 poorest districts in 20 provinces for priority attention. \n \n7.  Real GDP growth is forecast to rebound to 6.5% in 2010, if the external environment starts \nimproving during that year. A medium-term economic challenge for the government is to increase \ngrowth without fueling inflation and widening the current account deficit. To this end, the government \nneeds to raise the efficiency of the economy and ease supply-side constraints on growth by removing \ninfrastructure bottlenecks, improve the legal and regulatory framework for private sector development, \nstrength public administration, increase the supply of skilled labor, and speed up restructuring and \nequitization of state-owned enterprises and banks. Accelerating economic reforms would help Viet \nNam weather the global financial crisis and strengthen foundations for sustainable rapid growth over \nthe medium-to-long term. \n \n2.  Energy Sector Performance \n \n8.  The strong economic growth in Viet Nam over the past decade has resulted in substantial \ndemand for electricity throughout the country. The link between economic development and power \ndemand is very strong. Over the past 10 years, GDP growth averaged 7.5% per annum, while \nelectricity demand growth averaged about 16.0% per annum. The demand for electricity has been \ntriggered by ongoing electrification in new areas, expansion of transmission and distribution networks, \nand the demand from industries in the new industrial zones and enterprises throughout the country \nand from the growing service sector. Between 1995 and 2008, household access to the grid increased \nfrom 50% to nearly 94% and the per capita consumption increased during the same period from 156 \nkilowatt-hours (kWh) per household per month to about 800 kWh. In recent years, a supply shortage \nhas become more evident, although it eased in late 2008 and early 2009 as the demand growth \nreduced due to the global financial crisis.  \n \n9.  Viet Nam Electricity (EVN), the national power utility in Viet Nam, is organized as a holding \ncompany, with a series of wholly owned subsidiaries. EVN owns the strategic power plants, holds \nmajority shareholding stakes in partially privatized power plants, and invests as the sole investor or in \npartnership with other public and private investors in new power generating plants. Key subsidiaries \ninclude three regional power companies that are responsible for power transmission and distribution \nfrom 110 kilovolts (kV) and less in northern Viet Nam (Power Company 1 [PC1]), southern Viet Nam \n(Power Company 2 [PC2]), and central Viet Nam (Power Company 3 [PC3]); and power distribution \ncompanies responsible for power distribution in large cities such as Ha Noi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hai \nPhong, Da Nang, Hai Dong, Khanh Hoa, and Dong Nai. The power companies each maintain their \nown financial accounts and have a high degree of managerial and financial autonomy. Other key \nentities under EVN include the Power Transmission Corporation (NPT) responsible for high-voltage \n(220 kV and 500 kV) power transmission; four power engineering consulting companies; the National \nLoad  Dispatch  Center;  and  subsidiaries  engaged  in  non-core  activities  such  as  equipment \nmanufacturing, telecommunications, real estate, and financial services. \n \n10.  EVN owns about 63.5% of all generation capacity in Viet Nam. The remainder is shared \namong independent power producers (IPPs) owned by state-owned corporations and groups and \nother  small  private  investors  (23%),  foreign  build-operate-transfer  (BOT)  projects2 (9.8%),  and \nimported power from the People's Republic of China (PRC) (3.7%).  \n                                                 \n1  Sources: Viet Nam household living standards surveys 2002, 2004, and 2006. Analysis of the data collected in the 2008 \nsurvey has not yet been completed and remains unavailable. \n2  Viet Nam distinguishes between IPPs and BOTs. Like BOTs, IPPs sell power to EVN under power purchase agreements \nbut these agreements are not as favorable to the investors as those with BOT investors, and may get renegotiated as the \n \n ", "3 \n11.  A reliable electricity supply is essential for economic growth and to achieve poverty reduction \ntargets. Based on the Master Plan No. VI developed in 2006, to address the electricity deficit and \nimprove the quality and reliability of electricity supply to industrial, rural, commercial, and residential \nconsumers, Viet Nam needs to increase its generating capacity from 15,860 MW in 2008 to 25,000 \nMW in 2010 and 60,000 MW in 2025. To meet the investment needs for generation transmission and \ndistribution, Viet Nam must mobilize about $4 billion per annum between 2009 and 2015, out of which \nabout $2.3 billion per annum will be spent on new generation facilities and the remainder will be \ninvested in transmission and distribution. Under the government plans, EVN will finance about two-\nthirds of the investment in generating plants (one-third is to be given to local and foreign direct \ninvestment in the form of IPP and BOT schemes) and 100% of the investment in transmission and \ndistribution.  Official  development  assistance  and  other  external  sources  of  financing  will  remain \nsignificant in the medium term as local borrowing. Domestic bond issuance and equitization are \nunlikely to be available. The government's Socio-economic Development Plan emphasizes the role of \nphysical  infrastructure  in  increasing  national  competitiveness  and  market  access,  and  attracting \ninvestments needed to sustain the economic and poverty reduction. ADB's country operation business \nplan 2009\u201320113 for Viet Nam, supports the objectives of the Socio-economic Development Plan and \nnotes the importance of removing infrastructure bottlenecks in the power sector to increase the \ncompetitiveness of Viet Nam's private sector-led manufacturing and service sectors.  \n \n12.  As part of ADB's country strategy and program midterm review conducted in May 2009, a \ngovernance-risk  assessment  study4 in  the  energy  sector  in  Viet  Nam  concluded  that  the  Public \nFinancial Management Reform Program, led by the MOF, is making steady progress, with support \nfrom a multidonor trust fund. Despite the difficulties of tackling corruption in an environment lacking \nauthentic  separation  of  powers,  there  is  clear  evidence  of  firm  government  commitment  and \nachievements.  Analysis  of  the  most  recent  aggregate  perception  data  suggests  that  (i)  both \ngovernance and corruption perceptions of Viet Nam are better than would be expected, (ii) corruption \nin Viet Nam is not a significant impediment to growth and poverty reduction, and (iii) cases of gross \ncorruption are relatively modest in size and are effectively tackled when they are exposed. Regarding \nthe power sector, the report concludes that EVN is an efficient and competent power utility although \nprocurement and financial management could be improved.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Key Problems and Constraints  \n \n13.   There are a number of issues in the sector: (i) high dependence on hydropower, (ii) low \nreserve  margins,  (iii)  maintaining  adequate  investments  to  meet  exceptionally  rapid  growth  in \nelectricity  demand,  (iv)  addressing  shortcomings  in  pricing  and  tariffs,  and  (v)  continuing  sector \nreforms.  The  government  and  EVN  are  taking  measures  to  address  some  of  these  issues,  as \nexplained below. \n \n14.  Generation mix. As of the end of 2008, the share of hydropower was 37% of total installed \ncapacity, which is higher than the international average of about 15%, while that of coal (14% of the \ninstalled capacity) is lower than the international average of about 40%. While Viet Nam's dependency \non hydropower has been slightly reduced with the implementation of new thermal power plants, its \nreserve margin during the dry season remains dangerously low. The gas-fuelled power plants in the \n                                                 \nnature of the industry changes. IPPs do not meet the requirements of Decree 78 (BOT Decree) and hence are ineligible \nfor government support. BOTs, on the other hand, use a traditional two-part power purchasing agreement (involving \ncapacity charge and energy charge) and may receive government support under Decree 78. Examples of BOTs are the \nPhu My 2.2 and Phu My 3 gas-fired power plants, both financed by ADB in 2002\u20132003. \n3  ADB. 2008. Country Operation Business Plan: Viet Nam, 2009\u20132011. Manila.  \n4  This study followed the methodology set out in the implementation guidelines for ADB. 2006. Second Governance and \nAnticorruption Action Plan. Manila. \n ", "4 \nsouth (representing about 42% of the installed capacity of the country) can supply only part of central \nand northern Viet Nam's power demand deficit, and at a higher transmission cost. As a result, Viet \nNam is importing electricity from the PRC during the dry season to meet demand in the north. Given \nthe severe capacity shortage and imbalance in the energy mix, the government, in its Sixth Power \nDevelopment Master Plan,5 designates coal power plants as key base-load generation capacity and \nhas identified priority coal-fired power plants for immediate implementation. The evolution of the \ngeneration mix is represented in Figure 1. \n   \nFigure 1: Evolution of the Generation Mix\n70.00%\n60.00%\nHydropower\n50.00%\nCoal  \n40.00%\nGas \n30.00%\nOil \n20.00%\nImport from China, People\nRepublic of\n10.00%\n0.00%\n2000 2005 2006 2007 2008\n \n       Source: Viet Nam Electricity. \n \n15.  The government estimates that the generation capacity addition of 42,000 MW during 2007\u2013\n2017 will cost $32.5 billion, or $46.0 billion inclusive of transmission and distribution investments. EVN \nis expected to fund about $35.0 billion of this but the remaining $11.0 billion needs to be undertaken \nby non-EVN parties, i.e., other state-owned enterprises and private sector investors.  \n \n16.  Viet Nam is relatively advanced in the participation of the private sector in power generation. \nOf the total 12,600 MW of installed capacity as of the end of 2007, EVN's share was 74% (9,359 MW), \nwith  14%  (1,771  MW)  being  IPPs,  i.e.,  domestic  non-EVN  investors  (private  and  state-owned \nenterprises), and 12% (1,466 MW) being BOTs, i.e., owned by foreign private investors. Even EVN's \ngeneration plants are being equitized (i.e., partially privatized) with the exception of the strategic \nmultipurpose  hydropower  plants.  As  of  the  end  of  2007,  about  1,500  MW  of  EVN's  generation \ncapacity had been equitized. \n \n17.  Private investment. To meet the substantial investment needs, the government has always \nintended to invite wider participation of the private sector in generation. In Phu My 2.2 and Phu My 3 \ngas-fired power plants, the government used a unique dual approach in soliciting private sector \ninvestors through a competitive tender (for Phu My 2.2) and bilateral negotiation (Phu My 3). This dual \n                                                 \n5  The Sixth Power Development Master Plan stipulates that 8,225 MW of BOT capacities will be commissioned before \n2015, with another 6,450 MW as either BOT or IPP capacity. \n ", "5 \napproach resulted in shorter project development time and competitive tariffs because the tariff of the \nbilaterally negotiated project (Phu My 3) was controlled by benchmarking against the tariff of the \ncompetitively tendered project (Phu My 2.2).  \n \n18.  Since the Phu My projects, the government has continued seeking use of the same dual \napproach.  Because  the  general  regulatory  framework  for  private  sector  participation  is  not \ncomprehensive, the protections and incentives for investors had to be negotiated on a transaction-by-\ntransaction basis. However, the government does not have enough technical or financial capacity to \nundertake the complex task of negotiating BOT projects. The government has also adopted a unique \nprivate-public partnership (PPP) approach, where one power plant complex hosts both an EVN-\nowned plant and a private sector owned plant, with the sites and common facilities prepared by EVN \nwith public sector financing. While this approach was intended to ease the burden on the private \nsector investors, this has often resulted in delays in the handover of the site to the private sector \ninvestors, causing prolonged renegotiation of the tariff. \n \n19.  Reform of the power sector. Viet Nam is quite well advanced in terms of sector reforms. The \nLaw on Electricity was approved by the National Assembly XI Session 6 of Viet Nam on 3 December \n2004. Chapter IV of the law stipulates provisions for the electric market. Article 17 of the operational \nprinciples  (i)  ensures  transparency,  equality,  fair  competition,  and  nondiscrimination  among \nparticipants  in  the  electricity  market;  (ii)  appreciates  the  rights  to  select  partners  and  forms  of \ntransaction of electricity buyers and sellers on the market in accordance with the development level of \nthe electricity market; and (iii) allows the state to regulate the operation of the electricity market to \nachieve sustainable development of the electricity system, meeting the requirements of safe, stable, \nand efficient electric supply. Article 18 stipulates that the electricity market will be formulated and \ndeveloped by phases by setting up (i) a competitive power generation market (2005\u20132014), (ii) a \ncompetitive power wholesale market (2015\u20132023), and (iii) a competitive power retail market (after \n2024). \n \n20.  By decision No. 26/2006/QD-TTg dated 26 January 2006, the prime minister approved a \nschedule and conditions for the formulation and development of the power market in Viet Nam that \nstipulates  (i)  assurance  of  stable  and  reliable  electric  supply  with  higher  quality;  (ii)  attracting \ninvestment capital in electricity from all economic sectors, both domestically and abroad, gradually \nreducing the state budget investment in the electricity industry; (iii) step-by-step development of a \nstable competitive electricity market, eliminating subsidy for the electricity industry and increasing \nelectricity buyers\u2019 rights to select electricity suppliers; (iv) improving the production and business \nefficiency  of  the  electricity  industry,  and  rising  electricity  price;  and  (v)  ensuring  sustainable \ndevelopment of the electricity industry. \n \n21.  In 2005, the Electricity Regulatory Authority of Viet Nam (ERAV) was established within the \nMinistry of Industry and Trade (MOIT) with its mission to implement the above decisions. EVN has \nseparated the generation, transmission, and distributions operations into separate entities under a \nholding company. The equitization process has resulted in the transformation of EVN's subsidiaries \ninto power joint-stock companies enabling future sale of shares to private and public investors as well \nas to employees. The power sector in Viet Nam accounts for about six power operations subsidiaries \nthat have been equitized and with EVN retaining the majority of its shares. Most of the non-core \nbusiness subsidiaries of EVN have been equitized and EVN is a minority stakeholder in most of them. \n \n22.  The ERAV functions include (i) issuing and enforcing electricity licenses, (ii) advising the \nminister on power market structure and policy, (iii) establishing retail tariff-setting principles and \nmechanisms, (iv) proposing market design and developing an associated regulatory framework, (v) \napproving the power purchase agreement of the single buyer, (vi) monitoring the progress of the \nimplementation of new generation and transmission projects, (vii) monitoring the operation of the \n ", "6 \npower market, and (viii) monitoring and recommendations to protect the short- and long-term energy \nbalance. \n \n23.  In line with the sector reform road map, the government approved EVN\u2019s proposal to establish \nthe National Power Transmission Corporation (NPT) on 1 July 2008. The NPT is a fully state-owned \nsingle member limited liability company under EVN and is now officially in operation. It is responsible \nfor the investment, construction, operation, and maintenance of the transmission network in Viet Nam, \nincluding 220 kV and 500 kV lines and associated substations. NPT subsidiaries consist of four power \ntransmission  companies  (PTCs)\u2014Power  Companies  1,  2,  3,  and  4\u2014and  three  power  project \nmanagement  boards\u2014the  Northern  Power  Project  Management  Board,  Central  Power  Project \nManagement Board, and Southern Power Project Management Board. The PTCs are dependent \naccounting  entities.  Their  expenses  are  allocated  based  on  actual  maintenance  cost,  without \naccounting for the transmitted power capacity or energy. The power project management boards are \nnonproductive entities and their duty is to manage investment projects according to an annual agreed \nplan and budget approved by EVN. The NPT is responsible for covering the expenses of investment \nand operation by itself. \n \n24.  Pricing  and  tariffs.  The  average  tariff  (even  if  it  was  increased  on  1  March  2009  to \n$0.058/kWh from $0.050/kWh) is still low due to the depreciation of the dong. Increases are needed \nfor EVN and its successor companies to retain earnings that are needed for future investment and \nalso to attract foreign investors. The actions on the tariff are part of the power sector reform that is \ncurrently ongoing through various technical assistance projects funded by the \"Six Banks.\"6  \n \n25.  The government intends to retain a uniform national tariff all over the country that means that \nsome cross-subsidy mechanisms between regions will have to be implemented. In addition, a tariff \nregime that is fair, transparent, and predictable is essential to attracting direct investment. Under the \npower sector reform, action on tariffs is a key element and the main issue will be to ensure that the \npoor are protected by maintaining some lifeline tariffs, and at the same time to ensure that the applied \ntariffs effectively reflect the cost of supply.7 By Resolution No.21/2009/QD-TTg of 12 February 2009, \nthe government approved a tariff adjustment mechanism. The tariff will have to be revised annually to \nreflect  the  market  price,  and  the  MOIT  and  the  MOF  will  be  responsible  for  assessing  and \nimplementing such adjustments.  \n \n26.  Network performance. Electrical equipment in a power transmission and distribution network \nare the core assets of a power utility. The development of the network needs to meet both the \nincrease in peak demand and the delivered energy. Failure to do so will result in (i) the overload of \nhigh-voltage equipment, thus creating bottlenecks in the transmission and distribution network; and (ii) \nincreased technical losses. Because of higher transmission and distribution losses, more electricity \nneeds to be generated to meet the same amount of power demand by end-use customers.  \n \n27.  With 14%\u201315% of demand for electricity growth during the past 10 years, and with additional \ngeneration of only 5,300 MW between 2005 and 2008, the transmission and distribution systems in \nViet Nam need urgent reinforcement to remove the current bottlenecks and decrease the technical \nlosses that are inherent in the system due to overloaded transmission and distribution lines and power \ntransformers.  \n \n                                                 \n6  The Six Banks in Viet Nam are the most active commercial banks in terms of official development assistance in Viet Nam: \n(i) the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, (ii) ADB, (iii) Japan International Cooperation Agency, (iv) Korean Export\u2013\nImport Bank, (v) German Development Corporation through KfW, and (vi) the World Bank.  \n7  ADB is involved on a small scale in the determination of the tariffs through the technical assistance project  approved on \n22  December  2008  for  $225,000\u2014ADB.  2008.  Technical  Assistance  for  Capacity  Building  of  the  National  Power \nTransmission Corporation in a Competitive Power Market Environment. Manila (TA 7222-VIE). \n ", "7 \n28.  In addition, in early 2009, the government requested EVN to take over the operation and \nmaintenance of the local distribution units (LDUs) that distribute power on behalf of EVN at the \ncommune level (EVN was asked to take over 7 million consumers in 5,000 communes) due to their \ninefficiency,  high  technical  and  commercial  losses  (about  25%),  and  high  tariff  applied  to  local \nconsumers. Although the tariffs are set at the national level, the retail tariffs at the LDU level are fixed \nby the communes. The LDUs purchase electricity from EVN at the regulated tariff and add on their \ndistribution costs that includes the technical and nontechnical losses plus their return on investment. \nBy taking over operation of these LDUs, EVN has to invest in the modernization and reinforcement of \nthese local distribution systems to meet EVN's technical standards and have in place a uniform tariff \nfor all consumers in the country.  \n \n29.  The proposed project. The proposed project aims to provide EVN the means to access \ncommercial  bank  loans  on  competitive  terms  to  finance  short-term  investments  (2009\u20132011)  in \ntransmission and distribution. The project will include the construction of about 18 kilometers (km) of \n500 kV transmission line, 180 km of 220 kV transmission lines, and 280 km of 110 kV transmission \nlines, and will add 900 MVA of additional transformation capacity at the 500 kV level, 3,080 MVA of \nadditional transformation capacity at the 220 kV level, and 1,807 MVA of additional transformation \ncapacity at the 110 kV level. On the medium- and low-voltage grids, the project will add more than \n200 km of medium- and low-voltage lines and cables and will rehabilitate rural and urban grids. \n \n2.  External Assistance \n \n30.  ADB external assistance has mainly targeted generation and transmission projects rather than \ndistribution and rural electrification that has been the main focus of the World Bank, as explained in \npara. 31.  \n \n31.   The  World  Bank  has  led  the  external  assistance  for  rural  electrification.  The  Rural \nElectrification I project (completed in 2007 with a total investment of $150 million) financed the \nconnection of more than 500,000 households. Rural Electrification II (commenced in 2006 with $200 \nmillion,  supplemented  with  an  additional  $250  million  in  2008)  addressed  strengthening  EVN\u2019s \nmedium-voltage network to support rural electrification, rehabilitating existing low-voltage systems \nowned and operated by LDUs, and developing institutions and participants to ensure service delivery. \nThe Rural Distribution Project (approved in 2008 with $150 million) focused on improving medium-\nvoltage systems (22 kV and 35 kV) and supports the corporate development of EVN. \n \n3.  Lessons  \n \n32.  Between 1995 and 2008, ADB made six public sector loans to the Viet Nam power sector \ncovering distribution, transmission, and generation. There were two private sector loans for two \nseparate gas-fired plants at Phu My, with a total value of $90.0 million and associated guarantees of \n$60.0 million. There were 27 technical assistance projects with a total value of $17.8 million. Ten of \nthese were project preparatory technical assistance to help prepare the design of investment projects. \nSome of the advisory technical assistance projects were designed to address safeguard issues \nthrough  building  capacity  for  environmental  assessment  and  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation, while others assisted in drafting energy conservation law and electricity law, and \npreparing the power sector road map, power design, and capacity building of the ERAV and NPT's \ntransmission tariff formulation and benefit-sharing mechanisms. These technical assistance projects \ncover  a  range  of  activities  including  reform  planning,  power  market  design,  and  promoting  the \ninvolvement of the private sector in particular projects. In addition, ADB has sustained a dialogue with \nthe government and its agencies, and with other development partners, over power sector policy and \nthe reform process.  \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s program of support to the Viet Nam power sector has been, and continues to be, highly \nrelevant to the country\u2019s development goal\u2014reducing poverty through high economic growth. ADB\u2019s \n ", "8 \ncountry and program strategy for 2007\u20132010 identifies the removal of power and other infrastructure \nbottlenecks as a major component of achieving business-led pro-poor economic growth. The various \npublic sector loans which ADB has provided have all been highly relevant to the country\u2019s needs, \nfocusing  on  the  individual  priorities  within  the  sector  at  the  time  the  loans  were  made,  e.g., \ndistribution, transmission, and generation. Similarly, the technical assistance program has been fully \nsupportive  of  the  program  of  sector  reforms  advocated  by  both  government  and  development \npartners.  \n \n34.  ADB's last energy sector project loans used to finance power transmission projects were \napproved in December 2004 and December 2005.8 There have been no problems with counterpart \nfinancing and it is not foreseen as a major issue. Compliance with ADB\u2019s social and environmental \nsafeguards policies and slow processing of contract awards delayed implementation of these projects. \nLengthy procurement, land acquisition, and resettlement has been the main cause of implementation \ndelay of these two projects. The government\u2019s approval process, particularly for procurement, remains \ntime-consuming and has led to project implementation delays. Therefore, the proposed subprojects \nhave been selected on the basis of their readiness (feasibility studies approved, and technical design \nand bidding documents under development) and also on the basis of minimum environmental and \nsocial impacts.  \n \n35.  Earlier ADB technical assistance (attached to loans) concentrated on (i) providing capacity \nbuilding to the power sector, specifically to financial management of EVN\u2019s distribution units; (ii) \nproviding cost-based electricity tariff setting; (iii) commercializing distribution companies; and (iv) \nsetting up a power sector regulatory framework. As a result, the corporate governance of the sector \nhas improved. A technical assistance project on power market design9 is assisting the government in \nmaking strategic decisions regarding (i) the market structure; (ii) role of EVN and its subsidiaries, and \nthe relationship among them; (iii) the nature of the regulatory regime and key regulatory mechanisms; \nand (iv) the terms of power purchase arrangements for new and equitized power plants. Ongoing \ntechnical assistance is concentrating on the computation of transmission charges in the competitive \ngeneration market that is expected to start in January 2010.10 \n \n4.  ADB Sector Experience Strategy and Opportunities \n36.  ADB has approved four ordinary capital resources loanstotaling $1.68 billion and three Asian \n \nDevelopment  Fund  loans 11 totaling  $186.3  million  for  Viet  Nam\u2019s  power  sector.  The  Asian \n \nDevelopment Fund loans were primarily for expansion and rehabilitation of distribution networks in \nurban areas. The two ordinary capital resources loans approved in 2004 and 2005 finance expansion \nof the 500 kV high-voltage transmission systems in northern Viet Nam (footnote 8). More recently, \nADB has focused on power generation. For example, the Mong Duong 1 Thermal Power Project and \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2004.

Through a series of technical assistance projects, ADB has assisted Viet Nam to facilitate \npolicy  reforms,  including  the  new  Electricity  Law,  and  laid  the  framework  for  power  sector \nrestructuring.14 During  2005  and  2006,  ADB  approved  a  series  of  advisory  technical  assistance \n \nprojects to improve the crosscutting social and environmental issues of the power sector, promote \nenergy efficiency in the industry sector, and develop a benefit-sharing mechanism for people affected \nby hydropower projects.  \n \n38.  Socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth is a key pillar of ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy for Viet Nam. The competitiveness of Viet Nam\u2019s economy, especially the industry \nsector, depends on the availability of a cheap and reliable supply of electricity. ADB\u2019s power sector \nstrategy aims to help the government meet the challenge of increasing demand for electricity in a \nfinancially, environmentally, and socially sustainable manner. The large investment requirement of the \npower sector requires concerted efforts from both public and private sector investors. A significant \nproportion of the public sector investments will be financed through multilateral or bilateral financing, \nand ADB will increasingly seek cofinancing from other financiers in the sector. ADB will also assist \npublic sector entities in the sector to access international capital markets by providing advisory and \nrisk-sharing instruments such as guarantee instruments. \n \n39.  This project will be ADB\u2019s first investment in the power subsector in Viet Nam not using a \nconventional lending arrangement. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED GUARANTEE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n40.  The project will support economic growth in Viet Nam and aim to ensure access to a reliable \nsupply of quality electricity to meet the industrial, commercial, and residential consumer demands that \ngrew at a rate of 15% per annum in the decade since 1998. With the financial crisis, the level of \ndemand growth has reduced to 10% in the first 6 months of 2009, but is nonetheless a double-digit \ngrowth rate. With such a growth rate, the country is facing power shortages and lacks investment in \nthe transmission and distribution systems that have led to an increase of technical losses from 10% in \n2007 to 11% in 2008.  \n \n41.  The proposed outcome is in line with the plan of EVN and the government to add at least \nanother 10,000 MW of installed capacity in 2010\u20132011. The project will help the government meet this \ntarget in terms of economic development of the country.

The ADB guarantee will be issued in respect of an up to $342 million loan to be made by \ncertain commercial banks to EVN. The commercial bank loan to EVN will be guaranteed by an MOF \nguarantee. The loan will be used to construct new and upgrade existing 500 kV, 220 kV, and 110 kV \npower transmission lines and associated substations and to expand and upgrade existing medium- \nand low-voltage grids in both rural and urban areas in Viet Nam.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n43.  The ADB guarantee will provide a credit enhancement for the financing of 66 transmission and \ndistribution subprojects that are urgently needed by the National Power Transmission Corporation \n(NPT) and 10 distribution companies (all subsidiaries of EVN). The project scope is summarized \nbelow. The list of the subprojects, their cost estimates, and the disbursement plan is shown in \nSupplementary Appendix I. The details of the subprojects for the 11 EVN subsidiaries are provided as \nSupplementary Appendix K. \n \n(i)  NPT requested financing for 14 subprojects that will add about 18km and 268 km of \n500 kV and 220 kV transmission lines respectively, and 500 kV and 220 kV substations \nwith total capacity of 3,400 MVA for an estimated cost of $239 million, out of which \n$143 million will be from the ADB-guaranteed loan. \n(ii)  Regional Power Company No. 1 (PC1) requested financing for 12 subprojects that will \nconstruct about 59 km of 110 kV transmission lines, and will add additional transformer \ncapacity of 373 MVA in the 110 kV substations.

The ADB guarantee would be the second guarantee issued by ADB in Viet Nam, but the first \nissued on a sovereign basis. The EVN structure guarantee is shown in Figure 2 below.  \n \n \n                   Figure 2: EVN Guarantee Structure \n \n \n  Subborrower\n \n \n \n    EVN Finance Corporation      EVN \n \n \n \nGOV/MOF   Banks\n \n \n  ADB \n \n   \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank, EVN = Viet Nam Electricity, GOV = Government of Viet \n  Nam, MOF = Ministry of Finance.  \n    Sour ce:ADB.\n \nD.  Guarantee Plan \n \n45.  A syndicate of foreign commercial banks is arranging a 13-year, $342 million loan to EVN. The \nMOF, on behalf of the Government of Viet Nam, will issue a guarantee to the commercial banks \nguaranteeing EVN's payment obligations under the commercial banks' loan. The commercial banks \nhave requested a guarantee from ADB to cover the risk of nonpayment under the MOF guarantee. \nADB  proposes  to  issue  a  guarantee  to  the  commercial  banks  guaranteeing  the  Government's \npayment obligations under the MOF guarantee corresponding to $325 million of principal (i.e. 95% of \nthe $342 million loan amount), plus interest payable by EVN under the commercial banks\u2019 loan.  \nADB\u2019s maximum aggregate liability under the ADB guarantee will not exceed $500 million.  The tenor \nof the proposed ADB guarantee would match the maturity of the commercial banks\u2019 loan to EVN. \n ", "12 \nADB\u2019s obligation to pay the commercial banks under the ADB guarantee will arise in the event ADB \ndetermines that the Government has breached its payment obligations under the MOF guarantee. \nThe ADB guarantee will be issued on the conditions that the MOF guarantee has been duly executed \nby both MOF, on behalf of the Government, and by Vietnam and ADB\u2019s standard sovereign indemnity \nprovisions  (e.g.,  cross-default,  negative  pledge,  and  indemnity)  are  incorporated  into  the  MOF \nguarantee, thereby obligating Viet Nam to reimburse ADB for all amounts ADB pays the commercial \nbanks pursuant to the ADB guarantee. The guaranteed loan structure is provided in Table 1 and the \nProject financing plan in Table 2. \n \nTable 1: Guaranteed Loan Structure \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n47.  EVN will be the executing agency of the Project and responsible for the overall technical \nimplementation of the Project. EVN has designated the International Relation Department-IDC at \nEVN\u2019s headquarters to directly interface with ADB and other entities involved in the implementation \nof the Project.  \n \n48.  EVN  will,  within  three  months  after  effectiveness  of  the  guarantee,  appoint  EVN  finance \ncorporation (EVN FC) to assume the role of the project management unit (PMU) and oversee the \noverall  implementation  of  the  Project,  including  ensuring  that  the  Project  is  implemented  in \naccordance with ADB's policies and procedures. \n \n ", "13 \n49.  Similarly, in each of the 11 subsidiaries, a project implementation unit (PIU), if not yet existing, \nwill  be  established  and  headed  by  the  respective  regional  general  manager.  The  PIUs  will  be \nresponsible for implementing and coordinating all local activities including reporting to headquarters \nand overseeing the implementation of the civil works and social and environmental safeguards related \nto the project. Insofar as it relates to the activities of the PIU, each regional general manager will \nreport to EVN finance corporation as the PMU. \n \n50.  Each of the 11 PIUs will prepare a quarterly report on the progress of the implementation of \nthe subprojects and submit them to the IDC who will then forward them to ADB. The quarterly reports \nwill include information on the progress of the procurement activities and provide data to demonstrate \nthat the procurement activities under the project have been conducted in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). In addition, ADB and EVN will \nconduct  semiannual  review  missions,  in  which  ADB  will  review  and  conduct  due  diligence  on \nprocurement and safeguards on some subprojects to be randomly selected. Commercial banks will be \ninvited to join these semiannual reviews. \n \n51.  Once a year a tripartite meeting will take place with EVN, the commercial banks, and ADB to \nreview the progress of the works.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n52.   The  guaranteed  loan  is  expected  to  be  disbursed  by  between  the  end  of  2009  and  31 \nDecember 2012, as shown in Table 3. \n \nTable 3: Disbursement Schedule \n \n    Cost  Guaranteed  Disbursement \nNo.  Agency  Estimate  Loan  ($ million) \n   ($ million)  ($ million)  2010  2011  2012 \n1  National Power Transmission Corporation  238.89  143.20  9.29  75.11  58.80 \n2  Power Company No. 1  172.94  94.55  87.55  7.00   \n3  Power Company No. 2  12.60  10.71  2.14  8.57   \n4  Ha Noi Power Company  39.27  33.38  3.47  29.91   \n5  Hai Duong Power Company  8.24  6.41  4.80  1.61   \n6  Ninh Binh Power Company  2.33  2.21  1.11  1.11   \n7  Hai Phong Power Company  26.25  19.69  2.10  17.59   \n8  Da Nang Power Company  4.73  3.79  0.49  3.30   \n9  Khan Hoa Power Company  5.00  3.50  3.50  -   \n10  Dong Nai Power Company  7.10  5.50  3.16  2.34   \n11  Ho Chi Minh Power Company   26.43  19.07  -  19.07   \n  Total  543.77  342.00  117.62  165.58  58.80 \nSource: Viet Nam Electricity.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n53.  EVN will issue tenders using international competitive bidding procedures, national competitive \nbidding,  and  direct  contracting  for  compatibility  of  computerized  control  systems  in  existing \nsubstations and to procure the distribution and transmission equipment and proprietary equipment \nsuch as additional line and transformer bays in existing gas-insulated substations. In accordance with \nthe Article 3.16 of ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), ADB will \nconduct post-review of the procurement process to ensure (i) the need for economy and efficiency, \nincluding procurement of the goods and works involved; (ii) all eligible bidders from developed and \ndeveloping countries are given the same information and equal opportunity to compete in providing \ngoods  and  works;  and  (iii)  there  is  transparency  in  the  procurement  process.  A  preliminary \nprocurement assessment of the 11 subsidiaries shows that all subsidiaries have already worked \nunder ADB or under the World Bank procurement guidelines and are reasonably familiar with their \nprocurement processes.  \n ", "14 \n \n4.  Stakeholder Participation and Consultation \n \n54.  High-level and working-level consultations will be held by ADB and/or by the TA consultant \nwith EVN on a regular basis to ensure implementation of social and environmental safeguard plans, \nincluding regular meetings with commercial banks on loan disbursements. EVN will be required to \nrecruit an independent monitoring agency, within three months after effectiveness of the guarantee to \nmonitor the implementation of safeguards plans and provide quarterly progress reports during the \nimplementation of the project. \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n55.  EVN subsidiaries will prepare and maintain separate accounts for project-related expenditures. \nEVN finance corporation as the PMU will consolidate and review such accounts and, after auditing, \nsubmit  the  same  to  ADB.  Project  accounts  will  be  audited  annually  by  an  independent  auditor \nacceptable to ADB. The audited accounts and related financial statements together with the audit \nreport will be submitted to ADB no later than 6 months following the close of the fiscal year to which \nthey relate. \n \n56.  EVN will maintain a (i) self financing ratio of 25% or above, (ii) debt service coverage ratio of \n1.5 or above, and (iii) long-term debt-equity ratio of at least 70:30 or less. EVN will (i) maintain an \ninternal audit function to undertake timely audit of project accounts in accordance with generally \naccepted accounting principles; (ii) maintain separate accounts for the Project, including the financing \nprovided by EVN; and (iii) provide monthly progress reports, annual audited project accounts, and \nconsolidated audited accounts of EVN. \n \n57.  The  EVN  finance  corporation,  as  the  PMU,  will  prepare  quarterly  financial  and  physical \nprogress reports and submit these to ADB. The monthly reports are to be submitted not later than 1 \nmonth following the end of the quarter to which they relate. Within 3 months of project completion, the \nPIU will submit to ADB a project completion report. \n \n6.  Clean Development Mechanism Credits \n \n58.  By decreasing technical losses of the transmission and distribution systems in Viet Nam, the \nproject has good chances to be eligible for carbon credit revenues. Assessment and development of \nthe corresponding documentation will be explored during project implementation. \n \nG.  Financial Performance of Viet Nam Electricity \n59.  Based on EVN's audited financial statements of 2006\u20132008, EVN's financial performance \nduring the last 3 years was analyzed. EVN's profit after tax increased from D2.26 trillion in 2006 to \nD3.34 trillion in 2007, but decreased to D1.29 trillion in 2008. This is due mainly to high domestic \nborrowing costs and high fuel costs in 2008. In addition to these high costs, in 2008 EVN incurred a \nlarge foreign exchange loss due to depreciation of the dong against the dollar and yen. \n \n60.  In the longer term, EVN's challenge will be to maintain its financial strength given the high \ninvestment requirement in the power sector. Electricity demand was affected by the global economic \ncrisis, and demand growth slowed in 2008\u20132009. However, the demand for electricity is expected to \ncontinue to grow strongly after 2010 as Viet Nam continues its industrialization and modernization of \nits economy. EVN's total investment requirement for 2009\u20132015 is $20.56 billion (60.7% of which will \nbe invested in generation, 22.3% in transmission, and the remainder in distribution). \n \n ", "15 \n61.  Cognizant of this challenge, the government has taken several measures to assist EVN to \nstrengthen its financial performance. One important measure was the tariff increase effective 1 March \n2009,15 when the retail tariff was increased on average by 8.9%. The adjusted average tariff is \nD950/kWh. More importantly, the decision allows for future annual tariff adjustments based on market \nconditions. The Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry and Trade are responsible for issuing \nguidelines for tariff adjustment in the future. This tariff adjustment process will be implemented starting \nin 2010. Another measure to assist EVN to strengthen its financial status is the approval by the \ngovernment for EVN to increase its capital. Currently EVN's aggregate capital is D64 trillion. In June \n2009, the government approved a plan for EVN to increase its capital to D110 trillion in 2010, and \nEVN is working on appropriate measures to achieve this. With increased capital, EVN will be able to \nmobilize more resources while maintaining the debt\u2013equity ratio. Detailed analysis of the power \nsubsector is in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n62.  A $720,000 advisory technical assistance project will be provided to ensure compliance with \nADB's requirements in terms of procurement and environmental and social safeguards policies. The \ntechnical assistance will be financed through the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-others, \n$600,000). EVN and its subsidiaries will provide $120,000 in-kind (office space and counterpart staff \nremuneration and per diem). EVN will be the executing agency for the technical assistance and its \nsubsidiaries will be the implementing agencies. The technical assistance consultants will be selected \nand engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). The disbursement will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.16 The technical assistance is expected to commence in January \n2010 and finish in December 2013. Detailed description of the technical assistance is provided in \nSupplementary Appendix H. Outline terms of reference for consultants are provided in Appendix 8. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Project Justification \n63.  In addition to filling a funding gap for EVN at a time when commercial lending in Viet Nam has \ndiminished considerably due to the global financial crisis, the commercial banks have indicated that \nthey would be unwilling to make a long-tenor loan to EVN without a credit enhancement by ADB. \nFurther, as a large proportion of the equipment (about 80%) is being sourced within Viet Nam, the \ncommercial banks cannot insure a significant portion of EVN's payment risk with an export credit \nagency. Hence, without ADB involvement, private political risk insurers might be willing to provide \ninsurance on terms and conditions that would probably not be acceptable to EVN. Therefore ADB's \ninvolvement in the project is essential.  \n   \n64.  ADB's guarantee will help reduce EVN\u2019s cost of borrowing and increase the tenor of the loan. \nHence, relying on ADB\u2019s AAA credit rating, the commercial banks will provide a longer tenor loan then \nthey normally would for this type of project and they will also reduce their margin based on ADB\u2019s \ncredit rating. Finally, ADB's involvement in the project will also encourage private insurers to provide \ninsurance for that portion of the loan not guaranteed by ADB, on more competitive terms and at a \nlower cost to EVN, further reducing EVN\u2019s cost of funding. \n \n65.  Providing a guarantee to a commercial bank is in line with ADB\u2019s operational strategy to \npromote private sector participation in infrastructure development as well as offer guarantee products \n                                                 \n15  PM decision No. 21/2009/QD-TTg. \n16  Asian Development Bank. 2007. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila \n ", "16 \nfor sovereign projects. ADB also encourages risk participation with other guarantors and insurers, \nboth public and private.  \n \n66.  All proposed subprojects are included in the National Power Master Plan No. VI which was \napproved by the government in 2006. The financial assessment of subprojects is conducted by \nestimating the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and the financial internal rate of return (FIRR). \nFeasibility studies under this guarantee program are prepared by subsidiaries of EVN in accordance \nwith the government regulation. The government decree17 provides the guideline for the preparation \nof feasibility studies. Appendix 7 explains the government guidelines and criteria for the feasibility \nstudy of subprojects, and show economic and financial assessments, prepared by EVN staff, of the \n220 kV Trang Bang\u2013Tay Ninh transmission line subproject as a case model. The EIRR is 34.2% and \nthe FIRR is 17.5%, compared with the project weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 10.45%. \nSensitivity analysis indicates that both the EIRR and FIRR will exceed the WACC under the event of \ncost overrun of 10% and 20%. Given the overall objectives of the subproject, the economic and \nfinancial performance is deemed acceptable, and the subproject is considered financially viable and \nsustainable. For consistency purposes in undertaking such analysis for the other subprojects, a \nmethodology has been developed for the use of EVN's staff and is provided as Supplementary \nAppendix I.   \n \nB.  Environmental and Social Safeguards \n \n1.  Resettlement  \n \n67.   Based on the available technical designs for the 66 proposed subprojects, it is expected that \n32 will not require land acquisition. These are not expected to require land acquisition due to their \nsmall scale, location within existing corridors and rights of way, technical capability to avoid impacts, \nlocation within public land (roads, etc.) or on land specifically identified and reserved for the purpose. \nThese  projects  have  been  categorized  as  follows:  (i)  extension  of  transformation  capacity  or \nupgrading of existing substations (9 subprojects), (ii) rehabilitation and upgrading of existing rural \ngrids (5 subprojects), (iii) rehabilitation or upgrading of urban overhead lines (2 subprojects), (iv) \ninstallation  of  underground  cables  under  sidewalks  or  in  the  streets  (3  subprojects);  (v)  new \nsubstations to be constructed within existing industrial zones (10 subprojects); or (vi) new substations \nto be constructed on land vacated by former state enterprises (3 subprojects). It is acknowledged that, \nalthough the probability of resettlement impacts are low with these types of projects, if land acquisition \nand  resettlement  impacts  are  unavoidable,  resettlement  plans  would  need  to  be  prepared  in \naccordance with the approved resettlement framework. \n \n68.  For  the  remaining  34  subprojects,  some,  marginal  resettlement  impacts  are  expected. \nAccording to the available technical designs, the development of the proposed new substations (21 \nsubproject), transmission lines (12 subprojects), and the development of rural grids (1 subprojects) \nwill require an aggregate amount of about 60.4 hectares (ha) of land and has the potential to impact \n1,800\u20131,900 households. ADB due diligence has found power companies and their consultants have \nworked in close cooperation with local authorities from a very early stage of project preparation to \navoid, or at least minimize, the acquisition of land and the negative impacts on assets and livelihoods \nof  local  communities.  During  the  selection  of  sites  for  new  substations  and  the  design  of  new \ndistribution and transmission line routes, priority was given to land which has a low economic value \nand which is not used for residential or livelihood purposes. Site locations are proposed on public or \ncollective unit lands wherever possible to avoid impacts on privately owned or used lands. In addition, \nthe technical designs proposed attempt to minimize the impact by recommending the use of low-\nimpact technology such as gas-insulated substations (GISs), the use of steel poles instead of lattice \ntowers, and the use of underground cables. \n                                                 \n17  Decree No.12/2009/ND-CP of February 12 2009 on management of investment projects on the construction of works. \n ", "17 \n \n69.  Despite the design attempts to avoid resettlement impacts, some unavoidable impacts will be \ncreated on agricultural land (in low land), forest (in upland areas), unused public land, and/or public \ndomains. A small amount of residential land (some with houses or secondary structures) may be \naffected by the rights of way of the transmission lines. In addition to these potential impacts on \nresidential land, some project-affected people may experience severe impacts created by the loss of \nmore than 10% of their productive agricultural landholding. The precise number of affected people \nand  severely  affected  people  will  only  be  known  when  the  detailed  technical  designs  and \nmeasurement  surveys  are  completed.  However,  based  on  available  information,  no  proposed \nsubprojects are expected to create significant resettlement impacts as defined by ADB's Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). All proposed subprojects involving involuntary resettlement are classified \nas category B and will require short resettlement plans that will be submitted to ADB for review and \nclearance before the civil works can start. \n \n70.   Two core subprojects (Le Thien 110 kV substation and the Tien Lang 110 kV transmission \nline project) have been fully appraised, including the preparation of resettlement plans and initial \nenvironmental examinations. This documentation has been prepared to meet the requirements of the \nresettlement framework and the environmental assessment and review framework which have been \nprepared for the project. \n \n71.  The  summary  of  the  resettlement  framework  is  provided  in  Appendix  6  and  the  full \nresettlement framework is provided as Supplementary Appendix A, The resettlement plans for the two \ncore  subprojects  are  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B  and  the  due  diligence  report  on \nresettlement for six subprojects for which land acquisition and resettlement has been completed is \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n2.  Environmental Impact  \n \n72.  The transmission and distribution project will have 66 subprojects located in 30 provinces in \nViet Nam. The subprojects comprise (i) constructing new transmission conventional substations; (ii) \nrehabilitating, upgrading, and extending 500 kV, 220 kV, and 110 kV conventional substations; (iii) \nconstructing new GISs; (iv) extending existing GISs; (v) constructing new distribution lines and 220 \nkV and 110 kV overhead transmission lines; (vi) installing underground cables; and (vii) rehabilitating \nurban and rural distribution networks or grids. The initial environmental examination (IEE) prepared \nfor  the  project  covers  subprojects  with  available  feasibility  studies,  while  an  environmental \nassessment and review framework has been prepared for subprojects where the location, alignment, \nand components are still uncertain. An initial environmental examination (IEE); review framework; and \ninitial environmental examinations have been prepared for representative subprojects. In addition one \ndue diligence report has been prepared for a completed subproject. \n \n73.  None of the subprojects will be in ecologically or culturally sensitive sites. Affected areas are \nprimarily agricultural land planted to rice and various crops as well as tree plantations (acacia, rubber \ntrees, eucalyptus), land in urban areas, or idle plots. For the transmission route in Song May\u2013Uyen \nHung (in the provinces of Dong Nai and Binh Duong), some mature trees will need to be removed as \nthe  alignment  will  pass  through  acacia  and  rubber  tree  plantations.  The  other  high-voltage \ntransmission line routes will involve cutting of small diameter trees and will mainly traverse agricultural \nland. Underground cables will be installed following road alignments in urban areas. The land required \nfor each new conventional substation is estimated as follows: (i) 500 kV substation, 12 ha; (ii) 220 kV \nsubstation, 0.9\u20133.6 ha; and (iii) 110 kV substation, 0.24\u20130.76 ha. The land requirement for new GISs \nwill be 0.1\u20130.3 ha each. The total area for all new substations will be a maximum of about 46 ha. \nAcquisition of land for extending existing conventional substations and constructing GISs will not be \nrequired  as  this  will  be  within  existing  EVN  substation  areas.  Additional  land,  which  will  be  a \ncombination of privately owned and public land, may be acquired for access roads. \n \n ", "18 \n74.  For installation of underground cables, only temporary impacts are expected to occur during \nthe construction phase. Methods to be adopted for installation of underground cables will be either \nboring  (across  road  intersections  and  very  narrow  streets)  or  by  trenching  (dig  and  fill).  The \nunderground cables will be installed 1.0\u20132.5 meters (m) below ground level. The excavation width for \ntrenching is 1.5 m and, depending on the decision of the local government, this will be undertaken \neither on the road carriageway or on the sidewalk. The underground cable subprojects are located in \nurban areas. Rehabilitation of medium- and low-voltage grids in urban and rural areas are expected to \ncause only minor impacts during site works. Activities will include reconductoring of existing electric \npoles as well as installation of additional wooden poles on agricultural fields, public land, and along \nthe roads. Earthworks, dust emission, and dust generation will be minimal during pole installation \nsince excavation will be done manually over a small area of only 1 square meter (m2) per pole.  \n \n75.  The  environmental  assessment  has  identified  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the \nimplementation of the various subprojects. Such impacts pertain to dust emission, noise generation, \nsiltation of nearby surface water bodies due to surface run-off, spill or leak of hazardous substances \nsuch as fuel and oil, clearing of vegetation (particularly for installation of high-voltage transmission \nlines), and traffic congestion. Predicted impacts will be largely experienced during the construction \nphase  and  are  considered  temporary.  The  environmental  assessment  includes  environmental \nmitigation  measures,  and  corresponding  monitoring  activities  and  institutional  responsibilities  to \nensure that impacts are reduced to acceptable levels. The summary IEE is provided in Supplementary \nAppendix L, the IEEs for the two core subprojects are provided in Supplementary Appendix D, and the \nenvironmental assessment and review framework is provided in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n3.  Social Impact \n \n76.  The  social  assessment  in  the  project  areas  show  that  electricity  problems,  shortage  of \nelectricity, unreliable power voltage, and power cuts have implications for industry, business, home \nindustry, health, and education facilities. Viet Nam is shifting away from a centrally planned economy \nto  a  more  market-oriented  economy.  Industries,  services,  and  businesses  are  booming.  In  the \nsubproject areas, there are many small businesses such as restaurants, cafes, karaoke bars, and \nfood  processing  plants,  and  these  business  activities  are  a  major  source  of  income  for  local \nentrepreneurs. However, these businesses require large amounts of reliable and stable power, and \npower  cuts  and  voltage  fluctuation  have  significant  negative  impacts  on  local  businesses.  For \nexample, in Nam Sach district, a food processing plant (soy curd) can lose D5 million a night due to \npower cuts. Some entrepreneurs use generators for their businesses but most of them does own \ngenerators and are suffering of production losses. Farmers use electric water pumps for irrigation. \nHowever, due to unstable and insufficient power supply, they sometimes use diesel-powered water \npumps which cost three times as much to run. Big enterprises such as in the shrimp industry can lose \nseveral thousand dollars a day due to power cuts. Workers can also lose income due to power cuts. \nIn the subproject areas there are 21 industrial zones in food processing, shipping, coal exploitation, \ngarment industries, etc. Although these industrial sites have private power lines, breakdowns due to \noverloading and old cables result in power cuts 5\u20137 days a month. Some big industries have to buy-\nhigh volume power generators, and in some cases garment factories have to replace automatic \nmachines  with  manual  ones.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  outlined  in \nAppendix 5.  \n \n77.  Electrical  power  supply  is  usually  cut  off  during  the  hot  periods  in  summer.  In  addition, \nelectricity quality is not stable and reliable. Due to inadequate electric supply, domestic equipment \nsuch as TVs, cooking stoves, and electric lamps can not be operated. Because of power cuts and \ninsufficient power, clean water factories in some communes and wards in Hai Duong province are not \nworking. As a result, 80% of households do not have clean water. Women bear the burden of \nelectricity  problems.  Instead  of  using  electricity  for  cooking,  they  have  to  use  firewood,  straw, \ncharcoal, or dried leaves. The commune leaders advised that, during power cuts, around 70%\u201380% of \n ", "19 \nthe population have no fresh water, and water must be carried by shoulder poles from public wells\u2014a \nburden which is generally taken up by women. \n \n78.  In recent years, with the economic development the health facilities have been equipped with \nmodern amenities. The inadequate electrical power supply causes difficulties in medical practices \nsuch as medical checks, surgery, preservation of medicine, etc. In some project areas, such as Tien \nLang, Hai Phong, because there are power cuts for 7\u201310 days in a month, diesel-power generators \nwere  bought,  which  increases  the  cost  of  providing  medical  services.  Despite  the  government \nattempts to invest in more human resources, medications, and facilities in hospitals, medical centers, \nand clinics in the rural areas, rural people still have go to provincial hospitals because of poor power \nsupply in the rural health centers. This has resulted in more pressure on hospitals and health facilities \nat the provincial level. The power cuts in schools and colleges disturb laboratory work for the students \nand the teaching process, and affect the quality of learning.  \n \n79.  At an individual level, low-quality power supply introduces some extra cost for middle-income \nconsumers, as the life span of electric appliances is reduced. The investments for construction of new \n220 kV and 110 kV substations and upgrading and rehabilitating the rural grid network will facilitate \nadequate  and  reliable  electricity  supply  for  individual  customers,  industries,  businesses,  public \nfacilities, etc. The supply of adequate and reliable electricity will increase business opportunities for \nmanufacturing and hotels, and will provide employment opportunities. The negative impact of the \nproject relates to resettlement activities such as land acquisition. The resettlement plan includes \nmitigation measures for the affected people. \n \n80.  Ethnic minority groups such as Khmers, K\u2019ho, Chu ru, Tay, and Nung live in the areas of the \nDuc Trong 220 kV substation and its connecting lines as well as near the Tra Vinh 220 kV substation \nand the Dai Tu 110 kV transmission line. The ethnic minority groups are integrated into mainstream \nsociety, and so the resettlement impacts on ethnic minority groups are no different than for the main \nKinh ethnic group. To ensure that ethnic minority people will not be marginalized during the process of \nresettlement, ethnic minority-specific action is included in the resettlement framework. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n81.  The primary risks of the ADB guarantee are (i) the credit risk of EVN, (ii) foreign exchange \nrisks, and (iii) the ability of the Government to honor its obligations to the commercial banks under the \nMOF guarantee. EVN\u2019s failure to pay under the commercial banks\u2019 loan could trigger a call on the \nMOF guarantee, which could result in a demand under the ADB guarantee. These risks will be \nmitigated by (i) the sovereign indemnity provisions in the MOF guarantee that will obligate Viet Nam to \nreimburse ADB for payments ADB makes to the commercial banks\u2019 pursuant to the ADB guarantee, \nand (ii) the annual revision of the tariffs that will reflect changes in both fuel costs and local inflation. In \naddition,  in  March  2009,  Viet  Nam  introduced  an  annual  tariff  adjustment  under  the  proposed \ncompetitive power generation market, which will also mitigate some of the risks to the project. \n \n82.  Risks  for  Viet  Nam  Electricity  and  its  subsidiaries. This project involves conventional \ntechnology  and  EVN  and  its  subsidiaries  have  all  the  necessary  technical  skills  to  design  and \nimplement the transmission systems. The suppliers of equipment will be selected in a competitive \nmanner from among ADB's member countries, which from experience includes European and Asian \nmanufacturers. The proposed project is considered sound and capable of withstanding changes in \nmajor parameters. Institutional risks are not considered significant as EVN has a comprehensive \norganizational structure at its central headquarters and branch offices in main cities in Viet Nam. In \nmany ways, EVN is a well-run utility. Its operating costs are low, transmission and distribution losses \nare reasonable, and revenue collection is good. The due diligence conducted in the 11 subsidiaries \nshows that all of them have experience with multilateral and bilateral institutions such as ADB, \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, Japan International Cooperation Agency, or the World Bank, \nand thus are familiar with the concept of competitive bidding. \n ", "20 \n \n83.  EVN's tariff revenues are in dong whilst the loan from the commercial banks will be in foreign \ncurrencies, thus creating a currency mismatch. This can be seen as a risk, especially in light of EVN\u2019s \nexperience in FY2008 where currency mismatch caused EVN to breach its financial covenants under \nits existing loans. However, due to the adoption of resolution No. 272 of February 2009, tariffs will be \nrevised annually and adjusted to the current economic situation. In addition, the introduction of a \ngeneration competitive market in 2010 and of a retail competitive market later on can be seen as a \nstabilization factor in the medium-to-long term. \n \n84.  Economic stability. The debt sustainability analysis carried out by the International Monetary \nFund and the World Bank in February 2009 shows that Viet Nam remains at low risk of debt distress \ndespite the recent deterioration in its economic conditions and the global downturn. All external debt \nsustainability indicators are projected to remain well below the applicable debts threshold. Total public \ndebt, however, is expected to be adversely affected by the ongoing global downturn. Public debt will \nalso be affected by the government stimulus plan to mitigate the economic slowdown. However, \nprovided the package is prudently financed, the burden of public debt could be manageable. \n \nD.  Anticorruption  Policy,  and  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n \n85.  The  commercial  banks  and  EVN  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) and the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy \n(2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nwill require the commercial banks' and EVN to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures \nand controls following international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or \nmoney laundering activities or the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to refrain from \nengaging in such activities. The financing documentation between ADB and the commercial banks \nand between the commercial banks and EVN will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or \npotential violation of these undertakings. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n86.  EVN  will  give  the  following  assurances,  which  will  be  incorporated  into  the  legal \ndocumentation: \n \n(i)  EVN  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  and  the  Combating  Money \nLaundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy. EVN will (a) acknowledge ADB\u2019s \nright  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent, \ncollusive, or coercive practices relating to the project; (b) agree to cooperate fully with \nany such investigation and to extend all necessary assistance, including providing \naccess to all relevant books and records, as may be necessary for the satisfactory \ncompletion of any such investigation; and (c) agree to refrain from engaging in money \nlaundering activities or financing of terrorism and shall allow ADB to investigate any \nviolation or potential violation of these undertakings.  \n(ii)  EVN will (a) construct and operate the Project in accordance with the IEE approved by \nADB, (b) comply with the environmental laws and regulations of the Government, and \n(c)  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  In  the  case  of  discrepancies \nbetween  the  requirements  under  the  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment and ADB's Environment Policy, EVN will comply with ADB's Environment \nPolicy. \n(iii)  EVN will ensure that any involuntary resettlement will be carried out in accordance with \nthe agreed resettlement plan, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and the \n ", "21 \nrelevant  laws  on  involuntary  resettlement  of  the  Government.  In  the  case  of \ndiscrepancies  between  the  requirements  under  the  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment on involuntary resettlement with ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy, \nEVN will comply with ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy. \n(iv)  EVN will ensure that implementation of ethnic-minority-specific action included in the \nresettlement plan and resettlement framework is in accordance with the applicable \nlaws and regulations of the Government and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples \n(1998).  \n(v)  EVN will ensure that all works contracts under the Project incorporate provisions and \nbudgets to the effect that contractors (a) comply with the applicable labor laws of the \nGovernment and related international treaty obligations and do not employ child labor; \n(b) provide safe working conditions and water and separate sanitation facilities for male \nand female workers in the construction camps and in the construction sites; (c) provide \nequal wages to male and female workers for work of equal value; (d) provide child day \ncare services for female construction workers; (e) recruit local labor for construction \nwork; and (f) undertake HIV/AIDS and human-trafficking education and awareness \ncampaigns  in  the  construction  camps,  other  risk  groups  and  villages,  and  in  the \nconstructions sites, labor camps, and surrounding villages.  \n(vi)  EVN  will  ensure  that  the  gender  strategy  provided  in  the  resettlement  plan  is \nundertaken  to  minimize  adverse  resettlement-related  impacts,  including  the \nundertaking of the following specific actions: (a) a separate consultation meeting will be \nheld to disclose the resettlement plan, (b) replacement land will be registered in the \nnames of both husband and wife in cases where land acquisition has taken place, (c) \ncompensation money will be paid to both husband and wife, and (d) women will be \nconsulted in planning and training for income restoration programs. \n \nB.  Conditions for Guarantee Effectiveness \n \n87.  The ADB guarantee will become effective upon the execution and delivery by MOF, on behalf \nof the Government of Viet Nam, and Viet Nam of the MOF guarantee, which will incorporate the MOF \nguarantee and the sovereign counter-indemnity provisions, all to the satisfaction of ADB. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n88.  I am satisfied that the proposed ADB guarantee would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the guarantee of up to \n$500,000,000 covering certain payment obligations of the Ministry of Finance of the Government of \nViet  Nam  under  a  guarantee  issued  in  connection  with commercial  loans  to  EVN  under  EVN\u2019s \nInvestment Support Program, where ADB's obligations under the guarantee will, in turn, be counter-\nindemnified  by  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam;  and  on  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in this report as presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n20 November 2009\n ", "22  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n    Data Sources /   \nDesign  Performance  Reporting  Assumptions and \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact    Assumption \nAdequate, reliable,  Enhance energy efficiency by  National electricity  More investments made not \nand improved  reducing transmission losses  statistics  only in generation but also in \nquality of electricity  below 10% level in Viet Nam  transmission and distribution \nsupply to meet  by 2012. \nindustrial,   \ncommercial, and  100% of households  Delay in the implementation of \nresidential  connected to electricity by  the competitive power market \nconsumer demands  2018 \nOutcome  Assumption \nIncreased  Regional Power Company  Annual reports of EVN  Efficient operation and \ntransmission and  No. 1 (PC1) Losses decreases    maintenance of new facilities \ndistribution grids  from 8% in 2008 to 7.4% in  EVN and Power  New power generation will be \ncapacity   2010 and 7.3% in 2011.

Introduction \n  \n1.  The past and projected financial statements of Viet Nam Electricity (EVN) have been \nprepared. The financial results are for the 3 years 2006\u20132008, and are based on audited financial \nstatements. The projected financial statements for 2009\u20132015 are prepared in current terms. \n \n2.  As at 31 December 2008, the aggregate capital of EVN was D64 trillion. In June 2009, the \ngovernment approved to increase EVN's capital to D110 trillion, with a revaluation of existing \nassets.  EVN  has  39  subsidiaries  and  20  dependent  units  (power  plants,  power  project \nmanagement boards, and centers).  \n \nB.  Financial Performance of Viet Nam Electricity \n \n3.  FY2008 results. The financial performance of EVN in 2006\u20132008 is summarized in Table \nA2.1. In 2008, EVN's profit after tax decreased from D3,336 billion in 2006 to D1,287 billion in 2008 \nmainly due to high fuel costs and high domestic borrowing costs. As a result, EVN did not meet \nfinancial covenants relating to the self-financing ratio (25% minimum) and debt service coverage \nratio (1.5 minimum). Long-term debt has increased from 54% to 65%, which is close to the \ncovenant ceiling of 70%. \n \nTable A2.1: Past Financial Performance of EVN \n(D billion) \n \nItem  2006  2007  2008 \nIncome Statement          \n   Revenues      44,917       58,106       64,656  \n      Cost of sales    (37,256)    (48,328)    (55,654) \n      Gross profit from sales        7,661         9,778         9,002  \n         Financial expenses      (2,537)      (3,477)      (4,856) \n         Selling expenses      (1,307)      (1,758)      (1,961) \n         Administration expenses      (2,111)      (2,568)      (2,555) \n      Net profit from operations        2,462         3,354         1,384  \n      Profit before tax        2,606         4,217         1,536  \n      Corporate income tax         (365)      (1,112)         (511) \n   Profit After Tax        2,256         3,336         1,287  \n                    \nBalance Sheet          \n      Current assets      39,723       49,814       47,643  \n      Noncurrent assets      98,059     135,097     157,379  \n         Fixed assets      96,074     129,201     149,130  \n         Long-term investments           861         3,170         5,331  \n   Total Assets    137,783     184,910     205,022  \n      Liabilities      83,335     106,904     136,545  \n         Current liabilities      19,602       25,601       25,649  \n         Long-term liabilities      63,733       81,302     110,897  \n      Equity      54,447       78,007       64,160  \n   Total Liabilities and Equity    137,783     184,910     205,022  \n                    \nFinancial Ratio Covenants          \n   Self-financing ratio  19.8%  44.1%  15.5% \n   DSCR  2.13  1.86  1.37 \n   Debt to equity ratio  57:43  54:46  65:35 \n       ( ) = negative, DSCR = debt service coverage ratio, EVN = Viet Nam Electricity. \n             Source: Viet Nam Electricity. \n \n4.

However, demand for electricity \nis expected to continue to grow strongly in the coming years. It is expected that electricity demand \nwill increase by 10% in 2009.

Capital expenditure requirements. Despite increased participation in the power industry \nby private investors, EVN anticipates considerable capital expenditure in the coming years. During \n2009\u20132013, EVN plans to invest approximately $20.5 billion, with power generation accounting for \n60.7% of that planned investment and power transmission accounting for 22.3%. \n \nTable A2.3: Viet Nam Electricity's Capital Expenditure Plan, 2009\u20132013 \n($ million) \n \nItem   2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  Total \nGeneration   1,434  2,985  2,841  2,380  2,855  12,495 \nTransmission   348  886  1,144  1,170  1,044  4,592 \nDistribution   300  560  547  576  604  2,587 \nOthers   280  167  165  148  133  892 \nTotal   2,362  4,597  4,697  4,274  4,636  20,565 \nSource: Viet Nam Electricity. \n \n6.  Tariff adjustment. By decision No. 21/2009/Q\u0110-TTg of the government with effect from 1 \nMarch 2009, the electricity retail tariff was increased by, on average, 8.92% as compared to the \ntariff for 2008. The adjusted average tariff is D948.5/kilowatt-hour (kWh). The Ministry of Finance \nand the Ministry of Industry and Trade will issue guidelines for the tariff increasing mechanism. The \ntariff increase is a crucial step that will enable EVN to grow strongly and help it to cover sufficiently \nits operational costs and capital requirements. After 2010, EVN's electricity selling prices will be \nadjusted annually under the market-based mechanism. Such adjustments of the electricity selling \nprices are subject to approval of state authorities (the prime minister, Ministry of Industry and Trade \nand Ministry of Finance) if increases of more than 5% are required. \n \n7.  Foreign exchange risks. EVN has a number of loans denominated in foreign currencies \nsuch as yen or dollars. However, EVN has not hedged against the exchange rate risk, especially in \nthe case of an appreciation of the yen or of the dollar against the dong due to limited market \nliquidity. Thus, a significant change in the exchange rate between dong and those currencies may \nadversely affect the results of the operations of EVN. In 2008, EVN made a foreign exchange loss \nof D10.6 trillion based on International Accounting Standards. \n \n \n \n \n ", "28   Appendix 2 \n \n \nC.

Institutional Overview \n1.  The Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT) has policy and supervisory responsibilities for \nenergy, both as the line ministry and as the ministry with oversight responsibility for state-owned \ncompanies. MOIT is responsible for supervising implementation of government policy, and \nrecommending and drafting major policy reforms for government adoption. MOIT has specific \nresponsibility to implement the government\u2019s policy of full electrification by 2020 and promoting \nrenewable energy generation. \n \n2.  Viet Nam Electricity (EVN), the main power utility of Viet Nam, is organized as a holding \ncompany, with a series of wholly owned subsidiaries. EVN owns the strategic power plants, \nholds majority shareholding stakes in partially privatized power plants, and invests as the sole \ninvestor or in partnership with other public and private investors in new power plants. Key \nsubsidiaries include three regional power companies that are in charge of power transmission \nand distribution from 110 kilovolts (kV) and less in northern Viet Nam (Power Company 1 \n[PC1]), southern Viet Nam (Power Company 2 [PC2]), and central Viet Nam (Power Company 3 \n[PC3]); and power distribution companies responsible for power distribution in large cities such \nas Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hai Phong, Hai Dong, Da Nang, Hai Dong, Khanh Hoa, and Dong \nNai. The power companies each maintain their own financial accounts and have a high degree \nof  managerial  and  financial  autonomy.  Other  key  entities  under  EVN  include  the  Power \nTransmission  Corporation  responsible  for  high-voltage  (500  kV  and  220  kV)  power \ntransmission; four power engineering consulting companies; the National Load Dispatch Center; \nand  subsidiaries  engaged  in  non-core  activities  such  as  equipment  manufacturing, \ntelecommunications, real estate, and financial services.  \n \n3.  Viet Nam's far-reaching power sector reform program was launched with passage of the \nforward-looking Electricity Law in late 2004 and establishment of the new Electricity Regulatory \nAuthority of Viet Nam under the oversight of the minister of industry. The country's efforts to \nrestructure  the  power  industry  and  develop  a  competitive  power  market  are  a  long-term \nproposition.  The  objectives  of  Viet  Nam's  power  sector  reform  are  to  maximize  efficiency \nthrough  competition  in  the  power  industry  and  to  expand  mobilization  of  investment  and \nmanagerial resources from outside the current state-operated system, in order to minimize costs \nand provide reliable, high-quality service to consumers. As described in the recently approved \nroad  map,  the  reform  process  is  expected  to  span  20  years,  and  proceed  through  (i)  a \npreparatory phase and initial \"trial\" market, followed by operation of a competitive market for \nsupply  from  generators  to  a  single  buyer;  (ii)  a  second  phase  introducing  a  wholesale \ncompetitive market for bulk supply to distribution companies and large users; and (iii) a final \nphase introducing retail competition.  \n \n4.  In rural areas, local communities own and operate the low-voltage electricity distribution \nsystems in most areas. The basic approach adopted for rural electrification in Viet Nam has \nbeen  for  EVN's  power  companies  to  develop  the  medium-voltage  network,  and  for  local \ncommunities to develop the low-voltage system (although EVN has undertaken this role for \nabout one-fifth of Viet Nam's communes). Provincial people\u2019s committees have oversight for \nrural electrification in their provinces, and provide substantial financial support for the local \nshare of investment. Until 2004, local power distribution was handled by informal commune \nelectricity  groups  or  other  informal  entities  in  about  two-thirds  of  Viet  Nam's  electrified \ncommunes.  According  to  government  regulations,  however,  all  of  these  entities  are  now \nrequired to convert to formal legal entities, such as cooperatives or joint-stock companies. As of \nthe end of 2007, 39% of electrified communes were supplied by EVN\u2019s power distribution \n ", "30   Appendix 3 \n \nsubsidiaries,  54%  of  the  communes  by  cooperatives,  4%  of  the  communes  by  joint-stock \ncompanies, and only 3% by informal entities. \n \nB.  Power Sector Performance \n5.  Performance of Viet Nam's power industry, managed primarily by EVN, has been quite \ngood in recent years. The industry has kept pace during the last decade with extraordinary \nincreases in demand, maintaining basic service for its customers most of the time. EVN has \nmaintained strong financial viability, while keeping costs to consumers quite low by international \nstandards.  Dramatic  increases  in  rural  access  and  steady  reductions  in  transmission  and \ndistribution losses are particularly notable achievements. The challenge for the future is to meet \nthe  rapidly  expanding  demands  of  the  economy  and  population,  with  minimum  disruption, \nhopefully with further improvements in service quality and without unreasonable increases in \ncosts to consumers. \n \n6.  Electricity generation in Viet Nam grew at an annual compounded rate of 13.7% during \n1995\u20132007, and since 2000 the annual growth rate has exceeded 15%. Electricity generation \nhas grown threefold 2000 to 2008 to reach 67 terawatt-hours in 2004 compared with 23.7 \nterawatt hours in 1999. The forecasted gross domestic product (GDP) growth exceeding 7% for \n2005\u20132010, coupled with the increasing share of industrial output in Viet Nam\u2019s GDP, will \nmaintain the growth momentum in electricity demand as shown Table A3. The reserve margin \nbecomes very low during the dry season and this becomes even worse in northern Viet Nam \nwhere most of the generation capacity is hydro. \n \nTable A3: Historic Demand and Generation Data, 2005\u20132009 \n \nItem  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009 \nAnnual demand (gigawatt-hour)  53,400  59,800  67,100  75,400  84,600 \nPeak demand in dry season (MW)  9,018  10,157  11,235  12,782  14,286 \nGrowth in annual demand (%)  15.2  11.9  12.3  12.3  12.3 \nInstalled capacity (MW)  10,907  11,714  13,419  16,383  19,084 \nDry season available capacity (MW)  9,018  10,243  11,288  13,346  17,173 \nReserve margin in dry season (%)  4  1  0    4  20 \n       MW = megawatt. \n       Source: Ministry of Industry and Trade. \n \n7.  Access to electricity in rural areas increased dramatically during 1996\u20132004, marking \none of the most successful recent rural electrification programs in the world. The number of rural \nhouseholds with access to electricity increased from 50.7% in 1996 to 92% in 2007. Rural \nhousehold access rates are expected to increase in the next few years, although achievement \nof access among the final 5% of rural households will not be easy. The success of Viet Nam's \nprogram lies especially with the commitment of the government to rural electrification, and the \ndefinition and systematic implementation of national plans as a matter of priority, as well as \npublic investment and support to match community funds. \n \n8.  Transmission and distribution losses in EVN's system have fallen steadily over the last \ndecade, to 12.2% in 2007. This is not unreasonable for a system such as Viet Nam's in its \ncurrent  stage  of  development,  especially  given  the  heavy  role  of  low-voltage  residential \nconsumers, but further improvement is possible. In future, the Electricity Regulatory Authority of \nViet Nam must monitor efficiency indicators carefully against various benchmarks. Management \nof consumer accounts receivable has been exceptionally effective for a developing country, with \naccounts receivable in 2007 equivalent to only about 17 days of sales. Nontechnical losses, \nincluding theft, are low compared with many countries. Widespread anecdotal evidence points \nto substantial improvements in the quality of electricity service over the last 10 years, with basic \n ", "Appendix 3       31 \nservice for most customers in urban or peri-urban areas becoming noticeably more reliable. \nHowever, systematic statistical monitoring of service interruptions and voltage drops, by service \narea and customer voltage, is lacking. \n \n9.  The tariff was D880 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 2004 ($0.056/kWh). This is lower than the \naverage retail price today in most countries. The financial position of EVN has remained sound \nwith unit revenue remaining stable during the last few years through 2007, covering all of its \ndirect and indirect costs, but this revenue will not be sufficient for the future. Viet Nam's power \ntariff is sophisticated in structure, with rates varying by voltage level and consumer type, and \noffering time-of-day rates for major consumers. Urban residential rates increase progressively \nwith  increasing  consumption.  Rural  rates  are  cross-subsidized  by  other  consumers.  Both \naverage urban residential rates and rural residential rates are modestly cross-subsidized by \nhigher rates for industry and commerce. \n \nC.  Main Power Sector Issues \n1.  Meeting Power Demand \n10.  The  demand  for  electric  power  is  the  paramount  challenge  for  Viet  Nam's  power \nindustry.  Key  drivers  of  the  country's  economic  growth,  especially  manufacturing  and \ncommercial and service industries, are highly dependent upon power supply. Reliable electricity \nservice  is  essential  for  light  industries  to  remain  competitive  with  similar  industries  in \nneighboring countries. Electricity has also become an expected basic element in the livelihood \nof most people, and an essential part of increasing standards of living. The power shortages \nexperienced in the dry seasons of 2005\u20132008 clearly reinforced a priority focus on meeting \ndemand  throughout  Viet  Nam's  power  industry,  with  highly  visible  national  attention.  The \ncapacity shortfall was estimated at some 1,500\u20132,000 MW during peak load. The shortage was \ncaused by the coincidence of severe drought conditions, reducing hydropower production, with \nan extremely thin reserve margin in the overall system due to an inability to develop new \ncapacity over a short time to meet the higher than expected surges in power demand. \n \n11.  Viet Nam\u2019s overall strategy is to develop existing hydropower resources and the coal \nand gas plants, subject to the availability of domestic fuel resources, relatively quickly as both \nexploitable domestic coal supplies and offshore gas supplies have supply constraints. The \navailability of domestic coal for the power industry is capped by domestic resource limits, given \ncurrent technology, and exports. Expanding the gas supply requires not only field and pipeline \ndevelopment, but also exploration and firming up of reserves. \n \n12.  Coal-based power generation. Assessment of the best balances between coal- and \ngas-fired power is a key long-term planning issue, which is highly sensitive to future relative fuel \nprice and supply expectations. With the country's coal resources limited, the government's \nstrategy is to strictly cap exports in favor of expanding domestic supply\u2014essentially to postpone \nthe expected eventual need for coal imports. Although high-quality anthracite obtains a premium \nprice on the international market, domestic coal prices for power generation are maintained \nbelow international prices. At current domestic coal prices, power generation from domestic coal \nis significantly less expensive than combined-cycle, gas-based power generation at capacity \nfactors exceeding 50%\u201360%. However, in economic terms, considered from the perspective of \nthe country as a whole, the value of domestic coal used for power generation is higher than its \ncurrent price, as it can be exported for more money, which would accrue to Viet Nam. However, \ndevelopment of large-scale power generation using Viet Nam's offshore natural gas resources \nrequires aligning the interests of a series of institutional participants, and major upfront financing \nand long-term commitments. On the gas exploration and development side, for the longer term, \nViet  Nam  must  maintain  an  attractive  framework  for  international  companies  to  continue \n ", "32   Appendix 3 \n \nexploration and firm up reserves, as much potential remains unexplored. Once the main options \nfor generation from domestic coal and gas have been exploited, thermal power generation using \nimported coal is expected to be the most cost-effective option. \n \n13.  Gas-based  power  generation.  PetroVietnam  Gas  Corporation,  PetroVietnam's \nsubsidiary charged with natural gas operations, is a central entity, holding the government's \nshares in field production facilities, retaining the sole rights in most cases to buy offshore gas \nand sell gas to end-users, and charged with gas transmission system development (although \nthis  may  be  in  cooperation  with  international  companies).  Upstream  gas  exploration  and \ndevelopment  is  undertaken  in  joint-venture  or  production-sharing  arrangements  between \nPetroVietnam  Gas  Corporation  and  international  petroleum  companies.  On  the  power \ngeneration  side,  development  of  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  with  investors \nindependent of EVN is essential for a large portion of the power generation capacity, due to \nEVN's limited financing capacity. Finally, the government (aside from its ownership position of \nPetroVietnam  and  EVN)  must  play  key  roles:  sanctioning  the  specific  development \narrangements and providing some type of partial risk coverage for electricity sale arrangements \nto outside investors. \n \n14.  Hydropower development. With goals to provide almost 6,000 MW over the medium \nterm, Viet Nam's program to develop its many medium-sized hydro sites will provide a core \ncontribution to the overall power development program in each of the three geographic regions. \nParticular advantages include development of a source of domestic renewable energy quite \nseparate from international energy price and security risks, and benefits from associated water \ncontrol in many cases. Although economics vary by site, costs are generally quite competitive \nwith the thermal power options in Viet Nam. Viet Nam has made substantial progress during the \nlast 5 years in upgrading its reservoir resettlement and environmental assessment practices. \nCurrent policies provide a reasonably well-structured set of legal and regulatory requirements. \nFinancial commitments for resettlement work in new projects are now substantial. The most \ndifficult issues, including restoration of livelihoods for ethnic minorities that may be affected by \nreservoir  development,  are  complex  in  every  country,  and  require  concerted  efforts  in \nconsultation with local residents throughout implementation. \n \n15.  Renewable energy development. Viet Nam's renewable energy development program \nis growing, and can provide an increasing contribution in the future. Development has focused \nespecially on off-grid power supply in isolated areas, but small hydro facilities, in particular, can \nalso provide an important source of renewable energy to the grid. Wind power generation may \nalso provide a small contribution. Viet Nam plans to develop nuclear energy capacity over the \nlong  term.  Both  MOIT  and  EVN  have  developed  demand-side  management  and  energy \nefficiency  programs  in  recent  years.  Load  management  programs  and  energy  efficiency \npromotion and investment programs are proven means to address capacity constraints that are \nfar less expensive than new capacity. Such efforts can yield results relatively quickly in some \ncases, but do require sophisticated institutional development, which has proved challenging in \nmost countries. \n \n2.  Financing the Investment \n16.  Annual power sector investment requirements to meet power demand during 2005\u20132010 \nare expected to be more than $3 billion. The country seeks to mobilize investment through a \nvariety of vehicles, from both domestic and foreign sources, to meet this challenge. The two \nbasic categories are EVN's contribution to investment from its own resources and different types \nof borrowing, and independent investment, primarily by IPPs. Financing of new investment \nthrough  the  current  EVN  system,  including  subentities,  is  essential  for  key  parts  of  the \nconstruction  effort,  including  the  network,  most  of  the  hydropower  program,  and  selected \n ", "Appendix 3       33 \nelements in the thermal power program. EVN exhibited strong financial performance during \n2002\u20132007, allowing a substantial self-financing contribution to the investment program.  \n \n17.  With increased costs stemming in part from power shortages, and the sharp increases in \ninvestment requirements, self-financing ratios will plummet unless EVN's unit sales revenue \nincreases substantially. The corporation is proceeding to borrow from a wide variety of sources, \nincluding by issuing bonds. However, EVN will reach borrowing limits very quickly, unless \nrevenues are increased (or a major injection of equity is made, which is unlikely). Overextension \nof borrowing above internationally recognized ratios would be highly imprudent, as maintenance \nof  EVN's  creditworthiness  is  essential  for  any  sustainable  investment  mobilization  effort. \nAverage  retail  power  prices  must  be  increased  quickly  to  cover  greater  costs  but  also, \nespecially, to expand revenues for financing the massive power sector expansion. Ultimately, \nconsumers must contribute to the financing of the new capacity to meet their needs. Power \nprices in Viet Nam\u2014including industrial tariffs, and especially in the residential sector\u2014are \nrelatively low by international standards. \n \n18.  Clearly,  dramatic  increases  in  power  sector  investment  from  outside  EVN  will  be \nrequired to meet overall sector investment requirements. Viet Nam is pursuing a wide range of \nIPP arrangements in its efforts to meet the huge and rapid increases in power demand. IPP \narrangements  for  new  power  plants  include  (i)  build-operate-transfer  or  build-operate-own \nventures  wholly  owned  by  other  public-owned  Vietnamese  entities;  (ii)  joint-venture  build-\noperate-transfer  or  build-operate-own  arrangements,  involving  EVN  investment  with  other \nparticipants (local public or foreign); and (iii) build-operate-transfer arrangements wholly owned \nby foreign parties, either public or private. In addition, new joint-stock company IPPs are being \ncreated from EVN's partial divestiture of existing power plants. In the case of Viet Nam, few \npublic entities have the resources and interest to make major power generation investments, \nwhich  are,  for  the  most  part,  limited  to  the  state-owned  fuel  supply  companies  or  large \nconstruction companies. \n ", "34   Appendix 4 \n \nDEVELOPMENT PARTNER COORDINATION \n \n1.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nII.   \n \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nViet Nam has been one of the fastest growing economies in the Asia for the last two decades, with real gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth averaging 8.0% per annum during 2003\u20132007. Per capita GDP increased to $817 in 2007 compared \nwith $441 in 2002. Although the country has suffered from high inflation due to high energy and food prices and supply \nbottlenecks, the long-term growth prospects remain positive. Viet Nam has achieved remarkable progress in socioeconomic \ndevelopment since 1993. The reduction in the national poverty rate from 58% in 1993 to less than 20% by 2007 is \nunprecedented. However, poverty remains at more than 50% in northern mountain provinces inhabited by ethnic minority \ncommunities. The lack of infrastructure facilities and nonfarm income-generation activities have contributed to the persistent \npoverty in these isolated areas. The country business operation plana  of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Viet Nam \nfocuses on supporting pro-poor economic growth, social equity and balanced development, and sustainable environment \nmanagement. One of the key challenges for poverty reduction in Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP)b is to \nprovide the basic services and infrastructure needed to ensure the access to markets needed to attract private investment \nand create jobs. ADB\u2019s country strategy to help the government reduce poverty by implementing SEDP targets is particularly \nfocused on promoting pro-poor economic growth. Provision of basic infrastructure is one of the prerequisites.  \n \nThe potential for electricity to facilitate communication, income generation, and economic growth is part of the government\u2019s \npoverty reduction strategy. Currently, 91.5% of households in Viet Nam are connected to the national power grid system, and \nthe government plans to extend the system to connect about 96% of villages. Those remaining unconnected are communes \nin remote mountain, central, and southern provinces, often inhabited by ethnic minorities with 40%\u201370% of the population \nliving below the national poverty line. The project contributes to the government\u2019s objective of connecting electricity to 100% \nof households by 2012. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues \n Viet Nam has made significant progress in providing electricity services to the population. This is a key objective in the \ngovernment\u2019s strategy to reduce poverty and vulnerability. The share of households with access to electricity increased from \n49% in 1992 to 86% in 2002 and nearly 94% in 2008. The consumption of electricity increased during 1995\u20132008 from 156 \nkilowatt-hours (kWh) per household per month to about 800 kWh. However, due to Viet Nam's rapid economic growth during \nthe last two decades since 1988 with a 16% power demand growth all over the country, Viet Nam Electricity (EVN) is facing \nshortage of power generation and has had to introduce load shedding in both rural and urban areas. For example, in 2008, \nload shedding was introduced in large cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, and the residential sector and small \nconsumers were the first to experience interrupted supply as the government decided to give priority to the industry sector. \nSuch policy had negative impacts on the poorest households who were running small businesses.  \n \nBefore March 2009, the rural grids were operated by rural distribution cooperatives with limited resources and low technical \nskills, leading to high technical and commercial losses, resulting in high tariffs for consumers. Since March 2009, the \ngovernment decided that all these inefficient grids should be operated and maintained by EVN. This includes power grids of \nabout 5,000 communes and concerns about 7 million consumers. To decrease technical and commercial losses in such grids, \nas well as to increase their reliability, EVN needs to make important investment in the medium- and low-voltage grids. For the \neconomic growth of Viet Nam and the development of the industry sector, and due to the increased power demand from the \nresidential sector, EVN needs to invest in new power generation. Due to the large investment required, the government \ndecided that, in addition to the investment made by EVN, it would call for private investors to build additional generation \ncapacity. Due to the development of this additional generation, EVN also needs to reinforce its transmission and distribution \nsystem in order to supply power to the end user consumer with an acceptable degree of quality and reliability as well as at a \nreasonable price, i.e., by limiting technical losses to an acceptable level. The proposed project will thus address these issues \nby financing the reinforcement of the 500 kilovolt (kV), 220 kV, and 110 kV transmission systems and the rehabilitation of \nmedium- and low-voltage grids in urban and rural areas. To summarize, a reliable source and good quality electricity supply is \nvery important for industrial growth, commerce, the service sector, and poverty reduction. Employment generated through \nindustry, commerce, and services will offer a significant opportunity to many households from rural areas. \n \n ", "38   Appendix 5 \n \n \n2. Design Features    \nThe project will not have direct poverty reduction impact. Given the nature of the project there is no scope for pro-poor design. \n \nIII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nThe social assessment in the project areas show that electricity problems, shortage of electricity, unreliable power voltage, \nand power cuts have implications for industry, business, home industry, health, and education facilities. The following are the \nkey findings of the social analysis. \n \nBefore 2005, all households in the six subproject areas had access to electricity. The management of electricity and supply \nwas under the control of communes and wards. This led to different pricing in different areas. Before that time, the electricity \ncooperatives were responsible for electricity at the commune level and sold electricity at a high price (D700\u2013D1,000 per kWh \nfor households, and D1,500\u2013D2,000 for small private enterprises), but the power supply was unreliable and of low quality. The \nelectricity price in urban areas was cheaper than in rural areas. This was due to (i) a high level of electric power leakage in \nrural areas, and to compensate for this leak, rural households often had to bear the increased electricity price; and (ii) poor \nmanagement and corruption at commune and ward level. Nowadays, households in the subproject areas have access to \nelectricity at the government price. However, the degraded power transmission networks resulted in poor electricity quality \nand unstable supply. This has a significant impact on households and small-scale businesses because the required amount of \nelectricity is not always provided. The poor quality of supply that leads to voltage drop or sometimes over-voltage, including \npower cuts, are not favorable to the development of small business especially in rural areas. High losses are also contributing \nto higher cost of electricity, despite the existing lifeline tariff that the government introduced in favor of smaller consumers. \n \nViet Nam is shifting away from a centrally planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. Industries, services, and \nbusinesses are booming. In the subproject areas, there are many small businesses such as restaurants, cafes, karaoke bars, \nand food processing plants, and these business activities are a major source of income for local entrepreneurs. However, \nthese businesses require large amounts of reliable and stable power. Power cuts and fluctuating voltage has significant \nnegative impact on local businesses. For example, in Nam Sach district, a food processing plant (soy curd) can lose D5 \nmillion a night due to power cuts. Some entrepreneurs use their own generators for their businesses but most of them does \nnot have back up generators and are suffering of production losses. Farmers use electric water pumps for irrigation, but due \nto unstable and insufficient power supply they sometimes use diesel-powered water pumps which cost three times more to \nrun. Big enterprises, such as in the shrimp industry, can lose several thousand dollars a day due to power cuts. Workers can \nalso lose income due to power cuts. In the subproject areas there are 21 industrial zones in food processing, shipping, coal \nexploitation, garment industries, etc. Although these industrial sites have private power lines, due to overloading and old \ncables there are power cuts 5\u20137 days a month, and this affects the operation of the industries. Some of these big industries \nhave to buy high-volume power generators, and in some cases garment factories have to replace automatic machines with \nmanual ones.  \n \nElectrical power supply is usually cut off during the hot periods in summer. In addition, electricity quality is not stable and \nreliable. Due to inadequate electric supply, domestic equipment such as TVs, cooking stoves, and electric lamps can not be \noperated. Because of power cuts and insufficient power, clean water factories in some communes and wards in Hai Duong \nprovince are not working; as a result, 80% of households do not have clean water. Women bear the burden of electricity \nproblems; instead of using electricity for cooking, they have to use firewood, straw, charcoal, or dried leaves. The commune \nleaders advised that during power cuts around 70%\u201380% of the population have no fresh water, and water must be carried by \nshoulder poles from public wells\u2014a burden which is generally taken up by women. \n \nIn recent years, with the economic development the health facilities have been equipped with modern amenities. The \ninsufficient electrical power supply causes difficulties in medical practices such as medical checks, surgery, and preservation \nof medicine, etc. In some project areas, such as Tien Lang, Hai Phong, due to power cuts for 7\u201310 days in a month, diesel \ngenerators were bought, which increases the cost of providing medical services. Despite government attempts to invest more \non human resources, medications, and facilities in hospitals, medical centers, and clinics in rural areas, rural people still have \ngo to provincial hospitals because of poor power supply in the rural health centers. This results in more pressure on hospitals \nand health facilities at the provincial level. The power cuts in schools and colleges disturb laboratory work for the students, \nand the teaching process, and affect the quality of learning. At an individual level, low quality of power supply introduces some \nextra costs for middle-income consumers as the life span of electric appliances is reduced. The investments are for \nconstruction of new 220 kV and 110 kV substations and upgrading and rehabilitating the rural grid network and will facilitate \nadequate and reliable electricity supply for individual customers, industries, businesses, public facilities, etc. Stable power \nsupply will play a very important role in small businesses. The supply of adequate and reliable electricity will increase \nbusiness opportunities for manufacturing and hotels, and will provide employment opportunities. The negative impact of the \nproject relates to resettlement activities such as land acquisition. The resettlement plan includes mitigation measures for the \naffected people. \n ", "Appendix 5  39 \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nStakeholders were consulted in the subproject locations during the preparation of the resettlement plan. In addition to sample \nsurvey, interviews were held with individuals and focus group meetings with key stakeholders (men and women) from different \noccupational groups such as small business owners, education and health care providers, local administration, and regional \ndevelopment authorities.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n \n1.  Key Issues \nThe lack of reliable electricity affects women's work in industry, food processing plants, and cash-crop farming. Power cuts \nand fluctuation of voltage affects use of household equipment and increases the drudgery of women's work. Power cuts and \nvoltage shortages can affect work for women entrepreneurs in terms of profit and their daily schedule. In the subproject areas \nwomen are mainly involved in agricultural production and small-scale trade. Women are also involved in education, public \nservices, and health care services, and many younger women are working in industrial parks located in the subproject areas. \nWomen are also engaged in small and medium-sized private enterprises, and restaurants located in the communes. Most \nyoung women in Ninh Thuy commune (Ninh Thuy 110 kV substation and transmission line subproject) are involved in sea fish \nand shrimp processing factories. The older women take part in salt making and managing small businesses. These food \nprocessing industries and businesses depend on electricity. The industrial parks which employ many women workers from \nlocal communities are heavily reliant on reliable power supply. Sea fish and shrimp processing plants mostly engage women \nworkers. Electricity power cuts have a direct impact on women\u2019s income because they are not paid a fixed rate but their pay is \nbased on production. For plantations of vegetables and flowers women use electric water pumps due to the low cost of \nelectricity. During power cuts water has to be carried by shoulder poles from wells\u2014a burden which is mainly taken up by \nwomen. \n \nElectric rice cookers are used by 80%\u201390% of farmer households in five of six subproject areas. In the Duc Trong 220 kV \nsubstation area, about 57.5% of ethnic minority households (Phu Hoi commune) have electric rice cookers. When there are \npower cuts, they have to use firewood, straw, charcoal, or dried leaves for cooking, which is time-consuming. The time spent \nin cooking also impacts on women's child care responsibilities.  \n \nReliable electricity would increase income and productivity of women workers in the industry and food processing plants. \nAccess to quality electricity would allow women to investment in and use household appliances, and this would reduce their \nwork. The improvement of voltage shortage and less frequent power cuts would increase business turnover for women \nentrepreneurs. \n \n2.  Key Actions.

These subprojects can be categorized into seven different technical groups: (i) new \nair-insulated  substations,  (ii)  extension  of  existing  air-insulated  substations,  (iii)  new  gas-\ninsulated substations (GIS), (iv) extension of existing GIS, (v) new transmission overhead lines, \n(vi) new underground cables, and (vii) rehabilitation of rural and urban medium- and low-voltage \ngrids. The subprojects will be implemented by 11 subsidiaries of Viet Nam Electricity (EVN).  \n \n2.  The resettlement plans will only apply for projects categorized in groups (i), (iii), and (v). \nprojects from groups (ii), (iv), (vi), and (vii) will not imply land acquisition so no resettlement is \nanticipated. Table A6.2 presents the results of the preliminary assessment that has been carried \nout and provides the involuntary resettlement categorization and procedure requirements for \neach of the proposed subprojects.  \n \n3.  There are 41 subprojects that involve land acquisition and resettlement. Due diligence \nwas conducted on seven subprojects where land acquisition has already been completed or is \nongoing. For the other 34 subprojects that imply resettlement, short resettlement plans will have \nto be prepared to address land acquisition and resettlement issues that will only be determined \nafter the final design and detailed measurement survey has been carried out. Therefore, a \nresettlement framework has been prepared to provide guidance during their preparation and \nimplementation. A full resettlement framework is provided in Supplementary Appendix A.    \n \n4.  Project resettlement and ethnic minorities principles. The payment for land and non-\nland assets will follow the principle of replacement cost. Assistance to severely affected and \nvulnerable households will be provided in cash or in kind. For households who experienced a \ndecline in income based on due diligence findings or whose income source may be affected or \nwill be at risk once the land is acquired, suitable livelihood development programs will be \ndesigned  and  implemented  in  consultation  with  households  during  implementation.  Ethnic \nminority Kin people living in the project area are integrated into Vietnamese society. Of the 41 \nsubprojects, three future subprojects are expected to acquire land owned by ethnic minorities; \nno  households  will  be  relocated.  Resettlement  plans  affecting  ethnic  minority  people  shall \ninclude ethnic minority specific actions. \n \n5.  The resettlement framework will include the following gender-related specific actions: (i) \na separate consultation meeting will be held to disclose the resettlement plan, (ii) replacement \nland will be registered in the names of both husband and wife in cases where land acquisition \nhas taken place, (iii) compensation money will be paid to both husband and wife, and (iv) \nwomen will be consulted in planning and training for income restoration program. \n \n6.  Consultation, disclosure, and grievance. Consultations with the affected households \nwill be carried out during the preparation of the resettlement plan. These activities will continue \nduring  implementation  of  the  short  resettlement  plans  for  category  B  subprojects.  Key \ninformation of resettlement plans will have to be disclosed to the affected households prior to \nappraisal of the concerned subprojects. A grievance redress mechanism is to be established \nand will be handled through mediation aimed at achieving consensus. Any complaint will pass \nthrough three stages before it can be elevated to a court of law as a last resort. \n \n7.  Implementation  arrangements.  The  executing  agency  is  EVN.  The  implementing \nagencies for the project are 11 participating subsidiaries of EVN. The overall coordination and \nadministration  of  the  project,  including  all  those  connected  to  the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, is under the responsibility of the subsidiaries or their head office (for the National \nPower  Transmission  Corporation  [NPT]).  Each  power  company  or  office  has  its  own \n ", "42   Appendix 6 \n \nenvironment and social unit. As mandated by Decree 84/2007/CP on the land acquisition for \nnational security and public interests, development purposes, land acquisition will be carried out \nby the district resettlement committee, chaired by the chair or vice chair of the district people\u2019s \ncommittee. Therefore, the NPT and power companies will have to work closely with the district \nresettlement committees. \n \n8.  Monitoring. The NPT and the power companies will serve as the project\u2019s internal \nmonitoring  body  for  their  respective  subprojects.  The  result  of  internal  monitoring  will  be \nincluded as a part of monthly progress reports that the power companies and NPT will have to \nsubmit to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) through the EVN steering committee. In addition, \nquarterly independent monitoring reports on the implementation of the resettlement plans will have \nto be submitted to ADB, starting from the commencement of resettlement plan preparation, which \ncoincides with the conduct of the detailed measurement survey and other resettlement activities. \nSocial  monitoring  reports  will  be  made  available  to  the  affected  households  and  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB for posting on ADB\u2019s website. EVN will recruit an external monitor agency to \ncarry out the monitoring and evaluation tasks.  \n \n9.  Resettlement  plan  budget.  The  budget  for  all  packages  cover  compensation  costs, \nallowances,  relocation  and  rehabilitation  measures,  administration  costs,  and  contingency. \nIndependent appraisal agencies will be engaged by each of the power companies and NPT in \norder to assess the current market rates of the land and non-land assets. The power companies \nand  NPT  will  ensure  the  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds  for  covering  any  unforeseen \nobligations  in  excess  of  the  resettlement  budget  estimates  in  order  to  satisfy  resettlement \nrequirements and objectives.    \n \n10.  Implementation schedule. All resettlement activities will be coordinated with the civil \nworks schedule. Land acquisition and relocation of affected households cannot commence \nunless the updated resettlement plan has been reviewed and approved by ADB. EVN will not \nallow  construction  activities  in  specific  sites  until  all  resettlement  activities  have  been \nsatisfactorily completed, agreed rehabilitation assistance is in place, and the specific sites are \nfree of all encumbrances. \n \nTable A6.1: Indicative Schedule of Resettlement Activities \n \nActivities  Schedule \nRP Preparation  January 2010\u2013December 2010 \nADB approval of draft RP   September 2010\u2013January 2011 \nRP updating   April\u2013May 2010 \n   Detailed measurement survey, replacement cost survey  April\u2013May 2010 \n   Consultation   April\u2013Dec 2010 \n   Finalization of relocation strategy   May\u2013June 2010 \n   Design of income restoration program/strategy   May\u2013June 2010 \n   Disclosure of draft updated RP to APs  June 2010 \nSubmission and ADB approval of updated RP  July 2010 \nImplementation of the approved updated RP   July 2010\u2013December 2010 \n    Disbursement of compensation to APs  July\u2013Sep 2010 \n    Relocation of affected households   Aug\u2013Dec 2010 \n     Implementation of income restoration program/strategy  Aug\u2013Dec 2010 \nInternal monitoring (Submission of monthly progress reports)  April 2010\u2013December 2011 \nExternal monitoring (intermittent)  April 2010\u2013December 2011 \nCivil works construction  April 2010\u2013onwards \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AP = affected people, RP = resettlement plan. \nSource: Electricity of Viet Nam. \n \n ", " \nTable A6.2: Project\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Categorization and Procedure Requirements \n \n    Land          Resettlement plan   \n    acquisition      Approx  Approx  preparation   \nNo  Power company name of projects  Category  LAA (m2)  AH  SAH  NR  HBP  TBPI  EMR \nNNLA TBA \nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  Economic and financial assessment of subprojects is conducted by estimating economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) and financial internal rate of return (FIRR). Feasibility studies \nunder this guarantee program are prepared by National Power Transmission Corporation (NPT) \nand other power companies (subsidiaries of Viet Nam Electricity [EVN]) in accordance with the \ngovernment regulation. The government decree1 provides the guideline for the preparation of \nthose feasibility studies. This appendix explains the government guidelines and criteria for the \nfeasibility study of subprojects, and shows economic assessment, prepared by EVN staff, of the \n220 kilovolt (kV) Trang Bang\u2013Tay Ninh transmission line subproject as a case model for this \nguarantee program. For consistency in undertaking such analysis for the other subprojects, a \nmethodology has been developed for the use of EVN's staff and is provided as Supplementary \nAppendix I. \n \nB.  Subproject Economic and Financial Criteria \n \n2.  In  accordance  with  a  government  decree  No.12/2009,  EVN  subsidiaries  prepare \nfeasibility study reports of subprojects, which cover following five categories: \n \n(i)  investment necessity and objective; \n(ii)  project size, scope, construction area, work items, technologies, and capacity; \n(iii)  implementation solutions, including project management, general plan on ground \nclearance and resettlement, architectural design plan, and project operation and \nlabor; \n(iv)  assessment of environmental impacts; and \n(v)  project investment plan, including project cost estimates. \n \n3.  Project  investment  plans  include  total  cost  estimate,  capital  arrangement  capacity, \ncapital sources and the capacity to allocate capital according to the implementation schedule, \nthe capital repayment plan, and analysis and assessment of the project's economic, financial, \nand social benefits. According to this guidance, investment costs and economic assessment of \nthe Tran Bang\u2013Tay Ninh transmission line were prepared by EVN staff. \n \nC.  Economic Costs and Benefits for Tran Bang\u2013Tay Ninh Transmission Line \nSubproject \n \n4.  The  economics  of  the  subproject  are  analyzed  based  on  comparing  the  cost  and \nbenefits  of  without  and  with  the  subproject.  The  project  costs  of  Tran  Bang\u2013Tay  Ninh \ntransmission  line  is  estimated  at  $25.52  million.  This  cost  covers  a  42  kilometer  220  kV \ntransmission line, equipment, project management cost, and physical contingencies. In addition, \noperation and maintenance cost is 2% of the investment. The EIRR was calculated on the basis \nof the base costs and physical contingencies. \n \n5.  The economic benefits of the subproject are estimated by incremental sale as a result of \nthis subproject, reduction of losses, and reduction of unserved energy. The economic benefits \n                                                 \n1  Decree No.12/2009/ND-CP of February 12 2009 on management of investment projects on the construction of \nworks. \n ", "48   Appendix 7 \n \nwere measured by the incremental sales from the new capacity of the distribution system. \nIncremental  sales  in  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  were  calculated  by  subproject  component.  The \neconomic benefits from incremental sales were computed from the volume of incremental sales \nfrom  the  projects  multiplied  by  the  value  of  kilowatt-hours  sale  attributable  to  this  project \n($0.061/kWh).
