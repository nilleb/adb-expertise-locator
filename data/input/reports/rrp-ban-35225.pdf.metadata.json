To meet its goal of halving the \nincome poverty level by 2015 will require more than doubling \nthe  rate  of  poverty  reduction  from  the  1.5%  per  year \nexperienced during the 1990s. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s \npriority  is  to  accelerate  and  expand  the  scope  for  pro-poor \neconomic  growth  by  raising  the  rate  of  economic  growth \nquickly  and  sustainably,  with  an  emphasis  on  generating \nproductive  employment.  The  promotion  and  development  of \nsmall  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  will  take  center  stage \nfor  raising  pro-poor  economic  growth  that,  being  generally \nlabor  intensive,  utilizes  Bangladesh\u2019s  factor  endowments  to \ntheir competitive advantage in the local and global markets. \n \nRecent  analysis  confirms  the  important  role  that  the  SME \nsector  plays  in  reducing  poverty  in  Bangladesh.  The  more \nrapid  growth  of  the  economy  in  the  1990s  has  been \naccompanied by a faster rate of poverty reduction than in the \n1980s. Significantly, this growth can be traced to nontradable \nactivities (services, construction, and small-scale industry) that \naccounted for about 70% of the incremental growth of the past \ndecade relative to the earlier decade. Unlike the 1980s, when \nthe  rapid  shift  of  labor  into  the  rural  nonfarm  sector  was \nlargely in the form of self-employment, the 1990s reflected the \nabsorption  of  wage  labor  in  greater  numbers  by  enterprises \nthat  were  relatively  larger  scale  and  more  productive.  It  is, \nthus,  of  critical  importance  to  the  poverty  reduction  effort  to \nbuild  on  this  growth  momentum  by  developing  an  enabling \nenvironment conducive to the accelerated growth of the SME \nsector over the medium to long term and to adopt policies that \nenable the poor to find gainful employment in this sector. \n \n\n\fii\n\n \n\n \n\n \nObjectives  \n\nthe \n\nstrategies, \n\nSMEs  account  for  about  40%  of  gross  manufacturing  output, \nabout  80%  of  industrial  employment,  and  about  25%  of  the \ntotal labor force in Bangladesh. However, they have not been \nable  to  realize  their  full  potential  due  to  various  constraints: \n(i) dearth  of  medium  to  long-term  credit;  (ii) limited  access  to \nmarket  opportunities,  technology,  expertise,  and  information, \nrelative  to  larger  enterprises;  (iii) lack  of  suitable  incentives; \n(iv) inefficient  and  limited  outreach  of  government  services; \nin \n(v) weak  capacity  among  SME  entrepreneurs \nand \nmanaging functional areas of business.  \n \nRecognizing  the  role  of  SMEs  in  economic  development  and \nthe  fight  against  poverty,  the  Government  formed  a  national \nto  recommend  SME  policy  guidelines  and \nTask  Force \nimplementation \nnecessary \nprovide \nunderpinnings  for  public  support  to  the  sector,  and  specify \ntargeted  assistance  and  a  dedicated  institutional  setup  for \nSME  development.  The  SME  Sector  Development  Program \n(SMESDP, the Program) supports the Government\u2019s initiative \nin  addressing  SME  constraints  and  providing  promotional \nsupport to facilitate their accelerated growth and development. \nSMESDP  is  fully  consistent  with  the  strategic  priorities  of  the \nGovernment  and  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \ncountry  strategy,  and  is  supported  by  other  development \npartners.  SMESDP  also  complements  the  Government\u2019s \nagenda  of  developing  the  country\u2019s  private  sector  as  the \nengine of growth for the economy, and helps facilitate the flow \nof  private  investments  into  the  SME  sector  in  parallel  with \nADB\u2019s  interventions  to  promote  good  governance  and  the \ndevelopment of the financial sector, particularly rural credit.  \n \nThe  goal  of  SMESDP  is  to  support  government  efforts  to \nfoster  development  of  the  SME  sector  and  enable  the  sector \nto  attain  its  full  potential  for  contributing  to  sustainable \neconomic growth and poverty reduction. SMESDP will support \nstrengthening the policy environment for SMEs, and improving \naccess by SMEs to credit and related support services. \n \nSMESDP  consists  of  four  parts:  (i) a  program  loan  of \nSDR9.954  million  ($15  million  equivalent)  supporting  policy \nreforms,  (ii) a  project  loan  of  SDR19.908  million  ($30  million \nequivalent)  for  extending  credit  to  small  enterprises,  (iii) a \ntechnical assistance (TA) loan of SDR3.318 million ($5 million \nequivalent)  for  improving  the  effectiveness  of  government \nassistance to the SME sector and facilitating SMEs\u2019 access to \nvarious  support  services  including  capacity  building  and \nsupport for infrastructure development for SMEs, and (iv) a TA \ngrant of $600,000 equivalent for assisting the Government to \nimplement  and  coordinate  the  Program  and  for  benefit \nmonitoring. \n \n\n\f \n\nProgram Loan  \n \n\nCost Estimates  \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nTranching \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\niii\n\nSMESDP  supports  three  program  outcomes.  The  first  is  to \nestablish  an  SME  policy  and  development  framework  to \nprovide  impetus  and  guidance  to  the  development  of  the \nsector. The second is to establish an institutional structure and \nnecessary  mechanisms  to  support  SME  development.  The \nthird  is  to  define  government  support  to  SMEs  and  facilitate \nSME  access \nlatter  entails \nto  various  services.  The \n(i) rationalization of government assistance to the SME sector, \nincluding credit directly administered by government agencies \nand public financial institutions; (ii) provision of tax incentives; \n(iii) enhancement  of  SME  access  to  market,  government \nservices, capacity building, and product certification, including \nupgrading  of  the  current  product  certification  system  to \ninternational  standard;  and  (iv) development  of  an  integrated \nSME database for improved targeting of assistance. \n \nThe costs of adjustment (excluding the project and TA costs) \nare  estimated  at  $33.4  million  equivalent  over  the  period \nFY2005\u2013FY2008,  reflecting  the  costs  for  development  and \nimplementation  of \nthe  SME  policy  and  development \nframework,  tax  incentives,  establishment  of  SME  support \ninfrastructure, and restructuring of concerned agencies under \nthe Ministry of Industries (MOI) providing services to SMEs. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  program  loan  of  SDR9.954  million  ($15 \nmillion  equivalent)  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  with  a \nterm of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with \nan  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period \nand  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The  loan  closing  date  is \nexpected to be 31 December 2007. \n \nThe  program  loan  will be  released  in  two  tranches  subject  to \ncompliance  with  agreed  conditions.  The  first  tranche,  in  the \namount  of  $5  million  equivalent,  will  be  released  upon \neffectiveness  of  the  loan  and  fulfillment  of  the  first  tranche \nrelease  conditions.  The  second \ntranche  of  $10  million \nequivalent is expected to be released by end-June 2007, upon \nfulfillment of the second tranche release conditions. \n \nThe  executing  agency  (EA)  for  the  program  loan  will  be  the \nMinistry  of  Finance,  Finance  Division  (MOF-FD).  The  EA  will \nconstitute  a  central  program  coordination  unit  (CPCU)  in \ncharge  of  program  monitoring  and  coordination.  The \nimplementing  agency  (IA)  for  the  program  loan  will  be  the \nMOI,  except  for  the  tax  incentive  measures,  which  MOF-FD \nwill coordinate with the National Board of Revenue. \n \nThe program loan will finance the full foreign exchange costs \n(excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  imports  procured  in  and \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  member  countries,  other  than  those  specified  in \nthe  list  of  ineligible  items  and  those  items  financed  by  other \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nProject Loan \n\nCost Estimates  \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nExecuting and \nImplementing Agencies  \n\nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\nto \n\nreferred \n\nmultilateral and bilateral official sources. Disbursements under \nthe  program  loan  will  be  made  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  simplified \ndisbursement  procedures  and  audit \nrequirements.  The \nBorrower will certify that the value of eligible imports exceeds \nthe  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected  disbursements  under  the \nprogram  loan  in  a  given  period.  ADB  will  have  the  right  to \naudit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of \nthe Borrower\u2019s certification. \n \nThe project loan will be provided to enhance access to credit \nby  SMEs,  especially  small  enterprises \nin \nBangladesh  as  the  \u201cmissing  middle.\u201d  These  enterprises  are \ntoo large to qualify for microcredit assistance programs of the \nGovernment  but  too  small  to  be  within  the  scope  of  current \nbank lending. The loan proceeds will be used as contribution \nto  the  Small  Enterprise  Fund  (SEF),  which  was  set  up  by \nBangladesh  Bank  (BB)  as  a  credit  facility  available  to  small \nenterprises  with  fixed  assets  of  less  than  Tk10  million.  The \nWorld  Bank  has  also  contributed  to  the  SEF.  SEF  will  be \nadministered by BB for channeling credit through participating \nfinancial institutions (PFIs) to these small enterprises.  \n \nincluding  contribution \nfrom  SME \nThe \ntotal  project  cost \nbeneficiaries  and  PFIs \nis  estimated  at  $257.8  million \nequivalent,  while  the  fund  size  of  SEF  is  $56.7  million \nequivalent.  In  addition  to  the  project  loan  of  $30  million \nequivalent, SEF will comprise $10 million equivalent from the \nWorld Bank and $16.7 million equivalent (Tk1 billion) from the \nGovernment  through  BB.  The  Government  can  increase  its \ncontribution  to  SEF  if  there  is  sufficient  demand.  The  project \nloan will be provided in foreign exchange but re-lent by BB to \nPFIs in local currency at the BB rate. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  project  loan  of  SDR19.908  million  ($30 \nmillion  equivalent)  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  with  a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with \nan  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period \nand  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The  commitment  period  for \nthe  project  loan  is  5  years  and  the  completion  date  is \nexpected to be 30 June 2010.  \n \nThe EA for the project loan will be MOF-FD and the IA will be \nBB. \n \ntaka  as \nfunds \nPFIs  will  onlend \nsubloans/subleases  to  their  SME  clients  at  their  prevailing \npricing.

The  Government  will  finance  $1.84  million  equivalent \nthrough budgetary support, and the remainder of the cost will \nbe  borne  by \nthe \nthe  private  business  sector \nFederation  of  Bangladesh  Chambers  of  Commerce  and \nIndustry  (FBCCI)  and  other  chamber  bodies  and  industry \nassociations,  SMEs,  and  PFIs,  by  payment  of  fees  and  cost-\nsharing arrangements. \n \nADB  will  provide  the  TA  loan  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8  years,  and  with  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The TA loan \ncompletion date is expected to be 31 December 2007.  \n \nThe  EA  for  the  TA  loan  will  be  MOF-FD  and  the  IA  will  be \nMOI. \n \nProcurement of goods and services will be in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Supply contracts valued at \n$100,000  equivalent  or  less  may  be  procured based  on local \nprocedures  under  the  Government\u2019s  Public  Procurement \nRegulations,  2003  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  All  consulting \nservices that are to be financed from the proceeds of the TA \nloan will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants satisfactory to ADB. \n \n\nthrough \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nSafeguard Policies  \n \n\nTechnical Assistance \nGrant \n \n\nExecuting and \nImplementing Agencies \n\nBenefits and Impact  \n\n \n\nPolicy  \n\nand \n\nframework \n\nto  ensure \n\ndevelopment \n\nAs IA for the credit facility, BB will monitor compliance of PFIs \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines,  and  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  involuntary \nresettlement  (1995)  and  indigenous  peoples  (1998).  PFIs  in \nturn  will  monitor  compliance  by  subborrowers  with  ADB \npolicies and government regulations. \n \nThe  TA  grant  will  support  program  implementation  and \ntimely  compliance  with  policy \ncoordination \nconditions  and  other  deliverables  to  achieve  the  stated \noutcomes.  The  main  tasks  under  the  TA  are  to  assist  in \nsetting up and operationalizing the institutional body for SME \nimplementation, \npolicy \nstrengthen  monitoring  and  reporting,  help  oversee \nthe \nimplementation  of  various  components  under  SMESDP  to \nenable timely corrective action if needed, build up capacity of \nthe  EA  and  IAs  in  implementing  the  activities  and  monitoring \nbenefits  of  SMESDP,  and  provide  administrative  support  to \nthe  EA  and  IAs.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  to  be \n$750,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $600,000 equivalent on \na  grant  basis  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  program.  The \nGovernment  will  contribute  $150,000  equivalent.  The  TA  will \nbe implemented over the implementation period of SMESDP. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nfor  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants  satisfactory  to \nADB. \n \nThe  EA  for  the  TA  grant  will  be  MOF-FD  and  the  IA  will  be \nMOI. \n \n \n\nSMESDP  is  central  to  the  formulation  and  implementation  of \npublic  policy  that  focuses  on  SME  development.  The  SME \npolicy  and  development  framework  will  make  government \ncommitments to the sector explicit, and lay out targeted SME \npolicy  measures  and  institutional  structure  to  guide  the \nconcerned  government  agencies  in  providing  support  to  the \nSME sector. The policy measures will rationalize government \nassistance  to  SMEs  and  facilitate  SME  access  to  credit, \nbusiness  support  services,  product  certification,  and  capacity \nbuilding. \n \n\nInstitutional Development   SMESDP will help mobilize high-level public policy support for \nSME  development.  At  the  highest  level,  the  National  Council \nfor  Industrial  Development  (NCID),  chaired  by  the  prime \nminister,  will \nfor  SME  policy  and \ndevelopment. The NCID will be assisted at the ministerial level \nby  the  Guidance  Committee  headed  by  the  minister,  MOI.  At \nthe  implementation  level,  the  SME  Cell  set  up  in  MOI  will \n\nresponsibility \n\ntake \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\nSME Financing  \n\nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nimplement  the  action  program  to  be  developed  by  the  SME \nAdvisory  Panel  to  support  implementation  of  the  SME  policy \nand development framework. Subsequently, over the medium \nterm, SMESDP will assist in establishing and operationalizing \nthe SME Foundation in the form of a public-private partnership \nto  be  a  dedicated  agency  responsible  for  SME  development \non  a  sustainable  basis.  Further,  the  Program  will  support \nstudies  for  improving  the  effectiveness,  restructuring,  and \nstrategic  reorientation  of  concerned  agencies  under  MOI  that \ninterface with and provide services to SMEs. \n \nSmall  enterprises  will  have  better  access  to  credit  through \nSEF.  The  Program  will  also  enhance  capabilities  of  PFIs  in \nextending  credit  to  SMEs  by  assisting  PFIs  in establishing  or \nstrengthening  their  SME  financing  operations  and  training \nabout 1,000 SME credit staff of PFIs as well as other financial \ninstitutions  intending  to  engage  in  lending  to  SMEs,  on  SME \nfinancing,  project  appraisal  and  supervision,  and  credit  and \nportfolio  administration  of  small  loans.  Capacity  building  of \nSME  credit  staff  will  strengthen  their  abilities  to  assess  SME \ncredit  applications  as  well  as  facilitate  provision  of  business \ndevelopment  services  (BDS)  to  SMEs.  PFIs  are  expected  to \nhave  more  focus  on  the  SME  business  segment,  strengthen \ntheir  SME  unit,  and  expand  their  SME  loan  portfolio.  PFI \nfinancial  assistance  will  allow  the  SMEs  to  strengthen  their \ncompetitiveness and to be commercially viable. It is estimated \nthat there will be about 10,000 subloans/subleases that will be \nmade  out  of  SEF.  In  addition,  lending  to  SMEs  will  have  a \nstrong  linkage  impact  on  BDS  providers  who  would  be \nresponding  to  generated  demand  for  their  services  and  PFI \nreferrals. \n \n \nSMESDP  will  contribute  to  the  country\u2019s  goal  of  raising  real \neconomic  growth,  generate  employment,  and \nthereby \ncontribute  to  reducing  poverty  incidence.  Overall,  during  the \nprogram  period  FY2005\u2013FY2007,  employment  in  the  SME \nsector is expected to rise by at least 8% per annum. \n \nIt is estimated that during the TA loan implementation period, \nover  8,000  participants  from  SMEs,  including  about  2,000 \nwomen,  will  undergo  training  to  be  conducted  by  the  Small \nand  Cottage  Industries  Training  Institute  in  collaboration  with \nFBCCI,  and  its  district  chambers  and  line  associations.  Over \n12,000  displaced  workers  are  expected  to  undergo  retraining \nprograms  and  at  least  50%  are  projected  to  be  re-employed \nduring  the  program  period.  It  is  also  expected  that  about \n150,000  entrepreneurs  or  individuals  interested  in  setting  up \nan  enterprise  will  take  advantage  of  the  services  of  the \nhelpline  outreach  centers  established  as  public-private \npartnerships  under  the  Program.

SMESDP  will  enable  them \nto have greater participation in the formulation of SME-related \npolices  and  action  plans,  and  better  access  to  information, \ncredit, and BDS. \n \nSMESDP  complements  ongoing  and  planned  activities  of \nother development partners, in particular as regards BDS and \nprivate sector development. The interventions under SMESDP \nwere  closely  coordinated  with  the  Local  Consultative  Group \ncomposed  of  all  development  partners  active  in  the  SME \nsector in Bangladesh.  \n \nDrawing  from  past  experience,  despite  possible  changes  in \nthe  Government,  it  is  presumed  that  Bangladesh  will  pursue \nthe  required  reforms,  based  on  high-level  government \ncommitment.  \n \nThe  program  implementation  risks  have  been  addressed \nthrough  institutional  mechanisms  that  involve  all  tiers  in  the \nGovernment,  including  the  NCID  at  the  top  policy  level,  the \nGuidance  Committee  at \nthe \ndedicated  SME  Cell  (over  the  medium  term,  the  SME \nFoundation)  at  the  implementation  level.  Direct  oversight  of \nspecific program, project, and TA components will be provided \nthrough the CPCU organized under the EA. The TA grant will \nprovide  capacity-building  assistance \nthe \ncapabilities  of  counterpart  staff  to  implement  the  policy \nmeasures,  and  support  the  EA  and  IAs  in  terms  of  program \ncoordination  and  monitoring  activities,  as  well  as  PFIs  in \nmonitoring  benefits  from  subloans/subleases  financed  under \nSEF.

The report also \ndescribes  a  proposed  TA  for  Supporting  Program  Implementation  and  Coordination  of \nSMESDP, and if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated \nto me by the Board, will approve the proposed TA.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n1. \n\nMacroeconomic Performance  \n\n \n2. \nBangladesh  achieved  a  steady  5%  growth  rate  of  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \nduring  the  1990s,  as  compared  with  4%  in  the  1980s.  The  growth  of  per  capita  real  GDP \naccelerated from 1.7% per annum in the 1980s to 3.1% in the 1990s. The growth in the 1990s \nwas attributable to the reforms to move Bangladesh toward an open economy, such as making \nthe  currency  convertible  on  the  current  account,  reducing  import  duties,  removing  controls  on \nthe  movements  of  foreign  private  capital,  and  introducing  value-added  tax.  The  Bangladesh \neconomy became more closely integrated with the global economy, with its trade doubling over \nthe 1990s to reach 31% of GDP by 2001. The industry and services sectors each contributed \nabout 41%, and agriculture about 18%, to incremental GDP growth in the 1990s compared with \nthe  1980s.  Unlike  the  1980s,  when  the  rapid  shift  of  labor  into  the  rural  nonfarm  sector  was \nlargely  in  the  form  of  self-employment,  the  1990s  witnessed  the  absorption  of  wage  labor  in \ngreater numbers by relatively larger-scale enterprises. These enterprises were at the higher end \nof  the  productivity  scale  compared  with  the  self-employed  form  of  enterprises  in  the  earlier \nyears.1  Reflecting  higher  economic  growth  and  increased  employment  generation,  the  poverty \nrate declined from 59% to 50% between 1991 and 2000.  \n \n3. \nThe Government has progressively moved away from administered interest rates toward \nmarket-based rates. The disproportionately high interest rates offered by the National Savings \nCertificates2  that  crowded  out  long-term  borrowing  by  financial  institutions  (FIs)  and  private \nsector  borrowers  have  been  reduced  toward  closer  alignment  with  comparable  market  rates. \nDespite  these  efforts,  spreads  between  lending  and  deposit  rates  remain  high  due  to  the \nnonperforming  loan  (NPL)  problem  in  the  banking  system,  which  is  being  addressed  by  the \nGovernment.  The  Government  is  also  developing  a  market  for  government  securities  and \nsignificantly reduced the withholding tax on income from securities and bonds.3 On the foreign \nexchange market, the taka was floated in May 2003 and the exchange rate is managed flexibly, \nwith interventions confined to countering disorderly conditions.  \n\n                                                 \n1   Osmani,  S.

The  Government  will  have  to \naccelerate  economic  growth  to  about  7%  per  year  over  the  next  decade  to  reduce  poverty  in \nhalf  by  2015  in  accordance  with  the  Millennium  Development  Goals.5  In  comparison,  annual \nGDP  growth  was  5.3%  in  FY2003,  5.5%  in  FY 2004,  and  is  projected at  5%  for  FY2005.  The \nIMF  PRGF  target  is  6%  for  FY2006\u2013FY2008.  The  IMF  PRGF  together  with  the  Development \nSupport  Credit  I  and  II  projects  of  the  World  Bank  (WB)  also  provide  policy  support  in  the \nfinancial  sector,  including  preparation  for  privatization  of  and  management  support  for  the \nnationalized  commercial  banks  (NCBs)  and  issuance  of  prudential  regulations.  In  July  2004, \nIMF  completed  the  second  review  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  economic  performance  under  PRGF  and \napproved  a  release  of  SDR49.5  million  (about  $72  million)  as  well  as  an  augmentation  of  the \nPRGF,  amounting  to  SDR53.33  million  (about  $78  million),  for  the  Trade  Integration \nMechanism.6 \n \n\n2. \n\nBusiness Environment and Private Sector Development \n\n \n5. \nDespite higher economic growth during the 1990s, Bangladesh still lagged behind other \ncountries in the region such as India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Various studies carried out under \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) TA in 20027 and 2003,8 an investment climate assessment by \nthe  WB,9  the  2003  National  Private  Sector  Survey  of  Enterprises  in  Bangladesh  (the  2003 \nPrivate  Sector  Survey),10  and  surveys  by  the  Federation  of  Bangladesh  Chambers  of \nCommerce  and \nthe  country\u2019s \ncompetitiveness  and  economic  growth,  including  inadequacies  in  infrastructure  facilities \n(particularly power,  gas,  and  port  facilities),  corruption  and  \u201cinvisible\u201d  costs,  deficiencies  in  the \nlegal and regulatory framework, and lack of access to finance by businesses.  \n \n6. \nNevertheless,  the  Government  has  taken  several  policy  initiatives  to  improve  the \ninvestment  climate.  The  I-PRSP  recognizes  the  private  sector  as  the  engine  of  economic \ngrowth.  The  1999  Industrial  Policy  eliminated  restrictions  on  private  sector  participation  in  all \n\nIndustry  (FBCCI) have \n\nidentified  major \n\nimpediments \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n4   The full poverty reduction strategy paper is currently being prepared; its completion is expected by end-2004. \n5   Poverty reduction targets are set at 35% in 2010 and 25% in 2015 with 2000 as the base year. \n6   The IMF Trade Integration Mechanism was introduced in April 2004 to assist member countries to meet balance of \npayments  shortfalls  that  might  result  from  multilateral  trade  liberalization.  It  is  not  a  special  lending  facility,  but \nrather a policy designed to make resources more predictably available under existing IMF facilities. \n\n7   \u201cStrategic  Issues  and  Potential  Response  in  the  Enterprise  Sector:  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Development \nand  Export  Expansion,\u201d  November  2002,  a  report  under  TA  3698  (ADB.  2002.

The foreign direct investment regime is also liberal, although the bulk of direct \ninvestment from abroad has been in the gas and power subsectors. With regard to trade reform, \nthe Government has introduced a three-tier tariff structure with the maximum rate having been \nreduced from 30% to 25%. The average tariff and the number of products subject to quantitative \nrestrictions have also been reduced. Import-licensing requirements have been streamlined. The \nGovernment  has  introduced  export  promotion  measures  and  at  the  same  time  developed  a \ncomprehensive  plan  to  cope  with  the  phaseout  of  the  Multi-Fibre  Arrangement  (MFA)  at  end-\n2004, which will adversely affect textiles and garments, the strategic exports of Bangladesh.  \n \n7. \nReforms  are  also  under  way  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector \ndevelopment  and  development  partners,  including  ADB,  are  providing  continuing  support  for \ninfrastructure  development.11  To  tackle  the  issue  of  corruption  and  rent-seeking  behavior  of \npublic officials, the Government set up the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) under the ACC \nAct passed in February 2004. The WB\u2019s Development Support Credit I and II projects as well as \nthe  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  TA12  provide  support  for  the  establishment  of  the  ACC.  In  addition,  the \nGovernment is promoting e-governance and introducing the use of computers and web sites in \nall  ministries  and  sector  corporations  to  enhance  transparency  and  expedite  administrative \nprocesses.  \n \n\n3. \n\nRole and Characteristics of the Small and Medium Enterprise Sector \n\n \n8. \nIt  is  generally  recognized  that  SMEs  have  a  significant  role  in  generating  growth  and \nemployment.  SMEs  account  for  about  40%  of  gross  manufacturing  output,  about  80%  of \nindustrial employment, and about 25% of the total labor force in Bangladesh. Preliminary figures \nbased  on  the  2001\u20132003  Census  of  Non-Farm  Economic  Activities  (Urban  and  Rural)  [the \nEconomic Census], which excludes agriculture, fisheries, and forestry, estimate the number of \npersons employed by SMEs at 1.72 million, which is about 45% of the total number employed in \nnonfarm  small,  medium,  and  large establishments.  The  2003  Private  Sector  Survey  estimated \nthat  micro,  small,  and  medium  enterprises  contributed  around  20\u201325%  of  GDP.  Given  the \ncritical  role  of  SMEs  in  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  it  is  imperative  that  the \nGovernment develop and implement targeted policy measures to address specific constraints to \nSMEs to enable them to realize their full potential and contribute more effectively to economic \ngrowth and employment generation. \n \n9. \nDefinition of SMEs. The Industrial Policy 1999 defines SMEs as enterprises employing \nfewer  than  99  workers  and/or  with  a  fixed  capital  investment  under  Tk300  million.  \u201cSmall \nindustry\u201d refers to enterprises (excluding cottage units) employing fewer than 50 workers and/or \nwith  a  fixed  capital  investment  of  less  than  Tk100  million  while  \u201cmedium  industry\u201d  covers \nenterprises  employing  between  50  to  99  workers  and/or  with  a  fixed  capital  investment  of \nbetween Tk100 million and Tk300 million. However, this definition has the second highest upper \nlimit on fixed assets for SMEs in South Asia and Southeast Asia, after Singapore, and does not \naccurately  reflect  the  size  of  SMEs.  The  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics  (BBS)  classifies \nenterprises solely according to total persons employed or \u201cengaged\u201d (including proprietor) in the \nEconomic Census. Development partners involved in the SME sector have different definitions \nof  SMEs.  The  major  commercial  banks  follow  the  Industrial  Policy  definition  in  terms  of \n                                                 \n11  ADB\u2019s projects include among others, construction of roads and transport infrastructure, development of the power \n\nand gas sector, and improvement in efficiency of Chittagong Port. \n\n12  ADB.  2003.

The  lack  of  any  single  standard  definition  makes  it \ndifficult to interpret data on SMEs and target assistance for SME sector development. \n \n10. \nPopulation  of  SMEs.  There  are  varying  estimates  of  the  SME  population  in  line  with \ndifferent  definitions  of  SMEs.  Based  on  the  Economic  Census,  the  total  number  of  SMEs13  is \nestimated at 79,754 establishments, of which 93.6% are small and 6.4% are medium. The 2003 \nPrivate Sector Survey estimated about 6 million micro, small, and medium enterprises defined \nas enterprises with fewer than 100 employees.  \n \nB. \n \n11.  Most  of  the  key  impediments  to  the  development  of  the  SME  sector  are  linked  to \nstructural  problems  in  the  business  environment.  ADB  and  other  development  partners  are \naddressing  issues  in  private  sector  and  financial  sector  development.  While  these  problems \naffect all enterprises irrespective of size, SMEs are disproportionately affected due to their small \nscale of operations and more limited resources to address the problems. Complementary to the \ngovernment initiatives and other development partner programs, the proposed SMESDP aims at \nintroducing policy reforms and creating support infrastructure targeted at SMEs to enhance their \ncapabilities  and  facilitate  their  access  to  the  necessary  resources  to  deal  with  the  regulatory, \ncredit, capacity, and other key issues that they are facing owing to policy and market failures. \nSector  analysis  and  framework  for  SME  development,  including  government  initiatives  and \ndevelopment  agency-funded  programs,  are  summarized  below  with  details  included  in \nAppendix 3. \n \n\n1. \n\nPresent Challenges for Small and Medium Enterprises \n\na. \n\nAccess to Credit \n\n \n \n \nLack of SME Access to Credit. Financial constraint was cited most frequently as a key \n12. \nproblem during startup and operations as reflected in the 2003 Private Sector Survey. Problems \nare more pronounced for small enterprises predominantly in the informal sector that are in the \nso-called \u201cmissing middle.\u201d These enterprises, some of which have graduated from microcredit \nprograms,  are  no  longer  considered  microenterprises  and  are  ineligible  for  financing  from \nnongovernment  organizations  and  microcredit \nfrom  government  special \nassistance programs. On the other hand, they are not large enough to fall within the scope of \ncurrent bank lending. Banks view SMEs as relatively higher credit risks, and expected returns \ndo  not  justify  the  high  administrative  and  servicing  costs  of  small  loans.  SMEs  are  normally \nrequired to assign real or other immovable properties as collateral to secure their obligation, a \ncondition  that  most  SMEs  find  difficult  to  comply  with.  Further,  lack  of  suitable  lending \nmodalities,  and  limited  capability  of  SME  credit  staff  to  appraise  SMEs\u2019  cash-flow-generating \ncapacity is another reason for the predominance of collateral-based lending.  \n \n13. \nSecured Financing. Lack of ownership of land or immovable property as collateral for \nbank  financing  poses  a  constraint  to  SME  access  to  credit.  Secured  financing  backed  by \nmovable  property  (e.g.,  equipment,  vehicles,  and  other  non-land  assets)  as  security  would \ngenerally be preferred by SMEs, as they typically own movable property. However, the secured \nfinancing  sector  in  Bangladesh  covering  leasing  companies  is  quite  small  with  limited  growth \npotential due to lack of a legal and institutional framework for secured transactions. Currently, \n\ninstitutions  or \n\n                                                 \n13  In  the  Economic  Census,  microenterprises  are  defined  as  those  with  total  number  of  persons  employed  of  less \nthan 10, small enterprises with 10 to 49, medium enterprises with 50 to 99, and large enterprises with 100 or more. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nthere is no law specifically providing for taking movable property as security for a loan. Security \ninterests in movable property are created by contract, creating unnecessary litigation and delay. \nThe  current  law  does  not  provide  for  priority  of  creditor  interests;  thus,  loan  recovery  typically \ninvolves  long  and  costly  litigation  to  determine  interests  of  creditors.  Moreover,  there  is  no \ncomprehensive  registry  system  in  Bangladesh.  Not  all  security  interests  can  be  registered, \nposing a limitation on secured lending. Coverage of the current registry system at the Registrar \nof  Joint  Stock  Companies  (RJSC),  restricted  to  limited  companies,  excludes  from  secured \nfinancing  SMEs  that  are  not  in  corporate  form,  although  these  constitute  the  majority  of \nin  excessive  delay  and  creates \nenterprises.  The  manual  registration  system  results \nopportunities for corrupt practices. \n \n14.  Market  Failures  in  SME  Financing.  In  the  absence  of  a  long-term  market  for  debt \nfunds, availability of medium- to long-term credit is limited. Although there is excess liquidity in \nthe market, a significant portion is lodged with NCBs that are facing chronic NPL problems and \nhave  been  restricted  by  Bangladesh  Bank  (BB)  to  limit  their  credit  portfolio  growth  to  5% \nannually  in  order  to  contain  their  losses.  In  the  absence  of  an  effective  interbank  market,  this \nexcess  liquidity  in  NCBs  does  not  readily  flow  to  the  private  commercial  banks  (PCBs)  or \nnonbank financial institutions (NBFIs). Moreover, NBFIs are limited in their scope for accepting \ndeposits  while  PCBs  and  leasing  companies  have  limited  term  funds  due  to  an  inability  to \nengage  in  asset/liability  mismatches  by  using  short-term  deposits  for  medium-  to  long-term \nlending in the absence of liquidity support from BB and without a repo market. In addition, cash \nreserves are required to be met on a daily basis while the inefficient payments system makes \nmonitoring and adjusting liquidity positions highly cumbersome and difficult. Furthermore, even \nif  many  NBFIs  are  keen  to  engage  in  SME  financing,  loans  from  NCBs  are  available  at  rates \nthat,  owing  to  the  high  NPL  level,  make  SME  financing  unprofitable  or  marginally  profitable. \nTheir relatively high costs of capital limit the expansion of their SME loan portfolio.  \n \n\nNeed  to  Rationalize  Present  Government  Support  for  Small  and \nMedium Enterprises \n\nb. \n\n \n\n15. \nAlthough SME development has been included in the Industrial Policy, there are neither \nsignificant  specific  policy  measures  nor  specific  institutional  support  to  establish  an  enabling \nframework  at  a  policy  level,  resulting  in  costly  and  inefficient  implementation  of  SME \ndevelopment  initiatives. SMEs  are  typically  in  a  disadvantaged  position  to  benefit  from  neutral \nbusiness-friendly  policies  compared  with  large  enterprises.  Targeted  policy  interventions  are \nnecessary to improve access of SMEs to market opportunities, financing, technology, expertise, \nand  information.  There  is  also  an  evident  need  to  create  an  institutional  mechanism  that  can \neffectively coordinate and implement SME-related policies.  \n \n16. \nThe Government provides business support and capacity-building assistance as well as \ninfrastructure  facilities  to  SMEs,  mainly  through  the  Bangladesh  Small  and  Cottage  Industries \nCorporation (BSCIC). Founded in 1957 by legislation as the principal government organization \nmandated  to  promote  the  development  of  countrywide  small  and  cottage  industries  (SCIs), \nBSCIC  is  responsible  for  (i) allotment  of  developed  industrial  estates  in  64  districts  in \nBangladesh; (ii) entrepreneurship development training programs conducted by its training arm, \nSmall  and  Cottage  Industries  Training  Institute  (SCITI);  (iii) credit  arrangement  and  end-use \nsupervision;  (iv) design,  development,  and  distribution  of  prototypes  through  its  design  center; \n(v) research  and  development  activities;  (vi) management  and  skills  development;  and \n(vii) market study and marketing assistance (e.g., trade fairs).  \n \n\n \n\n\f 6\n\nHowever,  BSCIC  has  failed  to  fulfill  its  mandate  due  mainly  to  lack  of  a  clear  focus, \n17. \nburden  of  managing  many  nonperforming  industrial  estates,  weak  management  deputed  from \nthe  civil  service  system  with  lack  of  understanding  of  SMEs,  and  shortage  of  well-trained \nprofessionals. Currently, there is no cost recovery in the use of public resources in the estates \nor in almost all of the services provided by BSCIC, while training participants pay only a nominal \nfee for its training programs. BSCIC is overstaffed with 3,244 people. In FY2004, the revenue \nbudget  of  BSCIC  was  Tk248  million.  Low  revenues  coupled  with  high  operating  costs  have \nresulted in substantial accumulated operating losses of Tk660 million or about $10.1 million over \nthe past 10 years. A parliamentary subcommittee was formed to address the issue of operating \nlosses while the Ministry of Industries (MOI) has set up a committee to study human resource \nrestructuring  at  BSCIC.  To  move  BSCIC  toward  a  leaner  and  more  effective  organization,  the \ncommittee proposed human resource rationalization, including downsizing field offices and the \nhead office.  \n \n18. \nSince  its  establishment  in  1985,  SCITI  has  conducted  training  courses for  over  24,000 \nparticipants,  mostly  existing  and  potential  entrepreneurs  and  managers  of  SCI  enterprises. \nHowever,  SCITI  has  very  limited  outreach  with  more  than  two  thirds  of  its  training  programs \nconducted at its premises in Dhaka. Although SCITI has carried out training programs in other \nparts of the country in collaboration with BSCIC\u2019s respective local offices and industrial service \ncenters, the implementation of these programs was ineffective due to a meager budget, lack of \nqualified  faculty  members  and  trainers,  and  lack  of  training  facilities.  There  is  a  need  to \nstrengthen  SCITI\u2019s  capacity  to  deliver  its  training  services  to  SMEs  on  a  sustained  basis. \n(Profiles  of  BSCIC  and  other  public  institutions  serving  SMEs  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix 6.) \n \n19. \nPublic institutions including BB, NCBs, and specialized financial institutions, engaged in \nextending  loans  to  the  agriculture  and  industry  sectors,  currently  have  financing  facilities  for \nSMEs,  the  performance  and  effectiveness  of  which  have  been  uneven.  These  facilities  have \nvarying  features  and  terms.  Some  are  targeted  at  certain  industries  or  subject  to  limited \ngeographic  coverage.  BB\u2019s  Rural-based  Agro-Processing  Industries  Refinancing  Facility, \noriginally set up for Tk1.5 billion, had a low utilization rate owing mainly to the restriction on use \nof funds to agro-processing industries located outside the major cities; consequently, the size of \nthe facility was later reduced to Tk0.5 billion and Tk1 billion was reallocated to set up the Small \nEnterprise Fund (SEF). The Entrepreneurship Enterprise Fund was set up by BB in FY2001 as a \nventure  capital  fund  to  co-invest  in  projects  in  software,  food  processing,  and  agro-based \nindustries.  Since  its  establishment,  the  utilization  rate  has  averaged  about  one  fourth  of  the \nbudget allocated in each fiscal year. The Government is exploring an exit strategy for its equity \nshareholding in the enterprises cofinanced under the Entrepreneurship Enterprise Fund. Some \ncredit facilities provided by NCBs and specialized financial institutions impose ceiling on loans to \nsubborrowers  in  certain  sectors,  such  as  agricultural  credit,  thus  distorting  interest  rates  and \nfurther  exacerbating  the  vulnerable  financial  position  of  these  entities.  There  is  no  indicator  to \nmeasure  the  effectiveness,  outreach,  or  impact  of  these  facilities.  Thus,  a  study  needs  to  be \nconducted  to  identify  ways  to  rationalize  the  existing  government  assistance  and  to  ensure \nefficient and effective delivery mechanisms. \n \n\nc. \n\nIncentives \n\n \n20. \nThe  tax  system  in  Bangladesh  provides  incentives  to  promote  exports.  For  example,  a \nspecial income tax rate of 10% is provided for the readymade garment (RMG) industry and 15% \nfor textile and jute industries up to June 2006, compared with a normal rate of 37.5%. With the \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nexception of very small enterprises classified as \u201ccottage industries,\u201d14 which are exempted from \nvalue-added  tax  on  an  extensive  list  of  items,  no  special  tax  treatment  is  given  to  SMEs.  To \nrelieve  the  tax  burden  of  newly  established  enterprises,  the  Government  has  provided  tax \nholidays for all manufacturing or service enterprises, irrespective of size, if they are established \nbefore June 2005. These enterprises can register with the National Board of Revenue (NBR) to \nbe exempted from income tax for 5 years if they are located in major cities such as Dhaka and \nChittagong  and  for  7  years  for  those  located  in  other  cities.  The  abolition  of  the  tax  holiday \nscheme,  which  is  expected  to  be  approved  by  the  Government  in  the  next  fiscal  year,  will \nadversely  affect  small  enterprises  to  a  greater  extent  than  larger  enterprises  because  of  their \nlimited  income-generating  capacity to  absorb  high  startup  costs.  Tax  and  customs  procedures \nare  also  cumbersome  and  involve  high  informal  payments,  reflecting  additional  compliance \ncosts and posing a barrier for SME entry into the formal sector.  \n \n\nd. \n\nRegistration, Licensing, Tax, and Other Requirements  \n\n \n21. \nThe  establishment  of  an  enterprise  in  general  requires  a  trade  license  from  local \ngovernment  bodies,  registration  under  the  Factories  Act  with  the  Department  of  Inspection  of \nFactories and Establishments of the Ministry of Labor, registration for value-added tax and a tax \nidentification  number  with  NBR,  and  environmental  clearance  from  the  Department  of \nEnvironment  of  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forest.  Compliance  complexity  increases  as \nthe business becomes a legal entity and seeks registration for access to government incentives. \nIf  an  enterprise  is  to  be  incorporated  as  a  company,  registration  with  RJSC  is  required. \nInvestment  registration  with  the  Board  of  Investments  will  be  required  for  access  to  capital \nmachinery import incentives in the form of import duty and tax exemptions, and to infrastructure \nfacilities  such  as  utility  (water,  electricity,  and  telecommunications)  and  land  (e.g.,  industrial \nestates managed by BSCIC or Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority). The processes \nto  meet  these  requirements  usually  involve  unnecessary  delays,  harassment,  and  side \npayments. The information gap has been identified as the key constraint in obtaining certificates \nor  licenses  from  any  of  these  regulatory  agencies.  Awareness  and  understanding  of \ndocumentation requirements, steps to be followed, and fees to be paid will help entrepreneurs \nto  be  prepared  and  make  it  more  difficult  for  officials  or  brokers  to  take  advantage  of  the \nentrepreneurs\u2019  lack  of  knowledge.  The  delays  in  the  processes  are  also  caused  by  manual \nsystems at many of these public service institutions and duplication of procedures.  \n  \n\ne. \n\nMarket for Business Development Services \n\n \nSMEs  operating  outside  the  urban  centers  do  not  have  ready  access  to  business \n22. \ndevelopment  services  (BDS)  providers.  BDS  are  generally  regarded  as  unaffordable  by  this \nsubsector.  The  BDS  market  is  still  fragmented  and  unorganized  with  few  privately  owned \norganizations  providing  BDS.  Some  started  as  projects  funded  by  development  partners.15 \nMany of the training and capacity-building programs are neither demand-driven nor specifically \ntargeted  at  certain  groups  of  SMEs  that  are  disadvantaged,  such  as  those  in  rural  areas  and \nthose headed by women entrepreneurs. Moreover, retraining programs are also needed for the \ndisplaced  RMG  workers  due  to  the  phaseout  of  the  MFA  by  end-2004.  It  is  estimated  that  at \n\n                                                 \n14  Cottage  industries  in  this  context  are  defined  by  the  NBR  as  enterprises  that  have  (i) investments  in  capital \nmachinery of less than Tk500,000, (ii) annual turnover of less than Tk2 million, and (iii) no production in the name \nof any brand belonging to others.  \n\n15  These  include  Micro  Industries  Development  Assistance  and  Services  (MIDAS),  the  Bangladesh  Advisory \nServices Center funded by USAID, and the Business Advisory Services training center at the Dhaka Chamber of \nCommerce  and  Industry  supported  by  the  German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  with  funding  from  the \nGerman Government. \n\n\f 8\n\nleast  200,000  RMG  workers,  over  85%  of  whom  are  women,  need  retraining  to  be  able  to \nreenter the gainfully employed labor pool. Further, Bangladesh needs to diversify its know-how \nand technology away from core garment industries to lessen external shocks and better equip \nthe country to cope with the changing market environment.  \n \n23. \nSome  FIs  provide  basic  advisory  services  to  their  clients,  or  make  BDS  arrangements \nwith  service  providers  to  assist  enterprises  that  they  finance.16  Generic  training  courses  on \ncredit  management  and  core  banking  and  on  finance  subjects  are  conducted  at  the  training \ncenter  of  BB  and  the  Bangladesh  Institute  of  Bank  Management.  However,  to  extend  FIs\u2019 \nlending to the SME sector, there is a need to build up capacity of SME credit staff to provide in-\nhouse basic advisory services and \u201chandholding\u201d assistance to SMEs, including preparation of \nbusiness plan and bankable proposals.  \n \n\nf. \n\nProduct Certification System \n\n \n24. \nThe Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI), an autonomous organization \nunder  MOI,  is  responsible  for  setting  national  standards  for  industrial,  food,  and  chemical \nproducts; conducting product testing; and issuing product certification. BSTI\u2019s certification mark \nis  mandatory  for  an  extensive  list  of  items  to  assure  quality  of  products  and  to  protect \nconsumers. There is no accreditation system to allow for services of private sector accreditation \nbodies. BSTI\u2019s monopoly and lengthy procedures led to the practice of side payments to obtain \ncertificates.  Thus,  BSTI\u2019s  seal  of  quality  has  not  gained  credibility  either  at  home  or  abroad, \nimpeding  the  ability  of  exporters  to  market  their  products.  To  meet  importers\u2019  requirements, \nenterprises  have  to  go  through  expensive  and  time-consuming  processes  to  seek  certificates \nfrom  foreign  certification  bodies.  Many  SMEs  do  not  comply  with  product  certification \nrequirements  due  to  their  ignorance  and  weak  enforcement  capacity  of  BSTI.  This  limits  their \npotential to broaden their client base to overseas markets.  \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment  Policy  Support  for  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Sector \nDevelopment  \n\n \n25. \nIndustrial Policy. The promotion of pro-poor growth propelled by the private sector as \nstated  under  the  I-PRSP  will  have  to  be  supported  by  appropriate  macroeconomic  and  sector \npolicies.  The  new  Industrial  Policy,  in  its  final  draft  form,  covers  (i) roles  of  MOI  and  other \nrelevant agencies including BSCIC, Board of Investments, and Bangladesh Export Processing \nZone Authority, in promoting the development of industries, particularly those with strong growth \npotential;  (ii) promotion  of  exports  and  foreign  direct  investment;  and  (iii) privatization  of  state-\nowned  enterprises.  With  renewed  interest  in  SME  development,  it  now  highlights  the  priority \ngiven  to  the  development  of  the  SME  sector,  and,  drawing  upon  the  recommendations  of  the \nnational  Task  Force  on  Development  of  SMEs  [the  SME  Task  Force]  (para.  27),  outlines  the \nGovernment\u2019s  development  strategy  for  the  SME  sector.  Key  elements  of  the  strategy  cover, \namong  other \nto  ensure  proper \nindustrialization  of  SMEs;  (ii) providing  tax  incentives  to  SMEs;  (iii) simplifying  laws  and \nregulations;  (iv) using  e-commerce  to  develop  production  and  marketing;  (v) establishing  an \ninformation  bank  to  provide  market  opportunities  and  trade  information;  (vi) improving  supply \nchain management to foster subcontracting and linkages between SMEs and larger enterprises; \n\nthe  role  of  public  agencies \n\nthings,  (i) strengthening \n\n                                                 \n16  BRAC  Bank,  a  PCB,  has  its  own  field  staff  trained  to  provide  advice  to  its  borrowers  on  basic  business  plan \ndevelopment  and  has  a  partnership  with  the  Job  Opportunities  and  Business  Support  program  of  USAID  for \nprovision of BDS, while MIDAS Financing, an NBFI, taps the resources of its parent company, MIDAS, for delivery \nof BDS. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nand (vii) conducting a survey to analyze and identify industries with growth potential. The new \nIndustrial Policy does not provide details for this SME development strategy but refers instead to \nthe SME policy and development framework. However, the revised definition of SMEs has been \nincorporated. According to this definition, to be made generally applicable, (i) for manufacturing, \nsmall enterprises are those with fixed investment less than or equal to Tk15 million and medium \nenterprises  with  fixed  investment  greater  than  Tk15  million  and  less  than  or  equal  to  Tk100 \nmillion,17 while (ii) for nonmanufacturing, small enterprises are those with fewer than 25 full-time \nemployees, and medium enterprises with between 25 and 100 full-time employees.  \n \n26. \nPreparation of SME Policy and Development Framework. There is global consensus \nrecognizing  the  role  of  SMEs  as  engines  for  growth,  employment,  and  poverty  reduction,  and \nthe  need  to  design  SME  policies  in  the  context  of  a  coherent  and  integrated  approach  to \neconomic growth and social development.18 SME development requires a crosscutting strategy \nthat touches on such areas as macroeconomic policies, business environment, legal framework, \nand finance, and that is integrated into the broader national development and poverty reduction \nstrategy. \n \n27. \nIn line with such a consensus and to prioritize specific elements of SME policies from the \nBangladesh  perspective,  the  Government  established  the  SME  Task  Force  on  5  November \n2003. The SME Task Force\u2014comprising 16 members from the Government, academia, and the \nprivate  sector,  and  chaired  by  the  principal  secretary,  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office\u2014held  a  national \nworkshop  on  20  February  2004  and  prepared  the  Report  on  Development  of  SMEs.19    The \nReport, endorsed by the prime minister and submitted to the Economic Affairs Committee of the \nCabinet  in  October  2004,  contains  policy  recommendations  with  timeframe  to  create  an \nenabling  environment  conducive  to  SME  development.  Key  components  are  declaration  of \nSMEs as a priority sector, an institutional framework, various incentives, and capacity building \nand  human  resource  development  measures.  These  recommendations  will  form  the  basis  for \nframing the Government\u2019s policy vis-\u00e0-vis the SME sector, which will be completed in 2005 and \nimplemented by an action program (paras. 39\u201340). \n \n\n3. \n\nDevelopment  Agency-Funded  Programs  that  Impact  on  the  Small  and \nMedium Enterprise Sector \n\n \n\na.  \n\nFinancial Market Development \n\n \n28. \nReforms in the Banking Sector. The ongoing reforms will help address market failures \nin  SME  financing.  The  restructuring  of  NCBs  has  been  initiated  and  will  be  supported  by  the \nWB\u2019s Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization (EGBM) project, which will assist in preparing \nstrategies  for  resolution  of  problems  of  NCBs,  improve  governance  arrangements,  and  divest \nthe  Government\u2019s  shares  in  the  NCBs.  Amendments  of  relevant  laws  have  been  made  to \nstrengthen  BB\u2019s  oversight  of  the  banking  sector  and  ensure  its  autonomy  over  monetary  and \n\n                                                 \n17  Fixed  capital  assets,  valued  at  replacement  cost  based  on  current  market  prices,  include  plant,  machinery, \nbuilding,  and  structures.  Land  is  excluded  primarily  because  in  Bangladesh,  land  values  in  urban  areas  are \ndisproportionately high relative to the other productive assets of enterprises and distort their balance sheet. \n\n18  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 2000.

ADB  and  other  development  partners  participated  and  provided  comments  on  the  draft \nreport. \n\n\f 10\n\nexchange rate policies. Stricter prudential regulations have been introduced, including increased \ncapital adequacy requirements and revisions to loan classification and provisioning guidelines.  \n \n29. \nDevelopment of Capital Market. ADB has provided assistance to strengthen the legal \nand regulatory framework as well as oversight of the securities markets. It has also been closely \ninvolved in reforming the Bangladesh domestic capital market and in enhancing the role of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission as a regulator.20 Further, the WB\u2019s Financial Institutions \nDevelopment  project,  which  includes  a  component  to  facilitate  FIs\u2019  issuance  of  securities  and \nsecuritization of their loan/lease portfolios, has achieved some progress.21 \n \n30. \nSecured Financing. To support secured financing as part of good governance initiatives \nas  well  as  SME  development,  ADB  is  providing  assistance  for  legal  and  registry  reforms  to \nfacilitate secured transactions.  22 The draft secured transaction law is being prepared and has \nbeen  discussed  among  stakeholders,  while  the  registry  reform  will  cover  development  of  an \noverall architecture for a transparent, electronic registration system. \n \nFinancial Reporting. The Government has acknowledged that in the long term it has to \n31. \nimplement  recommendations  identified  in  the  Report  on  the  Observance  of  Standards  and \nCodes23  including  simplification  of  financial  reporting  standards  for  SMEs.  WB  is  providing \nassistance in strengthening accounting and auditing practices in the corporate sector under an \neconomic management TA program. \n \n\nb. \n\nRegistration, Licensing, and Tax Requirements \n\n \nTo  facilitate  issuance  of  trade  license  in  Dhaka,  Dhaka  City  Corporation  set  up  a  help \n32. \ndesk at FBCCI and has been working toward developing a simple form of application with fewer \ncertifications required for issuing a trade license. It has introduced automatic annual renewal of \ntrade  license  up  to  5  years  through  payment  in  designated  banks.  The  automation  project  of \nRJSC  is  ongoing  and  supported  by  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  and \nSouthAsia  Enterprise  Development  Facility  (SEDF).24  Further,  SEDF  also  assisted  RJSC  in \npreparing  a  registration  toolkit  and  an  animated  television  film  on  how  to  register  a  business, \nand  established  knowledge  centers  in  Dhaka  and  Chittagong  chambers  of  commerce  and \nindustry,  which  maintain  a  library  of  SME  information  and  resources  including  SME  toolkits \noffering  business  software.

In \naddition, DFID is also providing assistance under its Revenues Administration Reforms project \nto  streamline  and  increase  transparency  in  tax  procedures  by  supporting  the  reform  of \nadministrative  procedures  and  computerization  at  NBR  and  taxpayer  education  activities, \nincluding  tax  information  leaflets  in  Bangla  and  English  and  a  web  site  containing  tax \ninformation and forms. \n \n\nc. \n\nBusiness Development Services and Training \n\n \n33. \nUnder the EGBM project approved in June 2004, WB will provide training on automation \napplications  to  BSCIC  and  training  of  trainers  to  SCITI.25  SEDF  provides  (i) local  service \nproviders and training institutions with the tools and training to develop their capacity to provide \nBDS,  and  (ii) SME  entrepreneurs  and  staff  with  training  programs  in  target  subsectors,  i.e., \ngarments, agribusiness, information technology, software, and light engineering.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nA. \n \n34. \nThe objective of SMESDP is to support government efforts to foster development of the \nSME sector by strengthening the policy environment for SMEs and improving SMEs\u2019 access to \ncredit and related services. This will enable the sector to attain its full potential for contributing to \nsustainable economic growth and, through generation of employment, the reduction in poverty.  \n \n35. \nSMESDP  consists  of:  (i) a  program  loan  of  SDR9.954  million  ($15  million  equivalent) \nsupporting  policy  reforms;  (ii) a  project  loan  of  SDR19.908  million  ($30  million  equivalent)  for \nextending credit to small enterprises; (iii) a TA loan of SDR3.318 million ($5 million equivalent) \nfor  improving  the  effectiveness  of  government  assistance  to  the  SME  sector  and  facilitating \nSMEs\u2019  access  to  various  support  services  including  capacity  building  and  support  for \ninfrastructure  development  for  SMEs;  and  (iv) a  TA  grant  of  $600,000  equivalent  for  assisting \nthe  Government  to  implement  and  coordinate  the  Program  and  for  benefit  monitoring.  The \nprogram framework is in Appendix 1. The development policy letter and the policy matrix are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nB. \n \n36. \nRationale  for  Sector  Development  Program  Modality.  The  sector  development \nprogram  modality  will  enable  ADB  to  apply  a  holistic  approach  to  SME  development.  Due  to \nmarket failures, targeted policy interventions are necessary to create an enabling environment \nfor  SME  development.  The  SMESDP  policy  actions  will  represent  the  key  and  core  measures \nunder  the  SME  policy  and  development  framework  that  will  provide  justification  for  the \ngovernment interventions in the sector and help relevant agencies focus on SME development \nin an integrated fashion as opposed to past ad hoc interventions. Moreover, the program loan \ncomponent  will  provide  budgetary  support  for  the  establishment  of  an  institutional  framework \ndedicated  to  SME  development  on  a  sustainable  basis  and  support  infrastructure  to  facilitate \nSME  access  to  market  opportunities,  technology,  business  support  services,  government \n\nImportant Features \n\n                                                 \n25  In addition, the EGBM project also covers additional facilities to modernize BSCIC\u2019s design center and institutional \n\ncapacity building of the Board of Investments and Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority. \n\n\f 12\n\nto  Government \n\nComplementarities \n\nservices, and capacity building. The project loan that provides funds for SEF will improve SME \naccess  to  credit  and  will  be  complementary  to  the  ongoing  projects  of  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners in the financial sector. The TA loan will support implementation of policy \nactions,  and  help  carry  out  the  needed  assessments,  capacity  building,  and  development  of \ninfrastructure for SMEs. \n \n37. \nInitiatives  and  Development  Agency \nInterventions.  SMESDP  underpins  the  Government\u2019s  agenda  of  developing  the  country\u2019s \nprivate  sector,  particularly  the  SME  sector,  which  is  accorded  high  priority  to  serve  as  the \nengine  of  pro-poor  economic  growth.  The  interventions  under  SMESDP  will  be  targeted  at \nremoving obstacles to SME growth and facilitating the flow of private investments into the SME \nsector  and  will  complement  existing  government  reform  measures  and  other  ADB  and \ndevelopment  agency  assistance  programs  in  private  and  financial  sector  development. \nMoreover,  SMESDP  is  fully  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  is  complementary  to \nADB\u2019s  interventions  in  Bangladesh  in  rural  and  microfinance  and  in  financial  market \ndevelopment, which helps improve resource mobilization and access to credit by SMEs.  \n \nC. \n \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n1. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n \n38. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nThe Program is designed to have three policy outcomes:  \n\nOutcome 1:   Establish SME Policy and Development Framework \nDeclare SMEs as a priority sector under government policy \n(a)  \nFormulate an SME policy and development strategy \n(b) \n\nOutcome 2:  Establish Institutional Structure and Mechanisms to Support SME \nDevelopment  \n(a) \n\nSet  up  an  institutional  structure  and  mechanisms  to  implement  the  SME \npolicy and development framework \nPrepare an action program to support the SME development strategy \n\n(b) \n \n\n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(iii)   Outcome 3:   Define  Government  Support  to  SMEs,  and  Improve  SME  Access \n\nto Various Services  \n(a) \n\nRationalize  government  assistance  to  the  SME  sector  including  the \nrestructuring of BSCIC and other concerned agencies under MOI involved \nin  the  sector  and  rationalization  of  government  direct  credit  assistance \ncurrently provided \nRationalize incentive and tax structure for SMEs \nEnhance SME access to market and government services \nEnhance SME access to capacity building \nEnhance  SME  access  to  product  certification  and  upgrade  product \ncertification system to international standard \nDevelop an integrated SME database \n\n \n \n\na. \n\nEstablish SME Policy and Development Framework \n\n \n39. \nDrawing  upon  the  work  of  the  SME  Task  Force,  the  Government  will,  as  part  of  the \nProgram, formulate an appropriate SME policy and development framework in consultation with \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nvarious stakeholders including SMEs and development partners. The Government will adopt the \nSME  policy  and  development  framework  that  will,  in  particular,  (i) provide  the  justification  for \ngovernment  assistance  to  the  sector;  (ii) map  out  a  government  development  strategy  to \nsupport  the  SME  sector  over  the  short,  medium,  and  long  term;  (iii) adopt  a  single  uniform \ndefinition of SMEs; (iv) identify areas of assistance to SMEs to enhance their access to capital, \nbusiness  support  services,  capacity  building,  and  technology  to  improve  their  product \nmarketability  and  competitiveness; (v) delineate  the  institutional  setup to  take  responsibility  for \nSME sector development; and (vi) incorporate internationally accepted market-based principles \nfor  SME  development.  Summary  of  the  SME  policy  and  development  framework  will  be \ndisseminated to the public through publication in newspapers of nationwide circulation. Further, \nthe  development  of  the  SME  sector  as  a  priority  will  be  stated  in  the  Industrial  Policy  and  the \nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper.  \n \n\nb. \n\nEstablish  Institutional  Structure  and  Mechanisms  to  Support  SME \nDevelopment \n\n \nThe National Council for Industrial Development  (NCID),  which is chaired by the prime \n40. \nminister  and  charged  with  making  policy  decisions  under  the  umbrella  of  the  Industrial  Policy, \nwill take responsibility for SME development. The Government will constitute an SME Advisory \nPanel mandated to develop an action program to support the SME development strategy. The \nPanel  will  consist  of  representatives  from  MOI  and  other  concerned  ministries,  industry \nassociations,  and  representatives  from  the  private  sector  and  academia,  and  report  to  the \nGuidance Committee,26 set up under the Industrial Policy and chaired by the Minister, MOI. MOI \nwill  be  the  designated  agency  for  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  SME  development \nstrategy and has set up an SME Cell to facilitate operationalization. Over the medium term, the \nGovernment will draft and approve the memorandum and articles of association that will provide \nthe organizational and operational framework for setting up an SME Foundation, which will have \nat least 50% private sector representation on the board and a chief executive officer recruited \nfrom the private sector, to assume the responsibilities for implementing the SME development \nstrategy  and  action  program  from  the  SME  Cell  and  to  take  over,  in  a  phased  manner, \nmanagement of SME credit facilities currently directly administered by the Government.  \n \n\nc. \n\nDefine  Government  Support  to  SMEs,  and  Improve  SME  Access  to \nVarious Services \n\n \n41. \nRationalize Government Assistance to the SME Sector including the Restructuring \nof  BSCIC  and  Other  Concerned  Agencies  under  MOI  involved  in  the  sector  and \nRationalization  of  Government  Direct  Credit  Assistance  Currently  Provided.  The \nGovernment will review the effectiveness of existing government assistance to the SME sector \nand  the  efficiency  of  delivery  of  such  assistance  covering  various  public  sector  agencies, \nparticularly  those  under  the  supervision  of  MOI  including  BSCIC,  SCITI,  and  BSTI,  as  well  as \nvarious  forms  of  credit  assistance  now  being  provided  to  the  sector.  The  study  will  undertake \ndetailed diagnostic analysis of the selected agencies\u2019 activities in terms of need, coverage and \nscale,  impact,  cost-effectiveness  and  sustainability,  identification  of  restructuring  alternatives, \nand preparation of a restructuring plan or a phaseout plan, depending on the study\u2019s findings. \n \n\n                                                 \n26  The Guidance Committee has 22 members including the Minister of Industries as chairperson; chairman, Board of \nInvestments;  governor,  BB;  secretary,  MOI;  secretary,  Finance  Division,  MOF;  secretaries  of  other  ministries; \nchairman, BSCIC; representatives of other agencies; and presidents, FBCCI, Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce \nand Industry, and the major district chambers of commerce and industry. \n\n\f 14\n\nIt  is  envisaged  that  BSCIC,  SCITI,  and  BSTI  will  be  restructured,  or  replaced  by  more \n42. \nresponsive institutions. In any event, restructuring or setting up an alternative institution is to be \nguided by (i) a strengthened governance structure that will introduce public-private partnership \nwith  private  sector  representation  on  the  board  of  the  organization;  (ii) recruitment  of \nprofessionals from the private sector, particularly for key positions; (iii) commercialization of the \noperations  by  charging  fees  at  least  for  cost  recovery;  (iv) a  strengthened  performance \nevaluation and incentive system; (v) drawing up of a strategic plan with a time-bound road map \nfor  each  product  or  service  group,  e.g.,  market-oriented  development  and  management  of \nindustrial  estates  and  parks,  customer-responsive  training,  and  capacity-building  services  to \nSMEs;  and  (vi) strengthened  transparency  and  accountability,  based  on  defined  performance \nindicators.  \n \nThe  rationalization  of  concerned  agencies  under  MOI  is  moving  forward.  Staff \n43. \nrationalization  is  currently  ongoing  at  BSCIC  as  part  of  human  resource  restructuring.  Staff \nstrength of BSCIC is 3,244, comprising 1,644 officers (436 in the head office and 1,208 in field \noffices) and 1,600 employees. It is planned to significantly reduce their strength. The number of \nhead  office  officers  will  be  reduced  by  half.  Staff  reduction  in  the  field  offices  is  being  worked \nout.  Voluntary  retirement  will  be  offered  to  regular  officers  and  employees.  Staff  who  do  not \nhave  properly  approved  appointments  (about  300  persons)  will  be  considered  for  termination. \nFor improved productivity, training/retraining will be provided. Regardless of whether BSCIC is \nrestructured  or  phased  out,  the  Government  will  have  to  replenish  the  employees\u2019  provident \nfund and cover special deposit accounts for withdrawals made to bridge BSCIC\u2019s accumulated \nlosses (para. 17). SCITI has been upgraded from a development project to a regular agency of \nBSCIC,27 and is recruiting experienced staff and faculty members. SCITI will be restructured to \nstrengthen its capacity to deliver training and capacity building services to SMEs. In light of the \nexpected passage of the Accreditation Law that will set up the Accreditation Board, which will \naccredit calibration and testing laboratories and certification bodies including those in the private \nsector, there is a need to assess BSTI\u2019s role in conducting product testing and in certification, \nand  to  carry  out  a  study  for  its  strategic  reorientation.  The  Program  seeks  to  resolve  these \nissues based on the findings of the study. \n \n44. \nRationalization  of  credit  assistance  will  be  based  on  an  analytical  review  of  all \ngovernment-assisted  credit  programs  and  facilities  for  SMEs,  including  their  scope,  interest \nrates, terms and conditions, and implementation arrangements. These include credit programs \nof  government  ministries,  agencies,  and  public  sector  banking  institutions  funded  from  the \nnational  budget,  refinancing  facilities  of  the  BB,  and  credit  programs  of  NCBs  and  specialized \nfinancial  institutions  funded  from  their  own  resources.  The  issues  of  directed  lending  and \npolitical considerations, subsidy, and moral hazard will be examined, and, drawing on findings of \nthe analytical review and considering international best practices, specific recommendations to \nmake  credit  delivery  mechanisms  more  effective  and  sustainable  will  be  prepared.  These \nstudies will be financed by the TA loan (para. 83).  \n \n45. \nRationalize Incentive and Tax Structure for SMEs. The SME policy and development \nstrategy will include the Government\u2019s plan to provide for a suitable incentive and tax structure \nfor SMEs. To enhance viability of these small enterprises, tax incentives should be given during \ntheir initial stage of operations. If the Government abolishes the tax holiday scheme in the next \nfiscal  year,  a  75%  income  tax  rebate  and  accelerated  depreciation  allowance  for  plant  and \nmachinery  will  be  given  as  a  substitute  to  newly  established  small  enterprises  with  fixed \n\n                                                 \n27  Previously  SCITI  was  a  project  funded  from  the  annual  development  program.  SCITI  is  now  a  permanent \n\ngovernment body with budgetary allocation from the annual revenue budget. \n\n\f \n\n15\n\ninvestments excluding land and building of less than Tk3 million. However, these tax incentives \nwill  not  be  provided  to  those  enterprises  that  already  take  advantage  of  tax  incentives  under \nexisting  export  incentive  schemes.  The  Government  will  implement  the  tax  incentives  agreed \nupon to take effect from assessment year FY2006, as provided for in the Finance Act 2005 or \nother appropriate legislation. The impact of these tax incentives will be minimal initially because \nthese  enterprises  are  very  small.  However,  in  the  long  run,  these  measures  are  expected  to \nfacilitate the expansion of SMEs and consequently enhance revenue to the Government as they \ncome  out  of  the  informal  sector  and  are  captured  in  the  tax  net.  As  stated  in  the  Industrial \nPolicy,  to  encourage  the  establishment  of  small  firms,  assistance  will  be  given  by  way  of \nrearranging the tax structure such that taxes and duties are fixed at the lowest level that can be \njustified.  \n \nEnhance  SME  Access  to  Market  and  Government  Services.  MOI  has  a  program  to \n46. \nimplement e-governance, which will involve the development and maintenance of a web site to \nbe  linked  to  the  web  sites  of  other  line  ministries,  and  has  constituted  an  e-governance \ncommittee to spearhead and coordinate this program. The e-governance program is important \nfor access and dissemination of information, and enhanced transparency, particularly in crucial \nareas  where  corrupt  practices  prevail,  such  as  procurement  and  business  registration.  The \nProgram  will  incorporate  the  development  of  an  SME  web  portal/virtual  front  office  and  the \nestablishment of SME helpline outreach centers to provide (i) assistance for facilitating access \nto  government  services;  (ii) guidance  to  comply  with  government  requirements  including \nregistration, product testing and certification; and (iii) dissemination of information about SMEs, \nmarket opportunities, and linkages to international markets. The extensive geographic presence \nof BSCIC and FBCCI and its member associations could be used to further extend the outreach \nof  government  services  to  SMEs  countrywide.  MOI,  in  partnership  with  FBCCI  and  its  district \nchambers  and  line  associations,  will  establish  helpline  outreach  centers  at  selected  district \noffices of BSCIC, and knowledge centers at the Dhaka and Chittagong chambers of commerce \nand  industry.  The  helpline  and  knowledge  centers  will  utilize  the  SME  web  portal  to  provide \naccess  to  information  by  SMEs  in  various  parts  of  the  country  and  through  the  Internet. \nAssistance  for  the  development  of  the  SME  web  portal  and  helpline  outreach  centers  will  be \nfinanced under the TA loan (paras. 84 and 85).  \n \nEnhance SME Access to Capacity Building. Under SMESDP, SCITI will undertake a \n47. \ntraining  needs  assessment  and  develop  appropriate  training  programs  under  a  public-private \npartnership  with  FBCCI,  district  chambers  and  line  associations  of  FBCCI,  accredited  women \nentrepreneurs\u2019  associations,  and  the  National  Association  of  Small  and  Cottage  Industries  of \nBangladesh. The Government has committed to support targeted SME training, particularly for \n(i) SMEs  in  rural  areas,  (ii) women  entrepreneurs,  (iii) displaced  workers  in  the  RMG  industry, \nand (iv) SME credit staff of participating financial institutions (PFIs) under SEF. MOI will present \na plan to restructure SCITI to strengthen its capacity to deliver training services to SMEs. SCITI \nwill charge for at least cost recovery for those who can afford to pay for the services. The TA \nloan  will  provide  assistance  to  SCITI  in  implementing  these  training  and  capacity-building \nprograms (para. 86).  \n \nEnhance  SME  Access  to  Product  Certification  and  Upgrade  Product  Certification \n48. \nSystem to International Standard. To meet SMEs\u2019 need for credible certification bodies where \nthey can obtain a technical evaluation of the quality of their products, BSTI will be strengthened \nin conducting product testing and certification. The Program will also support enactment of the \ndraft  Accreditation  Law,  establishment  of  the  Accreditation  Board,  and  an  application  by  the \nAccreditation  Board  for  membership  of  the  International  Accreditation  Forum  to  ensure \nworldwide acceptance of certificates issued by accredited certification bodies in Bangladesh. To \n\n\f 16\n\nfacilitate  SME  access,  a  special  window  for  certifying  SME  products  will  be  set  up  at  BSTI. \nAssistance  in  upgrading  the  product  certification  system  and  in  promoting  product  certification \namong SMEs will be provided under the TA loan (para. 87).  \n \nDevelop  an  Integrated  SME  Database.  For  monitoring  SME  performance  and \n49. \ndevelopment,  and  for  targeting  assistance,  it  is  essential  to  have  a  database  that  indicates, \namong other things, the number of SMEs, their characteristics and economic activities, and type \nand  number  of  employees.  An  initial  listing  of  SMEs  will  be  generated  from  the  Economic \nCensus  supplemented  by  other  sources.  This  will  serve  as  a  sampling  frame  for  large-scale \nnationwide  sample  surveys  on  attributes  of  SMEs  such  as  employment  (with  gender \nbreakdown)  and  output.  Such  data  will  be  captured  in  an  integrated  SME  database  that  will \nfacilitate  assessment,  particularly  as  regards  impact  and  effectiveness  of  government  policies. \nThe  BBS  is  completing  the  processing  of  the  Economic  Census  and  will  be  publishing  a \npreliminary report by end-2004. It is envisaged that the creation of the SME database will be a \ncollaborative effort with BBS. While BBS continues to prepare the basic statistics regarding the \nenterprise sector, it is important to  have a dedicated unit or institution focusing on information \ngathering  for  SMEs.  The  SME  Cell  will  assume  this  function.  The  TA  loan  will  provide \nassistance in the development of the database (para. 88).  \n \n\n2. \n\nImportant Features \n\nInternationally Accepted Principles.  Policy actions under SMESDP  incorporate key \n\n \n50. \nprinciples28 as discussed in paras. 51\u201358. \n \nPublic-Private Partnerships. To ensure ownership and credibility of policy reforms, the \n51. \ndevelopment of the SME policy and ensuing action program to support the SME development \nstrategy  will  be  a  participatory  process  involving  consultation  with  all  concerned  stakeholders. \nThe  proposed  SME  Foundation  that  will  eventually  take  over  functions  to  support  SME \ndevelopment  within  the  Government  will  have  private  sector  representation  on  its  board.  The \ntraining  service  delivery  will  be  implemented  by  SCITI  in  collaboration  with  FBCCI,  chambers, \nand  associations.  The  Government  will  provide,  with  development  agency  support,  initial \ninvestments in public goods (e.g., SME database) for the benefit of SMEs, and the associated \nservices to maintain such public goods will be contracted to private sector organizations, or run \nas a joint public-private undertaking. The Government will focus on promoting the development \nof  markets  for  the  delivery  of  BDS  by  private  sector  providers.  The  Government  and  public \nservice institutions will continue to provide services where gaps exist due to market failures, and \nwill withdraw when markets for these services develop. \n \n52. \nDemand-Driven  Interventions.  Training  provided  under  SMESDP  will  be  demand-\ndriven  and  based  on  training  needs  assessment,  avoiding  duplication  with  existing  training \nprograms.  \n \n53. \nPrinciples of Cost Recovery. The principle of cost recovery will guide the planning and \nimplementation of the targeted training programs. There could be exceptions to the principle of \ncost  recovery  in  cases  that  involve  very  small  rural  participants  who  do  not  have  immediate \ncapacity  to  pay  regular  training  fees  but  could  influence  the  direction  and  pace  of  SME \ndevelopment in their communities. Similarly, employers hiring displaced RMG workers will pay \n\n                                                 \n28  These are based on the OECD\u2019s Bologna Charter on SME Policies, the Istanbul Ministerial Declaration: Fostering \nthe Growth of Innovative and Internationally Competitive SMEs, and current SME policies and legal framework of \nADB developing member countries. Market-based principles in finance are discussed in the Project Loan section. \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nframework \n\ninstitutional \n\nCoordination  of  Government  Efforts.  The \n\nDevelopment  of  Evaluation  Culture  and  Statistical  Database \n\nfor their training, but fees will be waived if workers with no ability to pay do not have immediate \nemployment prospects. \n \n54. \nfor  SME \ndevelopment  will  involve  all  tiers  of  the  Government,  including  high-level  support  from  the \ninterministerial committee to be chaired by the prime minister. Moreover, the SME Foundation, a \ndedicated institution, will be set up to promote SME development on a sustainable basis.  \n \nEfficient  Resources  Utilization  and  Outreach  of  SME  Programs.  Efficiency  of \n55. \nresource  use  will  be  maximized  by  working  with  SME  groups  or  cells  within  chambers  and \nbusiness  associations,  which  will  coordinate  with  helpline  outreach  centers  to  ensure  efficient \nservice delivery to SMEs nationwide.  \n \n56. \nUse  of  Information  Technology  and  E-Commerce.  The  SME  web  site/virtual  front \noffice under SMESDP that will contain information of SMEs and market opportunities will reduce \nbarriers  to  SME  access  to  global  markets,  and  will  be  complementary  to  the  Government\u2019s  e-\ngovernance program.  \n \n57. \nfor  SME \nDevelopment. An evaluation culture will be promoted in ministries and agencies responsible for \nSME  policies  and  programs  to  ensure  cost-effectiveness  and  outreach  of  benefits  of  the \nprograms. The SME database will help identify population of SMEs and facilitate implementation \nof SME-targeted interventions and studies of the SME sector, while the TA grant will support the \ndevelopment of benefit monitoring systems.  \n \n58. \ntarget  women  entrepreneurship \ndevelopment, a gender action plan has been prepared, specifying women-targeted activities to \nbe  conducted  under  SMESDP.  First,  women  entrepreneurs  will  be  involved  in  the  preparation \nand  implementation  of  the  SME  policy  and  development  framework.  The  composition  of  the \nSME  Task  Force  includes  a  representative  from  the  Women  Entrepreneurs\u2019  Association  of \nBangladesh.  Women  entrepreneurs will  also  have  a  representative  in NCID.  Second,  targeted \nwomen\u2019s  training  programs  will  be  conducted  in  collaboration  with  women  entrepreneurs\u2019 \nassociations.  Third,  a  portion  of  funds  under  SEF  will  be  allocated  to  women  entrepreneurs \n(para.  71).  Lastly,  gender-disaggregated  data  will  be  included  in  the  SME  database  and  the \nmonitoring  system  of  SMESDP  to  facilitate  gender-targeted  interventions  and  to  keep  track  of \nwomen beneficiaries, including trained participants under the targeted women entrepreneurship \ntraining programs. (The gender action plan is in Supplementary Appendix 1.) \n \n\nEmpowerment  of  Women  Entrepreneurs.  To \n\n3. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nAdjustment  Costs.  The  total  adjustment  costs  estimated  at  $33.4  million  equivalent \n59. \ncomprise (i) the development of SME policy and development framework and institutional setup \nfor  policy  implementation;  (ii) loss  of  revenues  from  tax  incentives  to  small  enterprises; \n(iii) establishment  and  operation  of  SME  support  infrastructure  including  the  integrated \ndatabase,  web  portal,  helpline  outreach  centers,  and  e-governance  infrastructure;  and \n(iv) rationalization  and  improvement  of  government  assistance  to  SMEs  including  restructuring \nof  SCITI,  restructuring  of  BSCIC,  and  upgrading  of  facilities  and  capacity  building  of  BSTI. \nUnder restructuring of BSCIC or its replacement, the Program will provide budgetary support for \nfinancial restructuring costs to cover its accumulated operating losses (paras. 17 and 43), staff \nrationalization,  voluntary  retirement,  termination  of  excess  personnel  (particularly  those  not \n\n\f 18\n\n \n\nItem \n\nauthorized to be in the employee roster), and recruitment of qualified professionals for specific \nimportant positions.

The  program  loan  of  SDR9.954  million  ($15  million \n60. \nequivalent)  will  be  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  amortization  period  of  24 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during \nthe  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The  loan  closing  date  is  expected  to  be  31 \nDecember 2007. Other terms and conditions are set out in the Program Loan Agreement. The \nloan  proceeds  will  be  available  for  withdrawal  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with  the  agreed \nconditions. The first tranche of $5 million equivalent will be released upon effectiveness of the \nloan  and  fulfillment  of  the  first  tranche  release  conditions.  The  second  tranche  of  $10  million \nequivalent is expected to be released by end-June 2007, upon fulfillment of the second tranche \nrelease conditions. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\nloan  will \n\nThe  program \n\nfollow  ADB  standard  procedures \n\n \n61. \nfor  procurement  and \ndisbursement.  Proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  utilized  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs, \nexcluding  local  duties  and  taxes,  of  imports  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member \ncountries,  other  than  those  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items  and  those  items  financed  by \nother multilateral and bilateral official sources. (The list of ineligible items is in Appendix 4.) All \nprocurement  under  the  program  loan  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement and undertaken through normal commercial practices for the private sector or the \nGovernment\u2019s prescribed procurement procedures acceptable to ADB, with due consideration to \neconomy and efficiency. Disbursements under the program loan will be made in line with ADB\u2019s \nsimplified  disbursement  procedures  and  audit  requirements.  To  withdraw  the  proceeds  of  the \nloan,  the  Borrower  will  certify  that  the  value  of  eligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s \nprojected  disbursements  under  the  program  loan  in  a  given  period.  ADB  will  have  the  right  to \naudit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. \n \n\nThe  assessment  has  been  carried  out.  No  specific  environmental  mitigation  or \n\n5. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment of Policy Matrix \n\n \n62. \nmonitoring requirement was identified (Supplementary Appendix 2). \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nD. \n \n\nThe Project Loan \n\n1. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n19\n\n \nSmall  Enterprise  Fund.  Market  and  policy  failures  in  the  financial  sector  are  being \n63. \naddressed  through  various  loan  and  TA  projects  on  the  reform  of  the  Bangladesh  financial \nsector  funded  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners  (paras.  28-31).  However,  the \ndevelopment of an appropriate legal framework as well as capacity building of the regulator and \nmarket players will take time. The Bangladesh credit market suffers from a dearth of medium- to \nlong-term  funds  and  does  not  allocate  funds  efficiently.  Some  FIs,  which  are  keen  to  lend  to \nSMEs, are constrained by the limited availability of term funds at reasonable costs while others \nare  reluctant  to  expand  their  SME  loan  portfolio  due  to  perceived  higher  credit  risk  and \nadministrative  costs  of  dealing  with  small  borrowers.  To  encourage  FIs  to  extend  credit  to \nSMEs,  the  Government  has  allocated  Tk1  billion  from  the  Rural-based  Agro  Processing \nIndustries  Refinancing  Facility  to  establish  SEF  as  a  credit  facility  to  be  managed  by  BB  for \nrefinancing loans to small enterprises lent by banks and NBFIs (see summary of SEF terms and \nconditions in Appendix 5 and BB\u2019s circular of 2 May 2004 on the Refinance Scheme for Small \nEnterprises Sector in Supplementary Appendix 3).  \n \n64. \nTo support the government initiative in this regard, the project loan of SDR19.908 million \n($30 million equivalent) will be used as a contribution to SEF. WB has contributed $10 million \nequivalent  to  SEF  under  its  EGBM  project.29  SEF  will  enhance  access  to  credit  by  small \nenterprises in the \u201cmissing middle\u201d between micro- and medium enterprises. Eligible enterprises \nwill  have  fixed  assets  of  not  more  than  Tk10  million  and  will  not  be  in  the  exclusion  list  that \ncovers  tobacco,  alcoholic  drinks,  armaments,  and  other  ineligible  items.  While  the  overall \nfinancing  gap  of  the  SME  sector  is  large,  the  problem  of  lack  of  access  to  credit  is  more \npronounced for this segment of SMEs. Under SEF, these enterprises can apply for loans in the \nrange  of  Tk0.2 million\u20135  million.  In  addition,  the  TA  loan  component  will  provide  capacity-\nbuilding  assistance  to  PFIs  to  strengthen  their  systems  and  procedures  for  SME  lending,  and \ntrain the SME credit staff to better understand and guide SMEs in their operations.  \n \n\na. \n\nParticipating Financial Institutions \n\n \n65. \nPreidentification of PFIs. Under ADB\u2019s financial intermediary loan (FIL) modality, PFIs \nare  preidentified  based  on  due  diligence  conducted  not  only  to  analyze  their  financial  aspects \nbut also to determine their ability to handle social and environmental issues. Six PFIs, namely, \nPrime  Bank,  Eastern  Bank,  Basic  Bank,  Industrial  Development  Leasing  Company  of \nBangladesh, Industrial Promotion & Development Company of Bangladesh, and United Leasing \nCompany, for which due diligence has been carried out, have been preidentified to participate \nunder SEF (see summary of due diligence report in Appendix 6). However, since the facility is \naimed  at  improving  access  to  credit  by  SMEs,  it  was  deemed  appropriate  to  make  the  facility \navailable  to  as  wide  a  number  of  eligible  FIs  as  possible.  Moreover,  the  current  approach  is \naimed at mainstreaming SME lending in the financial sector as opposed to the previous practice \nof  relying  on  specialized  FIs  such  as  development  finance  institutions  to  deliver  the  credit. \nConsequently, BB in its capacity as administrator of SEF could accredit additional PFIs provided \nthey meet eligibility criteria as agreed between BB, WB, and ADB (see also para. 77). BB will \n\n                                                 \n29  Concerns about large-scale terminations of workers under the EGBM project led the Government to find ways to \nreabsorb excess workers from state-owned enterprises and banks and provide gainful employment. Consequently, \nsupporting the more rapid expansion of the SME sector was considered a viable way of addressing the problem.  \n\n\f 20\n\nprovide  relevant  information  to  ADB  regarding  accreditation  of  additional  PFIs,  which  would \nenable ADB to conduct due diligence as necessary.  \n \n66. \nPFI Eligibility  Criteria.  Eligible PFIs must have no more than 10% classified loans on \nportfolios up to Tk5 million. Being under the supervision of BB, PFIs must also fully comply with \nBB\u2019s prudential regulations which include, among other things, (i) minimum capital of 9% on a \nrisk-weighted basis, up from 8% previously; (ii) exposure limit to a particular customer or group; \n(iii) loan  classification  and  loan  loss  provisioning;30  (iv) internal  control  system;  (v) risk \nmanagement and antimoney-laundering procedures; and (vi) early warning system. In addition, \nunder the Project Agreement between ADB and BB, each participation agreement between BB \nand the PFI will contain provisions that require the PFI to maintain financial soundness; conduct \nits  operations  in  accordance  with  sound  financial  principles  and  practices;  maintain  a  lending \nand  investment  policy  acceptable  to  ADB  and  BB  to  enable  it  to  effectively  appraise  the \nfinancial,  technical,  environmental,  and  economic  feasibility  of  investment  projects;  and \nsupervise  and  monitor  the  implementation  of  investment  projects  by  beneficiaries.  BB\u2019s \nprudential regulations as well as the WB\u2019s criteria conform to the eligibility criteria of PFIs under \nADB\u2019s  FIL  policy  that  have  been  reflected  in  the  Project  Agreement  between  ADB  and  BB. \nMoreover,  the  TA  loan  will  provide  assistance  to  PFIs  to  strengthen  their  systems  and \nprocedures for SME lending to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s FIL policy. \n \nSafeguard  Policies.  BB  will  ensure  that  PFIs  adhere  to  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  on \n67. \nenvironment  and  resettlement.  It  is  expected  that  many  PFIs  will  not  have  systematic \nprocedures  for  monitoring  and  assessment.  ADB  will  assist  PFIs  through  the  TA  loan  to \nestablish environmental management and monitoring systems appropriate for the targeted small \nenterprise clientele. \n \n68. \nEnvironmental  Due  Diligence  of  the  PFIs.  The  six  PFIs  include  environmental  risk \nanalysis during their appraisal of loans, which involves as a minimum, checking if the borrower \nhas an environmental clearance certificate. The PFIs do not finance projects that are hazardous \nor  environmentally  risky.31  All  FIs  have  a  designated  officer  responsible  for  environmental \nissues,  but  none  has  formal  training  and  only  a  few  have  attended  development  agency-\nsponsored  seminars  on  the  environment.  All  FIs  expressed  need  for  further  assistance  and \ntraining. \n \n69. \nBDS  Offered  by  PFI.  ADB,  under  the  TA  loan,  will  provide  assistance  to  build  up  the \ncapacity  of  PFIs  to  improve  their  SME  lending  capabilities,  systems,  and  procedures;  and  to \nprovide  in-house  advisory  services  for  their  SME  clients.  For  more  in-depth  and  sophisticated \nBDS, PFIs will refer SMEs to external BDS providers.  \n \n\n                                                 \n30  BB  is  bringing  loan  classification  in  line  with  international  standards,  i.e.,  currently,  \"substandard\"  if  arrears  are \nmore  than  6  months  but  less  than  9  months,  \"doubtful\" if  more  than  9  months  but  less  than  12  months,  and  as \n\"bad debt\" if more than 12 months (as compared with limits of 3, 6, and 12 months respectively under international \nstandards).  The  Cabinet  has  approved  amendments  to  allow  BB  to  make  the  necessary  changes  to  loan \nclassification  standards.  BB  is  receiving  assistance  under  the  WB\u2019s  Central  Bank  Strengthening  Project  for  $37 \nmillion to ensure banks' compliance with international standards. \n\n31  IPDC (which was formerly affiliated with IFC) and IDLC (in which IFC is a shareholder), both follow environmental \nguidelines prescribed by IFC/WB and they do not finance any project that is on the exclusion list of IFC/WB. They \nhave incorporated in the loan agreement a provision requiring the borrower to obtain an environmental clearance \ncertificate for setting up the project to be financed and to renew the certificate every year. United Leasing, in which \nADB  has  a  shareholding,  and  Basic  Bank,  which  has  received  loans  from  ADB  and  several  other  funding \nagencies, have similar requirements. The two other banks, Prime Bank and Eastern Bank, are not as rigorous or \nregular in checking environmental compliance, and they do not have a formal environmental management system. \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nb. \n\nSmall and Medium Enterprise Beneficiaries \n\n \n70. \nScope. Taking into account the experience under the BB\u2019s Rural-based Agro-processing \nIndustries Refinancing Facility, which had a low utilization rate owing mainly to the geographic \nrestriction  on  use  of  funds,  SEF  has  no  geographic,  industrial,  or  sector  restrictions.  SEF  will \nfinance  agro-based  enterprises,  but  not  crop,  livestock,  and  fish  production  that  are  being \nfinanced  already  with  agricultural  loans.  Furthermore,  participation  in  SEF  is  not  limited  to \nscheduled banks and the facility can be used for financing leases. More importantly, SEF will be \nsubject to periodic review. BB in consultation with WB and ADB, will take corrective measures to \nimprove utilization, including raising the coverage to include SMEs beyond the strict definition of \nthe \u201cmissing middle\u201d if needed. \n \nAllocation  for  Women  Entrepreneurs.  Women  are  normally  given  lower  priority  in \n71. \nallocation of credit due mainly to negative sociocultural perceptions of women in business. To \nfacilitate access by women borrowers, a minimum of 10% of SEF will be earmarked for lending \nto women entrepreneurs. However, if the earmarked funds are not utilized within a period of 1.5 \nyears, such funds will revert to the general pool. \n \n\nc. \n\nUse of Asian Development Bank Loan Proceeds \n\n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  new  loans  advanced  by  PFIs  under  a \n72. \nparticipation  agreement  with  BB  for  the  purpose  of  using  the  SEF,  and  will  not  be  used  to \nrefinance the portfolio of old loans in the existing portfolio of the PFIs. Loans approved by PFIs \nmore than 180 days prior to the application date for reimbursement of first disbursement using \nADB funds will not be allowed. \n \n73. \nUse  of  ADB  Loan  Proceeds  for  Working  Capital.  SEF  will  be  available  for  medium-\nterm  (1\u20133  years)  and  long-term  (3\u20135  years)  loans  as  well  as  for  short-term  working  capital \nloans.  ADB\u2019s  FIL  policy  states  that  ADB  funds  may  be  used  by  the  financial  intermediary \nrecipient of the FIL to finance fixed capital requirements of subprojects as well as subprojects\u2019 \nforeign  exchange  requirements  for  initial  working  capital  (such  as  initial  stock  of  spare  parts, \ntools, and raw materials), but not for subsequent working capital requirements.32 The WB\u2019s FIL \npolicy  allows  for  financing  of  working  capital  for  expansion  of  business  activities.33  Since  ADB \nloan  proceeds  will  be  contributed  with  WB  and  BB  funds  to  the  same  pool,  it  would  be  an \nadministrative burden on BB to distinguish whether a subloan is for initial working capital or for \nexpansion  or  simply  for  additional  working  capital.  Such  differentiation  would  be  highly \nimpractical given the small size of these loans. Further, it would be impractical and complicated \nfor  small  enterprises  to  seek  financing  from  other  sources  just  for  their  working  capital  needs \ngiven their limited access to credit. In this case, the requirement in the FIL policy for the use of \nADB loans to finance only initial working capital should be relaxed to allow the ADB loan to help \nmeet credit demands and for harmonization with BB\u2019s criteria and WB\u2019s policy. \n \n74. \nTaking into account the estimated contribution from PFIs and SME beneficiaries as well \nas WB and BB cofinancing, ADB\u2019s share of the project cost is estimated at only 11.6% (Table \n2).  At  the  subproject  level,  however,  there  may  be  cases  where  ADB\u2019s  financing  may  exceed \nthe 75% cost sharing limit for Bangladesh. Under ADB\u2019s local cost financing policy, ADB allows \nfinancial  intermediaries  to  use  the  foreign  exchange  provided  under  FILs,  to  finance  local \ncurrency  expenditures  of  subprojects  within  standard  cost-sharing  limits;  it  is  estimated  that \n\n                                                 \n32  ADB Operations Manual, Section D6/BP, para. 14. \n33  WB\u2019s Operational Policies on Financial Intermediary Lending. \n\n\f 22\n\ndirect  and  indirect  foreign  exchange  costs  at  the  Project  level  will  be  16.6%  and  7.2%, \nrespectively.34 In this regard, the local cost financing limit of ADB for Bangladesh should not be \napplied at the subproject level for flexibility in meeting the financing needs of small enterprises.  \n \n\nd. \n\nRelending and Onlending Rates \n\n \nSEF is available for PFIs in local currency (taka) at the BB rate, which is currently 5%,35 \n75. \nwhile PFIs will onlend the funds in taka to qualified SME borrowers at market rates. Currently, \nthe  average  cost  of  funds  (less  than  1  year)  is  about  7\u20139%  for  PCBs  and  11\u201313%  for  NBFIs. \nThe average lending rate is 10\u201313% for banks and 14\u201315% for NBFIs (even as high as 17% for \nlonger-term  maturities).  The  5%  BB  rate  utilized  as  the  basis  for  refinancing  loans  under  SEF \nwill be applied uniformly and in a nondiscriminatory fashion to all eligible PFIs under the SEF. \nThe BB rate is also the reference rate for all of BB\u2019s refinancing facilities. The use of this rate is \njustified  on  the  basis  of  the  3.5\u20134%  foreign  exchange  cover  and  credit  risk  premium  over  the \nAsian Development Fund rate of the project loan. The BB rate is viewed as the wholesale cost \nat  which  PFIs  would  be  willing  to  borrow  to  finance  the  SEF  end-users.  The  2%  differential \nbetween  the  BB  rate  and  the  bank  deposit  rate36  is  also  to  compensate  PFIs  for  the  higher \nservicing  and  administrative  costs  of  dealing  with  small  SME  borrowers.  Moreover,  PFIs  need \ninducements  to  focus  their  lending  on  SMEs.  The  penetration  into  this  segment  of  borrowers \ncould create a demonstration effect among FIs. Given more familiarity with the SME sector and \nenhanced capabilities of their staff, PFIs are expected to establish or strengthen their SME units \nto provide SME financing on a sustainable basis even after the expiry of SEF. Notwithstanding \nthe  use  of  the  BB  rate  as  the  basis  for  the  refinance  facility,  the  onlending  rate  of  PFIs  to \nsubprojects  will  be  on  strictly  market-determined  terms.  In  view  of  this,  and  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s FIL policy,37 the use of the BB rate at a level below bank deposit levels is justified. \n \n76. \nThere are differing viewpoints as to whether this could be considered an implicit subsidy. \nAccording  to  the  ADB  Board  Information  Paper  Bank  Criteria  for  Subsidies  dated  30  October \n1996,  \u201cthe  exceptions  to  the  general  rule  of  no  subsidies  for  private  provision  include  interest \nrate subsidies directed to SMEs or to exporters to compensate for other policy effects. In many \ndeveloping  member  countries,  there  is  no  market  for  long-term  capital.  ADB,  through  its \nactivities, can provide access to long-term capital and encourage the development of domestic \ncapital markets for longer term funds. In seeking to establish and improve capital markets, ADB \nis justified in providing funds and encouraging the domestic development of investment funds at \na price that does not fully reflect the risks being taken.\u201d Thus, the relending rate in either case \ncould  be  justified  in  the  context  of  Bangladesh  where  the  capital  market  has  not  effectively \nplayed  its  role  in  mobilizing  and  allocating  long-term  funds.  Moreover,  concerns  about \nsubsidies\u2014including  fiscal  burden,  altering  market  signals,  and  undesirable  and  unanticipated \neffects on income distribution\u2014are not relevant in the case of SEF. \n \n\n                                                 \n34  WB  and  Bangladesh  Enterprise  Institute.  2003.  Improving  the  Investment  Climate  in  Bangladesh.  Washington, \nDistrict  of  Columbia.  Table  A3.2  of  Appendix  3  of  the  WB  report  gives  a  breakdown  of  sources  of  inputs  and \nsupplies  by  firm  size.  For  small  enterprises,  the  breakdown  is:  76.2%  of  inputs  and  supplies  from  domestic \nsources; 16.6%, imported directly; and 7.2% imported indirectly. \n\n35  The BB rate is used as a reference rate for BB to signal an expansionary or contractionary monetary policy stance. \nIt is also used uniformly as the refinance rate in various BB credit facilities. Repo rates derived from open market \noperations are used as a monetary policy tool. \n\n36  Bank deposit rates are also influenced by the Government\u2019s National Savings Certificates schemes.  \n37  ADB  Operations  Manual,  Section  D6/BP,  issued  on  15  December  2003.  In  exceptional  and  well-justified  cases, \nADB, for a certain period, may accept relending rates that are below market, but not below ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources lending rates in the case of a foreign currency-denominated loan or the equivalent rate in the case of a \nlocal currency loan, which should reflect an adequate foreign exchange risk premium.  \n\n\f \n\n23\n\ne. \n\nManagement of the Facility \n\n \n77. \nBangladesh  Bank  as  Facility  Manager.  BB  was  deemed  appropriate  to  administer \nSEF at this stage because of BB\u2019s large contribution to SEF, its ready access to information in \ndetermining  the  financial  soundness  and  capabilities  of  PFIs  for  providing  credit  to  the  SME \nsector,  and  its  function  as  administrator  of  the  Credit  Information  Bureau,  which  gathers \ninformation  regarding  borrowers.38  No  feasible  alternative  for  facility  management  could  be \nfound. Concerns about governance, conflict of interest, and lack of capacity of candidate facility \nmanagers earlier considered ruled them out. BB\u2019s regulatory and supervisory capacity is being \nstrengthened  under  the  ongoing  WB\u2019s  Central  Bank  Strengthening  Project.  Guidance  and \nsupport  are  provided  in  designing  new  bank  regulation  policy  and  strengthening  prudential \nregulations,  reporting,  and  enforcement.  BB  has  made  progress  in  improving  its  financial \nreporting,  auditing,  and  control  systems,  and  has  adopted  the  International  Accounting \nStandards as its accounting basis. The Agriculture Credit and Special Programs Department of \nBB  will  take  charge  of  administering  SEF,  and  BB  will  ensure  that  there  are  well-qualified \nprofessionals  for  the  management  of  SEF.  Once  the  SME  Foundation  is  established,  the \nmanagement of SEF will be transferred in a phased manner from BB to the SME Foundation to \nensure a sustainable institutional structure with private sector participation.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImportant Features \n\n \n78. \nThe ineffective allocation of credit is due to market failures resulting from NPL problems \nof  NCBs  and  lack  of  effective  long-term  debt  and  interbank  markets.  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners have actively supported financial sector reform through various loan and \nTA  projects  to  address  market  failures.  However,  measures  aimed  at  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment  will  require  continuous  long-term  commitment  from  the  Government  and  will  take \ntime  to  bring  about  substantial  development  impact.  Currently,  some  FIs  that  are  keen  to \nengage in SME lending are constrained by limited availability of term funds at reasonable cost \nwhile others need to be provided with incentives to expand their loan portfolio. The problem is \nmore pronounced for SMEs in the \u201cmissing middle\u201d. It is imperative that PFIs are provided with \nfinancing resources, especially term funds at reasonable rates, to induce them to focus on the \nSME sector, and trigger the expansion of their SME portfolio. SEF is formulated to mainstream \nSME lending in the financial system instead of just defining one or few PFIs. The project loan as \ncontribution to SEF will also be complementary to the WB\u2019s contribution under its EGBM project. \nBB, as the fund manager, will coordinate the utilization of the ADB and WB fund contributions \nand the Government\u2019s own funds in SEF. Complementary to the project loan is the TA loan that \nwill  enhance  understanding  of  the  SME  sector  among  PFIs.  Once  the  legal  and  institutional \ninfrastructure is developed, these FIs will be able to introduce diversified financing mechanisms \nand instruments for more appropriately meeting the needs of SMEs. SMESDP will help bridge \nthe current gap and allow for policy measures on financial market development to bear fruit.39  \n \n\n                                                 \n38  A  Credit  Information  Bureau  has  been  set  up  in  BB.  Currently,  it  covers  loan  accounts  of  at  least Tk50,000.  BB \nplans to put the Credit Information Bureau online by 2005 and further expand the coverage of credit information. \nThis will enable enhanced transparency on the quality of loans by borrowers. \n\n39  The Government  was receptive to the  possible  introduction of partial credit guarantee  as credit enhancement to \nmobilize resources for SMEs on a sustainable basis. During SMESDP implementation, the Government, in close \ncollaboration with BB, will further assess the need and feasibility for alternative credit enhancement arrangements. \nUnder the Trade Finance Facilitation Program launched in May 2004, ADB will issue partial credit guarantees to \nguarantee participating international and regional banks (confirming banks), for payment of trade credits issued by \naccredited  local  banks  (issuing  banks)  in  selected  developing  member  countries,  including  Bangladesh.  A  trade \nfacilitation agreement has been signed by ADB with Southeast Bank. \n\n\f 24\n\n3. \n\nCosts and Financing Plan \n\n \n79. \nThe  fund  size  of  SEF  is  $56.7  million  equivalent  consisting  of  $16.7  million  equivalent \nfrom the Government, $10.0 million equivalent from WB, and $30.0 million equivalent from ADB. \nPFIs and SME beneficiaries will contribute to the costs of subprojects from their own resources. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $257.8  million  equivalent,  including  $201.1  million \nequivalent  estimated  to  be  financed  by  PFIs,  other  sources  of  credit,  and  SME  beneficiaries\u2019 \nequity in addition to SEF.40 ADB will provide the project loan of $30 million equivalent from its \nSpecial Funds resources for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an \ninterest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The \nproject loan will be provided in foreign exchange. Interest during the implementation period will \nbe capitalized.

In  turn,  the  Government  will  provide  the  taka  proceeds  to  BB  under  an \nadministrative agreement. As the apex institution, BB will lend the SME funds in taka to eligible \nPFIs  at  refinancing  rate  of  interest  equivalent  to  the  prevailing  BB  rate.  ADB  financing  will  be \navailable  to  PFIs  on  a  refinancing  basis  (i.e.,  based  on  disbursement  by  PFIs  to  SME \nborrowers). In turn, PFIs will relend the SME credit funds in taka as subloans/subleases to their \nSME clients at market-determined rates. The SME clients will repay the principal amount of the \nsubloans/subleases to PFIs, which are obligated to repay BB in full irrespective of the amount \ncollected from their clients. Activities to be financed through subloans/subleases will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement  requirements  and  environmental  and  other \nsafeguard  policies.  The  project  loan  will  be  available  for  5  years  from  the  effectiveness  of \nSMESDP. It is expected that the completion date for the project will be 30 June 2010 and the \nloan closing date will be 31 December 2010. Subsequently, BB will recycle the funds repaid by \n                                                 \n40  It is assumed that SME borrowers will contribute one third from their own equity and seek external financing for the \nrest  from  PFIs  and  other  sources.  Based  on  discussions  with  the  preidentified  FIs,  it  is  expected  that  PFIs  will \nfinance about 65% of their SME loans from SEF and about 35% from other sources of funds.  \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nPFIs  for  new  subloans/subleases.  Subloans/subleases  drawn  down  under  the  facility  will  be \ncoterminous with the ADB loan (i.e., 32 years maturity). \n \n81. \nAn imprest account will be established for the purpose of SEF administered by BB. The \ninitial  advance  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  estimated  expenditures  for  the  first  6 \nmonths  of  the  project  loan  or  10%  of  the  respective  loan  amount  (i.e.,  $3  million  equivalent), \nwhichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  account  will  be  replenished  as  eligible  expenditures  are \nincurred  and  liquidated.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  and  detailed  arrangements  as  agreed \nby  the  Government  and  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  procedures  may  be  used  to \nreimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest  account  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Statement  of  expenditures  procedures \nwill be applicable to individual payments amounting to $50,000 or less. \n \nE. \n \n\nThe Technical Assistance Loan  \n\n1. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n \n82. \nThe  TA  loan  will  provide  technical  advice  and  resources  needed  to  build  capacity  and \nassist  in  program  implementation  to  achieve  the  stated  outcomes  of  the  Program.  The \ncomponents of the TA loan are discussed in the following paragraphs. The rationale, scope, and \napproach of each of the components of the TA loan are in Appendix 7. Terms of reference for \nTA loan components are in Supplementary Appendix 5.  \n \nRationalization  of  Government  Assistance  to  SMEs.  The  TA  loan  will  deliver  the \n83. \nfollowing  outputs,  among  other  things:  (i) a  diagnostic  analysis  of  BSCIC  and  its  restructuring \nplan or phaseout plan, together with a timebound roadmap; (ii) restructuring plans for SCITI and \nBSTI  or  plans  for  their  strategic  reorientation;  (iii) recommendations  on  the  rationalization  of \nexisting SME credit facilities provided by the Government; and (iv) conceptual design of clusters \nand industrial parks.  \n \n84. \nDesign  and  Development  of  SME  Web  Portal/Virtual  Front  Office.  The  SME  web \nportal will (i) disseminate information about SMEs in Bangladesh such that any local or foreign \nbuyer or investor can easily reach the SMEs and initiate any business relationship; (ii) facilitate \ne-governance  and  provide  online  information  for  SMEs  on  government  facilities  and  services, \nsuch  as  requirements  for  business  registration,  licensing  and  product  certification;  and \n(iii) contain a library of SME-related information, such as a list of BDS providers and link to the \nSME  database.  This  will  require  a  wide-area  network  connecting  remote  nodes  located  in \ndistricts outside Dhaka with the data center in the SME Cell at MOI. \n \nEstablishment  and  Operation  of  SME  Helpline  Outreach  Centers.  This  component \n85. \nwill  assist  in  establishing  SME  helpline  outreach  centers  at  the  district  offices  of  BSCIC  and \nfacilities of the Dhaka and Chittagong chambers of commerce and industry to provide advisory \nsupport  to  facilitate  SME  access  to  government  services,  including  registration  and  licensing. \nThe helpline outreach centers will be linked to the SME web portal to facilitate their services to \nSMEs. \n \n86. \nTargeted SME Capacity Building. SCITI, in collaboration with FBCCI, district chambers \nand  line  associations  of  FBCCI,  accredited  women  entrepreneurs\u2019  associations,  National \nAssociation  of  Small  and  Cottage  Industries  of  Bangladesh,  and  helpline  outreach  centers \nwhere  available,  will  carry  out  suitable  and  affordable  training  programs  targeted  for \n\n\f 26\n\n(i) entrepreneurs  and  small  enterprises  in  rural  areas;  (ii) women  entrepreneurs;  (iii) displaced \nworkers  in  the  RMG  industry;  and  (iv) PFIs  under  SEF,  or  other  FIs  that  may  wish  to  avail  of \nthese  training  services.  The  TA  will  strengthen  capacity  of  SCITI  to  implement  these  training \nprograms  on  a  continuing  basis.  In  addition,  the  TA  loan  will  provide  capacity-building \nassistance  for  PFIs  to  establish  or  improve  their  SME  financing  systems  and  procedures  and \nadopt  new  financing  modalities  such  as  cash-flow-based  lending,  and  movable  asset-based \nsecured transactions to enhance their SME credit operations. \n \nUpgrading of Product Certification System to International Standard. Assistance in \n87. \nterms  of  advice,  capacity  building,  and  equipment  facilities  will  be  provided  to  improve  the \nquality  of  product  certification  system  in  Bangladesh  to  international  standard  in  collaboration \nwith  the  planned  project  of  the  European  Commission  and  United  Nations  Industrial \nDevelopment  Organization.  Certification  services  to  SMEs  will  be  facilitated.  The  TA  loan  will \nalso  assist  BSTI  in  conducting  campaigns  to  promote  the  importance  of  product  certification \namong SMEs and help guide SMEs through the certification process. \n \nDevelopment  of  Integrated  SME  Database.  Consulting  inputs  will  be  needed  for  the \n88. \nplanning, design, and development of an SME database. Using a registry of SMEs as sampling \nframe, a nationwide survey will be conducted to capture attributes of the SMEs. The database \ndesign  will  define  SME  populations  and  their  characteristics  by  industry,  sector,  geographic \nlocation, and development contributions, e.g., employment and value added. \n \n89. \nEnvironmental  Assessment  and  Monitoring.  This  TA  loan  component  will  assist  in \nbuilding  up  capacity  of  the  executing  agency  (EA),  implementing  agencies  (IAs),  and  PFIs  to \nensure compliance with ADB\u2019s environmental safeguard policy. PFIs will be assisted in setting \nup an environmental impact monitoring system.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCosts and Financing \n\n \n90. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  loan  project  is  estimated  at  $8.46  million  equivalent,  of  which \n$5.0  million  equivalent  will  be  financed  by  ADB,  and  $3.46  million  equivalent  by  the \nGovernment,  and  the  project  beneficiaries  including  SMEs,  PFIs,  training  participants, \nchambers, and associations, as summarized in Table 3. For the SME targeted training and the \nhelpline outreach centers, it is assumed that chambers and associations under the umbrella of \nthe FBCCI  will contribute under a public-private partnership arrangement. The contributions of \nthe private sector will be by way of fees for training and advisory services and use of facilities. \n(Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 8.) \n \n91. \nADB will provide the TA loan of SDR3.318 million ($5 million equivalent) from its Special \nFunds resources for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, interest rate of 1% \nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  other  terms  and \nconditions set out in the TA Loan Agreement to cover the total foreign exchange cost and part of \nthe local currency cost. The TA loan will finance consulting services, procurement of equipment, \nworkshops  and  seminars,  surveys,  and  report  preparation.  Interest  during  the  implementation \nperiod will be capitalized. The TA loan will be implemented over 2.5 years and the loan closing \ndate is expected to be 30 June 2008.  \n \n\n\f \n\nSource \n\nTable 3: Summary of Technical Assistance Loan Cost and Financing  \n($) \n \n\nA.

An \nimprest account will be established for MOI at a commercial bank approved by the Ministry of \nFinance  (MOF).  The  imprest  account  will  be  replenished  as  eligible  expenditures  are  incurred \nand  liquidated.  The  initial  advance  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  estimated \nexpenditures for the first 6 months of the project loan or 10% of the respective loan amount (i.e., \n$500,000  equivalent),  whichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed, \nand  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  and  detailed \narrangements  as  agreed  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedures may be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances made into \nthe  imprest  account  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Statement  of \nexpenditures procedures will be applicable to individual payments amounting to $50,000 or less. \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements for the Sector Development Program \n\n1. \n\nProgram and Project Management \n\n \n96. \nCentral Program Coordination Unit. The Ministry of Finance, Finance Division (MOF-\nFD)  will  be  the  EA  for  SMESDP.  MOF-FD  will  establish  a  central  program  coordinating  unit \n(CPCU) that will coordinate activities between the various entities involved in delivering outputs \nof the Program. The CPCU will be in charge of supporting and overseeing the implementation of \n\n\f \n\n29\n\npolicy  actions  including  compliance  with  tranche  conditions  and  related  project  and  TA \ncomponents  under  SMESDP.  It  will  ensure  that  adequate  counterpart  resources  are  made \navailable. The CPCU will liaise with the IAs to ensure effective management, close monitoring, \nand  timely  reporting.  It  will  ensure  timely  submission  by  each  IA  of  reports  that  will  be \nconsolidated  for  transmission  to  ADB.  The  CPCU  will  be  the  focal  point  for  coordination  of \nSMESDP  and  communication  with  private  sector  stakeholders  and  external  agencies, \nparticularly ADB, regarding the Program. The CPCU will be headed by the SMESDP program \ncoordinator  at  the  level  of  joint  secretary  directly  reporting  to  the  secretary,  MOF-FD.  Such \ncoordinator  will  also  function  as  the  project  director  and  will  be  assisted  by  the  project \nconsultants  to  be  engaged  under  the  TA  grant.  The  program  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 9. (The program organization chart is in Supplementary Appendix 4.) \n \n\n2. \n\nProgram and Project Implementation Units \n\n \n97.  MOI as IA for the Program Loan. The SME Cell set up at MOI will provide secretariat \nsupport initially to the SME Task Force and subsequently to the SME Advisory Panel in drafting \nthe  SME  policy  and  development  framework  as  well  as  the  action  program  to  support  the \ndevelopment strategy, and will be responsible for its implementation. Further, the SME Cell will \nundertake  policy  research  and  prepare  reports  for  consideration  by  the  Guidance  Committee. \nMOI  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  on  the  program  loan  and  submit  such  reports  to \nMOF-FD for submission to ADB.  \n \n98. \nBangladesh Bank as IA for the Project Loan. BB, as administrator or facility manager \nof SEF, will (i) provide information to ADB on candidate PFIs including its assessment of their \neligibility  for  SEF;  (ii) disqualify  any  PFI  that  has  become  ineligible  based  on  a  semiannual \nreview; and (iii) review utilization and repayments of subloans/subleases of PFIs. In accordance \nwith  the  administrative  agreement  with  the  Government,  BB  will  maintain  proper  accounts, \nprocedures, and records adequate to monitor and record the progress of subprojects financed \nby  PFIs  out  of  the  subsidiary  loans  every  6  months.  BB  will  review  and  report  to  ADB  the \nutilization of the facility through progress reports every 3 months. The terms and conditions of \nthe  facility will  be  amended  as necessary  based  on  the  outcome  of  the  review  in  coordination \nwith ADB and WB to increase utilization of the fund and respond to market needs. BB will also \nmonitor the socioeconomic and environmental  benefits of the subprojects. In this regard, ADB \nwill provide TA grant resources for benefit monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n99.  MOI  as  IA  for  the  TA  Loan.  The  SME  Cell  will  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  TA \nloan to ensure the timely recruitment and effective supervision of consultants. The SME Cell will \nclosely  coordinate  with  and  submit  required  reports  to  the  CPCU.  Under  the  TA  grant,  the \nconsultants will provide technical and administrative support to the SME Cell. \n \n\n3. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n100.  Accounting and Auditing. MOF-FD will keep a record of the utilization of the SMESDP \nloans and will ensure that the record keeping and accounting done by the IAs follow accounting \nand  financial  management  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  IAs  will  maintain  separate \nrecords  and  accounts  for  the  SMESDP  loan  components,  which  will  be  audited  annually  in \naccordance  with  sound  accounting  standards  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB. \nAnnual  audited  reports  and  financial  statements,  in  English,  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  6 \nmonths  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year.  The  auditor\u2019s  opinion  of  that  part  of  the  examination \nrelating to the imprest account should be separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report.  \n \n\n\f 30\n\n101.  Reporting.  MOF-FD  will  monitor  implementation  of  SMESDP.  Through  the  CPCU, \nMOF-FD  will  prepare  quarterly  a  consolidated  progress  report  on  SMESDP  (including  a  BB \nreport  on  accredited  PFIs  and  review  of  utilization  of  SEF  as  stated  in  para.  98)  in  a  format \nacceptable to ADB that gives information on implementation progress, issues encountered, and \nmeasures  taken  to  resolve  them,  and  the  status  of  compliance  with  loan  covenants.  The \nprogress  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  not  later  than  30  days  after  the  end  of  the  relevant \nquarter.  MOF-FD  will  submit  to  ADB  a  completion  report  for  SMESDP  within  3  months  of  the \nend  of  the  program  period.  The  completion  report  will  provide  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the \nSMESDP design and implementation including performance of the IAs, associated government \nentities, consultants, and the socioeconomic and outreach impact of the Program.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n\n \n102.  The  TA  grant  will  support  program  implementation  and  coordination  to  ensure  timely \ncompliance  with  policy  conditions  and  other  deliverables  to  achieve  the  stated  outcomes.  The \nTA  will  (i) assist  in  operationalizing  the  SME  Cell;  (ii) assist  the  SME  Advisory  Panel  in \nformulating  an  action  program  for  the  implementation  of  the  SME  policy  and  development \nframework;  (iii) assist  in  establishing  and  operationalizing  the  SME  Foundation;  (iv) strengthen \nmonitoring  and  reporting  of  the  implementation  of  various  components  under  SMESDP  to \nenable  timely  corrective  action  if  needed;  (v) build  up  capacity  of  the  EA  and  IAs  in \nimplementing  the  activities  and  monitoring  benefits  of  SMESDP;  (vi) provide  administrative \nsupport  to  the  CPCU  and  the  SME  Cell  in  the  procurement  of  equipment,  recruitment  of \nconsultants, and provision of other resources needed; (vii) coordinate all activities between the \nEA,  IAs,  and  other  private  and  public  sector  stakeholders;  (viii) assist  in  and  monitor  the \nimplementation  of  the  gender  action  plan;  and  (ix)  build  up  capacity  of  PFIs  under  SEF  in \nmonitoring benefits of the SME loans.  \n \n103.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  to  be  $750,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide \n$600,000  equivalent  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  program  to  cover  the  foreign \nexchange cost and part of the local currency cost of the TA. The Government will provide the \nremaining $150,000 equivalent through the provision of counterpart staff, offices, transportation, \nand  incidental  expenses.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  the  implementation  period  of  the \nSMESDP. MOF-FD will be the EA and MOI will be the IA of the TA. Individual consultants will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of local consultants. Detailed objectives, \nscope, terms of reference of consulting services, and target dates for submission of consultants\u2019 \nreports are in Appendix 10. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts  \n\n \nA. \n \n104.  Policy  Measures.  SMESDP  will  be  the  principal  vehicle  in  the  formulation  and \nimplementation of SME-targeted public policy that has been developed through a participatory \nprocess involving all stakeholders. The growth of the SME sector supported by the Program will \nhelp generate employment, promote economic growth, and reduce poverty. SMEs will benefit in \na number of ways, among others. First, targeted SME policy measures will guide the concerned \ngovernment agencies in providing support to the SME sector. Second, tax incentives will reduce \nthe  financial  burden  and  enhance  viability  of  small  start-up  enterprises.  Third,  more  extensive \noutreach of guidance and handholding assistance will be provided through the SME web portal \nand  helpline  outreach  centers.  Fourth,  there  will  be  centralized  information  regarding  market \n\n\f \n\n31\n\nopportunities  and  improved  linkages  to  international  markets.  Fifth,  SMEs  will  have  improved \naccess  to  capacity  building,  training,  and  BDS.  Sixth,  e-governance  registration  that  will  be \nmade possible using the SME web portal will promote transparency and minimize opportunities \nfor  rent  seeking.  Lastly,  improved  quality  of  the  product  certification  system  and  enhanced \nacceptability of Bangladeshi products in international markets will allow SMEs to broaden their \nforeign market access and increase international competitiveness. \n \n105. \nInstitutional.  SMESDP  will  support  the  development  of  institutional  mechanisms  and \nprovide  the  opportunity  for  the  mobilization  of  public  policy  bodies  at  the  highest  level  of  the \nGovernment  to  promote  the  SME  sector.  At  the  implementation  level,  SMESDP  will  provide \ncapacity-building  assistance  to  the  SME  Cell  and  SME  Advisory  Panel  to  develop  and \nimplement  an  action  program,  and  will  assist  in  establishing  and  operationalizing  the  SME \nFoundation in the form of public-private partnership as a dedicated SME development agency \non a sustainable basis. Further, the Program will support studies to improve the effectiveness of \nthe  concerned  agencies  that  provide  services  to  SMEs;  prepare  a  plan  for  their  restructuring \nand  strategic  reorientation;  rationalize  and  enhance  effectiveness  of  government  credit \nassistance to SMEs; and provide capacity-building assistance.  \n \n106.  Financial. Small enterprises will have better access to credit through SEF. The Program \nwill  also  enhance  the  capabilities  of  PFIs  in  extending  credit  to  SMEs.  Given  more  familiarity \nwith the SME sector, and enhanced capabilities of their staff, PFIs are expected to focus more \non the SME segment and strengthen their SME unit. PFIs will be able to grow and diversify their \nportfolios, in the process building their base of recurring earning assets. It is anticipated that at \nleast 15 PCBs and 13 NBFIs will use SEF. Capacity-building assistance for the development of \nSME lending systems and procedures will be provided for PFIs. Training will be provided to over \n1,000 SME credit staff. As a result, it is envisaged that the volume of SME loans will increase by \nat  least  15.8%  annually  on  average  during  FY2005\u2013FY2007  from  a  historical  rate  of  about \n12.3% per annum. Moreover, it is estimated that over 10,000 subloans/subleases will be made \nthrough PFIs under SEF throughout the life of the ADB loan. Lending to SMEs will have a strong \nlinkage impact on BDS providers who will likely respond to generated demand for their services \nand PFI referrals. \n \n107.  Economic and Poverty.  On a strategic level, SMESDP will contribute to the country\u2019s \ngoal  of  raising  real  economic  growth,  creating  employment,  and  reducing  poverty  incidence. \nSMESDP will promote the growth of employment in the SME sector by at least 8% per annum \nthroughout the program implementation period. It is estimated that over 8,000 participants from \nSMEs,  including  2,000  women,  will  undergo  training  to  be  conducted  by  SCITI  in  partnership \nwith  chambers  and  associations  during  the  TA  loan  implementation  period.  It  is  projected  that \nabout 150,000 entrepreneurs and other individuals interested in setting up an enterprise will visit \nand  use  the  services  of  the  helpline  outreach  centers  and  at  least  half  will  be  repeat  visits  by \nregular  clients.  Over  12,000  RMG  workers  will  undergo  training  and  at  least  50%  will  be \nreemployed during the TA implementation period. \n \n108.  Safeguards.  The  BB  unit  designated  to  manage  SEF  will  monitor  PFIs\u2019  adherence  to \nADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  as  well  as  to \nADB\u2019s policies on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. PFIs are to be advised not \nto lend or lease to companies in the negative list (those not complying), and will have to report \nany  violation  or  noncompliance  by  their  borrowers  with  health,  safety,  and  environmental \nregulations. Provision to this effect will be made in the participation agreement with the PFIs as \nindicated  in  the  Project  Agreement  between  BB  and  ADB.  As  for  environmental  safeguards, \nADB\u2019s own due diligence will identify areas for remedy, including training as necessary. Since \n\n\f 32\n\nRisks \n\nthe  PFIs\u2019  subloans/subleases  to  SMEs  will  be  largely  in  the  light-manufacturing,  agro-\nprocessing,  trade,  and  services  sectors,  and  since  none  is  expected  in  infrastructure,  it  is \nunlikely  that  involuntary  resettlement  or  detrimental  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  will  occur. \n(The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy,  which  includes  a  gender  action  plan \nsection, is in Appendix 11.) \n \nB. \n \n109.  Despite changes in officials at the helm of the Government, it is expected that reforms \nunder  the  Program  will  continue  unhampered  given  the  high  priority  assigned  to  SME \ndevelopment  and  the  Government\u2019s  strong  commitment  as  exemplified  in  the  formation  of  the \nSME  Task  Force  spearheaded  by  the  principal  secretary.  Regulatory  reforms  will  continue  to \ncreate  a  more  conducive  environment  for  private  sector  development.  Stakeholders  will \nparticipate  in  the  consultation  process  and  policy  dialogue  for  the  SME  development.  The \nholding of the SME workshop in February 2004, where over 100 participants from the public and \nprivate sectors participated, is a clear indication of strong stakeholder interest. The fact that the \nGovernment initiated the process of consultation leading to the development of the SME policy \nand development framework demonstrates the Government\u2019s ownership of policy reforms. \n \n110.  The  implementation  risks  have  been  addressed  through  the  institutional  mechanism, \nwhich involves all tiers in the Government including the NCID at the top policy level, Guidance \nCommittee  at  the  ministerial  level,  and  the  dedicated  SME  Cell  and  SME  Foundation  at  the \nimplementation level. The TA grant will provide capacity-building assistance to the EA and IAs \nin carrying out activities under the Program. To successfully implement the restructuring plan of \nthe concerned agencies under MOI, it is essential that qualified professionals be recruited to run \nthe  organizations.  The  salary  and  incentive  structure  of  the  government  employees  should  be \nreviewed to attract such professionals.  \n \n111.  The Program also reduces risks and institutes checks and balances through the use of \nparticipatory  consultation  mechanisms  and  public-private  partnerships.  The  SME  policy  and \ndevelopment  framework  will  be  developed  through  consultation  and  participation  of  various \nstakeholders  and  will  be  disseminated  to  the  public  through  publication  in  newspapers  of \nnationwide  circulation  The  SME  Foundation  will  have  private  sector  representatives  on  its \nboard.  The  private  sector  through  FBCCI  and  the  business  associations  and  chamber  bodies \nwill  be  involved  in  program  implementation  and  make  a  substantial  contribution  to  the  total \nresources, in addition to their business network, practical knowledge and skills, and linkages to \nsources of market information and technology.  \n \n112.  For the expansion of their loan portfolio to accommodate SMEs, it is assumed that the \nPFIs will increasingly view lending to SMEs through setting up dedicated SME units staffed with \ncapable personnel, efficient systems, and proper procedures. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n113.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which are incorporated into the program, project and TA loan documents: \n \n114.  For the program loan: \n\n(i) \n\nThe Government will maintain the policies adopted and actions taken prior to the \ndate of the Program Loan Agreement and promptly adopt the other policies and \n\n\f \n\n33\n\n \n115.  For the project loan: \n\ntake the other actions included in the SMESDP, in each case as described in the \ndevelopment policy letter and the policy matrix, and ensure that such policies and \nactions  continue  in  effect  for  the  duration  of  SMESDP  and  subsequently.  The \nGovernment will consult with ADB in preparing and finalizing the SME policy and \ndevelopment framework, including the inclusion as appropriate of internationally \naccepted market-based principles regarding SME development. \nThe  Government  will  ensure,  through  an  active  consultation  process,  the \nparticipation  of  various  stakeholders  including  the  private  sector,  financial \ninstitutions,  development  partners,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  research \nand  academic  institutions  in  the  finalization  and  implementation  of  the  SME \npolicy  and  development  framework  and  the  components  under  such  policy,  as \ndetailed in the policy matrix.  \nThe Government will ensure that (i) women entrepreneurs are represented in the \npreparation  of  the  SME  policy  and  development  framework,  and  (ii)  women \nentrepreneurs  are  represented  on  the  NCID.  The  Government  will  also  ensure \nthat the SME database has gender-disaggregated data.  \n\nBB will ensure that the PFIs satisfy the selection and ongoing eligibility criteria to \nserve as a PFI under the SEF described in para. 66 above. BB will also ensure \nthat subprojects are selected based on the criteria described in para. 64 above. \nA minimum of 10% of SEF will be earmarked for lending to women entrepreneurs \nto  ensure  access  by  women  borrowers.  Earmarked  funds  that  are  not  utilized \nwithin a period of 1.5 years will revert to the general pool. \nActivities  financed  through  the  subloans  and  subleases  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  applicable  ADB  procurement,  environment, \ninvoluntary \nresettlement, and other guidelines and policies. With respect to the environment, \nthe  Government  will  carry  out  the  Project  in  compliance  with  the  relevant  laws \nand regulations and ADB's Environment Policy (2002). The Government will also \nensure  that  BB  develops  an  appropriate  environmental  monitoring  system \ncomprising  policy  and  procedures  for  monitoring  of  and  reporting  on  PFIs\u2019 \nimplementing  compliance  by \nenvironmental  management  systems \nsubborrowers with all relevant environmental regulations.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  performance  of  SME  credit  facilities \ncurrently administered directly by various government agencies and public sector \nFIs is reviewed and measures are taken to improve the targeting and efficiency \nof utilization of such facilities. \nThe Government will ensure that, in a phased manner, management of the SME \ncredit  facilities  currently  directly  administered  by  the  Government  will  be \ntransferred to the SME Foundation to be established under the Program. \n\nfor \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n116.  For  the  TA  loan,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  (i)  targeted  training  programs  for \nwomen  entrepreneurs  are  developed  to  address  their  specific  needs;  and  (ii)  a  forum  is \norganized to allow women labor and employees to discuss their training and capacity building \nneeds; such needs shall be taken into consideration in the training programs under the TA loan. \n \n117.  Conditions  for  Effectiveness  of  the  Program,  Project,  and  TA  Loan  Agreements. \nConditions for effectiveness will include cross-effectivity such that effectiveness of any of these \nagreements  will  require  satisfaction  of  all  conditions  of  effectiveness  of  the  other  two \nagreements (excluding effectiveness of such other agreements).  \n\n\f 34\n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n118.  Condition  for  Disbursement  of  the  Project  Loan.

The  Industrial  Policy  1999  defines  SMEs  as  enterprises  employing \n1. \nfewer  than  99  workers  and/or  with  a  fixed  capital  investment  of  under  Tk300  million.1  The \nBangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics  (BBS)  classifies  enterprises  in  the  2001-2003  Census  of  Non-\nFarm Economic Activities (the Economic Census) according to total persons engaged and define \nmicroenterprises  as  those  with  total  persons  engaged  of  fewer  than  10,  small  between  10  to  49, \nmedium 50 to 99, and large 100 or more. Development partners involved in the SME sector have \ndifferent definitions of SMEs.2 The major commercial banks follow the Industrial Policy definition in \nterms of investment capital for lending purposes. In the new Industrial Policy, manufacturing SMEs \nare defined in terms of fixed investment excluding land and building: small, with fixed investment \nless than or equal to Tk15 million and medium, with fixed investment greater than Tk15 million and \nless than or equal to Tk100 million. For nonmanufacturing, small enterprises are those with fewer \nthan  25  full-time  employees,  and  medium  enterprises  with  between  25  and  100  full-time \nemployees. \n \n2. \nPopulation  of  SMEs.  There  are  varying  estimates  of  the  SME  population  in  line  with \ndifferent  definitions  of  what  constitutes  the  SME  sector.  The  most  recent  estimates  are  from  the \nEconomic Census, which covered a total of 3.68 million establishments including microenterprises \nof  fewer  than  10  persons  engaged,  which  constitute  the  informal  sector.  The  number  of  small, \nmedium, and large establishments totaling 85,427 is broken down by size: 74,629 are small, 5,125 \nmedium,  and  5,673  large.  The  breakdown  of  SMEs  into  urban  and  rural  is  as  follows:  48,584 \nurban-based  SMEs,  of  which  92.2%  are  small  and  7.8%  are  medium,  and  31,160  rural-based \nSMEs,  of  which  95.7%  are  small  and  4.3%  are  medium.  These  include  cottage  and  handloom \nindustries,  provided  the  total  number  of  persons  employed  is  10  or  more.  Total  number  of \nmanufacturing SMEs is 28,296 of which 14,755 are in urban areas and 13,541 are in rural areas. \nFrom the 2003 National Private Sector Survey of Enterprises in Bangladesh,3 it was estimated that \napproximately  6  million  micro-,  small,  and  medium  enterprises  (MSMEs)  defined  as  enterprises \nwith fewer than 100 employees are operating in Bangladesh. The MSMEs are generally very small \nin  size,  with  5  workers  on  average  (including  the  proprietor);  about  90%  of  MSMEs  have  10  or \nfewer workers,4 and less than 2% have 50 or more workers. MSMEs are heavily concentrated in \nwholesale  and  retail  trade,  production  and  sale  of  agricultural  goods,  and  manufacturing.  Over \nthree quarters of MSMEs are located in rural areas.  \n \n3. \nSignificance of SMEs. SMEs have a significant role in generating growth and employment. \nSMEs  are  reported  to  account  for  about  40%  of  the  gross  manufacturing  output,  about  80%  of \nindustrial employment, and about 25% of the total labor force in Bangladesh. In 1991, Bangladesh \nSmall and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) reported around 0.81 million employed in small \nenterprises and 1.67 million in cottage industries. The Economic Census reports total employment \nof 3.90 million in the nonfarm formal sector, with 1.37 million employed in small enterprises, 0.34 \n                                                 \n1   Most  enterprises  located  in  the  BSCIC  industrial  estates,  other  than  the  major  ones  in  Chittagong,  Dhaka,  and \n\nNarayanganj, are reported to have asset values in the range between Tk0.2 million and Tk10 million. \n\n2  The issue of non-uniform and inconsistent definitions was one of the major topics discussed in the February 2004 SME \n\nworkshop supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) held in Dhaka. \n\n3  The survey was funded by the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom (DFID), United States \nAgency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  and  Cooperation,  and  Swedish \nInternational  Development  Cooperation  Agency.  Conducted  from  March  to  June  2003,  it  enumerated  10,096 \nenterprises (defined as income-generating households or activities that market at least 75% of their products).  \n\n4   The  balance  of  10%  of  the  estimated  population,  about  600,000,  can  be  considered  to  be  in  the  SME  category. \nHowever, this number is excessively higher than other estimates. In part, it includes enterprises in the farm sector. \n\n \n\n\f \n48\n\nAppendix 3 \n\nIssues and Constraints \n\nmillion  in  medium  enterprises,  and  2.19  million  in  large  enterprises.  The  2003  Private  Sector \nSurvey  estimated  that  the  MSMEs  employ  31  million  and  contribute  20\u201325%  of  total  gross \ndomestic product. \n \n4. \nDistribution  by  Sector.    In  manufacturing,  56%  of  enterprises  are  in  food  and  allied \nproducts.  A  distant  second  in  terms  of  numbers,  is  the  textiles,  wearing  apparel,  and  leather \nindustries  category.  Over  the  past  two  decades,  the  share  of  food  and  allied  products  has \ndecreased  and  that  of  textiles,  wearing  apparel,  and  leather  industries  has  increased,  and  other \nindustries have grown with the introduction of new and more modern products. The growth of the \nreadymade garments industry, which directly employs over 1.5 million workers, mostly women, and \nindirectly supports employment of up to 15 million, is phenomenal. Food products and textile and \ngarment firms account for over 60% of registered SMEs. In recent years, there has been a rapid \ngrowth  in  numbers  and  types  of  activities  of  SMEs  in  the  service  sector;  however,  these  are \ngenerally  of  very  small  size  and  there  is  scant  information  regarding  these  enterprises. \nNonetheless, their economic potential is expected to be significant, considering their contribution to \nemployment.  \n \n5. \nWomen Entrepreneurs and Women-Run SMEs. The majority of women entrepreneurs in \nBangladesh  fall  under  the  categories  of  either  micro  or  small.  At  least  86%  of  women \nentrepreneurs  are  believed  to  be  home-based  and  categorized  as  microenterprises.  Women \nentrepreneurs  are  heavily  concentrated  in  manufacturing  of  clothing,  retail  sales  not  in  stores, \nspinning and weaving of textiles, and livestock and dairy production. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nDespite positive macroeconomic figures, Bangladesh remains one of the poorest countries \nin  the  world,  with  a  per  capita  income  of  around  $385,  and  income  poverty  of  50%.  Although \nBangladesh has performed well in the past decade both on macroeconomic and social indicators, \nthe country has not reached its growth potential. A survey of 1,000 manufacturing firms conducted \nin 1992 for an investment climate assessment by the World Bank reported that the main obstacles \nto  their  growth  are:  (i) poor  physical  infrastructure;  (ii) frequent  power  outages  and  surges; \n(iii) pervasive  corruption;  (iv) regulatory  governance  problems;  and  (v) limited  access  to  finance. \nIneffective,  inadequate,  and  antiquated  laws  and  regulations;  non-enforcement  of  existing  laws; \nand weaknesses coupled with lack of transparency and accountability in the bureaucracy, judiciary, \nand legislative bodies further complicates business operations. The culture of informal payments, \nkickbacks,  and  political  interference  remains  prevalent.  The  discretionary  powers  afforded  to  the \ninspecting authorities are also abused. While these problems affect all enterprises irrespective of \nsize,  SMEs  are  disproportionately  affected  due  to  their  small  scale  of  operations  and  limited \nresources to address the problems.  \n \nThe proposed Small and Medium Enterprise Sector Development Program (SMESDP) aims \n7. \nat introducing policy reforms and creating support infrastructure targeted at SMEs to enhance their \ncapabilities  and  facilitate  their  access  to  necessary  resources  to  deal  with  the  regulatory,  credit, \ncapacity,  and  other  key  constraints.

Yes \nIn its National Strategy for Economic Growth, Poverty \nReduction, \n(the \nGovernment\u2019s  Interim  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy \nPaper [I-PRSP]), dated March 2003, the Government \nidentified five broad sets of policies to reduce poverty: \n(i) pro-poor \n(ii) human \ndevelopment, (iii) women\u2019s advancement and closing \nof  gender  gaps, \n(iv) social  protection,  and \n(v) participatory  governance.  The  development  of \nsmall and medium enterprises (SMEs)  will contribute \nto pro-poor economic growth.  \n\neconomic \n\ngrowth, \n\n \nSector identified as a national priority in country \npoverty partnership agreement?  Yes \nUnder  the  poverty  partnership  agreement  signed  in \nApril 2000, the Government\u2019s strategy for reduction of \nincome  poverty  and  human  poverty  is  to  accelerate \neconomic  growth  and  ensure  adequate  supply  of \nbasic  needs.  Poverty  reduction  will  be  facilitated \nthrough expansion of private investment and nonfarm \nemployment, especially in less developed rural areas. \nThe  Government  supports \nthe  development  of \nfinancial  intermediation  to  meet  the  requirements  of \nSMEs in rural areas. \n\n \n\n \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh: \n\n \nAs  a  consequence  of  steady  economic  growth  during  the  past  decade,  income  poverty  in  Bangladesh  has \ndeclined from 59% to 50%. However, poverty rates and absolute numbers are still very high, and considerable \nurban-rural and regional disparities exist. Bangladesh remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with a \nper capita income of around $385. To achieve the goal of halving the poverty level by 2015, Bangladesh needs \nto  sustain  a  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  rate  of  about  7%  per  year  over  the  next  10  years.  The \ndevelopment of SMEs is one of the priority policy measures to promote pro-poor growth. The SME sector has \nplayed a very important role in the economy and accounts for about 40% of gross manufacturing output, 80% \nof industrial employment, and 25% of the total labor force. Many SMEs are concentrated in certain industries, \nsuch as the textile and garment industry, which accounts for about 75% of the country\u2019s exports. SMEs have \nincreased participation in the rural economy, where most of the poor live, providing livelihood and employment \nopportunities in agro-processing, food production, and nonfarm rural economic activities. However, SMEs have \nnot been able to attain its full potential in contributing to economic growth and poverty reduction due to various \nbottlenecks in the SME sector (such as lack of access to credit, market, and business support services), and \nstructural  problems  in  the  overall  business  environment  (such  as  poor  law  and  order,  weak  governance, \ninadequate  infrastructure,  and  market  failures  in  the  financial  sector).  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (SMESDP)  will  aim  at  strengthening  the  policy  environment  and  providing  support \ninfrastructure for SMEs to improve access  by SMEs to credit  and related support services to  help  overcome \nconstraints to their efficient operation, growth, and expansion. \n \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis                                              Targeting Classification: General Intervention (GI)    \n\n \nSMESDP  is  expected  to  have  direct  poverty  impact  through  an  improved  access  to  necessary  resources  for \nthe  SME  operations  including  credit  and  capacity-building  support  targeted  at  the  small  end  of  SMEs  and \ndisadvantaged  groups  such  as  SMEs  located  in  rural  area,  women  entrepreneurs,  and  workers  in  the \nreadymade  garment  (RMG)  industry  displaced  due  to  the  phaseout  of  the  Multi-Fibre  Arrangement  (MFA). \nFurther, SMESDP will introduce policy reforms and create support infrastructure to facilitate the growth of the \nSME sector and consequently promote  economic activities  through supply chain  linkage between SMEs and \nother businesses. Various components under SMESDP will contribute to poverty reduction, as follows. \n\n \nImproved  Access  to  Credit.  Lack  of  access  to  finance  is  one  of  the  main  impediments  to  SME  growth. \nBecause of their limited financial base, SMEs face difficulties raising funds from the formal sector. SMEs often \nborrow money from relatives and friends, or from informal credit sources that are costly and inadequate. The \nproblem  is  more  pronounced  for  the  \u201cmissing  middle\u201d  group,  consisting  of  enterprises  that  are  too  large  for \nfunding from nongovernment organizations, microfinance institutions, or government assistance programs but \ntoo  small  for  formal  bank  borrowing.  The  Program  will  directly  address  this  gap  by  contributing  to  the  Small \nEnterprise Fund (SEF),  which  was set up by the Government to be channeled through participating financial \ninstitutions (PFIs) to small enterprises that have fixed assets of less than Tk10 million. \n \nProvision of Incentives. Currently, the Government provides a tax holiday for newly established enterprises, \nirrespective of size. However, this tax holiday scheme is expected to be abolished in the next fiscal year. Given \ntheir  small  scale  of  operations  and  more  limited  resources,  SMEs  will  be  more  adversely  affected  by  the \ndiscontinuance of the tax holiday. SMESDP will support other tax measures, i.e., 75% income tax rebate and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f72\n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\naccelerated  depreciation  rates,  in  lieu  of  the  tax  holiday.  These  incentives  will  be  provided  to  very  small \nenterprises,  which  have  fixed  assets  excluding  land  and  building  of  less  than  Tk3  million,  to  alleviate  their \nfinancial burden and enhance their viability during the startup phase. \n \nTargeted Training and Capacity-Building Assistance. Training programs under SMESDP will be targeted at \na disadvantaged group of SMEs, i.e., those in the rural areas and women entrepreneurs. In addition, SMESDP \nwill  support  retraining  programs  of  displaced  RMG  workers  which  will  be  demand  driven  taking  into  account \nskills  requirements  of  prospective  employers.  These  training  programs  will  be  implemented  in  collaboration \nwith  the  Federation  of  Bangladesh  Chambers  of  Commerce  and  Industry  (FBCCI),  which  has  affiliated  with \ndistrict chambers and business associations as well as women entrepreneurs\u2019 associations. This public-private \npartnership  is  expected  to  have  outreach  impact  through  business  network  and  linkages  between  these \nchambers and associations and SMEs in their respective areas.  \n \nMore Effective Public Service Institutions. Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC), \nthe principal government organization mandated to promote the development of small and cottage industries \n(SCIs) has an  institutional  network of industry service centers in 64 districts, industrial  estates in  all districts, \nproduct  development  projects,  poverty  alleviation  projects,  Small  and  Cottage  Industries  Training  Institute \n(SCITI),  Design  Center,  and  skills  development  centers.  Despite  its  long  experience  in  the  sector,  its \nperformance  has  not  met  expectations.  The  Program  will  conduct  a  diagnostic  study  of  BSCIC  to  identify \nrestructuring alternatives, move BSCIC towards a leaner and more effective organization, and strengthen the \nrole of BSCIC\u2019s district offices in the delivery of government assistance to SCIs nationwide. SCITI will also be \nstrengthened to play a more effective role in implementing demand-driven training programs on a sustainable \nbasis.  In  addition,  SMESDP  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  Bangladesh  Standards  and  Testing  Institution \n(BSTI) in  its  product  certification  function  to  ensure  the  credibility  of  BSTI\u2019s  certification  mark.  SMEs  will  be \nprovided  with  a  special  window  to  access  BSTI\u2019s  services.  BSTI  will  conduct  public  awareness  campaigns \nespecially  among  SMEs  to  encourage  them  to  comply  with  the  product  certification  requirements.  The \nimprovement in quality of SME products will enhance export potential and generate additional income. A study \nwill be conducted to identify industries with potential to be developed into clusters or industrial parks. This will \nbe  a  step  towards  identifying  competitive  advantage  of  enterprises,  providing  appropriate  infrastructure  to \nnurture  their  growth,  thus  diversifying  Bangladeshi  exports  and  preparing  the  country  for  the  entry  into  the \nWorld  Trade  Organization.  Making  these  industries  competitive  in  the  world  market  will  not  only  improve \neconomic growth, but also reduce vulnerabilities, especially of the poor.   \n \nMore  Extensive  Outreach  of  SME  Support  Infrastructure.  SME  helpline  outreach  centers  will  be \nestablished  in  BSCIC\u2019s  district  offices  nationwide  in  phases.  First,  the  centers  will  be  set  up  in  Dhaka  and \nChittagong  and  then  expanded  to  at  least  half  of  districts  in  2.5  years.    The  helpline  outreach  centers  will \nprovide one-on-one \u201chandholding\u201d assistance and advisory services to SMEs. The presence of the centers in \nthe vicinity is expected to encourage SMEs and other persons interested to set up an enterprise to use their \nservices. \n \n \nC. \nStakeholder analysis prepared:  No \nStakeholder  Analysis.  The  Report  of  the  National  Task  Force  on  Development  of  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprises was based on the discussions in the Asian Development Bank-supported national SME workshop \nheld in February 2004 with participation from various stakeholders consisting of various government ministries \nand agencies, development partners, chambers and industry associations, financial institutions, and research \nand academic institutions to identify constraints, opportunities, and issues regarding the development of SMEs \nin the country. \n \nParticipation  Strategy.  The  implementation  of  SMESDP  will  be  based  on  public-private  collaborative \nprocesses. An SME Advisory Panel to be established  and mandated to develop an action plan to implement \nthe  SME  policy  will  consist  of  representatives  from  the  concerned  ministries,  industry  associations,  private \nsector, and academia. Beneficiaries under the training programs will participate in training need assessments. \nMoreover, a forum will be organized for women workers and entrepreneurs to express their training needs and \nother concerns. The participatory process will ensure the outreach of the Program to targeted beneficiaries.  \n \n \nD.  \nStrategy  to  maximize  impact  on  women.  The  Program  will  (i) encourage  participation  by  women \nentrepreneurs  and  women-owned  businesses  in  policy  advocacy;  (ii) facilitate  access  to  credit  by  women \nentrepreneurs; (iii) enhance women entrepreneurs\u2019 capacity, productivity, and competitiveness through training \nand provision of business development services (BDS); (iv) promote networking among women entrepreneurs\u2019 \n\nParticipation Strategy:  No \n\nGender and Development \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n73\n\nassociations for efficient delivery of government services and effective implementation of collaborative public-\nprivate  mechanisms;  and  (v) develop  a  gender-disaggregated  database  to  be  used  for  planning,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation of programs promoting and supporting women-run SMEs. \nGender plan prepared?

On  the  other  hand, \ntargeted  training  programs  and  helpline  outreach  centers \ncould  reach  out  to  indigenous  people  who  could  be  either \nSME entrepreneurs or employees.   \nRestructuring  of  concerned  agencies  involved  in  the  SME \nsector  could  also  cover  human  resource  rationalization. \nHowever,  analysis  of  restructuring  alternatives  will  also \nexplore \nthese \ninstitutions. Nevertheless, the Program is expected to have \nnet  positive \nthe  capacity-building \nassistance, especially the retraining programs for displaced \nRMG workers that will help them reenter the job market.  \nFirst,  SMEs  will  have  better  access  to  credit  at  a  lower \ncost.  Based  on  the  discussions  during  the  program \nprocessing  stage,  preidentified  PFIs  expect  to  pass  on \nlower  costs  from  SEF  to  SME  borrowers.  Further,  more \nintense  competition  is  expected  to  drive  down  the  interest \nrates.  Second,  tax  measures  will  reduce  the  financial \nburden of newly established small enterprises. Third, SCITI \nwill  ensure  that  training  programs  will  be  affordable  to \ntraining  participants.  SCITI  will  charge  for,  at  least,  cost \nrecovery  for  those  who  can  afford  to  pay  for  the  services. \nExceptions could be made for very small rural participants \nwho do not have capacity to pay training fees. \nNo other risks are anticipated. \n\nimpact \n\nfrom \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\u2022 Women  entrepreneurs  will  be  represented \n\nimplementation of the SME policy and action plan.  \n\nin  preparation  and \n\n\u2022 SME  database  will  have  gender-disaggregated  data  to  facilitate  the \nplanning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  women-targeted  policy \nmeasures. \n\n\u2022 At  least  10%  of  the  funds  of  the  SEF  will  be  earmarked  for  women \nborrowers  for  1.5  years,  or  more  depending  on  utilization  of  this \nallocation for lending to women borrowers. \n\n\u2022 Women  borrowers  will  be  provided  with  assistance  and  advisory \n\nservices for their loan applications.  \n\n\u2022 Women  entrepreneurs\u2019  associations  will  participate \n\nin \n\nthe \n\nto address their specific needs.  \n\nimplementation of the programs.  \n\n\u2022 A  forum  will  be  organized  for  women  entrepreneurs  and  workers  to \n\nexpress their training needs and other concerns. \n\nComponents and Targets for Gender Strategy  \n\nNone \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n \nF. \nComponent/Activity \nEnabling Environment for SMEs \n \n\nAccess to Credit by SMEs \n\nSME Capacity-Building Assistance \n\n\u2022 Targeted training programs for women entrepreneurs will be developed \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 November 2004) \n", "Currency Unit \nTk1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "taka (Tk) \n$0.0168 \nTk59.375 \n", " \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "ADB \nACC \nBB \nBBS \nBDS \nBSCIC \nBSTI \nCPCU \nDFID \nEA \nEGBM \nFBCCI \nFI \nFIL \nGDP \nIA \nIDLC \nIFC \nIMF \nIPDC \nI-PRSP \nMFA \nMIDAS \nMOF \nMOF-FD \nMOI \nMSME \nNASCIB \nNBFI \nNBR \nNCB \nNCID \nNPL \nOECD \nPCB \nPFI \nPRGF \nRJSC \nRMG \nSCI \nSCITI \nSEDF \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAnti-Corruption Commission \nBangladesh Bank \nBangladesh Bureau of Statistics \nbusiness development services \nBangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation \nBangladesh Standards and Testing Institution \ncentral program coordination unit \nDepartment for International Development  \nexecuting agency \nEnterprise Growth and Bank Modernization \nFederation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry \nfinancial institution \nfinancial intermediary loan \ngross domestic product \nimplementing agency \nIndustrial Development Leasing Company of Bangladesh Ltd. \nInternational Finance Corporation \nInternational Monetary Fund \nIndustrial Promotion & Development Company of Bangladesh Ltd. \ninterim poverty reduction strategy paper \nMulti-Fibre Arrangement \nMicro Industries Development Assistance and Services \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Finance, Finance Division \nMinistry of Industries  \nmicro, small, and medium enterprises \nNational Association of Small and Cottage Industries of Bangladesh \nnonbank financial institution \nNational Board of Revenue \nnationalized commercial bank \nNational Council for Industrial Development \nnonperforming loan \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \nprivate commercial bank \nparticipating financial institution \nPoverty Reduction and Growth Facility \nRegistrar of Joint Stock Companies \nreadymade garment \nsmall and cottage industry \nSmall and Cottage Industries Training Institute \nSouthAsia Enterprise Development Facility \n", " \n", " \n", "SEF \nSME \nSMESDP \nTA \nUSAID \nWB \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Small Enterprise Fund \nsmall and medium enterprise \nSME Sector Development Program \ntechnical assistance \nUnited States Agency for International Development \nWorld Bank \n", " \n \nNOTES \n \n", "(i) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  ends  on  30  June.
