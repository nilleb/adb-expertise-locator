THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nNepal for the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation (Sector) Project. \n \n2.  The project will support the Government of Nepal in expanding access to community-\nmanaged  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  in  20  project  municipalities  by  drawing  on \nexperiences and lessons from three earlier projects funded by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB).1 The project will finance climate-resilient and inclusive WSS infrastructure in project \nmunicipalities and strengthen institutional and community capacity, sustainable service delivery, \nand project development.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Urbanization. Since the establishment of 276 urban municipalities in 2015, 58% of \nNepal\u2019s  population  of  29  million  is  urban.  Out  of  3,900  municipalities,  including  58  urban \nmunicipalities, the Constitution of Nepal (2015) created 7 provinces and 77 districts with 6 \nmetropolitan and 11 sub-metropolitan cities, and 276 urban and 460 rural municipalities. Rapid \nurbanization\u2014resulting from migration, reclassification, and natural increase\u2014has widened the \nurban infrastructure deficit. Unmanaged urban growth and lack of improved WSS have led to \nenvironmental degradation, public health risks, increased vulnerability to the impacts of climate \nchange and natural hazards, a rise in urban poverty,3 and hampered economic growth. Since \n2000, Nepal has made strong efforts to improve access to WSS. It increased water supply \ncoverage from 73% to 84% and basic sanitation coverage from 30% to 81% between 2000 and \n2015.4 Yet in 2016, only 34% of water supply was reported to be safe and only 15% met the \nnational water quality standards. More efforts are also needed to achieve improved sanitation: \nonly 34% of urban households have septic tanks and only 15% have sewer connections. Fecal \nsludge management and sanitation for marginalized groups, especially for women and poor \nhouseholds, remain a challenge.5 Overall, municipalities find it difficult to provide adequate, cost-\neffective services because they lack funds and skilled personnel, and sufficient operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) budgets. \n \n4.  Sector  policy  and  institutional  arrangements.  The  government  targets6 for WSS \nservices focus on inclusive development for improved functionality, enhanced service levels, and \nexpanded municipal sanitation, covering all citizens, including poor and vulnerable groups.7 The \n                                                \n1  ADB.

Geneva. \n6  The sector objectives are laid out by the government\u2019s National Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Policy, \n2009; the Fourteenth Three-Year Plan, 2016; the updated 15-year Development Plan for Water Supply and \nSanitation in Small Towns, 2015; and the National Urban Development Strategy, 2017. \n \n ", "2 \ngovernment has defined sectoral institutional responsibilities and service delivery mechanisms.8 \nThe Ministry of Water Supply (MOWS) is responsible for planning, implementation, and regulation \nof WSS; its Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) supports the provision of WSS \nfacilities in municipalities where large utilities do not exist, and these are operated by water users\u2019 \nand sanitation committees (WUSCs)9 or municipalities. \n \n5.  Recently,  the  Local  Governance  Operation  Act,  2017,  entrusted  municipalities  with \nresponsibility for WSS services. While municipalities\u2019 capacity for this responsibility is being built, \nthe government and residents have been receptive to a decentralized, participatory, and cost-\nsharing  service  provision  model  through  water  users\u2019  associations  (WUAs)  and  WUSCs. \nDevelopment  support  for  municipal  WSS  has  been  channeled  through  a  combination  of \n(i) government grants through the DWSS, (ii) loans by the Town Development Fund (TDF),10 and \n(iii) contributions from municipalities and beneficiaries.11 \n \n6.  Past support for water supply and sanitation. Since 2000, ADB has successfully12 \nsupported the government in improving WSS services in 70 small towns13 through three projects \n(footnote 1), introducing continuous water supply and providing universal household connections, \nincluding subsidized connections and affordable supply for poor and vulnerable households.14 \nThe project will continue the \u201csmall towns\u201d model developed with ADB support involving (i) a \ndemand-driven, cost-sharing approach that strengthens ownership and inclusion of women and \nmarginalized groups; (ii) use of explicit, performance-based subsidies to deliver services to poor \nand vulnerable groups; (iii) use of a participatory financing mechanism with partial investment \ncost recovery; (iv) introduction of tariffs that allow to recover O&M and debt service costs; and (v) \nWUSCs as service operators.15 The model is considered successful by the government and \ndevelopment  partners. 16  ADB  also  significantly  supported  urban  WSS  in  water-stressed \nKathmandu Valley, which includes tapping additional water from Melamchi River through a 26-\nkilometer (km) diversion tunnel.17 Adopting a harmonized approach in assisting Nepal\u2019s urban \ndevelopment, ADB is also supporting resilient delivery of urban services and facilities in eight \n                                                \n8  Sector Assessment (Summary): Water and Other Urban Infrastructure and Services (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n9  The WUSCs, formed under the Nepal Water Resource Act (1992), are the elected executive bodies of WUAs. \n10 The TDF is a government-owned entity established under the Town Development Fund Act, 1997. Loans from the \ngovernment to WUAs or municipalities are generally onlent by the TDF under a subproject financing agreement. The \nTDF also supports WUAs in institutional and financial management, including introduction of tariffs. \n11 WUAs contribute 30% of civil works costs for water supply subprojects (25% from the TDF loan and 5% from users\u2019 \nupfront cash contribution), and 15% of civil works costs for sanitation subprojects (subsidy from municipalities). \n12 Independent Evaluation Department. 2018. Draft Impact of Cost-Shared Water Supply Services on Household \nWelfare in Small Towns. Manila: ADB. \n13 Small towns have (i) a population of 5,000\u201340,000; (ii) an average population density of at least 10 persons per \nhectare; (iii) jurisdiction of one administrative boundary; and (iv) high growth potential, including proximity to a \nstrategic road network with perennial road access, grid power, and telecommunication infrastructure. \n14 The first project supported 29 small towns (593,000 people) to gain access to improved water supply services and \nwas rated successful (Independent Evaluation Department. 2012. Validation Report. Nepal: Small Towns Water \nSupply and Sanitation Sector Project. Manila: ADB). The second project covered 21 small towns (355,396 people) \nsuccessfully. The third project is being implemented in 20 towns (390,000 people targeted) and is rated on track; \ncompletion is expected within the original loan closing date of 2021. \n15 ADB. 2017.

Value addition. The project will build on previous ADB interventions in the sector and will \nstrengthen particularly (i) technical robustness, (ii) institutional capacity focusing on project \nmunicipalities and WUSCs, (iii) long-term operational sustainability, and (iv) climate-resilient \napproaches19 and smart technology application.20 To overcome start-up delays, the project will \nassist project development by supporting the detailed designs of WSS subprojects for (i) urban \nareas in Kathmandu Valley not previously covered, and (ii) for newly established provincial \ncapitals and district headquarters. The project is aligned with the government\u2019s sector policies, \nADB\u2019s Urban and Water Operational Plans, ADB\u2019s Water for All Policy, and the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals 5 (gender equality), 6 (clean water and sanitation), and 13 (climate change). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The project is aligned with the following impact: quality of life for urban populations, \nincluding  the  poor  and  marginalized,  improved  through  the  provision  of  sustainable  WSS \nservices.21 The project will have the following outcome: inclusive and sustainable access to WSS \nservices in project municipalities achieved.22  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n9.  Output 1: WSS infrastructure in project municipalities improved. The project will \nsupport the following: (i) 1,600 km of water supply pipes installed or rehabilitated; (ii) 15 water \ntreatment plants, with an estimated capacity of at least 0.6 million liters per day each, constructed; \n(iii) 66,000 connections for households to piped water supply, with subsidized connections for \n8,000 poor and 2,000 vulnerable households (including 100% poor households headed by \nwomen);  (iv)  8,000  toilets  constructed  through  output-based  aid  for  poor  and  vulnerable \nhouseholds; (v) 20 public toilets that are suitable for both genders as well as the disabled \nconstructed, with septic tanks; (vi) two decentralized wastewater treatment plants constructed \nand operational; (vii) 30 km of stormwater drainage constructed; and (viii) climate and disaster \nrisks factored in design of subprojects, as necessary.23 \n \n10.  Output 2: Institutional and community capacities strengthened. The project will \naccomplish the following: (i) water, sanitation, and hygiene plans including priority investments in \n20 project municipalities prepared and approved by the municipalities; (ii) 20 WUAs registered \nand 20 WUSCs formed with at least 33% women members and at least one woman in a key post; \n(iii) business plans and tariff guidelines prepared for project WUAs and municipalities with support \nfrom the TDF and the Institutional Support and Service Advisory Unit (ISSAU) of DWSS; (iv) at \nleast 15 climate-resilient WSS subprojects for future investments prepared; (v) at least 200 staff \n(at least 66 of them women) of the DWSS, TDF, project WUAs, and project municipalities report \n                                                \n18 ADB. Nepal: Regional Urban Development Project.  \n19 Systematic climate-resilient approaches are key to (i) securing equitable water distribution; (ii) using scarce water \nsources more judiciously; and (iii) ensuring that key assets are resilient to climate risks, e.g., flooding, heat waves, \ndroughts, cyclones, and natural hazards such as landslides and earthquakes. \n20 For efficient operation, the project will introduce appropriate technology such as (i) supervisory control and data \nacquisition systems; (ii) smart metering; and (iii) smart billing, tariff collection, and management systems. \n21 Government of Nepal. 2009.

The government has requested a concessional loan of $130.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \n14.  The government and beneficiaries will provide $48.5 million to cover project investment \ncosts to finance (i) taxes and duties, (ii) part of works, (iii) part of incremental recurrent costs, and \n(iv) part of contingencies. The government will provide the ADB loan proceeds and counterpart \nfunds to the DWSS as the implementing agency of the project and has assured that it will cover \nany shortfall in the finance required to meet the agreed outputs.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n18.  Due diligence of candidate subprojects (footnote 24) confirmed their technical viability, \nwith due consideration of local conditions and capacity for implementation and O&M. It also \nincorporated adequate measures based on lessons from previous projects, such as (i) obtaining \nbetter quality assurance and control measures for subproject designs by engaging dedicated \nproject management and quality assurance consultants for the entire project period, (ii) ensuring \nthat subproject designs incur combined capital and O&M expenditures at least-cost, and (iii) \nupdating existing DWSS design guidelines to factor in climate and disaster risks. Institutional and \nfinancial improvements include (i) consulting service inputs for TDF and ISSAU to provide \ntechnical, utility management, and corporatization support to WUAs27 and project municipalities; \n(ii)  adoption  of  tariff  guidelines  and  management  agreements  between  WUAs  or  project \nmunicipalities and the DWSS with clear definition of roles and responsibilities; (iii) a subsidy \nmechanism to ensure coverage of the poor;28 and (iv) adequate capacity and resources for future \nsubproject preparation. To improve sustainability, the project will support 1 year of O&M in all \nworks contracts including on the job training for WUSC technical staff. Subprojects are driven by \ndemand from WUAs and project municipalities, and selected along transparent criteria, including \npopulation growth, poverty index, existing WSS infrastructure, community willingness for cost \nsharing, and long-term O&M contract.29  \n \n19.  Climate change resilience and adaptation measures. The project is categorized as \nmedium for climate change impact and a climate risk and vulnerability analysis was conducted. \nThe DWSS design guidelines incorporate a separate section on climate change containing \nassessment and adaptation procedures for reducing the impact of climate change on physical \ninvestments  and  building  project  municipalities\u2019  resilience.  Subproject  designs  incorporate \nspecific measures such as (i) groundwater source from deeper aquifers where yields are not \naffected by changes in precipitation, (ii) pipes to be laid below ground to avoid damage during \nfloods, (iii) source protection, (iv) no construction in floodplains and landslide-prone areas, \n(v) additional free-board allowance to design parameters, (vi) power backup generators to ensure \noperation, and (vii) adoption of water conservation and awareness-raising measures.30 \n                                                \n27 The ISSAU will assist WUAs in their corporatization, either as a water board under the Water Supply Management \nBoard Act, 2006, or as a company under the Companies Act, 2006. \n28 The project will cover all poor and vulnerable households (including 100% poor households headed by women) by \nproviding a 100% upfront cash contribution subsidy for water supply and a 90% subsidy for toilets through output-\nbased aid, e.g., reimbursing the contractors upon completion of the toilet facilities. \n29 Detailed subproject selection criteria and the list of pre-selected project municipalities are in the PAM (footnote 25). \nSelection of future investments to be designed under the project will follow the same criteria, with preference for \ninvestments located in Kathmandu Valley, provincial headquarters, and strategic border municipalities. Subproject \nprocurement can only start once the DWSS and a municipality sign a management agreement with the local WUSC \nfor 20 years of O&M service. The municipality will own the system and the WUSC will operate it. \n30 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n20.  Economic analysis. The economic rationale for the government\u2019s intervention is sound \nsince the project aims to provide more sustainable urban WSS services. The economic internal \nrates of return of three sample WSS subprojects range from 12.3% to 16.4%, higher than the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital of 9.0%, indicating significant economic returns. Most of the \nsample subprojects have also yielded satisfactory results when subjected to a sensitivity analysis \nusing the following downside risks: (i) a capital cost overrun of 20%, (ii) an overrun in operation \nand management costs of 20%, (iii) a decline in estimated benefits of 20%, (iv) a 1-year \nimplementation delay, and (v) all of the above downside risks combined. The project will increase \nits economic viability even further if unquantifiable benefits such as environmental improvements \nare included in the analysis.31 \n \n21.  Financial  analysis.  The  financial  analysis  was  conducted  on  three  sample  WSS \nsubprojects by estimating cash flows over the project life to ensure that the subprojects will \ngenerate sufficient revenues to cover incremental recurrent costs, including full O&M and debt \nservice costs.32 A government grant is funding 70% of civil works costs for the water supply \nsubprojects, and 85% of civil costs for sanitation subprojects and all other costs, such as \nequipment and consulting services. Revenue streams are not intended for full cost recovery, but \nto recover incremental recurrent costs. An incremental recurrent cost recovery analysis revealed \nthat all sample subprojects would generate sufficient revenues from water tariffs to fully recover \nincremental recurrent costs through periodic tariff revisions. The PMO and TDF will provide \ncapacity building and hand-holding support to WUSCs on tariff fixation, revenue mobilization, \nawareness campaigns, and consultations on the project to improve the financial efficiency and \nsustainability of WSS services.33 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n22.  A financial management assessment showed that the DWSS and TDF could conduct \nfinancial management of the project adequately. The two entities have sufficient experience \nhandling ADB-funded projects. They are also implementing the ongoing ADB-funded Third Small \nTowns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project satisfactorily in terms of timely receipt of \nproject funds, including counterpart funds; efficient project management with adequate staff; and \nprompt disbursement of funds to contractors and consultants. The procurement assessment \nconcluded that the overall procurement risk for the project is  moderate.34 The overall risk \nassessment for the project is moderate. Risk mitigation measures include (i) securing commitment \nof the government and the DWSS to ensure timely establishment of WUSCs with qualified staff, \n(ii) extending  full  training  and  skills  development  support  to  boost  the  PMO\u2019s  financial \nmanagement capacity, and (iii) appointing or recruiting qualified staff to fill the vacant positions in \nthe finance section of the TDF. Close monitoring and the resolution of these capacity gaps will be \nimplemented with the support of the loan consultants.35 \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  MOWS,  DWSS,  and  TDF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n                                                \n31 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Debt service costs include 25% share of civil works costs for water supply components to be covered by a TDF loan. \n33 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 Project Procurement Risk Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "8 \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n24.  The project, classified as gender equity theme, has approaches and implementation \ninterventions directly focusing on gender and social inclusion by providing sustainable water \nsupply and improved sanitation services in project municipalities.36 Inclusion and coverage of all \npoor and vulnerable37 households in a subproject coverage area is ensured through subsidized \nconnections  to  piped  water  supply  and  output-based  aid  for  sanitation  infrastructure.  The \nimprovement  in  WSS  infrastructure\u2014individual  water  connections  and  toilets\u2014will  benefit \nwomen, in particular, by decreasing the average time per day spent on collecting and managing \nwater. The framework for inclusion in the PAM outlines the provision of WSS services for poor \nand vulnerable households, including full subsidy for water supply connections and up to 90% \nsubsidy for individual toilets through output-based aid to ensure affordability and access to better \nservice. A lifeline tariff subsidy for water supply supports continuous affordability of water user \ncharges  by  poor  and  vulnerable  households.  The  project  benefits  the  poor,  women,  and \nvulnerable people by ensuring their participation in project-related consultations, training units, \nwork generation, and awareness campaigns. Women\u2019s empowerment is targeted through their \nparticipation in decision-making. The WUSCs are required to have women (at least 33%) and \nrepresentatives of marginalized ethnic groups among their members, and for a woman to occupy \nat least one of the key posts (chair, vice chair, or treasurer). A gender equality and social inclusion \naction plan38 ensures that activities to mainstream gender equality and social inclusion are \nimplemented and monitored at regular intervals. Data, disaggregated by sex, ethnicity, and social \nand economic background, will be collected. Resources are allocated for the implementation and \nmonitoring of the action plan. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n25.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.39 \n \n26.  Environment (category B). The PMO prepared an environmental assessment review \nframework  (EARF)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  applicable \ngovernment environmental regulation to provide guidance on subproject selection, screening and \ncategorization,  information  disclosure  and  consultation,  assessment,  planning,  institutional \narrangement,  and  processes  to  be  followed  during  project  implementation.  Five  sample \nsubprojects were appraised, and initial environmental examination (IEE) reports were prepared \nin line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and the EARF.40 The IEEs also include an \nenvironmental compliance audit of existing facilities that will be rehabilitated or expanded under \nthe project.41 The sample IEEs and information on project municipalities indicate that there are no \necologically sensitive areas, planned infrastructure will only require small footprints, and the \n                                                \n36 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Vulnerable people are defined as those suffering the effects of marginalization within or outside their community \nbecause of their ethnicity, gender, caste, religion, disability, health, education, or socioeconomic status. For the \npurpose of this project, this specifically includes Dalit, disabled, disaster-affected, marginalized, and endangered \nindigenous groups that are politically, socially, or economically excluded. \n38 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n40 Environmental Assessment Review Framework and Initial environmental examinations (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n41 Environmental audit of water treatment plants to be rehabilitated show compliance with government regulations and \nrequirements. Currently, treated water quality meets both Nepal and World Health Organization guideline values. \nRaw water quality is good, and water treatment plants do not generate considerable amounts of sludge. \n \n ", "9 \npotential impacts are site-specific\u2014few if any of them are irreversible42 and can in most cases be \nreadily mitigated and minimized by applying proven mitigation measures and environmentally \nsound  engineering  and  construction  practices  consistent  with  international  good  practices. \nStakeholders were involved through meaningful consultations and views expressed were fed into \nIEEs and subprojects. The consultation process will be continued during project implementation \nto ensure that stakeholders are fully engaged. The environmental management plans (EMPs) will \nform part of the bid and contract documents. The IEEs were prepared with site-specific EMPs and \nmonitoring program, and submitted to ADB, and no works will start until final IEEs are reviewed \nand approved by ADB. The EARF and IEEs were disclosed on ADB and project websites, and to \naffected people. A grievance redress mechanism is included in the PAM. Adequate consulting \nsupport is included in the project to ensure satisfactory environmental compliance. The PMO will \nreport to ADB on EMP implementation twice a year. \n \n27.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). To guide subproject preparation, the PMO \nprepared a resettlement framework in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and the \nGovernment of Nepal\u2019s policies, and a sample resettlement plan and four sample due diligence \nreports. 43 Private land acquisition for sample subprojects is not needed. The resettlement plan, \nprepared for a sample WSS subproject, assesses the impact on common property resources and \nprovides suitable mitigation measures. The DWSS has some experience in implementing and \nmonitoring category B subprojects for involuntary resettlement safeguards under ADB-funded \nprojects. The grievance redress mechanism will address issues and grievances in a timely and \neffective manner. The PMO will submit semiannual social safeguard monitoring reports to ADB \nand  will  be  supported  by  loan  consultants  in  monitoring  compliance  with  safeguards.  No \nsubprojects rated category A for involuntary resettlement will be included. \n \n28.  Indigenous peoples (category B). To guide subproject preparation, the PMO prepared \nan indigenous peoples planning framework in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nthe Government of Nepal\u2019s policies. Field visits confirmed the presence of indigenous peoples\u2019 \ngroups in one of the sample municipalities, who will be included in project benefits. Indigenous \npeoples\u2019 groups who are traditional users of surface water sources proposed for a municipal water \nsupply system are also identified, and a sample indigenous peoples plan was prepared.44 \nPrevious ADB projects implemented by the DWSS were category C for indigenous peoples\u2019 \nsafeguards. Capacity building of PMO staff as well as training of municipal officials and WUAs on \nindigenous peoples\u2019 safeguards, and refresher training sessions on involuntary resettlement will \nbe required. Regional PMOs, municipalities, and WUAs will need capacity support from the social \nsafeguards consultant to assist in the implementation of resettlement and indigenous peoples \nplans. No subprojects rated category A for indigenous peoples will be included. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n29.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.45 \n                                                \n42 Potential impacts during construction arise from excavations and include (i) health and safety hazards to workers, \n(ii) noise and dust, (iii) increased road traffic, and (iv) soil erosion and silt runoff from stockpiled materials and wastes. \nDuring operation, facilities may generate noise and odor from sanitation, sewage treatment, and discharges to the \nenvironment. The IEEs set performance standards on key environmental parameters like noise, odor, and discharge \nin line with international good practice (as set out in World Bank\u2013International Finance Corporation Environmental, \nHealth and Safety guidelines) and the Government of Nepal\u2019s requirements. \n43 Resettlement Framework, Resettlement Plan, and Due Diligence Reports (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n44 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework and Indigenous Peoples Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \n45 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nChanges in government  Implementation and fund-flow structures that were successfully established in \nstructures may jeopardize the  earlier projects funded by the Asian Development Bank will remain in place. \ninstitutional arrangements and  Roles of stakeholders are clearly defined, and formation of water users\u2019\nproject implementation.  associations and WUSCs will ensure consensus among key stakeholders. \nClimate change and extreme  Design standards will include assessment of climate and disaster risks.
