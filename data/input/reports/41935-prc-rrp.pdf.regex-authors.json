I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment in and a proposed loan to Sanchuan Clean Energy Development Company \n(Sanchuan) for the Small Hydropower Development Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC). The report also describes a proposed technical assistance (TA) for Improving Corporate \nGovernance and Enhancing Institutional Capacity of Environmental and Social Management, \nand if the Board approves the proposed equity investment and loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. Sanchuan will use the proceeds of the \nequity investment and loan to finance its portfolio of small hydropower plants (HPPs) in the PRC. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  The Power Sector \n1.  Background \n2.  The PRC has achieved and sustained rapid economic growth, averaging about 9.7% a \nyear from 1980 to 2007. The economy continues to benefit from the comparative advantage of \nlower labor costs, higher productivity levels, and easier global movement of goods and services. \nCompared with 2000, the economy is expected to double in size by 2010 and quadruple by \n2020. With a population of 1.3 billion, the PRC\u2019s per capita electricity consumption is low, \nestimated  at  2,150  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  in  2006.  By  comparison,  the  ratios  in  developed \ncountries are typically 4\u20137 times higher, and the world average is nearly double at 4,200 kWh. \nThe rapid pace of economic growth and low per capita electricity consumption have created a \nstrong demand for electricity. \n \n2.  Power Demand and Supply \n3.  The fast pace of economic growth and the expansion of energy-intensive industries, \nsuch as steel, aluminum, and cement, have driven electricity demand. Electricity demand grew \n14% in 2007 dominated by the industry, which accounted for more than 75% of total power \nconsumption. Residential consumption accounted for about 11% of the total, while commercial \nconsumption accounted for 8%; agriculture accounted for the smallest portion of demand at 4%. \nPower consumption has grown by an average of 13% annually over the past 6 years. Demand \nis expected to continue to grow 11%\u201314% annually for the next 3\u20135 years.  \n \n4.  The PRC\u2019s installed power generation capacity grew from 1.85 gigawatts (GW) in 1949 \nto 713.3 GW in 2007, an average annual growth rate of 10.8%. Since 2002, installed capacity \nhas increased at an annual rate of at least 13%, including 14.4% in 2007. The PRC has \ninstalled more than 275 GW in the past 3 years. The Government plans to build an additional \n500 GW over the next 15 years, pushing installed capacity to an estimated 1,150\u20131300 GW by \n2020.  \n \n5.  Despite this accelerated capacity addition, the PRC has faced power shortages since \n2002.  However,  the  shortages  are  being  eased\u2014six  provinces  experienced  severe  power \nshortages in 2006 compared with 25 provinces in 2005. At the end of 2007, a balance between \nsupply  and  demand  in  the  country  was  generally  achieved.  However,  various  sources \nsuggested  that,  without  investment  beyond  what  the  Government  is  planning,  another \nnationwide power shortage may occur between 2010 and 2020 because of (i) rapid economic \n ", "2 \ngrowth, (ii) the geographic separation of its coal and water resources and load demand centers, \nand (iii) the mismatch between economic growth and power construction cycles. Therefore, it is \nimportant to increase private sector participation and mobilize private sector investment in the \nsector.   \n \n3.  Energy Mix and Environmental Impact \n6.  At the end of 2007, thermal power still accounted for 78% of the energy generated, \nfollowed by hydropower at 20%, nuclear at 1.2%, and wind power at less than 0.6%. In spite of \nefforts to diversify the mix of fuels, the PRC is unlikely to reduce its dependence on coal in the \nnear  future.  The  dominance  of  coal  has  produced  a  number  of  problems,  especially \nenvironmental ones such as poor air quality. The PRC is now the world\u2019s largest coal producer \nand consumer. Production of raw coal more than doubled from 1 billion tons (t) in 2000 to 2.18 \nbillion t in 2005, when the PRC accounted for more than 37% of global production. The electric \npower sector is the largest consumer of coal; it consumed about 54% of the coal produced in \n2005,  which  has  resulted  in  50%  of  the  country\u2019s  sulfur  dioxide  (SO )  emissions,  80%  of \n2\nnitrogen  oxide  (NO )  emissions,  and  26%  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions.  Acid  rain  caused \nX\nprimarily by SO  and NO  falls on one-third of the country. In 2005, of the PRC\u2019s 342 major \n2 x\ncities, only 128 met the acceptable air quality standards (national class II air quality standards). \nA combination of coal combustion and desertification causes poor air quality. \n \n4.  Sector Development and Policy Framework \n7.  Since April 2002, with the implementation of a power sector reform plan, the PRC\u2019s \npower sector has changed substantially. The role of the market in developing, operating, and \neffectively regulating the power sector has been promoted. The reforms have included the \nintroduction of competition for efficiency improvements, reduction of costs, implementation of a \nmarket-based pricing mechanism, optimal resource allocation, nationwide grid connection, and \nseparation of government and commercial functions.  \n \n8.  During the 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP), significant progress was made: (i) the State \nPower Corporation, the sole government entity responsible for generation, transmission, and \ndistribution  of  electricity,  was  broken  up;  (ii)  generation  operations  were  separated  from \ntransmission; (iii) the generation assets of State Power were divided into five independent \ngeneration companies; and (iv) two grid companies, State Power Grid Company and South \nPRC Power Grid Company, were formed. The State Electricity Regulatory Commission was \nestablished in October 2002 to introduce competitive markets for power generation. Regional \nwholesale power markets are being piloted in the northeast, central, eastern, and southern \nregions.  \n \n9.  Sector reforms are expected to continue and intensify in the 11th FYP. However, in line \nwith the plan\u2019s priority on rural development, sector policies have been aligned to (i) minimize \nany imbalance between urban and rural electricity services, (ii) achieve uniform urban\u2013rural \ntariffs, and (iii) improve the provision of electricity to unserved rural areas. The 11th FYP also \nhighlights the strategic significance of diversifying energy supply by providing more renewable \nenergy,  including  small  hydropower,  wind,  solar,  geothermal  power,  and  bioenergy.  The \nobjectives for renewable energy development during the 11th FYP include (i) speeding up the \nexploitation and utilization of renewable energy, (ii) increasing the proportion of renewable \nenergy in the total energy consumption, (iii) solving the fuel shortage for rural populations that  \ndo  not  have  access  to  electricity,  (iv)  promoting  the  development  of  renewable  energy \ntechnology and industry, and (v) advancing the research and industrialization level of renewable \n ", "3 \ntechnology.  The  PRC\u2019s  goal  is  to  increase  renewable  energy\u2019s  share  of  total  energy \nconsumption to 10% by 2010 and 15% by 2020. \n \n10.  The  Government  has  offered  preferential  policies  that  strongly  support  small-scale \nhydropower,  and  has  included  small  HPPs  in  its  rural  electrification  plans.  These  policies \ninclude preferential taxes, soft loans and grants, the promotion of private sector investment in \nsmall HPPs, and the protection of supply areas and private property. The Government also \nrecently implemented additional policies to encourage the development of renewable energies, \nsuch as requiring grids to purchase all the electricity output of small HPPs. \n \n5.  Tariff \n11.  The retail and power plant output tariffs in the PRC are regulated. They are fixed by the \nprice  bureau  according  to  the  guidance  issued  by  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission (NDRC). In the case of power plants, they are announced at the beginning of the \nyear for units starting their commercial operations during that year. The generators connected to \nthe grid sell their energy and are paid according to many factors, such as age of the plant, \nreasonable rates of return, and total costs of the plant. Usually once every 1\u20132 years, NDRC \nadjusts  the  tariffs\u2014so  far  only  upwards\u2014based  on  various  factors,  including  supply  and \ndemand, and fuel costs.  \n \n12.  In the ongoing sector reform, retail tariffs are being unbundled into generation, and \ntransmission and distribution tariffs. The principles of full cost recovery and adequate return on \ninvestment have been embedded in the sector tariff formulation for more than a decade and \nhave  been  applied  consistently.  The  power  tariff  reforms  are  encouraging  greater  use  of \nrenewable energies, including wind, solar, small hydropower, and bioenergy. Although no new \ntake-or-pay contract in the power sector has been signed for almost a decade, under the \nrenewable energy law passed in 2005, all energy generated from renewable sources must be \npurchased by the grid companies. \n \n6.  Constraints on Private Sector Participation \n13.  The majority of the PRC\u2019s water resources are in the mountainous areas in the west and \nsouthwest  regions,  which  have  the  most  underdeveloped  economies  in  the  country.  The \nmunicipal and provincial governments have responsibility and are keen to develop hydropower \nprojects.  However,  public  funding  for  hydropower  projects  is  limited,  mainly  because  the \nmunicipal  and  provincial  governments  (i)  have  small  financial  budgets  and  large  overall \ninfrastructure needs, (ii) have little access to multilateral or other external financing sources, and \n(iii) may not be able to meet the government\u2019s counterpart funding requirements. Moreover, the \ninvestment, construction, and operation of HPPs require special knowledge and sector-specific \nexperience that most local governments lack. \n \n14.  Private  sector  participation,  accompanied  by  funding  and  experience,  is  needed  to \ndevelop the hydropower sector in the PRC, especially in the western region. However, private \ninvestors have targeted large hydropower projects developed by major publicly listed companies. \nAlthough the Government has encouraged private sector participation in small hydropower \ndevelopment,  private  funding  sources  have  not  shown  much  interest  because  of  (i)  the \nsophisticated technical requirements, (ii) high transaction costs, and (iii) unfavorable financing \nmarket.  \n \n ", "4 \n15.  Setting up the complicated funding structures for small hydropower projects carries \nrelatively high transaction costs. Traditional funding structures usually require a high proportion \nof  equity  investment  and/or  recourse  to  a  strong  parent  company.  Local  investors  and/or \noperators  are  typically  relatively  new  and  have  limited  financial  resources,  restricting  their \ncapacity to develop a large number of projects. Moreover, long-term private sector financing, \nwhich is desperately needed in the small hydropower sector, is nearly nonexistent, limiting local \nprivate sector participation and restricting mobilization of resources for the sector. Consequently, \ndedicated and qualified local sponsors of small hydropower development need to be prioritized, \nespecially those who are willing to develop in the western region. This can be achieved through \nequity  investment  and  long-term  debt\u2014ADB  has  extensive  experience  in  this  and  similar \nsectors\u2014which will in turn mobilize other financing. \n \nB.  ADB Operations, Strategy, and Sector Policy \n16.  ADB\u2019s country strategy for the PRC has four strategic pillars: (i) inclusive growth and \nbalanced development, (ii) resource efficiency and environmental sustainability, (iii) regional \ncooperation and public goods, and (iv) enabling environment for private sector development.1 \nThis is consistent with the three strategic development agendas highlighted in ADB\u2019s long-term \nstrategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020):  (i)  inclusive  economic  growth,  (ii) \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and (iii) regional integration. 2 In the PRC, ADB aims to \nachieve a better development balance between rural and urban areas, and between coastal and \ninland  regions. The  emphasis  on  infrastructure  projects  in  rural  areas  and  less-developed \ncentral and western regions has increased.  \n \n17.  The  PRC  has  been  steadily  transforming  itself  into  a  market  economy,  which  has \nbecome the driving force for economic growth and job creation. In addition to providing policy \nadvice to the Government on private sector development, ADB offers project-based financial \nassistance. ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC have focused on infrastructure and \nenergy, finance, and environmental improvements. In infrastructure and energy, ADB prioritizes \npioneering projects with innovative contractual and financial structuring to encourage private \nsector participation, enhance management expertise, and improve corporate governance. As \nagreed upon with the Government, ADB private sector operations will identify and support viable \nprojects  located  in  the  less-developed  central  and  western  regions,  and  will  explore  the \npossibility of using proceeds of yuan-denominated bonds for lending to local borrowers.  \n \n18.  In its 1995 Energy Policy, ADB emphasized the need to accelerate the application of \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency in its developing member countries (DMCs).3 This \nemphasis was strengthened in the Energy Policy Review of 2000;4 a further review in 2006 \nresulted in a 2007 draft document, which is being finalized, that outlines ADB\u2019s new energy \nstrategy.  This  draft  strategy\u2014which  is  aligned  with  Strategy  2020\u2014aims  to  meet  energy \ndemand in a sustainable way, provide energy access for all, and support energy sector reform \nand governance.  \n \n19.  For a number of years, ADB has promoted clean energy initiatives to minimize adverse \nlocal and regional impacts of climate change, and has emphasized the acceleration of the \nwidespread application of renewable energy and energy efficiency in its DMCs.

As part of the \nCMI, the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund 5 will provide up-front funding against the purchase of an \nestimated 25%\u201350% of future carbon credits expected from projects. In addition, the initiative \nwill provide grants for the preparation and implementation of eligible projects. The CMI was \ncreated as a mechanism to boost the viability of alternative clean energy sources in developing \ncountries, while also assisting developed countries in meeting their Kyoto Protocol commitments \nfor cutting greenhouse gas emissions. It is an effective tool for addressing energy security and \nclimate change\u2014two of the most pressing global issues today. \n \nIII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Description \n20.  The Project, which provides for an equity investment, loan, and technical assistance by \nADB, will support the expansion and capital expenditure plan of Zhejiang Zhongda Sanchuan \nHydropower Development Co., Ltd. (ZDSC) to build, rehabilitate, expand, upgrade, privatize, \nand/or operate small HPPs. Most of these are in the relatively underdeveloped central and \nwestern regions of the PRC. The Project aims to enhance the development of small, emission-\nfree  HPPs,  which  have  limited  environmental  impacts  and  generate  the  most  affordable \nrenewable  energy,  through  private  sector  participation.  These  plants  would  combat \nenvironmental degradation and the threat of climate change by reducing the country\u2019s reliance \non coal for energy generation. The Project also will support regional economic growth and \nequitable  economic  development  of  the  country  by  transferring  proven  technology  and \nsuccessful experience of the private sector from the relatively developed coastal region to the \nrelatively  underdeveloped  central  and  western  regions  for  the  development  of  hydropower \nresources in a sustainable manner.  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Holding Company \n21.  ZDSC, together with ADB, IFC, and other investors, will establish Sanchuan, a new \nholding company in Yunnan Province, to focus on the development of small HPPs in central and \nwestern PRC. In the next 3\u20134 years, before its planned initial public offering (IPO), Sanchuan is \nprojecting to add about 300 MW of capacity through (i) privatization of small HPPs owned by \nlocal governments, (ii) acquisition of partly completed small HPPs that are facing financial \nand/or technical constraints, and (iii) development of small greenfield HPPs.  \n \n2.  Small Hydropower Plants \n22.  The  relevant  local  government  grants  each  small  HPP  a  specific  hydropower \ndevelopment  right  for  an  unlimited  period.  The  feasibility  study,  environmental  impact \nassessment, and project design are prepared by the project sponsor and approved by the local \ngovernment. Each HPP is implemented in accordance with the granted approvals, subject to \ngovernment  inspections  during  construction  and  operation  on  various  aspects,  including \nenvironment, safety, quality, and sanitation.  \n                                                 \n5  Contributors: the governments of Belgium, Finland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden; and the Climate \nChange Foundation. \n ", "6 \n \nC.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n1.  Environmental Safeguards \n23.  The Project is categorized as FI in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines (2003) and will adopt an environmental management system (EMS) following ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002). The corporate EMS will be developed under TA from ADB following \nthe indicative EMS guidelines presented in Supplementary Appendix A. Identified subprojects \nwill be classified as A or B based on a screening process that will determine the significance of \npotential  environmental  damage.  An  environmental  assessment  process,  including  an \nenvironmental  management  plan,  will  be  followed  and  implemented  for  the  subprojects \ncomplying with both national and ADB safeguards requirements; operational or partly completed \nsubprojects will be audited.  \n \n2.  Social Safeguards \n24.  Due diligence was conducted on the social safeguards of ZDSC\u2019s current operations. As \nsome of the HPPs visited entailed significant involuntary resettlement impacts, the Project is  \ncategorized as A in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). None of the \nHPPs visited affected any ethnic minorities. However, since Sanchuan is likely to expand its \noperations in Yunnan Province where there are many ethnic minority groups, the Project is \ncategorized  as  A/B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  The \nenvironmental and social safeguards assessment due diligence report is Appendix 5. \n \n25.  In  the  event  that  Sanchuan\u2019s  small  HPPs  affect  ethnic  minorities  and  involve \nresettlement, Sanchuan will ensure that the appropriate resettlement plan and/or ethnic minority \ndevelopment plan are prepared and implemented following the agreed upon social safeguards \nframework (Supplementary Appendix B) and in accordance with ADB\u2019s social safeguard policy \nrequirements. \n \nD.  Development Impact \n26.  The Project will be an important catalyst for economic growth in the PRC, particularly in \nthe less-developed rural areas and central and western regions. All the existing and future \nHPPs under the Project are in the poor, remote rural areas. As such, project activities during \nconstruction and operation will provide jobs and other significant direct benefit to the local \ncommunities. Further, the acquisition and completion of the partly completed small HPPs facing \nfinancial and/or technical constraints will utilize the idle assets, eliminating a major bottleneck in \nthe economic development of central and western PRC.  \n \n27.  HPPs will increase electricity supply through clean energy production, which will benefit \nmost the people living in the neighboring rural areas. Relying on large coal-fired power plants to \nprovide electricity to rural areas through an extensive transmission network is too costly and \ninefficient because of the substantial losses during transmission. This is why retail electricity \ntariffs  in  the  rural  areas  are  expensive  compared  to  other  areas,  which  constrains  the \ndevelopment of the local economy. By locating power plants close to the end users, prices can \nbe substantially reduced and efficiency increased\u2014the main reasons why the Government \nstrongly  promotes  small  HPPs  in  the  rural  electrification program.  About  50% of  the  rural \npopulation relies on small HPPs for reliable, affordable electricity. The Project will contribute to \nan increase in this percentage. The Project will also provide significant additional tax revenue to \n ", "7 \nthe local governments, which may be used for economic development programs. Hydropower \ndevelopment is likely to increase the flood control capacity of the related river basins, which will \nstrongly benefit the agricultural development. \n \n28.  The Project will have significant environmental benefits in terms of air pollution avoided \nfrom coal-fired plants that would otherwise be used to generate power. The average annual \navoided emissions were estimated at 670 t of total suspended particulate, 5,400 t of SO , 4,000 \n2\nt of NO , and more than 1 million t of carbon dioxide. On completion of the capital expenditures \nx\nin 2011, the Project will have avoided about 2.8 million t of coal use per year of operation.  \n \n29.  The Project will promote private sector participation in small hydropower development in \nthe PRC, aiming to increase the amount of available private capital in the sector, which is a \npriority for improving the country\u2019s energy mix. ZDSC, a local private sector developer based in \na relatively advanced coastal region, will transfer its assets, financial resources, successful \nexperience, and good practice to the less-developed Yunnan Province in central and western \nPRC in a sustainable manner. The private sector development of the small HPPs will free up \nlocal government resources and provide additional tax revenues, which may be used for other \nvital social and health expenditures. \n \n30.  The Project will have a positive impact on the development of local capital markets \nthrough its use of funds raised locally. If the Project is implemented, and subject to Government \napproval, ADB may issue another yuan-denominated bond (panda bond) to fund the Project. \nThis would help the Government to improve the bond market in the PRC. The proposed loan in \ntranche B will catalyze the participation by international commercial banks, which rely heavily on \nthe anchor position of ADB and IFC in the Project. Further, ADB and IFC will catalyze the first \nconcessionary  loan  to  be  approved  by  the  newly  established  China  CDM  Fund,  which  is \nadministered by the Ministry of Finance. The Project establishes an excellent platform for the \npartnership of ADB, IFC, Government, local governments, local and international commercial \nbanks, and international private equity investors.  \n \nE.  Development Effectiveness \n31.  The development effectiveness of the Project will be assessed in terms of private sector \ndevelopment, business success, and economic sustainability, according to the implementation \nguidelines contained in Good-Practice Standards for Evaluation of Private Sector Investment \nOperations.6 Sanchuan will be in a position to comfortably fund the construction, privatization, \nexpansion, and rehabilitation of small HPPs in the PRC, mainly in the central and western rural \nareas. This will increase the supply of electricity and avoid the pollution that would otherwise \nhave been generated by coal-fired plants. The increase in electricity supply from its HPPs will \nlead  to  higher  revenue  and  reinforce  Sanchuan\u2019s  financial  sustainability  and  continuous \noperations. On a broader level, the development effectiveness will be reflected in the higher \ncapacity and better environment in the PRC. The impact of this can be observed by assessing \nthe general supply in the power sector and the air quality in the PRC.  \n \n                                                 \n6  Multilateral Development Banks Evaluation Cooperation Group. 2001.

The  proposed  equity  investment  will  involve  the  subscription  to  ordinary  shares  in \nSanchuan7 at a cost of up to $25 million, funded from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR). \nThe terms and conditions, including valuation, representations, warranties, and covenants, of \nADB\u2019s equity investment will be similar to or better than other equity investment in Sanchuan at \nabout the same time.  \n \n33.  The  proposed  ADB  equity  investment  is  an  integral  part  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance  for \nSanchuan and the Project. ZDSC has been seeking strategic investors to enable the company \nto continue to grow in the rapidly expanding sector. ADB is expected to assist Sanchuan in \nenhancing its corporate governance and improving its environmental and social management \nsystem. ADB\u2019s equity investment will help Sanchuan secure the confidence of international \ninvestors and attract more funds to continue expanding in the small hydropower sector in the \nPRC. \n \n34.  The proposed equity investment will be documented appropriately and all contractual \nand financial arrangements should be satisfactory to ADB. The disbursement will be subject to \ncomprehensive  conditions  precedent,  including  all  necessary  governmental,  creditor,  and \nshareholder approvals and consents. \n \nB.  Loan \n35.  The proposed ADB loan will have two tranches: tranche A, funded by ADB; and tranche \nB, funded by commercial banks. \n \n36.  Tranche A is for up to CNY400 million. Tranche A will be provided from ADB\u2019s OCR \nwithout government guarantee, and will be funded from the proceeds of yuan-denominated \nbonds issued by ADB.8 Tranche A will have an interest rate to be determined in accordance with \nprocedures applicable to ADB local currency loans, as well as a commitment fee and a front-\nend fee to be approved by ADB\u2019s Pricing and Credit Enhancement Committee.  \n \n37.  Tranche B, for up to $120 million, will be funded by international commercial banks \nunder  terms  and  conditions  to  be  mutually  agreed  upon  between  Sanchuan  and  the \nparticipating commercial banks, with the concurrence of ADB. ADB will charge an arrangement \nfee and annual administration fee, to be approved by ADB\u2019s Pricing and Credit Enhancement \nCommittee in accordance with ADB's credit enhancement operations policies. \n \n38.  The proposed loan will be documented in a loan agreement, which will contain standard \nterms  and  conditions  that  apply  to  loans  to  private  sector  borrowers  without  government \nguarantee. The terms of the loan will include financial and operational covenants and reporting \nrequirements. \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB may structure the proposed equity investment through an offshore special purpose company to be set up \ntogether with other investors. This is in line with international practice.  \n8  The disbursement in yuan will be subject to ADB\u2019s funding availability. If ADB is unable to procure sufficient yuan to \nfund tranche A, Sanchuan can request ADB to disburse the entire or a portion of tranche A in US dollars. \n ", "9 \nC.  Technical Assistance \n1.  Issues \n39.  Like most rapidly expanding private companies in the PRC, ZDSC has satisfactory \ntechnical and management skills. However, its major weaknesses include (i) poor corporate \ngovernance, and (ii) a lack of institutional capacity for environmental and social management.  \n \n2.  Impact, Outcome, Methodology, and Key Activities \n40.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  substantial  improvement  of  Sanchuan\u2019s  corporate \ngovernance and institutional capacity of environmental and social management. It is agreed and \nwill be documented that after the TA is implemented, Sanchuan will offer free support, including \nseminars and workshops, to other renewable energy companies in the PRC on corporate \ngovernance and environmental and social management. Therefore, the impact of the TA is the \nenhancement  of  the  standards  for  corporate  governance  and  environmental  and  social \nmanagement of the entire sector. \n \n41.  The outputs of the TA will be (i) a set of corporate policies, procedures, and guidelines \non both corporate governance and environmental and social safeguard system; and (ii) a well-\ndesigned  and  established  corporate  structure  to  implement  the  policies.  Through  needs \nassessment,  training,  capacity  building,  and  an  awareness  campaign,  the  TA  will  offer  a \ncomprehensive capacity building package. After TA implementation, the outputs should be \nreplicable, with easy modification, by other similar companies for the benefit the entire sector. \n \n3.  Cost and Financing \n42.  The TA will cost the equivalent of $800,000, of which ADB will finance $700,000 on a \ngrant basis through the TA funding program. Sanchuan will finance the remainder, equivalent to \n$100,000,  through  in-kind  contributions,  including  office  accommodation  and  facilities, \ncounterpart staff, and data collection for the TA. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 7.  \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangement  \n43.  ADB,  as  the  Implementing  Agency  for  the  TA,  will  be  responsible  for  all  technical \nimplementation issues. ADB and Sanchuan will form a TA task force comprising representatives \nat appropriate levels from ADB, Sanchuan, and the consultants to be hired. The task force will \nmeet regularly to assess the needs, followed by capacity building modules. The TA will be \nimplemented over 15 months from the date its services start. \n \n44.  The TA will be carried out by international and domestic consultants to be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  To  assist  the  international  consultants,  the  national  consultants  will  quickly  become \nfamiliar with their tasks by reviewing relevant reports, analytical data, policies, and regulations, \nas well as translating documents into English. The outline terms of reference for consultants are \nin  Appendix  7.  To  facilitate  the  selection  process  and  consequently  streamline  the \nadministration  process,  a  part  of  the  team  or  the  whole  team  of  international  or  national \nconsultants could be recruited through consulting firms. \n \n ", "10 \nD.  Justification  \n45.  ADB\u2019s assistance for the Project is justified based on its development impacts and \ndemonstration effects. It will support the Government\u2019s development plan and ADB\u2019s operational \nstrategies. ADB\u2019s participation in the Project will add substantial value in the following ways: \n \n(i)  The Project will support the energy policy in the Government\u2019s 11th FYP, which \nprioritizes the development of renewable energy projects in an environmentally \nand  socially  responsible  manner  for  the  purpose  of  optimizing  the  country\u2019s \nenergy mix, enhancing energy security, and protecting the environment.  \n \n(ii)  The Project is also in line with the Government\u2019s Western Region Development \nStrategy, which aims to enhance economic development and reduce poverty in \nwestern PRC\u2014the key theme of the 11th FYP. The strategy aims to reduce \ndevelopment disparities between the western and coastal regions.   \n \n(iii)  The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy in the PRC and the \npartnership in the energy sectors between ADB and PRC. The Project could \nbecome a model for utilizing the experience, technology, and financial resources \nof a private sector developer from a relatively developed area (Zhejiang Province \nin the Yangtze delta) to support the economic development in the remote, poor \nrural areas in the underdeveloped central and western PRC. It is fully in line with \nADB\u2019s primary goal in the PRC, which is to promote pro-poor equitable and \ninclusive growth. In the energy sector of the PRC, ADB is (a) assisting the poor \nand less-developed central and western regions, (b) promoting the development \nof clean energy, and (c) increasing interregional power transmission capacity and \nimproving power system efficiency. \n \n(iv)  The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s energy policy initiative to accelerate the \napplication of renewable energy and energy efficiency in DMCs. The small HPPs \ncan  form  part  of  a  country\u2019s  least-cost  energy  development  plan;  and  their \nenvironmental  and  social  effects,  if  any,  can  be  managed  satisfactorily  in \naccordance with established ADB policies.  \n \n(v)  The Project will help to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases by using \nclean energy, which is one major objective of ADB\u2019s program on clean energy \nand the environment and its associated CMI. ADB\u2019s technical support facility \nunder the CMI is assisting Sanchuan to process new CDM projects and generate \nmore carbon credit and will continue to do so.  \n \n(vi)  The Project reflects the energy focus of ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the \nPRC. In the infrastructure and energy sectors, ADB prioritizes pioneering projects \nwith innovative contractual and financial structuring to encourage private sector \nparticipation,  enhance  management  expertise,  and  improve  corporate \ngovernance.  The  proposed  ADB  assistance  will  optimize  Sanchuan\u2019s  capital \nstructure  and  mobilize  long-term  commercial  finance,  which  is  currently  not \navailable to the private sector, for the small hydropower sector. \n \n(vii)  The  Project  will  demonstrate  how  to  finance  small-  and  medium-scale \nhydropower projects in the PRC. As a multi-project facility, the Project will enable \nADB to extend its reach to smaller HPPs that would be difficult to assist directly, \n ", "11 \nwhile  leveraging  the  experience  and  know-how  of  a  local  developer.  The \npresence  of  ADB  and  IFC  will  also  assure  all  project  participants,  including \ninvestors, financiers, and local governments, that the Project and associated \nsmall HPPs are financially, environmentally, and socially sound and sustainable \nin the long run. \n \nE.  Anticorruption and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism  \n46.  ZDSC was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and the \nCombating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy (2003). Consistent with \nits  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require \nSanchuan to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption, money laundering \nactivities, or the financing of terrorism, and covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such \nactivities. The loan and equity investment documentation between ADB and Sanchuan will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n47.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance to \nSanchuan. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. ADB will enter \ninto finance documents acceptable to ADB following the approval of the proposed financing by \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n48.  I am satisfied that the proposed equity investment and loan would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove \n \n(i)  the  equity  investment  in  Sanchuan  Clean  Energy  Development  Company, \nLimited for an amount up to $25,000,000 to be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources; and \n \n(ii)  the loan, to Sanchuan Clean Energy Development Company, Limited, consisting \nof (a) tranche A in an amount of up to CNY400,000,000, to be provided from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources without government guarantee; an interest rate \nto be determined based on the procedures applicable to ADB local currency \nloans for private sector operations; and (b) tranche B for an amount of up to \n$120,000,000 to be funded by commercial banks under terms and conditions to \nbe mutually agreed upon by Sanchuan and the participating commercial banks \nwith the concurrence of ADB, subject to ADB\u2019s arrangement fee and annual \nadministration fee to be approved by ADB\u2019s Pricing and Credit Enhancement \nCommittee, \n \n \n \n \n ", "12 \nfor the Small Hydropower Development Project, and on such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in this report and as may be reported to the \nBoard. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n  President \n \n \n4 December 2008\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1      13 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING AND DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS FRAMEWORKS \n \nTable A1.1: Design and Monitoring Framework \nPerformance  Data Sources/  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nTargets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \n       \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \n\u2022  Sustainable  \u2022  Energy from coal  \u2022  National  \u2022  Continued \ngrowth of PRC\u2019s  reduced from the  macroeconomic data  macroeconomic \neconomy by  current 78% of total    and political \ndiversifying the  to 65% by 2020    stability \nenergy mix       \nthrough the  \u2022  Renewable energy  \u2022  Power sector statistics,  \u2022  Continued political \naddition of  to contribute 60  as reported by local  support for \nrenewable energy  GW, or 10% of  and national regulators  renewable energy \ncapacity  total, by 2010; 121    and small \n  GW, or 15%, by  hydropower  \n  2020   \n \n       \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \n\u2022  Greater installed  \u2022  Additional 10 GW of  \u2022  Statistics and  \u2022  Stable and \ncapacity of small  small hydropower  information disclosed  consistent \nhydropower  capacity by 2010 in  by the regulator and  regulatory policies \n  the PRC  state government  for the renewable \n    agencies  energy sector \n       \n\u2022  Balanced  \u2022  More than 50% of    \u2022  Continuous support \ndevelopment of  new generation    of the Government \nsmall hydropower  capacity, or 5 GW,    for the \nin the PRC,  by 2010 located in    development of \nbetween coastal  central and western    central and western \nand inland areas  PRC    PRC \n       \n\u2022  More private-      \nsector-financed  \u2022  At least 5 GW of     \nand -managed  additional small     \npower   hydropower     \n  capacity developed   \nthrough private   \ninvestment and   \nmanagement   \n \n       \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n\u2022  Sanchuan\u2019s  \u2022 About CNY2.8 billion  \u2022  Sanchuan\u2019s annual  \u2022  Sanchuan has \ncontinuous  invested by  reports  access to adequate \nexpansion in the  Sanchuan in the    financing for \nsmall hydropower  small hydropower  \u2022  ADB\u2019s annual review  acquiring and \nsector  sector by 2011  reports  building small \n ", "14      Appendix 1 \nPerformance  Data Sources/  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nTargets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \n      hydropower plants \n       \n\u2022  More hydropower  \u2022 300 MW of additional  \u2022  CDM Executive Board  \u2022  Local governments \ncapacity under  capacity through  reports  continue the \nSanchuan\u2019s  development and    privatization of \nmanagement  acquisition by 2012    small HPPs \n     \n\u2022  More efficient  \u2022 Decreasing operating   \noperations of  expenditures per   \nhydropower plants  kWh of power   \nunder  produced   \nmanagement     \n     \n\u2022  Good practice of  \u2022 All the related  \u2022  Funds for training \nESG standards  corporate policies in  on ESG are made \n  place by 2011, and  available \n  operations of   \n  Sanchuan not   \n  encumbered by ESG   \n  issues    \n     \n\u2022  Mitigation of GHG  \u2022 Registration of 1  \u2022  Continuation of \nemissions  million CER  existing regime on \n  generated by the  CDM post-Kyoto \n  Project with the CDM  protocol \n  executive board by \n  2012 \n \n   \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \n1.1.
