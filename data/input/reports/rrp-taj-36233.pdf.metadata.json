This earthquake \nhad  its  epicenter  in  neighboring  Afghanistan  with  a  recorded \nmagnitude  of  7.4  on  the  Richter  scale.  Initially,  the  landslide \nblocked  the  narrow  waterway  of  the  Vakhsh  River  approximately \n5 km downstream of the Baipaza Hydro Power Station (BHPS) in \nKhatlon Region, southern Tajikistan. As a consequence, the water \nlevel rose by about 7 meters (m), threatening to flood the BHPS. \nAlso,  generation  of  power  and  supply  of  water  for  irrigation  was \ndisrupted.  The  Government  took  the  immediate  measure  of \nblasting the landslide materials from the river to avoid flooding the \nBHPS.  Since  the  first  movement  of  3  March,  the  landslide  has \nbeen  moving  at  speeds  varying  between  a  few  millimeters  to \n1  centimeter  a  day.  There  is  an  imminent  danger  that  sudden \nmovement  of  the  landslide  will  completely  block  the  river  thus \nsubmerging the BHPS. The Project aims to restore reliable water \nflows  and  initiate  disaster  prevention  measures  by  (i)  minimizing \nthe  occurrence  and  the  magnitude  of  the  landslide,  (ii)  mitigating \nits impact on the flow of the Vaskhsh River and its blockage, and \n(iii) studying a long-term solution.  \n \nMaintaining  reliable  water  flows  in  the  Vakhsh  River  is  vital  for \nTajikistan  and  the  downstream  countries  of  Uzbekistan  and \nTurkmenistan.  Any  blockage  of  the  Vakhsh  River  would  disrupt \nthe  generation  of  the  Vakhsh  River  cascade  comprising  five \nhydropower  stations  totaling  3,858  megawatts  (MW)  of  installed \ngeneration  or  90%  of  total  generation  capacity  of  the  country. \nIn  the  worst  case,  90%  of  the  electricity  generating  capacity  of \nTajikistan  could  be  at  risk.  In  addition,  blockage  of  the  Vakhsh \nRiver  would  endanger  the  water  supply  to  downstream  users  for \nagriculture, industry, and drinking water. This would affect people \nin  the  Khatlon  Region,  and  would  disrupt  water  supply  to \nUzbekistan  and  Turkmenistan.  Further,  a  sudden  breach  of  any \nlandslide  dam  would  pose  a  threat  to  downstream  communities, \ninstallations, and infrastructure. \n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\nEnvironmental \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n\fObjectives and Scope \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n \n\niii \n\nThe primary objective of the Project is to restore water flows in the \nVakhsh  River  to  at  least  the  pre-earthquake  levels  and  to  initiate \ndisaster  prevention  measures.  This  will  be  done  by  limiting  the \noccurrence  and  magnitude  of  the  landslide  and  mitigating  its \nimpact. The Project will: \n(i)  part  A:    carry  out  emergency  slope  stabilization  measures  to \nreduce  the  threat  posed  by  the  landslide  and  assist  in  disaster \npreparedness through observational and monitoring systems and \nearth-moving plant for river clearing operations; and \n(ii)  part  B:  undertake  a  feasibility  study  to  determine  the  most \ncost-effective long-term solution to the problem.  \n \nThe Project is estimated to cost $6.65 million equivalent, of which \n$2.40 million (36%) is the foreign exchange cost and $4.25 million \nequivalent  (64%)  the  local  currency  cost.  The  cost  estimate \nincludes  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  $0.7  million \nequivalent for taxes and duties.  \n \n \n\n($ million)\n\nSource \n\nForeign \nExchange\n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \n\n% \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nTotal \n\n2.40 \n0.00 \n2.40 \n\n2.92 \n1.33 \n4.25 \n\n5.32 \n1.33 \n6.65 \n\n  80 \n  20 \n100 \n\n \n \n\nfrom \n\nthe  Special  Funds  resources  of \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  loan  of  SDR  4,001,000  ($5.32  million  equivalent)  will  be \nprovided \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and will have a term of 32 years with a \ngrace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1.0% per year \nduring the grace period, and 1.5% thereafter. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  available  to  the  Executing \nAgency through budgetary appropriations. \n \n31 May 2004 \n \n30 November 2003 \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \n\n \nMinistry of Energy \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nThe  Implementing  Agency  will  be  Barki  Tajik,  a  state-owned \nelectricity utility.

The \nPIU is staffed by local experts supported by domestic consultants. \nProvision  has  also  been  made  for  an  international  consultant  to \nprovide assistance and training in the design and execution of the \nemergency works. \n \nThe  Project  will  finance  civil  works,  materials,  machinery  and \nequipment,  and  technical  assistance.  Procurement  will  be  in \naccordance  with  the  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Mainly \nforce  account  and  local  competitive  bidding  will  be  used  for  civil \nworks,  with  some  minor  works  to  be  awarded  on  direct  selection \nbasis, taking into account the urgency of such works and the small \namount of each contract. Purchase of equipment will be based on \ninternational  shopping  procedures.  Advance  procurement  action \nhas been approved, with retroactive financing from 14 April 2002 \nup to a ceiling of $800,000 equivalent. \n \nPart  A:  A  total  of  61  person-months  of  individual  domestic \nconsulting services will be required to help implement emergency \nworks  and  procurement.  Qualified  and  experienced  domestic \nconsultants  are  available  for  these  engineering  and  construction \nworks,  and  will  be  responsible  for  survey  investigations,  detailed \ndesign,  preparation  of  bidding  documents,  assistance  during  the \nbidding  period,  bid  evaluation  and  contract  negotiation,  work \nsupervision,  quality  control,  and  environmental  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  A  further  4  person-months  of  individual  international \nconsultant  services  has  been  allocated  to  assist  with  design, \nconstruction supervision, and procurement of emergency works in \nthe early stages of implementation. \n \nPart  B:  The  services  of  9  person-months  of  international  and  33 \nperson-months of domestic consultants are required to prepare a \nfeasibility study for a long-term solution and confirm the most cost-\neffective  solution  for  maintaining  reliable  flow  of  water  in  the \nVakhsh  River.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged \nthrough  a  consulting \nthe  quality-and-cost-based \nselection method in accordance with the ADB's Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. \n \n\nfirm  under \n\n\fv \n\nthe \n\nflow \n\nThe  project  components  are  designed  to  reduce  the  risk  that  the \nlandslide  will  block \nthe  Vakhsh  River. \nBeneficiaries  of  the  project  will  include  electricity  consumers  and \nindustrial,  agricultural,  and  potable  water  users  downstream. \nThe potential losses that the Project aims to avoid are estimated \nas follows: \n \n\nthrough \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n$20  million  for  the  repair  of  the  BHPS  and  about \n$40 million in lost power generation, \nloss of production of the aluminum smelter plant, \nsignificant \nhectares (ha) of irrigated land, and \nloss  of  potable  water  supply  to  around  650,000  people \nliving in nine regions dependent on the Vakhsh River flow. \n\nlost  agricultural  production \n\nfrom  173,000 \n\n \nProlonged heavy rain or a strong earthquake would pose a risk to \nthe  implementation  and  performance  of  the  emergency  works, \nprimarily  by  triggering  another  large  landslide.  This  risk  could \nimpact  on  the  investment,  the  scheduling  of  the  works,  and  the \nsafety of personnel and plant. Other risks include nonperformance \nof  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Barki  Tajik  and  its  contractors. \nFurthermore,  there  could  be  some  risk  of  regional  political \ninstability, though this is considered to be low. \n \n \n\nProject Benefits and \n Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Emergency Baipaza Landslide Stabilization Project.  \n \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nA. \n \n2. \nMaintaining  reliable  water  flows  in  the  Vakhsh  River  is  vital  for  Tajikistan  and  the \ndownstream  countries  of  Uzbekistan  and  Turkmenistan.  Any  blockage  of  the  Vakhsh  River \nwould disrupt the generation of the Vakhsh River cascade comprising five hydropower stations \ntotaling 3,858 megawatts (MW) of installed generation or 90% of total generation capacity of the \ncountry.  In  the  worst  case,  90%  of  the  electricity  generating  capacity  of  Tajikistan  could  be  at \nrisk. In addition, blockage of the Vakhsh River would endanger the water supply to downstream \nusers  for  agriculture,  industry,  and  drinking  water.    This  would  affect  people  in  the  Khatlon \nRegion, and would disrupt water supply to Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. A sudden breach of \nany  landslide  dam  would  pose  a  threat  to  downstream  communities,  installations,  and \ninfrastructure. \n \n3. \nHydropower is the major source of energy in Tajikistan and plays an important role in the \nnational economy. It accounts for well over 90% of the energy supply. Tajikistan's power system \ncomprises  three  separate  power  grids,  the  north,  south  and  the  Gorno-Badakhshan  systems, \nwhich  are  operated  by  Barki  Tajik.  The  installed  generation  capacity  totals  4,354  megawatts \n(MW), including 4,000 MW of hydropower capacity. Out of this, the Cascade River plants of the \nVakhsh  River  represent  3,858  MW.  In  summer  time,  Tajikistan  has  on  average  an  energy \nsurplus of about 4,200 gigawatts (GWh), which is exported mainly to Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan \nand Uzbekistan. In wintertime, Tajikistan imports electricity from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan \nto meet the energy demand mainly for heating. All major hydropower plants are on the Vakhsh \nRiver.  Nurek  Hydropower  station  (NHPS)  with  3,000  MW  of  installed  capacity  is  the  largest  in \nCentral  Asia  and  generates  electricity  throughout  the  year.  It  was  constructed  in  stages  from \n1962 to 1979, and regulates the Vakhsh River flow, on a seasonal basis, for irrigation needs of \nthe Amu Darya basin countries (Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) during the growing season (May \nto  July).  Baipaza  Hydro  Power  Station  (BPHS),  located  35  kilometers  (km)  downstream  of \nNHPS, regulates the river flow on a daily basis and has a capacity of 600 MW. BHPS has been \nin operation since 1985. The Baipaza reservoir is used for water supply and irrigation purposes \nof nine regions with irrigated area of around 173,000 ha.1 This region covers most of the area \nsouth  of  Dushanbe,  which  has  a  population  of  more  than  2  million  and  has  been  identified  by \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) as a poor region under the ongoing power rehabilitation project \nloan.2  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Nine  regions  depend  on  the  Vaskhsh  River  water  for  irrigation  of  a  total  area  of  around  173,000  ha  as  follows: \nBokhtar\u201325,795  ha;  Vaskhsh\u201321,492  ha;  Yavan\u201327,025  ha;  Kolkhozabad\u201322,969  ha;  Kumsnagir\u201324,167  ha; \nSarband\u20132,380 ha; Khojamaston\u201319,225 ha; Gozimalik\u201310,780 ha; and Jilikul\u201320,000 ha.  \n\n2  ADB.  2000.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to \nTajikistan  for  the  Power  Rehabilitation  Project.  The  project  will  restore  electricity  in  24,000  households  in  the \nKhatlon Region. \n\n\f2 \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nB. \n \n4. \nAnalysis.  On  3  March  2002  at  4:10  pm,  Tajikistan  experienced  an  earthquake  of \nmagnitude  7.4  on  the  Richter  scale  and  with  its  epicenter  in  Afghanistan.  The  earthquake \ntriggered a mass of earth and rocks to slide into the Vakhsh River 5 km downstream of BHPS \non the Vakhsh River in Khatlon Region. The first landslide partly blocked the narrow waterway \nof  the  Vakhsh  River,  causing  the  water  level  at  the  landslide  to  rise  by  7  meters  (m),  and \nthreatening to flood upstream BHPS. The heavy rains that followed the landslide in early March \nworsened  this.  Flows  to  the  Pravaya-Vetka  main  canal  assisted  under  an  ADB  emergency \nloan,3 could be affected by such an event. This canal is fed through a tunnel that takes water in \nfrom the reservoir of BHPS and provides irrigation supplies to 26,000 ha and provides potable \nwater  to  220,000  people  in  three  districts.  Since  the  first  movement  on  3  March  2002,  the \nlandslide has been moving at speeds varying from a few millimeters to 1 centimeter per day. A \nmore detailed description of the landslide is given in Appendix 1. \n \n5. \nTo allow the river channel to be cleared sufficiently to enable the free flow of water, the \nBHPS had to be stopped during the day and operated only partially during the night. Explosives \nwere used to remove the natural dam, and from 12 April to 22 April the BHPS was operated at \nhalf  capacity,  releasing  water  only  for  the  minimum  of  irrigation  requirements  downstream.  A \nfurther  cessation  of  operation  will  be  necessary  to  allow  additional  widening  of  the  riverbed  at \nthe landslide location, in order to decrease the water level at the BHPS by a further 2 m.  \n \n6. \nThe immediate and direct impact of future river blockages will be the disruption of power \ngeneration  in  Tajikistan  and  water  supply  for  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan, \nincluding  for  irrigation  of  around  173,000  ha.  NHPS,  as  the  largest  hydropower  station  of  the \nCentral  Asian  Electric  System,  is  a  significant  contributor  to  the  region's  load-frequency \nregulation.  Should  the  Vakhsh  River  become  blocked,  the  NHPS  will  have  to  cease  operation \ntemporarily,  and  the  stability  of  the  whole  Central  Asian  System  may  suffer.  In  addition,  the \nBHPS would be submerged and severely damaged by flooding. \n \n7. \nThe indirect impact will be the stoppage of aluminum production, which is highly energy \ndependent. Tajik Aluminum Smelter (TADAZ), the government-owned aluminum smelter, is one \nof  the  largest  industrial  users  of  electricity  and  had  a  demand  of  about  600  MW  in  2002.  The \nhydropower  plant  of  Nurek  directly  supplies  the  TADAZ  factory.  This  factory,  with  a  capacity \nestimated  at  390,000  tons  per  year,  exports  almost  the  entire  aluminum  production, \npredominantly  to  the  Netherlands  (49%),  Turkey  (19%),  Belgium  (13%),  and  Iran  (6%).  A \nblocking  of  the  Vakhsh  River  would  therefore  drastically  reduce  foreign  currency  revenues  for \nTajikistan. \n \n8. \nFinally, if a river blockage were to occur and could not be removed quickly, then, in the \nworst  case  outcome,  the  resultant  dam  could  eventually  breach  catastrophically,  resulting  in \ndownstream flooding and damage to livelihoods, power generation, and water supply. \n \n9. \nAt  the  request  of  the  Government,  ADB  staff  joined  on  6  April  2002  the  site  visit \norganized  by  the  Tajik  Prime  Minister  and  comprising  heads  of  diplomatic  missions,  senior \nrepresentatives  of  the  United  Nations  (UN),  and  international  financial  institutions  based  in \nTajikistan.  On  18  April  2002,  the  Government  sent  a  formal  request  to  ADB  for  urgent \n\n                                                 \n3   The project area of Loan 1852-TAJ is located in the irrigation service area of Pravaya-Vatka main canal. \n \n\n\f3 \n\nto  address \n\n(ii)  prevent \n\nthis  natural  calamity, \n\nassistance  to  stabilize  the  Baipaza  landslide.  Appraisal4  for  the  Project  was  undertaken  from  \n12 to 25 June 2002, and loan negotiations with authorized representatives of the Government \nwere conducted from 12 to 14 August 2002.  \n \nThe  Government  acted  quickly  to  assess  the  extent  of  the  damage,  implement \n10. \nemergency measures to avoid the submersion of the BHPS, and prepare cost estimates for the \nnecessary rehabilitation works to restore the reliability of water flow in the river in the Baipaza \narea to the pre-earthquake condition. \n \n11. \nThe  emergency  rehabilitation  measures  are  required  to  reduce  the  risk  posed  by  the \nBaipaza landslide and to  confirm the most cost-effective long-term solution. The combination of \nemergency measures and disaster preparedness is considered  the best response to address \nthe  landslide.  For  a  long-term  solution,  a  number  of  alternatives  may  be  considered,  including \nfurther  improvements  to  slope  stability  and  river  management  options  that  include  the  relief \ntunnel already proposed. Such ADB assistance to the Government would be in line with ADB's \npolicy  on  emergency  operations  as  it  will  (i)  avoid  diverting  the  Government's  development \nthe  potentially  catastrophic \nresources \nconsequences of the still moving landslide,5 (iii) restore the full generating capacity of the BHPS \nas  well  as  the  previous  water  flows  of  the  Vaskhsh  River,  (iv)  increase  the  reliability  of  power \nand water irrigation supplies, (v) involve simple solutions that do not require a long preparation \nperiod,  (vi)  have  the  full  support  of  the  Government  through  its  participation  in  the  steering \ncommittee,  and  (vii)  help  evolve  an  effective  long-term  strategy  to  mitigate/eliminate  the \nlandslide impact . \n \nLessons  Incorporated.  The  lessons  learned  from  a  number  of  emergency  projects \n12. \nfinanced by ADB have been incorporated in the project design. Of particular relevance are the \nEmergency  Flood  Rehabilitation  Project  (EFRP)6  and  the  Emergency  Restoration  of  Yavan \nWater Conveyance System Project (ERYWCSP),7 which are the two emergency loans financed \nby  ADB  in  Tajikistan  and  are  performing  creditably.  Involvement  of  the  Government  in  these \nprojects has been important for their success. A similar degree of Government involvement has \nbeen  built  into  the  present  project.  Under  the  Power  Rehabilitation  Project  approved  in  2000, \nproject implementation has been slower than anticipated. There is a delay of about one year in \nimplementation  consultants  due  to  the  executing  agency\u2019s \nrecruitment  of \nunfamiliarity with ADB procedures, possibly on account of being a first-time borrower of a loan \nfrom ADB. To avoid similar problems under this Project, the same executing agency as under \nthe  Power  Rehabilitation  Project  will  act  as  the  implementing  agency  for  this  Project.  The \nProject will use the same core project implementation unit (PIU) as for the Power Rehabilitation \nProject,  with  staff  that  has  been  trained  in  ADB's  procedures  and  guidelines.  Imprest  account \nprocedures with initial deposit and simplified procurement procedures being proposed under this \nProject will mitigate the risk of delays in implementation of the Project.  \n\nthe  project \n\n \n\n                                                 \n4   The Mission comprised X. Humbert, Mission Leader/Energy Specialist, and G.

The specific project objective is to restore water \nflows  in  the  Vakhsh  River  to  at  least  the  preearthquake  levels  and  initiate  disaster  prevention \nmeasures.  The  project  activities  will  limit  further  damage  from  the  Baipaza  landslide  and \nmitigate its impact on the flow of water in the Vakhsh River. The project framework is given in \nAppendix 2. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  Project  has  two  parts,  emergency  slope  stabilization  and  disaster  preparedness, \n\n14. \nand study of a long-term solution for disaster prevention (details are in Appendix 3). \n \n\n1. \n\nPart A:  Emergency Slope Stabilization and Disaster Preparedness \n\n15. \nPart A is intended to minimize the immediate threat to the flow of the Vakhsh River. The \ninvestigation,  design,  procurement,  and  commissioning  of  a  long-term  solution  could  take \nseveral  years  to  implement.  Emergency  measures  are  therefore  needed  to  reduce  the  risk \nposed by the landslide during this period. This approach is proposed because it (i) recognizes \nthe  scale  and  complexity  of  the  landslide  problem;  (ii)  incorporates  reasonable  and  necessary \nprecautionary  measures  to  reduce  the  rate  and  continuation  of  land  slippage;  and  (iii)  allows \npreparedness  for  the  realistic  worst  case  outcome  should  it  arise  during  the  implementation \nperiod. The two courses of action to achieve this are as follows (details shown in Appendix 4): \n \n16. \nrate of slippage. The proposed emergency rehabilitation measures comprise the following: \n \n\nSlope  Stabilization  Measures.  The  stability  of  the  slope  will  be  improved  to  slow  the \n\nimproving  and  constructing  access  and  haul  roads  to  the  site  and  to  the  proposed \nexcavation spoil disposal locations (up to 30 km of access road), \n \ncutting back and benching the slope immediately above the landslide to reduce load \nand  remove  material  that  might  otherwise  fail  and  aggravate  stability  conditions \nbelow (estimated 600,000  cubic meters [m3] of material), \n\ndraining  the  benched  cut  back  and  the  natural  slopes  above  the  landslide,  and  in \nparticular  reducing  subsurface  seepage  water  entering  the  slide  mass  (2  km  of \ndrains), \n\nremoving slipped masses, wherever practicable and desirable, from the area below \nthe  current  landslide  to  reduce  load  and  remove  material  that  would  otherwise  fail \nagain and aggravate stability conditions below (200,000 m3), and \n\n(v) \n\ndraining the middle slope of the landslide. \n\n \n\nThe implementation of the above works requires the following activities: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n17. \n \n\n\f5 \n\n(i) \n\nSurvey and investigation will be required to confirm the details and quantities of the \nemergency  works.  The  survey  will  comprise  a  topographic  survey  of  the  landslide, \nthe  areas  to  be  cut  back  and  removed,  and  the  access  to  the  spoil  disposal  sites. \nPart of this survey has been undertaken by Barki Tajik and the costs incurred since \n14  April  2002  have  been  incorporated  into  the  Project.  The  investigation  will \ncomprise  geological  mapping,  drilling,  and  trial  pitting  to  define  in  more  detail  the \nmechanics  of  the  landslide  and  to  yield  geotechnical  data  to  finalize  the  design  of \nearthworks. These investigations are limited to those required to advance the design \nand  implementation  of  the  emergency  works.  Engineering  geological  mapping  is \nconsidered to be the most important of the investigation activities. \n\n(ii)  Design  will  comprise  confirming  earthworks  slopes  and  other  stability  calculations, \ndrainage configuration, and standard details; the detailed location and typical cross-\nsection of access roads; the layout and formation of spoil areas and the production of \ndesign  drawings;  general  arrangement  drawings;  bills  of  quantities;  specifications; \nbid documents; and contract documentation. \n\n(iii)  Road  construction  and  improvement  will  comprise  improving  existing  tracks  to \nallow  access  to  the  site  and  to  spoil  areas  for  earth  moving  plant  and  vehicles.  \nIn most cases, a four-wheel drive track already exists, but to hasten the works, a new \nroad  will  be  needed  from  the  top  of  the  landslide  to  the  spoil  areas,  in  order  to \ndecrease haulage distances. \n\n(iv) \n\nEarthworks  will  comprise  a  benched  cut-back  at  the  head  of  the  landslide  to \nimprove  overall  stability  in  that  area  and  reduce  potential  volumes  of  failure.  An \noutline design has already been prepared by Barki Tajik. Earthworks will also include \nthe selected removal of landslipped masses from beneath the back scar. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(v)  Drainage is a key element in the stability of the entire slope and it is important that \nsteps  are  taken  wherever  practicable  to  prevent  water  from  entering  the  landslide \nmass  in  the  first  place.  Lines  of  concentrated  subsurface  flow  have  been  identified \nand these will require excavation and discharge away from the landslide. Two types \nof  drain  are  proposed:  (a)  a  conventional  French  drain  with  perforated  plastic  pipe, \nfilter  material,  and  backfill;  and  (b)  a  deeper  open  trench  drain  with  impermeable \ninvert. \n\n \nThe above activities will be carried out under the management of the Barki Tajik PIU and \n18. \nassisted by a team of domestic consultants. The Project implementation support component will \nprovide  inputs  for  surveys,  investigation,  design,  construction  supervision,  environmental \nmonitoring, and social impact assessment. The PIU will implement the Project. The PIU will be \nsupported by 61 person-months of individual domestic consultant input.  \n \n19. \nAn  individual  international  consultant  will  be  assigned  during  the  early  stages  of  the \nimplementation  to  confirm  the  design  and  guide  the  implementation  of  the  works.  This  is \nconsidered to be essential given the high-risk circumstances and relative inexperience of Barki \nTajik, local consultants, and local contractors in dealing with problems of this nature and scale. \nFour person-months of foreign expert time have been set aside to cover this on-the-job training \nactivity. \n \n20. \nDisaster Preparedness Measures. Because the slope may still fail due to heavy rain or \nan  earthquake,  improvements  in  disaster  preparedness  will  allow  the  Tajikistan  authorities  to \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nrespond  more  quickly  and  effectively  if  the  river  is  blocked  again  during  the  implementation \nperiod. These measures comprise the following elements: \n \n\n(i)  Rainfall  will  be  monitored  and  the  visual,  survey,  and  photographic  monitoring  of \nthe slope will continue. The rain gauge will be an automatic, continuously recording \ndevice installed at the BHPS. It will allow recorded and observed movements to be \ncompared against recorded rainfall conditions.  \n\n(ii)  Equipment  and  materials  will  be  provided  to  allow  the  Tajikistan  authorities  to  act \nas  quickly  as  possible  to  restore  flow  in  the  Vakhsh  River,  were  it  to  become \nblocked or severely restricted by further movements of the Baipaza landslide during \nthe implementation period.  \n\n2. \n\nPart B:  Feasibility Study \n\n \n21. \nPart  B  will  evaluate  the  technical  feasibility  and  financial  and  economic  viability  of  the \nlong-term  solutions  and  options,  including  the  construction  of  1\u20132  river  flow  relief  tunnels  for \nbypassing the landslide.  \n \n22. \n \n\nThe feasibility study is divided into three elements: \n\n(i)  The appropriateness of the preferred solution for the management of flow through \nthe  Vakhsh  River  at  the  Baipaza  landslide  will  be  confirmed,  and  an  initial  design \nmade. \n\n \n\n(ii)  Landslide hazards in the Vakhsh River corridor will be mapped. Aerial photograph \ninterpretation,  published  topographical  maps  and  geological  mapping  will  be \ncombined  to  prepare  a  landslide  location  map  for  the  Vakhsh  Valley  (both  valley \nsides) at a scale of 1:10,000, from the BHPS to approximately 25 km downstream, \nas  far  as  the  Sangtudinskaya  hydropower  station.  A  summary  assessment  of  all \nhigh hazard slopes in this study area will be prepared, and will include their likely \neffect  on  the  flow  in  the  Vakhsh  River  and  the  operation  of  the  Baipaza  and \nSangtudinskaya hydropower stations. \n\n(iii)  Scope,  terms  of  reference,  and  cost  estimates  will  be  prepared  for  the  detailed \n\ndesign of the long-term solution. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nThe  terms  of  reference  and  implementation  program  for  the  feasibility  study  are \n\n \n23. \ncontained in Appendix 4. The study will be completed over a period of 6 months. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nThe  Baipaza  landslide  is  probably  the  largest  slope  failure  to  be  affecting  such  high \nvalue installations in Tajikistan. Few active landslides in the world have the same dimensions as \nthat at Baipaza. That the landslide occupies a valley side that is virtually entirely composed of \nancient, though probably active landslides, is also highly significant.  \n \n25. \nAnother  special  feature  relates  to  the  critical  need  for  implementing  emergency \nprecautionary measures as soon as possible. It is imperative that the majority of the works are \nimplemented before the forthcoming wet season (beginning in November) and this will require \nfast-tracking  the  loan  arrangements  and  critical  path  execution  of  the  emergency  works.  The \n\n\fprocurement of special Global Positioning System equipment that allows rapid survey is a way \nin which new technology can be used to expedite the project. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates  \n\n26. \nThe Project is estimated to cost $6.65 million equivalent, of which $2.40 million (36%) is \nthe  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $4.25  million  equivalent  (64%)  the  local  currency.  The  cost \nestimates include physical and price contingencies. A summary of the cost estimates is given in \nTable 1 and detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 5. \n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nTable 1: Project Cost Summary ($\u2019000) \n  \n\n  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \nForeign \nExchange \n\nCosts \nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \n\n \n \n\n287 \n1,681 \n300 \n0 \n2,268 \n\n52 \n19 \n65 \n\n2,404 \n36% \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n3,000 \n13 \n100 \n700 \n3,813 \n\n401 \n34 \n0 \n\n4,248 \n64% \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n  \nTotal \nCost \n\n3,287 \n1,694 \n400 \n700 \n6,081 \n\n453 \n53 \n65 \n\n6,652 \n100% \n\n \n\n \nItem \n\n  \n\na.

The provision of local cost financing is justified because of \nbudgetary  constraints  of  the  Government.  The  Government  will  meet  the  remaining  local \ncurrency  cost  of  $1.33  million  equivalent,  or  approximately  20%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The \nBorrower will be the Republic of Tajikistan.  The loan will be provided from ADB's Special Funds \nresources and will have a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest \ncharge of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter.  \n \n28. \n \n\nThe financing plan is summarized in Table 2. \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nTable 2:  Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n2.40 \n0.00 \n2.40 \n\n2.92 \n1.33 \n4.25 \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n5.32 \n1.33 \n6.65 \n\n% \n\n80 \n20 \n100 \n\n29. \nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Energy  (MOE),  which  is \nheaded by a vice prime minister. The Implementing Agency will be Barki Tajik. Barki Tajik has \nthe  principal  functions  of  generating  electricity  for  Tajikistan  and  maintaining  the  hydropower \nstations  of  the  Vakhsh  River  Cascade.  Barki  Tajik,  which  is  implementing  the  temporary  and \nurgent  works,  has  already  established  a  PIU  in  Dushanbe  under  the  ongoing  Power \nRehabilitation  Project,8  financed  by  ADB,  and  is  proposing  to  extend  it  by  setting  up  a  project \nsite  office  in  Baipaza.  The  PIU  is  staffed  by  local  experts  on  a  fulltime  basis  supported  by \ndomestic consultants. Details of the PIU organization are provided in Appendix 6. The PIU will \nbe  responsible  for  (i)  the  overall  management  of  the  Project,  including  approval  of  design, \npreparation  and  evaluation  of  bidding  documents,  award  of  the  contracts,  and  procurement  of \nmaterials and equipment; (ii) recruitment and supervision of consulting services; (iii) supervision \nof  implementation  and  quality  control  of  project  works;  (iv)  liaison  with  any  communities  and \nvillages affected by the works; and (v) preparation of reports and communications with ADB.  \n \nA  steering  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  deputy  prime  minister  in  charge  of  the \n30. \nministries of transport, trade, construction, energy, industry and emergency situations, and will \ninclude senior-level representatives from the ministries of finance, energy, and environment as \nwell as from Barki Tajik. The steering committee will be responsible for coordinating all relevant \nparties involved in the project implementation, including the formulation of a long-term solution \nto landslide risks under the part B of the Project. The steering committee will meet at least once \nevery quarter.  \n \n\n2.  \n\nImplementation Period \n\n31. \nThe Project will be implemented over a period of 20 months, with physical completion by \nNovember  2003,  on  the  understanding  that  preparatory  survey  and  design  works  commence \nimmediately. The project implementation schedule (Appendix 7) shows that all of the emergency \nworks  at  site  are  scheduled  to  be  carried  out  during  the  dry  seasons  (normally  May-October \ninclusive)  of  2002  and  2003.  During  the  intervening  wet  season  of  2002/03,  the  weather  and \nground conditions are unsuitable for construction activity: this period coincides with the wettest \nperiod of the year and the period when snow cover and freezing is likely to be greatest. For this \nreason,  no  site  works  have  been  scheduled  for  this  period.  According  to  the  implementation \nschedule  discussed  and  agreed  upon  with  Barki  Tajik  project  officers,  the  only  emergency \nactivities that will not be completed by then relate to the excavation and haulage from the top of \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President on a Proposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grants \n\nfor the Power Rehabilitation Project. Manila. \n\n\f9 \n\nthe  slide.  Slightly  less  than  half  of  the  cut-back  at  the  top  of  the  landslide  can  be  achieved \nduring  the  dry  season  of  2002.  Temporary  drainage  and  erosion  protection  will  need  to  be \ninstalled on the excavation terraces until the excavation is completed in 2003. The equipment to \nbe procured under part A will assist in the earthworks program. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n32. \nGoods and services to be financed by ADB will be procured in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Contracts  for  supply  of  equipment  will  be  procured  based  on \ninternational  shopping  procedures  (with  a  limit  of  $700,000  per  contract),  civil  works  will  be \ncarried out based on local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB, and minor works \nwill  be  carried  out  on  a  force  account/direct  selection9  basis.  A  tentative  procurement  and \npackaging list is given in Appendix 8. \n  \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n\nOn 6 August 2002, ADB approved (i) advance action to recruit consultants and procure \n33. \nequipment  and  civil  works;  and  (ii)  retroactive  financing  of  the  project  works  effective  from  14 \nApril  2002,  which  is  the  date  the  river  was  blocked  by  the  landslide.10  Advance  action  for \nprocurement  and  consultant  selection  and  retroactive  financing  are  necessary  to  expedite \nproject implementation considering that the proposed works are critical taking into account the \nemergency  of  the  situation.  In  particular,  it  is  imperative  that  earthworks  be  advanced  prior  to \nthe  onset  of  the  next  wet  season.  This  is  critical  to  minimize  slide  movement.  Retroactive \nfinancing  will  help  avoid  disrupting  the  Government\u2019s  development  programs  in  the  face  of \nbudgetary  constraints.  The  retroactive  financing  will  be  limited  to  loan-related  expenditures \nsince  14  April  200211  until  loan  effectiveness,  and  subject  to  a  ceiling  of  $0.8  million.  The \nGovernment was advised that approval of the advance action and retroactive financing does not \ncommit ADB to financing of the Project. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n34. \nA total of 61 person-months of domestic consultants financed by the loan will be required \nto assist the PIU. Adequately qualified and experienced domestic consultants are available for \nthese  engineering  and  construction  works.  The  consultants  will  be  responsible  for  surveys, \ninvestigations,  detailed  design,  preparation  of  tender  documents,  construction  supervision, \nquality  control,  environmental  monitoring,  and  social  assessment.  Field  engineers  will  be \nresponsible for the day-to-day supervision of contractors. An international consultant will also be \nrequired to oversee initial project establishment and procurement and to verify and approve the \ndesign. Four person-months have been allocated to this. \n \nThe  PIU  will  select  and  engage  individual  domestic  consultants  in  accordance  with \n35. \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for the \nselection and engagement of domestic consultants. The terms of reference and time inputs for \nconsulting services are in Appendix 9. The international consultant will be recruited by the PIU \nin accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n   \n                                                 \n9   Given the urgency of having the work performed, and the small amount of each contract, three contracts totalling \n\n$64,000 have been awarded to specialist state-owned companies on direct selection basis. \n\n10  The  advance  action  and  retroactive  financing  were  reported  in  the  August  2002  edition  of  ADB  Business \n\nOpportunities. \n\n11 This date corresponds to the effective time when the first works were carried out by Barki Tajik on the landslide. \n\n\f10 \n\nConsultants for the feasibility study will comprise foreign and local specialists and will be \n36. \nprocured  on  a  simplified  procedure  and  quality-and-cost-based  selection  method  through  the \nsimplified technical proposal in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants or \nother arrangements acceptable to ADB. Services of about 9 person-months of international and \n33 person-months of domestic consultants will be needed (Appendix 4). \n  \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nTo expedite implementation of the Project through timely release of loan proceeds, the \n37. \nGovernment  will  establish  an  imprest  account  promptly  after  loan  effectiveness  with  an  initial \ndeposit of $0.5 million equivalent. The imprest account will be established in a commercial bank, \nand will be managed and liquidated through statement of expenditure procedure in accordance \nwith ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook. ADB's statement of expenditures procedure will be \nused to reimburse expenditures and liquidate the imprest account for payments not exceeding \n$50,000  equivalent  each.  The  experience  of  the  Emergency  Flood  Rehabilitation  (footnote  6) \nand  the  Emergency  Rehabilitation  of  the  Yavan  Water  Conveyance  System  Projects  \n(footnote  7)  shows  that  the  Government  has  the  capacity  to  maintain  an  imprest  account  and \nexpenditure record in accordance with generally acceptable accounting standards. \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n38.  MOE  will  maintain  separate  project  records  and  accounts  and  will  have  the  accounts \naudited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Copies  of  audited  project \naccounts  will  be  provided  to  ADB  within  six  months  after  the  end  of  each  relevant  fiscal  year. \nMOE  will  provide  brief  quarterly  and  annual  reports  to  ADB.  These  reports  will  indicate  the \nprogress  made  and  problems  encountered,  the  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the \nproblems, and the disbursements during the period under review. In addition it will indicate the \nproposed program of activities, and the expected disbursement for the following period. Within  \n3 months of physical completion of the project, MOE will submit to ADB a completion report that \nprovides details about implementation, costs, benefits, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n39. \nThe Government and ADB will jointly carry out a midterm review of the Project at the end \nof  the  first  construction  season,  in  November  2002.  The  midterm  review  will  form  part  of  the \nprocess  of  building  a  strong  working  relationship  and  will  assess  (i)  implementation  status,  \n(ii)  design  and  construction  standards,  (iii)  physical  progress  made  and  disbursements  in \nrelation  to  the  implementation  schedule,  (iv)  performance  of  the  consultants  and  contractors,  \n(v) status of compliance with the covenants stipulated in the loan agreement, and (vi) the need \nfor any additional works or changes in the project scope to take into account any further delayed \nconsequences or landslide/earthquake activities. \n \nG. \n\nThe Executing Agency and the Implementing Agency \n\n40.  MOE, the Executing Agency, is responsible for overseeing and coordinating activities in \nthe energy sector. The Implementing Agency, Barki Tajik, is the state-owned utility responsible \nfor  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  of  electricity  in  Tajikistan.  Prior  to  the  country\u2019s \nindependence, the entity was administratively a government agency. In 1992, it became a state \njoint  stock  holding  company.  Although  it  is  fully  owned  by  the  Government,  Barki  Tajik  enjoys \nautonomous status according to its charter. \n \n\n\f11 \n\nUnder  the  present  institutional  arrangement,  Barki  Tajik  consists  of  a  network  of  10 \n41. \nsubsidiary power generation companies, 11 subsidiary distribution companies, and 8 supporting \ncompanies including a research institute and construction companies. The chairperson of Barki \nTajik, who has overall responsibility for operations, reports directly to the Prime Minister, and is \nappointed by the Government with no fixed term. The chairperson is assisted by the first deputy \nchairperson (chief engineer), who manages Barki Tajik\u2019s day-to-day operations, and six deputy \nchairpersons,  who  are  in  charge  of  the  technical  departments,  supporting  services,  and \nsubsidiary  power  generation  and  distribution  companies.  Since  1999,  the  Government  has \ncreated  business  units  for  some  of  these  subsidiaries,  with  ownership  rights  vested  directly  in \nthe  State  Property  Committee  on  behalf  of  the  Government  but  with  business  management \nresponsibilities assigned to Barki Tajik. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits \n\nA. \n \nThe Project aims primarily to restore reliable water flows in the Vakhsh River. For this, \n42. \nthe  Project  will  minimize  the  risk  posed  by  the  Baipaza  landslide  to  the  flow  of  water  in  the \nVakhsh River and consequently the operation of the BHPS. The Project will improve long-term \nstability  and  provide  long-term  remedial  measures,  while  at  the  same  time  equipping  the \nGovernment with plant, materials, and know-how to deal with and monitor landslide movements \nin  the  short  term.  The  Project  will  also  supplement  the  Tajik  skills  in  landslide  studies  and \nplanning for landslides. \n \nThe  Project  benefits  are  savings  in  lost  output  that  would  result  from  the  landslide  if  it \n43. \nfails.  Potential  losses  that  may  be  incurred  if  the  Project  is  not  implemented  are  estimated  as \nfollows: \n \n\n(i) \n\nlost generation of $40 million, taking into account an unavailability of 24 hours for \nthe whole Vaskhsh River Cascade and an unavailability of 2 years for the BHPS as \na result of submersion; \n\ncost of $20 million for rehabilitating the BHPS after flooding, taking into account that \n25% to 30% of the electromechanical equipment might have to be rehabilitated; \n\nloss of revenue from TADAZ; \n\nlosses in irrigated agriculture (the Vaskhsh River irrigates 66% of the cotton fields \nof Tajikistan); and \n\n(v) \n\nsocial losses as a result of disruption of potable water supply. \n\nSocial, Environmental, and Economic Impacts \n\n \nB. \n \n44. \nThe  Government  and  Barki  Tajik  have  agreed  to  put  in  place  all  necessary \nenvironmental protection and to carry out the works in accordance with the environmental law \nand regulations of Tajikistan and ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines. They have also agreed, and \nprovision has been made, for staff of the Ministry of Environment to be involved as advisers and \nobservers  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  works  and  the  monitoring  of  any \nenvironmental effects. \n \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nA  summary  initial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken  and  is  presented  in \n45. \nAppendix  10.  All  potential  impacts  identified  can  be  avoided/mitigated  by  design  and  by \nconstruction  planning  and  supervision.  The  environmental  condition  at  the  site  can  be  further \nconfirmed  by  staff  of  the  Ministry  of  Environment.  The  findings  indicate  that  the  negative \nenvironmental impacts of the Project can be mitigated to an acceptable level. Hence the Project \nis  classified  as  environmental  category  B,  which  does  not  require  a  full-scale  environmental \nimpact assessment. \n \nNo  negative  impact  will  persist  during  the  operation  phase.  Moreover,  positive  impacts \n46. \ncan  be  envisaged  through  the  restoration  of  water  flow  in  the  Vakhsh  River  and  potentially \nthrough a longer term decrease in suspended solids and sediments. \n \nBlockage  of  the  Vakhsh  River  has  distinct  negative  consequences  downstream  for  the \n47. \nlivelihoods of large populations, industry, and the economy. Regardless of the details of the final \nsolution that is selected, the Project will help improve management of the Vakhsh River flow at \nBaipaza, and hence have positive social, environmental, and economic impacts. \n \n48. \nThe Project will not involve resettlement or land acquisition. The spoil areas are not used \nfor  agriculture  or  habitation  and  are  state  property.  The  Baipaza  landslide  area  cannot  be \nreturned to productive land use in the foreseeable future. Improvements to the flow of water in \nVakhsh  River,  however,  have  major  positive  implications  for  land  use  and  water  abstraction \ndownstream.  The  Project  has  the  overall  aim  of  eventually  improving  the  flow  of  water  in  the \nVakhsh River, which will benefit agriculture and water supply downstream. A summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is given in Appendix 11. \n \n49. \nNo human settlements are in the immediate vicinity of the landslide and therefore there \nare  no  resettlement  issues.  There  is  no  major  expropriation  of  agricultural  or  otherwise \neconomic land, and no obvious impacts on ecology. The only issue identified relates to the likely \ncontinued use of explosives to clear the river immediately after landslide movement takes place, \nand  this  has  some  negative  implications,  most  significantly  geotechnical.  The  construction  of \naccess roads and the development of spoil disposal areas may have some physical effects, but \nBarki Tajik confirms the readiness to minimize these. \n \nC. \n \n50. \nNature Risk. A large rainstorm or prolonged period of heavy rain could be a significant \nhazard  to  the  progress  of  the  Project  and  its  applicability  given  the  new  slope  condition. \nFurthermore, an earthquake of significant intensity would endanger the progress of the Project. \nThe  project  design,  through  advance  fast-track  procurement  procedures,  an  imprest  fund  with \nretroactive  facilities,  and  disbursement  facilities,  will  allow  the  completion  of  most  of  the  initial \nactivities before the start of  the next wet season in November 2002. \n \n51. \nPolitical Risk. The Project is near Dushanbe where the social and political situation is \ncalmer than in other parts of Tajikistan. The political risk during Project implementation is hence \nlimited  also  because  of  the  short  duration  of  the  Project,  which  is  about  20  months.  The \nGovernment involvement, through its participation at a highest level in the steering committee of \nthe Project, will largely mitigate the political risk. The quick measures taken by the Government \nunder the Project will enhance political stability in Tajikistan. \n \n52. \nProject Delay. Project could be delayed due to the (i) nature of the works, (ii) inability of \ncontractors  to  meet  quality  and  schedule,  and  (iii)  inexperience  of  Barki  Tajik  with  ADB's \n\nRisks \n\n\f13 \n\nprocurement  procedures.  The  risk  of  project  delays  will  be  actively  managed  through  close \nmonitoring of implementation progress by the PIU and the steering committee, and regular ADB \nreview  missions.  Advance  procurement  action,  adoption  of  international  shopping,  and  local \ncompetitive bidding will largely reduce the risk of delayed procurement. \n \n53. \nCost Overrun. Cost overruns could occur due to uncertainties in the precise scope and \nquantities of work. However, this is expected to be manageable, given that substantial physical \ncontingencies  (13%)  have  been  provided  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  cost  overruns  and  the  risk  of \ncost overruns. The risk of cost overruns due to inflation is limited because of the short period of \nimplementation. \n\n \n\nV. \n\n ASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n54. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nThe Government, through MOE and Barki Tajik, will ensure that the Project is carried \nout  in  accordance  with  applicable  Tajik  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and \nADB's  environmental  guidelines.    All  necessary  environmental  approvals  and \nclearances  will  be  obtained  in  a  timely  manner  in  accordance  with  such  laws  and \nregulations. The Government and Barki Tajik will also ensure that all environmental \nmitigation  measures  required  satisfying  Tajik  and  ADB  environmental  requirements \nwill be incorporated in the design and carried out during project implementation. \n\nthe \nThe  Government, \nimplementation  of  the  mitigating  measures  as  outlined  in  the  summary  initial \nenvironmental examination (Appendix 8). \n\nthrough  MOE  and  Barki  Tajik,  will  regularly  report \n\nthat  appropriate  provisions  and  compensation \nThe  Government  will  ensure \nmechanism are in place for hay and cattle fodder losses that may occur during the \nexecution of the Project. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n55. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 4,001,000 to the Republic of Tajikistan for the \nEmergency  Baipaza  Landslide  Stabilization  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with \nan interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board. \n\n \n \n \nMYOUNG-HO SHIN \nVice-President \n \n\n19 August 2002 \n\n\f14 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nTHE BAIPAZA LANDSLIDE \n \n \n \n\nOn 3 March 2002, an earthquake triggered a landslide 5 kilometers (km) downstream of \n1. \nthe  Baipaza  Hydro  Power  Station  (BHPS).  This  was  the  second  earthquake  (the  first  was  in \n1992) at this location since the commissioning of the BHPS in 1986, although the first recorded \nfailure  took  place  in  1968,  before  the  BHPS  was  constructed.  In  March  1968  the  landslide \ncomprised 25\u201330 million cubic meters (m3) of material and the river was blocked for 2 weeks to \nan  elevation  of  600  meters  (m)  upstream  of  the  landslide  dam  (the  current  water  level  is \napproximately 565\u2013570 m and the elevation of the turbine hall at the BHPS is 581.5 m). In May \n1992, the level of the water upstream of the landslide rose to 580 m. The March 2002 landslide \nresulted in a 5 m high natural dam causing a water level rise to 572 m at the landslide and an \nincrease in water level of 7\u20138 m at the BHPS.  \n \n2. \nThe landslide is part of an area of ancient (probably immediately post-glacial) deep-seated \nfailure involving the entire valley side. The Baipaza landslide is approximately 1,800 m in length \nand  800  m  wide  at  its  widest  part,  alongside  the  River  Vakhsh.  The  landslide  has  a  shape  and \nmechanism of movement similar to an egg timer. The upper part is a wide source area of failing \nground  whereby  large  masses  of  slope  are  detached  progressively.  These  masses  rapidly  find \ntheir way through the narrow throat of the landslide and are deposited onto a large colluvial mass \nof material that forms the entire lower slope adjacent to the river. The depth of this mass is about \n30\u201340  m.  Slippage  is  continuing  due  to  loading  from  failing  materials  and  the  build  up  of \ngroundwater during the wet season. Due to the control of flow in the river by the upstream power \nstations (Baipaza and Nurek), river scour of the toe of the slope is unlikely to be as severe as it \nmight otherwise have been prior to construction of the installations.  \n \n3. \nThe  total  volume  of  the  landslide  is  unknown,  but  is  estimated  by  Barki  Tajik  to  be  \n5 million to 25 million m3. The Mission\u2019s observations suggest that the landslide might be of the \norder of 7 million to10 million m3. The current speed of landslide movement is estimated to be in \nthe  range  of  0.7  to  1.0  centimeter  (cm)  per  day,  which  is  a  dry  season  rate,  and  rates  of \nmovement in the forthcoming wet season are anticipated to be much higher. \n \n4. \nIt  is  impossible  to  say  when  and  to  what  extent  the  next  failure  will  occur.  Slope \nmovement will be governed significantly by the rainfall pattern and the timing and magnitude of \nseismic  activity.  The  failure  of  approximately  350,000  m3  is  imminent  in  the  mudslide  at  the \nnorthern  end  of  the  landslide  adjacent  to  the  river.  If  only  a  third  of  this  material  reaches  the \nwaterway, it could block the river to a similar depth as the slide in 1968 (30 m). Such a failure \ncould also activate a much larger unstable area immediately upslope with a volume approaching \n1 million m3 or more. All of this material is not likely to be deposited in the river instantaneously. \nIf  the  rainfall  conditions  over  the  next  few  years  remain  low  to  moderate,  and  the  area  is  not \naffected by any significant seismic or blasting activity, then slope failures during the short term \ncould  be  relatively  small,  especially  if  the  proposed  works  at  the  top  of  the  slide  are \nimplemented  rapidly  and  effectively.  However,  the  future  behavior  of  the  landslide,  even  over  \n1\u20133 years cannot be predicted with any certainty, and a large failure could occur. Therefore, the \nmonitoring of movements on the slide should be expanded and extended to record the details of \nmovements  during  the  forthcoming  and  following  wet  seasons  and  a  rain  gauge  should  be \nestablished this dry season at the BHPS to compare movements against recorded rainfall. \n\n\f \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n\nAppendix 2         15 \n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance Targets/Indicators  Monitoring Mechanisms \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n \n \n \n\n \nGoal \n\n\u2022  Avoid severe disruption \n\nto the economic \ndevelopment of \nTajikistan and to the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty \nreduction program \n\n \n \nPurposes  \n \n\u2022  Minimize the occurrence \nand magnitude of the \nlandslide \n\n \n\u2022  Address the effects of a \nlandslide and limit the \nblockage of the Vakhsh \nRiver \n\n \n\u2022  Restore the initial level \nof reliability of power \nand irrigation water \nsupplies \n\n \nOutputs  \n\n\u2022  Enhanced ability to \n\nclear the riverbed \n\nImprovements to slope \nstability  \n\n\u2022  Clearance of the \n\nriverbed \n\nThe preferred long-\nterm solution \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\n \n \n\u2022  Economic growth maintained \n \n\u2022  Poverty reduction program \n\ncontinues \n\n \n \n\u2022  National statistics  \n\n\u2022  Barki Tajik statistics \n\n\u2022  Country and sector \nreview missions \n\nFollowing the implementation of the \nProject by 2003, to avoid/minimize \noccurrence of: \n\n\u2022  Disruption to power output \n\n\u2022  Disruption of irrigation cropping \n\n\u2022  Catastrophic flooding \n\n\u2022  Dam break with widespread \n\ndestruction \n\n\u2022  Disruption of water supply in \nthe downstream areas \n\n\u2022  National power sector \nreports and statistics \n\n\u2022  National power and \n\nagriculture sectors and \nstatistics.

The  landslide  was  reactivated  following  the  earthquake  of  3  March  2002.  This \nearthquake  had  its  epicenter  in  Afghanistan  and  was  measured  there  at  7.4  on  the  Richter \nscale.  Heavy  rain  also  occurred  in  the  Baipaza  area  during  March  and  April  2002,  and  this \nserved to reduce the stability of the slope further. The Baipaza landslide forms part of an area of \nancient  landslides  occupying  the  western  valley  side  of  the  Vakhsh  River,  and  recorded \nreactivated movements at Baipaza have occurred in 1968, 1992, and 2002. The river below has \nbeen  temporarily  blocked  or  partly  blocked  on  all  three  occasions.  The  Baipaza  Hydro  Power \nStation  (BHPS)  is  on  the  Vakhsh  River  approximately  5  km  upstream  of  the  landslide.  The \nMarch  2002  slope  movements  temporarily  blocked  the  river,  thus  disturbing  the  normal \noperation  of  the  BHPS.  Landslide  debris  was  removed  from  the  restricted  river  channel  by \nblasting, but the channel remains narrow and further landslide movements will create operating \nproblems for the power station and in the worst case could submerge it. Together, the Baipaza \nand  the  Nurek  hydropower  stations,  further  upstream,  produce  90%  of  the  total  electricity \nproduction in Tajikistan. Furthermore, blockage or otherwise restricted flow in the Vakhsh River \nhas  significant  implications  for  water  resources  and  water  abstraction  downstream,  where  an \nestimated  650,000  people  depend  partly  or  fully  on  the  Vakhsh  River  for  water  supply.  The \ndevelopment of a cost-effective and sustainable solution is therefore imperative.  \n \n \nB. \n \n2. \n\nThe feasibility study is divided into three elements. \n\nScope of the Feasibility Study \n\n1. \n\nIdentification of the Preferred Implementation Strategy for Managing the \nBaipaza Landslide/Vakhsh River Problem \n\n \n3. \nThe flow in the Vakhsh River must be maintained at a satisfactory level. The operational \nrequirements of BHPS and the water abstraction facilities downstream are the principal concern. \nFurthermore, the hazard posed by a potential sudden breach of any future blockage needs to be \nconsidered. Barki Tajik has already identified a possible solution consisting of the construction \nof  tunnels  in  the  opposite  bank  of  the  river.  This  solution  has  to  be  studied,  but  a  range  of \noptions  will  be  identified  by  the  feasibility  study  and  these  should  be  assessed  on  geological, \nengineering,  environmental,  and  economic  grounds  to  confirm  the  most  appropriate  course  of \naction. The following activities, inter alia, will be required: \n\n \n\n \n\n(i)  Collect and interpret all existing data, including \n\n(a) \n(b) \n\n(c) \n(d) \n\naerial photographs at 1:30,000 scale flown in 1991; \ntopographical  mapping  of  the  post  March  2002  earthquake  landslide  at \n1:1,000 and 1:2,000; \ngeological mapping of the general area at 1:50,000 scale; \nengineering  geological  and  geomorphological  mapping  outputs  undertaken \nmost notably in 1993 and 2002 and available through the Ministry of Energy; \n\n\f(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(b) \n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n \n\n(ii)  Assure the following fieldwork and surveys are done: \n\n \n\nAppendix 4         19 \n\nground investigation and slope monitoring data collected following the March \n2002 landslide; \nhydrometeorological  analysis  of  the  area,  including  river  discharge  and \nprecipitation data; and \nliaison  with  all  relevant  government  departments  through  the  Ministry  of \nEnergy. \n\nengineering geological/geomorphological mapping of the landslide at 1:1,000 \nscale; \nground  investigation  to  confirm  the  feasibility  and  cost  estimate  of  the \npreferred option; \ninitial  environmental  examination  of  all  options  identified  according  to  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  guidelines  and  in  association  with  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironment, Tajikistan; \ninitial poverty and social assessment in accordance with ADB Guidelines: the \nissues related to involuntary resettlement and indigenous people will be part \nof the assessment; \nadditional topographical mapping required to identify, define and evaluate the \nvarious options (1:10,000 scale mapping already exists for the general area); \nand \nhydrological  study  of  the  Vakhsh  River  regime  in  relation  to  the  options \nidentified. \n\n \n(iii)  Provide  the  following  engineering,  economic,  and  environmental  analysis  of \n\nalternatives: \n(a) \n\ncarry  out  all  analysis  required  to  confirm  feasibility  and  cost  estimate  of \npreferred solution; \nprepare outline design for preferred solution; \nassess the possible means of financing the implementation of the proposed \nsolution; \nprepare the following reports (i) inception report; (ii) monthly progress reports; \n(iii)  report  on  initial  environmental  examination  and  initial  poverty  and  social \nassessment;  (iv) draft final report in English and Russian; (v) final report in \nEnglish  and  Russian;  and  (vi)  scope,  terms  of  reference,  resource/cost \nestimate and implementation schedule for detailed design. \n\n \nLandslide Mapping in the Vakhsh River Valley \n\n2. \n\n \n4. \nCombine field reconnaissance, aerial photograph interpretation, published topographical \nand geological mapping to prepare a landslide map for the Vakhsh valley (both valley sides) at \n1:10,000  from  the  BHPS  for  a  distance  of  approximately  25  km  downstream  as  far  as  the \nSangtudinskaya hydropower station. Prepare a summary assessment of all high hazard slopes \nin this study area and their likely effect on the flow in the Vakhsh River and the operation of the \nBaipaza and Sangtudinskaya hydropower stations. \n\n3. \n\nPreparation for Detailed Design \n\nPrepare terms of reference, program, and resource/cost estimate for detailed design. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n5. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nTeam Composition \n\nC. \n \n6. \nThe consultants will designate a fully qualified engineer to act as the team leader, who \nwill be responsible to the project manager for performance of the consulting services. The team \nleader  will  preferably  have  experience  in  landslide  related  projects  in  this  type  of  terrain.  The \nteam  leader  would  also  be  an  experienced  civil  engineer  and  proficient  in  using  project \nmanagement  software  and  be  highly  computer  literate.  In  addition  to  the  team  leader,  the \nconsultants  will  provide  an  engineering  geologist,  a  geotechnical  engineer,  an  economist,  a \npoverty  and  social  development  specialist,  and  an  environmental  specialist.

The domestic team will be assisted by 4 person-months \nof  foreign  consultancy  during  the  early  stages  of  the  Project.  The  Project,  to  restore  reliable \nwater  flows  in  the  Vakhsh  River,  comprises  two  components:  (i)  slope  stabilization  measures, \nand,  (ii)  disaster  preparedness  measures.  The  latter  comprises  principally  the  procurement  of \ntools  and  equipment.  The  consultants  will  be  responsible  for  surveys,  investigations,  detailed \ndesign,  preparation  of  tender  documents,  assistance  during  evaluation  of  bids  and  contract \nnegotiations,  construction  supervision,  quality  control,  and  environmental  monitoring.  The  field \nengineers will be responsible for the day-to-day supervision of various contractors. \n \n2. \nIndividual  consultants  will  be  recruited  by  Barki  Tajik,  the  Implementing  Agency,  in \naccordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. \nThe list of consultants to be engaged is in Table A9. \n \n3. \nWhile it will be up to the Barki Tajik to select the best consultants and counterpart staff to \ncarry out the design and construction supervision, the Baipaza landslide team must be selected \nfrom  candidates  with  the  appropriate  background  and  experience.  The  implementation  of  the \nemergency works will be complex and not without risk and therefore it is essential that project \nstaff  are  fully  committed  to  site  inspection  and  quality  control.  Although  a  breakdown  of \nanticipated quantities that comprise the detailed scope of works was prepared, the works have \nstill  to  be  designed  and  there  remains  some  uncertainty  over  exactly  how  they  will  be \nimplemented.

Notwithstanding  this  program,  all  surveys  and  investigations  are  intended  to \nadvance the design, scheduling, and implementation of emergency works as soon as possible. \nThe  PIU  will  be  in  control  of  the  timing  and  staffing  of  these  activities.  Geological  and \nengineering  personnel  who  are  well  experienced  in  the  studies  carried  out  on  the  Baipaza \nlandslide so far, must be deployed to the maximum extent possible in this Project.  \n \n9. \n \n\nThe following activities are among the most critical to the implementation of the works: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nCarry out a site visit with contractors who will bid for the works. Indicate to them \nwhat is required and discuss practicability, scope and working methods.  \nFinalize  the  locations  of  spoil  areas  and  access  routes.  Carry  out  necessary \nsurvey  and  design  and  prepare  documentation  to  allow  a  contractor  to \ncommence access improvements as soon as possible. \nPrepare a detailed engineering geological/geomorphological map of the landslide \nat  1:1,000  scale  and  plot  cross-sections  to  help  assess  depths  and  extent  of \nmovement.  The  geomorphology  of  the  surrounding  slopes  should  also  be \nmapped  from  existing  stereo  air  photography  in  order  to  place  the  Baipaza \nLandslide  and  the  proposed  emergency  works,  accesses,  drainages  and  spoil \nareas  within  the  context  of  the  surrounding  ancient,  but  still  active,  landsliding. \nTwo person-months have been allowed for all of this, and it is suggested that this \ncomprises  a  two-person  team.  The  process  should  therefore  take  a  month  to \ncomplete.  This  should  be  backed  up  by  limited  drilling  and  trial  pitting  to  help \nconfirm  ground  conditions  for  emergency  design  purposes.  At  the  end  of  this \nexercise the geological team must be in a position to confirm all excavation and \ndrainage details above and on the landslide. This information can then be plotted \nonto  the  topographic  map  to  allow  design  and  layout  drawings  to  be  prepared. \nThis  survey  should  be  carried  out  by  Global  Positioning  System,  taking  care  to \nmap  all  geological  and  geomorphological  features  onto  the  1:1,000  scale  plans \nas  the  survey  progresses.

Landslide \n1. \nmovements  have  blocked  the  river  on  three  occasions  in  the  recent  past  and  on  the  last  two \noccasions  (1992  and  2002)  this  has  given  rise  to  disruption  of  hydro  power  generation  at  the \nBaipaza Hydro Power Station (BHPS) location upstream. In addition, the Vakhsh River is critical \nto  the  supply  of  irrigation  and  potable  water  over  a  large  area  downstream,  covering  three \nregions of Tajikistan and neighboring countries.  \n \n2. \nThe Baipaza landslide is approximately 1.8 kilometers (km) long and 0.8 km wide. The \npurpose  of  the  Project  is  to  reduce  the  risk  posed  by  the  landslide  to  the  flow  of  water  in  the \nVakhsh River, thus enabling more efficient power generation at BHPS and the maintenance of \nflow in the Vakhsh River for the benefit of downstream users. \n \nAn initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken during the appraisal mission \n3. \nin June 2002 and the findings are presented hereafter. The mission visited the Baipaza site and \nheld discussions with Tajik government agencies, local government representatives, Barki Tajik \n(the  state  power  company)  representatives,  and  the  Ministry  of  Environment.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  classified  the  Baipaza  landslide  project  as  environmental  \ncategory B.  \n\n \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nB. \n \n4.  The description of the project is given in paragraphs 14 to 23 of the main text. \n \nC. \n \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Resources \n\n \n5. \nThe  Baipaza  landslide  is  on  the  western  valley  side  of  the  Vakhsh  River,  5  km \ndownstream  of  the  BHPS.  The  Vakhsh  River  is  a  major  tributary  of  the  Pyenj  River  and  is \norientated  approximately  north  to  south.  The  underlying  geology  comprises  limestones,  marls, \ngypsums,  and  clays,  overlain  by  thick  loess  soils  and  colluvium  and  there  is  evidence  that \nwidespread deep-seated landslides have occurred in pre-historic times on the slopes occupied \nby  the  Baipaza  landslide  and  immediately  to  the  north.  The  area  is  seismically  highly  active.  \nA  large  earthquake  with  an  epicenter  in  neighboring  Afghanistan  triggered  the  failure  of  the \nslope in March 2002.  \n \nThe  climate  is  Continental,  characterized  by  cold  winters  and  warm-hot  summers.  The \n6. \nwet  season  is  between  November  and  April  and  average  annual  rainfall  is  about  600\u2013800 \nmillimeters, though there are no raingauges within 10 km of the site. \n \n7. \nNumerous tracks in the area once provided access for farm tractors. \n \n \n \n8. \nTajikistan  is  a  center  of  biological  diversity.  However,  half  a  century  of  resource \ndepletion and exploitation focusing on hydropower and cotton has resulted in drastic alteration \nof  habitats,  and  large  losses  in  terrestrial  and  aquatic  biodiversity.  The  Tiger  Bulk  Reserve  is \n\nThe  Baipaza  landslide  site  is  accessed  only  via  tracks  from  the  north  and  west. \n\nEcological Resources \n\n2. \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n3. \n\nHuman and Economic Development  \n\nsome  distance  downstream  of  Baipaza  and  is  dependent  on  the  flow  of  water  in  the  Vakhsh \nRiver. Discussions with the Ministry of Environment did not identify any known issues or fragile \necologies that might be at risk from the implementation of emergency works at Baipaza. There \nare no forest areas likely to be affected by the proposed emergency works. \n \n \n \n9. \nThe immediate area was evacuated in the 1940s when a landslide on an adjacent slope \nresulted  in  two  fatalities.  Since  then  some  villagers  have  returned  to  the  area,  but  none  have \nrelocated in the immediate area of the Baipaza landslide.  \n \n10. \nGenerally, the upper valley side slopes are gently undulating while the middle and lower \nslopes  are  steeply  inclined.  This  pattern  is  most  pronounced  on  the  slopes  occupied  by  the \nlandslide and the area to the south of it. The upper slopes are well drained and suitable for the \ncultivation  of  wheat.  In  fact,  local  accounts  suggest  that  the  area  was  an  important  wheat \ngrowing  area  in  previous  years.  Presently,  most  of  the  cultivable  land  is  dedicated  to  hay  and \nfodder for cattle.  \n \n11.  Most of the area around the Baipaza landslide is covered with grass. The landscape is \nwithout trees.  A  water  supply  pipe  was  previously  operational  along  the  ridge  top  above  the \nBaipaza landslide, but is no longer functional  and has been vandalized. \n \n12. \nThe  only  industry  evident  in  the  area  is  the  salt  extraction  and  processing  plant  to  the \nnorthwest. This plant extracted brine from deep groundwater for processing but now appears to \nbe not functioning. \n \n \n \n13. \n \nD. \n\nVery few people live within the vicinity of the landslide. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \nThe \n\nthe  environmental  screening \nin  Table  A10  summarizes \n14. \nundertaken.

They  have  also  agreed,  and  provision  has  been  made, \nfor staff of the Ministry of Environment to be involved as advisers and observers in the design \nand implementation of the works and the monitoring of any environmental effects. \n \nE. \n \n16. \nThe  contractor  will  need  to  establish  an  operational  safety  plan,  and  to  demonstrate \ncompliance  with  international  safety  standards  required  for  the  operation  of  a  potentially \nhazardous site. In addition, MOE will report on a regular basis on environmental management \nand implementation of the mitigating measures in the spoil area and the slope protection. \n \n17. \nConsidering the urgency of processing the emergency loan Project, it is recommended \nthat  this  report  will  suffice  as  both  the  IEE  and  summary  IEE  report.  All  potential  impacts \nidentified  can  be  avoided/mitigated  by  design  and  by  construction  planning  and  supervision. \nFurther confirmation of the environmental condition at the site can be undertaken by staff of the \nMinistry of Environment. \n \n18. \nThe  findings  indicate  that  the  negative  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  can  be \nmitigated  to  an  acceptable  level.  Hence  it  is  recommended  that  the  project  be  classified  as \nenvironmental  category  B,  which  does  not  require  a \nimpact \nassessment. \n \n19. \nNo negative impact will persist during operation phase. Moreover, positive impacts can \nbe envisaged through the restoration of water flow in the Vakhsh River and potentially through a \nlonger term decrease in suspended solids and sediments.  \n \n20. \n \nF. \n \n21. \nAs the adverse environmental consequences resulting from the Project can be mitigated \nto  an  acceptable  level,  and  the  other  technical  alternatives  to  address  the  objectives  are \napparently feasible, this IEE and summary SIEE report is recommended to be sufficient. Further \nenvironmental impact assessment is not required. \n \n22. \ndispositions will be and have been taken for mitigating the adverse impacts. \n \n23. \nA  program  should  be  established  under  the  Project,  to  address  the  environmental \nawareness,  mitigation,  monitoring,  and  financing  issues  in  a  manner  acceptable  for  an \nemergency project. \n \n\nAn  environmental  monitoring  plan  should  however  be  established  to  ensure  that  all \n\nThe Project will not involve resettlement or land acquisition. \n\nfull-scale  environmental \n\nConclusions \n\n\fAppendix 11        35 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty analysis? \nYes, the socioeconomic development of the country is dependent on power. \nFurthermore, the Baipaza/Vakhsh River problem has wide implications for \nrural livelihoods. Also, power is a source of heating in the severe winter. \n\nNote: The potential benefits of the Baipaza landslide project are not confined \nto the energy sector as the maintenance of water supply in the Vakhsh River \nhas significant implications in the rural sector.  \n \n\nSector identified as a \nnational priority in country \npoverty partnership \nagreement? \nNot specifically. \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector: To reduce poverty in Tajikistan. \nThe provision of electricity to urban and rural societies improves standards of living and economic \nexpectation. \nIndirectly, the project will assist the rural poor by helping to identify long-term options for safeguarding the \nsupply of irrigation and potable water downstream. \n \n \nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis                                                                        Proposed Classification: Other \n\nAnalysis: \nThe Project concerns the restoration of reliable water flow of the Vaskhsh River, which is used for power \ngeneration (90% of the total generation of the country), water supply for the Khatlon Region (identified as \na poor region), and for irrigation purposes of nine regions. Out of 6 million of Tajikistan\u2019s population,  \n83% are below the poverty line. A blockage of the river will have catastrophic consequences on  \n(i) the supply of electricity (import of electricity costs more than 10 times the generation costs);  \n(ii) the agriculture, as the Khatlon Region is highly productive in cotton (main resources of foreign \nexchange for the country), and (iii) the water supply. In such circumstances, the poor will not have any \naccess to electricity and water. A lack of irrigation will lead to more unemployment as agriculture \nrepresents (in 2000) around 60% of the total employment in the country.  \nThe Project, by restoring the water flow of the river, will enable power generation to fuller capacity, and \nsecure water supply and irrigation for agricultural needs of this part of Tajikistan. \n \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nStakeholder analysis prepared:   \n\nParticipation strategy : \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nPotential Issues \n\n \nD. \n\n \nSubject \n\nResettlement \nGender \nAffordability \nLabor \nIndigenous  \nPeople \nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n\n \n\nNone \nNone \nNone \nNone \nNone \n\nNone \n\nSignificant,  \nNot Significant, \nUncertain, None \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nOutput Prepared \n\nNone \nNone \nNone \nNone \nNone \n\nNone \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 25 June 2002) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "Somoni (TJS) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n \n", "TJS1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.357  \nTJS2.80 \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nBHPS \nIEE \nMOE \nNHPS \nPIU \nTADAZ \n", "Asian Development Bank \nBaipaza Hydro Power Station \ninitial environmental examination \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Ministry of Energy \n\u2013  Nurek Hydropower Station \nproject implementation unit \n\u2013 \nTajik Aluminum Smelter \n\u2013 \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", " \nkV \nMW (megawatt) \nMWh (megawatt-hour) \nGWh (gigawatt-hour) \nkm \nm3  \nmm \nha \nt \n \n \n", " \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n \n", " \nkilovolt \n1,000 kW \n1,000 kWh \n1,000,000 kWh \nkilometer \ncubic meter \nmillimeter \nhectare \nton (metric) \n \n \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government ends on 31 December \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "CONTENTS \n \n", "LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY \n", "Map  \n", "I. \n", "II. \n", "III. \n", "IV. \n \n \n \n", "V. \n", "VI. \n", "THE PROPOSAL \n", "RATIONALE \nA. \nB. \n", "Performance Indicators and Analysis \nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n", "THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA. \nB. \nC. \nD. \nE. \nF. \nG. \n", "Objectives \nComponents and Outputs \nSpecial Features \nCost Estimates \nFinancing Plan \nImplementation Arrangements \nThe Executing Agency and the Implementing Agency \n", "PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA. \nB. \nC. \n", "Benefits \nSocial, Environmental and Econonic Impacts \nRisks \n", "ASSURANCES \n", "RECOMMENDATION \n", "The Baipaza Landslide \nProject Framework \nDetailed Scope of the Project \nTerms of Reference for the Feasibility Study Consultant \nDetailed Cost Estimates for Emergency Measures \nOrganization Chart for Project Implementation Unit \nImplementation Schedule \nIndicative Procurement Packaging \nOutline Terms of Reference for Project Implementation Consulting Services \nSummary Initial Environmental Examination \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n", "APPENDIXES \n1 \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \n8. \n9. \n10. \n11. \n \n", " \n \n", "Page \n \n", "ii \n", " \n", "1 \n", "1 \n1 \n1 \n", "4 \n4 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n7 \n8 \n       10 \n", "11 \n11 \n       11 \n       12 \n", "13 \n", "13 \n", " \n14 \n15 \n17 \n18 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n29 \n35 \n"]}
