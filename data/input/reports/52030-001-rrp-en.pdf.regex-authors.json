THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased grant to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Strengthening Macroeconomic Resilience Program. \n \n2.  The program aims to strengthen Tonga\u2019s macroeconomic resilience, including to mitigate \nthe impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) through supporting government\u2019s response. The \nprogram seeks to achieve this through: (i) addressing sources of immediate and structural fiscal \nand public financial management (PFM) risks; and (ii) improving public sector and national human \nresource management to both limit the immediate labor market impact of COVID-19 and to \nencourage long-term growth. The program builds on reforms supported in prior programs in \nTonga since 2009.1 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE  \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n3.  Development context. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tonga faced challenges \nto macroeconomic resilience because of the country\u2019s geographic disadvantages and exposure \nto shocks. Small and remote islands face elevated costs, which limit their competitiveness and \ninstitutional capacity. Private sector jobs are limited as local business activity is constrained by \nhigh costs of doing business, geographic remoteness, and vulnerability. Although overseas \nworkers provide remitted income, sending such workers abroad limits public and private sector \ncapacity and keeps the production base narrow and informal.2 Legislative and cultural barriers \nlimit women\u2019s labor participation and economic empowerment.  \n \n4.  Economic performance and outlook. Cyclone Gita in February 2018 reduced gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth to 0.2% in fiscal year (FY) 2018, with a muted recovery of 0.7% \nin FY2019 supported by reconstruction, remittances, and marine exports. In February 2020 (prior \nto COVID-19 in the Pacific), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that Tonga\u2019s GDP \nwould grow by 3.5% in both FY2020 and FY2021 (footnote 2). In April 2020, following the COVID-\n19-related lockdowns within Tonga and its trading partners, the IMF revised its forecasts for GDP \nto fall by 1.0% in FY2020 and a further 1.5% in FY2021.3 This economic outlook is subject to a \nhigh degree of uncertainty, with the key risk factors being Tonga remaining COVID-free, the length \nof travel bans, and the economic recoveries of key trading partners. For example, if travel bans \nextend until December 2020 and remittances dwindle, GDP is estimated to contract by as much \nas 17% in the calendar year, with the current account rapidly deteriorating and foreign exchange \nreserves coming under pressure.4 \n \n \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.

Although Tonga was free of the virus as of 3 June 2020, \nCOVID-19 has exposed Tonga\u2019s economic reliance on foreign-sourced income. The three primary \ntransmission channels that impact economic growth are remittance flows, tourism receipts, and \ndisruptions  of  domestic  construction  activity.  Around  20%  of  average  household  incomes, \nincluding those of the poorer deciles, are directly tied to remitted income (estimated at 29.3% of \nGDP in FY2018). Any reduction in remittances stemming from travel restrictions or recessions in \nsource  markets  could  unwind  recent  development  gains  and  deepen  the  poverty  gap.5  \nThe collapse in tourism, equivalent to an estimated 9.1% of GDP in FY2018, will add to these \nlosses for as long as travel restrictions are in place, jeopardizing the incomes of around one-third \nof households. Lastly, reconstruction activity was expected to support growth and employment in \nFY2020 onwards, but this will be hampered by difficulties in cross-border mobilization.  \n \n6.  Past fiscal performance. Tonga\u2019s fiscal stance has generally been prudent, and tax \nreforms have produced good results. Fiscal surpluses since FY2017 have replenished cash \nreserves,  easing  cash  pressures  that  had  previously  disrupted  service  delivery  (Table  1).  \nTax policy reforms\u2014including increased excises and duties on fuel and \u201csin\u201d products\u2014and \nimproved tax administration helped raise the tax-to-GDP ratio from 15.9% in FY2012 to 22.1% by \nFY2018. Expenditure increased in FY2019 due to cyclone recovery-related efforts.  \n \nTable 1: Fiscal Framework, FY2017\u2013FY2021 \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise indicated) \nItem   FY2017    FY2018    FY2019e    FY2020p    FY2021p   FY2022p \nTotal revenue and grants  43.6  42.8  43.6  34.8  37.5  42.0 \n  Total revenue  24.2  24.9  24.5  22.3  22.5  24.7 \n       of which: tax revenue  21.2  22.1  19.1  12.5  15.0  17.3 \n  Grants   19.5    17.9    19.1    12.5    15.0    17.3  \nTotal expenditure   40.0    39.9    40.3    40.4    38.7    40.4  \n  Current expenditure   29.6    31.5    31.6    36.8    34.0    31.1  \n       of which: wages and salaries   12.8    11.9    11.2    12.2    12.2    11.4  \n       Capital expenditure   10.4    8.4    8.6    3.5    4.7    9.3  \nOverall balance, including grants   3.6    2.9    3.3    (5.5)   (1.2)   1.6  \nOverall balance, excluding grants   (15.9)   (15.0)   (15.8)   (18.0)   (16.2)   (15.7) \nExternal debt   39.1    36.8    34.1    34.7    32.9    29.4  \nGDP ($ million, current prices)   455.9    483.7    494.4    496.7    500.4    531.6  \n( ) = negative, e = estimates, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, p = projection. \nNotes:  \n1.

The IMF estimates that Tonga requires \nannual fiscal surpluses of around 4% of GDP to ensure long-term debt sustainability, suggesting \na need for further fiscal consolidation.6 \n \n8.

COVID-19 is expected to impact fiscal \nbalances negatively through falls in tax revenues and demand for increased current expenditure. \nThe government has prepared a COVID-19 economic and social stimulus package of $26.1 \nmillion  (5.2%  of GDP) to  be  implemented  through  FY2020  and  FY2021,  with  $9.8 million \ndedicated  to  health  preparedness  and response.7 Most  of  the  package  is  expected  to  be \nsupported through development partner grants ($20.3 million), with the remainder to come from \nbudget reallocations ($4.2 million) and government reserves. A fiscal deficit equivalent to 5.5% of \nGDP is now expected in FY2020 and 1.2% of GDP in FY2021 (footnote 3). COVID-19-related \nspending of $7.4 million in FY2020 has been funded by budget reallocations and a new domestic \nbond. The government intends to avoid using external debt to meet expected financing gaps. \nAssuming no new borrowing, external debt is expected to continue to fall to 29.4% of GDP by \n2022, although a second and subsequent fiscal stimulus will likely be needed in the coming fiscal \nyear due to the severity of the economic downturn. With COVID-19 likely to reduce tax revenue \ndramatically in the short term, maximizing the efficiency of tax and customs administration is \ncrucial to the recovery of fiscal balances. \n \n9.  Public financial management. While Tonga\u2019s PFM systems are generally functional and \nsupport basic service delivery, challenges remain.8 Annual budget allocations are aligned with the \npriorities established in the Tonga Strategic Development Framework (TSDF) 2015\u20132025 and \nsupport programs as specified in ministry corporate plans.9 The Public Finance Management Act \n(2002) provides a robust, comprehensive framework for effective fiscal management. Steady \nimprovements in public sector management have made Tonga one of the best performing Pacific \ncountries,  although  challenges  remain  in  the  areas  of  public  asset  management,  tax \nadministration, and transparency and accountability.10  \n \n10.  The government\u2019s public fixed-asset registry is incomplete and outdated, leading to audit \nqualifications.11 This makes it difficult to determine the value of government assets in financial \nstatements and to plan adequately for required asset replacement or repair, reducing asset \neffectiveness, service delivery, and asset life. Further, poor cash management has resulted in \nepisodes of cash shortfalls leading to cash rationing and the use of expensive short-term financing \ninstruments, as highlighted in the PFM Reform Roadmap 2015\u20132019 and Medium-Term Debt \nStrategy FY2016\u2013FY2018. Although these issues have been avoided with recent operating \nsurpluses, excess reserves can carry a high opportunity cost for government balances, and the \nrisk posed by COVID-19 may create additional demands on cash holdings. Looking forward, there \nis limited capacity to articulate and implement new reforms. As a diagnostic of the PFM system \nhas  not  been  updated  since  the  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  (PEFA) \nassessment in 2010, there is a risk of ad hoc PFM reforms and a lack of strategic planning. In this \ncontext, prioritization and proper sequencing of strategies and plans are crucial to facilitate the \nimplementation of reforms, even with limited government capacity. \n \n \n7  See the Summary of Government COVID-19 Response Measures in Tonga (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n8  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n9  Government of Tonga, Ministry of Finance and National Planning. 2015.

Weak productivity in the \npublic sector continues to hamper institutional capacities for basic service delivery and reform. \nLingering horizontal inequities in the remuneration system and poor performance management \ngave way to pay increase settlements in FY2014 and FY2016. In 2017, the authorities introduced \na  reform  program  for  the  public  sector  remuneration  system  and  a  linked  performance \nmanagement system (PMS) as crucial way of maintaining a competent and affordable civil service. \nThe IMF notes that, although fiscal anchors on the wage bill remain appropriate, further reform \nshould prioritize (i) rationalizing civil service functions and clarifying job descriptions, (ii) identifying \nand  staffing  critical  positions,  (iii)  increasing  automation  toward  a  phased  elimination  of \nredundancies, (iv) prioritizing service delivery, and (v) gradually aligning compensation with \nmarket pay levels while eliminating overtime to improve work incentives and reduce turnover. A \n2018 ADB evaluation recognized the need to improve job descriptions to support job-sizing, and \nto update the classification of positions (COP) to support the PMS.12 \n \n12.  Labor market risks. The shock to the domestic economy from COVID-19 risks the \nlivelihoods of 43% of salaried workers in private sector employment. Moreover, previous short-\nterm losses in employment due to business closures have had long-term structural impacts on \nthe private sector, for example, following the recessions of FY2006 and FY2007.13 Beyond the \nlimited private sector, Tongans have increasingly looked to overseas employment. Tonga is \namong the main beneficiaries of seasonal worker schemes in both Australia and New Zealand, \nwith an estimated 5,774 workers (14.2% of the total domestic workforce in 2016) engaged in \ntemporary  worker  programs  in  FY2019,  and  a  diaspora  of  33,667  across  both  countries.  \nCOVID-19 travel restrictions will limit seasonal worker schemes in late FY2020 and FY2021, and \nremittances from the broader diaspora are also likely to fall. There is no precedent for such a \nsynchronized slowdown in Tongan sources of remitted income.  \n \n13.  While recovery will depend on the trajectories of major remittance and tourism markets, \nimproved frameworks for labor mobility and diversified skills training will position Tonga to take \nadvantage of future labor opportunities. Although women remain underrepresented and generally \nhave poorer labor outcomes in Tonga than men, employment programs in Australia and New \nZealand offer important opportunities for greater inclusiveness and higher incomes.14 Yet, the \ninstitutional and regulatory frameworks to manage Tonga\u2019s participation in labor mobility schemes \nremain underdeveloped and uneven, with current institutions not well directed toward emerging \nopportunities. Formal technical and vocational education and training (TVET) is provided by a \nwide variety of providers in public, church, and private institutions, but the sector lacks an \noverarching mechanism to design and coordinate the program. The demand side\u2014for both the \ndomestic and overseas labor markets\u2014is generally underrepresented in sector planning and \nmanagement, limiting the effectiveness of current training programs. \n \n \n12 ADB. 2018.

Continuing Reform to Promote Growth Update of the Private Sector Assessment for Tonga. Manila. \n14 According to the 2016 Census of Population and Housing, women have a lower participation rate than men (56.7% \nversus 71.2%), lower employment rate (28.4% versus 45.2%), and higher unemployment rate (26.8% versus 7.6%). \nThe 2017 World Bank Pacific Possible report documents that Tongan seasonal workers earned more than five times \nwhat they would have earned had they stayed in Tonga, and that their households had substantially higher per-capita \nsavings and expenditure, and higher rates of school enrollment and attendance. In FY2016, only 11.5% of Tongan \nseasonal workers were women. While these schemes initially concentrated on horticulture and viticulture, new \nsectors such as accommodation, tourism, and aged care have since been included in Australia\u2019s Seasonal Workers\u2019 \nProgram in certain locations, creating additional employment opportunities for women. \n ", "5 \n \n14.  ADB  contributions.  Since  2009,  ADB  has  engaged  with  the  government  and \ndevelopment partners in supporting policy reforms under the joint policy reform matrix (JPRM) \nthrough technical assistance (TA) and three earlier ADB operations (footnote 1).15 Earlier policy-\nbased  operations  backed  the  government\u2019s  tax  mobilization  measures,  which  led  to  rapid \ndomestic revenue growth through the revised Revenue Services Administration Bill.16 Reforms \nhave also addressed civil service performance management, introduced a new debt management \nlaw  and  medium-term  fiscal  targets,  implemented  a  procurement  tracking  database,  and \nsupported better procedures to address audit recommendations. Advisory services provided by \nADB helped the government strengthen corporate governance practices, commercialize select \nstate-owned enterprises, and approve a foreign investment bill.17 ADB also supported a review of \npublic service reforms in 2018, which recommended including standardized job descriptions and \na revised COP (footnote 12). Regarding the COVID-19 response, ADB disbursed a $470,000 \ngrant from the Asia Pacific Disaster Resilience Fund to strengthen the Ministry of Health\u2019s ability \nto contain and control the virus, and a $6 million grant from the Pacific Disaster Resilience \nProgram (Phase 2).18 The ongoing JPRM policy dialogue was broadened to engage on the \nCOVID-19 response, and the ADB stands ready with a possible COVID-19 Pandemic Response \nOption should this be requested by the Government of Tonga. \n \n15.  Lessons learned. This program reflects lessons from previous policy-based operations, \nincluding:  (i)  budget  support can  achieve results  if there  is  strong  government  ownership;  \n(ii) coordination with development partners is critical, especially in sectors where ADB has limited \nengagement; (iii) TA, provided parallel to budget support programs, aids the implementation of \nreform; (iv) flexibility helps ensure that policy actions remain relevant; and (v) limiting reforms to \na few substantive actions and sequencing implementation avoids overloading national capacity.19 \nThe  program  supporting  the  government\u2019s  rapid  response  to  the  COVID-19  outbreak  and \nassociated economic impacts exemplifies adaptation to local conditions and priorities. \n \n16.  Alignment  of  the  program.  This  program  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030 \npriorities for small island developing states, namely, strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity.20 The program is included in the Country Operations Business Plan for 11 Small Pacific \nIsland Countries and it aligns with the ADB Pacific Approach.21 The program also aligns with the \nfollowing  impacts  of  the  TSDF  2015\u20132025:  (i)  more  inclusive  and  sustainable  growth  and \ndevelopment; (ii) a more inclusive, sustainable, and dynamic knowledge-based economy; and (iii) \nmore  responsive  good  governance  (footnote  9).  The  emergence  of  COVID-19  pivoted \ngovernment policy priorities towards mitigating the short- and long-term impacts of COVID-19, \nand specific COVID-response policy actions within the program are consistent with the ADB\u2019s \nComprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.22 This is achieved by supporting the \n \n15 The FY2020 JPRM (implemented July 2019 - April 2020) is listed in the Supplementary Documents in Appendix 2.  \n16 The revised Revenue Services Administration bill was submitted to and approved by Parliament in 2019. However, \nthe King\u2019s Privy Council subsequently requested amendments to the bill before the King would provide royal assent. \nThe revised bill has been approved by the cabinet and is expected to be resubmitted to Parliament in 2020. \n17 ADB. 2019.

Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n17.  Government  strategy. Tonga  has  adopted  a vision  for  \u201ca  more  progressive Tonga \nsupporting a higher quality of life for all,\u201d following the TSDF 2015\u20132025 (footnote 9). This vision \nis translated into five pillars, of which \u201ceconomic institutions\u201d seeks to address constraints to more \ninclusive, sustainable, and resilient economic growth, including through improved macroeconomic \nmanagement and increased access to economic opportunities. The government moved rapidly to \nmitigate  the  macroeconomic  and  social  risks  posed  by  the  possible  spread  of  COVID-19, \nimplementing a full lockdown of the border. The government\u2019s COVID-19 economic and social \nstimulus package, in part, seeks to sustain the country\u2019s productive sectors and employment. \n \n18.  Partner coordination. Since 2011, the JPRM process has provided an effective platform \nto coordinate support among the key development partners, including for the government\u2019s \nCOVID-19 response. The process brings together key ministries and development partners to \nmap out critical constraints, design policy and TA measures, monitor reform implementation, and \nmobilize financial assistance to support the government.23 ADB, the World Bank, Australia, and \nNew Zealand coordinate budget support and related TA through the JPRM process, with the IMF\u2019s \nPacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre and European Union also participating.24 JPRM \npartners coordinate activities and mutually reinforce policy actions across all of the areas of the \nJPRM, including those in the proposed ADB program. To mount an immediate COVID-19 \nresponse, ADB has been coordinating with the Joint Incident Management Team, led by the World \nHealth Organization Pacific office, along with other humanitarian and development partners.  \n \n19.  Program  description.  This  program  aims  to  strengthen  Tonga\u2019s  macroeconomic \nresilience, including to mitigate the impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) through supporting \ngovernment\u2019s COVID-19 response. The program seeks to achieve this through: (i) addressing \nsources of immediate and structural fiscal and PFM risks, and (ii) improving public sector and \nnational human resource management to both limit the immediate labor market impact of COVID-\n19 and to encourage long-term growth. The program has completed 11 prior actions under two \nreform areas. A post-program monitoring framework promoting continued reform efforts towards \nthe JPRM\u2019s medium-term objectives, was agreed with government. It will guide continued policy \ndialogue, and coordinate TA to further program objectives beyond its completion date. Framework \nimplementation will be supported by coordinated TA from all partners, while progress within the \nframework will be closely monitored and guide the development of future policy-based operations.  \n \n20.  Reform Area 1: Sources of fiscal and PFM risk reduced. In the immediate term, this \narea addresses the economic and fiscal risks of the COVID-19 pandemic by mobilizing the \ngovernment\u2019s response. In the longer term, the policy actions focus on mitigating other sources \nof fiscal risk through improving the capacity, quality, efficiency, and accountability of Tonga\u2019s \npublic financial system and practices. \n  \n21.  Fiscally responsible COVID-19 response. As a prior action, the government approved \nthe $26.1 million COVID-19 economic and social stimulus package (equivalent to 5.2% of GDP) \nto mitigate the economic and social damage caused by the virus and its associated control efforts. \n \n23 The JPRM, FY2019\u2013FY2020 forms the basis for reforms supported under the program. The policy matrix and post \nprogram monitoring framework supports a subset of broader JPRM reforms and can be found in Appendix 4. \n24 The European Union coordinates TA and policy dialogue through the JPRM process, but not its budget support.  \n ", "7 \n \nThe government has ensured that this will be done in a fiscally sustainable manner\u2014the package \nis funded through government reserves ($1.7 million), the reallocation of existing government \nprograms ($4.2 million), and grant financing ($20.3 million). This ensures that the government will \nlimit debt financing and maintain prudent reserves to meet operational needs, consistent with the \ndebt strategy supported under the previous ADB program and the cash management policy \nsupported under the current program. The package also mitigates key fiscal risks posed in the \nhealth sector by dedicating an additional $9.8 million to assist with preparedness and protection, \nmedical supplies, and the COVID-19 pandemic plan.  \n \n22.  PFM assessment. As a prior action, the cabinet approved and published the PEFA Agile \nand gender responsive budgeting assessments in partnership with the IMF to identify priorities in \nfuture PFM reform planning. This will determine future PFM reform actions under the post-\nprogram monitoring framework.25 \n \n23.  Tax  administration.  As  a  prior  action,  the  cabinet  approved  amendments  to  the \nregulations to operationalize the relevant sections of the Revenue Services Administration Bill \nsupported under the previous ADB program once it receives royal assent.26 The act obliged \ntaxpayers to apply for a tax identification number, and the regulatory amendments provide greater \nclarity concerning the documentary evidence required for tax identification number applications. \nThe regulations encourage compliance by modernizing the tax clearance certificate procedures \nand Tax Tribunal provisions, reducing the administrative burden, and increasing transparency. \n \n24.  Financial management of government assets and liabilities. As a prior action, the \ncabinet approved a systematic framework and policy for the recording and reporting of public fixed \nassets to help improve the life-cycle management and resilience of public infrastructure through \naccurate  financial  reporting.  The  policy  outlines  the  fixed  asset  reporting  framework  and \nresponsibilities for determining asset strategy; performance evaluation; registration and reporting; \nacquisition, management, and disposal; and facilitates the management of capital goods and links \ncapital and medium-term maintenance spending. Improving the government\u2019s asset management \nwill reduce life-cycle costs, boost the sustainability of these assets (including resistance to impacts \nfrom changing climactic conditions), and ensure continuous service delivery. \n \n25.  Cash management. As a prior action, the cabinet established a liquidity buffer target \nband.27 The policy supports better coordination of cash management-related activities (including \nwith the National Reserve Bank) and preparation of operational procedures for when operating \nbalances are outside of the defined target band. This will mitigate the risks posed by previous \ncash management practices and ensure that balances are not allowed to sit idle. \n \n26.  Strengthening anticorruption. As a prior action, the government confirmed that it has \nfully acceded to the United Nations\u2019 Convention Against Corruption, and that the rules surrounding \nanticorruption efforts are now legally binding. This will further enable oversight institutions to \n \n25 Areas identified in the gender responsive budgeting assessment include the need for gender responsive budgeting \ntraining for ministries and the collection of sex-disaggregated data in ministry annual reporting.  \n26 Penalties related to tax administration (i.e., registration, late lodgment and payment, false or misleading statements, \nand dishonored checks) and tax offences (i.e., failure to maintain proper records, fraud, and obstruction) are clearly \ndefined, and graduated penalties (i.e., where the penalty increases, depending on the severity and/or length of time \nof the infraction) have been introduced for several offences to encourage compliance. \n27 The band is set at 1\u20132 months of recurrent expenditure to balance the need to mitigate insolvency risk with the cost \nof holding excessive cash reserves. The Ministry of Finance analysis of historical cashflow volatility indicates that \nthis lower bound would be adequate to meet unexpected cash needs, with a 99% confidence interval. \n ", "8 \nexecute their legal function.28 The convention covers five main areas to combat corrupt practices: \npreventive  measures,  criminalization  and  law  enforcement,  international  cooperation,  asset \nrecovery, and TA and information exchange. Strengthened anticorruption efforts will enhance \noversight functions within the government and build confidence in both crisis response measures \nand overall governance. \n \n27.  Reform Area 2: National human resource support and management improved. \nThis reform area aims to mitigate the immediate labor market impacts of the COVID-19 crisis by \nproviding  short-term  employment  support  and  supplementing  the  incomes  of  vulnerable \nhouseholds reliant on informal employment. It also targets a longer-term economic recovery from \nCOVID-19 through improvements in public service management, structured access to labor \nmigration (particularly for women), and skills accumulation. \n  \n28.  Short-term support for employment. As a prior action, the government has put in place \na $9.8 million economic support scheme that (a) subsidizes employers to retain staff, including in \nthe informal sector, thereby limiting the long-term structural damage to the domestic private sector \nand employment outcomes;29 and (b) provides employment subsidies for those who have lost \ntheir jobs due to the economic impacts of the pandemic. The first round of employment support \nis a T$535 payment to eligible individuals who apply to the government for assistance. Second \nand subsequent rounds will be considered subject to budget constraints and access to finance. \n \n29.  Supporting the income of vulnerable groups. As a prior action, to support the needs of \nthe vulnerable and those reliant on informal employment, the government\u2019s COVID-19 package \nincludes (a) one-off cash transfers for vulnerable and poor households (including female-headed \nhouseholds); (b) income-generating activities for women\u2019s groups; and (c) a waiver on local \nconsumption taxes until 30 June 2020 as a cost-of-living subsidy for consumers. The payments \nto  vulnerable  households  include  a  one-off  T$100  payment  and  1-month  advance  for  the \nestimated 4,000 elderly and 1,000 people with disabilities, as well as T$200 each for the estimated \n1,000 households under the poverty line. \n \n30.  Public service management. The government took the following prior actions: (a) the \nadoption of a new public-sector COP that provides clarity on the overall job family structure, \ngroupings and levels, and remuneration; and (b) the adoption of standardized job descriptions to \nsupport the transition toward consistency and job sizing across the public service, along with \nincreased  efficiency  and  transparency  in  performance  evaluations.  Left  unaddressed,  such \nconcerns could undermine confidence in the PMS and threaten the government\u2019s new framework \nfor wage bill management. It will lessen pressures for arbitrary wage increases, contain the overall \nwage bill, and build institutional resilience. \n \n31.  Labor mobility policy. As a prior action, the cabinet has approved a gender-sensitive \nlabor mobility policy framework to balance the positive development impacts of labor mobility \nwhile mitigating the negative social effects (such as \u201cbrain drain\u201d and social disruption). The policy \nprovides guiding principles, a detailed medium-term action plan with associated outputs (for \nFY2020\u2013FY2024), and a proposed institutional framework for the management of low- and semi-\nskilled overseas employment opportunities and migrant workers from Tonga. The labor mobility \npolicy framework also includes gender analysis and commits to measures to support women\u2019s \n \n28 Parliament created a Standing Committee on Anti-Corruption in 2015, established a local chapter of the Global \nOrganization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption, and passed the Anti-Corruption Commissioner Act in 2016. \n29 Of this package, $4.4 million is dedicated to support the tourism sector, which has suffered the twin impacts of a \nCOVID-19-induced slowdown in demand and damage from Cyclone Harold. Consumption taxes on reconstruction \nmaterial and goods that support tourism, agriculture, and fisheries have also been waived.  \n ", "9 \n \nempowerment, including (a) research on the role of women in labor mobility to better understand \nopportunities, barriers, and risks; (b) prioritizing opportunities for women workers; (c) women\u2019s \neconomic empowerment programs, including programs to facilitate the development of women\u2019s \ncollective enterprises; and (d) the inclusion of women\u2019s groups in the governance arrangements. \n \n32.  Technical and vocational education and training. As a prior policy action, the cabinet \napproved a TVET sector strategic policy framework to help diversify employment opportunities \nfor both men and women. The policy aims to (a) enhance the quality and alignment of TVET \nprograms with private sector needs; (b) guide the prioritization of public funding to address \nidentified skills gaps; (c) foster greater participation and equity in TVET programs; (d) better \nintegrate traditional (academic) education and TVET; and (e) enhance the governance structures \nand qualification framework of the TVET sector, including the quality assurance system through \nthe Tonga National Quality and Accreditation Board. This will be an area of ongoing analysis and \nreform. Additionally, strengthening institutions that train, promote, and support labor mobility can \nhelp enhance the capacity of Tongans\u2014especially youths and women\u2014to take full advantage of \nlocal private sector employment opportunities and overseas worker programs once COVID-19 \nrestrictions are lifted. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reforms \n \n33.  This program supports the reduction of adverse social and economic impacts stemming \nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic and builds on previous policy-based operations to strengthen \nTonga\u2019s macroeconomic resilience. Reform area 1 (para. 20) will help the government manage \nand control COVID-19 and its immediate impact on the Tongan economy without jeopardizing \ndebt sustainability, with other policy actions supporting macroeconomic resilience in the future by \naddressing sources of fiscal risk. Reform area 2 (para. 27) guards against the immediate impacts \nof employment losses in the private sector, which have been previously shown to be difficult to \nrecover, as well as supporting vulnerable households. This reform area also supports the recovery \nfrom the COVID-19 crisis by strengthening public service management and expanding the labor \nsupply into semi-skilled opportunities, as measured by the expansion of registered semi-skilled \nworker pools. This will mitigate the impacts of future economic shocks by diversifying sources of \nremitted income and increasing the financial capacity of households. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n34.  Excluding grants, the FY2020 fiscal deficit could reach the equivalent of $89.4 million, \nlargely because an additional $26.1 million is needed to fund the COVID-19 economic and social \nstimulus package (para. 7). The government has requested a grant not exceeding $12.2 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the program.  \nIn light of higher development financing needs due to reduced revenue expectations and the need \nto  fund  the  COVID-19  response,  the  program  amount  was  increased  from  the  originally \nprogrammed $5 million. At the same time, the government wished to progress the program as \nactions were already advanced, and in expectation that any second round of COVID-19 stimulus \nin FY2021 would be in the context of a constrained reform environment and better supported \nthrough  a  COVID-19  Pandemic  Response  Option.  General  budget  support  grants  totaling \n$28.9 million from JPRM partners are planned for FY2020: the World Bank expects to disburse \n$5.5 million, Australia has increased its budget support from $2.6 million to $7.2 million in \nresponse to COVID-19, and New Zealand has increased support from $1.5 million to $4.0 million. \nADB grant proceeds will support development financing needs, excluding ineligible items.30 \n \n30 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n35.  The government\u2019s existing Budget Support Management Committee leads the JPRM \nprocess and oversees the program, with the Ministry of Finance as the executing agency.  \nThe  committee  provides  overall  guidance  and  is  responsible  for  coordinating  program \nimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation. The Ministry of Revenue and Customs, the Public \nService Commission, and the Prime Minister\u2019s Office are also implementing agencies. The JPRM \nprocess will continue to facilitate broad consultations on reform priorities. The government has \nconsulted with the private sector and civil society on individual reform initiatives as needed. \nThe program is expected to be implemented from July 2019 to July 2020. ADB will monitor the \nimplementation of reforms under the post-program monitoring framework. The proceeds of the \npolicy-based  grant  will  be  withdrawn,  upon  effectiveness,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n36.  Governance. Despite capacity limitations, the 2020 PEFA Agile assessment indicated \nthat  Tonga\u2019s  PFM  system  is  generally  functional  and  supports  basic  service  delivery.  \nThe government is able to implement its budget, but there are procurement, accounting, financial \nreporting, and auditing weaknesses (footnote 8). This program, complemented by development \npartner  TA,  addresses  many  of  those  weaknesses.  Tonga  has  taken  steps  to  strengthen \nanticorruption  measures,  including  creating  the  Parliament  Standing  Committee  on  Anti-\nCorruption and acceding to the UN Convention Against Corruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government.  \n \n37.  Poverty and social. The public sector is a key provider of services to low-income \nhouseholds, and reform area 1 will help ensure that the government has the fiscal resources to \nrespond to future economic shocks and disasters (which disproportionately affect the poor) while \nmaintaining critical public services. The COVID-19 economic and social stimulus package targets \nspecific support for household income, particularly among the most vulnerable.31 Reform area 2 \nwill improve public service delivery by contributing to the performance management system for \npublic servants, as well as increasing the access of poor households to overseas employment \nopportunities and the associated remitted income.  \n \n38.  Gender. This program is classified as effective gender mainstreaming and includes four \npolicy actions that directly address key gender gaps in PFM, human resource management, and \nthe economic impacts of COVID-19 on women and girls. Key gender gaps in labor market \noutcomes include lower labor force participation and employment rates for women. This gap is \nparticularly  pronounced  in  the  uptake  of  overseas  labor  opportunities,  where  only  one  in \n10 workers is female. In addition, COVID-19 will have widespread adverse impacts on women\u2019s \nability to earn income in both formal and informal spheres. Proactive gender features include (i) a \ngender-responsive COVID-19 economic stimulus package that includes employment support, \ncash transfers for vulnerable and poor households (including female-headed households), and \nincome-generating  activities  for  women\u2019s  groups;  (ii)  gender-responsive  budgeting  actions. \nincluding  a  PEFA  gender  responsive  budgeting  assessment,  gender  impact  analysis  of \nexpenditure  proposals,  and  budget  allocations  for  gender  initiatives,  including  women\u2019s \nmicrofinance and women\u2019s crisis centers; (iii) the approval of a gender-sensitive labor mobility \npolicy  that  commits  to  women\u2019s  economic  empowerment  programs  and  prioritizes  the \n \n31 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \n \nemployment of women; and (iv) a TVET policy framework that specifically helps women engage \nin nontraditional disciplines. \n \n39.  Safeguards.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  this  program  is \nclassified as category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nProgram activities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms. The prior policy actions have \nbeen assessed and are not expected to result in or lead to involuntary resettlement, or negatively \naffect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n40.  Risks. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in \ndetail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 32 Development  partners  have \ndetermined  that  PFM  systems  can  provide  mostly  reliable  services  for  budget  support.  \nPolicy reforms and TA address the remaining fiduciary risks (para. 36). The integrated benefits \nare expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nThe impacts of the coronavirus  The Asian Development Bank will monitor national, regional, \ndisease pandemic and other  and global economic developments and stand ready for further \npotential shocks far exceed  assistance  in  coordination  with  other  partners,  should  the \nexpectations, undermining economic  economic downturn become more severe than anticipated or \nstability and fiscal sustainability  there are further economic shocks from other sources. \nHigh staff turnover further aggravates  Reforms are prioritized and sequenced to avoid overburdening \ncapacity constraints, affecting reform  the small public administration and decision makers.

ASSURANCES  \n41.  The government and the Ministry of Finance have assured ADB that implementation of \nthe program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the grant agreement. No disbursement shall be made unless ADB is satisfied \nthat government has completed the policy actions specified in the policy matrix of the program.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n42.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based grant would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ngrant not exceeding $12,200,000 to the Kingdom of Tonga, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \n(Asian Development Fund) for the Strengthening Macroeconomic Resilience Program, on terms \nand  conditions  that  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  grant \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n16 June 2020 \n \n32 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nA more inclusive, sustainable, and dynamic knowledge-based economy promoted (Tonga Strategic \nDevelopment Framework, 2015\u20132025)a  \nMore responsive good governance achieved (Tonga Strategic Development Framework, 2015\u20132025)a  \nAdverse social and economic impact by the COVID-19 pandemic reduced.
