The  Project \nspecifically  addresses  the  needs  of  household  members  rather \nthan  of  household  heads  alone,  taking  into  account  women\u2019s \nneeds  in  on-  and  off-farm  livelihood  activities.  The  Project  will \nto  secure \ndevelop  beneficiaries\u2019  capacities  and  capabilities \nalternative \nfrom  diversified  agriculture,  off-farm \nemployment,  microenterprises,  and  improved  access  to  financial \nservices.  The  Project  will  help \nindividuals,  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs),  government,  and  private  sector  to  fulfill \ntheir  tasks  more  effectively.  The  Project  will  be  implemented \nthrough  public-private  partnerships.  Project  preparation  involved \nextensive participation by stakeholders. \n \nSugarcane dominates the Fiji Islands\u2019 agriculture sector: in 2002, \nit  accounted  for  36%  of  agricultural  gross  domestic  product.  For \nmore than 20 years, the sugar industry has benefited from prices \nthat  have  been  as  much  as  triple world  prices  and  has insulated \ngrowers from the need to improve their efficiency and productivity. \nIndications suggest that the price of sugar will move toward world \nprices  in  the  longer  term.  Furthermore,  the  poor  financial \nperformance  of  the  Fiji  Sugar  Corporation  has  exacerbated  the \nsituation,  and  urgent  industry  restructuring  is  needed  to  reverse \nthe  current  situation.  Without  assistance,  many  sugarcane \nfarmers will be unable to adjust. To face the challenge, efficiency \nmust  improve  and  resources  must  be  reallocated  to  new  uses  in \nviable \nlivelihoods  with  minimum  disruption.  This  situation \ncoincides  with  the  expiry  of  some  10,300  government-regulated \nleases over the next 25 years, many of which will not be renewed \nas  landowners  seek  to  enter  farming  themselves,  resulting  in \nhardship  for  experienced  farmers  exiting  farming.  At  the  same \ntime,  incoming  farmers  have  limited  capital  and  experience.  The \nProject seeks to address the need of poor rural people, including \nexiting farmers, to access alternative livelihoods.  \n \nThe goal of the Project is to protect and improve the standard of \n\nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nObjectives \n\n\ffor \n\ninfrastructure \n\nfarm  access \n\nliving of rural people put at risk because of the restructuring of the \nsugar  industry.  The  purpose  of  the  Project  is  to  increase \nsustainable livelihoods, on- and off-farm, to at least replace those \nlost during the course of sugar industry restructuring. To achieve \nthis, the Project seeks to (i) maintain a healthy agriculture sector \nwith  viable  alternatives  to  sugarcane  farming,  (ii)  generate \nsustainable off-farm and self-employment opportunities for people \nexiting  the  sugar  sector  and  for  other  rural  poor,  (iii)  provide \naccess  to  savings  and  credit  services  in  rural  communities  to \nfacilitate  livelihood  activities  and  improve  the  quality  of  life,  and \n(iv)  provide  critical \nrural \ncommunities. \n \nThe  Project  has  four  components:  (i)  promoting  agricultural \ndiversification, strengthening agricultural services, and developing \nin  commercial \neffective  public-private  sector  partnerships \nin  off-farm \nagriculture;  (ii)  encouraging  people \nlivelihoods to create income-generating capacity in rural areas by \nstrengthening  public  and  private  sector  vocational  training  and \nadvisory  capacity;  (iii)  strengthening  rural  financial  services \n(MFIs)  and  promoting \ninstitutions \noffered  by  microfinance \nsustainable  MFIs  in  areas  poorly  served  by  commercial  banks;  \nand (iv) project coordination.  \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  US$49.8  million \nequivalent  inclusive  of  physical  and  price  contingencies,  interest \nduring  construction,  taxes,  and  duties.  It  is  proposed  that  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provide  a  loan  of  US$25  million \nequivalent,  or  50.2%  of  the  estimated  total  project  cost.  The \nGovernment  will  contribute  US$8.7  million  or  17.5%,  the  Fiji \nDevelopment  Bank  will  contribute  US$8.8  million  or  17.7%,  and \nother beneficiaries will contribute the remaining US$7.3 million or \n14.6%. \n\nto  engage \n\n \nSource \n Asian Development Bank \n Government of the Fiji Islands\n Fiji Development Bank \n Beneficiaries \n        Total \n \n \n\n Foreign \nExchange\n10,673 \n  0 \n  0 \n  0 \n10,673 \n\n   Local \nCurrency \n14,328 \n  8,690 \n  8,823 \n  7,262 \n39,104 \n\n  Total \n  Cost \n25,000 \n  8,690 \n  8,823 \n  7,262 \n49,778 \n\n \n(US$ '000)  \nPercent \n \n  50.2 \n  17.5 \n  17.7 \n  14.6 \n100.0 \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of US$25 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility.

To strengthen the implementation capacity within \nMASLR,  a  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  in  Suva,  and  two \ndivisional  project  implementation  units  will  be  established  in \nLautoka  and  Labasa  under  the  Director  Extension  Services  to \nsupport  and  coordinate  project  activities.  The  PCU  shall  also  be \nresponsible for overseeing implementation activities in the six field \noffices  in  the  relevant  sugar  milling  centers.  A  national  steering \ncommittee  will  be  established,  chaired  by  the  chief  executive \nofficer  of  MASLR,  with \nthe \nimplementing agencies; other relevant agencies; and civil society \nrepresentatives, including the private sector. The national steering \ncommittee  will  oversee,  coordinate,  and  monitor  agencies  during \nimplementation and provide policy guidance. MASLR, through the \nPCU, will have overall responsibility for executing the Project. The \nPCU  will  coordinate  closely  with  the  implementing  agencies, \nincluding the Fiji Development Bank, MFIs, NGOs, and the private \nsector.  Two  divisional  steering  committees \nfor  project-level \nsupport  will  be  formed  in  Lautoka  and  Labasa,  respectively,  to \nprovide overall guidance and direction for project implementation \nand to help resolve implementation issues.  \n \nMinistry of Agriculture, Sugar, and Land Resettlement (MASLR) \n \nGoods and services to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB \nloan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. Vehicles, equipment, and materials will be procured \nby \nfrom \nUS$100,000 to US$500,000 equivalent, and contracts exceeding \nUS$500,000 will be procured by international competitive bidding. \nGoods  valued  at  less  than  US$100,000  equivalent  may  be \nprocured  under  direct  purchase.  Civil  works  to  be  financed  from \nthe proceeds of the ADB loan will be procured in accordance with \nlocal  competitive  bidding  procedures  up  to  US$1  million  and  by \ninternational  competitive  bidding  over  US$1  million.  Given  the \nsmall and scattered nature of civil works to be constructed and/or \nrehabilitated under the Project, individual contracts are unlikely to \nattract  international  bidders.  Domestic  contractors  have  the \ncapacity  and  capability  to  undertake  the  required  civil  works \ncontracts. As far as possible, labor-based construction technology \nusing small contracts will be used to provide local employment. \n \nFor  timely  implementation  of  the  Project,  individual  consulting \nservices are required for a number of technical areas.

The  Project  will,  in  addition,  provide  about  46  person-\nmonths  of  international  and  27  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services. The consultants will be selected and engaged \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement \nof domestic consultants. The Government\u2019s attention will be called \nto  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy,  particularly  the  section  on  fraud \nand  corruption,  as  stated  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement, \nGuidelines on the Use  of Consultants, and Guidelines on Money \nLaundering and the Financing of Terrorism. \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  approximately  8,000  sugarcane \nfarmers, as well as a significant number of other rural households. \nThe  Project  has  an  indicative,  overall,  base  case  economic \ninternal rate of return of 19.1%. The core of the quantified benefit \nstream  is  derived  from  the  agricultural  diversification  component. \nAs beneficiaries, the Project targets (i) farmers whose leases are \nstill in effect or have been renewed and incoming farmers; (ii) farm \nlandowners,  by  continuing  commercial  use  of \nland, \ndeveloping  community-based  rural  MFIs,  and  supporting  off-farm \nlivelihoods;  (iii)  exiting  farmers  whose  leases  are  not  renewed, \nwho will be helped by off-farm livelihoods, microenterprises, rural \nfinancial  services,  and  support  in  finding  new  farms;  and  (iv) \nsugarcane cutters and mill workers who lost their jobs, who will be \nhelped  by  off-farm  livelihoods,  microenterprises,  rural  financial \nservices,  and  new  on-farm  employment  in  diversified  and  high-\nvalue agriculture. The inclusive approach and the development of \ninstitutional  capacity  and  processes  will  create  benefits  for  the \npoor  outside  these  target  groups  through  better  service  delivery, \npublic-private  cooperation,  and  strengthened  NGOs  and \ncooperatives. \n \nThe  mixed  success  of  past  ADB-  and  externally-supported \nagriculture projects was due to the limited institutional capacity of \nthe implementing agencies. To address this, the Project includes \ncapacity  building  measures,  and  outputs  are  often  in  the  form  of \nimproved  institutional  effectiveness.  A  strong  PCU  is  envisaged, \nincluding  field  offices,  to  coordinate,  support,  and  monitor  at  a \nlocal level. \n \nThe dominance of sugar, a commodity crop sold to a single buyer \nat  higher-than-world  prices,  has  left  farmers  dependent  on  a \nsingle,  regulated  buyer  and  with  little  incentive  or  capacity  to \ninnovate, market, or manage as needed in diversified, commercial \nfarming  and  off-farm  livelihoods.  Thus,  the  Project  builds  on  the \ntraditional  farm  diversity,  diversification,  and  adoption  experience \nof  innovative  farmers  and  agribusinesses,  providing  technical \nsupport  and  skills  development,  including  an  emphasis  on  farm \nbusiness management services and support to strengthen farmer \ngroups and industry organizations.  \n\n\f \n\nv\n\n \nAdequate land needs to be made available on terms agreeable to \nboth  farmers  and  landowners.  Land  is  communally  owned,  so \nalmost  all  farmers  are  tenants.  Indigenous  Fijian  farmers  usually \nfarm as tenants of a clan (mataqali) rather than as owners, even if \nthey  are  members  of  the  clan.  Positive  trends  are  apparent  in \nlease renewals, even though political disagreement remains about \nthe  legal  form  of  agricultural  leases.  Nevertheless,  the  Native \nLand Trust Board has provided assurance that it will support lease \nrenewals and, where landowners do not wish to renew leases, will \nseek alternative farms. \n \nThe  success  of  the  agriculture  diversification  component  will \ndepend  on  the  industry  organizations\u2019  ability  to  manage  and \nprovide  the  necessary  support  to  farmers  for  a  wider  adoption \nrate,  and  the  mobilization  of  private  sector  participation  and \ninvestment.  The  lack  of  financial  services  and  credit  support  to \nproject participants also poses a risk. \n \nThe  Fiji  Islands\u2019  horticultural  exports  would  be  at  risk  from  the \narrival of a new, foreign fruit fly, but quarantine safeguards are not \nfully  enforced  because  of  budgetary  constraints.  The  Project  will \nstrengthen quarantine services and will require assurance that the \nGovernment will enforce safeguards. \n \nTypical  agricultural  risks  due  to  weather  and  existing  pest  and \ndisease pressures are not expected to affect the Project, because \nfarmers  have  been  working  with  these  conditions  for  many \nthe \ndecades.  Rather,  by  diversifying  agriculture,  avoiding \nundermining of traditional household strategies in relation to food \nsecurity,  and  providing  appropriate  training  opportunities  (e.g.,  in \nintegrated pest management), the risk of drastic impacts on food \nand income from these pressures are expected to be lessened. \n  \nSuccessful  implementation  in  Vanua  Levu  requires  development \nof the port at Savusavu (under separate funding). \n \nTechnical  assistance \nthe \nstrengthening  of  commercial  agriculture  development  to  ensure \nthat  appropriate  policies,  institutions,  and  capacities  are  in  place \nat  project  completion  to  sustain  the  performance  of  the  private \nagriculture  sector.  The  TA  will  strengthen  the  private  sector  so \nthat  it  can  take  the  leading  role  in  developing  and  promoting \nagribusiness.  In  addition  to  developing  the  policy  and  legislative \nenvironment,  the  TA  will  facilitate  the  development  of  self-\nsustaining  industry  organizations  with  a  medium-  to  long-term \nstrategic and entrepreneurial vision that can raise funds, manage \ntheir  operations,  and  provide  effective  services  to  the  farming \ncommunity.  The  TA  will  (i)  help  the  industry  organizations  apply \nfunding criteria to activity proposals; (ii) assist in establishing the \noperations,  linkages,  and  strategic  focus  of  farm  business \n\nis  proposed \n\nto  support \n\n(TA) \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fadvisory services; (iii) assist in orienting trade- and market-related \nlegislation, information, services, protocols, and relationships; (iv) \nfacilitate  institutional  linkages  and  networks  between  the  Fijian \nagriculture sector, private and public organizations, and programs \nactive in the region; (v) support training in agribusiness and agro-\nprocessing;  and  (vi)  raise  potential  local  entrepreneurs\u2019  and \nindustry organizations\u2019 awareness of business opportunities. \n \n\nvi \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n\ni\ni\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Fiji Islands for the Alternative Livelihoods Development Project. The report also describes \nproposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Strengthening  Commercial  Agriculture  Development, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  Fiji  Islands\u2019  rural  economy  is  dominated  by  sugarcane  and  subsistence  farming, \nwhich accounted for 36% and 35%, respectively, of agricultural gross domestic product (GDP) \nin  2002.  However,  these  figures  understate  the  importance  of  sugarcane  production,  a  cash \ncrop that accounts for about 60% of farm incomes, with other cash crops and off-farm income \ncontributing  about  20%  each.  Subsistence  farming,  forestry,  and  livestock  provide  noncash  or \ndelayed  benefits,  but  have  traditionally  provided  farm  households  with  a  range  of  household \nneeds and with resilience to political upheavals, tropical cyclones, and other shocks. \n \n3. \nSugarcane  farms  in  the  project  area  are  small,  averaging  about  4  hectares  (ha).  The \nestimated  annual  gross  margin  of  a  representative  sugarcane  farm  is  F$2,070  (US$1,063)  at \ncurrent  sugarcane  prices  of  F$50  (US$25.70)/metric  ton  (t),  compared  with  the  household \npoverty  threshold  of  F$6,500  (US$3,340)/year.  A  projected  fall  in  sugarcane  prices  to  F$37 \n(US$19)/t  risks  reducing  annual  gross  margins  to  less  than  F$1,000  (US$514).  About  17,000 \nseasonal  sugarcane  cutters  earn  an  average  of  F$900  (US$462)  per  season,  and  these \nincomes  are  at  risk  through  reductions  in  the  sugarcane  area  and  moves  to  mechanical \nharvesting. To protect the already poor groups from further income reductions as a result of the \nrestructuring of the sugar industry, diversified, higher-value farming systems must be promoted \nand  off-farm  livelihood  opportunities  to  supplement  or  replace  agricultural  incomes  must  be \nprovided. \n \n4. \nThe expiry of some 10,300 farms leases over the next 25 years (about 2,800 leases will \nexpire by 2008) will result in experienced farmers leaving  the sugar industry and  new farmers \nentering  with  limited  capital  and  experience.  The  industry\u2019s  dominance  was  boosted  by \npreferential  prices  supported  by  the  European  Union  (EU)  at  up  to  three  times  world  market \nprices. These subsidies have distorted resource use toward sugar and allowed a formerly world-\nclass  industry  to  develop  inefficient  practices  and  standards.  However,  since  1995,  EU \npreferential  prices  have  fallen  from  US$0.30/US  pound  (lb)  to  US$0.20/lb,  and  in  2002,  world \nprices  dropped  from  about  US$0.12/lb  to  US$0.07/lb.  In  addition,  the  efficiency  of  the  Fiji \nIslands\u2019  sugar  sector  has  continued  to  decline  and  its  costs  to  rise.  Overall  farm  and  mill \nperformance  has  decreased  by  26%,  as  reflected  in  the  tons  of  sugar  produced  per  hectare, \nwhich  deteriorated  from  a  1970s  average  of  6.74  t/ha  to  5.89  t/ha  in  the  1990s,  and  has \nworsened to 4.96 t/ha since 2000. Sugarcane yields of about 45 t/ha have stagnated since the \n1970s, and mill recovery fell from 86.3% in the 1970s to 78% in 2002, while mill time efficiency \ndropped  from  94%  in  the  1970s  to  84%  in  2002.  These  figures  reflect  an  overall  and \naccelerating  deterioration  in  farming,  harvesting,  transport,  and  mill  performance  at  a  time  of \nfalling prices, clearly reflected in the Fiji Sugar Corporation\u2019s (FSC's) financial performance. In \nthe early 1990s, the FSC's sugar prices increased by 4% per year, but milling costs increased \nby 9% per year. In the 1980s, the FSC's 30% share of sugar proceeds yielded average profits of \n55%  of  mill  costs,  but  these  fell  to  an  average  loss  of  3%  in  the  late  1990s,  a  loss  of  23%  in \n2000,  and  accelerating  losses  thereafter.  This  situation  is  unsustainable,  requiring  urgent \nrestructuring to reverse past deterioration in mill and farm performance and improve yields. \n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n5. \nIn  addition  to  this  immediate  need  to  restructure  the  sugar  sector,  the  prospective \nchanges  in  the  EU  sugar  regime  reinforce  the  need  for  the  sector  to  become  efficient  and \ncompetitive. The EU countries, principally France and Germany, produce substantial surpluses \nof beet sugar and store or export some 6 million to 7 million t each year. They sell exports at \nworld  prices  depressed  by  oversupply,  but  some  3  million  t  of  EU  sugar  exports  attract  a \nsubsidy  funded  by  levies  on  EU  consumers.  Under  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  ceilings, \nthe  quantity  of  exports  that  the  EU  can  subsidize  is  now  limited  to  a  volume  equal  to  the \npreferential  imports  from  African,  Caribbean,  and  Pacific  (ACP)  countries  plus  1.27  million  t. \nThis  requires  the  EU  to  withdraw  subsidies  from  exports  at  the  expense  of  EU  farmers.  The \nWTO  link  to  ACP  imports  limits  the  EU's  ability  to  reduce  exports  at  the  expense  of  ACP \nimports. However, this and the internal market need to constrain the costs of agricultural policy, \nas agreed to by EU agriculture ministers in Berlin in 1999, mean that the price of EU sugar is \nlikely  to  be  reduced  to  force  reduced  beet  production.  Studies  indicate  that  to  encourage  EU \nfarmers to diversify, prices must fall by about 50%.  \n \n6. \nIn parallel with this probable reduction in prices, the Fiji Islands also faces the risk of a \nloss of EU quotas. Under the Everything But Arms initiative, from 2009 less developed countries \nwill be able to export sugar to the EU without quotas or tariffs. Conservative estimates suggest \nthat these countries will supply 0.9 million to 1.3 million t of sugarcane per year, about the same \nas current ACP supplies. Apart from an annual demand of some 0.3 million t of sugarcane for \nFrench refineries, which French overseas territories supply, the EU's demand for sugarcane is \neffectively limited to the United Kingdom (UK) company Tate & Lyle, which requires 1.4 million t \nof sugarcane per year for its EU refineries. Unless Tate & Lyle invests in increased sugarcane \ncapacity, in an EU market with excess beet sugar capacity, the risk exists that countries under \nthe Everything But Arms agreement will meet the entire demand for sugarcane in the EU, and \nthere  will  be  no  or  minimal  quotas  for  other  ACP  countries,  such  as  the  Fiji  Islands.  Thus  in \naddition to the immediate financial crisis facing the FSC, restructuring would be a prudent move \nto enable the sector to compete in world markets by 2010. \n \nThe  survival  of  the  Fijian  sugar  industry  depends  on  improving  efficiency  and \n7. \nproductivity.  Projections  suggest  that  average  yields  must  rise  by  56%,  from  45  t/ha  to  more \nthan  70  t/ha,  to  maintain  farm  incomes.  Currently  yields  exceed  70  t/ha  on  more  than  3,600 \nfarms, but this level is unlikely to be sustained on about 20% of the land, which is either steep \nwith  poor  soils  or  is  cultivated  by  farmers  unwilling  to  invest  further  in  sugarcane  farming. \nAssuming improved capacity utilization by 2008, at the projected higher yield from about 50,000 \nha  would  satisfy  the  projected  mill  demand.  While  doubts  about  whether  the  sugar  industry \nrestructuring will be successful are considerable, some 19,200 ha of sugarcane areas are likely \nto be available for alternative activities. \n \n8. \nMost  farms  are  diversified  to  some  extent,  and  restructuring  will  result  in  more  small \nproducers leaving the industry and larger farms reducing their sugarcane areas in favor of other \nhigher-value cash crops. Some seasonal sugarcane cutters will exit the industry, but many will \nfind  work  in  the  diversified  farming  systems,  such  as  those  focusing  on  horticulture  and \nlivestock,  which  are  usually  more  labor  intensive.  In  addition,  political  leaders  are  making \nprogress in resolving land tenure issues. Overall, the rate of lease renewals is likely to increase, \nalthough a certain level of nonrenewals will persist, because of landowners\u2019 desire to enter into \nfarming  to  improve  their  own  livelihoods.  The  Government  and  the  Native  Land  Trust  Board \n(NLTB)  have  assured  that  alternative  lands  will  be  made  available  for  leasing  for  agricultural \npurposes. Appendix 1 provides an analysis of the rural sector and Appendix 2 summarizes the \nagricultural lease renewal situation. \n \n9. \nsugarcane farmers and the likelihood that they will be able to move into alternative livelihoods.  \n\nWhile reliable data are scarce, the indicators in Table 1 illustrate the current situation of \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\nIndicator \nRural poverty \n\nLivelihood Vulnerability \nReliance on sugarcane for the \nbulk of farm household \nincome \n\nLow sugarcane yields \nthreaten farm viability as the \nprice of sugarcane falls \nExpiring leases are displacing \nfarm families and creating \ntenantless farms \n\nReduction in number of \nsugarcane farms and area \nplanted to sugarcane \n \n\nAgricultural Diversification \nContribution of the agriculture \nsector  \nFarmers\u2019 limited commercial \nskills \n\nFew fully diversified farms \nand limited area under \nnonsugar cash crops \nLimited agricultural exports \n \n\nNonfarm Income \nLimited employment \nopportunities \n\nFarmers have limited non-\nagriculture livelihood skills \nLimited number of small \nenterprises \n\nLimited Rural Finance \n\nInadequate Infrastructure \n\n \n\n3\n\nTable 1: Indicators of Rural Conditions  \n\nCurrent Situation and Performance \n\nCurrent estimates indicate that more than 40% of about 300,000 people in the Western \nand Northern divisions subsist below the poverty line of US$60/household/week, \nUS$624/capita/year, or US$3,120/household/year. \n\nAbout 21,000 families rely directly on sugarcane farming. Average sugarcane farming \nhouseholds at or below the poverty line obtain cash income equivalent to about 60% of \ntheir total income from sugarcane. Other cash crops contribute 20% and off-farm income \naccounts for another 20%.  \nAverage current yield is 45 t/ha at a price of US$26.3/t in 2003. Projected farm budgets \nusing a price of US$18/t in 2008 suggest that farms must achieve yields of more than 70 \nt/ha to sustain comparable net returns. \nExpiry of leases began in 1997, when landowners renewed 54% of leases to sitting \ntenants. Such renewals fell to 19% in 2000 at the time of a coup, but following resolution \nof the conflict, renewals rose to 44% in 2001. Many farms with expired leases are vacant, \nresulting in a loss of incomes on the part of both farmers and landlords. Landowners now \nappear to be increasing the rate of renewals, but are reluctant to renew leases under the \nAgricultural Landlord and Tenant Act (Appendix 2).  \nIn January 2003, Fiji Islands had 21,371 registered farms totaling 79,200 ha, of which \n64,000 ha were planted with sugarcane. By 2008, with yield increases and milling \ncapacity improvements, the required area will fall to 50,000 ha, and roughly 3,800 farms \ncould fully exit from sugarcane farming, although in practice, a much larger number of \nsugarcane farmers are expected to diversify from sugarcane and use some of their land \nto grow other crops (Appendix 2). \n\nIf diversification is to be successfully achieved with the least overall hardship, agriculture\u2019s \ncontribution to GDP will need to be maintained despite a declining value of sugar. \nFarms have not been managed as market-led enterprises. Young and incoming farmers \nneed skills to avoid the risk of early failure, but training in farm management skills is not \ncurrently available for farmers. \nMany farms are partly diversified from sugarcane, but market changes will reduce \nsugarcane to less than 50% of household income by 2008, making further diversification \nessential to maintain farm incomes. \nInsufficient bilateral quarantine agreements for specific crops and farmer skills constrain \nexports, particularly of horticultural products. The existing export treatment facility is \nviable, but is operating below capacity, and the supply of horticultural products does not \nmeet existing clients\u2019 demands. \n \nEach year sees about 17,000 new job seekers, but current levels of employment creation \nare unable to accommodate them. The economy is unable to employ large numbers of \njob seekers.a\nTraining institutions currently target the industrial sector. People leaving sugarcane \nfarming need new skills to embark on viable alternative livelihoods. \nThe informal enterprise sector is not well developed. The project area has about 5,000 \nsmall enterprises that employ 12,000 people. Support could increase this to 6,000 to \n7,000 enterprises and create 4,000 new jobs. \nAgricultural lending outstanding as of June 2001 was US$48.7 million to 12,602 \nborrowers. Sugarcane farmers account for 92% of agricultural borrowers and \nnonsugarcane farm households account for just 8%. The Fiji Development Bank and \ncommercial banks have reduced rural lending, and the development of microfinance \ninstitutions has been hindered because of the lack of capacity and support to expand \noutreach. \nInfrastructure in Vanua Levu is poor, constraining social and economic development. Bulk \nhandling port facilities exist for some commodities, but no general port facility\u2014serviced \nby international general cargo carriers\u2014is available to support diversified agriculture, off- \nfarm activities, and agro-industry development. Improved roads, electrification, and water \nsupply are highly desirable in support of project activities in Vanua Levu, and an \ninternational general cargo port in Vanua Levu is critical to support the Project and only \nSavusavu port is currently served by general cargo ships. \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, t/ha = tons/hectare. \na  According  to  the  1996  census,  Fiji  Islands'  industry  employs  13%  of  the  total  labor  force  of  about  187,689 \n\neconomically active people over the age of 15.

While sugar sector restructuring will cause some farmers to exit,  most  are expected to \ntake  the  opportunity  to  gradually  increase  the  scale,  intensity,  and  diversity  of  their  farm \nenterprises;  however,  their  ability  to  do  so  with  minimum  disruption  is  constrained  by  the \ndifficulties they face in accessing markets for nonsugar agricultural products, improved farming \ntechnologies,  off-farm  opportunities,  and \ntraditional \ncommodities\u2014sugar  and  copra\u2014are  struggling,  horticultural  exports  are  performing  better.  To \nidentify  alternatives  to  sugar  and  copra,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  undertook  a \ncomprehensive review of the agriculture sector in 1995.1 During project preparation, this study \nwas reviewed and market prospects were further investigated.  \n \nThe  agriculture  sector  has  the  potential  and  basic  capacity  to  diversify.  Market \n11. \nopportunities  for  which  a  marketing  structure  is  already  in  place  include  (i)  exporting  to  Indo-\nFijian,  Asian,  and  Pacific  island  communities  in  Australia  and  New  Zealand;  and  (ii)  supplying \nthe  expanding  urban,  agribusiness,  and  local  tourism  markets.  The  Fiji  Islands  exports  fresh \nfruits, vegetables, taro, and other products to regular buyers in Auckland, Brisbane, Melbourne, \nand Sydney. For example, in 2001, under a fruit fly-host bilateral quarantine agreement (BQA), \nFiji Islands exported 475 t of papaya, mango, eggplant, and breadfruit valued at US$510,000 to \nAuckland  via  the  Nature\u2019s  Way  Export  Treatment  Cooperative  in  Nadi.2  The  scope  exists  to \nincrease the volume, diversity, and duration of supply to both domestic and export markets. The \nhousehold  survey  that  was  part  of  the  project  preparatory  TA  found  that  21%  of  farms  obtain \ncash income from nonsugar farm production and that stakeholders were extremely interested in \ndiversification,  with  successful  examples  existing  in  the  project  areas.  Diversified  farms  and \nagribusinesses  obtain  at  least  50%  of  their  cash  income  from  specialized  or  mixed  farming  of \nnonsugar products, including fruits and vegetables (500 farms), root crops (400 farms), grains \nand pulses (100 farms), livestock (500 farms), agro forestry (200 farms), and spices (30 farms).3 \nThese early adopters demonstrate the capacity to manage relatively sophisticated private sector \noperations  including  specialized  cultivation,  contract  farming,  quarantine  treatments,  quality-\noriented post harvest handling, and marketing chains.  \n \n12. \nThe Government\u2019s extension services and contracts with agribusiness exporters support \nexisting diversification activities; however, limited support services and marketing chain capacity \nconstrain the extent of  diversification. Industry  organizations could play a major role, but most \nare weak. The Sugar Cane Growers Council (SCGC) has strong institutional capacity, but other \nestablished industry organizations, e.g., the Ginger Council, are weak and ineffective. Emerging \nindustry  organizations,  including  the  Fruits  and  Vegetables  Council  and  the  Organic  Farming \nAssociation,  have  limited  capacity,  but  active  participation  by  farmers,  processors  and  traders \nwill  improve  the  development  of  industry  organizations  and  their  ability  to  provide  services. \nArrangements  with  partner  industry  organizations  in  the  region  are  possible  where  both \norganizations stand to benefit.4  \n\n_____________________________ \n1  ADB. 1995.

Two  reasons  cited  are  (i)  the \nweak  investment  situation  following  the  serious  political  and  social  upheavals  in  recent  years, \nwhich resulted in a lack of confidence by the private sector; and (ii) the limited human resource \nskills, which could be addressed by making more courses and training facilities available in the \nproject areas to remedy the lack of vocational training opportunities.  \n \n14. \nTourism  accounts  for  17%  of  GDP  and  employs  about  40,000  people  serving  an \nestimated  400,000  tourists  in  2003.  Overseas  remittances  from  Fijians  have  been  increasing \nsignificantly, and are soon likely to overtake sugar as the third highest foreign exchange earner, \nafter  tourism  and  garment  manufacturing.  Events  in  2000  affected  tourism,  but  arrivals  have \nnow  recovered  to  their  levels  before  the  coup.  This  recovery  is  expected  to  result  in  an \nexpansion  and  upgrading  of  Air  Pacific\u2019s  fleet,  as  well  as  of  hotels  and  other  tourism-related \nindustries. Manufacturing contributes 15% of GDP and employs about 28,000 people, many in \nthe  clothing  and  footwear  industry,  which  is  dependent  on  preferential  access  to  markets. \nRecently,  Australia  announced  a  7-year  phased  restructuring  of  the  garment  industry,  and  Fiji \nIslands has to adjust to imminent loss of exports, and seek alternative livelihoods for displaced \ngarment  workers.  The  SDP  targets  growth,  particularly  in  food  processing  and  wood-based \nindustries, with an emphasis on the development of infrastructure in the Western and Northern \ndivisions,  including  both  Labasa  and  Savusavu,  where  development  will  depend  on  the \nconstruction  of  the  proposed  Savusavu  port  for  cost-effective  access  to  markets,  including  by \nthe garment industry. Tourism and manufacturing will increase the demand for related services, \nincluding  small  businesses  and  microenterprises.  The  potential  exists  to  further  develop \nbusiness connections with Pacific rim countries, which would create a demand for internationally \ncertified training in on- and off- farm livelihood skills. \n \n \n \n15. \nRural households are largely denied access to basic financial services for savings and \ncredit. The formal financial market sector has increasingly focused on sugarcane farmers due to \nthe ability to deduct repayments from FSC payments for cane. The urban-based banking sector, \nwhich consists of the Government-owned Fiji Development Bank (FDB),5 six commercial banks, \nand  three  licensed  credit  institutions,  has  generally  failed  in  rural  areas,  especially  in  remote \nareas in traditional, indigenous Fijian villages. These entities have turned away from agriculture \nlending,  mainly  because  of  small  loan  sizes,  limited  collateral,  unsatisfactory  repayment  rates, \nand  high  transaction  costs.  This  market  failure  constrains  livelihood  activities,  and  more  than \nhalf  the  people  surveyed  cited  lack  of  access  to  financial  services  as  a  principal  constraint  to \ndevelopment. The main issue in relation to the absence of rural financial services is the lack of \ncoverage by microfinance institutions (MFIs). \n \n16. \nThe Fiji Islands has 44 savings and credit unions (SCUs) with a total of 10,900 members \nand 9 savings clubs, all affiliated with the Fiji Savings and Credit Union League (FSCUL). The \n11  rural  SCUs,  which  average  69  members  each,  include  long-established  groups  within  both \nIndo-Fijian  and  indigenous  Fijian  communities.  The  rural  SCU  in  Volivoli  has  operated  since \n1954,  has  80  clan  members,  and  has  a  current  account  balance  with  Westpac  Bank  of  more \nthan US$5,000. The recently formed SCU in Korotasere, near Savusavu, has 65 members from \none clan and has accumulated more than US$3,000 in 2002.  \n \n\nThe Rural Financial Sector \n\nc.  \n\n \n\n_____________________________ \n5 Under its current license, FDB is allowed to provide credit for development but cannot accept deposits. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n17. \nSome 104 thrift and credit cooperatives (TCCs) provide credit but not savings services. \nAt present, all TCCs\u2019 liabilities are in the form  of member  shares and they have little ability to \nbuild  up  savings.  Ninety-seven  TCCs  are  members  of  the  apex  body,  the  Canefarmers \nCooperative Savings and Loan Association (CCSLA), which on-lent CCSLA loans to some 560 \nTCC  members  in  2002.  The  usefulness  of  TCCs  is  now  limited,  because  CCSLA  can  provide \nboth  credit  and  savings  services  directly  to  their  individual  members.  CCSLA  had  2,683 \nindividual members at the end of 2002, many of whom joined to access deposit services, and \nnonsugarcane farmers account for about half the savings accounts. In addition, the Sugar Cane \nGrowers Fund, which is neither a licensed financial institution nor an MFI, has a significant loan \nportfolio  that  could  be  used  to  support  sugarcane  farmers  in  diversification  and  livelihood \nactivities.  The  major  issue  facing  the  CCSLA  and  other  cooperatives  is  the  requirement  that \n30% of annual surpluses be placed in the National Reserve Trust Fund. This has the adverse \neffect  of  reducing  the  ability  of  CCSLA  and  other  cooperatives  to  retain  earnings  for  asset \nexpansion.  \n \n18. \nCurrently,  about  40%  of  rural  loans  come  from  informal  sources  that  charge  extremely \nhigh  interest  rates  of  60\u2013100%  per  year.  According  to  the  findings  of  the  project  preparation \nsurvey, around 65% of rural households have the capacity to save about US$200 per year, and \nthe  remaining  35%  can  save  about  US$30  per  year.  If  the  informal  lending  were  financed  by \nMFIs,  the  microfinance  portfolio  would  increase  to  about  US$20  million  compared  with  US$7 \nmillion in 2001. In the case of sugar farms, the reason for limited lending is the lack of adequate \ncollateral resulting from the 30-year fixed term agricultural leases. By establishing new MFIs in \nrural  areas,  strengthening  MFIs\u2019  capacity,  and  giving  them  access  to  wholesale  borrowing \nfacilities  to  diversify  their  portfolios,  community-based  MFIs  will  help  increase  deposit \nmobilization and provide better access to financial services for the rural poor in a cost-effective \nmanner.  \n \n \n \nThe  SDP  notes  that  rural  villages  have  unequal  access  to  basic  infrastructure  and \n19. \nservices.  The  development  of  opportunities  in  rural  areas  by  tapping  potential  in  all  economic \nsectors depends on the availability of such infrastructure and services.6 Vanua Levu has much \npoorer infrastructure than Viti Levu. It has no international port for general container cargo and \nonly 11% of roads are paved and their maintenance is poor. As a result, land transport costs, \nincluding  damage  to  produce  transported,  are  high.  This  means  that  access  to  markets  is \nexpensive, private sector investment and economic diversification are severely constrained, and \nout-migration  is  increasing.  Poor  aviation,  electricity,  telecommunications,  and  water  supply \nfacilities  also  severely  constrain  development.  Priority  should  be  given  to  appropriate  general \ncargo port and road development to permit cost-effective market access.7 \n \n \n \n20. \nTwo projects prepared in the 1980s\u2014the Agriculture Diversification Programme and the \nSigatoka Valley Rural Development Project\u2014were completed in the early 1990s and evaluated \nin 1996 and 1997.8 Both were rated as partly successful. The reasons for this rating were similar \nfor both projects, namely: (i) the reliance placed on assumptions was excessive, and insufficient \nconsideration  was  given  to  such  factors  as  road  access,  marketing,  resource  availability,  and \nsocial  conditions;  (ii)  the  level  of  stakeholder  participation  was  inadequate,  leading  to \n\nRural Infrastructure \n\nLessons Learned \n\nd. \n\ne. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n_____________________________ \n6 Government of Fiji Islands. 2002.

Efficient industry organizations have mitigated the risks of low diversification adoption \nrates in Southeast Asian countries.10 \n \nThe  project  design  took  into  account  an  ADB  analysis  of  Fiji  Islands\u2019  competitive \n23. \nadvantage.11 It also incorporated lessons learned from the Smallholder Support Services Project \nin  Papua  New  Guinea  on  the  experience  of  using  private  extension  services,12  and  from  the \nmodel used by the on-going project on promoting nonformal employment and micro-enterprise \nopportunities  through  training  in  Fiji  Islands  jointly  funded  with  the  Government  by  the \nInternational Labour Organisation.13 The project preparatory survey found that 21% of farms in \nthe project area obtain cash income from diversified farming, increasing their net earnings from \nUS$250/ha  from  sugarcane  farming  up  to  US$2,490/ha  from  eggplant,  US$1,300/ha  from \npulses,  and  US$310/ha  from  integrating  livestock  with  sugarcane.14  The  project  design  also \nincorporated lessons from ADB\u2019s extensive experience with MFI development. \n\nthe  role  of \n\n_____________________________ \n9  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization.  1999.

Manila. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nRationale and Strategy \n\n \n24. \nFor  two  decades,  the  EU's  preferential  prices  have  distorted  Fiji  Islands\u2019  resource use. \nAs a result, the agriculture sector suffers from a lack of diversification to other crops. Indications \nsuggest that Fiji Islands\u2019 sugar price will move to world market prices in the long term.15 To meet \nthe  challenge,  efficiency  must  improve,  and  resources  must  be  reallocated  to  new  uses  with \nminimum  disruption.  The  Project  will  address  concerns  in  relation  to  the  reallocation  of \nresources to new uses in viable livelihoods. Project design is in accord with the Government\u2019s \nSDP (footnote 6). The Project seeks to alleviate poverty, primarily by providing income-earning \nopportunities, through close partnerships between the Government and the private sector. The \nSDP aims to create a social safety net for the poor, and the Project supports this objective. The \nSDP  notes  the  great  potential  in  rural  areas,  but  recognizes  the  severe  constraints  resulting \nfrom  inadequate  market  access,  rural  credit  provision,  and  rural  infrastructure  and  from  poor \ndissemination  of  agricultural  knowledge,  particularly  in  relation  to  the  commercialization  of \nagriculture.  The  Project  directly  addresses  each  of  these  constraints.  Its  objectives  are  also \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update 2005\u20132007 and are aligned with \nthe Millennium Development Goals. \n \n25. \nIn  the  past,  the  Government  and  external  funding  agencies  have  financed  several \nprojects and programs that directly target agriculture development; however, no major projects \nhave  been  implemented  in  the  last  10  years  except  for  some  small  bilateral  assistance.  To \ninsulate the country from internal and external shocks, Fiji Islands needs to diversify away from \nsugar.  To  date,  lending  to  the  agriculture  sector  has  been  inadequate,  and  the  Government \nshould be helped with its agriculture restructuring initiatives to prepare farmers for the eventual \nremoval  and/or  reduction  of  the  sugar  price  subsidy.  Recently,  in  October  2004,  the  Indian \nGovernment  has  agreed  to  finance  about  US$40  million  for  the  sugar  mills  infrastructure \nupgrading. ADB coordinates closely with key development partners also involved in developing \nthe  agriculture  sector  in  Fiji  Islands.  These  partners  include  Australia,  the  EU,  India,  New \nZealand, and United Nations agencies. Appendix 3 summarizes such external assistance. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjectives \n\n \nA. \n \n26. \nThe  proposed  Project  aims  to  offset  the  adverse  effects  of sugar  industry  restructuring \nand lease expiry and to create employment opportunities.16 The goal of the Project is to protect \nand improve the standard of living of rural people, which is at risk because of the restructuring of \nthe sugar sector. The project framework is in Appendix 4. \n \n27. \nThe  purpose  of  the  Project  is  to  increase  sustainable  on-  and  off-farm  livelihoods  to  at \nleast  replace  those  lost  during  the  course  of  sugar  industry  restructuring  and  to  reduce  rural \npoverty.  To  this  end  the  Project  seeks  to  (i)  maintain  a  healthy  agriculture  sector  with  viable \nalternatives to sugarcane farming, (ii) generate sustainable off-farm work and self-employment \nopportunities  for  farmers  exiting  sugar  and  for  other  rural  poor,  (iii)  provide  access  to  savings \nand credit services in rural communities to facilitate livelihood activities and improve the quality \nof life, and (iv) provide critical farm access infrastructure for rural communities. \n \n28. \nThe  Project  covers  the  sugarcane  belts  and  nearby  rural  and  peri-urban  areas  of  the \nWestern and Northern divisions on the main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, respectively. \n\n_____________________________ \n15 Eighth ACP Ministerial Conference, July 2003, Fiji Islands. \n16  ADB.  2000.

Technical Assistance to the Fiji Islands \nfor  Intermediation  of  Sugar  Sector  Restructuring.  Manila.  The  Native  Land  Trust  Board  has  provided  a  letter  to \nconfirm its assurance that adequate land will be made available for project participants. \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n \nThese  two  divisions  have  the  highest  potential  for  increased  on-  and  off-farm  livelihood \nopportunities, including potential for diversified commercial agriculture and small business and \nmicro-enterprise  development.  The  Project  includes  poor  people  not  involved  in  sugarcane \nfarming  and  will  specifically  address  the  needs  of  households  rather  than  just  of  farmers, \nincluding the needs of women, in relation to on- and off-farm livelihood activities.  \n \n29. \nThe  Project\u2019s  target  groups  include  sugarcane  farmers,  cutters,  and  mill  workers; \nlandowners; and indigenous Fijians. It will help address the needs of continuing and incoming \nfarmers,  exiting  farmers  whose  leases  are  not  renewed,  and  indigenous  Fijians  left  out  of  the \neconomic mainstream. The target beneficiaries will be about 8,000 sugarcane farmers, as well \nas  a  significant  number  of  other  rural  households.  Rural  communities  will  participate  in  the \ndesign and implementation of the field activities. A participatory approach will help develop trust \namong  ethnic  groups  and  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  rural  development  policies  and \nADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategies.  \n \n30. \ndiversification, (ii) off-farm livelihoods, (iii) rural financial services, and (iv) project coordination. \n \nB. \n\nThe Project will comprise four components to be implemented in 6 years: (i) agricultural \n\nComponents and Outputs \n \n1. \n\nAgricultural Diversification \n\n \n\na. \n\nStrengthening Industry Organizations and Market Access \n\n \n31. \nThe  Project  will  establish  and  strengthen  related  industry  organizations,  strengthen \ncommercial  farming  capacity,  prioritize  adaptive  research,  and  support  private  extension \nservices to develop and adopt a strong commercialized agriculture sector.  \n \n \n \n32. \nTo facilitate sustainable agriculture diversification led by the private sector, the formation \nand  strengthening  of  industry  organizations  is  crucial.  Industry  organizations  are  forums  for \ndeveloping  policy  and  quality  standards,  networking,  disseminating  market  information  and \ntechnology, and providing negotiating strength. With the exception of the SCGC,  both existing \nand emerging industry organizations have weak capacity. Some existing industry organizations, \nsuch  as  the  Ginger  Council,  are  mandated  to  collect  levies,  but  provide  insufficient  services, \nwhile emerging industry organizations for fruits and vegetables, organic farming, and floriculture \nhave  active  interest  groups  but  no  funding  arrangements.  The  Project  will  help  strengthen  at \nleast  five  existing  and  emerging  industry  organizations  relevant  to  the  Project  by  providing \nfunding  for  activities  the  industries  consider  to  be  of  high  priority.  The  Project  will  provide \nfunding  for  applied  research,  training,  institutional  development,  and  marketing  proposals  that \nmeet  specific  criteria,  objectives,  and  will  seek  about  25%  industry  contribution.  Industry \norganizations  must  be  self-funding  by  the  end  of  the  Project.  To  improve  adoption  rates,  the \nProject  will  support  early  access  to  skills  training,  strengthen  post  harvest  and  marketing \nactivities,  and  help  provide  better  quality  outreach  services  through  greater  private  sector \nparticipation. The proposed funding criteria are detailed in Appendix 5. \n \nThe Project will also support the strengthening of quarantine services to facilitate access \n33. \nto  export  markets  through  BQAs  and  access  to  imported  seeds  and  planting  materials  while \nmaintaining bio security. The incursion of a new, foreign fruit fly would nullify existing BQAs, and \nthe high cost of developing new controls and new BQAs must be mitigated by strengthening bio \nsecurity.  The  Fiji  Islands  must  meet  WTO  quarantine  commitments  and  improve  linkages \nbetween the Fiji Quarantine Authority and the private sector. Quarantine inspection services will \nbe on a full cost-recovery basis, but until exports rise, anticipated revenues will not fully cover \ncosts.  To  strengthen  quarantine  services,  the  Project  will  provide  funding  (i)  for  a  quarantine \nspecialist,  (ii)  for  work  attachments  with  the  quarantine  authorities  of  importing  countries,  and \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nc. \n\nb. \n\nDeveloping and Transferring Technology \n\nStrengthening Commercial Farming Capacity \n\n(iii) for office and laboratory equipment and utility vehicles for carrying out inspections. The main \noutputs  will  be  increased  sales  of  conventional  and  organic  foods,  awareness  of  market \nrequirements  and  export  protocols,  and  secure  access  to  improved  planting  materials  and \nmarkets on the part of farmers. \n \n \n \n34. \nTo  facilitate  agriculture  diversification,  raising  participants\u2019  competency  in  relation  to \ncommercial  agriculture  is  important.  To  this  end,  the  Project  will  (i)  strengthen  the  off-campus \nvocational  training  capacity  of  the  Fiji  College  of  Agriculture  (FCA);  (ii)  develop  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture, Sugar, and Land Resettlement\u2019s (MASLR\u2019s) capacity for in-service staff training; (iii) \nestablish a farm business advisory service; and (iv) support two pilot market linkage activities in \nRakiraki  and  Seaqaqa.  Accreditation  of  the  courses  will  be  conferred  by  an  industry  training \nboard  made  up  of  representatives  of  FCA,  industry  organizations,  and  the  Training  and \nProductivity  Authority  of  Fiji  (TPAF).  Good  potential  exists  for  commercial  partnering \narrangements  with  training  providers  outside  the  Fiji  Islands  to  obtain  competency  standards \nand courses and within the Fiji Islands to deliver training. At project completion, by means of its \ncorporatization, the FCA will have viable revenue from training, and its training courses will be \naccredited. At least 500 farm business plans will be produced and farmers will have access to \nadvice  on  business  management.  The  Project  will  demonstrate  measures  to  support  farm \nenterprises,  post  harvest  handling,  and  marketing  from  remote  areas  and  disseminate \ninformation on prices, markets, buyers, and distributors. \n \n \n\n \n \nThe  Project  will  support  priority,  client-based,  applied  research  and  promote  private \n35. \nextension  services.  Research  proposals  will  be  invited  from  public  and  private  institutions, \nincluding Government research centers, universities, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \nin the processes described in Appendix 5. The Project will also provide support to the Koronivia, \nSigatoka,  Legalega,  and  Seaqaqa  agricultural  research  stations  to  assist  in  field  research. \nCurrently, private extension services are limited and will be introduced into the Project gradually. \nUntil private extension capacity is fully developed, MASLR\u2019s extension services will help support \nextension activities. NGOs will be recruited to help with extension activities and to facilitate the \nmobilization  of  farmer  groups.  Private  service  providers,  including  NGOs,  will  be  selected  in \nconsultation with steering committees. The project steering committees must approve research \nfunding and private extension intended for project funding based on specified criteria. The main \noutputs  include  at  least  eight  contractual  arrangements  with  private  service  providers, \nproduction  and  post  harvest  processing  of  crops  to  industry  specifications,  viable  model \norchards  and \nindustry \norganization, and greater farm production and incomes. \n \n \n \n36. \nThe  Project  will  improve  or  rehabilitate  about  600  kilometers  of  existing  farm  access \nroads  to  provide  farming  communities  with  access  to  markets.  Farm  to  market  roads  will  be \nidentified  in  a  participatory  process  indicated  in  Appendix  5  whereby  farmers  contribute  one-\nthird of maintenance costs to maintain such roads in good repair. Liaison with relevant agencies \nwill  ensure  complementarity  with  other  on-going  sugarcane  farm  access  roads  and  rural  road \nmaintenance and upgrading programs. \n \n \n \n37. \nFiji \n\nThere is limited recent experience of major agriculture and rural development projects in \nthere  are  several  departments  within  MASLR  which  will  support \n\nProject Implementation Unit and Community Organization  \n\nimproved  research  and  extension  performance, \n\nRehabilitating Farm Access Roads \n\nfarm  systems, \n\nIslands,  and \n\nd. \n\ne. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n \nimplementation.  To  facilitate  implementation  of  the  agricultural  diversification  component, \nproject implementation units (PIUs) will be established within MASLR's Department of Extension \nServices  in  Lautoka  and  Labasa  to  manage  implementation  and  ensure  effective  coordination \nbetween  MASLR  departments.  The  field  extension  offices  will  coordinate  activities  at  local \nlevels.  To  be  demand  driven,  participatory  processes  is  essential  to  inform  and  enable \nbeneficiaries to assess their needs and aspirations, and communicate with those implementing \nthe Project. National NGOs will be selected to lead project staff in assessing beneficiary needs. \n \n\n \n\n2. \n \n\nOff-Farm Livelihoods \n \na. \n\nDevelopment of Small and Micro-Enterprises  \n\n \n\nb. \n\nSupport for Vocational Training \n\n \n38. \nThe development of small businesses and micro-enterprises will promote employment in \nperi-urban  and  rural  communities.  By  extending  the  outreach  of  the  National  Centre  for  Small \nand  Micro  Enterprise  Development  (NCSMED),  the  Project  will  promote  income-generating \nactivities, such as handicrafts and small-scale agro-processing, in both farming and indigenous \nFijian  communities.  Beneficiaries  will  be  provided  with  opportunities  for  training  in  the  skills \nneeded for small businesses or employment. Particular attention will be given by the community \norganizing NGOs to participation by women and women's groups. The Project will also support \nsugar  mill  workers  who  may  be  laid  off  because  of  sugar  industry  restructuring.  NCSMED  will \nimplement  the  activity,  through  staff  located  in  the  six  project  field  offices  with  practical \nexperience  in  private  sector  business,  to  help  establish  about  1,200  small  and  micro-\nenterprises. \n \n \n \n39. \nTo  meet  the  target  beneficiaries\u2019  need  to  acquire  required  skill  levels  for  employment, \nthe Project will support the development of TPAF\u2019s vocational curriculum. A vocational training \nspecialist will help prepare business courses pertinent to self-employment in small businesses \nand  micro-enterprises.  The  accreditation  of  TPAF  vocational  training  courses  will  help  ensure \nthe marketability of the qualifications.  \n \n40. \nThe  Project  will  also  support  the  improvement  of  TPAF\u2019s  and  the  Sangam  Institute\u2019s \nvocational training facilities in Lautoka and Labasa, respectively.17 In Lautoka, TPAF\u2019s existing \nbuilding will be refurbished to create workshops and three technical training rooms, and a new \nbuilding and facilities will be constructed to respond to training needs. In Labasa, the Sangam \nInstitute  will  establish  additional  training  and  accommodation  facilities,  largely  for  youths  from \nremote  areas.  The  Project  and  the  Government  will  not  fund  any  of  the  operational  costs, \nbecause  both  organizations  operate  on  a  full  cost-recovery  basis.  Monitoring  reports  on \noperational activities will be part of the project monitoring system. The main project output will \nbe  the  establishment  of  additional  facilities  for  accredited  short-  and  long-term  vocational \ntraining.  About  52  new  and  refurbished  vocational  training  rooms  and  workshops  will  be  in \noperation by the end of the project period. Courses will be offered on a full cost-recovery basis, \nwhich will place the emphasis on meeting the actual demands of target beneficiaries rather than \non the technical interests of the training institutions. Based on projected capacity and demand, \nthe  institutions  will  train  more  than  1,000  people  in  vocational  skills  each  year  once  courses \nhave been disseminated and the additional facilities are operational. \n\n_____________________________ \n17  In  the  SDP  (footnote  6),  the  Government  of  the  Fiji  Islands  stated  that  as  its  policy  objective  is  \u201cto  strengthen \npartnership  with  technical  and  vocational  training  establishments,  the  Government  will  provide  grants  support.\u201d \nTPAF and Sangam Institute have confirmed their participation and contributions to the Government in writing. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n3. \n \n \n\nRural Financial Services \n\na. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening of Microfinance Institutions \n\n \n41. \nProposals to strengthen MFIs have been based on a review of current conditions in the \ncontext  of  ADB\u2019s  strategy.18  Specific  lessons  drawn  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  microfinance \noperations  in  relation  to  establishing  an  enabling  policy  environment,  setting  up  financial \ninfrastructure,  and  developing  financial  intermediaries  to  achieve  financial  viability  and \nsustainability have been incorporated into the project design. The Project will strengthen MFIs\u2019 \nability  to  meet  beneficiaries\u2019  requirements.  SCUs  and  CCSLA  and  its  member  TCCs  are \ncommitted  to  providing  appropriate  retail  financial  services  to  poor  rural  communities.  Unlike \ncommercial banks, MFIs will be community-based institutions that provide services more clearly \ntargeted to the needs of the poor. \n \n42. \nThe Project will focus on MFIs\u2019 financial systems by strengthening the apex institutions \nand their capacity to support their member institutions. The Project will strengthen and extend \nthe network of SCUs by supporting FSCUL as the apex institution responsible for establishing, \nsupervising, and monitoring SCUs. The expanded networks of SCUs will mobilize rural savings \nand  increase  the  flow  of  funds  to  sustain  on-going  activities.  The  Project  will  support  training, \nbusiness plans, improved governance and internal controls, upgraded systems, procedures and \ninformation technology, improved operating manuals, and promotion of new financial products. \nTwo  new  divisional  FSCUL  field  offices  will  receive  project  support  to  support  SCU \ndevelopment.  Training  will  help  strengthen  FSCUL\u2019s  management  structures  and  individual \nSCUs.  \n \nCCSLA  is  effectively  the  apex  institution  of  the  TCCs.  The  weakness  of  the  TCCs  in \n43. \ncomparison to the SCUs, is their lack of savings facilities. Thus they fail to meet the needs of \nbeneficiaries  and  are  prevented  from  mobilizing  savings  to  support  rural  credit.  As  simple \ndistributors of CCSLA credit the TCCs, as currently constituted, have a limited role. The Project \nwill help strengthen TCCs\u2019 role. Two new CCSLA branches in Sigatoka and Rakiraki will receive \nproject  support  for  their  establishment  and  operating  costs.  CCSLA  will  also  receive  training \nsupport  to  strengthen  its  management  and  operational  skills,  and  such  training  will  include \nTCCs  as  appropriate.  The  Project  will  also  facilitate  improved  resource  use  within  the  Sugar \nCane Growers Fund to support on- and off- farm livelihood development. \n \n \n \nThe  Fiji  Islands  has  adequate  liquidity,  but  the  use  of  credit  to  support  livelihood \n44. \ndevelopment in rural areas faces constraints. FSCUL and CCSLA will adopt proven MFI savings \nand  credit  models  to  mobilize  rural  savings  to  fund  much  of  their  new  lending.  However,  this \nfaces the risk that MFIs\u2019 activities will be constrained if they have insufficient liquidity to promote \nlivelihood  activities.  This  risk  can  be  limited  through  the  availability  of  wholesale  funds.  If  the \nMFIs  require  such  additional  support,  FDB  has  agreed  to  provide  wholesale  credit  lines  to \nFSCUL  and  CCSLA  in  a  minimum  amount  of  US$2  million  and  US$0.3  million  equivalent, \nrespectively.  FDB  will  make  the  wholesale  funds  available  using  its  own  funds  for  loans  to \nCCSLA  and  FSCUL  at  a  2%  per  year  lending  margin  above  their  cost  of  funds.19  The \nperformance of the proposed MFIs was evaluated during project preparation, and the MFIs are \nrecognized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, including the Reserve Bank of Fiji and the \nDepartment of Cooperatives for CCSLA and the Ministry of Justice for FSCUL. The MFIs have \n\nSupporting Wholesale Credit Line \n\nb. \n\n \n\n_____________________________ \n18  ADB. 2000. Finance for the Poor: Microfinance Development Strategy. Manila. \n19  FDB has confirmed its interest in  wholesaling loan funds to other MFIs in  writing. The MFIs have also confirmed \n\ntheir interest in participating in the Project and have agreed to provide their contributions. \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n \nmaintained  a  satisfactory  operational  history  and  are  supported  by  adequate  clientele  and \nmanagement. \n \n45. \nIn  addition  to  providing  general  credit  for  individual  small  farmers  and  households, \nlivelihood development also needs to be supported through the maintenance of agricultural and \nrural lending to larger farmers and enterprises. FDB has agreed to increase its own agricultural \nand rural lending activities under existing credit programs for creditworthy borrowers. With the \nhelp of the farm business advisory service and NCSMED, the Project will seek to improve the \nsupply  of  bankable  proposals  for  agricultural  and  rural  enterprises.  The  Project  will  also  help \nFDB strengthen its rural financial strategies and policies. \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Coordination \n\nindicate \n\nthat  effective  coordination  will  be  essential \n\n \nThe  Project  will  involve  a  number  of  implementing  agencies  and  lessons  learned  from \n46. \nprevious  projects \nto  successful \nimplementation. The project coordination unit (PCU) in consultation with the divisional PIUs will \nsupport  and  coordinate  activities  of  the  implementing  agencies  in  implementation  planning, \nfinance, and monitoring. The PCU will also be the secretariat to the national steering committee \n(NSC),  under  which  it  will  operate.  The  PCU  will  accommodate  two  international  specialists \nproviding support to the whole project implementation: (i) the project implementation specialist \nwill support each implementing agency in planning and procedures for implementation; and (ii) \nthe  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  (PPME)  specialist  will  establish  a  PPME \nsystem covering the whole Project and support its use for reporting, particularly for the mid-term \nreview and project completion reports. \n \nC. \n\nResponsiveness to the Changing Implementation Context \n\n2. \n\n \nPost-project evaluations have noted excessive reliance on assumptions and insufficient \n47. \nfield  data  for  project  design.  The  processes  proposed  in  the  Project  are  less  dependent  on \nphysical  features  and  more  concerned  with  establishing  partnerships  with  stakeholders  for \nflexible implementation. The Project will mainly rely on the private sector for services, including \nextension,  processing,  and  marketing.  The  project  design  includes  a  comprehensive  market \nstudy  and  possible  cooperation  with  the  private  sector,  cooperatives,  farmer  groups,  and \nindividual  farmers.  During  implementation,  this  cooperation  will  be  a  central  feature  of  the \ndevelopment  of  industry  organizations.  The  Project  also  defines  a  process  and  criteria  for \nstakeholders to determine priorities and needs as implementation progresses. \n \n \n \nEarlier post-project evaluations concluded that inadequate stakeholder participation led \n48. \nto  weakness  in  identifying  beneficiaries\u2019  needs.  The  project  design  has  involved  extensive \ndiscussions  with  stakeholders,  including  the  Government,  the  private  sector,  NGOs,  and \nfarmers. Meetings were held with resettled farmers, squatters, and clan chiefs to ensure that the \nfull  range  of  social  and  cultural  groups  was  consulted.  Findings  were  widely  distributed  and \nreported in the media, providing significant feedback. A series of eight stakeholder workshops \nwere  conducted  in  Lautoka  (four),  Labasa  (two),  and  Suva  (two).  More  than  500  stakeholders \nattended  workshops  or  were  interviewed.  Beneficiaries  will  continue  to  be  involved  during \nimplementation  to  ensure  that  the  services  provided  are  demand  driven.  Participatory \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  integrated  into  regular  reporting  to  ensure  that  beneficiaries\u2019 \nconcerns and perceptions are incorporated into project implementation in a timely manner. \n\nBeneficiaries\u2019 Needs \n\nSpecial Features \n \n1. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Capacity for Implementation \n\n \n \n49. \nPost-project  evaluations  have  noted  the  failure  of  project  design  to  recognize  and \naddress institutional weaknesses on the part of implementing agencies early on. The strength of \nthe  implementing  agencies  has  influenced  the  design  of  this  Project.  Several  established \nagencies  with  good  track  records  have  committed  to  participation  with  financial  contributions, \nincluding TPAF and the Sangam Institute for vocational training, and CCSLA, FSCUL, and FDB \nfor  rural  finance.  NCSMED  is  new  and  has  yet  to  establish  a  track  record,  and  the  Project \nspecifically  addresses  its  needs  for  institutional  development  in  terms  of  skills  and  resources. \nThe Project recognizes the importance of the private sector for sustaining activities after project \ncompletion,  and  the  project  design  has  provided  a  significant  role  for  the  private  sector  in \nagricultural support services.  \n \nD. \n \n50. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  US$49.8  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of  physical \nand  price  contingencies,  interest  during  construction,  commitment  charges,  taxes,  and  duties. \nThe project cost consists of a foreign exchange cost of US$10.7 million equivalent, or 21%, and \na  local  currency  cost  of  US$39.1  million  equivalent,  or  79%.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a \ngrace  period  of  5  years;  an  interest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per year; \nand  other  terms  and  conditions  as set  out  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement.  The  Government  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communications or advice \nfrom ADB. \n \n52. \nADB will finance a total of US$25 million equivalent, or 50.2% of the total project cost. \nADB financing will cover the foreign exchange cost of about US$10.7 million equivalent and a \nlocal currency cost of about US$14.3 million equivalent. The Government will contribute about \nUS$8.7 million equivalent or 17.5% of the total project cost, FDB will contribute about US$8.8 \nmillion  equivalent  or  17.7%,  and  the  other  beneficiaries  will  finance  about  US$7.3  million  or \n\n \n \n\n\f \n \n14.6%.20 Table 3 summarizes financing plans and Appendix 6 provides details of the financing \nplan. \n \n\n \n\n15\n\nTable 3: Financing Plan \n(US$ \u2018000) \n\n \n\n \n Source \n\nForeign\nExchange\n10,673\n0\n0 \n0 \n10,673\n\n \nLocal\nTotal Cost \nCurrency\n25,000 \n14,328\n 8,690                8,690 \n  a \n8,823 \n8,823\n7,262\n7,262 \n49,778 \n39,104\n\nPercent\n50.2\n17.5\n17.7\n14.6\n100.0\n\n Asian Development Bank \n Government of the Fiji Islands \n Fiji Development Bank \n Beneficiaries \n     Total  \na Includes taxes and duties of US$4.7 million equivalent. \nSource: Mission estimates. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n \n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n53. \nAs  the  executing  agency,  MASLR  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  the  overall \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  The  chief  executive  officer  of  MASLR  will  chair  an  NSC \ncomposed  of  representatives  of  the relevant  national  departments  and  implementing  agencies \n(Ministry  of  Finance  and  National  Planning,  Department  of  Environment,  Public  Service \nCommission, Ministry of Commerce and Business Development, NCSMED, TPAF, FDB, private \nservice  providers)  and  relevant  civil  society  organizations.  The  NSC  will  oversee  project \nimplementation  and  provide  policy  guidance  pertinent  to  the  coordination  of  implementation. \nThe  NSC  will  establish  divisional  steering  committees  in  the  western  and  northern  divisions, \nwhich  will  be  responsible  for  division-level  coordination.  The  NSC  will  meet  quarterly,  and  the \ndivisional steering committees will meet monthly (for the first year of the project and every other \nmonth  thereafter),  and  together  the  committees  will  coordinate  implementation  and  facilitate \nliaison  between  agencies.  At  field  office  level,  a  project  implementation  committee  will  meet \nmonthly to expedite project implementation. \n \n54. \nA  PCU  will  be  established  in  Suva  to  support  and  coordinate  activities  and  be  the \nsecretariat  to  the  NSC,  under  which  it  will  operate.  The  PCU  will  be  dedicated  to  the  tasks  of \ncoordinating  and  monitoring  the  implementing  agencies  and  supporting  their  planning  and \nfinancial \nfor \ndisbursements  under  the  loan.  With  a  single  office  in  Suva,  the  effectiveness  of  the  PCU \nrequires  substantial  funds  for  communication  and  travel  to  the  project  areas.  The  PCU  will  be \nled  by  a  project  coordinator.  No  separate  person  is  proposed  for  a  deputy  project  coordinator \nposition. One of the professional finance and monitoring staff will be selected as deputy, based \non  experience  and  qualifications.  High  caliber  staff  will  be  recruited  to  undertake  financial \nplanning  and  reporting,  and  PPME  system  will  be  developed  project-wide.  The  PCU  will  be \nsupported by an international project implementation specialist, engaged for three years, funded \nby  the  loan;  and  an  international  PPME  specialist  making  a  series  of  short  inputs  over  the \nproject period to establish a PPME system and support its use for regular reporting, particularly \nfor the mid-term review and project completion reports. \n \n55. \nThe  agricultural  diversification  component  will  involve  many  units  within  MASLR  and \nimplementation will require effective management and coordination. The western and northern \ndivisions'  Department  of  Extension  Services  will  establish  a  PIU  and  will  work  through  the \n\ntimely  and  accurate  preparation  of  documents \n\nfunctions,  particularly \n\nin \n\n \n\n_____________________________ \n20  Other  beneficiaries  and  their  contributions  are  (i)  farmers  and  the  private  sector,  US$3.15  million;  (ii)  TPAF, \nUS$0.49  million;  (iii)  the  Sangam  Institute,  US$1.08  million;  (iv)  FSCUL  and  SCUs,  US$0.44  million;  (v)  CCSLA, \nUS$1.68 million; and (vi) the Fiji Sugar Corporation, US$0.42 million. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n3. \n\n2.  \n\nProcurement \n\nImplementation Period \n\nextension  offices  throughout  the  project  area.  MASLR  will  re-orient  existing  posts  to  staff  the \nPIUs with a project manager, deputy project manager/monitoring specialist and supporting staff \nwho will work exclusively for the Project. Other MASLR staff, particularly in field offices, will be \nresponsible  for  detailed  implementation  as  part  of  their  re-oriented  job  descriptions.  The  staff \ncosts  will  be  funded  by  the  Government  within  present  budget  provisions.  PIUs  consulting \nservices include support for the Young Farmer Training Study and market linkage pilot activities, \nas  well  as  unspecified  services  that  meet  specialist  needs  identified  during  implementation. \nNational  NGOs,  with  established  record  of  implementing  community-based  projects  in  rural \nareas,  as  defined  in  Appendix  5,  will  be  selected  to  lead  project  staff  in  assessing  beneficiary \nneeds and aspirations. The NGOs will assign a full-time project manager to work with the PIUs \nto support implementation of the agricultural and other components. \n \n \n \n56. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  6-year  period.  Initial  activities  include  (i) \nestablishing  project  offices;  (ii)  recruiting  project  staff  and  consultants;  (iii)  holding  project \ninception  seminars  at  the  six  field  offices;  (iv)  establishing  an  imprest  account;  (v)  procuring \nequipment and machinery, service vehicles, and preparation for civil works; and (vi) establishing \nthe project performance monitoring system. Potential private service providers will be identified \nearly  on  to  commence  privatized  services  wherever  feasible.  A  more  detailed  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n \n \n57. \nGoods and services to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will be procured \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Equipment  and  machinery,  materials, \nand  vehicles  valued  from  US$100,000  to  US$500,000  will  be  procured  by  means  of \ninternational  shopping,  and  contracts  exceeding  US$500,000  will  be  procured  following \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Goods  valued  at  less  than  US$100,000  may  be \nprocured  using  direct  purchase.  Final  details  regarding  procurement  packages  will  be \ndetermined during implementation. The civil works proposed to be financed from the proceeds \nof  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  for  contracts  in  excess  of  US$1  million  and  with  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  for  contracts  worth  less  than  US$1  million  among  prequalified  contractors \nacceptable to ADB. Given the small and scattered nature of civil works to be constructed and/or \nrehabilitated under the Project, individual contracts are unlikely to attract international bidders. \nDomestic contractors have the capacity and capability to undertake the required contracts. An \nindicative procurement packages summary is in Appendix 8. \n \n \n \nThe Project will provide two key international specialists: (i) an implementation specialist \n58. \n(36  person-months),  and  (ii)  a  quarantine  specialist  (24  person-months).  Advance  action  is \nproposed for recruitment for these two posts. Additional international and domestic consultants \nwill  be  engaged  for  a  total  of  73  person-months  to  support  implementation  during  the  early \nplanning phase and initial operations. The international experts (46 person-months) will consist \nof (i) a PPME specialist (12 person-months), (ii) a specialist in training young farmers (3 person-\nmonths),  (iii)  a  vocational  training  specialist  (4  person-months),  (iv)  an  MFI  specialist  (10 \nperson-months);  (v)  an \ninvestment  specialist  (2  person-months),  and  (vi)  unallocated \nconsultants  principally  to  support  agricultural  diversification  (15  person-months).  The  domestic \nexperts  (27  person-months)  will  include  two  post  harvest  and  market  linkage  specialists  and \nothers  as  required  during  implementation.  The  Project  will  also  recruit  NGOs  and  private \nextension service providers to help expedite implementation. Individual consultants and NGOs \nwill be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n\nConsulting Services \n\n4. \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants. \nSelection  criteria  for  NGOs  are  included  in  Appendix  5.  The  Government\u2019s  attention  will  be \ncalled to ADB\u2019s recent anticorruption policy, particularly the section on fraud and corruption, as \nstated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Details \nof specialists and their terms of reference are provided in Appendix 9.  \n \n \n \n59. \nAll disbursements under the ADB loan will follow ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(January  2001)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  To \nexpedite disbursements, the Government will channel part of the loan proceeds into an imprest \naccount with a ceiling of US$500,000 that could be revised depending on project performance. \nThe  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  a  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  immediately  after  loan \neffectiveness.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  followed  to  reimburse \nexpenditures  and  liquidate  imprest  account  expenses  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \nUS$100,000. The Government\u2019s attention will be called to recent ADB\u2019s anti-money laundering \nand fighting terrorism policy.21 \n \n\n \n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n60. \nThe PCU and MASLR will maintain separate records and accounts for the Project that, \ntogether with the related financial statements, imprest account, and statement of expenditures \nrecord, will be audited annually by independent private auditors acceptable to ADB. The finance \nofficers  of  the  PCU  will  have  experience  in  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for  project  accounting  and \nauditing procedures. MASLR will provide ADB with copies of the Project\u2019s audited accounts and \nfinancial statements no later than six months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. \nThe  PCU  will  also  provide  ADB  with  concise  detailed  monthly  project  performance  reports, \nquarterly  progress \nreports  on  project \nreports  and  comprehensive  annual  progress \nimplementation  within  one  month  of  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  that  details  physical  and \nfinancial  progress  and  summarize  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  results.  Within  3 \nmonths  of  physical  completion,  the  PCU  will  prepare  a  project  completion  report  in  standard \nADB format and submit it to ADB. \n \n \n \n61. \nProject  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  (PPME)  will  be  undertaken  for  each \nproject  component  to  ensure  that  project  inputs  are  managed  efficiently  and  that  benefits  are \nrealized.  The  PCU  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  PPME.  Assisted  by  consultants,  it  will \ndesign, execute, and analyze baseline, midterm, and completion surveys, as well as any special \nstudies that may be required.22 PCU monitoring staff, assisted by consultants and working with \nmonitoring and field officers of each implementing agency, will monitor each activity. The PPME \nspecialist  will  help  to  (i)  set  up  a  computer-based,  gender-disaggregated  project  performance \nmonitoring  system  in  accordance  with  Government  and  ADB  requirements;  (ii)  select  a  set  of \nmonitorable  development  indicators;  (iii)  design  the  various  surveys,  including  rapid  results \ninitiatives;23  and  (iv)  organize  workshops  and  on-the-job  training  for  staff  engaged  in  PPME \nwork, including implementing agencies. The project performance monitoring system (PPMS) will \nbe  designed  to  enable  the  steering  committees,  PCU  and  implementing  agencies  to  (i)  keep \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n7. \n\n_____________________________ \n21 ADB. 2003.

The  project  design  framework  shown  in \nAppendix  4  will  be  used  as  a  starting  point  for  designing  the  PPMS,  which  will  be  revised  as \nappropriate during project implementation. The system will also include participatory monitoring \nto be designed and implemented by the community-organizing NGOs.  \n \n \n \n62. \nADB  will  carry  out  project  reviews  throughout  the  project  period  at  least  annually. \nReviews  will  address  both  the  effectiveness  of  the  implementation  arrangements  and  the \nProject\u2019s  outputs  and  outcomes,  and  will  propose  adjustments  where  appropriate.  During  the \nthird  year,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  carry  out  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  that  will \nassess (i) the actual physical and financial progress; (ii) the performance of the implementation \narrangements, including that of the executing and implementing agencies, and the PIUs; (iii) the \nperformance  of  the  consultants  and  contractors;  (iv)  the  status  of  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants; and (v) the actual and potential outcomes of the Project in relation to its objectives. \nThe  midterm  review  will  provide  a  basis  for  ADB  and  the  Government  to  identify  and  discuss \nany necessary changes in project design. \n \n\nProject Review \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \nIn conjunction with the Project, an advisory TA is proposed to support the strengthening \n63. \nof  commercial  agriculture  development  to  ensure  that  appropriate  policies,  institutions,  and \ncapacities are in place at project completion to sustain the performance of the private agriculture \nsector.  The  TA  will  strengthen  the  private  sector  so  that  it  can  take  the  leading  role  in \ndeveloping  and  promoting  agribusiness.  In  addition  to  developing  the  policy  and  legislative \nenvironment, the TA will facilitate the development of self-sustaining industry organizations with \na medium- to long-term strategic and entrepreneurial vision that can raise funds, manage their \noperations,  and  provide  effective  services  to  the  farming  community.  The  TA  will  (i)  help  the \nindustry  organizations  apply  funding  criteria  to  activity  proposals;  (ii)  assist  in  establishing  the \noperations,  linkages,  and  strategic  focus  of  farm  business  advisory  services;  (iii)  assist  in \norienting \ninformation,  services,  protocols,  and \nlegislation, \nrelationships;  (iv)  facilitate  institutional  linkages  and  networks  between  the  Fijian  agriculture \nsector, private and public organizations, and programs active in the region; (v) support training \nin  agribusiness  and  agro-processing;  and  (vi)  raise  potential  local  entrepreneurs\u2019  and  industry \norganizations\u2019 awareness of business opportunities. \n\ntrade-  and  market-related \n\n  \nThe total TA amount is US$875,000, of which ADB will finance US$600,000 on a grant \n64. \nbasis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, and the Government \nwill provide the remainder in kind. Twenty person-months of international and about 7 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services are envisaged. The TA consultants will be engaged in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB with respect to the use of domestic consultants. Appendix 10 provides more \ndetails. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \n65.  Without the Project, the poverty situation will deteriorate significantly. The projected fall \nin  the  sugarcane  price  to  F$40/t  (US$20.5  equivalent)  would  give  the  typical  4  ha  sugarcane \nfarm  a  gross  margin  of  less  than  F$1,000  per  year  (US$500  equivalent)  unless  yields  rise \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n \nsignificantly.  At  this  level,  farmers  could  not  pay  wages  to  sugarcane  cutters  or  rents  to \nindigenous landowners. The result would be further acceleration in out-migration to urban and \nperi-urban  squatter  areas,  thereby  increasing  the  strain  on  social  and  physical  infrastructure. \nFarm analyses show sufficient incentives for farmers to diversify in terms of increases in returns, \nlabor  productivity,  on-farm  employment,  and  farm  household  cash  income.  The  present  gross \nmargin  for  a  representative  sugarcane  farm  is  F$2,070  per  year  (US$1,035  equivalent), \ncompared with a poverty threshold of F$6,500 (US$3,340 equivalent) per household per year, \nand as noted, without the Project, falling sugarcane prices will reduce this in the future to less \nthan F$1,000 per year (US$500 equivalent). Thus, without the Project, unless the price of sugar \nroughly triples, yields improve from 45 t/ha to more than 75 t/ha, production costs are reduced, \nor sugarcane farmers diversify their farms, most sugarcane farmers will continue to live below \nthe poverty line. Appendix 11 summarizes the poverty reduction and social strategy. \n \nDiversified  agriculture  offers  household  incomes  that  are  both  well  above  the  poverty \n66. \nlevel and substantially higher than current household incomes. Based on a variety of alternative \nagricultural products, the gross margin for a \"with project\" diversified farm is F$11,297 per year \n(US$5,650 equivalent), well above the poverty threshold, even if only 60% of the farm is used \nfor  diversified  agriculture  practices.  Diversified  farming  activities  are  expected  to  provide \nadditional employment in post harvest and processing activities equal to at least 25% of on-farm \nemployment. An adoption rate of 50% could fully replace the sugarcane employment lost with \nalternative  on-farm,  post  harvest  and  processing  employment  generated  by  agricultural \ndiversification. Off-farm livelihoods are expected to contribute to employment generation.  \n \n67. \nHigher-value  diversified  agriculture  will  lead  to  changes  in  the  nature  of  employment \ncompared  with  the  current  sugarcane-based  situation.  Jobs  in  diversified  agriculture  are  less \nseasonal  in  nature  and  offer  significantly  more  employment  opportunities  for  women.  This \nprovides  a  greater  degree  of  household  stability.  Experience  in  Fiji  Islands  has  shown  that \nmotivated  by  the  well-being  of  their  families,  women  will  take  advantage  of  rural  financial \nservices  and  micro-enterprise  opportunities  to  engage  in  off-farm  employment.  In  addition, \nproviding  decentralized  training  opportunities  will  contribute  to  household  and  community \nstability. \n \n68. \nBenefits  from  the  Project\u2019s  agricultural  diversification  component  are  identified  in  terms \nof the expected increase in value added brought about by the project investment. Some of the \nrural  financial  services  benefits  are  measurable  in  terms  of  increased  agricultural  output,  but \nother rural financial services benefits and the off-farm livelihoods component are considered too \nspeculative  for  meaningful  quantification,  as  the  outcomes  cannot  be  predicted  accurately. \nBenefits  will  flow  beyond  the  project  area:  (i)  strengthening  NCSMED  will  enhance  the \ninstitution\u2019s  capability  throughout  the  Fiji  Islands;  (ii)  improving  access  to  and  strengthening \nMFIs  will  benefit  households  outside  the  project  area,  thereby  enhancing  income-earning \nopportunities; (iii) strengthening quarantine services will provide access to international markets \nfor products grown throughout the Fiji Islands, and thus new income-earning opportunities; and \n(iv) enhancing extension and research will improve services, thereby increasing productivity and \nincomes. \n \nOverall  project  costs  are  compared  with  the  projected  benefits  from  agricultural \n69. \ndiversification at an assumed 30% adoption rate, with provision for additional benefits from rural \nnon-agriculture  businesses  established  through  the  rural  financial  services  component.  No \nallowance  is  made  for  other  benefits.  The  main  quantified  benefits  are  based  on  agricultural \ndiversification that exploits identified and readily available markets. However, adoption rates for \nindustry-targeted agricultural diversification programs implemented in other countries are known \nto  vary  (footnote  10).  For  example,  during  1985\u20131995,  adoption  rates  ranged  from  36%  for \nmixed  horticulture  in  peninsular  Malaysia  to  70%  for  rubber  in  Sabah,  Malaysia.  Farmers  in \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fUdawalawe, Sri Lanka, faced with decreasing competitiveness in rice, diversified from 250 ha in \nother crops to more than 4,000 ha between 1986 and 1996. Factors affecting adoption rates in \nthese cases are similar to those in Fiji Islands and include (i) insufficient and diminishing returns \nfrom  the  traditional  crop  and  way  of  farming;  (ii)  strength  of  farmer  organizations,  extension \nservices,  and  marketing  networks;  and  (iii)  access  to  rural  microfinance.  The  most  important \ndrivers of diversification adoption rates in Fiji Islands are expected to be the rate of decrease in \nsugar  prices,  the  increase  in  sugarcane  quality  needed  to  compete  without  market  protection, \nand  the  broad  dissemination  of  information  about  initial  successes.  If  the  adoption  of \ndiversification practices were 100%, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) would be 58%; \na 75% adoption rate gives an EIRR of 45%; and the base case adoption rate of 30% gives an \nEIRR  of  19.1%.  The  EIRR  falls  below  the  12%  opportunity  cost  of  capital,  only  when  the \nadoption rate falls below 20%. These results suggest that returns are robust. The current trend \nindicates  that  farmers\u2019  incomes  from  sugar  are  inadequate,  thus  most  farmers  would  need  to \ndiversify, and an adoption rate above 30% is conservatively expected in the long run. Appendix \n12 presents detailed financial and economic analyses. \n \n70. \nThe adoption rates of diversified practices required for success are relatively modest, but \nthe  Project does  entail significant  risks.  These will  be  mitigated  by  the advisory  TA,  mainly  by \nstrengthening the industry organizations. The Project\u2019s success also depends on sufficient land \nbeing available for diversified farming. Failure to implement a fair market valuation system will \nperpetuate  the  current  system  of  illegal  facilitative  payments  to  landowners  in  an  effort  to \naddress  the  market  distortions  caused  by  the  Agricultural  Landlord  and  Tenant  Act  (Appendix \n2). The gross margins assumed are realistic, but their achievement depends on the attainment \nof quality standards that most farmers have not reached to date. The Project needs to oversee a \ntransformation  from  a  mentality  whereby  farmers  are  passively  dependent  on  a  single \nbuyer\u23afFSC\u23afto a business mindset favoring wider adoption of diversified crop production in a \nrelatively short period through private sector partnerships, focused extension services, and farm \nbusiness advisory services. Part of Fiji Island\u2019s comparative advantage is freedom from certain \npests.  Quarantine  risks,  especially  the  incursion  of  a  new,  exotic  fruit  fly,  would  see  the \ncessation  of  most  fruits  and  vegetables  exports  for  several  years  until  effective  control  and \ndisinfestation  treatments  could  be  identified  and  demonstrated,  and  revised  BQAs  could  be \nnegotiated for each affected product, a time-consuming and costly process. Market access for \nmany  of  the  identified  export  products  requires  the  negotiation  of  BQAs  with  the  importing \ncountries. The willingness of importing countries to assign priority and resources to this process \nremains  a  risk.  The  strengthening  of  quarantine  services  is  the  Project\u2019s  response  directed  at \nmitigating  quarantine  risks,  and  the  Government  has  given  assurances  that  all  the  necessary \nresources will be devoted to quarantine surveillance. The lack of financial services and credit to \nundertake  income-generating  and  small  off-farm  livelihood  activities  under  the  Project  pose  a \nrisk  to  its  overall  success.  In  addition,  MASLR\u2019s  implementation  capability  needs  to  be \nenhanced,  and  the  Project  supports  such  strengthening.  Political  interference,  especially \npertaining  to  the  allocation  and  use  of  resources,  needs  to  be  minimized  if  the  Project  is  to \nsucceed in achieving its objectives. While there are substantial risks associated with the Project, \nadequate  measures  to  minimize  risks  have  been  built  into  the  Project.  From  the  available \nevidence of the Project, benefits will outweigh the costs and the Project is sufficiently robust. \n \n71. \nThe risks are significant and the project activities seek to counter risks, such as on- and \noff-farm skill or credit deficiencies, as much as possible. The probable benefits are considered \nto outweigh the costs. The risks of social and economic disruption associated with dependence \non  a  single  commodity  crop\u23afsugar\u23afsold  at  distorted  market  prices  are  considered  to  be \ngreater.  An  initial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken,  and  the  Project  does  not \nanticipate major environmental risks. \n  \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n72. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n \n\n21\n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\nThe  Government  shall  implement  the  sugar  industry  restructuring  plan  in \naccordance with its terms.  \n\n(ii)  Within three years of the loan effective date, a Bio Security Bill that amalgamates \nlegislation  relating  to  quarantine  measures  and  brings  the  Government  into \ncompliance  with  WTO  agricultural  produce  and  export  requirements  and \npractices shall be adopted.  \n\n(v) \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii)  Within  three  years  of  the  loan  effective  date,  BQAs  shall  be  strengthened  and \nself-imposed restrictions on the exports of certain commodities shall be reduced. \nBQAs shall be pursued with other countries and entities, including the EU. \nThe Government shall encourage and promote the development of a competitive \nagriculture  sector  and  local  seed  industry  by  (a)  establishing  Seed  Import \nProtocols  to  be  developed  in  consultation  with  representatives  of  fruit  and \nvegetable growers and seed importers and adopting such protocols within three \nyears  of  the  loan  effective  date;  (b)  reducing  and/or  eliminating  subsidies  for \nagricultural  seeds  and  planting  materials  within  one  year  of  the  loan  effective \ndate; (c) reducing the restrictions on the importation of seeds for produce to be \nexported  under  the  BQAs;  and  (d)  expanding  and  formalizing  the  seed \ncertification  procedures  on  a  cost-recovery  basis  to  provide  a  uniform  seed \ncertification  process  for  seed  producers  within  two  years  of  the  loan  effective \ndate. \nThe Government shall strengthen its emergency response plan developed by the \nSecretariat of the Pacific Community\u2019s Regional Fruit Fly Project within one year \nof the loan effective date. \nLegislation \nrelevant \nthat  brings \ninternational laws and treaties relating to organic produce shall be adopted within \nthree years of the loan effective date.  \nThe Government shall corporatize the FCA by project completion.  \n\n(vii) \n(viii)  The  Government  shall  ensure  that  FDB  increases  its  lending  to  the  agriculture \nsector by making available US$8.8 million equivalent in funds to support loans to \ncreditworthy  farmers  in  the  project  area.

After  concurrence  from  ADB,  the \nGovernment  shall  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  with  the  Resettlement  Policy \nFramework agreed to by the Government and ADB. \n\nConditions \n\n \nB. \n \n73. \nThe Government has agreed to meet the following conditions for loan effectiveness: the \nPCU in Suva, and PIU offices in Lautoka and Labasa shall have been established, and each of \nthe  project  coordinators  for  Lautoka  and  Labasa,  and  a  domestic  accountant  shall  have  been \nidentified. \n  \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n74. \nADB,  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  US$25  million  to  the  Fiji  Islands  for \nthe  Alternative  Livelihoods  Development  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 25 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n1 March 2005 \n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n23\n\nRURAL SECTOR ANALYSIS \n\n \n1. \nThe  Fiji  Island\u2019s  rural  sector  is  dominated  by  agriculture,  and  within  agriculture,  by \nsugarcane  and  subsistence  farming,  which  provided  36%  and  35%  respectively  of  agricultural \ngross domestic product in 2002. All other crops together were 15% of agricultural GDP, fisheries \n13%, livestock 5% and forestry 5%. However, these figures understate the importance of sugar \nfor  Fiji  Islands.  Sugar  contributes  60%  of  cash  farm  incomes,  while  other  cash  crops  and  off-\nfarm  income  contribute  about  20%  each.  Subsistence  farming,  forestry,  and  livestock  provide \nnon-cash  or  delayed  benefits,  but  have  traditionally  provided  farm  households  with a  range  of \nhousehold  needs  and  resilience  to  political  upheavals,  tropical  cyclones,  and  other  shocks. \nSugarcane farms in the project area are small, averaging 4 hectares. The expiry of some 10,300 \nfarm leases over the next 25 years will result in experienced farmers leaving the sugar industry \nand  the  entry  of  landowners  who  may  have  limited  capital  and  experience.  Preferential  prices \nhave  distorted  Fiji  Islands\u2019  resource  use  with  a  bias  toward  sugar  and  allowed  the  industry, \nwhose performance was once world-class, to develop inefficient practices and standards. Over \nthe next few years, the European Union will reduce sugar prices to world price levels, requiring \na  restructuring  of  the  sugar  industry  most  probably  using  a  combination  of  improved \nperformance  and  reallocation  of  resources  to  other  sectors.  Recently,  in  October  2004,  the \nIndian Government has agreed to finance about US$40 million for the Fiji Sugar Corporation's \nmill infrastructure upgrading. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  focuses  on  the  reallocation  of  resources  to  new  uses  in  viable  rural \nlivelihoods.  Project  design  has  been  set  in  the  context  of  Fiji  Islands'  Strategic  Development \nPlan  (SDP),1  which  seeks  to  alleviate  poverty  by  providing  income-earning  opportunities  and \nbuilding capacity to enable the poor to take up such opportunities. The SDP also aims to create \na social safety net for those who cannot help themselves, and the Project indirectly supports this \nby  seeking  to  minimize  the  number  of  people  unable  to  help  themselves.  The  SDP  notes  the \nlarge potential in rural areas, but recognizes the constraints, including poor access to markets; \nlow  availability  of  rural  credit;  inadequate  rural  infrastructure;  and  poor  dissemination  of \nagricultural  knowledge,  particularly  in  relation  to  the  commercialization  of  agriculture.  The \nProject will address these constraints. \n \nA. \n \n3. \nWhile  some  farmers  will  continue  to  have  to  leave  or  enter  commercial  agriculture \nabruptly, others will make gradual changes, such as reducing their dependence on farming or \nrental  incomes  or  increasing  the  scale,  intensity,  and  diversity  of  their  farm  enterprises.  Their \nability  to  do  so  with  minimum  disruption  relies  on  enhanced  access  to  markets  for  nonsugar \nagricultural  products  and  improved  farming  technologies,  off-farm  opportunities,  and  rural \nfinance.  The  Fiji  Island\u2019s  traditional  commodity  sectors,  sugar  and  copra,  are  struggling,  but \nhorticultural exports have performed better.  \n \n4. \nViable  scope  for  diversification  exists,  along  with  the  basic  capacity.  To  identify \nalternatives  to  sugar  and  copra,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  undertook  a  comprehensive \nreview  of  the  agriculture  sector  in  1995,2  and  market  prospects  were  revised  during  project \npreparation.3 Market opportunities for which a marketing structure is already in place include (i) \nexporting  to  the  Indo-Fijian,  Asian,  and  Pacific  island  communities  in  Australia  and  New \nZealand; (ii) enhancing traditional diversity in household self-sufficiency; and (iii) supplying the \n\nAgriculture \n\n                                                 \n1   Government of the Fiji Islands. 2002.

March 2003 for detailed review summarized in \n\nthe Final Report, July 2003. \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nexpanding  urban,  agribusiness,  and  tourism  markets.  Fresh  fruits,  vegetables,  taro,  coconuts, \nspices, and other products are exported to regular buyers in Auckland, Sydney, Melbourne, and \nBrisbane.  Under  a  fruit  fly-host  bilateral  quarantine  agreement  (BQA),  475  metric  tons  of \npapaya,  mango,  eggplant,  and  breadfruit  valued  at  US$510,000  were  exported  in  2001  to \nAuckland  via  the  Nature\u2019s  Way  Export  Treatment  Cooperative  in  Nadi.4  Based  on  existing \ndemand,  prices,  and  quality,  scope  exists  to  increase  the  volume,  diversity,  and  duration  of \nsupply  to  both  domestic  and  export  markets.  Local  agribusinesses  are  exploring  options  for \ntechnological  and  vertical  integration  to  substitute  local  products  for  imported  feed  and  food \ngrains,  spices,  and  raw  materials,  thereby  strengthening  their  control  over  supply  and  quality. \nThe  incremental  value  from  these  markets  is  estimated  at  F$25  million  per  year  (US$12.8 \nmillion  equivalent).  A  number  of  other  significant  potential  market  opportunities  are  identified. \nExports from Fiji have been successful in Japan, the United States, and Europe over the past \ndecade, but have not kept up with demand or export quarantine requirements. Exploiting these \nopportunities  requires  increased  supply,  some  promotion,  and  a  sufficient  marketing  structure, \nand  for  some  products,  such  as  large-scale  pineapples  and  industrial  crops,  substantial \nagribusiness investment is required. \n \n5. \nThe quarantine services\u2019 weak capacity to develop and negotiate market access under \nBQAs,  combined  with  limited  extension  capacity  to  help  farmers  seeking  to  comply  with  BQA \nrequirements, has constrained exports. While successful, Nadi\u2019s single facility for treating export \nproduce is operating below capacity. The use of post harvest handling equipment and practices \nat  the  farm  level  is  limited,  as  are  marketing  skills.  While  the  Fiji  Islands  does  have  a  few \nestablished  agribusinesses  and  emerging  industry  organizations,  the  nonsugar  industries  are \ngenerally  fragmented.  As  a  result,  internal  linkages  within  the  sector,  which  could  facilitate \nmarketing,  information  flow,  and  technology  transfer,  are  inadequate.  For  example,  domestic \ngrain  production  focuses  largely  on  regional  or  household  food  security,  while  domestic \nlivestock  agribusinesses  cannot  obtain  reliable  local  supplies  of  feed  grains  that  meet  basic \nspecifications, and therefore rely on imports.  \n \n6. \nIn more remote areas, such as Rakiraki and Vanua Levu, marketing networks are absent \nor  weak,  and  physical  access  to  markets  is  constrained  and  costly  because  of  inadequate \ninfrastructure.  Poor  road  and  electricity  infrastructure  in  western  Vanua  Levu  has  limited \neconomic  development  and  has  been  a  critical  factor  in  the  demise  of  agribusiness  projects \nthere  in  the  past.  Poor  product  handling  practices  and  the  absence  of  local  cool-stores  and \ngrading and packing facilities lead to severe quality deterioration during the passage from farm \nto  market.  Exporters  and  extension  agents  have  worked  with  about  ten  pioneering  small  farm \nbusinesses  to  improve  harvesting  and  handling,  including  by  using  stackable  crates,  basic \npacking  sheds,  and  simple  pre-coolers  such  as  old  refrigerated  shipping  containers.5  Once \nestablished, the owners of these facilities have become focal points for handling produce from \nother  surrounding  farmers,  and  managed  commercially,  the  facilities  provide  benefits  to  all \nparties. Sustainability also requires improving business management skills and building up the \nsystems,  marketing  chains,  service  businesses,  and  relationships  to  support  the  transition. \nScaling  up  will  require  facilitating  industry  communication  forums,  promoting  private  sector \npartnering  relationships  between  businesses  and  industry  and  training  organizations,  and \ntraining  to  international  standards.  Appropriate  technology,  services  and  potential  business \npartners  are  accessible  either  within  the  Fiji  Islands  or  in  the  region.  Experience  in  the  Fiji \nIslands and elsewhere is often of failure if the Government engages in trading, which is better \nleft  to  business  and  industry  organizations  that  can  play  a  crucial  role  in  facilitation  through \n\n                                                 \n4 TA No. 3887-FIJ Alternative Livelihoods Project: Mid Term Report. March 2003, Appendix 2. \n5 A model has been supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization Postharvest Technical Cooperation Project \n\nin Sigatoka.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n25\n\ninput  supplies \n\nclose  participation  with  the  private  sector  in  developing  policy  and  legislation,  disseminating \ntechnical and market information, undertaking adaptive research to meet specific industry needs \nand facilitating market access. \n \nSolving  production  and  marketing  constraints  requires  the  Government  to  encourage \n7. \nindustry organizations to take the lead in industry development, improve product standards, and \nstrengthen  organizations  that  provide  services  critical  to  agricultural  exports  and  inputs.  The \nQuarantine Authority must strengthen its focus on facilitating agricultural industry development \nthat  allows  some  cost  recovery,  and  not  just  focus  on  providing  bio  security  as  a  strategy  to \navoid  costly  incursions.  Most  of  the  existing  industry  organizations  are  weak.  Only  the  Sugar \nCane  Growers  Council  is  long  established  and  has  strong  institutional  capacity,  including \ncompulsory levy legislation. Other established industry organizations with levy legislation, e.g., \nthe  ginger,  root  crops,  and  coconut  industry  organizations,  are  weak  and  ineffective.  Recently \nformed  industry  organizations,  including  the  Fruits  and  Vegetables  Council  and  the  Organic \nFarming  Association,  have  little  capacity  as  yet,  but  do  have  strong  farmer  and  industry \nparticipation on a voluntary, commercial basis, which means that they can play an effective role \nin industry development and service provision, and also that they have good potential for self-\nfunding  through  voluntary  membership  fees  and  revenues  from  services,  including  providing \ntraining,  information,  marketing  support  (e.g.,  registered  brands,  promotions,  negotiation \nstrength),  and  selected \n(e.g.,  packaging,  seeds,  pesticide).  Twinning \narrangements  with  partner  industry  organizations  in  the  region  are  possible  where  mutual \nbenefits exist. \n  \n8. \nA key problem is the lack of a commercial ethic among farmers, a result of domination \nby  a  single,  large  sugar  industry  that  is  governed  by  a  master  award  rather  than  by  market \nforces. As a result, most of the smallholder farms have not been treated or operated as small \ncommercial  enterprises.  However,  strong  interest  in  diversification  exists  among  stakeholders \nand  successful  examples  exist  in  the  project  areas.  The  social  survey  that  formed  part  of  the \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  found  that  21%  of  farms  obtain  cash  income  from \nnonsugar farm production, and that diversified farms and agribusinesses that generate at least \n50%  of  their  cash  income  from  specialized  or  mixed  farming  of  nonsugar  products  include \nproducers  of  fruits  and  vegetables,  root  crops,  grains  and  pulses,  livestock,  agro  forestry, \nspices,  and  honey.  These  early  adopters  demonstrate  capacity  to  manage  relatively \nsophisticated  operations,  including  irrigation,  specialized  cultivation  and  export  treatments, \nquality-oriented post harvest and marketing chains, contract farming, and buyer relationships. \n  \nTechnology  constraints  can  be  addressed  by  equipment  and  practices  that  a  small \n9. \nminority in the sector already use, and can also be adapted from designs and systems proven in \nsimilar  contexts  overseas.  Increasing  adoption  of  such  technologies  will,  however,  require \ntraining  to  acquire  new  skills,  some  adaptive  research,  and  focused  agricultural  extension \nsupport.  Farmers  have  adopted  diverse  technologies  and  skills  through  demonstrations, \nextension,  exchanges  between  farmers,  small-scale  external  training  assistance,  and  industry \ngroup  workshops.  Tobacco  and  poultry  agribusiness  have  also  demonstrated  the  potential  to \nimprove  farmers\u2019  capacity  through  contract  farming  and  in-house  technical  support.  Fruit  and \nvegetable exporters advise growers on harvesting, handling, and field measures to comply with \nexport BQAs and maintain cooling and packing facilities. \n \n10. \n The  availability  of  training  in  practical,  commercial  farm  management  and  farming \ncompetencies  is  limited,  although  the  Training  and  Productivity  Authority  of  Fiji  (TPAF)  does \nprovide some training relevant to farm enterprises, such as business management, welding, and \nmechanics.  The  Fiji  College  of  Agriculture  (FCA)  provides  a  three-year  academic  diploma  in \ntropical agriculture funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Sugar and Land Resettlement to meet \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nOff-Farm Livelihoods \n\nits  ongoing  staffing  needs.  The  FCA  could  provide  competency-based  training  in  partnership \nwith local colleges by adapting course materials from training institutions registered with foreign \nnational agricultural industry training boards. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe  SDP  2003\u20132005  noted  that  formal  employment  in  2000  was  recorded  at  111,500 \nand that the formal sector is unable to accommodate about 17,000 new job seekers each year. \nTwo main reasons cited in the plan are the inadequacy of productive investment and the limited \nhuman  resource  skills.  Banks  and  investors  in  the  Fiji  Islands  suggest  that  finance  for \ninvestment in medium and large enterprises is not in short supply, but potential investors cite a \nlack  of  confidence.  Although  the  Project  cannot  fully  address  the  causes  of  low  private  sector \ninvestment, it can help people acquire new and improved skills to enter the formal workforce.  \n \n12. \nThe  informal  off-farm  sector,  which  is  so  prominent  and  is  often  dynamic  in  many \ncountries,  is  not  yet  well  developed  in  Fiji.  To  enhance  off-farm  development,  in  2002  the \nlegislature passed the Small and Micro Enterprises Development Act, under which the National \nCenter  for  Small  and  Micro  Enterprise  Development  (NCSMED)  was  established.  The \ninstitutional framework for small enterprise development has yet to be propagated, and existing \ncapacities  in  the  NCSMED  are  limited.  Urban  and  peri-urban  areas  have  large  numbers  of \nnonagricultural  small  enterprises,  but  rural  areas  have  only  the  occasional  stores  and  micro \nenterprises, and most rural services are owned by urban  proprietors. The Project will promote \nrural small enterprises for agricultural storage and cooling, input supply, and equipment. \n \n13. \nThe development of small businesses and micro-enterprises requires a leading sector to \ncreate  a  market.  In  the  project  areas,  agriculture  will  act  as  such  a  leading  sector.  Some \nbeneficiaries, including farmers, agricultural laborers, and mill workers, have the capital and skill \nrequirements to set up small enterprises, and some have already done so. However, for more to \nbe  able  to  do  so  requires  technical  and  business  training,  orientation,  and  advice  about \navailable  opportunities.  While  training  providers,  including  the  TPAF  and  the  Fiji  Institute  of \nTechnology, tailor training courses to levy-paying larger enterprises, they also have the capacity \nto  provide  appropriate  vocational  and  business  management  training  relevant  to  the  Project\u2019s \ntarget groups.  \n \nC. \n \n14. \nRural  households,  mainly  nonsugarcane  growers,  are  largely  denied  access  to  basic \nfinancial services,  and  even  for  sugarcane  farmers,  the  formal  finance  sector  has increasingly \nlimited its services to richer farmers. The urban-based banking sector has failed to serve rural \nareas  in  general,  and  has  especially  failed  those  in  remoter  areas  in  traditional,  indigenous \nFijian villages. Even among sugarcane farmers, indigenous Fijian farmers are 60% more likely \nto  be  deprived  of  access  to  formal  banking  services.  This  market  failure  poses  a  major \nconstraint to livelihood activity based on agricultural diversification, off-farm livelihoods, or small \nand  micro-enterprise  development.  More  than  half  of  Fijian  farmers  surveyed  cited  lack  of \naccess to financial services\u2014credit and savings\u2014as a major constraint to development.  \n \n15. \nThe  Fiji  Islands  is  also  facing  the  consequences  of  a  Government  policy  of  targeted \ncredits  and  grants  that  have  undermined  the  development  of  sustainable  rural  financial \ninstitutions.  The  widespread  use  of  subsidized  credits  has  reinforced  a  culture  of  financial \nindiscipline,  contributing  to  poor  repayment  performance  and  preventing  the  development  of \nrural  savings  and  credit  services  by  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  capable  of  providing \nefficient financial services to rural households. A major weakness of the Government programs \nis their emphasis on credit, as typified by the Fiji Development Bank offering only credit services \n\nRural Financial Sector \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n27\n\nRural Infrastructure in Vanua Levu \n\nwhile  generally  ignoring  savings.  As  a  result,  most  rural  areas  lack  small  savings  and  deposit \nfacilities. \n \n16. \nSome  MFIs  do  serve  those  sugarcane  farmers  who  are  richer  and  can  repay  through \ntheir sugarcane proceeds from the Fiji Sugar Corporation. Urban community groups are served \nby savings and credit unions. Much of the proposed agricultural diversification will take the form \nof sugarcane farmers developing and commercializing their farming systems. The Sugar Cane \nGrowers  Fund  and  the  Canefarmers  Cooperative  Savings  and  Loan  Association  (CCSLA)  will \nsupport the Project by serving existing and incoming farmers. The Fiji Savings and Credit Union \nLeague and the CCSLA plan to extend their services to rural areas. \n \n17. \nThe  community-level  MFIs  have  demonstrated  that  they  can  provide  rural  financial \nservices in a cost-effective manner. As community-based entities, they are much better able to \nadapt  to  local  community  needs  than  commercial  banks,  and  this  is  especially  beneficial  in \naddressing the social and cultural conditions in indigenous communities, which have previously \nbeen  denied  access  to  financial  services  and  have  not  yet  developed  a  culture  of  saving  and \ntimely  debt  repayment.  Such  community-level  institutions  are  needed  to  ensure  that  savings \nflow  into  sound  investments  and  that  the  loans  are  repaid  promptly.  Their  expansion  depends \non  the  creation  of  and  support  for  viable  MFIs  able  to  work  in  rural  communities.  Appropriate \ngovernment policy and strategy would include phasing out grant programs that interfere with the \ndevelopment  of  microfinance.  The  supervision  and  governance  of  MFIs  need  to  be \nstrengthened,  and  access  to  wholesale  finance  would  leverage  their  deposit-taking  ability  and \nprofit retention. \n \nD. \n \n18. \nThe  SDP  notes  that  rural  villages,  rural  settlements,  and  outlying  islands  still  have \nunequal access to basic infrastructure and services. The development of opportunities in rural \nareas  by  tapping  potential  in  all  economic  sectors  (tourism,  agriculture,  forestry,  fisheries, \nmineral  resources,  and  manufacturing)  depends  on  the  availability  of  such  services  and \ninfrastructure. In relation to such infrastructure and services, Vanua Levu is an outer island by \ncomparison with the scale and quality of service provision in Viti Levu. The development needs \nof Vanua Levu have long been known and planned for, but funds have been used for better-off \nViti Levu, which has also received higher priority. \n \n19. \nPast agricultural programs on Vanua Levu have had limited success because of a lack \nof  market  access  opportunities.  Development  at  Seaqaqa  initially  foresaw  a  farming  system \nbased half on sugarcane and half on diversified crops, but ended up focusing predominantly on \nsugarcane because of the lack of market access. The Project will fail in Vanua Levu if efficient \nand effective market access and supporting infrastructure are not provided. \n \n \n \n20. \nCurrently only bulk sugar, logs, and coconut oil are exported directly from Vanua Levu. \nWithout an international port for general container-based cargo to provide cost\u2013effective, direct \naccess to markets, private sector investment and export diversification will be constrained and \nhigh  rates  of  inter-island  migration  will  continue.  Development  of  a  new  timber  port  at  Bua  in \nwestern Vanua Levu will be another specialized port un-served by general cargo vessels.  Most \ngoods  must  be  transshipped  through  Suva  or  Lautoka,  substantially  increasing  the  costs  of \nexports and imports, hindering investment, and increasing costs to consumers by 10% to 20% \nmore  than  in  Viti  Levu.  International,  general  cargo  ships  already  serve  Savusavu  to  pipe \naboard  oil  from  the  copra  mill,  but  they  cannot  load  and  unload  general  cargo  due  to  the \nabsence of port facilities. A new port in Savusavu would benefit all of Vanua Levu and nearby \n\nPorts \n\n1. \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n2. \n\nOther Infrastructure \n\nislands such as Taveuni, Rabi, and Kioa as a general cargo port already served by international \nshipping, unlike any other location on the island. \n \n \n \nAt 1,690 kilometers, Vanua Levu has about half the length of roads of Viti Levu, but only \n21. \n188  kilometers  (11%)  are  paved.6  The  lack  of  paved  roads,  the  high  vehicle  operating  costs \n(including damage to transported produce, and the long travel times have contributed to the lack \nof development, thereby reducing opportunities and encouraging inter-island migration by both \nindigenous  Fijians  and  Indo-Fijians.  The  airports  at  Labasa  and  Savusavu  do  not  have \ninternational status, and current runway lengths and facilities limit domestic services to day-time \nflights  by  10-  to  17-seat  aircraft,  which  is  inadequate  for  significant  tourism  and  excludes  air \nfreight.  Domestic  services  urgently  need  to  be  improved  to  support  diversified  economic \ndevelopment.7  Labasa  does  have  electricity  generating  capacity,  but  the  Fiji  Electricity \nAuthority\u2019s grid serves only 25% of the island, concentrating on urban areas, but neglecting rural \nareas and villages. A reliable supply is needed for sustainable agro-processing and handling, as \nwell as for nonagricultural enterprises.8  \n \n22. \nAlmost half of Vanua Levu has no accessible telecommunications links, so even mobile \nphones  cannot  be  used.  Improved  communication  is  vital  for  market  access  and  for  the \nsustainability of commercial rural development.9 \n \n23.  Most rural communities on Vanua Levu do not have access to potable water or an efficient \nwater  supply.  Waterborne  diseases  are  prevalent,  and  the  health  authorities  have  identified  the \npresence of some potentially fatal diseases. \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB.  2002.

The Native Lands Trust Board \n(NLTB) is a statutory body empowered to administer, develop, and manage native land for the \nbenefit of its Fijian owners. The NLTB identifies which areas are required for use by traditional \nFijian  communities  and  makes  the  remainder  of  the  land  available  for  leasing.  NLTB,  not  the \nactual landowners, issues the legally binding lease for agricultural, commercial, residential, and \nother uses. Leases of native land can only be issued by NLTB, so all farmers of native land are \ntenants  whether  they  are  Indo-Fijian  or  indigenous  Fijian,  including  members  of  local  clan, \nwhich owns the land, as well as Fijians from other areas of the Fiji Islands. No distinctions are \nmade on the basis of race or community  membership, and the concept of owner-farmer does \nnot apply to any farmers of native land. \n \n2. \nLaws  to  govern  relations  between  landlords  and  agricultural  tenants  were  enacted  in \n1966 and became effective in 1967. The Agricultural Landlord and Tenant Act (ALTA) governs \nall agricultural leases of more than 2.5 acres, or about 1 hectare (ha), and cannot be amended \nunless  passed  by  two  thirds  of  the  members  of  both  the  lower  and  upper  houses.  The \nGovernment is currently debating whether ALTA should be supported in its present form, as it \nsees  the  legislation  as  too  rigid.  ALTA  gives  no  right  of  automatic  renewal  of  leases,  and \ntenants can be required to vacate the land once the fixed lease and grace period expire. This \nhas  created  an  impasse  in  which  lease  terms  acceptable  to  all  parties  cannot  be  negotiated \nunder ALTA. \n \n3. \nTable A2.1 summarizes the key differences between the current and proposed legislation. \n \n\nNLTB has proposed an alternative lease arrangement under the Native Land Trust Act. \n\nTable A2.1: Differences Between the Agricultural Landlord and Tenant Act and the \nProposed Native Land Trust Act \n \n\nAgricultural Landlord and Tenant Act \nLease Period \nA  minimum  30  years  to  a  maximum  of  99  years  is \nallowed  with  no  right  of  renewal,  and  the  tenant  must \nvacate  the  land  after  a  grace  period  in  the  event  of \nnonrenewal.  All  leases  have  been  set  for  a  30-year \nperiod. \nRental \nThe maximum annual rental is 6% of the unimproved \ncapital value. \n\nNative Land Trust Act \n\nA  50-year  rolling  lease  is  proposed  with  review  after  25 \nyears  to  consider  extension  for  a  further  25  years,  thus \nthe  tenant  farmer  is  always  given  a  minimum  25  years \nnotice of nonrenewal. \n\nA  market-based  rental  system  would  be  linked  to  the \nproductivity  of  the  land  and  agreed  to  by  the  landlord \nand tenant rather than being imposed by legislation. \nFair  market-oriented  reviews  would  be  based  on  the \nrental system agreed on by the landlord and the tenant. \n\nimprovements  of \n\nThe rental rate is reviewed every five years, subject to \nthe maximum rental rate. \nDevelopment and Improvement \nThe  tenant  can  claim  compensation  for  all  development \nand \nthe  property  with  claims \ndetermined by the Agricultural Tribunal. \nSource: Native Land Trust Board. \n \n3. \nPolitical debate surrounds the issue of whether or not leases are renewed and whether \nthe  ensuing  terms  and  conditions  of  the  lease  are  fair  and  equitable.  Because  the  fixed \nschedule of lease rental rates under ALTA has not been updated since 1997, the rental rates \nare out of date.  In an effort to limit this distortion, NLTB has introduced a lump sum payment, \nthe new lease consideration, to induce landowners to lease out their land for an additional 30-\nyear  period.  However,  the  new  lease  consideration  has  been  applied  discriminately,  being \n\nTenants can only be compensated for the improvements \nif the NLTB grants prior approval of the improvements. \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\napplicable to Indo-Fijian farmers but not to indigenous Fijians. The Asian Development Bank's \ninternational  consultant has  pointed  out  that  if  the  new  lease  consideration  is  to  be applied,  it \nshould  be  applied  to  all  farmers  indiscriminately  and  without  reference  to  their  ethnic \nbackground. The practice of selectively applying the new lease consideration encouraged more \nindigenous Fijians to enter into farming, as without the inclusion of a new lease consideration \nthey can obtain leases on more favorable terms than Indo-Fijians. The banks lend to farmers to \nfinance the new lease consideration. \n \nThe first ALTA leases began to expire in 1997, 30 years after the legislation became \n4. \neffective (Table A2.2). In many cases, incoming indigenous Fijian farmers have commenced \nfarming. However, much land with expired leases remains unused, and NLTB\u2019s 2002 annual \nreport notes that this is partly due to disputes within the landowning groups.  \n \n\nTable A2.2: Expiry and Renewal of Agricultural Leases, 1997\u20132001 \n\n \n\nYear \n\nCane \nFarms \n\nNo. of \nExpiring  \nLeases \n\nNot Resolved \n\n \nNo. \n\n \n% \n\nReside\nntial \n\nLeases to New \nTenants/Landowner \nOther \nFarms \n30\n56\n138\n105\n12\n341\n\nCane \nFarms \n34\n111\n496\n473\n17\n1,131\n\nTotal \nNo. \n\nRenewed to Sitting Tenants \nResi-\ndential\n6\n7\n56\n25\n1\n95\n\nOther \nFarms \n9 \n9 \n86 \n30 \n51 \n185 \n\n51\n60\n487\n372\n194\n1,164\n\nTotal %\n54.3\n29.4\n31.6\n19.2\n43.9\n27.6\n\n2.1\n5.4\n20.9\n37.9\n43.7\n29.9\n\n17 \n54 \n241 \n115 \n14 \n441 \n\n36 \n44 \n345 \n317 \n142 \n884 \n\n2\n11\n322\n735\n193\n1,263\n\n94 \n1997 \n204 \n1998 \n1,541 \n1999 \n1,940 \n2000 \n442 \n2001 \n    Total \n4,221 \nSource: Native Land Trust Board.  \n \nOf  a  total  of  13,141  ALTA  leases,  the  largest  number  of  leases  expired  in  1999  and \n5. \n2000.  In  2000,  1,940  leases  expired  but  only  19%  were  renewed  to  sitting  tenants.  The  large \nnumber  of  not  resolved  leases  can  be  attributed  to  uncertainties  about  renewals,  with \nlandowners  reluctant  to  renew  leases  under  ALTA  when  better  terms  could  become  available \nunder the Native Land Trust Act. The economic pressure on tenants and landlords to renew has \ncaused a substantial increase in the rate of renewal, and NLTB\u2019s 2002 annual report notes that \nthe  clarification  of  legal  uncertainties  resulted  in  the  renewal  of  some  400  expired  leases  in \nSeaqaqa.  The  rate  of  renewal  is  expected  to  increase,  although  a  continuing  level  of \nnonrenewals  will  occur  to  meet  demand  by  members  of  the  landowning  communities  to  enter \ninto farming to improve their livelihoods. \n \n6. \nDuring  the  6-year  project  implementation  period,  some  2,800  ALTA  leases  will  expire, \nbut most of the leases will probably be renewed as uncertainties are resolved and market forces \nencourage agreements. This trend is consistent with current political dialogue to resolve issues \nand Government policy:  \n\nFinding an amicable solution for land issues will facilitate purposeful development \nof  land  ......

A  market  friendly  land  model  that \nensures  mataqali  landowners  receive  market  based  land  rental  income; \nguarantees  security  of  tenancy;  and  generates  a  closer  relationship  between \nlandowners and tenants, is required.\u201d1 \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1 Government of the Fiji Islands. 2002.

(Parliamentary Paper no. 72). \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\nB. \n\nLand Availability \n\n8. \nThe system of farming for the past 30 years has been based on farm areas of about 4 ha \nwith a modicum of mechanization. While high prices yielded good returns to farmers, they also \nallowed a change from family farming to widespread use of imported labor. Sugarcane cutting \ngangs  are  now  mostly  formed  from  outside  the  farming  community,  generally  from  traditional \nvillages and often from the outer islands. The Fijian sugar industry includes 17,000 sugarcane \ncutters,  13,000  from  outside  sugarcane  farming,  and  under  the  off-farm  and  rural  financial \nservices components of the Project many of these will lose seasonal sugar employment, but will \ngain from the more labor-intensive needs of diversified farming.  \n \n9. \nIn 1993, the sugarcane area peaked at just below 80,000 ha, but by 2001 this had fallen \nto 65,000 ha out of 96,000 ha registered. In the expansion phase up to 1993, some land was \nregistered  to  sugarcane  growers  on  steep  slopes  with  shallow  soils,  and  such  use  is \nenvironmentally  unsound.  Table  A2.3  shows  the  distribution  of  registered  sugarcane  land  in \nterms of topography. \n \n\nTable A2.3: Registered Sugarcane Land Topography  \n\nFlat \n\nTotal \n\nSteep \n\nRolling \n\nVery Steep \n\n11,162\n31.73\n6,412\n22.64\n1,607\n24.91\n13,359\n30.31\n32,540\n28.54\n\n \nMill Area \nLautoka  Hectares \n  Percentage of Total  \nRarawai   Hectares                   \n  Percentage of Total \nPenang  Hectares \n  Percentage of Total \nLabasa   Hectares \n  Percentage of Total \nTotal Industry   Hectares \n  Percentage of Total \nSource:  Fiji Sugar Commission. \n \n10.  Most of the land, some 80%, is flat or rolling and is satisfactory for growing sugarcane \nand other arable crops. Current practices using bullocks, horses, and manual labor also allow \nsugarcane  to  be  grown  on  steep  and  very  steep  slopes,  and  satisfactory  yields  are  often \nobtained  on  this  terrain.  However,  evidence  indicates  that  soil  conservation  measures  are  not \nalways practiced, for example, with furrows running down the slopes. \n \n\n35,181\n100\n28,319\n100\n6,452\n100\n44,070\n100\n114,022\n100\n\n4,156\n11.81\n4,283\n15.12\n1,050\n16.27\n7,385\n16.76\n16,874\n14.8\n\n19,624\n55.78\n15,200\n53.67\n3,749\n58.11\n19,583\n44.44\n58,156\n51\n\n239 \n0.68 \n2,424 \n8.56 \n46 \n0.71 \n3,743 \n8.49 \n6,452 \n5.66 \n\n1. \n\nSugarcane Growing Potential \n\n \n11. \nSome  discussions  of  restructuring  suggest  that  sugarcane  yields  will  increase  from  50 \nmetric tons/hectare (t/ha) to 55 t/ha and that the 64,000 ha under sugarcane would yield a sugar \nharvest of 3.5 million t. However, farms are unlikely to be able to survive on such low yields as \nsugarcane  prices  fall.  Suitable  flat  and  rolling  land  available  within  milling  zones  totals  some \n90,000 ha, so even with modest  yield improvements sufficient land appears to be available to \nmeet production requirements. Sugarcane yields have been relatively static at about 52 t/ha, but \nthe Sugarcane Research Centre reports much higher potential yields, as shown in Table A2.4. \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nTable A2.4: Potential Sugarcane Yields \n\n \n\nCrop \nPlant \nRatoon \nPlant \nRatoon \nPlant \nRatoon \n\nYield (t/ha) \n125 \n  95 \n  95 \n  80 \n  90 \n  80 \n\nAve. P+3R \n \n102.5 \n \n  83.8 \n \n  82.5 \n  92.0 \n\nSoil Type \nGood deep soils normally found on flat land and \neminently suitable for growing sugarcane \nMedium soils normally found on flat and rolling \nland and suitable for growing sugarcane. \nPoorer soils normally found on rolling and steep \nland and less suitable for growing sugarcane \n      Weighted average \nNote: The average (P+3R) assumes a 4 year cycle with the higher yield in the first year of planting \nfollowed by 3 years harvesting the lower yielding ratoon crops. \nSource: Sugarcane Research Centre. \n \n12.  \nThe  potential  yield  of  land  suitable  for  sugarcane  is  92  t/ha  and  Fiji  Islands  could \nproduce  6.4  million  t  of  sugarcane  per  year.  These  results  are  obtained  in  closely  supervised \nagronomy  trials  and  farmers  cannot  generally  achieve  such  yields.  Nevertheless,  an  average \nyield  in  excess  of  70  t/ha  should  be  achievable,  and  an  average  of  3,643  farmers  have \nexceeded this yield over the past 7 years. At this yield, 50,000 ha would satisfy projected mill \ndemand. \n \n\n2. \n\nSugarcane Price Projections \n\n \n13.  \nLand  availability  and  potential  yields  suggest  substantial  scope  for  a  continuing,  viable \nsugarcane  farming  sector  after  restructuring  to  respond  to  changes  in  the  European  Union \nprices  and  the  need  to  supply  sugarcane  competitively  at  world  market  prices.  However,  the \nprice  structure  after  restructuring  remains  uncertain,  with  stakeholders  unable  to  agree  on \npricing. In this situation, estimates have been based on the range of low price projections made \nby millers. \n \nThe  Fiji  Sugar  Corporation  (FSC)  has  not  made  a  single  projection  but  a  number  of \n14. \nprojections  at  varying  degrees  of  formality.  An  early  proposal  suggested  a  price  of  F$32/t \n(US$16.4/t)  of  sugarcane  paid  on  delivery,  but  a  number  of  other  suggestions  have  been \nfloated.  Projections  presented  to  the  Sugar  Restructure  Steering  Committee  combine  a  cash \nprice  with  savings  on  lease  rental  and  transport,  while  other  projections  supplied  by  FSC \nindicate  other  prices.  Table  A2.5  gives  the  projected  sugarcane  price  as  presented  to  the \nRestructure Committee and FSC\u2019s latest estimates. \n \n\nTable A2.5: Projected Sugarcane Prices, 2003\u20132009  \n(F$/t) \n 2003\n51.4\n51.3\n\n 2004\nCategory \n52.9\nPrices Presented to Restructuring Committee \n41.5\nFiji Sugar Corporation Price \nNote: Sugarcane prices include the costs of land rental and transport. \nSources: Ministry of Agriculture, Sugar, and Land Resettlement; Fiji Sugar Corporation. \n \n15.  \nThe price paid for sugarcane will ultimately be determined by the price of sugar, so the \nprojected  sugarcane  prices  are  indicative  rather  than  definitive.  A  review  of  current  farm \noperations  suggests  that  marginal  farmers\u2019  income  starts  to  become  negative  at  F$45/t \n(US$23.1/t),  and  that  some  farms  remain  profitable  at  F$31.5/t  (US$16.2/t),  although  at  much \nlower net incomes. \n\n2009\n47.1\n37.4\n\n2008\n47.3\n39.8\n\n2007\n47.2\n42.5\n\n2006\n46.5\n43.8\n\n2005\n53.0\n49.0\n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nFarmer Numbers and Production \n\n \n16.  \nThe response to reductions in EU prices for sugar will include some farmers leaving the \nindustry either because returns are too low for their farms to be viable or because sugar ceases \nto  be  a  viable  use  of  farm  resources,  and  some  farmers  may  use  good  land  to  grow  higher-\nvalue  crops.  The  Project  design  assumes  that  farmers  who  remain  in  sugar  and  prosper  will \nimprove yields to sustain viability. \n  \nAs  with  prices,  uncertainty  about  the  amount  of  sugarcane  required  by  millers  is \n17.  \nconsiderable  until  restructuring  has  been  agreed  on.  Once  again,  projections  given  to  the \nRestructure  Committee  based  on  FSC  data  differ  from  other  models  being  used  by  FSC.  The \nformer  calls  for  3.4  million  t  by  2007,  while  the  latter  assumes  2.8  million  t  throughout.  FSC \naccepts that the mills\u2019 capacity will be 3.6 million t after rehabilitation and does not explain how \nleaving  0.8  million  t  of  capacity  unutilized  would  produce  either  financial  or  economic  benefits \nwhen all sugar is produced at world prices.  \n \n18.  \nThis  study  uses  the  figures  presented  to  the  Restructure  Committee  and  extends  that \nprojection from 2007 to reach full capacity utilization in 2008. The projection in Table A2.6 also \nassumes an average yield of 72 t/ha, some 20 t/ha less than the Sugarcane Research Centre\u2019s \naverages on the same land types.  \n \n\nTable A2.6: Projections and Farmer Numbers, 2003\u20132008  \n\n 2004\n61,500\n47.2\n2,900\n75.0\n81.0\n8.67\n303.7\n\n 2005\n59,500\n53.8\n3,200\n75.0\n85.0\n8.69\n371.7\n\n 2006\n56,000\n60.7\n3,400\n75.0\n85.0\n8.22\n394.9\n\n 2007\n53,000\n64.2\n3,400\n82.5\n85.0\n8.0 2\n394.9\n\n2008\n50,000\n72.0\n3,600\n84.0\n85.0\n8.15\n441.7\n\n 2003\n64,000\n43.8\n2,800\n73.0\n81.0\n9.58\n293.2\n21,371\n17,297\n3.7\n4,074\n\nCategory \nHectares Harvested (\u2018000) \nYield (t/ha) \nTotal Tons of Cane (\u2018000) \nOverall Time Efficiency (%) \nOverall Recovery (%) \nTC/TS (t cane/t sugar)  \nTotal Tons of Sugar 94NT (\u2018000)  \nTotal Number of Farms \nTotal Number of Productive Farms \nAverage Farm Size (ha) \nNumber of Farmers Exiting \nha = hectare, t/ha = metric tons/hectare. \nNote: 4,074 non-productive farms, in the 21,371 total registered in 2003, are excluded from the projections \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates. \n   \n19.  \nIn this projection, to meet the mill requirement of 3.6 million t of sugarcane by 2008 at \nyields  of  72  t/ha,  12,500  farmers  would  be  required  with  an  average  harvest  area  of  4  ha  per \nfarm. This means that an estimated 4,798 farmers would exit sugarcane farming activities. \n \n20. The numbers are indicative at this stage and are considered as a worst case scenario. The \nreduction in harvested area is dictated by decisions on the capacity of the mills, reflecting a mill-\nconstrained  scenario,  and  is  not  in  response  to  either  the  availability  or  productivity  of  land. \nAlternative scenarios are possible by projecting investments in increased mill capacity to better \nmatch land availability and potential yields. Given that either scenario requires viability at world \nmarket prices, no credible sugar market volume constraint exists. \n \n\n16,622\n3.7\n676\n\n15,658\n3.8\n964\n\n14,000\n4.0\n1,658\n\n13,250\n4.0\n750\n\n12,500\n4.0\n750\n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE FIJIAN AGRICULTURE SECTOR \n\n34 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nFunding \nSource \n \nADB \n\n \nAusAID \n \n \n \n \n\n \nEuropean \nUnion \n \nFAO \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nProject Title \n\n \nSigatoka Valley \nDevelopment Project \n \nAgricultural Development \nProject \n \nBeef Farming \n \nRice Development \n \nSoil and Crop Evaluation \nProject \n \nMicro Pineapple \nDevelopment Project \n \nSmall-Scale Dairy Unit \nDevelopment \n \nTelefood Programme \n\n \nNZAID \n\n \nBeef Farming \nDevelopment \n \n\nAmount (US$ \nmillion) \nGrant        Loan \n\n \n4.4 \n\n \n20.0 \n\nYear \nApproved \n \n1986 \n\n \n0 \n\n \n0 \n\n \n10.0 \n \n5.0 \n \n2.0 \n\n \n1.2 \n\n \n4.0 \n\n \n0.1 \n\n \n5.0 \n\n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n0 \n\n \n0 \n\n \n0 \n\n \n0 \n\n \n0 \n\n \nActivities \n\n \nRural infrastructure, agribusiness, \nand agricultural support services \n \nSector restructuring, policy reform, \nand institutional development \n \nSmall beef farm development \n \nIrrigated rice development \n \nResearch development support \n\n \nSmall farmers pineapple \ndevelopment for export  \n \nSmall dairy farm development \n\n \nStrengthening of the subsistence \nfarming sector \n \nGroup/community-based beef \nfarming support \n \n\n \n1986 \n\n \n1978 \n \n1985 \n \n1980 \n\n \n1992 \n\n \n2003 \n\n \n2003 \n\n \n1978 \n\n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AusAID = Australian Agency for International Development, FAO = Food and \nAgriculture Organization, NZAID = New Zealand Agency for International Development. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n35\n\n \nDesign \nSummary \nGoal \n \nProtect and improve the \nstandard of living of rural \npeople at risk because of  \nsugar sector restructuring \n\nPurpose \n \nIncrease sustainable \nlivelihoods, on- and off- \nfarm, to at least replace \nthose lost during the \ncourse of sugar sector \nrestructuring \n\nOutputs \n \n1.

The  country\u2019s  political instability,  the  land  tenure \nsituation, and the sugar industry\u2019s dominance without quality incentives have contributed to the \nlimited  development  of  commercial  agriculture,  private  sector  support  services,  and \nagribusiness investment. \n \n2. \nBusiness models relevant to the agriculture sector include joint ventures between large \ncorporations and indigenous clan (mataqali) landowners (e.g., in forestry and mining), contract \nfarming  between  agribusiness  and  farmers  (e.g.,  the  tobacco  and  sugar  industries),  and \nindividual  farm  enterprises  managing  marketing.  Agribusiness  and  marketing  development  are \ncritical \nfor  commercial  development.  Strengthening  marketing  chains  and  marketing \nperformance  both  in  sugarcane  areas  and  beyond,  including  the  outer  islands,  requires \nimproving  agribusiness  skills  and  capacity  to  promote  profitable  enterprises  in  the  sector. \nPrivate sector support services are critical to achieving this objective.  \n  \n3. \nThe development of commercial agriculture, including agribusinesses, farm enterprises, \nand marketing and other commercial agricultural services, is constrained by (i) the shortage of \nspecific  technical  skills;  (ii)  the  limited  commercial  knowledge  and  the  difficulties  of  enforcing \ncontracts;  (iii)  the  shortage  and  unreliability  of  local  raw  material  supplies  and  the  resultant \ndependence  on  imports;  (iv)  the  limited  capacity  to  supply  high-quality  exports  and  to  cater  to \ndomestic  tourist  markets;  (vi)  the  lack  of  production,  trade,  management,  and  marketing \nexperience; (vi) the limited local processing facilities; (vii) the weakness of commercial networks \nthroughout the country; (viii) the inadequacies of policy and legislation; and (ix) the absence of \npolicy and fiscal instruments to stimulate investment in the sector, especially in private research \nand development, and in advisory information services.    \n \n4. \nThe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  field  findings  and  the  workshop \ndiscussions  with  stakeholders  identified  a  number  of  areas  of  agribusiness  for  development. \nThose  with  potential  include  small  and  medium  feed  processing  and  drying  facilities,  livestock \nfinishing  feedlots,  year-round  supply  and  marketing  of  pineapples,  aquaculture  hatcheries  and \noutgrowing facilities, neem organic pesticide and textile manufacture, Stevia artificial sweetener \nproduction, and joint ventures in smallholder eucalyptus  agro forestry. Investment opportunities \nin services include small and medium post harvest grading, packing, and cool-storage linked to \ncollection  and  distribution  facilities;  contract  machinery  services,  especially  for  harvesting  field \ncrops;  product  development  and  marketing  services  (e.g.,  based  on  indigenous  fruit,  nuts, \nnutraceuticals,  oils,  essences,  and  spices);  and  advisory  information  services.  The  major \nconstraint cited in most cases is not lack of access to capital, but limited human and institutional \ncapacity.  The  TA  would  facilitate  the  development  of  proposed  agribusiness  opportunities  and \ncapacity. \n \n5. \nState-owned  agribusinesses  have  failed  to  sustain  or  stimulate  the  sector  because  of \nlimited  accountability,  lack  of  performance-based  management,  and  limited  sophistication  of \ncommercial  practices.  The  Government  has  an  important  role  in  facilitating  and  providing \nservices  to  the  private  sector.  The  TA  would  provide  assistance  to  identify  potential  policy \noptions, structures, and processes to improve private sector performance. In terms of services, \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nthe  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Sugar  and  Land  Resettlement  (MASLR)  divisions  and  agencies \nresponsible  for  commerce,  market  information,  import  and  export  regulation,  research,  and \nextension services do not have forums and processes whereby the needs and priorities of the \nprivate  agriculture  sector  are  periodically  identified  and  addressed.  To  stimulate  both  the \ndemand  for  and  the  supply  of  services,  industry  organizations  must  have  a  role  in  setting \npriorities and contributing to their achievement. The TA would help to institutionalize interaction \nwith industry advisory forums to support the development of private agricultural services. \n \nB. \n\nScope \n\n6. \nThe  TA  would  strengthen  commercial  agriculture  development  by  (i)  supporting \nagribusinesses,  industry  organizations,  farmer  groups,  and  farm  landowners;  (ii)  helping  to \nstrengthen  the  capacity,  linkages,  strategy,  and  commercial  operations  of  farm  business \nadvisory services; (iii) assisting the Government, industry organizations, and agribusinesses to \nimplement  their  strategic  goals  of  becoming  performance-oriented,  customer-focused  entities; \n(iv) facilitating marketing development by helping to orient trade- and market-related legislation, \ninformation,  services,  protocols,  standards,  and  commercial  relationships;  (v)  facilitating \ninstitutional  linkages  and  the  formation  of  commercial  networks  between  the  Fijian  agriculture \nsector  and  agricultural  industries,  organizations,  and  programs  active  in  the  region  and  target \nmarkets;  (vi)  supporting  training  in  agribusiness  and  agro-processing;  and  (vii)  raising \nawareness of regional business opportunities for local entrepreneurs and industry organizations. \n \n7. \nIn conjunction with the loan, the TA will provide advisory assistance to the private sector \nfor  developing  agribusiness  opportunities  through  studies,  workshops,  and  training;  identifying \nappropriate  technologies  and  quality  systems;  and  developing  linkages  with  markets.  Support \nfrom  the  TA  will  include  facilitating  agribusiness  study  tours  and  trade  missions.  The  TA  will \nfacilitate institutionalizing interaction between and among industry organizations and MASLR\u2019s \nresearch and advisory information services to ensure that the private sector takes a leading role \nin  prioritizing  objectives  for  support  services  and  can  help  achieve  those  objectives.  Policy \npapers and programming studies would be prepared to help the Government review trade- and \nmarket-related  legislative  obstacles and  identify  appropriate  policy  instruments  and  fiscal  tools \n(e.g., tax incentives for research and development) to stimulate the development of commercial \nagriculture  and  support  services.  Advisory  assistance  would  be  provided  to  MASLR  to \ncorporatize  the  Fiji  College  of  Agriculture  (FCA),  develop  accreditation  for  farm  business \nadvisers,  and  develop  fee-for-service  packages  that  could  be  transferred  to  private  sector \nproviders.  \n \nThe TA would also strengthen and expand commercial information services for farmers \n8. \nand  agribusinesses.  This  would \nindustry \norganizations, and other agencies to develop media for providing relevant information to farmers \nand  agribusinesses.  Content  will  include  information  about  products  and  markets,  farm \nmanagement  issues,  production  and  post  harvest  techniques,  industry  activities  and  events, \nresearch  and  extension  activities  and  reports, sources  of expertise  and  contractors,  and  other \ninstitutional  sources  of  information.  The  TA  would  help  develop  web  sites,  online  access \ncenters,  newsletters,  radio  programs,  visual  media,  and  mobile  information  units.  The  TA \nFramework is given in Table A10.1. \n \nC. \n\nEstimated Costs and Financing \n\nto  MASLR,  agribusinesses, \n\ninvolve  support \n\nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at US$875,000 equivalent, of which US$423,000 is \n9. \nthe  foreign  exchange  cost  and  US$452,000  is  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  has \nasked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  $600,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  Japan \nSpecial  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan  to  finance  the  total  foreign  exchange  cost \n\n\f \n \n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n53 \n\nand US$177,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance the balance \nof  the  local  currency  cost,  equivalent  to  US$275,000,  by  providing  office  accommodation  and \ncounterpart agency staff as appropriate. Detailed costs are given in Table A10.2. MASLR will be \nthe  executing  agency  for  the  TA.  The  national  steering  committee  and  the  divisional  steering \ncommittees will review the progress of the TA and will provide the necessary guidance. The TA \nwill  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  24  months.  It  envisages  that  an  estimated  total  of  20 \nperson-months  of  international  and  7  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be \nrequired. This will cover an international agribusiness and agricultural institutions consultant for \n10  person-months,  and  for  unspecified  support,  10  person-months  of  international  consulting, \nand  7  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  (e.g.,  trade  legislation,  media,  marketing,  and \nagribusiness  research/development).  Terms  of  reference  for  these  specialized  areas  will  be \ndrafted during project implementation. Individual consultants will be selected according to ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n10. \nProcurement of equipment and supplies will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. During the implementation period, the consultants will submit an inception report, \nregular monthly updates, a draft final report at least one month prior to completion, and a final \nreport  upon  completion  that  incorporates  the  comments  provided  by  both  ADB  and  the \nGovernment. The TA is expected to commence in April 2005 and is expected to be completed \nby March 2007. \n \nD. \n\nTerms of Reference for the International Consultant \n\n11. \n  \n\nThe agribusiness and agricultural institutions specialist (10 person-months) will: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\nin  collaboration  with \n\nhelp the project coordination unit strengthen agriculture sector organizations and \nMASLR to ensure participation by and representation of agribusinesses, farmers, \nand other key stakeholders in structures and processes;

Yes. \n\nA.  \nSector identified as a national policy in  \ncountry poverty analysis?  Yes. \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the Fiji Islands: \n \nMore  than  half  the  people  live  in  rural  areas  and  agriculture  is  the  mainstay  of  the  economy  in  terms  of \nproduction  value,  employment  and  income  generation,  and  subsistence.  Some  76,555  (56%)  households,  or \nabout 385,000 people, live in rural areas. Within the five sugarcane belt provinces of Ba, Nadroga, Ra, Macuata, \nand Cakaudrove, an estimated 90,000 Indo-Fijian family members rely in whole or in part on sugarcane farming \nand/or  sugarcane  cutting  for  their  household  incomes.  In  addition,  some  104,000  indigenous  Fijian  family \nmembers rely on sugarcane farming in whole or in part for their communal rental income, with perhaps 13,500 \nworking as seasonal sugarcane cutters and an increasing number engaging in farming as incoming tenants. In \ntotal,  about  300,000  people  depend  directly  or  indirectly  on  agriculture,  especially  on  activities  related  to \nsugarcane farming. Current  estimates indicate that more than  50% of the people in the Northern  and Western \ndivisions  subsist  below  the  household  poverty  threshold  of  F$6,500/year  (US$3,340  equivalent).  A  recent \npoverty assessment of hardship by the Asian Development Bank indicated that 35% to 40% of the population is \nlikely to have incomes below the poverty line. \n \nReductions  in  EU  preferential  prices  for  sugar  will  substantially  reduce  sugarcane  prices  and  incomes  for \ncontinuing  and  incoming  farmers,  sugarcane  cutters,  and  landowners.  Their  poverty  will  increase  without \ndiversification  of  the  rural  economy  away  from  sugar  to  higher-value  crops  and  off-farm  employment,  both  to \nsupport farm family incomes and to provide alternative incomes for exiting farmers unable to find new leasehold \nfarms. The agricultural diversification and off-farm livelihood components directly address these needs, while the \nrural financial services activity allows communities on- and off-farm, as well as in traditional villages, to manage \ntheir financial resources to support livelihood activities. \n \nB. \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe latest official poverty analysis for Fiji Islands was undertaken by UNDP and published in 1997. The analysis \nwas  based  on  the  1990/91  HIES.  New  HIES  were  undertaken  by  the  Fiji  Bureau  of  Statistics  for  the  urban \ncenters  in  2002/03  and  the  rural  areas  in  2003/04.  The  data  from  these  two  household  surveys  is  now  being \nanalyzed  by  the  Government  with  assistance  from  ADB.  Revised  estimates  of  urban  poverty  have  been \ncomplied and are now being reviewed by the Government, whereas estimates of rural poverty are expected to \nbe  completed  by  mid-2005.  In  2003,  a  participatory  assessment  of  hardship  was  undertaken  by  means  of \nconsultative  workshops  and  focus-group  discussions  with  around  twenty  communities  spread  throughout  the \ncountry. These consultations  included communities from  all ethnic backgrounds in  both  urban and rural areas, \nand involved women, church and youth groups, as well as traditional leaders and nongovernment organizations. \nThese participatory assessments provided qualitative information on the people's perceptions of the causes and \ncharacteristics  of  poverty  and  hardship  in  there  respective  situations,  as  well  as  their  needs  and  priorities  for \npoverty alleviation interventions.  \n \nC.  \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n\nParticipation Process \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\n Gender and Development \n\nThe  consultative  process  covered  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders,  including  central  government  and  local \ngovernment staff; international agencies; nongovernment organization (NGO) staff; state-owned enterprise and \nparastatal  staff;  and  private  sector  individuals,  including  farmers,  clan  landowners,  traditional  leaders,  small \nbusiness  operators,  and  displaced  tenants.  The  process  of  consultation  with  stakeholders  will  be  important \nduring implementation, and community-organizing NGOs will help ensure high beneficiary participation in project \nimplementation. Stakeholders will be represented on the national and divisional steering committees. \n \nD. \nGender  issues  have  been  integrated  with  the  project  design.  Women  have  generally  played  little  part  in \ntraditional sugarcane farming, but will play an increased role in diversified agriculture, including in such areas as \nhorticulture, floriculture,  and small livestock;  in the  development of a  business approach to farming;  and in the \ndevelopment  of  off-farm  livelihoods,  including  handicrafts,  small-scale  processing,  and  micro-enterprises.  The \ncommunity-organizing  NGOs,  which  will  include  a  substantial  percentage  of  women  organizers,  will  seek  to \nensure  effective  participation  by  women  in  project  activities.  Vocational  training  will  involve  women  in  training \ncourses  and  include  course  specifically  targeting  women\u2019s  income-generating  skills.  Community-based \nmicrofinance institutions will also seek to include women in savings and credit activities. \n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n57 \n\n \n \nPlan Required \nA summary resettlement \nframework is appended to \nthis report based on the \nAsian Development \nBank\u2019s  Policy on \nInvoluntary Resettlement \nand Handbook on \nResettlement: A Guide to \nGood Practice.  \nNo \n\n \n \n \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\n \nE.  \n \n \nSubject \nResettlement  Not significant \n\nSignificant, \nNot Significant, \nUncertain, None \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nThe limited civil works focus on the \nrehabilitation of existing roads and training \nstructures and will have no resettlement \nimpact.  \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\nNone \n\nLabor \n\nNone \n\nAffordability \n\nNot significant \n\n \nNone \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n \n \n \n \n\nThe indigenous Fijians are the majority ethnic \ngroup and the Project targets their benefit \nequity as landowners, farmers, and off-farm \nworkers and entrepreneurs. The Project \ndesign included full consultation with \ntraditional chiefs, clan groups, individual \nFijians, and entry farmers regarding their \nneeds and aspirations. \nThe Project addresses the labor/livelihood \nissues created outside the Project in relation \nto sugar sector restructuring and lease \nrenewals. The Project will help mill workers \nand sugarcane cutters develop alternative \nlivelihoods. \nThe Project will increase the supply of \nconsumer goods and services by supporting \nthe reallocation of resources from sugarcane \nfarming. The rehabilitation of rural farm \naccess roads will help reduce retail prices. \nRequirements for cost recovery and private \nsector and farmers\u2019 participation involve \nminimum risk. \n \nNone  \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\n \nNo \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nFINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES \n\n \nA. \n\nQuantification of Benefits \n\n \n\n1. \n\n Economic Analysis \n\nAgricultural Diversification \n\n1. \nA  significant  proportion  of  the  benefits  arising  from  the  agricultural  diversification \ncomponent are directly quantifiable in terms of the increase in value added expected to result \nfrom the investment. A proportion of the benefits derived from the rural financial services (RFS) \ncomponent can be measured in terms of increased agricultural output. However, other benefits \nof this component and the off-farm livelihoods (OFL) component are considered too speculative \nfor  meaningful  quantification,  as  the  outcomes  cannot  be  predicted  with  accuracy.  The \nstrengthening of the National Center for Small and Micro Enterprise Development (NCSMED) to \nmeet the requirements of the Project will enhance this fledgling institution\u2019s capability to serve \nthe  small  and  micro-enterprise  sector  throughout  Fiji  Islands.  Households  in  and  outside  the \nproject  area  will  benefit  from  a  stronger  microfinance  institutional  structure  that  better  meets \ntheir  financial  service  needs.  The  strengthening  of  the  quarantine  services,  vital  for  the \nagricultural  diversification  of  the  sugarcane  growing  areas,  will  provide  market  access  for \nproducts  grown  throughout  Fiji  Islands.  Agricultural  extension  and  research,  strengthened  to \nmeet the needs of farmers in the project area, will be better able to serve agricultural industries \nthroughout  Fiji  Islands. However,  none  of  these  flow-on  benefits  are  included  in  the  economic \nanalysis.  It  is  envisaged  that  substantial  benefits  will  arise  from  impacts  and  replication  of \nproject activities outside the project area. \n \nB. \n \n \n \n2. \nA  diversified  4-hectare  (ha)  farm  is  modeled  for  the  future  with  project  case.  The  land \ncapability of this model farm mirrors the land capability distribution of the industry as a whole. \nThe model farm grows  a combination of field and horticulture crops on 80% of the area, uses \nsome of its marginal land for agro forestry and livestock (6%), and uses the remainder (14%) for \na house site and home garden. Such a diversified farm would be the product of the successful \nimplementation of the agricultural diversification component. \n \nThe  estimated  annual  gross  margin  from  the  diversified  farm  model  is  F$11,297 \n3. \n(US$5,793 equivalent). Thus if all the 19,200 ha available for diversified farming adopted similar \ndiversified farming systems,1 the economic farm gate value added in the future with project case \nis  estimated  at  F$57.2  million  per  year  (US$29.4  million  equivalent).  The  estimated  annual \ngross margin for the existing representative sugarcane farm is F$2,070 (US$1,062 equivalent). \nThe  economic  farm  gate  value  added  from  the  19,200  ha  under  the  present  case  is  F$11.9 \nmillion  per  year  (US$6.1  million  equivalent).  Thus  the  incremental  economic  farm  gate  value \nadded  from  complete  diversification  is  estimated  at  F$45.3  million  per  year  (US$23.3  million \nequivalent),  i.e.  the  full  19,200  ha  is  developed  from  the  present  case  use  to  the  future  with \nproject case use. \n \n4. \nThe  existing  representative  sugar  farm  model  is  based  on  a  sugarcane  price  of \nF$50/metric  ton  (t)  (US$25.7/t  equivalent).  However  at  the  projected  sugarcane  price  of  only \nF$37/t  (US$19.0  equivalent),  the  annual  gross  margin  of  the  farm  falls  to  less  than  F$1,000 \n(US$514  equivalent)  unless  sugarcane  yields  can  be  significantly  improved.  In  these \ncircumstances,  the  value  added  if  the  19,200  ha  remain  under  sugarcane  is  F$5.2  million  per \n\n                                                 \n1  Appendix  2,  Table  A2.6  projects  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  productive  farms  from  17,297  to  12,500  so  the \nequivalent of 4,797 farms are projected to be available for diversified agriculture. At a 4ha average farm size this is \nabout 19,200ha (4,797 x 4 = 19,188ha). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n       Appendix 12          59 \n\n \n \n \nyear  (US$2.7  million  equivalent)  when  the  economic  price  for  labor  is  used.  Thus  the  future \nincremental  economic  value  added  from  complete  diversification  is  F$52  million  per  year \n(US$27 million equivalent) at the farm gate level, i.e. the full 19,200 ha is developed from the \nfuture without project case use to the future with project case use. \n \n5. \nValue-added benefits will accrue from marketing the produce from the farm gate to the \nfree  on  board  level  for  exports  or  to  the  wholesale  level  for  import  substitution  products.  The \nmarketing value added is approximated at 20% of the farm gate value added. Thus adding the \nmarketing  value,  the  estimated  total  incremental  economic  value  is  F$62.5  million  per  year \n(US$32.1 million equivalent). \n \n6. \nIf  all  19,200  ha  are  converted  to  intensive  diversified  agriculture  as  described  in  the \nrepresentative  farm  model,  the  value  of  production  would  be  well  in  excess  of  the  estimated \nvalue  of  the  additional  readily  obtainable  markets.  However,  the  analysis  shows  that  markets \nare unlikely to constrain the diversified farm output.  \n \n7. \nDifferent  adoption  rates  for  diversified  agriculture  are  analyzed  in  terms  of  their \nthe  agricultural \neconomic \ndiversification,  RFS,  OFL,  and  project  coordination  components.  The  analysis  assumes  that \ndiversification  practices  represented  in  the  farm  model  will  be  adopted  over  a  10-year  period, \ncommencing in year 2. Rates of adoption ranging from 15% to 100% are analyzed. In the future, \nsome farms will be fully diversified along the lines of the representative farm model, others will \npartially adopt the proposed diversification practices, while others will not adopt the practices at \nall. The sum of these various permutations will represent the overall rate of adoption.  \n \nGiven the unlikely scenario of 100% adoption of the diversification practices, the Project \n8. \ngenerates an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 58% and an economic net present value \n(ENPV) of F$170 million at a 12% opportunity cost of capital. At 30% adoption of the indicative \nfarm model, the EIRR is 19.1%. Table A12.1 shows the impact of different adoption rates. It is \nonly  when  the  adoption  rate  falls  below  about  20%  that  the  Project  is  no  longer  considered \neconomically viable (EIRR < 12%; ENPV < 0). The achievement of the minimum diversification \nadoption rate required for economic viability is well within the capability of the Project. \n \n\nimpact.  These  are  compared  with \n\nthe  economic  costs  of \n\nTable A12.1: Economic Rate of Return for Alternative Diversification Adoption Rates \n \n\nEIRR (%) \n\nENPV discounted at 12% (F$ m) \n\nRate of Adoption After 10 Years (%) \n100 \n  75 \n  50 \n  30 \n  25 \n  20 \n  15 \n  10 \n\n58.2 \n44.9 \n31.2 \n19.1 \n15.6 \n12.0 \n7.9 \n3.2 \n\n170.4 \n117.1 \n63.8 \n21.2 \n10.5 \n(0.1) \n(10.8) \n(21.5) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; ENPV = economic net present value. \nSource: Mission estimates. \n\n  \nThe  key  factors  that  will  determine  the  rate  of  adoption  are  (i)  sufficient  farmer \n9. \nconfidence in the land tenure system to make the required investments; (ii) availability of RFS \nfor project participants; (iii) success of the adaptive research and focused extension programs; \n(iv)  transformation  of  farms  into  commercial  businesses;  (v)  development  of  a  cadre  of  young \ncommercial farmers; and (vi) future sugar prices, yields, and production costs. \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\nRural Financial Services \n\n2. \n \n \n10. \nThe  availability  of  seasonal  finance  is  a  particular  need  for  high-value  diversification. \nThus  all  the  costs  of  the  RFS  component  have  been  attributed  to  the  benefits  of  agricultural \ndiversification. It is projected that lending to rural households will increase from 8% of farming \nhouseholds to 20% over the project period. However, the benefits of the RFS component extend \nwell  beyond  diversified  agriculture.  New  ventures  created  as  a  result  of  RFS  are  projected  to \ncontribute at least F$3.4 million (US$1.8 million equivalent) in value added each year.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOff-Farm Livelihoods \n\n \n11. \nThe OFL component involves two subcomponents. The first subcomponent focuses on \npromoting  small  and  micro-enterprises  and  the  second  is  directed  at  developing  vocational \ntraining.  The  benefits  are  expected  to  be  considerable,  but  are  difficult  to  predict  with  a \nmeaningful  degree  of  accuracy.  However,  an  indication  of  the  magnitude  of  these  potential \nbenefits  is  that  the  projected  1,200  small  and  micro  enterprises  established  by  beneficiaries \nwould generate annual income of about F$7.5 million (US$3.9 million equivalent). \n \n\n4. \n\nOverall Project \n\n \n12. \nTable  A12.2  compares  overall  project  costs  with  the  projected  benefits  derived  from \nagricultural  diversification.  Provision  is  also  made  for  the  benefits  from  rural  nonagricultural \nbusinesses  established  as  a  result  of  the  RFS  component.

The  analysis  assesses  the \nimpact of adverse changes in costs, benefits, and diversification adoption rates. Various rates of \nadoption, a 10% increase in the development costs, and a 10% decline in diversified farm gross \nmargins are simulated. The results of this sensitivity analysis are given in Table A12.3. It shows \nthat in the base case, a diversification adoption rate in excess of 20% is required for the Project \nto be viable (EIRR > 12%).  If project costs increase by 10% or the gross margins decrease by \n10%, then the minimum rate of adoption required for viability increases, but remains below 25%.  \n \n\nTable A12.3: Sensitivity Analysis  \n(percent) \n\nRate of Diversification \nAdoption After 10 Years \n\nBase Case \n\n10% Increase in \nProject Costs \n\n10% Decrease in \nGross Margins \n\n100 \n75 \n50 \n30 \n25 \n20 \n15 \n10 \n\n58.2 \n44.9 \n31.2 \n19.1 \n15.6 \n12.0 \n7.9 \n3.2 \n\n53.0 \n40.9 \n28.2 \n16.8 \n13.6 \n10.0 \n6.1 \n1.6 \n\nCombined Cost \nIncrease and Benefit \nDecrease \n47.8 \n36.8 \n25.1 \n14.4 \n11.4 \n8.0 \n4.3 \n(0.1) \n\n52.5 \n40.5 \n27.9 \n16.6 \n13.3 \n9.8 \n5.9 \n1.4 \n\n Financial Analysis \n\nSource: Mission estimates. \n \nAt  a  30%  adoption  rate,  a  10%  increase  in  costs  sees  the  EIRR  fall  from  19.1%  to \n14. \n16.8%, yielding a sensitivity index (SI) of 1.20. A 10% fall in gross margins at the same rate of \nadoption  sees  the  EIRR  fall  to  16.6%  (SI  =  1.32).  If  both  costs  rise  and  gross  margins  fall  by \n10%,  the  EIRR  falls  to  14.4%.  These  results  suggest  robust  viability  against  cost  and  gross \nmargin variances provided a reasonable rate of adoption is achieved. \n \nC.  \n \n \n \n15. \nRepresentative farm analyses show that farmers have sufficient incentives in the form of \nhigher  net  returns,  increased  labor  productivity  and  on-farm  productive  employment,  and \nincreased  cash  portion  of  farm  household  incomes  from  diversification  to  move  away  from \nsugarcane into vegetables, fruits, and double-cropped grains and pulses with appropriate post \nharvest processes.

These  estimates  are  derived  from  representative  farm  models  and  compared  with \nrepresentative existing sugarcane farms. The achievement of a 30% adoption rate is considered \nto be a realistic target. This would generate an estimated 630,000 person-days of employment, \nor  approximately  745,000  person-days  of  labor  less  than  the  current  sugarcane  farming \nsituation.  Part  of  this  shortfall  will  be  compensated  for  by  rural  off-farm  work  linked  to \ndiversification efforts. Post harvest handling, transportation, and input supply and maintenance \nactivities  for  diversified  agriculture  are  relatively  labor  intensive,  and  these  activities  are \nexpected to provide at least 25% of on-farm labor absorption of diversified farming. Thus about \n600,000 person-days of employment will need to be found outside diversified agriculture. This \ntranslates  to  around  2,400  full-time  job  equivalents  that  the  OFL  component  will  need  to \ngenerate to achieve parity with the current situation. This is seen as a reasonably modest target. \n \n\nTable A12.5: On-Farm Employment Generated by Agricultural Diversification \n\n \n\n  \n\nTotal payment to \nlabor (F$) \n\nArea \n(ha) \n19,200\n14,400\n12,480\n11,520\n9,600\n5,760\n\nTotal labor \n (person days) \n1,376,640 \n1,573,200 \n1,363,440 \n1,258,560 \n1,049,280 \n629,568 \n\nLabor used \n(person day/ha/yr) \n71.7 \n109.3 \n109.3 \n109.3 \n109.3 \n109.3 \n\n13,766,400\n15,732,000\n13,634,400\n12,585,600\n10,492,800\n6,295,700\n\nItem \nRepresentative existing cane farms \n75% adoption of diversification \n65% adoption  \n60% adoption  \n50% adoption  \n30% adoption \nSource: Mission estimates \n \n17. \nThe nature of employment in diversified agriculture is also qualitatively different from the \ncurrent  sugarcane-based  employment,  in  that  diversified  agriculture  jobs  are  less  seasonal  in \nnature and offer many more employment opportunities for women. In addition, the efficiency of \nlabor utilization is also likely to improve. Households are also provided with off-farm livelihood \nopportunities through the OFL and RFS components. The RFS component provides households \nwith  the  opportunity  to  save  and  provides  access  to  microfinance,  which  was  not  previously \navailable. Thus households will be able to mobilize resources for income generation, education, \nand  prudential  needs  more  efficiently.  Training  opportunities  will  be  made  more  accessible  to \ncommunities,  reducing  the  need  for  households  to  migrate  to  Suva  to  meet  their  education \nrequirements.  Overall  the  Project  is  expected  to  substantially  improve  the  well-being  of \nhouseholds and communities compared with the current situation.  \n \n \n \n18. \nThe  benefits  accruing  to  consumers  are  as  follows:  (i)  increased  availability  and  lower \nprices  of  staples  (root  crops,  pulses,  and  vegetables);  (ii)  higher-quality  fruits  and  vegetables \navailable  because  of  the  expansion  of  exports  and  tourism  sales  and  improved  post  harvest \nhandling;  and  (iii)  improved  nutrition  resulting  from  increased  consumption  of  fresh  fruits  and \nvegetables, pulses, and root crops. \n \nD.  \n \n19. \nThe Project is economically, financially, and socially viable. The main benefits imputed \ninto  the  analysis  are  based  on  agricultural  diversification.  These  diversification  benefits  are \nbased  on  identified  and  readily  obtained  markets.  The  adoption  rates  of  diversified  practices \nrequired  for  success  are  relatively  modest.  Yet  the  Project  does  entail  significant  risks.  The \nestablishment  and  sustainable  operations  of  efficient,  self-financed  industry  organizations  is \n\nImpact on Consumers \n\n Risks \n\n3. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n       Appendix 12          63 \n\n \n \n \ncrucial for long-term sustainability and for increased adoption of crop diversification by farmers. \nIn  addition,  sufficient  land  must  be  available  for  diversified  farming.  While  the  gross  margins \nupon  which  the  benefits  are  derived  are  seen  as  realistic,  the  achievement  of  these  returns \ndepends  on  the  attainment  of  quality  standards  that  most  farmers  in  Fiji  have  not  hitherto \nachieved.  The  Project  needs  to  oversee  a  transformation  from  the  dependency  on  sugarcane \nmentality to the business mentality of diversified crop production in a relatively short period. The \nProject will focus on this transformation, which is essential for the Project\u2019s success. \n \nThe Project also faces quarantine risks. The incursion of a new, exotic fruit fly would see \n20. \nthe cessation of most fruit and vegetable exports for several years. Market access for many of \nthe identified export products requires the negotiation of BQA with the importing countries, and \ntheir  willingness  to  assign  priority  and  resources  to  this  process  remains  a  risk.  The \nstrengthening  of  the  quarantine  service  is  the  Project\u2019s  response  directed  at  mitigating \nquarantine  risks;  however,  assurances  are  required  from  the  Government  that  it  will  devote \nadequate  resources  to  quarantine  surveillance.  The  strengthening  of  quarantine  activities  will \nmitigate the risk. \n \n21. \nThe lack of financial services to undertake income-generating and small farm livelihood \nactivities  under  the  Project  poses  a  risk  to  its  overall  success.  MASLR\u2019s  implementation \ncapability  also  needs  to  be  strengthened  through  the  Project  Implementation  Unit.  Political \ninterference  in  the  allocation  and  use  of  resources  needs  to  be  minimized  if  the  Project  is  to \nsucceed  in  achieving  its  objectives.  The  Project  will  endeavor  to  secure  privatized  service \nproviders  to  ensure  long-term  sustainability.  Greater  skills  development  and  transfer  are \npriorities. The Project will mainly focus on individuals\u2019 skills development and empowerment. \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 November 2004) \n \n", "Currency Unit\nF$1.00\nUS$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Fiji dollar (F$) \nUS$0.5136 \nF$1.947 \n", " \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n", " \nACP \nADB \n \nALTA   \n \nBQA \nCCSLA \n \nEIRR \n \nEU \n \nFCA \n \nFDB \nFSC \n \nFSCUL \n \nGDP \n \nIEE \nlb \n \nLIBOR  \nMASLR \nMFI \n \nNCSMED \nNGO \n \nNLTB   \n \nNSC \n \nOFL \nPCU \n \n \nPIU \nPPME   \nPPMS   \nRFS \n \nSCGC   \n \nSCU \n \nSDP \nTA \n \n \nTCC \nTPAF   \n \nWTO \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "African, Caribbean, and Pacific \nAsian Development Bank \nAgricultural Landlord and Tenant Act \nbilateral quarantine agreement \nCanefarmers Cooperative Savings and Loan Association \neconomic internal rate of return \nEuropean Union \nFiji College of Agriculture \nFiji Development Bank \nFiji Sugar Corporation \nFiji Savings and Credit Union League \ngross domestic product \ninitial environmental examination \nUS pound \nLondon interbank offered rate \nMinistry of Agriculture, Sugar and Land Resettlement \nmicrofinance institution \nNational Center for Small and Micro Enterprise Development \nnongovernment organization \nNative Land Trust Board \nnational steering committee \noff-farm livelihoods \nproject coordination unit \nproject implementation unit \nproject performance monitoring and evaluation \nproject performance monitoring system \nrural financial services \nSugar Cane Growers Council \nsavings and credit union \nStrategic Development Plan \ntechnical assistance \nthrift and credit cooperative \nTraining and Productivity Authority of Fiji \nWorld Trade Organization \n", "NOTE \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \n", "This report was prepared by K.
