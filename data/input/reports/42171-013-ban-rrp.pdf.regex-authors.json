THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Khulna Water Supply Project. The report also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting the Khulna Water Supply Project, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, will approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The project will develop a sustainable water supply system in Khulna city, which relies \nentirely on groundwater.2 It will introduce surface water as the main water source for sustainable \nwater resource management in Khulna city. The project adopts a climate-proof design, adapting \nto an expected increase in the salinity of the river water as a result of sea level rise. The \nproject\u2019s capacity building component will also strengthen the corporate management system of \nKhulna  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Authority  (KWASA),  which  has  been  established  in \nFebruary 2008.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale   \n3.  Water supply in Khulna city. Citizens in Khulna city have been suffering from limited \naccess to water supply services. Only 23% of the population of about 1 million has access to \npiped water supply, and the rest resorts to alternative sources, such as shared public taps and \ntube  wells  built  privately.  The  existing  system  is  old  and  poorly  maintained,  resulting  in \nsubstantial leakage and low quality of water.3 A survey shows that even households connected \nto the piped network enjoy only intermittent water supply (5.3 hours per day), and 74% of \nhouseholds find the supplied quantity insufficient.4 As for water quality, 59% of the surveyed \nhouseholds perceived the supplied water to be dirty and 55% rated the service standards very \npoor or poor.5 Many unconnected households rely on shared public taps and spend a daily \naverage of 90 minutes fetching water, imposing a particular burden on women who tend to \nmanage water for the whole family. The project will expand the access to water supply services \nby building a surface water treatment plant and extending the distribution network to cover the \nwhole city.  \n \n4.  Water resource management. Khulna city relies entirely on groundwater for its water \nsource.6 KWASA\u2019s deep tube wells yield 30,100 cubic meters (m3) per day, supplying water to \nthe piped network. In addition, there are many privately built tube wells and KWASA\u2019s hand-\npumped tube wells; the total abstraction of groundwater is estimated at 113,000 m3/day. An \nassessment  of  the  groundwater  showed  that  abstraction  should  be  limited  to  ensure  the \nsustainability of the groundwater resource. The project will develop a surface water treatment \nplant  with  110,000  m3/day  capacity  to  meet  the  growing  demand  without  increasing  the \ngroundwater abstraction and undermining its sustainability.7 The groundwater will be monitored \nand managed in a sustainable manner. In addition to KWASA\u2019s wells, private wells will be \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory TA: ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the \nPeople's Republic of Bangladesh for Preparing the Khulna Water Supply Project. Manila. \n3  Physical loss is estimated at 36% of the produced water. \n4  The survey was conducted under ADB. 2008. Small Scale Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of \nBangladesh for Supporting the Establishment of Khulna Water and Sewerage Authority. Manila. The survey covers \n3,000 households randomly selected in Khulna city.  \n5  Service standards were rated fair by 33% of the surveyed households and good by 11%.  \n6  Arsenic contamination is not found in Khulna city. \n7  The groundwater table is declining by 2\u20133 meters annually in some areas in Dhaka because of overextraction.  \n ", "2 \nregistered to monitor and regulate the abstraction of groundwater. Groundwater and surface water \nwill be used conjunctively to ensure environmentally sustainable and economically efficient water \nresource management. \n \n5.  Climate change impacts. Khulna city is located in the coastal belt of Bangladesh\u2014one \nof the most vulnerable areas to climate change impacts. Rivers near Khulna city are already \naffected by salinity intrusion, and the sea level rise caused by climate change is expected to \nexacerbate the problem of salinity intrusion. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) conducted a \nstudy to simulate climate change impacts in Khulna city and develop adaptation strategies.8 The \nresults of the study are incorporated in the project design to make the project climate-proof. In \nparticular, the intake facilities will be located upriver to avoid salinity, and an impounding reservoir \nwill be built to store fresh water so that water quality will be ensured even with the expected \nincrease of salinity in the river water.  \n \n6.  Establishing and strengthening the Khulna Water Supply and Sewerage Authority. \nThe Government of Bangladesh established KWASA in February 2008.9 KWASA is the third \nwater  supply  and  sewerage  authority  established  in  the  country,  following  the  Dhaka  and \nChittagong  water  supply  and  sewerage  authorities.  Khulna  City  Corporation  was  directly \nresponsible  for  water  supply  service  in  Khulna  city  before  the  establishment  of  KWASA. \nAlthough KWASA has been legally established, further efforts are required to develop it into a \ncapable water utility with a proper management system, competent human resources, and a \nsound financial management system. As KWASA is a recently established organization with \nnew personnel and systems, it is opportune to provide adequate support to develop it into a \nfinancially viable water utility that can serve as a model in Bangladesh.  \n \n7.  Development  coordination.  The  project  was  developed  through  dialogue  among \ndevelopment partners at the local consultative group for the water and sanitation sector, and \nunder the partnership framework for urban water supply and sanitation.10 The project will be \ncofinanced by ADB and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) under a harmonized \nand  unified  framework.  One  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing the entire project, regardless of the funding source. ADB and JICA will jointly \nreview the project implementation as well as KWASA\u2019s corporate management against common \nperformance indicators.  \n \n8.  Lessons.  The  project  reflects  lessons  and  recommendations  from  previous \ninterventions.  For  example,  a  recent  sector  program  assistance  evaluation  concluded  that \ncofinancing  is  a  good  option  to  scale  up  investment  in  urban  water  supply  projects  in \nBangladesh; this is proposed in the project.11 Other lessons from past water supply projects in \nBangladesh  identified  careful  tariff  setting  and  financial  management  as  vital  for  project \nsustainability.12 KWASA\u2019s financial condition was thoroughly assessed and a financial plan was \nprepared to ensure long-term sustainability. \n \n9.  Context in country programming. The project is in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy \nand program for Bangladesh, 2006\u20132010.13 Urban water supply is a focus area of the country \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nstrategy and program, and the sector outcome is increased coverage of access to safe water \nand other improvement of urban services. The project will directly contribute to the sector \noutcome by expanding access to clean drinking water in Khulna city. The project will also \ncontribute to Millennium Development Goal 7 through the expansion of access to safe water. \nThe  project  will  complement  the  planned  improvement  of  drainage  under  the  City  Region \nDevelopment  Project 14  and  of  solid  waste  management  under  the  Urban  Public  and \nEnvironmental  Health  Sector  Development  Program15 for  a  better  urban  environment.  The \nproject is also in line with the government\u2019s draft Sector Development Plan, 2011\u20132025, which \nhas identified significant financing gap in the water supply sector, and has identified this sector \nas a priority for investments.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the project will be improved urban services in Khulna city. The outcome \nwill be expanded and reliable access to potable water in Khulna city.  \n \nC.  Outputs    \n11.  The outputs of the project will be (i) augmented and sustainably managed water sources \nin Khulna city, (ii) an extended and efficiently managed distribution network in Khulna city, and  \n(iii) professional and sustainable corporate management of KWASA. The activities under (i) will \nbe mostly financed by JICA, and those under (ii) and (iii) will be financed by ADB.  \n \n1.  Output 1: Augmented and Sustainably Managed Water Sources  \n12.  The water sources in Khulna city will be augmented and managed sustainably under the \nproject. The project will develop a surface water treatment plant to meet the growing demand \nand avoid excessive abstraction of groundwater. Groundwater and surface water will be used \nconjunctively to ensure environmentally sustainable and economically efficient water resource \nmanagement. Groundwater will be monitored and assessed regularly, and abstraction will be \nlimited to a sustainable level.  \n \n13.  Rivers near Khulna city are already affected by salinity intrusion, which is expected to \nworsen as a result of climate change. Locating the intake upriver will reduce the salinity level of \nraw water, though it will increase the cost of water transmission to Khulna city. The intake point \nhas been identified by considering the future salinity level and the costs of water transmission. \nAt the selected intake point, it is expected that the chloride concentration level will exceed the \ngovernment standard in the dry season only for a limited period. 16 Water with low chloride \nconcentration will be collected during the rainy season and stored in an impounding reservoir. \nWater with high chloride concentration collected during the dry season will be diluted, with the \nwater stored in the impounding reservoir to meet the government standard.17  \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the City Region Development Project. Manila. \n15 ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Urban Public and Environmental Health Sector Development Program. \nManila. \n16 The government standard is 1,000 milligrams/liter (mg/l) based on the government\u2019s Environment Conservation \nRules, 1997. Khulna is classified a coastal area, where 1,000 mg/l is the threshold. The threshold for other areas is \n600 mg/l.  \n17 The size of the impounding reservoir depends on the period of dry season when the raw water exceeds the \ngovernment\u2019s standard on chloride concentration. Uncertainties exist about future water quality because of climate \nchange impacts and a dredging project in upriver from the intake. KWASA will keep monitoring water quality and ", "4 \n \n14.  The groundwater will be used as a supplementary source of water. It will be monitored \nand assessed regularly, and abstraction from KWASA\u2019s tube wells will be limited to a certain \nlevel. Private wells will be registered to monitor and regulate the abstraction.18 The total amount \nof groundwater abstraction will be contained to a sustainable level, taking into consideration the \nlimited increase of abstraction from KWASA\u2019s tube wells and switching of private well users to \nKWASA\u2019s piped network. Treated water from the surface treatment plant will be mixed with \ngroundwater at distribution reservoirs in the city. Since the groundwater is not affected by \nsalinity, it will provide a further buffer during unexpectedly long dry seasons and a high salinity \nlevel in raw water. Activities under output 1 will include the construction of intake facilities, a \nsurface water treatment plant, an impounding reservoir, and a raw water transmission main, \nwhich  will  be  financed  by  JICA;  and  rehabilitation  of  deep  tube  wells  and  monitoring  of \ngroundwater, which will be financed by ADB.  \n \n2.  Output 2: Extended and Efficiently Managed Distribution Network \n15.  The water distribution system will be extended and water will be delivered efficiently in \nKhulna city. The project will improve the access to the piped network from 23% in 2010 to 62% \nby 2018, benefiting about 710,000 persons in Khulna city. An additional 490,000 persons will \nhave  a  new  connection  to  the  piped  network,  and  220,000  persons  who  already  have  a \nconnection will benefit from the improved services. Those using hand pumps consume on \naverage 45 liters per capita per day, which will increase to 120 liters per capita per day. The \npoor, in particular, will benefit since their residences tend to be outside the current coverage \nareas and they spend a substantial amount of time each day fetching water. \n \n16.  The distribution network will be divided into five zones, and KWASA\u2019s zonal offices will \nbe  established  to  manage  the  network  and  all  customer-related  services.  The  distribution \nnetwork in each zone will be divided into district metering areas. KWASA will rigorously monitor \nthe amount of inflow, outflow, and consumption in each area and control the pressure and \nminimize leaks. Revenue collection will be assessed in each zonal office to benchmark the \nperformance. Water quality will be regularly monitored at sources and through the distribution \nnetwork to ensure the delivery of potable water.   \n \n17.  To promote quick expansion, house connections will be provided under the project. The \nconnection charges during the project implementation period will be set low to encourage house \nconnections. The low connection charge will help expand the coverage of piped network\u2014even \nfor poor households\u2014bringing down one of the most significant barriers to obtain a piped \nconnection.  For  In  low-income  communities  where  individual  connection  is  not  a  practical \nsolution, water user groups will be formulated to manage the communal tap. Activities under \noutput 2 will be financed by ADB and include expansion of the distribution network, construction \nof a clear water transmission main, and establishment of zonal offices.  \n \n3.  Output 3: Professional and Sustainable Corporate Management \n18.  The  project  will  provide  a  range  of  assistance  to  help develop  a  professional  and \nsustainable corporate management system at KWASA, which has been recently established \nwith limited financial and human resources. KWASA has developed its first 5-year business \n                                                                                                                                                       \nadjust the size of the impounding reservoir in the future as and when required. The government will acquire lands \nlarger than required for the proposed facilities, if necessary.  \n18 An annual charge will be introduced for the use of private wells, as in Dhaka city. \n ", "5 \nplan, including a capital investment plan, financial plan, and human resource development \nplan.19  \n \n19.  The capital investments under the project will be the core components of the capital \nworks plan to augment water production and extend service coverage. The capital works plan \nalso includes smaller projects funded by the government, such as rehabilitation of deep tube \nwells  and  extension  of  the  distribution  network,  which  can  be  implemented  quickly  and \ncomplement the project.  \n \n20.  Current KWASA financial conditions are weak because of the small customer base20 \nand low tariff levels.21 The financial plan covers a series of revenue enhancement measures, in \naddition to the natural revenue increase caused by the expansion of service coverage. KWASA \ncurrently charges flat monthly rates for each connection, which will be converted to a monthly \ncharge to each household. KWASA has identified the existing illegal connections and started \nregistering  them  as  legal  connections.  Domestic  meters  will  be  gradually  installed  and  a \nvolumetric tariff will be introduced for each category of customers.22  \n \n21.  Since KWASA\u2019s operation will be far larger than the current one, the project will provide \ncomprehensive support for human resource development, including gradual expansion and \nadjustment of the organizational structure, and training of recruited staff and management. The \ntraining  program  will  include  financial  management,  customer  services,  procurement,  and \nsafeguard  compliance.  KWASA\u2019s  human  resources  will  expand  in  accordance  with  the \nexpansion of operation, and will be decentralized through the establishment of zonal offices to \nfocus on customer service. Activities under output 3 will be financed by ADB and will include \ncapacity development programs and consulting services for KWASA\u2019s corporate management \nsystem. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n22.  The project is estimated to cost $363.5 million, including land acquisition, incremental \nrecurrent costs, and taxes and duties. Land acquisition and taxes and duties will be financed \nentirely  by  the  government.  Resettlement  costs,  other  than  land  acquisition  and  asset \ncompensation  cost,  are  eligible  for  ADB  financing.  The  investment  plan  is  summarized  in \nTable 1 and described in detail in the project administration manual.23 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n19 Summary of KWASA Business Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20  Currently only 23% of the city population is connected to KWASA\u2019s piped network. \n21  Most customers pay Tk45\u2013Tk70 per connection per month, depending on the connection pipe diameter. \n22  Meter coverage will increase from 0% (FY2010) to 20% (FY2013) and 40% (FY2016). The coverage will reach \n100% in FY2017, and then the volumetric tariff will be introduced. The volumetric tariff will be differentiated for \ncommercial and industrial customers. Increasing block tariff is not planned since it may not bring the anticipated \npro-poor effects in Khulna. Multiple households under one connection, which are common in low-income areas, \nmay end up in a high-consumption block with a higher rate. \n23  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

The TA is estimated to cost $800,000 equivalent, of which $700,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV) and $100,000 will be \nprovided by the government through in-kind contribution. The TA will focus on priority areas of \nplanning and technical support, such as metering of house connections, public communication, \ninformation technology, and procurement capacity. The outline terms of reference are included \nin the project administration manual (footnote 23). KWASA will be the executing agency for the \nTA and will provide counterpart staff and office space. Individual consultants will be engaged to \nimplement the TA.   \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n29.  Economic analysis. The estimated economic internal rate of return is 13.6%, indicating \na sufficiently high economic return. The result is robust against downside risks, including higher \ncosts and decreased benefits. Quantified project benefits include incremental consumption of \nwater (valued at the willingness to pay) and non-incremental consumption of water (valued at \nresource cost savings). The result most likely underestimates the project benefits, since the ", "8 \nproject has other benefits (such as improvement of health) that are not easily quantifiable and \nare not accounted for in the analysis. Details are provided in the economic analysis.24  \n \n30.  Financial analysis. The estimated financial internal rate of return is \u20132.7% (below the \nweighted average cost of capital estimated at 0.4%). The results reflect the low level of planned   \ntariff, which is determined based on the assessment of willingness to pay and affordability. The \nprojected cash flow of KWASA shows that adequate funds will be available for operation and \nmaintenance  expenditures  and  debt  service,  even  with  the  low  tariff  level,  because  of \nconcessional terms of relending by the government to KWASA.25 KWASA will fully recover the \noperation and maintenance costs and partly recover the capital costs in line with government \npolicy.26 Details are provided in the financial analysis.27 \n \nB.  Governance \n31.  KWASA  does  not  have  extensive  experience  in  managing  large  externally  funded \nprojects. Based on assessments of KWASA\u2019s current capacity, the project will provide adequate \ntraining and support through consulting services for financial management, procurement, and \nsafeguard measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 23) and are included in \nthe loan agreement of ADB. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n32.  Services for the poor. Low-income households are mostly excluded from the existing \npiped water supply. The major impediment to improved water services for the poor will be \naffordability of the connection costs. The project will provide household connections with low \nconnection  charges  to  promote  individual  connections  even  for  the  poor.28 In  low-income \ncommunities where individual connection is not a practical solution, water user groups will be \nformulated to manage the communal tap. The taps will be metered and KWASA will collect the \nbill through a caretaker of the tap chosen by the respective user groups. To enhance awareness \non  public  hygiene  and  acceptability  of  the  tariff  adjustment,  a  series  of  public  awareness \ncampaign activities will be implemented with the support of consultants. \n \n33.  Gender.  Expanding  coverage  of  piped  water  supply  will  benefit  women,  since  the \nburden to fetch water for the family usually falls on women. A gender action plan has been \ndeveloped. Awareness-raising campaigns will particularly target women, since they are the \nprimary caretakers of household health. Women will be encouraged to play a major role in water \nuser groups in low-income communities. Women will have equal opportunity to participate in \n                                                \n24 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25  Except during the initial years of establishment, KWASA will not obtain explicit subsidies. The concessional \nrelending will help KWASA to maintain a positive cash flow. \n26 The government policy emphasizes operation and maintenance cost recovery, and full recovery of capital was set \nas the eventual goal. Government of Bangladesh.1988. National Policy for Safe Water Supply and Sanitation \n(8.3.2) states: \u201cIn the near future water tariff shall be determined on the basis of the cost of water production, \noperation  and  maintenance,  administration  and  depreciation.\u201d  Government  of  Bangladesh.  2006.  Sector \nDevelopment Programme: Water and Sanitation Sector (page 34) states \u201c\u2026 stresses the need for increasing water \ntariff in urban areas to at least cover the operation and maintenance costs\u201d and \u201cHowever, water being a social \ngood, the transition to full cost-recovery should be gradual\u201d \n27 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28  The connections will be provided as part of the project with a charge lower than the actual cost during project \nimplementation. KWASA plans to charge the actual cost after project completion, which will be further assessed \nbased on the progress of coverage expansion and financial conditions.  \n ", "9 \nproject-supported training programs and recruitment. Efforts to reduce wage inequality between \nmen and women and to ensure core labor standards will be in place.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n34.  Environmental safeguards. The project is classified category B in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  KWASA  prepared  an  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE)29 as part of the feasibility study, including an environmental management \nplan  (EMP).  The  IEE  concluded  that  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are \nanticipated and that the project will have only small, localized impacts to be mitigated through \nmeasures outlined in the EMP. The IEE and EMP will be updated during detailed design as \nnecessary. The EMP will be incorporated into bidding and contract documents and implemented \nby contractors and consultants; the PMU will monitor the EMP. The PMU will be provided with \nconsultancy and capacity building in managing the environmental impacts. KWASA will be \nresponsible for implementing the EMP and will report the progress to ADB. The IEE represents \na single, unified document to ensure compliance with the rules and guidelines of ADB, JICA, \nand the government; and will be implemented as a single process regardless of the funding \nsource. KWASA plans to develop wastewater treatment facilities in the medium term to meet \nexpected increase in water usage. \n \n35.  Social safeguards. The project is classified category A for involuntary resettlement and \ncategory C for indigenous people in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nA total of 29.6 hectares of private land will be acquired under the project. Properties to be \nacquired are primarily agricultural lands or lowland fishing ponds without residential structures. \nThe  resettlement  impacts  are  therefore  limited  to  economic  displacement  and  no  physical \ndisplacement  from  housing  will  occur.  Involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  considered \nsignificant as more than 200 persons are expected to experience major impacts.30 KWASA \nprepared  a  resettlement  plan31 that  specifies  entitlements  for  affected  persons  including \ncompensation at replacement cost, livelihood restoration measures, and special assistance \nmeasures for vulnerable groups. The resettlement plan represents a single, unified document to \nensure compliance with the rules and guidelines of ADB, JICA, and the government; and will be \nimplemented as a single process regardless of the funding sources. The government is strongly \ncommitted  to  implementing  the  resettlement  plan.  At  present,  the  capacity  on  safeguards \nplanning  and  implementation  at  KWASA  is  not  strong.  Consultants  recruited  under  the \nassociated capacity development TA will provide capacity building and other support to ensure \neffective implementation of safeguard measures.   \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized below. Risks are mitigated to a \nmanageable level. The benefits and impacts of the project are expected to outweigh the costs \nand risks. \n \n                                                \n29 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Major impacts are defined as losing 10% or more of their productive assets (income generating). It is estimated \nthat the economically displaced persons include 110 legal title holders (490 persons) and 15 non-titled holders \n(69 economically displaced persons), among which 309 persons are expected to have major impacts. \n31 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

Groundwater, which contains much less \nsalinity even in the dry season, will remain as a secondary water source and will be used to \ndilute the saline water.  \nKWASA = Khulna Water Supply and Sewerage Authority. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n37.  The government and KWASA have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in the \nproject administration manual (footnote 23) and loan documents. The government and KWASA \nhave agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan \nagreement.  As  conditions  for  the  disbursement,  the  government  will  (i)  establish  the \ninterministerial steering committee and the PMU, (ii) appoint the project director and the project \nmanagers for the  PMU,  and  (iii)  have  signed subsidiary  loan  agreement,  in  the form  and \nsubstance acceptable to ADB. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR46,927,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Khulna \nWater Supply Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n20 May 2011\n ", "  Appendix 1         11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact        Assumption \nImproved urban  Average time to fetch water per  Annual consumer survey    Khulna city does not expand \nservices in Khulna  day per household (Total  to include fringe areas. \n \ncity  households: from 90 minutes in \nRisk \n2009 to 15 minutes in 2020; \nhouseholds headed by women:  A large number of migrants \nfrom 110 minutes in 2009 to  settle in fringe areas.  \n20 minutes in 2020)ab \nOutcome      Assumption \nExpanded and  Household coverage with access to  KWASA\u2019s MIS reports  Population of Khulna city \nreliable access to  piped water (Total households:  does not grow too rapidly as \n \npotable water in  from 22.6% in 2010 to 62.3% in  a result of large migration.  \nKhulna city  2018; households headed by   \nRisk \nwomen: from 22.8% in 2010 to \n62.3% in 2017) b     Pollution of water sources \nAverage hours of supply (from  Annual consumer survey   by new industries upriver \nfrom the intake. \n5.3 hours/day in 2009 to \n \n24 hours/day in 2017) \nLaboratory test results \nShare of water samples meeting  \nthe government\u2019s water quality \nstandard (100% in 2017) \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.
