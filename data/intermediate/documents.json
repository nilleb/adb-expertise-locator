Our survey reveals that increased trade openness by developing countries appears to have contributed to narrowing the development gap vis-\u00e0-vis developed countries, while its impact on the income gap between developing countries are not clear. The impact of increased trade or trade liberalization on within-country inequalities is mixed. In some cases, trade liberalization improved wage-inequality, but in some other cases, the opposite pattern was observed. Similar mixed patterns are found for regional inequalities. These mixed findings are consistent with the fact that theoretical predictions are also mixed. One reason for the mixed findings is the impact of other factors affecting inequalities, including labor market conditions, inflow of capital, and policy reforms.

Educational expansion is a major factor in reducing educational inequality and thus income inequality. Public policies that improve social benefits and price stability contribute to reducing income inequality, while public spending on education helps to reduce educational inequality. In contrast, higher per capita income, greater openness to international trade, and faster technological progress tend to make both income and education distribution more unequal.

Better accessibility will change the mobility patterns and will eventually affect the development in the impacted region, reshaping the entire urban-regional system. The HSR is expected to play a catalyzing role in driving the spatial and urban transformation process. We emphasize the importance of establishing a synergy between HSR and urban development. A synergy between HSR and other elements, like urban transit facilities, paratransit, station area development, node, and sub-center development, can usher in spatial and economic development, but an institutional arrangement across all the elements is of paramount importance.

We believe more specific research is needed to assess the overall environmental impact of patterns of production and consumption. Recent scientific analysis focuses on better scientific measures of the damage and impact of climate change and its effect on inequality. Clearly, warmer regions around the globe, including India and many developing Asian countries, will be affected more than their northern counterparts due to global warming. In fact, recent estimates show that climate change has increased inequality in the United States between the north and the south. Patterns of production are generally induced by the conditions of global trade and investment and by physical infrastructural support and local resources. India and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the two largest countries in Asia, have very different GDP compositions. This poses the question of whether excessive industrialization coupled with the usual transboundary and climate concerns make the PRC more vulnerable than India, which thrives on service sector growth and in turn benefits from the low pollution content of growth.

We show that ISWE is desirable as it could contribute toward creating a level playing field for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) participating in global supply chains. We discuss the ASEAN Single Window (ASW) to identify prospects and challenges, and highlight the legal and economic viability of interoperability. We examine ASW from the transaction cost and information asymmetry theory perspectives to provide a methodology for conducting empirical analysis at country level. Based on the findings, we argue that the full potential of ISWE can be realized through the integration of transport and commercial requirements, thereby improving government-to-government, business-to-government, and business-to-business information flows. Nevertheless, such integration would require the ability to capture the complex relationships between various transport actors from legal and technical standpoints. To illustrate this legal complexity from transport and e-commerce law angle, we examine the disadvantageous position of SMEs in relation to the use of electronic bills of lading and access to supply chain finance. A critical analysis of selected legal texts is made through the lens of recent developments such as distributed ledger and cloud technologies to suggest solutions for SMEs. The conclusion highlights that transport and commercial requirements in the ISWE have to be incorporated through laws made for e-commerce and not through a piecemeal approach that replicate the functions of paper documents in an electronic environment.", "url": "https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/adbi/adbi-wp744.pdf"}, "adbi-wp909.pdf": {"title": "Marketing: The Crucial Success Factor for Pakistan\u2019s Credit Guarantee Scheme", "subject": "To motivate banks to lend to SMEs, the State Bank of Pakistan introduced a \u201cCredit Guarantee Scheme for Small and Rural Enterprises\u201d in 2010. However, the response to the scheme was initially somewhat muted, which may arguably have been due to factors like the design of the offer, its governance structure, or the reluctance of financial institutions to engage with SMEs in general and the credit guarantee scheme in particular\u2014or a combination thereof. Nevertheless, in this paper, we confine our focus to a discussion of how inadequate marketing diluted the scheme\u2019s impact. Specifically, several commercial banks could not tailor elements of their marketing mix\u2014including people, products, processes, and promotions\u2014to take full advantage of the scheme. That said, periodic revisions of the scheme helped to address some of its shortcomings, while the expectation is that other indicators will improve due to the recent changes in the scheme\u2019s parameters. The key finding is that policy makers can maximize the impact of a credit guarantee scheme by paying attention to the marketing mix, which sets up participating financial institutions for success (or failure) during the implementation phase. In addition, the scheme\u2019s structure should be a long-term intervention and its intended duration should be clear at the outset so that the participating financial institutions are motivated to design and roll out specialized products that tap the full potential of credit guarantees.

Therefore, the BOJ will eventually need to make it more sustainable before underlying inflation approaches 2%. Leaving room for additional monetary accommodation in the event of severe recession is also essential. Keeping the possible phasing out of the program in mind, the BOJ explicitly expanded the target range to \u00b10.2%, thereby effectively raising the yields of 10 years and longer and steepening the yield curve. At the same time, the BOJ introduced flexibility on exchange-traded fund (ETF) purchases that would enable \u201cstealth tapering\u201d or cutting the amount of annual purchase amount quietly without declaring it openly\u2014as in the case of Japanese government bond (JGB) purchases.

Since the Japanese economy is likely to face an economic slowdown after the 2019 consumption tax hike and the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, it will be much longer before the BOJ can take decisive steps to normalize monetary policy by raising the short-term policy rates like the Federal Reserve.

At the same time, trade in health products is hampered by substantive trade barriers. In this paper, we present evidence that countries around the world still apply tariffs and nontariff measures that increase prices and limit the availability of health-related products such as pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and medical equipment. The case for liberalizing trade in these products is therefore strong. In addition, we show that improving trade facilitation performance, using the World Trade Organization\u2019s Trade Facilitation Agreement as a starting point, can be linked to improved handling of health-related products such as vaccines which, in turn, would boost usage. In the last part of the paper, we study the price differences for insulin across countries. We observe that the price of insulin has various determinants, one of them being open trade: the higher the level of competition between manufacturers, the lower the price of insulin. In summary, lowering trade barriers on health products can make a substantive contribution to building up health systems and lowering out-of-pocket payments of patients.", "url": "https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/adbi/adbi-wp643.pdf"}, "adbi-wp1176.pdf": {"title": "What Are the Determinants of Fuel Subsidies in Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Countries?", "subject": "Fuel subsidies are widespread and debated extensively. The issues with these subsidies are fully acknowledged by many energy economists; however, the total subsidy level remains high. This is because energy subsidies are often closely related to the political economy viewpoint. Moreover, the rationale underlying fossil fuel subsidies, particularly concerning political, economic, and social contexts, is to reduce energy poverty, ensure access to energy, and redistribute the wealth that stems from the exploitation of national resources. Although there is considerable controversy surrounding the efficiency of these policies, energy subsidies confer private benefits on particular interest groups and, once implemented, tend to persist. We discuss and model various aspects of the political economy of fuel subsidy reform in selected Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies. Applying a panel data set from the period 1991\u20132018, we provide an empirical analysis of the economic and political perspectives of fuel prices in APEC countries resulting from the elimination of fossil fuel subsidization policies. Our findings robustly support the current economic trend of those governments that have decided to phase out fossil fuel energy policies.

This is akin to the \u201ccreative destruction\u201d hypothesis coined by economist Joseph Schumpeter in 1943 to describe the process where innovation, learning, and growth promote advanced technologies as conventional technologies become outmoded. To test the hypothesis in the context of natural disasters, we look at the case of the Philippines\u2014among the most vulnerable countries in the world to such disasters, especially typhoons. Using synthetic panel data regressions, we show that typhoon-affected households are more likely to fall into lower income levels, although disasters can also promote economic growth. Augmenting the household data with municipal fiscal data, we show some evidence of the creative destruction effect: Municipal governments in the Philippines helped mitigate the poverty impact by allocating more fiscal resources to build local resilience while also utilizing additional funds poured in by the national government for rehabilitation and reconstruction.", "url": "https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/adbi/adbi-wp817.pdf"}, "adbi-wp608.pdf": {"title": "Structural Change and Income Distribution: Accounting for Regional Inequality in the People\u2019s Republic of China and Its Changes during 1952\u20132012", "subject": "This study explores the relationship between inequality and structural transformation by constructing a theoretical model, developing analytical frameworks, and implementing a case study.

Evidence from India and Pakistan", "subject": "This study investigates the impact of internal and external research and development (R&D) on the innovation performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in India and Pakistan. Micro-level data was obtained for 3,492 Indian and 696 Pakistani SMEs from the World Bank\u2019s Enterprise Survey, and bivariate probit estimation techniques were used. The results show that internal and external R&D positively affects product and process innovations. However, this effect is stronger for Indian SMEs. The negative relationship between firm size and innovation output implies that SMEs in both countries face resource constraints. Further, Indian SMEs are dominant in terms of undertaking internal R&D and generating product and process innovations relative to those in Pakistan. The complementary rel\u00acationship between internal and external R&D has been examined for both countries. The study is unique in comparing Indian and Pakistani SMEs innovation activities using micro-level data. The results suggest that business managers can utilize a balanced combination of internal and external R&D to accelerate innovation output and increase absorptive capacity. Specifically, public support for innovation, such as R&D grants, subsidies, and tax credits, could encourage SMEs to undertake more radical innovations.", "url": "https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/adbi/adbi-wp577.pdf"}, "adbi-wp1224.pdf": {"title": "Labor Supply of Older Workers in Thailand: The Role of Co-residence, Health, and Pensions", "subject": "During the last few decades, the composition of the Thai population has changed dramatically due to reduced fertility and the aging of the population.

Our main findings provide strong evidence that pensions and poorer health status reduce the LFP of older people in Thailand. Furthermore, while health status is significant across all analyses, pensions have less impact on lower-status workers, indicating that even if they receive a pension, they may still be too poor to retire. Finally, co-residence decreases the LFP only of older people in rural areas.

But due to lower international oil prices, it was unable to achieve this target and was forced to take further measures. Hence, in February 2016, the BOJ adopted a negative interest rate policy by massively increasing the money supply through purchasing long-term Japanese government bonds (JGB). The BOJ had previously purchased short-term government bonds mainly, a policy that flattened the yield curve of JGBs. On the one hand, banks reduced the numbers of government bonds because short-term bond yields had become negative, and even the interest rates of long-term government bonds up to 15 years became negative. On the other hand, bank loans to the corporate sector did not increase due to the Japanese economy\u2019s vertical investment\u2013saving (IS) curve. Firstly, we explain why the BOJ has to reduce its 2% inflation target in the present low oil price era. Secondly, we argue that Japan cannot make a sustainable recovery from its long-lasting recession and tackle its long-standing deflation problem by means of its current monetary policy and its negative interest rate policy in particular. It is of key importance to make the IS curve downward sloping rather than vertical. That means the rate of return on investment must be positive and companies must be willing to invest if interest rates are set too low. Japan\u2019s long-term recession is due to structural problems that cannot be solved by its current monetary policy.

We also identify key challenges and main success factors in relation to linking SMEs with GVCs. A total of 329 SMEs in both provinces were surveyed to collect quantitative data while four and eight FGDs and KIIs, respectively, were conducted to gather qualitative information. Both econometric and descriptive analyses were employed to accomplish the objectives of the research. The econometric analysis found that SMEs that are linked with GVCs have a higher level of profit than those that are not. Apart from the direct impact of GVCs, we also observe that linking with GVCs indirectly increases the performance of SMEs through enhancing the sales revenue and research and development activities of SMEs. The descriptive analysis recognized five main business sectors, namely information technology, apparel, gems and minerals, tea and other agricultural products, and handcraft, as the sectors with the most potential to link with GVCs. Among these five sectors, SMEs in information technology, apparel, and gems and minerals are more likely to link with GVCs. In addition, we recognized challenges, such as a lack of access to finance, a lack of technology, a lack of information, being unable to meet quality standards, and an inability to produce the quantity required, as the main obstacles to linking with GVCs. Furthermore, factors such as ensuring the quality of products, the availability of skilled labor, better access to finance, access to better technologies, the ability to produce at low cost, and access to BDSs increase the potential to link SMEs with GVCs.

The share of intraregional trade in total nonoil trade would increase steadily from 53% in 2010 to 58% in 2030.  The trade-to-GDP ratio would increase from 39.4% and 74.4% between these 2 years.

But, as its primary goal, the South pursuing economic development is willing to bear the costs of environmental degradation. Moving into Stage II, the environmental deterioration becomes so severe in the South that the vendor country begins to tackle the environmental problem by enacting government regulations. As a result, the costs and, hence, the prices of outsourced goods and services tend to increase for the firms in the North. However, the environmental protection measures undertaken generally fall short of the levels needed to restore the environmental quality acceptable by World Health Organization standards. We present a framework for analyzing the effects of international outsourcing on environment and, ultimately, social welfare in terms of gains and losses under three alternative scenarios regarding no, partial, or full accountability for outsourcing induced environmental damages. The policy implication is clear: to fully resolve the environmental problem in Stage III, the implementation of strong regulations or the fostering international cooperation is desirable; that is, until the environmental costs of outsourcing are fully accounted for by the outsourcing firms in the North.

Consequently, economists have been modeling crime-employing inequality indicators as one of the explanatory variables, yielding mixed results. We argue that income polarization rather than inequality should be taken into account in the context of crime analysis. Technically, in addition to income gaps as captured by inequality indicators, the recently developed polarization index of Duclos, Esteban, and Ray (2004) also measures social segregation, which implies immobility and alienation, both of which are closely related to social tensions and conflicts. Thus, this polarization index is expected to be a better variable in explaining crime. To substantiate our arguments, we use provincial panel data from the People\u2019s Republic of China to model the crime\u2013income distribution relationship. Income polarization is found to be positively and significantly associated with crime.

It is thus likely that its spillover effects are very different from those of the QQE without a negative interest rate. In the analysis, we examine spillover effects on Asian stock markets. We find that Japan\u2019s long-term interest rate had significant negative effects on Asian stock prices during the NIRP period. We also find that the spillover effects were especially significant through a decline of excess returns in Japan\u2019s finance sector.

Moreover, the magnitude of the effect on bond yields is progressively higher for countries deemed highly vulnerable to climate change.

The strategic guidance that the owner gives to an SOE has to address several areas of guidance. Ideally, it parallels the ownership strategies that are typical of more mature family enterprises.

The low interest rate environment appears to have affected the rising trends. Meanwhile, emerging/developing economies continue to issue cash significantly partly because their nominal gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates have been greater than those of advanced economies.

First, we investigate split incentives, third-party access, and lack of heat resource mapping as key barriers to investing in district heating energy efficiency projects. Second, to enable energy efficiency financing, we analyze three business models: a utility-led model with third-party access, a heat production competition model, and an energy service company model. The business model choice in large part depends on the integration level of production, transmission, and distribution activities in a given district heating system. Third, the heat prices must signal new investments in district heating capacity adequacy. We suggest four options for excess heat pricing, including system cost, free cost, a quantity target for clean heating, and indexing against the next best alternative. Finally, we conclude with policy implications to scale up energy efficiency financing in district heating.

Another mechanism emphasized in this paper is that infrastructure investment can promote urbanization through facilitating economic agglomeration toward hub cities. This agglomeration process also raises productivity in the economy. The lessons from the PRC have implications for infrastructure financing. On the one hand, recent reforms have allowed the market to play an increasingly important role in funding infrastructure investment, helping improve the efficiency of infrastructure investment and the productivity of the economy. On the other hand, evidence in the PRC suggests a cross-province spillover effect of road infrastructure, supporting the central government\u2019s role in infrastructure financing. Although the current infrastructure investment system is still distorted by local governments\u2019 incentives and decisions, there is no evidence of over-investment in infrastructure at the aggregate level. Nevertheless, there is strong evidence that the marginal return to infrastructure investment in the PRC has been rapidly declining. Hence, it is urgent for policy makers to reform the existing system to base their investment decisions on the economic returns to infrastructure.", "url": "https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/adbi/adbi-wp632.pdf"}, "micro-phi.pdf": {"title": "Commercialization of Microfinance: Philippines", "subject": "This report analyzes the progress toward commercialization of the Philippines' microfinance industry; explores the remaining challenges and implications for various types of stakeholders; and recommends positive approaches to the commercialization of microfinance while preserving the traditional social objective of microfinance institutions of expanding access by the poor to financial services.

The empirical results suggest that educational variables are highly influential in affecting income distribution. Our analysis indicates that a higher level of education achieved by the population aged 15 and over has improved income distribution in Asia, while educational inequality, measured by the education Gini index, has a negative effect on income distribution. Higher levels of globalization are correlated with higher levels of income inequality, while freedom, either political or economic, has marginal effects on the level of inequity in income distribution.", "url": "https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/adbi/adbi-wp732.pdf"}, "690331.pdf": {"title": "", "subject": "", "url": "https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/690331.pdf/690331.pdf"}, "adbi-dp22.pdf": {"title": "Microsoft Word - DP No.22_REV.doc", "subject": "", "url": "https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/adbi/adbi-dp22.pdf"}, "47051-001-prc-pptar.pdf": {"title": "Chemical Industry Energy Efficiency and Emission Reduction Project - Project Preparatory", "subject": "", "url": "https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/47051/47051-001-prc-pptar.pdf"}, "43142-tim-tar.pdf": {"title": "Microsoft Word - TA 7401-TIM _Final_.doc", "subject": "", "url": "https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/43142/43142-tim-tar.pdf"}, "39592-reg-tar.pdf": {"title": "Microsoft Word - BC_1Dec-RC_TA_REG_EastSouthAsiaCooperation ed CLEAN_2.doc", "subject": "", "url": "https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/39592/39592-reg-tar.pdf"}, "49450-001-pptar.pdf": {"title": "", "subject": "", "url": "https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/49450/49450-001-pptar.pdf"}, "47225-001-tar.pdf": {"title": "Myanmar: Support for Strengthening Public Debt Management ()", "subject": "This technical assistance report is a decision document for the Support for Strengthening Public Debt Management in Myanmar containing issues, impacts, outcomes, methodology and key activities as well as cost and financing and implementation arrangements presented to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors or Management for approval.", "url": "https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/47225/47225-001-tar.pdf"}, "37358-pak-tar.pdf": {"title": "Microsoft Word - R296-05.doc", "subject": "", "url": "https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/37358/37358-pak-tar.pdf"}, "36343-ind-rrp.pdf": {"title": "Microsoft Word - 061115_IND-RFSRDP_Main-Text  _Final_.doc", "subject": "", "url": "https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-document/66689/36343-ind-rrp.pdf"}, "tar-reg-36648.pdf": {"title": "", "subject": "", "url": "https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/tar/tar-reg-36648.pdf"}, "38346-tar-ind.pdf": {"title": "Technical Assistance India: Development of Road Agencies in the North Eastern States", "subject": "", "url": "https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/38346/38346-tar-ind.pdf"}, "42064-reg-tar.pdf": {"title": "South Asian Regional Cooperation in 2030: The Potential Role of India and Pakistan  (Financed by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility)", "subject": "", "url": "https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/42064/42064-reg-tar.pdf"}, "52194-001-tar-en.pdf": {"title": "Policy Research on Ecological Protection and Rural Vitalization for Supporting Green Development in the Yangtze River Economic Belt:", "subject": "Technical assistance reports provide the context and background of the project, and provide information on impacts and outcomes, key activities, estimated costs, financing, and implementation arrangements.
